1
00:00:05,407 --> 00:00:09,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, welcome back everybody to Rob Roberts and pals here on the Orange Lounge Radio feed.

2
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:12,611
[SPEAKER_03]: It's our E3 wrap-up show, the final day.

3
00:00:13,211 --> 00:00:18,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sadly, E3 2010 is all done, and today we're not coming to you from a hotel room.

4
00:00:18,534 --> 00:00:27,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, right now we are in the parking lot of In-N-Out Burger, where I've taken the one and only Bobby Blackwolf to his first In-N-Out experience.

5
00:00:27,419 --> 00:00:29,700
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bobby, hyped?

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:30,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Too much?

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Not enough?

8
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:32,481
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you think of In-N-Out?

9
00:00:33,282 --> 00:00:33,882
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a burger.

10
00:00:36,124 --> 00:00:36,544
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

11
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:11,069
[SPEAKER_03]: 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, but I really do urge you to tune in to the Bobby Blackwolf Show, who's right beforehand at 5 Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern.

12
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Rock Band 3

13
00:01:37,202 --> 00:01:38,183
[SPEAKER_02]: That blew me away.

14
00:01:39,344 --> 00:01:40,184
[SPEAKER_02]: All the stuff they added.

15
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:41,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize how much they added.

16
00:01:41,525 --> 00:01:42,946
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you guys covered it already.

17
00:01:43,506 --> 00:01:45,768
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not really going to add to it right now.

18
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:50,791
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will say one of the things I was able to... I played the keyboard and I played Pro Mode on Medium.

19
00:01:51,352 --> 00:01:54,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Which basically means that you have two notes at a time.

20
00:01:54,774 --> 00:01:56,235
[SPEAKER_02]: So two note chords and everything.

21
00:01:56,876 --> 00:02:04,401
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing that they don't tell a lot of people, and one thing that you don't realize, is that they actually do have bumps on the keys.

22
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,655
[SPEAKER_02]: To denote where the color changes.

23
00:02:07,735 --> 00:02:11,037
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't have to look at the keyboard when they shift.

24
00:02:11,577 --> 00:02:14,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can actually feel where the colors are.

25
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,081
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought that was... That's like one little tiny thing.

26
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:18,162
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't really mention it.

27
00:02:18,202 --> 00:02:18,882
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't say it.

28
00:02:18,942 --> 00:02:20,363
[SPEAKER_02]: But that adds a lot.

29
00:02:22,256 --> 00:02:34,599
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was that, and I also did an interview, and it's going to be on E3Coverage.com, and I actually stumped the guy about the MIDI port, because the Guitar Hero drum set has a MIDI input.

30
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like what they're saying, but it's not going to work for the Pro mode.

31
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:45,522
[SPEAKER_02]: You could use it for the basic, but you're not going to be able to use it in the Pro modes of anything.

32
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,263
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was interesting, and they are considering...

33
00:02:48,763 --> 00:02:50,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Portal 2 is hilarious Portal 2 is hilarious

34
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:12,422
[SPEAKER_02]: He admitted that to me.

35
00:03:12,482 --> 00:03:16,184
[SPEAKER_02]: They are talking to him, asking him who he wants to work with to do it.

36
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:18,625
[SPEAKER_02]: So he is definitely going to be a part of it for the music side.

37
00:03:20,186 --> 00:03:28,411
[SPEAKER_02]: But they've kept the humor and the gameplay elements they've added with the liquids, where you can either jump or slide really fast.

38
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:34,854
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the other objects that they've introduced really look like it's going to be a great title.

39
00:03:34,894 --> 00:03:36,195
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a standalone title.

40
00:03:37,996 --> 00:03:39,377
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really looking forward to that.

41
00:03:40,217 --> 00:03:56,840
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing non-gaming that I saw today that probably won't interest the OLR audience as much, but it's more of a glimpse of what they can do in the future, is I actually got a behind-the-scenes demo of Kinect with the dashboard.

42
00:03:57,661 --> 00:04:05,868
[SPEAKER_02]: So showing the video chat and stuff where the Kinect camera seamlessly will zoom in and out based on who's in the frame.

43
00:04:05,928 --> 00:04:08,690
[SPEAKER_02]: So like if you're sitting on the couch alone, it'll be zoomed in on you.

44
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:17,317
[SPEAKER_02]: If somebody sits next to you on the couch, it will automatically zoom out and put them in the picture, take the two of you into the picture and stuff like that, if that's the kind of thing you'd like to use.

45
00:04:18,098 --> 00:04:26,305
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, ESPN integration, it's not just watching ESPN3, which ESPN3 is their online...

46
00:04:27,494 --> 00:04:29,455
[SPEAKER_02]: The Ocho!

47
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:30,676
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the Ocho.

48
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:38,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it's all the stuff that they have regionally that air on regional stuff, but not good enough for the national.

49
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:50,545
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can watch anything online, like college football, if it's an out-of-market team for you, or if it's a very small school or something, they probably still have it on ESPN3.

50
00:04:51,006 --> 00:04:52,466
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't just watch it.

51
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:53,747
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually ask you...

52
00:04:55,304 --> 00:05:23,443
[SPEAKER_02]: who you're rooting for and it actually keeps track and here comes another plane the plane, the plane so it actually keeps track they showed us USC vs. Ohio State you're going to watch that college football game the first thing they ask you is who are you rooting for and then it tells you how many people percentages of people watching that on Xbox Live are rooting for that team and then it'll do trivia questions if you want that feature on and you're competing against the other fans while you're watching the game

53
00:05:24,511 --> 00:05:31,357
[SPEAKER_02]: and just stuff like that, you know, if they integrated that into ESPN, maybe other things, they would be able to integrate that same thing.

54
00:05:31,858 --> 00:05:38,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think maybe for like, you know, women and the gays, as they say, we could get the Oscars in the same type of situation?

55
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I'm so over the Oscars personally.

56
00:05:42,055 --> 00:05:47,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be awesome, where they would have people guess who might win and stuff, and who would get the award.

57
00:05:47,677 --> 00:05:48,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Who wore it best!

58
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and things like that.

59
00:05:52,299 --> 00:05:57,621
[SPEAKER_02]: There's very good opportunity there for that, and I was very impressed with that.

60
00:05:57,781 --> 00:06:00,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to use a little bit on the dashboard and stuff.

61
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:04,463
[SPEAKER_02]: You still have to take very slow, deliberate movements.

62
00:06:04,503 --> 00:06:06,544
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not at the minority report level yet.

63
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:10,978
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just flick around or something because you'll wind up hitting something you don't want to hit.

64
00:06:11,518 --> 00:06:15,120
[SPEAKER_02]: They were taking very deliberate movements to do it.

65
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,943
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm very, I'm excited, I'm one of the few people excited for Kinect for all, you know, for just the dashboard.

66
00:06:21,644 --> 00:06:24,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I actually go back a little bit and talk about the video chat real quick?

67
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:31,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, obviously the, not the iToy, the Xbox Vision that we had before, you know, kind of had the video chat.

68
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:35,711
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I realize this is way upgraded, you know, better quality, it can zoom in and out and all this stuff, but

69
00:06:36,344 --> 00:06:45,329
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I found about the video chat is that I rarely used it because it's kind of, you know, it's not like a cell phone where a cell phone's always on you and you pick it up, hit a button, you're good to go.

70
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:52,072
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I would think with a video chat, you both have to be on the 360 and then you have to, you know, kind of want to connect and so forth.

71
00:06:52,532 --> 00:06:53,452
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't know.

72
00:06:54,573 --> 00:06:57,795
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like I get iPhone video chat, you know, if they ever get it on 3G, but

73
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:07,388
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of sit here going, okay, that sounds cool, but am I ever really going to use Connect Video Chat except the one time to say I did?

74
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:09,690
[SPEAKER_02]: You might not.

75
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Families might.

76
00:07:11,071 --> 00:07:12,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Now realize it's not just 360 to 360.

77
00:07:13,193 --> 00:07:16,655
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be with Windows Live Messenger.

78
00:07:17,756 --> 00:07:19,938
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe they even said right at launch.

79
00:07:20,718 --> 00:07:27,483
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll be able to talk to somebody if they have Windows Live Messenger on their computer and a webcam, you will be able to talk to them.

80
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, now that's a big thing I wasn't considering before.

81
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:38,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see that now, then maybe like, you know, college kids trying to talk to parents or grandmas that are, you know, getting internet enabled in this day and age.

82
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,561
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes a lot more sense.

83
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:46,748
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also have Bing integrated with it where you could actually select... We're gonna wait for the plane.

84
00:07:47,388 --> 00:07:48,469
[SPEAKER_03]: The plane, the plane!

85
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,911
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go, there goes the plane.

86
00:07:50,877 --> 00:07:57,105
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually select top videos of entertainment stuff and you can both watch it at the same time.

87
00:07:57,145 --> 00:07:58,607
[SPEAKER_02]: They call them conversation starters.

88
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:07,298
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you don't know what to talk about, somebody can select this video and it pops up in the center and so you're on each side and you can talk about that video.

89
00:08:08,243 --> 00:08:13,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see it now, us doing an entire episode of Orange Lounge Radio just of the Bing topic selections.

90
00:08:13,864 --> 00:08:16,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, what an amazing podcast that would be.

91
00:08:16,544 --> 00:08:18,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the Bing video chat podcast.

92
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:20,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, you guys.

93
00:08:20,245 --> 00:08:20,865
[SPEAKER_03]: You know there's somebody.

94
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:21,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Patent pending.

95
00:08:22,345 --> 00:08:22,846
[SPEAKER_03]: It's mine.

96
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:23,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't take it.

97
00:08:24,606 --> 00:08:25,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I will sue you.

98
00:08:25,966 --> 00:08:26,786
[SPEAKER_02]: We could do it together.

99
00:08:27,066 --> 00:08:27,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, there you go.

100
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:28,947
[SPEAKER_02]: I could do it at my place.

101
00:08:28,987 --> 00:08:29,887
[SPEAKER_02]: You could do it at yours.

102
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:30,987
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll record.

103
00:08:31,027 --> 00:08:32,227
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the capture equipment.

104
00:08:32,427 --> 00:08:32,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

105
00:08:33,027 --> 00:08:34,488
[SPEAKER_02]: And we could make it a video podcast.

106
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:35,908
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

107
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:41,832
[SPEAKER_02]: One other game I played, which was actually a music-based game, Power Gig.

108
00:08:42,932 --> 00:08:43,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually played this.

109
00:08:44,893 --> 00:08:50,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this is the game, and somebody even asked me about it, I think, on my Sunday night show last week.

110
00:08:50,235 --> 00:08:51,395
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, what do you think of Power Gig?

111
00:08:51,415 --> 00:08:54,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh, if it teaches you how to play guitar, it'll be great.

112
00:08:54,456 --> 00:08:54,996
[SPEAKER_02]: This one doesn't.

113
00:08:57,017 --> 00:08:58,277
[SPEAKER_02]: It uses a real guitar.

114
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:04,159
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a real guitar, feels like a real guitar, but it's really still the same as Rock Band.

115
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:05,500
[SPEAKER_02]: And

116
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:08,758
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually, I didn't realize they had a drum peripheral.

117
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,719
[SPEAKER_02]: The drum peripheral is air drums.

118
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,861
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, and since this is your crowd I can say this and they'll get it, it's like Para Para Paradise.

119
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:27,584
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have drumsticks with sensors in them that break the plane of the pads, of the sensors shooting, or the lasers shooting up or whatever.

120
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:39,828
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically there's four floor sensors that I guess are sending lasers upwards and the drumstick is sensing them and that's how it does

121
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:41,980
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't play that way.

122
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I play...

123
00:10:06,837 --> 00:10:12,138
[SPEAKER_02]: For any music geeks out there, I play matched grip, like you would in marching band.

124
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:13,279
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I play drum sets.

125
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:16,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really do the thumb-up grip, which is called French grip.

126
00:10:17,099 --> 00:10:18,100
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I'm a nerd, band nerd.

127
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,981
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of drum set players do, so that's why they do it that way.

128
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:23,861
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to do it that way.

129
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:27,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if the sensor's not going down, it's not going to register.

130
00:10:28,122 --> 00:10:31,683
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was having a problem getting one of the pads, the hi-hat pad, to register at all.

131
00:10:32,587 --> 00:10:38,390
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't registering most of the time, so it was not a very fun experience, but they said it was still beta hardware, and it's not the final version.

132
00:10:39,351 --> 00:10:48,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I just say though, and kind of go back a little bit again, since you invoked the name Parapara, something that kind of occurred to me today on the floor, maybe last night after we taped, I don't know,

133
00:10:49,284 --> 00:10:59,830
[SPEAKER_03]: But I realize I'm kind of, this E3 is really making me eat a fat slice of humble pie because for years, literally years on this program, I've kind of sat here and said, just give up.

134
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Power of Paradise is never coming out in the U.S.

135
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:03,232
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're not going to get it.

136
00:11:03,572 --> 00:11:04,453
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not happening.

137
00:11:04,773 --> 00:11:05,994
[SPEAKER_03]: People aren't going to get it here.

138
00:11:06,134 --> 00:11:06,954
[SPEAKER_03]: So shut up already.

139
00:11:06,995 --> 00:11:08,135
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to come out here.

140
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:13,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy its cultness and the fact that it's a very niche thing.

141
00:11:13,238 --> 00:11:13,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Embrace it.

142
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun with it.

143
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:16,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Boy, did I get proved wrong.

144
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:24,749
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the most interesting thing to happen, but I swear, you guys, Dance Masters is, it's par par paradise.

145
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,532
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, if you do the Night of Fire thing, it's the same thing.

146
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:29,413
[SPEAKER_03]: They found a way to kind of get away with it here.

147
00:11:29,794 --> 00:11:36,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, granted, it's not exactly that, but that's as close, now, I will say this, and I will know I'm right.

148
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I will know I'm right.

149
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:40,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Take it or leave it, because this is the closest you're ever going to get.

150
00:11:41,194 --> 00:11:44,858
[SPEAKER_03]: For those that are Paradise fans, which I know we have some of those in the show.

151
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:50,723
[SPEAKER_03]: As years old as that is, the camera thing will be pretty cool, I think.

152
00:11:50,803 --> 00:11:57,129
[SPEAKER_03]: The game itself looks neat, but a very interesting head-to-head that's going to happen with the Harmonix game, too.

153
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I don't mean to go back to old topics, but anything else you want to talk about, Bobby?

154
00:12:02,168 --> 00:12:02,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think.

155
00:12:03,408 --> 00:12:06,229
[SPEAKER_02]: I did get to play Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

156
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:15,211
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really going to talk that much about the game because I only played it once or twice and it was button mashing and I lost.

157
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:19,932
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost to Justin, the editor, the other guy that does E3 coverage.

158
00:12:20,812 --> 00:12:22,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I beat him in dancing though, so I'm a better dancer.

159
00:12:23,573 --> 00:12:34,020
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will say that in the interview with E3Coverage.com that I did, I did invoke Curly Mustaches and Pringles and the Knicks.

160
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,183
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a fan, I invoke all of those in that interview.

161
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:51,071
[SPEAKER_02]: And I played Wii Party, because it was a short line, and played the board game, which is kind of like Mario Party without the coins.

162
00:12:52,049 --> 00:12:53,170
[SPEAKER_02]: and played that for a little bit.

163
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,071
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was kind of interesting.

164
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:57,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the minigames are to determine the role order.

165
00:12:57,732 --> 00:12:59,913
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just one of the many things in Wii Party.

166
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:02,395
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be... I'm going to rent it, at least.

167
00:13:04,236 --> 00:13:08,758
[SPEAKER_02]: And, let's see, now I'm just stalling because I'm trying to think if there was anything else that I saw.

168
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:10,799
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

169
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:12,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Portal 2, hilarious.

170
00:13:13,381 --> 00:13:16,222
[SPEAKER_02]: OnLive, I didn't realize that OnLive is live now.

171
00:13:16,983 --> 00:13:18,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it went live probably about an hour ago.

172
00:13:18,844 --> 00:13:19,344
[SPEAKER_02]: 6 p.m.

173
00:13:19,364 --> 00:13:21,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Pacific is when they said it's going live for everybody.

174
00:13:22,057 --> 00:13:27,242
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think if you're a founding member you get one year free of OnLive for the PC and it worked on the show floor.

175
00:13:27,823 --> 00:13:31,086
[SPEAKER_02]: They claimed that the server was up in Silicon Valley.

176
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:38,834
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I believe them but if it's free for a year I might as well I might check it out and see it on my own home connection.

177
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:43,959
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to be huge for Mac gamers which I know is kind of an oxymoron but

178
00:13:44,426 --> 00:13:45,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding, guys.

179
00:13:45,827 --> 00:13:51,350
[SPEAKER_03]: The MacGamers, I mean, getting to kind of do all this streaming, this is going to open up a huge door, I think.

180
00:13:51,951 --> 00:13:54,292
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think that's where OnLive is going to be most successful.

181
00:13:54,312 --> 00:13:59,456
[SPEAKER_03]: But just watching it on the floor, you know, I didn't get the extensive demo you did, but I was like, is this for real?

182
00:13:59,476 --> 00:14:02,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it does look pretty smooth and pretty nice.

183
00:14:02,978 --> 00:14:09,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's kind of one of those things that you know on the show floor, everybody's putting on their nicest, you know, front.

184
00:14:09,062 --> 00:14:12,764
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of wouldn't mind trying it on my home computer and see if it runs as well.

185
00:14:13,493 --> 00:14:17,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Bobby, I know we're going to wrap up, get you to your flight and all that stuff.

186
00:14:17,574 --> 00:14:24,856
[SPEAKER_03]: And if people want to hear more, they can tune into you, you know, your Sunday night show or the one I always forget to plug because, you know, we're not on right after it, but it's also a great show.

187
00:14:25,476 --> 00:14:30,258
[SPEAKER_03]: The effing show, the fnglive.net, which is a video show that you guys do.

188
00:14:30,318 --> 00:14:35,579
[SPEAKER_03]: You're actually doing one Friday night, which really by the time most people hear this, knowing what time I'm getting home tonight, I'll probably be

189
00:14:35,979 --> 00:14:37,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably be tonight by the time most people hear this.

190
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:43,203
[SPEAKER_03]: So tune into that as well at, I believe, 5 Pacific, 8 Eastern once again.

191
00:14:43,303 --> 00:14:44,424
[SPEAKER_03]: So check that out.

192
00:14:44,804 --> 00:14:46,525
[SPEAKER_03]: One last question for Bobby, though.

193
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:51,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of the thing that surprised you most about... And you've been to a lot of E3s.

194
00:14:51,287 --> 00:14:53,369
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been to about three times as many of them as I have.

195
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:56,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Thing that surprised you most about E3 2010, Bobby?

196
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God, you're putting me on the spot here.

197
00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:11,774
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of hard to say because I didn't see all that much because of the appointments and stuff.

198
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:15,156
[SPEAKER_02]: With Microsoft, it was all interviews.

199
00:15:15,276 --> 00:15:17,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I never touched a game in the Microsoft booth.

200
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:26,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe what surprised me had nothing to do with anything on the show floor, although the game that shocked me was Driver San Francisco.

201
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,441
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize that would be that good.

202
00:15:29,505 --> 00:15:32,548
[SPEAKER_02]: But that could also be a good demo just like Split Second.

203
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:43,757
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's more that I need to find a way to balance appointments and then having free time to go roam.

204
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:49,861
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally only had about two and a half hours the entire week that didn't have appointments that I could actually roam the show floor.

205
00:15:49,981 --> 00:15:50,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Fourth day!

206
00:15:51,082 --> 00:15:51,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

207
00:15:52,043 --> 00:15:53,124
[SPEAKER_02]: I could use a fourth day.

208
00:15:53,184 --> 00:15:57,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I know everybody that works E3 is like, Oh God, no, I don't want a fourth day.

209
00:15:58,007 --> 00:16:01,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, but everybody could fill up a fourth day of appointments too.

210
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:05,734
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's too short.

211
00:16:06,195 --> 00:16:14,782
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I wasn't media and I was just showing up as exhibits only attendee as a developer, I was usually bored by the middle of day two.

212
00:16:15,603 --> 00:16:20,047
[SPEAKER_02]: And I finish up, Rock Band was my last thing that I saw.

213
00:16:20,868 --> 00:16:22,209
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like,

214
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:23,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I could go another day.

215
00:16:24,003 --> 00:16:24,804
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not done yet.

216
00:16:25,544 --> 00:16:34,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's going to be something I'm going to miss, and I'm going to kick myself for missing it, like Civ V. But yeah, I need more time.

217
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:36,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was the surprise, is that I need more time.

218
00:16:37,717 --> 00:16:38,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, good answer.

219
00:16:38,758 --> 00:16:40,039
[SPEAKER_03]: I was totally putting you on the spot.

220
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:40,740
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a good answer.

221
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,003
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you so much, Bobby, and we'll talk as always on Sunday night.

222
00:16:45,184 --> 00:16:55,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, of course, Shane and I are still going to talk some games too, but we're going to go drop Bobby off at the airport, so we'll just do a little break here in the podcast-a-roo, and we'll be back sometime after the grapevine on I-5.

223
00:16:55,755 --> 00:16:56,856
[SPEAKER_03]: So stay tuned.

224
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:01,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we're back for the second half, although I'm kind of a terrible liar.

225
00:17:01,673 --> 00:17:28,879
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's almost 24 hours after we did that first half but we decided doing a podcast while trying to drive probably wasn't the best of ideas as boring as i5 is so yeah we took the safe route and came home and then of course we were really tired and that's stuff we want to do today but we still wanted to at least wrap up some of the stuff we saw on E3 day three while it's still fresh in our minds although I find that I'm on like game overload I played so much and I've been playing games since I got home because

226
00:17:29,266 --> 00:17:34,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Shane's like, you gotta play Alan Wake, and I have been, and it's been scary and all that, but I'll talk more about that on Sunday's show.

227
00:17:35,248 --> 00:17:48,953
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, while Shane is still here in California, we want to at least kind of go through some of the games we saw at E3 Day 3, and then of course we'll resume, you know, with all the rest of the news on Sunday night's show.

228
00:17:49,393 --> 00:17:55,915
[SPEAKER_03]: So, say hello to Shane, everybody, who's back with us here on this Rob Robertson Pals Thursday, kind of Friday edition.

229
00:17:56,812 --> 00:18:06,398
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually been over 24 hours since we were supposed to do it because it's now almost 11 here and we stopped at like 7 yesterday, but hi.

230
00:18:07,939 --> 00:18:11,182
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, through the magic of radio, people would have never known, but that's alright.

231
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:12,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright Shane, let's get to the games.

232
00:18:13,203 --> 00:18:14,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us some games that you want to talk about.

233
00:18:15,683 --> 00:18:19,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I actually wrote these all down in a random order, so I'll go in a random order.

234
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,026
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I won't.

235
00:18:21,286 --> 00:18:22,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Castlevania Lords of Shadow.

236
00:18:22,887 --> 00:18:26,869
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the new Castlevania game coming out for the 360 and the PS3.

237
00:18:27,969 --> 00:18:31,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much a God of War style game.

238
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:48,557
[SPEAKER_01]: The demo definitely made me want to play more of it because it had some interesting features like there's a part where you're on mounted combat and when you get knocked off because I'm terrible at it you have to fight through enemies before your little sparkle horse comes back so you can start riding again.

239
00:18:49,517 --> 00:18:50,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Very graphically pretty.

240
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:53,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of reminded me of like looking at a painting.

241
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:57,300
[SPEAKER_01]: So had some slowdown issues but it's okay I liked it.

242
00:18:58,311 --> 00:19:05,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm hoping some of the framerate issues was just because it's still a beta and some of these things are really hard to judge from early demo builds.

243
00:19:05,192 --> 00:19:20,776
[SPEAKER_03]: But the only thing that kind of got me about the game was that I think a lot of people who weren't happy with the direction Castlevania took in the PS1 and PS2 versions are going to be really disappointed

244
00:19:21,801 --> 00:19:25,308
[SPEAKER_03]: I think by what they're doing here because it didn't really feel like a Castlevania game to me.

245
00:19:25,648 --> 00:19:34,485
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, if I remember right, I read somewhere that this game originally started as a totally different game and then they kind of, I guess, retconned the Castlevania thing into it.

246
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:37,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, it was not a bad game by any means.

247
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:53,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually thought it was really cool and pretty and enjoyable, but I think some people that were expecting the old-style, you know, whipping Castlevania games are going to be in for a surprise, because Shane's right, it plays a lot more like God of War, kind of Bayonetta, it felt like a little bit to me, too, with some of the cutscenes.

248
00:19:53,576 --> 00:19:57,937
[SPEAKER_03]: But, again, very pretty, and I still think probably going to be worth your time checking out when it comes out.

249
00:19:58,937 --> 00:20:03,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if you do want kind of that old-school 2D experience, I got a little time with the arcade version

250
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:15,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Game, which is the Harmony of Despair Castlevania game, which I think we had talked about a little bit the day before, but I actually hands-on played it on the last day of E3, and I enjoyed it.

251
00:20:15,574 --> 00:20:22,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Shane, I don't think felt so favorably about it, but I kind of like the whole Neo Geo effect of the zoom in and out.

252
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:29,204
[SPEAKER_03]: If you ever played the fighting games on the OGO, how it kind of like zooms way in and out and stuff on the action, you can kind of control that in the Castlevania game.

253
00:20:29,725 --> 00:20:33,046
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was very inspired by Symphony of the Night, which I thought was cool.

254
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,408
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's basically a race from start to finish.

255
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,809
[SPEAKER_03]: You have like 10 minutes to kind of get through the castle.

256
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:43,272
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know the demo castle I played was kind of hard because it seemed like there really was only one path through the castle.

257
00:20:43,712 --> 00:20:44,614
[SPEAKER_03]: but I couldn't figure it out.

258
00:20:45,114 --> 00:20:50,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately the demo on the floor didn't give a lot of exposition as to what all the features were and the people at least where I was at.

259
00:20:50,963 --> 00:20:59,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I played it at Microsoft's booth and I don't think the people there were as on the up and up on what the game was all about so unfortunately

260
00:20:59,768 --> 00:21:02,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a little bit kind of like lost, I guess, as to all the features.

261
00:21:02,831 --> 00:21:04,752
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I enjoyed what I played.

262
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:09,195
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'm pretty sure the arcade game will probably cost $10, maybe $15.

263
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:11,197
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll probably be worth it.

264
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:13,479
[SPEAKER_03]: I will probably pay and at least check out the full version.

265
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:15,580
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, at least the trial, for heaven's sake.

266
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Fable 3 was another game I checked out at Microsoft's booth.

267
00:21:19,683 --> 00:21:22,886
[SPEAKER_03]: And Fable 3, again, the demo...

268
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:29,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't really give you a lot, at least for me, of what is really different about the game from Fable 2.

269
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:34,943
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed a lot of the gold trail was kind of back from the other Fable games.

270
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:39,465
[SPEAKER_03]: And the difference I saw was that you could dress up in a giant chicken suit for one of the quests.

271
00:21:40,806 --> 00:21:43,226
[SPEAKER_03]: But they weren't running it on Kinect or whatever.

272
00:21:43,246 --> 00:21:46,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, right, Fable 3 is supposed to have some Kinect stuff, supposedly.

273
00:21:46,828 --> 00:21:48,849
[SPEAKER_03]: But they weren't really showing any of that on the floor.

274
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:49,829
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got to be honest.

275
00:21:50,433 --> 00:22:13,685
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see a whole lot that was really different from Fable 2, and most of the people I talked to, same thing, but, I mean, that's not really a bad thing, Fable 2 was a great game, it was one of the better games that came out that year it came out, so, more of the same in this case, not necessarily a bad thing, and I'm sure there's some other stuff, like, you know, it seemed to be like there was a couple more interactions and things you could choose from, so, I mean, that part of it's cool, so...

276
00:22:14,107 --> 00:22:15,588
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty much my impressions of Fable 3.

277
00:22:16,249 --> 00:22:17,670
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll check that out when it comes out too.

278
00:22:18,931 --> 00:22:23,074
[SPEAKER_01]: So while Rob was playing Fable 3, I was just around the corner playing Crackdown 2.

279
00:22:24,155 --> 00:22:25,677
[SPEAKER_01]: And seriously, it was just Crackdown.

280
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:26,918
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all it was.

281
00:22:27,478 --> 00:22:33,583
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a 30 minute demo, which I actually didn't spend the whole 30 minutes playing, but I definitely could have easily.

282
00:22:33,963 --> 00:22:34,684
[SPEAKER_01]: It was still fun.

283
00:22:35,117 --> 00:22:36,017
[SPEAKER_01]: It was hilarious.

284
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:40,278
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were agility orbs, and that's all you need in a Crackdown game.

285
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:50,381
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't play a whole lot of the first game, so this might be a new feature, but you can capture points and then call helicopters down to give you more weapons.

286
00:22:51,141 --> 00:22:54,362
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more proficient you are with guns, the better weapons you get.

287
00:22:55,077 --> 00:22:59,801
[SPEAKER_01]: So it actually really made me want to get one of those sleek new 360s.

288
00:23:01,382 --> 00:23:05,225
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was happy with it, and I guess it comes out in a couple months, or next month.

289
00:23:06,106 --> 00:23:07,287
[SPEAKER_03]: What's wrong with the old 360s?

290
00:23:07,307 --> 00:23:08,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't you just get one of the old 360s?

291
00:23:09,761 --> 00:23:11,002
[SPEAKER_01]: They aren't the shiny new ones.

292
00:23:11,702 --> 00:23:19,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, I would like to have a wireless adapter and this one's built in instead of paying an extra hundred dollars.

293
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,188
[SPEAKER_01]: Dollars?

294
00:23:20,588 --> 00:23:21,009
[SPEAKER_01]: Dollars.

295
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:25,271
[SPEAKER_03]: So in other words, what they really should have had the first time.

296
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:30,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and if it breaks it can't red ring technically because there are no red lights inside.

297
00:23:31,135 --> 00:23:33,557
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it breaks it's going to be three green rings of death.

298
00:23:35,442 --> 00:23:38,304
[SPEAKER_03]: or hopefully they've just built it this time so it doesn't break.

299
00:23:38,364 --> 00:23:39,746
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's another issue altogether.

300
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:40,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm digressing a little bit.

301
00:23:41,247 --> 00:23:43,328
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is next on our list?

302
00:23:43,368 --> 00:23:44,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

303
00:23:46,211 --> 00:23:47,652
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the demo was limited.

304
00:23:47,672 --> 00:23:49,553
[SPEAKER_03]: It only had about, what, 8, 10 characters?

305
00:23:49,613 --> 00:23:50,134
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

306
00:23:50,974 --> 00:23:52,255
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I guess that's still a lot.

307
00:23:52,476 --> 00:23:55,958
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 characters was as many as they had in the original Street Fighter, right?

308
00:23:55,998 --> 00:23:56,999
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the original Street Fighter was just 8.

309
00:23:57,099 --> 00:23:57,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

310
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

311
00:23:59,033 --> 00:23:59,593
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cool.

312
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:04,834
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very stylistic, you know, as a lot of you guys have seen in the trailers.

313
00:24:04,914 --> 00:24:07,355
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it plays just like Marvel vs. Capcom 2.

314
00:24:07,675 --> 00:24:12,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind, I'm not on my up and up on fighting games, so I'm not the best authority to talk about these types of games.

315
00:24:12,776 --> 00:24:19,097
[SPEAKER_03]: But to me, it played a lot like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, but definitely had that more like kind of like Cell style that you've seen in a lot of the commercials.

316
00:24:19,577 --> 00:24:28,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Not as much of the 2D, 3D switching as I would have thought based on the trailer and the fact that it kind of was supposed to be a little more Street Fighter 4, I thought.

317
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:36,223
[SPEAKER_03]: So, graphically, you know, it's kind of like a souped-up arcade release, but I think it's going to be pleasing for the fans.

318
00:24:36,303 --> 00:24:46,087
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the supers do the 3D thing a little bit, at least it was in the demo, but again, early, early, early build, and then had huge lines going for it all day at the Capcom booth.

319
00:24:46,888 --> 00:24:53,631
[SPEAKER_03]: The trick to getting to play the game quickly was to go to Microsoft's booth, or even Sony's booth, and play the game there, which is what we did.

320
00:24:54,949 --> 00:24:55,670
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked it.

321
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,713
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a huge fan of the Marvel vs. Capcom games.

322
00:24:58,773 --> 00:25:00,935
[SPEAKER_01]: I already like Capcom vs. SNK.

323
00:25:01,535 --> 00:25:13,887
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one thing I noticed about it is because of the size of the characters and the screen amount that you have to play in, it felt like the game was going a little too fast compared to the other ones.

324
00:25:14,588 --> 00:25:17,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it was kind of hard to keep up with what was going on.

325
00:25:17,931 --> 00:25:27,018
[SPEAKER_01]: and as a button masher because I don't know how to play Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and I picked, I think, all new characters except for Iron Man.

326
00:25:27,178 --> 00:25:28,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris Redfield sucks.

327
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, utterly, utterly terrible character.

328
00:25:32,942 --> 00:25:35,004
[SPEAKER_01]: Slow and just awful.

329
00:25:35,064 --> 00:25:36,525
[SPEAKER_01]: But Dante was really cool.

330
00:25:36,705 --> 00:25:40,288
[SPEAKER_01]: I will definitely, when I play this game, will be playing as Dante.

331
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:42,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

332
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I pretty much played with standard characters.

333
00:25:45,271 --> 00:25:46,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Felicia, Morgan...

334
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:47,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Ryu, all that fun stuff.

335
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:52,788
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so I finally made good on my promise to get some hands-on with the PlayStation Move.

336
00:25:53,268 --> 00:25:56,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, the line to get to all the really good games was really long.

337
00:25:57,709 --> 00:26:04,791
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of the like littler games that didn't have quite the, you know, like the bowling game and some other stuff didn't have quite the long lines to get to them.

338
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:09,271
[SPEAKER_03]: So the game I got to play was the Toy Story game, which, you know, it's not a bad game.

339
00:26:09,311 --> 00:26:10,632
[SPEAKER_03]: There's certainly an audience for it.

340
00:26:10,672 --> 00:26:12,252
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely directed at a younger audience.

341
00:26:12,665 --> 00:26:13,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

342
00:26:26,023 --> 00:26:28,264
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's more of a point the move at the screen.

343
00:26:28,284 --> 00:26:29,845
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't even use the second controller.

344
00:26:29,885 --> 00:26:32,747
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the one stick and you just kind of aim it at the screen and shoot.

345
00:26:33,207 --> 00:26:34,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Very logical.

346
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:36,929
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, I was able to at least kind of get my hands on it.

347
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:39,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the way that controller kind of felt to hold.

348
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,452
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a little weird with the whole like lollipop look that it has.

349
00:26:44,028 --> 00:26:49,954
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of funny because when you shoot a certain square in the Toy Story game, it'll activate rapid fire.

350
00:26:49,974 --> 00:26:53,237
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just hold down the button to shoot the balls everywhere at the targets.

351
00:26:53,657 --> 00:26:58,382
[SPEAKER_03]: But your little ball on the top of your controller starts spazzing out and turning all these rainbow colors.

352
00:26:58,422 --> 00:26:58,982
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all pretty.

353
00:26:59,503 --> 00:27:02,946
[SPEAKER_03]: So kids will get a kick out of it if you have one of those households where

354
00:27:03,396 --> 00:27:31,487
[SPEAKER_03]: you know mom and dad really like to play their more hardcore PlayStation games but you want some stuff for the kids too I think that's going to fit in very nicely with the collection or if you're you know a Disney nut or you really like Midway Mania it was it was cute although I didn't I gotta be honest I was talking to the demo guy about a bunch of like other things besides just the game so I couldn't tell you like how extensive the game's gonna be but you know what it's it's a Toy Story game it's you know what you're gonna get

355
00:27:33,406 --> 00:27:42,353
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, when I got to play The Move, I went to a more, I don't know, real game, and I ended up playing Time Crisis, the new one.

356
00:27:42,373 --> 00:27:43,714
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember the subtitle.

357
00:27:44,354 --> 00:27:44,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh well.

358
00:27:45,936 --> 00:27:46,496
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.

359
00:27:46,836 --> 00:27:49,098
[SPEAKER_01]: The Move controller works really well for Time Crisis.

360
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,200
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very, very quick game.

361
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,241
[SPEAKER_01]: in response time when you move it around.

362
00:27:53,641 --> 00:27:55,382
[SPEAKER_01]: I was getting headshots left and right.

363
00:27:56,243 --> 00:27:57,323
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no problems playing it.

364
00:27:57,604 --> 00:28:03,147
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I kind of played, I guess you could consider it twice, because I played with two different people next to me.

365
00:28:03,187 --> 00:28:04,007
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't want to leave.

366
00:28:04,688 --> 00:28:07,909
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always totally outdid the other people.

367
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:20,777
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did talk to the rep that was there, and he told me that the game is not only going to have the on-rails shooter like we all know from Time Crisis, but it will also have one part of the game where you can just move around and shoot things too.

368
00:28:21,317 --> 00:28:23,778
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not stuck to those rails.

369
00:28:24,118 --> 00:28:31,359
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, he informed me that the retail copy will come with a move-enhanced version of Time Crisis 4.

370
00:28:32,139 --> 00:28:34,160
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of get three games in one.

371
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is great, because Time Crisis 4, if it's free, it's good.

372
00:28:39,381 --> 00:28:41,401
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a terrible, terrible Time Crisis game.

373
00:28:41,461 --> 00:28:43,642
[SPEAKER_01]: But this new one is really fun, so I'm excited.

374
00:28:45,323 --> 00:29:02,512
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the cool things real quick about it was that the button on the top of the controller acted like your foot pedal in the arcade so you would release it when you want to reload and keep your shield up and then you would hold it down and then press the trigger button on the underside of the controller when you'd want to fire.

375
00:29:04,073 --> 00:29:07,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Now if you take Time Crisis off the rails though, is it still really Time Crisis?

376
00:29:08,869 --> 00:29:37,550
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know I can't see me playing that off the rails section of the game that much because it did sound like they were two completely separate parts of the game like you can just play the rails game or you can play the free roaming one I don't know how the free roaming one will work and it'll require for sure at least the what the Sony nunchuck whatever it's called to move around because I don't think you can really move around with just the move controller

377
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:41,550
[SPEAKER_03]: The Navigation Controller, if I'm not mistaken, is what they call it.

378
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:53,213
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to call it the, I think it was like Balancing Rock from WarioWare, Smooth Moose, because those little intro things are hilarious.

379
00:29:54,974 --> 00:29:56,054
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the microphone back.

380
00:29:56,854 --> 00:30:01,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so we went over to Nintendo's booth for a little bit and caught up on some of the stuff besides the 3DS.

381
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:08,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Although we did spend a heck of a lot of time with the 3DS again, which I'll let Shane start in a minute, but I do want to talk about the other games we got our hands on real quick.

382
00:30:09,231 --> 00:30:17,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the stuff we've been kind of teasing on the Sunday show a little bit, Wii Party, which I know Loki was kind of making fun of because, oh my gosh, another minigame collection on the Wii.

383
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:18,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Who would have thought?

384
00:30:18,754 --> 00:30:24,156
[SPEAKER_03]: But this appears to be probably one of the bigger Wii titles they're going to push this holiday, at least for the family unit.

385
00:30:24,596 --> 00:30:30,898
[SPEAKER_03]: And it did seem like there were tons of minigames, but not necessarily like the same stuff you would see in other games.

386
00:30:30,978 --> 00:30:32,138
[SPEAKER_03]: It seemed like you would have these

387
00:30:33,024 --> 00:30:34,165
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

388
00:31:03,376 --> 00:31:07,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not my fault you're terrible at Wii Party and you don't take direction well.

389
00:31:07,897 --> 00:31:13,719
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, we were playing this thing where there was a boat and you didn't want to tip the boat over.

390
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:18,700
[SPEAKER_03]: But you had to play little mini-games to get the people that you would put on the boat.

391
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,261
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you passed the mini-game, they would be the same weight.

392
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:24,482
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you didn't pass the mini-game, they would be fat and skinny.

393
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:25,752
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's bad.

394
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:26,413
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want that.

395
00:31:27,293 --> 00:31:30,094
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's really funny when the boat tips over and everybody falls in.

396
00:31:30,134 --> 00:31:31,095
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my favorite part.

397
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,435
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was almost like worth it to lose miserably.

398
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:34,836
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was Wii Party.

399
00:31:35,216 --> 00:31:35,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be honest.

400
00:31:35,996 --> 00:31:41,679
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if this is one I would necessarily buy because I don't have a lot of parties at my one bedroom apartment.

401
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:54,524
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think for the people, if you are getting a lot of use out of Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort and the other major Nintendo releases for party games, this is kind of a next logical step that I'm sure will end up in a lot of households.

402
00:31:57,241 --> 00:31:58,922
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked Wii Party a whole lot.

403
00:31:59,162 --> 00:32:07,505
[SPEAKER_01]: My only thing about it is if they try to charge $50 for it and not throw in like an extra controller or something, it's not worth it.

404
00:32:08,205 --> 00:32:12,967
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really fun, but like $25 fun.

405
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:15,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing higher than that.

406
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:23,511
[SPEAKER_01]: But after we moved on from Wii Party, we went to the Mario Sports Mix game, which was interestingly enough on the tile screen showed that it was

407
00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:28,012
[SPEAKER_01]: in part developed by Square Enix, so what the crap.

408
00:32:29,312 --> 00:32:33,613
[SPEAKER_01]: It had volleyball and basketball on it, and we played volleyball, and Rob was terrible.

409
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:39,414
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was really good because I got us some points, and I was very good at blocking the shots from coming over.

410
00:32:39,894 --> 00:32:40,374
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun.

411
00:32:40,554 --> 00:32:41,874
[SPEAKER_01]: The volleyball was a blast.

412
00:32:41,894 --> 00:32:49,336
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of wish we had demoed the basketball too, but the volleyball had really simple controls, and it was a good time.

413
00:32:50,994 --> 00:32:57,098
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unfortunate that Shane would lie like that and say that I'm so terrible when I was the only one running around grabbing all the power-ups, but that's okay.

414
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:01,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing though, I gotta be honest, the game was almost a little too simple for me.

415
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:08,406
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really a kid's game, and you know, it's fine for that audience, but you know, I think for the rest of us,

416
00:33:09,432 --> 00:33:13,134
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people are just going to see it as like, woo, more of the Wii Sports type of stuff.

417
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:21,039
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, again, if you have that mixed household that has the kids and the teenagers maybe even that would get a kick out of this, it would probably be worth it.

418
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:27,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Before the quote-unquote hardcore gamer, which is probably most of the folks that listen to this show, I couldn't really take Mario Sports Mix seriously.

419
00:33:28,144 --> 00:33:37,830
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they try to incorporate some of the Mario elements into it, like the red shells, you know, and cute little things like that, but I couldn't take it seriously.

420
00:33:40,402 --> 00:33:44,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I think is unfortunate because I think it'd be a good relaxing game.

421
00:33:45,384 --> 00:33:51,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, not a $50 game, which they will charge for it, but a pretty good one just to kind of hang out and do nothing.

422
00:33:52,266 --> 00:33:58,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if I want to play a relaxing game, I'll just play Wii Relax, which was totally absent from E3 this year.

423
00:33:58,248 --> 00:33:58,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Who would have thought?

424
00:33:59,881 --> 00:34:10,690
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like Nintendo knew to keep Cammy Dunaway and the Wii Vitality Sensor away from E3 so nobody would get mad at them, which is great.

425
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:17,996
[SPEAKER_01]: But moving on to the most important part of the show, I think, we went back through the 3DS line.

426
00:34:18,636 --> 00:34:27,082
[SPEAKER_01]: which was fantastic to actually get to go back through and really spend some quality time with some of the games, demos, and videos.

427
00:34:28,563 --> 00:34:35,068
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that they had a DJ Hero game on there, which I didn't even really realize.

428
00:34:35,128 --> 00:34:39,231
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they had mentioned it before, but I didn't know it was up there to play.

429
00:34:39,732 --> 00:34:41,273
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so pumped when I saw it.

430
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:43,795
[SPEAKER_01]: I hopped right over, and it is an amazing game.

431
00:34:44,575 --> 00:34:47,177
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the bottom screen, the touchscreen.

432
00:34:48,078 --> 00:34:53,841
[SPEAKER_01]: You have three tracks still, but you only have the little note circles in the middle.

433
00:34:53,921 --> 00:34:55,923
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just tap the screen wherever you want for that.

434
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:57,184
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to slide...

435
00:34:58,288 --> 00:34:59,730
[SPEAKER_01]: You are a crossfader to the left or right.

436
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,252
[SPEAKER_01]: You slide the stylus on the screen.

437
00:35:01,832 --> 00:35:02,834
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really good.

438
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:10,583
[SPEAKER_01]: And the 3D effects made it kind of neat to see the track, so to speak, come at you as you're playing.

439
00:35:12,526 --> 00:35:14,368
[SPEAKER_01]: And you played the DJ Hero, didn't you?

440
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:17,894
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, he's shaking his head, so I guess I won't have the mic back over.

441
00:35:20,177 --> 00:35:22,701
[SPEAKER_01]: I also played the Professor Layton game.

442
00:35:22,881 --> 00:35:26,866
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like Mirror of Something working title, so whatever.

443
00:35:27,207 --> 00:35:29,049
[SPEAKER_01]: Professor Layton 3DS, there we go.

444
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,010
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cool.

445
00:35:31,391 --> 00:35:44,394
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Professor Layton, but instead of the typical static screen where you touch things to find clues, you have a 3D screen on top and you can use this magnifying glass on the bottom screen.

446
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:52,957
[SPEAKER_01]: You move it around and your magnifying glass will change into an orange filled magnifying glass if you find something to technically click on.

447
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:54,919
[SPEAKER_01]: That was cool.

448
00:35:56,081 --> 00:36:04,331
[SPEAKER_01]: The puzzle that you got while playing was just the standard Professor Layton puzzle.

449
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:05,653
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to put a robot together.

450
00:36:06,994 --> 00:36:08,116
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't anything big.

451
00:36:08,676 --> 00:36:10,058
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't really use the 3D.

452
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:14,180
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was okay, because it was still really fun in Professor Layton.

453
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,840
[SPEAKER_01]: I also played Pilotwings.

454
00:36:17,961 --> 00:36:19,721
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a short demo.

455
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:22,001
[SPEAKER_01]: I flew a plane through some rings.

456
00:36:22,782 --> 00:36:30,183
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of felt like Wii Sports Resort, more so than Pilotwings, but that's what they've been making recently.

457
00:36:30,263 --> 00:36:31,083
[SPEAKER_01]: So, hey, here's Rob.

458
00:36:31,843 --> 00:36:33,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I ran to the other room real quick.

459
00:36:33,404 --> 00:36:35,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I comment real quick, though, on Professor Layton?

460
00:36:35,544 --> 00:36:36,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I also checked this out.

461
00:36:36,685 --> 00:36:38,305
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't play the Professor Layton games, though.

462
00:36:38,725 --> 00:36:38,885
[SPEAKER_03]: It was...

463
00:36:39,692 --> 00:36:55,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me explain though, when you were up there demoing the 3DS, it was just a lot, probably all those women you saw at the press conference were now sitting up on the 3DS stage where you would go up there and they all had DSs tied to them, but the only kind of like problem was there were no signs saying what game was where.

464
00:36:56,415 --> 00:37:04,337
[SPEAKER_03]: So you kind of would just walk up to women and see what game they had, you know, which, you know, it's hard to kind of walk away too once you kind of get sucked into a game.

465
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:09,078
[SPEAKER_03]: So I checked out Professor Layton even though I don't know the DS games at all like Shane does.

466
00:37:09,398 --> 00:37:15,323
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will say the one thing I noticed was that the 3D effects were probably the most sharp of almost anything that I demoed.

467
00:37:16,363 --> 00:37:25,250
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, my 3D can sometimes be really picky, but I thought Layton had probably some of the best 3D that I saw.

468
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:31,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though it wasn't like gimmicky 3D, like pop-out things shooting at you, I thought it was just kind of some of the sharpest 3D.

469
00:37:33,328 --> 00:37:39,330
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the art style of Professor Layton really is a good match for the way they did the 3D.

470
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:43,512
[SPEAKER_01]: It was almost like a pop-up book, so to speak.

471
00:37:44,632 --> 00:37:48,794
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was saying, yeah, Pilotwings, it's just kind of Wii Sports Resort.

472
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:49,274
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun.

473
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I played Ridge Racer.

474
00:37:52,815 --> 00:37:53,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't really care for it.

475
00:37:53,796 --> 00:37:56,477
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the first handheld Ridge Racer I did not like.

476
00:37:57,257 --> 00:37:59,038
[SPEAKER_01]: But you played some of Ridge Racer, didn't you?

477
00:38:00,009 --> 00:38:05,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, the controls were kind of dopey, like, and just it was not realistic at all when you would run into walls.

478
00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:12,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying not to be too harsh, though, because, you know, early, early, early, I think it's more of a concept than anything like the actual game.

479
00:38:12,964 --> 00:38:13,484
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

480
00:38:43,553 --> 00:38:48,736
[SPEAKER_03]: I really, really think it's unfair to judge a whole game based off these very, very conceptual demos.

481
00:38:49,256 --> 00:38:52,557
[SPEAKER_03]: This just wasn't one that made me jump up and down like some of the other concept demos did.

482
00:38:53,818 --> 00:39:01,862
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say we have to say maybe conceptual demos because we don't know when these games are coming out and some of them actually felt pretty polished for demos.

483
00:39:03,567 --> 00:39:04,348
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's true.

484
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:12,095
[SPEAKER_03]: If this is the game, though, I would totally pass on it until the Mario Kart game comes out, as far as I'm concerned.

485
00:39:13,176 --> 00:39:17,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, one of the games I checked out was Kingdom Hearts, although it was not really a game.

486
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:21,564
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just kind of a concept thing where you would watch pre-rendered video.

487
00:39:22,324 --> 00:39:26,028
[SPEAKER_03]: So really all I can say about it was that it was kind of like watching the opening on the PS2.

488
00:39:26,288 --> 00:39:26,829
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was...

489
00:39:28,001 --> 00:39:35,584
[SPEAKER_03]: The 3D was, you know, there wasn't a lot going on, but I was more impressed that, wow, this is like PlayStation 2 style graphics on the DS.

490
00:39:35,685 --> 00:39:40,387
[SPEAKER_03]: That was, you know, not quite at that caliber, but almost.

491
00:39:40,467 --> 00:39:43,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely a step above where it was at before, so that was pretty awesome.

492
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:49,851
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the other games I played that I think Shane didn't was Samurai Warriors, which was like half video, half playable demo.

493
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,128
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was cool.

494
00:39:52,168 --> 00:39:53,709
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the playable demo was very simple.

495
00:39:53,749 --> 00:39:56,070
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just kill 50 warriors really quick.

496
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:58,131
[SPEAKER_03]: But the 3D was, they used a lot of it.

497
00:39:58,651 --> 00:40:07,175
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, not just the depth and running around killing the warriors, but then like, you know, little anime overlays would come up when you do special moves and those kind of pop out.

498
00:40:07,255 --> 00:40:08,276
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought that was pretty cool.

499
00:40:10,785 --> 00:40:15,286
[SPEAKER_01]: and a game I know I played that Rob didn't was Nintendogs plus cats.

500
00:40:16,607 --> 00:40:20,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately they didn't have the cats but they did have a couple breeds of dogs.

501
00:40:20,888 --> 00:40:24,589
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually did switch between breeds just to see if there's any real differences.

502
00:40:25,209 --> 00:40:26,370
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Nintendogs.

503
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:33,872
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the coolest thing about it was when I threw the ball and the ball went 3D into the back and then he came running

504
00:40:34,352 --> 00:40:37,914
[SPEAKER_01]: Back With It, and you know, it was 3D and Nintendogs.

505
00:40:38,174 --> 00:40:42,456
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be boring after a few days, but you know, the first couple days you'll really enjoy it.

506
00:40:44,357 --> 00:40:47,619
[SPEAKER_01]: I also saw a few videos, and I'll just quickly hit on those.

507
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:50,060
[SPEAKER_01]: Paper Mario, beautiful game.

508
00:40:51,401 --> 00:40:52,701
[SPEAKER_01]: It is like a pop-up book.

509
00:40:52,781 --> 00:40:53,642
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really cool.

510
00:40:54,842 --> 00:40:56,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Metal Gear, amazing.

511
00:40:57,203 --> 00:41:00,104
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear a lot of people think it's one of the best videos on the floor.

512
00:41:00,564 --> 00:41:01,124
[SPEAKER_01]: I can agree.

513
00:41:01,264 --> 00:41:02,524
[SPEAKER_01]: You could move the camera around.

514
00:41:02,604 --> 00:41:04,665
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll look like a PS2 game, but in 3D.

515
00:41:04,985 --> 00:41:05,645
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really neat.

516
00:41:07,045 --> 00:41:12,067
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw Dead or Alive on videos, just really briefly, because I was like, I don't care about Dead or Alive.

517
00:41:12,107 --> 00:41:13,727
[SPEAKER_01]: But graphically, it looked pretty nice.

518
00:41:15,028 --> 00:41:20,149
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the worst video goes to Resident Evil, because for some reason...

519
00:41:20,909 --> 00:41:48,026
[SPEAKER_01]: I could not find the right angle to look at it I looked at it straight on like every other demo and sometimes it would be you know in focus and sometimes it would be crazy couldn't understand why but that was my entire 3d oh no wait I took pictures with the 3d camera they had that off to the side I had to hunt for it and those were really cool you can actually adjust

520
00:41:49,386 --> 00:42:02,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, with the slider, how the 3D looks, but there was also like an option to toggle how the actual 3D looks instead of just making a flat image, you could kind of change the perception on the 3D image itself.

521
00:42:04,053 --> 00:42:08,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of pissed I didn't see that, because that was one of the few things I really, really wanted to see.

522
00:42:09,435 --> 00:42:16,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, out of those that you talked about, I also saw the Resident Evil one, and I also had a difficult time really seeing the 3D in it, but graphically, wow.

523
00:42:17,546 --> 00:42:23,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Wowie wow, I mean, I don't know if that was pre-rendered video, I'm assuming it was, but if not, wowie wow.

524
00:42:24,696 --> 00:42:34,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, I think the only other game I can think of off the top of my head was Sims 3 that I saw on the DS and the only real feature they were showing off was again about picture taking.

525
00:42:34,524 --> 00:42:38,407
[SPEAKER_03]: You could actually take a picture of yourself using the camera and it would model your face on the character.

526
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:45,532
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think though, I haven't played the DS one that's out there now, but I'm pretty sure it has that same feature, at least for the DSi.

527
00:42:46,633 --> 00:42:47,534
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, whatever's.

528
00:42:49,251 --> 00:42:56,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Until I heard that the line was four hours towards the end of the day, I did want to go back because I somehow missed the Star Fox demo.

529
00:42:56,972 --> 00:42:59,933
[SPEAKER_01]: I really, really wanted to play that because I heard nothing but good things.

530
00:43:00,893 --> 00:43:03,353
[SPEAKER_01]: So I apologize to anybody that wants to hear it.

531
00:43:03,513 --> 00:43:05,294
[SPEAKER_01]: I really wanted to play it, but just missed it.

532
00:43:07,094 --> 00:43:07,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Ditto.

533
00:43:07,654 --> 00:43:10,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to get my hands on as much stuff as possible.

534
00:43:10,275 --> 00:43:14,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if it was games I wasn't super familiar with, I just wanted to see as much 3D as possible.

535
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the pre-rendered videos, though, they had were really impressive.

536
00:43:19,715 --> 00:43:28,222
[SPEAKER_03]: What they kind of did to really help the line situation was that they actually had gals walking around the line a little bit, kind of showing off the DSs they had.

537
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:31,305
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could actually see the three DSs before you really got on the stage.

538
00:43:31,645 --> 00:43:34,648
[SPEAKER_03]: But all they would show was just like some pre-rendered concept videos.

539
00:43:35,028 --> 00:43:40,233
[SPEAKER_03]: But man, there was one, and I know Shane feels differently about this one, but there was one with like a champagne cork popping up.

540
00:43:40,726 --> 00:43:43,589
[SPEAKER_03]: and like all the confetti and streamers would pop out of the bottle.

541
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:52,359
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was the one thing where I really felt like the images were not going in a hall or whatever, like the depth is going back.

542
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:55,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt like the images were really popping out.

543
00:43:55,082 --> 00:43:57,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was really astounding.

544
00:43:58,707 --> 00:44:06,272
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite thing from that video, and you're right, I did not like the champagne bottle popping with the streamers.

545
00:44:06,772 --> 00:44:15,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Not because I thought it was terrible looking, it just kind of made me a little bit dizzy feeling because of the way my eyes were focusing on it.

546
00:44:15,218 --> 00:44:27,125
[SPEAKER_01]: But they had a pre-rendered picture that you can move around of Pikmin, and I love Pikmin, and that made me really, really, really need a Pikmin game for this 3DS.

547
00:44:28,973 --> 00:44:29,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you'll get it.

548
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:31,234
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like everything else coming out.

549
00:44:31,755 --> 00:44:37,879
[SPEAKER_03]: So, alright, what else to kind of wrap up here besides 3DS did we get our hands on?

550
00:44:38,959 --> 00:44:39,279
[SPEAKER_03]: The what?

551
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:39,980
[SPEAKER_03]: The Square Booth?

552
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we want to talk a little Final Fantasy XIV?

553
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:46,784
[SPEAKER_03]: The four, okay, Shane's telling me to talk about the Four Heroes of Light.

554
00:44:47,104 --> 00:44:48,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I didn't play a whole lot of it.

555
00:44:48,505 --> 00:44:50,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't really know what it's today.

556
00:44:51,007 --> 00:44:53,888
[SPEAKER_03]: It felt like the other Final Fantasy games that are on the DS right now.

557
00:44:54,449 --> 00:44:56,310
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the big thing is H.A.T.S.,

558
00:44:56,874 --> 00:45:13,413
[SPEAKER_03]: you put on hats and it changes your jobs and anybody can be like any job so I guess maybe it's got like a five thing going with it but I really didn't spend enough time with a floor demo to really comment any further I think if you like the Final Fantasy 3 and 4 on DS this is probably right up your alley

559
00:45:15,365 --> 00:45:16,486
[SPEAKER_01]: I played it a little bit too.

560
00:45:17,106 --> 00:45:21,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, the demo I picked up, somebody had just finished playing and they died.

561
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:26,673
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of my characters was dead and I had no magic to use, so it was really boring to me.

562
00:45:27,133 --> 00:45:39,101
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, the 3DS versions of the Final Fantasy games felt too slow, and this one was no exception, so I was not really digging it.

563
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:41,297
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just a hater.

564
00:45:41,618 --> 00:45:42,518
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will say this.

565
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:47,341
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was really cute how in the demo they definitely had programmed it as an E3 demo.

566
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:55,686
[SPEAKER_03]: It really reminded me of a few years ago there was a Katamari Damacy game coming out that was specifically for E3 and the king would talk about E3 and stuff.

567
00:45:56,067 --> 00:45:58,328
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of similar to this little demo they had.

568
00:45:58,668 --> 00:46:02,491
[SPEAKER_03]: The little characters in the village talked about, you know, we worked really hard on this demo.

569
00:46:02,511 --> 00:46:03,551
[SPEAKER_03]: We hope you enjoy it.

570
00:46:03,951 --> 00:46:04,652
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really funny.

571
00:46:05,592 --> 00:46:07,334
[SPEAKER_03]: I like cute little things like that.

572
00:46:07,374 --> 00:46:09,735
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes the demo games feel that much more special.

573
00:46:10,802 --> 00:46:13,303
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the ghost trick demo that we played.

574
00:46:13,923 --> 00:46:20,246
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a lot of references to how it was just a demo, that the retail version would be different, and that was fun.

575
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,647
[SPEAKER_01]: And oh my god, the dog in that game is adorable.

576
00:46:22,867 --> 00:46:26,148
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we've already talked about it, but it was great.

577
00:46:27,108 --> 00:46:29,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's bring this podcast down a little bit.

578
00:46:29,889 --> 00:46:32,990
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to play Final Fantasy XIV.

579
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,591
[SPEAKER_01]: The good news is the character creation is fun.

580
00:46:36,812 --> 00:46:38,372
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some really nice options.

581
00:46:38,792 --> 00:46:42,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially if you played XI, you know you were very limited in what you can do.

582
00:46:42,274 --> 00:46:49,176
[SPEAKER_01]: But this one gives you not a whole bunch more options, but far more than you ever had in Final Fantasy XI.

583
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:51,937
[SPEAKER_01]: I had highlights in my hair that were blue.

584
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:53,198
[SPEAKER_01]: I could change...

585
00:46:54,898 --> 00:46:59,981
[SPEAKER_01]: to many different hairstyles, many different eye colors, many different skin colors.

586
00:47:01,121 --> 00:47:10,946
[SPEAKER_01]: They also had adjustable voices, adjustable features like scars and stuff like that, and nose and chins and mouth options.

587
00:47:11,006 --> 00:47:11,546
[SPEAKER_01]: It was crazy.

588
00:47:12,236 --> 00:47:14,519
[SPEAKER_01]: The bad news is the combat is awful.

589
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:15,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely terrible.

590
00:47:16,781 --> 00:47:23,148
[SPEAKER_01]: They told us that the beta build that we were playing was different from the current alpha that players are playing right now.

591
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:32,058
[SPEAKER_01]: The combat is one of the most clunky combat schemes I've ever seen, and I played Final Fantasy XI, so I know clunky combat.

592
00:47:33,738 --> 00:47:39,120
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they had us do was get into a party and start this thing called a guild leave, which was awesome.

593
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:50,443
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a quest where you can select different styles of play like solo, duo, party, something else, and like all your servers.

594
00:47:51,291 --> 00:48:06,081
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that for difficulty so you can get better rewards or maybe do a quicker quest and still do the same quest but they had three of us join up as a group and we had to go kill crabs

595
00:48:06,961 --> 00:48:13,666
[SPEAKER_01]: So we found the crabs after some terrible walking with bad cameras, but they said the cameras will be fixed, so hopefully that's true.

596
00:48:14,447 --> 00:48:15,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Found the crabs.

597
00:48:15,647 --> 00:48:19,530
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing you have to do before you initiate battle is unsheathe your weapon.

598
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:20,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a big deal.

599
00:48:21,372 --> 00:48:23,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have to target your enemy by clicking on it.

600
00:48:24,188 --> 00:48:24,669
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

601
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:43,071
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you do that and you make sure your enemy's targeted, you will unleash attacks.

602
00:48:43,511 --> 00:48:49,658
[SPEAKER_01]: The combat though is so fast that you just don't have time to really think about what you're doing.

603
00:48:51,279 --> 00:49:00,949
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no on-screen text besides in your little chat log to tell you if you're too far away or if you can't perform that action.

604
00:49:01,565 --> 00:49:21,587
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly I thought I had the enemy targeted but I accidentally clicked on myself so nothing was happening but I didn't really realize this because there were not enough on-screen commands to tell me I was doing something wrong I really really hope they fix that because I mean I'll still get the game I won't be able to help myself but

605
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:26,791
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to make the game a little less fun for me if I can't even attack an enemy.

606
00:49:27,251 --> 00:49:30,932
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, I was a class I never would have played to begin with, the gladiator class.

607
00:49:31,512 --> 00:49:35,414
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely would have been the mage or the lancer had I known I just had to sit at a different chair.

608
00:49:37,514 --> 00:49:44,677
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I don't know, I don't have high hopes for the combat, especially since it's just not that great.

609
00:49:46,607 --> 00:49:49,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing, I think Shane is being a little harsh on the game.

610
00:49:49,408 --> 00:49:58,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say this, just I observed, because Shane wouldn't let me play, but the game was beautiful, oh my god, it was so pretty to look at, especially for an MMO, I thought it was great.

611
00:49:59,032 --> 00:50:06,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think that, I think this is a game that is very hard for Square to demo at an expo like E3.

612
00:50:06,635 --> 00:50:15,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a game like this takes a big learning curve, and I think that's part of the reason Shane had a lot of problems, is that I think he got thrown right into this thing,

613
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:40,156
[SPEAKER_03]: and kind of was being told okay do this now this now this now this you know I'm almost kind of like you know what the dude should have just sat there and played it we should have watched I mean I think it was just too much for Shane to kind of like have to do it once I think when you play the actual game you'll kind of learn how to do it piece by piece like remember how the biggest complaint about 13 it takes forever to unfold well you know a lot of it's teaching you a little piece of the game at a time and I just think the way they demoed it

614
00:50:40,516 --> 00:50:42,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of bit them a little bit.

615
00:50:42,477 --> 00:50:45,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when the actual game comes out, it won't bug Shane as much.

616
00:50:45,878 --> 00:50:46,798
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just personal knowledge.

617
00:50:47,698 --> 00:50:50,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I can kind of agree with that.

618
00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:54,581
[SPEAKER_01]: I still would like to see a little bit more of the interface change.

619
00:50:54,681 --> 00:51:00,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, if I'm too far away from an enemy, I don't need a little box in the corner telling me that.

620
00:51:00,442 --> 00:51:01,623
[SPEAKER_01]: I need something on screen.

621
00:51:02,003 --> 00:51:05,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Might be because I'm used to WoW, but that effective...

622
00:51:07,045 --> 00:51:21,875
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that I would like to see changed and could probably have helped a lot is the pointer on screen was not very smooth.

623
00:51:22,315 --> 00:51:25,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you would move your mouse and then the pointer would move very slowly.

624
00:51:26,398 --> 00:51:29,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Not responsive compared to what you're moving on the mouse.

625
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:35,843
[SPEAKER_01]: If they can speed that up, get it to a 1 to 1 ratio on your movement speed, it'd probably help a little bit more.

626
00:51:35,883 --> 00:51:43,966
[SPEAKER_01]: But by the time I was able to click on the button to go use my TP, the fight was over, and it kind of sucked.

627
00:51:44,826 --> 00:51:46,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, though, I think that's a problem with the demo, not the game.

628
00:51:48,568 --> 00:51:51,769
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard it's the same for the alpha, but it might still be alpha-related.

629
00:51:52,987 --> 00:52:01,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I will say this, you know, as somebody who sunk a couple years into Final Fantasy XI, conceptually, I really like a lot of the things they did with XIV.

630
00:52:01,211 --> 00:52:14,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I just think I can really see where they've tried to make an effort to have things more solo-able, like with these guild lives, with the different levels of difficulty.

631
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:18,039
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was really cool, and I just, I loved how

632
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:20,260
[SPEAKER_03]: The quest start was right there.

633
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,361
[SPEAKER_03]: The quest turn in was right there when you finished.

634
00:52:22,741 --> 00:52:24,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything was very instant gratification.

635
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:31,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Those of you that have played XI know it's a lot of walking and running around and slow moving game.

636
00:52:32,105 --> 00:52:35,666
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely feels like they've kind of picked up the pace a little bit in XIV.

637
00:52:36,227 --> 00:52:39,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Conceptually, I was really a fan of the stuff they implemented that I saw.

638
00:52:40,603 --> 00:52:47,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Another cool thing, because I'm not all boohoo on this game, especially after today we watched the trailer on Rob's TV.

639
00:52:47,687 --> 00:52:50,048
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I told him, I was like, well, this trailer just changed my mind.

640
00:52:50,088 --> 00:52:51,289
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to play again.

641
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:53,390
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just cut scenes.

642
00:52:53,450 --> 00:53:06,617
[SPEAKER_01]: But another cool thing about the guild leaves is that if you're someone that likes to grind in games and just not read anything, any enemies you have to kill for guild leaves have little guild leave markers next to their name.

643
00:53:06,657 --> 00:53:09,959
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know you can avoid everybody else and just focus on those same enemies.

644
00:53:11,739 --> 00:53:36,584
[SPEAKER_01]: though that does bring me to another thing I forgot to mention is that when we were killing the crabs because that's what we had to do one crab before it died started to run away and those suckers move fast and I could not catch up and part of the way you regain health is you sheath your weapon well you've got to stop to sheath your weapon the animation forces you to so he's still running away I'm trying to sheath my weapon so it stops me he's getting farther ahead and

645
00:53:37,686 --> 00:53:47,128
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably would not have known where to go unless the representative had told me where to go because I lost sight of him.

646
00:53:48,429 --> 00:53:51,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Something to keep in mind though, didn't you want the crabs to run ahead?

647
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:55,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Because didn't they take you to a room that had the other monsters in it that you needed to kill?

648
00:53:55,391 --> 00:53:56,911
[SPEAKER_03]: It almost seemed like that was part of it.

649
00:53:57,955 --> 00:54:07,002
[SPEAKER_01]: It did seem like it was part of it, but one thing, and I'm not sure because I was one of the people that didn't read the leave at all because it wasn't on my screen.

650
00:54:08,523 --> 00:54:17,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Until we actually got to that room where we had to kill water elementals too, the water elementals did not appear as part of the quest as what I had to kill.

651
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:24,134
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't until I got to that room where their name appeared below my crabs I've killed

652
00:54:24,874 --> 00:54:31,596
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I don't know if that triggered more to the quest, or if it just didn't show up until I got closer to those enemies.

653
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:33,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm, interesting.

654
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:38,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, let's move on from Final Fantasy XIV and talk about some of the other games we saw.

655
00:54:38,899 --> 00:54:44,781
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Civilization V was another game we had a little time to sit down and have a demo done for us.

656
00:54:44,821 --> 00:54:45,581
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't get to play it.

657
00:54:46,422 --> 00:54:48,502
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was a really gorgeous game.

658
00:54:48,822 --> 00:54:52,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course they had it running on their best system, but you can...

659
00:54:53,894 --> 00:54:54,734
[SPEAKER_03]: The Hexagonal Shift is kind of new.

660
00:54:54,754 --> 00:54:55,255
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a new...

661
00:55:21,605 --> 00:55:37,764
[SPEAKER_03]: thing that they put in there, and I'm terrible, I forgot the name of it, and I should have taped the thing yesterday so I could remember, but they reminded me of like talent trees in Diablo or WoW, where as you put your points in these certain trees, it kind of has this effect on your civilization, which I thought was kind of neat.

662
00:55:38,223 --> 00:55:39,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

663
00:55:56,946 --> 00:56:02,588
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that I don't care for the Civilization series, it's more that I don't do strategy games.

664
00:56:03,228 --> 00:56:08,990
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the patience nor the, I'm guessing, brainpower to do them.

665
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:14,312
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm glad I watched the Civ 5 demo because it actually looked really interesting.

666
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:19,134
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked kind of like a SimCity style game, and I know it's not.

667
00:56:19,734 --> 00:56:42,164
[SPEAKER_01]: but there were so many aspects that you can focus on in that game instead of just all out battling it look like that it might be something I give a shot it was funny and like I said with Dead Rising I'm scared of zombies but the game was funny so I'm probably going to play it Civ 5 I'm scared of strategy games but it was funny so I'm probably going to try it alright whatever makes it work huh

668
00:56:43,683 --> 00:56:49,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I guess the very last game there is to talk about is Puzzle Quest 2!

669
00:56:50,325 --> 00:56:51,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know, we saved the best for last.

670
00:56:52,006 --> 00:56:53,206
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, it was cute.

671
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, yeah, the main battle is more of the same.

672
00:56:56,548 --> 00:56:57,468
[SPEAKER_03]: But, hey, hold on.

673
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:00,052
[SPEAKER_03]: There seems to be a lot more mini games.

674
00:57:00,072 --> 00:57:01,354
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the first things I noticed.

675
00:57:01,374 --> 00:57:06,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, in the original Puzzle Quest, there were games that you would do to, like, take over the cities and all that stuff.

676
00:57:07,403 --> 00:57:13,130
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like they've built more of those types of games in Puzzle Quest 2, and that's one of the biggest differences I noticed off the bat.

677
00:57:13,411 --> 00:57:15,534
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can play those mini games on demand, which was cool, too.

678
00:57:16,801 --> 00:57:24,605
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of dumb, because I just remembered a really good thing to have tested out on Puzzle Quest 2 was the campaign mode, because I know it was there.

679
00:57:24,625 --> 00:57:26,866
[SPEAKER_01]: I just went to Quick Battle, but yeah, it was more of the same.

680
00:57:27,587 --> 00:57:30,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Graphically, nothing really changed.

681
00:57:30,148 --> 00:57:32,749
[SPEAKER_01]: We played the DS version, just so you know.

682
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:37,652
[SPEAKER_01]: We had people next to us playing the 361, whatever.

683
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:42,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick Battle was just, you know, pick a character, fight a goblin, win.

684
00:57:42,794 --> 00:57:43,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Except I lost the first one.

685
00:57:44,675 --> 00:57:45,375
[SPEAKER_01]: I won the second one.

686
00:57:46,376 --> 00:57:50,237
[SPEAKER_01]: But I forgot to try the campaign mode because that's the thing that was supposed to be overhauled.

687
00:57:51,598 --> 00:57:52,198
[SPEAKER_01]: So that sucks.

688
00:57:54,019 --> 00:57:55,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess we'll have to wait until the full release.

689
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:56,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well.

690
00:57:56,981 --> 00:58:02,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so before we wrap up, Shane, I'll ask you kind of the same thing that I asked Bobby and put him on the spot with.

691
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:04,204
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the thing that most surprised you about E3?

692
00:58:06,329 --> 00:58:08,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is actually easy.

693
00:58:08,331 --> 00:58:08,891
[SPEAKER_01]: The 3DS.

694
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:10,352
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all knew it was coming.

695
00:58:11,453 --> 00:58:12,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't know in what form.

696
00:58:13,275 --> 00:58:15,577
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I was one of the skeptical people.

697
00:58:15,637 --> 00:58:17,978
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew I'd buy it regardless because it's Nintendo handheld.

698
00:58:18,018 --> 00:58:18,739
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't go wrong.

699
00:58:19,239 --> 00:58:22,242
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was surprised by the...

700
00:58:23,703 --> 00:58:27,628
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how much it really changed some of those games to me.

701
00:58:28,289 --> 00:58:37,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeing DJ Hero with the track coming at you was such an interesting idea compared to just seeing it flat, kind of scrolling down the screen.

702
00:58:39,338 --> 00:58:52,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeing freaking Nintendogs, you know, not the best of demos, but just kind of seeing that they had this 3D version of it and, you know, being able to see the ball go in the distance and then come back in his mouth.

703
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:54,792
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just really interesting.

704
00:58:55,853 --> 00:58:59,957
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really surprised by how much I ended up liking that little system.

705
00:59:02,278 --> 00:59:29,823
[SPEAKER_03]: for me probably two things number one I think what most people are probably thinking and surprise them about E3 even sitting at home Microsoft's and Nintendo's switching places this year where Microsoft was totally catering to the casual crowd and Nintendo finally gave I think what a lot of us were bitching about the past two years what we finally wanted yeah Kid Icarus namely you know in the 3DS and just Reggie getting out there and going and here's a game and here's a game and here's a game and now you shut the fuck up about how bad the Wii is

706
00:59:30,219 --> 00:59:56,564
[SPEAKER_03]: that's really what his press conference was it's pretty cool um and you know and then Microsoft just kind of you know really kind of putting all their chips on the casual market so we'll see how it pays off for him I don't know I'm interested in some of the extra gaming I gotta say the exercise gaming or whatever it's called not feeling so much on the casual titles that are coming out for Kinect so we'll see if the gamble pays off and then Sony's just Sony's just kind of doing their thing and you know now Valve's there and now they're gonna have motion and

707
00:59:57,116 --> 01:00:08,739
[SPEAKER_03]: but unfortunately for Sony I don't think there's a whole lot on the motion controller I feel like I have to have I'm not going to buy one because there's nothing I really want to play that needs the motion controller but I will buy LittleBigPlanet 2 that's for damn sure

708
01:00:10,147 --> 01:00:13,168
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to comment real quick about the role reversal.

709
01:00:13,728 --> 01:00:19,550
[SPEAKER_01]: This E3, everybody knows that before this E3 it's Microsoft vs. Sony with Nintendo doing their own thing.

710
01:00:20,011 --> 01:00:24,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it seems like it's Microsoft vs. Nintendo with Sony doing their own thing.

711
01:00:24,952 --> 01:00:29,774
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very interesting how everything just kind of switched with Microsoft still being like...

712
01:00:30,574 --> 01:00:33,695
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to bite off you and not care about these other people.

713
01:00:34,575 --> 01:00:37,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like they were doing with Sony to Nintendo and now Nintendo to Sony.

714
01:00:39,037 --> 01:00:48,040
[SPEAKER_01]: And in your comment in regards to the move, I always feel like if I can find one game that I know I will play a lot of for a system or accessory, I will get it.

715
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,440
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will be Time Crisis.

716
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:53,182
[SPEAKER_01]: That's enough for me to justify at least a move controller.

717
01:00:53,522 --> 01:00:57,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not the move Balancing Stone or whatever it's called.

718
01:00:58,963 --> 01:00:59,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we'll see.

719
01:00:59,463 --> 01:01:01,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe there'll be a game that'll change my mind.

720
01:01:01,084 --> 01:01:02,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's Sing Star Dance.

721
01:01:02,485 --> 01:01:03,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows, but I somehow doubt it.

722
01:01:04,266 --> 01:01:08,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, the thing that most surprised me otherwise, DC Universe.

723
01:01:09,009 --> 01:01:14,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like so, I just was loving that game and it's not, I was really caught by surprise.

724
01:01:14,613 --> 01:01:20,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was just going to be like another MMO I wouldn't really give a second thought to, although I thought the cross-platform was cool.

725
01:01:21,617 --> 01:01:24,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, I definitely want to check that game out when it comes out now.

726
01:01:24,718 --> 01:01:27,958
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what always happens to games we call one of the best of E3.

727
01:01:27,978 --> 01:01:30,019
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying DC Universe is necessarily best of E3.

728
01:01:30,059 --> 01:01:36,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that prize would really go to 3DS, but, um, you know, uh, it usually happens with our best of E3 picks.

729
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,621
[SPEAKER_03]: They come out and they're not so great.

730
01:01:39,301 --> 01:01:40,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember Nintendogs, anybody?

731
01:01:41,701 --> 01:01:46,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, okay, so, Shane, what about the thing that disappointed you the most?

732
01:01:46,662 --> 01:01:49,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Would it be, like, Microsoft, like a lot of people at home are thinking, or...

733
01:01:51,098 --> 01:01:55,122
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I wouldn't say it was Microsoft, because I'm not a huge fan of theirs anyway.

734
01:01:55,162 --> 01:01:59,966
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually kind of happy with them in terms of their new hardware.

735
01:02:01,127 --> 01:02:06,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally getting that wireless adapter built inside instead of having another $100 attachment to pay for.

736
01:02:07,893 --> 01:02:15,519
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say what really disappointed me, this E3, was the lack of playable demos for big games.

737
01:02:18,761 --> 01:02:26,802
[SPEAKER_01]: If you didn't have an appointment, you couldn't play Guitar Hero, you couldn't play DJ Hero 2, you couldn't play the new Call of Duty, you couldn't play anything at Bethesda.

738
01:02:27,743 --> 01:02:31,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Portal 2 wasn't even anywhere in playable form and that's a huge title.

739
01:02:33,924 --> 01:02:37,945
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no announcements for Dragon Age 2, which has already gotten a release date.

740
01:02:38,705 --> 01:02:41,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you Dragon Age Awakening for bundling that in and teasing me.

741
01:02:44,307 --> 01:02:53,171
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just disappointed at the lack of playable big titles, or even titles that have been previously mentioned and were nowhere on the floor.

742
01:02:55,065 --> 01:03:00,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll pretty much agree with what Shane's saying as far as the biggest disappointment, but I'll just sum it up all in one game.

743
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:11,038
[SPEAKER_03]: The one game I would have really liked to play on the show floor, that Child of Eden game, looked pretty badass, and I really wanted to check that out, and I was extremely disappointed I wouldn't be able to.

744
01:03:11,638 --> 01:03:16,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, there was a huge line for Metroid Other M, because it's the one thing in Nintendo I didn't end up playing, because I didn't want to sit in that line.

745
01:03:17,062 --> 01:03:19,164
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'll just have to check it out when the game comes out.

746
01:03:20,595 --> 01:03:26,277
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we've kind of had 3DS dominate a lot of the conversation we've had over the past couple days.

747
01:03:26,897 --> 01:03:28,698
[SPEAKER_03]: So Shane, I'll give you one more reason to talk about it.

748
01:03:29,058 --> 01:03:31,498
[SPEAKER_03]: When do you think this system is going to come out and how much?

749
01:03:31,799 --> 01:03:32,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Place your bets.

750
01:03:33,459 --> 01:03:34,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so it's Nintendo.

751
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,960
[SPEAKER_01]: They've never done a system that's been over $300.

752
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:41,721
[SPEAKER_01]: They've never done a handheld that's been over $200.

753
01:03:41,801 --> 01:03:45,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, $190 I think is the max they've gone with this DSi XL.

754
01:03:45,783 --> 01:03:46,523
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say...

755
01:03:47,878 --> 01:03:52,221
[SPEAKER_01]: I would hope the system comes out at $200 because I don't think they'll go lower than that.

756
01:03:52,801 --> 01:03:58,404
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would expect the system to come out at $250 because of the technology and all the stuff it can do.

757
01:03:59,024 --> 01:04:04,567
[SPEAKER_01]: As for when it comes out, they've already said it'll be by the end of the fiscal year, which will be March 2011.

758
01:04:06,788 --> 01:04:12,011
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say, and it'll be wrong, but I'll say in America we'll get it this holiday.

759
01:04:12,511 --> 01:04:19,155
[SPEAKER_01]: My only reasoning for that is because Nintendo has nothing for this holiday at all.

760
01:04:19,295 --> 01:04:22,597
[SPEAKER_01]: They have nothing to compete with the Move, nothing to compete with Kinect.

761
01:04:23,797 --> 01:04:35,624
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the only real holiday titles they have coming are Donkey Kong, which I don't think is big enough to support the Wii, and Wii Party, which is definitely not big enough to support the Wii this holiday.

762
01:04:36,044 --> 01:04:37,785
[SPEAKER_01]: and then for DS, Golden Sun.

763
01:04:38,705 --> 01:04:42,506
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not even sure if that's towards the holiday or if it's just standard fall.

764
01:04:42,987 --> 01:04:47,468
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to go with $250 realistically and this holiday.

765
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:52,670
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say Nintendo goes all the way to March 2011.

766
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:54,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, no, I'm going to say February 2011.

767
01:04:55,911 --> 01:04:57,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they'll do like a Valentine's Day thing.

768
01:04:57,512 --> 01:04:57,812
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

769
01:04:58,508 --> 01:04:59,308
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say February 2011.

770
01:05:00,449 --> 01:05:05,291
[SPEAKER_03]: I will also say $250, but you will get a bundle in game and movie.

771
01:05:05,511 --> 01:05:08,853
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're going to try to sweeten the pot with some nice bundles.

772
01:05:09,273 --> 01:05:11,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Although the game will not be Kid Icarus, so don't get your hopes up.

773
01:05:11,854 --> 01:05:17,717
[SPEAKER_03]: The game will be something else, and the movie will be one of those Disney things that are being demoed out on the floor.

774
01:05:17,777 --> 01:05:18,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, well, maybe not.

775
01:05:18,717 --> 01:05:21,819
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it might have to be something Nintendo related, but we'll see.

776
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:23,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they'll do that.

777
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:24,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe like

778
01:05:25,151 --> 01:05:25,831
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what it'll be?

779
01:05:25,971 --> 01:05:28,733
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be a bunch of like 3D movie trailers.

780
01:05:28,793 --> 01:05:36,556
[SPEAKER_03]: There'll be like one cartridge that's just like 3D experience and it's gonna be all these movies and things we saw on the show floor just in one cartridge.

781
01:05:36,656 --> 01:05:38,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet it'll be that and then like a game.

782
01:05:40,376 --> 01:05:48,261
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm saying February 2011, and I'm just going to say Reggie's going to try to push all those Wii titles for the holiday season.

783
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:55,905
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I disagree with Shane, I think Wii Party, as much as we don't think is enough to sustain them through their holiday season, I think that's going to be their big holiday push.

784
01:05:56,286 --> 01:06:03,010
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for the hardcore crowd, they're going to be like, hey, you got GoldenEye, and you got Kirby over here, and all this other stuff.

785
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:05,871
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think, yeah, GoldenEye was this year, right?

786
01:06:06,391 --> 01:06:08,793
[SPEAKER_03]: The demo we played felt really done, so...

787
01:06:09,366 --> 01:06:10,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think Goldeneye's maybe this year.

788
01:06:11,726 --> 01:06:16,087
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear that the Zelda demo felt really done too, and that's not until next year.

789
01:06:16,127 --> 01:06:16,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Nintendo.

790
01:06:18,348 --> 01:06:23,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I was going to say, I thought you meant Zelda on the 3DS, and I was going to go, well, there's maybe your pack-in game.

791
01:06:24,829 --> 01:06:27,309
[SPEAKER_01]: That, no, because they can make tons of money off of that.

792
01:06:27,709 --> 01:06:31,170
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking maybe Nintendogs, and I'm like, nope, that'll make a ton of money.

793
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:34,890
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing that Nintendo showed that they would pack in.

794
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:37,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe another Metroid Prime First Hunt or something.

795
01:06:39,474 --> 01:06:41,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I think it's going to be the 3D buffet.

796
01:06:41,657 --> 01:06:44,682
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically all the demos we saw on one cartridge.

797
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:47,948
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't put it past them, though, to do Nintendogs plus cats.

798
01:06:48,088 --> 01:06:48,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

799
01:06:48,509 --> 01:06:49,851
[SPEAKER_03]: They did a Nintendogs bundle before.

800
01:06:51,690 --> 01:07:14,863
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe but I think that was after the game had already come out and it was for like a special Thanksgiving bundle I feel like they could make too much money off that and I didn't think about this but the price of the games I wonder if they'll be higher than the DS or not because they're on new it is a new format it looks like the cartridges do look a little different I have a picture it's not the same of course they'll be more expensive of course

801
01:07:15,984 --> 01:07:17,845
[SPEAKER_03]: About $5 to $10 more expensive.

802
01:07:19,106 --> 01:07:21,188
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I can do $5, I can't do $10.

803
01:07:21,528 --> 01:07:23,830
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not want $50 handheld games.

804
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:26,131
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sick of $40 ones already.

805
01:07:27,172 --> 01:07:28,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's wrap up.

806
01:07:29,514 --> 01:07:35,418
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing you most want to see at E3 2011, or one thing you want to see changed for E3 2011.

807
01:07:35,698 --> 01:07:38,360
[SPEAKER_01]: What I want to see changed?

808
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:39,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Not what game I want to see?

809
01:07:40,182 --> 01:07:40,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Either.

810
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:41,610
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do both.

811
01:07:42,371 --> 01:07:45,272
[SPEAKER_01]: I want less closed doors.

812
01:07:46,373 --> 01:07:50,535
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if it's a press event, all the press should be able to see whatever.

813
01:07:50,995 --> 01:07:52,276
[SPEAKER_01]: You shouldn't have to make an appointment.

814
01:07:52,356 --> 01:07:56,458
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have a press-only area, but not an appointment.

815
01:07:56,978 --> 01:07:59,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Second thing I want to see, or game I want to see?

816
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:00,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Uncharted 3.

817
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:03,761
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know.

818
01:08:03,861 --> 01:08:07,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Next year I want to see them reopen Kensha Hall and not use it as a parking lot.

819
01:08:07,765 --> 01:08:08,585
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be pretty cool.

820
01:08:09,066 --> 01:08:13,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Help thin out the crowds a little bit and give the indies and foreign companies more place to grow.

821
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:15,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be really cool.

822
01:08:15,451 --> 01:08:21,757
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would like to see some of the game companies that are too good for booths these days come back.

823
01:08:22,157 --> 01:08:23,398
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I would like to see happen.

824
01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:25,480
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I'm kind of with Shane.

825
01:08:26,605 --> 01:08:54,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I get the appointment thing though I understand especially with something like 14 I think they should have done that by appointment I think they should have not I think it should have been more like the Civ 5 thing where someone else demoed it but that's just me I get it sometimes so anyway that's it we're going to wrap up and call it a podcast thank you guys for listening to these special podcasts I know the audio quality has been kind of crap compared to the shows I know you guys miss Jamie's Classic Game of the Week and Loki's Rants but don't worry it is all coming back this Sunday night

826
01:08:54,414 --> 01:09:02,336
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have DarkSakura and Loki and myself all kind of wrapping up E3 all over again and picking up on some of the other news that happened while the event was going on.

827
01:09:02,416 --> 01:09:03,797
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to do it.

828
01:09:04,117 --> 01:09:06,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for tuning in.

829
01:09:06,577 --> 01:09:07,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Tune loading?

830
01:09:07,157 --> 01:09:07,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I say tune loading?

831
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:08,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I was about to say it.

832
01:09:08,938 --> 01:09:11,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Tuning in and downloading the little show.

833
01:09:11,499 --> 01:09:13,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob Robertson Pals, our E3 specials.

834
01:09:14,219 --> 01:09:16,360
[SPEAKER_03]: See you Sunday night for more Orange Lounge Radio.

835
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:16,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Goodbye.
