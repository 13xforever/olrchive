14020	23594	Tonight, May 9th, 2010, StarCraft II gets a release date, Nintendo promises to increase anti-piracy measures on the 3DS, and a sequel to LittleBigPlanet gets confirmed.
31636	40023	Hello, my friends, and welcome to episode number 366 of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.
40483	46949	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
47149	47209	Mmm.
48772	49152	How are you?
50914	52215	Filled with food, apparently.
52235	54077	I had nummies.
54558	57701	Have you talked about this on the show, your new diet, a little bit?
58121	58922	A little bit, yeah.
59002	63406	It's not really so much of a diet anymore as a full-on lifestyle change.
64654	66415	I got sick of getting sick every time I eat.
67255	69636	Because I can't eat anything without being stuck.
69856	70537	I'm going to say it.
71077	72958	Everything makes me constipated.
74078	74438	Everything.
74998	76159	You just need more Metamucil.
76639	76779	No.
76959	78660	Or McDonald's.
78680	79760	That made me throw up.
79780	82341	That is the voice over there, the one and only Tech Master, Loki.
82361	83162	How are you doing, Loki?
83782	86003	I'm fine, but I think I've eaten too much.
86303	87364	It's weird because...
88484	89165	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
99995	100836	Blessing in Disguise
129878	131639	DarkSakura.com
152819	156321	We discovered Smashburger and there went everything.
157181	160102	So this weekend's been bad.
160623	169427	But yeah, so now I'm trying to eat my Twists and I'm shoving the last piece down my throat because I'm full.
170017	172458	But they're so delicious, I can't let them go to waste.
172478	174539	They're good stuff, and they make the whole room smell yummy.
175219	178160	May I say one thing so that I don't leave what I was saying on the word constipated?
178260	182562	Yes, of course, I know, sorry.
182602	184282	I'm eating 70 to 80% raw now.
185303	186443	Like, certain things I'll have cooked.
187203	191725	And I finally have gotten to the point where I'm trying to see where I can go out to eat.
192725	194706	So far, Persian food is out if I eat meat.
197047	200349	Chevys is kind of okay, but I have to be careful of corn chips.
200369	201089	Corn chips make me sick.
201430	203571	This morning I had eggs and they didn't make me sick.
204231	206072	So now I know what I can eat.
206755	208376	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
230410	231151	DarkSakura.com
249274	249594	I don't know.
249654	252575	I just think of the Warcraft episode of South Park and that guy.
253155	257076	Eating Cheetos off your chest playing Halo 2.
257336	264639	But how easy is it, though, to sit there and play a game like Halo 2 or whatever it is you play and go through a whole bag of Doritos?
265199	268080	That's not the smartest lifestyle.
268240	269341	That's called idle eating.
269921	271802	And I do it when I'm working.
272302	274223	Because I've been working on my homework for my finals.
274243	278526	Because my finals next week, ooh, which are all projects, so that means I have a lot of crap to do.
279446	283088	But the biggest thing that I always loved is I loved eating blue corn chips.
283748	286229	Like, just chomping away because I would feel too...
288079	291302	I would get distracted from other stuff without something for my mouth to do or something.
291883	295226	And now I have pecans and goji berries that I snack on.
296046	298188	Let me give you my piece of dieting advice.
298228	300450	Not that I'm one that really should be giving out dieting advice.
300850	304774	But here's my tip for those of you that want to defy the gamer stereotype.
304814	308777	And this is one really easy thing you can do that will really cut back on a lot of this.
309038	310259	Well, kind of a two-part thing.
310559	313602	A, if you're eating Doritos, Ruffles, Lays, whatever...
314202	316503	See if you can't switch to something lower fat.
316824	324248	Like, even if it's just the baked version or pretzels are a really, really good substitute as long as you're not getting the ranch pretzels and all that.
324428	325028	Carrots and hummus.
327098	329520	I don't think a lot of people are going to go that extreme.
329840	331001	Certainly that would be ideal.
331081	332382	Or pita chips and hummus.
332923	333823	But here's the other tip.
334424	336866	Put it in a bowl before you take it to the living room.
337466	341669	That way you're rationing off a certain size and you don't go through a whole bag in one sitting.
342130	342750	I'm not perfect.
343050	346213	I downed a whole bag of fortune cookies over the weekend because they're really good.
346973	348354	They sell like flat fortune cookies.
348394	349415	They're like sugar paper.
349435	350376	Oh my god, they're so good though.
350396	351236	With orange flavoring.
351677	352677	But you know how it goes.
353038	353938	We're not always perfect.
354018	355920	But that would be my tip.
356280	384272	If you want to be better when you're gaming And for anyone who is curious about how eating raw has affected me in other ways After my birthday, you know all that beer and cake that I consumed all week Because I had a lot of beer and cake left over I had gone, with my eating less thing, I had gone down 3 pounds And then I put back on 8 or 9 And now I'm back to where I was before my birthday So that means I've lost...
386073	389095	I've lost about eight pounds in a week.
389855	390495	Congratulations.
390515	391976	Hope it can keep going for you.
392016	392957	And I've been eating more.
393577	394638	For the record, I've been eating more.
394858	397099	But more vegetables and stuff.
397299	399100	I've been eating a lot of vegetables.
399240	400821	And I like bananas now, Rob.
402342	403802	I used to only like banana-flavored things.
403862	405303	Now I actually like bananas.
405763	406884	And I'll give everyone a quick recipe.
406904	407564	It's a quick one.
407664	408785	All right, hurry, because we've got to get to games.
408945	410766	DarkSakura, what kind of games have you been playing this week?
438844	445372	I actually started off playing Final Fantasy 2, finally, I got around, and I like it Oh, like the iPhone one?
445392	452801	Yeah, the iPhone one The control's pretty interesting, and sometimes it doesn't want to actually go where I tell it to go But maybe it's because I've got big fat thumbs, I don't know
453792	456533	I bet it plays better on a 3GS than it does the 3G too.
456693	459175	Because it has a slightly faster processor and those things, right?
459255	459755	Oh yeah.
459955	461035	It plays smoothly.
461496	461776	No problem.
461796	463897	See, I have a 3G and I have issues.
463917	464437	You can try mine.
465157	465557	Maybe I will.
465878	466678	Okay.
466758	476643	And then I actually, while we were waiting to get into the stupid restaurant this morning, because seriously we were waiting for like an hour, I just finally got bored and beat Espagluta again on my iPhone.
478083	483167	and I played some Star Trek Online.
483267	483847	A little bit.
483947	487850	And I've been trying to fix my Sims and I think that I just have way too many mods so fuck it.
487990	488871	I'm just not going to play Sims.
489711	492193	And DarkSakura is trying to sucker me into the world.
492233	496175	I should say back into the world because I did play the beta for a little bit of Star Trek Online.
496195	499177	She gave me a little 10 day code so I don't know.
499718	500158	I don't know.
500478	500879	We'll see.
501119	502400	Play for free with me.
502980	504841	And I've been saving stuff to give you.
506022	507303	Like stuff to add on your ship.
508405	509987	You know I've already addicted to one MMO.
510007	511188	I don't know if I can get addicted to another.
511228	511589	We'll see.
511629	511909	We'll see.
512430	524925	I don't know if it was on the show or not, but there's that, remember they're doing now like an unlimited trial basically where you can go play the first couple tutorial levels or whatever and spend as much time you want doing that.
525105	525725	That's Star Trek?
525766	526887	I thought that was one of the others.
527047	527908	No, it's Star Trek Online.
528028	528288	Oh, okay.
529397	529697	DarkSakura.com
553831	555852	I have to win 500 games in a row.
556712	558353	Actually, probably more like 1,000 games in a row.
558613	559893	So I'm working on that.
560053	563915	I'm about five now.
565435	566036	Doing a good job.
567956	575699	With how high I am on the TrueSkill leaderboard right now, if I lose a game, it bumps me down about five to ten ranks.
576459	580421	And I have to win about five games to go up a rank.
581401	583763	It's really frustrating when I get in.
584664	591730	Not necessarily lose a game, because losing basically just by a few bucks would be considered a loss.
591790	599037	Although, if you beat people, say if you don't win the game, but you beat three people, that still counts towards going up the leaderboards.
599757	603680	Anyways, but I have been playing perfect games though.
604080	609344	So much so that it's been pissing off my coworkers and they actually threatened to pull the Ethernet one time.
609384	612946	In fact, they did for a second and plugged it back in.
613046	613967	I got pissed off at them.
614027	617930	But, you know, hey, I'm pretty high up there.
617950	619871	I'm like rank 70 right now.
620111	623874	And 70 out of 60,000 people is pretty damn good, if you ask me.
626135	626676	And then...
627406	628587	Me, me, me, me, I'm the best.
628627	629728	Me, me, me, I'm the best.
629748	630368	Hey!
631869	632590	I'm just messing.
632610	633971	The leaderboards say so.
634111	636993	I had a leaderboard thing this week, too, and I'll get into that in a minute.
637113	638273	And I work really hard for it.
638954	648841	Trust me, if anybody plays actually Grand Theft Auto out there on the ranked games, you have to know how hard it is to get an actual game with people in it.
649421	654404	And then on top of that, getting a game where you finish with everybody still...
655805	659108	in the game because a lot of people rage quit out of all these games.
659849	662551	Especially the games I'm in because I kick the crap out of them.
662571	666094	I'm surprised you don't get penalized for that stuff.
666374	666654	You can.
667214	677343	Basically what you do is you go, if they quit out when you're done with the game, or during the game sometimes I'll do that, you go to their profile and you put review.
677683	678944	You can do that in any game though.
678984	679164	There's
679484	680224	DarkSakura.com
708697	714681	I'm better than everybody, I'm going to kick the crap out of anybody I had 33 kills, the person below me had 3 I had 33 kills, didn't you?
730856	732957	Whatever, okay?
733057	735498	I wish someone would show me up, but no one's coming.
735778	738760	Where's the other 69 players ahead of you?
738960	739360	I don't know.
739720	742982	But see, it's weird though, the true skill rankings, it's just win-losses.
743102	744543	So there's a lot of people on there.
744843	746163	I play like 300-some games.
746524	752446	There's people on there that are above me that have played like 20 games, but they've just happened to win the majority of those 20 games.
753607	757708	Yeah, I could create a new profile, win all the games, and then, oh, look at that, I'm at the top of the list.
757728	759749	But that's not playing fair.
760749	769532	Anyways, so other than that, I'm actually now working on, we're going to go back to playing the modded games again because it's just too hard to find people to play with.
769572	776174	So I'm looking and doing the research phase of a new modded Grand Theft Auto game.
776194	779495	So I'm looking now on map editing and stuff like that because it's,
780255	783960	We gotta have ramps and stuff going to the moon, you know, basically in this game.
784640	787844	Just to edge it out a little bit more than it was last time.
788625	791147	But I'm definitely looking forward to doing that.
792048	797034	And without modding the consoles, of course, we're gonna do the disc swap technique with that.
798482	811195	and then I just have a lot of games I'm waiting for Red Dead Redemption supposedly coming out in a few weeks so looking forward to that but have Alan Wake and Lost Planet 2 to get to and a whole bunch of stuff
813257	815819	All right, well, if you're done, then my gaming week.
816319	817840	Oh, and I joined the APB beta.
819041	823643	So hopefully, the beta requirements are a little bit more than what the actual game requires.
824024	831188	It says I need more RAM, even though I have Windows XP 3 2-bit, and I have 2 gigs of RAM, and Windows doesn't see really any more than that.
831228	834490	I mean, I'll get like 2 point something gigs of RAM.
835090	836551	So I just need to get some more RAM.
836591	838393	Probably going to upgrade my graphics card as well.
839913	840814	Looking forward to that game.
841434	841855	Good times.
842795	846177	My gaming week, honestly, not a whole lot different than last week.
846818	850200	A little disappointing because I had so many games last week and this week not quite as many.
850540	851981	It was mostly the same stuff.
852101	857304	I'm still enjoying my new video card with lots of World of Warcraft, of course, and Dragon Age a little bit here and there too.
857885	863768	Probably the only other newish thing I played was some of the new Game Room releases, although I guess that's not really new now, is it?
864169	865389	These games from 1981 and so forth.
866550	867731	DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen
886229	893313	So hopefully they're going to stick to that schedule and prove me wrong a little bit on some of the things last week, which is good, because there's a lot about Game Room I do like.
894594	901658	Again, I think there's a lot of room for improvement, and I hope that that base engine for Game Room will not stay that way forever.
901738	903298	I do hope they make some upgrades to it.
904379	904719	We'll see.
906360	908523	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
922720	923820	Pitfall is a timed game.
923861	927502	You only have 20 minutes tops to run through the jungle and collect as much treasure as you can.
927842	934204	So I played for the full 20 minutes without losing all my lives because some things you learn when you're five and you never forget.
934504	938046	And the thing I learned is how to get across that alligator pit when there's no vines.
938566	940367	And that's the part of the game that usually trips people up.
940747	945469	But yeah, I was able to get through there and I pretty much ran consistently for 20 minutes.
946029	946369	I go...
947626	948826	Thanks for watching!
968432	969353	That's if you get all the treasure.
969753	974195	I was only 400 points shy of being in the top 20 on the game room leaderboard at the time.
974255	975495	I think it's gotten a lot harder now.
975515	977436	I think the minimum score is about 100,000 now.
978957	982759	But I just need to learn one thing I didn't know as a kid was how to navigate the tunnels.
983099	986160	I thought the tunnels were stupid because trying to get around the scorpions is kind of hard.
986500	994404	So I never really learned how to navigate the tunnels and my little five, six-year-old brain didn't understand a tunnel skips three regular screens.
994844	1000848	So I didn't really learn the patterns that some people, I'm sure, memorized when they were younger, and that's how they're getting on the leaderboard now.
1001348	1004370	So maybe I'll go back to that and try to actually play a better game.
1004390	1004731	We'll see.
1004811	1010434	But other games I checked out this week on Game Room, Super Breakout, which I think kind of stinks.
1010674	1017579	And, you know, I realize it was the first game like it, but I would much rather see a game like Arkanoid or something come to a Game Room.
1017619	1018900	And plus the controller...
1019460	1020000	Thanks for watching!
1044129	1060445	TigerClaw on our chatroom By the way, join us in our chatroom if you're not already there We do tape live every week at All Games Radio www.allgames.com at 6pm Pacific right after the Bobby Blackwolf show But if you are listening to us live pull up a chair and join us in our chatroom chat.orangeloungeradio.com And TigerClaw actually says
1060905	1061585	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1084156	1084477	No kill screen!
1101719	1102200	I'm joking.
1123143	1124323	is also on Game Room this week.
1124603	1126624	And that was kind of a funny shooter game.
1127005	1128145	It was a little silly.
1128185	1132607	You could say it's Space Invaders-esque, but basically objects are falling from the sky or they float in the sky.
1132948	1133608	You shoot them.
1134849	1146334	It's a little more challenging, I think, in some ways in Space Invaders because the things, they're supposed to be based on household objects, like you shoot toasters and hamburgers, but it's Atari 2600 graphics.
1146394	1147295	So they just all look like
1147475	1148536	Blob and Blob.
1148856	1150058	Yeah, you're shooting things.
1151119	1156064	And some of the things in later levels float down towards the bottom, but they're in very specific patterns.
1157445	1161389	Some of them will hover right where your ship could go, so you have to actually kind of memorize the patterns.
1161810	1163031	Or you could go explodey.
1163777	1165560	Ooh, and Vandy in our chatroom says River Raid.
1165580	1167482	That is definitely a classic Activision game, too.
1168303	1169205	Lots and lots of good stuff.
1170867	1174692	Ooh, SalaciousPop asking me in chat if I ever got in on the Civ 3 for sale.
1174712	1175974	I should put that out as an FYI.
1176434	1177336	Steam was running a sale.
1177636	1179919	Civilization 3 Complete Edition
1180660	1184061	A dollar twenty-five That's a great deal What?
1184301	1202328	Yeah, on Steam Civ 3, the complete edition But get this Civ 4 I think was like And Alan, correct me if I'm wrong But I think it was like $19.95 No, I think it was less than that Maybe $12.95 For everything Civ 4 Civ 4, the expansion and colonization Was like less than $20 It was nice
1204133	1232704	one other thing I do want to mention during my game week because I do play a lot of World of Warcraft lots of information leaking on Cataclysm this week I don't want to go too spoilery because I know some people are really trying to prevent hearing all the spoilers a lot of what I've seen is very visual so thankfully this is a radio show and I can't really spoil the visuals but I will say I am so glad that the game is getting like a graphical upgrade I think it's great that Blizzard is kind of taking this opportunity to say let's see how could we like retcon a graphical upgrade into the game oh
1233724	1238728	Let's blow up the world as it is and make this whole new world and it'll have all new graphics.
1240129	1241250	And some of the screenshots are great.
1241750	1242571	So, yeah.
1243571	1245833	And Bobby in chat is correcting us, jumping in.
1246734	1249216	$10 for Civ IV, the two expansions, and colonization.
1249236	1250136	That's a great deal.
1250557	1251517	That's a great deal.
1251537	1253239	I gotta get in on that before it's over.
1253839	1254580	Damn you, Steam.
1255660	1284186	Nickel and Diamond me for all these old games yeah so World of Warcraft Cataclysm I'm excited about that kind of surprised at how fast information is leaking out but the friends and family alpha is going on and unfortunately not everybody's friends and family at Blizzard can apparently be trusted because once it hits the internet which the client has apparently it's done because that thing's got data mined and there's pictures and models and everything so yeah looking forward to some of the things they have planned for the expansion
1285663	1288344	Alright, let's get into some housekeeping tonight.
1288384	1297627	We want to wish a very happy Mother's Day to all the mothers who happen to be listening and all of your mothers or motherly figure in your life and what have you who happen to be tuning in.
1297687	1299888	I don't know if we have a lot of mothers that listen to this show.
1300409	1301549	We all know mine doesn't listen.
1301869	1303010	We have one listening now.
1303731	1304431	Oh, Becky, right?
1304752	1305873	Well, happy Mother's Day, Becky.
1306393	1310557	And I think Deakman's wife might listen once in a while.
1311057	1312679	And I don't know what other mothers.
1312719	1313940	I apologize if I forgot you.
1314040	1318484	But happy Mother's Day to all you or just anybody who considers themselves a mother.
1319085	1319345	All right.
1320306	1323308	Let's move on and actually get into some gaming news now.
1323509	1327392	And speaking of Blizzard, I believe we're starting off tonight with just an avalanche of Blizzard news.
1327432	1327732	Right, Loki?
1327752	1327833	Yeah.
1328653	1332798	Yeah, there's a lot of news coming out for... I heard what you did there.
1332878	1333960	Totally unintended, too.
1334540	1337424	Totally unintended.
1337624	1347155	With StarCraft 2, of course, they announced the release date for July 27th, and both the collector's edition and the regular edition will be coming out that...
1347956	1351557	At that time, of course, this will be the first StarCraft 2 that's being released.
1351677	1355518	I believe there's still going to be two more because one for each campaign.
1355898	1356679	Way to whore it out.
1359259	1360140	So that's kind of neat.
1360560	1361720	Some other neat things, though.
1362160	1365441	Apparently the map editor is very versatile.
1365501	1370863	In fact, not only can you make custom maps with it, you can make custom games with it.
1372344	1374666	Some people have used different examples here.
1375106	1377508	They've made a Tetris-like game.
1378529	1384754	There was a Mario Kart type of game where you can race different characters around.
1385415	1391340	And then finally, there was also a Shmup game made with the editor as well.
1391580	1396424	So that's pretty awesome that you have so much flexibility with just that editor.
1398717	1401558	Be very interesting to see what kind of mods you'll see for it.
1401618	1404980	It'd be more interesting to see what Blizzard does to not have this happen.
1405020	1409542	Although, I don't know, Blizzard also kind of is supporting the mod community because they kind of realize it's going to happen.
1409922	1414204	Warcraft especially, you know, I notice there's two kinds of people.
1414244	1416405	There's StarCraft people and there's Diablo people.
1416525	1420006	And I'm more of a Diablo person, so I don't follow the StarCraft news as much.
1420367	1424408	But at least when it comes to World of Warcraft, they're very embracing of the mod community there.
1424749	1427430	So maybe they're laughing at this too.
1427470	1427750	I don't know.
1430054	1430674	It's pretty neat.
1431955	1440477	I'm not planning on picking up the game, though, because I don't think I was either a StarCraft or a Warcraft type of person.
1441277	1446619	Although, I did play the original Warcraft, but that was how long ago I played the original Warcraft.
1446679	1448019	That would have been about 15 years ago.
1448039	1449560	The original Warcraft's pretty old.
1449860	1449980	Yeah.
1453112	1454734	That's it.
1455034	1457318	I'll have you know, I didn't actually buy Warcraft.
1457518	1459982	I played the demo in PC Gamer.
1460783	1461945	That's how old.
1464006	1468589	I'm going to our listeners' chats here at chat.orangeentree.com.
1468609	1471190	TigerClaw says, Sky, you should call your mother during the show.
1471430	1475692	And also, Loomis follows up, any chance of the OLR crew calling their moms?
1475732	1477754	I remember y'all tried a few months ago, and it was a lot of fun.
1478574	1484817	Yeah, you know, I already called my mom this morning, and we chatted about that, because she said I was surprised I wasn't calling her during the show.
1484857	1487599	And I was like, well, you know, we kind of did that bit a couple weeks ago.
1488259	1491561	I called my mom and talked to her while I was waiting to get in the restaurant, yeah.
1491561	1492962	I already did stuff with my mom this week.
1519459	1546020	Um, let's see, other comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchery.com Bochikawa talking about the Cataclysm leaks Sky, remember not all leaks are unintentional Blizz only gets more people interested for what they're showing off in Cat That's true, you know, I'm sure Blizzard to some extent realizes that a lot of the stuff they put in the Friends and Family Alpha is going to be out there even though it's all under NDA and they've come out and said, hey, all this stuff is still under NDA although it hasn't stopped MMO Champion from running everything
1546660	1553110	Um, but I, I, I think to some extent, uh, anything they put out there, they realize is, is gonna leak.
1553670	1557696	Um, but there's, there's a lot that isn't in the Cataclysm beta right now.
1557756	1560400	Like, like, like not every zone, apparently.
1561181	1561261	Um...
1562723	1563903	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1582955	1608615	Anyhow, one thing that also could change in the future, apparently the Wii, and Nintendo in general, might be kind of reconsidering their stance on online, because apparently Nintendo, you know, one place Nintendo fails hardcore is online, and a lot of that has to do with, you know, the whole friend code thing was a little bit silly, and, you know, just that they haven't embraced the online gaming to the extent that Xbox Live or even, you know, PlayStation Network has.
1609835	1615898	There are some comments that Miyamoto, the god of Nintendo in many ways, brought us Mario and all these folks.
1616358	1620479	He talked to Edge Magazine and apparently was talking about online business this week.
1620559	1627342	Miyamoto said the following, "...probably the other thing that we are desperate to realize is the core online business structure."
1627862	1631284	Do we need to demand customers pay monthly fees to enjoy online activities?
1631765	1637508	Or give an online subscription that is free of charge but then offer something extra for people to pay so they get some extra value?
1637868	1641310	With these core business strategies, I think we are less active than we should be.
1643132	1651157	Apparently, it had come up in conversation that Nintendo actually wasn't being very proactive with their online strategy because, well, they're not.
1652077	1659243	You know, basically, if you look at what Miyamoto's saying in those quotes, I mean, in my opinion, he basically says Xbox Live and then PlayStation, right?
1659943	1661865	Pay monthly fees to enjoy online activities.
1662005	1662825	That's Xbox Live.
1663246	1666448	Or give an online subscription that's free but something extra for people that pay.
1666748	1676976	That's PlayStation Network with their free model, but you have, like, the core magazine that has all the little frills in it and some of their other... It's also kind of Xbox Live because you can access it for free.
1676996	1677296	True.
1677476	1677657	True.
1678397	1685786	So, uh, but he, Miyamoto does say, don't forget that there is like a reward program for folks that get their Wii's online if you help others.
1686487	1693676	Um, but he did admit Nintendo has, hasn't been very proactive in developing such online activities as an MMOG.
1694898	1695138	Hmm.
1695178	1695238	Hmm.
1696112	1696452	Who knows?
1696532	1701475	I mean, the door is still wide open, I think, to make a real Animal Crossing online game.
1702375	1704317	I would say the door is still open to that.
1704437	1711440	Not a rehashed frickin' original Animal Crossing game with online elements as the DS and Wii ones were.
1711460	1713602	You could still make a full-fledged MMO for Animal Crossing.
1713982	1717124	Also, Pokemon, I think, would lend itself to an MMO very well.
1718244	1721406	But could we perhaps see something at E3 this year?
1722186	1723407	I would guess probably not.
1724502	1728186	They're never going to embrace online, at least not with this console.
1728887	1730729	I would say probably not with this console either.
1731110	1735355	I don't think it's going to happen with the Wii, but I think it's something you've got to see in their next console.
1735395	1735916	They have to.
1736196	1741823	There's no... Because they're basically saying, oh, people don't really care about online.
1741963	1743124	Well, that's not true.
1744085	1747168	and then you see 11 million subscribers of World of Warcraft.
1747368	1750130	Or all the people on Facebook and stuff.
1750170	1751071	That's still online.
1752532	1752932	That's true.
1752972	1756615	I'm surprised Nintendo doesn't try to do something with Facebook because a lot of it's the same audience.
1757195	1757696	You know what I mean?
1757716	1759677	In fact, wasn't there something...
1762043	1763284	I'm thinking of something.
1763304	1765565	No, I think you're thinking of the parody stuff with Mario.
1765645	1766506	No, no, no, no.
1766806	1769307	I know there was that, but there was something else I was thinking of.
1769327	1774550	I thought there actually was something with this whole get your friends on the Wii that's somehow tied into Facebook, but I could be wrong.
1775831	1776231	That's fine.
1776732	1777472	I'm wrong sometimes.
1777612	1777952	It happens.
1779093	1785677	We'll see what happens with Nintendo in the future and their online presence, but I would say don't get your hopes up, at least with this generation.
1786157	1791321	They're going to probably hype it up for whatever console is coming next and make it sound like it's new.
1791581	1794222	Like all these things are just new ideas that have never been done before.
1794703	1795083	We'll see.
1795303	1804289	Oh, and real quick, since we're on the topic of Nintendo and being that we did sort of like a sort of secret club a few weeks ago,
1805169	1806330	I have something to tie in with that.
1806531	1806891	Oh, really?
1806951	1810615	It hasn't quite made it out there yet, but we'll be out there soon enough.
1810855	1811316	I see.
1811476	1811777	Okay.
1812257	1814540	I wish I knew I would have brought up the Secret Club theme music.
1814560	1815901	No, that's all right.
1816161	1817002	It's really stupid.
1817263	1818204	Remember Secret Club?
1818544	1819165	I didn't hear it here.
1820327	1833338	So, as you may remember, it was confirmed that today, actually, that the black Wii system bundle with Wii Sports Resort and Wii Motion Plus and all the Wii Sports that came out for the same price.
1833938	1837081	And, you know, great.
1839002	1841004	What they didn't mention is it's also coming out in white.
1842671	1843372	Oh, that's stupid.
1843472	1843832	Yeah.
1843912	1844412	Yeah.
1844693	1845393	I see exactly.
1845673	1846294	Okay.
1846674	1852018	But that's good to know that the White Whees aren't going away or they're not going to be collector's items or anything.
1852278	1858363	It's basically going to be... They're just going to do this for... I don't know how long.
1858383	1859243	Because it is limited.
1859263	1860805	It says on the box, limited edition.
1860885	1864747	But that might be just like, buy this, please.
1865588	1866249	So, I don't know.
1867149	1875836	So basically you will be able to pick when you go to the store if you want to make a Wii and you'll have a big decision to make and that would be do you want it black or white?
1893673	1895815	But that's the question shoppers everywhere are going to ask themselves.
1896215	1896715	Black or white?
1897356	1897716	Alright.
1898877	1899357	I am a dork.
1899637	1900878	DarkSakura, what's up next?
1901979	1912547	Well, Nintendo has sent out a little plug for something that's supposed to happen for June 16th, which is right during E3.
1913407	1920833	The official Nintendo magazine is going to have a world exclusive in issue 57, which is something, but the
1921613	1925837	The quote goes, you may want to mark Wednesday, 16th, June in your diary.
1926157	1933323	We'll be revealing world exclusive details on a top secret new game in the next issue of O&M.
1934184	1935605	How do they know I have a diary?
1936741	1944224	I think that, given the way that the date's listed and diary, I would suspect that it's European information.
1945524	1945784	Anyway.
1947465	1953967	But, maybe it's an excuse to try to get people to go out and buy more official Nintendo magazine.
1955207	1958888	All they have to do is say, Howard and Nestor, back for real, forever.
1958988	1959628	How about this?
1959748	1963089	I mean, it's like, why don't you just wait to see what's at E3?
1963109	1965210	Because I can guarantee whatever's at E3 is going to be there.
1965230	1966991	Well, it's coming out during E3, right?
1967031	1967571	June 16th?
1967591	1968711	Well, not everyone gets to go.
1968771	1970171	That's like the Wednesday of E3.
1971012	1974493	Yeah, but everybody that we know has internet access.
1974693	1982275	And if it's the June issue, typically the issues for one month for subscribers come out a month earlier.
1983880	1985381	This could be a timed thing though.
1986462	1988043	It could still be like the July issue.
1988083	1988663	You know what I mean?
1988783	1989724	It's going to be timed.
1989924	1993986	Especially if it's sensitive information that is going to be blown at the E3 press conference.
1994407	1998509	They're going to make sure they don't leave headquarters until the game.
1998589	1999570	That's all it is.
1999630	2002432	It's going to be the Nintendo money printer.
2003496	2006338	Hinting that they're going to be doing a new Zelda game.
2006499	2007720	Yay, new Zelda game.
2008040	2010142	Xlink in our chatroom says, it's Earthbound.
2010202	2010802	Yay.
2010822	2014125	Hey, what if it's Kid Icarus?
2014565	2015326	Jizz to my pants.
2016440	2021563	Although, you know, to be fair, I mean, I know, Loki, you're sitting over there going, it's Zelda, big fucking deal.
2022123	2031849	Remember, one of the best games to come out last year, if not the best game to come out last year, was a blindside by Nintendo at E3 that nobody saw coming.
2032209	2033570	And that was New Super Mario Bros.
2033610	2033790	Wii.
2033850	2035651	Remember, there was no news on that before E3.
2036331	2036752	That's right.
2037032	2042277	I never saw them rehashing something that was on another system and re-releasing it for another system.
2042298	2042938	You know what though, Loki?
2042958	2044980	That's so unlike Nintendo.
2045061	2048284	Your cynicism aside, it really was one of the best games to come out last year.
2048404	2049285	If not the best.
2049345	2050887	I mean, last year was not like an A-plus last year.
2050907	2052368	Yeah, you know why it sold a lot?
2052408	2056433	Because people that buy the Wii eat up anything that comes out this month.
2057413	2058474	It's a good game.
2058994	2060135	It's a platform game.
2060936	2066259	It's very accessible to those that played the old Mario on the Nintendo NES.
2066359	2067239	It was a great game.
2067860	2068860	I understand it.
2068920	2077986	It's a Mario game and it'll do really well just like Super Mario Galaxy 2 will do really well because it's a Mario game because people buy Mario and Zelda and Pokemon.
2079952	2086674	I mean, if they came out with an awesome Metroid game, and yes, I know Metroid Other M is right around the corner.
2087254	2091035	Let me tell you something, Metroid Other M is going to sell as well as Mario.
2091355	2103498	If they dressed up Mario in the Samus suit and had him going fighting Bowser and stuff with a blaster and he can turn into a ball and shoot bombs and stuff like that, it would sell a billion copies because people eat up Mario.
2103558	2106339	It's just like Apple and their iPods.
2107720	2110822	I actually am going to go out on a limb, and I could be dead wrong.
2111262	2114645	I don't think Mario Galaxy 2 is going to sell as great as everyone thinks it is.
2114825	2115345	No, it's not.
2115406	2120730	I think there's going to be this kind of like just general rejection of the game.
2121490	2132038	What I think is interesting, and I don't think it's on our show roll tonight, but I heard something about they were releasing Mario Galaxy 2, not in America, but in other countries, Japan and Europe, with a DVD.
2132058	2132139	What?
2132839	2133360	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2153482	2154522	But it doesn't matter.
2154722	2156643	The system doesn't play DVDs.
2157303	2157703	Who cares?
2158264	2163345	Really, they could include the videos on the actual disc, but so what?
2164446	2171308	Because if you remember, Mario Galaxy was the first dual-layer DVD game from Nintendo.
2172608	2173389	And it was a good game.
2173589	2179472	I'm not bagging on Mario Galaxy and I'm not trying to say that Mario Galaxy 2 won't sell well because it's a bad game by any means.
2179553	2179713	No.
2179953	2181674	I just think... I don't know.
2181734	2186237	I think you're going to really see a difference between how a game like New Super Mario Bros.
2186277	2187798	Wii and that will be received.
2188098	2188498	I'm sorry.
2188518	2191720	The only reason I'm saying that it's just...
2193337	2196098	I don't have high expectations for Nintendo.
2197279	2199300	Yeah, great, New Super Mario Bros.
2199940	2200360	did well.
2200600	2201060	You know what?
2201260	2202601	If it was a different Mario Bros.
2202641	2203782	game, it was still done well.
2203842	2208824	Mario game during the fourth quarter, during holiday season, it's going to be on everyone's shopping list.
2209444	2210544	Of course it's going to do well.
2211025	2211785	That's not a surprise.
2212025	2215907	But the thing is, Nintendo doesn't really do anything to surprise us.
2216667	2219248	For example, their latest announcement that was this week.
2219428	2220949	It was just like, really?
2221709	2222029	Really?
2222529	2228772	I mean, there wasn't enough party games on the Wii that you needed Me Party or Wii Party?
2228872	2229712	I mean, really?
2230452	2231012	Wii Party?
2233533	2234454	Was that necessary?
2236414	2238235	Where am I going to get a good party game on the Wii?
2238735	2239075	I don't know.
2239115	2240216	There's just none out there.
2240396	2240656	Ever.
2241596	2241896	Ever.
2244577	2245558	If that's what people are going to buy...
2247543	2255753	But just like, you know, don't try to pretend, Nintendo, that you're going to just come out with some sort of amazing product that's just going to blow us all away.
2256173	2260478	Because I'll tell you what, it's just going to be a port of something, or it's going to be another Mario or Zelda game.
2262077	2287590	All it really is And those Mario and Zelda games I bet you anything the new Zelda game Probably going to be exactly like the last Zelda game As far as engine goes Just new levels and stuff Maybe a few little Link is going to turn into a duck this time I don't know, something different It's just Duck Link Zelda 2 The Adventures of Quack
2288826	2290647	Actdeft says they'll probably publish President Cat No
2309162	2311564	No, President Cat's not going to happen, sadly.
2312485	2313005	I wish it would.
2313045	2314126	You all know how I feel about it.
2315307	2319931	And there's still my dream that it'll be the big... Maybe that's the big surprise reveal at E3.
2320472	2321273	President Cat.
2322894	2324215	When is this cat coming on stage?
2324495	2326117	Holy shit.
2326797	2329960	I probably won't get invited to the Nintendo press conference, but that's okay.
2330020	2330921	It doesn't matter.
2330961	2332142	They'll hear you yelling.
2332402	2334584	They'll hear me yelling from wherever I am.
2334684	2335665	What the hell?
2337677	2338557	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
2338998	2340158	You guys really did that?
2340779	2341579	You really did it?
2342940	2343420	Oh, shit.
2344320	2345061	Is this real life?
2346581	2348062	Anyhow, let's move on, Loki.
2348422	2349683	President Cat will never happen.
2352566	2355229	Um, so, other stuff we can talk about Nintendo.
2355970	2364139	Of course, they're going to want to step up their anti-piracy measures for the 3DS, seeing as it's running rampant with the DS and the DSi.
2364519	2369265	Even though, oh yeah, we changed some stuff to the DSi to make it harder to pirate, but yeah, that was defeated within...
2370906	2372086	Little time whatsoever.
2372186	2376428	But apparently they hate piracy.
2376508	2376768	Yes.
2377208	2377708	Oh my God.
2378348	2389111	And of course now that six years with the system being out, they want to find ways to stop the piracy.
2389471	2393372	It says, we have a strong sense of the crisis about this problem.
2396024	2397845	Which doesn't really say what they're going to do.
2399527	2400908	We're aware of the problem.
2401968	2402309	Good.
2403429	2407112	No shit, because you sued the companies that were doing the chips and stuff, right?
2407132	2408413	They went after all these people.
2408953	2410515	So no shit you're aware of the problem.
2411624	2414165	How are you going to make that perfect anti-piracy?
2414205	2415985	I mean, doesn't Sony say this all the time?
2416406	2419807	We have made our next console unhackable.
2421047	2422408	48 hours later, LOL hack.
2422788	2423568	I'm going to tell you right now.
2424428	2436112	Unless the system has downloadable firmware updates that they can do, something like that, the fact that these games are on a cartridge, there's no way that they're going to be able to stop piracy.
2436712	2438573	It will get broken quickly.
2438613	2438933	Quickly.
2441124	2441764	Bold statement.
2442985	2444626	Let's look at the past history now.
2447288	2449570	Really, the only system that's been hard to crack is the PS3.
2449590	2455233	That's just because Blu-ray has it really, you know, it's somewhat a new technology.
2455674	2456614	It's not necessarily that.
2456634	2458075	It's just they have good encryption and stuff.
2458115	2462018	But it's just, look at the Nintendo systems.
2462058	2463999	I mean, the DS, the Game Boy Advance.
2465120	2465560	It'll happen.
2467105	2477379	and especially since I'm assuming this system is going to have some of the technology that's in the DS because it is going to be backwards compatible.
2478821	2481825	So it probably won't be that difficult.
2483396	2485157	I'm planning on picking one up because I think it's going to be neat.
2486098	2488020	Alright.
2488760	2490922	Well, let's move on to talk about some other news.
2490982	2494104	Actually, wait, I've got to read these A-plus comments from chat because there was some hilarious stuff.
2494385	2504512	Going back to the whole duck Link thing, Stan in our chat room, A-plus comment, Link turns into a donkey and the next game will be called The Legend of Zelda, Zelda's Tijuana Donkey Show.
2506474	2507855	Now that's a game I'd play.
2507875	2507955	Okay.
2510222	2525632	or Link turns into a wolf gets captured by Bob Barker and then neutered LittleBigPlanet 2 is going to be coming out that's right, it's real, it's actually happening we've had a few leaks and remember the guy a couple weeks ago whose song was confirmed to be in the game, etc, etc
2526232	2532777	Well, apparently Game Informer has said it is coming and we're going to show off more information in our June issue of Game Informer.
2533298	2534979	So, what exactly is going on?
2534999	2536661	Well, some of the little details have leaked.
2536841	2538362	It is a whole new game.
2539563	2541585	This is coming from the NeoGAF forums.
2541685	2551212	Apparently, Media Molecule is making tools that will allow you to do racing games, space invader shooters, puzzle games, role-playing games, and strategy games.
2551733	2552453	They are just...
2553314	2556115	Making this engine, it's not just for side-scrollers now.
2556736	2557756	That's the big difference here.
2557816	2564259	And the thing I heard, I thought, was the stuff from LittleBigPlanet 1, I think you're going to be able to bring into LittleBigPlanet 2.
2565220	2569362	Apparently a media molecule developer made a Command & Conquer clone in the game.
2570522	2577606	And they also were saying that they were able to, now you can really have good control over the cameras and stuff like that, the physics.
2577906	2580267	You're going to be able to create and edit short films.
2580487	2582428	So this is going to be Mashima Heaven, apparently.
2583369	2585990	You will be able to record your own sound effects.
2586150	2588511	I don't even know how that works, but that's what they're promising.
2588972	2592914	You will be able to move the game's camera around to make your own cut scenes using Sack Boys.
2593474	2595855	And, and, and, the Sack Bot.
2596375	2599177	A fully customizable, programmable enemy unit.
2600358	2602301	So you can control it yourself.
2603683	2605425	I almost think this is going to be too much.
2605626	2607709	It is going to be epic.
2607969	2614158	Part of what made LittleBigPlanet so cool was that it was relatively easy to make your own levels, but there was still... It wasn't...
2615820	2617141	It wasn't easy to make a good level.
2617181	2617842	Let me put it this way.
2617862	2618562	Let me put it that way.
2618722	2623606	It's hard with... The problem you run into when you can do that is it's like you don't know where to begin.
2624207	2626108	It's just like all these options.
2626148	2627469	You don't know how to kind of focus it.
2627829	2630071	Whereas if you're limited somewhat, it's a little bit easier.
2630131	2632913	Okay, I got to make a side-scrolling game, so here's this.
2633213	2638938	But people that want to expand beyond that to make like the space shooters and stuff, they're limited by what they can do.
2639178	2649022	So this, I think, since you're going to have full control over the camera and stuff, you're going to see a lot of maybe even top-down games and whatever, but it's just going to be nuts.
2649342	2654464	Alpha Cananogram wants to jump in there and try to correct me, saying the PlayStation Eye has a microphone.
2655484	2664492	That, okay, so you'll be able to make your own sound effects, but, I mean, what are you going to be able to make with a microphone on a camera besides, like, you know, fart noises and, you know, just, like, random screaming?
2664672	2666734	It would be cool if you could import WAV files in MP3s.
2666754	2667815	That would be awesome.
2667915	2669237	Make your own background music?
2669317	2669717	Hello.
2670157	2673560	Although, that also opens the door to, like, rampant piracy.
2674982	2675162	Like...
2675602	2692353	soon not only will you be able to listen to Lady Gaga leaks and whatever else is leaking on the internet that whole iLeaks thing not only will you be able to do that on YouTube but you'll be able to go into LittleBigPlanet and listen to new songs because people will bring MP3s over it's great
2694574	2696355	So yeah, this sounds pretty awesome.
2696395	2701217	By the way, there are some other little things trickling out about there.
2702517	2706519	It's just a more robust game that is not just side-scrollers.
2707259	2709920	And this kind of catches me by surprise, because I thought...
2710720	2711381	LittleBigPlanet 2
2730621	2731302	That sounds epic.
2732062	2733323	Erasing games?
2734123	2737005	Direct competition with... Themselves, almost.
2737025	2737766	It's so weird.
2740488	2741208	RPG Maker.
2741388	2742529	You used to love that.
2742769	2744170	You used to love the RPG Maker series.
2744190	2746572	It's just a lot to do, though, with RPG Maker.
2746592	2748673	That's the problem.
2749534	2759801	Trying to create an RPG or something, it's just a lot of work with trying to create the storyline and all the different AI and sequences and stuff.
2761501	2762482	It gets too difficult.
2762702	2771425	Like, I think the most work that I did on an actual RPG or adventure game or something was actually, like, in MegaZooks.
2771945	2773386	You remember the ZZT sequel?
2773486	2773866	Oh, yes.
2774106	2781529	And the only reason why is because it was pretty much, you know, you can draw your levels, place your enemies and stuff, and you don't really do a lot of programming.
2781889	2786131	Although I did have some boss characters and stuff like that, like a barrier that you can kill with grenades.
2786531	2788772	Little big planet three, ZZT.
2789232	2791293	But, I mean, that was awesome.
2792474	2796717	Seriously, now that's something that they need to bring to, like, a console or something.
2796877	2799819	One of these weeks, we really need to highlight that as a classic game of the week.
2799859	2804441	I know that's not really DarkSakura's alley, but if she's ever gone in the future, we gotta do ZZT.
2805022	2807884	I could do a whole episode about how much I love ZZT.
2809365	2810025	It was a great game.
2811709	2815292	Create an OLR game in the ZZT contest or something like that.
2815572	2821176	Well, actually, TigerClaw in our chatroom talking about this whole LittleBigPlanet2 says, Somebody can make a level with clips from OLR.
2821597	2822978	I'm a little scared of what that might bring.
2823258	2824239	By the way, I thought this was neat, too.
2824259	2828542	They're also talking about PlayStation Eye integration for loading levels using QR codes.
2828582	2831385	Are those like those barcodes that are meant for cell phones and stuff?
2831465	2831945	I think so.
2832025	2835128	So you'll be able to bring in levels just by holding up a little thing to your camera.
2835828	2836448	You know what?
2836468	2837669	That sounds like the e-reader.
2838349	2838909	Remember that?
2839489	2839729	Yeah.
2839789	2842790	Where they would put full Nintendo games on like five little cards.
2843270	2843771	Remember that?
2843791	2846612	That was awesome.
2846972	2847812	Wow, lots of stuff.
2847892	2852113	And oh my gosh, just so much.
2852173	2855815	There's some spoilers of levels that are out there.
2855855	2862977	I guess I shouldn't give you too many spoilers, but they are talking about a tribute level to all these old arcade classics.
2865771	2867352	More information at E3, I'm sure.
2867673	2870115	Ooh, I wonder if it'll be playable on the show floor.
2870475	2871015	Excited.
2872577	2874198	It'll definitely be part of their press conference.
2874438	2875679	Absolutely.
2875779	2878442	Weren't they supposed to be having two press conferences, or was that Microsoft?
2878482	2879162	That's Microsoft.
2879242	2881204	It's doing one just about Natal, I believe.
2881484	2884206	I don't know if that's like a media night or what that's all about.
2884987	2885347	We'll see.
2885908	2887069	Dark Sakura, what you got for us?
2887938	2888839	More stuff, Rob.
2889199	2889800	More stuff.
2890501	2892383	In fact, more Nintendo.
2893284	2898189	But this is actually specifically about Sin and Punishment, Successor of the Skies.
2901432	2905636	The European box art has a reversible cover.
2906477	2933779	so you can actually put have the Japanese box art on it it's not going to look exactly like the Japanese box art because the big logo is not up at the top side of it it's on the bottom but it is the Japanese artwork and I was looking at the European box art yeah and it's just it's not bad but it's not as really good as the Japanese one
2934780	2937922	I think that it's actually... I mean, it's not bad.
2938443	2940704	But the Japanese art is just really fantastic.
2941425	2943847	It's a really gorgeous piece of artwork.
2945608	2946709	So I'd say that's a treat.
2946929	2950211	I like it when you get fun little reversible things.
2950731	2953453	Also, it was cool when Capcom did the Okami.
2954494	2955315	And I ordered mine.
2956095	2957756	That I got five months later.
2958017	2960538	When you can print your own and put them in there.
2960578	2962280	Somebody did one for Wii Sports.
2962820	2963921	It was kind of fan-made.
2964531	2970973	I would like to see a lot of those Photoshop contests too that do like the retro style book covers but out of video games.
2971393	2972874	There's been some very creative ones.
2972934	2976495	I'd like to just kind of film up my gaming library with the alternative covers.
2976535	2977255	I think that would be cool.
2977375	2981437	I'm going to link this image though to the chat room because I think they'd really like to see it.
2981517	2981777	I hope.
2982717	2983278	If not, too bad.
2983298	2983998	I'm linking it anyway.
2985078	2988122	I'm going to our chatroom, chat.orangeloundtrader.com.
2988162	2990444	Stan is asking, wasn't there already a Nintendo cereal?
2990824	2993347	I'm sure it was a Mario cereal or a Zelda cereal.
2993427	2994188	Actually, it was both.
2994889	2998232	And that was in response to a comment Actdeft had said, what's next, Nintendo cereal?
2998252	2999674	It was the Nintendo breakfast system.
2999794	3000935	Yeah, the Nintendo breakfast system.
3002056	3004098	And it had a little theme song.
3004138	3005240	Yes, it had both, right?
3005900	3007241	It's for breakfast now.
3007762	3010925	It had both the Mario and Zelda, right?
3011025	3015529	Yeah, it was split in the center like those logos for the two game cartridges.
3016470	3016930	Here, hold on.
3016950	3017891	Here we go.
3018852	3020553	This is going to take me way back, y'all.
3020934	3021634	Way back, y'all.
3022355	3023196	Before some of you were born.
3029184	3029784	It's too low.
3029824	3030405	It's too low.
3030445	3031365	They probably can't hear that in chat.
3031385	3031605	Hold on.
3031625	3033926	Let me try another one here.
3033966	3035767	Let's try this one.
3051874	3052855	A Fruit Flavored Crunch Fruit Loops
3073026	3074828	I couldn't get over just how awful it smelled.
3074868	3077352	But then again, my favorite cereal when I was a child was Grape Nuts.
3079455	3080717	Alright, let's move on.
3080777	3082779	Release dates and see what's coming out around the world.
3082820	3085864	Sadly, no new Nintendo cereal, but at least some video games coming out, hopefully.
3086758	3089881	Yes, video games definitely on their way out this week.
3090382	3091823	Actually, some pretty decent stuff.
3092724	3096387	We've got some big game releases starting off with Lost Planet 2.
3097428	3100972	That's going to be making its way out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.
3101452	3103254	Sad, though, I was reading the reviews on it, man.
3103294	3104856	Just some real...
3106463	3110164	I don't know, just okay reviews, not kind of gloating over the whole thing.
3111544	3112125	Uh-oh.
3112665	3114125	Yeah, that's too bad.
3114925	3121787	Dance Sensation, Majesco's, I guess, version of Let's Just Dance, except not as good.
3121947	3124048	That'll be coming its way on the Wii.
3124668	3128050	Skate 3, coming out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this week.
3128491	3132673	A game I'm probably going to pick up, 3D Game Heroes, coming out on PlayStation 3.
3132713	3134635	Ooh, you'll have to tell me if that's worth getting.
3134775	3136516	I'm really curious about that game.
3136536	3137857	The reviews have been excellent.
3138037	3138257	Really?
3138357	3139118	Excellent reviews.
3139418	3141439	So I am definitely picking that up.
3142400	3146723	And that's really a dilemma for me because that means I'm going to have to update my firmware on my PS3.
3149359	3151540	Wait, were you trying to hold off on the whole Linux thing?
3151560	3152181	Yes, I was.
3152681	3153962	When do you ever use Linux?
3154302	3154902	It doesn't matter.
3155022	3156763	It's not Linux that I'm interested in.
3157764	3158224	Oh, I see.
3160345	3164487	The expansion for Age of Conan, Rise of the Godslayer, coming out on PC this week.
3165368	3169270	Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3, coming out on PSP.
3171765	3177769	Batman Arkham Asylum Game of the Year Edition in 3D coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.
3185300	3193090	Oh, also, of course, the real overpriced Xbox 360 USB flash drives will be coming out this week.
3194051	3195273	8GB and 16GB.
3195914	3197556	Seriously, just go buy a third-party one.
3197616	3198677	It's way cheaper.
3199578	3199839	Okay.
3200840	3201341	And that's it.
3202711	3204593	Going to Japan on the Xbox 360.
3204653	3206814	Remember last week was a dead week because of the holidays.
3207355	3210057	So we're back in the swing of things this week.
3210217	3212359	2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa comes out this week on the 360.
3213320	3215201	Also a game on the 360 called Metro 2033.
3215642	3218024	This is coming from THQ.
3218184	3219885	I have not heard a lot about what this game is all about.
3219945	3223728	It's a Russian first-person shooter game, kind of like a post-apocalyptic type thing.
3223849	3224569	Ooh, it looks like fun.
3224609	3225370	Is that coming out over here?
3225530	3226671	It came out last month.
3226751	3227952	Or actually it came out in March.
3228032	3228352	DarkSakura.com
3254496	3258299	Going on to the Nintendo Wii, also the FIFA World Cup South Africa game.
3258419	3261161	Other than that, not a whole lot coming out.
3261221	3268485	PlayStation 2 gets Daisen Ryaku, Daitua Kobushi, Tora Tora Tora, where Kishu ni Seku Seri.
3268865	3270887	Yes, that is the full name of the game.
3270907	3271647	Best version.
3271767	3272508	It's the best hits.
3272828	3281033	So I think it's probably a price reduction of an existing PS2 game because are any developers really making that many games anymore?
3281053	3281533	PlayStation 2?
3281573	3281834	Yeah.
3282194	3282414	Yeah.
3282714	3284956	Very few, but they're still coming.
3285356	3287297	Basically looks like your Ace Combat clone.
3287777	3289839	So that's what you have on the PlayStation 2.
3290379	3295082	And then lastly, looking at the handhelds and the PSP, you also have the World Cup South Africa game.
3295922	3300905	Hakyoki Yugi Roku comes out as well on the DS and the PS.
3300945	3304468	I'm sorry, that's just the PSP where that is coming out.
3304848	3306489	I got my handhelds mixed up.
3307109	3309491	I don't know what the point is there though.
3309531	3311733	They don't say a lot about it.
3322603	3331185	So lastly on the DS, Trick DS Han Kakushi Kami no Sumo-Kan is supposed to come out this week.
3331345	3334086	It's known as Trick, and it's from Konami.
3334686	3337547	So I don't know if this game's about getting tricks or what.
3337607	3343828	No, I think it's kind of like a survival horror, but one of those slower-paced adventure games.
3343948	3350490	Imagine if something like Ace Attorney was a survival horror game.
3351070	3352511	That's what trick kind of looks like to me.
3352751	3354991	I think it's ghost trick is what's coming out over here.
3355091	3356312	Ah, okay.
3356612	3361534	And yes, and the reason why it looks like the Ace Attorney series, it's the same guy that's doing the artwork for it.
3361654	3363054	Aha, so it's not just coincidence.
3363074	3364935	Yeah, it is coming out over here as ghost trick later on.
3365335	3365935	From Capcom.
3366775	3368296	That's it for Japan, Dark Sakura.
3369491	3373013	Well, for Europe, we have a few things.
3373173	3379957	On the 11th, we've got Age of Conan, Rise of the Godslayer, Lost Planet 2 for Xbox 360 and PS3.
3380197	3390443	On the 14th, we have Alan Wake, Naruto Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Skate 3.
3391583	3392444	That's about it.
3393985	3394405	All right.
3395330	3399631	Just a couple more news stories for you guys, then we're going to get into the classic game of the week.
3400611	3401712	But for now, some more news.
3402852	3404652	Yes, there was a countdown.
3405652	3419076	Well, apparently if you got the platinum trophy on God of War 3, it gave you a link to a website run by Ready at Dawn teasing a new God of War game.
3419256	3422156	Well, the new God of War game is going to be a PSP exclusive.
3422216	3424137	It's called God of War Ghosts of Sparta.
3424817	3429298	and it is also being developed by Ready at Dawn and looks pretty awesome.
3429438	3431779	No word exactly on when it's going to be coming out.
3432119	3434300	Probably something that will show around at E3.
3436281	3442822	But they were saying that it's going to feature save-the-art visuals and high-quality environments and characters.
3442882	3449184	In addition, the Ghost of Sparta will offer 25% more gameplay than its PSP predecessor.
3449204	3449184	25%?!
3449925	3451145	That's almost a fourth!
3453877	3482485	and judging by the screenshots though it does look pretty good and I'd say it's actually really good for a PSP game but I remember the God of War game Chains of Olympus looked pretty awesome on the PSP played quite a bit of that one and probably have to check this out I haven't gotten a PSP game in a long time really need to check out LittleBigPlanet 2 on PSP I think that might be cool so I think they had some new levels in that alright
3484039	3485140	He sounds so speculative.
3485900	3491444	Well, I had to find my PSP because I have like I have a few PSPs.
3491724	3494245	I can't remember if I have one that still has an official firmware on it.
3494385	3495106	I don't think I do.
3497107	3504812	Salacious Pop in chat says the first PSP God of War had A++++ visuals and gameplay but damn was the story milk toast and lame.
3506093	3507794	I like when people can use the word milk toast.
3507994	3511336	I have not heard that used in a sentence in a very long time.
3511556	3515100	The last time I actually saw anything with milk toast in it was reading Bloom County.
3532300	3539782	That forum had a little contest, I guess you could say, a little Photoshopping contest about what would Mario look like if it was released today?
3540383	3548065	And some of the results are really funny because you get kind of the achievement unlocked, you know, hey, you got a one-up, five gamerscore.
3548816	3567414	tutorial levels built in you know just kind of like they're doing with the new Mario games my favorite absolutely was the one that made it look like a Facebook game you squashed a Goomba achievement and then it says do you want to post this to your wall you just got an achievement Super Mario Brothers so and so just got the Goomba Squisher achievement and wants everyone to know
3568942	3570984	And I thought that was so on point.
3571545	3572866	So on point.
3573567	3575709	I mean, if you think about it, that's already there.
3576710	3578472	And I'm just as guilty as the next guy.
3578812	3583677	PS3 will post your achievements to your wall.
3583717	3585699	Remember when everybody was kind of talking about that feature?
3585719	3587000	I mean, I'm sure some of you blocked it.
3587400	3591865	But, you know, when I unlock trophies in Super Street Fighter, my wall knows about it.
3593226	3595187	Yeah, except for those of us that blocked him.
3595508	3599130	Alan runs that Raptor thing, and every day I can see he's playing World of Warcraft.
3599170	3603693	And so I know if that thing doesn't publish one day, I should probably make sure he's okay.
3608799	3614282	Alright, anyhow, kind of neat to see some of the concepts of what would happen if Mario was released today.
3615682	3618684	Any ideas on how it might be different if Mario was released today?
3622186	3626848	I think we know what Mario would be like if it's released today, because we keep getting Mario games.
3628513	3630034	And yeah, they have the tutorial levels in there.
3630334	3634497	And the reason why is because people nowadays don't want to spend the time to read the manual.
3637880	3639981	Granted, I think that's a good idea.
3640261	3649768	But I know a lot of stuff now is coming out digitally and stuff, so there isn't really necessarily manuals for it.
3649808	3653310	But if you think about it, though, if you just want to jump into a game and play it,
3654611	3658195	Then, you know, back then you could do that and there's no wasting time.
3659036	3662720	If you don't understand what's going on or you have difficulty, then you can refer to the manual.
3663081	3667325	Yeah, but think about like some of the greatest games from the 80s that were all like the coin-op games.
3667626	3668707	You don't have a manual.
3668827	3670489	You should be able to just put in a quarter and play.
3670629	3672191	The button says fire.
3672852	3674433	That means fire.
3675254	3684078	Well, also, I mean, there are a lot of times you would have either like a little brief tutorial, and I mean like five to ten second tutorial in the beginning.
3684358	3684618	That's cool.
3684638	3686559	Like some of the Neo Geo games would say, okay, here's what you do.
3687099	3692341	And there would be instructions on the cabinet so that, you know, okay, you know, 500 points gives me an extra life.
3692721	3697263	And, you know, if I hit, you know, fire and jump together, I get a special attack.
3697363	3698283	Or like Street Fighter 2.
3699144	3703765	When they started making the newer cabinets, they would actually put on there little things that had all the moves on them.
3703966	3704186	Yeah.
3704206	3704506	Yeah.
3706127	3729609	you can actually do that with some of the Neo Geo games that are out on Xbox Live like I know Fatal Fury Special you can actually have the background just show that old little plastic card that has the moves on it pretty cool alright let's get into a segment here on the show we do every week and it's a lot of fun because we get to talk about old stuff
3731715	3733016	It's a classic game of the week.
3733316	3745265	DarkSakura is going to dive into the vault and pull out a classic video game that she thinks, you know what, you ungrateful little kids out there, you should try a classic game and know your roots a little better.
3745525	3745866	Do it!
3745886	3746666	Where you came from.
3746806	3747126	Do it!
3747227	3747807	Do it!
3748087	3749889	Alright, so what game should they be playing this week?
3750029	3750549	Final Fantasy 2.
3750609	3754252	You mean actual Final Fantasy 2.
3754292	3755613	The actual Final Fantasy 2.
3756594	3758455	Which I actually own the cartridge of, by the way.
3759096	3759576	Very nice.
3759656	3764259	Let's actually take a look here at some of the music from Final Fantasy II, if we can.
3768401	3774185	I actually had the number that I gave you on that was to the battle music.
3774265	3777086	A little hard to get to the exact right point on YouTube, sorry.
3779148	3782269	At any rate, this is the theme, you know.
3783030	3783750	Now you can skip up.
3784030	3784251	Anyway.
3785431	3793136	Final Fantasy 2 was actually pretty innovative on an innovative sequel to the last Final Fantasy.
3793997	3794837	Well, to the first one.
3796598	3807805	It's, of course, like every Final Fantasy with a fresh number is, it's a different series of characters, a different world, a different dimension.
3809146	3818288	Um, so, um, this one is, there's these four people that are killed in an army invasion in Palamecia.
3818929	3822129	And three of the characters join a rebellion and the other one turns out missing.
3822349	3822950	Ooh.
3823730	3830511	So, um, with this one, it actually brought in a lot of stuff that we, you know, take for granted now in a Final Fantasy game.
3831032	3832312	Like Chocobos.
3833153	3833774	and Sid.
3834576	3835618	There's always a Sid.
3835779	3836440	Correct.
3837001	3841953	A lot of people assumed that Chocobos were in the very first game as well as Sid and those didn't appear until two.
3842722	3844023	No, you are right, Rob.
3844504	3846545	It also got rid of experience point leveling.
3849628	3851690	And, of course, the later ones used it.
3851770	3861818	But it used a system where statistics increased depending on how you use the character or how you acquire, I guess.
3863059	3865902	Keep in mind, when I first started playing this game back in the day...
3866582	3869966	I was playing a ROM in Japanese, and I kind of gave up.
3870106	3872929	I played through a bit more of 3 than I did of 2.
3874411	3875953	But I'm really enjoying it now.
3876253	3879016	Well, the best way to level is to beat your friends, basically.
3879937	3880939	Well, anyway.
3885584	3886225	It's actually...
3887905	3893929	was kind of... Well, you know, they were gonna do this one, Rob.
3894850	3900854	Nintendo actually has... What you're looking at now for our YouTube thing is off the prototype that Nintendo did.
3901114	3901395	Oh, wow.
3901955	3904257	So that's where they got the prototype translation.
3905637	3913823	This one had another really cool thing, as you can see on the video now, Rob, where you have a memory system where you can...
3916785	3931279	a keyword will pop up and you can ask to learn the keyword and once you learn the keyword you can go talk to different people and if it gives you the opportunity to ask them you can use a different keyword and they'll give you new information based on using that keyword
3932080	3940044	Like, the first one that you get in, you know, right when you join the rebellion is, I think it's Wild Rose.
3940304	3942365	And you can go around and you say, Wild Rose!
3942445	3943146	To random people.
3943566	3946447	And they're like, I'm really... Or Ivy in this prototype.
3947188	3948828	I'm really not a senile old man.
3949069	3950049	I'm a super blacksmith.
3950389	3952470	That's why I'm hanging out at the blacksmith shop.
3952931	3953211	Anyway.
3954498	3956800	I don't want them to think I'm anything other than a silly old man.
3957860	3963263	So the characters in here, and actually, I don't remember that the characters had... Do the characters have names?
3964364	3966826	The Warriors of Light have names in the Japanese version?
3966846	3967786	Because I don't think they did.
3968687	3973529	I think you could just name them and they had default names, kind of like how it works here.
3973630	3982295	In the US one, well, there was, you know, Fighter, you know, BL Mage, you know, or B Mage or whatever.
3984637	3990443	This one, the characters, you have Firion, or Frianiel in the Japanese version.
3990583	3995588	And then you've got Maria, Guy, who, when they brought this out on PlayStation, his name was Gus.
3996529	3999032	And Leon, in the Japanese version, his name was Leonhard.
3999973	4000773	And then, um...
4001434	4003395	You spend a lot of the game looking for Leon, by the way.
4004856	4011761	You can also get other people that hang out with you from time to time in your party, like Gordon and Joseph and Layla.
4012341	4014682	Meanwoo, the PlayStation version was Meendoo.
4015563	4016784	And Richard Highwind.
4016864	4018945	Are we noticing themes that come up in later games?
4019105	4021487	Highwind, you know, Leonheart.
4023028	4023608	Sound familiar?
4023628	4024629	A little bit.
4026716	4032918	Um, again, this is one that really, really, you know, set a big theme.
4033118	4043642	And also, of course, Furion and Matthias, who is the Emperor, um, the bad guy in the game, uh, they both were in Dissidia, um, as their versus each other character.
4044822	4051085	And, um, but I'm not really gonna go too much into the story.
4051305	4054726	The other thing, though, about this, another class that this introduced was the Dragoon.
4056765	4057966	The Dragoon and the Dark Knight.
4057986	4061269	You could sort of get kind of a Dark Knight.
4062630	4065412	This had Dark Knights and Dragoons in them.
4066533	4071278	A lot more story driven, a lot more character driven too than the previous versions.
4072138	4074980	As far as, well, the previous version, I should say.
4076901	4094830	Now, another thing is that it did have re-releases, and I was really irritated because I was waiting for Final Fantasy 3 to come out on the WonderSwan Color, because I have the remake of the first Final Fantasy on the WonderSwan Color, which was beautiful, it was gorgeous.
4095670	4098311	Final Fantasy 2 came out and I was like, I didn't play too much of it.
4098351	4100873	I was waiting for Final Fantasy 3 and then they went right to 4.
4102654	4114219	But they did a collection re-release for the PlayStation in 2002 that was based off the Game Boy Advance re-release of Final Fantasy 1 and 2, Dawn of Souls.
4114819	4119101	And then it came out on mobiles later and then the PSP version in 2007.
4119682	4124064	And then the Japanese Wii Virtual Console got a version last year on June 16th.
4126391	4137658	Now, what I think is super cool, and this makes me really happy, is that we've had other releases now.
4137718	4140960	Final Fantasy Origins was the first release outside of Japan.
4143981	4146803	But it came out on iPhone.
4147543	4149525	And I have been digging it on iPhone.
4150385	4156290	And I think part of it for me was not being able to read all that well when I was playing it the first time.
4156830	4160893	But now that I'm actually playing it in English, I'm having a pretty good time playing it.
4160953	4167058	The iPhone controls are interesting, but it's really, I think, as good as they can expect to do those controls.
4167118	4168459	It actually works fairly well.
4170180	4185470	Um, the way that it sold in 2003, um, well, by March 31st, 2003, with all of its re-releases, had 1.28 million copies worldwide, and, uh, with 1.08 million of those in Japan.
4186831	4190954	Um, it's just, it's a really good game.
4191014	4192395	I suggest everyone play it, so...
4205687	4220558	Final Fantasy 2 is your classic game of the week and it's available originally on the NES but probably a little more accessible on some of those redone versions the Dark Sakura earlier referenced most commonly the PSP these days and the iPhone versions so check it out Final Fantasy 2
4221499	4227522	Alright, we're going to go ahead and use this opportunity to take a quick break, but when we come back we have plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4227582	4238508	We're going to talk about some of the fan films that have hit the internet, a new Bomani game, and a new non-Bomani game, but might as well be a Bomani game, and talk a little bit about a game called Babymaker.
4238788	4240569	Yes, that's right, Babymaker.
4241170	4245132	So we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, so stick around.
4251656	4256601	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, this 366th episode of our show.
4257041	4259664	May 9th, 2010, already in progress.
4259704	4266310	We're here for Part B. More news, fast topics, and all that fun stuff in a few weeks here at Orange Lounge Radio.
4266511	4267692	E3 is going to be...
4268132	4270314	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
4294151	4296154	Anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news.
4296174	4301002	We have some fast stuff we like to call Rapid Fire Topics and Loki's gonna start it off.
4303285	4303566	I hope.
4303908	4304449	Yes, I am.
4304469	4305650	Hey, there you are.
4305670	4306371	So it's kind of cool.
4307071	4311135	Even though the game's not out yet, they're already talking about download content for Red Dead Redemption.
4311736	4316000	And the first piece of download content is going to be coming shortly after its release in June.
4316601	4321086	And it will be getting a free co-op expansion, which is kind of cool.
4321106	4325951	They're going to have some new, I guess, I'm not sure these are missions.
4326431	4328713	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4345588	4374290	and AmiMission which the Mexican army has I guess a town under siege and you have to storm the gates under heavy cannon fire and that sounds kind of cool and those are going to be compatible with up to two to four players and doesn't say exactly when they'll be coming out in June but sometime during June also they're saying that they're going to be having some more two more additional download content updates over the summer
4375431	4377493	However, those are unlikely to be free.
4379954	4381495	Pricing, I guess, will be announced later on.
4383797	4391862	And then, of course, in May, we've got some more songs becoming available for Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero.
4393303	4400187	Starting off with May 6th, the Classic Rock Track Pack 3, which you can get the whole pack for 440 Microsoft Points, or $5.49.
4400227	4400287	And
4404790	4414535	Regular Money, and that includes Jukebox Hero by Foreigner, Sweet Home Alabama by Leonard Skinner, and Take the Money and Run by the Steve Miller Band.
4414875	4415275	Wow.
4416036	4417496	I love that song.
4417577	4423620	There's a Guitar Hero pack coming out with Foreigner, Skinner, and Steve Miller Band.
4424900	4434807	That's like the county fair pack right there.
4435167	4441151	I was driving home from the bay today, and you have to drive through the middle of nowhere to get between San Francisco and Sac, right?
4441531	4444053	And sure enough, come into Dixon, the Dixon County Fair.
4444573	4445214	Foreigner!
4447735	4455661	and also of course the Classic Brock track pack was available on May 6th.
4455721	4459003	Of course it will not be available for the PlayStation 3 until May 11th.
4460804	4464627	Also on May 11th, the Alternative Pop track pack coming out.
4465027	4466048	Same pricing there.
4466448	4474053	Including with that would be Facedown by AlphaRev, Lode by Capra, and You're All I Have by Snow Patrol.
4475334	4482999	Those are also available for 160 Microsoft Points each or 200 Wii Points, $2, real money.
4483399	4490164	And then finally, the Aerosmith track pack, which includes Livin' on the Edge, Lovin' in an Elevator, and Ragdoll.
4490184	4490824	Wait, wait, wait.
4490864	4493006	Didn't Aerosmith have like a Guitar Hero game?
4493246	4499049	They may have with all those tracks in there, but hey, if you don't have those... Why not buy them all over again?
4499590	4500110	Why not?
4500410	4500951	Exactly.
4501951	4502252	So...
4504309	4504929	Thanks for watching!
4522781	4523882	That's already been confirmed.
4524162	4524663	Well, whatever.
4524963	4537711	Anyways, other stuff that's coming out on the Xbox Live Marketplace in May, including, let's see here, May 17th, the deal of the week will be Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition.
4537731	4540173	You're going to be able to get that for half off for $5.
4540833	4543055	They're also going to have some Avatar items as well.
4543495	4548478	Lee Chuck Pirate Hat for $0.50 and Avatar Cotton Swab.
4548519	4550280	Yes, the giant cotton swab for
4552781	4553462	I guess a dollar.
4554902	4555863	Okay.
4556343	4559265	You know, that's more expensive than an actual cotton swab, by the way.
4559505	4560766	You paid a whole dollar for that?
4561366	4563047	No, I wouldn't pay for that.
4563327	4564728	But yeah, that's what they're asking for.
4565588	4567009	New games on demand are going to be coming out.
4567629	4570331	Last week we had Brothers in Arms, Hell's Highway, and Prince of Persia.
4571952	4586819	This week on the 11th we have Tom Clancy's End War May 18th in the Asian region Command & Conquer 3 And on May 25th Battlefield 2 Modern Combat will be available in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand only
4587139	4591802	Well, I was going to say, when did they start doing new games on demand every week?
4591902	4594344	But they're not really doing new games on demand every week.
4594364	4595765	It's just different regions are getting it.
4596005	4596305	Okay.
4597306	4602169	Last week we had Xenoclash Ultimate Edition for $15, 1200 Microsoft points, and Raystorm HD also for $15.
4602209	4602749	It's like $15 and new $10.
4602789	4603230	I don't know.
4609074	4614098	This week on May 12th, Rocket Knight Adventures will be coming out for $15 or 1,200 Microsoft points.
4614699	4623948	And on June 2nd, which technically isn't May, even though this is a May list, and technically isn't a game I care about, Snoopy Flying Ace coming out for $10.
4624228	4625489	Guess what?
4625569	4627731	That's $10 more than you should really pay for that.
4628272	4629833	Will Snoopy be fighting the Red Baron?
4630194	4632236	Oh, probably, because that's all he ever does.
4633117	4633597	Get over it!
4633637	4634859	That was World War II!
4634919	4637964	Will Woodstock be in there to talk in his little lines?
4638845	4639966	I always loved Woodstock's speech.
4641514	4641854	I don't know.
4643515	4648676	And then the Avatar Marketplace will be getting some Final Fantasy XIII and Gamer items.
4649277	4653298	I wonder if those Final Fantasy XIII items were the same ones that you got for registering the game.
4653978	4654238	Don't know.
4655219	4660941	Army of Two and Kingdom for Kefling items will be available May 13th as well.
4661321	4662601	Finally, download content.
4663261	4669524	No Doubt is getting the Tragic Kingdom album for Rock Band, which I think that came out last week.
4669624	4670884	Yeah, we talked about it last week.
4672445	4692041	Lips is getting the Miley Cyrus song pack and Forza Motorsports 3 is getting the exotic car pack Super Street Fighter 4 is getting the Super Shuriken pack and Dragon Age Origins is getting the Darkspawn Chronicles pack as well
4692461	4699484	and also sometime, they didn't say when, Magic Gathering Duels of the Planeswalker will be getting a second expansion pack.
4700085	4715092	You know, speaking of Snoopy and all that stuff, when Loki was reading a lot of those releases, you know, those really exciting releases for the month of May, this is kind of what I was hearing was a lot of, you know, the teacher from Charlie Brown. ...
4718837	4719698	He said my name.
4719798	4722502	Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.
4722522	4725145	Wah, wah, wah, wah.
4725265	4725886	Okay, Ms.
4725906	4726447	Trombone.
4728945	4729725	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4759478	4760619	You can check it out.
4761119	4765903	Apparently it was already at San Diego Comic Con, but now it's there in 15 levels.
4766844	4768665	You get to blow stuff up.
4768705	4769266	Have fun.
4771247	4774650	Also, some new developments in the silver lining.
4775911	4777032	Drama that's going on.
4777052	4780795	You might remember the silver lining, because we actually had them on our show a while ago.
4781355	4789361	It was this fan project for a King's Quest 9, basically, but at the end of the day, they had to take the King's Quest name off of it if they wanted to actually release the game.
4789982	4794125	And then when Activision got the rights to the game, they were like, well, you're not releasing that game.
4794605	4797047	And they were like, but boo-hoo, we spent so many years making it.
4797507	4798468	Well, here's the deal.
4799028	4804492	Apparently, I guess it has come full circle that it might actually...
4805353	4807315	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4829697	4830297	Thanks for watching!
4851505	4871011	you can check that out Kotaku ran this story on what was this May 3rd was the date that they ran it and kind of this whole little epic piece about it and yeah Activision I guess finally getting in touch with them realizing they are being dicks got the big stick out their butt Bobby Kotek clearly was not involved
4872158	4893290	also coming out on the Wii soon a very exciting game called My Fireplace that is if the ESRB is to be believed there will be a game called My Fireplace and you'll be able to actually you know have your own fireplace you can put logs on the fire and decorate the mantle and pump air in the fireplace to keep it going that better be free
4895020	4897481	Sadly, it's probably WiiWare.
4897641	4900763	I would guess it's probably going to be $10 WiiWare.
4900783	4902904	People do buy those fireplace DVDs.
4903444	4904324	And Blu-rays now.
4904724	4906925	Didn't Xbox have one of those last year?
4907366	4908206	A fireplace sim?
4908866	4918551	I think an Xbox fireplace sim is the more appropriate console for that, being that it can put out the heat of a fireplace as well.
4918631	4922973	Yeah, the Wii fireplace thing deserves to be in the fireplace.
4923713	4924454	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4948806	4954130	Seriously, 77 degrees Celsius, your Intel processor chips don't run that hot.
4954950	4958333	Real quick before we get to DarkSakura's story, some comments from our chat room.
4959133	4963036	Some of the folks in chat, our DJ Dark Knight says, Can't wait for Rocket Knight.
4963156	4964777	And Actdeft says, Rocket Knight, awesome.
4964797	4967959	So I guess there is at least one game to look forward to in May.
4968860	4975204	And ToyGak commenting on the Wii Fireplace says, Fucking shitty WiiWare can go choke on a piece of my anatomy.
4976724	4977505	Elbow Porkchop
4993257	4996340	Star Trek Adventures Year One Fan Project Fan Project
5015660	5025163	It looks along the lines of old school Star Trek games, like maybe from the mid to late 90s, possibly.
5025724	5026024	Anyway...
5027992	5039421	You can go to the official homepage for the project, which is just Star Trek Adventures All In Word dot com slash year one.
5040182	5041323	See if you like it.
5041423	5041823	Let us know.
5041883	5042364	I won't play it.
5042384	5043224	I've got Star Trek online.
5044165	5047548	And the next story, which is one that Rob gave me the wrong link to and I had to go find.
5047853	5048713	Oh, I'm sorry, my bad.
5049573	5050854	Yeah, you sound so sad.
5050894	5052794	I'm sorry you had to do work tonight, Jamie.
5052974	5054395	I'm very sorry to inconvenience you.
5054415	5054735	I do work.
5055755	5056935	Sid Meier's Pirates.
5057935	5058476	Arr!
5058976	5061616	Plundering, shooting.
5061716	5062777	Plundering the booty.
5062857	5063897	Keelhauling.
5065717	5071459	It will be on the Wii in the fall and has, so it's got some minigames.
5071479	5072879	It's put up by 2K China.
5072899	5073979	Ooh.
5074479	5076540	With streamlined controls for the Wiimote.
5078200	5078580	Ooh.
5079441	5084382	And so the minigames, the two new ones would be Bombardment and Lockpicking.
5085762	5085982	Ooh.
5086202	5090023	And you can have character and ship customization options.
5091624	5091864	Ooh.
5092224	5092444	Anyway.
5093824	5097245	And last but never least, except in this case, Rock Band.
5097925	5099846	We will be getting stuff.
5101166	5129756	mostly actually all consisting of the Judas Priest British Steel 30th Anniversary Complete Album Pack which will be 1200 points or $14.99 US dollars including on it Breaking the Law Breaking the Law and Rapid Fire Metal Gods Grinder United Living After Midnight Midnight You Don't Have to Be Old to Be Wise The Rage and Stealer but you know it's all for me
5130456	5132356	Breaking the law, breaking the law.
5132757	5135117	Or washing the dog, washing the dog.
5136317	5136718	Wow.
5137278	5138018	You remember that?
5138678	5138938	Yes.
5139838	5141059	And I tried very hard to forget.
5141659	5145380	That was like my favorite episode of Beavis and Butthead.
5145780	5149741	You know, they put the dog in the dryer, then they put Beavis in the dryer.
5151341	5152661	I threw up on the dog.
5153081	5154182	I threw up on you.
5154562	5156942	My favorite episode of Beavis and Butthead was with the gym teacher.
5157302	5159103	Today we're going to talk about the penis.
5160413	5162094	and then we'll talk about the vagina.
5162434	5165456	I think I played that clip on OLR a few weeks ago.
5165476	5166277	Yeah, I loved it.
5166397	5167218	That was my favorite episode.
5167238	5168098	You should play that again soon.
5168238	5169159	You want me to play that again soon?
5169179	5169879	Play that again now.
5170560	5172061	Well, it's going to take me a minute to find it.
5172521	5173642	Soon.
5173742	5174242	You know what?
5174342	5177524	Just randomly later in the show, I'll play that clip from Beavis and Butthead.
5177544	5179806	You won't know when, but it will happen.
5179906	5181787	It'll be during one of my stories, I'm sure.
5183648	5184549	This will be Matt.
5185109	5188472	And yeah, this game's gonna come out and it's probably gonna suck.
5188952	5190813	And today we're talking about the penis!
5191494	5196718	What?
5197018	5198859	What do you think of my Loki impression?
5198979	5199740	I have the wah-wah-wah.
5199760	5200440	It was very good.
5200941	5201621	I think it was pretty spot on.
5201641	5202162	A little more anger.
5202182	5202982	A little more anger.
5203122	5207886	No, I was going for disinterested yet snarky.
5211772	5212813	That's me, alright.
5213634	5214975	Hey, Loki, heart, heart, heart.
5215175	5216156	Needs more Smashburger.
5217057	5217917	Twitter topics!
5218178	5218938	Yay!
5219018	5221641	Twitter, saving the show from being a complete train wreck.
5221701	5224043	Hey, every week we take your tweets.
5224503	5227326	Show us your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.
5227386	5228687	Blue Swim starts us off tonight.
5229628	5238656	OLR, if you could only have one CD or album to listen to forever while killing the undead after the zombie apocalypse, what would it be?
5242103	5244505	Oh, one album left ever?
5245265	5248528	Yes, while killing the undead after the zombie apocalypse.
5248928	5256874	See, for me that changes it, because that's not asking like my Desert Island CD, but you're asking what CD am I going to kill all the zombies to after the apocalypse.
5256894	5258395	That kind of changes my answer a little bit.
5259191	5287812	um I would have to you know for me because I'll listen to his custom CDs anyway um I'd actually I'd have one of two now if I was just watching the zombies it would definitely be the soundtrack to Shaun of the Dead but if I'm out there killing them it would be Anthrax's Attack of the Killer Bees just so I can put uh bring the noise on repeat and just wail on zombies with crowbar and remember Rob double tap
5288832	5298395	Mine would be the soundtrack to Lost Highway, which was a completely screwed up movie that had a great soundtrack that would be great for zombie killing.
5298875	5300516	Loki, do you have a zombie killing CD?
5300616	5302756	I don't know.
5305417	5308138	Bochikawa says, I'd have to do zombie killing to Space Channel 5.
5308698	5310519	Hey, I put Mexican Flyer in Cage March once.
5312546	5313247	I don't really know.
5313267	5317209	I don't have any albums that would necessarily be good for zombie killing.
5318050	5322453	I guess... I don't know.
5322533	5322933	No ideas?
5323134	5324575	Alright, fine.
5324595	5327116	We can do the Top Gun soundtrack because that would be funny.
5327237	5328417	There you go, Top Gun soundtrack.
5328477	5328978	I like that idea.
5328998	5331680	I head to the danger zone.
5332020	5334822	BOOM!
5337044	5338825	Take my breath away.
5339065	5339745	BANG!
5341400	5343122	Eat your brains away.
5343182	5344683	Bam!
5344723	5346365	We used to have... I have to tell you.
5347266	5349107	I'll tell you the funny story about Becky's son.
5349308	5350449	Because it's sort of related to that.
5350569	5350829	Okay.
5351289	5351770	Please.
5353452	5355113	I was just playing with Julian and we were talking.
5355153	5356675	I was like, what's in your head?
5356695	5359918	I was like, he's like, brains.
5360878	5361079	Yeah.
5361099	5362700	I was like, what are your brains like?
5362720	5363241	Space.
5363621	5364221	Spicy!
5364541	5368663	I think I'm gonna have to go with Maze Satsuma, Rob Zombie.
5369743	5370203	Dude!
5370603	5374104	No, no, it would have to be the old school white zombie album from 93.
5374364	5375925	Oh god.
5376345	5378285	More human than human!
5378586	5380006	More human than human!
5380627	5381007	Seriously?
5381027	5382489	That's my white zombie impression.
5382549	5383951	Kind of sounds like an angry St.
5383971	5384332	Bernard.
5384953	5390861	Okay, SSJ100Matt says, Blues Brothers themed for when you're driving.
5391542	5393585	And then Frisbee says, blow my parts away.
5396769	5398710	You guys are kind of weird in chat.
5398750	5399150	But you know what?
5399230	5402452	Actually, I know what music would be perfect.
5403093	5407475	Would be just absolutely perfect for Loki to be killing to.
5408356	5412318	I believe he would have to have this old soundtrack and would kill the zombies to this.
5414479	5415399	That's a sexy party song.
5415419	5416260	That's a sexy party song.
5425467	5429669	I would play any video game with this as the theme song.
5429689	5433311	Yaris 2, Future Rain, Benny Hill.
5433932	5436493	Was there ever a Benny Hill video game?
5436613	5445197	You know what, the weirdness in my brain just went from show theme to show theme to show theme, imagining killing zombies to.
5445238	5447018	And you know what I finally settled on, Rob?
5447679	5448339	The facts of life.
5453544	5455545	You take the good, you take the bad.
5456446	5459908	Could you imagine just be skipping along with your Uzi?
5466611	5468012	Oh, I was trying to play it for you guys.
5468412	5470653	Stupid YouTube is like too quiet sometimes.
5470673	5470994	Let's try.
5471014	5472054	So, okay.
5472074	5473015	Killing zombies to this.
5473075	5473415	Here we go.
5478075	5479638	Oh, this is the stupid pilot episode.
5479658	5480259	This doesn't work.
5480339	5480700	Damn it.
5480981	5483285	How hard is it to find the stupid Facts of Life theme song?
5483345	5483766	Christ.
5483786	5484407	There you go.
5487673	5488014	Here we go.
5490177	5495140	That was, like, later in the series, right before it stopped being a girl's school.
5495220	5497601	When they, like, sized down most of the cast.
5497661	5498061	Aw, Tootie.
5498081	5499522	There was a... She was such a bitch.
5499562	5499782	Anyway.
5520037	5523021	I bet Bluestone had no idea his question would turn into this.
5523602	5526906	X-Link said I would use a song that Betty White sang last night on SNL.
5528208	5529510	Let's move to the next topic, Rob.
5529570	5530150	Yes, please, please.
5530591	5531873	We could listen to old theme songs all night.
5532253	5533154	Although, one more.
5533795	5535838	Frisbee says Having a Wonderful Time by Tiny Tim.
5537182	5537463	All right.
5537703	5540426	And now a couple of chatters are asking, what about the Golden Girls theme?
5540487	5541007	All right.
5541488	5544832	MissingNo64 is asking, we need to go back to Twitter topics, please.
5544993	5546454	Can we all get in the right state of mind, please?
5546535	5548958	Let me play the music.
5549078	5550360	Get you back into Twitter topic mood.
5551843	5555284	MissingNo wants to know, did you ever put up the PAX East All Games mini show?
5555544	5557684	I thought I did, but maybe not.
5558304	5559485	I know it aired on All Games.
5559525	5560085	Fail!
5560745	5562025	Did I really never put that up?
5562065	5562605	Maybe I didn't.
5562885	5563466	Fail!
5563586	5563866	Oops.
5564546	5565006	My bad.
5565746	5566826	We'll have to take care of that.
5567046	5567426	Let me know.
5567507	5573348	I don't... Somebody like DarkTetsuya or Tigerclaw or somebody that knows this show or Misty would know if I put that up or not.
5573428	5576789	So I will... Maybe I do need to put it up.
5576849	5577389	I thought I did.
5577929	5578189	Oops.
5578289	5578389	Oops.
5579585	5589392	Actdeft sends us a link to Obama chat, and yes, this has to do with games, because apparently during a grad speech, he actually was kind of dissing video games a little bit.
5591173	5604101	He apparently was speaking at Hampton University in Virginia and saying, quote, You're coming of age in a 24-7 media environment that bombards us with all kinds of content and exposes us to all kinds of arguments, some of which don't always rank all that high on the truth meter.
5604522	5608865	With iPods and iPads and Xboxes and Playstations, none of which I know how to work,
5609585	5616827	Information becomes a distraction, a diversion, a form of entertainment rather than a tool of empowerment, rather than the means of emancipation.
5617528	5621909	All of this is not only putting new pressures on you, it's putting new pressures on our country and on our democracy.
5625490	5626071	I don't know.
5626451	5629892	I mean... I don't think he was specifically talking about just video games.
5630032	5631512	I don't take that as a slam.
5632073	5635394	I'll take that as a, turn off the console and go play outside.
5635734	5635914	Yeah.
5635934	5636014	Yeah.
5637192	5639353	And there's nothing wrong with a distraction or diversion.
5639393	5642055	I mean, even President Obama takes vacations to Hawaii.
5642295	5644476	So everybody needs a diversion every now and then.
5646097	5650219	But I think he's just saying... The president is the person you want to take vacations.
5650760	5651700	Imagine the stress.
5652881	5655883	And Blackwolf in chat is quick to point out that... Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
5656343	5658244	Obama has an iPod and a Blackberry.
5658304	5660205	He did give the Queen of England an iPod, did he not?
5661556	5663839	So I think one of his speech writers fucked up.
5664340	5665702	Oops.
5666383	5667044	That's different.
5667885	5668186	I know.
5669768	5671751	And Blackwolf says he's addicted to his Blackberry.
5673479	5679482	Well, then again, wasn't it the Prime Minister of Finland, I believe it was, or one of the area countries?
5680602	5687685	When the volcanic ash hit Europe, he was stuck in New York running country business from his iPad.
5688766	5692847	So that's more of a necessity type of thing.
5692887	5696009	I mean, even me, I'd be lost without my iPhone now because I run my life by it.
5696289	5698390	In my big fat opinion, it's not...
5701111	5701391	Right?
5702531	5707574	I mean, you can use your iPad to be completely unproductive, or you could be pretty productive with it.
5707714	5709194	It really just depends on how you use it.
5709534	5715557	You can use your iPad to play stupid video games all day, or you could use it to write a novel.
5715917	5717678	I mean, it's just however you choose to use it.
5720256	5721137	But I don't know.
5721298	5722099	I used mine for both.
5722619	5728648	It's probably more of a speech writer than it is an actual Obama quote, but whatever.
5729629	5730851	Shouldn't say it if he doesn't agree with it.
5731612	5734576	TigerClaw305 linked us to a multitude of stories.
5734656	5736259	I'm only going to pick a couple of these here.
5736699	5737521	Thanks for watching!
5752182	5756446	Definitely has that Street Fighter 4, a little bit of hybrid with Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
5756946	5777843	What I thought was most interesting was the character bio section, which seems to confirm some of the characters that will be in the game, including Dante, which I thought was pretty awesome, from Devil May Cry is there, Deadpool, it made DarkSakura squeal, of course, Iron Man, you gotta have that, because, you know, smashing box office records, or actually, no, I don't think it smashed records this weekend, but it did very well.
5778624	5784612	Felicia, Morgan, and all the hot chicks from Darkstalkers Captain America Was that from again?
5785093	5785934	Felicia and Morgan?
5786034	5789479	No, no, no The scan
5790293	5790653	Oh, I don't know.
5790673	5792293	It must be some magazine that's coming out soon.
5792333	5792693	I don't know.
5792753	5794774	He linked me to a website here that had it.
5794894	5797274	So I'm assuming it's some magazines running these screens soon.
5797294	5802635	Because if you look at some of the screenshots, you can see a little caption there.
5803055	5804356	That's some sexy stuff right there.
5804916	5806056	Looks like it'll be a pretty hot game.
5806216	5807016	So looking forward to that.
5807236	5809537	I'm assuming Spider-Man's in there since the Daily Bugle.
5809937	5810477	It's gotta be.
5811417	5815218	So big thanks to Tigerclaw for linking us to that because we were actually peeking at that before the show tonight.
5815758	5816558	Only a year away.
5817698	5820081	Now, I thought this story was definitely worth talking about.
5820101	5823224	I think some of his others we already touched on, but I wanted to definitely bring this one up.
5823725	5828570	There are some rumors going around this week that Zynga is going to split from Facebook.
5828590	5836038	And this is actually something I think Alan had brought up with me the other night, actually talking about some of the splits that were going on with...
5837159	5837720	Zynga Zynga
5852236	5855157	They are actually wanting to launch their own social gaming network.
5855337	5861678	And I think it's because there's tensions between Zynga and Facebook because... Well, Facebook just implemented these whole token things recently.
5861758	5864719	They basically want to kind of go with the Apple methodology.
5864739	5867379	You know what it had to be said because I think he was making the comparisons to the Apple thing.
5868360	5873681	This whole Apple methodology of that they want such a big cut of the profits, but maybe...
5875422	5877985	and maybe they shouldn't be entitled to that.
5878045	5878366	I don't know.
5878806	5883813	So apparently, yeah, Zynga's wanting to split off from Facebook.
5884133	5888880	However, Facebook is trying to pressure them into a long-term deal, trying to strong-arm them.
5889441	5891003	I guess there was an all-hands meeting at Zynga.
5891663	5896386	I personally think they would be completely fucking stupid to split off from Facebook.
5896786	5903550	Because if they do, they're just another Pogo.com, iWin, or one of those other game network websites.
5903630	5904851	And I don't think they're going to stick out.
5904911	5908353	I mean, yeah, they have Farmville, but people play Farmville because it's a Facebook game.
5908713	5910614	And they can use all those integrations with Facebook.
5910874	5912995	I think they would just be kind of ridiculous to do that.
5913035	5914496	They'd be committing suicide.
5915397	5917298	Not that I'd really care if they did do that.
5917598	5917718	Yeah.
5917978	5920280	Retro Rear View Retro Rear View
5938058	5939259	I like that.
5939279	5939679	I like that.
5939739	5940599	Retro Rearview.
5941039	5945121	And this week is all about, I have never fucking heard of this, the Marty.
5945721	5947182	The FM Towns Marty.
5947202	5950884	It was a Japanese computer in 1991 by Fujitsu.
5951284	5955786	And Dark to See tells us a whole lot of information about that at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
5956006	5957987	Actual content on our website, OMG.
5959307	5959888	Pretty awesome.
5959928	5962829	Thanks to all the folks that contribute at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
5964243	5968746	Twitter.com slash OLR, add us, be our friend, yay, we like friends
5988101	5989862	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6012653	6013473	So I watched it.
6013713	6017156	The positives on it, at least Ken looks like Ken in this one.
6017336	6019737	And Ryu, or Ryu, I guess.
6022019	6022799	All right, I guess.
6023140	6027122	But he looks, compared, because there were two Street Fighter short films.
6027282	6031645	Both happen to be in a forest, both with Ryu and Ken.
6033206	6035648	But props to them for nailing the appearance of Ken.
6036549	6037409	So that's pretty cool.
6038430	6039711	Ryu, not so much.
6040271	6041592	And the effects in it.
6042032	6042773	Eh, they're alright.
6044194	6047436	The other Street Fighter film... For a fan film, pretty good, I thought.
6048517	6050118	Better than anything I could do, that's for damn sure.
6050138	6063047	The one I liked better, though, was actually the Street Fighter Beginnings End, and for me, I liked the way it was shot better, and the effects were kind of cool, but Ken looks stupid, because...
6063627	6064308	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6072546	6073307	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6103091	6105372	Yeah, I watched that last night.
6125924	6146733	and Wiley was kind of weird looking but overall it was kind of cool might be fun to check it out but wish there was a little bit more polish on it I guess but hell but they're fan projects exactly it's a fan project and you know good job for them it's just you know some of the stuff just
6148234	6165716	you know some of the characters were kind of like damn I wish you know this was because they had some of those renders that people were doing for like some of the Mega Man 2 characters and it just looked awesome I just kind of wish they were doing the same thing with these guys but hey props to them it was pretty cool
6167520	6168541	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6182680	6184021	Well, apparently it is coming back.
6184382	6188606	It was originally going to come out fall of 2009 against DJ Hero, but it was delayed.
6189226	6192169	The game is now set to come out on June 26th in Europe.
6192429	6193290	Hey, that's my birthday.
6194091	6204440	No word about a North American release yet, so I should state this is right now a Europe-only game, which makes sense because unfortunately this type of music has a much better following over there than it does here.
6204580	6208164	So, I don't know, I'd be a little worried if this thing would even come out over here.
6208724	6211665	There are some new screenshots that are posted of the game.
6212025	6214086	Apparently, there's no note markers.
6214166	6220589	It seems like you do more of like a twist thing where you kind of like maybe go through these tunnels and maybe point at things.
6221329	6223330	You would gesture maybe to glow.
6223410	6225511	We really don't know what the hell this game is about.
6225871	6227092	But we do have song lists.
6227392	6227672	Woohoo!
6228152	6229192	Thanks for watching!
6252940	6254501	Floatation by Vincent D'Amore.
6254521	6256363	That's one of my favorite 2DX songs they ever did.
6256703	6257664	That is going to be in this game.
6257964	6258945	So that's kind of cool.
6259085	6261466	Stringer by Riva.
6261807	6263107	Push is in the game.
6263688	6268791	There's just lots and lots of those trancy bands that you probably hear on his podcast all in this game.
6268871	6271213	So yeah, it looks pretty cool.
6271253	6274616	It's too bad that the game might only come out in Europe, but I guess since we have some...
6275496	6283844	Listeners over there, I guess you get something we don't, so I don't want to hear all that bitching about that we get all the games, because I don't know if we'll ever get that one.
6284165	6284625	We'll see though.
6286066	6287288	Anyhow, DarkSakura.
6289410	6296537	Oh yes, this is actually, and I'm debating with myself because I want them, but I'm probably not going to get them.
6297133	6306661	They are, um, they made little, um, River City Ransom characters, or as the original was, the hot-blooded downtown story.
6307241	6308242	And they're so cute!
6308622	6313206	Um, they actually were shown at the Treasure Festa show going on in Japan.
6313847	6323475	Little, um, custom kits that are, um, they have, like, the two main guys and then some of the other guys that you can beat up to.
6324495	6324896	And, um,
6325496	6326397	It's just so cute.
6326698	6328419	It's put up by Tomopop.
6330642	6331342	They're adorable.
6332524	6335667	And no, it's not River City Ransom technically.
6335687	6341673	Like I said, it's a hot-blooded downtown story, but it's got all kinds of cute little guys and it's adorable.
6343675	6344055	I want.
6345917	6346498	They look cute.
6349553	6355299	Team Fortress 2 The Engineer is finally getting its update thanks to a teaser trailer that was released.
6356460	6363288	No word exactly on what upgrades he's going to be getting, but there's a lot of stuff that if you read between the lines...
6365530	6370493	Some of the stuff that you see in the background in the video that perhaps is going to be being added.
6370993	6377177	Including, they have some sort of Iron Man type of helmet thing on the workbench.
6377517	6380199	Some sort of robotic arm in a blueprint.
6381179	6389044	So, no word exactly on when the update is coming, but it is kind of neat that they keep adding updates to this game.
6392597	6394765	Yeah, that game's like three years old at this point, isn't it?
6394966	6396311	Yeah, it's extremely old.
6398166	6398446	All right.
6398806	6406010	Well, a game that's rather new but about something, oh, very old-fashioned for all of us is a game called Babymaker Extreme.
6406470	6408851	Yes, there is a trailer out for Babymaker Extreme.
6408871	6411892	I guess the game is actually out on Xbox Live Marketplace right now.
6411912	6412693	Yeah.
6413013	6413633	Community games.
6413933	6414653	Oh, sorry.
6414673	6415214	Yeah, that's what I meant.
6415234	6415894	Community games.
6416054	6416754	Indie games, whatever.
6417375	6418935	80 Microsoft points for this game.
6419776	6424418	And let me just kind of play the trailer for you guys and describe what's going on in Babymaker Extreme.
6424498	6425758	No, it's not just sex.
6426059	6426399	Okay?
6426419	6426759	Okay.
6427099	6429301	But it is about the joy of giving birth.
6429361	6432283	In fact, you push A to experience the miracle of childbirth.
6433785	6437187	And, you know, you control your breathing in this game just like a real mother.
6437628	6440450	And you use the L-T-R-T to breathe as you go back and forth.
6440490	6441851	And that's like to build out the power.
6442392	6443893	And then you get ready to push.
6445294	6448377	And you hit B as fast as you can to get ready to push.
6448777	6450318	You just keep slamming on that B button.
6452140	6453341	And then what's next?
6454912	6475374	probably screaming for drugs and then a c-section no no it gets better well they don't show you what happens next but I believe featuring avatars I believe you push the a button and the baby goes flying through the air no featuring avatars but have you seen did you watch the whole trailer that's right you have your avatars get born out of this woman
6477788	6480870	And you can give them scuba gear and shoes and a vest.
6481030	6482431	And they go shooting.
6482471	6484852	It's like one of those rocket-like launching games, right?
6484872	6485692	Like Baby Launcher?
6485712	6487373	The baby goes flying through the air, right?
6487994	6488754	Kick the baby!
6488854	6489374	Amazing.
6489474	6490295	Don't kick the baby.
6491095	6492396	Hey, that sounds like it's worth a buck.
6493016	6494157	I know, one whole dollar.
6494477	6495338	That's just awful.
6496998	6497939	Awfully funny.
6498339	6499760	You should have my wife play it.
6499940	6500340	You should.
6501181	6502341	How far along is she now?
6502782	6504302	She is 25 weeks.
6504483	6507104	She should be kind of practicing for the big day.
6507799	6509379	DarkSakura, what's in the email bag this week?
6509419	6509720	Some crap.
6509740	6509920	Delete.
6509980	6511800	Sorry, that was system spam.
6535467	6540633	We have a few quickies through the website, so some of them are not letting us know who they are.
6540653	6541995	This one's from NerdE1.
6544317	6551185	Though Sky might appreciate checking out a web show called... Oh, he's asking about if you watch The Guild.
6552398	6553239	The Guild is cute Epic Ness
6572562	6576163	I wonder if our covers of old NES tunes might be interesting for your radio station.
6576644	6579865	We remake the music from old games and make them into rock medleys.
6580505	6582706	We have gotten quite good feedback so far.
6582786	6585147	Please visit our MySpace and tell me what you think about it.
6585247	6586067	I'll go ahead and plug it.
6586307	6587007	MySpace?
6587407	6587807	I know.
6587827	6588628	Who uses MySpace?
6588688	6591149	First off... Epicness Band.
6591529	6591869	NES.
6592782	6593503	And this last one is Shook
6611485	6613226	By the way, very excellent grammar.
6640385	6640725	I know.
6640885	6642146	Except for a few missing comments.
6642246	6648507	I think this year, the only difference between last year and this year would be that this year, we don't really know what's coming.
6649268	6664092	I mean, we have an idea with some of the stuff that they've talked about already, but I think that this year, they're keeping a lot of it kind of tight to the chest so that there's going to be a lot more surprises, whereas last year, it's kind of like, yeah, we kind of know what you're going to talk about, and there's some things, but I don't know.
6664232	6668553	Personally, I'm okay with not going to E3 this year because last year, it was just kind of, eh.
6669073	6670337	This isn't what it used to be.
6670938	6671540	I disagree.
6672162	6674347	I think our emailer couldn't be more wronger.
6675905	6700360	To use a term that DarkSakura will appreciate I think that between actually getting to do some hands-on with Natal To see what it's really like Besides just a concept Getting to get hands-on with Move Final Fantasy XIV, Rock Band 3, Portal 2 I think there's a lot of big releases this year That are kind of exciting Whereas last year there wasn't I mean, one of the bigger things there was Halo 3 ODST Which wasn't a game I was really that excited about
6701060	6706664	Also, one thing I haven't played is the Halo Reach beta, really, at all, which I guess came out this week.
6707884	6712187	I kind of don't play Halo anymore, thanks to Halo 3 wasn't that great.
6712407	6714148	So, all right.
6716029	6717770	So, oh, thank you for that, DarkSakura.
6717790	6718370	I appreciate that.
6718430	6720772	DarkSakura's taking my picture over here while I'm trying to talk.
6720792	6723413	I was poking your head with a .50 caliber bullet shell.
6723974	6724714	Nice, thank you.
6725254	6729377	And I was going to say, by the way, our youngest documented listener that I know of has actually just turned three.
6729657	6729817	Mm-hmm.
6730837	6731917	He doesn't really pay attention to us.
6731937	6732758	He just listens sometimes.
6733018	6738239	BlackWolf in our chatroom wants to point out it's also still a month away and E3 booth lists come out about a week or two before.
6738899	6739259	Who knows?
6739319	6740540	Blizzard could be back this year.
6740620	6741280	We don't know yet.
6741680	6743180	Of course, Nintendo's got the 3DS.
6743781	6748742	I'm a little antsy about the 3DS because I don't know about how 3D's going to go.
6748882	6751182	But again, I'm not going to knock it until I've tried it.
6751483	6752403	I'm just a little nervous.
6752443	6752803	That's all.
6754449	6755990	Alright, so was that it for the emails?
6756990	6757450	Um, no.
6757810	6758451	No, alright.
6759091	6761212	But I did put that picture up on the website.
6761872	6762892	Grand, thank you.
6764653	6766194	Um, it's from Rababababa.
6767234	6771216	I love the way game politics presents the story of Dave and Buster's new owners.
6771916	6772476	There's a link there.
6774457	6774897	P.S.
6775177	6777238	One of them opened up in Roseville this week.
6777498	6777758	Really?
6777938	6780779	I drove by and I did not see it, but then I didn't drive that close.
6780799	6782180	It's in the fountains.
6782200	6783100	I knew it was over there.
6783120	6785541	It's in the fountains over by... I know what we're talking about.
6785621	6786501	Yeah, it's in the back.
6786621	6788562	It's by California Peach Kitchen and all that stuff in the back.
6788802	6794824	I was looking too, because we were over at the Galleria this week, and I was like, I wonder if it's over there, and I'm like, the fountains, where's this?
6794844	6796984	Because that's how long it's been since I've been over there.
6797184	6799445	The fountains didn't exist when I went last.
6799565	6800065	It's nice.
6800145	6802206	It's a little bit too high class for me, but...
6802426	6803226	There's some nice stuff there.
6803427	6805027	But did you go to Dave & Buster's, though?
6805147	6805548	No, not yet.
6805868	6806668	Maybe we'll have to plan that this week.
6806688	6807228	Oh, we'll have to go there.
6807268	6809069	We should plan an OLR night at Dave & Buster's.
6809109	6809870	Oh, we need to go there.
6809970	6810350	Fun!
6810470	6811090	That's awesome.
6811251	6811611	Yay.
6814772	6823857	Okay, so in the middle of the GP article, it says, In a press release on its site, Oak Hill called the deal an investment in partnership with Dave & Buster's current management team.
6824217	6824497	Joke.
6825138	6827979	They soon followed with an email, By the way, you're defired.
6828219	6828699	All in leet.
6828980	6829280	End joke.
6830140	6836574	I believe this marks the beginning of a round of closing of some DMV sites because that's what the new company always does, isn't it?
6837075	6838598	It's an Arcadiapocalypse.
6838778	6840261	The Arcadiapocalypse is nigh.
6841063	6841444	Rababa.
6842239	6847022	It's kind of funny because they just opened the one here and now they're already talking about closing certain Dave and Busters.
6847362	6850384	I like that he signs his name now, Ra-ba-ba.
6851424	6852085	That's how you say it.
6852185	6853165	It is, if you think about it.
6853225	6861090	It's surprising, though, that it is in such close proximity to the Family Fun Center, you know, Golf Land.
6862030	6864812	Hopefully it makes them... And John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza is right around the corner.
6865152	6867473	Well, their arcade's kind of crap.
6868134	6870355	But I would say... They do have an Afterburner Climax.
6871337	6873819	Good for them, but I'm just saying... And an indoor rollercoaster.
6875980	6876260	They do?
6876700	6877061	Yeah.
6877081	6878642	It's for, like, little kids, but yeah.
6879182	6880023	That doesn't really count.
6881884	6886967	So, it's interesting to see, because, you know, Dave Busters has a pretty decent arcade.
6887287	6888548	Granted, there's a lot of ticket games.
6888928	6894772	I'm glad, though, I'll be able to use my two power cards that I have from, like, five years ago, which is very exciting.
6897298	6898578	Those things don't expire, do they?
6899198	6901539	I don't think so, but you might have to get it transferred.
6902159	6903220	Alright.
6903640	6907641	Sorry, DarkSakura's taking pictures over here and she keeps pointing the camera at me and I don't know why.
6908801	6910081	Because I know you'll play along.
6910341	6910621	Alright.
6912582	6914002	I'm campier than Loki.
6914903	6917723	I'm putting up a picture of me poking Rob with the nose condom.
6917863	6918223	Thank you.
6919204	6920184	The nose tampon, sorry.
6920744	6944105	So, Beavis and Butthead I understand Mr. McVicar has made a little arrangement with you guys Yeah, a little probation You see, class, Beavis and Butthead here are not allowed to laugh for a whole week
6945034	6954182	That's right, and if they do laugh, they'll be expelled and they'll have to go to Hope High School where they'll get their asses kicked on a daily basis by all the other delinquents.
6956524	6961148	Well, I was real glad to hear that because this is Sex Education Week.
6961808	6963690	That's right, Sex Ed Week.
6964892	6966673	We're going to be talking about the penis.
6967754	6969796	We'll be talking about the vagina.
6970416	6972218	Do you think that's funny, butthead?
6972518	6975921	Do you find it amusing that we'll be talking about the testicles?
6976961	6988711	Yes, we're also going to be talking about venereal disease, sexual intercourse, and we will definitely be spending a lot of time talking about masturbation.
6993707	6996091	Well, now that that's out of the way, let's take roll.
6996892	6997653	Butt kiss!
6997934	6998314	Here.
7000017	7000678	Gaylord!
7001599	7001940	Iron!
7006667	7007368	Oh, we're so mature.
7009194	7022203	I had to realize, especially after getting that email from the 13-year-old that listens to the show, a lot of you didn't grow up with Beavis and Butthead, and that kind of makes me sad for you, because Beavis and Butthead was pretty fucking amazing.
7022303	7023144	Like, it really was.
7025285	7026865	It really summed up a generation.
7026945	7027726	It really did.
7027806	7033187	Like, if you want to know what life was like for us, just go watch an old episode of Beavis and Butthead.
7033227	7034327	It's pretty summed up.
7034367	7038048	Like, back when MTV would actually play music videos and everything else.
7038668	7039168	Good stuff.
7040449	7046090	All right, let's get into a little bit of angst, because, you know, sometimes we get a little angry here on Orange Lounge Radio, and we have to do this segment.
7046130	7047270	It's just tradition for 366 weeks now.
7047290	7048191	The F-Years of the Week!
7065258	7073216	Um, F you to the sudden fifth coughing that I have and also for my finger for starting to trigger again even though I had it operated on last year.
7076449	7082613	F you to people that drift in and out of lanes, especially people that try to hit me with their car.
7083073	7090918	Also those people that like to make left turns by kind of slightly going to the right portion of their lane or outside of their lane and then making left turn.
7091359	7093620	Same goes for people that make the right turns that way as well.
7094220	7097883	And to this old grandma that we saw today who decided that, you know, the...
7099150	7099290	Hey!
7099330	7099570	Oops.
7099970	7100631	Is that it?
7100711	7101271	That's it.
7101351	7101711	Alright.
7120057	7123059	I want to say a quick F you to my teeth.
7123619	7126340	Because I went to a Mamma Mia sing-along this week.
7126841	7128281	And don't judge me.
7129102	7129882	It was a lot of fun.
7130122	7130442	Shut up.
7130662	7131063	It was great.
7131143	7132483	They did it all Rocky Horror Picture Show style.
7132723	7134944	But one of the things they did is that one of the songs is Honey Honey.
7135265	7138186	And they actually had Biddle Honey available as part of Honey Honey.
7138726	7138846	And...
7141954	7147138	I actually ate the bit of honey during Honey Honey and part of my tooth chipped off on the bit of honey.
7147619	7148359	One of my back teeth.
7148759	7154964	But I had like tons of cavities when I was a kid and I think like a lot of the fillings now that I'm like 30 are cracking out.
7155485	7156906	And I think that's exactly what happened.
7156926	7159228	I think the filling broke off and took the corner of my tooth with it.
7159728	7164852	So I'm really hoping it doesn't start to hurt because something else about me, I really hate going to the dentist.
7164892	7168014	Like I really, really hate going to the dentist.
7168034	7170096	You know what will help though if it does start to hurt wrong?
7170136	7171057	Just a natural remedy.
7172037	7172458	Chin!
7173418	7177320	Well, I'm just, you know, I can't, like, if it starts to hurt, I'm gonna have to do something about it.
7177360	7179881	You can't let it go, because it will never, like, stop hurting.
7180522	7181802	So, um, yeah.
7182343	7182963	A few to my teeth.
7185702	7187504	F you to fillings we got as kids too.
7188285	7189526	I never had a filling as a kid.
7189766	7193790	Then again, I didn't go to the dentist until I was an adult from the time I was in third grade.
7193970	7194291	Wow.
7195612	7196053	Lucky you.
7197334	7198835	Alright, that's it for the FUs of the week.
7198876	7203200	Let's get into some other stories and then we'll get into the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR
7205262	7212989	There's a new Bomani game that apparently came out back in February in Japan, of course, because I'm not over here.
7213690	7226682	And unfortunately, I didn't really know much about it, but it's a new game called Utachi, and it looks like poppin' music, but kind of like almost like a light version of poppin' music with only three buttons, because you play it in kind of like the book...
7227122	7229044	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7250280	7273378	and tap and tap and quickly slide for yellow the green notes sound a bit tricky you have to tap once and hit it's tap once it hits the bottom and then slide the stylus up and down until the note ends so it's like a new rhythm is a game and the characters definitely look like they're from poppin music it's no beat and groovy though
7276676	7280202	Yeah, it looks like it'll be better than beaten groovy, but I don't know.
7281565	7283709	I'm just not excited about these games anymore.
7283729	7285372	No, I agree.
7286937	7287798	You know what's sad though?
7288418	7298964	I think I showed you there was like a homebrew DS game that really kind of gave me an idea of how they could do like a DDR type of game on the DS and it was pretty awesome.
7299024	7311831	It involved like kind of making gestures with the stylus and just really cool the way it kind of worked but it was with like a par-a-par type of video or something that they did it with.
7312492	7314553	Still would be really cool though to implement.
7317054	7323500	Alright, well, one more story for you guys tonight, and I don't think this guy will be making a Parapara game, but you never know.
7324120	7327123	George Romero, you guys know who he is, right?
7327183	7332627	He did zombie movies, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, you know, all these awesome zombie movies.
7333608	7337392	Actually, George Romero recently talked to the website Destructoid and said...
7338052	7339033	I'd like to do a game.
7339473	7341034	I'd like to work with a gamer on it.
7341474	7345656	But everyone who has ever approached me, it's always been, sell us your name and go home.
7345856	7347577	I don't particularly want to do that.
7348317	7352439	So, yeah, and then, of course, there's the whole Dead Rising thing, which was definitely influenced.
7352459	7354540	Yeah, I think one of the companies he said he wanted to work with was Capcom.
7354560	7355961	Like, they already did it.
7356361	7356621	Yeah.
7357642	7361523	So he actually said, he admitted, I'm not a gamer, so I don't know what excites a gamer.
7361644	7362024	I don't know.
7362284	7363885	I think I could come up with a good story.
7364405	7364885	Zombies.
7364965	7365946	People like zombies.
7366046	7366526	That's right.
7368490	7377036	I'm sure you're not very familiar with the zombie phenomenon, but I'm sure if you do your research there, George Romero, that you'll be fine.
7377176	7380478	As long as he makes the right arrangement with the right game company, it'll be fine.
7380538	7385662	As long as he doesn't partner up with the wrong game company, it'll be great.
7386673	7389676	Alright, so that's it for our scripted stories tonight.
7389736	7395042	Let's go to the phones at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
7395342	7396524	We're going to take your calls.
7397064	7399487	The last few weeks have been a little dry, so I don't know what's going on.
7399847	7401489	We'll see if we actually get some phone calls tonight.
7401870	7405453	In the meantime, let's see if there's anyone that has last minute stories.
7408076	7408156	Uh...
7410549	7411990	Yeah, the small stuff.
7412871	7416494	They're doing another Xbox 360 bundle instead of the elites with two free games.
7416514	7419696	They're also going to have an Xbox 360 arcade system with two free games.
7420277	7425421	Those free games, of course, are Banjo-Kazooie and Viva Pinata, the first Viva Pinata game.
7425901	7428623	But hey, two free games is better than none.
7428783	7429904	Free games are free, so.
7430264	7431345	All right, let's go to the phones.
7431385	7431886	We have a call.
7431926	7432926	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7432946	7433307	Who's this?
7434668	7436129	It's the one and only Ranma.
7436169	7437770	How's everybody doing tonight?
7437890	7438311	Not bad.
7438351	7438691	How are you?
7440382	7444747	I'm pretty good, I just came back from a job interview, but that's not the reason why I called.
7444807	7446328	Well, good luck with that, hope it works out.
7446749	7447890	What is the reason you called tonight?
7448851	7458921	Well, before I get into it, to reiterate what was said in the chat room earlier, I'm surprised you wouldn't go around zombie killing to the theme of the Golden Girls extended remix.
7460783	7469748	Uh, you know, I just, I have to think if Push came to shove, the thing is about the Golden Girls, there was really only that one song, and that's not enough to really fill up a whole CD.
7470168	7473750	But maybe if we could somehow get that song on the soundtrack to Lost Highway, then we'd be good.
7475071	7476592	Or maybe audio clips from the show?
7478613	7480154	I don't know if I'd want to hear that.
7481334	7482375	Does that make sense?
7482655	7485016	You know we're just busting your balls because we love you, right?
7485156	7486157	No, I know, I know.
7486217	7487197	You guys are weird.
7487538	7487878	Alright, no.
7490678	7493960	I actually sat down and watched the Mega Man fan film Friday night Yeah, Friday night Uh-huh
7520087	7520587	I liked it.
7520707	7527674	I was expecting something really half-assed, rushed project, but it turned out to be much better than I thought it would be.
7528195	7531678	Without spoiling it too bad, what in a nutshell happens in this movie?
7535402	7538065	It's sort of like a retelling of the first game.
7539929	7541210	with Elements of the Third.
7541730	7548093	I'm surprised Capcom isn't trying to shut this shit down.
7548113	7551675	Did Capcom endorse this or are they just hoping?
7564551	7573735	I actually have no idea, but I don't think they would shut it down because I don't know if you remember a few years back at, I think it was DragonCon or some convention in the South.
7574355	7582439	Might have been SEC, I don't know, but reps from Capcom was there to watch a, I think it was a Devil May Cry fan film or something like that.
7584299	7585721	Oh, so this has kind of been done before.
7586041	7588804	And I guess the other movies talked about tonight, you know, Street Fighter movie.
7589084	7594949	Capcom is apparently just these grounds for, you know, making fan movies.
7596110	7596951	I saw Legacy.
7596991	7598753	I thought that was great, but I didn't see the other one, though.
7601195	7604358	Well, I guess maybe I'll have to check out the movie too.
7604558	7604838	I don't know.
7604858	7610263	I'm not a big fan of that particular website that made it, but I guess I can try and just sit down and watch it.
7610283	7610783	They didn't make it.
7610843	7611644	They're hosting it.
7612124	7612404	Oh, okay.
7612424	7613105	They're hosting it.
7613185	7614006	Well, then that's different.
7615847	7618950	And their official soundtrack to the fan film is also available.
7620960	7625763	Is the soundtrack not clips from the game, or is it arranged stuff from the game, or is it all original stuff?
7626524	7627404	All original.
7627444	7631107	This one guy did original recordings for the whole movie.
7631967	7638711	There's a couple of tracks he did do remixes of, but it's like dark-themed.
7638851	7642153	It kind of reminded me of the music from Lord in the Rings, in a way.
7642514	7643094	Interesting.
7643394	7643975	Like Enya?
7643995	7644255	Yeah.
7645382	7646003	Something like that.
7646643	7649846	The fan film itself isn't like comedy chop socket.
7649886	7652148	It's more like drama.
7652388	7654190	It's more of a drama, darkish theme.
7654791	7660776	Plus the fact that the science, Wily and Light are much younger than they're supposed to be.
7661989	7665111	TigerClaw in chat says Capcom did endorse the Street Fighter legacy.
7665351	7671274	Chat.OrangeLampTrader.com Capcom's pretty good with their fan base, though.
7671554	7673515	They've got a blog that reaches out to fans.
7673656	7675657	They try not to be jerks about stuff.
7677409	7681730	But you know, at the same time, when Nintendo pulled that Zelda film, I didn't really think they were being jerks.
7681810	7686552	I mean, they have a right to protect their IP, so if Capcom wanted to be jerks, they have a right.
7687632	7688413	You know what?
7688513	7695675	If Nintendo's going to pull that fan film, at least let us know about the supposed Metroid film that's supposed to be coming out.
7695695	7697315	We've been hearing about it for the last two, three years.
7697335	7698036	Good luck with that.
7698116	7699016	No, ain't happening.
7699396	7699796	Ain't happening.
7699816	7700316	Yeah, I know.
7702257	7705178	Which is too bad, because if it did happen, maybe they'd sell more copies of the game.
7706480	7706880	Mm-hmm.
7707841	7708101	All right.
7708161	7711402	And SJ1 and Matt wants to point out that the Megas did the closing music.
7711662	7714684	So there is at least still some other Mega Man community tie-ins.
7715184	7716084	Oh, yeah.
7716184	7716705	Definitely.
7716845	7717065	All right.
7717085	7718065	Well, Ranma, we got to let you go.
7718085	7719906	Do you have any other final thoughts before we let you go?
7721307	7723568	If you like Street Fighter stuff, check out Street Fighter High.
7723668	7724468	That's all I got to say.
7725048	7725349	All right.
7725389	7725649	Will do.
7725669	7727049	Dan was watching that the other day.
7727189	7728210	It's amusing.
7729090	7729631	Yes, it is.
7730031	7730251	All right.
7730291	7731091	We'll see you soon, Ranma.
7731111	7732592	Are you still coming out here like in July?
7733810	7736611	Um, we gotta talk about that, yeah.
7736631	7738332	Okay, sounds good.
7738352	7739233	All right, all right, take care.
7740073	7740513	We'll chat.
7740533	7746676	877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, is Orange Lounge Radio.
7747296	7749798	While we wait for other calls, do we have any other last-minute stories that came up?
7751218	7752539	Not particularly, I don't think.
7753019	7754440	But Joel, too, come in the WiiWare.
7755220	7756401	Woo!
7756561	7757221	Yay for that.
7757241	7758081	All right, we got another call.
7758121	7759082	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7759102	7759422	Who's this?
7761498	7762719	One and only Legend of Zaku.
7763179	7764259	Legend of Zaku.
7764359	7764679	What's up?
7764719	7765200	What's on your mind?
7766420	7766960	Nothing much.
7767000	7769781	Just recovering from Mother's Day gorging of food.
7770281	7770561	I see.
7770602	7775083	Well, at least it's not a Mother's Day hangover because I've definitely had those types of Mother's Days too.
7775963	7778504	So what's on your mind?
7778524	7779985	To what do we owe this phone call?
7781989	7791074	I guess the way I've been seeing it right now, is it just me or is Activision trying to defend just in general ass rape?
7791614	7807502	In other words, when they try to sell the stimulus pack for Modern Warfare 2, their exec has the gall to say it's the best deal, it's the best value for the amount you're paying, which we all know, and let's be honest here, it's a crock of shit.
7808749	7809189	I don't know.
7831728	7837770	Um, you know, I think they definitely have some damage control to be doing, so of course you're going to see comments like that.
7837790	7846252	The problem with, you know, the way I see it is that you know, they have to they can't just do what they did to Infinity Ward with Bungie.
7847452	7848913	Hold, hold, hold, I'm going to stop you right there.
7849733	7850853	They don't own Bungie.
7850913	7852034	It's a big difference.
7852594	7857615	You'd be surprised at how, you know, the actual details of the deal itself.
7858796	7859936	Like, you know, the
7860680	7879009	you know the details that are pretty much confidential I mean in other words what I'm trying to say is that the point is that perhaps Activision is going to be inclined to pull their strings as much as possible not to actually own them but to make their life that miserable
7880071	7885877	in terms of just like being demanding and overworking them if they were signed up for that type of deal.
7886697	7892403	I have a feeling this agreement is probably going to favor Bungie a little more because Activision is not directly paying for it.
7892463	7901131	As long as they actually negotiated, as long as Bungie managed to negotiate that contract with terms that they would agree with.
7901900	7902801	I'm pretty sure they were.
7902821	7909285	But I'm just, you know, as I'm saying, I just want to be sure that we just have to keep in mind that as long as Bungie doesn't get screwed over by Activision in terms of like
7928948	7931250	Remember though, Zaku, Bungie has survived a divorce with Microsoft.
7931290	7931990	That's pretty big.
7932250	7935393	These guys have publicly stated that they're helping on just maximizing profits.
7955183	7962545	Let me take this kind of a different direction a little bit here because we could kind of talk about this without really knowing the details of it for a very long time.
7962965	7969527	But come E3, hold on, come E3, we're actually going to see what this game is and what the big mystery project is.
7969547	7972368	At least that's the assumption and God, I hope it is the case.
7972708	7974648	We'll actually get to see what this mystery game is.
7974708	7975728	The curtain will be revealed.
7976129	7981670	Do you think people are going to remember all this once the game can speak for itself as opposed to being just an idea?
7982290	7982550	Right.
7982810	7991312	I mean, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter that Activision and Bungie are basically a 10-year deal.
7992012	7995552	The important thing is that the game will be the face of everything.
7996313	8006014	It will be the face and that will be the front, the things that your average Joe gamer will see when talking about that particular game.
8006114	8008895	He would see whatever character is tied to that game and nothing else.
8009702	8014043	I bet most people don't really follow this stuff either.
8014403	8019245	Like how many people go, oh, I've got to go see this movie because 20th Century Fox is doing it.
8019365	8023526	And like, you know, 20th Century Fox, I just love that little theme they play before all the movies.
8023686	8024626	Right.
8024666	8028467	You know, most people don't really give a hoot at the end of the day.
8029608	8030008	Exactly.
8030148	8034669	This is where the franchises sell themselves to the point where the people who made them
8036173	8036733	It doesn't matter.
8036793	8037715	It's irrelevant to them.
8038155	8039917	It's the same thing with Call of Duty right now.
8040157	8044122	They don't care that Treyarch or Infinity Ward made it.
8044202	8047026	It's just another Call of Duty game to appease Joe Gamer.
8048095	8048975	I should say this, though.
8049055	8056256	There are definitely people that will follow, if I'm going to continue this analogy, follow their favorite directors.
8056557	8058597	Like, you know, oh, Kevin Smith has a new film out.
8058737	8060177	I've got to go see that.
8060197	8061837	Those are niches you have to realize.
8062358	8071899	You have one aspect of really devoted fan base for that one particular person, but then you have another one that's just so passive.
8072519	8075780	It doesn't really take that into account.
8076803	8079625	So to them, it's just another movie that they're seeing.
8080105	8086249	And in this case, it's just another first-person shooter that this average Joe gamer is playing.
8087410	8087710	All right.
8088011	8089992	Well, Zaku, we've got to wrap up so we can get some more calls.
8090052	8091333	But thank you so much for your call.
8091553	8096076	And I'm sure we'll check in with you again after E3 when the curtain is revealed.
8097017	8097357	Right.
8097597	8097837	All right.
8098177	8098758	Take care, Zaku.
8099716	8100396	Alright, have a good one
8121644	8122385	Just a few things.
8123966	8132133	Apparently Square Enix is trying to prohibit people from making pictures and videos of their games, I guess, before they come out or something.
8132273	8132914	I don't really know.
8132934	8134655	I didn't realize that was a big problem.
8134915	8139899	But I know they've been really kind of anal about people taking pictures and stuff during E3.
8140060	8141201	Oh yeah, they do that all the time.
8141601	8142762	The phone's ringing off the hook.
8142802	8143623	I gotta get one of these calls.
8143663	8144543	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8144563	8144864	Who's this?
8145484	8146365	Hey, this is X-Link.
8146445	8147305	Hello, X-Link.
8147325	8148046	What's on your mind, buddy?
8148606	8160855	Hey, I was reading over some news and I was glad to see that Sega had detailed the DRM for Alpha Protocol and that I don't have to have an internet connection 24-7 in order to play it when I do play it.
8160935	8163397	Well, that's because it's Sega, not Ubisoft, but that's good.
8164110	8164590	Thank God.
8164670	8167012	Thank somebody for being DRM-friendly about it.
8167513	8174819	And then the fact that after about two years after the game comes out that they're going to put a patch where there will be no other requirements.
8175599	8185728	But it's good to know that somebody is at least looking at the consumer and saying, we don't want to go down these same footsteps as some of these other companies have been.
8185848	8190652	So it's good to see that somebody is at least trying to appease the PC customer.
8192318	8192938	Well, that's good.
8193899	8201162	I don't usually think of Sega as a big PC publisher, but I guess they certainly have some of their stuff there, so that's pretty cool.
8202562	8205603	But even so, I'm glad somebody's taking the right steps towards it.
8206404	8207764	What else is on your mind this week, buddy?
8209385	8209985	Nothing much.
8210465	8214467	I was working on my finals and stuff, and of course playing WoW just like you.
8214607	8215527	How is Warcraft going?
8215547	8217488	Have you been reading the Cataclysm spoilers at all?
8218422	8219463	No, I have not actually.
8219583	8221284	Well, it's kind of hard not to.
8221644	8222304	I take that back.
8222445	8231550	It's kind of hard not to read anything with it, but at the same time too, I try not to read too much because I like the whole aspect of surprise and see what's going to happen.
8232011	8240256	And it's like I was telling other people in the guild and stuff, I'm looking forward to seeing how these events actually unfold and how the event's going to play out.
8240836	8247422	and hopefully they might have some kind of timely worldly events where this all is going to come and unfold at one step at a time.
8247502	8248984	So it would be kind of neat to see how it happens.
8249004	8253768	Yeah, they did some fun events when Lich King came out so I'm sure they'll do some fun stuff here too.
8253848	8254469	So that'll be cool.
8255370	8255590	Yes.
8256791	8258533	Oh gosh, there's something else I was going to ask you.
8258613	8261616	Oh, you're trying to still do your Loremaster achievement, right?
8261756	8262997	You may not have a lot of time left.
8263017	8264558	You've got to get cracking on that.
8264578	8264719	Correct.
8265526	8266647	Well, yes, definitely.
8266767	8268228	And I will definitely be doing that.
8268448	8274172	Just like a lot of my schoolwork had come up, unfortunately, where it had stopped me and slowed down my process, which, of course, you guys can tell.
8274252	8277834	But then again, I started speeding up again as well.
8277954	8280956	Yeah, you finally decided, hey, maybe I should actually go to the new content.
8280976	8282197	I'll level a lot faster.
8282217	8286240	And then when you hit 80, it makes the old content super easy because you can start running dungeons by yourself.
8287080	8288001	Yeah, precisely.
8288161	8288782	Precisely.
8288882	8292244	And I have a few surprises in store this next coming week, too, for some of us.
8292404	8293765	But I will talk about that later.
8295746	8296006	All right.
8296166	8298907	But I got a few interesting things, which was kind of cool.
8299628	8299928	All right.
8300228	8302088	Well, we're going to let you go, buddy, so we can get some more calls.
8302229	8304489	But I'll see you in a while, I'm sure.
8304849	8305070	All right.
8305770	8306230	Later.
8306550	8308111	Bye-bye.
8308131	8310472	877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8310512	8310892	Why not?
8311192	8316374	We'll do a couple more calls, maybe at least one more call, since we were really thin on calls the past couple weeks.
8316434	8318395	And it seems like our phone's been ringing tonight.
8318495	8319495	I guess folks have things to say.
8319835	8343122	Which is strange because this was not quite as busy of a news week as weeks past And I expect the next few shows leading up to mid-June are going to be a little bit of the same thing Because, you know, most companies are going to try and keep it in their pants until E3 But you'll have little tidbits here and there Just like, you know, you've got going with A Little Big Planet 2 and everything But let's get to another call Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8344542	8346663	This is Actdeft Hey, Actdeft, what's on your mind?
8348263	8351784	Not much, I just wanna talk about the Humble Indie Bundle.
8352642	8353142	What is this?
8353463	8353683	What?
8354843	8357145	The Humble in the Bundle.
8357605	8359006	What is Humble in the Bundle?
8361187	8366870	It's actually a six-game pack you can download just by donating anything you want.
8367911	8369412	Any amount of cash.
8369452	8371033	Didn't this come up on last week?
8371093	8372454	No, maybe I just read a story on it.
8372534	8374275	Or was it maybe a last-minute story last week?
8374295	8374815	I don't remember.
8375335	8376696	I now know what you're talking about.
8376816	8379638	One of the games that's in there is Deblob, one of them?
8381266	8383707	No, it's actually World of Goo.
8384347	8385548	World of Goo, that's it.
8385788	8387269	I didn't get them confused.
8387289	8388969	They're both blobby slime games.
8390070	8390830	All right, so there it is.
8391130	8393331	Okay, yes, I did read about this, but go ahead.
8395072	8400754	It's World of Goo, Aquaria, Gish, Lugaroo, NHD, and Penumbra Overture.
8400934	8405996	And also they added a sixth game that is Samorost 2.
8407677	8410438	Did you actually pick this up and download it?
8411758	8412758	Yes, I actually did.
8413099	8414499	And what did you pay for it?
8415180	8418761	Even though Bobby may think I carried it, but no, I did pay for it.
8419141	8421082	Well, you get to name your own price for this, right?
8421823	8428206	Yeah, that's the cool thing about it, that you can put your own price on it.
8428806	8437490	You can put just a cent, but if you don't got a... Well, sorry.
8438348	8439749	Don't want to look that cheap.
8439789	8449154	You can donate $1 or $6, $5, $10, or even there's a donation here on the site that says $1,000.
8449634	8458399	So if you have a lot of cash to spend or donate, you can donate whatever you want.
8458499	8459119	Very generous.
8459139	8460760	You know, Orange Lounge Radio would happily take $1,000.
8460800	8465882	Actually, I won't drill you on how much you actually pay, but I do want to know, were you able to pay in pesos?
8465902	8467043	Because you're from Mexico.
8467143	8470785	Or did you have to actually pay like a conversion fee to translate to dollars?
8471445	8472906	Well, yeah, it's a conversion fee.
8474246	8479709	You can pay via PayPal, Amazon.com checkout, or Google checkout also.
8480269	8482030	You can get an account on those sites.
8482530	8483030	I gotcha.
8483250	8490292	And plus, you live relatively close to the border of the U.S., so I don't know, do you maybe have some bank accounts to deal in dollars?
8492073	8496894	I actually have international credit cards, so I just use them.
8497154	8502096	Usually people in border towns, no matter where you are, have some type of pass to kind of go between.
8503376	8504416	All right, well, very cool.
8505877	8507537	I'll quickly ask you this.
8507617	8509578	Which game was your favorite out of the bunch?
8510902	8514865	Well, I haven't tried any of them because I got it today.
8515405	8518087	Though I have played World of Goo and that's a pretty good game.
8518627	8522010	I would recommend downloading this just for that game.
8522650	8526773	So you're donating money just based on that game and everything else is just a bonus?
8527799	8528219	Probably.
8528359	8528959	That's fair enough.
8529139	8529499	Fair enough.
8530340	8530940	I can go with that.
8531620	8531900	All right.
8531940	8533580	Well, Actdeft, thank you for the heads up.
8533620	8537841	We always like cheap games or expensive games, whatever you think they're worth.
8538621	8543282	I think I read somewhere the average amount that people were paying were like $10 for all the games.
8543602	8547123	So, you know, for six games, it's not a lot of money.
8547163	8549664	But at the same time, it's an average of everything.
8549704	8552104	And I guess, you know, some people just simply can't afford more.
8552364	8555765	So hopefully people are paying what they really truly believe it's worth.
8556653	8562175	Yeah, the average contribution here is $8.36, though they have raised over $600,000.
8564596	8568377	Well, I guess in the end that's what really counts, is the amount they've raised as a whole.
8568798	8572099	Alright, well, Actdeft, we're going to let you go, but thank you so much for your call.
8573739	8574120	Thank you.
8574180	8574900	Have fun with the games.
8576337	8577417	Alright, I like that heads up.
8577457	8584100	See, I like that because it was a good heads up and it was like a sale on games, although I don't know if you really call that a sale or what.
8584400	8586121	There's been other games that have kind of done that lately.
8586141	8588822	877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lingerie.
8588842	8590843	We've got time to do at least one more call.
8591143	8594925	There's been a lot of kind of game things that have been doing this lately, like that game...
8596345	8602509	Alan and I were playing on Steam one day and it's like you draw these crayon lines with the mouse and I can't remember the name of it.
8602849	8604190	But that had a sale for a little while.
8604230	8605110	Crayon Physics?
8605370	8605750	Was that it?
8605790	8606371	Crayon Physics?
8606391	8606971	Yeah, I think it was.
8607752	8612114	You could pay whatever you want for that game and there's been a few games that have done that lately.
8612154	8614475	Didn't World of Goo just alone do that for a little while?
8615236	8615776	I think it did.
8616997	8617577	Could be wrong though.
8619278	8620899	One day and 16 hours left, by the way.
8620979	8622280	Actdeft is clarifying in chat.
8622340	8627104	Wolfire.com W-O-L-F-I-R-E.com slash humble.
8627124	8631187	Let's get to at least one more call here on Orange Lounge Radio tonight before we say goodnight.
8631247	8632388	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8632408	8632768	Who's this?
8634129	8634990	This is Amiga777.
8635991	8637532	Amiga777.
8637552	8638172	What's on your mind?
8639353	8645918	Well, first off, I'd like to give a Happy Mother's Day shout-out to Dark Sakura.
8647600	8647700	Uh...
8648513	8649654	Well, you're a mother to Shermie.
8650214	8650514	I am.
8651095	8654037	Yeah, well, yeah, I have my cat.
8654097	8656639	I don't have actual children, but thank you.
8658080	8658340	Yeah.
8659721	8666226	And anyway, I was wondering, have you all heard about Angry Birds?
8668287	8669668	Like actual Angry Birds?
8669688	8670088	Wait a minute.
8670208	8671009	Is this a movie?
8672703	8673023	No.
8673223	8673924	Okay, never mind.
8673944	8675005	Then I'm thinking of something else.
8675185	8678187	No, I'm thinking of Birdemic or whatever.
8678627	8681889	There's a new one with slugs now.
8682350	8683190	I'm thinking of something.
8683270	8685131	I'm thinking of like a sci-fi movie or something.
8685191	8686893	Sorry about that.
8686913	8689394	Like the birds, probably like Alfred Hitchcock.
8689534	8690835	Yes, that's what I'm thinking of.
8690895	8693097	Okay, what is Angry Birds, sir?
8694137	8702023	Angry Birds is typically a game that no iPhone slash iPod touch user should be without today.
8703684	8704564	It's a game.
8704824	8706425	I gotta ask, is this your game?
8707445	8708586	No, I didn't make it.
8709746	8710367	Alright, alright.
8710767	8711447	Then plug away.
8712868	8713188	Okay.
8713968	8728455	So basically, the story is, you got these evil greenish pigs or whatever that stole the birds' eggs and
8729218	8733222	and whatnot, and probably just doing God knows what with them.
8734303	8752501	And so what you have to do is unleash your vengeance with your birds by basically flinging them across this little map
8753676	8763899	and, you know, destroying and, you know, eliminating all the pigs in the game.
8765139	8772921	Actually, I got to tell you real quick, Amiga777, I don't mean to cut you off, but we actually just got delivered an exclusive commercial for the game.
8772981	8773461	You want to hear it?
8774341	8774761	Oh, yeah.
8774822	8775302	Yeah, here it is.
8775422	8776602	Exclusive commercial for the game.
8779163	8780603	Brian, can I see that paper for a second?
8783072	8784293	Hmm, that's odd.
8785053	8786294	I thought that would be big news.
8786534	8787755	You thought what would be big news?
8787995	8791918	Well, there seems to be an absence of a certain ornithological piece.
8793152	8797415	A headline regarding mass awareness of a certain avian variety.
8797595	8798456	What are you talking about?
8798716	8799416	Oh, have you not heard?
8800117	8802198	It was my understanding that everyone had heard.
8802378	8802799	Heard what?
8802919	8803439	Brian, don't!
8803559	8804600	The greatest episode ever.
8804640	8806281	Don't you know about the bird?
8806301	8808423	Well, Peter's gonna tell you about the bird.
8808563	8809423	Well, a bird, bird.
8809463	8811565	The bird, the word, the word, the bird.
8811585	8811785	Sir!
8822492	8823112	Perfect!
8823412	8824573	Oh my god, Peter, are you alright?
8848447	8851950	This just in, Angry Birds just sold 10,000 copies right there.
8853051	8853691	Seriously?
8854532	8855853	No, I'm just fucking with you.
8855933	8856314	Come on.
8857294	8859276	This is Orange Lounge Radio, for heaven's sakes.
8859356	8860757	We love random tangents.
8861358	8862959	Sorry, I couldn't resist.
8863019	8863499	I'm sorry.
8864260	8865221	Oh, that was awesome.
8865541	8866642	No, it's all good.
8866662	8872587	But seriously, it is selling a lot, and the company claims it's in more countries than they can count.
8873428	8874569	It's become a big deal.
8876880	8880627	So, how much is this game going to set you back?
8881930	8882912	Oh, it's just 99 cents.
8883032	8885196	Oh, well, that's not bad at all.
8885597	8888783	Like some people are saying, it's so good, they think it's underpriced.
8889537	8895362	Well, now, I don't want them to go the route of that one guy who, like, kept increasing the price of his game.
8895402	8900606	Like, what was that one game that went up to, like, $10,000 on the store before Apple was like, what the fuck are you doing?
8900666	8901767	I don't know, he's a douchebag.
8901787	8903228	Get out, douchebag.
8903748	8905129	It was a social experiment.
8905190	8906851	Well, actually, you know what, though?
8907251	8908892	So what, he raised the price of his game.
8908932	8913236	People were dumb enough to buy it, so props to him for figuring out a way to make money.
8916024	8916325	Yeah.
8916505	8916785	All right.
8917086	8926579	Well, Amiga77777, hopefully some folks will check out Angry Bird this week and realize that the bird is indeed the word.
8927039	8927700	Ba-ba-ba-bird.
8927720	8928121	I can get down.
8928281	8929683	All right.
8932287	8935612	Are you sure you don't know the people that programmed it?
8935772	8937995	Or, you know, getting the cut for the profits?
8938015	8943522	The name of the company?
8944123	8945966	No, do you know the people that made it?
8948623	8950885	Click Gamer, and Ravio.
8951426	8951666	Oh, okay.
8951686	8952747	You don't know them personally, though.
8952807	8953588	You don't have their phone number?
8953608	8955229	No, I don't know the people.
8955610	8955910	Oh, okay.
8956510	8956751	All right.
8957071	8960034	Well, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for the plug.
8960074	8962636	I'm sure the developers of the game really appreciate you right now.
8963817	8964097	Yeah.
8964418	8965238	And we appreciate you, too.
8965298	8965799	Take care, buddy.
8966359	8966760	Take care.
8967380	8967720	All right.
8968081	8969882	That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
8971633	8975177	It's kind of funny because we don't really run commercials on this show but yet we do.
8976798	8979200	It's always somebody's podcast or game.
8979240	8979961	No, it's all good.
8980382	8980782	You know what?
8980822	8984285	We want to know what people are playing and I'm all for supporting indie developers.
8984345	8984786	It's all good.
8985509	8987029	Alright, that's it.
8987109	8991910	We're about ready to wrap up shop and be done here with the show tonight and be all over.
8992090	8995551	I don't know if you had any other last minute stories you wanted to get to before I closed the shop.
8995731	8999772	Not really a story at all, but I think I mentioned it on my Twitter.
9000712	9008234	I got picked, not that I'm actually going to use the service, I got picked to be a part of the Game Crush service.
9008874	9011955	Basically, because right now they have limited access to the website.
9012135	9013915	Is that the, like...
9015215	9043207	Almost Prostitution But With Video Games Yes But Now We Get To View The Actual Website Because I Have It's Funny I Am All For Tearing This Thing Up And Looking At It On Next Week's Show However Make Sure There's No NDA Or Nothing Because I Don't Want To Get In No Trouble Cease And Desist Whatever Make Sure We're Good There Alright Alright Well Then We'll Look At That In A Few Weeks That's It And I'm Assuming DarkSakura Doesn't Have Any Last Minute Stories I Think She Said A Moment Ago So Nope Alright
9043632	9047194	We're going to let her go back to playing Final Fantasy 2 and everybody go back to whatever they're doing.
9047654	9051996	Alright, but first we're going to wrap up the show by getting everybody's final thoughts.
9053576	9054557	My final thought first.
9054597	9055237	I'll start tonight.
9055417	9056858	I really don't want to go to the dentist.
9057978	9058739	Loki, your final thought.
9063821	9065342	Somebody leaked Sonic 4.
9066662	9068923	DarkSakura, last but not least, your final thought tonight.
9069924	9070664	I'm a pie.
9072202	9074104	I had banana cream pie last night, it was fabulous.
9074144	9077587	But I'm not eating pie, I'll just make myself some chocolate something.
9077927	9079628	There you go.
9079688	9082030	Can't you have like spinach pie or something?
9083091	9085833	If I wasn't out of bananas, I'd just make myself some banana pudding.
9086834	9095722	Now I know the whole thing is raw foods, but are you allowed to, like if you are putting it together and you put spinach and all this stuff in there, are you allowed to put it in the oven and cook it?
9095902	9097383	Or no, you still have to stay away from that?
9097982	9100104	Allowing is such a strong word.
9101446	9103428	If I want it cooked, I'll have it cooked.
9103568	9104609	I mean, I'm not that.
9106170	9112657	But the whole essence, they say, is not to heat it more than 117 degrees because that's when the enzymes are destroyed.
9115679	9119183	That being said, I hate cooked spinach unless it's on a pizza.
9120569	9122953	Yeah, I like raw spinach much better.
9123073	9124415	Spinach salad is the bomb.
9124996	9128361	I've actually got stuff together to make myself a good spinach salad for lunch tomorrow.
9128481	9128862	Good times.
9129878	9130378	All right, anyhow.
9130738	9133219	See, it starts and ends with food here at Orange Lounge Radio.
9133820	9137541	But if you like the show, please, please tell a friend about the show.
