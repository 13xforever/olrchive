0	19120	Tonight, May 9th, 2010, Starcraft 2 gets a release date, Nintendo promises to increase
19120	29600	anti-piracy measures on the 3DS, and a sequel to LittleBigPlanet gets confirmed.
29600	37680	Hello, my friends, and welcome to episode number 366 of Orange Lounge Radio, the video
37680	40520	game talk show where every gamer has a voice.
40520	44120	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host,
44120	47600	the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
47600	48800	Mmm.
48800	49800	How are you?
49800	50800	Mmm.
50800	51800	Mmm.
51800	52800	Filled with food, apparently.
52800	53800	I had nummies.
53800	54800	Had nummies.
54800	58000	Have you talked about this on the show, your new diet, a little bit?
58000	59000	A little bit, yeah.
59000	64840	It's not really so much of a diet anymore as a full-on lifestyle change, because I got
64840	69760	sick of getting sick every time I eat, because I can't eat anything without being stuck in
69760	70760	it.
70760	71760	I'm gonna say it.
71760	72760	Everything makes me constipated.
72760	73760	Everything.
73760	75760	You just need more Metamucil.
75760	76760	No.
76760	77760	Or McDonald's.
77760	79840	By the way, that made me throw up.
79840	82080	That is the voice over there, the one and only tech master, Loki.
82080	83680	How are you doing, Loki?
83680	86360	I'm fine, but I think I've eaten too much.
86360	92200	It's weird, because you would think, with the quantity of food that I normally consume,
92200	95200	that I would be able to eat more.
95200	100280	But it's actually, lately, I've been unable to eat as much.
100280	101280	Blessing in disguise?
101280	102280	I guess.
102280	111200	Granted, you probably don't know, I eat pretty, not healthy, but healthier than I used to.
111200	114480	I mean, really, during the week, I don't drink soda.
114480	118200	I don't go to fast food.
118200	124680	I have these low-fat salami sandwiches with whole wheat bread and that kind of stuff,
124680	128600	and I eat usually one in the morning, one for lunch, have-
128600	130320	And a sensible dinner.
130320	131320	Sorry.
131320	140160	For a snack later on, have no butter or popcorn that's light and stuff, and then for dinner,
140160	142800	I just gorge on whatever I have at home.
142800	147240	But usually not- On the weekend, you have fun a little bit.
147240	148240	Sometimes, yeah.
148240	155480	I mean, usually within reason, although this weekend, we discovered Smashburger and there
155480	157240	went everything.
157240	166400	So this weekend's been bad, but yeah, so now I'm trying to eat my twists and I'm shoving
166400	170080	the last piece down my throat, because I'm full.
170080	172560	But they're so delicious, I can't let them go to waste.
172560	174360	They're good stuff and they make the whole room smell yummy.
174360	177920	May I say one thing so that I don't leave what I was saying on the word constipated?
177920	178920	Yes, of course.
178920	179920	I know.
179920	180920	Sorry.
180920	181920	Yes.
181920	187280	I'm eating 70 to 80% raw now, like certain things I'll have cooked.
187280	192760	And I finally got to the point where I'm trying to see where I can go out to eat.
192760	195280	So far, Persian food is out if I eat meat.
195280	200480	Not chilies, but Chevy's is kind of okay, but I have to be careful of corn chips.
200480	201480	Corn chips make me sick.
201480	203920	This morning I had eggs and they didn't make me sick.
203920	204920	Hooray.
204920	206800	So now I know what I can eat.
206800	210520	This morning I went to IHOP and I had pancakes with cheesecake spread in the middle.
210520	211520	That just sounds amazing.
211520	212520	P.S.
212520	213520	I'm fat.
213520	214520	Anyhow.
214520	219080	And you might be wondering, why do they always talk about food on Orange Laundry Note?
219080	220080	But you know, these...
220080	221600	Food keeps us alive!
221600	226320	And we talked about Smashburger last week because their logo rips off the GameStop logo
226320	230520	because it's the exact same font and colors.
230520	233720	But instead of selling games, they smash meat and make it delicious.
233720	235760	It actually is a condensed font.
235760	239360	You know what, and it's important because if you think about that stereotypical image
239360	244880	of a gamer, what, you know, fat, lazy, controller, crumbs, you know, pouring off your face and
244880	245880	all that stuff.
245880	247800	What was the weird owl line in your pitiful?
247800	249600	I don't know.
249600	253320	I just think of the Warcraft episode of South Park and that guy.
253320	257400	Eating, what, Cheetos off your chest playing Halo 2?
257400	261760	But how easy is it, though, to sit there and play a game like Halo 2, you know, or whatever
261760	265360	it is you play, and go through like a whole bag of Doritos?
265360	268360	That's not the smartest lifestyle.
268360	269360	That's called idle eating.
269360	270360	Yes.
270360	274360	And I do it when I'm working, like, because I've been working on my homework for my finals.
274360	278120	Because my finals next week, ooh, they're all projects, so that means I have a lot of
278120	279120	crap to do.
279120	283820	But the biggest thing that I always loved is I loved eating blue corn chips.
283820	289540	Like just chomping away because I would feel too, I would get distracted from other stuff
289540	291960	without something for my mouth to do or something.
291960	296080	And now I have pecans and goji berries that I snack on.
296080	299140	Let me give you my piece of dieting advice for the, you know, not that I'm one that really
299140	301000	should be giving out dieting advice.
301000	304880	But here's my tip for those of you that want to defy the gamer stereotype.
304880	309120	And this is one really easy thing you can do that will really cut back on a lot of this.
309120	310600	Well, kind of a two-part thing.
310600	315760	Hey, if you're eating Doritos, Ruffles, Lay's, whatever, see if you can't switch to something
315760	316760	low or fat.
316760	320960	Like, even if it's just the baked version or pretzels are a really, really good substitute
320960	324640	as long as you're not getting the, like, ranch pretzels and all that.
324640	327020	Carrots and hummus?
327020	329620	I don't think, you know, a lot of people are going to go that extreme.
329620	331120	You know, certainly that would be ideal.
331120	332520	Or pita chips and hummus.
332520	333520	Right.
333520	334560	But here's the other tip.
334560	337200	Put it in a bowl before you take it to the living room.
337200	338200	Yeah.
338200	342000	And you're rationing off a certain size and you don't go through a whole bag in one sitting.
342000	343000	I'm not perfect.
343000	346160	I downed a whole bag of fortune cookies over the weekend because they're really good.
346160	348320	And, like, they sell, like, flat fortune cookies.
348320	349320	They're like sugar paper.
349320	350320	Oh my god, they're so good.
350320	351320	With orange flavoring.
351320	354160	So, but you know how it goes, you know, we're not always perfect.
354160	359280	But that would be my tip if you want to be better when you're gaming.
359280	364480	And for anyone who is curious about how eating raw has affected me in other ways, after my
364480	368400	birthday, you know, all that beer and cake that I consumed all week because I had a lot
368400	370420	of beer and cake left over.
370420	376480	I had gone, with my eating less thing, I had gone down three pounds and then I put back
376480	379240	on eight or nine.
379240	382720	And now I'm back to where I was before my birthday.
382720	389160	So that means I've lost, I've lost about eight pounds in a week.
389160	390160	Congratulations.
390160	392080	Hope it can keep going for you.
392080	393960	And I've been eating more, for the record.
393960	394960	I've been eating more.
394960	397080	But more vegetables and stuff.
397080	402280	I've been eating a lot of vegetables and I like bananas now, Rob.
402280	403920	I used to only like banana flavored things.
403920	404920	Now I actually like bananas.
404920	405920	And I'll give everyone a quick recipe.
405920	406920	Bananas are good.
406920	407920	It's a quick one.
407920	408920	All right.
408920	409920	Hurry, kids.
409920	410920	We got to get to games.
410920	415480	Get a food processor, throw in a banana, some two tablespoons of raw cocoa and about a tablespoon
415480	418400	of honey or agave nectar and just blend it all really smooth.
418400	419400	Put it in the fridge.
419400	420400	Take it out two hours later.
420400	424160	Chocolate banana pudding, consistency and everything.
424160	425160	So there you go.
425160	426160	Sometimes, sometimes.
426160	427160	All right.
427160	429120	Let's get into video games because believe it or not, between the food, we do talk about
429120	432040	video games once in a great while on this show.
432040	435620	Let's start off as we always do with a little bit of how is your gaming week?
435620	438640	So Dark Soccer, what kind of games you've been playing this week?
438640	441600	I actually started off playing Final Fantasy II.
441600	444600	Finally, I got around and I like it.
444600	445600	Oh, like the iPhone one?
445600	446600	Yeah, the iPhone one.
446600	450240	The control is pretty interesting and sometimes it doesn't want to actually go where I tell
450240	452440	it to go, but maybe it's because I've got big fat thumbs.
452440	453680	I don't know.
453680	456560	I bet it plays better on a 3GS than it does the 3G too.
456560	459280	I bet because it has a slightly faster processor in those things, right?
459280	460280	Oh yeah.
460280	461280	Yeah.
461280	462280	It plays smoothly.
462280	463280	No problem.
463280	464280	See, I have a 3G and I have issues.
464280	465280	You can try mine.
465280	466280	Maybe I will.
466280	467280	Okay.
467280	470360	And then I actually, while we were waiting to get into the stupid restaurant this morning,
470360	473600	because seriously, we were waiting for like an hour, I just finally got bored and beat
473600	484080	Espagluta again on my iPhone and I played some Star Trek Online a little bit and I've
484080	487160	been trying to fix my Sims and I think that I just have way too many mods.
487160	488160	So fuck it.
488160	489720	I'm just not going to play Sims.
489720	492080	And Dark Soccer is trying to sucker me into the world.
492080	495560	I should say back into the world because I did play the beta for a little bit of Star
495560	496560	Trek Online.
496560	497720	She gave me a little 10-day code.
497720	499720	So I don't know.
499720	500720	I don't know.
500720	501720	We'll see.
501720	502720	We'll see.
502720	503720	I don't know.
503720	506080	And I've been saving stuff to give you.
506080	508400	Like stuff to add on your ship.
508400	509960	You know I've already addicted to one MMO.
509960	511280	I don't know if I can get addicted to another.
511280	512280	We'll see.
512280	513280	We'll see.
513280	515600	I don't know if it was on the show or not, but there's that, remember they're doing now
515600	521880	like an unlimited trial basically where you can go play the first couple tutorial levels
521880	525160	or whatever and spend as much time as you want doing that.
525160	526160	That's Star Trek?
526160	527160	I thought that was one of the others.
527160	528160	No, it's Star Trek Online.
528160	529160	Oh, okay.
529160	530160	Very cool.
530160	533880	Alright, well if that's it for Dark Soccer's Gaming Week, then Loki, while you're filling
533880	537040	us in on those MMO tips, how was your gaming week?
537040	538920	Didn't play a lot of stuff actually.
538920	542640	It was pretty much just Grand Theft Auto.
542640	551040	Been trying to, basically I have to in order to get where I want to be in the rankings,
551040	556840	which is the top of the list, I have to win 500 games in a row.
556840	558640	Actually probably more like a thousand games in a row.
558640	559920	So I'm working on that.
559920	563580	I'm about five now.
563580	570920	So doing a good job, I'm actually, because with how high I am on the Trueskill leaderboard
570920	577220	right now, if I lose a game, it bumps me down about five to ten ranks, and I have to win
577220	581220	about five games to go up a rank.
581220	586640	So it's really frustrating when I get in, not necessarily lose a game, because losing
586640	594280	basically just by a few bucks would be considered a loss, although if you beat people, like
594280	598000	say if you don't win the game, but you beat like three people, that still counts towards
598000	600080	going up the leaderboards.
600080	605240	Anyways, but I have been playing perfect games though, so much so that it's been pissing
605240	609320	off my coworkers and they actually threatened to pull the ethernet one time.
609320	612800	In fact, they did for a second and plugged it back in.
612800	617960	I got pissed off at them, but hey, I'm pretty high up there.
617960	623320	I'm like rank 70 right now, and 70 out of 60,000 people is pretty damn good, if you
623320	624320	ask me.
624320	625320	And then...
625320	626320	Me, me, me, me, I'm the best.
626320	627320	Me, me, me, I'm the best.
627320	628320	Hey!
628320	629320	I'm just messing.
629320	630320	No, I think it's great.
630320	633960	The leaderboards say so.
633960	637120	I had a leaderboard thing this week too, and I'll get into that in a minute.
637120	638920	And I work really hard for it.
638920	639920	Trust me.
639920	645040	For anybody that plays actually Grand Theft Auto out there on the ranked games, you have
645040	649480	to know how hard it is to get an actual game with people in it.
649480	656560	And then on top of that, getting a game where you finish with everybody still in the game,
656560	660200	because a lot of people rage quit out of all these games.
660200	662560	Especially the games I'm in, because I kick the crap out of them.
662560	664280	I'm surprised you don't get penalized for that stuff.
664280	665680	Do you have big devahissies?
665680	666680	You can.
666680	671000	Basically what you do is you go, if they quit out, and when you're done with the game, or
671000	675960	during the game sometimes I'll do that, you go to their profile and you put, you know,
675960	676960	a review.
676960	679040	You can do that in any game though.
679040	681560	There's no, like, they lose rating points or anything?
681560	682840	No, there's nothing like that.
682840	687960	And you know, that's good in a sense, because our internet at work really sucks, so we get
687960	691240	disconnected from live a lot, and it kind of sucks.
691240	693640	But I mean, the people that...
693640	698000	There's a difference between getting disconnected from live and being a devah.
698000	700600	Like DarkSaga said, there's a lot of devahs on Xbox Live.
700600	702240	There's a lot of Halo devahs out there.
702240	706840	There is a lot of people that are like up in the top ten in the ranked games and stuff,
706840	708980	and they will not play me.
708980	713920	Because I know they're trying to look for these newbie guys to just basically pick on.
713920	715440	I'm playing anybody.
715440	718660	Anybody that hops in the game, I'm gonna play them and I'm gonna kick the crap out of them.
718660	723520	The last game I played, I had 33 kills.
723520	724960	The person below me had three.
724960	728600	So you know, I'm just very intense.
728600	730920	I had 33 kills.
730920	731920	Whatever, okay?
731920	732920	Just, I'm messing.
732920	735880	Yeah, I wish someone would show me up, but no one's coming.
735880	738840	Where's the other 69 players ahead of you?
738840	739840	I don't know.
739840	743100	But see, it's weird though, the true skill rankings, it's just win-losses.
743100	744720	So there's a lot of people on there.
744720	746600	I play like 300-some games.
746600	750400	There's people on there there above me that played like 20 games, but they've just happened
750400	753560	to win the majority of those 20 games, you know?
753560	757040	Yeah, I could create a new profile, win all the games, and then, oh look at that, I'm
757040	760760	at the top of the list, but that's not playing fair.
760760	766160	Anyways, so other than that, I'm actually now working on, we're gonna go back to playing
766160	769600	the modded games again, because it's just too hard to find people to play with.
769600	776200	So I'm looking and doing the research phase of a new modded Grand Theft Auto games.
776200	781440	I'm looking now on map editing and stuff like that, because we gotta have ramps and stuff
781440	786560	going to the moon, you know, basically in this game, just to edge it out a little bit
786560	793360	more than it was last time, but I'm definitely looking forward to doing that, and without
793360	798520	modding the consoles, of course, we're gonna do the disc swap technique with that.
798520	804040	And then I just have a lot of games I'm waiting for, Red Dead Redemption, supposedly coming
804040	808520	out in a few weeks, so look forward to that, but have Alan Wake and Lost Planet 2 to get
808520	812480	to, and a whole bunch of stuff.
812480	816040	Alright, well, if you're done then, my gaming week.
816040	822080	Oh, and I joined the APB beta, so hopefully, the beta requirements are a little bit more
822080	824000	than what the actual game requires.
824000	828560	It says I need more RAM, even though I have Windows XP3 2-bit, and I have 2 gigs of RAM,
828560	833880	and Windows doesn't see really any more than that, I mean I'll get like 2 point something
833880	837880	gigs of RAM, so I just need to get some more RAM, probably gonna upgrade my graphics card
837880	841480	as well, looking forward to that game.
841480	842480	Good times.
842480	847480	My gaming week, honestly, not a whole lot different than last week, a little disappointing
847480	851040	because I had so many games last week and this week, not quite as many, or mostly the
851040	855680	same stuff, I'm still enjoying my new video card with lots of World of Warcraft, of course,
855680	858040	and Dragon Age a little bit here and there too.
858040	862100	Probably the only other newish thing I played was some of the new Game Room releases, although
862100	864240	I guess that's not really new, now is it?
864240	868940	These games from 1981 and so forth, wouldn't really be considered new, but whatever.
868940	872920	It was exciting to at least see some new content for Game Room, especially after my little
872920	874880	rant last week.
874880	879000	I guess I got put in my place a little bit with them finally coming out and having just
879000	880920	the one week delay.
880920	885200	So obviously, they've committed that it's out there, what's coming out for the next
885200	889440	few weeks, so hopefully they're gonna stick to that schedule and prove me wrong a little
889440	892480	bit on some of the things last week, which is good, because there's a lot about Game
892480	898540	Room I do like, again, I think there's a lot of room for improvement and I hope that that
898540	902920	base engine for Game Room will not stay that way forever, I do hope they make some upgrades
902920	907200	to it, meh, we'll see.
907200	913160	So I did play, Pitfall was probably the biggest release this week from the old 2600 days and
913160	916960	that's a game I spent a lot of time with when I was a kid, when I was about five or six,
916960	920800	played through a lot of Pitfall, so I actually sat down and played a full game of Pitfall,
920800	924840	when I say a full game of Pitfall, Pitfall is a timed game, you only have 20 minutes
924840	927860	tops to run through the jungle and collect as much treasure as you can.
927860	932080	So I played for the full 20 minutes without losing all my lives, because you know, some
932080	935440	things you learn when you're five and you never forget, and the thing I learned is how
935440	939080	to get across that alligator pit, when there's no vines, you know, and that's the part of
939080	942680	the game that usually trips people up, but yeah, I was able to get through there and
942680	949880	I pretty much ran consistently for 20 minutes, I go to the left, you know, most people think
949880	953680	you have to play Pitfall to the right, because that's the way your character faces, but you
953680	956800	actually don't, if you want to start the game going backwards, you can, so I actually start
956800	961800	the game going to the left, and kept going until the time ran out, and I had a score
961800	966640	of about 89,000, which isn't bad, because the most you can possibly score in Pitfall
966640	971640	is 110,000, that's if you get all the treasure, I was only 400 points shy of being in the
971640	975480	top 20 on the game room leaderboard, at the time, I think it's gotten a lot harder now,
975480	980160	I think the minimum score is about 100,000 now, but I just need to learn one thing I
980160	984200	didn't know as a kid, was how to navigate the tunnels, I thought the tunnels were stupid,
984200	987160	because trying to get around the scorpions is kind of hard, so I never really learned
987160	991000	how to navigate the tunnels, and my little five, six year old brain didn't understand,
991000	996580	you know, a tunnel skips three regular screens, so I didn't really learn the patterns that
996580	1000040	some people I'm sure memorized when they were younger, and that's how they're getting on
1000040	1004320	the leaderboard now, so maybe I'll go back to that and try to actually play a better
1004320	1008860	game, we'll see, but other games I checked out this week on Game Room, Super Breakout,
1008860	1014320	which I think kind of stinks, and you know, I realized it was the first game like it,
1014320	1017860	but I would much rather see a game like Arknoid or something come to a game room, and plus
1017860	1022280	the controller, just not the same thing, it's like a trackball, that's what we need, we
1022280	1026600	need like a trackball on 360, that'd be great for like Crystal Castles, and some of the
1026600	1027600	other games.
1027600	1033120	Maybe they'll just have the tall support or some crap like that, and be like, oh look,
1033120	1038440	instead of being, you know, the control scheme that makes sense by moving your hand around
1038440	1044160	or something like that, they'll have you like roll a fictional trackball or something.
1044160	1047520	Tiger Claw in our chat room, by the way, join us in our chat room if you're not already
1047520	1052720	there, we do tape live every week at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com at 6pm pacific, right
1052720	1056120	after the Bobby Black Wolf show, but if you are listening to us live, pull up a chair
1056120	1061480	and join us in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, and Tiger Claw actually says, I used to play
1061480	1065640	a whole lot of Pitfall to see how far I could get, and hoping I reach the end, but it never
1065640	1066640	ends.
1066640	1073800	It actually will, if you get every piece of treasure, and there are only 255 screens,
1073800	1077880	or 256, because you know how everything has to be based on powers of two a lot when you're
1077880	1083480	programming for those old languages, so I think there's 256 screens in the game, but
1083480	1089800	there's like, I think 32 pieces of treasure, because again, everything's on powers of two,
1089800	1093120	so I think once you get every piece of treasure, the game ends.
1093120	1096920	I think the clock just stops and it's over, and you know you basically beat it.
1096920	1102320	There's no actual ending like there is in Pitfall 2, where, no kill screen, it's not
1102320	1105560	really a kill screen, it's just Harry jumps over and over again, and that's how you know
1105560	1109220	you beat it, because he goes jump, jump, jump, because you beat it.
1109220	1114280	By the way, I hope that game does come out eventually, Pitfall 2 I want to see, H.E.R.O.
1114280	1118600	I want to see, what other big Activision classics do I want to see, Oink, which is out next
1118600	1120120	week, I actually just play that game a lot.
1120120	1124760	One other game I'll quickly talk about, Mega Maniac, is also on Game Room this week, and
1124760	1128860	that was kind of a funny shooter game, it was a little silly, you could say it's Space
1128860	1132240	Invaders-esque, but basically objects are falling from the sky, or they float in the
1132240	1134880	sky, you shoot them, da da da.
1134880	1140060	It's a little more challenging, I think, in some ways in Space Invaders, because the things,
1140060	1144500	they're supposed to be based on household objects, like you shoot toasters and hamburgers,
1144500	1151120	but it's Atari 2600 graphics, so they just all look like things, you're shooting things,
1151120	1154240	and some of the things in later levels like float down towards the bottom, but they're
1154240	1158680	in very specific patterns, and you have to, like, some of them will hover right where
1158680	1162040	your ship could go, so you have to actually kind of memorize the patterns, or you could
1162040	1163040	go explodey.
1163040	1167200	Ooh, and Vandy in our chat room says River Raid, that is definitely a classic Activision
1167200	1168200	game, too.
1168200	1170200	Lots and lots of good stuff.
1170200	1174880	Ooh, Salacious Pop asking me in chat if I ever got in on the Civ 3 for sale, I should
1174880	1176440	put that out as an FYI.
1176440	1182600	Steam was running a sale, Civilization 3, complete edition, $1.25.
1182600	1183600	That's a great deal.
1183600	1184600	What?
1184600	1189360	Yeah, on Steam, Civ 3, the complete edition, but get this, Civ 4, I think it was like,
1189360	1193080	and Alan, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it was like $19.95, no, I think it was less
1193080	1200040	than that, maybe $12.95 for everything, Civ 4, Civ 4, the expansion and colonization was
1200040	1201040	like less than $20.
1201040	1202040	It was nice.
1202040	1206600	One other thing I do want to mention during my gaming week, because I do play a lot of
1206600	1211400	World of Warcraft, lots of information leaking on Cataclysm this week.
1211400	1215800	I don't want to go too spoilery, because I know some people are really trying to prevent
1215800	1217240	hearing all the spoilers.
1217240	1220720	A lot of what I've seen is very visual, so thankfully this is a radio show and I can't
1220720	1224560	really spoil the visuals, but I will say I am so glad that the game is getting like a
1224560	1225800	graphical upgrade.
1225800	1229720	I think it's great that Blizzard is kind of taking this opportunity to say, let's see,
1229720	1233040	how could we like retcon a graphical upgrade into the game?
1233040	1237560	Oh, let's blow up the world as it is and make this whole new world and it'll have all new
1237560	1238560	graphics.
1238560	1243640	And some of the screenshots are great, so yeah.
1243640	1248680	And Bobby in Chat is correcting us, jumping in, $10 for Civ 4, the two expansions and
1248680	1249680	colonization.
1249680	1250680	That's a great deal.
1250680	1251680	That's a great deal.
1251680	1253960	I've got to get in on that before it's over.
1253960	1257680	Damn you Steam, nickel and dime me for all these old games.
1257680	1262000	Yeah, so World of Warcraft Cataclysm, I'm excited about that.
1262000	1266400	Kind of surprised at how fast information is leaking out, but the friends and family
1266400	1270680	alpha is going on and unfortunately not everybody's friends and family at Blizzard can apparently
1270680	1275620	be trusted because once it hits the internet, which the client has apparently, it's done
1275620	1281160	because that thing's got data mined and there's pictures and models and everything.
1281160	1285640	So yeah, looking forward to some of the things they have planned for the expansion.
1285640	1288360	All right, let's get into some housekeeping tonight.
1288360	1292480	We want to wish a very happy Mother's Day to all the mothers who happen to be listening
1292480	1297000	and all of your mothers or motherly figure in your life and what have you who happen
1297000	1298000	to be tuning in.
1298000	1300400	I don't know if we have a lot of mothers that listen to this show.
1300400	1301840	We all know mine doesn't listen.
1301840	1303120	We have one listening now.
1303120	1304120	Oh, Becky.
1304120	1305120	Right?
1305120	1306400	Well, happy Mother's Day, Becky.
1306400	1311120	And I think Deep Man's wife might listen once in a while.
1311120	1315680	And I don't know what other mothers, I apologize if I forgot you, but happy Mother's Day to
1315680	1319080	all of you or just anybody who considers themselves a mother.
1319080	1323560	All right, let's move on and actually get into some gaming news now.
1323560	1326700	And speaking of Blizzard, I believe we're starting off tonight with just an avalanche
1326700	1328360	of Blizzard news, right, Logie?
1328360	1330800	Yeah, there's a lot of news coming out for.
1330800	1332320	I heard what you did there.
1332320	1334800	I totally unintended, too.
1334800	1337680	Totally unintended.
1337680	1344320	With StarCraft II, of course, they announced the release date for July 27th, and both the
1344320	1348520	collector's edition and the regular edition will be coming out at that time.
1348520	1351600	Of course, this will be the first StarCraft II that's being released.
1351600	1355920	I believe there's still going to be two more because one for each campaign.
1355920	1359280	Way to whore it out.
1359280	1360600	So that's kind of neat.
1360600	1362160	Some other neat things, though.
1362160	1365360	Apparently the map editor is very versatile.
1365360	1371360	In fact, not only can you make custom maps with it, you can make custom games with it,
1371360	1375120	including some people have used different examples here.
1375120	1378640	They've made a Tetris-like game.
1378640	1385460	There was a Mario Kart type of game where you can race different characters around.
1385460	1391600	And then finally, there was also a SHMUP game made with the editor as well.
1391600	1397520	So that's pretty awesome that you have so much flexibility with just that editor.
1397520	1401520	It'd be very interesting to see what kind of mods you'll see for it.
1401520	1405000	It'd be more interesting to see what Blizzard does to not have this happen.
1405000	1408360	Although, I don't know, Blizzard also kind of is supporting the mod community because
1408360	1410000	they kind of realize it's going to happen.
1410000	1414320	Warcraft especially, you know, I notice there's two kinds of people.
1414320	1416560	There's Starcraft people and there's Diablo people.
1416560	1420520	And I'm more of a Diablo person, so I don't follow the Starcraft news as much.
1420520	1424320	But at least when it comes to World of Warcraft, they're very embracing of the mod community
1424320	1425320	there.
1425320	1430140	So maybe they're laughing at this too, I don't know.
1430140	1431900	It's pretty neat.
1431900	1436880	I'm not planning on picking up the game, though, because I don't think I was either a Starcraft
1436880	1441280	or a Warcraft type of person.
1441280	1446300	Although I did play the original Warcraft, but that was how long ago I played the original
1446300	1447300	Warcraft.
1447300	1448300	That would have been about 15 years ago.
1448300	1450560	The original Warcraft's pretty old.
1450560	1451560	Yeah.
1451560	1453840	So, that's it.
1453840	1454840	Alright.
1454840	1457400	And I'll have you know, I didn't actually buy Warcraft.
1457400	1461000	I played the demo in PC Gamer.
1461000	1464400	That's how old.
1464400	1470040	Going to our listeners' chats here at chat.orangetonstrategy.com, Tigerclaw says, Sky, you should call your
1470040	1475560	mother during the show, and also Lumi's follows up, any chance of the OLR crew calling their
1475560	1476560	moms?
1476560	1477960	I remember y'all tried a few months ago and it was a lot of fun.
1477960	1481840	Yeah, you know, I already called my mom this morning and we chatted about that, because
1481840	1484400	she said I was surprised I wasn't, or she was surprised I wasn't calling her during
1484400	1487080	the show, and I was like, well, you know, we just, we kind of did that bit a couple
1487080	1488080	weeks ago.
1488080	1491040	I called my mom and talked to her while I was waiting to get in the restaurant.
1491040	1493080	I already did stuff with my mom this week.
1493080	1497520	But I did tell my mother, just for you all, that I consider my mother to be like the Betty
1497520	1503840	White of Orange Lounge Radio, so, there you go, and of course all of our moms are really
1503840	1504840	great.
1504840	1509080	But so, not today, we're not going to call them today, but maybe in the future, you know,
1509080	1513880	that whole time, the last time we called mom was related to a chat room comment, I believe.
1513880	1517120	Some chatter said something and I called my mother as a result of it.
1517120	1518120	So stay tuned.
1518120	1519120	You never know what will happen.
1519120	1523200	Let's see, other comments from our chat room at chat.orangetonstrategy.com, Bochi Kawa
1523200	1528160	talking about the cataclysm leaks, Sky, remember not all leaks are unintentional.
1528160	1531800	Blizz only gets more people interested for what they're showing off in cat.
1531800	1535480	That's true, you know, I'm sure Blizzard to some extent realizes that a lot of the stuff
1535480	1538760	they put in the Friends and Family Alpha is going to be out there, even though it's all
1538760	1539760	under NDA.
1539760	1544120	And they've come out and said, hey, all this stuff is still under NDA, although it hasn't
1544120	1547920	stopped MMO Champion from running everything.
1547920	1553960	But I think to some extent, anything they put out there they realize is going to leak.
1553960	1558360	But there's a lot that isn't in the cataclysm beta right now.
1558360	1564380	Like not every zone apparently has been overhauled yet.
1564380	1568120	And I don't think the Goblin and Worgen zones, like we're not hearing a lot of information
1568120	1569480	about really what's happening there.
1569480	1574640	So I think there's still a lot to kind of be discovered that isn't in the alpha yet.
1574640	1579920	Remember it's in the alpha, really, really early testing stage, and not finalized by
1579920	1580920	any means.
1580920	1582880	Everything is subject to change.
1582880	1588480	Anyhow, one thing that also could change in the future, apparently the Wii and Nintendo
1588480	1593140	in general might be kind of reconsidering their stance on online, because apparently
1593140	1597000	Nintendo, you know, one place Nintendo fails hardcore is online.
1597000	1600660	And a lot of that has to do with, you know, the whole friend code thing was a little bit
1600660	1601660	silly.
1601660	1606280	And, you know, just that they haven't embraced the online gaming to the extent that Xbox
1606280	1609360	Live or even, you know, PlayStation Network has.
1609360	1614520	Well there's some comments that Miyamoto, of course the god of Nintendo in many ways,
1614520	1616320	brought us Mario and all these folks.
1616320	1620560	He talked to Edge Magazine and apparently was talking about online business this week.
1620560	1624960	Miyamoto said the following, quote, probably the other thing that we are desperate to realize
1624960	1627840	is the core online business structure.
1627840	1631600	Do we need to demand customers pay monthly fees to enjoy online activities?
1631600	1635240	Or give an online subscription that is free of charge but then offer something extra for
1635240	1637880	people to pay so they get some extra value?
1637880	1643400	With these core business strategies, I think we are less active than we should be.
1643400	1648080	Apparently it had come up in conversation that Nintendo actually wasn't being very proactive
1648080	1652060	with their online strategy because, well, they're not.
1652060	1655320	You know, basically if you look at what Miyamoto is saying in those quotes, I mean in my opinion
1655320	1659920	he basically says Xbox Live and then PlayStation, right?
1659920	1662120	Pay monthly fees to enjoy online activities.
1662120	1663240	That's Xbox Live.
1663240	1666920	Or give an online subscription that's free but something extra for people to pay.
1666920	1671640	That's PlayStation Network with their free model but you have like the core magazine
1671640	1673640	that has all the little frills in it and some of their other.
1673640	1677600	It's also kind of Xbox Live because you can access it for free.
1677600	1678600	True.
1678600	1683840	So, but Miyamoto does say don't forget that there is like a reward program for folks that
1683840	1687000	get their Wii's online if you help others.
1687000	1691780	But he did admit Nintendo hasn't been very proactive in developing such online activities
1691780	1693240	as an MMOG.
1693240	1694240	Hmm.
1694240	1695240	Who knows?
1695240	1702240	I mean, the door is still wide open I think to make a real Animal Crossing online game.
1702240	1704560	I would say the door is still open to that.
1704560	1710840	Not a rehashed frickin' original Animal Crossing game with online elements as the DS and Wii
1710840	1711840	ones were.
1711840	1714080	You could still make a full-fledged MMO for Animal Crossing.
1714080	1718280	Also Pokemon I think would lend itself to an MMO very well.
1718280	1721920	But could we perhaps see something at E3 this year?
1721920	1724560	I would guess probably not.
1724560	1728680	They're never going to embrace online, at least not with this console.
1728680	1730940	I would say probably not with this console either.
1730940	1734000	I don't think it's going to happen with the Wii but I think it's something you've got
1734000	1735360	to see in their next console.
1735360	1736360	They have to.
1736360	1742040	There's no... because they're basically saying, oh people don't really care about online.
1742040	1744040	Well, that's not true.
1744040	1747320	And then you see 11 million subscribers of World of Warcraft and you're like, well maybe...
1747320	1750200	Or all the people on Facebook and stuff.
1750200	1751200	That's still online.
1751200	1752600	I mean, it's not, you know...
1752600	1753600	That's true.
1753600	1756120	I'm surprised Nintendo doesn't try to do something with Facebook because a lot of it's the same
1756120	1757120	audience.
1757120	1758120	You know what I mean?
1758120	1759120	Mm-hmm.
1759120	1760120	In fact, wasn't there something...
1760120	1762680	Ah man, I'm thinking of something.
1762680	1763680	No, that was...
1763680	1765560	I think you're thinking of the parody stuff with Mario.
1765560	1766560	No, no, no, no.
1766560	1769240	I know there was that but there was something else I was thinking of.
1769240	1772320	I thought there actually was something with this whole, like, get your friends on the
1772320	1775880	Wii that somehow tied into Facebook but I could be wrong.
1775880	1776880	That's fine.
1776880	1777880	I'm wrong sometimes.
1777880	1778880	It happens.
1778880	1782680	So we'll see what happens with Nintendo in the future and their online presence but I
1782680	1786220	would say don't get your hopes up, at least with this generation.
1786220	1790680	They're gonna probably hype it up for whatever console is coming next and make it sound like
1790680	1791680	it's new.
1791680	1794360	Like, all these things are just new ideas that have never been done before.
1794360	1795360	We'll see.
1795360	1801840	Oh, and real quick, since we're on the topic of Nintendo and being that we did sort of
1801840	1806400	like a sort of secret club a few weeks ago, I have something to tie in with that.
1806400	1807400	Oh really?
1807400	1810640	It hasn't quite made it out there yet but we'll be out there soon enough.
1810640	1811640	I see.
1811640	1812640	Okay.
1812640	1814680	I wish I knew I would have brought up the secret club theme music.
1814680	1815680	No, that's alright.
1815680	1817400	It's really stupid.
1817400	1818400	Remember secret club?
1818400	1820320	I didn't hear it here.
1820320	1826180	So as you may remember, it was confirmed that today, actually, that the black Wii system
1826180	1832400	bundle with Wii Sports Resort and Wii Motion Plus and all the Wii Sports that came out
1832400	1839000	for the same price and, you know, great.
1839000	1841680	What they didn't mention is, it's always coming out white.
1841680	1843680	Ah, that's stupid.
1843680	1844680	Yeah.
1844680	1845680	I see exactly.
1845680	1850160	Okay, so that's good to know that the white Wiis aren't like going away or they're not
1850160	1852320	going to be collector's items or anything.
1852320	1858320	It's basically going to be, they're just going to do this for, I don't know how long.
1858320	1859320	Because it is limited.
1859320	1860920	It says on the box, limited edition.
1860920	1867160	But that might be just like, buy this, please, you know, so I don't know.
1867160	1872120	So basically, you will be able to pick when you go to the store if you want to make a
1872120	1875720	Wii and you'll have a big decision to make and that would be, do you want it black or
1875720	1876720	white?
1876720	1877720	Yes.
1877720	1890240	Do I get the Wii in black or do I get the Wii with the white glass?
1890240	1893760	Alright, anyway.
1893760	1896360	But that's the question shoppers everywhere are going to ask themselves.
1896360	1897360	Black or white?
1897360	1898360	Alright.
1898360	1899800	I am a dork.
1899800	1902200	Dark Sakura, what's up next?
1902200	1909280	Well, Nintendo has sent out a little plug for something that's supposed to happen for
1909280	1913280	June 16th, which is right during E3.
1913280	1918800	The official Nintendo Magazine is going to have a world exclusive in issue 57, which
1918800	1920600	is something.
1920600	1927320	But the quote goes, you may want to mark Wednesday 16th, June in your diary will be revealing
1927320	1934240	world exclusive details on a top secret new game in the next issue of O&M.
1934240	1936640	How do they know I have a diary?
1936640	1941960	I think that, given the way that the date's listed and diary, I would suspect that it's
1941960	1944640	European information.
1944640	1946520	Anyway.
1946520	1953480	But, um, maybe it's an excuse to try to get people to go out and buy more official Nintendo
1953480	1954480	Magazine.
1954480	1958720	All they have to do is say, Howard and Nestor, back for real, forever.
1958720	1959720	Howard, how about this?
1959720	1963840	I mean, it's like, why don't you just wait to see what's at E3, because I can guarantee
1963840	1965280	whatever's at E3 is going to be there.
1965280	1966960	It's what's coming out during E3, right?
1966960	1967960	June 16th?
1967960	1968960	Well, not everyone gets to go.
1968960	1970480	That's like the Wednesday of E3.
1970480	1974840	Yeah, but everybody that we know has internet access.
1974840	1981240	And if it's the June issue, typically the issues for one month come, for subscribers,
1981240	1984040	come out a month earlier.
1984040	1985560	This could be a time thing, though.
1985560	1989040	I mean, they could still be like the July issue, you know what I mean?
1989040	1990040	It's going to be timed.
1990040	1994480	Especially if it's sensitive information that is going to be blown at the E3 press conference.
1994480	1997160	They're going to make sure they don't leave headquarters until...
1997160	1998720	It'll be a new Zelda game.
1998720	1999720	That's all it is.
1999720	2000720	I mean, come on.
2000720	2001720	They've already been...
2001720	2003520	It's going to be the Nintendo money printer.
2003520	2006480	Hinting that they're going to be doing a new Zelda game.
2006480	2008080	Yay, new Zelda game.
2008080	2010160	X-Link in our chat room says, it's Earthbound!
2010160	2011160	Yay!
2011160	2014520	Hey, what if it's Kid Icarus?
2014520	2015880	Jizzed in my pants.
2015880	2020120	Although, you know, to be fair, I mean, I know, Loki, you're sitting over there going,
2020120	2021120	it's Zelda.
2021120	2022520	Big fucking deal.
2022520	2027120	Remember, one of the best games to come out last year, if not the best game to come out
2027120	2032280	last year, was A Blind Side by Nintendo at E3 that nobody saw coming.
2032280	2033840	And that was New Super Mario Brothers Wii.
2033840	2036000	Remember, there was no news on that before E3.
2036000	2037000	Wow, that's right.
2037000	2041280	I never saw them rehashing something that was on another system and re-releasing it
2041280	2042280	for another system.
2042280	2043280	You know what though, Loki?
2043280	2045120	That's so unlike Nintendo.
2045120	2048760	Your cynicism aside, it really was one of the best games to come out last year, if not
2048760	2049760	the best.
2049760	2050760	I mean, last year was not like an A++ game.
2050760	2052640	Yeah, you know why it sold a lot?
2052640	2057240	Because people that buy the Wii eat up anything that comes out that's Mario in it.
2057240	2058240	Have you played it?
2058240	2059240	It's a good game, and it's very accessible.
2059240	2060240	It's a platform game.
2060240	2061240	Woo, okay.
2061240	2062240	Yeah, it's a Mario game.
2062240	2066360	But it's very accessible to those that played the old Mario on the Nintendo NES.
2066360	2067720	It was a great game.
2067720	2070800	I understand it, that it's a Mario game, and it'll do really well.
2070800	2073740	Just like Super Mario Galaxy 2 will do really well.
2073740	2074820	Because it's a Mario game.
2074820	2077300	Because people buy Mario and Zelda.
2077300	2079880	And Pokemon.
2079880	2085020	I mean, if they came out with like, you know, an awesome Metroid game, and yes, I know Metroid
2085020	2089120	Other M is right around the corner, let me tell you something, Metroid Other M isn't
2089120	2091380	gonna sell as well as Mario.
2091380	2096040	If they dressed up Mario in the Samus suit, and had him going, you know, fighting Bowser
2096040	2100000	and stuff with a blaster, and he can turn into a ball and shoot bombs and stuff like
2100000	2105440	that, it would sell a billion copies, because people eat up Mario, which is like Apple and
2105440	2107520	their iPods.
2107520	2111160	I actually am gonna go out on a limb, and I could be dead wrong.
2111160	2114720	I don't think Mario Galaxy 2 is gonna sell as great as everyone thinks it is.
2114720	2115720	No, it's not.
2115720	2121560	I think there's gonna be this kind of like, just general rejection of the game.
2121560	2124880	What I think is interesting, and I don't think it's on our show world tonight, but I heard
2124880	2130080	something about they were releasing Mario Galaxy 2, not in America, but in other countries,
2130080	2137080	Japan and Europe, with a DVD that basically tells them how to play Mario Galaxy 2, and
2137080	2142320	how it's not that different from a, you know, the old school Mario, and kind of trying to
2142320	2144360	make the 3D game more accessible.
2144360	2149920	Ironic that it's on a DVD, if you think about what system it's coming out on, but that's
2149920	2151080	besides the point.
2151080	2153600	You know, that this tutorial video's coming out.
2153600	2158040	But it doesn't matter that the system doesn't play DVDs, who cares.
2158040	2163000	Really, they could include the videos on the actual disc, but, so what.
2163000	2171320	Um, cause if you remember, Mario Galaxy was the first dual-layer DVD game from Nintendo.
2171320	2175560	And it was a good game, like I'm not bagging on Mario Galaxy, and I'm not trying to say
2175560	2179680	that Mario Galaxy 2 won't sell well because it's like, you know, a bad game by any means.
2179680	2180680	No.
2180680	2184560	I, I don't know, it's just, I think you're gonna really see a difference between how
2184560	2187960	a game like New Super Mario Brothers Wii and that will be received.
2187960	2193720	I'm sorry, I'm dealing with the reason I'm saying that, you know, it's just, I don't
2193720	2196480	have high expectations for Nintendo.
2196480	2200640	That's, yeah, great, New Super Mario Brothers did well.
2200640	2204080	You know what, if it was a different Mario Brothers game, it was still done well.
2204080	2207640	Mario game during the fourth quarter, during holiday season, it's gonna be on everyone's,
2207640	2209440	you know, shopping list.
2209440	2211180	Of course it's gonna do well.
2211180	2212180	That's not a surprise.
2212180	2216800	But the thing is, Nintendo doesn't really do anything to surprise us.
2216800	2219440	For example, their latest announcement that was this week.
2219440	2225880	It was just like, really, really, I mean, there wasn't enough party games on the Wii
2225880	2233600	that you needed me party or Wii party, I mean, really, Wii party?
2233600	2234600	Was that necessary?
2234600	2238560	Where am I gonna get a good party game on the Wii?
2238560	2244560	I don't know, there's just none out there ever, ever.
2244560	2247600	If that's what people are gonna buy.
2247600	2253160	But just like, you know, don't try to pretend Nintendo that you're gonna just come out with
2253160	2257160	some sort of amazing product that's just gonna blow us all away, because I'll tell you what,
2257160	2261760	it's just gonna be a port of something or it's gonna be another Mario and Zelda game.
2261760	2263560	That's all it really is.
2263560	2267360	And those Mario and Zelda games, I bet you anything the new Zelda game, probably gonna
2267360	2269700	be exactly like the last Zelda game.
2269700	2272360	As far as engine goes, just new levels and stuff.
2272360	2278200	Maybe a few little, Link is gonna turn into a duck this time, I don't know, something
2278200	2279200	different.
2279200	2281200	It's just...
2281200	2285460	Duck Link!
2285460	2288840	Zelda 2, the adventures of quack.
2288840	2291840	Or like a Smash, Smash Brothers on DS might be cool, I don't know.
2291840	2296700	We'll just have to see what they come out with, but I guarantee it's just gonna be,
2296700	2301560	it's gonna be weird and awkward, just like we relax.
2301560	2304680	Act Deaf says they'll probably publish President Cat.
2304680	2308000	That will never happen.
2308000	2309000	No.
2309000	2312040	No, President Cat's not gonna happen, sadly.
2312040	2316520	I wish it would, you all know how I feel about it, but, uh, and there's, there's still my
2316520	2320920	dream that it'll be the big, maybe that's the big surprise reveal at E3.
2320920	2321920	President Cat.
2321920	2324920	No, when is this cat coming on stage?
2324920	2325920	Holy shit!
2325920	2326920	I will...
2326920	2330480	I probably won't get invited to the Nintendo press conference, but that's okay, I've tried
2330480	2331480	to stay in person.
2331480	2332480	It doesn't matter, they'll hear you yelling.
2332480	2335000	They'll hear me yelling from wherever I am.
2335000	2337000	What the hell?
2337000	2339040	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
2339040	2340800	You guys really did that?
2340800	2342160	You really did it?
2342160	2344320	Oh shit!
2344320	2346320	Is this real life?
2346320	2348720	Anyhow, let's move on, Loki.
2348720	2353080	President Cat'll never happen.
2353080	2355960	So other stuff, we can talk about Nintendo.
2355960	2360760	Of course they're gonna wanna step up their anti-piracy measures for the 3DS, seeing as
2360760	2366160	it's running rampant with the DS and the DSi, even though, oh yeah, we changed some stuff
2366160	2371640	to the DSi to make it harder to pirate, but yeah, that was defeated within little time
2371640	2372640	whatsoever.
2372640	2381040	But apparently, uh, they hate piracy, yes, oh my god, and, um, you know, of course now
2381040	2388400	that, you know, six years with the system being out, they wanna find ways to, um, stop
2388400	2389400	the piracy.
2389400	2396120	It says, uh, we have a strong sense of the crisis about this problem.
2396120	2398280	Which doesn't really say what they're gonna do.
2398280	2401920	We're aware of the problem!
2401920	2403440	Good!
2403440	2407160	No shit, cause you sued the companies that were doing the chips and stuff, right?
2407160	2408980	They went after all these people.
2408980	2411680	So no shit, you're aware of the problem.
2411680	2416460	How are you gonna make that perfect anti-pirate, I mean, doesn't Sony say this all the time?
2416460	2422720	We have made our next console unhackable, 48 hours later, lol hack.
2422720	2427620	I'm gonna tell you right now, unless the system has downloadable firmware updates that they
2427620	2434320	can do, something like that, um, the fact that these games are on a cartridge, there's
2434320	2436720	no way that they're gonna be able to stop piracy.
2436720	2441120	It will get broken, quickly.
2441120	2443120	Bold statement.
2443120	2445560	Let's look at the past history now.
2445560	2451800	Um, really the only system that's been hard to crack is the PS3, but as far as the system
2451800	2452800	is-
2452800	2455720	It's just cause Blu-ray has it really, you know, it's somewhat a new technology.
2455720	2460840	It's not necessarily that, it's just they have good encryption on stuff, but it's just,
2460840	2466240	look at the Nintendo systems, I mean the DS, the Game Boy Advance, it'll happen.
2466240	2471600	And especially in the sense, I'm assuming this, you know, this system is gonna have
2471600	2478840	some of the technology that's in the DS, cause it is gonna be backwards compatible.
2478840	2483320	So it probably won't be that difficult.
2483320	2486880	I'm planning on picking one up, cause I think it's gonna be neat.
2486880	2487880	Alright.
2487880	2491680	Um, well, let's move on to talk about some of the news, actually, wait, I gotta read
2491680	2494720	these A-plus comments from chat, cause there was some hilarious stuff, um, going back to
2494720	2500220	the whole duck Link thing, uh, stand in our chat room, A-plus comment, Link turns into
2500220	2504280	a donkey, and the next game will be called The Legend of Zelda, Zelda's Tijuana Donkey
2504280	2505280	Show.
2505280	2508640	Now that's a game I'd play.
2508640	2510980	Okay, anyway.
2510980	2516040	Or Link turns into a wolf, gets captured by Bob Barker and then neutered.
2516040	2520440	Little Big Planet 2 is going to be coming out, that's right, it's real, it's actually
2520440	2521440	happening.
2521440	2524840	If you like leaks and remember the guy a couple weeks ago whose song was confirmed to be in
2524840	2529360	the game, et cetera, et cetera, well apparently Game Informer has said it is coming and we're
2529360	2533320	gonna show off more information in our June issue of Game Informer.
2533320	2535000	So what exactly is going on?
2535000	2536800	Well some of the little details have leaked.
2536800	2542480	It is a whole new game, okay, this is coming from the Neo GAF forums, apparently Media
2542480	2547840	Molecule is making tools that will allow you to do racing games, space invader shooters,
2547840	2551720	puzzle games, role playing games, and strategy games.
2551720	2556840	They are just making this engine, it's not just for side-scrollers now.
2556840	2557840	That's the big difference here.
2557840	2561640	And the thing I heard I thought was the stuff from Little Big Planet 1 I think you're gonna
2561640	2565520	be able to bring into Little Big Planet 2.
2565520	2570560	Apparently a Media Molecule developer made a Command and Conquer clone in the game.
2570560	2575460	And they also were saying that they were able to, now you can really have good control over
2575460	2577960	like the cameras and stuff like that, the physics.
2577960	2580480	You're gonna be able to create and edit short films.
2580480	2583380	So this is gonna be Mashima Heaven, apparently.
2583380	2586040	You will be able to record your own sound effects.
2586040	2588960	I don't even know how that works, but that's what they're promising.
2588960	2592520	You will be able to move the game's camera around to make your own cutscenes using Sack
2592520	2593520	Boys.
2593520	2600360	And, and, and the Sack Bot, a fully customizable programmable enemy unit.
2600360	2603520	So you can control it yourself.
2603520	2605600	I almost think this is gonna be too much.
2605600	2606600	Like you know, part of what-
2606600	2608080	It is gonna be epic.
2608080	2611900	Part of what made Little Big Planet so cool was that it was relatively easy to make your
2611900	2617280	own levels, but there was still, it wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't easy to make a good level.
2617280	2618280	Let me put it this way.
2618280	2619280	Let me put it that way.
2619280	2623040	It's hard with, the problem you run into when you can do that is it's like you don't know
2623040	2624240	where to begin.
2624240	2627880	It's just like all these options, you don't know how to kind of focus it.
2627880	2632200	Whereas if you're limited somewhat, it's a little bit easier, okay, I gotta make a side-scrolling
2632200	2633200	game.
2633200	2637360	But people that want to expand beyond that to make like the space shooters and stuff,
2637360	2639160	you know, they're limited by what they can do.
2639160	2642520	So this, I think, since you're gonna have full control over the camera and stuff, you're
2642520	2646500	gonna see a lot of like maybe even top-down games and whatever.
2646500	2649200	But it's just gonna be nuts.
2649200	2653240	AlphaKananagram wants to jump in there and try to correct me, saying the PlayStation
2653240	2655560	Eye has a microphone.
2655560	2658760	That may- okay, so you'll be able to make your own sound effects, but I mean, what are
2658760	2662240	you gonna be able to make with a microphone on a camera besides like, you know, fart noises
2662240	2664280	and, you know, just like random screaming.
2664280	2667960	It'd be cool if you can import WAV files in MP3s, that'd be awesome.
2667960	2675000	Make your own background music, hello, although that also opens the door to like rampant piracy.
2675000	2680060	Like soon, not only will you be able to like listen to Lady Gaga leaks and whatever else
2680060	2683280	is leaking on the internet, that whole eye leaks thing.
2683280	2686840	Not only will you be able to do that on YouTube, but you'll be able to like go into Little
2686840	2691800	Big Planet and like listen to new songs because people will bring MP3s over.
2691800	2694600	That's great.
2694600	2696400	So yeah, this sounds pretty awesome.
2696400	2702560	By the way, there are some other little things trickling out about there, just that it's
2702560	2707320	just a more robust game that is not just side-scrollers.
2707320	2712240	And this kind of catches me by surprise because I thought Little Big Planet 2 would just be-
2712240	2715680	it would be like more side-scrollers, but probably like more you could do with it.
2715680	2719480	Like the enemy robot thing, like that I would think would have been the sequel, maybe a
2719480	2722160	couple other little things, but I wasn't expecting this much.
2722160	2728400	But to hear that you can make role-playing and strategy games, that's really big.
2728400	2729640	That sounds fun.
2729640	2731880	That sounds epic.
2731880	2738360	That's like erasing games, direct competition with themselves almost, is so weird.
2738360	2744200	But RPG Maker, you used to love that, you used to love the RPG Maker series.
2744200	2746700	It's just a lot to do though with RPG Maker.
2746700	2751760	That's the problem, is you don't really- trying to create an RPG or something, it's just a
2751760	2759240	lot of work with trying to create the storyline and all the different, you know, AI and sequences
2759240	2760240	and stuff.
2760240	2762760	It's just- it gets too difficult.
2762760	2769080	Like I think the most work that I did on an actual RPG or adventure game or something
2769080	2774200	was actually like in Megazooks, the ZZT sequel.
2774200	2778440	And the only reason why is because it was pretty much, you know, you can draw your levels,
2778440	2781880	make your little- place your enemies and stuff, you don't really do a lot of programming,
2781880	2785520	although I did have some boss characters and stuff like that, like a barrier to kill with
2785520	2786620	grenades.
2786620	2787620	But um-
2787620	2789360	Big Planet 3 ZZT edition.
2789360	2791520	But I mean, you know, that was awesome.
2791520	2796920	Seriously though, that's something that they need to bring to like a console or something.
2796920	2799840	One of these weeks we really need to highlight that as a classic game of the week.
2799840	2803440	I know that's not really Dark Soccer's alley, but if she's ever gone in a future week we
2803440	2804440	gotta-
2804440	2805440	Work on that, uh-
2805440	2808240	I could do a whole episode about how much I love ZZT.
2808240	2810520	It was a great game.
2810520	2815680	Or the create an OLR game in ZZT contest or something like that.
2815680	2819020	Well actually, Tigerkaw in our chatroom talking about this whole little Big Planet 2 says
2819020	2821080	somebody can make a level with clips from OLR.
2821080	2823320	I'm a little scared of what that might bring.
2823320	2826440	By the way, I thought this was neat too, they're also talking about PlayStation Eye integration
2826440	2828360	for loading levels using QR codes.
2828360	2831400	Are those like those barcodes like that are meant for cell phones and stuff?
2831400	2832400	I think so.
2832400	2835440	They're able to bring in levels just by holding up a little thing to your camera.
2835440	2836440	That's a-
2836440	2838560	You know what, that sounds like the e-reader.
2838560	2839560	Remember that?
2839560	2840560	Yeah.
2840560	2843440	Where they would put full Nintendo games on like five little cards.
2843440	2844440	Remember that?
2844440	2846000	That was awesome.
2846000	2852280	Um, wow, lots of stuff and uh, oh my gosh, just so much.
2852280	2855800	There's some uh, uh, spoilers of levels that are out there.
2855800	2860840	I guess I shouldn't give you too many spoilers, but they are talking about a tribute level
2860840	2864120	to all these old arcade classics.
2864120	2865880	Awesome.
2865880	2867360	More information to E3 I'm sure.
2867360	2870760	Ooh, I wonder if it'll be playable on the show floor.
2870760	2872600	Excited.
2872600	2874320	It'll definitely be part of their press conference.
2874320	2875320	Absolutely.
2875320	2878560	Didn't they- weren't they supposed to be having two press conferences or was that Microsoft?
2878560	2879560	That's Microsoft.
2879560	2881380	It's doing one just about in Natal, I believe.
2881380	2884560	I don't know if that's like a media night or what that- that's all about.
2884560	2885560	We'll see.
2885560	2888040	Dark Sakura, what you got for us?
2888040	2890520	More stuff Rob, more stuff.
2890520	2892640	In fact, more Nintendo.
2892640	2899440	Um, but this is actually specifically about Sin and Punishment, successor of the skies.
2899440	2906520	Um, the European box art has a reversible cover.
2906520	2912080	So you can actually put, um, have the Japanese box art on it.
2912080	2915760	It's not gonna look exactly like the Japanese box art because the big logo is not up at
2915760	2917600	the top side of it.
2917600	2921920	It's on the bottom, but it is the, uh, Japanese artwork.
2921920	2925800	And I was looking at the European box art.
2925800	2933680	I was- yeah, and it's just- it's not bad, but it's not as really good as the Japanese
2933680	2934680	one.
2934680	2941700	I think that it's actually- I mean, it's not bad, but the Japanese art is just really fantastic.
2941700	2944320	It's a really gorgeous piece of artwork.
2944320	2946800	So I'd say that's a treat.
2946800	2950200	I like it when you get fun little reversible things.
2950200	2955160	You know, also it was cool when we, when, um, Capcom did the Okami and I ordered mine
2955160	2958040	that I got five months later.
2958040	2960400	When you can like print your own and put them in there.
2960400	2964400	Like somebody did one for Wii Sports, it was kind of like fan made.
2964400	2969020	I would like to see, um, a lot of those Photoshop contests too that do like the retro style
2969020	2972880	book covers, but out of video games, there's been some very creative ones.
2972880	2976480	I'd like to just kind of fill up my gaming library with the alternative covers.
2976480	2977480	I think that'd be cool.
2977480	2981040	I'm gonna link this image though to the chat room because I think they'd really like to
2981040	2982680	see it, I hope.
2982680	2984760	If not too bad, I'm linking it anyway.
2984760	2989920	Um, going to our chat room, chat.orangelauncherator.com, Stan is asking, wasn't there already a Nintendo
2989920	2990920	cereal?
2990920	2993560	I'm sure it was a Mario cereal or a Zelda cereal.
2993560	2994880	Actually it was both.
2994880	2998080	And that was in response to a comment Act Deft had said, what's next Nintendo cereal?
2998080	2999560	It was the Nintendo Breakfast System.
2999560	3001200	Yeah, the Nintendo Breakfast System.
3001200	3004040	Um, and it had, uh- Got a little theme song.
3004040	3005920	Yes, it had both, right?
3005920	3007760	It's breakfast now.
3007760	3011080	It had both the, um, Nintendo or Mario and Zelda, right?
3011080	3012080	Yeah.
3012080	3016680	And it was split in the center, like those logos for the two game cartridges here.
3016680	3017680	Hold on.
3017680	3018680	Here we go.
3018680	3019680	Here we go.
3019680	3020680	Here we go.
3020680	3029200	This is going to take me way back y'all way back y'all before some of you were born.
3029200	3030200	It's too low.
3030200	3031200	It's too low.
3031200	3032200	They probably can't hear that in chat.
3032200	3033200	Hold on.
3033200	3034200	Let me try.
3034200	3035200	Let me try another one here.
3035200	3036200	This one.
3036200	3054800	Yeah, it had that little cardboard divider in the middle of the two bags.
3054800	3055800	Yeah.
3055800	3056960	Nintendo cereal system.
3056960	3057960	Yeah.
3057960	3058960	Nice.
3058960	3059960	I actually had that when I was a kid.
3059960	3061480	Uh, my brothers liked that stuff.
3061480	3062480	I thought it was nasty.
3062480	3063480	What did it taste like, Rob?
3063480	3064880	A fruit flavored crunch.
3064880	3068640	I thought you were going to say a fruit flavored crap.
3068640	3072560	It was, it tasted like, uh, Froot Loops to me.
3072560	3076200	I couldn't get over just how awful it smelled, but then again, my favorite cereal when I
3076200	3077920	was a child was Grape Nuts.
3077920	3082800	All right, let's move on to release dates and see what's coming out around the world.
3082800	3086960	Sadly, no new Nintendo cereal, but at least some video games coming out, hopefully.
3086960	3087960	Yes.
3087960	3090120	Uh, video games definitely on their way out this week.
3090120	3092120	I actually some pretty decent stuff.
3092120	3096440	Um, we've got some big game releases starting off with Lost Planet 2.
3096440	3101200	Uh, that's going to be making its way out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.
3101200	3103440	Sad, though, I was reading the reviews on it, man.
3103440	3110080	Just some real, I don't know, just okay reviews, not, you know, kind of gloating over the whole
3110080	3111080	thing.
3111080	3112080	Uh, oh.
3112080	3114480	Yeah, it's not, that's too bad.
3114480	3121800	Uh, Dance Sensation, Majesco's, I guess, version of Let's Just Dance, except not as good.
3121800	3124640	That'll be coming its way on the Wii.
3124640	3128280	Skate 3, coming out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this week.
3128280	3132960	A game I'm probably going to pick up, 3D Game Heroes, coming out on PlayStation 3.
3132960	3134640	Ooh, you'll have to tell me if that's worth getting.
3134640	3136520	I'm really, like, curious about that game.
3136520	3137520	The reviews have been excellent.
3137520	3138520	Really?
3138520	3139520	Excellent reviews.
3139520	3142440	So, I am definitely picking that up.
3142440	3145560	And that's really a dilemma for me, because that means I'm going to have to update my
3145560	3147720	firmware on my PS3.
3147720	3151480	Wait, were you trying to hold off on the whole Linux thing?
3151480	3152480	Yes, I was.
3152480	3154040	When do you ever use Linux?
3154040	3157280	Doesn't matter, it's not Linux that I'm interested in.
3157280	3159160	Oh, I see.
3159160	3165360	Uh, the expansion for Age of Conan, Rise of the Godslayer, coming out on PC this week.
3165360	3171840	Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3, coming out on PSP.
3171840	3177360	Batman Arkham Asylum, Game of the Year edition in 3D, coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox
3177360	3182240	360 this week.
3182240	3192760	Oh, also, of course, the real overpriced Xbox 360 USB flash drives will be coming out this
3192760	3195600	week on 8GB and 16GB.
3195600	3197920	Just seriously, just go buy a third party one.
3197920	3199920	It's way cheaper.
3199920	3200920	Okay.
3200920	3202840	And that's it.
3202840	3204560	Going to Japan on the Xbox 360.
3204560	3208520	Remember, last week was a dead week because of the holidays, so we're back in the swing
3208520	3209520	of things this week.
3209520	3213480	2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa comes out this week on the 360.
3213480	3216960	Also a game on the 360 called Metro 2033.
3216960	3217960	This is coming from THQ.
3217960	3219840	I have not heard a lot about what this game's all about.
3219840	3223720	It's a Russian first person shooter game, kind of like a post-apocalyptic type thing.
3223720	3224720	Ooh, looks like fun.
3224720	3225720	Is that coming out over here?
3225720	3226720	It came out last month.
3226720	3227720	Oh, did it?
3227720	3228720	It actually came out in March.
3228720	3230720	Well, it's not usually the type of game I would follow too much.
3230720	3231720	Same name?
3231720	3232720	Yeah, Metro 2033.
3232720	3234800	Oh, I just haven't heard much about this game.
3234800	3235960	Can't play them all.
3235960	3239240	That's coming out on the 360 in Japan this week, so I guess it's like a localized version
3239240	3240240	or what have you.
3240240	3244480	On the PlayStation 3, also the World Cup South Africa game makes its way to the PlayStation
3244480	3245480	3.
3245480	3246760	That's really it on the PS3.
3246760	3248280	Not a lot this week.
3248280	3251160	Lost Planet 2 actually doesn't come to Japan until next week.
3251160	3252680	Also a big, big soccer game next week.
3252680	3254660	We'll tell you more about that later.
3254660	3258560	Going up to the Nintendo Wii, also the FIFA World Cup South Africa game.
3258560	3261720	Other than that, not a whole lot coming out.
3261720	3268800	PlayStation 2 gets Daisen Ryaku, Daitoua Kobushi, Tora Tora Tora, where Kishu Ni Sekou Seri.
3268800	3271120	Yes, that is the full name of the game.
3271120	3272120	Best version.
3272120	3273120	It's the best hits.
3273120	3278720	So I think it's probably a price reduction of an existing PS2 game because are any developers
3278720	3281480	really making that many games anymore?
3281480	3282480	PlayStation 2?
3282480	3283480	Yeah.
3283480	3285840	Very few, but they're still coming.
3285840	3289880	Basically looks like your Ace Combat clone, so that's what you have on the PlayStation
3289880	3290880	2.
3290880	3295960	Lastly, looking at the handhelds and the PSP, you also have the World Cup South Africa game.
3295960	3300880	Hakioki Yugi Roku comes out as well on the DS and the PS.
3300880	3304520	I'm sorry, that's just the PSP where that is coming out.
3304520	3307880	I got my handhelds mixed up.
3307880	3312960	Hakioki Yugi Roku looks like, I don't know, they don't have a lot of screenshots of the
3312960	3317560	actual game, but these little chibi anime characters, kind of like in a school, a little
3317560	3321000	adventure game, so I don't know what the point is there though.
3321000	3322640	They don't say a lot about it.
3322640	3330760	So lastly on the DS, Trick DS Han Kakushi Kami no Sumo Kan is supposed to come out this
3330760	3331760	week.
3331760	3334720	It's known as Trick and it's from Konami.
3334720	3337600	So I don't know if this game's about getting tricks or what.
3337600	3338600	No.
3338600	3343680	I think it's, looks like kind of like a survival horror, but one of those slower paced adventure
3343680	3344680	games.
3344680	3351200	Like if something like Ace Attorney was like a survival horror game.
3351200	3352640	That's what Trick kind of looks like to me.
3352640	3355440	I think it's Ghost Trick is what it's coming out over here as.
3355440	3356440	Ah, okay.
3356440	3359960	And yes, and the reason why it looks like the Ace Attorney series, it's the same guy
3359960	3362240	that's doing the artwork for it.
3362240	3363240	So it's not just points.
3363240	3366960	Yeah, it is coming out over here as Ghost Trick later on from Capcom.
3366960	3369080	That's it for Japan, Dark Sakura.
3369080	3373200	Well, for Europe we have a few things.
3373200	3378800	On the 11th, we've got Age of Conan, Rise of the God Slayer, Lost Planet 2 for Xbox
3378800	3380200	360 and PS3.
3380200	3390040	On the 14th, we have Alan Wake, Naruto Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Skate
3390040	3391040	3.
3391040	3393400	That's about it.
3393400	3394400	Alright.
3394400	3398800	Just a couple more news stories for you guys, then we're going to get into the classic game
3398800	3400680	of the week.
3400680	3402320	But for now, some more news?
3402320	3410840	Yes, there was a countdown, well apparently if you got the platinum trophy on God of War
3410840	3419120	3, it gave you a link to a website run by Ready at Dawn, teasing a new God of War game.
3419120	3422960	Well, the new God of War game is going to be a PSP exclusive, it's called God of War
3422960	3429480	Ghosts of Sparta, and it is also being developed by Ready at Dawn, and looks pretty awesome.
3429480	3433600	No word exactly on when it's going to be coming out, probably something that will show around
3433600	3440400	at E3, but they were saying that it's going to feature state of the art visuals, and high
3440400	3446600	quality environments and characters, in addition, the Ghost of Sparta will offer 25% more gameplay
3446600	3448560	than it's PSP predecessor.
3448560	3449560	25%?!
3449560	3454000	That's almost a fourth!
3454000	3458280	And judging by the screenshots though, it does look pretty good.
3458280	3461320	And I'd say it's actually really good for a PSP game.
3461320	3467920	But I remember the God of War game, Chains of Olympus looked pretty awesome on the PSP,
3467920	3472560	played quite a bit of that one, and I probably have to check this out, I haven't gotten a
3472560	3477240	PSP game in a long time, I really need to check out a little big planet too on PSP,
3477240	3478240	I think that might be cool.
3478240	3483480	So I think they had some new levels in that, I don't know, right.
3483480	3485760	You sound so speculative.
3485760	3492080	Well, I have to find my PSP because I have like, I have a few PSPs, I can't remember
3492080	3497040	if I have one that still has an official firmware on it, I don't think I do.
3497040	3502600	Salacious Pop in chat says, the first PSP God of War had A++ visuals and gameplay, but
3502600	3506000	damn was the story milk toast and lame.
3506000	3507880	I like when people can use the word milk toast in a sentence.
3507880	3511520	I have not heard that used in a sentence in a very long time.
3511520	3515920	The last time I actually saw anything with milk toast in it was reading Bloom County.
3515920	3520160	Anyhow, one more story for you guys, and this is something that Loki was slightly referencing
3520160	3524640	earlier, it's actually kind of like an internet meme that ended up hitting the blogs.
3524640	3529960	This is about, I guess a NeoJaf GAF, I would say NeoJaf or NeoGaf, I don't know.
3529960	3531200	Neo games are fun.
3531200	3532200	Yeah, whatever.
3532200	3537240	That forum had a little contest, I guess you could say, a little photoshopping contest
3537240	3540400	about what would Mario look like if it was released today.
3540400	3545620	And some of the results are really funny, because you get kind of the achievement unlocked,
3545620	3548840	you know, hey, you got a one up, five gamer score.
3548840	3552320	Tutorial levels built in, you know, just kind of like they're doing with the new Mario games.
3552320	3557720	My favorite absolutely was the one that made it look like a Facebook game, you squashed
3557720	3561820	a Goomba achievement, and then it says, do you want to post this to your wall?
3561820	3564520	You just got an achievement in Super Mario Brothers.
3564520	3568960	So and so just got the Goomba squisher achievement and wants everyone to know.
3568960	3573440	And I thought that was so on point, I mean, so on point.
3573440	3576800	I mean, if you think about it, that's already there.
3576800	3583120	And I'm just as guilty as the next guy, PSP, or sorry, PS3 will post your achievements
3583120	3584120	to your wall.
3584120	3585560	Remember when everybody was kind of talking about that feature?
3585560	3587480	I mean, I'm sure some of you blocked it.
3587480	3593320	But you know, when I unlock trophies in Super Street Fighter, my wall knows about it.
3593320	3594320	That freaking Raptor thing.
3594320	3595360	Yeah, except for those of us that blocked him.
3595360	3599200	Alan runs that Raptor thing and every day I can see he's playing World of Warcraft.
3599200	3603320	And so if I know if that thing doesn't publish one day, I should probably make sure he's
3603320	3604320	okay.
3604320	3613000	So, all right, anyhow, I kind of need to see some of the concepts of what would happen
3613000	3614840	if Mario was released today.
3614840	3618840	Any, any, any ideas on what how it might be different if Mario was released today that
3618840	3622080	the chat chatters would or folks in studio?
3622080	3625960	I think we know what Mario would be like if it's released today, because we keep getting
3625960	3626960	Mario games.
3626960	3630120	And then, yeah, they have the tutorial levels in there.
3630120	3635400	And the reason why is because people nowadays don't want to spend the time to read the manual.
3635400	3640280	That's, granted, I think that's a good idea.
3640280	3647120	But remember, I know a lot of stuff now is coming out with digital, you know, digitally
3647120	3648120	and stuff.
3648120	3651280	So there isn't really necessarily manuals for it, but you think about it, though, if
3651280	3656080	you just want to jump into a game and play it, then, you know, back then you could do
3656080	3659020	that and there's no wasting time.
3659020	3661880	If you don't understand what's going off, or you have difficulty, then you can refer
3661880	3662880	to the manual.
3662880	3666440	Yeah, but think about, like, some of the greatest games from the 80s that were all, like, the
3666440	3667640	coin-op games.
3667640	3668820	You don't have a manual.
3668820	3670620	You should be able to just put in a quarter and play.
3670620	3673000	The button says fire.
3673000	3674000	That means fire!
3674000	3679560	Well, also, I mean, there are a lot of times they would have either, like, a little brief
3679560	3684560	tutorial, and I mean, like, five to ten second tutorial in the beginning.
3684560	3688080	Some of the Neo Geo games would say, okay, here's what you do, and there'd be instructions
3688080	3692800	on the cabinet so that, you know, okay, you know, 500 points gives me an extra life.
3692800	3697320	And you know, if I hit, you know, fire and jump together, I get a special attack.
3697320	3699160	Or like Street Fighter, too.
3699160	3702640	When they started making the newer cabinets, they would actually put on there little things
3702640	3704720	that had all the moves on them.
3704720	3706160	Yeah.
3706160	3710080	You can actually do that with some of the Neo Geo games that are out on Xbox Live, like,
3710080	3714000	I know Fatal Fury Special.
3714000	3718020	You can actually have the background just show that old little plastic card that has
3718020	3719880	the moves on it.
3719880	3721600	Pretty cool.
3721600	3723880	All right.
3723880	3728240	Let's get into a segment here on the show we do every week, and it's a lot of fun because
3728240	3730120	we get to talk about old stuff.
3730120	3733480	It's a classic game of the week!
3733480	3737600	Dark Sakura's going to dive into the vault and pull out a classic video game that she
3737600	3743520	thinks, you know what, you ungrateful little kids out there, you should try a classic game
3743520	3745560	and know your roots a little better.
3745560	3746560	Do it!
3746560	3747560	Where you came from.
3747560	3748560	Do it!
3748560	3749560	Delete!
3749560	3750560	All right, so what game should they be playing this week?
3750560	3751560	Final Fantasy II.
3751560	3752560	Ah.
3752560	3753560	As in...
3753560	3754560	You mean actual Final Fantasy II.
3754560	3756040	The actual Final Fantasy II.
3756040	3757040	All right.
3757040	3759240	Which I actually own the cartridge of, by the way.
3759240	3760240	Very nice.
3760240	3767280	We're going to take a look here at some of the music from Final Fantasy II, if we can.
3767280	3769280	Let's see.
3769280	3774200	I actually had the number that I gave you on that was to the battle music.
3774200	3775200	But anyway.
3775200	3777000	A little hard to get to the exact right point on YouTube.
3777000	3778000	Sorry.
3778000	3779000	Oh.
3779000	3782600	Well, at any rate, this is the theme, you know.
3782600	3784520	Yeah, you can skip up.
3784520	3785520	Anyway.
3785520	3792400	Final Fantasy II was actually pretty innovative on the, uh, an innovative sequel to the last
3792400	3793400	Final Fantasy.
3793400	3795440	Well, to the first one.
3795440	3805000	It's a, of course, like every Final Fantasy with a fresh number is, it's a different series
3805000	3810280	of characters, a different world, a different dimension.
3810280	3818960	So this one is, there's these four people that are killed in an army invasion in Palamicia.
3818960	3823760	And three of the characters join a rebellion and the other one turns out missing.
3823760	3829280	So with this one, it actually brought in a lot of stuff that we, you know, take for granted
3829280	3831080	now in a Final Fantasy game.
3831080	3834720	Like chocobos and Cid.
3834720	3836240	There's always a Cid.
3836240	3837240	Correct.
3837240	3840720	A lot of people assume that chocobos were in the very first game as well as Cid and
3840720	3842720	they, those didn't appear till two.
3842720	3843720	No.
3843720	3844720	You are right, Rob.
3844720	3849760	It also got rid of experience point leveling.
3849760	3851720	And of course the later ones used it.
3851720	3858200	But it used a system where statistics increased depending on how you use the character or
3858200	3862560	how you acquire, I guess, you know.
3862560	3867000	I keep in mind, when I first started playing this game back in the day, I was playing a
3867000	3869960	ROM in Japanese and I kind of gave up.
3869960	3875520	I played through a bit more of three than I did of two, but I'm really, I'm really enjoying
3875520	3876520	it now.
3876520	3879360	Well, the best way to level is to beat your friends, basically.
3879360	3893240	Well, anyway, the, it's actually was kind of, well, you know, they were going to do
3893240	3895200	this one, Rob.
3895200	3899960	Nintendo actually has, what you're looking at now for our YouTube thing is off the prototype
3899960	3901160	that Nintendo did.
3901160	3902160	Oh wow.
3902160	3905680	So that's where they got the prototype translation.
3905680	3910400	This one had another really cool thing, as you can see on the video now, Rob, where you
3910400	3918760	have a memory system where, excuse me, you can, a keyword will pop up and you can ask
3918760	3923440	to learn the keyword and once you learn the keyword, you can go talk to different people
3923440	3927640	and if it gives you the opportunity to ask them, you can use a different keyword and
3927640	3932120	they'll give you new information based on using that keyword.
3932120	3938680	Like the first one that you get in, you know, right when you joined the rebellion is, I
3938680	3943600	think it's wild rose and you can go around and you see wild rose to random people and
3943600	3946800	they're like, I'm really Ivy in this prototype.
3946800	3948920	I'm really not a senile old man.
3948920	3949920	I'm a super blacksmith.
3949920	3954400	That's why I'm hanging out in the blacksmith shop, the blacksmith shop, anyway, he's like,
3954400	3958440	I don't want them to think I'm anything other than a silly old man, but so your characters
3958440	3962840	in here, and actually I don't remember that the characters had, do the characters have
3962840	3964380	names?
3964380	3968120	The warriors of light have names in the Japanese version cause I don't think they did.
3968120	3972720	Uh, I believe, I think you could just name them and they had default names kind of like
3972720	3973720	our words here.
3973720	3981560	In the U S one, well, there was, you know, fighter, you know, BL mage, you know, or B
3981560	3983520	major or whatever.
3983520	3990640	Um, this one, um, the characters, you have Furion or Freoniel in the Japanese version.
3990640	3995080	And then you've got Maria guy who, when they brought this out on PlayStation, his name
3995080	4000080	was Gus and Leon in Japanese version, his name was Leonhardt.
4000080	4004960	And then, um, you spend like a lot of the game looking for Leon, by the way, um, you
4004960	4008240	can also get other people that hang out with you from time to time in your party, like
4008240	4016400	Gordon and Joseph and Layla, Minwoo, uh, the PlayStation version was Mindu and, uh, Richard
4016400	4017400	Highwind.
4017400	4018400	Yeah.
4018400	4019400	We noticing themes that come up in later games.
4019400	4029120	Highwind, you know, Leonhardt sound familiar a little bit, um, again, this is one that
4029120	4033160	really, really, you know, set a big theme.
4033160	4038560	And also of course, Furion and Matthias, who was the emperor, um, the bad guy in the game,
4038560	4044920	uh, they both were in Dissidia, um, as their versus each other character.
4044920	4051320	And um, but I'm not really going to get too much into the story.
4051320	4055240	The other thing though about this, another class that this introduced was the Dragoon.
4055240	4060600	Um, so the Dragoon and the Dark Knight, you could, well, you could sort of get kind of
4060600	4066960	a Dark Knight, but this was, this had Dark Knights and Dragoons in them, um, a lot more
4066960	4071400	story driven, a lot more character driven too than the, um, previous versions.
4071400	4078560	Um, as far as, well, the previous version, I should say, um, now another thing is that
4078560	4086260	it did have re-releases, and I was really irritated, um, because I was waiting for Final
4086260	4090840	Fantasy 3 to come out on the Wonderswan color, because I have the remake of the first Final
4090840	4095480	Fantasy on the Wonderswan color, which was beautiful, it was gorgeous.
4095480	4098400	And then Final Fantasy 2 came out, and I was like, ah, I didn't play too much of it, I
4098400	4101760	was waiting for Final Fantasy 3, and then they went right to 4.
4101760	4109980	Um, but they did, um, a collection re-release for the Playstation in 2002, um, that was based
4109980	4115040	off the Game Boy Advance re-release of Final Fantasy 1 and 2 Dawn of Souls, and then it
4115040	4120580	came out on mobiles later, and then, um, the PSP version in 2007, and then the Japanese
4120580	4126400	Wii Virtual Console got, um, a version last year on June 16th.
4126400	4133920	Now, um, what I think is super cool, and, you know, this, this makes me really happy,
4133920	4139880	is that we've, we've had other releases now, Final Fantasy Origins was the first release
4139880	4150440	outside of Japan, um, but it came out on iPhone, and I have been digging it on iPhone, and
4150440	4155280	I think part of it for me was not being able to read all that well when I was playing it,
4155280	4159840	you know, the first time, but now that I'm actually playing it in English, I'm, I'm having
4159840	4160920	a pretty good time playing it.
4160920	4165680	The iPhone controls are interesting, but it's, it's, it's really, I think, as good as they
4165680	4169280	could expect to do those controls, it actually works fairly well.
4169280	4177400	Um, the way that it sold in 2003, um, well, by March 31st, 2003, with all of its re-releases,
4177400	4186240	it had 1.28 million copies worldwide, worldwide, and, uh, with 1.08 million of those in Japan.
4186240	4193120	Um, it was just, it's a really good game, I suggest everyone play it, so.
4193120	4201000	Oh, also it got a, a novelization, um, that was, uh, put out by Kadokawa Shoutou to Japan.
4201000	4202000	That came out in 89.
4202000	4203000	Hmm.
4203000	4204000	So, very cool.
4204000	4205880	I like that game.
4205880	4209440	Final Fantasy II is your classic game of the week, and it's available originally on the
4209440	4213520	NES, but probably a little more accessible on some of those, uh, redone versions, the
4213520	4219380	Dark Sakura earlier referenced, most commonly the PSP these days, and the iPhone versions,
4219380	4221000	so check it out, Final Fantasy II.
4221000	4224680	All right, uh, we're gonna go ahead and use this opportunity to take a quick break, but
4224680	4228000	when we come back, we have plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio, uh, we're gonna talk
4228000	4232080	about some of the fan films that have hit the internet, um, a new Bimani game, and a
4232080	4236560	new non-Bimani game, but might as well be a Bimani game, uh, and, uh, talk a little
4236560	4238680	bit about, uh, a game called Baby Maker.
4238680	4241240	Yes, that's right, Baby Maker.
4241240	4251760	So we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, so stick around.
4251760	4258040	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, this, uh, 366th episode of our show, May 9th,
4258040	4261160	2010, already in progress, we're here for part B.
4261160	4265840	More news, fast topics, and all that fun stuff, uh, in a few weeks, here at Orange Lounge
4265840	4272080	Radio, E3 is gonna be filled with tons and tons and tons of news this year, um, sadly
4272080	4276600	low-key Dark Sakura not able to attend due to that thing called real life, and, like,
4276600	4280840	having a real life, like, what's up with that, uh, but me, since I have no life, I am going,
4280840	4284680	and, um, hoping to bring you some special content from E3, we're not sure if it's gonna
4284680	4288920	be a daily show or what, uh, but hopefully some good interviews for Orange Lounge Radio,
4288920	4292480	and, uh, some other good stuff for the future, more info on that as we get a little closer
4292480	4293480	to the show.
4293480	4297960	Anyhow, uh, let's get back into some gaming news, we have some fast stuff we like to call
4297960	4303160	rapid-fire topics, and, uh, Loki's gonna start it off.
4303160	4304160	I hope.
4304160	4305160	Yes, I am.
4305160	4306160	Hey, there you go.
4306160	4308840	Um, so it's kinda cool, you know, even though the game's not out yet, they're already
4308840	4313120	talking about download content for Red Dead Redemption, and the first piece of download
4313120	4317400	content is gonna be coming shortly after its release in June, and it will be getting a
4317400	4321120	free co-op, um, expansion, which is kinda cool.
4321120	4326840	They're gonna have, um, some new, I guess, I'm not sure if these are missions, including
4326840	4331980	Walton's Gold, uh, which is apparently, uh, Walton's Gang has taken control of a mining
4331980	4336680	camp rich with gold, and you have to fight through the camp to, uh, load your mine cart
4336680	4340520	as with as much gold as you can carry and get out of there fast, and then they have
4340520	4345680	the river where you ride a raft down a river, taking out rebel encampments along the way,
4345680	4350920	and ammunition, which, uh, the Mexican army has, I guess, a town under siege, and you
4350920	4356320	have to storm the gates under heavy cannon fire, and, um, that sounds kinda cool, and
4356320	4361920	those are gonna be compatible with, uh, up to two to four players, and it doesn't say
4361920	4367200	exactly when, um, they'll be coming out in June, but sometime during June.
4367200	4372320	Also, they're saying that they're gonna be having some more, um, uh, two more additional
4372320	4379680	download content updates over the summer, and, however, those are unlikely to be free,
4379680	4385720	and pricing, I guess, will be announced later on, um, and then, of course, in May, we've
4385720	4393520	got some, uh, more songs becoming available for Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero, um, starting
4393520	4400600	off with May 6th, the Classic Rock Track Pack 3, which you can get the whole pack for 440
4400600	4409560	Microsoft points, or $5.49 in regular money, and that includes, uh, Jukebox Hero by Foreigner,
4409560	4414080	Sweet Home Alabama by Leonard Skynyrd, and Take the Money and Run by the Steve Miller
4414080	4415080	Band.
4415080	4416080	Wow.
4416080	4417080	There really is-
4417080	4418080	I love that song.
4418080	4425060	There's a Guitar Hero pack coming out with Foreigner, Skynyrd, and Steve Miller Band.
4425060	4432000	That's like the county fair pack right there.
4432000	4434000	Of course-
4434000	4438720	I was driving home from the bay today, and, you know, you have to kind of drive through
4438720	4441600	the middle of nowhere to get between San Francisco and SAC, right?
4441600	4447840	And sure enough, come into Dixon, the Dixon County Fair, Foreigner, high blooded.
4447840	4456320	And also, of course, the Classic Rock Track Pack was available May 6th, of course it will
4456320	4460960	not be available for Playstation 3 until May 11th.
4460960	4466720	Also on May 11th, the Alternative Pop Track Pack coming out, same pricing there.
4466720	4472960	Included with that would be Face Down by Alpha Rev, Lode by Capra, and You're All I Have by
4472960	4475400	Snow Patrol.
4475400	4482680	Those are also available for 160 Microsoft points each, or 200 Wii points, $2 is real
4482680	4483680	money.
4483680	4489560	And finally, the Aerosmith Track Pack, which includes Livin' on the Edge, Lovin' an Elevator,
4489560	4490560	and Ragdoll.
4490560	4491560	Wait, wait, wait.
4491560	4493240	Didn't Aerosmith have like a Guitar Hero game already?
4493240	4497440	They may have with all those tracks in there, but hey, if you don't have those-
4497440	4499560	Why not buy them all over again?
4499560	4500560	Why not?
4500560	4501560	Exactly.
4501560	4508440	So, uh, it's too bad you can't import the tracks into your next, uh, new version of
4508440	4512480	the game like Rock Band, otherwise that problem might not be a problem at all.
4512480	4515320	Side note, they did confirm a Guitar Hero 6 this week.
4515320	4516320	Wow.
4516320	4518760	File that under no shit.
4518760	4522960	I think they've already said that they were doing that, same with the DJ Hero 2.
4522960	4523960	That's already been confirmed.
4523960	4524960	Well, whatever.
4524960	4529720	Anyways, uh, other stuff that's coming out on the Xbox Live Marketplace in May, including,
4529720	4537000	uh, let's see here, May 17th, the deal of the week will be, uh, Secret of Monkey Island
4537000	4538000	Special Edition.
4538000	4540040	You're gonna be able to get that for half off for $5.
4540040	4545680	Uh, they're also gonna have some Avatar items as well, uh, Lee Chuck pirate hat for, uh,
4545680	4554400	50 cents, and Avatar cotton swab, yes, the giant cotton swab for, um, I guess a dollar.
4554400	4555400	Mmkay.
4555400	4559560	Uh, you know, that's more expensive than an actual cotton swab, by the way.
4559560	4560960	You paid a whole dollar for that?
4560960	4565120	No, I wouldn't pay for that, but yeah, that's what they're asking for.
4565120	4568880	Um, new games on demand are gonna be coming out, um, last week we had Brothers in Arms
4568880	4574640	Hell's Highway and Prince of Persia, um, this week on the 11th we have Tom Clancy's End
4574640	4582600	War, uh, May 18th in the Asian region, uh, Command & Conquer 3, and on May 25th Battlefield
4582600	4587000	2 Modern Combat will be available in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand only.
4587000	4591920	Well, I was gonna say, when did they start doing, like, new games on demand every week,
4591920	4595200	but they're not really doing new games on demand every week, it's just that other regions
4595200	4596200	are getting it.
4596200	4597200	Okay.
4597200	4603280	Um, last week we had Xenoclash Ultimate Edition for $15, 1200 microsoft points, and Raystorm
4603280	4608600	HD also for $15, it's like $15 and new $10, I don't know.
4608600	4613720	Uh, this week on May 12th, Rocket Knight Adventures will be coming out for $15 or 1200 microsoft
4613720	4618840	points, and on June 2nd, which technically isn't May, even though this is a May list,
4618840	4624280	and technically isn't a game I care about, um, Snoopy Flying Ace coming out for $10.
4624280	4625280	Snoopy!
4625280	4628280	Guess what, that's $10 more than you should really pay for that.
4628280	4629960	Will Snoopy be fighting the Red Baron?
4629960	4632560	Oh, probably, cause that's all he ever does.
4632560	4634920	Get over it, that was World War II!
4634920	4638720	Will Woodstock be in there to talk in his little lines?
4638720	4641360	I always loved Woodstock's speech.
4641360	4642360	I don't know.
4642360	4648200	Um, and then the Avatar Marketplace will be getting some Final Fantasy XIII and Gamer
4648200	4649200	items.
4649200	4652920	I wonder if those Final Fantasy XIII items were the same ones that you got for registering
4652920	4653920	the game.
4653920	4654920	Don't know.
4654920	4661480	Uh, Army of Two and Kingdom for Kefling items will be available on May 13th as well.
4661480	4666160	Finally download content, uh, no doubt it's getting the Tragic Kingdom album for Rock
4666160	4669560	Band, which I think that came out last week.
4669560	4671480	Yeah, we talked about it last week.
4671480	4678800	Uh, Lips is getting the Miley Cyrus song pack, oh boy, and, uh, Forza Motorsport 3 getting
4678800	4687640	the Exotic Car pack, uh, Super Street Fighter IV getting the Super Shuriken pack, and, uh,
4687640	4692520	Dragon Age Origins getting the Darkspawn Chronicles pack as well.
4692520	4697720	And also, um, sometime, they didn't say when, Magic the Gathering Duels of the Planeswalker
4697720	4700100	will be getting the second expansion pack.
4700100	4704080	You know, speaking of, um, Snoopy and all that stuff, when Loki was reading a lot of
4704080	4709640	those releases, um, you know, those really exciting releases for the month of May, uh,
4709640	4713600	this is kind of what I was hearing was, um, a lot of, um, you know, the, uh, uh, teacher
4713600	4715600	from, uh, Charlie Brown.
4715600	4719600	He said my name.
4719600	4722600	Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah.
4722600	4725600	Wah wah wah wah.
4725600	4727600	Okay, Ms. Trombone.
4727600	4732400	Alright, well, hopefully something a little more exciting, no disrespect to Loki, it's
4732400	4736320	just there's not a lot of exciting stuff on Xbox in May, I'm sorry, it's just, I'm not
4736320	4737320	hearing anything exciting.
4737320	4739600	Alright, uh, how about Tron?
4739600	4742600	Tron, wake up, hello, Tron, you like Tron?
4742600	4747240	Okay, well, Tron, of course, was based around a game called Space Paranoids, was kind of
4747240	4748520	like the game in Tron.
4748520	4753760	Well, guess what, now, um, you can actually play Space Paranoids online.
4753760	4759520	That's right, it's at spaceparanoidsonline.com, if you wanna actually go play the game, uh,
4759520	4760800	you can check it out.
4760800	4764840	Uh, apparently it was already, um, at, like, San Diego Comic Con, but now it's there in
4764840	4770760	fifteen levels and, you know, you get to blow stuff up, have fun.
4770760	4777040	Uh, also, uh, some new developments in the Silver Lining, uh, drama that's going on.
4777040	4780600	You might remember the Silver Lining, um, cause we actually had them on our show a while
4780600	4781600	ago.
4781600	4785800	It was a fan project for a King's Quest IX, basically, but, uh, at the end of the day,
4785800	4789000	they had to take the King's Quest name off of it if they wanted to actually release the
4789000	4793160	game, and, uh, then when Activision got the rights to the game, they were like, well,
4793160	4796520	you're not releasing that game, and they were like, but boo hoo, we spent so many years
4796520	4797520	making it.
4797520	4803360	Well, here's the deal, um, apparently, uh, I guess it has come full circle that, uh,
4803360	4808360	it might actually be able to, uh, be released after all.
4808360	4813040	Um, there's this whole epic piece that was written on the game, uh, that Kotaku ran this
4813040	4817120	week that kind of traces everything from the beginning towards where things kind of were
4817120	4822760	at as of April of 2010, which is when Activision really wasn't calling, uh, people, but actually
4822760	4827320	Kotaku and some of the other folks actually started kind of bugging Activision for them,
4827320	4831360	and, uh, Activision actually told Kotaku, um, the situation came to our attention a
4831360	4835560	few months ago, and it seems more and more appropriate all the time that the game is
4835560	4838960	called The Silver Lining, no matter how many stumbling blocks we run into, whether it's
4838960	4842160	random bickering about tiny issues or what have you, I'm sorry, this is from one of the
4842160	4846260	makers, not actual, uh, Activision there, um, there's actually, like, I guess a silver
4846260	4851040	lining to it all that they may actually be able to release the game after all.
4851040	4856400	So you can check that out, um, Kotaku ran this story on, um, what was this, uh, May
4856400	4861400	3rd was the date that they ran it, and kind of this whole little epic piece about it,
4861400	4865600	and, uh, yeah, Activision, I guess, finally getting in touch with them, realizing they
4865600	4866600	were being dicks.
4866600	4869000	Got the big stick out their butt.
4869000	4870000	Mm-hmm.
4870000	4871440	Bobby Kotak clearly was not involved.
4871440	4878760	Uh, also, coming out on the Wii soon, uh, a very exciting game called My Fireplace,
4878760	4882720	that is if the ESRB is to be believed, there will be a game called My Fireplace, and you'll
4882720	4888720	be able to actually, you know, have your own fireplace, you can put logs on the fire and
4888720	4892600	decorate the mantle, and pump air in the fireplace to keep it going.
4892600	4894400	That better be free.
4894400	4900400	Sadly, it's, it's probably WiiWare, I would guess it's probably gonna be $10 WiiWare.
4900400	4902800	Well, people do buy those fireplace DVDs.
4902800	4907260	And Blu-rays now, and, uh, didn't Xbox have one of those last year?
4907260	4908260	A fireplace sim?
4908260	4909260	Mm-hmm.
4909260	4913480	I think an Xbox fireplace sim is the more appropriate, you know, console for that, being
4913480	4917360	that it can put out the heat of a fireplace as well.
4917360	4923600	Ba-dum-bum, uh, yeah, the, uh, Wii, uh, fireplace thing deserves to be in the, uh, fireplace.
4923600	4927960	My JTAG console, because I do have programs on there that measure the, um, heat off of
4927960	4928960	it.
4928960	4934280	The GPO on it runs about 77 degrees Celsius, and, let me put it this way, uh, for like
4934280	4939240	your, your regular dual core chips, that's like, that's way too hot.
4939240	4940240	Way too fuckin' hot.
4940240	4945800	Thankfully, you can use a software, uh, mod in there to upgrade the fans to 12 volt mods,
4945800	4951840	and it drops temperature down to like 50, but, seriously, 77 degrees Celsius, your Intel
4951840	4954120	processor chips don't run that hot.
4954120	4959200	Uh, real quick before we get to Dark Soccer's story, some comments from our chat room, uh,
4959200	4963160	some of the folks in chat, um, are, uh, DJ Dark Knight says, can't wait for Rocket Knight,
4963160	4967000	and Act F says Rocket Knight, awesome, so I guess there is at least one, uh, game to
4967000	4972400	look forward to in May, um, and Toygak, uh, commenting on the Wii fireplace, says, uh,
4972400	4976680	fucking shitty WiiWare can go choke on a piece of my anatomy.
4976680	4978520	I'll leave, uh, that to your imagination.
4978520	4979520	Elbow!
4979520	4981800	That's right, go choke on an elbow.
4981800	4982800	Pork chop.
4982800	4983800	That's right.
4983800	4984960	Suck my kneecap.
4984960	4988040	I've just been telling Dan that I'm gonna punch him in the pork chop so that he can
4988040	4991540	specify in his brain whatever organ he wishes that to be.
4991540	4993840	It was the liver for a while.
4993840	4999440	Anyway, um, for Star Trek fans, there is an unofficial demo, I'm sorry, an unofficial
4999440	5005200	Star Trek game, um, that's got a demo, uh, out, it's, uh, called, uh, Star Trek Adventures
5005200	5012400	Year One, it's a fan project, it looks kinda, well, not great, but-
5012400	5014040	A fan project!
5014040	5015040	Yeah.
5015040	5022040	Um, it, it looks along the lines of, uh, old school Star Trek games, like maybe from the,
5022040	5026280	uh, late, mid to late 90s possibly.
5026280	5035760	Um, you can, uh, go to, uh, the, uh, official homepage for the, uh, uh, project, which is
5035760	5040260	just StarTrekAdventuresAllInWord.com slash year one.
5040260	5044320	See if you like it, let us know, I won't play it, I've got Star Trek Online.
5044320	5047520	And the next story, which is one that Rob gave me the wrong link to and I had to go
5047520	5048520	find.
5048520	5049520	Oh, I'm sorry, my bad.
5049520	5050800	Yeah, you sound so sad.
5050800	5054120	I'm sorry you had to do work tonight, Jamie, I'm very sorry to inconvenience you.
5054120	5055120	Hey!
5055120	5056120	I do work!
5056120	5057120	It requires pirates!
5057120	5058120	Argh!
5058120	5059120	Plundering!
5059120	5060120	Shooting!
5060120	5063120	Plundering the booty!
5063120	5064120	Keelhauling!
5064120	5071600	Um, it will be on the Wii in the fall and has, um, so it's got some mini games, it's
5071600	5079560	put up by 2K China, oooh, with streamlined controls for the Wii mode, oooh!
5079560	5086080	And so the mini games, um, the two new ones would be Bombardment and Lockpicking, oooh,
5086080	5091760	and you can have character and ship customization options, oooh.
5091760	5097960	Anyway, um, and last but never least, except in this case, Rock Band!
5097960	5101400	We will be getting stuff!
5101400	5107980	Mostly, um, actually all consisting of a Judas Priest British Steel 30th Anniversary Complete
5107980	5116480	Album Pack, which will be, um, 1200 points, or $14.99 US dollars, including on it Breaking
5116480	5117480	the Law!
5117480	5119480	Breaking the Law!
5119480	5126000	And Rapid Fire, Metal Gods, Grinder, United, Living After Midnight, Midnight, You Don't
5126000	5130520	Have to be Old to be Wise, The Rage and Stealer, but you know what's all for me?
5130520	5131520	Breaking the Law!
5131520	5132520	Breaking the Law!
5132520	5134120	Or Washing the Dog!
5134120	5135880	Washing the Dog!
5135880	5137320	Wow.
5137320	5138760	You remember that?
5138760	5139760	Yes.
5139760	5141760	And I tried very hard to forget.
5141760	5147880	That was like my favorite episode of Beavis and Butthead, you know, they put the dog in
5147880	5151280	the dryer, then they put Beavis in the dryer.
5151280	5154560	My favorite- I threw up on the dog, I threw up on you.
5154560	5157880	My favorite episode of Beavis and Butthead was with the gym teacher, today we're gonna
5157880	5160440	talk about the penis!
5160440	5162120	And then we'll talk about the vagina!
5162120	5165480	I think I played that clip on OLR a few weeks ago.
5165480	5166480	Yeah, I love it.
5166480	5167480	That was my favorite episode of Beavis and Butthead.
5167480	5168480	You should play that again soon.
5168480	5169480	You want me to play that again soon?
5169480	5170480	Play that again now.
5170480	5172480	Well, it's gonna take me a minute to find it.
5172480	5173480	Soon.
5173480	5174480	Soon.
5174480	5177240	You know what, just randomly later in the show, I'll play that clip from Beavis and
5177240	5178240	Butthead.
5178240	5179720	You won't know when, but it will happen.
5179720	5184040	It'll be during one of my stories, I'm sure.
5184040	5185160	This'll be mad.
5185160	5189640	And yeah, this game's gonna come out, and it's probably gonna suck, and today we're
5189640	5193640	talking about the penis!
5193640	5194640	What?
5194640	5198880	What do you think of my Loki impression?
5198880	5199880	I have the wah-wah-wah.
5199880	5200880	It was very good.
5200880	5201880	I think I was pretty small.
5201880	5202880	A little more anger.
5202880	5203880	A little more anger.
5203880	5212000	No, I was going for disinterested yet snarky.
5212000	5213000	That's me, alright.
5213000	5214000	Hey, Loki.
5214000	5215000	Hart.
5215000	5216000	Hart.
5216000	5217000	Hart.
5217000	5218000	Needs more Smashburger.
5218000	5219000	Twitter topics!
5219000	5220000	Yay!
5220000	5221000	Twitter.
5221000	5222000	Saving the show from being a complete trainwreck.
5222000	5223000	Hey!
5223000	5224000	Every week we take your tweets.
5224000	5227320	Show us your tweets at twitter.com slash o-l-r.
5227320	5229480	Blue Swim starts us off tonight.
5229480	5235920	O-l-r, if you could only have one CD or album to listen to forever while killing the undead
5235920	5240440	after the zombie apocalypse, what would it be?
5240440	5244880	Oh, one album left ever?
5244880	5248920	Yes, while killing the undead after the zombie apocalypse.
5248920	5252960	See for me, that changes it, because that's not asking like my Desert Island CD, but you're
5252960	5256880	asking what CD am I going to kill all the zombies to after the apocalypse.
5256880	5260200	That kind of changes my answer a little bit.
5260200	5266700	I would have to, you know, for me, because all I listen to is custom CDs anyway, I'd
5266700	5268800	actually, I'd have one of two.
5268800	5273240	Now, if I was just watching the zombies, it would definitely be the soundtrack to Shaun
5273240	5274240	of the Dead.
5274240	5279280	But, if I'm out there killing them, it would be Anthrax's Attack of the Killer Bees.
5279280	5286440	Just so I can put, bring the noise on repeat, and just wail on zombies with crowbar.
5286440	5288800	And remember, Rob, double tap.
5288800	5295760	Mine would be the soundtrack to Lost Highway, which is a completely screwed up movie that
5295760	5298360	had a great soundtrack that would be great for zombie killing.
5298360	5301200	Loki, do you have a zombie killing CD?
5301200	5305360	I don't know, um...
5305360	5308400	Bochi Kawa says I'd have to do zombie killing to Space Channel 5.
5308400	5312480	Hey, I put Mexican Flyer in Kage March 1, it's cheey, cheey.
5312480	5313480	I don't really know.
5313480	5318000	I don't have any, like, albums that would necessarily be good for zombie killing.
5318000	5319000	I guess...
5319000	5320000	I don't know.
5320000	5321000	No?
5321000	5322000	No ideas?
5322000	5323000	Alright, fine.
5323000	5327000	We can do the Top Gun soundtrack, because that would be funny.
5327000	5329600	There you go, Top Gun soundtrack, I like that idea.
5329600	5337280	I'm back to the danger zone, boom!
5337280	5341480	Take my breath away, bang!
5341480	5344760	Eat your brains away, bam!
5344760	5345760	We used to have...
5345760	5349600	I have to tell you, I have to tell you the funny story about Becky Sun, because it's
5349600	5350600	sort of related to that.
5350600	5351600	Okay, please.
5351600	5356160	Um, I was just playing with Julian and we were talking and I was like, what's in your
5356160	5357160	head?
5357160	5359880	I was like, he's like, brains!
5359880	5360880	Yeah.
5360880	5363400	I was like, what are your brains like?
5363400	5364400	Spicy!
5364400	5368600	I think I'm gonna have to go with Mae Satsuma, Rob Zombie.
5368600	5369600	Dude!
5369600	5370600	A Rob Zombie album.
5370600	5371600	Yeah.
5371600	5374800	No, no, it would have to be the old school White Zombie album from 93.
5374800	5376240	Oh god.
5376240	5377240	You know which one?
5377240	5378240	More human than human!
5378240	5379240	More human than human!
5379240	5380240	Yeah.
5380240	5381240	Seriously?
5381240	5382660	That's my White Zombie impression.
5382660	5384840	Kinda sounds like an angry St. Bernard.
5384840	5386840	More human than human!
5386840	5387840	Woof woof woof woof!
5387840	5391600	Okay, SSG100 Matt says, Blues Brothers theme for when you're driving.
5391600	5393960	And then Frisbee says, blow my parts away.
5393960	5401000	You guys are kinda weird in chat, but you know what, actually, I know actually what
5401000	5403200	music would be perfect.
5403200	5408240	Would be just absolutely perfect for Loki to be killing too.
5408240	5413360	I believe he would have to have this old soundtrack and would kill the zombies to this.
5413360	5420760	That's the sexy party song.
5420760	5430040	I would play any video game where this is the beat song.
5430040	5431920	Yaris 2, Pute Rain.
5431920	5432920	Benny Hill.
5432920	5435920	Was there ever a Benny Hill video game?
5435920	5443000	You know what, the weirdness in my brain just went from show theme to show theme to show
5443000	5445280	theme imagining killing zombies to.
5445280	5447640	And you know what I finally settled on, Rob?
5447640	5449640	The facts of life.
5449640	5456520	You take the good, you take the bad.
5456520	5461280	Could you imagine it just be skipping along with your Uzi?
5461280	5468640	Aw, I was trying to play it for you guys.
5468640	5471580	Stupid YouTube is like too quiet sometimes.
5471580	5473120	So okay, killing zombies to this.
5473120	5474120	Here we go.
5474120	5479760	Oh, this is the stupid pilot episode.
5479760	5480760	This doesn't work.
5480760	5481760	Damn it.
5481760	5483440	How hard is it to find the stupid facts of life theme song?
5483440	5484440	Christ.
5484440	5485440	There you go.
5485440	5486440	Here we go.
5486440	5501480	That was like later in the series right before it stopped being a girl school.
5501480	5507240	And they like sized down most of the cast.
5507240	5509240	Aw, Tootie.
5509240	5514240	Claire was such a bitch.
5514240	5515240	Anyway.
5515240	5523640	I bet Blue Sword had no idea his question would turn into this.
5523640	5528360	X-Link said I would use the song that Betty White sang last night on SNL.
5528360	5529720	Let's move to the next topic, Rob.
5529720	5530720	Yes, please, please.
5530720	5532440	I could listen to old theme songs all night.
5532440	5533840	One more.
5533840	5536440	Frisbee says having a wonderful time by Tiny Tim.
5536440	5537440	Alright.
5537440	5540560	And now a couple of chatters are asking, what about the Golden Girls theme?
5540560	5541560	Alright.
5541560	5544760	MissingNo64 is asking, we need to go back to Twitter topics, please.
5544760	5546840	Can we all get in the right state of mind, please?
5546840	5548320	Let me play the music.
5548320	5549320	Twitter.
5549320	5551960	Get you back on a Twitter topic, Moon.
5551960	5555440	MissingNo wants to know, did you ever put up the PAX East All Games mini show?
5555440	5558280	I thought I did, but maybe not.
5558280	5560280	I know it aired on the All Games.
5560280	5562160	Did I really never put that up?
5562160	5563160	Maybe I didn't.
5563160	5564160	Fail.
5564160	5565160	Oops.
5565160	5566160	My bad.
5566160	5567160	We'll have to take care of that.
5567160	5568160	Let me know.
5568160	5569160	I don't.
5569160	5572120	Somebody like Dark Tetsuya or Tiger Claw or somebody that knows this show or Misty would
5572120	5573440	know if I put that up or not.
5573440	5575920	So I will.
5575920	5576920	Maybe I do need to put it up.
5576920	5578920	I thought I did.
5578920	5579920	Oops.
5579920	5585360	ActDeft sends us a link to Obama chat and yes, this has to do with games because apparently
5585360	5589800	during a grad speech, he actually was kind of dissing video games a little bit.
5589800	5595000	He apparently was speaking at Hampton University in Virginia and saying, quote, you're coming
5595000	5599720	of age in a 24-7 media environment that bombards us with all kinds of content and exposes us
5599720	5604520	to all kinds of arguments, some of which don't always rank all that high on the truth meter.
5604520	5610040	With iPods and iPads and Xboxes and PlayStations, none of which I know how to work, information
5610040	5615040	becomes a distraction, a diversion, a form of entertainment rather than a tool of empowerment
5615040	5617520	rather than the means of emancipation.
5617520	5620480	All of this is not only putting new pressures on you, it's putting new pressures on our
5620480	5625320	country and on our democracy.
5625320	5626320	I don't know.
5626320	5627320	I mean.
5627320	5630040	I don't think he was specifically talking about just video games.
5630040	5631760	I don't take that as a slam.
5631760	5635560	I'll take that as a turn off the console and go play outside.
5635560	5636560	Yeah.
5636560	5639120	I, you know, and there's nothing wrong with a distraction or diversion.
5639120	5643360	I mean, even President Obama takes vacations to Hawaii, you know, so everybody needs a
5643360	5646080	diversion every now and then.
5646080	5647080	But I think he's just saying.
5647080	5650760	Listen as a person, you want to take vacations.
5650760	5652960	Imagine the stress.
5652960	5656120	And Black Wolf in chat is quick to point out that, wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, wait,
5656120	5657120	wait.
5657120	5658320	Obama has an iPod and a Blackberry.
5658320	5661600	He did give the Queen of England an iPod, did he not?
5661600	5664320	So I think one of his speech writers fucked up.
5664320	5665320	Oops.
5665320	5666320	What?
5666320	5667320	What?
5667320	5668320	What?
5668320	5669320	That's different.
5669320	5670320	That's.
5670320	5671320	I know.
5671320	5672320	And Black Wolf says he's addicted to his Blackberry.
5672320	5677160	Well, then again, wasn't it the country, the president, the Prime Minister of Finland,
5677160	5680720	I believe it was, or one of those area countries.
5680720	5687160	When the volcanic ash hit Europe, he was stuck in New York running country business from
5687160	5688820	his iPad.
5688820	5692840	So that's more of a, that's more of a necessity type of thing.
5692840	5696280	I mean, even me, I'd be lost without my iPhone now because I run my life by it.
5696280	5701480	In my big fat opinion, it's not the tool, it's how you use it.
5701480	5707160	I mean, you can use your iPad to be completely unproductive or you could be pretty productive
5707160	5708160	with it.
5708160	5709520	It really just depends on how you use it.
5709520	5715000	You can use your iPad to play stupid video games all day, or you could use it to write
5715000	5716000	a novel.
5716000	5720400	I mean, it's just however you choose to use it.
5720400	5721400	But I don't know.
5721400	5722620	I use mine for both.
5722620	5729760	It's probably more of a speech writer than it is a actual Obama quote, but whatever.
5729760	5731600	I didn't say it if he doesn't agree with it.
5731600	5734560	TigerClaw305 linked us to a multitude of stories.
5734560	5737160	I'm only going to pick a couple of these here.
5737160	5740080	But I did want to point out one of them that he linked us to were screenshots from Marvel
5740080	5741520	versus Capcom 3.
5741520	5744760	And we were actually kind of looking at these before the show and maybe he'll post the link
5744760	5746780	in chat for you guys to kind of take a peek at.
5746780	5750280	But most of them involve Wolverine and Ryu in some fashion, although there's some other
5750280	5752460	characters making a little appearance here.
5752460	5756960	Definitely has that Street Fighter IV, a little bit of hybrid with Tatsunoko versus Capcom.
5756960	5760920	What I thought was most interesting was the character bio section, which seems to confirm
5760920	5764560	some of the characters that will be in the game, including Dante, which I thought was
5764560	5771160	pretty awesome from Devil May Cry is there, Deadpool, it made Dark Soccer, Squee, of course,
5771160	5772160	Iron Man.
5772160	5774960	You got to have that because, you know, smashing box office records, or actually, no, I don't
5774960	5778640	think it smashed records this weekend, but it did very well.
5778640	5783400	Felicia Morgan and all the hot chicks from Dark Stalkers, Captain America.
5783400	5784400	Was that from again?
5784400	5785400	Felicia and Morgan?
5785400	5788240	No, no, no, uh, the, uh, scan.
5788240	5793320	Oh, I don't know, it must be some magazine that's coming out soon, I don't know, he linked
5793320	5797120	me to a website here that had it, so I'm assuming it's some magazines running these screens
5797120	5802240	soon, because if you look at some of the screenshots, you can see, like, a little, little, uh, caption
5802240	5803240	there.
5803240	5804240	That's, that's some sexy stuff right there.
5804240	5807160	Uh, looks like it'd be a pretty hot game, so looking forward to that.
5807160	5810000	I'm assuming Spider-Man's in there since the Daily Bugle.
5810000	5811000	It's gotta be.
5811000	5814080	So, big thanks to Tigerclaw for linking us to that, because we were actually peeking
5814080	5815840	at that before the show tonight.
5815840	5817040	Only a year away.
5817040	5820080	Now, I thought this story was definitely worth talking about.
5820080	5822920	I think some of his others we already touched on, but I wanted to definitely bring this
5822920	5823920	one up.
5823920	5828200	There are some, uh, rumors going around this week that Zynga is going to split from Facebook,
5828200	5831680	and this is actually something I think, I think Alan had brought up with me the other
5831680	5832680	night.
5832680	5837880	Um, actually talking about some of the, um, uh, splits that were going on with, um, Zynga,
5837880	5842560	that apparently, uh, they are making, you know, Mafia Wars, and, uh, some of these other
5842560	5846680	games, you know, uh, Farmville, of course, they are thinking about splitting from Facebook.
5846680	5849280	Actually, it might have been SEG that was talking to me about this.
5849280	5851400	I think it was SEG at dinner the other night.
5851400	5855920	Um, they are actually wanting to launch their own social gaming network, and, uh, I think
5855920	5859720	it's because there's tensions between Zynga and Facebook, because, well, Facebook just
5859720	5861780	implemented these whole token things recently.
5861780	5864800	They basically want to kind of go with the Apple methodology.
5864800	5866920	You know what, it had to be SEG, because I think he was making the comparisons to the
5866920	5867920	Apple thing.
5867920	5873320	Uh, this whole Apple methodology of, that they want such a big cut of the profits, but
5873320	5878000	maybe, um, you know, maybe they shouldn't be entitled to that.
5878000	5879000	I don't know.
5879000	5883880	So, uh, apparently, um, yep, Zynga's, uh, wanting to split off from Facebook.
5883880	5888800	However, Facebook is trying to pressure them into a long-term deal, trying to strong-arm
5888800	5889800	them.
5889800	5891440	Uh, I guess there was an all-hands meeting at Zynga.
5891440	5897000	I personally think they would be completely fucking stupid to split off from, um, Facebook,
5897000	5902080	because if they do, they're just another, like, pogo.com, iWin, or one of those other,
5902080	5904800	uh, game network websites, and I don't think they're going to stick out.
5904800	5908720	I mean, yeah, they have FarmVille, but people play FarmVille because it's a Facebook game,
5908720	5910600	and they can use all those integrations with Facebook.
5910600	5913040	I think they would just be kind of ridiculous to do that.
5913040	5914600	They'd be committing suicide.
5914600	5919080	Um, not that I'd really care if they did do that.
5919080	5923640	I'm just saying, from a business standpoint, I think it's kind of dumb.
5923640	5926720	And the Dark Tetsuya wanted to work in a quick plug for his new article, which I think is
5926720	5928240	worth, uh, plugging.
5928240	5931880	It's on our website, and they gave it a new title instead of a look back.
5931880	5934040	Remember how I said that wasn't extreme enough?
5934040	5938000	It's now called Retro Rear View.
5938000	5939000	I like that.
5939000	5940000	Ha ha ha.
5940000	5941000	I like that.
5941000	5942000	Retro Rear View.
5942000	5946720	And, uh, this week is all about, I have never fucking heard of this, the Marty, the FM Towns
5946720	5947720	Marty.
5947720	5953240	It was a Japanese computer in 1991 by Fujitsu, and, uh, Dark Tetsuya tells us a whole lot
5953240	5956000	of information about that at OrangeLawnTradio.com.
5956000	5959400	Actual content on our website, OMG.
5959400	5960400	Pretty awesome.
5960400	5962560	Thanks to all of the folks that contribute at OrangeLawnTradio.com.
5962560	5965080	Alright, that's it for Twitter Topics tonight.
5965080	5968160	Twitter.com slash O-L-R, at us, be our friend, yay.
5968160	5969160	We like friends.
5969160	5972960	Alright, let's move on to some more gaming news, and then your phone calls in a little
5972960	5973960	while.
5973960	5974960	Loki?
5974960	5979720	Uh, yes, this week there was a lot of different fan films being released out on the internet.
5979720	5983320	Um, some were good, some were kind of eh.
5983320	5988160	Um, and I actually watched all of them, so that helps.
5988160	5991280	So let's start off with, uh, Street Fighter Legacy.
5991280	5996680	It was the one they were kind of teasing last week, um, with, you know, Ken and Ryu and
5996680	5997680	pictures of it.
5997680	6003720	And it's supposed to be, you know, done with, uh, the blessing of Capcom and, uh, being
6003720	6011120	done by, uh, Owen, Trevor, and, uh, Joey Ansa, uh, with Street Lane Films.
6011120	6013680	Um, so I watched it.
6013680	6020960	The positives on it, at least Ken looks like Ken in this one, and Ryu, or Ryu, I guess,
6020960	6021960	eh.
6021960	6022960	Alright, I guess.
6022960	6027360	Um, but he looks, compared, because there were two Street Fighter, um, short films.
6027360	6034180	Both happened to be in a forest, both with, uh, Ryu and Ken, um, but props to them for
6034180	6035880	nailing the appearance of Ken.
6035880	6037960	Um, so that's pretty cool.
6037960	6039960	Ryu, not so much.
6039960	6043440	And, uh, the effects in it, eh, they're alright.
6043440	6045360	Um, the other Street Fighter film-
6045360	6046360	The fan film.
6046360	6047360	Pretty good.
6047360	6048360	Yeah.
6048360	6049360	Alright.
6049360	6050360	Better than anything I could do, that's for damn sure.
6050360	6056420	The one I liked better, though, um, was actually, uh, the Street Fighter Beginnings End.
6056420	6061360	And for me, I liked the way it was shot better, uh, and the effects were kind of cool.
6061360	6066660	But Ken looks stupid, because he looks like he just has a wig on, and it was just ridiculous.
6066660	6070400	But Ryu looked pretty cool, and, um, definitely worth checking out.
6070400	6071920	Both of those, I think, are on YouTube.
6071920	6076760	Now, the one that was actually a little bit more impressive, and a lot longer, was actually
6076760	6079120	the full-length Mega Man short film, which I-
6079120	6084000	I don't even want to even call it a short film, because it's 90 minutes long, um, it's
6084000	6087880	actually being shown on Screw Attack, and you may remember there was, like, some teasers
6087880	6090400	for it before different screenshots and stuff.
6090400	6096440	Um, having watched it, it is kind of long, and roll really gets on your nerves, because
6096440	6102200	it's, like, some Japanese chick wearing, like, this really weird, uh, blonde wig.
6102200	6103200	Um.
6103200	6105800	Yeah, I watched that last night.
6105800	6111000	And, and the CG effects are okay, but some of the characters, like Iceman and, uh, Fireman,
6111000	6114920	stuff like that, they're just dudes in, like, dirt bike gear.
6114920	6119280	And, you know, that's okay, I guess, because of budget-wise, but, I mean, when you have
6119280	6126040	full CG, like, Cutsman and Gutsman, you kind of wish that the rest were all CG as well.
6126040	6129920	And Wily was kind of weird looking.
6129920	6136360	But overall, it was kind of cool, um, might be fun to check it out, but wish there was
6136360	6139860	a little bit more polish on it, I guess.
6139860	6140860	But hell, you know.
6140860	6141860	But they're fan projects.
6141860	6144560	Exactly, it's a fan project, and, you know, good job for them.
6144560	6149560	Um, it's just, you know, some of the stuff just, you know, some of the characters were
6149560	6154520	kind of like, damn, I wish, you know, this was- because they had some of those, uh, renders
6154520	6158120	that people were doing for, like, some of the Mega Man 2 characters, and they just looked
6158120	6159120	awesome.
6159120	6163480	Um, I just kind of wish they were doing the same thing with these guys.
6163480	6166280	But, uh, hey, props to them, it was pretty cool.
6166280	6171100	All right, well, um, let's move on to another game that has something to do a little bit
6171100	6174680	with Bamani, but it's not really Bamani, it's a new music-based game that's coming out on
6174680	6175680	the Wii.
6175680	6177740	Uh, it's In The Mix, featuring Armin van Buren.
6177740	6180760	You remember this game, you know, we heard little rumblings about this a few months ago,
6180760	6182280	but then it kind of slipped off the radar.
6182280	6186480	Well, apparently, it is coming back, um, it was originally going to come out fall of 2009
6186480	6192080	against DJ Hero, but it was delayed, uh, the game is now set to come out on June 26th in
6192080	6193080	Europe.
6193080	6194080	Hey, that's my birthday.
6194080	6198160	Um, no word about a North American release yet, so I should state this is right now a,
6198160	6202280	uh, Europe-only game, which makes sense, because unfortunately, this type of music has a much
6202280	6206480	better following over there than it does here, so, I don't know, I'd be a little worried
6206480	6208320	if this thing would even come out over here.
6208320	6212040	Um, there are some new screenshots that are posted with the, uh, of the game.
6212040	6214180	Apparently, um, there's no note markers.
6214180	6218520	It seems like you do more of, like, a twist thing, where you kind of, like, maybe go through
6218520	6221400	these tunnels and maybe point at things.
6221400	6223440	You would gesture, maybe, to glow.
6223440	6225920	We really don't know what the hell this game's about.
6225920	6227520	But we do have song lists!
6227520	6228520	Woohoo!
6228520	6232440	Uh, pretty much, as you can imagine, lots and lots of Armin van Buren songs and, uh,
6232440	6234080	you know, featured tracks.
6234080	6237560	But what I did think was interesting and worth pointing out, especially for you Bimani fans,
6237560	6241280	um, you might remember there were some songs in BeatMania 2DX that were pretty popular.
6241280	6244960	The Sound of Goodbye with Perpetuous Dreamer, that is going to be in this game.
6244960	6250720	Uh, Fly Away by Vincent D'Amore, also in the game, a Cosmic Gate remix, um, they did the,
6250720	6252520	uh, Somewhere Over the Rainbow from DDR.
6252520	6256800	Uh, Flotation by Vincent D'Amore, that's one of my favorite 2DX songs they ever did.
6256800	6258000	That is going to be in this game.
6258000	6259000	So that's kind of cool.
6259000	6262920	Uh, Stringer by Riva, uh, Push is in the game.
6262920	6266820	I mean, there's just lots and lots of those, uh, trancy bands that you probably hear on
6266820	6268880	his podcast all in this game.
6268880	6271260	So, um, yeah, it looks pretty cool.
6271260	6274320	It's too bad that, um, the game might only come out in Europe, but I guess since we have
6274320	6277920	some, uh, listeners over there, I guess you get something we don't.
6277920	6282120	So, I don't want to hear all that bitching about, um, you know, that we get all the games,
6282120	6284200	because I don't know if we'll ever get that one.
6284200	6285200	We'll see though.
6285200	6288200	Anyhow, uh, Dar Sakura.
6288200	6290400	Oh, yes.
6290400	6295720	This is actually, and I, I, I was, I'm debating with myself because I want them, but I'm probably
6295720	6297120	not going to get them.
6297120	6304360	They are, um, they made little, um, River City Ransom characters, or as the original
6304360	6308480	was the hot-blooded downtown story, and they're so cute.
6308480	6316120	Um, they actually were shown at the Treasure Festo show going on in Japan, little, um,
6316120	6321520	custom kits that are, um, they have, like, the two main guys and then some of the other
6321520	6326760	guys that you can beat up to, and, um, it's just so cute.
6326760	6330720	It's put up by, uh, Tomopop.
6330720	6331720	They're adorable.
6331720	6335720	And, and, no, it's not River City Ransom, technically.
6335720	6340120	Like I said, it's hot, um, it's a hot-blooded downtown story, but it's got all kinds of
6340120	6343600	cute little guys and it's adorable.
6343600	6344600	I want.
6344600	6347600	They look cute.
6347600	6354320	Um, Team Fortress 2 The Engineer is finally getting its update thanks to a teaser trailer
6354320	6355320	that was released.
6355320	6360200	Um, no word exactly on what upgrades he's going to be getting, but there's a lot of
6360200	6366200	kind of stuff that if you read between the lines, um, some of the stuff that you see
6366200	6371560	in the background in the video that perhaps it's going to be, um, being added, including
6371560	6377520	they have, like, some sort of Iron Man type of, uh, helmet thing, um, on the workbench,
6377520	6381200	some sort of, uh, robotic arm and a blueprint.
6381200	6386880	So, no word exactly on when, um, the update's coming, but it is kind of neat, though, that
6386880	6390240	they keep adding updates to this game.
6390240	6395280	Yeah, that game's, like, three years old at this point, isn't it?
6395280	6396280	Yeah.
6396280	6397280	It's extremely old.
6397280	6398280	All right.
6398280	6402360	Well, a game that's rather new, but about something, oh, very old-fashioned for all
6402360	6405960	of us, is a game called Baby Maker Extreme.
6405960	6408800	Yes, there is a trailer out for Baby Maker Extreme.
6408800	6412160	I guess the game is actually out on, um, Xbox Live Marketplace right now.
6412160	6413160	Um, it's-
6413160	6414160	Yeah.
6414160	6415160	Community games.
6415160	6416160	80, oh, sorry, yeah, that's what I meant.
6416160	6417160	Community games.
6417160	6418160	Indie games, whatever.
6418160	6419160	80 Microsoft points for this game.
6419160	6422960	Um, and let me just kind of play the trailer for you guys and describe what's going on
6422960	6424360	in, uh, Baby Maker Extreme.
6424360	6427120	No, it's not just sex, okay?
6427120	6429160	But it is about the joy of, uh, giving birth.
6429160	6434800	In fact, you push A to experience the miracle of childbirth, and, uh, you know, you would
6434800	6438880	control your breathing in this game, just like a real mother, and use the L-T-R-T to
6438880	6442640	breathe as you go back and forth, and that's, like, to build out the power, and then it's
6442640	6448240	you get ready to push, and you hit B as fast as you can to get ready to push.
6448240	6452120	You just keep slamming on that B button.
6452120	6455200	And then, uh, what's next?
6455200	6457200	Probably screaming for drugs and then a C-section.
6457200	6460240	No, no, it gets better.
6460240	6462600	Well, they don't show you what happens next, but I believe-
6462600	6463600	Featuring avatars.
6463600	6466800	I believe you push the A button, and the baby goes flying through the air.
6466800	6472400	No, featuring avatars, but have you seen- did you watch the whole trailer?
6472400	6479040	That's right, you have your avatars get born out of this woman, and you can give them scuba
6479040	6481120	gear and shoes and a vest.
6481120	6484680	And I'm right, they go shooting, it's like one of those, uh, rocket-like launching games,
6484680	6485680	right?
6485680	6486680	Like Baby Launcher?
6486680	6488120	The baby goes flying through the air, right?
6488120	6489120	Kick the baby!
6489120	6490120	Amazing.
6490120	6491120	Don't kick the baby.
6491120	6492920	Hey, that sounds like it's worth a buck.
6492920	6493920	I know.
6493920	6494920	One whole dollar.
6494920	6495920	That's just awful.
6495920	6496920	Awfully funny.
6496920	6499960	Can I have my wife play it?
6499960	6500960	You should.
6500960	6502840	Does he- you know, how far along is she now?
6502840	6504720	She is 25 weeks.
6504720	6507880	She should be kind of practicing, you know, for the big day.
6507880	6508880	So she might want to look at that.
6508880	6509880	Alright.
6509880	6511880	I don't know if she's concerned about that at all.
6511880	6512880	Alright.
6512880	6518800	Well, we are going to get into the mailbag segment here at Orange Lounge Radio.
6518800	6522440	Um, every week you guys send us your emails.
6522440	6525520	Emailbag at Orange Lounge Radio dot com and we read some of our favorites here on the
6525520	6526520	air.
6526520	6528840	DarkSakura, what's in the emailbag this week?
6528840	6529840	Some crap.
6529840	6530840	Delete.
6530840	6534600	Um, sorry, that was just some spam.
6534600	6539960	Uh, we have, uh, a few quickies through the website, um, so some of them are not letting
6539960	6540960	us know who they are.
6540960	6542440	This one's from NerdE1.
6542440	6549320	Um, though Sky might appreciate checking out a web show called the- oh, it's- he's asking
6549320	6551560	about if you watch the Guild.
6551560	6553640	I've talked about it on this show before.
6553640	6554640	Yeah, I've seen the Guild.
6554640	6555640	The Guild is cute.
6555640	6556640	It's cute.
6556640	6557640	It is cute.
6557640	6560640	I- I don't see why they don't have, like, a real TV show like the Guild.
6560640	6566120	It got a little weird in parts, but, um, it's- it's good enough.
6566120	6567120	It's funny.
6567120	6572400	We guys also got a message from a guy, it looks like he's going by Epic Ness.
6572400	6576640	I wonder if our covers of old NES tunes might be interesting for your radio station.
6576640	6580480	We remake the music from old games and make them into rock medleys.
6580480	6584360	We have gotten quite good feedback so far, please visit our MySpace and tell me what
6584360	6585360	you think about it.
6585360	6586360	I'll go ahead and plug it.
6586360	6587360	MySpace?
6587360	6588880	MySpace dot com slash- I know, who's MySpace?
6588880	6592560	First off- Epic Ness Band, NES.
6592560	6595680	I actually listened to some of it, it wasn't that bad.
6595680	6601320	Usually when we get those spam emails, I'm kinda like, ugh, but, um, that was- you can
6601320	6605120	tell the guy at least copy pasted from some form and knew what he was doing.
6605120	6608480	And I listened to it and it wasn't bad, so, uh, plug away.
6608480	6610600	And this last one is Shook.
6610600	6612120	Hi, OLR.
6612120	6613120	Hi.
6613120	6616000	Sorry I haven't sent an email in a while because my internet's not working.
6616000	6619080	Anyway, I was listening to an episode from a few weeks ago and noticed you guys talking
6619080	6621320	about your youngest listener.
6621320	6625880	I don't know if there's anyone else my age that listens, but I'm 13, I've been listening
6625880	6626880	since I was 12.
6626880	6627880	Oh my god.
6627880	6628880	On to the email.
6628880	6633640	Is it just me or does it seem like last year's E3 seemed more exciting than this one?
6633640	6636640	I don't feel excited at all even though I know I should be.
6636640	6637640	Yours truly, Shook.
6637640	6640120	By the way, very excellent grammar.
6640120	6641120	I know.
6641120	6642120	Except for a few missing commas.
6642120	6646920	I think this year the only difference between last year and this year would be that this
6646920	6648880	year we don't really know what's coming.
6648880	6653400	I mean, we have an idea with some of the stuff that they've talked about already, but I think
6653400	6657400	that this year they're keeping a lot of it kinda tight to the chest so that, you know,
6657400	6660760	there's gonna be a lot more surprises, whereas last year's kinda like, yeah, we kinda know
6660760	6664600	what you're gonna talk about and, you know, there's some things, but, I don't know, personally,
6664600	6669600	I'm okay with not going to E3 this year because last year was just kinda, eh, this isn't what
6669600	6670720	it used to be.
6670720	6672000	I disagree.
6672000	6678320	I think our emailer couldn't be more wronger, to use a term that our soccer will appreciate.
6678320	6682920	I think that between actually getting to do some hands-on with Natal to see what it's
6682920	6688120	really like besides just a concept, getting to get hands-on with Move, Final Fantasy XIV,
6688120	6693000	Rock Band 3, Portal 2, I think there's a lot of big releases this year that are kind of
6693000	6696920	exciting, whereas last year there wasn't, I mean, one of the bigger things there was
6696920	6700800	Halo 3 ODST, which wasn't a game I was really that excited about.
6700800	6706020	Also, one thing I haven't played is the Halo Reach beta, really at all, which I guess came
6706020	6707560	out this week.
6707560	6715080	I kinda don't play Halo anymore, thanks to Halo 3 wasn't that great, so, alright, so,
6715080	6718480	oh, thank you for that, Dark Soccer, I appreciate that.
6718480	6720720	Dark Soccer's taking my picture over here while I'm trying to talk.
6720720	6723480	I was poking your head with a 50 caliber bullet shell.
6723480	6724480	Nice, thank you.
6724480	6728600	No, I was gonna say, by the way, our youngest documented listener that I know of has actually
6728600	6729600	just turned 3.
6729600	6732960	He doesn't really pay attention to us, he just listens sometimes.
6732960	6736560	BlackWolf in our chat room wants to point out, it's also still a month away, an E3 booth
6736560	6738880	list come out about a week or two before.
6738880	6742440	Who knows, Blizzard could be back this year, we don't know yet, of course Nintendo's got
6742440	6749080	the 3DS, I'm a little antsy about the 3DS, cause I don't know about how 3D's gonna go,
6749080	6752680	but again, I'm not gonna knock it till I've tried it, I'm just a little nervous, that's
6752680	6753680	all.
6753680	6756400	Alright, so was that it for the emails?
6756400	6757400	Um, no.
6757400	6758400	No, alright.
6758400	6761840	But I did put that picture up on the website.
6761840	6765320	Grand, thank you.
6765320	6767120	This is from Robabubba.
6767120	6772040	I love the way Game Politics presents the story of Dave and Buster's new owners.
6772040	6773680	There's a link there.
6773680	6777480	PS, one of them opened up in Roseville this week.
6777480	6779800	Really, I drove by and I did not see it.
6779800	6780800	But then I didn't drive that close.
6780800	6782160	It's in the fountains, you gotta go, you know what?
6782160	6783160	I knew it was over there.
6783160	6784520	It's in the fountains, over by, um.
6784520	6785680	I know what you're talking about.
6785680	6786680	Yeah, it's in the back.
6786680	6788680	It's by like California Peach Kitchen and all that stuff in the back.
6788680	6792200	I was looking too, cause we were over at the Galleria this week and I was like, I wonder
6792200	6795000	if it's over there, and I'm like, the fountains, where's this?
6795000	6798160	Cause that's how long it's been since I've been over there, the fountains didn't exist
6798160	6799640	when I went last.
6799640	6803520	It's nice, it's a little bit too high class for me, but there's some nice stuff there.
6803520	6805080	But uh, did you go to Dave and Buster's though?
6805080	6808400	No, not yet, maybe we'll have to plan that this week, we should plan an OLR night at
6808400	6809400	Dave and Buster's.
6809400	6810400	We need to go there.
6810400	6811400	Fun!
6811400	6812400	That's awesome.
6812400	6813400	Yay!
6813400	6818160	Um, and, okay, so in the middle of the GP article it says, in a press release on its
6818160	6823160	site, Oak Hill called the deal, um, an investment in partnership with Dave and Buster's current
6823160	6824160	management team.
6824160	6825160	Joke.
6825160	6828240	They soon followed with an email, by the way, you're defired.
6828240	6829240	All in lead.
6829240	6830240	End joke.
6830240	6834800	I believe this marks the beginning of a round of closing of some DMV sites because that's
6834800	6837120	what the new company always does, isn't it?
6837120	6842300	It's an Arcadiapocalypse, the Arcadiapocalypse is nigh, Ra-ba-ba.
6842300	6845160	It's kind of funny because they just opened the one here and now they're already talking
6845160	6847080	about closing certain Dave and Buster's.
6847080	6851520	I like that he signs his name now, Ra-ba-ba.
6851520	6852520	That's how you say it.
6852520	6855840	It is, if you think about it, it's surprising though that it is in such close proximity
6855840	6863000	to, um, the Family Funds Center, you know, Golf Land, um, hopefully it makes them...
6863000	6865160	And John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza is right around the corner.
6865160	6868920	Well, their arcade's kind of crap, um, but I would say...
6868920	6870680	They do have an afterburner climax.
6870680	6872840	Well, good for them, but I'm just saying...
6872840	6874240	And an indoor rollercoaster.
6874240	6875880	They do?
6875880	6878720	Yeah, it's for like little kids, but yeah.
6878720	6881360	I thought that doesn't really count.
6881360	6886240	Um, so, it's interesting to see, because, you know, Dave and Buster's has a pretty decent
6886240	6888800	arcade, granted there's a lot of ticket games.
6888800	6892440	I'm glad though I'll be able to use my two power cards that I have from like five years
6892440	6893440	ago.
6893440	6897360	Which is, uh, very exciting.
6897360	6899080	Those things don't expire, do they?
6899080	6901880	I don't think so, but you might have to get it transferred.
6901880	6902880	Alright.
6902880	6903880	Darsakha's...
6903880	6906920	Sorry, Darsakha's taking pictures over here, and she keeps pointing the camera at me, and
6906920	6907920	I don't know why.
6907920	6910360	Because I know you'll play along.
6910360	6911360	Alright.
6911360	6912360	Uh, yeah, I...
6912360	6913360	I just...
6913360	6914360	I can't be here than Loki.
6914360	6918000	I just, um, I'm putting up a picture of me poking Rob with the nose condom.
6918000	6919000	Thank you.
6919000	6920500	The nose tampon, sorry.
6920500	6921500	The nose pond.
6921500	6923040	Uh, any other emails tonight?
6923040	6924040	Or are we...
6924040	6925040	No!
6925040	6926040	We're done.
6926040	6929640	We do have actually one last little email I do want to get to, and it's right here.
6929640	6932800	So, Beavis and Butthead.
6932800	6936400	I understand Mr. McVicker has made a little arrangement with you guys.
6936400	6938120	Yeah, a little probation.
6938120	6945320	You see, class, Beavis and Butthead here are not allowed to laugh for a whole week.
6945320	6949240	That's right, and if they do laugh, they'll be expelled, and they'll have to go to Hope
6949240	6954320	High School, where they'll get their asses kicked on a daily basis by all the other delinquents.
6954320	6962040	Well, I was real glad to hear that, because this is Sex Education Week.
6962040	6964960	That's right, Sex Ed Week.
6964960	6967900	We're gonna be talking about the penis.
6967900	6970440	We'll be talking about the vagina.
6970440	6972520	Do you think that's funny, Butthead?
6972520	6976200	Do you find it amusing that we'll be talking about the testicles?
6976200	6984800	Yes, we're also gonna be talking about venereal disease, sexual intercourse, and we will definitely
6984800	6988640	be spending a lot of time talking about masturbation!
6988640	6997120	Well, now that that's out of the way, let's take roll.
6997120	6998120	Butt kiss!
6998120	6999120	Here.
6999120	7000120	Gaylord!
7000120	7001120	Ivan!
7001120	7009440	Oh, we're so mature.
7009440	7013600	I had to realize, especially after getting that email from the 13-year-old that listens
7013600	7017640	to the show, a lot of you didn't grow up with Beavis and Butthead, and that kind of makes
7017640	7022400	me sad for you, because Beavis and Butthead was pretty fucking amazing.
7022400	7025320	Like it really was.
7025320	7026960	It really summed up a generation.
7026960	7027960	It really did.
7027960	7032600	Like if you want to know what life was like for us, just go watch an old episode of Beavis
7032600	7033600	and Butthead.
7033600	7034600	It's pretty summed up.
7034600	7038800	Like back when MTV would actually play music videos and everything else.
7038800	7039800	Good stuff.
7039800	7043680	Alright, let's get into a little bit of angst, because you know, sometimes we get a little
7043680	7046220	angry here on Orange Lounge Radio, and we have to do this segment.
7046220	7048560	It's just tradition for 366 weeks now.
7048560	7065880	The FUs of the Week!
7065880	7069960	Um, FU to the sudden fifth coughing that I have, and also for my finger for starting
7069960	7074680	to trigger again, even though I had it operated on last year.
7074680	7081800	FU to the people that drift in and out of lanes, especially people that try to hit me
7081800	7082800	with their car.
7082800	7087040	Also, those people that like to make, you know, left turns by kind of slightly going
7087040	7091400	to the right portion of their lane or outside of their lane and then making a left turn.
7091400	7094280	Same goes for people that make the right turns that way as well.
7094280	7099920	And to this old grandma that we saw today who decided that, you know, the cement in
7099920	7106160	a parking space is okay to drive over, and it was hilarious to watch that as she figured
7106160	7110520	out, hey, my car's on the wrong side of the cement barrier.
7110520	7111520	Hey!
7111520	7112520	Oops.
7112520	7113520	Is that it?
7113520	7114520	That's it.
7114520	7115520	Alright.
7115520	7125800	Um, I wanted to say a quick FU to my teeth, because I went to a Mamma Mia sing-a-long
7125800	7128480	this week, and don't judge me.
7128480	7130040	It was a lot of fun.
7130040	7131040	Shut up.
7131040	7132040	It was great.
7132040	7133040	They did it all Rocky or Preacher Show style.
7133040	7135720	But one of the things they did is that one of the songs is Honey Honey, and they actually
7135720	7143280	had Bitto Honey available as part of Honey Honey, and I actually ate the Bitto Honey
7143280	7148820	during Honey Honey, and part of my tooth chipped off on the bit of honey, one of my back teeth.
7148820	7152360	But I had like tons of cavities when I was a kid, and I think like a lot of the fillings
7152360	7156880	now that I'm like 30 are cracking out, and I think that's exactly what happened.
7156880	7159760	I think the filling broke off and took the corner of my tooth with it.
7159760	7163760	So I'm really hoping it doesn't start to hurt, because something else about me, I really
7163760	7164760	hate going to the dentist.
7164760	7168000	Like, I really, really hate going to the dentist.
7168000	7170240	You know it'll help though if it does start to hurt, Rocky.
7170240	7171240	Just a natural remedy.
7171240	7172240	Chin!
7172240	7176480	Well, I'm just, you know, I can't let it, like if it starts to hurt, I'm gonna have
7176480	7177480	to do something about it.
7177480	7180560	You can't let it go, because it will never like stop hurting.
7180560	7184080	So um, yeah, FU to my teeth.
7184080	7185080	Boo.
7185080	7187560	FU to fillings we got as kids too.
7187560	7189560	I never had a filling as a kid.
7189560	7190560	Well, lucky you.
7190560	7193440	Then again, I didn't go to the dentist until I was an adult from the time I was in third
7193440	7194440	grade.
7194440	7195440	Wow.
7195440	7196440	Lucky you.
7196440	7198960	Alright, so that's it for the FUs of the Week.
7198960	7205440	Let's get into some other stories, and then we'll get into the Skype line at 1-877-GAMO-LR.
7205440	7211000	There's a new Bomani game that apparently came out back in February, and in Japan of
7211000	7213760	course, because it's not over here.
7213760	7216080	And unfortunately, didn't really know much about it.
7216080	7220500	But it's a new game called Utachi, and it looks like popping music, but kind of like
7220500	7225000	almost like a light version of popping music with only three buttons, because you use the,
7225000	7232560	you play it in kind of like the book, book fashion, and you tap the touch screen.
7232560	7236480	There's three different spots you tap or hold your stylus on.
7236480	7238240	And it's kind of cool.
7238240	7245280	Apparently it says the game requires you to perform a certain action when the notes reach
7245280	7250400	the bottom of the screen, you tap the buttons for red notes, tap and hold them for blue,
7250400	7254960	and tap and tap and quickly slide for yellow.
7254960	7261080	The green notes sound a bit tricky, you have to tap once and hit its, tap once it hits
7261080	7266120	the bottom, and then slide the stylus up and down until the note ends.
7266120	7270080	So it's like a new rhythm music game, and the characters definitely look like they're
7270080	7272300	from popping music.
7272300	7274880	It's no beat and groovy though.
7274880	7281120	Yeah, it looks like it'll be better than beat and groovy, but I don't know.
7281120	7284120	And I'm just not excited about these games anymore.
7284120	7285920	Oh, I agree.
7285920	7288320	You know what's sad though?
7288320	7294580	I think I showed you there was like a homebrew DS game that really kind of gave me an idea
7294580	7299000	of how they could do like a DDR type of game on the DS, and it was pretty awesome.
7299000	7306240	It involved like kind of making gestures with the stylus, and just really cool the way it
7306240	7307520	kind of worked.
7307520	7312600	But it was with like a Para Para type of video or something that they did it with.
7312600	7317040	Still would be really cool though, to implement.
7317040	7322000	All right, well, one more story for you guys tonight, and I don't think this guy will be
7322000	7324040	making a Para Para game, but you never know.
7324040	7327200	George Romero, you guys know who he is, right?
7327200	7331840	He did zombie movies, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, all these awesome
7331840	7333200	zombie movies.
7333200	7338300	Actually, George Romero recently talked to the website Destructoid and said, I'd like
7338300	7339500	to do a game.
7339500	7343920	I'd like to work with a gamer on it, but everyone who has ever approached me, it's always been
7343920	7345720	sell us your name and go home.
7345720	7348360	I don't particularly want to do that.
7348360	7352360	So yeah, and then of course there's the whole dead rising thing, which was definitely influenced.
7352360	7355600	I think one of the companies he said he wanted to work with was Capcom, like, they already
7355600	7357720	did it.
7357720	7361600	So he actually said, he admitted, I'm not a gamer, so I don't know what excites a gamer.
7361600	7362600	I don't know.
7362600	7364400	I think I could come up with a good story.
7364400	7365400	Zombies!
7365400	7366400	People like zombies!
7366400	7368400	That's right.
7368400	7373280	I'm sure you're not very familiar with the zombie phenomenon, but I'm sure if you do
7373280	7377220	your research there, George Romero, that you'll be fine.
7377220	7380560	As long as he makes the right arrangement with the right game company, it'll be fine.
7380560	7384280	As long as he doesn't, you know, partner up with, you know, the wrong game company, it'll
7384280	7385280	be great.
7385280	7389880	All right, so that's it for our scripted stories tonight.
7389880	7394720	Let's go to the phones at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is ORANGE LOUNGE
7394720	7395720	RADIO.
7395720	7397080	We're going to take your calls.
7397080	7399880	The last few weeks have been a little dry, so I don't know what's going on, but we'll
7399880	7401920	see if we actually get some phone calls tonight.
7401920	7407360	In the meantime, let's see if there's anyone that has last minute stories.
7407360	7412960	Yeah, the small stuff.
7412960	7416560	They're doing another Xbox 360 bundle instead of the elites with two free games.
7416560	7420380	They're also going to have an Xbox 360 arcade system with two free games.
7420380	7425520	Those free games, of course, are Banjo-Kazooie and Viva Pinata, the first Viva Pinata game.
7425520	7428840	But hey, two free games is better than none.
7428840	7429840	Free games are free.
7429840	7431400	All right, let's go to the phones.
7431400	7432400	We have a call.
7432400	7433400	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7433400	7434400	Who's this?
7434400	7437960	It's a one-and-only run, how's everybody doing tonight?
7437960	7438960	Not bad.
7438960	7439960	How are you?
7439960	7440960	I'm pretty good.
7440960	7444760	I just came back from a job interview, but that's not the reason why I called.
7444760	7445760	Well, good luck with that.
7445760	7446760	Hope it works out.
7446760	7448320	What is the reason you called tonight?
7448320	7454760	Well, before I get into it, to reiterate what was said in the chat room earlier, I'm surprised
7454760	7461960	you wouldn't go around Zombie Killing to the theme of the Golden Girls extended remix.
7461960	7466380	You know, I have to think, if push came to shove, the thing is about the Golden Girls,
7466380	7470240	there was really only that one song, and that's not enough to really fill up a whole CD.
7470240	7473400	But maybe if we could somehow get that song on the soundtrack to Lost Highway, then we'd
7473400	7475080	be good.
7475080	7478520	Or maybe audio clips from the show?
7478520	7480600	I don't know if I'd want to hear that.
7480600	7482720	Does that make sense?
7482720	7485160	You know we're just busting your balls because we love you, right?
7485160	7486240	No, I know, I know.
7486240	7488240	You guys are weird.
7488240	7490720	All right, no.
7490720	7496240	You know, I guess I could always fill up the CD with other types of versions of the Golden
7496240	7502280	Girls theme song, like that 8-bit version we had earlier, but you know.
7502280	7503480	That'll work.
7503480	7507200	Or the one that was on the Betty White thing last night.
7507200	7508200	Good times.
7508200	7511600	All right, so what's the real reason you called in tonight?
7511600	7516320	I actually sat down and watched the Mega Man fan film on Friday night.
7516320	7519920	Not, yeah, Friday night.
7519920	7520920	I liked it.
7520920	7526600	I was expecting something really half-assed rushed project, but it turned out to be much
7526600	7528380	better than I thought it would be.
7528380	7535440	Without spoiling it too bad, what in a nutshell happens in this movie?
7535440	7542000	It's sort of like a retelling of the first game with Elements of the Third.
7542000	7543240	Interesting.
7543240	7546440	Elements of the Third, meaning like rushes in it?
7546440	7547440	No.
7547440	7552400	I guess you could say Rock's big brother.
7552400	7553400	Okay.
7553400	7554960	Okay, I gotcha.
7554960	7555960	Interesting.
7555960	7559480	I'm surprised Capcom isn't trying to shut this shit down.
7559480	7564360	Did Capcom kind of endorse this, or are they just hoping?
7564360	7568000	I actually have no idea, but I don't think they would shut it down, because I don't know
7568000	7573360	if you remember a few years back at, I think it was Dragon Con or some convention in the
7573360	7574360	South.
7574360	7579280	It might have been SEC, I don't know, but reps from Capcom was there to watch a, I think
7579280	7583280	it was a Devil May Cry fan film or something like that.
7583280	7586080	Oh, so this has kind of been done before.
7586080	7589480	And I guess the other movies talked about tonight, you know, Street Fighter movie, Capcom
7589480	7595880	is apparently just these grounds for making fan movies.
7595880	7596880	I saw Legacy.
7596880	7601320	I thought that was great, but I didn't see the other one though.
7601320	7604480	Well I guess maybe I'll have to check out the movie too.
7604480	7605480	I don't know.
7605480	7609680	I'm not a big fan of that particular website that made it, but I guess I can try and just
7609680	7610680	sit down and watch it.
7610680	7611680	They didn't make it.
7611680	7612680	They're hosting it.
7612680	7613680	Oh, okay.
7613680	7614680	Yeah, they're hosting it.
7614680	7615920	Well then that's different.
7615920	7620960	And their official soundtrack to the fan film is also available.
7620960	7624360	Is the soundtrack not clips from the game, or is it arranged stuff from the game, or
7624360	7626560	is it all original stuff?
7626560	7627560	All original.
7627560	7632800	I guess one guy did original recordings for the whole movie, but there's a couple of tracks
7632800	7638640	he did do remixes of, but it's more, but it's like dark themed.
7638640	7643000	Sort of like, it kind of reminds me of the music from Lord of the Rings in a way.
7643000	7644000	Interesting.
7644000	7645000	Like Enya?
7645000	7647000	Something like that.
7647000	7649920	The fan film itself isn't like comedy chop-socky.
7649920	7654840	It's more like drama, it's more of a drama darkish theme.
7654840	7660560	Plus the fact that Desient, Wily, and Light are much younger than they're supposed to
7660560	7662040	be.
7662040	7667240	Tigerclaw in chat says, Capcom did endorse the Street Fighter legacy, chat.orangelandtrader.com.
7667240	7668240	So yeah.
7668240	7669480	See, that I didn't know about.
7669480	7671600	Capcom's pretty good with their fan base, though.
7671600	7677480	They got a blog that reaches out to fans, and they try not to be jerks about stuff.
7677480	7680960	But at the same time, when Nintendo pulled that Zelda film, I didn't really think they
7680960	7681960	were being jerks.
7681960	7684180	I mean, they have a right to protect their IP.
7684180	7687680	So if Capcom wanted to be jerks, they have a right.
7687680	7688680	You know what?
7688680	7694360	If Nintendo's going to pull that fan film, at least let us know about the supposed Metroid
7694360	7695720	film that's supposed to be coming out.
7695720	7697360	We've been hearing about it for the last two, three years.
7697360	7698360	Oh yeah.
7698360	7699360	Good luck with that.
7699360	7700360	No, ain't happening.
7700360	7701360	Ain't happening.
7701360	7702360	Yeah, I know.
7702360	7705600	Which is too bad, because if it did happen, maybe they'd sell more copies of the game.
7705600	7706600	Mm-hmm.
7706600	7707600	Alright.
7707600	7711720	And SJ100Matt wants to point out that the Megas did the closing music.
7711720	7715320	So there is at least still some other Mega Man community tie-ins, so.
7715320	7716320	Oh yeah, definitely.
7716320	7718040	Alright, well, Rama, we're going to let you go.
7718040	7721320	Do you have any other final thoughts before we let you go?
7721320	7723780	If you like Street Fighter stuff, check out Street Fighter High.
7723780	7724780	That's all I gotta say.
7724780	7725780	Alright, will do.
7725780	7727680	Dan was watching that the other day.
7727680	7728680	It's amusing.
7728680	7729680	Yes, it is.
7729680	7731200	Alright, we'll see you soon, Rama.
7731200	7733080	You still coming out here, like in July?
7733080	7736760	Um, we gotta talk about that, yeah.
7736760	7737760	Mm, okay.
7737760	7738760	Sounds good.
7738760	7739760	Alright, alright.
7739760	7740760	Take care.
7740760	7741760	Mm-hmm.
7741760	7742760	Alright.
7742760	7747400	877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, is OrangeLoungeRadio.
7747400	7751320	While we wait for other calls, do we have any other last minute stories that came up?
7751320	7753080	Not particularly, I don't think.
7753080	7755240	Bejeweled 2 coming in the WiiWare.
7755240	7756240	Woo!
7756240	7757240	Yay for that.
7757240	7758240	Alright, we got another call.
7758240	7759240	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
7759240	7760240	Who's this?
7760240	7763440	Uh, one and only Legend of Zaku.
7763440	7764440	Legend of Zaku.
7764440	7765440	What's up?
7765440	7766440	What's on your mind?
7766440	7767440	Uh, nothing much.
7767440	7770120	Just recovering from, like, Mother's Day gorging of food.
7770120	7771120	I see.
7771120	7774000	Well, at least it's not a Mother's Day hangover, because, you know, I've definitely had those
7774000	7775800	types of Mother's Days, too.
7775800	7778920	Uh, so, uh, what, uh, what's on your mind?
7778920	7780800	To what do we owe the phone call?
7780800	7787240	Um, I guess the way I've been seeing it right now, is it just me or is Activision trying
7787240	7791640	to defend, just, just in general, ass rape?
7791640	7796040	In other words, when they try to sell the stimulus pack for Modern Warfare 2, their
7796040	7799600	exec has the gall to say it's the best deal.
7799600	7804400	It's the best value for your, for the amount you're paying.
7804400	7808640	Which we all know, and let's be honest here, it's a crock of shit.
7808640	7812920	I think Activision, in general, is kinda having to band-aid a lot lately, like, you know,
7812920	7816840	we had the news about the silver lining this week, you know, and certainly they've been
7816840	7819880	getting a lot of bad news back to back to back.
7819880	7822440	But then, you know, of course they also had some good news with the whole Bungie deal
7822440	7826040	for the next, you know, ten years, the publishing of that, whatever series that is, it'll probably
7826040	7830120	be at E3, which by the way, going back to the earlier email, another reason that E3
7830120	7834080	is going to be interesting this year, um, you know, I think they definitely have some,
7834080	7837800	some damage control to be doing, so of course you're going to see comments like that.
7837800	7843200	The problem with, you know, like, the way I see it is that, you know, they have to,
7843200	7847240	they can't just do what they did to Infinity Ward with Bungie, but then again,
7847240	7849760	Hold, hold, hold, I'm going to stop you right there.
7849760	7850760	They don't own Bungie.
7850760	7856840	It's a big difference, but you'd be surprised at how, you know, the actual details of the
7856840	7864400	deal itself, like, you know, the, you know, the details that are pretty much confidential.
7864400	7870680	I mean, in other words, what I'm trying to say is that the point is that perhaps Activision
7870680	7877120	is going to be inclined to pull their strings as much as possible, not to actually own them,
7877120	7883320	not to make their life that miserable, in terms of just, like, being demanding and overworking
7883320	7886400	them if they were signed up for that type of deal.
7886400	7890480	I have a feeling this agreement is probably going to favor Bungie a little more, because
7890480	7892480	Activision is not directly paying for it.
7892480	7897280	As long as they actually negotiated with, you know, as long as Bungie managed to negotiate
7897280	7901800	that contract, you know, with terms that they would agree with.
7901800	7906120	I'm sure, you know what, I'm sure Bungie got the better end of the deal, because once the
7906120	7910400	Microsoft news came down, I'm sure everybody was banging down Bungie's door, and I will,
7910400	7915400	I would bet money, I would bet actual money EA was in talks with them, too.
7915400	7916400	I would bet money.
7916400	7920320	I'm pretty sure they were, but I'm just, you know, as I'm saying, I just want to be sure
7920320	7925760	that we just have to keep in mind that as long as Bungie doesn't get screwed over by
7925760	7931080	Activision in terms of, like, you know, in terms of actually having to deliver on very
7931080	7937000	tight deadlines, the way Infinity Ward was, was put, you know, that much undue pressure.
7937000	7940160	Remember though, Zach O'Bungee has survived a divorce with Microsoft.
7940160	7941160	That's pretty big.
7941160	7945080	I understand that, but there's this activation we're talking about.
7945080	7946080	Yeah, well, I'm-
7946080	7950520	These guys have, you know, these guys have publicly stated that they, that they're helping
7950520	7954560	on just, like, maximizing profit.
7954560	7958320	Let me, let me take this kind of a different direction a little bit here, because, you
7958320	7961400	know, we could kind of, you know, talk about this without really knowing the details of
7961400	7966400	it for a very long time, but come E3, hold on, come E3, we're actually going to see what
7966400	7969560	this game is, and, you know, what the big mystery project is.
7969560	7972800	At least that's the assumption, and, and, God, I hope it is the case.
7972800	7974720	We'll actually get to see what this mystery game is.
7974720	7976160	The curtain will be revealed.
7976160	7980280	Do you think people are going to remember all this once the game can speak for itself
7980280	7981880	as opposed to being just an idea?
7981880	7982880	Right.
7982880	7988400	I mean, in the end, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter that Activision and Bungie
7988400	7992000	are, are basically, you know, are in a 10-year deal.
7992000	7995800	The important thing is that the game will be the face of everything.
7995800	8001200	It'll be the face, and that will be the front, the things that, you know, that your average
8001200	8006140	Joe gamer will see, you know, when, when talking about that particular game.
8006140	8009560	He would see whatever character is tied to that game and nothing else.
8009560	8014480	I bet most people don't really follow this stuff either.
8014480	8018740	Like how many people go, oh, I've got to go see this movie because 20th Century Fox is
8018740	8019740	doing it.
8019740	8023120	And like, you know, 20th Century Fox, I just love that little theme they play before all
8023120	8024120	the movies.
8024120	8025120	Right.
8025120	8028560	You know, most people don't really give a hoot at the end of the day.
8028560	8029560	Exactly.
8029560	8030560	So.
8030560	8031560	Exactly.
8031560	8036000	This is where the franchises sell themselves to the point where the people made them, you
8036000	8037000	know, it doesn't matter.
8037000	8038000	It's irrelevant to them.
8038000	8040120	It's the same thing with Call of Duty right now.
8040120	8041120	But I should say this.
8041120	8045320	They don't care that Treyarch or Infinity Ward made it, it's just another Call of Duty
8045320	8048000	game to appease Joe gamer.
8048000	8049120	I should say this though.
8049120	8055000	There are definitely people that will follow, if I'm going to continue this analogy, follow
8055000	8056640	their favorite directors.
8056640	8060320	Like you know, oh, Kevin Smith has a new film out there, I've got to go see that.
8060320	8061320	Those are niches.
8061320	8062320	You have to realize.
8062320	8069240	You have one aspect of really, you know, devoted fan base for that one particular person, but
8069240	8074800	then you have another one that's just so passive that takes, you know, every, it doesn't really
8074800	8076860	take that into account.
8076860	8080280	So it's just, to them it's just another movie that they're seeing.
8080280	8085080	And in this case, it's just another first person shooter that this, you know, average
8085080	8086480	Joe gamer is playing.
8086480	8087480	Alright.
8087480	8090680	Well, Zaku, we've got to wrap up so we can get some more calls, but thank you so much
8090680	8095760	for your call and I'm sure we'll check in with you again after E3 when the curtain is
8095760	8096760	revealed.
8096760	8097760	Right.
8097760	8098760	Alright.
8098760	8099760	Take care, Zaku.
8099760	8101760	Alright, have a good one.
8101760	8106560	877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.
8106560	8110280	I did see some other calls coming through, so it looks like our audience wants to chat
8110280	8111280	tonight.
8111280	8112280	That's good.
8112280	8113800	Good change in the past couple weeks.
8113800	8115800	Loki, any other last minute stories?
8115800	8119800	I don't know if I cut you off on what you were doing there.
8119800	8128760	Just a few things, um, apparently Square Enix is trying to prohibit people from making pictures
8128760	8132640	and videos of their games, I guess, before they come out or something, I don't really
8132640	8133640	know.
8133640	8134640	I didn't realize that was a big problem.
8134640	8139160	But I know they've been really kind of anal about people taking pictures and stuff during
8139160	8140160	like E3.
8140160	8141600	Oh yeah, they do that all the time.
8141600	8143640	Let's get, the phone's ringing off the hook, I gotta get one of these calls.
8143640	8145040	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
8145040	8146400	Hey, this is X-Link.
8146400	8147400	Hello, X-Link.
8147400	8148400	What's on your mind, buddy?
8148400	8154960	Hey, I was reading over some news and I was glad to see that Sega had detailed the DRM
8154960	8159480	for Alpha Protocol and that I don't have to have an internet connection 24-7 in order
8159480	8160960	to play it when I do play it.
8160960	8163720	Well that's because it's Sega, not Ubisoft, but that's good.
8163720	8167560	Thank God, thank somebody for being DRM-friendly about it, so.
8167560	8170760	And then the fact that after about two years after the game comes out that they're gonna
8170760	8175760	put a patch where it's, you know, there'll be no other requirements, so.
8175760	8182440	But it's good to know that somebody's at least looking at the consumer and saying, we don't
8182440	8185880	want to go down these same footsteps as some of these other companies have been.
8185880	8191400	So it's good to see that somebody's at least trying to appease the PC customer.
8191400	8192400	Hmm.
8192400	8193400	Well that's good.
8193400	8198000	And I don't usually think of Sega as a big PC publisher, but I guess, you know, they
8198000	8200680	certainly have some of their stuff there, so.
8200680	8201680	That's pretty cool.
8201680	8206480	But even so, I'm glad somebody's taking the right steps towards it, so.
8206480	8209600	What else is on your mind this week, buddy?
8209600	8210600	Nothing much.
8210600	8214640	Just, I was working on my finals and stuff and of course playing WoW just like you, so.
8214640	8215640	How is Warcraft going?
8215640	8217960	Have you been reading the Cataclysm spoilers at all?
8217960	8219760	No, I have not, actually.
8219760	8221580	Well, it's kind of hard not to.
8221580	8222580	I take that back.
8222580	8226640	It's kind of hard not to read anything with it, but at the same time, too, I try not to
8226640	8231640	read too much because I like the whole aspect of surprise and see what's gonna happen.
8231640	8235440	And, it's like I was telling other people in the guild and stuff, I'm looking forward
8235440	8240900	to seeing how these events actually unfold and how the event's gonna play out.
8240900	8244680	And hopefully they might have some kind of timely, worldly events where this all is gonna
8244680	8247560	come and unfold at one step at a time.
8247560	8248960	So it'd be kind of neat to see how it happens, so.
8248960	8253040	Yeah, they did some fun events when Lich King came out, so I'm sure they'll do some fun
8253040	8254040	stuff here, too.
8254040	8255040	So that'll be cool.
8255040	8256040	But.
8256040	8257040	Yes.
8257040	8258040	Oh, gosh.
8258040	8259040	There's something else I was gonna ask you.
8259040	8261760	You're trying to still do your Loremaster achievement, right?
8261760	8263000	You may not have a lot of time left.
8263000	8264000	Correct.
8264000	8265000	You gotta get cracking on that.
8265000	8266000	Correct.
8266000	8267000	Well, yes, definitely.
8267000	8268280	And I will definitely be doing that.
8268280	8271560	I just, like, a lot of my schoolwork had come up, unfortunately, where it had stopped me
8271560	8274360	and slowed down my process, which, of course, you guys can tell.
8274360	8277880	But then again, I started speeding up again as well, so.
8277880	8280920	Yeah, you finally decided, hey, maybe I should actually go to the new content.
8280920	8282240	I'll level a lot faster.
8282240	8285380	And then when you hit 80, it makes the old content super easy because you can start running
8285380	8286380	Dungeons by yourself.
8286380	8287380	It's great.
8287380	8288380	Yeah, precisely.
8288380	8292480	And I have a few surprises in store this next coming week, too, for some of us, so.
8292480	8295240	But I will talk about that later, so.
8295240	8296280	Alright.
8296280	8299520	But I got kind of a few interesting things, which was kind of cool, so.
8299520	8300520	Alright.
8300520	8302300	Well, we're gonna let you go, buddy, so we can get some more calls.
8302300	8304560	But I'll see you in a while, I'm sure.
8304560	8305560	No problem.
8305560	8306560	Thank you.
8306560	8307560	Huh?
8307560	8308560	Later.
8308560	8309560	Bye-bye.
8309560	8310560	877-GAMOLR, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
8310560	8311560	Why not?
8311560	8312560	We'll do a couple more calls.
8312560	8316160	Maybe at least one more call since, you know, we were really thin on calls the past couple
8316160	8317160	of weeks.
8317160	8318440	I mean, our phone's been ringing tonight.
8318440	8319920	I guess folks have things to say.
8319920	8324140	Which is strange because this was not quite as busy of a news week as weeks past.
8324140	8327880	And I expect the next few shows leading up to mid-June are going to be a little bit of
8327880	8331360	the same thing because, you know, most companies are gonna try and keep it in their pants until
8331360	8332400	E3.
8332400	8339400	But you'll have little tidbits here and there just like, you know, you've got going with
8339400	8341000	A Little Big Planet 2 and everything.
8341000	8342000	But let's get you another call.
8342000	8343000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8343000	8344000	Who's this?
8344000	8345000	Do this, act deft.
8345000	8346000	Hey, act deft.
8346000	8347000	What's on your mind?
8347000	8348000	Not much.
8348000	8352720	I just want to talk about the Humble Indie Bundle.
8352720	8353720	What is this?
8353720	8354720	What?
8354720	8357680	The Humble Indie Bundle.
8357680	8361240	What is Humble Indie Bundle?
8361240	8367400	It's actually a six game pack you can download just by donating anything you want.
8367400	8368400	Oh!
8368400	8369400	Any amount of cash.
8369400	8371040	Didn't this come up on last week?
8371040	8372560	No, maybe I just read a story on it.
8372560	8374240	Or was it maybe a last minute story last week?
8374240	8375240	I don't remember.
8375240	8376820	I now know what you're talking about.
8376820	8380440	One of the games that's in there, is DeBlob one of them?
8380440	8384520	No, it's actually World of Goo.
8384520	8385520	World of Goo.
8385520	8386520	That's it.
8386520	8387520	I didn't get them confused.
8387520	8389160	They're both blobby slime games.
8389160	8391160	Alright, so there it is.
8391160	8392160	Okay, yes.
8392160	8395120	I did read about this, but go ahead.
8395120	8400980	It's World of Goo, Aquaria, Gish, Lugaru, and HD, and Pranumbra, Overture.
8400980	8407760	And also, they added a six game that is Samorost 2.
8407760	8411040	Did you actually pick this up and download it?
8411040	8413160	Yes, I actually did.
8413160	8415320	And what did you pay for it?
8415320	8419520	Even though Bobby may think I parried it, but no, I did pay for it.
8419520	8422040	You get to name your own price for this, right?
8422040	8428840	Yeah, that's the cool thing about it, that you can put your own price on it.
8428840	8440920	You can put just a cent, but if you don't want to look that cheap, you can donate a
8440920	8448400	dollar or six dollars, five dollars, ten dollars, or even, there's a donation here on the site
8448400	8458040	that says $1,000, so if you have a lot of cash to spend or donate, you can donate whatever
8458040	8459040	you want.
8459040	8460040	Very generous.
8460040	8461360	You know, Orange Launch Radio would happily take $1,000.
8461360	8464480	Actually, I won't drill you on how much you actually pay, but I do want to know, were
8464480	8468640	you able to pay in pesos, because you're from Mexico, or did you have to actually pay like
8468640	8471000	a conversion fee to translate to dollars?
8471000	8474280	Well, yeah, it's a conversion fee.
8474280	8481400	You can pay via PayPal, imasan.com checkout, or Google checkout also, if you got an account
8481400	8482400	of those sites.
8482400	8483400	I gotcha.
8483400	8487720	And plus, you live relatively close to the border of the US, so I don't know, do you
8487720	8492000	maybe have some bank accounts that deal in dollars?
8492000	8497120	I actually have international credit cards, so I just use them.
8497120	8500840	Usually people in border towns, you know, no matter where you are, have some type of
8500840	8505440	paths to kind of go between, so, alright, well, very cool.
8505440	8510520	So which, I'll quickly ask you this, which game was your favorite out of the bunch?
8510520	8516360	Well, I haven't tried any of them, because I got it today, though I have played World
8516360	8518120	of Goo, and that's a pretty good game.
8518120	8520120	Alright, well then you're gonna have to call us back, let us know.
8520120	8522680	I would recommend downloading this just for that game.
8522680	8526360	So you're donating money just based on that game, and like everything else, it's just
8526360	8527360	a bonus?
8527360	8528360	Probably.
8528360	8529360	That's fair enough.
8529360	8530360	Fair enough.
8530360	8531360	I can go with that.
8531360	8533640	Alright, well, Act Def, thank you for the heads up.
8533640	8538280	We always like cheap games, or expensive games, whatever you think they're worth.
8538280	8542520	I think I read somewhere the average amount that people were paying were like $10 for
8542520	8548560	all the games, so, you know, for six games, it's not a lot of money, but at the same time,
8548560	8551920	it's an average of everything, and I guess, you know, some people just simply can't afford
8551920	8552920	more.
8552920	8556240	So, hopefully people are paying what they really truly believe it's worth.
8556240	8562960	Yeah, the average contribution here is $8.36, though they have raised over $600,000.
8562960	8568080	Well, I guess in the end, that's what really counts, is the amount they've raised as a
8568080	8569080	whole.
8569080	8573880	Alright, well, Act Def, we're going to let you go, but thank you so much for your call.
8573880	8574880	Thank you.
8574880	8575880	Have fun with the games.
8575880	8577400	Alright, I like that heads up.
8577400	8582000	See, I like that, because it was a good heads up, and it was like a sale on games, although
8582000	8584520	I don't know if you really call that a sale or what.
8584520	8586480	There's been other games that have kind of done that lately.
8586480	8591240	877 Game O-L-R, username on Skype is OrangeLaungeo, we've got time to do at least one more call.
8591240	8594560	There's been a lot of kind of game things that have been doing this lately, like that
8594560	8599940	game, Alan and I were playing on Steam one day, and it's like you draw these crayon lines
8599940	8604520	with the mouse, and I can't remember the name of it, but that had a sale for a little while.
8604520	8605520	Crayon Physics?
8605520	8606520	Was that at Crayon Physics?
8606520	8607760	Yeah, I think it was.
8607760	8611640	You could pay whatever you want for that game, and there's been a few games that have done
8611640	8612640	that lately.
8612640	8614760	Didn't World of Goo just alone do that for a little while?
8614760	8616480	I think it did.
8616480	8619300	Could be wrong, though.
8619300	8626280	One day and 16 hours left, by the way, ActDeft is clarifying in chat, wolfire.com, W-O-L-F-I-R-E.com
8626280	8627280	slash humble.
8627280	8631240	Let's get to at least one more call here on OrangeLaungeo tonight before we say goodnight.
8631240	8632240	Hi, you're on OrangeLaungeo.
8632240	8634240	Who's this?
8634240	8636080	This is Amiga Triple Seven.
8636080	8637640	Amiga Triple Seven.
8637640	8638640	What's on your mind?
8638640	8646720	Well, first off, I'd like to give a Happy Mother's Day shout out to Dark Sakura.
8646720	8650080	Well, you're a mother to Shermy.
8650080	8651080	I am.
8651080	8652080	Yeah.
8652080	8653080	Well, yeah.
8653080	8654080	I have my cat.
8654080	8657840	I don't have actual children, but thank you.
8657840	8659840	Yeah.
8659840	8668440	And anyway, I was wondering, have you all heard about Angry Birds?
8668440	8669800	Like actual Angry Birds?
8669800	8670800	Wait a minute.
8670800	8671800	Is this a movie?
8671800	8672800	No.
8672800	8673800	Okay, never mind.
8673800	8675200	Then I'm thinking of something else.
8675200	8676200	No, I'm thinking of-
8676200	8677200	That's what you're thinking.
8677200	8678200	I'm thinking of Birdemic or whatever.
8678200	8679200	Why?
8679200	8680200	What is-
8680200	8682200	There's a new one with slugs now.
8682200	8683200	I'm thinking of something.
8683200	8685360	I'm thinking of like a sci-fi movie or something.
8685360	8686960	Sorry about that.
8686960	8687960	Like the birds.
8687960	8689960	You're probably like Alfred Hitchcock's supposed to know.
8689960	8690960	Yes.
8690960	8691960	That's what I'm thinking of.
8691960	8692960	Okay.
8692960	8693960	What is Angry Birds, sir?
8693960	8702240	Angry Birds is typically a game that no iPhone slash iPod touch user should be without today.
8702240	8704740	It's a game.
8704740	8706880	I gotta ask, is this your game?
8706880	8708960	No, I didn't make it.
8708960	8710840	All right, all right.
8710840	8712640	Then plug away.
8712640	8714000	Okay.
8714000	8727400	So basically, the story is you got these evil greenish pigs or whatever that stole the birds'
8727400	8734360	eggs and whatnot, and they're probably just doing God knows what with them.
8734360	8747680	And so what you have to do is unleash your vengeance with your birds by basically flinging
8747680	8764320	them, like across this little map, and destroying and eliminating all the pigs in the game.
8764320	8769660	Actually, I gotta tell you, real quick, Amigas77, I don't mean to cut you off, but we actually
8769660	8772980	just got delivered an exclusive commercial for the game.
8772980	8773980	You want to hear it?
8773980	8774980	Oh, yeah, sure.
8774980	8777200	Yeah, here it is, exclusive commercial for the game.
8777200	8778200	Right.
8778200	8781820	Brian, could I see that paper for a sec?
8781820	8782820	Huh.
8782820	8783820	That's odd.
8783820	8786560	I thought that would be big news.
8786560	8787820	You thought what would be big news?
8787820	8791900	Well, there seems to be an absence of a certain ornithological piece,
8792940	8797420	a headline regarding mass awareness of a certain avian variety.
8797420	8798460	What are you talking about?
8798460	8799340	Oh, have you not heard?
8799900	8802220	It was my understanding that everyone had heard.
8802220	8802780	Heard what?
8802780	8803420	Brian, don't!
8803420	8807820	A well-a-bird-bird-bird, a bird-a-well-a-bird-bird-bird.
8807820	8809100	Greatest episode ever.
8809100	8812300	A well-a-bird-bird-bird-bird, a bird-a-well-a-bird-bird-bird.
8812300	8815580	A bird's a word of Brian, don't you know about the bird?
8815580	8819580	Well, Peter's gonna tell you about the bird-a-well-a-bird-bird,
8819580	8823580	the bird's a word-a-well-a-bird-surfing bird.
8823580	8834940	Oh my god, Peter, are you all right?
8848300	8851820	This just in, Angry Birds just sold 10,000 copies right there.
8851820	8852700	Seriously?
8852700	8856220	No, I'm just fucking with you, come on.
8857100	8859180	This is Orange Lounge Radio, for heaven's sakes.
8859180	8861180	We love random tangents.
8861180	8863420	Sorry, I couldn't resist, I'm sorry.
8863980	8865340	Oh, that was awesome.
8865340	8866540	No, it's all good.
8866540	8868620	But seriously, it is selling a lot,
8868620	8872460	and the company claims it's in more countries than they can count.
8873180	8874460	It's become a big deal.
8876700	8880540	So, how much is this game going to sit you back?
8880540	8883420	Oh, it's just 99 cents.
8883420	8885420	Oh, well that's not bad at all.
8885420	8888700	Like, some people are saying it's so good, they think it's underpriced.
8889420	8892860	Well, now, I don't want them to go the route of that one guy
8892860	8895260	who, like, kept increasing the price of his game.
8895260	8898620	Like, what was that one game that went up to like $10,000 on the store
8898620	8900540	before Apple was like, what the fuck are you doing?
8900540	8901420	I don't know, he's a douchebag.
8901420	8903500	Get out, douchebag.
8903500	8905020	It was a social experiment.
8905020	8907100	Well, actually, you know what, though?
8907100	8908780	So what, he raised the price of his game.
8908780	8910220	People were dumb enough to buy it.
8910220	8913260	So, props to him for figuring out a way to make money.
8915900	8916380	Yeah.
8916380	8916860	All right.
8916860	8923500	Well, Amiga777, hopefully some folks will check out Angry Bird this week
8923500	8926860	and realize that the bird is indeed the word.
8926860	8927580	B-b-b-bird.
8927580	8929100	I need to get down.
8932060	8934220	Are you sure you didn't, are you sure you don't, like,
8934220	8935580	know the people that programmed it?
8935580	8937900	Or, you know, getting the cut for the profits?
8937900	8942540	Um, the name of the company?
8943900	8945900	No, do you know the people that made it?
8947100	8951100	Um, ClickGamer and Ravio.
8951100	8951500	Oh, OK.
8951500	8952620	You don't know them personally, though?
8952620	8953500	You don't have, like, their phone number?
8953500	8955100	No, I don't know the people.
8956380	8956860	All right.
8956860	8958940	Well, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show.
8958940	8959900	But thanks for the plug.
8959900	8962540	I'm sure the developers of the game really appreciate you right now.
8963660	8964140	Yeah.
8964140	8965100	And we appreciate you, too.
8965100	8966140	Take care, buddy.
8966140	8966620	Take care.
8966620	8967420	Take care.
8967420	8967900	All right.
8967900	8969820	That's going to do it for the Skypline tonight.
8971500	8974300	It's kind of funny because we don't really run commercials on this show.
8974300	8975100	But yet we do.
8976620	8979100	It's always somebody's podcast or game.
8979100	8980220	No, it's all good.
8980220	8980700	You know what?
8980700	8982060	We want to know what people are playing.
8982060	8984220	And I'm all for supporting indie developers.
8984220	8984780	It's all good.
8985340	8985740	All right.
8986460	8986940	That's it.
8986940	8992300	We're about ready to wrap up shop and be done here with the show tonight and be all over.
8992300	8995580	I don't know if you had any other last minute stories you want to get to before I close the show.
8995580	8997260	Not really a story at all.
8997260	9001660	But I think I mentioned on my Twitter, I got picked.
9001660	9003500	Not that I'm actually going to use the service.
9003500	9009420	I got picked to be a part of the Game Crush service, basically.
9009420	9011980	Because right now they have limited access to the website.
9011980	9017500	Is that the, like, almost prostitution but with video games?
9017500	9017740	Yes.
9017740	9019820	But now we get to view the actual website because I have...
9021500	9022300	It's funny.
9022300	9026860	I am all for tearing this thing up and looking at it on next week's show.
9026860	9030060	However, make sure there's no NDA or nothing because I don't want to get in no trouble.
9030060	9030780	Cease and desist.
9030780	9031500	Whatever.
9031500	9033260	Make sure we're good there.
9033260	9033580	All right.
9034940	9035260	All right.
9035260	9036620	Well, then we'll look at that in a few weeks.
9037980	9038460	That's it.
9038460	9040700	And I'm assuming our soccer doesn't have any last minute stories.
9040700	9041740	I think she said a moment ago.
9041740	9042700	Nope.
9042700	9043420	All right.
9043420	9046700	We're going to let her go back to playing Final Fantasy 2 and everybody go back to whatever
9046700	9047420	they're doing.
9047420	9048140	All right.
9048140	9052380	But first, we're going to wrap up the show by getting everybody's final thoughts.
9053420	9054460	My final thought first.
9054460	9055180	I'll start tonight.
9055180	9056700	I really don't want to go to the dentist.
9057740	9058700	Loki, your final thought.
9063660	9065100	Somebody leaked Sonic 4.
9066460	9068860	Dark Sakura, last but not least, your final thought tonight.
9069660	9070540	I want pie.
9071900	9073340	I had banana cream pie last night.
9073340	9073980	It was fabulous.
9073980	9075020	But I'm not eating pie.
9075020	9077740	I'll just make myself some chocolate something.
9077740	9078220	There you go.
9079500	9081900	Can't you have like spinach pie or something?
9082860	9085740	If I wasn't out of bananas, I'd just make myself some banana pudding.
9086620	9089580	Now, I know the whole thing is raw foods, but are you allowed to...
9090220	9093820	Like if you are putting it together and you put spinach and all this stuff in there,
9093820	9095660	are you allowed to put it in the oven and cook it?
9095660	9097260	Or no, you still have to stay away from that?
9097820	9099980	Allowing is such a strong word.
9101260	9103340	If I want it cooked, I'll have it cooked.
9103340	9104300	I mean, I'm not that.
9105100	9105980	As long as...
9105980	9110780	But the whole essence they say is not to heat it more than 117 degrees
9110780	9112540	because that's when the enzymes are destroyed.
9114460	9115500	Okay, that's why.
9115500	9117420	That being said, I hate cooked spinach.
9118220	9119180	Unless it's on a pizza.
9120460	9122620	Yeah, I like raw spinach much better.
9122620	9124300	Like spinach salad is the bomb.
9124860	9128380	I'm actually got stuff together to make myself a good spinach salad for lunch tomorrow.
9128380	9128880	Good times.
9129660	9130620	All right, anyhow.
9130620	9133660	See, it starts and ends with food here at Orange Launch Radio.
9133660	9137660	But if you like the show, please, please tell a friend about the show.
9137660	9139660	That's all we ask every week here at Orange Launch Radio.

9142940	9144540	and bringing the community together.
9144540	9146620	So all we ask, help add to our community.
9146620	9148220	Tell a friend or two about the show.
9148220	9152140	And if you're shy and don't want to do that or don't have friends you think would be into this,
9152140	9153980	then help us spread the word on the internets.
9153980	9155580	Leave us a 5-star review on iTunes.
9155580	9157100	It's like the best thing you could do.
9157100	9159580	Just search for Orange Launch Radio on iTunes and say,
9159580	9161980	I love OLR and leave a 5-star review.
9161980	9164060	I think there was actually a new one that was posted this week.
9164060	9166780	So thanks to, and I don't have it up in front of me right now,
9166780	9168380	but thanks to whoever posted that.
9168380	9169820	I'll try to credit you in a future week.
9170860	9171500	So that's it.
9172860	9173660	We're done.
9173660	9174380	We're out of here.
9175100	9178460	Until next week, we'll be back to do it all again.
9178460	9179180	Sound good, guys?
9179820	9180860	We'll be back next week.
9182540	9184300	Until then, I'm Rob.
9184300	9185100	She's Jamie.
9185100	9185900	He's Matt.
9185900	9186460	And we're done.
