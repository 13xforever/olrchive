Dark Sakura, Sky and Lowkey

Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 368 of Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The video game talk show where every gamer has a voice

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But not tonight apparently, tonight's going to be a little bit different

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And I will get to that in just a moment, but my name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Maybe hour, I don't know, we'll see how long we go tonight

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
With my co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It better not be hours

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Well yeah, it's already a little late, just to put it, well let me introduce everyone and then we'll get into what's going on tonight

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Also the one and only tech master, Lowkey

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Hello

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
How you doing Lowkey?

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm doing good

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Alright so here's the deal, we're not live, it's not Sunday, we're cheating a little bit

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You know usually we do this little program of ours live and we have a chat room full of people

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And you know live callers and all that stuff, but we are not live tonight

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We were supposed to be live last Sunday, the 20 something, 22nd, I don't know

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But we weren't live because it was kind of my fault

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I was out of town and while I was out of town my car was parked at a friend's house

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And somehow a nail ended up on my tire while it was parked at a friend's house

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So unfortunately instead of coming right home, picking up my car and driving right here to the show

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Which was the original plan, I had to go fix a tire

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So unfortunately the live show didn't happen

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So apologies to you kids and of course Lowkey and Dark Sakura who clear their schedules every Sunday night

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And I wasn't even here, I'm a bad person

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Damn nail

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's okay, I had more Red Dead Redemption in the play

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I was gonna say, you guys probably figured out something to do to kill time

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Because I knew pretty early in the day it wasn't gonna happen

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I hung out with Becky

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Well awesome, you got girl time, ew girl stuff

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And we went to Fresh Choice and ate salad

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Ew

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I can't condone that kind of behavior

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I know, gross

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Alright I'm glad I wasn't here, I'm glad I was 100 miles away from you

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Alright just kidding

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hey

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Alright well so here's the deal

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We already knew we weren't gonna be here Memorial Day weekend because it's Memorial Day weekend

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I know I for one am gonna be in Oregon and just you know the long weekend

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I think we wanna all do other stuff

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So if Dark Sakura wants to eat Fresh Choice three days in a row, she can go do that

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So we wanted to do like a show though at least for the podcastees

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So that way we're not going two weeks without a show

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So a lot of the podcast folks that don't usually tune in live

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This show's kind of actually for you because this way

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
A lot of the show's been kind of hitting the feed Wednesday, Thursday anyway

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So you guys will probably not even notice except for the fact that we don't have a live audience tonight

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That we're really missing anything

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So just kind of setting the stage there

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We're offline tonight, it's Wednesday so we're actually midweek

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And you know that's where we're at

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We're kind of taping this as a bridge to fill two weeks of no live shows

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I do want to point out though, we will be off Memorial Day

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Our next live show will be at allgames.com at 6pm Pacific time on Sunday, June 6th

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It'll be the next live show and that's right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
At 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And of course we always have our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So Robby says 6pm specific time

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Specific

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
At a specific time

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's 6! Specifically it's 6!

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm sorry

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I meant to say 6 Pacific but I kind of

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Really did that you started, I have to give you a hard time

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
See right now you've got me in the middle of the week on hump day

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
When my spirit hasn't quite been broken

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You know and I'm not doing the what's tomorrow

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So wait we might get good mood Jamie tonight

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm just teasing

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And you're full of salad, you ought to be in a great mood

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Actually I'm not full of salad right now, I'm full of taco

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay, ooh tacos

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I had, because we have to do food

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I had refried black beans and brown Spanish rice

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
On a sprouted green tortilla

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yum

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I haven't eaten dinner yet and I'm smelling Loki's chicken so

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That's why I ate cause he brings his chicken in and I'm like yum wait I can't eat that

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I just didn't want burgers tonight, it's all good

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Rob do you want me to make you some dinner?

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
No no I gotta stop by and get some stuff for the big road trip

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Cause I am driving 10 hours to Portland Oregon

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And I've never taken a road trip that long

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I've never been to Oregon

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You should get some raw nuts

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
For the trip

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Raw nuts and dried fruit

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Good times

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Alright here's the other interesting thing about tonight's show

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And what might make this show a little special

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We don't have a script tonight, usually we have you know not that the show is scripted

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Or even fun but we usually have like an outline, we call it a show roll

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And you've probably heard us refer to it before

101
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
A little behind the scenes there

102
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We do have like a list of who's gonna cover what topic

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That way we're not stepping on each other's toes

104
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And we kinda know who's gonna talk about what

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And you know we have a general flow to the show

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Not tonight, we're winging it tonight

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
This is gonna be like the old days

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Remember the old days?

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Except I don't have the headset on and I won't have a migraine hopefully

110
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So yeah so I

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I know I might get high on chicken fumes

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We'll see what happens, we don't know

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But we do always start off the show with how was your gaming week

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And we don't plan to change that

115
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I gamed Rob, I gamed

117
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I played Portal

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Because it was free

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And it's really hard to get used to the controls on

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You know from going from playing on a controller to playing on

121
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
My PC but it's pretty cool

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And I of course played a lot of Star Trek online

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Because I've got the week off, you know I'm out of school

124
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And it's like I've got all this stuff I have to focus on

125
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But I so haven't been able to

126
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And I played some Babylonian Twins today

127
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
For a little bit

128
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And Dan's playing more Grand Theft Horse

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He killed his horse by accident

130
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Except he died too so he got his horse back

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
He keeps complaining about not having his original horse

132
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Because he liked his horse

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I was like what was good about the horse?

134
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It was a bay horse and I liked it, it was pretty

135
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Oh whatever

136
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So yeah and he was picking his you know gristled cowboys

137
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Out picking flowers for this old guy

138
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And then Pac-Man, Google Pac-Man

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Because Namco had their 25th anniversary

140
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I think it's 30th

141
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
30th anniversary

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
30th anniversary and so the Google splash thing was a playable version of Pac-Man

143
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And if you go to Google.com slash Pac-Man

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You can actually go back and play it

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What's impressive about that if I recall

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I was reading up on it

147
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's not like Flash

148
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's not Java

149
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's using some pretty basic web technology to bring it to you

150
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Which is really impressive

151
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The programming

152
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And actually I was checking out the Twitter earlier

153
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Somebody on Twitter is going to have us talk about that a little more

154
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It looks like it actually resulted in a lot of lost productivity at work

155
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Fascinating

156
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Was it Cnet or one of those news sites posted about how much had been lost

157
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And then it went on saying that that's really nothing compared to the little five minutes at a time

158
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
People sneak on reading Wikipedia from their desk

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Right

160
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So they're using it as a scapegoat and as an excuse to ban Google

161
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You know what

162
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
From work sites

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
We're free form tonight

164
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Let me jump over to Twitter real quick

165
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm going to jump over to Twitter real quick

166
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And read one of the tweets we got earlier

167
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Even though we're not live and we don't have the chatters tonight

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We did post on Twitter

169
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Hey give us stories

170
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We'll still try to interact with you the best we can

171
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Because you know we can't just go to all games and say

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We want to be live right now

173
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Because I think there's another show on right now

174
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It was from Dr. Noire

175
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Dr. N-O-I-R

176
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Dr. Noire

177
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Here's the fallout from Google's Pac-Man tribute

178
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Sending us a tweet from BBC News

179
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The playable version of the classic video game was put on Google's front page on 21st of May

180
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
To celebrate 30 years since the launch of Pac-Man in Japan

181
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Now there were statistics gathered by the software firm Rescue Time

182
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
About how much this damn thing was actually played

183
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
On a typical day it suggests that most people will do about 22 searches on the Google page

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Each one lasts about 11 seconds

185
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But putting Pac-Man on the front page

186
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It boosted that time by an average of about 36 seconds

187
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And that would be based on the browsing habits of 11,000 Rescue Time users

188
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I guess it's the software that companies install on their computers

189
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
To know who's being naughty on the internet when they're not supposed to be

190
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And so let's see they did all the math

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And they figured that with 504 million unique users

192
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Who visit the main Google page per day

193
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That means 4.8 million hours, 549 years were wasted on Pac-Man

194
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Assuming that people are paid on average $25 an hour

195
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Really?

196
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I know I was like I want to know what that is so I can work there

197
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Or $17.50 if you want to convert it to pounds an hour

198
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
This equates to about $120 million in lost productivity

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I think that's some fuzzy math there if you ask me but

200
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Well yeah $25 an hour I mean come on

201
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Bottom line people will still waste time on Pac-Man even if it's just 36 seconds

202
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Got Pac-Man fever

203
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Alright so we'll go back to the other tweets later

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But I thought that was topical and worth mentioning

205
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So yeah I checked out the Google Pac-Man it was cool

206
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's topical like hydrocortisone

207
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And it emulated the original Pac-Man pretty well

208
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It was pretty fun except there's this one part where there's the grid a little bit off

209
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Where the last E is because the little place you enter in on the E

210
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Is actually sort of just off center from where the escape door is

211
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yes and then the G is just weird

212
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Because you have like this dead end tunnel you don't really have on a Pac-Man board usually

213
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I mean it was a great concept

214
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You know what I hope for for the 35th?

215
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Super Pac-Man Google

216
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Lordy

217
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Because Ms. Pac-Man already made a cameo in the other one if you clicked insert coin

218
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Anyway

219
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
This is true Rob

220
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Anything else in your gaming week you want to report for us?

221
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I got my Sims 3 working again so I've been playing more Sims

222
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
As you can see here I'm back to my hunt for

223
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That's a Sims site?

224
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I thought you were like shopping for like IKEA or something over there

225
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
There's people who've actually tried to

226
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Well IKEA and EA had this deal going on for a while

227
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Where they had some of their standard stuff available for Sims 2

228
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Now did your Sims have to actually build it and get frustrated as hell

229
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
When they couldn't understand the instructions because they're nothing but pictures?

230
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
No

231
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But um there's people who missed the IKEA stuff

232
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And have really gone

233
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Like you know I'm looking at some of the furniture on here

234
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And this is actually some

235
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
As a design major Rob

236
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
This is actually pretty impressive stuff

237
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
If anyone wants to know the sites that I go to for my Sims stuff

238
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I go to The Sims Resource

239
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I actually have a subscription to The Sims Resource

240
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Mod The Sims is good but Stylist Sims

241
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Has got some really

242
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's got donation stuff and I don't really advocate donation items

243
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You know because you have to pay for them

244
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But at the same time people did put work into this stuff

245
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But there's some absolutely gorgeous design stuff

246
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I would really have in my actual house

247
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Should I be able to afford it ever

248
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm surprised Sims doesn't have something like that

249
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I mean in World of Warcraft you can go through certain websites

250
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And you can get an actual figure of your WoW character

251
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
From the data it pulls down from the armory

252
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I mean

253
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's crazy like how interactive some of this stuff is now

254
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm surprised you can't buy some of your

255
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Like a fake Sims house that's your actual Sims house

256
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
If that makes any sense at all

257
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I know what you mean

258
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You know how like in the fifth grade we used to have to build houses out of balsa wood

259
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
For like a school project

260
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I never had to do that

261
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Really? In the fourth grade we had to make missions out of sugar cubes

262
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You were in Alabama

263
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
See we had the missions here in California

264
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Did you have to do this in school?

265
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah I had to make a mission

266
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You had to build the missions out of sugar cubes

267
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I think mine had a pasta roof

268
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Cause you know how the roofs of the missions

269
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You know you've seen the California missions on the coast right

270
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
They kind of have that very clay wavy look

271
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Well you use like lasagna and you paint it

272
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I made mine out of Legos

273
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yeah I never had to do that

274
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
We would instead

275
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Every so often head down to the museum downtown

276
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Cause keep in mind where I'm from

277
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You just sneeze and you'll hit something that's been around since the 18th century

278
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I was actually showing Loki before you got here some of the old Victorian homes

279
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If you look up Victorian homes, Mobile Alabama

280
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You will see some absolutely gorgeous places

281
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But the museum downtown recreated a lot of these in doll size

282
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Well there's some stuff from the 18th century around here

283
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's called gold

284
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Did you hear about this big rock

285
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Apparently somebody dug up

286
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Up in Cameron Park or something

287
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Big old gold nugget just hiding in the backyard

288
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
My mom keeps telling me that I should go out panning

289
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And I'm like okay you come out to California

290
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
In 113 degree weather and you pan

291
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That was another stupid thing we did as kids

292
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
We used to go take the bus up to Sutter's Fort or whatever and do gold panning

293
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Sutter's Mill

294
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Or Sutter's Mill sorry Sutter's Fort is the place downtown

295
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
We used to actually go out to reservations

296
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Really

297
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I've been to a couple pallets

298
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I go to reservations now but I go gambling

299
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I've actually been to about 5 pallets

300
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
We never really had to do anything

301
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I don't want to say stupid but time wasting like that I guess

302
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Because first of all with some of the stupid children

303
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You know parents hated that shit because they had to do half of it

304
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But we did have to do, we had a lot of focus on doing actual full science projects

305
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And experiments and real lab time

306
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The worst was when I got to high school

307
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Because I've talked about this on the show before in my high school

308
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The Whitey McWhite High that I went to that was two thirds Mormon kids

309
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And it was all these rich kids that lived out by the lake

310
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And then like you know I lived in the poor part of town where I came from

311
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So we went to this school I kid you not it was the most undiverse place on the planet

312
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I mean it was tragic

313
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Right from a John Hughes movie

314
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
But you know you had all these spoiled ass little rich kids

315
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Like I'm sure they were like hiring people to do their school projects

316
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It was pretty like you know we had to build the houses and stuff

317
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
They would be made from like actual stone and all this stuff

318
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And it's just like you spoiled bitch

319
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Mine's made out of popsicle sticks

320
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Where I actually had to eat all the popsicles over the course of like three months

321
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That's the fun part

322
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That's true

323
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Now you can just go to Michael's and get a bag of popsicle sticks

324
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I know

325
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And I'm like god damn ungrateful kids

326
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Who didn't have to realize the value of the popsicles that come with two sticks

327
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Because they're just two popsicles glued together

328
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I don't even remember what they're called

329
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You can get fudgesicles like that

330
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What the hell tangent is this show on right now?

331
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You know what I miss? Pudding pops

332
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
They're still around aren't they?

333
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
They came back

334
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I miss pudding pop commercials

335
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Those are the best

336
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Dude cause it's all about Bill Cosby

337
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But you know you remember one of my favorite comics ever is Bloom County

338
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And I always liked that um

339
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What was the guy's name?

340
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But his dad Bill Cosby lived in his anxiety closet with pudding pops

341
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Cosby here with a special report from Jello Brand Pudding Pops

342
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Mothers do your kids talk like this?

343
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Chocolate

344
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
vanilla

345
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Swirl

346
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Don't worry they're just asking for Jello Pudding Pops Swirls

347
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Good news for your mom and you mom

348
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
That wasn't one of the better commercials

349
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Sounds delicious

350
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That was like a fake newscast

351
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I know now you got me fucking hungry

352
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Pudding pops

353
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Rude

354
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Alright um I want to go back a little bit

355
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Something you were mentioning earlier

356
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
They even make pudding pops anymore?

357
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I just said they brought them back

358
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio

359
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Hello Loki

360
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Hey I'm working on the show

361
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Alright fine

362
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yeah he wants to do this thing called news

363
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Like we're trying to fucking talk about pudding pops

364
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And Loki's concerned with gaming news

365
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
As if we are a video game talk show

366
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
When we're done though with the gaming week though

367
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I do need to make a plug

368
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Or do you want me to do it now?

369
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Uh you can do it now but I want to say one other thing about your gaming week

370
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Because you said earlier that Portal is a bitch to control on the computer

371
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yes

372
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I want to give you a pro tip awesome and a lot of people forget about this

373
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Controller?

374
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Xbox 360 controllers

375
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
They're USB you can plug them right in

376
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
If you have a wired one

377
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I honestly think the wired 360 controllers are almost a better purchase

378
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Than the wireless ones

379
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
At least have one you know

380
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I think I've got one

381
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah I have one I think I have like three controllers and one of them is wired

382
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And it's great because I can go to the computer and use it there

383
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And it's pretty awesome

384
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But I have kind of gotten the hang of doing some of the puzzles

385
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Just I keep forgetting that I look

386
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Well see I've got a thumb track ball on my mouse

387
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So looking around with the track ball is kind of difficult for me

388
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And then remembering that you know

389
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I wish it's just that I could have my action button

390
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Like in Resident Evil back in the day

391
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And hold my action button and turn around and walk

392
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You know but meh

393
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Okay you want to plug something

394
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I think I know what you want to plug

395
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And if it is what I think it is then cool

396
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I was wondering when we could say something about this

397
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Well there is a new website that is currently being worked on

398
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
By our dear Tiara as we know on the show

399
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You know as Mar and Marvel

400
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's geek-life.com

401
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And the site launches on the 1st

402
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And I do an article on there one called Geek Cube

403
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Where it's you know about being a geek working in a cubicle

404
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And you know but we're

405
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Instead of being game specific or you know

406
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Anime specific or something

407
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
We're geek total geek

408
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Just nerdy geeky dorky fun

409
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Nerdy geeky dorky fun that's right

410
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I wonder if that domain name is taken

411
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Nerdy geeky dorky fun

412
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
No competition please

413
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
But we are looking for people to contribute

414
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So if you have something that you want to share

415
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
If you want to write an article

416
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
We do however ask that you use a spell checker

417
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Someone to proofread it

418
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Because if you don't then we're going to be brutal

419
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'll try to contribute once in a while

420
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
If you lovely ladies will have me

421
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Of course we'll have you for dinner

422
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Or something related because that's what I know

423
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'll do a wow column

424
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Well I'm going to have other side projects too

425
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Coming up and I know you and I have been talking about one

426
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Hopefully E3 this year will have a press conference of our own

427
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It'll be fun

428
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Good stuff in the future

429
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Well the other thing too is that I'm planning on doing a DIY

430
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Segment you know maybe once a week

431
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
On there too about doing little do it yourself projects

432
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You know how to decoupage

433
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Oh god geek decoupage

434
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's geek decoupage

435
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Dude I've got my bathhouse picture back there

436
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
That's pretty cool

437
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
That's art geek decoupage

438
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But yeah but I mean that's the general thing so

439
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Alright let's move on with gaming weeks

440
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Also anyone out there looking for designer

441
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Hire me

442
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Low key how was your gaming week

443
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It was good I didn't play a whole lot though

444
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I played basically well two things

445
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
But one whatever anyways

446
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Red Dead Redemption playing a lot of that

447
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Grand Theft Tours

448
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Been playing mostly System Link multiplayer

449
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Because we were playing it at work

450
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And it's been pretty fun

451
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You can do little gang missions and stuff

452
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And join a posse and kill people

453
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And you get experience which unlocks more characters you can play as

454
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And more mounts and more weapons

455
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
So that's all kind of fun

456
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
The first kind of real day that we decided to go play that

457
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
We were running around fighting bears with knives

458
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Which is funny because the willing critters seem to team up against you

459
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
In fact there was one point where I had a coyote

460
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
A boar and a bear chasing after me

461
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Coyote didn't really do much but the boar was really quick

462
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And knocked me over and then left me to get eaten by the bear

463
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
So that sucked

464
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And then the cougars are little fuckers

465
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
They chase after you really fast and keep killing me

466
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Is Courtney Cox one of the cougars?

467
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Maybe

468
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I didn't name any of them so I guess one of them could be Courtney Cox

469
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Then of course other than that I've played more Grand Theft Auto

470
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And that's been pretty fun

471
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The major part I've been working on stuff with Grand Theft Auto

472
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Like I mentioned before is I'm working on creating another modded game

473
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
For us to play at work

474
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And the major achievement that I was able to accomplish this week

475
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Is that I figured out how to edit the map

476
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
In Grand Theft Auto on the console

477
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Which as far as I'm aware now has never been done before

478
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So that's been pretty awesome

479
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And I ran into some roadblocks before with stuff being rotated weird

480
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
But I actually figured that all out last night

481
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So I'm ready to create all sorts of crazy stuff

482
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Including giant loop-de-loops and stuff like that

483
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Lots of ramps

484
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
But yeah, back to Red Dead Redemption though

485
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
That game is so glitchy

486
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's just hilarious

487
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I was playing today, called my horse over

488
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And the horse came galloping at me at full speed

489
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Off a cliff to its death

490
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Bounced in front of me

491
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And then bounced off another cliff

492
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm like what the hell

493
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I've seen some angry tweets about

494
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I think I saw a tweet earlier this week that was like

495
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Did anybody QA test this game?

496
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Well there was some other ones

497
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Like there was one of the missions that we were doing

498
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
The first posse mission that we did

499
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
We were going after this one gang

500
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
We had to destroy their ammo caches

501
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And so after you destroy the second one

502
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
There's reinforcements that are sent after you

503
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Well for whatever reason they decided to spawn up on the hill

504
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And they jumped to their death

505
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And it was awesome

506
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It has problems with cliffs

507
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It just doesn't understand them sometimes

508
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And so it was just like kept hearing this

509
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Ahhhhhh

510
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
See people die

511
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It's like Toons is the driving horse

512
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It's awesome

513
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And then there's been other videos I've seen that have problems

514
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Where different objects are spawning on different characters

515
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
So for example

516
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Instead of your mount that's a donkey

517
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You have a woman

518
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So you're riding around on a woman that sounds like a donkey

519
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And has a horse face

520
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I think I saw something like that on the internet once

521
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Yes

522
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And then some other

523
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Crows that are actually people

524
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
So they're like flying around

525
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And flapping their arms and stuff

526
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And that's pretty funny

527
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And I think the funniest one I saw

528
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Other than the cougar man

529
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Was the dog

530
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Bounty hunter

531
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Like a real dog

532
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Like a coyote

533
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
So it was this coyote running around carrying a rifle

534
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
That's pretty funny

535
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Oh and there's a wonderful glitch where you can

536
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Crouch against a wall and get shot up into space

537
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So should I buy it?

538
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
There's great reviews and everything

539
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It's a lot of fun

540
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
There's tons of people on there to play with

541
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Grand Theft Tourist Rob

542
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And if you don't want to play with those people

543
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
You can always start a private game

544
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And just mess around or go on missions

545
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I don't like to play with strangers

546
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'll play with people on my friends list

547
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And you guys and the listeners

548
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
What if the strangers want to play with you?

549
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
No

550
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
No means no

551
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Alright

552
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Kind of piggybacking on that and going into my gaming week

553
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
As part of this whole Oregon thing

554
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You know they don't have sales tax in Oregon

555
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I'm making a list of games

556
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I want to buy while I'm up in Oregon

557
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm going to buy that

558
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I think

559
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
That's kind of like on the bubble so to speak

560
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
But I definitely want to get Blur

561
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I want to get Split Second

562
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Is Split Second cool?

563
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yeah, Dan loves it

564
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Alan Wake I hear is pretty awesome

565
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Somebody described it as like a Twin Peaks

566
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Type video game

567
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I realized all you all were

568
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
All big on, well not you guys specifically

569
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Just the general, if Twitter is any indication

570
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Of where the world's at

571
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Everybody went nucking futs over the Lost finale

572
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
This weekend, which ironically was on Sunday night

573
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I think there was actually a tweet out there

574
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
That said, you guys cancelled the show

575
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
To go watch the Lost finale

576
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I don't watch Lost

577
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I watch good shows

578
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I'm not hating on Lost

579
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Any show that gets people talking as much as that show did

580
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Is doing something right

581
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
But I didn't watch the first few episodes

582
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And it's one of those shows where if you don't watch the first few episodes

583
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
You're fucked, it's not going to make any sense

584
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So I never watched it

585
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
If I can interject, back to Alan Wake

586
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Dan described it as

587
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Oh great, what's that game?

588
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Silent Hill meets Max Payne

589
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Interesting

590
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Sounds good, no, well I was going to say

591
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Before Lost, way back when

592
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
In the 90's there was a little show called Twin Peaks

593
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
It was awesome

594
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And it was a total like WTF

595
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Mind trip as well, it didn't last very long sadly

596
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
They really screwed with it

597
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
On the time slots and they answered

598
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
The show's biggest question

599
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Who killed Laura Palmer way too soon

600
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And so that kind of killed the show when that happened

601
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
But I say that because

602
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I love that show and if there's any video game

603
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Being remotely compared to that show

604
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I'm all about it, so I'll check it out

605
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Yeah, so I'm making this list

606
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And then my goal is to just go hit up a GameStop

607
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Or Fry's or whatever they have up there

608
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And just go to town

609
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
What's the big thing they have up there?

610
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Fred Meyer

611
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Those ginormous stores

612
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
That they have I guess

613
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Go check out one of those

614
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So that's the plan

615
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
As far as my actual gaming week in games I've been playing

616
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Not a whole lot this week, of course more

617
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
But I want to say something on that in a minute

618
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Alan hit 80 this week

619
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
So I'm very happy and proud for him

620
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
But now that he has hit 80

621
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I think I'm going to, believe it or not

622
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Scale back on WoW a little bit

623
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And I am making it my summer goal

624
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Before Labor Day

625
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
To actually beat

626
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And this is a big deal for me

627
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I mean actually beat from start to finish

628
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Three games

629
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And I realize that might sound like nothing

630
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
But this is me we're talking about

631
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
For me to actually complete

632
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
A role playing game or an adventure game

633
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Or something like that is a BFD

634
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Because I have the worst gamer ADD

635
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I will start a game and play it for an hour and go somewhere else

636
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
No I have not

637
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
See!

638
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
That's the problem

639
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
You know you gotta let me borrow it

640
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So WoW will be

641
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Scaled back

642
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I'll still do the raids with the guild

643
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And play with Alan for at least an hour

644
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Several times a week and so forth

645
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And actually beat three games

646
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And I don't mean like beating

647
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
What's something like really easy

648
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
That takes like five seconds to beat

649
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
You know like

650
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Well no I don't think that would be one of the games anyway

651
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
But uh

652
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Like Final Fight

653
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I played in an hour

654
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I beat Final Fight that doesn't count

655
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
That takes like an hour

656
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I'm going to beat three adventure RPG

657
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Something games

658
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So I don't know what yet

659
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
But I want you guys

660
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
As my gamer nerd buddies

661
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Here in studio to hold me to it

662
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And if I'm lagging

663
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I need verbal lashings

664
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Do you think you can do that Dark Sakura?

665
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Verbal lashings?

666
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I'll point at you and laugh

667
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Well I'm down for that

668
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I'm going to try Alan Wake

669
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And if I like it that will probably be one of the three

670
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
But I'll let you know

671
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Because I might not like it I don't know

672
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And I might say no I legitimately do not want to play this to completion

673
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
But a game like Final Fantasy 13

674
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Really ought to be one of the three

675
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Well beat it and then lend it to me

676
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Get his copy

677
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Whoever beats it first let me borrow it

678
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Sure

679
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I'll tell you right now

680
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I want to play it on PS3

681
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I'm out

682
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Oh I have the PS3 version so I'll have to beat it and then let you borrow it

683
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Alright I'm going to beat it yet

684
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
You beat it yet Rob

685
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Fair enough

686
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Someone else needs to get me to Cydia

687
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Other stuff in my gaming week

688
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Game Room I'm still playing the crap out of that

689
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And River Raid came out today

690
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
It's rare that we have the show mid-week

691
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Where I can talk about releases as they happen

692
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
River Raid was a classic classic Atari 2600 game made by Activision

693
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
My Activision room has like six Activision games in it right now

694
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It's crazy

695
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I've literally bought like ten games in Game Room

696
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I've spent

697
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
If you say like three to five dollars a game

698
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Most of them I only paid three

699
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Four but there's a few that I also play on the PC

700
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
So I bought the upgrade

701
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
That means I've spent like thirty five bucks on this game so far

702
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Which you might want to point and laugh at me

703
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Fine ha ha go ahead

704
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
But I'm getting my money's worth

705
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I'm playing the games quite a bit

706
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
They are cheaper than virtual console games

707
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
They are

708
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And I'm having fun with it

709
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
You know like Bobby and I have had these friendly little competitions on some games

710
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And you guys know Bradley

711
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Arcadian

712
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Dude did you know he was in the top twenty for Time Pilot earlier this week

713
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Really?

714
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Yeah he's pretty good at that stuff

715
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
He wiped my score on Mega Maniac

716
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
But I'm still number one

717
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
On Pitfall and Crystal Castles

718
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
So anyhow

719
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I made it up to rank sixty eight

720
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
In Grand Theft Auto

721
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Did you? Well I thought you were sixty seven a couple weeks ago

722
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Yeah I keep losing the game here

723
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It sucks because it takes me like twenty games

724
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
To get up a few ranks

725
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And like all I have to do is lose to one person

726
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Not even lose the game

727
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Come in second, buy like a few bucks

728
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
And it drops me down a bunch

729
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It's really unfair

730
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
But I'm doing pretty good

731
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I haven't lost a game in a while

732
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Alright let's get to housekeeping tonight

733
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Of course our Twitter

734
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Twitter.com slash olr

735
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
We're going to get to the Twitter topics in a little bit

736
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And then also our Facebook

737
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Please add us there

738
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio

739
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Apparently we have a MySpace still too

740
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
But if I haven't added you to MySpace

741
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I check it like maybe once every three months

742
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So don't be sad

743
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Just send us a friend request there

744
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Although I ought to just delete it

745
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
But any promotion is good promotion I suppose

746
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Okay

747
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So how about gaming news

748
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
We'll get into that a little bit

749
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Okay there's like

750
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I don't know if you have anything you want to talk about Jamie

751
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I know Loki's got a bunch

752
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
He was a good guy earlier and went through the show

753
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
There's like two things I want to talk about tonight

754
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I'll start with the one that has been big today

755
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
And I think yesterday was when the buzz started

756
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Let's talk Rock Band 3

757
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Alright so here's what happened

758
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
The Green Day Rock Band demo

759
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Came out on Xbox Live and PlayStation

760
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And you know it's got a couple songs

761
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
You can play and check out what Green Day Rock Band's all about

762
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
But the biggest splash of this

763
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Was that there is a teaser page

764
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I guess at the very end of the demo

765
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
That shows you know how in

766
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Rock Band you have little icons

767
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
You have like a little guitar icon

768
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
A little bass icon, a little microphone for the singer

769
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And little drums

770
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Well guess what next to all these icons

771
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And the number three

772
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Is a little keyboard

773
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And it looks like at first glance

774
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
They are going to add keyboards

775
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
To Rock Band 3

776
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And when I first heard this news

777
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I got really excited because

778
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
You know Orange Lawns Radio

779
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
We started as a music game based show

780
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And we used to play games like

781
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Drummania, Guitar Freaks

782
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And some of the games that inspired

783
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
You could say Rock Band in some ways

784
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Well the one I always loved

785
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
That I thought was really under appreciated

786
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Because they killed it off way too quick

787
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
After only three versions

788
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Which I know sounds like a lot but when you consider

789
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
2DX is on

790
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
19 or 19 is being tested right now

791
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And then Guitar Freaks

792
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Is on like

793
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
16 or 17 I mean there is a crap ton of these games

794
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Keyboard Mania

795
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Which I was actually good at

796
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I could beat the hardest song in the game

797
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I couldn't do it on doubles

798
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I guess that would really be the hardest mode in the game

799
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
We have a friend who is really good in doubles

800
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Oh yeah

801
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I would like to think I was one of the better Keyboard Mania players

802
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I could do it

803
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I was good at it

804
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I had to pick it up so I could play with you

805
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And I was pissed when they discontinued it

806
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Because it was like the one Bomani game

807
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I was actually pretty good at

808
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
So I heard this news about Rock Band 3

809
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And I was like oh my god

810
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
They are actually going to do it

811
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
They are going to put out a keyboard

812
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Oh my god I'm like whoa this is going to be great

813
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
They are going to be great for this

814
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm all excited right

815
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Well today I guess a news story came out that says

816
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Well

817
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
It might not actually be a keyboard

818
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It might be a key-tar

819
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Meaning the guitar

820
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And the keyboard mixed together

821
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Meaning like

822
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
If you see one of those old ass pictures

823
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Of like I don't know Journey

824
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
From the 80's with a big

825
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Hair

826
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Playing a keyboard on a guitar

827
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
They really needed to make it just a keyboard

828
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I realize a lot of you think that's cool

829
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
This is how you freeze pop the game

830
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Or just any 80's

831
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Band practically had that

832
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And I realize a lot of you think it's cool

833
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
But boy did that feel like

834
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
A punch in the stomach

835
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Like oh we are going to do this really cool thing

836
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And then we are going to make it so stupid

837
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
By making it a key-tar

838
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Whatever I'll play it anyway

839
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
It's one of those things where

840
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I could always just like put the key-tar

841
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
On the ground and do it that way

842
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And just pretend I don't see the stem

843
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
But I don't know if that'll work

844
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm thinking it's just screen real estate

845
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
How the hell are you going to do keyboards

846
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
With three other

847
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
How are you going to do a five person band

848
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Or even an eight person band

849
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Well let's see three singers

850
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Guitar

851
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Bass

852
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Drums and a keyboard

853
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
So you'd have a band of like

854
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I have a feeling

855
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Call it a gut

856
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
But if they do key-tar I think it'll scroll

857
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Sideways

858
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I think that's how they'll do it

859
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
They'll have vocals at top and key-tar on the bottom

860
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And then the normal tracks in the middle

861
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I have nothing to base that off of

862
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Obviously this is going to be at E3

863
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Obviously

864
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And we'll know more then

865
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
But until then it's all speculation really

866
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Except for the fact that you know what

867
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Putting that little symbol of a keyboard in the game

868
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Is a question accomplished

869
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
People are talking rock band and oh what could this be

870
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Most importantly

871
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Something that Guitar Hero is not doing

872
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
That was good of them to keep this a secret

873
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
For a while because that way

874
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Now it's something to differentiate it from its biggest competitor

875
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Pretty smart

876
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
But you know

877
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
We shall see when we shall see

878
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Apparently there's something else in this too

879
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
About like there's going to be a mode

880
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
That's super difficult

881
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
But it's just to emulate like actual guitar

882
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
In drum playing or something

883
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I'd heard something about that

884
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
So that could be interesting

885
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
What I would really most like to see

886
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Is them keep, especially for rock band

887
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Is them keep in the harmony

888
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
The three part harmony

889
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
That they had in Beatles rock band

890
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I think they confirmed that

891
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And one of the dudes slipped up at PAX East

892
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I remember this happening because

893
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
My friends were there at that panel

894
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
He was there when the guy said

895
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Oh well rock band 3 has harmonies

896
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And then they were all like shut up

897
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
It doesn't matter

898
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It's confirmed because also

899
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It's in Green Day rock band

900
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Oh because it's got the mic

901
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And it's got three mics

902
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I really really hope all the songs

903
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Are still backwards compatible

904
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I don't expect them to go back

905
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And add harmonies and keytar

906
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Or whatever they do to all of them

907
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I would still be thrilled if at least

908
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I could just have one massive library

909
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
It's gonna be one massive library

910
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Obviously the newer songs

911
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Will support newer things

912
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
It'll be interesting to see

913
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
What they do with the Green Day rock band

914
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Because those do support three part harmonies

915
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I believe

916
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I think it would be cool if they just went back

917
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
And maybe take the top

918
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
20 download songs

919
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Cause they know

920
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
What 20 songs have sold more

921
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Than any other

922
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Take the top 20 and add support

923
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Or maybe not all of them

924
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Would lend themselves very well to keytar

925
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Or harmony

926
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
So take the top 20 songs that would

927
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And just go back and touch those up

928
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
That's gonna be enough to get people excited

929
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
People were speculating

930
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Because now that you have the three part harmonies

931
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And keyboard

932
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Bohemian Rhapsody

933
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
That is hot

934
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
That is hot

935
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Just the fact that Queen could be in the game

936
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
At all, well actually I think there's a few songs

937
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
But just Bohemian Rhapsody would be amazing

938
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I would really like to see

939
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
At least some of the Beatles rock band stuff carry over

940
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Is the Van Halen Guitar Hero thing exclusive

941
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Because you know if there's

942
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Guitar, you know if keyboards are in this

943
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
At all in any way shape

944
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Or form

945
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
It has to have jump

946
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It has to have

947
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Do do do do do

948
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Like how can you have one of those plastic

949
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Keyboards sitting in your house and not want to play that

950
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
It's gonna be awesome

951
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I'm definitely gonna be picking this up

952
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
One of the local stores here in Sacramento Guitar Center

953
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I think that's a nationwide store

954
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
They actually had a sign up at one of their stores

955
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
By the keyboard display

956
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
That says, the following songs are

957
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Banned, if you play this song

958
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
You will be kicked out of the store

959
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Chopsticks

960
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Fur Elise

961
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And jump

962
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I'm surprised they don't have the axle fully themed

963
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
No stairway denied

964
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
It's that whole scene exactly

965
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
But for real

966
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Anyhow

967
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I'm excited, I'm glad to see they're shaking it up

968
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Beyond just making it prettier

969
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
For Rock Band 3, that's gonna be pretty cool

970
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Another piece of plastic crap

971
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
To have in my house

972
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I saw my instruments at work

973
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
In our game room

974
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I don't have room in my little apartment

975
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I already had to downsize for my house

976
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I have bullshit everywhere

977
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Another plastic instrument is the last fucking thing

978
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I need right now

979
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
The thing I love

980
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And it's an awesome investment

981
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Was my drum bag

982
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Cause I can keep my drums and all the other stuff in there

983
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Except for the guitars, the guitars are separate

984
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I have two guitars

985
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Or a guitar and a bass

986
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I do need to get a new guitar though

987
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Cause it's crapping out

988
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Funny enough though

989
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Speaking of quality

990
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
The guitar 2 guitar that I still have

991
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Is fucking awesome

992
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
It still works great

993
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
The guitar 2 guitar I have works

994
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And I did upgrade to a guitar hero 3

995
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Because a while back I was having enough friends

996
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Over where we needed to have a bass

997
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
So I just bought a guitar hero 3 guitar

998
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Cause they were really cheap

999
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And now it's wireless, it works awesome

1000
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
They're fine

1001
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Hopefully now with mad cats

1002
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Working on the actual instruments

1003
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I'm hoping that they'll be a little bit better

1004
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
It's by mad cats

1005
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
And I loved it

1006
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
It's working really well

1007
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And please tell me my logic makes sense

1008
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
That there will be a

1009
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Game plus keyboard only pack

1010
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
They're seeing that there's gonna be all sorts of

1011
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Configurations

1012
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
If you have like one thing then you can get this

1013
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And they're gonna do all sorts of different bundles

1014
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Which will make it wonderfully confusing

1015
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Then I'm happy

1016
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Alright

1017
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
The other big story I wanted to talk about

1018
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
The armory

1019
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
For World of Warcraft

1020
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Is now available on the iPhone

1021
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I'm sorry not just the armory

1022
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
But the auction house

1023
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Oh cause I was gonna say I had the armory when I was playing

1024
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Sorry I mean the auction house is now built into the armory

1025
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
It's a beta test thing going on

1026
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
That they just opened up to all realms a couple days ago

1027
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
And you can now

1028
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Manage basic auctions

1029
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
From your iPhone

1030
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
But it's a beta test because the plan is

1031
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
This is going to be a pay feature

1032
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
They're gonna charge I think they were saying

1033
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
3, 4 bucks a month

1034
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I think it was 3 bucks a month

1035
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
For this feature after the beta

1036
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Test period is over which you guess is gonna be

1037
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
What about 4 to 6 weeks

1038
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
And I have to

1039
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Admit I go back and forth on this

1040
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Because when I first downloaded it and played with it

1041
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I was like this is clunky

1042
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
This is kind of stupid

1043
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
By the way it's not just I should say this

1044
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
It's not just your iPhone

1045
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
But you can do it on the web now if you go to the armory

1046
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Website and I imagine if there's an armory

1047
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
App for crack berries and androids

1048
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Or whatever other smart phones there are

1049
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
This feature is going to be built into this too

1050
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It's just a matter of time

1051
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
But when I was playing with this on my iPhone

1052
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Of course the day it came out I had to download it check it out

1053
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
But when I was playing with the feature I have to admit I was like

1054
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
This is kind of clunky

1055
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
This is not that great

1056
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I can't have auctioneer

1057
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
The add on I use to be able to undercut

1058
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Everybody else this way

1059
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
It's just not that great and I just kind of

1060
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Wrote it off and said I'm not really going to use this

1061
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
This is stupid whatever

1062
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
If this is how Blizzard wants to waste their time then so be it

1063
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
They'll be somebody that wants to use this

1064
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
But then

1065
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Damn it I found myself at work the other day

1066
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
On lunch thank you very much

1067
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And I like to get away from my desk

1068
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
At lunch because you know the last thing you want to do

1069
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
During your free time is be at your desk

1070
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Staring at your big pile of work to do

1071
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
So I was in a little break room during lunch

1072
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Eating my lunch and you know I'll kind of sit there

1073
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
And play on my phone maybe look at a game

1074
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Sure enough I go on the armory

1075
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And I start looking around

1076
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I managed to clear out my mailbox

1077
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
That was full of sold auctions

1078
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Relist some of the things that didn't sell

1079
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And just kind of manage all that

1080
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And clear out my inbox full of crap

1081
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
On my lunch and I was just like

1082
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Oh my god what am I doing

1083
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
What am I doing

1084
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I'm like playing World of Warcraft

1085
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Without being at home

1086
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
This is terrible

1087
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
That's bad it's bad

1088
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Anyhow

1089
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
It's not something

1090
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Extra that I can't already

1091
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Get in the game and therefore

1092
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I don't see worth paying three dollars

1093
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
A month is really something I want to

1094
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Do I mean I guess there's people

1095
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
That are more into the economics that want to do

1096
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
This stuff and if they want to pay for it then so

1097
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Be it whatever it's a feature I

1098
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Just will not be one of them because I don't think I

1099
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Should have that on my phone to be honest

1100
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I just don't think I should have that

1101
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
It's not a good thing to have

1102
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Now thankfully

1103
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
And I say it's kind of a double-edged sword

1104
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Because you know it's well

1105
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I'm glad

1106
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
There's not any additional

1107
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Game features like something extra

1108
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Because then I'd feel a little bit jilted

1109
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Because I still held to what I said

1110
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
A couple weeks ago on this show

1111
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
The minute Blizzard starts selling

1112
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Epics for money I'm out

1113
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I quit I'm deleting my account well

1114
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Resigning whatever that day

1115
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Notice how I can't say I'll delete my account

1116
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Because it's too much work but I will resign my

1117
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Warcraft membership that day it's done

1118
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Um

1119
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I just can't justify

1120
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
That and I really

1121
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Hope that's not where they're going I'm a little worried

1122
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Did you notice how all this started I mean maybe

1123
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
It's just me maybe I can I'm a conspiracy

1124
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Theorist and what have you call me whatever

1125
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Names you want but

1126
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Is it just me or did all this nickel and dime stuff

1127
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Start happening once Activision bought them

1128
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I don't think it's just you Rob

1129
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
This all kind of like

1130
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
The sparkle pony

1131
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
The money for faction transfers

1132
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And all these things

1133
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
And changing your genders and appearance and all this

1134
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
This all started happening when the

1135
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Activision guys came in they swear

1136
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Up and down they're not going to sell epics for money

1137
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I really really hope

1138
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
That's the case because it's

1139
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
It's like starting to push the boundaries a little bit

1140
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
You know what I mean but whatever

1141
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
If you want to pay the money and this is a good feature

1142
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
For you have fun but

1143
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I just you know I can't install auctioneer on my phone

1144
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
So whatever

1145
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And that was really it those

1146
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Are the two big stories I have some other little things

1147
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I can get to but low key I don't

1148
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Know what big news stories jumped out at you the past

1149
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Few days if there's anything you want to jump in at

1150
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Uh yeah one thing I want to

1151
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Talk about and it's absolutely

1152
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Annoying because I have to deal with this on a daily

1153
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Basis now is

1154
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
The what people are calling

1155
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Because I guess EA coined

1156
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
The phrase for their stuff

1157
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Project ten dollar

1158
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
And project ten dollar is different ways

1159
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
That EA can make money off of you basically

1160
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
And the one that's really

1161
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I guess the most recent way

1162
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
They've decided is that they're

1163
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Going to have one time

1164
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Codes with their um

1165
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Sports games starting off

1166
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
That allow you to play online

1167
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
If you buy the game used

1168
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
You have to pay ten dollars

1169
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
To be able to play

1170
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
The game we talked about this last week

1171
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I understand that but I'm getting into more stuff

1172
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Oh dear oh god alright

1173
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Okay so I'm sitting here going

1174
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Deja vu no no no

1175
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
There's more stuff we're gonna talk about here

1176
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Alright um so

1177
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Yeah thankfully they have the seven

1178
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Day trial and that's peachy

1179
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
And stuff for video rentals or game

1180
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Rental stores or whatever well that is cool

1181
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Um something that's cool

1182
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And they're the only ones doing that

1183
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Uh THQ on the other hand

1184
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Is now they by the way

1185
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Weren't gonna mention anything until the day

1186
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Of release for UFC

1187
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Um but it UFC

1188
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Had leaked out so unfortunately

1189
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
People found out of it or found out about it

1190
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
They're doing something similar except they're

1191
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Charging five dollars there is no trial

1192
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
So if you buy the game used you ought to play

1193
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
You know five dollars

1194
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
In order to be able to play online

1195
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Then there was another one

1196
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I found out about today

1197
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Another company which

1198
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I'm just shocked that they're

1199
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Jumping on board with this but

1200
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Um apparently Microsoft

1201
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
With Crackdown 2

1202
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Will be jumping aboard this um

1203
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
New trend and they will be having a

1204
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
One time fee wait wait wait

1205
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Wait wait why

1206
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Am I paying for Xbox Live?

1207
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Why?

1208
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
If this is if every publisher

1209
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Is gonna think because you know

1210
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Now this is just the little

1211
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Leak in the dam and it's all gonna come crumbling

1212
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Down after this why am I paying for

1213
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Xbox Live and another story that

1214
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
You know sorry if you're gonna get to this later but I know this is big

1215
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Playstation Network

1216
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Is just everybody's waiting for them to say

1217
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Something at E3 this year

1218
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
That there's going to be a Playstation Network Plus

1219
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Or what have you

1220
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Why am I paying for these services now?

1221
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
If this is the new way I'm gonna have to pay to play online

1222
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Please do not tell me I need both

1223
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Xbox Live and the code to play Crackdown

1224
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Cause that seems ridiculous

1225
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
You do um

1226
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Oh my god

1227
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
But it's only gonna affect you if you buy

1228
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Used but I still think it's fucked up

1229
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
That they're double dipping with them

1230
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
You know this stuff they think that they're entitled

1231
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
To a part of the used sales I'm sorry

1232
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Any other industry you're not

1233
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Entitled to used sales if I buy

1234
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
A used car I don't have to pay a hundred dollars

1235
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
To like Ford or something for buying

1236
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
My used car you've already made your fucking

1237
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Money and there's like

1238
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
You know EAs excuses

1239
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Oh well we're improving our online

1240
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Services and we're able to offer you

1241
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
More you know download

1242
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Content and stuff like that yeah more paid

1243
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Download content that I have to buy from you

1244
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
It's just

1245
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
It's awful

1246
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
You know to sit here and say I'm not

1247
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Gonna pay for online play would be hypocritical

1248
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Because I pay twelve dollars or no fourteen dollars

1249
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Whatever it is I don't even know

1250
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
To play wow you know

1251
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
That's fine I don't have a problem

1252
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Paying to play online I have a

1253
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Problem paying twice and I

1254
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Have a problem paying like all

1255
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
These different uncontrolled amounts now

1256
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Which okay maybe is a little bit

1257
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Hypocritical because of the MMOs

1258
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
But generally you know an MMO is gonna cost you

1259
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And between ten and fifteen

1260
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
But it's just now there's no

1261
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Fucking control anywhere with this

1262
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And it really bothers me

1263
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I need to hear from Microsoft

1264
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
At E3 why I should renew my

1265
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Xbox Live membership because at this point

1266
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I'm not going to

1267
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
And I've been a member for like six years now

1268
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And I'm hoping that there's some sort of misunderstanding

1269
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
But here's how it came about

1270
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
We had a head of a company

1271
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Might have been Blockbuster Chain

1272
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Or something like that

1273
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
They were asking about Crackdown 2

1274
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
They were saying well the first Crackdown game was

1275
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Online only and you know

1276
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I just wanted to make sure there's a single player aspect

1277
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
To this one and you know of course I was like

1278
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Well no the first game actually wasn't online only

1279
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
And you know

1280
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
There will be multiplayer and that kind of stuff

1281
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I highly doubt that

1282
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Microsoft would jump on board with

1283
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
What they're doing with EA and stuff

1284
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Because they're already making money off Live

1285
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Our buyer checked with Microsoft

1286
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
And they're like that's correct

1287
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
There is going to be

1288
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
There's a single player and online

1289
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
And there will be a one time code

1290
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Wait is this the internet or are you like

1291
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Breaking news here? No I'm breaking news

1292
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Oh shit

1293
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Huh

1294
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So casually too

1295
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I know right like

1296
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
He didn't say secret club or nothing this is just out there

1297
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Alright so I mean I'm hoping

1298
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
That there's a misunderstanding

1299
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Ok so yeah take with a grain of salt because

1300
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
We're not talking about hardcore

1301
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Game players with this right

1302
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
We're talking about business people who might be

1303
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Oopsie doopsieing the facts right

1304
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Yes and I'm thinking I'm hoping

1305
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
That the one time code thing is similar

1306
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
To what we've seen with some of the other games

1307
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Like Alan Wake and

1308
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
You know Gears of War 2

1309
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
And stuff like that where the one time code is

1310
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Download content it's free download content

1311
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
At launch something like that

1312
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I'm retracting my clause

1313
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I'm retracting my clause

1314
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
And hoping one of your coworkers is

1315
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Fucking up big time

1316
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
But if it isn't then that's basically

1317
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Going to open floodgates because

1318
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
If Microsoft's doing it then everybody's

1319
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Going to do it because they've basically

1320
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Been given permission to

1321
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
So I hope

1322
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
That's not the case but you know once again

1323
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
You know I blame a lot of these people

1324
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
That just don't stand up and

1325
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Complain about this stuff you know

1326
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
They're like oh that's no big deal because you know

1327
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I'm getting the game used or whatever

1328
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
And you know it's just a few extra dollars

1329
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Well you know what it's stuff like this

1330
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
See you feel it's okay

1331
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
With different things and now they're going to all

1332
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Start doing it and pretty soon it's just

1333
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Going to be something else what else are they going to take out

1334
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Of their game that they're going to charge you five dollars for

1335
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
You know

1336
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
It's just it's stupid

1337
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And they're not lowering the price of the game by five dollars

1338
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Of course not

1339
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I don't know

1340
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Yeah I worry about

1341
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
The precedent this might set

1342
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I understand why EA's

1343
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Doing this ten dollar thing and I think we talked about

1344
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
This last week and of course other companies

1345
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Are going to follow but you know my two biggest

1346
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Issues are A

1347
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
It's not going to stop there

1348
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Like Loki's saying and B

1349
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I don't want to have to pay for it twice

1350
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
They need to work it out where

1351
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
The one source is am I paying Microsoft

1352
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Or am I paying the publishers for this

1353
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Who's really hosting the servers

1354
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
And it's absolutely bullshit that they're saying that

1355
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
You know oh well it's because

1356
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
We're devl- like THQ's

1357
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Wonderful official

1358
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Statement about it THQ is delivering

1359
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
A truly unmatched online gaming

1360
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Experience for fans of UFC and across all

1361
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Oh shut up

1362
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Bullshit uh the main enhancement

1363
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Of UFC and disputed 2010's

1364
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Premium online content is a new

1365
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Fight camp mode in which players can assemble

1366
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Ranks up to forty people and train

1367
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Together the significant value add

1368
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Um value

1369
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Add to the game as uh

1370
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Players can uh continually

1371
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Improve their skills by training

1372
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
With friends and bringing teams from

1373
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
MMA specialists together you know what

1374
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Though you could have done that and included

1375
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
That with the game as it is so now you're

1376
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Just basically making an excuse because

1377
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
EA's doing it fuck you EA

1378
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
You know I you were on a good streak for

1379
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
A while there Activision was really making

1380
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
You know themselves look like shit

1381
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
We're all gonna do it but here

1382
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Here you go you know might as well

1383
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I'm sure Bobby Kotick's

1384
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Eyes are lighting up

1385
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Hey we can charge money for that

1386
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Uh do you have the story up on PSN Plus

1387
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Out of curiosity?

1388
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Uh yeah I do

1389
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Can you talk about that a little bit?

1390
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Yes so people are basically um

1391
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Saying that in fact actually the

1392
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Sony Computer Entertainment Europe

1393
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
President has been alluding that they're gonna

1394
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Be doing um upcoming paid

1395
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Uh Playstation Network subscriptions

1396
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
And uh

1397
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Of course they won't officially comment on it

1398
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
It says will Playstation Network

1399
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Become a paying service

1400
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Um Kazrai stated

1401
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
A few months ago that we were looking at

1402
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Premium services sit alongside the current

1403
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Free service

1404
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
And that um objective has not

1405
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Changed you'll learn more about it very soon

1406
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
So yes they are doing that

1407
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
And uh if I'm hearing it right

1408
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
They're saying we're not gonna charge you to play

1409
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Games online

1410
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I'm just trying

1411
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
To think what could this possibly be

1412
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Besides like core you know what I mean

1413
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Like I thought core was kind of their

1414
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Plus thing with the demos and the

1415
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Little things that come with that

1416
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Is that just an enhancement of that?

1417
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Um from what I remember the rumors

1418
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Have been saying that it's supposed to have

1419
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Exclusive access to

1420
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Cross game voice chat which

1421
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
You can do for free in Microsoft service

1422
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Um it's also

1423
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
They're gonna say that they're gonna be um

1424
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Including I guess some sort of

1425
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Cloud based saving system

1426
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Um I was reading

1427
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
That they're also supposed to be I think offering

1428
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Uh the ability to

1429
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Uh purchase

1430
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
A full title of a game first

1431
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Also they'll be able to play the first hour of download

1432
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Games for free Yeah that's interesting

1433
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I'd heard that one something about you can download

1434
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
The whole stinking game and play

1435
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Like an like every Blu-ray

1436
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Game will basically have a demo for an hour

1437
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Like I don't even know how that works

1438
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I don't know if that's wishful thinking or what

1439
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Am I I think I'd seen something

1440
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
This is probably another rumor fanboy

1441
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Wank or whatever but I'd seen something about

1442
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Playstation 1 games are just gonna be

1443
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Fucking play whatever you want

1444
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
They're gonna have a rotating

1445
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
A rotating list of PSP minis

1446
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
And Playstation 1 classics, exclusive

1447
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
In game download content, discounts

1448
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
To the Playstation store

1449
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Um

1450
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
So stuff like that

1451
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Maybe, maybe, I definitely

1452
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Want to hear more about it, I mean I

1453
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
We need to separate the fanboy wank from the reality

1454
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
But there's some interesting features in there

1455
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I can tell you right now when you pay him for this, I don't play on the Playstation

1456
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Never good enough But now, well now

1457
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I'm paying for Xbox Live

1458
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
And if this, if, if, if, if, big if

1459
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Capital I, capital F, if

1460
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
It is true that

1461
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Crackdown is gonna do the double dip thing

1462
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
And I don't hear

1463
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
From Microsoft what the hell I'm paying for anymore

1464
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Are you buying Crackdown

1465
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Used, that's the thing, if you're buying it

1466
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Used, then yeah it's double dipping

1467
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
If you're buying it new, you get the code

1468
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
You can play the thing

1469
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
So, I don't know

1470
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Still why am I paying for Xbox Live

1471
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
You know

1472
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
It's still, it's really

1473
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Kind of a lame thing to be doing because

1474
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
They're like saying, oh we deserve a portion of

1475
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Your used sales, and fuck you GameStop

1476
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
For being okay with this shit

1477
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I mean why, you're the biggest fucking

1478
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Company out there as far as retail

1479
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
You know they're not

1480
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
They're just, they have no choice

1481
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Nah, I'll get into more of that

1482
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Why I think they're doing

1483
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
What they're doing and why they're so gung ho

1484
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
About it anyway

1485
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Please, I want to hear that next, next time

1486
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Okay, so fuck them

1487
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Freeform tonight, I get what I want

1488
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Fuck them for being just okay about this

1489
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Wait, wait, wait, surely you have an opinion

1490
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
What do you think about this whole like

1491
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
PlayStation Network Plus

1492
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
And the Crackdown rumor

1493
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Do you have any thoughts

1494
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Not yet

1495
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Would you pay for a service where you could

1496
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Just go in and play any PlayStation 1 game

1497
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
You wanted

1498
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Depends

1499
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Depends on, I mean, if it was

1500
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Any game, any at all

1501
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Ever

1502
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Maybe

1503
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
But I don't need to because I have

1504
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
The vault

1505
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Okay

1506
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
So fuck them for going along with this and basically

1507
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Saying, oh yeah, we think it's a great idea

1508
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Yeah, you know why you think it's a great idea?

1509
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Because you're going to start selling download content soon

1510
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
And you're cashing in on that

1511
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
And basically Microsoft is

1512
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Saying, hey, you know what

1513
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
We're going to give you some back end

1514
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Rebates from this stuff

1515
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I don't know

1516
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
They may be changing their tune too

1517
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
When you look at some of these games

1518
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
That you basically sell them for 30 bucks

1519
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
They turn around and sell it for 55 dollars

1520
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
And then they're going to charge me 10 dollars

1521
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
On top of that to, you know

1522
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Say, for example, buy

1523
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
You know, multiplayer online

1524
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
You know, I'm paying basically 5 dollars

1525
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
More than the price of a new game

1526
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
So I'm going to be buying a new game

1527
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Obviously, if I'm really interested in that

1528
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Or I just won't play online

1529
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Thankfully

1530
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
A lot of the games, if I were to ever buy them used

1531
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I probably wouldn't be playing them online

1532
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I don't play a lot of stuff online

1533
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
I don't know

1534
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
It's really awful

1535
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Alright, get to the other thing

1536
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
About GameStop

1537
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
That's why I already went to that

1538
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Because they're going to be selling download content

1539
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
That was it

1540
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Sorry, I don't know if that's alright

1541
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
No, I had heard that

1542
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I had heard that rumor a little bit before

1543
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I just can't see

1544
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Walking into GameStop to get

1545
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
The download content

1546
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Being able to

1547
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Sample it in the store or whatever

1548
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
On their little kiosks

1549
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
It's just like Amazon

1550
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
How you can buy stuff off Amazon

1551
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
And get the codes and stuff like that

1552
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
But sometimes you want to go to the mall

1553
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I get that, but I don't know

1554
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
It's weird

1555
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Alright, what else

1556
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
How about another story

1557
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Then maybe we'll do release dates

1558
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Scratch the Ultimate DJ

1559
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Coming to iPhone, iPad

1560
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
And the PC

1561
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
They're still working on I guess the console versions

1562
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
As well according to Newmark

1563
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
But they are going to be out

1564
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
On those three platforms later this year

1565
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
It looks kind of weird though

1566
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I can't imagine playing this game on an iPad

1567
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Or something, very awkward

1568
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
They have turntables in the

1569
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Upper corners and then the five keys

1570
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
On the bottom and a crossfader

1571
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Just above those keys

1572
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Little complex

1573
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
The PC version though will actually have a controller for it

1574
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
So that will be interesting to see

1575
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Um

1576
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
But apparently

1577
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
You know, I guess

1578
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
It kind of sucks that the whole game was held up

1579
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Because of the whole lawsuit with

1580
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Activision and stuff

1581
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Which we never really heard what happened with that

1582
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Have they settled or what

1583
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Uh, whatever um

1584
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Happened to the console release

1585
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Is that still tied up in the lawsuit?

1586
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
It says the console versions

1587
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Are still in development

1588
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
And the PC version will use a special controller

1589
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Interesting

1590
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Yeah

1591
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Alright

1592
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Um, how about release dates?

1593
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Do you want to do some release dates?

1594
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
That sounds like fun. Sure. Alright

1595
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Do you have Europe ones? I do.

1596
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Jamie, why don't we start with you?

1597
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
We haven't heard your lovely voice in a few minutes

1598
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Okay

1599
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Yeah, go for it. Why not?

1600
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Alright, well then um

1601
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
It's really just a few things

1602
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
On the uh

1603
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Well, today, the 26th

1604
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Doom 2 for Xbox 360

1605
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
And Sing Star

1606
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Kent

1607
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Um, on Playstation 3

1608
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
28th Clash of the Titans and Darkness Within 2

1609
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
The Dark Lineage for PC

1610
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
No More Heroes 2 Desperate Struggle

1611
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Project Runway

1612
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Project One Way, or as I was saying

1613
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Pure Football

1614
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I thought it was called Project Catwalk over there

1615
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000

on the Wii

1643
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
That's exciting

1644
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Hope Crazy Tyra's in it

It's a strategy game on the DS

1648
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
That's nice, I guess

1649
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Bass Pro Shops

and the Wii, of course, getting a gun bundle

1654
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
because those people that own Wiis

1655
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
love guns

1656
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
And, um

1657
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
What else do we have here?

1658
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Call of Duty The War Collection

1659
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000

Xbox 360, I believe two, three in World at War

1662
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Uh

1663
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Let's see here, Prince of Persia The Forgotten

1664
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Sands on PC, I guess it was a few weeks late

1665
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
And that's

1666
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
that's basically it

1667
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Alright

1668
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Oh, Syphon Filter is Logan's

1669
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Shadow on Playstation 2

1670
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Yes, they're still making Playstation 2 games

1671
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Yes, they're still ports of

1672
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
PSP game, right?

1673
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Uh, going to Japan

1674
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
These releases are for June 3rd, we're not gonna be live again

1675
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
until June 6th, and I didn't see a lot for May

1676
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
So let's go to June 3rd releases for Japan, okay?

1677
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Some price reductions on Gears of War 2

1678
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
on the 360, Gundam Musou 2

1679
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
and Tales of Vesperia

1680
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Again, these are June 3rd releases I'm doing today

1681
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Uh, going to the

1682
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Playstation 3

1683
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Also, some more price reductions

1684
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Gundam Musou 2 and Katamari Damacy Tribute

1685
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
which I believe is, uh, Katamari

1686
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
What do they call it, Forever here?

1687
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I don't know that game and I can't remember

1688
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Uh, nothing really notable on the Wii

1689
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
This is kind of a dry period over there

1690
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I don't know if there's, you know, just not the season

1691
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
but it's mostly price reductions going on in Japan right now

1692
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Uh, same thing when you look at the PS2

1693
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Gundam Musou 2, Mobile Suit Gundam

1694
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
games going on sale

1695
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Uh, Nintendo DS

1696
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
another Pachinko game comes out

1697
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Kaiden Restaurant Ura menu, 100-sen

1698
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I don't know if that's like 100 different things

1699
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
on the menu or what, but that is coming out on the DS

1700
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
and then on the PSP

1701
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
100-sen

1702
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Is that the 100 classic books thing or?

1703
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
From Nintendo?

1704
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
No, because it's Kaiden Restaurant

1705
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
I don't think that's it

1706
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
No, there's like a little happy ghost on the cover

1707
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
It's a horror buffet

1708
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
with chilling blood curdling

1709
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
and creepy stories as dishes

1710
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Maybe it is, 100 tales for you to order

1711
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Choose the one that suits your mood

1712
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Vampires, ghosts, psychopath killers

1713
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
These characters fill the cartridge and all you have to do

1714
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
is order them to come out

1715
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
That sounds creepy

1716
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
It's like Silent Hill, but you read it

1717
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Uh, and then lastly

1718
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
on the PSP

1719
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Bleach, Heat the Soul 6

1720
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
gets a price reduction

1721
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
and probably the only new game I'm seeing on this whole list

1722
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Fairy Tale, Portable Guild

1723
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
is coming out this week from Konami

1724
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
on June 3rd, next week

1725
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
There you go, Japanese releases, there you have it

1726
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Uh, let's do a

1727
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
couple stories and then we'll get into

1728
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
other topics

1729
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
and we'll do the mailbag and all that other fun stuff too

1730
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Um, let me

1731
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I'll tackle a couple things here

1732
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
that I wanted to touch on

1733
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
that rolled over from what we were going to do on Sunday

1734
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Uh, Facebook and Zynga

1735
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Kiss... Zynga? Zynga?

1736
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Farmville, people

1737
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
They kissed and made up

1738
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
They had make-up sex

1739
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
and everything's better. Remember how they were threatened

1740
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Remember how Zynga, Zynga, Zynga

1741
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
was threatening to leave and like, we're going to take Farmville

1742
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
to their own damn website and I said, it'll never work

1743
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
It'll never work

1744
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Well, they came to their senses and they kissed and made up

1745
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
and they have committed to their

1746
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
long-term relationship

1747
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
and, um, meaning that I guess

1748
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
for years and years, they're going to

1749
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
basically, Zynga got a deal on that

1750
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Facebook credit thing, you know that's how it works out

1751
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Did you hear something else about them too?

1752
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
What's that? They're teaming up with Yahoo

1753
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
and they're going to have all their games on Yahoo as well

1754
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Um, they're going to be integrated into

1755
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
all their different web pages and stuff

1756
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
It's not the same. Yahoo already has

1757
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
a gaming portal

1758
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
A lot of the PopCap stuff and all that's on

1759
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
What were the games?

1760
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I actually used to play some games on there

1761
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
There's like a Scrabble-type game on there

1762
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
and the freaking whiteboard game

1763
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
It was like Pictionary

1764
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
and everybody drew dirty fucking pictures in that game

1765
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I can't remember the name of it

1766
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Yeah, I even played some of those games before

1767
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Whatever

1768
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
It's not Facebook

1769
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
If you can't collect the things and post

1770
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
them to your wall so you can prove

1771
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
that you have the biggest E-peen farm

1772
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
that you're farming all the E-peen in the land

1773
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
then

1774
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
The part where I

1775
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
banged my head against the wall

1776
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
was when I saw the Farmville cards for sale

1777
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
at like 7-11

1778
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
There was like little $10 Farmville cards, I was like

1779
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Oh my god. Did you see the Farmville ice cream?

1780
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Oh god, yeah, I heard something

1781
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
about that, like there's Farmville ice cream

1782
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
and Farmville...

1783
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Slurpees or something? Oh god

1784
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
No, do not want

1785
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
It's all fattening anyway

1786
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Ice cream is bad for you

1787
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
It makes you fat

1788
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
This is why you're fat

1789
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Alright, the website

1790
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
I wasn't saying that to you, Loki

1791
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
I thought this was an interesting story too

1792
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
that had to do with Epic

1793
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
and a comment they made this

1794
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
week, or this past week

1795
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
about piracy

1796
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
And they basically said that

1797
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
6 years ago, Epic was a PC

1798
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
company, but because

1799
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
of piracy, they went to

1800
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
consoles. We did one

1801
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
PS2 launch title and everything else was PC

1802
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
and now people are saying, why do you

1803
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
hate the PC? You're a console only company

1804
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
It's because the money's on

1805
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
consoles. That's from President

1806
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Mike Capps

1807
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
We still do PC, we still love

1808
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
the PC, but we already saw the impact of

1809
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
piracy. It killed a lot of great

1810
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
independent developers and completely

1811
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
changed our business model

1812
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
And then it goes on to talk a little bit about Steam

1813
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
and how Steam is essentially single-handedly

1814
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
really helping

1815
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
breathe life into PC gaming

1816
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
because piracy is just driving it bankrupt

1817
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Any thoughts on that, Loki?

1818
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Not that I'm insinuating that you're a pirate or anything

1819
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
but I know you usually have strong feelings about

1820
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
these types of topics

1821
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
There's piracy on any

1822
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
platform, regardless of PC

1823
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Xbox 360

1824
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
handhelds

1825
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
other consoles

1826
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
It's easier to do on PC

1827
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
so I guess that's

1828
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
true, but

1829
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
they're facing piracy everywhere

1830
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Is that really an excuse?

1831
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I think it's because they can charge more for their

1832
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
games, but

1833
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
whatever

1834
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Good for you

1835
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
You're a console developer

1836
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
now

1837
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Do you want me to pat you on the back or something?

1838
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Really?

1839
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Alright, one other story and then I'll let Loki take over

1840
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
for a little bit. BlizzCon tickets

1841
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
on sale

1842
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
June 2nd and June 5th

1843
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
$150 if you want to go

1844
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
and the con is in October

1845
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
October 22nd and 23rd

1846
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
You know what, DarkSakura? I think you and I

1847
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
should go down to Anaheim on October 22nd

1848
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
and 23rd and go to Disneyland

1849
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Fuck BlizzCon

1850
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
$150?

1851
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
No thank you. The 22nd and 23rd

1852
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
October

1853
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Except I'll be going to Alabama right after

1854
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
No, I'll be going to Alabama in November

1855
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I haven't done Disney with Jamie in a while

1856
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I've done Disney with other people, not Jamie

1857
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
It's been a little while

1858
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Here's my thing

1859
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
You might be thinking, what the hell, Rob?

1860
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
You're like the biggest wow addict on that show

1861
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
and why are you all hating on BlizzCon?

1862
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
A, they want

1863
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
$150

1864
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
What am I getting?

1865
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Cataclysm ought to be out by then

1866
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I mean, and if it's not

1867
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Damn, they're moving slow

1868
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
When is it again? October 22nd and 23rd

1869
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Well, they did release the last expansion

1870
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I want to say, or there was one of expansions

1871
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
that was released in November, so

1872
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Yeah, but Burning Crusade

1873
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
was out in like January

1874
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Well, then that's both after October

1875
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Look, it's World of Warcraft

1876
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Blizzard can release it

1877
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
whenever the fuck they want

1878
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
They could release it on Christmas Eve

1879
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
and nerds would be out in force to get there

1880
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
and be the first

1881
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
It doesn't matter, it's Blizzard

1882
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
They can do what they want

1883
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Look, I understand

1884
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
They got to recoup their costs

1885
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
They do some big stuff for this

1886
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Whatever, it's a pretty big effing deal

1887
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Am I going to get to be the first to play

1888
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
their new MMO?

1889
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Which is the rumor that they have a type of

1890
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
action-ish MMO that's in the works

1891
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I think the last rumor I heard

1892
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
was like a spy, espionage-y type of game

1893
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
might be their next MMO

1894
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
So, the agency?

1895
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
I don't know, I don't know

1896
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Rumor, huge fan wank rumor, don't quote me

1897
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
And I imagine Diablo 3

1898
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
is going to be playable

1899
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
but $150?

1900
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I'd rather ride Space Mountain

1901
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
three times in a row, what?

1902
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Dude, I'd just rather ride Space Mountain

1903
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
period, instead of like

1904
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
almost anything

1905
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Yep, so maybe

1906
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
we'll walk out front of the convention center

1907
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
like when we

1908
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
when we get bored

1909
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
we'll go walk over to the convention center

1910
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
I don't know how we're going to get bored at Disneyland

1911
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
but let's just hypothesize that every ride we want to go on

1912
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
is broken

1913
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
We'll go walk outside the convention center

1914
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
and look at the people and go

1915
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
So, how's it going?

1916
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Be like, hey y'all

1917
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
we're going to go on

1918
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
on the Matterhorn

1919
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
have fun waiting in line

1920
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
You might be able to get in as a press

1921
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
maybe

1922
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Is it bad to say

1923
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
that again, I would just

1924
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
the convention center

1925
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
let me put this in perspective, if you've never been to Anaheim

1926
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
the convention center is literally

1927
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
two blocks from Disneyland

1928
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
You can walk there, it's not that bad

1929
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I mean, with all the walking you do at Disneyland in a day

1930
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I don't get why you drive anyway

1931
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
You can

1932
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
especially California Adventure is like right there

1933
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
it's the first park you hit moving that direction

1934
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I know that

1935
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
You could

1936
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
literally walk to Disneyland

1937
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
and if I'm going to be that close, I've got to go

1938
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Maybe I should be doing a Disney podcast

1939
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
I don't know

1940
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I might feel a little more

1941
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
excited if I knew

1942
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
what games I was going to get to see

1943
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
but Starcraft 2 is out in July

1944
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
so maybe one of the future expansions

1945
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
but I'm not a Starcraft person anyway

1946
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I'm assuming it's all about Diablo 3

1947
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
and I guess

1948
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Cataclysm if it's still not out

1949
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
but it's got to be in beta by that point

1950
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
so people are already playing it

1951
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
maybe they'll announce another

1952
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Warcraft expansion

1953
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I mean, I don't know

1954
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
I could go off on a tangent about this

1955
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
maybe this isn't the right forum

1956
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
but I kind of think Cataclysm

1957
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
is less of an expansion

1958
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm very excited for Cataclysm

1959
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
it sounds like an exciting expansion

1960
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
but I think this is the

1961
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
closest you're going to get

1962
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
to WoW 2.0

1963
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
like, they're literally going back

1964
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
and upgrading the old game

1965
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
and they're using the Cataclysm as the retcon to do it

1966
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
so it's kind of like

1967
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
you're getting a little less of an upgrade

1968
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
with all this new stuff

1969
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
as you're just getting your old stuff enhanced

1970
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
to be competitive with newer releases

1971
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
does that make sense?

1972
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
so I wouldn't be surprised at all if another expansion

1973
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
comes pretty quickly afterwards

1974
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
the actual expansion

1975
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
where you go out to a new area

1976
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
and all this stuff

1977
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
and the additional five levels you didn't see in this first expansion

1978
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
but that's just

1979
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
you know, again

1980
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
fanboy wank

1981
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
are they raising it in level cap again?

1982
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
to 85, but not to 90

1983
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
which is, you know, fine, whatever

1984
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
but it just kind of makes me think

1985
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
that they already have another expansion

1986
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
planned that will take it to 90

1987
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I ultimately think WoW will stop at 100

1988
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
level 100 seems to be a nice

1989
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
even round number, but we'll see

1990
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
again

1991
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
fanboy wank, nothing more

1992
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Loki, what do you got for us?

1993
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
apparently

1994
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Edge is reporting

1995
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
that Project Natal

1996
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
will

1997
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
be out for

1998
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
$150

1999
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
and October 26

2000
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
give or take a few weeks

2001
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
didn't they say 100 bucks?

2002
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
oh no, that was a Playstation move

2003
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I

2004
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I don't think

2005
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
I would hope that they're smart enough

2006
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
not to put it out for that price

2007
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
that's how much a week costs, isn't it?

2008
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
yeah, and they're also

2009
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
basically

2010
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
the Xbox, well we know that

2011
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
a slim Xbox is coming out

2012
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
so perhaps

2013
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
they're going to be bundling with that

2014
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
and they're saying that they're going to be bundling

2015
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
with the new Xbox 360

2016
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
for $300

2017
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
I don't know

2018
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
it seems awfully high

2019
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
I know the technology is probably great

2020
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
and all, but

2021
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
they've got to have learned

2022
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
something from Sony, if you put it out

2023
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
at that kind of price point

2024
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
no one's going to pick it up

2025
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
you've got a few people picking it up, but no one's

2026
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
going to really jump on board with it because

2027
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I can get a Wii for that price

2028
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
but, if there's some

2029
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
kick my ass amazing, blow

2030
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
my hair back game

2031
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I might pay it

2032
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
a system is only as good as the games that are on it

2033
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
and the advantage of this

2034
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
over the Playstation Move

2035
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
is that you have to buy this

2036
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
and you're done

2037
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
there's no additional controllers you have to buy

2038
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
because you're basically the controller

2039
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
so it works up to

2040
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
do you think maybe that's their leverage?

2041
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
they're going to come out and say yes, it's $150

2042
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
but maybe they're going to do a price comparison

2043
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
and they'll say, if you want to buy

2044
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
the Wii for the whole family to play

2045
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
that actually costs you

2046
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
$150 plus what?

2047
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
$40 plus $40 plus $40, right?

2048
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
it's $40 plus

2049
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
actually because you're going to need nunchucks probably

2050
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
so $40 plus $20

2051
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
so $60, so a lot

2052
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
another $180 on top of that

2053
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
alright, so a lot, but they're going to say

2054
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
that's going to be their leverage, they're going to come out and say

2055
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
to buy the Xbox 360

2056
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Natal for the whole family

2057
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
$300 and it plays DVDs

2058
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
and it does Netflix out of the box

2059
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
and...

2060
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
all this stuff

2061
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I can see it

2062
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
again, if they have

2063
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
the game to justify it

2064
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
then

2065
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
they'll get away with it

2066
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
I think it needs to be sub $100

2067
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
but that's just me

2068
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
I would say they should

2069
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
put it out for $99.99

2070
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
you know what they should do?

2071
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
here's how they would sell a million copies

2072
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
you ready?

2073
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
no joke, you guys are going to hate me

2074
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
for this, all the people listening

2075
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
are going to cringe, but I'll tell you what

2076
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
they would sell a million copies of this

2077
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
you ready?

2078
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
the biggest loser video game

2079
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
the whole family can play

2080
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Project Natal

2081
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
so it's like

2082
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
a competitor to Wii Fit based off that

2083
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
TV show

2084
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
it would sell like crazy

2085
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
number one

2086
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
they put it out on the Wii

2087
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
pretty successful, because it came out last October

2088
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
and it sold pretty well

2089
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
it's already out

2090
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
and it was okay

2091
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
but it's not a system seller

2092
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
and yeah, I understand there's going to be

2093
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
all those kind of party games

2094
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
and fitness games and stuff like that

2095
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
and it's going to suck

2096
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
because there's going to be a ton of these crappy games

2097
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
coming up, but that doesn't really affect me

2098
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
too much because you don't have to buy them, obviously

2099
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
it's just really how much is the hardware going to cost

2100
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
that's really the thing I'm interested to find out

2101
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
but

2102
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
I will find out in a few weeks

2103
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
I'm sure they're going to say a price point

2104
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
they better say a price point

2105
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
E3 is kind of the time you lay it all out on the table

2106
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
for the holidays

2107
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I would expect

2108
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
you may not get specific dates

2109
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
but you're going to get

2110
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
I think you'll get prices and you're going to get a pretty good

2111
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
understanding of what that blow your hair back game is

2112
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
that they're putting behind

2113
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
whether it be Fable 3, the Milo thing

2114
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
and I said that

2115
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
a long time ago, it's going to be Gears 3

2116
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
I did, remember?

2117
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
I said, because they were hiding

2118
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
that game for the longest time

2119
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Gears is a pretty successful franchise

2120
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
and they just recently announced Gears 3

2121
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
and I think it's gotten a top support

2122
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Here's the other thing I'm thinking

2123
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
though, is that

2124
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
one of the

2125
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I guess conspiracy theories about it was

2126
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
that they were saying that they originally

2127
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
were remembering that it was going to be like 50 bucks

2128
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
for the game, for the actual thing

2129
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
and that now they're

2130
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
putting out this rumor that it's going to be $150

2131
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
so they can come back and put it out

2132
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
for $99, so those people are hoping

2133
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
that it was $50 aren't as

2134
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
disappointed, you know, whereas the people

2135
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
that thought it was going to be $150 are like, hey!

2136
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Now it's only $99, that's awesome!

2137
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
I don't know

2138
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
If they do come out with Natal support for Gears of War 3

2139
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
at E3, I want to be called

2140
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
from here on out, games analyst

2141
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Rob Roberts, games analyst

2142
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
If I'm wrong

2143
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
then I'm just some dickhead with a podcast

2144
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
which is what I've always been, nothing new

2145
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
You could be Robert Patrick, stupid Michael Patrick

2146
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
I want to go on record saying

2147
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Michael Patrick's a fucking douchebag

2148
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
and the reason why, because he just throws out guesses

2149
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
and yet people come

2150
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
That's what we do!

2151
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
I understand that, but people fucking run

2152
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
It's like if he comes out on his balcony

2153
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
to the game of press

2154
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
He's like the pope

2155
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Pretty much, he walks out

2156
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
writes his declaration

2157
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
and then goes back to

2158
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
I think this holiday season

2159
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
game consoles will do well

2160
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
and everybody reports it like

2161
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Oh my god, he said something!

2162
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Game consoles do well! Michael Patrick says so!

2163
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Oh my god!

2164
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Women fainting

2165
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
I just don't understand

2166
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
why people have

2167
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
This is why, other than complaining about him

2168
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
I will never mention any analyst

2169
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
I don't give a shit what an analyst

2170
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
thinks

2171
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Who cares? If that's your job, great

2172
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
I don't go asking meteorologists

2173
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
what the weather is going to be like

2174
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Because they're not always right

2175
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Would it be wrong for us to put

2176
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
in the description of our podcast

2177
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
three games analysts

2178
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
conquer the video game news

2179
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
every week

2180
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
You don't really have to have a degree to call yourself an analyst

2181
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
You just have to analyze the market

2182
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
We've been doing that for eight years

2183
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
That's on the job

2184
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
experience, right?

2185
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Dark Soccer, you know this

2186
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
legal stuff better than I do

2187
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Can I call myself a games analyst?

2188
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
You can call yourself whatever you want

2189
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
There you go

2190
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Orange Lounge Radio brought to you by three expert

2191
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
games analysts

2192
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
every week

2193
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
We've been analyzing the industry for eight years

2194
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
I will go as far as saying I'm the most

2195
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
expert analyst of them all

2196
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
That's my opinion

2197
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
I am the most expert analyst ever

2198
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
We are the most smartest

2199
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
games analysts out there

2200
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
The most expertest

2201
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
I'm the smartest of them all

2202
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Another news story

2203
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
please, before our egos

2204
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
inflate anymore

2205
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Michael Patrick's coming out on the balcony again

2206
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Oh my god!

2207
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
What's he saying?

2208
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Madden 11 will sell a lot

2209
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Oh my god!

2210
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Oh my god!

2211
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
It's the holy word

2212
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
God's awful

2213
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I just don't understand

2214
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
I hate me because it's true

2215
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
I hate you because it's true

2216
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Mama, what have you done now?

2217
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
That's right

2218
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Babysitting mama

2219
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
including your very own plush baby

2220
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
which you shove a remote down its throat

2221
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
in order to play

2222
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I kid you not

2223
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Really?

2224
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Yes, really, that's right

2225
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
It uses a plush baby in which you have

2226
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
tucked a Wii remote inside

2227
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
also using the nunchuck that is somehow hanging out

2228
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
of the plush baby somehow

2229
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
You play 40 mini games

2230
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
and the usual cookie mama style

2231
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
and representing feeding

2232
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
changing the baby, rocking it to sleep

2233
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
and six different

2234
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
virtual babies, each with their unique personalities

2235
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
So if the baby shits

2236
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
everywhere, then don't worry, mama will

2237
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
fix it

2238
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I don't know

2239
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Oh, you wanted a girl? Don't worry, mama

2240
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
will fix it

2241
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Don't worry, Dr. 90210

2242
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
will fix it I don't know

2243
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
It's weird, they did have a game

2244
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
come out like this

2245
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I think it's called

2246
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
My Baby There was a story

2247
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
It was on an Australian blog

2248
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
It was a Twitter topic one week

2249
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
I remember that Yes

2250
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
The character of the baby doll

2251
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Oh my gosh

2252
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
And it's also like that Wiiwa thing, remember the doll?

2253
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Yeah, I remember Wiiwa, did the Wiiwa ever come out?

2254
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Not yet

2255
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Oh, it's interesting

2256
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
But that's going to be weird that you have to have a baby doll

2257
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Not a damn person

2258
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
listening to this show is ever going to play that game

2259
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
It is cooking mama

2260
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Dark Sakura is the biggest

2261
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
fan of cooking mama, I know

2262
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Dark Sakura, babysitting mama, yes or no?

2263
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
I have a great idea No

2264
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
No, no, no, I have the greatest idea

2265
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
She's lip the baby, high heat

2266
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
She's a games analyst

2267
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Loki, and she says

2268
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
it's just not interesting

2269
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
We should have a contest with this game

2270
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
I'm telling you

2271
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
The contest is, and this is great, you're going to love this

2272
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
The contest is

2273
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
to photograph your best

2274
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
baby mama

2275
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
not baby mama, yeah

2276
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Baby mama? They should have done it

2277
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Is that the babysitting mama? Baby mama

2278
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Anyways, um

2279
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
No, the best babysitting mama

2280
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
baby analog you could create

2281
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
So, I mean, because basically

2282
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
the Wii remote has to go into something

2283
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
It doesn't necessarily have to be this

2284
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
doll, unless the doll is actually going to have

2285
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
a cord or something that's coming out of it

2286
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
that you can plug into your Wii remote

2287
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
and actually going to be its own controller

2288
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
but assuming that it's not, it's just going to be some stuff thing

2289
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
We should have people, like, take

2290
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
other stuff things or

2291
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
take your own baby out of whatever you have lying around your house

2292
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
and that might be funny

2293
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
and take pictures

2294
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
playing the game with it

2295
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
That's, that's

2296
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
the game that we need to have

2297
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
instead of, uh, uh

2298
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Cookie Mama or whatever, we need to have

2299
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
this one

2300
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Not who that is

2301
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Not who that is

2302
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Not who that is

2303
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Not who she is

2304
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Why is it always the same old thing?

2305
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Y'all knew that

2306
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
joke was coming, come on

2307
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
You knew it, you knew it, don't sigh

2308
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Don't sigh at me

2309
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
It's grown, Rob, it's grown because I knew

2310
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I got a quickie story of something you might hear

2311
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
at E3, or you might not, I don't know

2312
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
but apparently there are rumors going around

2313
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
rumors abounding that Final Fantasy 13

2314
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
versus may actually

2315
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
release on the Xbox 360

2316
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Apparently that's something Squeenix is looking

2317
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
into

2318
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Yeah, because Final Fantasy 13 did pretty well

2319
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
so where the money is, they will follow

2320
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
The answer will be at E3

2321
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Just dropping that little tidbit out there

2322
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Also one other little tidbit I wanted to drop

2323
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
just because I thought this was cool

2324
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Top Gun apparently is coming to Playstation Network

2325
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
There's, not, not the movie

2326
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
It's an actual Playstation 3

2327
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
game, and it'll be out on Mac and PC

2328
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
as well. It's gonna be an air combat game

2329
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
My hope is it's

2330
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
pretty much the 8-bit game, but with

2331
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
better graphics and new stuff, right?

2332
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
That's what we want, right? I had Top Gun on the NES

2333
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
That was a badass game

2334
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Good times

2335
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Loki, maybe one or two other stories, then we'll get

2336
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
to the, like, we need to do the tweets and the mailbag

2337
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
and all that other fun stuff

2338
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
GameStop, remember they were talking about

2339
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
throwing around the idea of some sort of

2340
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
new rewards program

2341
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Well, now it's being

2342
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
launched, I guess, their Power Up Rewards

2343
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
program, and there's

2344
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
two different things. You can get a card for free

2345
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Wait, first off, is this something that they

2346
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
will try to force on me with every purchase?

2347
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
It's basically the same thing

2348
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
You'll see it's not very different

2349
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
than what they're offering right now

2350
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
So they have a card that you

2351
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
can get for free, that, you know

2352
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
you don't really do anything for

2353
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Or a card that's the

2354
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Platinum card, I guess, for

2355
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
$14.99

2356
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Now, here's what you get

2357
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
with the different cards

2358
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
The standard black card

2359
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
for each dollar that you spend

2360
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
on new games and consoles

2361
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
you get 10 points

2362
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Points that you earn on pre-owned games

2363
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
you earn 20 points

2364
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
For your trades

2365
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
you get 20 points

2366
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
per dollar

2367
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
There's different birthday bonuses

2368
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
exclusive member offers

2369
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
and you get entered in

2370
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
each time you buy something

2371
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
to the Epic Rewards Giveaway

2372
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
and then online activation

2373
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
I guess

2374
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,000
250 points

2375
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
and if you establish a game library

2376
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
with them you get 250 points

2377
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Now, with the Platinum card

2378
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
you get basically all that

2379
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
plus

2380
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
in the Epic Rewards Giveaway thing

2381
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
you get two entries

2382
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
If you upgrade

2383
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
to the Pro tier you get

2384
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
an extra 250 points

2385
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
you get a

2386
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
one time buy two get one free

2387
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
offer for pre-owned games

2388
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
you get 10% off

2389
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
10% bonuses on points

2390
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
for your purchases

2391
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
10% on pre-owned purchase

2392
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
discount, I guess

2393
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
and 10% trade bonus

2394
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
and of course 12 issues of

2395
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Game Informer. So basically

2396
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
you get the same shit that you

2397
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
get now, except there's this point system

2398
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
that you can trade in for different things

2399
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
including

2400
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
like, I guess you can

2401
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
get

2402
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
gift cards

2403
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
free

2404
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
controllers, but the prices on them

2405
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
are just absolutely

2406
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
ridiculous

2407
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
like you have to basically spend

2408
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
$4,000 to get it

2409
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
My God, well the way

2410
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
and the sad thing is the extra $5

2411
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
I have to pay online to play it online

2412
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
now, it will not count towards this

2413
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Yeah, basically it says the rewards range from

2414
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
coupons for $5 to $10 off

2415
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
purchases, and that ranges from

2416
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
$4,000 to $8,000 points

2417
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
You can even get a free

2418
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Xbox 360 controller or eternal beach

2419
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
X11 headset for

2420
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
40,000 points

2421
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
40,000 points

2422
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
of course would equal about

2423
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
$4,000 spent on new games

2424
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
The eternal beach headset, it's like $100

2425
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I think, and the controllers are like

2426
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
$40, but

2427
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
$4,000, really?

2428
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
I mean, is that

2429
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
what you're expecting? Oh, you're gonna give me something for

2430
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
$40 after I spend $4,000?

2431
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Yeah, no

2432
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Yeah, no thanks. Do not want

2433
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
But hey, I mean if you're really dead

2434
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
set on spending your money at GameStop

2435
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
anyways, you might as well get the card because at least you're earning

2436
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
some points towards something, but I

2437
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
mean, I don't know

2438
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Just like I have this thing at Petco where I

2439
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
like buy cat food and stuff

2440
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
I'm supposed to like buy ten bags of cat food

2441
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
and I get one free, but it's within a certain

2442
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
time limit, and that never happens

2443
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
You might as well, because you're buying cat food

2444
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
No, it never happens

2445
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
It never happens, because I don't go through that much cat food

2446
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
You don't have enough cat food, you need more cats

2447
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
You need more cats

2448
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Alright, how about a quick story, then we'll go to Twitter

2449
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Alright

2450
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
UFC Undisputed

2451
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
2010 just was released

2452
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
yesterday, and

2453
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
unlockable is

2454
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Shaq

2455
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
That's right, you can play a little Shaq-Fu

2456
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
with Shaquille O'Neal

2457
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
And there's actually an easy code to

2458
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
do that

2459
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
On the Xbox 360, at the main menu

2460
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
you would hit down, up, left

2461
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
down, down, left, up, down, down

2462
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
left, X

2463
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Y, Y, X

2464
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
And then start

2465
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
On Playstation 3, it would be

2466
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
down, up, left, down, down

2467
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
left, up, down, down

2468
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
left, square, triangle, triangle, square

2469
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
start

2470
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
So, there you go

2471
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
There's your pro tip for the day

2472
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Right

2473
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Because I know everybody's just

2474
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
running out to put that code in

2475
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
right now

2476
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Let's do some Twitter topics, huh?

2477
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
We may not have a chat room tonight

2478
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
but we still have all you kids on Twitter

2479
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
The nice thing about doing this mid-week is

2480
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
we kind of get some different people, we catch different people

2481
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
because a lot of folks that don't listen to us live

2482
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
don't because they have other things going on

2483
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Sunday night, but we, looks like we got a little bit of a

2484
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
different crowd tonight

2485
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Uh, let's see

2486
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Rockman Rock

2487
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
sent us a tweet that says

2488
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
You thought the movie, The Human Centipede

2489
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
was a bad idea, just wait until

2490
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
you play the game

2491
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
That's right, there's a Human Centipede

2492
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
game that I got

2493
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
linked to here at Newgrounds

2494
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
that I could play, but

2495
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
I don't know if I want to

2496
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
because the Human Centipede

2497
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
is fucking gross

2498
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Yeah, but it's just Centipede

2499
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Let me just do this

2500
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
You are doctor, wait let me make this full screen here

2501
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Wait, let me turn off the Twitter music, we already heard the Twitter music tonight

2502
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Shut up, Santa

2503
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Alright, let's see, you are Dr. Heider, a brilliant German

2504
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
surgeon who's gone mad and surgically attached people

2505
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
ass to mouth to create the Human Centipede

2506
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Your parents are not pleased

2507
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
You must take your trusty rifle

2508
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
and put down these Human Centipedes

2509
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
with the bad dogs they are, whatever

2510
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Oh look, there's some

2511
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
little people with their mouths on their butts

2512
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
and there were ten points

2513
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Oh, that's not very gross, it's just digital

2514
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
It's like little, let's see, we can do mouse

2515
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
controls, mouse to move and left click

2516
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
to fire, oh this is just

2517
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Centipede

2518
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Ha, but the Centipede

2519
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
I get it, it's

2520
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
the Human Centipede

2521
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
The sounds are right

2522
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
This is totally a hacked version

2523
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Oh, there's a police officer

2524
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Oh, and I just shot him to bits, woohoo

2525
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Yay, I beat the first stage

2526
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
They change colors really stupidly

2527
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Yeah, that's a little dumb

2528
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Thanks anyway

2529
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
A little dumb

2530
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Uh, let's see

2531
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Blade 3, or Blade III

2532
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
How about

2533
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
It says Blade E!

2534
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Blade E!

2535
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
How about new Facebook privacy

2536
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Finally fixes games, annoying achievements

2537
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
being posted everywhere, did you hear about this?

2538
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Facebook's been in the news a lot and I guess they

2539
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
came out today, well they came out a couple days ago

2540
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
and I love

2541
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
the Facebook CEO because he's such

2542
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
a bro, like you know

2543
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
he's just, he looks like that total

2544
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
douchebag frat guy

2545
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
and like he's running this multi

2546
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
like what, billion dollar company

2547
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
and like he came out a couple days

2548
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
ago and literally said the corporate

2549
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
equivalent of, oh yeah my bad

2550
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
My bad on that one

2551
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
guys, sorry guys, my bad

2552
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
I forgot

2553
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
the keg, my bad

2554
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
That's pretty much what happened a couple days ago

2555
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Well they came out today and talked about the base

2556
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
so they're going to have to dumb down the privacy because

2557
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
too many people are

2558
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
you know, getting information used

2559
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
that they don't want to be used, the biggest problem

2560
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
is that

2561
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Facebook sets a lot of things to public by

2562
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
default without really giving you enough warning

2563
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
that's the biggest problem I always had

2564
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
with it, but it sounds like they're getting rid of that

2565
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
they're going to make it really easy to block applications

2566
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
which includes games

2567
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
so if you want to just block

2568
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
all the fucking Facebook apps

2569
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
and all the games, one click, done

2570
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
how about that Dark Soccer, you won't have to read any of that

2571
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
crap ever again, sweet

2572
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
at least that's what it's

2573
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
sounding like, we'll see, I guess we won't

2574
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
really know until later tonight when it's implemented

2575
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
maybe it's on there now, I don't know

2576
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Let's see, Sponge Twang wants to tell us

2577
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
that he is going to a medium sized

2578
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Anime Con, not a big one, not as small

2579
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
it's a medium sized

2580
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Anime Con in Boise, Idaho

2581
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Anime Oasis

2582
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Are there Oases in

2583
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Boise? I don't know

2584
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Oasis? Oasis

2585
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Are they in Boise?

2586
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Boise Oasis?

2587
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Anyway, saying

2588
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
check out the game room, Sponge Twang is going to check out

2589
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
the game room at Anime Oasis 2010

2590
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Yes, please, let us know

2591
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
We like the Anime Cons, but we like the gaming room

2592
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
reports, especially

2593
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Popo

2594
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
and Jer

2595
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
I know this guy, this is my buddy

2596
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Jer, not on Facebook, he's probably

2597
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
on Facebook too, but LiveJournal

2598
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Popo and Jer says, or it's Pop

2599
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
on Jer, I like Popo and Jer better

2600
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
although it might be Pop on Jer

2601
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
says Rob's Giggle sounds like

2602
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
the Riddler from the old Batman series

2603
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
just saying

2604
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Woo hoo hoo hoo!

2605
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
I don't know

2606
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
This is like Winnie the Pooh

2607
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
That's what he did, the old Riddler guy

2608
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
had this hoo hoo hoo thing he did

2609
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Yeah, it does sound like the Doughboy, shut up

2610
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
I hate you, stop judging me

2611
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
But I love the old Batman series

2612
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
That's, that's Batman

2613
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Screw this

2614
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Batman, that's right, that was

2615
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Batman was awesome

2616
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
GGBeat wants us to talk about

2617
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
how Jet Set Radio should go to

2618
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Xbox Live Arcade, it would be awesome

2619
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
I agree, it should go to Xbox Live

2620
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Arcade, it would be awesome, there should just be

2621
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
a new Jet Set game, period

2622
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
I thought it was coming to Xbox Live Arcade

2623
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Was that something that was

2624
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
spoiled on the partner net or whatever?

2625
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
I think it was one of the ones spoiled on the partner net

2626
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I can't remember, there is a lot

2627
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
of Dreamcast stuff coming to Xbox Live

2628
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Arcade at some point

2629
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
GGBeat, you need to cross your fingers, cross your toes

2630
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
hold your breath and hope for a miracle at E3

2631
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
I wonder if it'll be, yeah, it'll probably show it at E3

2632
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Maybe that'll be the game, you know how sometimes

2633
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
at E3 there's like a game that they go

2634
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
and it's out right now

2635
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Like I think, wasn't that Doom a couple years ago?

2636
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
They came out and said Doom will be available tonight

2637
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Right?

2638
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Ironically Doom 2, maybe, maybe

2639
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
GGBeat

2640
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Do it, do it, say a prayer

2641
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Light a candle

2642
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
A satanic chant, whatever it is you want to do

2643
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
I would guess Sonic Adventure over

2644
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
that, cause that's actually

2645
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
leaked out already

2646
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
MNZeba

2647
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
wants us to talk about

2648
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
this game Ryzom

2649
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
that is going open source

2650
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
pretty interesting when an MMO goes open source

2651
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Ooh, this is cute

2652
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
I've never seen this, is this

2653
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
I don't know if that's the same game or if that's the

2654
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
website, but there's this

2655
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
cute little background with like a little raccoon

2656
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
with a hard hat on and it's a cute little character

2657
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Well, whatever, anyhow Winchgate

2658
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
who is developing and publishing Ryzom

2659
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
they have announced that the Science Fantasy

2660
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
MMO Ryzom, it's open source

2661
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
That's kind of neat, an MMO going open source

2662
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
And you install Linux on

2663
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
the MMO

2664
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Probably, you can now use the

2665
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Ryzom core toolkit to make mods

2666
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
or enhancements to the existing code

2667
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
and even develop your own virtual world

2668
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Wow, that's pretty crazy

2669
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Who knows what might come of that, well thanks for the

2670
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
heads up, if we have any programmers

2671
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
that want to make the OLR MMO, go for it

2672
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
The SEG

2673
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
wants us to mention, how about the

2674
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Supreme Court hearings in October about the

2675
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
California video games law

2676
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Oh yeah, that's going to be a big deal

2677
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Whatever happens because of that, I mean it will be

2678
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
you know, the Supreme Court is

2679
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
supposed to be the end of the line, the highest court in the land

2680
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Hopefully it will be the last we hear on it

2681
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I just feel like

2682
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
I just don't know enough about the law

2683
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
I might be a games analyst

2684
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
But I don't really know enough to really

2685
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
say what's going to happen with this

2686
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Of course I want it to be struck down, of course

2687
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
I think the whole thing is a little silly

2688
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
But I have no legal

2689
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
basis to say it will or it won't

2690
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Do you guys have any thoughts?

2691
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
The California video games law that

2692
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
will, the California law will

2693
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
make it illegal to sell the game, right?

2694
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
I don't remember

2695
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
I don't remember the specifics

2696
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
about it, I have to look that

2697
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
up real quick, hold on

2698
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
What's the problem with doing a free form show?

2699
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
You haven't really researched your topics

2700
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
I think we're going to see

2701
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
I really

2702
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
I really don't see that it would

2703
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
fly

2704
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
I mean

2705
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Haven't they tried before?

2706
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Let's see, the California

2707
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
law imposes restrictions on and a

2708
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
labeling requirement with respect to

2709
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
the sale or rental of violent video

2710
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
games to minors. Several other states

2711
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
have passed similar laws and others may well be

2712
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
watching the case, the stakes

2713
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
extend beyond California. I remember

2714
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
this now because the verbiage

2715
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
in the law was very vague

2716
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
I remember this, it didn't really state

2717
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
how a game was

2718
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
It was a very

2719
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
gray area

2720
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
type of thing on what constituted a violent

2721
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
game and hopefully that's going to be the same thing

2722
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
that does the law in

2723
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
But we'll see

2724
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
I don't know

2725
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
We'll see what happens

2726
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Butch Kawa says

2727
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Might be a late one, no you got in just under the wire

2728
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
But the topic of heavy rain rights might

2729
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
go to a movie deal, trivializing

2730
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
the game or just trying to cash in

2731
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Heavy Rain movie, also

2732
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
I'll piggyback on this, I wanted to say I read

2733
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
this week a Mass Effect movie

2734
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
was sold to Legendary Pictures too

2735
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
What do you think? These games are pretty epic

2736
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
to begin with, I mean they're a little different

2737
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
than what we've seen before

2738
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Mass Effect would be kind of hard to condense down in the movie

2739
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Heavy Rain I could see it because it pretty much played out like a movie

2740
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
so why not?

2741
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
As long as the Jason scenes in it

2742
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Jason! Jason! Jason!

2743
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Jason!

2744
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Did you see the Press X

2745
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Jason music video today? I did actually

2746
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
That was awesome

2747
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Good stuff

2748
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
As long as they have the Jason scene in it, Bochi Kawa

2749
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
I'm cool

2750
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
But of course it's kind of

2751
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
I don't necessarily think it's trivializing

2752
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
the game, it's trying to cash in

2753
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
They realize that the game is done pretty

2754
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
well and will have a built in audience

2755
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
to go see it and they can probably make

2756
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
the movie relatively cheap

2757
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Speaking of which, I'm kind of curious to see how Prince of Persia

2758
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
does because we might actually have a

2759
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
mainstream video game movie

2760
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
that does well With no Persians in it

2761
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Imagine that I know

2762
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
It's so whitewashed

2763
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
I think I saw something on Yahoo where the headline

2764
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
was Prince of Persia called

2765
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Offensive

2766
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
They're talking the movie, not the game

2767
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
But it had to do, it was a story about that

2768
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
and the movie

2769
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
they can't call Avatar

2770
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
The Last Airbender because they're all whitewashed

2771
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Well if they can't find

2772
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Persian actors that are

2773
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
good enough for those parts

2774
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
I think that's a little silly

2775
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Jake Gyllenhaal of course

2776
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
is an A-list actor

2777
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
There's going to be lots of people

2778
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Maybe myself included

2779
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
who will want to see the movie

2780
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Don't mind me while I sound really racist here

2781
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Who would they get to play

2782
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
these Persian roles?

2783
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Would they have Kal Penn or something?

2784
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Playing the major lead in this?

2785
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Well I think

2786
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
you only need

2787
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
one or two A-list actors

2788
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
To take a step back

2789
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
I think that

2790
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
says something about our society in general

2791
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
where you've only got one or two guys

2792
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
to pick from

2793
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Was Aladdin Persian? I don't remember him being very

2794
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Persian in the cartoon

2795
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
He was pretty white

2796
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
I think that says something about society

2797
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
A much larger

2798
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
problem of society

2799
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
What? The Disney one?

2800
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
He looked

2801
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Middle Eastern?

2802
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Let me say this

2803
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
There's an Aladdin stage show at California

2804
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Now you are making me do a Disney podcast

2805
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
There's an Aladdin stage show at California

2806
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Adventure

2807
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
The last time I saw it

2808
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
the Jafar they had playing it

2809
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
was a black guy

2810
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
He's the best one I've ever seen

2811
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
He was great

2812
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
He was just enough camp

2813
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
that the little kids want to boo him

2814
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
but he was still really campy

2815
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
He was by far the best Jafar

2816
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
He happened to be a black guy

2817
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
I didn't get offended that he wasn't

2818
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
actually looked like the Sultan in the movie

2819
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
or was Persian

2820
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
He played the part well

2821
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
The problem is people complain about everything

2822
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
and that's really what it comes down to

2823
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
If you don't like it

2824
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
If that really gets your butt hurt

2825
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
don't go see the movie

2826
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Also

2827
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Can I just say this real quick

2828
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
They had a girl in the ensemble

2829
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
in a wheelchair

2830
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
A power wheelchair in the ensemble

2831
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
She was actually pretty fierce

2832
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
I got to say

2833
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
They were kind of smart with how they integrated her into all the dance numbers

2834
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
and everything

2835
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
During a whole new world where the ensemble will come out

2836
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
and they're carrying famous buildings

2837
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
I shit you not

2838
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
She had pyramids tied to the back of her wheelchair

2839
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
and she'd ride along with everybody else

2840
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
She's singing

2841
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
It was great to see

2842
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
You know why I like to see that?

2843
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Because there's a lot of handicapped kids that go to Disneyland

2844
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
and for them to be able to see that

2845
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
that if they want to do that, they can

2846
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
I think that's great, personally

2847
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Boy, we're getting into too...

2848
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
These topics are too deep

2849
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
We need dick and fart jokes, help

2850
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
We're done with Twitter, twitter.com

2851
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
I burped, did I help?

2852
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Well, there's a game coming out

2853
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
called Warriors of Alaysia

2854
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
and it's basically

2855
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
bikini-clad women fighting each other

2856
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Mortal Kombat style

2857
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
And they have a lot of bikini-clad women that are

2858
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
promoting it as well

2859
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
So that's kind of interesting

2860
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Boobs!

2861
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Exactly. Speaking of boobs

2862
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
If we have any listeners that are

2863
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
going to Phantom this weekend

2864
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
There's actually one of my friends

2865
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
from high school

2866
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
She's an amazing artist, worked for EA

2867
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Did a lot of the artwork for My Sims

2868
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
That franchise

2869
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
And draws chicks with big boobs

2870
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Very, very big boobs

2871
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
She does, and she has

2872
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
a comic that she works on

2873
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Her name is Genevieve, by the way

2874
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
She works on, and I believe

2875
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
her

2876
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
I'm trying to remember who

2877
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
her other artist is that she works with

2878
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
I want to say his name is Robert

2879
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Forgive me if I got that wrong

2880
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Anyways, they have a comic that they work on

2881
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Called Islands in the Sky

2882
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
And it's basically this big boob chick

2883
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
That goes around stealing people's food

2884
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
In these different islands in the sky

2885
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
And putting them in her boobs, apparently

2886
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Pretty much, but

2887
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
As kind of an exclusive thing at Phantom

2888
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
They're going to be selling

2889
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
And I don't know how the hell they got these made

2890
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
But it's just awesome

2891
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
They're going to be selling boob

2892
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Mouse pads

2893
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
And they have one that's semi-tame

2894
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
But still, she's got big boobs

2895
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
But you can actually purchase those

2896
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
She'll be on Artist Row

2897
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
I believe booth 300 and 301

2898
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
They're going to be doing

2899
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
So, unrealistically proportioned women

2900
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Is your thing, then Islands in the Sky

2901
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Exactly, so say hi to Genevieve

2902
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
She's awesome

2903
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Tell them OLR sent you!

2904
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
And recommended the boobies

2905
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
That's right

2906
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Not much has changed

2907
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
No, but she's cool

2908
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
These boobs were endorsed by Loki

2909
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Yes

2910
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
How about, um, I don't know

2911
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Do we want to do, like, Mailbag?

2912
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Do we have Mailbag ready to go? Do we have some emails we can read tonight?

2913
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
I didn't pull up Mailbag

2914
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Can we, well, let's

2915
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
On a quick story, if you want to pull up Mailbag

2916
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Yeah, pull up Mailbag while we do another quick story

2917
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
So, that game, Super Mario Crossover

2918
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Was pretty awesome, the Flash game where you can play

2919
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Super Mario Brothers with a bunch of different characters

2920
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Well, one of the characters that they talked about

2921
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Adding in there that they never really

2922
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Got a chance to do that was

2923
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Hayabasa, or Hayabusa

2924
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
And, um, they have now

2925
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Added him in there, or at least they're going to very soon

2926
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
They have a video teasing it

2927
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
And he has, of course, his

2928
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Wall climb moves and he throws ninja stars

2929
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
And whatnot, so, that's awesome

2930
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Can't wait to play that

2931
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Version of it

2932
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
And that's that game you really love to play that has, like, the Contra characters

2933
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Oh yeah

2934
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Sweet

2935
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Alright, Dark Sakura is prepared to dive into the Mailbag

2936
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Headfirst, our Mailbag, of course

2937
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

2938
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
And she's going to dive in headfirst

2939
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
And pick out an email to read

2940
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Or two, or three, or fifteen, depending on how many people

2941
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Three, email us this week

2942
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Dark Sakura, go to it, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

2943
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
If you would like to participate, please do

2944
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Hey guys, Sturlock here

2945
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
I've tried calling about this a couple of times

2946
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
That I've been unable to get through

2947
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
I was surprised that Loki actually brought the closure

2948
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Of Nintendo Powerline up as

2949
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
As I've known this for a while

2950
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Excuse me, I wanted to clarify

2951
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
What the Powerline actually is

2952
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
It's a line you can call to get walkthroughs and tips for games

2953
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Instead of talking to live individuals

2954
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
The walkthroughs are automated with a menu interface

2955
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Which makes it quite easy to find the specific information

2956
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
You're looking for on a particular game

2957
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
I have very fond memories of running up

2958
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
My parents' phone bill back in the day

2959
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Although this is only a regular

2960
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Long distance call, not even a 900 number

2961
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
The thing I always liked about the Powerline

2962
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Is that they will frequently have music from the games in question

2963
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
In the background over the person giving the information

2964
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
That's cute

2965
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
By the way, I do want to point out

2966
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
That may be how it is around these days

2967
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
When I was in high school

2968
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
You talked to a person

2969
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Yeah, go watch The Wizard

2970
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
There's actually a scene where they call

2971
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
The game counselor, it's pretty epic

2972
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Yeah, I just sat in, you know

2973
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
And jawed with some guy one day about like

2974
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Weird Zelda stuff and

2975
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Prototype games one time

2976
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Because I was bored, I ran up the phone bill

2977
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
I get what he's saying though, he's telling us that it's different

2978
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Because I think we were reminiscing about that on last week's show

2979
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Trying to tell us it's a little bit different now than it was then

2980
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Since I have a lot of memories of this line

2981
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
I've actually been working to record every last game

2982
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
From it I can

2983
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
I know I'm probably the only person on the faceless planet

2984
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Who actually gives a fuck about this

2985
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
But it's something I'm passionate about

2986
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
I see it as part of my childhood in a way

2987
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
And I don't want to see it go away entirely

2988
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
It's a neat little artifact of the 90s

2989
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
And if nothing else, I'm sorry, if nothing else

2990
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Sorry for the rambling nature of this message

2991
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
But this is something I feel quite strongly about

2992
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
You might actually be able to petition Nintendo

2993
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
To actually put out DVDs of their

2994
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Ivor or something

2995
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
If you feel strongly about it, go for it

2996
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
I think that's actually kind of cool

2997
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
If he's recording stuff

2998
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
I don't even know if you have this ability at all

2999
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
But if you've been recording it and you can make MP3s of it

3000
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Send us one, I'll play one on the show

3001
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
I think it'll be kind of fun to listen to

3002
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Send us one that you think is really cool

3003
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
This one is from Doug

3004
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Or Dragonboy

3005
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Hi Doug Dragonboy

3006
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
I was wondering if any of you were playing any PS1 games

3007
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
On the PSPs

3008
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
I have 23 PS1 games now on my

3009
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
He wrote no, it's supposed to be now

3010
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
On my PSP Go

3011
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
And I love playing them

3012
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
As many PS1 games are far better than PSP games

3013
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
That are available

3014
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Keep up the great work on the podcast

3015
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
I'm a loyal listener and your podcast is without a doubt

3016
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
My favorite Dragonboy

3017
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Aw, thank you

3018
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
PS1 games on the PSP?

3019
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Did they ever do Jumping Flash?

3020
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Yes they did

3021
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
What about Jumping Flash if you don't have it?

3022
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Um Jammalammy is a great music game

3023
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
A lot of fun

3024
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
And of course that's one I play personally

3025
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Suikoden, I have the original

3026
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
And I've played that on the PSP before, that's fun

3027
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
And Final Fantasy 7

3028
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
You might as well go, you know what

3029
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
All the fanboy wank is there for a reason

3030
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Final Fantasy 7 is pretty good

3031
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Not the best Final Fantasy game they ever made

3032
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
But pretty darn good

3033
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Okay, this last one

3034
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
From Rababa

3035
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Oh, never mind

3036
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
I think it's sort of a continuation from an old email

3037
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
The subject line is iPad mini

3038
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Maybe iPad nano

3039
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
I only suggested that on the last OLR episode

3040
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Because the leaked iPhone images

3041
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Are designed to match the iPad

3042
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
If it played iPad apps

3043
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
It would be a way around the contract

3044
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
With AT&T, the iPad itself

3045
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Seems like it would qualify

3046
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
As a non-phone since it has

3047
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
No phone capability

3048
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Well isn't that what the iPod touches for?

3049
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
I'm pretty sure the AT&T network

3050
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Is used for the iPad for access to the app store

3051
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
By the way, I have an iPad

3052
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
And a netbook and the iPad is just better

3053
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Let's keep an eye out for an Apple branded

3054
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Phone for Verizon

3055
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
I still want an iPad

3056
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
I love my netbook though

3057
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Now the rumor is Apple is going to team up with Sprint

3058
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Let's hope not

3059
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Well that's done

3060
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Alright, if you really want to do that

3061
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Alright

3062
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Well thanks for the emails guys

3063
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
You can go to our website

3064
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
If you want to send us some more

3065
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Couple more news stories

3066
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Do we have any more? We done?

3067
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
We still have the classic game of the week

3068
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
We'll get to that in a minute

3069
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Any more news stories for us, Loki?

3070
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Not really, don't have anything

3071
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
I got one

3072
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
I'll do a couple quick ones

3073
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
I have a couple here that I can do

3074
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Classic game of the week

3075
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Dragon Quest 9, Sentinels of the Starry Skies

3076
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
July 11th, finally

3077
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Ready for US consumption

3078
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
4.2 million sold in Japan

3079
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
And it's finally making its way over here

3080
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Dragon Quest 9, Sentinels of the Starry Skies

3081
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
And the Nintendo DS

3082
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
That's too bad I knew about that weeks ago

3083
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
I should have mentioned something

3084
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
I always see this stuff and I'm like

3085
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Damn you, Loki

3086
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
It's like not news for me

3087
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
The crackdown thing is really interesting

3088
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
But again, I hope they're wrong

3089
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
I really do hope they're wrong

3090
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Other one, I think this is really interesting

3091
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
The NPD report

3092
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
The top selling accessory

3093
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
On the Microsoft Xbox 360

3094
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
You know what the best selling accessory is for the 360?

3095
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
The 1600 point Microsoft

3096
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Xbox Live card

3097
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Even though you can buy them with the touch of a button

3098
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
The 1600 point card was the best selling accessory

3099
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
I'm surprised live subscriptions aren't

3100
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
And you know why?

3101
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Because if you've ever tried to buy a live subscription

3102
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
With a credit card on

3103
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Their service

3104
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
You're stuck in the stupid auto

3105
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Renewing shit

3106
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
And it sucks

3107
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Getting out of it is near impossible

3108
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
So I tell you

3109
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Man, if you

3110
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Really are limited on money

3111
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Spend the time to go out and buy

3112
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
One of those memberships

3113
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
It's a lot better to buy it at the store

3114
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
And have it dumped down

3115
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
To silver again

3116
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Than having it auto renew all the time

3117
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
And you can't get rid of it

3118
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
It's awful

3119
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Alright, let's go to the

3120
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Classic game of the week

3121
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
You ready for this Dark Sakura?

3122
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
May as well be

3123
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Alright, every week on the program

3124
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Oh my gosh, you know it's free form tonight

3125
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Because everything's broken, I don't have the

3126
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
I don't have the song, where's the song?

3127
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
There it is

3128
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Classic game of the week, every week Dark Sakura

3129
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Goes into the vault and picks out a classic game

3130
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
She says, hey, you kids

3131
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Get off my lawn

3132
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
And go play this game

3133
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
A classic game that we all

3134
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Grew up on

3135
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
I don't know, what constitutes a classic game?

3136
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Um, it's old

3137
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
What is this week's classic game of the week Dark Sakura?

3138
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Keyboard Mania

3139
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
How appropriate

3140
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
I know a lot of listeners of the show will be big on this one

3141
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Keyboard Mania is your classic game of the week

3142
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Want to hear someone butcher a song on Keyboard Mania?

3143
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Yeah, let's do that first

3144
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
This is a song called Pink Rose

3145
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
That originated in Keyboard Mania

3146
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
I'm gonna butcher it here a little bit

3147
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
It's not terrible

3148
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
It's a B-

3149
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
And it's not

3150
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
It's not an easy song to play

3151
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
No

3152
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
This person's doing doubles

3153
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Let's go to the real song here

3154
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Which, by the way, this is one of my favorite songs

3155
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Totally in this game

3156
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Um

3157
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
But actually I really like it better in pop music

3158
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
But, anyway

3159
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
So, um, Keyboard Mania

3160
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Is one of the Bimani games

3161
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
It has two, um, 24 key keyboards

3162
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
And, um

3163
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
The different notes that come down

3164
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Correspond

3165
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
To a different key on the keyboard

3166
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Um

3167
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
And, um

3168
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Also there's a- you know how BeatMania

3169
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Had, uh, the BM-98 simulator?

3170
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Um, there's one called

3171
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Doremi

3172
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
For a Keyboard Mania simulator for me

3173
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
I get it, doe, a deer, a female deer

3174
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Yeah

3175
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Anyway, um, so we got out Keyboard Mania

3176
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Then, uh, Keyboard Heaven

3177
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Which is the Korean version

3178
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Of Keyboard Mania

3179
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
And then Keyboard Mania 2nd Mix

3180
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Um, 3rd Mix

3181
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Uh, actually, uh, linked

3182
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
To Drum Mania 4th, Guitar Freaks 5th

3183
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Um, and

3184
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Drum Mania 5th, Guitar Freaks

3185
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
6th for certain songs

3186
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Cause we used to have- Those were epic days

3187
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
At Roseville Golf Land. One of the few arcades

3188
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Anywhere that had that. There's pictures of all of us

3189
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Amazing. Playing

3190
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Like, Jamie would do drums, I would do

3191
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Keyboard, and, you know, like

3192
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Bradley would do guitar

3193
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
I don't know if Loki was playing with us then, but

3194
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
I was playing guitar with the other side of the keyboard

3195
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Good times. You'd always pick keyboard

3196
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Can I play one of my favorite songs in Keyboard Mania?

3197
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
This kinda sounds like a song

3198
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
This is not Henry Henry

3199
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
No, it's not. This is like a song that would be like an act-raiser or something

3200
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
This is Kyu No Tame No Sonata

3201
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:46,000
This-

3202
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
This sounds like the overworld music

3203
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
An act-raiser to me

3204
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
I think it is

3205
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Like, remember when you were managing your people?

3206
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
This is one of my favorite songs

3207
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
In Keyboard Mania

3208
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
We'll play a little bit of this, then I'll do the

3209
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Castle Baby song

3210
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Yeah, the Akumajou

3211
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Uh, medley

3212
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Okay, but anyway, um, well

3213
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
There's actually, um

3214
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Three songs, though, that were big

3215
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Carryover songs into other Bimani

3216
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Games. Um, that was

3217
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Frozen Ray

3218
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Pink Rose, which we played earlier, and the least

3219
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Hundred Seconds, which we should actually

3220
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Play that too, Rob

3221
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
I love Frozen Ray, though

3222
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Um, but, uh

3223
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Keyboard Mania, um, had two home versions

3224
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
There was Keyboard Mania, and then

3225
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Keyboard Mania 2, which was the second and third

3226
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Mix

3227
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Um, and it had, uh

3228
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
You know, basically the arcade-style

3229
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Controller. I don't see

3230
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Any other way that you could've

3231
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Had, like, the full arcade-style

3232
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Controller, like, you know, they brought out for

3233
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
2DX and

3234
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
DDR and all that

3235
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
But the other way is that if you had, um

3236
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
The Windows PC version

3237
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
You get a Yamaha EZ250i

3238
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Keyboard, um, to play it

3239
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Which one you've got there?

3240
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Oh, yeah

3241
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Someone's butchering it a little bit

3242
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
They're doing pretty good. This is about as good as

3243
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
I would do, probably

3244
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
And I love how, on the interface

3245
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
When it has the little

3246
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Background music up, you know, screen up there

3247
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
From the arcade

3248
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
The wheel thing always weirded me out, though

3249
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Like, what the hell was that? It's your scratch!

3250
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Yeah, but it was a little dumb

3251
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
It was a little dumb

3252
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
I'm kinda glad that, hopefully, uh

3253
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
If we get this keyboard thing in, um

3254
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Rock Bandit probably won't have that

3255
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
But, I mean, really, there's not much else to say

3256
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
About it other than what I've said, you know

3257
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
It was fairly short-lived

3258
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
For the Bimani series, and, you know

3259
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
It's sad

3260
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
That it didn't do better, you know

3261
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
It was really difficult, though

3262
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
This is one of the few songs

3263
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Cause, like, when you did that multi-session

3264
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
There was probably, like, six songs you could play

3265
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
This is one of them, at least 100 seconds

3266
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
I love this game

3267
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
This was my favorite Bimani game

3268
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Oh, okay

3269
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Because you could also do, um

3270
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
I think there was also a version of Ride on Time

3271
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
I'm pretty sure there was

3272
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Good stuff

3273
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Yeah, but

3274
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
The other big song, though, of course, was Frozen Ray

3275
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Which we got for other versions, too

3276
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Um, but yeah

3277
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
This

3278
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
I don't remember, though

3279
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
And I want to say

3280
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
It didn't have it

3281
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Cause keep in mind, I've got

3282
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Drum Mania IV, Guitar Freaks V

3283
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
For home

3284
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
And Keyboard Mania

3285
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
And I don't think it had Super Session mode

3286
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
For the three

3287
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
No, not on the home version

3288
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
So, which made me very sad

3289
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Because I was all like

3290
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Yeah, Super Session, and no

3291
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
The 2-3 mix came out

3292
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Way later, too

3293
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
And people were pretty convinced

3294
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
The others were never coming out

3295
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
I think I had the first time, and then I borrowed yours

3296
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
For the longest time

3297
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
We basically, I think for a while, had Communal Bimani

3298
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Yeah, pretty much

3299
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Because one of us would make sure that we bought a version that no one else had

3300
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
And then we would play the hell out of it

3301
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
And then switch it out with somebody else

3302
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
So we had our Communal Bimani

3303
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Going on, and we always made sure we knew

3304
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Who we had our damn game

3305
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Good times

3306
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
A good Bimani classic

3307
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Find me a Frozen Ray, Rob

3308
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
You want Frozen Ray?

3309
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
We'll close out with a little bit of Frozen Ray here

3310
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
For the Classic Game of the Week

3311
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
And, uh, let's see

3312
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Here we go

3313
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Here's from the PS2

3314
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
Somebody's selecting on the mini list

3315
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
There we go

3316
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Intruder, good job

3317
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Jinx

3318
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:10,000
That part's really easy to mess up on

3319
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
What I really liked about this game

3320
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Is that if you, like, could memorize

3321
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
The note patterns

3322
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
You could play the song on a real piano

3323
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
It was the one Bimani game

3324
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
It was closest to a real simulator

3325
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Was the closest thing to the actual

3326
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Instrument than anything else

3327
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
It really was, you know

3328
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
I'll tell you one thing that had to help me

3329
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
When learning how to play it

3330
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Is that, um, it was easier to play it in the arcade

3331
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Than it was at home

3332
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Because your keyboard lined up

3333
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
With the keys and didn't move

3334
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Um, but

3335
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
I would always have to find something

3336
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
To hold my, um, controller stationary

3337
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
And put it right the hell in front of my

3338
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Of the TV for me to be able to really get it

3339
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
You know, cause otherwise

3340
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
It was, it was

3341
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Way, it was way too much coordination

3342
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
I think, I mean, 2DX is definitely

3343
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Easier in terms of building your

3344
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Hand-eye coordination, and I was never a keyboard player

3345
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
So

3346
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
See, when I was like 5 years old

3347
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
I started taking organ lessons

3348
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Yeah, the double decker

3349
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Church organ, you know

3350
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Completely off topic

3351
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
I found an accordion at the thrift store today

3352
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Good stuff, did you buy it?

3353
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
I wanted to, it's 85 bucks

3354
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
I bought a Fendi purse for 6 bucks though

3355
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Anyway, um, that's my thing lately

3356
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Y'all, by the way, is going to thrift stores

3357
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
And buying designer stuff

3358
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
You get good stuff there, no lie, no joke

3359
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Anyway, um, so the game of the week

3360
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Is keyboard mania

3361
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
If none of you have played it, you poor deprived people

3362
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Go check it out

3363
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
If you can, good luck

3364
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
I'm sure the keytar thing will be pretty cool

3365
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
But it's never going to be as cool as keyboard mania

3366
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Keytar freaks?

3367
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Uh, keyboard mania, still I think at Milpitas Golfland

3368
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
At least, I think, last time I was there

3369
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Might still be there, I don't know

3370
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
It's been a little while

3371
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Ours has been gone, for ages

3372
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Alright, uh, one more segment

3373
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
That we have to do on this show every week

3374
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
It's just mandatory for no other reason

3375
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
And sometimes we have to vent a little bit

3376
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
GRRR, FUs of the week, Darcy

3377
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:24,000
GRRR, FU to, um, the place which shall not be named

3378
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Loki?

3379
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Um, FU to the fact that, uh, this weather changing

3380
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:36,000
That's like rain, sun, rain, sun, rain, sun

3381
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Is really fucking with my allergies

3382
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Is this really giving you a headache?

3383
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Uh, yeah, I've been getting headaches the last few days

3384
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
I just took some time a little bit before I came over here

3385
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
My throat now is really dry and scratchy

3386
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
But I think that's from yelling a lot during the show

3387
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
You know, imitating Michael Patrick really

3388
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Takes a toll on you

3389
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Oh, the holy name, ah

3390
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Alright, uh, my FU goes to myself

3391
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Actually, most things in life are pretty good right now

3392
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
I can't complain

3393
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Uh, FU to myself, though, because, like, every time I start

3394
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Like a pattern of good eating habits

3395
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Like, I guess you could say a diet, if you will

3396
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
I break it within, like, a week and a half

3397
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
There's always something that breaks me

3398
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
And this time it was vacation

3399
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
You should go off

3400
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Oh god, no

3401
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Like, I know my limits

3402
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Props to you for having that sort of discipline

3403
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
For a fact, I could do it

3404
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
By the way, I'm not 100% raw, you know

3405
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
And I had a beer the other day, and it totally

3406
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Oh my god

3407
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
And it totally made my face break out

3408
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
So, I have no more beer

3409
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
I've lost 16 pounds, Rob

3410
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
For you? Good for you, that's great

3411
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Wish I could lose 16 pounds, bitch

3412
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Alright

3413
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Hey!

3414
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
You were on your, uh, involuntary toast diet

3415
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Yeah, that was bad

3416
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
That was bad

3417
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
That was bad. You know things are bad

3418
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
When you kinda almost wish you would get sick again

3419
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
So you could be that thin again

3420
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Remember when I had pneumonia?

3421
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
I really don't want that, I really don't

3422
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
I do not recommend anybody lose weight by pneumonia

3423
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
It's not fun

3424
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Well, no, I got, I lost

3425
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Actually, I shouldn't joke, like, that can't kill people

3426
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
I lost 35 pounds when I had pneumonia

3427
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
I was sick for three months, they thought I had whooping cough

3428
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
But it turned out that they were just

3429
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Not paying attention

3430
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Yay, unnamed healthcare company that Jamie has

3431
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
I called it the plague

3432
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Alright, let's wrap up

3433
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
We're done, we don't have any other game stories

3434
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Right, Loki, you burned through them all, we're good

3435
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
Yeah, we're done. Dark Sakura, alright

3436
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Loki's ready to go

3437
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
It's hot in here

3438
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
I thought we'd only be going an hour, we gave you two

3439
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
What the hell are you thinking, Rob?

3440
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Hey, you were here too, lady

3441
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
It's my house

3442
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
It's my house

3443
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
You're gonna fuck out

3444
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Then I am, goodnight

3445
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Bye, goodbye

3446
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
You've been listening

3447
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
No, we have to do final thoughts, we can't do that yet

3448
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Final thoughts, Dark Sakura

3449
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Hey, my final thought list, this is my house

3450
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
If you don't like it, you get the fuck out

3451
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Loki, your final thought

3452
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Uh, I can't wait to edit some more

3453
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Granted, I thought it was gonna be awesome

3454
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Hire me

3455
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
My final thought is I'm stopping getting fast food on the way home

3456
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
And ruining my diet some more, yay

3457
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
I did that today because I bought

3458
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
the wrong kind of bread, you know, I buy this like

3459
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
you know, whole wheat bread or whatever

3460
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
And I bought the wrong brand, so it was really

3461
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
it just had the wrong texture and just

3462
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
tasted weird, so I'm like

3463
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
McDonald's

3464
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
But I've been pretty good, I haven't been going to fast food

3465
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
except for today

3466
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
My other final thought, my mom's gonna be

3467
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
pissed when she finds out who won American Idol

3468
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Who did?

3469
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Dweiss, or whatever

3470
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
He sucked last night

3471
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
I don't want shit any of this season

3472
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
I know, I barely do, I did like that Crystal Bowers socks

3473
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
I thought she was good because somebody showed me her

3474
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
And apparently Alanis came out to duet with her tonight

3475
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Okay, I have to see

3476
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
That I have to see

3477
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
Doesn't go with the dreads, right?

3478
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
He sucked last night

3479
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
That was the chick with the dreads, right?

3480
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
She's cool

3481
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
No, she lost, just like Adam and I lost last year

3482
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
You know what, I did actually

3483
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
My mom's gonna be pissed, you know what?

3484
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
You wanna call my mom and tell her?

3485
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
About the week, Rob

3486
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
I have to tell you, I did

3487
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
actually buy

3488
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
some of the stuff off of Alison Irajeda's album

3489
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Okay, clearly the game

3490
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
part of the show is over

3491
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
So, if you were here for the video games

3492
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
then goodnight

3493
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio

3494
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Orange Lounge Radio

3495
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
is an Orange Lounge

3496
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
production

3497
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
To join us for a live show, visit

www.allgames.com

3499
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
No, I talked over to this gamer

3500
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Blah, blah, blah

3501
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
All games, listen to them, they rule

3502
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Yes, they do

3503
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Yes, they do

3504
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Shh, no they don't

3505
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
But they do have my competitor

3506
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
No, we won't

3507
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
We'll see you in two weeks

3508
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Let's go on

3509
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
She's watching it right now, too

3510
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Your mom's so funny

3511
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Oh, don't ruin it for her

3512
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Oh, then we're calling right now

3513
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Hello

3514
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Hi mom

3515
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Who is this?

3516
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
It's Rob, your kid

3517
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
I already know who won

3518
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Damn it

3519
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
I was calling

3520
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Why are you laughing?

3521
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Why are you laughing?

3522
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Why are you laughing?

3523
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
We're on the radio right now

3524
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
and I was calling because I read it on the internet

3525
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
and I wanted to spoil it for you

3526
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
I got on the internet at

3527
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
7 o'clock, I'm not stupid

3528
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
She was Rob

3529
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
This is weird, my mother

3530
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Now admit it, mom

3531
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
a year ago, you made me

3532
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
go online and look it up

3533
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
You didn't know how to do this

3534
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Yeah, but I don't need your help anymore

3535
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Is this why you decided to

3536
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Did you hear that?

3537
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
You got served

3538
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
I'm not on the radio, am I?

3539
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Yeah, you are, it's okay

3540
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
You don't mind, do you?

3541
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
My mom said that I had to text her

3542
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
and warn her before we call

3543
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Mom, this is the part after the credits

3544
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
so no one's listening, it's cool

3545
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Are you watching the finale anyway?

3546
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
I didn't watch the first half

3547
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
I said I'm not gonna watch it

3548
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
because I'm too mad

3549
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
I couldn't stand it, so I turned it on

3550
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Now, did you or did you not tell me last year

3551
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
First off, who should have won last year?

3552
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Adam

3553
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
I know, right?

3554
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
And why should Adam have won last year?

3555
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
Because he was by far the best

3556
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
And what made him the best?

3557
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
He just was, he was more of a showman

3558
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
He was the best

3559
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
That's why that Chris guy is selling

3560
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
his stuff on QVC

3561
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
and Adam's touring

3562
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:56,000
I did like Alison

3563
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Explain why you...

3564
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Yes, I like Alison too

3565
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
and she's doing okay because I saw her on

3566
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
I bought her album

3567
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
It's actually really good

3568
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Hold on, you guys are talking last year's news

3569
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
I wanna talk this year again

3570
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
I'm still reeling over David Cook, pardon me

3571
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
Well, okay, last night

3572
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Lee stunk

3573
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
His first single's gonna be a beautiful day

3574
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
and it was awful

3575
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
It was terrible

3576
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
The one that she did was really good

3577
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
and I was hoping that would come out on

3578
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
a CD because I'd like to buy it

3579
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
I think maybe she's gonna be more

3580
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Don't you think the runner-ups

3581
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
often fare better unless you're the beatboxing guy?

3582
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
In the last few years

3583
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
they have, and the reason they have

3584
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
is because, and I've told you this before

3585
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
it becomes a popularity contest

3586
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
in the end and the little girls

3587
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
all vote for the cute guys

3588
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Except for David Cook because I thought

3589
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
David Cook did not have nearly the talent

3590
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
that David Cook had

3591
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Well, I

3592
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
And David Cook is

3593
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
I think it wasn't so much that he didn't have

3594
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
the talent that he was really young

3595
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
That was my mother respectfully disagreeing with you

3596
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

3597
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
I know the tone

3598
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
I honestly, personally

3599
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
I think that David Cook had better stage presence

3600
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
but that's me

3601
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Well, he probably did, but he was older

3602
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
and more mature

3603
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
same way as this year with Aaron

3604
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
cause I thought Aaron was really a good singer

3605
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
but he was only 17

3606
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
and he didn't have the

3607
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
you know, he didn't have the charisma and stuff

3608
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
I had him in my third place spot

3609
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
I was picking, well originally when we had

3610
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
cause we had a work pool for this

3611
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
I had Crystal, Casey, and Aaron

3612
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
cause Lee, at the time, I mean

3613
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
it was like a good, you know

3614
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
before, I think it was at the top ten

3615
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Well he didn't start out to be one of the better ones

3616
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
he started out, really

3617
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
he just sounded like

3618
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
a bunch of mainstream artists now

3619
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Okay, I have to

3620
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
I like Big Mike too

3621
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
I have to ask you this, because I just

3622
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
you know, you said last year, when Adam lost last year

3623
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
you said, and I quote,

3624
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
I am never watching that show again

3625
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
because the person that should win never does

3626
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
and yet, you watched this year

3627
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
No, they used to, but

3628
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
lately it hasn't been that way

3629
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Well, did Reuben deserve to beat Clay?

3630
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
No, Clay deserved it by far

3631
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Okay, actually if

3632
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
you don't mind me asking, because

3633
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
I'm of two minds about this too

3634
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Did you prefer Carrie Underwood

3635
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
or Bo Bice?

3636
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Oh, I preferred Carrie Underwood

3637
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Most of the time I've been for the person that's won

3638
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
there's been a few times

3639
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
so that I thought the second place one should've won

3640
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
See, I'm from Alabama

3641
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
so Bo Bice automatically got my vote

3642
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
And you're biased, that's fine

3643
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
And he sang with Lynyrd Skynyrd, how could you go wrong with that?

3644
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Okay, I have to ask my mother though

3645
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Are you gonna make the threat that you're not watching next year?

3646
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
I don't think

3647
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
with Simon gone, I don't think it's gonna be

3648
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
nearly as popular

3649
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Are divas leaving?

3650
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Who do you think should replace Simon?

3651
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
I don't think there's anybody

3652
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
that can replace him

3653
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
It's just like when they

3654
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
took Paula off, the show lost something

3655
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
What are the names they're throwing around?

3656
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Elton John, could Elton John replace Simon?

3657
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
No

3658
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
You know who I want to replace Simon?

3659
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Graham Norton

3660
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Who?

3661
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Graham Norton, he's a talk show host

3662
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
He's funny

3663
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
What about Perez Hilton?

3664
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
Well some people have suggested

3665
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Howard Stern too

3666
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
He wants to do it

3667
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Howard Stern

3668
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
it's like a big joke gone out of control

3669
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
and Perez Hilton is just a bitch

3670
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
And it would turn into a

3671
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
dirty show if Howard Stern got on

3672
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
What else

3673
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
was I gonna say?

3674
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
The X Factor, Simon's new

3675
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
show that Paula is rumored to be a judge

3676
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Suddenly it's the reality TV podcast

3677
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
No, no, she got a dance show

3678
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
She's gonna do a dance show

3679
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Where have you been? Are you into rock or something?

3680
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Sorry, I'm doing a show on video games

3681
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
It makes sense for me

3682
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
I'm a games analyst, did you hear?

3683
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
No

3684
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
How'd you get to be a games analyst?

3685
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
I told Robbie I was

3686
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Yeah, Jamie told me I was

3687
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
In other words

3688
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
you're a games analyst

3689
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
in your own mind

3690
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
That's not what my business card says

3691
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
but sure

3692
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
I'm an authority on Idol in my

3693
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
own mind too

3694
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Well then she's the official

3695
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
Rob's mom, the official

3696
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
American Idol

3697
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
analyst for Orange Lounge Radio

3698
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
I just used my

3699
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
female powers of always being right to make

3700
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Rob an analyst

3701
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Alright, X Factor

3702
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
Yes or no? Are you gonna watch it?

3703
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Probably because I think it will be a much better show

3704
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
because it won't be

3705
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
relying on the public

3706
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
to pick the winner

3707
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
Ok, one more then I promise I'm wrapping this up

3708
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
That little 11 year old kid that Ellen DeGeneres

3709
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
I know you watch her show everyday, right?

3710
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Absolutely great

3711
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
He's got that Bieber kid beat to it

3712
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
He's so much better

3713
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
This is why I love my mother

3714
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
His name is

3715
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Chance

3716
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
His first name is Grayson

3717
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Grayson Chance

3718
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
He's absolutely great

3719
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Did you watch Glee last night?

3720
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
They did Gaga

3721
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
Where were you?

3722
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
I have to ask my mother

3723
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
this

3724
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
About this whole thing

3725
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Rob I adore your mom

3726
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
I know, she's pretty cool

3727
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Now I forgot what I was gonna ask

3728
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Glee

3729
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Grayson Chance and the

3730
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Bieber

3731
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
Since you're hooked up to the internet now

3732
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
You know how to use Google?

3733
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
Yeah, absolutely

3734
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
I want you to Google this website

3735
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Lesbians that look like Justin Bieber

3736
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
There's

3737
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
probably a lot of them with that haircut he's got

3738
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
There is

3739
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
There's a whole blog dedicated

3740
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
to lesbians that look like Justin Bieber

3741
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
You should see Rob right now, he's all red in the face

3742
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
This is my mother

3743
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
My mom likes Lady Gaga

3744
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Do you like Lady Gaga?

3745
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Yeah

3746
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
She didn't use to

3747
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
She thought Lady Gaga was disgusting

3748
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
But then when I said Lady Gaga is cool

3749
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
My mom came around

3750
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
I'm still not coming around

3751
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
I never said she was disgusting, I never really paid that much attention

3752
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
You said when she did that performance

3753
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
When she set the piano on fire

3754
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Whiskey bottles and stuff

3755
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
You were like, oh no

3756
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
You were mad because Adam Lambert

3757
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Got in trouble over kissing a guy

3758
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
And everybody else

3759
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
had grabbed their crotch

3760
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
And everything, right?

3761
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
And worse things were done by other people

3762
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
And they didn't pay attention to it, that's what made me mad

3763
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
That's what he said himself

3764
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
He's like, well if all these other people can get away with it

3765
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Why shouldn't I be able to?

3766
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Exactly, on the same show

3767
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
I can't remember, was it Janet Jackson?

3768
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
I don't remember, somebody

3769
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
Did something worse

3770
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Alright

3771
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
They didn't even say anything

3772
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
But I think he's getting past that now

3773
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
And I'm glad

3774
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Because I don't think people

3775
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Um

3776
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
You know, they're not being that judgemental

3777
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
About him anymore

3778
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
We have to wrap up this extremely random

3779
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Epilogue that's had nothing to do with

3780
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Video games whatsoever, is there any video games you're excited

3781
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
There's an American Idol video game

3782
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Are there any video games you're excited about, mom?

3783
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
I don't do video games

3784
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Are you going to play Farmville?

3785
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:24,000
I absolutely know nothing about video games

3786
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
You don't know Farmville?

3787
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Is that the one that

3788
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
My friend was playing on the internet

3789
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Where you own a farm and you try to make money

3790
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
She knows Farmville

3791
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
There you go, see, she's a bigger gamer

3792
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Well she was playing that on the internet, she got hooked on it

3793
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
Alright

3794
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
You officially know more about the internet

3795
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Than my grandmother does

3796
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
Congratulations

3797
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
I don't know, I don't know a lot

3798
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
She's come a long way in a year

3799
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
No, I remember

3800
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
I don't want to give out my mom's email on the show

3801
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
But it's really funny

3802
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
Absolutely not

3803
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
I'm not, but it's really funny

3804
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Like if you know her email, it's really funny

3805
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
But I actually remember a couple years ago

3806
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Actually we gave you a call a few years ago

3807
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
And tried to ask you about something and you didn't

3808
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
Know because it was online

3809
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
My mom's on the internet

3810
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
My grandmother's on the internet now

3811
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
My dad is on Facebook

3812
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
I think that the apocalypse is happening

3813
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Well I won't do Facebook

3814
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
Why do you not want to go on Facebook?

3815
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Because I don't want to put my face on

3816
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
There for a day, see

3817
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Alright

3818
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Mom, we gotta wrap up and put the nail in the coffin

3819
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
At the show, but thanks for being a good sport

3820
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
It was good talking to you again

3821
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Okay, I hope the right person runs next year

3822
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Alright, bye

3823
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
I love you

3824
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Oh, she's hung up on me

3825
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
I love you too

3826
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
She's hung up on me

3827
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Wicked woman

3828
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Okay, so Rob, next show that we do, we're calling my mother

3829
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
We have to call her early though

3830
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Alright, text her and get her to her age

3831
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Alright, we really are wrapping up and it really is a night

3832
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
Goodnight everybody, thanks for tuning in

3833
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
Thank you for supporting our show

3834
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
If you like the show, I forgot to say this earlier

3835
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Please post a nice review about us on iTunes and all that stuff

3836
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Tell a friend or two about the show

3837
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
Help us spread the word, blah blah blah

3838
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
The end, here's the ending theme, one more time to take us out

3839
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Goodnight

3840
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
