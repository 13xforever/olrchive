Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Who's your hosts?

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
Dark Sakura, Sky and Lowkey

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 368 of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
The video game talk show where every gamer has a voice

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
But not tonight apparently, tonight's going to be a little bit different

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
And I will get to that in just a moment, but my name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Maybe hour, I don't know, we'll see how long we go tonight

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
With my co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
It better not be hours

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
Well yeah, it's already a little late, just to put it, well let me introduce everyone and then we'll get into what's going on tonight

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Also the one and only tech master, Lowkey

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Hello

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
How you doing Lowkey?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
I'm doing good

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
Alright so here's the deal, we're not live, it's not Sunday, we're cheating a little bit

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
You know usually we do this little program of ours live and we have a chat room full of people

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
And you know live callers and all that stuff, but we are not live tonight

01:19.000 --> 01:26.000
We were supposed to be live last Sunday, the 20 something, 22nd, I don't know

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
But we weren't live because it was kind of my fault

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
I was out of town and while I was out of town my car was parked at a friend's house

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
And somehow a nail ended up on my tire while it was parked at a friend's house

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
So unfortunately instead of coming right home, picking up my car and driving right here to the show

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Which was the original plan, I had to go fix a tire

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
So unfortunately the live show didn't happen

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
So apologies to you kids and of course Lowkey and Dark Sakura who clear their schedules every Sunday night

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
And I wasn't even here, I'm a bad person

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Damn nail

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
That's okay, I had more Red Dead Redemption in the play

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
I was gonna say, you guys probably figured out something to do to kill time

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Because I knew pretty early in the day it wasn't gonna happen

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
I hung out with Becky

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Well awesome, you got girl time, ew girl stuff

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
And we went to Fresh Choice and ate salad

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Ew

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
I can't condone that kind of behavior

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
I know, gross

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Alright I'm glad I wasn't here, I'm glad I was 100 miles away from you

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Alright just kidding

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Hey

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Alright well so here's the deal

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
We already knew we weren't gonna be here Memorial Day weekend because it's Memorial Day weekend

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
I know I for one am gonna be in Oregon and just you know the long weekend

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
I think we wanna all do other stuff

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
So if Dark Sakura wants to eat Fresh Choice three days in a row, she can go do that

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
So we wanted to do like a show though at least for the podcastees

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
So that way we're not going two weeks without a show

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
So a lot of the podcast folks that don't usually tune in live

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
This show's kind of actually for you because this way

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
A lot of the show's been kind of hitting the feed Wednesday, Thursday anyway

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
So you guys will probably not even notice except for the fact that we don't have a live audience tonight

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
That we're really missing anything

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
So just kind of setting the stage there

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
We're offline tonight, it's Wednesday so we're actually midweek

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
And you know that's where we're at

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
We're kind of taping this as a bridge to fill two weeks of no live shows

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
I do want to point out though, we will be off Memorial Day

03:15.000 --> 03:24.000
Our next live show will be at allgames.com at 6pm Pacific time on Sunday, June 6th

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
It'll be the next live show and that's right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
At 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
And of course we always have our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
So Robby says 6pm specific time

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Specific

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
At a specific time

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
It's 6! Specifically it's 6!

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
I'm sorry

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
I meant to say 6 Pacific but I kind of

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Really did that you started, I have to give you a hard time

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
See right now you've got me in the middle of the week on hump day

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
When my spirit hasn't quite been broken

03:53.000 --> 04:01.000
You know and I'm not doing the what's tomorrow

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
So wait we might get good mood Jamie tonight

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
I'm just teasing

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
And you're full of salad, you ought to be in a great mood

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Actually I'm not full of salad right now, I'm full of taco

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Okay, ooh tacos

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
I had, because we have to do food

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Yes

04:15.000 --> 04:22.000
I had refried black beans and brown Spanish rice

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
On a sprouted green tortilla

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Yum

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
I haven't eaten dinner yet and I'm smelling Loki's chicken so

04:29.000 --> 04:35.000
That's why I ate cause he brings his chicken in and I'm like yum wait I can't eat that

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
I just didn't want burgers tonight, it's all good

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Rob do you want me to make you some dinner?

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
No no I gotta stop by and get some stuff for the big road trip

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
Cause I am driving 10 hours to Portland Oregon

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
And I've never taken a road trip that long

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
I've never been to Oregon

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
You should get some raw nuts

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
For the trip

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Raw nuts and dried fruit

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Good times

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
Alright here's the other interesting thing about tonight's show

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
And what might make this show a little special

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
We don't have a script tonight, usually we have you know not that the show is scripted

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
Or even fun but we usually have like an outline, we call it a show roll

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
And you've probably heard us refer to it before

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
A little behind the scenes there

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
We do have like a list of who's gonna cover what topic

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
That way we're not stepping on each other's toes

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
And we kinda know who's gonna talk about what

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
And you know we have a general flow to the show

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Not tonight, we're winging it tonight

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
This is gonna be like the old days

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Remember the old days?

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
Except I don't have the headset on and I won't have a migraine hopefully

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
So yeah so I

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
I know I might get high on chicken fumes

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
We'll see what happens, we don't know

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
But we do always start off the show with how was your gaming week

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
And we don't plan to change that

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
So DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
I gamed Rob, I gamed

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
I played Portal

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Because it was free

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
And it's really hard to get used to the controls on

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
You know from going from playing on a controller to playing on

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
My PC but it's pretty cool

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
And I of course played a lot of Star Trek online

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Because I've got the week off, you know I'm out of school

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
And it's like I've got all this stuff I have to focus on

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
But I so haven't been able to

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
And I played some Babylonian Twins today

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
For a little bit

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
And Dan's playing more Grand Theft Horse

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
He killed his horse by accident

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Except he died too so he got his horse back

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
He keeps complaining about not having his original horse

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Because he liked his horse

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
I was like what was good about the horse?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
It was a bay horse and I liked it, it was pretty

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Oh whatever

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
So yeah and he was picking his you know gristled cowboys

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Out picking flowers for this old guy

06:36.000 --> 06:42.000
And then Pac-Man, Google Pac-Man

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
Because Namco had their 25th anniversary

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
I think it's 30th

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
30th anniversary

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
30th anniversary and so the Google splash thing was a playable version of Pac-Man

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
And if you go to Google.com slash Pac-Man

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
You can actually go back and play it

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
What's impressive about that if I recall

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
I was reading up on it

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
It's not like Flash

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
It's not Java

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
It's using some pretty basic web technology to bring it to you

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Which is really impressive

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
The programming

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
And actually I was checking out the Twitter earlier

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
Somebody on Twitter is going to have us talk about that a little more

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
It looks like it actually resulted in a lot of lost productivity at work

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Fascinating

07:23.000 --> 07:29.000
Was it Cnet or one of those news sites posted about how much had been lost

07:29.000 --> 07:35.000
And then it went on saying that that's really nothing compared to the little five minutes at a time

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
People sneak on reading Wikipedia from their desk

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Right

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
So they're using it as a scapegoat and as an excuse to ban Google

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
You know what

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
From work sites

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
We're free form tonight

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Let me jump over to Twitter real quick

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
I'm going to jump over to Twitter real quick

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
And read one of the tweets we got earlier

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Even though we're not live and we don't have the chatters tonight

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
We did post on Twitter

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Hey give us stories

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
We'll still try to interact with you the best we can

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Because you know we can't just go to all games and say

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
We want to be live right now

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Because I think there's another show on right now

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
It was from Dr. Noire

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Dr. N-O-I-R

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Dr. Noire

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Here's the fallout from Google's Pac-Man tribute

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Sending us a tweet from BBC News

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
The playable version of the classic video game was put on Google's front page on 21st of May

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
To celebrate 30 years since the launch of Pac-Man in Japan

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
Now there were statistics gathered by the software firm Rescue Time

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
About how much this damn thing was actually played

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
On a typical day it suggests that most people will do about 22 searches on the Google page

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Each one lasts about 11 seconds

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
But putting Pac-Man on the front page

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
It boosted that time by an average of about 36 seconds

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
And that would be based on the browsing habits of 11,000 Rescue Time users

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
I guess it's the software that companies install on their computers

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
To know who's being naughty on the internet when they're not supposed to be

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
And so let's see they did all the math

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
And they figured that with 504 million unique users

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Who visit the main Google page per day

09:05.000 --> 09:11.000
That means 4.8 million hours, 549 years were wasted on Pac-Man

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
Assuming that people are paid on average $25 an hour

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Really?

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
I know I was like I want to know what that is so I can work there

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
Or $17.50 if you want to convert it to pounds an hour

09:23.000 --> 09:29.000
This equates to about $120 million in lost productivity

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
I think that's some fuzzy math there if you ask me but

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
Well yeah $25 an hour I mean come on

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
Bottom line people will still waste time on Pac-Man even if it's just 36 seconds

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Got Pac-Man fever

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Alright so we'll go back to the other tweets later

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
But I thought that was topical and worth mentioning

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
So yeah I checked out the Google Pac-Man it was cool

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
It's topical like hydrocortisone

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
And it emulated the original Pac-Man pretty well

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
It was pretty fun except there's this one part where there's the grid a little bit off

09:59.000 --> 10:04.000
Where the last E is because the little place you enter in on the E

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
Is actually sort of just off center from where the escape door is

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Yes and then the G is just weird

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Because you have like this dead end tunnel you don't really have on a Pac-Man board usually

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
I mean it was a great concept

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
You know what I hope for for the 35th?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Super Pac-Man Google

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Lordy

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Because Ms. Pac-Man already made a cameo in the other one if you clicked insert coin

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Anyway

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
This is true Rob

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Anything else in your gaming week you want to report for us?

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
I got my Sims 3 working again so I've been playing more Sims

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
As you can see here I'm back to my hunt for

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
That's a Sims site?

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
I thought you were like shopping for like IKEA or something over there

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
There's people who've actually tried to

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
Well IKEA and EA had this deal going on for a while

10:47.000 --> 10:55.000
Where they had some of their standard stuff available for Sims 2

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Now did your Sims have to actually build it and get frustrated as hell

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
When they couldn't understand the instructions because they're nothing but pictures?

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
No

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
But um there's people who missed the IKEA stuff

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
And have really gone

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
Like you know I'm looking at some of the furniture on here

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
And this is actually some

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
As a design major Rob

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
This is actually pretty impressive stuff

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
If anyone wants to know the sites that I go to for my Sims stuff

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I go to The Sims Resource

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
I actually have a subscription to The Sims Resource

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
Mod The Sims is good but Stylist Sims

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Has got some really

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
It's got donation stuff and I don't really advocate donation items

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
You know because you have to pay for them

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
But at the same time people did put work into this stuff

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
But there's some absolutely gorgeous design stuff

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I would really have in my actual house

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Should I be able to afford it ever

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
I'm surprised Sims doesn't have something like that

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
I mean in World of Warcraft you can go through certain websites

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
And you can get an actual figure of your WoW character

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
From the data it pulls down from the armory

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I mean

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
It's crazy like how interactive some of this stuff is now

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
I'm surprised you can't buy some of your

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
Like a fake Sims house that's your actual Sims house

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
If that makes any sense at all

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
I know what you mean

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
You know how like in the fifth grade we used to have to build houses out of balsa wood

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
For like a school project

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
I never had to do that

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Really? In the fourth grade we had to make missions out of sugar cubes

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
You were in Alabama

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
See we had the missions here in California

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Did you have to do this in school?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Yeah I had to make a mission

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
You had to build the missions out of sugar cubes

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I think mine had a pasta roof

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Cause you know how the roofs of the missions

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
You know you've seen the California missions on the coast right

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
They kind of have that very clay wavy look

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Well you use like lasagna and you paint it

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
I made mine out of Legos

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Yeah I never had to do that

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
We would instead

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
Every so often head down to the museum downtown

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Cause keep in mind where I'm from

12:58.000 --> 13:05.000
You just sneeze and you'll hit something that's been around since the 18th century

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
I was actually showing Loki before you got here some of the old Victorian homes

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
If you look up Victorian homes, Mobile Alabama

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
You will see some absolutely gorgeous places

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
But the museum downtown recreated a lot of these in doll size

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Well there's some stuff from the 18th century around here

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
It's called gold

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Did you hear about this big rock

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Apparently somebody dug up

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Up in Cameron Park or something

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Big old gold nugget just hiding in the backyard

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
My mom keeps telling me that I should go out panning

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
And I'm like okay you come out to California

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
In 113 degree weather and you pan

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
That was another stupid thing we did as kids

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
We used to go take the bus up to Sutter's Fort or whatever and do gold panning

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Sutter's Mill

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Or Sutter's Mill sorry Sutter's Fort is the place downtown

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
We used to actually go out to reservations

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Really

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
I've been to a couple pallets

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
I go to reservations now but I go gambling

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
I've actually been to about 5 pallets

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
We never really had to do anything

14:05.000 --> 14:11.000
I don't want to say stupid but time wasting like that I guess

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
Because first of all with some of the stupid children

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
You know parents hated that shit because they had to do half of it

14:18.000 --> 14:24.000
But we did have to do, we had a lot of focus on doing actual full science projects

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
And experiments and real lab time

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
The worst was when I got to high school

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Because I've talked about this on the show before in my high school

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
The Whitey McWhite High that I went to that was two thirds Mormon kids

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
And it was all these rich kids that lived out by the lake

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
And then like you know I lived in the poor part of town where I came from

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
So we went to this school I kid you not it was the most undiverse place on the planet

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
I mean it was tragic

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Right from a John Hughes movie

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
But you know you had all these spoiled ass little rich kids

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
Like I'm sure they were like hiring people to do their school projects

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
It was pretty like you know we had to build the houses and stuff

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
They would be made from like actual stone and all this stuff

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
And it's just like you spoiled bitch

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
Mine's made out of popsicle sticks

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
Where I actually had to eat all the popsicles over the course of like three months

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
That's the fun part

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
That's true

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
Now you can just go to Michael's and get a bag of popsicle sticks

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
I know

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
And I'm like god damn ungrateful kids

15:23.000 --> 15:28.000
Who didn't have to realize the value of the popsicles that come with two sticks

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Because they're just two popsicles glued together

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
I don't even remember what they're called

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
You can get fudgesicles like that

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
What the hell tangent is this show on right now?

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
You know what I miss? Pudding pops

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
They're still around aren't they?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
They came back

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I miss pudding pop commercials

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Those are the best

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
Dude cause it's all about Bill Cosby

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
But you know you remember one of my favorite comics ever is Bloom County

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
And I always liked that um

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
What was the guy's name?

15:54.000 --> 16:00.000
But his dad Bill Cosby lived in his anxiety closet with pudding pops

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
Cosby here with a special report from Jello Brand Pudding Pops

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Mothers do your kids talk like this?

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Chocolate

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
vanilla

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Swirl

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
Don't worry they're just asking for Jello Pudding Pops Swirls

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Good news for your mom and you mom

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
That wasn't one of the better commercials

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Sounds delicious

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
That was like a fake newscast

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
I know now you got me fucking hungry

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Pudding pops

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Rude

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Alright um I want to go back a little bit

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Something you were mentioning earlier

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
They even make pudding pops anymore?

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
I just said they brought them back

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Hello Loki

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Hey I'm working on the show

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Alright fine

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
Yeah he wants to do this thing called news

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Like we're trying to fucking talk about pudding pops

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
And Loki's concerned with gaming news

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
As if we are a video game talk show

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
When we're done though with the gaming week though

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
I do need to make a plug

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Or do you want me to do it now?

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
Uh you can do it now but I want to say one other thing about your gaming week

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Because you said earlier that Portal is a bitch to control on the computer

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Yes

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
I want to give you a pro tip awesome and a lot of people forget about this

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Controller?

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Xbox 360 controllers

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
They're USB you can plug them right in

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
If you have a wired one

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
I honestly think the wired 360 controllers are almost a better purchase

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Than the wireless ones

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
At least have one you know

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
I think I've got one

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
Yeah I have one I think I have like three controllers and one of them is wired

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
And it's great because I can go to the computer and use it there

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
And it's pretty awesome

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
But I have kind of gotten the hang of doing some of the puzzles

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
Just I keep forgetting that I look

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
Well see I've got a thumb track ball on my mouse

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
So looking around with the track ball is kind of difficult for me

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
And then remembering that you know

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
I wish it's just that I could have my action button

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Like in Resident Evil back in the day

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
And hold my action button and turn around and walk

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
You know but meh

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Okay you want to plug something

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
I think I know what you want to plug

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
And if it is what I think it is then cool

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
I was wondering when we could say something about this

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
Well there is a new website that is currently being worked on

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
By our dear Tiara as we know on the show

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
You know as Mar and Marvel

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
It's geek-life.com

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
And the site launches on the 1st

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
And I do an article on there one called Geek Cube

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
Where it's you know about being a geek working in a cubicle

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
And you know but we're

18:21.000 --> 18:26.000
Instead of being game specific or you know

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Anime specific or something

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
We're geek total geek

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Just nerdy geeky dorky fun

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Nerdy geeky dorky fun that's right

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
I wonder if that domain name is taken

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Nerdy geeky dorky fun

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
No competition please

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
But we are looking for people to contribute

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
So if you have something that you want to share

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
If you want to write an article

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
We do however ask that you use a spell checker

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Someone to proofread it

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
Because if you don't then we're going to be brutal

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
I'll try to contribute once in a while

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
If you lovely ladies will have me

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Of course we'll have you for dinner

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
Or something related because that's what I know

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
I'll do a wow column

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
Well I'm going to have other side projects too

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Coming up and I know you and I have been talking about one

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
Hopefully E3 this year will have a press conference of our own

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
It'll be fun

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Good stuff in the future

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
Well the other thing too is that I'm planning on doing a DIY

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
Segment you know maybe once a week

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
On there too about doing little do it yourself projects

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
You know how to decoupage

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Oh god geek decoupage

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
It's geek decoupage

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Dude I've got my bathhouse picture back there

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
That's pretty cool

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
That's art geek decoupage

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
But yeah but I mean that's the general thing so

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Alright let's move on with gaming weeks

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
Also anyone out there looking for designer

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Hire me

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Low key how was your gaming week

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
It was good I didn't play a whole lot though

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
I played basically well two things

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
But one whatever anyways

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Red Dead Redemption playing a lot of that

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Grand Theft Tours

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
Been playing mostly System Link multiplayer

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Because we were playing it at work

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
And it's been pretty fun

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
You can do little gang missions and stuff

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
And join a posse and kill people

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
And you get experience which unlocks more characters you can play as

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
And more mounts and more weapons

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
So that's all kind of fun

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
The first kind of real day that we decided to go play that

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
We were running around fighting bears with knives

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
Which is funny because the willing critters seem to team up against you

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
In fact there was one point where I had a coyote

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
A boar and a bear chasing after me

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
Coyote didn't really do much but the boar was really quick

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
And knocked me over and then left me to get eaten by the bear

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
So that sucked

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
And then the cougars are little fuckers

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
They chase after you really fast and keep killing me

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
Is Courtney Cox one of the cougars?

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Maybe

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
I didn't name any of them so I guess one of them could be Courtney Cox

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
Then of course other than that I've played more Grand Theft Auto

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
And that's been pretty fun

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
The major part I've been working on stuff with Grand Theft Auto

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
Like I mentioned before is I'm working on creating another modded game

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
For us to play at work

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
And the major achievement that I was able to accomplish this week

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
Is that I figured out how to edit the map

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
In Grand Theft Auto on the console

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
Which as far as I'm aware now has never been done before

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
So that's been pretty awesome

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
And I ran into some roadblocks before with stuff being rotated weird

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
But I actually figured that all out last night

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
So I'm ready to create all sorts of crazy stuff

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
Including giant loop-de-loops and stuff like that

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Lots of ramps

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
But yeah, back to Red Dead Redemption though

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
That game is so glitchy

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
It's just hilarious

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
I was playing today, called my horse over

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
And the horse came galloping at me at full speed

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
Off a cliff to its death

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Bounced in front of me

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
And then bounced off another cliff

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
I'm like what the hell

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
I've seen some angry tweets about

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
I think I saw a tweet earlier this week that was like

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Did anybody QA test this game?

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Well there was some other ones

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Like there was one of the missions that we were doing

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
The first posse mission that we did

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
We were going after this one gang

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
We had to destroy their ammo caches

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
And so after you destroy the second one

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
There's reinforcements that are sent after you

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
Well for whatever reason they decided to spawn up on the hill

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
And they jumped to their death

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
And it was awesome

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
It has problems with cliffs

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
It just doesn't understand them sometimes

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
And so it was just like kept hearing this

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Ahhhhhh

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
See people die

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
It's like Toons is the driving horse

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
It's awesome

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
And then there's been other videos I've seen that have problems

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Where different objects are spawning on different characters

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
So for example

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Instead of your mount that's a donkey

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
You have a woman

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
So you're riding around on a woman that sounds like a donkey

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
And has a horse face

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I think I saw something like that on the internet once

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Yes

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
And then some other

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Crows that are actually people

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
So they're like flying around

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
And flapping their arms and stuff

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
And that's pretty funny

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
And I think the funniest one I saw

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Other than the cougar man

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Was the dog

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Bounty hunter

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Like a real dog

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Like a coyote

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
So it was this coyote running around carrying a rifle

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
That's pretty funny

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Oh and there's a wonderful glitch where you can

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Crouch against a wall and get shot up into space

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
So should I buy it?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
There's great reviews and everything

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
It's a lot of fun

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
There's tons of people on there to play with

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Grand Theft Tourist Rob

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
And if you don't want to play with those people

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
You can always start a private game

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
And just mess around or go on missions

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
I don't like to play with strangers

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
I'll play with people on my friends list

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
And you guys and the listeners

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
What if the strangers want to play with you?

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
No

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
No means no

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Alright

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Kind of piggybacking on that and going into my gaming week

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
As part of this whole Oregon thing

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
You know they don't have sales tax in Oregon

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
I'm making a list of games

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
I want to buy while I'm up in Oregon

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
I'm going to buy that

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
I think

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
That's kind of like on the bubble so to speak

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
But I definitely want to get Blur

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
I want to get Split Second

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Is Split Second cool?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Yeah, Dan loves it

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Alan Wake I hear is pretty awesome

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Somebody described it as like a Twin Peaks

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Type video game

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
I realized all you all were

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
All big on, well not you guys specifically

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Just the general, if Twitter is any indication

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Of where the world's at

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Everybody went nucking futs over the Lost finale

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
This weekend, which ironically was on Sunday night

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
I think there was actually a tweet out there

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
That said, you guys cancelled the show

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
To go watch the Lost finale

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
I don't watch Lost

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
I watch good shows

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
I'm not hating on Lost

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Any show that gets people talking as much as that show did

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Is doing something right

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
But I didn't watch the first few episodes

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
And it's one of those shows where if you don't watch the first few episodes

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
You're fucked, it's not going to make any sense

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
So I never watched it

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
If I can interject, back to Alan Wake

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Dan described it as

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Oh great, what's that game?

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Silent Hill meets Max Payne

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Interesting

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Sounds good, no, well I was going to say

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Before Lost, way back when

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
In the 90's there was a little show called Twin Peaks

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
It was awesome

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
And it was a total like WTF

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Mind trip as well, it didn't last very long sadly

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
They really screwed with it

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
On the time slots and they answered

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
The show's biggest question

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Who killed Laura Palmer way too soon

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
And so that kind of killed the show when that happened

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
But I say that because

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
I love that show and if there's any video game

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Being remotely compared to that show

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
I'm all about it, so I'll check it out

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Yeah, so I'm making this list

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
And then my goal is to just go hit up a GameStop

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Or Fry's or whatever they have up there

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
And just go to town

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
What's the big thing they have up there?

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Fred Meyer

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Those ginormous stores

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
That they have I guess

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Go check out one of those

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
So that's the plan

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
As far as my actual gaming week in games I've been playing

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Not a whole lot this week, of course more

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
But I want to say something on that in a minute

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Alan hit 80 this week

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
So I'm very happy and proud for him

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
But now that he has hit 80

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
I think I'm going to, believe it or not

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Scale back on WoW a little bit

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
And I am making it my summer goal

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Before Labor Day

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
To actually beat

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
And this is a big deal for me

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
I mean actually beat from start to finish

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Three games

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
And I realize that might sound like nothing

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
But this is me we're talking about

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
For me to actually complete

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
A role playing game or an adventure game

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Or something like that is a BFD

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Because I have the worst gamer ADD

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
I will start a game and play it for an hour and go somewhere else

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
No I have not

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
See!

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
That's the problem

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
You know you gotta let me borrow it

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
So WoW will be

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Scaled back

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
I'll still do the raids with the guild

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
And play with Alan for at least an hour

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Several times a week and so forth

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
And actually beat three games

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
And I don't mean like beating

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
What's something like really easy

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
That takes like five seconds to beat

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
You know like

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Well no I don't think that would be one of the games anyway

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
But uh

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Like Final Fight

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
I played in an hour

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
I beat Final Fight that doesn't count

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
That takes like an hour

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
I'm going to beat three adventure RPG

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Something games

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
So I don't know what yet

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
But I want you guys

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
As my gamer nerd buddies

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Here in studio to hold me to it

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
And if I'm lagging

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
I need verbal lashings

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Do you think you can do that Dark Sakura?

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Verbal lashings?

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
I'll point at you and laugh

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Well I'm down for that

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
I'm going to try Alan Wake

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
And if I like it that will probably be one of the three

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
But I'll let you know

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Because I might not like it I don't know

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
And I might say no I legitimately do not want to play this to completion

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
But a game like Final Fantasy 13

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Really ought to be one of the three

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Well beat it and then lend it to me

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Get his copy

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Whoever beats it first let me borrow it

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Sure

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
I'll tell you right now

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
I want to play it on PS3

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
I'm out

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Oh I have the PS3 version so I'll have to beat it and then let you borrow it

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Alright I'm going to beat it yet

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
You beat it yet Rob

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Fair enough

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Someone else needs to get me to Cydia

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Other stuff in my gaming week

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Game Room I'm still playing the crap out of that

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
And River Raid came out today

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
It's rare that we have the show mid-week

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Where I can talk about releases as they happen

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
River Raid was a classic classic Atari 2600 game made by Activision

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
My Activision room has like six Activision games in it right now

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
It's crazy

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
I've literally bought like ten games in Game Room

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
I've spent

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
If you say like three to five dollars a game

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Most of them I only paid three

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Four but there's a few that I also play on the PC

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
So I bought the upgrade

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
That means I've spent like thirty five bucks on this game so far

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Which you might want to point and laugh at me

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Fine ha ha go ahead

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
But I'm getting my money's worth

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
I'm playing the games quite a bit

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
They are cheaper than virtual console games

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
They are

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
And I'm having fun with it

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
You know like Bobby and I have had these friendly little competitions on some games

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
And you guys know Bradley

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Arcadian

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Dude did you know he was in the top twenty for Time Pilot earlier this week

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Really?

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Yeah he's pretty good at that stuff

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
He wiped my score on Mega Maniac

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
But I'm still number one

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
On Pitfall and Crystal Castles

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
So anyhow

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
I made it up to rank sixty eight

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
In Grand Theft Auto

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Did you? Well I thought you were sixty seven a couple weeks ago

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Yeah I keep losing the game here

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
It sucks because it takes me like twenty games

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
To get up a few ranks

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
And like all I have to do is lose to one person

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Not even lose the game

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Come in second, buy like a few bucks

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
And it drops me down a bunch

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
It's really unfair

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
But I'm doing pretty good

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
I haven't lost a game in a while

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Alright let's get to housekeeping tonight

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Of course our Twitter

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Twitter.com slash olr

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
We're going to get to the Twitter topics in a little bit

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
And then also our Facebook

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Please add us there

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Apparently we have a MySpace still too

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
But if I haven't added you to MySpace

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
I check it like maybe once every three months

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
So don't be sad

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Just send us a friend request there

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Although I ought to just delete it

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
But any promotion is good promotion I suppose

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Okay

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
So how about gaming news

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
We'll get into that a little bit

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Okay there's like

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
I don't know if you have anything you want to talk about Jamie

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
I know Loki's got a bunch

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
He was a good guy earlier and went through the show

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
There's like two things I want to talk about tonight

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
I'll start with the one that has been big today

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
And I think yesterday was when the buzz started

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Let's talk Rock Band 3

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Alright so here's what happened

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
The Green Day Rock Band demo

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Came out on Xbox Live and PlayStation

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
And you know it's got a couple songs

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
You can play and check out what Green Day Rock Band's all about

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
But the biggest splash of this

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Was that there is a teaser page

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
I guess at the very end of the demo

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
That shows you know how in

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Rock Band you have little icons

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
You have like a little guitar icon

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
A little bass icon, a little microphone for the singer

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
And little drums

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Well guess what next to all these icons

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
And the number three

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Is a little keyboard

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
And it looks like at first glance

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
They are going to add keyboards

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
To Rock Band 3

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
And when I first heard this news

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
I got really excited because

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
You know Orange Lawns Radio

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
We started as a music game based show

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
And we used to play games like

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Drummania, Guitar Freaks

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
And some of the games that inspired

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
You could say Rock Band in some ways

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Well the one I always loved

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
That I thought was really under appreciated

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Because they killed it off way too quick

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
After only three versions

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Which I know sounds like a lot but when you consider

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
2DX is on

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
19 or 19 is being tested right now

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
And then Guitar Freaks

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Is on like

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
16 or 17 I mean there is a crap ton of these games

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Keyboard Mania

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Which I was actually good at

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
I could beat the hardest song in the game

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
I couldn't do it on doubles

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
I guess that would really be the hardest mode in the game

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
We have a friend who is really good in doubles

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Oh yeah

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
I would like to think I was one of the better Keyboard Mania players

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
I could do it

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
I was good at it

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
I had to pick it up so I could play with you

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
And I was pissed when they discontinued it

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Because it was like the one Bomani game

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
I was actually pretty good at

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
So I heard this news about Rock Band 3

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
And I was like oh my god

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
They are actually going to do it

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
They are going to put out a keyboard

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Oh my god I'm like whoa this is going to be great

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
They are going to be great for this

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
I'm all excited right

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Well today I guess a news story came out that says

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Well

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
It might not actually be a keyboard

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
It might be a key-tar

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Meaning the guitar

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
And the keyboard mixed together

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Meaning like

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
If you see one of those old ass pictures

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Of like I don't know Journey

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
From the 80's with a big

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Hair

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Playing a keyboard on a guitar

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
They really needed to make it just a keyboard

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
I realize a lot of you think that's cool

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
This is how you freeze pop the game

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Or just any 80's

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Band practically had that

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
And I realize a lot of you think it's cool

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
But boy did that feel like

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
A punch in the stomach

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Like oh we are going to do this really cool thing

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
And then we are going to make it so stupid

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
By making it a key-tar

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Whatever I'll play it anyway

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
It's one of those things where

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
I could always just like put the key-tar

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
On the ground and do it that way

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
And just pretend I don't see the stem

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
But I don't know if that'll work

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
I'm thinking it's just screen real estate

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
How the hell are you going to do keyboards

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
With three other

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
How are you going to do a five person band

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Or even an eight person band

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Well let's see three singers

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Guitar

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Bass

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Drums and a keyboard

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
So you'd have a band of like

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
I have a feeling

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Call it a gut

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
But if they do key-tar I think it'll scroll

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Sideways

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
I think that's how they'll do it

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
They'll have vocals at top and key-tar on the bottom

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
And then the normal tracks in the middle

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
I have nothing to base that off of

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Obviously this is going to be at E3

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Obviously

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
And we'll know more then

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
But until then it's all speculation really

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Except for the fact that you know what

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Putting that little symbol of a keyboard in the game

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Is a question accomplished

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
People are talking rock band and oh what could this be

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Most importantly

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Something that Guitar Hero is not doing

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
That was good of them to keep this a secret

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
For a while because that way

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Now it's something to differentiate it from its biggest competitor

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Pretty smart

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
But you know

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
We shall see when we shall see

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Apparently there's something else in this too

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
About like there's going to be a mode

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
That's super difficult

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
But it's just to emulate like actual guitar

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
In drum playing or something

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
I'd heard something about that

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
So that could be interesting

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
What I would really most like to see

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Is them keep, especially for rock band

35:32.000 --> 35:36.000
Is them keep in the harmony

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
The three part harmony

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
That they had in Beatles rock band

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
I think they confirmed that

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
And one of the dudes slipped up at PAX East

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
I remember this happening because

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
My friends were there at that panel

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
He was there when the guy said

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Oh well rock band 3 has harmonies

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
And then they were all like shut up

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
It doesn't matter

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
It's confirmed because also

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
It's in Green Day rock band

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Oh because it's got the mic

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
And it's got three mics

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
I really really hope all the songs

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Are still backwards compatible

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
I don't expect them to go back

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
And add harmonies and keytar

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Or whatever they do to all of them

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
I would still be thrilled if at least

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
I could just have one massive library

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
It's gonna be one massive library

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Obviously the newer songs

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Will support newer things

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
It'll be interesting to see

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
What they do with the Green Day rock band

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Because those do support three part harmonies

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
I believe

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
I think it would be cool if they just went back

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
And maybe take the top

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
20 download songs

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Cause they know

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
What 20 songs have sold more

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Than any other

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Take the top 20 and add support

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Or maybe not all of them

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Would lend themselves very well to keytar

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Or harmony

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
So take the top 20 songs that would

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
And just go back and touch those up

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
That's gonna be enough to get people excited

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
People were speculating

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Because now that you have the three part harmonies

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
And keyboard

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Bohemian Rhapsody

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
That is hot

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
That is hot

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Just the fact that Queen could be in the game

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
At all, well actually I think there's a few songs

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
But just Bohemian Rhapsody would be amazing

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
I would really like to see

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
At least some of the Beatles rock band stuff carry over

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Is the Van Halen Guitar Hero thing exclusive

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Because you know if there's

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Guitar, you know if keyboards are in this

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
At all in any way shape

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Or form

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
It has to have jump

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
It has to have

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Do do do do do

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Like how can you have one of those plastic

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Keyboards sitting in your house and not want to play that

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
It's gonna be awesome

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
I'm definitely gonna be picking this up

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
One of the local stores here in Sacramento Guitar Center

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
I think that's a nationwide store

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
They actually had a sign up at one of their stores

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
By the keyboard display

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
That says, the following songs are

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Banned, if you play this song

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
You will be kicked out of the store

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Chopsticks

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Fur Elise

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
And jump

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
I'm surprised they don't have the axle fully themed

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
No stairway denied

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
It's that whole scene exactly

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
But for real

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Anyhow

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
I'm excited, I'm glad to see they're shaking it up

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Beyond just making it prettier

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
For Rock Band 3, that's gonna be pretty cool

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Another piece of plastic crap

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
To have in my house

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
I saw my instruments at work

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
In our game room

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
I don't have room in my little apartment

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
I already had to downsize for my house

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
I have bullshit everywhere

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Another plastic instrument is the last fucking thing

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
I need right now

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
The thing I love

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
And it's an awesome investment

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Was my drum bag

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Cause I can keep my drums and all the other stuff in there

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Except for the guitars, the guitars are separate

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
I have two guitars

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Or a guitar and a bass

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
I do need to get a new guitar though

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Cause it's crapping out

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Funny enough though

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Speaking of quality

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
The guitar 2 guitar that I still have

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Is fucking awesome

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
It still works great

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
The guitar 2 guitar I have works

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
And I did upgrade to a guitar hero 3

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Because a while back I was having enough friends

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Over where we needed to have a bass

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
So I just bought a guitar hero 3 guitar

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Cause they were really cheap

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
And now it's wireless, it works awesome

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
They're fine

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Hopefully now with mad cats

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Working on the actual instruments

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
I'm hoping that they'll be a little bit better

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
It's by mad cats

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
And I loved it

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
It's working really well

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
And please tell me my logic makes sense

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
That there will be a

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Game plus keyboard only pack

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
They're seeing that there's gonna be all sorts of

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Configurations

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
If you have like one thing then you can get this

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
And they're gonna do all sorts of different bundles

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Which will make it wonderfully confusing

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Then I'm happy

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Alright

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
The other big story I wanted to talk about

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
The armory

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
For World of Warcraft

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Is now available on the iPhone

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
I'm sorry not just the armory

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
But the auction house

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Oh cause I was gonna say I had the armory when I was playing

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Sorry I mean the auction house is now built into the armory

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
It's a beta test thing going on

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
That they just opened up to all realms a couple days ago

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
And you can now

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Manage basic auctions

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
From your iPhone

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
But it's a beta test because the plan is

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
This is going to be a pay feature

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
They're gonna charge I think they were saying

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
3, 4 bucks a month

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
I think it was 3 bucks a month

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
For this feature after the beta

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Test period is over which you guess is gonna be

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
What about 4 to 6 weeks

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
And I have to

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Admit I go back and forth on this

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Because when I first downloaded it and played with it

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
I was like this is clunky

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
This is kind of stupid

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
By the way it's not just I should say this

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
It's not just your iPhone

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
But you can do it on the web now if you go to the armory

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Website and I imagine if there's an armory

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
App for crack berries and androids

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Or whatever other smart phones there are

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
This feature is going to be built into this too

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
It's just a matter of time

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
But when I was playing with this on my iPhone

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Of course the day it came out I had to download it check it out

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
But when I was playing with the feature I have to admit I was like

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
This is kind of clunky

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
This is not that great

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
I can't have auctioneer

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
The add on I use to be able to undercut

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Everybody else this way

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
It's just not that great and I just kind of

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Wrote it off and said I'm not really going to use this

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
This is stupid whatever

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
If this is how Blizzard wants to waste their time then so be it

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
They'll be somebody that wants to use this

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
But then

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Damn it I found myself at work the other day

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
On lunch thank you very much

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
And I like to get away from my desk

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
At lunch because you know the last thing you want to do

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
During your free time is be at your desk

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Staring at your big pile of work to do

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
So I was in a little break room during lunch

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Eating my lunch and you know I'll kind of sit there

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
And play on my phone maybe look at a game

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Sure enough I go on the armory

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
And I start looking around

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
I managed to clear out my mailbox

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
That was full of sold auctions

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Relist some of the things that didn't sell

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
And just kind of manage all that

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
And clear out my inbox full of crap

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
On my lunch and I was just like

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Oh my god what am I doing

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
What am I doing

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
I'm like playing World of Warcraft

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Without being at home

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
This is terrible

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
That's bad it's bad

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Anyhow

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
It's not something

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Extra that I can't already

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Get in the game and therefore

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
I don't see worth paying three dollars

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
A month is really something I want to

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Do I mean I guess there's people

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
That are more into the economics that want to do

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
This stuff and if they want to pay for it then so

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Be it whatever it's a feature I

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Just will not be one of them because I don't think I

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Should have that on my phone to be honest

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
I just don't think I should have that

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
It's not a good thing to have

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Now thankfully

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
And I say it's kind of a double-edged sword

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Because you know it's well

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
I'm glad

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
There's not any additional

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Game features like something extra

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Because then I'd feel a little bit jilted

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Because I still held to what I said

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
A couple weeks ago on this show

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
The minute Blizzard starts selling

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Epics for money I'm out

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
I quit I'm deleting my account well

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Resigning whatever that day

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Notice how I can't say I'll delete my account

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Because it's too much work but I will resign my

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Warcraft membership that day it's done

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Um

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
I just can't justify

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
That and I really

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Hope that's not where they're going I'm a little worried

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Did you notice how all this started I mean maybe

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
It's just me maybe I can I'm a conspiracy

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Theorist and what have you call me whatever

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Names you want but

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Is it just me or did all this nickel and dime stuff

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Start happening once Activision bought them

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
I don't think it's just you Rob

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
This all kind of like

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
The sparkle pony

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
The money for faction transfers

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
And all these things

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
And changing your genders and appearance and all this

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
This all started happening when the

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Activision guys came in they swear

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Up and down they're not going to sell epics for money

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
I really really hope

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
That's the case because it's

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
It's like starting to push the boundaries a little bit

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
You know what I mean but whatever

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
If you want to pay the money and this is a good feature

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
For you have fun but

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
I just you know I can't install auctioneer on my phone

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
So whatever

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
And that was really it those

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Are the two big stories I have some other little things

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
I can get to but low key I don't

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
Know what big news stories jumped out at you the past

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Few days if there's anything you want to jump in at

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Uh yeah one thing I want to

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Talk about and it's absolutely

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Annoying because I have to deal with this on a daily

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Basis now is

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
The what people are calling

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Because I guess EA coined

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
The phrase for their stuff

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Project ten dollar

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
And project ten dollar is different ways

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
That EA can make money off of you basically

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
And the one that's really

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
I guess the most recent way

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
They've decided is that they're

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Going to have one time

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Codes with their um

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Sports games starting off

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
That allow you to play online

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
If you buy the game used

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
You have to pay ten dollars

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
To be able to play

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
The game we talked about this last week

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
I understand that but I'm getting into more stuff

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Oh dear oh god alright

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Okay so I'm sitting here going

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Deja vu no no no

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
There's more stuff we're gonna talk about here

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Alright um so

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Yeah thankfully they have the seven

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Day trial and that's peachy

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
And stuff for video rentals or game

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Rental stores or whatever well that is cool

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Um something that's cool

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
And they're the only ones doing that

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Uh THQ on the other hand

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Is now they by the way

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Weren't gonna mention anything until the day

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Of release for UFC

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Um but it UFC

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Had leaked out so unfortunately

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
People found out of it or found out about it

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
They're doing something similar except they're

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Charging five dollars there is no trial

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
So if you buy the game used you ought to play

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
You know five dollars

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
In order to be able to play online

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Then there was another one

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
I found out about today

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Another company which

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
I'm just shocked that they're

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Jumping on board with this but

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Um apparently Microsoft

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
With Crackdown 2

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Will be jumping aboard this um

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
New trend and they will be having a

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
One time fee wait wait wait

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Wait wait why

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Am I paying for Xbox Live?

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Why?

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
If this is if every publisher

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Is gonna think because you know

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Now this is just the little

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Leak in the dam and it's all gonna come crumbling

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Down after this why am I paying for

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Xbox Live and another story that

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
You know sorry if you're gonna get to this later but I know this is big

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Playstation Network

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Is just everybody's waiting for them to say

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Something at E3 this year

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
That there's going to be a Playstation Network Plus

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Or what have you

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Why am I paying for these services now?

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
If this is the new way I'm gonna have to pay to play online

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Please do not tell me I need both

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Xbox Live and the code to play Crackdown

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Cause that seems ridiculous

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
You do um

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Oh my god

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
But it's only gonna affect you if you buy

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Used but I still think it's fucked up

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
That they're double dipping with them

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
You know this stuff they think that they're entitled

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
To a part of the used sales I'm sorry

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Any other industry you're not

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Entitled to used sales if I buy

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
A used car I don't have to pay a hundred dollars

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
To like Ford or something for buying

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
My used car you've already made your fucking

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Money and there's like

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
You know EAs excuses

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Oh well we're improving our online

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Services and we're able to offer you

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
More you know download

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Content and stuff like that yeah more paid

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Download content that I have to buy from you

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
It's just

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
It's awful

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
You know to sit here and say I'm not

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Gonna pay for online play would be hypocritical

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Because I pay twelve dollars or no fourteen dollars

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Whatever it is I don't even know

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
To play wow you know

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
That's fine I don't have a problem

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Paying to play online I have a

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Problem paying twice and I

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Have a problem paying like all

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
These different uncontrolled amounts now

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Which okay maybe is a little bit

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Hypocritical because of the MMOs

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
But generally you know an MMO is gonna cost you

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
And between ten and fifteen

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
But it's just now there's no

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Fucking control anywhere with this

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
And it really bothers me

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
I need to hear from Microsoft

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
At E3 why I should renew my

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Xbox Live membership because at this point

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
I'm not going to

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
And I've been a member for like six years now

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
And I'm hoping that there's some sort of misunderstanding

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
But here's how it came about

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
We had a head of a company

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Might have been Blockbuster Chain

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Or something like that

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
They were asking about Crackdown 2

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
They were saying well the first Crackdown game was

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Online only and you know

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
I just wanted to make sure there's a single player aspect

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
To this one and you know of course I was like

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Well no the first game actually wasn't online only

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
And you know

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
There will be multiplayer and that kind of stuff

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
I highly doubt that

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Microsoft would jump on board with

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
What they're doing with EA and stuff

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Because they're already making money off Live

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Our buyer checked with Microsoft

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
And they're like that's correct

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
There is going to be

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
There's a single player and online

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
And there will be a one time code

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Wait is this the internet or are you like

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Breaking news here? No I'm breaking news

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Oh shit

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Huh

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
So casually too

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
I know right like

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
He didn't say secret club or nothing this is just out there

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Alright so I mean I'm hoping

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
That there's a misunderstanding

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Ok so yeah take with a grain of salt because

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
We're not talking about hardcore

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Game players with this right

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
We're talking about business people who might be

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Oopsie doopsieing the facts right

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Yes and I'm thinking I'm hoping

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
That the one time code thing is similar

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
To what we've seen with some of the other games

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Like Alan Wake and

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
You know Gears of War 2

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
And stuff like that where the one time code is

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Download content it's free download content

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
At launch something like that

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
I'm retracting my clause

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
I'm retracting my clause

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
And hoping one of your coworkers is

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Fucking up big time

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
But if it isn't then that's basically

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Going to open floodgates because

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
If Microsoft's doing it then everybody's

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Going to do it because they've basically

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Been given permission to

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
So I hope

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
That's not the case but you know once again

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
You know I blame a lot of these people

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
That just don't stand up and

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Complain about this stuff you know

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
They're like oh that's no big deal because you know

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
I'm getting the game used or whatever

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
And you know it's just a few extra dollars

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Well you know what it's stuff like this

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
See you feel it's okay

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
With different things and now they're going to all

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Start doing it and pretty soon it's just

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Going to be something else what else are they going to take out

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Of their game that they're going to charge you five dollars for

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
You know

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
It's just it's stupid

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
And they're not lowering the price of the game by five dollars

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Of course not

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
I don't know

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Yeah I worry about

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
The precedent this might set

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
I understand why EA's

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Doing this ten dollar thing and I think we talked about

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
This last week and of course other companies

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Are going to follow but you know my two biggest

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Issues are A

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
It's not going to stop there

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Like Loki's saying and B

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
I don't want to have to pay for it twice

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
They need to work it out where

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
The one source is am I paying Microsoft

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Or am I paying the publishers for this

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Who's really hosting the servers

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
And it's absolutely bullshit that they're saying that

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
You know oh well it's because

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
We're devl- like THQ's

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Wonderful official

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Statement about it THQ is delivering

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
A truly unmatched online gaming

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Experience for fans of UFC and across all

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Oh shut up

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Bullshit uh the main enhancement

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Of UFC and disputed 2010's

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Premium online content is a new

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Fight camp mode in which players can assemble

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Ranks up to forty people and train

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Together the significant value add

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Um value

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Add to the game as uh

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Players can uh continually

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Improve their skills by training

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
With friends and bringing teams from

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
MMA specialists together you know what

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Though you could have done that and included

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
That with the game as it is so now you're

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
Just basically making an excuse because

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
EA's doing it fuck you EA

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
You know I you were on a good streak for

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
A while there Activision was really making

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
You know themselves look like shit

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
We're all gonna do it but here

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Here you go you know might as well

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
I'm sure Bobby Kotick's

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Eyes are lighting up

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Hey we can charge money for that

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Uh do you have the story up on PSN Plus

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Out of curiosity?

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Uh yeah I do

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Can you talk about that a little bit?

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Yes so people are basically um

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Saying that in fact actually the

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Sony Computer Entertainment Europe

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
President has been alluding that they're gonna

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Be doing um upcoming paid

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Uh Playstation Network subscriptions

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
And uh

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Of course they won't officially comment on it

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
It says will Playstation Network

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Become a paying service

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Um Kazrai stated

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
A few months ago that we were looking at

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Premium services sit alongside the current

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Free service

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
And that um objective has not

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Changed you'll learn more about it very soon

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
So yes they are doing that

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
And uh if I'm hearing it right

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
They're saying we're not gonna charge you to play

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Games online

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
I'm just trying

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
To think what could this possibly be

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Besides like core you know what I mean

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Like I thought core was kind of their

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Plus thing with the demos and the

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Little things that come with that

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Is that just an enhancement of that?

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Um from what I remember the rumors

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Have been saying that it's supposed to have

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Exclusive access to

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Cross game voice chat which

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
You can do for free in Microsoft service

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Um it's also

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
They're gonna say that they're gonna be um

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Including I guess some sort of

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Cloud based saving system

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Um I was reading

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
That they're also supposed to be I think offering

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Uh the ability to

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Uh purchase

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
A full title of a game first

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Also they'll be able to play the first hour of download

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Games for free Yeah that's interesting

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
I'd heard that one something about you can download

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
The whole stinking game and play

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Like an like every Blu-ray

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Game will basically have a demo for an hour

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Like I don't even know how that works

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
I don't know if that's wishful thinking or what

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Am I I think I'd seen something

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
This is probably another rumor fanboy

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Wank or whatever but I'd seen something about

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Playstation 1 games are just gonna be

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Fucking play whatever you want

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
They're gonna have a rotating

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
A rotating list of PSP minis

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
And Playstation 1 classics, exclusive

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
In game download content, discounts

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
To the Playstation store

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Um

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
So stuff like that

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Maybe, maybe, I definitely

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Want to hear more about it, I mean I

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
We need to separate the fanboy wank from the reality

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
But there's some interesting features in there

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
I can tell you right now when you pay him for this, I don't play on the Playstation

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Never good enough But now, well now

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
I'm paying for Xbox Live

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
And if this, if, if, if, if, big if

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Capital I, capital F, if

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
It is true that

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Crackdown is gonna do the double dip thing

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
And I don't hear

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
From Microsoft what the hell I'm paying for anymore

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Are you buying Crackdown

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Used, that's the thing, if you're buying it

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Used, then yeah it's double dipping

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
If you're buying it new, you get the code

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
You can play the thing

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
So, I don't know

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Still why am I paying for Xbox Live

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
You know

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
It's still, it's really

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Kind of a lame thing to be doing because

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
They're like saying, oh we deserve a portion of

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Your used sales, and fuck you GameStop

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
For being okay with this shit

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
I mean why, you're the biggest fucking

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Company out there as far as retail

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
You know they're not

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
They're just, they have no choice

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Nah, I'll get into more of that

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Why I think they're doing

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
What they're doing and why they're so gung ho

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
About it anyway

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Please, I want to hear that next, next time

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Okay, so fuck them

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Freeform tonight, I get what I want

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Fuck them for being just okay about this

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Wait, wait, wait, surely you have an opinion

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
What do you think about this whole like

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
PlayStation Network Plus

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
And the Crackdown rumor

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Do you have any thoughts

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Not yet

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Would you pay for a service where you could

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Just go in and play any PlayStation 1 game

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
You wanted

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Depends

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Depends on, I mean, if it was

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Any game, any at all

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Ever

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Maybe

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
But I don't need to because I have

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
The vault

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Okay

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
So fuck them for going along with this and basically

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Saying, oh yeah, we think it's a great idea

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Yeah, you know why you think it's a great idea?

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Because you're going to start selling download content soon

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
And you're cashing in on that

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
And basically Microsoft is

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Saying, hey, you know what

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
We're going to give you some back end

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Rebates from this stuff

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
I don't know

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
They may be changing their tune too

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
When you look at some of these games

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
That you basically sell them for 30 bucks

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
They turn around and sell it for 55 dollars

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
And then they're going to charge me 10 dollars

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
On top of that to, you know

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Say, for example, buy

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
You know, multiplayer online

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
You know, I'm paying basically 5 dollars

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
More than the price of a new game

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
So I'm going to be buying a new game

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Obviously, if I'm really interested in that

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Or I just won't play online

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Thankfully

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
A lot of the games, if I were to ever buy them used

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
I probably wouldn't be playing them online

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
I don't play a lot of stuff online

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
I don't know

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
It's really awful

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Alright, get to the other thing

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
About GameStop

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
That's why I already went to that

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Because they're going to be selling download content

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
That was it

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
Sorry, I don't know if that's alright

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
No, I had heard that

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
I had heard that rumor a little bit before

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
I just can't see

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Walking into GameStop to get

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
The download content

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Being able to

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Sample it in the store or whatever

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
On their little kiosks

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
It's just like Amazon

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
How you can buy stuff off Amazon

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
And get the codes and stuff like that

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
But sometimes you want to go to the mall

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
I get that, but I don't know

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
It's weird

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Alright, what else

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
How about another story

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
Then maybe we'll do release dates

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Scratch the Ultimate DJ

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Coming to iPhone, iPad

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
And the PC

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
They're still working on I guess the console versions

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
As well according to Newmark

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
But they are going to be out

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
On those three platforms later this year

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
It looks kind of weird though

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
I can't imagine playing this game on an iPad

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Or something, very awkward

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
They have turntables in the

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Upper corners and then the five keys

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
On the bottom and a crossfader

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Just above those keys

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Little complex

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
The PC version though will actually have a controller for it

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
So that will be interesting to see

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
Um

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
But apparently

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
You know, I guess

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
It kind of sucks that the whole game was held up

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Because of the whole lawsuit with

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Activision and stuff

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Which we never really heard what happened with that

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Have they settled or what

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Uh, whatever um

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Happened to the console release

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Is that still tied up in the lawsuit?

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
It says the console versions

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Are still in development

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
And the PC version will use a special controller

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Interesting

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Yeah

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Alright

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Um, how about release dates?

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Do you want to do some release dates?

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
That sounds like fun. Sure. Alright

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Do you have Europe ones? I do.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Jamie, why don't we start with you?

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
We haven't heard your lovely voice in a few minutes

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Okay

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Yeah, go for it. Why not?

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Alright, well then um

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
It's really just a few things

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
On the uh

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Well, today, the 26th

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Pure Football

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
I thought it was called Project Catwalk over there

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Make it work

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Critical Blur UFC

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Um, well, there's a few things

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
coming out this week

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000

That's on the DS

Mind Over Matter, another

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Bane training

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Brain training puzzle game

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
coming out on DS as well

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Backbreaker coming out on

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Xbox 360 and Playstation 3

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
That's one of those independent football games

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Alpha Protocol on

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000

Pure Football

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
on Playstation 3

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
and Xbox 360 this week

America's Next Top Model

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
on DS and

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
on the Wii

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
That's exciting

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Hope Crazy Tyra's in it

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Diamond Trust

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
of London

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
It's a strategy game on the DS

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
That's nice, I guess

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Bass Pro Shops

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
The Hunt, yet another

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
deer hunting game

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
That's on the Wii and Xbox 360

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
and the Wii, of course, getting a gun bundle

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
because those people that own Wiis

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
love guns

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
And, um

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
What else do we have here?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Call of Duty The War Collection

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
is a re-release of three Call of Duty

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
World War II games on

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Xbox 360, I believe two, three in World at War

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Uh

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Let's see here, Prince of Persia The Forgotten

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Sands on PC, I guess it was a few weeks late

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
And that's

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
that's basically it

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Alright

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Oh, Syphon Filter is Logan's

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Shadow on Playstation 2

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Yes, they're still making Playstation 2 games

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Yes, they're still ports of

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
PSP game, right?

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Uh, going to Japan

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
These releases are for June 3rd, we're not gonna be live again

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
until June 6th, and I didn't see a lot for May

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
So let's go to June 3rd releases for Japan, okay?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Some price reductions on Gears of War 2

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
on the 360, Gundam Musou 2

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
and Tales of Vesperia

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Again, these are June 3rd releases I'm doing today

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Uh, going to the

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Playstation 3

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Also, some more price reductions

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Gundam Musou 2 and Katamari Damacy Tribute

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
which I believe is, uh, Katamari

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
What do they call it, Forever here?

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
I don't know that game and I can't remember

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Uh, nothing really notable on the Wii

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
This is kind of a dry period over there

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I don't know if there's, you know, just not the season

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
but it's mostly price reductions going on in Japan right now

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Uh, same thing when you look at the PS2

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Gundam Musou 2, Mobile Suit Gundam

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
games going on sale

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Uh, Nintendo DS

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
another Pachinko game comes out

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Kaiden Restaurant Ura menu, 100-sen

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
I don't know if that's like 100 different things

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
on the menu or what, but that is coming out on the DS

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
and then on the PSP

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
100-sen

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Is that the 100 classic books thing or?

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
From Nintendo?

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
No, because it's Kaiden Restaurant

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
I don't think that's it

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
No, there's like a little happy ghost on the cover

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
It's a horror buffet

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
with chilling blood curdling

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
and creepy stories as dishes

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Maybe it is, 100 tales for you to order

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Choose the one that suits your mood

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Vampires, ghosts, psychopath killers

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
These characters fill the cartridge and all you have to do

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
is order them to come out

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
That sounds creepy

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
It's like Silent Hill, but you read it

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Uh, and then lastly

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
on the PSP

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Bleach, Heat the Soul 6

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
gets a price reduction

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
and probably the only new game I'm seeing on this whole list

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Fairy Tale, Portable Guild

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
is coming out this week from Konami

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
on June 3rd, next week

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
There you go, Japanese releases, there you have it

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Uh, let's do a

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
couple stories and then we'll get into

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
other topics

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
and we'll do the mailbag and all that other fun stuff too

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Um, let me

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
I'll tackle a couple things here

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
that I wanted to touch on

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
that rolled over from what we were going to do on Sunday

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Uh, Facebook and Zynga

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Kiss... Zynga? Zynga?

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Farmville, people

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
They kissed and made up

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
They had make-up sex

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
and everything's better. Remember how they were threatened

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Remember how Zynga, Zynga, Zynga

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
was threatening to leave and like, we're going to take Farmville

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
to their own damn website and I said, it'll never work

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
It'll never work

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Well, they came to their senses and they kissed and made up

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
and they have committed to their

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
long-term relationship

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
and, um, meaning that I guess

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
for years and years, they're going to

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
basically, Zynga got a deal on that

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Facebook credit thing, you know that's how it works out

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Did you hear something else about them too?

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
What's that? They're teaming up with Yahoo

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
and they're going to have all their games on Yahoo as well

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Um, they're going to be integrated into

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
all their different web pages and stuff

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
It's not the same. Yahoo already has

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
a gaming portal

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
A lot of the PopCap stuff and all that's on

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
What were the games?

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I actually used to play some games on there

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
There's like a Scrabble-type game on there

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
and the freaking whiteboard game

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
It was like Pictionary

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
and everybody drew dirty fucking pictures in that game

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
I can't remember the name of it

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Yeah, I even played some of those games before

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Whatever

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
It's not Facebook

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
If you can't collect the things and post

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
them to your wall so you can prove

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
that you have the biggest E-peen farm

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
that you're farming all the E-peen in the land

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
then

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
The part where I

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
banged my head against the wall

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
was when I saw the Farmville cards for sale

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
at like 7-11

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
There was like little $10 Farmville cards, I was like

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Oh my god. Did you see the Farmville ice cream?

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Oh god, yeah, I heard something

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
about that, like there's Farmville ice cream

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
and Farmville...

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Slurpees or something? Oh god

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
No, do not want

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
It's all fattening anyway

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Ice cream is bad for you

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
It makes you fat

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
This is why you're fat

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Alright, the website

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
I wasn't saying that to you, Loki

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
I thought this was an interesting story too

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
that had to do with Epic

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
and a comment they made this

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
week, or this past week

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
about piracy

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
And they basically said that

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
6 years ago, Epic was a PC

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
company, but because

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
of piracy, they went to

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
consoles. We did one

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
PS2 launch title and everything else was PC

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
and now people are saying, why do you

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
hate the PC? You're a console only company

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
It's because the money's on

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
consoles. That's from President

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Mike Capps

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
We still do PC, we still love

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
the PC, but we already saw the impact of

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
piracy. It killed a lot of great

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
independent developers and completely

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
changed our business model

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
And then it goes on to talk a little bit about Steam

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
and how Steam is essentially single-handedly

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
really helping

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
breathe life into PC gaming

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
because piracy is just driving it bankrupt

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Any thoughts on that, Loki?

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Not that I'm insinuating that you're a pirate or anything

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
but I know you usually have strong feelings about

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
these types of topics

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
There's piracy on any

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
platform, regardless of PC

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Xbox 360

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
handhelds

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
other consoles

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
It's easier to do on PC

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
so I guess that's

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
true, but

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
they're facing piracy everywhere

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Is that really an excuse?

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
I think it's because they can charge more for their

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
games, but

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
whatever

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Good for you

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
You're a console developer

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
now

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Do you want me to pat you on the back or something?

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Really?

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Alright, one other story and then I'll let Loki take over

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
for a little bit. BlizzCon tickets

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
on sale

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
June 2nd and June 5th

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
$150 if you want to go

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
and the con is in October

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
October 22nd and 23rd

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
You know what, DarkSakura? I think you and I

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
should go down to Anaheim on October 22nd

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
and 23rd and go to Disneyland

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Fuck BlizzCon

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
$150?

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
No thank you. The 22nd and 23rd

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
October

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Except I'll be going to Alabama right after

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
No, I'll be going to Alabama in November

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I haven't done Disney with Jamie in a while

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
I've done Disney with other people, not Jamie

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
It's been a little while

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Here's my thing

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
You might be thinking, what the hell, Rob?

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
You're like the biggest wow addict on that show

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
and why are you all hating on BlizzCon?

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
A, they want

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
$150

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
What am I getting?

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Cataclysm ought to be out by then

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
I mean, and if it's not

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Damn, they're moving slow

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
When is it again? October 22nd and 23rd

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Well, they did release the last expansion

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
I want to say, or there was one of expansions

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
that was released in November, so

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Yeah, but Burning Crusade

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
was out in like January

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Well, then that's both after October

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Look, it's World of Warcraft

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Blizzard can release it

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
whenever the fuck they want

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
They could release it on Christmas Eve

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
and nerds would be out in force to get there

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
and be the first

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
It doesn't matter, it's Blizzard

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
They can do what they want

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Look, I understand

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
They got to recoup their costs

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
They do some big stuff for this

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Whatever, it's a pretty big effing deal

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Am I going to get to be the first to play

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
their new MMO?

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Which is the rumor that they have a type of

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
action-ish MMO that's in the works

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
I think the last rumor I heard

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
was like a spy, espionage-y type of game

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
might be their next MMO

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
So, the agency?

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
I don't know, I don't know

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Rumor, huge fan wank rumor, don't quote me

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
And I imagine Diablo 3

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
is going to be playable

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
but $150?

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
I'd rather ride Space Mountain

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
three times in a row, what?

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Dude, I'd just rather ride Space Mountain

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
period, instead of like

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
almost anything

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Yep, so maybe

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
we'll walk out front of the convention center

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
like when we

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
when we get bored

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
we'll go walk over to the convention center

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
I don't know how we're going to get bored at Disneyland

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
but let's just hypothesize that every ride we want to go on

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
is broken

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
We'll go walk outside the convention center

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
and look at the people and go

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
So, how's it going?

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Be like, hey y'all

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
we're going to go on

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
on the Matterhorn

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
have fun waiting in line

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
You might be able to get in as a press

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
maybe

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Is it bad to say

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
that again, I would just

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
the convention center

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
let me put this in perspective, if you've never been to Anaheim

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
the convention center is literally

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
two blocks from Disneyland

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
You can walk there, it's not that bad

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I mean, with all the walking you do at Disneyland in a day

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
I don't get why you drive anyway

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
You can

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
especially California Adventure is like right there

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
it's the first park you hit moving that direction

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
I know that

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
You could

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
literally walk to Disneyland

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
and if I'm going to be that close, I've got to go

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Maybe I should be doing a Disney podcast

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
I don't know

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
I might feel a little more

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
excited if I knew

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
what games I was going to get to see

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
but Starcraft 2 is out in July

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
so maybe one of the future expansions

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
but I'm not a Starcraft person anyway

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I'm assuming it's all about Diablo 3

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
and I guess

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Cataclysm if it's still not out

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
but it's got to be in beta by that point

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
so people are already playing it

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
maybe they'll announce another

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Warcraft expansion

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
I mean, I don't know

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
I could go off on a tangent about this

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
maybe this isn't the right forum

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
but I kind of think Cataclysm

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
is less of an expansion

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm very excited for Cataclysm

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
it sounds like an exciting expansion

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
but I think this is the

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
closest you're going to get

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
to WoW 2.0

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
like, they're literally going back

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
and upgrading the old game

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
and they're using the Cataclysm as the retcon to do it

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
so it's kind of like

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
you're getting a little less of an upgrade

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
with all this new stuff

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
as you're just getting your old stuff enhanced

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
to be competitive with newer releases

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
does that make sense?

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
so I wouldn't be surprised at all if another expansion

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
comes pretty quickly afterwards

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
the actual expansion

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
where you go out to a new area

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
and all this stuff

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
and the additional five levels you didn't see in this first expansion

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
but that's just

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
you know, again

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
fanboy wank

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
are they raising it in level cap again?

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
to 85, but not to 90

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
which is, you know, fine, whatever

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
but it just kind of makes me think

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
that they already have another expansion

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
planned that will take it to 90

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
I ultimately think WoW will stop at 100

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
level 100 seems to be a nice

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
even round number, but we'll see

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
again

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
fanboy wank, nothing more

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Loki, what do you got for us?

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
apparently

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Edge is reporting

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
that Project Natal

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
will

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
be out for

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
$150

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
and October 26

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
give or take a few weeks

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
didn't they say 100 bucks?

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
oh no, that was a Playstation move

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
I

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
I don't think

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
I would hope that they're smart enough

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
not to put it out for that price

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
that's how much a week costs, isn't it?

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
yeah, and they're also

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
basically

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
the Xbox, well we know that

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
a slim Xbox is coming out

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
so perhaps

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
they're going to be bundling with that

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
and they're saying that they're going to be bundling

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
with the new Xbox 360

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
for $300

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
I don't know

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
it seems awfully high

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
I know the technology is probably great

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
and all, but

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
they've got to have learned

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
something from Sony, if you put it out

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
at that kind of price point

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
no one's going to pick it up

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
you've got a few people picking it up, but no one's

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
going to really jump on board with it because

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
I can get a Wii for that price

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
but, if there's some

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
kick my ass amazing, blow

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
my hair back game

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
I might pay it

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
a system is only as good as the games that are on it

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
and the advantage of this

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
over the Playstation Move

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
is that you have to buy this

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
and you're done

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
there's no additional controllers you have to buy

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
because you're basically the controller

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
so it works up to

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
do you think maybe that's their leverage?

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
they're going to come out and say yes, it's $150

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
but maybe they're going to do a price comparison

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
and they'll say, if you want to buy

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
the Wii for the whole family to play

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
that actually costs you

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
$150 plus what?

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
$40 plus $40 plus $40, right?

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
it's $40 plus

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
actually because you're going to need nunchucks probably

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
so $40 plus $20

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
so $60, so a lot

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
another $180 on top of that

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
alright, so a lot, but they're going to say

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
that's going to be their leverage, they're going to come out and say

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
to buy the Xbox 360

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Natal for the whole family

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
$300 and it plays DVDs

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
and it does Netflix out of the box

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
and...

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
all this stuff

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
I can see it

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
again, if they have

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
the game to justify it

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
then

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
they'll get away with it

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
I think it needs to be sub $100

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
but that's just me

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
I would say they should

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
put it out for $99.99

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
you know what they should do?

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
here's how they would sell a million copies

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
you ready?

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
no joke, you guys are going to hate me

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
for this, all the people listening

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
are going to cringe, but I'll tell you what

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
they would sell a million copies of this

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
you ready?

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
the biggest loser video game

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
the whole family can play

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Project Natal

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
so it's like

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
a competitor to Wii Fit based off that

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
TV show

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
it would sell like crazy

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
number one

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
they put it out on the Wii

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
pretty successful, because it came out last October

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
and it sold pretty well

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
it's already out

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
and it was okay

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
but it's not a system seller

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
and yeah, I understand there's going to be

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
all those kind of party games

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
and fitness games and stuff like that

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
and it's going to suck

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
because there's going to be a ton of these crappy games

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
coming up, but that doesn't really affect me

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
too much because you don't have to buy them, obviously

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
it's just really how much is the hardware going to cost

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
that's really the thing I'm interested to find out

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
but

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
I will find out in a few weeks

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
I'm sure they're going to say a price point

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
they better say a price point

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
E3 is kind of the time you lay it all out on the table

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
for the holidays

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
I would expect

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
you may not get specific dates

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
but you're going to get

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
I think you'll get prices and you're going to get a pretty good

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
understanding of what that blow your hair back game is

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
that they're putting behind

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
whether it be Fable 3, the Milo thing

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
and I said that

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
a long time ago, it's going to be Gears 3

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
I did, remember?

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
I said, because they were hiding

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
that game for the longest time

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Gears is a pretty successful franchise

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
and they just recently announced Gears 3

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
and I think it's gotten a top support

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Here's the other thing I'm thinking

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
though, is that

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
one of the

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
I guess conspiracy theories about it was

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
that they were saying that they originally

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
were remembering that it was going to be like 50 bucks

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
for the game, for the actual thing

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
and that now they're

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
putting out this rumor that it's going to be $150

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
so they can come back and put it out

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
for $99, so those people are hoping

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
that it was $50 aren't as

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
disappointed, you know, whereas the people

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
that thought it was going to be $150 are like, hey!

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Now it's only $99, that's awesome!

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
I don't know

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
If they do come out with Natal support for Gears of War 3

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
at E3, I want to be called

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
from here on out, games analyst

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Rob Roberts, games analyst

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
If I'm wrong

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
then I'm just some dickhead with a podcast

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
which is what I've always been, nothing new

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
You could be Robert Patrick, stupid Michael Patrick

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
I want to go on record saying

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Michael Patrick's a fucking douchebag

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
and the reason why, because he just throws out guesses

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
and yet people come

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
That's what we do!

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
I understand that, but people fucking run

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
It's like if he comes out on his balcony

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
to the game of press

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
He's like the pope

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Pretty much, he walks out

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
writes his declaration

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
and then goes back to

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
I think this holiday season

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
game consoles will do well

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
and everybody reports it like

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Oh my god, he said something!

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Game consoles do well! Michael Patrick says so!

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Oh my god!

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Women fainting

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
I just don't understand

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
why people have

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
This is why, other than complaining about him

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
I will never mention any analyst

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
I don't give a shit what an analyst

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
thinks

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Who cares? If that's your job, great

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
I don't go asking meteorologists

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
what the weather is going to be like

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Because they're not always right

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Would it be wrong for us to put

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
in the description of our podcast

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
three games analysts

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
conquer the video game news

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
every week

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
You don't really have to have a degree to call yourself an analyst

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
You just have to analyze the market

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
We've been doing that for eight years

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
That's on the job

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
experience, right?

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Dark Soccer, you know this

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
legal stuff better than I do

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Can I call myself a games analyst?

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
You can call yourself whatever you want

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
There you go

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Orange Lounge Radio brought to you by three expert

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
games analysts

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
every week

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
We've been analyzing the industry for eight years

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
I will go as far as saying I'm the most

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
expert analyst of them all

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
That's my opinion

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
I am the most expert analyst ever

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
We are the most smartest

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
games analysts out there

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
The most expertest

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
I'm the smartest of them all

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Another news story

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
please, before our egos

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
inflate anymore

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Michael Patrick's coming out on the balcony again

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Oh my god!

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
What's he saying?

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Madden 11 will sell a lot

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Oh my god!

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Oh my god!

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
It's the holy word

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
God's awful

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
I just don't understand

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
I hate me because it's true

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
I hate you because it's true

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Mama, what have you done now?

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
That's right

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Babysitting mama

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
including your very own plush baby

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
which you shove a remote down its throat

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
in order to play

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
I kid you not

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Really?

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Yes, really, that's right

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
It uses a plush baby in which you have

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
tucked a Wii remote inside

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
also using the nunchuck that is somehow hanging out

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
of the plush baby somehow

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
You play 40 mini games

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
and the usual cookie mama style

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
and representing feeding

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
changing the baby, rocking it to sleep

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
and six different

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
virtual babies, each with their unique personalities

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
So if the baby shits

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
everywhere, then don't worry, mama will

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
fix it

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
I don't know

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Oh, you wanted a girl? Don't worry, mama

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
will fix it

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Don't worry, Dr. 90210

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
will fix it I don't know

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
It's weird, they did have a game

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
come out like this

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
I think it's called

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
My Baby There was a story

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
It was on an Australian blog

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
It was a Twitter topic one week

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
I remember that Yes

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
The character of the baby doll

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Oh my gosh

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
And it's also like that Wiiwa thing, remember the doll?

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Yeah, I remember Wiiwa, did the Wiiwa ever come out?

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Not yet

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Oh, it's interesting

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
But that's going to be weird that you have to have a baby doll

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Not a damn person

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
listening to this show is ever going to play that game

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
It is cooking mama

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Dark Sakura is the biggest

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
fan of cooking mama, I know

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Dark Sakura, babysitting mama, yes or no?

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
I have a great idea No

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
No, no, no, I have the greatest idea

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
She's lip the baby, high heat

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
She's a games analyst

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Loki, and she says

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
it's just not interesting

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
We should have a contest with this game

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
I'm telling you

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
The contest is, and this is great, you're going to love this

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
The contest is

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
to photograph your best

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
baby mama

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
not baby mama, yeah

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Baby mama? They should have done it

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Is that the babysitting mama? Baby mama

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Anyways, um

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
No, the best babysitting mama

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
baby analog you could create

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
So, I mean, because basically

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
the Wii remote has to go into something

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
It doesn't necessarily have to be this

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
doll, unless the doll is actually going to have

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
a cord or something that's coming out of it

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
that you can plug into your Wii remote

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
and actually going to be its own controller

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
but assuming that it's not, it's just going to be some stuff thing

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
We should have people, like, take

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
other stuff things or

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
take your own baby out of whatever you have lying around your house

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
and that might be funny

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
and take pictures

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
playing the game with it

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
That's, that's

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
the game that we need to have

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
instead of, uh, uh

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Cookie Mama or whatever, we need to have

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
this one

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Not who that is

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Not who that is

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Not who that is

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Not who she is

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Why is it always the same old thing?

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Y'all knew that

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
joke was coming, come on

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
You knew it, you knew it, don't sigh

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Don't sigh at me

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
It's grown, Rob, it's grown because I knew

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
I got a quickie story of something you might hear

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
at E3, or you might not, I don't know

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
but apparently there are rumors going around

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
rumors abounding that Final Fantasy 13

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
versus may actually

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
release on the Xbox 360

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Apparently that's something Squeenix is looking

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
into

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Yeah, because Final Fantasy 13 did pretty well

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
so where the money is, they will follow

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
The answer will be at E3

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Just dropping that little tidbit out there

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Also one other little tidbit I wanted to drop

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
just because I thought this was cool

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Top Gun apparently is coming to Playstation Network

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
There's, not, not the movie

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
It's an actual Playstation 3

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
game, and it'll be out on Mac and PC

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
as well. It's gonna be an air combat game

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
My hope is it's

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
pretty much the 8-bit game, but with

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
better graphics and new stuff, right?

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
That's what we want, right? I had Top Gun on the NES

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
That was a badass game

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Good times

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Loki, maybe one or two other stories, then we'll get

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
to the, like, we need to do the tweets and the mailbag

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
and all that other fun stuff

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
GameStop, remember they were talking about

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
throwing around the idea of some sort of

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
new rewards program

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Well, now it's being

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
launched, I guess, their Power Up Rewards

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
program, and there's

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
two different things. You can get a card for free

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Wait, first off, is this something that they

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
will try to force on me with every purchase?

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
It's basically the same thing

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
You'll see it's not very different

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
than what they're offering right now

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
So they have a card that you

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
can get for free, that, you know

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
you don't really do anything for

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Or a card that's the

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Platinum card, I guess, for

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
$14.99

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Now, here's what you get

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
with the different cards

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
The standard black card

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
for each dollar that you spend

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
on new games and consoles

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
you get 10 points

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Points that you earn on pre-owned games

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
you earn 20 points

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
For your trades

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
you get 20 points

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
per dollar

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
There's different birthday bonuses

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
exclusive member offers

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
and you get entered in

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
each time you buy something

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
to the Epic Rewards Giveaway

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
and then online activation

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
I guess

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000
250 points

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
and if you establish a game library

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
with them you get 250 points

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Now, with the Platinum card

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
you get basically all that

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
plus

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
in the Epic Rewards Giveaway thing

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
you get two entries

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
If you upgrade

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
to the Pro tier you get

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
an extra 250 points

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
you get a

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
one time buy two get one free

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
offer for pre-owned games

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
you get 10% off

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
10% bonuses on points

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
for your purchases

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
10% on pre-owned purchase

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
discount, I guess

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
and 10% trade bonus

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
and of course 12 issues of

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Game Informer. So basically

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
you get the same shit that you

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
get now, except there's this point system

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
that you can trade in for different things

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
including

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
like, I guess you can

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
get

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
gift cards

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
free

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
controllers, but the prices on them

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
are just absolutely

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
ridiculous

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
like you have to basically spend

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
$4,000 to get it

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
My God, well the way

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
and the sad thing is the extra $5

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
I have to pay online to play it online

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
now, it will not count towards this

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Yeah, basically it says the rewards range from

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
coupons for $5 to $10 off

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
purchases, and that ranges from

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
$4,000 to $8,000 points

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
You can even get a free

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Xbox 360 controller or eternal beach

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
X11 headset for

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
40,000 points

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
40,000 points

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
of course would equal about

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
$4,000 spent on new games

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
The eternal beach headset, it's like $100

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
I think, and the controllers are like

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
$40, but

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
$4,000, really?

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
I mean, is that

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
what you're expecting? Oh, you're gonna give me something for

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
$40 after I spend $4,000?

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Yeah, no

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Yeah, no thanks. Do not want

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
But hey, I mean if you're really dead

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
set on spending your money at GameStop

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
anyways, you might as well get the card because at least you're earning

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
some points towards something, but I

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
mean, I don't know

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Just like I have this thing at Petco where I

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
like buy cat food and stuff

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
I'm supposed to like buy ten bags of cat food

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
and I get one free, but it's within a certain

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
time limit, and that never happens

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
You might as well, because you're buying cat food

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
No, it never happens

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
It never happens, because I don't go through that much cat food

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
You don't have enough cat food, you need more cats

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
You need more cats

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Alright, how about a quick story, then we'll go to Twitter

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Alright

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
UFC Undisputed

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
2010 just was released

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
yesterday, and

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
unlockable is

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Shaq

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
That's right, you can play a little Shaq-Fu

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
with Shaquille O'Neal

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
And there's actually an easy code to

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
do that

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
On the Xbox 360, at the main menu

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
you would hit down, up, left

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
down, down, left, up, down, down

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
left, X

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Y, Y, X

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
And then start

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
On Playstation 3, it would be

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
down, up, left, down, down

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
left, up, down, down

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
left, square, triangle, triangle, square

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
start

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
So, there you go

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
There's your pro tip for the day

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Right

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Because I know everybody's just

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
running out to put that code in

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
right now

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Let's do some Twitter topics, huh?

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
We may not have a chat room tonight

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
but we still have all you kids on Twitter

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
The nice thing about doing this mid-week is

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
we kind of get some different people, we catch different people

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
because a lot of folks that don't listen to us live

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
don't because they have other things going on

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Sunday night, but we, looks like we got a little bit of a

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
different crowd tonight

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Uh, let's see

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Rockman Rock

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
sent us a tweet that says

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
You thought the movie, The Human Centipede

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
was a bad idea, just wait until

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
you play the game

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
That's right, there's a Human Centipede

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
game that I got

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
linked to here at Newgrounds

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
that I could play, but

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
I don't know if I want to

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
because the Human Centipede

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
is fucking gross

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Yeah, but it's just Centipede

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Let me just do this

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
You are doctor, wait let me make this full screen here

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Wait, let me turn off the Twitter music, we already heard the Twitter music tonight

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Shut up, Santa

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Alright, let's see, you are Dr. Heider, a brilliant German

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
surgeon who's gone mad and surgically attached people

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
ass to mouth to create the Human Centipede

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Your parents are not pleased

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
You must take your trusty rifle

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
and put down these Human Centipedes

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
with the bad dogs they are, whatever

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Oh look, there's some

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
little people with their mouths on their butts

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
and there were ten points

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Oh, that's not very gross, it's just digital

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
It's like little, let's see, we can do mouse

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
controls, mouse to move and left click

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
to fire, oh this is just

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Centipede

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Ha, but the Centipede

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
I get it, it's

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
the Human Centipede

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
The sounds are right

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
This is totally a hacked version

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Oh, there's a police officer

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Oh, and I just shot him to bits, woohoo

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Yay, I beat the first stage

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
They change colors really stupidly

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Yeah, that's a little dumb

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Thanks anyway

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
A little dumb

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Uh, let's see

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Blade 3, or Blade III

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
How about

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
It says Blade E!

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Blade E!

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
How about new Facebook privacy

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Finally fixes games, annoying achievements

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
being posted everywhere, did you hear about this?

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Facebook's been in the news a lot and I guess they

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
came out today, well they came out a couple days ago

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
and I love

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
the Facebook CEO because he's such

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
a bro, like you know

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
he's just, he looks like that total

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
douchebag frat guy

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
and like he's running this multi

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
like what, billion dollar company

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
and like he came out a couple days

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
ago and literally said the corporate

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
equivalent of, oh yeah my bad

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
My bad on that one

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
guys, sorry guys, my bad

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
I forgot

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
the keg, my bad

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
That's pretty much what happened a couple days ago

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Well they came out today and talked about the base

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
so they're going to have to dumb down the privacy because

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
too many people are

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
you know, getting information used

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
that they don't want to be used, the biggest problem

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
is that

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Facebook sets a lot of things to public by

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
default without really giving you enough warning

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
that's the biggest problem I always had

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
with it, but it sounds like they're getting rid of that

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
they're going to make it really easy to block applications

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
which includes games

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
so if you want to just block

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
all the fucking Facebook apps

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
and all the games, one click, done

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
how about that Dark Soccer, you won't have to read any of that

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
crap ever again, sweet

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
at least that's what it's

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
sounding like, we'll see, I guess we won't

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
really know until later tonight when it's implemented

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
maybe it's on there now, I don't know

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Let's see, Sponge Twang wants to tell us

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
that he is going to a medium sized

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Anime Con, not a big one, not as small

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
it's a medium sized

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Anime Con in Boise, Idaho

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Anime Oasis

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Are there Oases in

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Boise? I don't know

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Oasis? Oasis

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Are they in Boise?

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Boise Oasis?

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Anyway, saying

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
check out the game room, Sponge Twang is going to check out

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
the game room at Anime Oasis 2010

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Yes, please, let us know

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
We like the Anime Cons, but we like the gaming room

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
reports, especially

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Popo

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
and Jer

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
I know this guy, this is my buddy

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Jer, not on Facebook, he's probably

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
on Facebook too, but LiveJournal

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Popo and Jer says, or it's Pop

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
on Jer, I like Popo and Jer better

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
although it might be Pop on Jer

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
says Rob's Giggle sounds like

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
the Riddler from the old Batman series

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
just saying

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Woo hoo hoo hoo!

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
I don't know

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
This is like Winnie the Pooh

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
That's what he did, the old Riddler guy

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
had this hoo hoo hoo thing he did

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Yeah, it does sound like the Doughboy, shut up

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
I hate you, stop judging me

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
But I love the old Batman series

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
That's, that's Batman

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Screw this

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Batman, that's right, that was

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Batman was awesome

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
GGBeat wants us to talk about

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
how Jet Set Radio should go to

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Xbox Live Arcade, it would be awesome

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
I agree, it should go to Xbox Live

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Arcade, it would be awesome, there should just be

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
a new Jet Set game, period

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
I thought it was coming to Xbox Live Arcade

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Was that something that was

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
spoiled on the partner net or whatever?

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
I think it was one of the ones spoiled on the partner net

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
I can't remember, there is a lot

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
of Dreamcast stuff coming to Xbox Live

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Arcade at some point

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
GGBeat, you need to cross your fingers, cross your toes

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
hold your breath and hope for a miracle at E3

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
I wonder if it'll be, yeah, it'll probably show it at E3

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Maybe that'll be the game, you know how sometimes

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
at E3 there's like a game that they go

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
and it's out right now

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Like I think, wasn't that Doom a couple years ago?

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
They came out and said Doom will be available tonight

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Right?

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Ironically Doom 2, maybe, maybe

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
GGBeat

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Do it, do it, say a prayer

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Light a candle

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
A satanic chant, whatever it is you want to do

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
I would guess Sonic Adventure over

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
that, cause that's actually

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
leaked out already

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
MNZeba

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
wants us to talk about

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
this game Ryzom

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
that is going open source

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
pretty interesting when an MMO goes open source

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Ooh, this is cute

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
I've never seen this, is this

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
I don't know if that's the same game or if that's the

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
website, but there's this

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
cute little background with like a little raccoon

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
with a hard hat on and it's a cute little character

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Well, whatever, anyhow Winchgate

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
who is developing and publishing Ryzom

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
they have announced that the Science Fantasy

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
MMO Ryzom, it's open source

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
That's kind of neat, an MMO going open source

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
And you install Linux on

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
the MMO

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Probably, you can now use the

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Ryzom core toolkit to make mods

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
or enhancements to the existing code

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
and even develop your own virtual world

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Wow, that's pretty crazy

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Who knows what might come of that, well thanks for the

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
heads up, if we have any programmers

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
that want to make the OLR MMO, go for it

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
The SEG

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
wants us to mention, how about the

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Supreme Court hearings in October about the

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
California video games law

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Oh yeah, that's going to be a big deal

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Whatever happens because of that, I mean it will be

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
you know, the Supreme Court is

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
supposed to be the end of the line, the highest court in the land

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Hopefully it will be the last we hear on it

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
I just feel like

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
I just don't know enough about the law

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
I might be a games analyst

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
But I don't really know enough to really

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
say what's going to happen with this

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Of course I want it to be struck down, of course

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
I think the whole thing is a little silly

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
But I have no legal

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
basis to say it will or it won't

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Do you guys have any thoughts?

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
The California video games law that

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
will, the California law will

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
make it illegal to sell the game, right?

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
I don't remember

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
I don't remember the specifics

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
about it, I have to look that

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
up real quick, hold on

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
What's the problem with doing a free form show?

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
You haven't really researched your topics

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
I think we're going to see

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
I really

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
I really don't see that it would

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
fly

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
I mean

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Haven't they tried before?

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Let's see, the California

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
law imposes restrictions on and a

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
labeling requirement with respect to

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
the sale or rental of violent video

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
games to minors. Several other states

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
have passed similar laws and others may well be

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
watching the case, the stakes

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
extend beyond California. I remember

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
this now because the verbiage

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
in the law was very vague

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
I remember this, it didn't really state

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
how a game was

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
It was a very

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
gray area

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
type of thing on what constituted a violent

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
game and hopefully that's going to be the same thing

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
that does the law in

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
But we'll see

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
I don't know

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
We'll see what happens

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Butch Kawa says

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Might be a late one, no you got in just under the wire

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
But the topic of heavy rain rights might

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
go to a movie deal, trivializing

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
the game or just trying to cash in

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Heavy Rain movie, also

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
I'll piggyback on this, I wanted to say I read

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
this week a Mass Effect movie

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
was sold to Legendary Pictures too

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
What do you think? These games are pretty epic

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
to begin with, I mean they're a little different

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
than what we've seen before

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Mass Effect would be kind of hard to condense down in the movie

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Heavy Rain I could see it because it pretty much played out like a movie

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
so why not?

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
As long as the Jason scenes in it

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Jason! Jason! Jason!

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Jason!

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Did you see the Press X

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Jason music video today? I did actually

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
That was awesome

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Good stuff

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
As long as they have the Jason scene in it, Bochi Kawa

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
I'm cool

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
But of course it's kind of

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
I don't necessarily think it's trivializing

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
the game, it's trying to cash in

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
They realize that the game is done pretty

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
well and will have a built in audience

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
to go see it and they can probably make

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
the movie relatively cheap

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Speaking of which, I'm kind of curious to see how Prince of Persia

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
does because we might actually have a

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
mainstream video game movie

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
that does well With no Persians in it

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Imagine that I know

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
It's so whitewashed

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
I think I saw something on Yahoo where the headline

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
was Prince of Persia called

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Offensive

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
They're talking the movie, not the game

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
But it had to do, it was a story about that

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
and the movie

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
they can't call Avatar

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
The Last Airbender because they're all whitewashed

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Well if they can't find

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Persian actors that are

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
good enough for those parts

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
I think that's a little silly

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Jake Gyllenhaal of course

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
is an A-list actor

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
There's going to be lots of people

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Maybe myself included

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
who will want to see the movie

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Don't mind me while I sound really racist here

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Who would they get to play

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
these Persian roles?

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Would they have Kal Penn or something?

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Playing the major lead in this?

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Well I think

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
you only need

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
one or two A-list actors

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
To take a step back

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
I think that

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
says something about our society in general

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
where you've only got one or two guys

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
to pick from

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Was Aladdin Persian? I don't remember him being very

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Persian in the cartoon

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
He was pretty white

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
I think that says something about society

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
A much larger

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
problem of society

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
What? The Disney one?

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
He looked

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Middle Eastern?

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Let me say this

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
There's an Aladdin stage show at California

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Now you are making me do a Disney podcast

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
There's an Aladdin stage show at California

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Adventure

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
The last time I saw it

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
the Jafar they had playing it

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
was a black guy

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
He's the best one I've ever seen

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
He was great

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
He was just enough camp

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
that the little kids want to boo him

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
but he was still really campy

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
He was by far the best Jafar

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
He happened to be a black guy

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
I didn't get offended that he wasn't

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
actually looked like the Sultan in the movie

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
or was Persian

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
He played the part well

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
The problem is people complain about everything

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
and that's really what it comes down to

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
If you don't like it

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
If that really gets your butt hurt

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
don't go see the movie

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Also

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Can I just say this real quick

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
They had a girl in the ensemble

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
in a wheelchair

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
A power wheelchair in the ensemble

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
She was actually pretty fierce

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
I got to say

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
They were kind of smart with how they integrated her into all the dance numbers

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
and everything

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
During a whole new world where the ensemble will come out

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
and they're carrying famous buildings

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
I shit you not

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
She had pyramids tied to the back of her wheelchair

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
and she'd ride along with everybody else

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
She's singing

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
It was great to see

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
You know why I like to see that?

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Because there's a lot of handicapped kids that go to Disneyland

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
and for them to be able to see that

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
that if they want to do that, they can

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
I think that's great, personally

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Boy, we're getting into too...

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
These topics are too deep

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
We need dick and fart jokes, help

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
We're done with Twitter, twitter.com

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
I burped, did I help?

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Well, there's a game coming out

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
called Warriors of Alaysia

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
and it's basically

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
bikini-clad women fighting each other

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Mortal Kombat style

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
And they have a lot of bikini-clad women that are

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
promoting it as well

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
So that's kind of interesting

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Boobs!

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Exactly. Speaking of boobs

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
If we have any listeners that are

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
going to Phantom this weekend

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
There's actually one of my friends

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
from high school

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
She's an amazing artist, worked for EA

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Did a lot of the artwork for My Sims

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
That franchise

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
And draws chicks with big boobs

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Very, very big boobs

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
She does, and she has

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
a comic that she works on

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Her name is Genevieve, by the way

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
She works on, and I believe

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
her

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
I'm trying to remember who

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
her other artist is that she works with

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
I want to say his name is Robert

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Forgive me if I got that wrong

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Anyways, they have a comic that they work on

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
Called Islands in the Sky

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
And it's basically this big boob chick

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
That goes around stealing people's food

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
In these different islands in the sky

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
And putting them in her boobs, apparently

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Pretty much, but

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
As kind of an exclusive thing at Phantom

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
They're going to be selling

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
And I don't know how the hell they got these made

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
But it's just awesome

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
They're going to be selling boob

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Mouse pads

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
And they have one that's semi-tame

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
But still, she's got big boobs

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
But you can actually purchase those

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
She'll be on Artist Row

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
I believe booth 300 and 301

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
They're going to be doing

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
So, unrealistically proportioned women

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Is your thing, then Islands in the Sky

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
Exactly, so say hi to Genevieve

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
She's awesome

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Tell them OLR sent you!

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
And recommended the boobies

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
That's right

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Not much has changed

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
No, but she's cool

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
These boobs were endorsed by Loki

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Yes

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
How about, um, I don't know

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Do we want to do, like, Mailbag?

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Do we have Mailbag ready to go? Do we have some emails we can read tonight?

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
I didn't pull up Mailbag

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Can we, well, let's

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
On a quick story, if you want to pull up Mailbag

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Yeah, pull up Mailbag while we do another quick story

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
So, that game, Super Mario Crossover

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Was pretty awesome, the Flash game where you can play

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Super Mario Brothers with a bunch of different characters

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Well, one of the characters that they talked about

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Adding in there that they never really

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Got a chance to do that was

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
Hayabasa, or Hayabusa

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
And, um, they have now

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Added him in there, or at least they're going to very soon

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
They have a video teasing it

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
And he has, of course, his

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Wall climb moves and he throws ninja stars

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
And whatnot, so, that's awesome

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Can't wait to play that

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Version of it

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
And that's that game you really love to play that has, like, the Contra characters

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Oh yeah

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Sweet

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Alright, Dark Sakura is prepared to dive into the Mailbag

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Headfirst, our Mailbag, of course

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
And she's going to dive in headfirst

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
And pick out an email to read

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Or two, or three, or fifteen, depending on how many people

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Three, email us this week

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Dark Sakura, go to it, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
If you would like to participate, please do

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Hey guys, Sturlock here

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
I've tried calling about this a couple of times

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
That I've been unable to get through

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
I was surprised that Loki actually brought the closure

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
Of Nintendo Powerline up as

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
As I've known this for a while

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Excuse me, I wanted to clarify

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
What the Powerline actually is

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
It's a line you can call to get walkthroughs and tips for games

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Instead of talking to live individuals

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
The walkthroughs are automated with a menu interface

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Which makes it quite easy to find the specific information

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
You're looking for on a particular game

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
I have very fond memories of running up

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
My parents' phone bill back in the day

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Although this is only a regular

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Long distance call, not even a 900 number

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
The thing I always liked about the Powerline

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Is that they will frequently have music from the games in question

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
In the background over the person giving the information

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
That's cute

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
By the way, I do want to point out

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
That may be how it is around these days

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
When I was in high school

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
You talked to a person

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Yeah, go watch The Wizard

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
There's actually a scene where they call

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
The game counselor, it's pretty epic

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Yeah, I just sat in, you know

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
And jawed with some guy one day about like

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Weird Zelda stuff and

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Prototype games one time

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Because I was bored, I ran up the phone bill

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
I get what he's saying though, he's telling us that it's different

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Because I think we were reminiscing about that on last week's show

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Trying to tell us it's a little bit different now than it was then

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Since I have a lot of memories of this line

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
I've actually been working to record every last game

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
From it I can

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
I know I'm probably the only person on the faceless planet

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Who actually gives a fuck about this

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
But it's something I'm passionate about

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
I see it as part of my childhood in a way

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
And I don't want to see it go away entirely

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
It's a neat little artifact of the 90s

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
And if nothing else, I'm sorry, if nothing else

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Sorry for the rambling nature of this message

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
But this is something I feel quite strongly about

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
You might actually be able to petition Nintendo

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
To actually put out DVDs of their

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Ivor or something

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
If you feel strongly about it, go for it

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
I think that's actually kind of cool

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
If he's recording stuff

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
I don't even know if you have this ability at all

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
But if you've been recording it and you can make MP3s of it

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Send us one, I'll play one on the show

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
I think it'll be kind of fun to listen to

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Send us one that you think is really cool

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
This one is from Doug

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Or Dragonboy

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Hi Doug Dragonboy

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
I was wondering if any of you were playing any PS1 games

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
On the PSPs

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
I have 23 PS1 games now on my

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
He wrote no, it's supposed to be now

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
On my PSP Go

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
And I love playing them

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
As many PS1 games are far better than PSP games

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
That are available

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Keep up the great work on the podcast

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
I'm a loyal listener and your podcast is without a doubt

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
My favorite Dragonboy

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Aw, thank you

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
PS1 games on the PSP?

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Did they ever do Jumping Flash?

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Yes they did

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
What about Jumping Flash if you don't have it?

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Um Jammalammy is a great music game

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
A lot of fun

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
And of course that's one I play personally

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Suikoden, I have the original

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
And I've played that on the PSP before, that's fun

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
And Final Fantasy 7

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
You might as well go, you know what

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
All the fanboy wank is there for a reason

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Final Fantasy 7 is pretty good

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Not the best Final Fantasy game they ever made

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
But pretty darn good

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Okay, this last one

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
From Rababa

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Oh, never mind

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
I think it's sort of a continuation from an old email

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
The subject line is iPad mini

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Maybe iPad nano

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
I only suggested that on the last OLR episode

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Because the leaked iPhone images

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Are designed to match the iPad

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
If it played iPad apps

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
It would be a way around the contract

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
With AT&T, the iPad itself

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Seems like it would qualify

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
As a non-phone since it has

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
No phone capability

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Well isn't that what the iPod touches for?

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
I'm pretty sure the AT&T network

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Is used for the iPad for access to the app store

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
By the way, I have an iPad

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
And a netbook and the iPad is just better

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Let's keep an eye out for an Apple branded

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Phone for Verizon

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
I still want an iPad

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
I love my netbook though

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Now the rumor is Apple is going to team up with Sprint

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Let's hope not

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Well that's done

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Alright, if you really want to do that

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Alright

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Well thanks for the emails guys

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
You can go to our website

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
If you want to send us some more

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Couple more news stories

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Do we have any more? We done?

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
We still have the classic game of the week

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
We'll get to that in a minute

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
Any more news stories for us, Loki?

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Not really, don't have anything

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
I got one

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
I'll do a couple quick ones

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
I have a couple here that I can do

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Classic game of the week

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Dragon Quest 9, Sentinels of the Starry Skies

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
July 11th, finally

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Ready for US consumption

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
4.2 million sold in Japan

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
And it's finally making its way over here

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Dragon Quest 9, Sentinels of the Starry Skies

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
And the Nintendo DS

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
That's too bad I knew about that weeks ago

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
I should have mentioned something

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
I always see this stuff and I'm like

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Damn you, Loki

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
It's like not news for me

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
The crackdown thing is really interesting

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
But again, I hope they're wrong

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
I really do hope they're wrong

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Other one, I think this is really interesting

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
The NPD report

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
The top selling accessory

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
On the Microsoft Xbox 360

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
You know what the best selling accessory is for the 360?

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
The 1600 point Microsoft

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Xbox Live card

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Even though you can buy them with the touch of a button

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
The 1600 point card was the best selling accessory

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
I'm surprised live subscriptions aren't

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
And you know why?

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Because if you've ever tried to buy a live subscription

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
With a credit card on

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Their service

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
You're stuck in the stupid auto

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Renewing shit

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
And it sucks

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Getting out of it is near impossible

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
So I tell you

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
Man, if you

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Really are limited on money

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Spend the time to go out and buy

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
One of those memberships

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
It's a lot better to buy it at the store

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
And have it dumped down

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
To silver again

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Than having it auto renew all the time

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
And you can't get rid of it

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
It's awful

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Alright, let's go to the

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Classic game of the week

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
You ready for this Dark Sakura?

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
May as well be

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Alright, every week on the program

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Oh my gosh, you know it's free form tonight

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Because everything's broken, I don't have the

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
I don't have the song, where's the song?

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
There it is

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Classic game of the week, every week Dark Sakura

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Goes into the vault and picks out a classic game

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
She says, hey, you kids

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Get off my lawn

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
And go play this game

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
A classic game that we all

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Grew up on

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
I don't know, what constitutes a classic game?

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Um, it's old

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
What is this week's classic game of the week Dark Sakura?

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Keyboard Mania

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
How appropriate

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
I know a lot of listeners of the show will be big on this one

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
Keyboard Mania is your classic game of the week

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Want to hear someone butcher a song on Keyboard Mania?

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Yeah, let's do that first

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
This is a song called Pink Rose

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
That originated in Keyboard Mania

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
I'm gonna butcher it here a little bit

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
It's not terrible

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
It's a B-

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
And it's not

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
It's not an easy song to play

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
No

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
This person's doing doubles

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Let's go to the real song here

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Which, by the way, this is one of my favorite songs

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Totally in this game

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Um

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
But actually I really like it better in pop music

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
But, anyway

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
So, um, Keyboard Mania

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Is one of the Bimani games

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
It has two, um, 24 key keyboards

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
And, um

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
The different notes that come down

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Correspond

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
To a different key on the keyboard

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Um

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
And, um

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Also there's a- you know how BeatMania

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
Had, uh, the BM-98 simulator?

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Um, there's one called

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Doremi

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
For a Keyboard Mania simulator for me

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
I get it, doe, a deer, a female deer

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Yeah

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Anyway, um, so we got out Keyboard Mania

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Then, uh, Keyboard Heaven

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Which is the Korean version

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Of Keyboard Mania

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
And then Keyboard Mania 2nd Mix

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Um, 3rd Mix

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Uh, actually, uh, linked

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
To Drum Mania 4th, Guitar Freaks 5th

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Um, and

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Drum Mania 5th, Guitar Freaks

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
6th for certain songs

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Cause we used to have- Those were epic days

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
At Roseville Golf Land. One of the few arcades

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
Anywhere that had that. There's pictures of all of us

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Amazing. Playing

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Like, Jamie would do drums, I would do

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Keyboard, and, you know, like

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Bradley would do guitar

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
I don't know if Loki was playing with us then, but

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
I was playing guitar with the other side of the keyboard

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Good times. You'd always pick keyboard

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Can I play one of my favorite songs in Keyboard Mania?

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
This kinda sounds like a song

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
This is not Henry Henry

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
No, it's not. This is like a song that would be like an act-raiser or something

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
This is Kyu No Tame No Sonata

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:46.000
This-

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
This sounds like the overworld music

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
An act-raiser to me

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
I think it is

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Like, remember when you were managing your people?

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
This is one of my favorite songs

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
In Keyboard Mania

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
We'll play a little bit of this, then I'll do the

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Castle Baby song

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Yeah, the Akumajou

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Uh, medley

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Okay, but anyway, um, well

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
There's actually, um

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Three songs, though, that were big

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Carryover songs into other Bimani

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
Games. Um, that was

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Frozen Ray

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Pink Rose, which we played earlier, and the least

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Hundred Seconds, which we should actually

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Play that too, Rob

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
I love Frozen Ray, though

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Um, but, uh

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
Keyboard Mania, um, had two home versions

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
There was Keyboard Mania, and then

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Keyboard Mania 2, which was the second and third

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Mix

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Um, and it had, uh

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
You know, basically the arcade-style

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Controller. I don't see

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Any other way that you could've

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Had, like, the full arcade-style

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Controller, like, you know, they brought out for

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
2DX and

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
DDR and all that

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
But the other way is that if you had, um

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
The Windows PC version

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
You get a Yamaha EZ250i

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Keyboard, um, to play it

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Which one you've got there?

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Oh, yeah

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Someone's butchering it a little bit

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
They're doing pretty good. This is about as good as

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
I would do, probably

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
And I love how, on the interface

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
When it has the little

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Background music up, you know, screen up there

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
From the arcade

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
The wheel thing always weirded me out, though

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Like, what the hell was that? It's your scratch!

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Yeah, but it was a little dumb

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
It was a little dumb

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
I'm kinda glad that, hopefully, uh

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
If we get this keyboard thing in, um

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Rock Bandit probably won't have that

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
But, I mean, really, there's not much else to say

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
About it other than what I've said, you know

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
It was fairly short-lived

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
For the Bimani series, and, you know

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
It's sad

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
That it didn't do better, you know

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
It was really difficult, though

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
This is one of the few songs

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Cause, like, when you did that multi-session

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
There was probably, like, six songs you could play

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
This is one of them, at least 100 seconds

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
I love this game

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
This was my favorite Bimani game

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Oh, okay

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Because you could also do, um

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
I think there was also a version of Ride on Time

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
I'm pretty sure there was

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
Good stuff

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Yeah, but

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
The other big song, though, of course, was Frozen Ray

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Which we got for other versions, too

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Um, but yeah

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
This

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
I don't remember, though

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
And I want to say

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
It didn't have it

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Cause keep in mind, I've got

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Drum Mania IV, Guitar Freaks V

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
For home

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
And Keyboard Mania

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
And I don't think it had Super Session mode

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
For the three

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
No, not on the home version

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
So, which made me very sad

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Because I was all like

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
Yeah, Super Session, and no

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
The 2-3 mix came out

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Way later, too

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
And people were pretty convinced

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
The others were never coming out

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
I think I had the first time, and then I borrowed yours

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
For the longest time

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
We basically, I think for a while, had Communal Bimani

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Yeah, pretty much

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Because one of us would make sure that we bought a version that no one else had

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
And then we would play the hell out of it

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
And then switch it out with somebody else

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
So we had our Communal Bimani

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Going on, and we always made sure we knew

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Who we had our damn game

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Good times

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
A good Bimani classic

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Find me a Frozen Ray, Rob

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
You want Frozen Ray?

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
We'll close out with a little bit of Frozen Ray here

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
For the Classic Game of the Week

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
And, uh, let's see

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Here we go

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Here's from the PS2

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Somebody's selecting on the mini list

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
There we go

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Intruder, good job

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Jinx

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:10.000
That part's really easy to mess up on

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
What I really liked about this game

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Is that if you, like, could memorize

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
The note patterns

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
You could play the song on a real piano

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
It was the one Bimani game

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
It was closest to a real simulator

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Was the closest thing to the actual

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Instrument than anything else

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
It really was, you know

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
I'll tell you one thing that had to help me

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
When learning how to play it

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Is that, um, it was easier to play it in the arcade

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Than it was at home

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
Because your keyboard lined up

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
With the keys and didn't move

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Um, but

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
I would always have to find something

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
To hold my, um, controller stationary

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
And put it right the hell in front of my

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Of the TV for me to be able to really get it

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
You know, cause otherwise

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
It was, it was

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Way, it was way too much coordination

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
I think, I mean, 2DX is definitely

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Easier in terms of building your

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Hand-eye coordination, and I was never a keyboard player

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
So

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
See, when I was like 5 years old

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
I started taking organ lessons

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Yeah, the double decker

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Church organ, you know

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Completely off topic

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
I found an accordion at the thrift store today

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Good stuff, did you buy it?

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
I wanted to, it's 85 bucks

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
I bought a Fendi purse for 6 bucks though

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Anyway, um, that's my thing lately

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Y'all, by the way, is going to thrift stores

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
And buying designer stuff

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
You get good stuff there, no lie, no joke

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Anyway, um, so the game of the week

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Is keyboard mania

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
If none of you have played it, you poor deprived people

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Go check it out

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
If you can, good luck

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
I'm sure the keytar thing will be pretty cool

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
But it's never going to be as cool as keyboard mania

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
Keytar freaks?

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Uh, keyboard mania, still I think at Milpitas Golfland

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
At least, I think, last time I was there

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
Might still be there, I don't know

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
It's been a little while

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
Ours has been gone, for ages

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
Alright, uh, one more segment

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
That we have to do on this show every week

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
It's just mandatory for no other reason

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
And sometimes we have to vent a little bit

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
GRRR, FUs of the week, Darcy

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:24.000
GRRR, FU to, um, the place which shall not be named

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:28.000
Loki?

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:32.000
Um, FU to the fact that, uh, this weather changing

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:36.000
That's like rain, sun, rain, sun, rain, sun

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Is really fucking with my allergies

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
Is this really giving you a headache?

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Uh, yeah, I've been getting headaches the last few days

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
I just took some time a little bit before I came over here

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
My throat now is really dry and scratchy

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
But I think that's from yelling a lot during the show

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
You know, imitating Michael Patrick really

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
Takes a toll on you

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
Oh, the holy name, ah

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Alright, uh, my FU goes to myself

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Actually, most things in life are pretty good right now

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
I can't complain

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Uh, FU to myself, though, because, like, every time I start

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Like a pattern of good eating habits

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
Like, I guess you could say a diet, if you will

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
I break it within, like, a week and a half

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
There's always something that breaks me

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
And this time it was vacation

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
You should go off

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
Oh god, no

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Like, I know my limits

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Props to you for having that sort of discipline

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
For a fact, I could do it

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
By the way, I'm not 100% raw, you know

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
And I had a beer the other day, and it totally

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Oh my god

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
And it totally made my face break out

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
So, I have no more beer

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
I've lost 16 pounds, Rob

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
For you? Good for you, that's great

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Wish I could lose 16 pounds, bitch

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Alright

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
Hey!

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
You were on your, uh, involuntary toast diet

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Yeah, that was bad

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
That was bad

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
That was bad. You know things are bad

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
When you kinda almost wish you would get sick again

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
So you could be that thin again

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Remember when I had pneumonia?

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
I really don't want that, I really don't

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
I do not recommend anybody lose weight by pneumonia

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
It's not fun

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Well, no, I got, I lost

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Actually, I shouldn't joke, like, that can't kill people

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
I lost 35 pounds when I had pneumonia

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
I was sick for three months, they thought I had whooping cough

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
But it turned out that they were just

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Not paying attention

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Yay, unnamed healthcare company that Jamie has

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
I called it the plague

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
Alright, let's wrap up

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
We're done, we don't have any other game stories

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Right, Loki, you burned through them all, we're good

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
Yeah, we're done. Dark Sakura, alright

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Loki's ready to go

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
It's hot in here

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
I thought we'd only be going an hour, we gave you two

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
What the hell are you thinking, Rob?

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Hey, you were here too, lady

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
It's my house

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
It's my house

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
You're gonna fuck out

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Then I am, goodnight

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Bye, goodbye

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
You've been listening

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
No, we have to do final thoughts, we can't do that yet

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Final thoughts, Dark Sakura

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Hey, my final thought list, this is my house

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
If you don't like it, you get the fuck out

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Loki, your final thought

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Uh, I can't wait to edit some more

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Granted, I thought it was gonna be awesome

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Hire me

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
My final thought is I'm stopping getting fast food on the way home

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
And ruining my diet some more, yay

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
I did that today because I bought

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
the wrong kind of bread, you know, I buy this like

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
you know, whole wheat bread or whatever

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
And I bought the wrong brand, so it was really

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
it just had the wrong texture and just

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
tasted weird, so I'm like

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
McDonald's

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
But I've been pretty good, I haven't been going to fast food

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
except for today

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
My other final thought, my mom's gonna be

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
pissed when she finds out who won American Idol

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
Who did?

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Dweiss, or whatever

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
He sucked last night

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
I don't want shit any of this season

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
I know, I barely do, I did like that Crystal Bowers socks

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
I thought she was good because somebody showed me her

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
And apparently Alanis came out to duet with her tonight

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Okay, I have to see

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
That I have to see

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
Doesn't go with the dreads, right?

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
He sucked last night

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
That was the chick with the dreads, right?

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
She's cool

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
No, she lost, just like Adam and I lost last year

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
You know what, I did actually

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
My mom's gonna be pissed, you know what?

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
You wanna call my mom and tell her?

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
About the week, Rob

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
I have to tell you, I did

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
actually buy

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
some of the stuff off of Alison Irajeda's album

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Okay, clearly the game

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
part of the show is over

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
So, if you were here for the video games

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
then goodnight

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
Orange Lounge Radio

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
is an Orange Lounge

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
production

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
To join us for a live show, visit

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
www.allgames.com

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
No, I talked over to this gamer

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Blah, blah, blah

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
All games, listen to them, they rule

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
Yes, they do

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
Yes, they do

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Shh, no they don't

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
But they do have my competitor

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
No, we won't

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
We'll see you in two weeks

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Let's go on

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
She's watching it right now, too

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Your mom's so funny

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Oh, don't ruin it for her

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
Oh, then we're calling right now

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
Hello

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
Hi mom

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Who is this?

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
It's Rob, your kid

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
I already know who won

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
Damn it

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
I was calling

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
Why are you laughing?

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Why are you laughing?

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Why are you laughing?

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
We're on the radio right now

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
and I was calling because I read it on the internet

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
and I wanted to spoil it for you

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
I got on the internet at

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
7 o'clock, I'm not stupid

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
She was Rob

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
This is weird, my mother

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Now admit it, mom

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
a year ago, you made me

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
go online and look it up

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
You didn't know how to do this

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Yeah, but I don't need your help anymore

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Is this why you decided to

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
Did you hear that?

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
You got served

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
I'm not on the radio, am I?

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
Yeah, you are, it's okay

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
You don't mind, do you?

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
My mom said that I had to text her

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
and warn her before we call

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Mom, this is the part after the credits

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
so no one's listening, it's cool

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Are you watching the finale anyway?

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
I didn't watch the first half

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
I said I'm not gonna watch it

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
because I'm too mad

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
I couldn't stand it, so I turned it on

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
Now, did you or did you not tell me last year

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
First off, who should have won last year?

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Adam

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
I know, right?

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
And why should Adam have won last year?

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
Because he was by far the best

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
And what made him the best?

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
He just was, he was more of a showman

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
He was the best

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
That's why that Chris guy is selling

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
his stuff on QVC

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
and Adam's touring

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:56.000
I did like Alison

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Explain why you...

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Yes, I like Alison too

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
and she's doing okay because I saw her on

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
I bought her album

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
It's actually really good

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
Hold on, you guys are talking last year's news

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
I wanna talk this year again

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
I'm still reeling over David Cook, pardon me

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
Well, okay, last night

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Lee stunk

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
His first single's gonna be a beautiful day

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
and it was awful

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
It was terrible

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
The one that she did was really good

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
and I was hoping that would come out on

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
a CD because I'd like to buy it

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
I think maybe she's gonna be more

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Don't you think the runner-ups

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
often fare better unless you're the beatboxing guy?

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
In the last few years

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
they have, and the reason they have

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
is because, and I've told you this before

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
it becomes a popularity contest

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
in the end and the little girls

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
all vote for the cute guys

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
Except for David Cook because I thought

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
David Cook did not have nearly the talent

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
that David Cook had

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Well, I

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
And David Cook is

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
I think it wasn't so much that he didn't have

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
the talent that he was really young

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
That was my mother respectfully disagreeing with you

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
I know the tone

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
I honestly, personally

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
I think that David Cook had better stage presence

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
but that's me

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Well, he probably did, but he was older

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
and more mature

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
same way as this year with Aaron

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
cause I thought Aaron was really a good singer

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
but he was only 17

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
and he didn't have the

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
you know, he didn't have the charisma and stuff

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
I had him in my third place spot

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
I was picking, well originally when we had

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
cause we had a work pool for this

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
I had Crystal, Casey, and Aaron

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
cause Lee, at the time, I mean

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
it was like a good, you know

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
before, I think it was at the top ten

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
Well he didn't start out to be one of the better ones

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
he started out, really

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
he just sounded like

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
a bunch of mainstream artists now

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
Okay, I have to

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
I like Big Mike too

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
I have to ask you this, because I just

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
you know, you said last year, when Adam lost last year

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
you said, and I quote,

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
I am never watching that show again

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
because the person that should win never does

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
and yet, you watched this year

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
No, they used to, but

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
lately it hasn't been that way

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Well, did Reuben deserve to beat Clay?

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
No, Clay deserved it by far

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Okay, actually if

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
you don't mind me asking, because

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
I'm of two minds about this too

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Did you prefer Carrie Underwood

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
or Bo Bice?

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
Oh, I preferred Carrie Underwood

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Most of the time I've been for the person that's won

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
there's been a few times

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
so that I thought the second place one should've won

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
See, I'm from Alabama

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
so Bo Bice automatically got my vote

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
And you're biased, that's fine

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
And he sang with Lynyrd Skynyrd, how could you go wrong with that?

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Okay, I have to ask my mother though

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
Are you gonna make the threat that you're not watching next year?

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
I don't think

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
with Simon gone, I don't think it's gonna be

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
nearly as popular

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Are divas leaving?

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Who do you think should replace Simon?

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
I don't think there's anybody

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
that can replace him

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
It's just like when they

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
took Paula off, the show lost something

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
What are the names they're throwing around?

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
Elton John, could Elton John replace Simon?

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
No

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
You know who I want to replace Simon?

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Graham Norton

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Who?

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
Graham Norton, he's a talk show host

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
He's funny

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
What about Perez Hilton?

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Well some people have suggested

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Howard Stern too

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
He wants to do it

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Howard Stern

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
it's like a big joke gone out of control

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
and Perez Hilton is just a bitch

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
And it would turn into a

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
dirty show if Howard Stern got on

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
What else

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
was I gonna say?

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
The X Factor, Simon's new

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
show that Paula is rumored to be a judge

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Suddenly it's the reality TV podcast

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
No, no, she got a dance show

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
She's gonna do a dance show

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Where have you been? Are you into rock or something?

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Sorry, I'm doing a show on video games

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
It makes sense for me

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
I'm a games analyst, did you hear?

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
No

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
How'd you get to be a games analyst?

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
I told Robbie I was

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Yeah, Jamie told me I was

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
In other words

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
you're a games analyst

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
in your own mind

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
That's not what my business card says

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
but sure

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
I'm an authority on Idol in my

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
own mind too

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Well then she's the official

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
Rob's mom, the official

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
American Idol

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
analyst for Orange Lounge Radio

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
I just used my

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
female powers of always being right to make

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
Rob an analyst

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
Alright, X Factor

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
Yes or no? Are you gonna watch it?

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Probably because I think it will be a much better show

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
because it won't be

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
relying on the public

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
to pick the winner

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Ok, one more then I promise I'm wrapping this up

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
That little 11 year old kid that Ellen DeGeneres

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
I know you watch her show everyday, right?

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
Absolutely great

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
He's got that Bieber kid beat to it

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
He's so much better

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
This is why I love my mother

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
His name is

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Chance

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
His first name is Grayson

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
Grayson Chance

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
He's absolutely great

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Did you watch Glee last night?

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
They did Gaga

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
Where were you?

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
I have to ask my mother

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
this

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
About this whole thing

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
Rob I adore your mom

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
I know, she's pretty cool

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Now I forgot what I was gonna ask

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
Glee

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
Grayson Chance and the

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Bieber

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
Since you're hooked up to the internet now

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
You know how to use Google?

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Yeah, absolutely

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
I want you to Google this website

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Lesbians that look like Justin Bieber

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
There's

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
probably a lot of them with that haircut he's got

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
There is

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
There's a whole blog dedicated

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
to lesbians that look like Justin Bieber

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
You should see Rob right now, he's all red in the face

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
This is my mother

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
My mom likes Lady Gaga

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
Do you like Lady Gaga?

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Yeah

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
She didn't use to

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
She thought Lady Gaga was disgusting

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
But then when I said Lady Gaga is cool

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
My mom came around

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
I'm still not coming around

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
I never said she was disgusting, I never really paid that much attention

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
You said when she did that performance

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
When she set the piano on fire

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Whiskey bottles and stuff

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
You were like, oh no

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
You were mad because Adam Lambert

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Got in trouble over kissing a guy

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
And everybody else

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
had grabbed their crotch

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
And everything, right?

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
And worse things were done by other people

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
And they didn't pay attention to it, that's what made me mad

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
That's what he said himself

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
He's like, well if all these other people can get away with it

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Why shouldn't I be able to?

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Exactly, on the same show

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
I can't remember, was it Janet Jackson?

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
I don't remember, somebody

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
Did something worse

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
Alright

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
They didn't even say anything

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
But I think he's getting past that now

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
And I'm glad

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Because I don't think people

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
Um

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
You know, they're not being that judgemental

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
About him anymore

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
We have to wrap up this extremely random

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Epilogue that's had nothing to do with

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Video games whatsoever, is there any video games you're excited

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
There's an American Idol video game

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Are there any video games you're excited about, mom?

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
I don't do video games

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Are you going to play Farmville?

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:24.000
I absolutely know nothing about video games

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
You don't know Farmville?

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Is that the one that

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
My friend was playing on the internet

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
Where you own a farm and you try to make money

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
She knows Farmville

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
There you go, see, she's a bigger gamer

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Well she was playing that on the internet, she got hooked on it

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Alright

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
You officially know more about the internet

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
Than my grandmother does

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
Congratulations

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
I don't know, I don't know a lot

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
She's come a long way in a year

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
No, I remember

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
I don't want to give out my mom's email on the show

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
But it's really funny

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
Absolutely not

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
I'm not, but it's really funny

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
Like if you know her email, it's really funny

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
But I actually remember a couple years ago

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
Actually we gave you a call a few years ago

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
And tried to ask you about something and you didn't

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Know because it was online

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
My mom's on the internet

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
My grandmother's on the internet now

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
My dad is on Facebook

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
I think that the apocalypse is happening

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Well I won't do Facebook

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
Why do you not want to go on Facebook?

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
Because I don't want to put my face on

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
There for a day, see

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Alright

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
Mom, we gotta wrap up and put the nail in the coffin

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
At the show, but thanks for being a good sport

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
It was good talking to you again

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Okay, I hope the right person runs next year

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
Alright, bye

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
I love you

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
Oh, she's hung up on me

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
I love you too

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
She's hung up on me

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
Wicked woman

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Okay, so Rob, next show that we do, we're calling my mother

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
We have to call her early though

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Alright, text her and get her to her age

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Alright, we really are wrapping up and it really is a night

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
Goodnight everybody, thanks for tuning in

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
Thank you for supporting our show

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
If you like the show, I forgot to say this earlier

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
Please post a nice review about us on iTunes and all that stuff

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
Tell a friend or two about the show

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
Help us spread the word, blah blah blah

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
The end, here's the ending theme, one more time to take us out

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
Goodnight

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
