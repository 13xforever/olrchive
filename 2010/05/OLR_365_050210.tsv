7000	8000	Who's the host?
8000	10000	Dark Sakura
10000	14000	Sky and Loco
14000	16000	Tonight, May 2nd, 2010
16000	19000	Is a 6 player 2D Castlevania game on the way
19000	21000	Bungie signs a new publishing deal
21000	27000	And is yet another sequel to Red Steel on the way
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	34000	Enough arguing about the graphics card in our chat room
34000	36000	Jeez, it's like all these wars
36000	37000	Can't we all just get along?
37000	43000	Oh hey, hello my friends and welcome to episode number 365 of Orange Lounge Radio
43000	45000	The video game talk show where every gamer has a voice
45000	49000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host
49000	53000	The one, the only, the ultimate, the sometimes friendly
53000	55000	Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
55000	56000	Hi
56000	57000	But always
57000	58000	My headache's gone
58000	60000	But always ready to make guacamole
60000	62000	Oh my guacamole was really good
62000	65000	Oh my guacamole
65000	67000	Okay, I have to say something because
67000	70000	You know how I said two weeks ago, two or three weeks ago
70000	72000	That I was going to give up fast food altogether
72000	74000	While I decided to go semi-raw
74000	77000	Oh my guac
77000	81000	Not fully vegan because if I have an opportunity to have sashimi
81000	83000	Then I'm going to eat sashimi
83000	86000	But for the most part, the easiest way to do it
86000	88000	Is to go kind of raw vegan
88000	91000	And it's because I've had so many digestion problems
91000	94000	And so many other health issues
94000	96000	That I think this is the best way to see if it
96000	98000	It can't hurt, it can only help
98000	100000	I will say this, years and years ago
100000	102000	Probably about seven, eight years ago
102000	103000	The crazy psychic
103000	105000	I used to date someone who was vegan
105000	106000	Allegedly
106000	108000	I used to date someone who was vegan
108000	110000	And he really, really liked to cook
110000	113000	And I will tell you, and I don't like to cook
113000	115000	So I would eat whatever the vegan would make
115000	118000	Well yeah, because I will eat anything a vegan makes
118000	121000	Because you know, at worst case scenario
121000	123000	It's like tofu surprise
123000	125000	They're not going to go, surprise, it's brains of a cow
125000	127000	Or you know, something in the dish
127000	129000	Or Rocky Mountain oysters
129000	132000	Yeah, you always know, it's vegetables
132000	134000	Chat room, ask me what it is if you don't know
134000	136000	But I will say this
136000	138000	Between that and that was at the peak
138000	140000	Of me playing DDR during the tournaments
140000	142000	And that was when the orange bat stuff happened
142000	144000	When the show was born, etc, etc
144000	146000	I was never thinner
146000	148000	Now I'm fat
148000	151000	And the whole thing of it is
151000	154000	I really just stopped and looked at everything
154000	156000	That I was consuming
156000	158000	I was having a couple of sugar free Red Bulls a day
158000	160000	And coffee
160000	162000	And I was having trouble sleeping, duh
162000	163000	Gee, I wonder why
163000	165000	And I was really stressed out from work
165000	167000	And from my school projects
167000	169000	That a lot of other stuff had going on
169000	171000	So I just decided that it's time
171000	174000	That I stop putting this off
174000	176000	Stop putting this?
176000	178000	Yeah, stop putting this off
178000	180000	And just start doing something for myself
180000	182000	And yeah, and no
182000	184000	It's not like the crazy vegan type of people
184000	187000	Like, oh, organic food is the only kind of food you can eat
187000	189000	And all these have drugs in them
189000	191000	Meat is murder
191000	193000	Yeah, fuck PETA
193000	195000	However
195000	197000	I do think that
197000	199000	The belief would not be there
199000	201000	If there hadn't been some basis for it
201000	203000	So
203000	205000	I'm doing this for me
205000	207000	I'm not doing it for the bunnies
207000	209000	I'm doing it for the cows
209000	211000	Although I did find that corn fed cow
211000	213000	Makes me sick
213000	215000	Grass fed cow does not
215000	217000	How strange
217000	219000	Keep in mind they feed cows antibiotics
219000	221000	To make them digest corn
221000	223000	Because cows are not meant to eat corn
223000	225000	Neither are humans
225000	227000	Anyhow
227000	229000	Let me go
229000	231000	I gotta introduce everybody here
231000	233000	I'm sorry for going off on it
233000	235000	But I have to say right now
235000	237000	My headache has finally gone away
237000	239000	Let me also introduce the host
239000	241000	Voted least likely to go vegetarian
241000	243000	Of all the OLR hosts
243000	245000	Say hello to the one and only tech master Loki
245000	247000	I'll never go vegetarian
247000	249000	You'd have to give up your double downs
249000	251000	I don't eat the double downs anymore
251000	253000	It's not worth it
253000	255000	Seriously
255000	257000	It was just experiment to see if it was any good
257000	259000	And I see right through their scam
259000	261000	Of giving me two pieces of chicken
261000	263000	For a lot of money
263000	265000	Tonight I notice you've gone back to the old standard
265000	267000	Personal sized pizza
267000	269000	Wrong it was six parmesan twists
269000	271000	Oh okay I'm sorry
271000	273000	And it's because those are really delicious
273000	275000	But also vegetarian
275000	277000	No
277000	279000	Not true vegetarian
279000	281000	Because it's cheese and all that stuff
281000	283000	La ba ba ba
283000	285000	Whatever the cheese and egg
285000	287000	Labia what?
287000	289000	Octolavio or something
289000	291000	I don't know
291000	293000	I haven't researched my vegan terminology
293000	295000	I did have eggs this morning though
295000	297000	Because I went out to breakfast
297000	299000	Maybe someone in our chat room knows the vegan terminology
299000	301000	Chat.orangesolentrated.com
301000	303000	Because we do tape live every week at
303000	305000	All Games Radio

337000	339000	How was your gaming week?
339000	341000	DarkSakura
341000	343000	I played more Babylonian Twins which is pretty fun
343000	345000	Super Street Fighter 4
345000	347000	Which Drury is mean and evil
347000	349000	And bad ass
349000	351000	Totally
351000	353000	And I played some pinball
353000	355000	And more
355000	357000	Espagaluda
357000	359000	Espagaluda 2
359000	361000	That's just kind of fun to say
361000	363000	Espagaluda
363000	365000	Espagaluda
365000	367000	Let's talk more Super Street Fighter 4 cause I
367000	369000	Bought it this week too
369000	371000	What console did you guys get it on?
371000	373000	We have 360
373000	375000	At PS3 but you guys have the fight stick right?
375000	377000	Why are you giggling?
377000	379000	Cause
379000	381000	That's cool
381000	383000	You guys have the fight stick on 360 right?
383000	385000	Yeah good times
385000	387000	But we do have some news though about
387000	389000	GameCrazy
389000	391000	And I was gonna wait until later on in the show
391000	393000	To say it cause I got an email
393000	395000	Well I didn't show roll it because I didn't know if you wanted
395000	397000	To talk about it or not but go ahead and take the floor
397000	399000	I said I was gonna wait but meh
399000	401000	GameCrazy's gone out of business
401000	403000	So instead of my husband
403000	405000	Having 3 weeks of work he's got 13
405000	407000	Weeks of work so that's good
407000	409000	But at the same time
409000	411000	Bye bye GameCrazy
411000	413000	I know the rumors have been floating
413000	415000	Around the internet and I think the stories we've seen on the internet
415000	417000	Were a rumor but
417000	419000	It's true
419000	421000	We got confirmation a week ago
421000	423000	So
423000	425000	I'm more like a couple days ago
425000	427000	But for every door that closes another opens
427000	429000	Blah blah blah blah blah
429000	431000	It'll be okay
431000	433000	We're not worried I'll put it this way we're not worried
433000	435000	So it's all good we're not worried
435000	437000	It's just a bummer though that
437000	439000	An alternative to
439000	441000	You know Baron Von GameStop
441000	443000	Is now closing you know
443000	445000	It seems like they're just dropping like flies
445000	447000	Did you totally see the game trader store that's on
447000	449000	Antelope? And there's more local
449000	451000	We sell them yes and I know they have their
451000	453000	Logo that's a blatant rip off
453000	455000	Identical to GameStop
455000	457000	Seriously the same
457000	459000	The same freaking font
459000	461000	I don't mean to get local
461000	463000	On you guys but maybe there's like
463000	465000	One or two sacri- here there's the guy
465000	467000	We met in the line at Target that listens to the show
467000	469000	So somebody in Sac- he's even still listening
469000	471000	Some people in Sacramento are listening
471000	473000	There's also
473000	475000	Have you seen that place on Sunrise? Smashburger
475000	477000	Yes that too
477000	479000	Same font, same white and red
479000	481000	Color and everything but it's a burger joint
481000	483000	The font
483000	485000	Is not a condensed font
485000	487000	Close, close
487000	489000	It's different enough that they can't
489000	491000	You're weird
491000	493000	I know I noticed this stuff
493000	495000	By the way, by the way I know
495000	497000	I'm gonna take a picture and put it on the site
497000	499000	But this is the newspaper that I did
499000	501000	Oh it's all like
501000	503000	Actually printed on paper
503000	505000	It's a very- it's like I can get all my
505000	507000	Jewish news
507000	509000	Well it was for a fundraiser
509000	511000	The temple that I go to had a big fundraiser called All That Jazz
511000	513000	You were plugging in on the show a couple weeks ago
513000	515000	They wanted a newspaper to distribute
515000	517000	No OLR fans at the show
517000	519000	I didn't go
519000	521000	You know why I didn't go Rob
521000	523000	Cause guess who's sitting her happy butt
523000	525000	Here in this chair doing OLR
525000	527000	I'm sorry
527000	529000	That was me
529000	531000	Anyhow, by the way there are some alternatives
531000	533000	There's what, the game trader
533000	535000	Is that what they're called? Game trader or traitor
535000	537000	Traitor
537000	539000	There's also that fair game
539000	541000	Now I know the guys there
541000	543000	The guys at fair game are rad
543000	545000	Aren't they expanding? Cause there's the one over on
545000	547000	Fair Oaks and then there's one right by my house
547000	549000	In Rosemont
549000	551000	Not that I should be plugging where I live
551000	553000	The guys there though, I do think that they
553000	555000	Kinda overcharge a little bit on some of their stuff
555000	557000	But they have a friggin copy of Loom
557000	559000	For the turbo graphics
559000	561000	It's kind of hard to get stuff there
561000	563000	And they also do
563000	565000	Disc resurfacing
565000	567000	And
567000	569000	Xbox
569000	571000	Repairs
571000	573000	Quote
573000	575000	Let me go to chat
575000	577000	chat.orangelandrarity.com
577000	579000	Rama says with GameCrazy going out of business we only have GameStop left
579000	581000	There's a lawsuit in there somewhere
581000	583000	Monopoly?
583000	585000	Trust me there's people that want to make game stores all the time
585000	587000	And just like
587000	589000	Blockbuster closing a bunch of stores
589000	591000	And Hollywood closing a bunch of stores
591000	593000	Well Hollywood's definitely going to be closing a lot of stores
593000	595000	And the same with movie galleries and stuff
595000	597000	How that has sparked the independent
597000	599000	Video growth
599000	601000	Now you're gonna see
601000	603000	The independent
603000	605000	Game store growth go up a little bit
605000	607000	I mean GameCrazies are out there
607000	609000	Definitely not out there as heavily
609000	611000	As say GameStop
611000	613000	Right now but
613000	615000	There's always alternatives
615000	617000	Search them out
617000	619000	You're also forgetting GameStop's biggest competitor
619000	621000	In some ways is Walmart
621000	623000	Target
623000	625000	Best Buy
625000	627000	You know those are all big big game retailers
627000	629000	Now as far as the used game market goes
629000	631000	I don't know
631000	633000	But you always hear rumors about those companies maybe wanting to get into it
633000	635000	I don't know
635000	637000	But it's just sad when
637000	639000	More stores like this close
639000	641000	Especially when it affects people we know
641000	643000	Very very well and so forth
643000	645000	I hope things go okay in that situation
645000	647000	Let us know if there's gonna be any good sales at least
647000	649000	Whatever silver lining
649000	651000	We can find in this tragic news
651000	653000	They are in the middle of liquidation
653000	655000	You know what they say, when life hands you lemons
655000	657000	Throw them back
657000	659000	Throw them against the wall, stomp on them, squish them
659000	661000	You know what, no no no
661000	663000	I like how Ron White puts it
663000	665000	To quote
665000	667000	When life gives you lemons, make lemonade
667000	669000	Or when life gives you lemons
669000	671000	Find someone who
671000	673000	Who gives potatoes and makes them
673000	675000	Put lemon vodka
675000	677000	Or something
677000	679000	I
679000	681000	I said it wrong
681000	683000	I said it wrong
683000	685000	When life gives you lemons, make lemonade
685000	687000	And then go find someone whose life gave them vodka
687000	689000	Alright
689000	691000	Loki
691000	693000	How was your gaming week?
693000	695000	I don't even remember if we were still talking about that or not
695000	697000	Once in a while we talk about video games
697000	699000	Amongst the guacamole and the vodka
699000	701000	Ron White quotes gone horribly wrong
701000	703000	Yeah
703000	705000	I played a few things this week
705000	707000	I tried out some of the
707000	709000	Upcoming Xbox Live arcade games
709000	711000	I mean not anything I was really impressed with
711000	713000	Cause they're just like ports of old arcade games
713000	715000	Or semi-recent arcade games I guess
715000	717000	Racestorm HD
717000	719000	Kinda cool
719000	721000	I actually have Racestorm on my
721000	723000	My arcade cabinet at home
723000	725000	So
725000	727000	Honestly it's just slightly
727000	729000	Crisper graphics
729000	731000	And that's it but otherwise it plays
731000	733000	Pretty much exactly the same
733000	735000	And then Neo Geo Battle
735000	737000	Coliseum
737000	739000	It was okay I actually never played that in the arcade
739000	741000	And it was kinda neat to be able to
741000	743000	Play as one of the characters from
743000	745000	Metal Slug in a fighting game
745000	747000	Cause he uses his gun a lot
747000	749000	But
749000	751000	It was pretty cool so that should be coming out hopefully
751000	753000	Soon I know Racestorm I think we have it
753000	755000	In the show role I think later on
755000	757000	So that's also coming soon
757000	759000	Then other things
759000	761000	Play more Grand Theft Auto
761000	763000	Still trying to
763000	765000	Dominate that and
765000	767000	Played against one guy today who thought
767000	769000	I love these people that
769000	771000	I play against that
771000	773000	Think they're so good and gonna
773000	775000	Teach me a lesson and stuff
775000	777000	Then I get like a thousand
777000	779000	Oh yeah
779000	781000	No no seriously they're like
781000	783000	You better remember that
783000	785000	Yes you better remember that you got a lucky kill
785000	787000	On me after I chased you down through the entire
787000	789000	Damn city trying to kill you even though I
789000	791000	Was $1500 dollars ahead
791000	793000	Oh yes you're so cool that you got one kill on me
793000	795000	I guess that totally negates
795000	797000	Those other 15 I got on you
797000	799000	So you will remember that as the
799000	801000	One kill they got on you all day
801000	803000	And then you quit. Loser
803000	805000	And then
805000	807000	I actually went back to playing
807000	809000	A little bit more free mode because it is damn
809000	811000	Hard to get a ranked deathmatch game
811000	813000	Nowadays especially in
813000	815000	The Battle of Gay Tony so
815000	817000	Free mode's actually been pretty fun we've been running
817000	819000	Across a bunch of strange
819000	821000	People on there so
821000	823000	Definitely a good time
823000	825000	Waster
825000	827000	Other non Grand Theft Auto
827000	829000	Related stuff played some Marvel vs. Capcom
829000	831000	2 on my arcade cabinet
831000	833000	Because I'm very excited
833000	835000	About the sequel coming out so
835000	837000	Gotta get some of that
837000	839000	In
839000	841000	Hopefully the server bought back because that's
841000	843000	Awesome character to play as
843000	845000	And then
845000	847000	I think
847000	849000	I think that's it for right now because I know I've been
849000	851000	Playing a lot of stuff but I just can't remember all of it
851000	853000	Alright
853000	855000	Well last week I didn't play a whole lot of games
855000	857000	So you guys would be very proud of me that I made up for lost time
857000	859000	This week I played Super Street Fighter 4
859000	861000	I bought it on PS3 because as I mentioned
861000	863000	On the show a couple weeks ago
863000	865000	I don't think I play enough
865000	867000	Street Fighter to really justify the
867000	869000	Arcade stick purchase
869000	871000	But I am a fan enough of Street Fighter where I
871000	873000	Want to buy the upgraded version of
873000	875000	Street Fighter so I bought it on PS3 because I've
875000	877000	Decided I'm declaring war on that
877000	879000	D-pad on the 360 and I'm not
879000	881000	Gonna buy games on the
881000	883000	360 that
883000	885000	Rely on that D-pad so much because
885000	887000	It's just poop and they need to
887000	889000	Release a new controller I don't know why it's taking them so long
889000	891000	So the Playstation 3
891000	893000	What's frustrating is they did
893000	895000	At one time remember in Europe
895000	897000	They had the green one and they fixed the D-pad
897000	899000	Apparently
899000	901000	Why would you
901000	903000	They're waiting for Natal or something I don't know
903000	905000	No they're not waiting for anything why would you
905000	907000	Fix the problem and go
907000	909000	Well we're not gonna fix it forever we're just gonna
909000	911000	Fix it for this one run
911000	913000	I know there's people out there and especially
913000	915000	Xbox and so forth
915000	917000	Believe me I hate on all systems equally
917000	919000	That are gonna tell me that
919000	921000	You're just hating on Xbox
921000	923000	No it really made a difference
923000	925000	I noticed the difference in actually being able to pull off
925000	927000	Combos and certain controls and maneuvers
927000	929000	On the PS3 way easier
929000	931000	Than I was on the 360 so I'm just putting it
931000	933000	Out there that's a personal preference I suppose
933000	935000	And everybody has their own but I did notice
935000	937000	The difference right away in playing on the PS3
937000	939000	On that controller
939000	941000	But the game itself putting the console
941000	943000	Wars and so forth aside going to
943000	945000	The game itself I liked
945000	947000	It quite a lot I thought it was a very worthy
947000	949000	Upgrade and a good purchase you know
949000	951000	Street Fighter 4 as it was was a great
951000	953000	Game but this upgrade having all the
953000	955000	Characters unlocked from the start having
955000	957000	The extra 10 characters and some of the characters
957000	959000	Are awesome like Dark Soccer said
959000	961000	I love Juri as well she's awesome
961000	963000	I like playing her online she's a cheap
963000	965000	Mofo she is
965000	967000	And I love cheap Mofo as in Street Fighter
967000	969000	I was drawn
969000	971000	To her because you know when I was playing the game
971000	973000	Alan was saying like she doesn't look like she belongs
973000	975000	In Street Fighter what is this what is
975000	977000	Her she doesn't she doesn't fit
977000	979000	So I had to play as her and sure enough
979000	981000	She really kind of doesn't look like she belongs
981000	983000	In Street Fighter but she's cool
983000	985000	But I will tell you who I love
985000	987000	Is Guy that is
987000	989000	Oh I love Guy that's my favorite character to play
989000	991000	He's just fun and I like how
991000	993000	Like every you know parting shot
993000	995000	Of him is his butt
995000	997000	They have this thing with butts in Super Street Fighter 4
997000	999000	Have you noticed? No I mean
999000	1001000	Surprise no I just
1001000	1003000	Really like playing as him because he can fly across
1003000	1005000	The screen and do all these cheap kick moves that I love
1005000	1007000	I love Guy did you play Cody?
1007000	1009000	No but I
1009000	1011000	Alan did and kicked my ass
1011000	1013000	He was throwing rocks at me and it was pissing me off
1013000	1015000	Yeah and picking up the knife and everything
1015000	1017000	I think Guy can use him too though
1017000	1019000	I tried playing Hakan and I thought
1019000	1021000	The Turkish oil wrestler
1021000	1023000	I thought he was kind of hokey I didn't like playing as him
1023000	1025000	But then again I'm not a big fan of the Zangief
1025000	1027000	T-Hawk type of characters
1027000	1029000	Well the whole point with him is that you're supposed to
1029000	1031000	Build up his oil
1031000	1033000	You know over and over and over and when he's really slick
1033000	1035000	Then you can do like all of these crazy moves
1035000	1037000	Yeah I know but
1037000	1039000	I don't have the patience
1039000	1041000	And I have to say though that
1041000	1043000	If you've ever seen Turkish oil wrestling
1043000	1045000	He's really glorifying it way too much
1045000	1047000	I have to tell you though
1047000	1049000	This is a huge accomplishment for me
1049000	1051000	I was playing matches online
1051000	1053000	Ranked matches and winning some
1053000	1055000	Like that's huge for me because I don't think
1055000	1057000	I ever won a single one on 360
1057000	1059000	But I won my first match on PS3
1059000	1061000	I'm not winning them all but I'm winning some
1061000	1063000	I gotta say
1063000	1065000	The skill match I'm getting
1065000	1067000	Is actually pretty good because
1067000	1069000	Like I will play a guy
1069000	1071000	And go for like five rounds if the game
1071000	1073000	Is configured that way and you know
1073000	1075000	Win narrowly and
1075000	1077000	There will be like another guy I was fighting back and forth
1077000	1079000	We just kept coming up against each other
1079000	1081000	Ranked matches and he won half and I won half
1081000	1083000	Like it's actually really matching me up pretty well
1083000	1085000	So I gotta uh
1085000	1087000	I gotta say that
1087000	1089000	Tigerclaw in chat says oh here's another thing guys
1089000	1091000	If you play as Guy or Cody in the car smasher bonus
1091000	1093000	Stage you get the oh my car
1093000	1095000	Easter egg, oh I thought that was normal
1095000	1097000	Because the first time I ever played that bonus stage
1097000	1099000	Was with Guy and I just thought
1099000	1101000	That was what was supposed to happen
1101000	1103000	But that makes sense because that happens in Final Fight too
1103000	1105000	Speaking of Final Fight
1105000	1107000	Alan and I decided just for the hell of it we would
1107000	1109000	Play through all of Final Fight
1109000	1111000	Double Impact version, the Final Fight game
1111000	1113000	And so we played through the whole game
1113000	1115000	The other night, it doesn't take that long
1115000	1117000	Maybe an hour at most so that was kind of fun to play
1117000	1119000	And so we went through that and
1119000	1121000	The other big big event
1121000	1123000	In my world is that I
1123000	1125000	Finally said I can't take it anymore
1125000	1127000	With my old graphics card
1127000	1129000	And I upgraded to a new video card
1129000	1131000	In my computer so
1131000	1133000	Finally WoW is running at top speed
1133000	1135000	60 frames a second is beautiful
1135000	1137000	Gorgeous but more importantly
1137000	1139000	I'm also able to play
1139000	1141000	Games on my PC that I wasn't able to
1141000	1143000	Play before because my graphics card
1143000	1145000	Was kind of shoddy and one of those big ones
1145000	1147000	Would be Dragon Age so I
1147000	1149000	Finally, because I bought Dragon Age during the Christmas
1149000	1151000	Sale when it was only like 30 bucks
1151000	1153000	But I was really having a hard time
1153000	1155000	Playing it because my old video card just couldn't
1155000	1157000	Handle it and for those of you that are asking
1157000	1159000	It was a 8, I originally
1159000	1161000	Had an ATI Radeon
1161000	1163000	3300
1163000	1165000	I think in my computer
1165000	1167000	And so I decided
1167000	1169000	I don't want to restart the video card wars
1169000	1171000	That were starting at the beginning of the show but I thought
1171000	1173000	It would just be easier since my
1173000	1175000	Computer had come with an ATI card originally
1175000	1177000	Just to get another ATI card
1177000	1179000	Call that stupid logic if you want
1179000	1181000	Whatever I don't care the card I got works
1181000	1183000	I got an ATI Radeon
1183000	1185000	5770
1185000	1187000	And there was a lot of drama trying to get the card
1187000	1189000	Installed because
1189000	1191000	Bless Alan's heart he knows how to do all that stuff
1191000	1193000	I could probably
1193000	1195000	Figure it out but this thing
1195000	1197000	Would have confused the hell out of me because this
1197000	1199000	Graphic card like takes up two slots
1199000	1201000	It's so big and has like
1201000	1203000	This gigantic fan on it and that would have
1203000	1205000	Confused me and then we had to actually
1205000	1207000	Go upgrade the power supply
1207000	1209000	Because it needs its own power source
1209000	1211000	And like it can't run on
1211000	1213000	The old power supply I had
1213000	1215000	So yeah thank god he knew how to recognize all this
1215000	1217000	Stuff because I would have just been lost and cried
1217000	1219000	You might have been able to get away with the old power supply
1219000	1221000	If you had the converter for it but
1221000	1223000	We just got a new supply it was like 30 bucks
1223000	1225000	And now it's like 600 watts
1225000	1227000	As opposed to 300 so it works great
1227000	1229000	Oh 300 yeah
1229000	1231000	So yeah no the card works great
1231000	1233000	I was able to play Dragon Age so I was playing that for a couple hours
1233000	1235000	Did a little bit of the
1235000	1237000	Warrior human beginning because Alan wanted to show me
1237000	1239000	Some stuff there and I was
1239000	1241000	Playing the mage opening a little bit earlier today
1241000	1243000	Which played so much better
1243000	1245000	But I understand this game is on
1245000	1247000	Consoles but man I can't
1247000	1249000	Imagine how it must control on consoles because on
1249000	1251000	The computer it's just so
1251000	1253000	Fluid and just makes sense
1253000	1255000	Especially for like somebody who's kind of been playing
1255000	1257000	WoW a long time like me so
1257000	1259000	I am considering checking out
1259000	1261000	Star Trek online just because Dark Soccer
1261000	1263000	Always never shuts up about it and
1263000	1265000	It's fun I know but here's the thing
1265000	1267000	There was a big sale on the store
1267000	1269000	Steam store this weekend I couldn't resist
1269000	1271000	I bought Guild Wars trilogy for 20 bucks
1271000	1273000	And you got to admit
1273000	1275000	It's not a bad deal for Guild Wars
1275000	1277000	Because Guild Wars is one of those games
1277000	1279000	You don't pay a monthly fee for it so I
1279000	1281000	Can buy it now and if I have the itch to play it
1281000	1283000	In like six months I can just say oh just fire
1283000	1285000	Up Guild Wars Did you overclock your graphics card
1285000	1287000	Once you got it? I don't think he did that
1287000	1289000	Oh he should it's simple
1289000	1291000	And it's extra
1291000	1293000	Oomph it runs beautifully
1293000	1295000	I'll tell you what Guild Wars looks gorgeous
1295000	1297000	I started playing the Prophecies
1297000	1299000	Campaign as a Paragon which you know
1299000	1301000	I had only I'm sorry no no
1301000	1303000	No Prophecies is the original so I was
1303000	1305000	Playing Nightfall whatever the newest one is
1305000	1307000	I played that as a
1307000	1309000	Paragon which is one of the new classes
1309000	1311000	They're kind of like Egyptian influenced it seems like
1311000	1313000	And so I was playing through the openings that it's
1313000	1315000	Gorgeous oh my gosh
1315000	1317000	Gorgeous looking stuff
1317000	1319000	So I didn't really play it enough
1319000	1321000	I mean both Dragon Age and Guild Wars I only
1321000	1323000	Spent a couple hours with so but I just
1323000	1325000	It's fun to be able to play PC games
1325000	1327000	Again and not have my computer crying out
1327000	1329000	In pain from it and what's also
1329000	1331000	Exciting and I just realized on the drive over
1331000	1333000	Here is that
1333000	1335000	Between that new card my quad core
1335000	1337000	My 8 gigs of ram I ain't gonna have a
1337000	1339000	Problem playing Final Fantasy 14 on my PC
1339000	1341000	Woo woo
1341000	1343000	So waiting for that baby test
1343000	1345000	Help
1345000	1347000	I need to upgrade my graphics cards because I have two of them
1347000	1349000	Running in SLI but they're like
1349000	1351000	8800 Radeon GTS
1351000	1352000	512
1352000	1354000	Do you want my old card? I don't know what's better
1354000	1356000	I have a power supply and an old video card
1356000	1358000	My card's way better than that
1358000	1360000	It's just a lot of stuff
1360000	1362000	Like if I were to go back and do it again
1362000	1364000	A lot of these games don't run
1364000	1366000	SLI and it's really disappointing
1366000	1368000	And I guess you don't really get that much benefit from it nowadays
1368000	1370000	But um
1370000	1372000	I don't know I've got two slots
1372000	1374000	To put graphics cards I almost feel obligated
1374000	1376000	To get two more but
1376000	1378000	Brad from Pod Culture
1378000	1380000	In chat says Sky didn't know it was on sale
1380000	1382000	You just sold me on it there you go
1382000	1384000	When you write NCsoft put
1384000	1386000	As heard on OLR
1386000	1388000	No but that's great no but I think the logic
1388000	1390000	Is fine because you know 20 bucks
1390000	1392000	For the three game series and no monthly fee
1392000	1394000	I mean that's a pretty darn good deal
1394000	1396000	Guild Wars isn't a bad game by any means
1396000	1398000	I don't think you'll play it forever
1398000	1400000	But I think you'll kind of go
1400000	1402000	It's one of those games you'll be like
1402000	1404000	You know I'm kind of bored of WoW and Star Trek
1404000	1406000	And Final Fantasy and all the other MMOs
1406000	1408000	I'm playing right now
1408000	1410000	Just fire up Guild Wars for the hell of it
1410000	1412000	What the hell is going on in Guild Wars these days
1412000	1414000	That's kind of how I've found it
1414000	1416000	I've played on and off for the past five years
1416000	1418000	Alright anyhow enough of our gaming weeks
1418000	1420000	Let's move on and get into some housekeeping tonight
1420000	1422000	I don't have a lot except for
1422000	1424000	I might not be here Memorial Day weekend
1424000	1426000	It looks like I might be taking a trip
1426000	1428000	So we might not have a show then
1428000	1430000	Pre-taped or something something
1430000	1432000	But that's the first time I'm also telling Jamie and Loki
1432000	1434000	Because I didn't think of it earlier
1434000	1436000	We'll see
1436000	1438000	Memorial Day weekend
1438000	1440000	Three day weekend so if you guys want to get away
1440000	1442000	I'm planning a trip it looks like
1442000	1444000	I probably won't be here
1444000	1446000	We'll see
1446000	1448000	It's not going to be an extravagant trip
1448000	1450000	Just a little getaway
1450000	1452000	Anyhow
1452000	1454000	More to come on that in the upcoming weeks
1454000	1456000	We'll let you know for sure what's going to happen
1456000	1458000	That's Memorial Day weekend
1458000	1460000	Which I imagine a lot of our listeners
1460000	1462000	A lot of them are probably going out of town
1462000	1464000	Anyhow
1464000	1466000	Also our Twitter
1466000	1468000	Twitter.com slash OLR and our Facebook
1468000	1470000	Of course is available too at Orange Lounge Radio
1470000	1472000	Join us there, friend us
1472000	1474000	Like our posts, share us, help us spread the word
1474000	1476000	Because we don't really have advertising dollars
1476000	1478000	Another place where we could really use help
1478000	1480000	iTunes and five star reviews on iTunes
1480000	1482000	Just look up Orange Lounge Radio in the iTunes store
1482000	1484000	And say a couple nice words about Orange Lounge Radio
1484000	1486000	We really appreciate
1486000	1488000	It really does go a long way
1488000	1490000	Because the more positive reviews you get
1490000	1492000	The higher you go up in the rankings
1492000	1494000	And you get a little more visibility
1494000	1496000	And it works
1496000	1498000	That's why a lot of podcasts you listen to
1498000	1500000	Want to get the reviews on iTunes
1500000	1502000	Because sometimes it's hard to stand out amongst the crowd
1502000	1504000	And I'll tell you what, it's tough
1504000	1506000	When you have G4 and IGN
1506000	1508000	And GameSpot and all these companies with
1508000	1510000	Limitless amounts of dollars
1510000	1512000	And budget to pour into advertising
1512000	1514000	It's hard to stand out amongst that
1514000	1516000	So we rely on the OL Army to help us out
1516000	1518000	Alright, let's actually get into some gaming news
1518000	1520000	We'll have to actually put down the guacamole
1520000	1522000	For a little bit, step away from the vegetables
1522000	1524000	And get into some actual gaming news
1524000	1526000	Loki, start us off tonight
1526000	1528000	I like to call this kind of like
1528000	1530000	I don't want to go on the same tangent
1530000	1532000	As we did last week, but
1532000	1534000	Kind of like Idols gives back
1534000	1536000	This is Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2
1536000	1538000	Gives back, I guess
1538000	1540000	Apparently with the new
1540000	1542000	Firmware or dashboard
1542000	1544000	That was out
1544000	1546000	At the beginning of April
1546000	1548000	On the Xbox 360
1548000	1550000	Comes with it some glitches
1550000	1552000	For some reason that work with
1552000	1554000	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2
1554000	1556000	Allowing certain arcade games
1556000	1558000	That you may have in trial form
1558000	1560000	To work as a full game
1560000	1562000	Instead, without having to pay
1562000	1564000	Any extra monies
1564000	1566000	Uh oh, uh oh
1566000	1568000	So here's how it works, and it couldn't be
1568000	1570000	Any simpler
1570000	1572000	Of course you have to have the latest dashboard
1572000	1574000	The 9199, the one that allows
1574000	1576000	You to have the USB support
1576000	1578000	Pop in your Modern Warfare 2 disk
1578000	1580000	Let the game load up to the main menu
1580000	1582000	Once you get to the main menu, hit the wonderful
1582000	1584000	Xbox guide button
1584000	1586000	That's on your controller
1586000	1588000	And it will pull up of course the old
1588000	1590000	Kind of blades
1590000	1592000	That you can select stuff
1592000	1594000	Go to quick launch
1594000	1596000	And choose the trial game of choice
1596000	1598000	To play it as a full version
1598000	1600000	Now this doesn't work on all games yet
1600000	1602000	And there's really just a small list that they have
1602000	1604000	So far that it works with
1604000	1606000	But I mean, hey, might as well try it on
1606000	1608000	Whatever
1608000	1610000	Some of the games that have been shown to work with it so far
1610000	1612000	Fatal Fury Special
1612000	1614000	Metal Slug 3
1614000	1616000	Samurai Shodown 2
1616000	1618000	And Metal Slug 7
1618000	1620000	All those of course being published by SNK
1620000	1622000	So maybe other SNK games
1622000	1624000	Might work as well
1624000	1626000	Let's see
1626000	1628000	And apparently also there might be
1628000	1630000	The King of Fighters 98 Ultimate Match
1630000	1632000	And Guru
1632000	1634000	Mark of Wolves
1634000	1636000	I might play on it as well
1636000	1638000	Okay, break this down for me
1638000	1640000	How smart do I have to be with my hacking cracking sense
1640000	1642000	To get this to work?
1642000	1644000	You don't have to hack anything
1644000	1646000	It's just part of the dashboard
1646000	1648000	It's basically, it's just a glitch
1648000	1650000	All you have to do is pop in your game
1650000	1652000	Modern Warfare 2
1652000	1654000	Put a button on your controller
1654000	1656000	And then select quick launch to
1656000	1658000	How does that happen?
1658000	1660000	I don't know
1660000	1662000	I don't know how you would figure it out either
1662000	1664000	That is really bad
1664000	1666000	It's not that we necessarily enjoy
1666000	1668000	Bringing these things to light
1668000	1670000	But I think it needs to be said
1670000	1672000	Like, oops
1672000	1674000	This is a huge flaw
1674000	1676000	And you can earn achievements on those games as well
1676000	1678000	Oh my gosh
1678000	1680000	I would imagine it's gonna get patched out at some point
1680000	1682000	But might as well enjoy it while it lasts
1682000	1684000	We need to introduce something new here on
1684000	1686000	Orange Lounge Radio called
1686000	1688000	The Dup Factor
1688000	1690000	That's right, the Dup Factor
1694000	1696000	And the Dup Factor would be
1696000	1698000	Days until the patch
1698000	1700000	DUP, Days Until Patch
1700000	1702000	Loki, what do you believe is the
1702000	1704000	Dup Factor?
1704000	1706000	I'm not sure because I don't think this is
1706000	1708000	This hasn't been published on like
1708000	1710000	Major blog sites or anything like that
1710000	1712000	Usually when it does hit those
1712000	1714000	Good thing no one listens to this show
1714000	1716000	Yeah it's a good thing
1716000	1718000	Once that happens they'll be like
1718000	1720000	Because
1720000	1722000	Obviously Microsoft doesn't read every forum
1722000	1724000	Out there so
1724000	1726000	It's hard to say
1726000	1728000	Yeah, so that's interesting
1728000	1730000	And if you don't happen to have
1730000	1732000	Mario Warfare 2 that's okay
1732000	1734000	Because there's other glitches that also involve
1734000	1736000	The 9199 dashboard
1736000	1738000	As well, a couple of the games
1738000	1740000	Were also found to be working
1740000	1742000	As full Xbox Live arcade
1742000	1744000	Games as well
1744000	1746000	Apparently
1746000	1748000	Some of them have to do
1748000	1750000	With
1750000	1752000	Like for example Worms
1752000	1754000	Is one of the games that actually works as a full
1754000	1756000	Xbox Live arcade game if you
1756000	1758000	Transfer it to a USB card
1758000	1760000	Because originally they did have
1760000	1762000	A version of Worms that came on a memory
1762000	1764000	Unit and it actually worked as a full game
1764000	1766000	As long as it was on a memory
1766000	1768000	Unit so you can try that as well
1768000	1770000	And that doesn't require any sort of game
1770000	1772000	Purchasing whatsoever
1772000	1774000	And apparently
1774000	1776000	Family Game Night has something else that
1776000	1778000	Works like that as well
1778000	1780000	But I'm not sure
1780000	1782000	What's involved with that one
1782000	1784000	But it's just interesting to see
1784000	1786000	That a lot of these glitches are out there
1786000	1788000	I put the dump factor at
1788000	1790000	7 days. I say by this time
1790000	1792000	Next week it's out
1792000	1794000	I think the
1794000	1796000	Red alarms are going off at
1796000	1798000	Microsoft as we speak
1798000	1800000	I just found out about it this week
1800000	1802000	This has been posted for about 3 weeks
1802000	1804000	Now so
1804000	1806000	Has anyone, what was the last posting
1806000	1808000	Date? The 22nd
1808000	1810000	So it may already
1810000	1812000	No
1812000	1814000	It nothings
1814000	1816000	No I think somebody would have said something in that little thread he's looking at
1816000	1818000	If that's the case
1818000	1820000	We would have seen a patch on the dashboard
1820000	1822000	Or we would have seen a patch for Call of Duty
1822000	1824000	I say 7 days
1824000	1826000	We'll see
1826000	1828000	Alright
1828000	1830000	Now Loki I'm sure you would not be taking
1830000	1832000	Advantage of a patch like this
1832000	1834000	Or if you have it's only for journalistic purposes
1834000	1836000	I don't really care
1836000	1838000	And honestly
1838000	1840000	Yeah it's just the SNK games
1840000	1842000	Well
1842000	1844000	Dude I have a JTAG console
1844000	1846000	I don't need this crap
1846000	1848000	Alright
1848000	1850000	Moving on to other stories
1850000	1852000	That aren't so shady
1852000	1854000	But more of a surprise I think in some ways
1854000	1856000	Nintendo Magazine in France
1856000	1858000	Apparently has confirmed the existence of
1858000	1860000	Red Steel 3
1860000	1862000	Apparently the series
1862000	1864000	Which as you know is kind of like a first person hack and slash
1864000	1866000	Type of thing
1866000	1868000	It's going to be a trilogy even though apparently the second game
1868000	1870000	Did not sell that well which you were talking about last week
1870000	1872000	On the show right Loki?
1872000	1874000	Red Steel 2 not doing so hot?
1874000	1876000	Well they were saying it wasn't doing hot
1876000	1878000	Because they only have data from like
1878000	1880000	You know what 10 days
1880000	1882000	Not that long
1882000	1884000	Well apparently the game is going to support
1884000	1886000	The Wii Vitality sensor
1886000	1888000	Oh god fail
1888000	1890000	Right there fail
1890000	1892000	I'm sorry
1892000	1894000	That's going to be awful okay
1894000	1896000	Absolutely awful because
1896000	1898000	What's the point at that
1898000	1900000	So how are you going to control the game now
1900000	1902000	Because you're going to have
1902000	1904000	Where are you going to plug the nunchuck into
1904000	1906000	And come up with some sort of splitter or something like that
1906000	1908000	For the Wii remote
1908000	1910000	I can't see how this is going to work
1912000	1914000	I don't know either
1914000	1916000	I don't write the news I just report it just so you know
1916000	1918000	Fail
1918000	1920000	That's all I got to say
1920000	1922000	I was looking for a clip of the old school DDR failed boys
1922000	1924000	To play
1924000	1926000	Behind that
1926000	1928000	There was a couple other things I wanted to say about this
1928000	1930000	It's supposed to
1930000	1932000	I guess this is just part of
1932000	1934000	If you think about it Red Steel 2
1934000	1936000	Supported the motion plus
1936000	1938000	Red Steel was kind of a launch
1938000	1940000	Title for the Wii
1940000	1942000	It would not be a surprise if this supports the Vitality sensor
1942000	1944000	Because it's just yet another add on
1944000	1946000	Of Nintendo's that Ubisoft is supporting
1946000	1948000	The only one that Red Steel really didn't
1948000	1950000	Get on was the balance board
1950000	1952000	To be honest
1952000	1954000	So
1954000	1956000	There you go even though Loki is not a big fan of it
1956000	1958000	Apparently Red Steel 3 with Vitality sensors
1958000	1960000	The Vitality sensor is retarded
1960000	1962000	I'm sorry it's absolutely retarded
1962000	1964000	Yeah it will be wonderful
1964000	1966000	For the Wii Relax game that comes out
1966000	1968000	And people will buy it because it's like
1968000	1970000	Oh look you can relax now
1970000	1972000	Now that Nintendo is helping you
1972000	1974000	How do you really know yet though
1974000	1976000	I mean all you've really heard about this
1976000	1978000	Is a concept you haven't seen it in motion yet
1978000	1980000	Maybe it will be neat
1980000	1982000	No it won't
1982000	1984000	That's like saying oh blood pressure
1984000	1986000	You know I get to take my blood pressure now
1986000	1988000	That's so exciting
1988000	1990000	I mean old people are like that
1990000	1992000	You know they go to the drug store
1992000	1994000	Take their blood pressure
1994000	1996000	Well I beg to differ
1996000	1998000	Who's buying the Wii
1998000	2000000	I actually beg to differ
2000000	2002000	Well they're not going to be playing Red Steel 3
2002000	2004000	I
2004000	2006000	Well this is someone who gets a blood test twice a year
2006000	2008000	And has her blood pressure checked regularly
2008000	2010000	So
2010000	2012000	Yeah but is it fun
2012000	2014000	If it keeps me alive
2014000	2016000	Yeah but I don't consider that fun
2016000	2018000	I had to have four MRIs
2018000	2020000	A couple years ago to keep me alive
2020000	2022000	But I wasn't exactly like gosh I wish I had one of these at home
2022000	2024000	It's a lot of fun
2024000	2026000	It's like a colonoscopy
2026000	2028000	Oh that helps you stay alive
2028000	2030000	Some people get off on that
2030000	2032000	The Wii virtual colon sensor
2032000	2034000	Thanks god
2034000	2036000	For when the Human Centipede video game comes out
2040000	2042000	I'm just saying though
2042000	2044000	Fun aside
2044000	2046000	I do want to say
2046000	2048000	They'll be illegitimate
2048000	2050000	And they did say there was like a subtitle
2050000	2052000	At least on the Human Centipede
2052000	2054000	That it makes it seem like it's going to be one of a series
2054000	2056000	So I'm like
2056000	2058000	That discussion on that movie
2058000	2060000	Has gotten far too much airtime
2060000	2062000	On the all news network
2062000	2064000	Let's move on to some more
2064000	2066000	Video game stories
2066000	2068000	I was actually putting something up for you Rob
2068000	2070000	What's that
2070000	2072000	Come and look at it
2072000	2074000	Is that Gaia?
2074000	2076000	Yes it is but so they put up an item called
2076000	2078000	Starmony
2078000	2080000	That's a little rainbow unicorn that says open your eyes
2080000	2082000	Loki's the rainbow unicorn fan
2082000	2084000	Not me
2084000	2086000	Who's the one that's always playing the rainbow unicorn game
2086000	2088000	That would be Loki
2088000	2090000	You need to put that on his wall
2090000	2092000	I'm going to post it on my Facebook later
2092000	2094000	But I thought it was funny
2094000	2096000	Anyway
2096000	2098000	So how about a story
2098000	2100000	How about something about Guitar Hero
2100000	2102000	I think
2102000	2104000	Is that
2104000	2106000	Activision is sending out the feelers
2106000	2108000	To see if people would be interested
2108000	2110000	In Red Hot Chili Peppers
2110000	2112000	Guitar Hero
2112000	2114000	I guess but aren't most of their songs
2114000	2116000	In like Rock Band or Guitar Hero
2116000	2118000	Already?
2118000	2120000	Isn't the whole Blood Sugar Sex Magic album
2120000	2122000	On Rock Band?
2122000	2124000	I think that it's
2124000	2126000	Supposed to also have an exclusive
2126000	2128000	For their new album
2128000	2130000	Oh
2130000	2132000	That's at least the speculation
2132000	2134000	But then again
2134000	2136000	You can get the whole thing of Blood Sugar Sex Magic
2136000	2138000	On Rock Band
2138000	2140000	But I mean
2140000	2142000	The Red Hot Chili Peppers were much more than one album
2142000	2144000	I mean they are
2144000	2146000	They're an important band
2146000	2148000	I've been listening to their stuff since George Clinton produced them
2148000	2150000	You know
2150000	2152000	P-Funk
2152000	2154000	Parliament
2154000	2156000	Multicolored dreads
2156000	2158000	They gotta be older
2158000	2160000	I think
2160000	2162000	40's at most
2162000	2164000	They've been doing it a long time
2164000	2166000	I was listening
2166000	2168000	Blood Sugar Sex Magic came out
2168000	2170000	When I was in high school
2170000	2172000	And I had already been listening to
2172000	2174000	Actually a song off of Mother's Milk
2174000	2176000	Was in Say Anything
2176000	2178000	So that's late 80's
2178000	2180000	I think they started in
2180000	2182000	84?
2182000	2184000	Well I mean if Green Day
2184000	2186000	Can have their own game
2186000	2188000	But Red Hot Chili Peppers is far more
2188000	2190000	Expansive than Green Day
2190000	2192000	I agree to an extent
2192000	2194000	Yeah
2194000	2196000	But
2196000	2198000	I think it's a good choice
2198000	2200000	For their own video game
2200000	2202000	I would look at it
2202000	2204000	I don't know if I'd pay $50 for it
2204000	2206000	But I'd look at it and I'd go oh neat I like these songs
2206000	2208000	You know
2208000	2210000	So
2210000	2212000	We'll see though I don't know
2212000	2214000	There's a part of me that goes I don't know Guitar Hero Van Halen
2214000	2216000	Was kind of poop
2216000	2218000	Yeah
2218000	2220000	They're better off sticking with Rock Band
2220000	2222000	Just putting out more content for Rock Band
2222000	2224000	We'll see
2224000	2226000	Well I'm just like
2226000	2228000	Cause I thought they were supposed to be
2228000	2230000	Cutting back
2230000	2232000	Well I guess they sort of have cut back on Guitar Hero a little bit
2232000	2234000	Cause we haven't had a game in like 6 months
2234000	2236000	Well not 6 months 4 months
2236000	2238000	Yeah 6 months
2238000	2240000	Is that counting DS versions and all that?
2240000	2242000	And yes
2242000	2244000	It does count DS versions and whatnot
2244000	2246000	And nothing I've seen
2246000	2248000	On the horizon yet until like
2248000	2250000	Fall
2250000	2252000	Which is good
2252000	2254000	So here's a rumor that's kind of interesting
2254000	2256000	We may have talked about it
2256000	2258000	A little bit before when it was
2258000	2260000	Discovered as a trademark
2260000	2262000	From Konami, Harmony of Despair
2262000	2264000	Well the
2264000	2266000	A trusted source as
2266000	2268000	Joisic puts it
2268000	2270000	Harmony of Despair
2270000	2272000	Is a 2D 6 player
2272000	2274000	Xbox Live arcade game
2274000	2276000	You'll get to play as some of the old
2276000	2278000	Characters or I guess main characters from a bunch
2278000	2280000	Of different games and it's supposed to kind of
2280000	2282000	Appear like
2282000	2284000	The Game Boy Advance or DS
2284000	2286000	Versions
2286000	2288000	Of the game so I guess like you know
2288000	2290000	Super NES type of thing
2290000	2292000	And you'll get to play
2292000	2294000	With a bunch of people at the same time
2294000	2296000	And they'll actually be able to zoom out
2296000	2298000	To show where everyone's at
2298000	2300000	And stuff like that so 6 player co-op
2300000	2302000	Castlevania sounds kind of fun actually
2302000	2304000	I feel like God has finally
2304000	2306000	Listened to me, thank you
2306000	2308000	Thank you Jesus
2308000	2310000	This is what I've been asking for
2310000	2312000	For how long now on this program
2312000	2314000	Give me a old school
2314000	2316000	2D new Castlevania
2316000	2318000	Game on my television
2318000	2320000	And this sounds sweet that it's gonna be like
2320000	2322000	6 player zoomy in out co-op stuff
2322000	2324000	Sounds kind of rad actually
2324000	2326000	Sounds way better than Judgment
2326000	2328000	And then when you're done with this Nintendo give us a new Metroid like this
2328000	2330000	And then when you're done with this
2330000	2332000	Konami can come back and give me a new Contra like this
2332000	2334000	No Frogger
2334000	2336000	Do not want Frogger
2336000	2338000	With 6 people
2338000	2340000	Unless it's an
2340000	2342000	Extreme Frogger
2342000	2344000	I gotta admit though this sounds very awesome
2344000	2346000	Like can you imagine being able to explore
2346000	2348000	The castle with multiple people at the same time
2348000	2350000	But how would that work because
2350000	2352000	There's gonna have to be some type of like
2352000	2354000	Random castle generator element
2354000	2356000	To it or something or else it's always gonna be the
2356000	2358000	Same damn game
2358000	2360000	Obviously this is a very
2360000	2362000	Early type of story and it's also rumor right
2362000	2364000	It's not confirmed
2364000	2366000	But maybe they're gonna have multiple castles
2366000	2368000	Or something like that or you'll be able to download
2368000	2370000	Extra castles later on
2370000	2372000	I really want more information on this soon
2372000	2374000	This sounds great
2374000	2376000	Or maybe that partner net site
2376000	2378000	Will leak everything like it always does
2378000	2380000	That would be wonderful too
2380000	2382000	I know what do you think your
2382000	2384000	Castlevania fan Dark Soccer would like to see?
2384000	2386000	Oh I'd be all over that heck yeah
2386000	2388000	We're gonna play 6 player heck yeah
2388000	2390000	Dude totally
2390000	2392000	That's right I'll whip you
2392000	2394000	But think about it I bet Dark Soccer
2394000	2396000	If they're talking about multiple characters
2396000	2398000	You'll get to be
2398000	2400000	You'll get to be Alucard
2400000	2402000	You'll get to be Maria
2402000	2404000	I bet hands down a lot of the famous Castlevania
2404000	2406000	I do remember they had
2406000	2408000	I would have to play
2408000	2410000	They had Alucard on the list
2410000	2412000	There was another site that covered it also
2412000	2414000	They had some more information but
2414000	2416000	I remember Alucard being on the list
2416000	2418000	Amae Satsuma in our chatroom
2418000	2420000	chat.orangelandstrategy.com says
2420000	2422000	I'd be fine with a 6 player Frogger
2422000	2424000	If I could play as a truck
2424000	2426000	That would be awesome
2426000	2428000	I want to play as a gator
2428000	2430000	That's like Frogger versus
2430000	2432000	Remember in Pacman versus you could be the ghost
2432000	2434000	That would be amazingly fun
2434000	2436000	Total side note
2436000	2438000	It's not on our show roll but I think this chatroom
2438000	2440000	Comment is worth reading Spyro in our chat says
2440000	2442000	Is there no more game room games being
2442000	2444000	Released now? You know they were supposed
2444000	2446000	To put out like Pitfall
2446000	2448000	And Super
2448000	2450000	Breakout I think were some of the big
2450000	2452000	Games this week and it got halted
2452000	2454000	The release just
2454000	2456000	Didn't end up happening
2456000	2458000	And there was actually a tweet
2458000	2460000	Over on god I can't believe I'm using
2460000	2462000	Twitter but the thing is
2462000	2464000	Game room did not have much of a good
2464000	2466000	Website behind it I mean I guess they have an official
2466000	2468000	Website but it kind of sucks
2468000	2470000	They don't have the greatest web presence I don't know
2470000	2472000	This thing was kind of set up to fail from the beginning
2472000	2474000	But on their Twitter which is
2474000	2476000	At live game room they say
2476000	2478000	First off they
2478000	2480000	Broke the news by
2480000	2482000	Retweeting Major Nelson
2482000	2484000	Just shows you how
2484000	2486000	It's totally burped excuse me
2486000	2488000	That's awesome
2488000	2490000	Professional radio
2490000	2492000	They broke the news by retweeting
2492000	2494000	Major Nelson saying
2494000	2496000	We're working to bring you additional game room titles
2496000	2498000	As soon as possible I'll let you know
2498000	2500000	The moment I have more details
2500000	2502000	And then they
2502000	2504000	Sent an at message to somebody
2504000	2506000	Saying there was a delay in the game pack release
2506000	2508000	We'll update when we've got more details
2508000	2510000	That's it
2510000	2512000	So I mean fail fail fail fail
2512000	2514000	I kind of regret
2514000	2516000	A couple weeks ago when I was
2516000	2518000	Reviewing game room on the show I said
2518000	2520000	Hey this is going to be better than
2520000	2522000	Virtual Console because at least you know
2522000	2524000	Although it has plenty of room for improvement
2524000	2526000	It's more than just straight up ports of the games
2526000	2528000	Well I mean
2528000	2530000	At least games are
2530000	2532000	Coming out for Virtual Console
2532000	2534000	It just
2534000	2536000	Irritates me because there was so
2536000	2538000	Much potential
2538000	2540000	Here
2540000	2542000	Can you imagine if they had
2542000	2544000	I'm sorry they have just crashed
2544000	2546000	And burned with
2546000	2548000	It's so frustrating
2548000	2550000	It's an awesome idea
2550000	2552000	Well they should have integrated it with
2552000	2554000	Like different Xbox Live
2554000	2556000	Arcade games so it wouldn't matter
2556000	2558000	That they're not putting out any because you could
2558000	2560000	Still use your Xbox Live arcade games
2560000	2562000	And have them in your arcade
2562000	2564000	And what not
2564000	2566000	And then here's the thing
2566000	2568000	SHJ100Matt says Seriously game room was supposed to be
2568000	2570000	Microsoft's answer to home
2570000	2572000	But it's just as much of a failure as home so far
2572000	2574000	That is
2574000	2576000	I don't know if I'm okay with the game room
2576000	2578000	Home comparisons
2578000	2580000	I think people assumed
2580000	2582000	It was going to be like home
2582000	2584000	Because you would be able to navigate around in the first person
2584000	2586000	Which was I don't think ever the case
2586000	2588000	I think Microsoft's always kind of strung you along
2588000	2590000	With the well maybe we'll implement that someday
2590000	2592000	Dude you can't even fucking release
2592000	2594000	A new pack for the game on time
2594000	2596000	You're not going to have the full
2596000	2598000	First person movement around like home
2598000	2600000	Ever
2600000	2602000	Ever
2602000	2604000	Prove me wrong please
2604000	2606000	I'm just irritated because the problem is
2606000	2608000	If this fails
2608000	2610000	Which it's starting to look more and more like it's going to
2610000	2612000	And how fucking disappointing is that
2612000	2614000	That we're never going to get any more packs for this game
2614000	2616000	At the rate we're going
2616000	2618000	You know whatever happened to like the 1000 games
2618000	2620000	If this thing fails
2620000	2622000	We're not going to see anything like it
2622000	2624000	Until maybe the next generation
2624000	2626000	Maybe
2626000	2628000	Maybe on Nintendo's Wii HD
2628000	2630000	Or whatever console they do after the Wii
2630000	2632000	Maybe they will finally say
2632000	2634000	Okay you can play the old NES games
2634000	2636000	Over the internet after you re-buy them
2636000	2638000	For five bucks a piece
2638000	2640000	Just irritates me
2640000	2642000	I am mad
2642000	2644000	Anyway
2644000	2646000	Rob
2646000	2648000	Deep breaths
2648000	2650000	As a retro game fan
2650000	2652000	You know I was really excited about
2652000	2654000	A lot that Game Room had to bring
2654000	2656000	And it didn't really suck
2656000	2658000	I mean there was a lot of promise with it
2658000	2660000	I mean yeah they could have had a little more
2660000	2662000	Hopefully
2662000	2664000	I'm just overreacting and this is all fixed
2664000	2666000	In a week I mean maybe they had problems
2666000	2668000	With the whole PC and I heard people
2668000	2670000	Were able to hack certain games in Game Room
2670000	2672000	Like a lot of the high scores on asteroids
2672000	2674000	Were faked so maybe for quality
2674000	2676000	Purposes they pulled it back
2676000	2678000	But when I hear about these layoffs
2678000	2680000	When I see crappy web support
2680000	2682000	You know for this
2682000	2684000	My hope fades more and more
2684000	2686000	I have a feeling that there's going to be all sorts of
2686000	2688000	Exploits
2688000	2690000	With it because it's in file form
2690000	2692000	And people have modded consoles
2692000	2694000	And they're going to hex edit crap
2694000	2696000	So that they can cheat in the games
2696000	2698000	It's going to script the leaderboards
2700000	2702000	Prove me wrong Microsoft please
2702000	2704000	Please I would love to get proven wrong on this
2704000	2706000	Meanwhile other news
2706000	2708000	PlayStation 3 and here's something
2708000	2710000	Else to rage about
2710000	2712000	Of course
2712000	2714000	We reported a couple weeks ago on the show
2714000	2716000	And I'm sure you read about it everywhere on the internet
2716000	2718000	You saw this first hand
2718000	2720000	They took out the other OS feature
2720000	2722000	On the PlayStation 3
2722000	2724000	They released a patch to do nothing
2724000	2726000	But remove a feature on the PlayStation 3
2726000	2728000	And I believe we said
2728000	2730000	Oh I wonder how long before somebody sues
2730000	2732000	Well days until suing
2732000	2734000	Would apparently be about two weeks
2734000	2736000	That's right about 14 days
2736000	2738000	Somebody sued
2738000	2740000	A class action lawsuit for removing
2740000	2742000	The PlayStation 3 support for other OS's
2742000	2744000	Anthony Ventura is the
2744000	2746000	Class action lawsuit filers name
2746000	2748000	The plaintiff
2748000	2750000	I'm a plaintiff
2750000	2752000	He filed a class action lawsuit against the company
2752000	2754000	Saying that it's a breach of contract
2754000	2756000	False advertising
2756000	2758000	And you know all this other big legal words
2758000	2760000	He says that the other OS function is extremely
2760000	2762000	Valuable
2762000	2764000	Although players are not forced to download the update
2764000	2766000	If you don't you can't access
2766000	2768000	The other features on your PlayStation
2768000	2770000	So you're either locked out over here
2770000	2772000	Or you're locked out over here
2772000	2774000	Apparently the amount is in excess
2774000	2776000	Of five million dollars
2776000	2778000	Is how much they're looking to get in damages
2778000	2780000	I don't know if it'll work
2780000	2782000	But it's interesting that somebody's actually
2782000	2784000	Filed the lawsuit over this
2784000	2786000	As I suspected somebody probably
2786000	2788000	Would in this too happy nation that we're in
2788000	2790000	I don't know what do you guys think
2790000	2792000	Will happen with this lawsuit
2792000	2794000	I don't know it'd be interesting to see
2794000	2796000	How it plays out
2796000	2798000	I'm interested because I have a system
2798000	2800000	That you know hasn't been updated yet
2800000	2802000	And I'm not planning on updating it
2802000	2804000	Because guess what I haven't bought any new games
2804000	2806000	For it since
2806000	2808000	LittleBigPlanet
2808000	2810000	I think the biggest kicker here is
2810000	2812000	Are they gonna be able to prove that this was
2812000	2814000	An advertised feature
2814000	2816000	That's gonna be tough
2816000	2818000	And I don't think they're gonna be able to get away with it
2818000	2820000	Maybe in other countries but not here
2820000	2822000	I don't remember that being advertised
2822000	2824000	It's not on a commercial or something
2824000	2826000	But they did advertise it coming out of E3
2826000	2828000	And that kind of stuff
2828000	2830000	It's a console it's not like you know
2830000	2832000	People didn't know it was there
2832000	2834000	But I do think it's kind of
2834000	2836000	Messed up
2836000	2838000	It's the whole kind of conspiracy part of it
2838000	2840000	Or I guess paranoia part of it
2840000	2842000	It's like if they're gonna take this out
2842000	2844000	Because some hacker or whatever
2844000	2846000	Found a way around
2846000	2848000	You know their copy protection
2848000	2850000	Which didn't really happen
2850000	2852000	I don't think anyone's actually found a way around
2852000	2854000	Their copy protection yet other than the fact that
2854000	2856000	They're starting to mess around
2856000	2858000	With Linux but
2858000	2860000	You know if that's the case
2860000	2862000	Then what if someone finds a way with
2862000	2864000	You know the Xbox or not Xbox
2864000	2866000	PlayStation 1 emulation or something like that
2866000	2868000	Or are they gonna remove that too
2868000	2870000	Or you know
2870000	2872000	Even on older consoles
2872000	2874000	That can play PlayStation 2 games what if they find a way with that
2874000	2876000	Are they gonna remove the PlayStation 2
2876000	2878000	You know backwards compatibility
2878000	2880000	I'm surprised they haven't
2880000	2882000	So I don't know
2882000	2884000	And yeah let's just say for example
2884000	2886000	That they decide later on
2886000	2888000	Hey you know what we're gonna start selling PlayStation 2 games
2888000	2890000	On the PlayStation Network
2890000	2892000	Now we're gonna remove your backwards compatibility
2892000	2894000	So you have to buy those games from us
2894000	2896000	Again
2896000	2898000	That would be kind of shady
2898000	2900000	And if you want to play your PlayStation 2 games
2900000	2902000	You can go buy one of our $99.99
2902000	2904000	PlayStation 2 slim systems
2906000	2908000	But at the same time
2908000	2910000	Let me play devil's advocate for a minute here
2910000	2912000	Because Rama says forget the lawsuit
2912000	2914000	People just trade in your PS3's
2914000	2916000	For something worthwhile
2916000	2918000	That chat coming from chat.orangestonsrated.com
2918000	2920000	Well I mean to play devil's advocate
2920000	2922000	You never could install Linux on a 360
2922000	2924000	You can't even get the web on your 360
2924000	2926000	I mean
2926000	2928000	You can now but
2928000	2930000	Well
2930000	2932000	Without legitimately
2932000	2934000	None of these features are possible
2934000	2936000	I mean you can still get the other OS feature
2936000	2938000	On your PlayStation 3 too if you know where to look
2938000	2940000	Right
2940000	2942000	Um
2942000	2944000	Not yet
2944000	2946000	Well it's being worked on or something
2946000	2948000	Anyway
2948000	2950000	Uh yeah I guess we'll see what develops with this
2950000	2952000	It'll be very interesting though because you know what happens
2952000	2954000	Is that if this guy wins
2954000	2956000	You'll all be able to get a check in the mail for like
2956000	2958000	Five whole dollars
2958000	2960000	Cause that's what happens with class action lawsuits
2960000	2962000	Or maybe they'll have to give out a free game or something
2962000	2964000	I don't know
2964000	2966000	Yeah but I mean what if that free game is like
2966000	2968000	Yaris 2 for the PS3 or something
2968000	2970000	It doesn't have to be a good game
2970000	2972000	Freeze free?
2972000	2974000	I don't know
2974000	2976000	There's some things that you couldn't even pay me to play for free
2976000	2978000	It's like bad
2978000	2980000	Anyway let's move on more gaming news Darcy
2980000	2982000	How about something happier? Yes happy happy joy joy
2982000	2984000	Cub Scouts!
2984000	2986000	I thought you said happier
2986000	2988000	Yeah okay I know little Mormons in training
2988000	2990000	Um sorry I didn't say that
2990000	2992000	I was in the Cub Scouts for a year
2992000	2994000	One whole year
2994000	2996000	I was in the Cub Scouts and the Boy Scouts
2996000	2998000	Never became a Mormon
2998000	3000000	In fact I
3000000	3002000	Just learned how to set fire to things and tie knots
3002000	3004000	I forgot the knots part
3004000	3006000	Oh if only they knew I was a gay in training
3006000	3008000	It's so awesome though
3008000	3010000	I mean seriously if you want to have fun as
3010000	3012000	You know in the Boy Scouts or something like that
3012000	3014000	Just buy the damn manual
3014000	3016000	Give it to your kid, have them read through it
3016000	3018000	That's all the information you need
3018000	3020000	The rest is just camping trips and pinewood car derby
3020000	3022000	That's all it really is
3022000	3024000	So about video games
3024000	3026000	That was awesome
3026000	3028000	I love how Dark Soccer is like
3028000	3030000	I swear to god I have news to report
3030000	3032000	Will you boys stop reminiscing about your stupid scout troops?
3032000	3034000	We build wooden cars
3034000	3036000	Just so you know
3036000	3038000	Anyway hi
3038000	3040000	So for the Cub Scouts
3040000	3042000	There's a new
3042000	3044000	A new badge available
3044000	3046000	Or sorry belt loop
3046000	3048000	Or whatever the crap that means
3048000	3050000	You can get a video game
3050000	3052000	Belt loop
3052000	3054000	I guess
3054000	3056000	I don't get a belt loop
3056000	3058000	I don't remember them having
3058000	3060000	I remember the badges
3060000	3062000	They actually could sew on and then there was the little
3062000	3064000	Patches, there were patches and there were badges
3064000	3066000	So now they have belt loops too whatever
3066000	3068000	They get more bling
3068000	3070000	It was pins back in my day
3070000	3072000	Yeah that's what I meant, pins
3072000	3074000	I remember they would flip the kid upside down
3074000	3076000	And put the pin on when the kid was upside down
3076000	3078000	And then like when you actually did
3078000	3080000	Whatever your parents could turn it right
3080000	3082000	Side up as if you weren't capable of just
3082000	3084000	Doing it yourself but
3084000	3086000	If you did you'd go to hell
3086000	3088000	I remember that part
3090000	3092000	You actually need to watch the episode
3092000	3094000	Of bullshit about scouting
3094000	3096000	You make John Smith cry
3096000	3098000	They took
3098000	3100000	Anyway I'm gonna
3100000	3102000	Can I tell you a true story? I'm sorry Dark Soccer
3102000	3104000	I know you have a legitimate gaming story here
3104000	3106000	Hey guess what? What? My mother
3106000	3108000	Carrot Pulled me out of Cub Scout
3108000	3110000	She didn't want me going anymore
3110000	3112000	You know why? True story
3112000	3114000	She didn't like the other kids in my troop
3114000	3116000	She thought all the other kids in my troop
3116000	3118000	And 10 years later
3118000	3120000	She told me this
3120000	3122000	All the other little kids in your troop
3122000	3124000	Were little assholes
3124000	3126000	I love your mom
3128000	3130000	And I didn't want you hanging out with those assholes
3130000	3132000	I love your mom
3134000	3136000	So Rob
3136000	3138000	I'm not saying that you might be listening to the show
3138000	3140000	I'm just saying that
3140000	3142000	The Roseville troop was a bunch of assholes
3142000	3144000	Allegedly
3144000	3146000	So the whole way to get
3146000	3148000	This video game belt loop
3148000	3150000	You have to complete three tasks
3150000	3152000	And I think this is actually a really positive thing
3152000	3154000	Explain why it's important to have a rating system
3154000	3156000	For video games
3156000	3158000	With an adult's help
3158000	3160000	Make a schedule to do things that include your
3160000	3162000	Chores, homework, video games
3162000	3164000	And you have to stick to schedule
3164000	3166000	And learn to play any video game that is approved
3166000	3168000	By your parent, guardian, or teacher
3168000	3170000	So I guess imagine babies might be on it or something
3170000	3172000	After you get the belt loop
3172000	3174000	Um
3174000	3176000	You earn a pin by
3176000	3178000	Completing five of nine tasks
3178000	3180000	Which would be
3180000	3182000	With your parents create a plan to buy a video game
3182000	3184000	That is right for your age group
3184000	3186000	That's hard
3186000	3188000	Compare two game systems
3188000	3190000	Explain the differences between the two
3190000	3192000	And good purchase
3192000	3194000	Or use of a game system
3194000	3196000	Play a video game with family members
3196000	3198000	In a family tournament
3198000	3200000	Teach an adult or friend how to play a video game
3200000	3202000	List at least five tips that would help someone
3202000	3204000	Who was learning how to play your favorite video game
3204000	3206000	Play an appropriate video game
3206000	3208000	With a friend for one hour
3208000	3210000	So no imagine babies
3210000	3212000	Play a video game that will help
3212000	3214000	Practice math, spelling, or other skills
3214000	3216000	To help you in your school work
3216000	3218000	Choose a game you might like to purchase
3218000	3220000	And compare the price at three different stores
3220000	3222000	To decide which one is the best deal
3222000	3224000	Include
3224000	3226000	Factors like return policy and warranty
3226000	3228000	And with an adult supervision
3228000	3230000	Install a gaming system
3230000	3232000	Um
3232000	3234000	Okay
3234000	3236000	I think it's good because it's encouraging
3236000	3238000	You know, family time
3238000	3240000	It could be good for parents
3240000	3242000	To demystify
3242000	3244000	Video games
3244000	3246000	Yeah, it's not a bad thing
3246000	3248000	I know we're sitting here and tee-heeing about it
3248000	3250000	But it's encouraging
3250000	3252000	What should be happening in the first place
3252000	3254000	Parents and kids to talk about
3254000	3256000	The kids hobby
3256000	3258000	Who would have thought
3258000	3260000	When I was a kid, my papa and I
3260000	3262000	My dad's father
3262000	3264000	We used to sit around playing Jackal
3264000	3266000	On Nintendo
3266000	3268000	On the big screen TV
3268000	3270000	Which is a war game where you shoot people
3270000	3272000	And run over them in a tank
3272000	3274000	And we played, get this
3274000	3276000	Abadox
3276000	3278000	Disgusting game at the time
3278000	3280000	I love Abadox for the record
3280000	3282000	I could imagine coming home from a Cub Scout meeting
3282000	3284000	And telling my mom
3284000	3286000	Hey mom, uh
3286000	3288000	I want to get this video game badge that they're giving away
3288000	3290000	So would you sit for me for an hour
3290000	3292000	While I install a video game system
3292000	3294000	And show you how to do it? She'd just be like
3294000	3296000	Where's the paper that I just signed?
3296000	3298000	Hahahaha
3298000	3300000	Well also, um
3300000	3306000	There, um
3306000	3308000	I think that that kind of also
3308000	3310000	You know, sort of discounts
3310000	3312000	The fact that a lot of these parents might have grown up
3312000	3314000	With video games too
3314000	3316000	You know, my mom and I used to play
3316000	3318000	Tetris together
3318000	3320000	And we used to play Super Mario Brothers
3320000	3322000	In all kinds of games and
3322000	3324000	Okay
3324000	3326000	Stop trying to smack the fly
3326000	3328000	With your pizza box
3328000	3330000	You're gonna fly on the loose in the studio
3330000	3332000	Keep in mind
3332000	3334000	It flew outside, it flew outside
3334000	3336000	Stay out
3336000	3338000	In two days it will be dead
3338000	3340000	Not if I can help it
3340000	3342000	I'll take that long
3342000	3344000	Flies really don't live longer than a few days
3344000	3346000	That's the comfort I take in that
3346000	3348000	They're going to die soon
3348000	3350000	Tangent Lounge Radio, back to the Cub Scouts please
3350000	3352000	I have carrots
3352000	3354000	They're delicious and raw
3354000	3356000	Cub Scouts!
3356000	3358000	They should program a game
3358000	3360000	I'm very disappointed, well that's a programming badge
3360000	3362000	Um, I'm very disappointed though
3362000	3364000	That not one of those little
3364000	3366000	I guess, uh
3366000	3368000	Achievements or requirements on that list
3368000	3370000	Is go to arcade
3370000	3372000	Well, cause there are no arcades
3372000	3374000	That's a myth
3374000	3376000	In some parts of the
3376000	3378000	States, there are no arcades
3378000	3380000	Well then, you know what, you don't really want that badge now
3380000	3382000	Do you?
3382000	3384000	Here's the thing, the only problem
3384000	3386000	I don't want to even like open this door
3386000	3388000	And go there, but you know, I live there
3388000	3390000	Uh, the only problem I have
3390000	3392000	With this badge, like I think it's a good thing
3392000	3394000	And it's encouraging the family to talk, yada yada yada
3394000	3396000	Is that this badge could go right next to your
3396000	3398000	Queer hating badge, because
3398000	3400000	You know, the Boy Scouts won't
3400000	3402000	You know the whole thing about how, you know
3402000	3404000	They won't let, um
3404000	3406000	Gay guys be Scout Masters and so forth
3406000	3408000	Because apparently
3408000	3410000	All gay guys know how to do
3410000	3412000	Is molest kids
3412000	3414000	They won't let them be Scouts
3414000	3416000	At all
3416000	3418000	I think at that age, you're kind of too
3418000	3420000	Young to know anyway, so I think
3420000	3422000	That arguments are relevant, like
3422000	3424000	Honestly, like, you know, how
3424000	3426000	Old are Boy Scouts, like 12 to like
3426000	3428000	15, like you just
3428000	3430000	Here, everything
3430000	3432000	Is, it's not even
3432000	3434000	An issue at that age, you know what I mean, if it is an issue
3434000	3436000	You're too young, just don't even
3436000	3438000	Think about that stuff, but um
3438000	3440000	You know, it does kind of
3440000	3442000	Irritate me that they don't really have
3442000	3444000	A good reason for
3444000	3446000	Justifying why
3446000	3448000	I don't know why homos
3448000	3450000	Will want to be involved with such an organization
3450000	3452000	That hates them, but if they do, they should
3452000	3454000	You know, get to do it. My problem is, why is this
3454000	3456000	Even a badge in the first place, because I thought
3456000	3458000	The Boy Scouts and Cub Scouts and whatever
3458000	3460000	Were all about, kind of like
3460000	3462000	The whole outdoors, you know
3462000	3464000	The Woodsmen, you know
3464000	3466000	Type mentality, where it's like learning
3466000	3468000	How to kind of, not really necessarily
3468000	3470000	Survive, but there are survival
3470000	3472000	Tools in there as well, and
3472000	3474000	You know, kind of, you know, how to be
3474000	3476000	Good, you know, participant
3476000	3478000	In your, you know
3478000	3480000	Social circle or whatever
3480000	3482000	You know, being a good community member, I thought that was
3482000	3484000	Really the values that they were
3484000	3486000	Trying to put forth, and this is kind of
3486000	3488000	Unnecessary, because like, I mean seriously
3488000	3490000	They're gonna have a badge for learning how to use windows
3490000	3492000	You know, or, look, I installed
3492000	3494000	The Mac today, or you know, I've
3494000	3496000	I don't know
3496000	3498000	I learned how to program my VCR
3498000	3500000	My TiVo badge, you know, and seriously
3500000	3502000	It's not really necessary
3502000	3504000	It's kind of just
3504000	3506000	Good that you know how to do that stuff
3506000	3508000	And good that you're spending time with your family
3508000	3510000	And that kind of thing, but
3510000	3512000	It doesn't need to be a badge
3512000	3514000	I think it's just being
3514000	3516000	Used as a convenient tool
3516000	3518000	To teach economics
3518000	3520000	Good shopping skills and family
3520000	3522000	I think it's just Boy Scouts trying to be hip
3522000	3524000	I think you're right
3524000	3526000	Because maybe the
3526000	3528000	Memberships are down or something
3528000	3530000	It's fine
3530000	3532000	Question, or I'm sorry, comment
3532000	3534000	From the chatroom, chat.org.org.com
3534000	3536000	Sharan in chat says, you don't need to be gay
3536000	3538000	To know how to molest children
3538000	3540000	No, you just have to know how to be a priest
3540000	3542000	Ohhhhh, and if that joke offended
3542000	3544000	You, guess what, now you know how
3544000	3546000	Offended I get when I hear
3546000	3548000	The rationalization for why gays
3548000	3550000	Can't be in Boy Scouts, and there
3550000	3552000	You have it
3552000	3554000	See, I offended people but to teach a lesson
3554000	3556000	Now you know how I feel
3556000	3558000	Alright
3558000	3560000	It is offensive, moving on
3560000	3562000	Release dates
3562000	3564000	Let's go to the US and see what games
3564000	3566000	Are gonna be coming out soon, Loki
3566000	3568000	Not much, this week is pretty light
3568000	3570000	And it's sad that one of the biggest
3570000	3572000	Games this week is actually
3572000	3574000	Iron Man 2
3574000	3576000	Of course, coming out on
3576000	3578000	Friday in theaters
3578000	3580000	You gotta have your typical movie tying game
3580000	3582000	But don't worry, Sega says that this game
3582000	3584000	Isn't crap like the last one
3584000	3586000	That's famous last
3586000	3588000	Words from people that make crappy ported
3588000	3590000	Or movie tying games
3590000	3592000	Other fun
3592000	3594000	Stuff coming out this week, Picross
3594000	3596000	3D
3596000	3598000	Picross, but it's in 3D form
3598000	3600000	And you make nice little cube animals
3604000	3606000	The Total War
3606000	3608000	Battle Pack, kind of a
3608000	3610000	Pre-release of the Total War games
3610000	3612000	Coming out on PC this week
3612000	3614000	Fat Princess Fistful of Cake
3614000	3616000	Making its way out on UMD
3616000	3618000	For the PSP, of course it's
3618000	3620000	I think already out on the PSP
3620000	3622000	In the PlayStation Network
3624000	3626000	Dance Sensation
3626000	3628000	Kind of
3628000	3630000	Trying to take advantage of the adjust
3630000	3632000	Dance craze, but
3632000	3634000	Purely aimed at girls
3634000	3638000	And Dementium 2
3638000	3640000	Out on DS, this would be the perfect
3640000	3642000	Game to purchase for that
3642000	3644000	Cup Scout badge
3644000	3646000	And
3646000	3648000	Also this week, the official
3648000	3650000	Xbox 360
3650000	3652000	USB Flash Sticks
3652000	3654000	These are hilarious
3654000	3656000	And I'm laughing at the prices
3656000	3658000	An 8GB
3658000	3660000	USB flash drive will cost you
3660000	3662000	$39.99 and
3662000	3664000	A 16GB flash drive
3664000	3666000	Will run you $69.99
3666000	3668000	I was just pricing these online
3668000	3670000	Because I'm planning on picking up an 8GB
3670000	3672000	And guess what, you can get them for about half the price
3672000	3674000	So really, thank you Microsoft
3674000	3676000	For still overcharging
3676000	3678000	It's not gonna work as well with
3678000	3680000	A USB stick
3680000	3682000	And that's it for this week
3682000	3684000	Let's head on over to Japan
3684000	3686000	And look at the Japanese releases
3686000	3688000	What's coming out on the Xbox 360
3688000	3690000	This week, really nothing, believe it or not
3690000	3692000	Not really anything coming out at all
3692000	3694000	On the Xbox 360 this week
3694000	3696000	Again, these are Japanese releases
3696000	3698000	And sometimes, you know, there's big variants
3698000	3700000	On the Playstation 3
3700000	3702000	Also not a lot coming out this week
3702000	3704000	I don't know what, is there like a holiday or something
3704000	3706000	Going on in Japan right now?
3706000	3708000	Golden Week
3708000	3710000	It's a big
3710000	3712000	No, no, no
3712000	3714000	If I remember right, Golden Week
3714000	3716000	Is when families go back to their hometowns
3716000	3718000	And
3718000	3720000	They visit with people, like everything's closed
3720000	3722000	I just know the 5th of May is Children's Day
3722000	3724000	Oh, maybe that explains
3724000	3726000	Where the holiday comes from in WoW
3726000	3728000	Because it's Children's Week in WoW right now
3728000	3730000	Yeah, I totally just made a Warcraft reference
3730000	3732000	Hey, Nintendo Wii, also nothing
3732000	3734000	This week, really, no releases till the 13th of May
3734000	3736000	Playstation 2
3736000	3738000	Nothing, DS, nothing
3738000	3740000	PSP, nothing
3740000	3742000	Nothing is coming out in Japan until the 13th
3742000	3744000	Okay, by the way, I found it
3744000	3746000	What's that?
3746000	3748000	It's a paid time off
3748000	3750000	On the work days
3750000	3752000	Some companies completely close down and give their employees
3752000	3754000	Time off, it's the longest vacation
3754000	3756000	Period of the year for many Japanese jobs
3756000	3758000	So, yeah
3758000	3760000	Wish we had that over here
3760000	3762000	I know, I want Golden Week, how about Golden Arches Week
3762000	3764000	We have FIFA World Cup
3764000	3766000	Soccer to look forward to when Golden Week's
3766000	3768000	Over, that's going to be a big release on the 13th
3768000	3770000	It's because there's
3770000	3772000	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
3772000	3774000	Holidays during
3774000	3776000	That period of time
3776000	3778000	Well, we get Cinco de Mayo over here
3778000	3780000	We don't get it off, do we?
3780000	3782000	Yay
3782000	3784000	Really, I don't think Cinco de Mayo is really
3784000	3786000	Actually an American holiday anyway
3786000	3788000	It's just one we kind of borrowed
3788000	3790000	From our neighbors to have an excuse to drink
3790000	3792000	Mexican food potluck day
3792000	3794000	Exactly
3794000	3796000	As if work needed another excuse to have a potluck
3798000	3800000	Alright
3800000	3802000	Let's move on
3802000	3804000	Okay, is there any holidays in the UK
3804000	3806000	Stopping video games this week?
3806000	3808000	Uh, no. I don't think so
3808000	3810000	Why don't they celebrate Cinco de Mayo?
3812000	3814000	Runaway 3
3814000	3816000	For DS
3816000	3818000	Runaway A Twisted Fate for PC
3818000	3820000	On the 7th, by the way
3820000	3822000	Sin and Punishment 2 for Wii
3822000	3824000	And What Did I Do to Deserve This, My Lord?
3824000	3826000	Dude, that's awesome that they're getting Sin and Punishment 2
3826000	3828000	Seeing as ours has been delayed
3828000	3830000	Yeah
3830000	3832000	On PSP and that's really it
3832000	3834000	Alright
3834000	3836000	A few more gaming stories for you guys
3836000	3838000	And then the classic game of the week
3838000	3840000	Where Dark Soccer is gonna dig through the vaults
3840000	3842000	And believe me, kids, she's diggin' this week
3842000	3844000	Loki
3844000	3846000	You may remember that Microsoft
3846000	3848000	Sue Datel over their unofficial
3848000	3850000	Max memory
3850000	3852000	Memory cards that they had out
3852000	3854000	Because they took
3854000	3856000	Little micro SD cards and allowed you to use them
3856000	3858000	On the
3858000	3860000	Xbox 360
3860000	3862000	Which now that I think of it, it's kind of funny
3862000	3864000	Because, um
3864000	3866000	They actually
3866000	3868000	Now that they've opened that up
3868000	3870000	You don't really need these memory cards
3870000	3872000	Talk about, uh
3872000	3874000	Sucking
3874000	3876000	Anyways, so
3876000	3878000	To kind of respond to
3878000	3880000	Datel's request
3880000	3882000	They filed an antitrust
3882000	3884000	Lawsuit against Microsoft
3884000	3886000	Pissed off that they weren't
3886000	3888000	Kind of playing on even
3888000	3890000	Playing ground here
3890000	3892000	And, um
3892000	3894000	Yeah, I kind of remember this whole
3894000	3896000	Back and forth from a couple weeks ago, yeah
3896000	3898000	Yeah, they're basically saying, um
3898000	3900000	That the
3900000	3902000	Claims that by
3902000	3904000	Datel
3904000	3906000	That they locked them out with a firmware update
3906000	3908000	And Microsoft has used its
3908000	3910000	Status as a platform holder to
3910000	3912000	Unlawfully prevent competition
3912000	3914000	Which, I can see that
3914000	3916000	Because there's a lot of
3916000	3918000	You know, um
3918000	3920000	A lot of first party, you know, products out there
3920000	3922000	But there's a lot of stuff that, you know, you have to get
3922000	3924000	Approval from Microsoft to build the release
3924000	3926000	Items for those systems
3926000	3928000	And I think that pretty much goes with any other system
3928000	3930000	But, seeing as the Wii
3930000	3932000	And, um, the
3932000	3934000	PlayStation 3 used kind of open
3934000	3936000	Storage formats, you know
3936000	3938000	The SD memory cards and USB
3938000	3940000	Memory sticks and stuff like that
3940000	3942000	Now Microsoft, um
3942000	3944000	You can see how that would be a problem
3944000	3946000	Since they were
3946000	3948000	Prior to the last firmware update
3948000	3950000	Only allowed to use
3950000	3952000	Either the hard drive or a
3952000	3954000	A memory stick
3954000	3956000	Memory unit from Microsoft
3956000	3958000	They're saying
3958000	3960000	Microsoft's motion to dismiss
3960000	3962000	Because they tried to dismiss it, it claimed that
3962000	3964000	The language in the additional terms and conditions
3964000	3966000	Clause of the Xbox 360
3966000	3968000	Product warranty, because everybody reads
3968000	3970000	That, um, barred the
3970000	3972000	Use of unauthorized peripherals
3972000	3974000	And the company, uh
3974000	3976000	Backed up its case by citing
3976000	3978000	Apple's, I guess, successful defense
3978000	3980000	Of its right to limit the use of
3980000	3982000	OS X to its own hardware
3982000	3984000	And the court rejected
3984000	3986000	Microsoft's motion to have
3986000	3988000	It dismissed, so it will
3988000	3990000	Apparently go to trial
3990000	3992000	Although, at this point
3992000	3994000	It's like, well
3994000	3996000	That's great and all, but
3996000	3998000	In the meantime, I'll just pop
3998000	4000000	In my USB memory stick
4000000	4002000	To, uh, save my games now
4002000	4004000	So that's gonna be kinda hard
4004000	4006000	To, uh, make the case
4006000	4008000	Now
4008000	4010000	Hmm
4010000	4012000	Well, I mean
4012000	4014000	Do you think there are, this is gonna be
4014000	4016000	One of those cases that gets dragged out
4016000	4018000	For years and years, or is it gonna get settled pretty
4018000	4020000	Quickly? What do you think?
4020000	4022000	Put on your legal expert
4022000	4024000	Hat
4024000	4026000	I think it probably gets
4026000	4028000	Probably gets settled, because
4028000	4030000	You know, really, yeah, it sucks that they
4030000	4032000	Made these devices, and
4032000	4034000	They got pulled from the market really
4034000	4036000	Quick. My thing is, though
4036000	4038000	Uh
4038000	4040000	It's gonna be difficult
4040000	4042000	Now to show any damages
4042000	4044000	Because
4044000	4046000	They weren't out that long, and
4046000	4048000	Now there are other options
4048000	4050000	Other than the memory units. In fact, they're not even
4050000	4052000	Making the memory units anymore
4052000	4054000	Um
4054000	4056000	So
4056000	4058000	I don't know, it's
4058000	4060000	It's hard, like, if they were
4060000	4062000	Yeah, they're not making them, because
4062000	4064000	Yeah, well they're not making them now, but if
4064000	4066000	If they were, like, to say, completely ignore
4066000	4068000	The time when they had just the memory units
4068000	4070000	Now that argument doesn't really hold
4070000	4072000	Um, but of course, you know
4072000	4074000	This took place before that update
4074000	4076000	But it almost makes you wonder if that update was
4076000	4078000	Partially in response to this
4078000	4080000	But, who knows
4080000	4082000	It just sucks for them, but
4082000	4084000	That's an interesting thought, because it did seem like that USB
4084000	4086000	Thing came out of nowhere, didn't it? I think they were
4086000	4088000	Worried that there was gonna be
4088000	4090000	Some sort of, uh, because
4090000	4092000	With this, you'll be able to
4092000	4094000	Access your files on your memory
4094000	4096000	Cards or whatever
4096000	4098000	And you might be able to cheat or something
4098000	4100000	Like, you know, edit your save games or something
4100000	4102000	Which, I can tell you right now, that wouldn't have
4102000	4104000	Stopped them, because it's very
4104000	4106000	Easy to do that if you have the right tools
4106000	4108000	Even easier now that they have USB support
4108000	4110000	It's like
4110000	4112000	A program in hex editing
4112000	4114000	Alright, we're gonna go ahead and move on
4114000	4116000	We got one more story for you guys
4116000	4118000	Before we get to the classic game of the week
4118000	4120000	And that story has to do with something
4120000	4122000	We sort of talked about last week
4122000	4124000	Don't know if you heard, but apparently
4124000	4126000	A leaked GameStop ad
4126000	4128000	Has revealed that a black Wii bundle
4128000	4130000	Is on its way
4130000	4132000	Who would have thought? I had never
4132000	4134000	Heard about this
4134000	4136000	Yes, this black Wii will contain a Wiimote
4136000	4138000	And MotionPlus, and Wii Sports, Wii Sports
4138000	4140000	Resorts, all for $200
4140000	4142000	However, it's supposed to be coming out
4142000	4144000	May 4th, which differs from an earlier
4144000	4146000	Report, but the interesting thing is that
4146000	4148000	I'm sorry, the
4148000	4150000	Ad is not supposed to go up until May 4th
4150000	4152000	But it got leaked, the debut of this system
4152000	4154000	I'm sorry, is May 9th
4154000	4156000	Which differs from the earlier report
4156000	4158000	Canada's supposed to get it on May 23rd
4158000	4160000	Which is interesting because May 23rd is the
4160000	4162000	Date that had originally been reported
4162000	4164000	And my source was not Canadian, thank you very much
4164000	4166000	So don't know what happened there
4166000	4168000	But could also be that
4168000	4170000	More is to come because Nintendo
4170000	4172000	Has yet to make any official announcement
4172000	4174000	You have to keep in mind, all of this is
4174000	4176000	Still rumor, it's just that now instead of
4176000	4178000	Some schmo on an internet radio show saying something
4178000	4180000	Now there's a picture to prove it
4180000	4182000	It's coming, whereas everybody outside of the
4182000	4184000	US is rolling their eyes and saying move on
4184000	4186000	With it, we already have the black Wii here
4186000	4188000	Well, it's news here
4188000	4190000	Anyhow, Nintendo is
4190000	4192000	Pissed
4192000	4194000	They commented actually on what's
4194000	4196000	Going on here, well no, they didn't comment
4196000	4198000	They made threats which caused
4198000	4200000	GameStop to comment
4200000	4202000	Here's an email
4202000	4204000	I love this because this whole email
4204000	4206000	Is about stop leaking stuff
4206000	4208000	And then the email gets leaked
4208000	4210000	That's my favorite, so here it is, here's the email
4210000	4212000	Let me read the email that went out to all the stores
4212000	4214000	As you know
4214000	4216000	There is a lot of rumor and speculation about various
4216000	4218000	New products and titles launching this year
4218000	4220000	One of these is the black Wii
4220000	4222000	Various blogs and internet sites
4222000	4224000	Are raising awareness about this product
4224000	4226000	GameStop stores and associates should not
4226000	4228000	Proliferate these rumors
4228000	4230000	Today you received pop, I guess that's what
4230000	4232000	POP, what is that?
4232000	4234000	Point of purchase advertising
4234000	4236000	Whatever
4236000	4238000	For your windows regarding the black Wii
4238000	4240000	Somehow a picture of this appeared on the internet
4240000	4242000	Somebody snapped it with her camera phone
4242000	4244000	It's not that hard to figure out
4244000	4246000	It may seem cool to be in the know
4246000	4248000	And feel compelled to share something like this
4248000	4250000	Nothing can be further from the truth
4250000	4252000	All activity like this does is hurt our reputation
4252000	4254000	With publishers and manufacturers
4254000	4256000	And potentially hurts our company
4256000	4258000	Until Nintendo decides to announce their product
4258000	4260000	There was capitalized, that's why I shouted it
4260000	4262000	There should be no discussion of it with customers
4262000	4264000	Period
4264000	4266000	If they ask, it's not appropriate to comment on
4266000	4268000	Speculation and rumor should be the answer
4268000	4270000	That's dumb
4270000	4272000	So in other words you should just confirm it
4272000	4274000	Just say I don't know
4274000	4276000	Here's an excuse that people will believe
4276000	4278000	I work at a game store, I don't know
4278000	4280000	Don't believe that
4280000	4282000	Anyway, the POP should be secured
4282000	4284000	In the back room and left there until further notice
4284000	4286000	Any violation of these will be treated
4286000	4288000	With the most aggressive consequences
4288000	4290000	I believe strongly in the field organization
4290000	4292000	But I am as disappointed as I have been
4292000	4294000	In my tenure here and how we are handling this
4294000	4296000	I am trusting that your professionalism
4296000	4298000	Will result in no further issues
4298000	4300000	I got two words for you, BITCH
4300000	4302000	PLEASE
4302000	4304000	Well here's the funny thing about it
4304000	4306000	If you didn't want news
4306000	4308000	On this to get out until May 4th
4308000	4310000	Then maybe you should have sent out the materials
4310000	4312000	I don't know, May 2nd?
4312000	4314000	I mean come on, if you're gonna pay these guys
4314000	4316000	Next to nothing
4316000	4318000	And let's face it, these employees at GameStop
4318000	4320000	Don't make enough money to shut up
4320000	4322000	Right?
4322000	4324000	I mean
4324000	4326000	You shouldn't be telling the whole world
4326000	4328000	That the Black Week is coming out if you don't want people to say
4328000	4330000	And I love how they put, oh it hurts
4330000	4332000	Our relationship with Nintendo
4332000	4334000	Yeah I'm sure Nintendo's gonna go
4334000	4336000	Oh we're not gonna ship product to our largest
4336000	4338000	Partner
4338000	4340000	Actually Loki, they did make that threat
4340000	4342000	Apparently that is the rumor going around
4342000	4344000	Nintendo did make the threat to pull all of its
4344000	4346000	Products from GameStop stories
4346000	4348000	You know what I have to say to Nintendo over that?
4348000	4350000	BITCH PLEASE
4350000	4352000	It would never happen
4352000	4354000	Never happen
4354000	4356000	What other game stores are there?
4356000	4358000	I mean
4358000	4360000	I mean
4360000	4362000	You're gonna just rely on Walmart
4362000	4364000	And Target and all that for your sales
4364000	4366000	I mean come on
4366000	4368000	That is an empty threat
4368000	4370000	If I've ever heard one
4370000	4372000	Maybe they'll send us a decent quantity of product then
4372000	4374000	Cause we service all the independent guys
4374000	4376000	And they seem to fuck us over all the time
4376000	4378000	I would love to see
4378000	4380000	The big gorilla in the corner
4380000	4382000	GameStop get fucked over once
4382000	4384000	Or twice
4384000	4386000	Yeah you're kinda sitting there going
4386000	4388000	Leak more, leak more, hee hee hee
4388000	4390000	It's not gonna do anything
4390000	4392000	GameStops leak information all the time
4392000	4394000	Not only do you leak information all the time
4394000	4396000	I'm sure that they're the source
4396000	4398000	Of a lot of the leaked games
4398000	4400000	That appear on the internet as well
4400000	4402000	So
4402000	4404000	Oh well
4404000	4406000	Things get leaked
4406000	4408000	Trust no one
4408000	4410000	God look at the music industry
4410000	4412000	I mean stuff
4412000	4414000	I mean CDs get leaked
4414000	4416000	Weeks before their release date on the internet
4416000	4418000	And you know what they say about
4418000	4420000	When something hits the internet, it's done
4420000	4422000	Everybody's got it now
4422000	4424000	Once it's been put on the internet
4424000	4426000	It is not coming off
4426000	4428000	Period
4428000	4430000	Anyhow
4430000	4432000	So yeah the black Wii is coming, big surprise
4432000	4434000	Five minutes of fame and an eternity on the internet
4434000	4436000	Well here's the thing, the only reason why
4436000	4438000	They probably didn't want it leaked
4438000	4440000	For the stupid reason anyways is
4440000	4442000	That's gonna hurt the sales of the Wii right now
4442000	4444000	Because people are like why the fuck am I gonna
4444000	4446000	Pay $1.99 for the Wii
4446000	4448000	When I can get the Wii with Wii Sports Resort
4448000	4450000	You know for the same price
4450000	4452000	But, but, but, but, but retailers
4452000	4454000	Are already doing that
4454000	4456000	We had a story a couple weeks ago about Walmart
4456000	4458000	Was already selling this as a bundle and I believe
4458000	4460000	Yeah they already have it
4460000	4462000	What's Nintendo's problem?
4462000	4464000	Bitch please
4464000	4466000	I don't know
4466000	4468000	All I can say is
4468000	4470000	That my Wii's been gathering dust for
4470000	4472000	Five months
4472000	4474000	I would love to see that meeting
4474000	4476000	Where somebody at GameStop says that to Reggie
4476000	4478000	Fils-Aime's face, bitch please
4478000	4480000	I still wanna borrow your Wii Fit
4480000	4482000	Maybe I wanna use it
4482000	4484000	If you're not using it
4484000	4486000	Yeah sure
4486000	4488000	Okay thank you
4488000	4490000	Anyhow let's move on
4490000	4492000	Spyro in chat says wait it's already here
4492000	4494000	Yeah that's my other thing is that like
4494000	4496000	In all the rest of the world
4496000	4498000	Like the UK and what doesn't even Canada
4498000	4500000	Have the Black Wii at this no no
4500000	4502000	Cause it's supposed to come out May 23rd
4502000	4504000	Pretty much everywhere but the US and Canada
4504000	4506000	Has already had the Black Wii
4506000	4508000	They'll announce it like tomorrow okay
4508000	4510000	I mean they're gonna make the announcement soon
4510000	4512000	It's retarded that they're not
4512000	4514000	Maybe on the 4th I don't know why they wait till Tuesday
4514000	4516000	But it's just gonna be an announcement
4516000	4518000	And whoopty shit
4518000	4520000	Okay seriously
4520000	4522000	Really a color change that's really
4522000	4524000	Gonna get people to buy the Wii
4524000	4526000	That didn't before I would buy it
4526000	4528000	But if only it were black
4528000	4530000	Going to comments from our chat room
4530000	4532000	Chat.orangelaungeradio.com
4532000	4534000	ActDeaf says to Nintendo, you mad?
4534000	4536000	Rama says
4536000	4538000	Is that sky getting sassy?
4538000	4540000	Mhmm
4540000	4542000	Frisbee says Nintendo
4542000	4544000	And Tigerclaw says
4544000	4546000	A Black Wii would be nice but it's not gonna
4546000	4548000	Hide all the dust it will collect turning it into a
4548000	4550000	White Wii ha should be more of like a
4550000	4552000	Grayish Wii but I get your point that's true
4552000	4554000	It's gonna be like the PS3's
4554000	4556000	Little dust magnets
4556000	4558000	Good times good times
4558000	4560000	Hey it's that part of the show where we're going
4560000	4562000	To speaking of dusty things we're gonna jump
4562000	4564000	Into Dark Sakura's vault
4564000	4566000	And pull out a video game
4566000	4568000	It's a classic
4568000	4570000	It's time to bring a game up from the
4570000	4572000	Vault of History and deem it as a
4572000	4574000	True classic that you kids need
4574000	4576000	To respect and adore and play some of
4576000	4578000	This week it's Dark Sakura's classic
4578000	4580000	Game of the week
4580000	4582000	Dark Sakura what game did you pick for us this week?
4582000	4584000	I picked a sequel
4584000	4586000	Rob
4586000	4588000	I picked Dodonpachi
4588000	4590000	Dodonpachi can't say I've
4590000	4592000	Heard of this game let's check it out what's Dodonpachi
4592000	4594000	You haven't heard of Dodonpachi?
4594000	4596000	I don't think so
4596000	4598000	We're like one of the classic cave shooters
4598000	4600000	As in the company that gave us
4600000	4602000	Es-ba-ba-ba-ba-luga whale
4602000	4604000	I'm sorry Es-ba-galuda
4604000	4606000	But I didn't play all of their games
4606000	4608000	Was this released in the US?
4608000	4610000	What system was this on?
4610000	4612000	I played Dodonpachi in the arcade
4612000	4614000	It was
4614000	4616000	Published by Atlas
4616000	4618000	But yeah
4618000	4620000	For systems it came out on
4620000	4622000	Let's see
4622000	4624000	I'm trying to remember
4624000	4626000	I think there was
4626000	4628000	Wasn't there
4628000	4630000	I don't remember if it was arcade only
4630000	4632000	It couldn't have been arcade only
4632000	4634000	Because I know that this
4634000	4636000	And I think that
4636000	4638000	Dodonpachi
4638000	4640000	Came out in the arcade
4640000	4642000	Only
4642000	4644000	Because I really don't remember
4644000	4646000	Playing this at home I've just had
4646000	4648000	Main ROMs
4648000	4650000	It was also on the Saturn
4650000	4652000	And the original Playstation
4652000	4654000	Now that I think about it
4654000	4656000	I think it's the Saturn version
4656000	4658000	I've never heard the easy web
4658000	4660000	I don't know what that is
4660000	4662000	Anyway
4662000	4664000	The original Dodonpachi
4664000	4666000	Was sort of like an 8 year training mission
4666000	4668000	Where you shoot all your friends to death
4668000	4670000	And then
4670000	4672000	There's another twist in this one
4672000	4674000	But I'm not going to really get much into it
4674000	4676000	But you have different fighters
4676000	4678000	You have your type A
4678000	4680000	Which is a narrow stream of shots
4680000	4682000	You have B
4682000	4684000	Which is a helicopter that has
4684000	4686000	Guns forward and side guns
4686000	4688000	And then type C
4688000	4690000	You've got different guns
4690000	4692000	Lasers, bombs, all kinds of different stuff
4692000	4694000	Different power ups
4694000	4696000	You get shot mode and laser mode
4696000	4698000	Different collectible items where you can get
4698000	4700000	Power to increase your
4700000	4702000	Guns and lasers
4702000	4704000	Bombs where you get more bombs
4704000	4706000	MP
4706000	4708000	Appears when you've lost all your lives
4708000	4710000	So when you continue you can pick that up
4710000	4712000	And you start back at full strength
4712000	4714000	Which is also in Espegaluda
4714000	4716000	And in
4716000	4718000	Another game
4718000	4720000	That's supposed to be even harder
4720000	4722000	Than that
4722000	4724000	I set a link aside
4724000	4726000	To get the name of it
4726000	4728000	You also
4728000	4730000	Now this is something else that
4730000	4732000	Totally incorporated into
4732000	4734000	Espegaluda
4734000	4736000	Later on is that you can get
4736000	4738000	Stars
4738000	4740000	For
4740000	4742000	Killing
4742000	4744000	A boss
4744000	4746000	An end boss
4746000	4748000	And their bullets are converted into stars
4748000	4750000	And you get 100 points
4750000	4752000	And then you get a giant star when you get 10,000 points
4752000	4754000	For a multi-part boss
4754000	4756000	And then
4756000	4758000	A pentagon
4758000	4760000	That gives you 300 points
4760000	4762000	But you only find them on the ground
4762000	4764000	And by the way the other game
4764000	4766000	That I am thinking of
4766000	4768000	Is
4768000	4770000	Mushihime Sama
4770000	4772000	Which is
4772000	4774000	Like bullet hell
4774000	4776000	Just watch the last boss
4776000	4778000	For that if you want your brain to explode
4778000	4780000	It's really freaking difficult
4780000	4782000	But I like my brain
4782000	4784000	You've also got a maximum
4784000	4786000	Mode in this
4786000	4788000	Where if you
4788000	4790000	Trigger a bomb when all of your bomb slots
4790000	4792000	Are full and then your
4792000	4794000	Score increases
4794000	4796000	By 220 points
4796000	4798000	Per 1 60th of a second
4798000	4800000	Yeah
4800000	4802000	And so you start off with a 2 multiplier
4802000	4804000	And you increase by 1 for every successive
4804000	4806000	Bomb collected in maximum mode
4806000	4808000	So it's pretty crazy
4808000	4810000	And you also have a get point system
4810000	4812000	Where you have a combo gauge
4812000	4814000	And you get
4814000	4816000	Increased number of points
4816000	4818000	From enemies larger hit counts
4818000	4820000	It's pretty complex
4820000	4822000	It's got other stuff so you've got different
4822000	4824000	Areas in the game
4824000	4826000	But area 7
4826000	4828000	You can only get to
4828000	4830000	By entering the second loop
4830000	4832000	Which is done by
4832000	4834000	Completing the first 6 areas on
4834000	4836000	1 credit
4836000	4838000	And doing any of these
4838000	4840000	Following requirements where you lose
4840000	4842000	2 lives
4842000	4844000	Or depending on which one you lose
4844000	4846000	For type A you have to have a maximum
4846000	4848000	Hit count of 270 hits
4848000	4850000	Type B 300 and type C 330
4850000	4852000	Or score at least 50 million points
4852000	4854000	At the end of area 6
4854000	4856000	Or collect all 13 B's
4856000	4858000	For 4 of the 6 areas
4858000	4860000	And the second loop has
4860000	4862000	The same areas
4862000	4864000	Same bosses
4864000	4866000	But you have many many many more bullets
4866000	4868000	And giant mechanical B's
4868000	4870000	Different
4870000	4872000	And then you get the actual
4872000	4874000	Real boss of the game
4874000	4876000	You've got different bonuses
4876000	4878000	So you get stuff for
4878000	4880000	Pentagon's getting the stars
4880000	4882000	Boss hits
4882000	4884000	No miss
4884000	4886000	In the second loop you get
4886000	4888000	10 million points for each
4888000	4890000	Reserve fighter
4890000	4892000	So you've got different endings too
4892000	4894000	If you don't get the
4894000	4896000	Second loop access
4896000	4898000	You're congratulated by the DonPachi Corps
4898000	4900000	For being brave
4900000	4902000	If you get everything
4902000	4904000	The mechanized aliens
4904000	4906000	Are your own comrades
4906000	4908000	Although
4908000	4910000	The
4910000	4912000	International release says it's a lost fleet
4912000	4914000	But
4914000	4916000	They're actually trying to stop
4916000	4918000	You
4918000	4920000	So
4920000	4922000	Once everything is done
4922000	4924000	They're all ordered
4924000	4926000	To kill you
4926000	4928000	And that's when you start the second loop
4928000	4930000	So going through it again
4930000	4932000	The whole point of DonPachi
4932000	4934000	Is to annihilate all the human
4934000	4936000	Beings in the world
4936000	4938000	Awesome
4938000	4940000	Pretty pretty crazy huh?
4940000	4942000	Yeah I'm looking at the screens of this
4942000	4944000	It's definitely bullet hell
4944000	4946000	God there's so many of these games
4946000	4948000	That's not even bad Rob
4948000	4950000	That is not even bad
4950000	4952000	It just goes to show I suck at these games
4952000	4954000	Because I would fail at this so miserably
4954000	4956000	I've been bouncing from YouTube to YouTube
4956000	4958000	This is like stage 2-3 I think
4958000	4960000	And yeah I would not beat this
4960000	4962000	Rob you need to find
4962000	4964000	The final boss
4964000	4966000	I believe SSJ100Matt actually linked that
4966000	4968000	In our chat room
4968000	4970000	It's very resourceful
4970000	4972000	Here it is the hardest video game boss ever
4972000	4974000	Let me fast forward a little bit here
4974000	4976000	This is nuts you don't need to fast forward all that much
4976000	4978000	It starts off hard
4978000	4980000	Isn't that gorgeous?
4980000	4982000	This is ridiculous
4982000	4984000	This is just retarded stupid
4984000	4986000	There's a video up of a person
4986000	4988000	No missing on it not getting hit
4990000	4992000	And keep in mind
4992000	4994000	The final boss in Escaluda on iPhone
4994000	4996000	Releases
4996000	4998000	Not quite as many bullets
4998000	5000000	The way these games work you can only get hit
5000000	5002000	In that little glowing spot right there
5002000	5004000	That's it
5006000	5008000	That's bullet hell
5008000	5010000	Ridiculous
5010000	5012000	And I like that it talks to you the whole time
5012000	5014000	Just like it does in Escaluda
5014000	5016000	Sorry
5016000	5018000	But yeah
5018000	5020000	Cave is evil
5020000	5022000	For throwing bullets up our noses
5022000	5024000	So yeah there was
5024000	5026000	A special version
5026000	5028000	The campaign version or DDP Blue Rom
5028000	5030000	That has
5030000	5032000	A very limited print
5032000	5034000	Of the game that was given to winners
5034000	5036000	At a Dodonpachi contest
5036000	5038000	That Cave had
5038000	5040000	It has
5040000	5042000	The same game it's harder and has a hyper mode
5042000	5044000	In it which
5044000	5046000	Actually shows up later in Dodonpachi
5046000	5048000	Dialjo
5048000	5050000	A blue title screen
5050000	5052000	Very very hard to get
5052000	5054000	And actually
5054000	5056000	One
5056000	5058000	There's actually two
5058000	5060000	That have confirmed to exist
5060000	5062000	That one of them belongs to
5062000	5064000	The
5064000	5066000	Current world holder for Dodonpachi
5066000	5068000	So
5068000	5070000	But yeah
5070000	5072000	There were of course
5072000	5074000	The other versions too
5074000	5076000	Like the Saturn and
5076000	5078000	PlayStation
5078000	5080000	I was trying to remember if it was Dodonpachi or Dodonpachi
5080000	5082000	And that game
5082000	5084000	I've only ever really played it in the arcade
5084000	5086000	Although I think I have it on Saturn
5086000	5088000	In one of my collections somewhere
5088000	5090000	But yeah, pretty crazy
5090000	5092000	And for the record
5092000	5094000	You want to play 2D games on the Saturn
5094000	5096000	They look better
5096000	5098000	Alright, there it is your classic video game of the week
5098000	5100000	Dodonpachi
5100000	5102000	Going to comments from our chat room
5102000	5104000	Shao Ran says
5104000	5106000	Bullet hell is all about patterns
5106000	5108000	Beauty, thought, and bullet hell
5108000	5110000	As there are no things superior to beauty and thought
5110000	5112000	Kevin DDR says
5112000	5114000	Sky 2-3 means
5114000	5116000	It's the second loop
5116000	5118000	You have to beat the game with certain conditions to even get to that
5118000	5120000	Well, that ain't happening
5120000	5122000	I'll tell you that
5122000	5124000	And then Shao Ran follows up and says
5124000	5126000	Yeah, once you get grazing down, bullet hell games aren't that hard
5126000	5128000	It's just about memorization
5128000	5130000	Just like any other old Japanese game
5130000	5132000	Frisbee says
5132000	5134000	Bullet hell is almost like a maze game
5134000	5136000	I guess I can see that
5136000	5138000	Just interesting
5138000	5140000	Alright, I'm just not very good at those games
5140000	5142000	Like, the last bullet hell game I played
5142000	5144000	Was the You Will Die
5144000	5146000	Which was by one of the other all games hosts
5146000	5148000	Making his own game on XNA
5148000	5150000	And I suck at it
5150000	5152000	Alright
5152000	5154000	Let's go do our break
5154000	5156000	We're going to take a quick break, we'll be right back
5156000	5158000	There's plenty more to come tonight
5158000	5160000	Listless, speaking of friends on all games
5160000	5162000	One of our podcasting buddies is going to join us
5162000	5164000	For Listless later
5164000	5166000	There was huge news out of Bungie this week
5166000	5168000	We're going to talk about that in the next segment
5168000	5170000	Final Fantasy 5 and Final Fantasy 6 remakes
5170000	5172000	Possibly, maybe
5172000	5174000	We'll see after a quick break
5174000	5176000	So stay tuned, don't go anywhere
5176000	5178000	We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio
5184000	5186000	Hello everybody and welcome back to another episode
5186000	5188000	Of Orange Lounge Radio
5188000	5190000	It's part B of our show
5190000	5192000	Already in progress
5192000	5194000	On May 2nd of 2010
5194000	5196000	We have plenty more gaming news
5196000	5198000	To get to this hour
5198000	5200000	And Listless tonight
5200000	5202000	And I'll tell you the topic right now
5202000	5204000	What we're going to be doing tonight
5204000	5206000	What Capcom versus series should they do next
5206000	5208000	Or maybe I should actually say
5208000	5210000	Versus Capcom would be correct
5210000	5212000	Because you know, you've had Tatsunoko versus Capcom
5212000	5214000	Marvel versus Capcom
5214000	5216000	What should they do next
5216000	5218000	We're going to find out with the definitive list
5218000	5220000	In a few more minutes here at Orange Lounge Radio
5220000	5222000	But first we have some rapid quick
5222000	5224000	News, there's so much to talk about this week
5224000	5226000	We don't have time to talk about everything
5226000	5228000	But we can at least give some shout outs
5228000	5230000	To some other gaming news highlights this week
5230000	5232000	And as somebody in chat points out
5232000	5234000	I should say this real quick
5234000	5236000	ActDeaf says it's episode live 365
5236000	5238000	Because this is episode 365 of our show
5238000	5240000	Do not speak that name ever again
5240000	5242000	Just kidding
5242000	5244000	Remember we went to the live 365 awards
5244000	5246000	Good times, good times
5246000	5248000	We went twice
5248000	5250000	What? Hey what?
5250000	5252000	That's what I did during the live 365 awards
5252000	5254000	Oh yeah, when they, oh god
5254000	5256000	How could I forget when they forgot our name
5256000	5258000	When they were going over, yeah we got nominated
5258000	5260000	One year for live 365 station
5260000	5262000	Of the year, like that's a pretty big honor
5262000	5264000	Because there was what, like 11,000 stations on live 365
5264000	5266000	We were one of the five nominated
5266000	5268000	For station of the year, and when what's-her-name
5268000	5270000	Betty whatever was reading the
5270000	5272000	Nominees, she forgot OLR
5272000	5274000	And you just hear, and god
5274000	5276000	I wish I could find that recording, I think it's long
5276000	5278000	Gone in the recycle bin or whatever
5278000	5280000	But somebody actually had a recording
5280000	5282000	Because they played the award show live
5282000	5284000	And a bunch of our listeners were listening
5284000	5286000	And you could hear Loki in the background
5286000	5288000	She goes, we have all, or she goes
5288000	5290000	And the nominees are
5290000	5292000	Rockland, da da da, and whatever stations
5292000	5294000	And she goes, and the winner is, and you hear in the background
5294000	5296000	Hey!
5296000	5298000	No, it was funny, it was
5298000	5300000	Most unlikely to be on radio or something
5300000	5302000	Like that, and they had like an 80's station
5302000	5304000	Because you don't ever hear 80's
5304000	5306000	Stations on the radio
5306000	5308000	Ever. That's where we lost to the station that plays
5308000	5310000	Nothing but porn music all day long
5310000	5312000	Got nominated three
5312000	5314000	Years in a row for those fuckers, never won
5314000	5316000	One, oh well, thanks for trying
5316000	5318000	I got speakers. That's right, you won some type of like
5318000	5320000	Playing bingo. Bingo thing or something stupid
5320000	5322000	Alright, so yeah
5322000	5324000	That was good times, so
5324000	5326000	I really wish I had a recording of that
5326000	5328000	With Loki in the background, hey!
5328000	5330000	And then she goes, oh, oh yeah, yeah, and on orange
5330000	5332000	Orange, orange, orange, and we just gave each other
5332000	5334000	That look of, well, we didn't win
5334000	5336000	I'm outta here
5336000	5338000	Drove all this way for this
5338000	5340000	And then they drove up their fees
5340000	5342000	By like 300% and we
5342000	5344000	Got the fuck out, and now we're here at All Games
5344000	5346000	You know what, it worked out for the better, because coming over to
5346000	5348000	All Games, I think got us new listeners
5348000	5350000	Because, you know, we had
5350000	5352000	Kind of a cultish audience
5352000	5354000	And Scott Rubin and Bobby Blackwolf
5354000	5356000	And all the people at All Games had a bit of a cultish
5356000	5358000	Audience, so when we married these
5358000	5360000	Cults together, it was a good thing
5360000	5362000	It was a super cult
5362000	5364000	Yes, it was a super cult, uber cult
5364000	5366000	So thanks to all you little cultists
5366000	5368000	For sticking with us
5368000	5370000	Over the years, alright, back to some gaming news
5370000	5372000	Loki
5372000	5374000	Yes, so real quick, if you wanna be
5374000	5376000	Iron Man on Playstation
5376000	5378000	Home, it'll be a lot easier than having to
5378000	5380000	Steal a suit from Stark Enterprises
5380000	5382000	Yes, you can actually play, they have a little
5382000	5384000	Game where you can fly around
5384000	5386000	As Iron Man
5386000	5388000	And apparently it
5388000	5390000	Debuted earlier last week
5390000	5392000	On Thursday
5394000	5396000	Apparently
5396000	5398000	It was part of the Out
5398000	5400000	I'm surprised that they actually have
5400000	5402000	A space, but
5402000	5404000	Audi, I guess, has a space there
5404000	5406000	And they're teaming up with Paramount for that
5406000	5408000	No actual Iron Man themed space
5408000	5410000	I mean, it sort of is, but it's part of
5410000	5412000	Audi's
5414000	5416000	And then I guess, oh
5416000	5418000	That's funny
5418000	5420000	Unfortunately though, it is exclusive to the
5420000	5422000	European Playstation Network, so
5422000	5424000	That sucks for most of
5424000	5426000	Our listeners
5426000	5428000	This is kind of cool
5428000	5430000	Someone made a Flash game
5430000	5432000	That kind of crosses a bunch of
5432000	5434000	Different 8-bit game
5434000	5436000	Heroes with Super Mario Brothers
5436000	5438000	And it's called Super Mario Crossover
5438000	5440000	And it features such
5440000	5442000	Playable characters as, of course you can play as Mario
5442000	5444000	Why would you want to
5444000	5446000	Link, Mega Man, Samus,
5446000	5448000	Simon Belmont, and Bill from
5448000	5450000	Contra
5450000	5452000	And that is awesome
5452000	5454000	And I'll be playing that later instead of the
5454000	5456000	Unicorn game
5456000	5458000	And then finally, APB
5458000	5460000	Has been slated to be coming out now
5460000	5462000	On June 29th
5462000	5464000	And they also kind of talked a little bit about
5464000	5466000	How their pricing structure is going to go
5466000	5468000	As well, it's really cool
5468000	5470000	I like the way that they're doing it, I mean
5470000	5472000	I think it's going to be pretty sweet
5472000	5474000	Instead of paying a monthly fee
5474000	5476000	As you would with most MMOs, you pay for time
5476000	5478000	So for example, when you buy the game
5478000	5480000	You get 50 hours
5480000	5482000	And how you use that
5482000	5484000	Is up to you, if you play a lot
5484000	5486000	Great, if you don't play a lot
5486000	5488000	No big deal
5488000	5490000	And once those are up, you have the option to purchase
5490000	5492000	20 more hours for $7
5492000	5494000	Or you can do 30 days of unlimited access
5494000	5496000	For $10, or
5496000	5498000	90 days, or 180 day passes
5498000	5500000	As well, and they haven't given the prices on those
5500000	5502000	In addition to extra playtime
5502000	5504000	Oh, in addition, extra playtime
5504000	5506000	Can be earned through different accomplishments
5506000	5508000	In the game
5508000	5510000	So that's pretty awesome, and I have to say
5510000	5512000	You know, I don't really hop on the
5512000	5514000	MMO bandwagon
5514000	5516000	Because I don't have time to play games, but
5516000	5518000	If it's as a pain as I go
5518000	5520000	I'm interested
5520000	5522000	Definitely, especially since the game looks like
5522000	5524000	Grand Theft Auto, so
5524000	5526000	I'm all over that, and it's
5526000	5528000	And it's real time worlds, man
5528000	5530000	It's a crackdown, and I really am sad that they didn't
5530000	5532000	Do the second crackdown
5532000	5534000	Thank god, WoW doesn't charge by the hour
5534000	5536000	I'd be in debt
5536000	5538000	Well, I mean, they do have that option
5538000	5540000	Though, where you can buy unlimited access
5540000	5542000	For 30 days for $10
5542000	5544000	Which is still cheaper than WoW
5544000	5546000	So, it's not bad
5546000	5548000	Alright, well, here's a game that I think
5548000	5550000	Loki might be interested in, I think Dark Soccer
5550000	5552000	I don't know why, this seems like a Dark Soccer kind of game, too
5552000	5554000	THQ and Syfy
5554000	5556000	The TV network are getting together to make
5556000	5558000	A new game
5558000	5560000	Sadly, it's not a Caprica game, but what it is
5560000	5562000	It's a Ghost Hunters Academy game
5562000	5564000	Here's the problem I have with that
5564000	5566000	It's Ghost Hunters Academy, and they've done so many spinoffs
5566000	5568000	Of the Ghost Hunters show
5568000	5570000	It's retarded now
5570000	5572000	And they've become, they've sold out
5572000	5574000	Okay, they've sold out
5574000	5576000	And then jumped the shark
5576000	5578000	Bought a shark to jump over, I guess
5578000	5580000	Well, if you want to jump the shark with them
5580000	5582000	Ghost Hunters Academy is coming out for the iPhone and iPad, of course
5582000	5584000	And the DS
5584000	5586000	Is the game you get to try out
5586000	5588000	To be on the team
5588000	5590000	If you want to be a ghost hunter
5590000	5592000	Who wants to be a ghost hunter?
5592000	5594000	That's what the game's about
5594000	5596000	Just saying
5596000	5598000	By the way, no details about actual gameplay
5598000	5600000	Hopefully it plays like Ghostbusters
5600000	5602000	The old school game that was on
5602000	5604000	Commodore and NES
5604000	5606000	Don't cross the streams, Marshmallow Man, etc
5606000	5608000	Also, apparently
5608000	5610000	There's stuff afoot in the Mega Man universe
5610000	5612000	No surprise there
5612000	5614000	Mega Man's been having a little bit of a renaissance
5614000	5616000	Thanks to Mega Man 9 and Mega Man 10
5616000	5618000	Apparently there is a Mega Man universe
5618000	5620000	We talked about this before
5620000	5622000	But now we might know what this is actually connected to
5622000	5624000	Apparently
5624000	5626000	There was a little tease dropped in another podcast
5626000	5628000	Called Bit Transmission
5628000	5630000	And Seth Killen
5630000	5632000	Was the guest from Capcom
5632000	5634000	He said that Mega Man still has some surprises in store
5634000	5636000	For everybody
5636000	5638000	Quote, it's good, I don't want to say nobody has seen it coming
5638000	5640000	Somebody may have seen it coming
5640000	5642000	But it excited me and when I heard about the project
5642000	5644000	I was like, holy crap, that's rad
5644000	5646000	I actually haven't seen anything that's going on with the project right now
5646000	5648000	But the idea was exciting
5648000	5650000	This is still kicking around as a concept
5650000	5652000	But there are exciting ideas in the Mega Man space
5652000	5654000	It's a six player co-op
5654000	5656000	Xbox Live
5656000	5658000	2D game
5658000	5660000	And this week they're gonna be like
5660000	5662000	Shit, someone beat us to it
5662000	5664000	Damn it
5664000	5666000	MU Konami
5666000	5668000	We all know it would be Konami copying them
5668000	5670000	Oh, I went there
5670000	5672000	Hey look, no seriously, think about it
5672000	5674000	I don't want to say nobody has seen it coming
5674000	5676000	So here's my thought
5676000	5678000	And especially if the game is called Mega Man Universe
5678000	5680000	Is this finally
5680000	5682000	That game
5682000	5684000	Oh yes, that Mega Man game
5684000	5686000	With all
5686000	5688000	Of the robot bosses in it
5688000	5690000	At once
5690000	5692000	That'd be awesome
5692000	5694000	That would be so fucking awesome
5694000	5698000	That's more awesome than I think I can handle
5698000	5700000	I might just explode
5700000	5702000	We'll see
5702000	5704000	Meanwhile, this is also awesome and I didn't realize that
5704000	5706000	By the way, Dark Tetsuya
5706000	5708000	Oh, thanks to the lag
5708000	5710000	I just beat him to it
5710000	5712000	But he just said in chat
5712000	5714000	I'm calling it now, Mega Man Battle Royale
5714000	5716000	With all the bosses
5716000	5718000	I called it 30 seconds ago
5718000	5720000	Anyway, speaking of games
5720000	5722000	That sound really awesome
5722000	5724000	I'm going to pass out from how awesome it is
5724000	5726000	ModNation Racers is on its way out
5726000	5728000	I never did play the beta, so I don't know if it's actually that good
5728000	5730000	I got in the beta and never played it
5730000	5732000	You dumbass
5732000	5734000	I would have played it, I didn't get in the beta
5734000	5736000	I didn't try hard enough
5736000	5738000	I didn't realize the beta was coming out so soon
5738000	5740000	It's coming out at the end of May
5740000	5742000	There was a commercial for it on TV the other day
5742000	5744000	I'm seeing more and more Playstation commercials on TV
5744000	5746000	What's up with that?
5746000	5748000	Of course I've been watching more South Park
5748000	5750000	Maybe it's related, I don't know
5750000	5752000	Anyhow, in ModNation Racers
5752000	5754000	You will be able to play as Sackboy
5754000	5756000	Will be one of the racers in ModNation Racers
5756000	5758000	And if this surprises you
5758000	5760000	I don't know what rock you've been living under
5760000	5762000	Because this series has been getting all of these
5762000	5764000	Transplants from other Sony franchises
5764000	5766000	So this is kind of a duh
5766000	5768000	We don't know if it's part of a pre-order bonus or what
5768000	5770000	But probably it is
5770000	5772000	So there you go, there's a little teaser out there featuring Sackboy
5772000	5774000	And all that fun stuff
5774000	5776000	Dark Soccer, what you got for us?
5776000	5778000	I have some stuff, Rob
5778000	5780000	Which is as cool as every freaking Mega Man boss at once
5780000	5782000	Sims 3
5782000	5784000	Is coming to Playstation 3, Xbox 360
5784000	5786000	Wii, and DS this fall
5790000	5792000	EA is working on console versions
5792000	5794000	And should have different features
5794000	5796000	Like karma power
5796000	5798000	Depending on whether you can get lucky
5798000	5800000	Or have Epic fail
5800000	5802000	Yeah
5802000	5804000	Which actually still reminds me that I need to completely
5804000	5806000	Uninstall all my Sims 3 stuff
5806000	5808000	What?
5808000	5810000	I just spilled water all over myself
5810000	5812000	You're a big boy, Rob
5812000	5814000	I need a sippy cup
5814000	5816000	I could go get you one
5816000	5818000	He's getting wet over that news
5818000	5820000	Literally, I just got wet over the Mega Man news
5820000	5822000	I'll be right back, I need a towel
5822000	5824000	Okay
5824000	5826000	So also though, coming up for Rock Band
5826000	5828000	We have new download content
5828000	5830000	We have No Doubt Tragic Kingdom
5830000	5832000	To download
5832000	5834000	Which are
5834000	5836000	Basically all
5836000	5838000	We have the songs on there
5838000	5840000	Including different people
5840000	5842000	And ended on this
5842000	5844000	Happy now see you then 16
5844000	5846000	The climb tragic kingdom world go round
5846000	5848000	And you can do it
5848000	5850000	And then individual songs is
5850000	5852000	Orient the according to you and picture me broken
5852000	5854000	Dearest I'm so sorry
5854000	5856000	And then
5856000	5858000	We also have our UK
5858000	5860000	Download games
5860000	5862000	Just to mention what's coming out
5862000	5864000	We have Hamster Ball
5864000	5866000	For Playstation 3
5866000	5868000	Yeah, Hamster Ball
5868000	5870000	Which looks kind of Monkey Ball
5870000	5872000	Like to me
5872000	5874000	And then
5874000	5876000	Alpha Bounce
5876000	5878000	For DSiWare
5878000	5880000	500 points
5880000	5882000	Which just looks like a glorified
5882000	5884000	Arcanoid to me
5884000	5886000	The Will of Dr. Frankenstein
5886000	5888000	For WiiWare
5888000	5890000	And
5890000	5892000	It looks very Nintendo 64-ish
5892000	5894000	And
5894000	5896000	It's actually a cut down version
5896000	5898000	Of the island of Dr. Frankenstein
5898000	5900000	And then
5900000	5902000	We've got a few others
5902000	5904000	There's Earthworm Jim for DSiWare
5904000	5906000	500 points
5906000	5908000	Um, which you know
5908000	5910000	Freaking Earthworm Jim, so hey
5910000	5912000	I loved Earthworm Jim, it was cute
5912000	5914000	I loved how the titles, credits would burp
5914000	5916000	Sound like me earlier in the show tonight
5916000	5918000	We have Lead and Gold Gangs of the Wild
5918000	5920000	West, which is for Playstation Network
5920000	5922000	And Steam
5922000	5924000	That would do it
5924000	5926000	Alright, let's get into some Twitter topics
5928000	5930000	Every week we solicit your tweets
5930000	5932000	At Twitter.com slash OLR
5932000	5934000	And we like to pick some of our favorite tweets
5934000	5936000	And read them here on the show
5936000	5938000	So let's get into the tweets
5938000	5940000	I gotta admit, they're not always on topic
5940000	5942000	You guys, but uh
5942000	5944000	Whatever, we're flexible
5944000	5946000	Uh, let's see
5946000	5948000	Souture in Twitter
5948000	5950000	Says, uh, what I've been playing
5950000	5952000	Harvest Moon, hero of Leaf Valley
5952000	5954000	Fun, but frequent, those short
5954000	5956000	Loading screens. What do you think of Harvest Moon?
5956000	5958000	I tried to get into that series
5958000	5960000	On the GameCube, I think there was a game on the GameCube
5960000	5962000	I couldn't really get into it, I don't know
5962000	5964000	Like, I was just more into Animal Crossing
5964000	5966000	I wasn't, maybe it was too much
5966000	5967000	Fun with Cows!
5967000	5969000	Maybe it was too much micromanaging for me
5969000	5971000	I think it's one of those games I really need to give another shot
5971000	5973000	Like, I don't think I gave it a fair shot, to be honest
5973000	5974000	Fun with Cows!
5974000	5976000	No, you know, Jessica played it a whole bunch
5976000	5978000	When I would hangover
5978000	5980000	And I was just like, look, my cow loves me!
5980000	5982000	Okay
5982000	5984000	You know, Harvest Moon kind of strikes me as like a Facebook game
5984000	5986000	Like, I'm kind of surprised it's not on Facebook
5986000	5988000	Uh, I'm surprised
5988000	5990000	Especially with the success of what, uh, Farmville
5990000	5992000	Farmville? Like, seriously
5992000	5994000	Why are they not suing over this?
5994000	5996000	I don't know
5996000	5998000	Uh, let's see, more tweets
5998000	6000000	TheShadowSniper tweets us
6000000	6002000	OLR, you guys are awesome!
6002000	6004000	Do you agree?
6004000	6006000	No. Most days
6006000	6008000	I'm awesome every day, Rob
6008000	6010000	Uh, KnightsOfBlaze says
6010000	6012000	Here's Twitter topic for tonight
6012000	6014000	Blur or SplitSecond, which will be better?
6014000	6016000	SplitSecond
6016000	6018000	Tough. I haven't played the SplitSecond demo yet
6018000	6020000	SplitSecond looks awesome
6020000	6022000	Blur, I think, would be fun
6022000	6024000	Because people like playing online
6024000	6026000	But I don't really give a crap about online
6026000	6028000	So I'm all about SplitSecond
6028000	6030000	Plus, they have that new survival mode now
6030000	6032000	Which looks all sorts of awesome
6032000	6034000	So, that'd be the first game I'm gonna play
6034000	6036000	They may check out Blur later on
6036000	6038000	But both of them to me win the I don't care rating
6038000	6040000	They both look awesome to me
6040000	6042000	But I'm gonna say Blur just because it's the one
6042000	6044000	Loki didn't pick
6044000	6046000	So now it's officially a tie
6046000	6048000	I'll let Dan get whatever he wants to and then I'll go
6048000	6050000	Oh, that's neat
6050000	6052000	One for Blur, one for SplitSecond, one for I don't give a fuck
6052000	6054000	I mean, you have like
6054000	6056000	You have a game that looks like Burnout with explosions
6056000	6058000	Or you have, you know, Mario Kart meets
6058000	6060000	Project Gotham
6060000	6062000	It's tough
6062000	6064000	Both games look good actually
6064000	6066000	But we'll see, you know, a lot of it has to do with the controls too
6066000	6068000	Keep that in mind
6068000	6070000	So we'll see how they control
6070000	6072000	Blur controls pretty good, I'll check out SplitSecond soon
6072000	6074000	But I remember playing it at E3 last year and it was pretty cool
6074000	6076000	I wonder if they'll have the same damn demo this year
6076000	6078000	Oh no, the game will be out by E3 this year
6078000	6080000	Game's out pretty soon
6080000	6082000	Tigerclaw sends us a couple stories
6082000	6084000	I'll go ahead and read this one here
6084000	6086000	Because the other one I think Bobby got on his show
6086000	6088000	So let's talk about this one here
6088000	6090000	Um
6090000	6092000	Oh, I love this
6092000	6094000	This is so appropriate what Tigerclaw sent us
6094000	6096000	Apparently a couple of game testers
6096000	6098000	At Activision as identified
6098000	6100000	By one of the vending machines in the background
6100000	6102000	They had a speed eating competition
6102000	6104000	Of the KFC Double Down
6104000	6106000	Polishing it off in
6106000	6108000	57.97 seconds
6108000	6110000	That's just under a minute
6110000	6112000	Apparently it was sent
6112000	6114000	In some type of video over to Kotaku
6114000	6116000	Not yet verified by Twin Galaxies
6116000	6118000	LOL, so there it is
6118000	6120000	You can actually see the guys eating the Double Down
6120000	6122000	And um
6122000	6124000	These little bastards are skinny
6124000	6126000	That's what I don't like, like if I ate that Double Down
6126000	6128000	In 60 seconds, I would gain weight
6128000	6130000	These little bastards are still skinny
6130000	6132000	You guys can go to hell
6132000	6134000	Alright, uh
6134000	6136000	I'm just jealous
6136000	6138000	Let's see, um
6138000	6140000	Sponstwang says, can anyone make me
6140000	6142000	Anything OLR slash gamer
6142000	6144000	Related I can wear on my 5K race
6144000	6146000	In a couple of weeks
6146000	6148000	I'm already going to wear a Pokewalker
6148000	6150000	I don't know, Dark Soccer is the
6150000	6152000	Seamstress of the bunch
6152000	6154000	I can
6154000	6156000	Make you a keychain
6156000	6158000	I don't know if Misty
6158000	6160000	Is still in the business of making
6160000	6162000	OLR keychains and stuff
6162000	6164000	But you might want to try talking to Misty
6164000	6166000	Because I know she used to have some of that stuff
6166000	6168000	Like, you know, beaderies and necklaces
6168000	6170000	And things like that
6170000	6172000	Yeah, I've been talking about that for years
6172000	6174000	Nothing yet, nothing yet, maybe soon
6174000	6176000	Uh, let's see
6176000	6178000	DarkTetsuya wanted to give a big fat plug
6178000	6180000	To his new series on our website
6180000	6182000	I, uh, love this
6182000	6184000	New series that he came up with
6184000	6186000	I think it's a great addition to our website
6186000	6188000	It's called A Look Back
6188000	6190000	We kind of need to give it a better name though
6190000	6192000	A Look Back, I mean, don't get me wrong
6192000	6194000	The name suffices for what it is, it is a look back
6194000	6196000	But we need something a little more hardcore
6196000	6198000	Than a look back
6198000	6200000	You can look back, bitches
6200000	6202000	Maybe not
6202000	6204000	But anyway, regardless of what it's called
6204000	6206000	The system is really good
6206000	6208000	It's A Look Back, the MSX is the first in the series
6208000	6210000	And he talks about what the MSX was all about
6210000	6212000	Because, um, it's, uh
6212000	6214000	Cool because the MSX is a
6214000	6216000	Console we didn't get here
6216000	6218000	And so you can read a little more about it
6218000	6220000	So, that's kind of nice
6220000	6222000	BlackWolf suggests rear view mirror
6222000	6224000	I kind of like that
6224000	6226000	Let's see
6226000	6228000	I said he's not totally, um
6228000	6230000	I like that rose colored rear view mirror
6230000	6232000	Anyway, uh
6232000	6234000	Let's see, Blue Swim sends us
6234000	6236000	A tweet saying
6236000	6238000	Rob, are you going to get behind the
6238000	6240000	Bieber ruined Twitter trending topic
6240000	6242000	Happy that people are revolting
6242000	6244000	See, I'm just ahead of my time
6244000	6246000	Because I commented on that whole thing a couple weeks ago
6246000	6248000	About how I don't want to use Twitter anymore
6248000	6250000	Because I really can't justify using a site
6250000	6252000	That Justin Bieber is a trending topic
6252000	6254000	On every single day
6254000	6256000	I'm glad that people are finally revolting
6256000	6258000	Take back Twitter!
6258000	6260000	From Justin Bieber and all his frickin' mouthy fans
6260000	6262000	And, uh, there you have it
6262000	6264000	Those are Twitter topics for tonight
6264000	6266000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R
6266000	6268000	Or just ignore it
6268000	6270000	I can't ignore it
6270000	6272000	Because you got the Bieber fear
6272000	6274000	It's not in my nature
6274000	6276000	S2100Matt says the look back idea
6276000	6278000	Was actually his idea
6278000	6280000	Oh, my bad
6280000	6282000	Sorry, Matt
6282000	6284000	I hate the series
6284000	6286000	It just, you know, needs a more hardcore name
6286000	6288000	That's right
6288000	6290000	A look back to the extreme
6290000	6292000	A look back extreme mix
6292000	6294000	Alright
6294000	6296000	Anyhow, let's go on to a couple more stories here
6296000	6298000	Listless coming up in just a little bit
6298000	6300000	With a special guest, Loki
6300000	6302000	As I'm sure a lot of people thought
6302000	6304000	Maybe hell froze over earlier this week
6304000	6306000	But, um
6306000	6308000	Bungie has entered in a ten year partnership
6308000	6310000	With Activision
6310000	6312000	Um
6312000	6314000	Yeah, apparently they're gonna publish the next
6314000	6316000	Or all games based on, um, Bungie's
6316000	6318000	Next big action game universe
6318000	6320000	And, um
6320000	6322000	They're looking to publish on multiple
6322000	6324000	Platforms, so it's no longer gonna be, you know
6324000	6326000	Xbox exclusive anymore
6326000	6328000	And, um
6328000	6330000	It kinda makes you wonder
6330000	6332000	Bungie, have you not been reading the news?
6332000	6334000	I mean, seriously?
6334000	6336000	Yeah, but there's a huge difference, Loki
6336000	6338000	I think you made the mistake a lot of people are making
6338000	6340000	Activision did not buy
6340000	6342000	Bungie
6342000	6344000	Activision has a publishing deal with Bungie
6344000	6346000	Activision is basically getting free money out of this deal
6346000	6348000	I mean, all they're doing, they're putting out
6348000	6350000	You know, they'll do the marketing
6350000	6352000	They do everything outside the actual development of the game
6352000	6354000	Alright
6354000	6356000	That's what this agreement's all about
6356000	6358000	I honestly don't think this is a big deal
6358000	6360000	If Activision had bought Bungie, then yes
6360000	6362000	Oh my gosh, doom and gloom, Bungie, what are you smoking?
6362000	6364000	You all are high
6364000	6366000	But, it's just a publishing deal
6366000	6368000	I mean, they had to sign with somebody
6368000	6370000	They weren't gonna self-publish
6370000	6372000	And what's funny is, uh
6372000	6374000	Bungie's Harold Ryan looks like
6374000	6376000	Brendan Fraser, he even has that
6376000	6378000	Really creepy smile
6378000	6380000	I didn't realize Brendan Fraser had a creepy smile
6380000	6382000	Yeah, he's just creepy all around
6382000	6384000	Um, so yeah
6384000	6386000	So they're gonna be publishing their next game
6386000	6388000	They'll work out exactly what the next game is actually
6388000	6390000	Gonna be
6390000	6392000	But that will probably be coming up at E3
6392000	6394000	Probably at E3, and then
6394000	6396000	It's also probably gonna help with that void
6396000	6398000	Of people that
6398000	6400000	Hate on Activision right now, although
6400000	6402000	I can't imagine it's gonna really affect their sales that much
6402000	6404000	Including the Call of Duty franchise
6404000	6406000	Cause people bitch, but people still buy
6408000	6410000	It would be interesting to know about this agreement
6410000	6412000	If the Final Cut
6412000	6414000	Arrangement is still with Bungie
6414000	6416000	You know Final Cut, so to speak
6416000	6418000	Or if Activision gets to make changes to games they want to publish
6418000	6420000	I doubt that's in the agreement
6420000	6422000	Kinda Bungie, I imagine, got to do whatever the hell
6422000	6424000	They wanted with this
6424000	6426000	So I don't think this is gonna be bad news at all
6426000	6428000	I really don't
6428000	6430000	You know, and I've been as critical of Activision as the next guy
6430000	6432000	And so forth, but I just think this is just
6432000	6434000	Bungie had to sign with someone
6434000	6436000	And Activision makes as good of a sense as anyone else
6436000	6438000	If it had been EA
6438000	6440000	People would have still been like, oh my god
6440000	6442000	I can't believe it
6442000	6444000	It could have been Konami
6444000	6446000	Oh my god
6446000	6448000	Doesn't matter
6448000	6450000	I think Bungie just wanted to
6450000	6452000	Sign with somebody
6452000	6454000	You knew it was gonna be somebody here in the US
6454000	6456000	Cause they're a US development company
6456000	6458000	So it wasn't gonna be Konami or any of those
6458000	6460000	SNK or any of those overseas companies
6460000	6462000	It was gonna be an American company
6462000	6464000	And that pretty much leaves EA and Activision
6464000	6466000	Pick one
6466000	6468000	Alright, anyhow
6468000	6470000	Moving on, Square Enix
6470000	6472000	And one of the games they get requested about a lot
6472000	6474000	Is Final Fantasy 5 and Final Fantasy 6
6474000	6476000	On the DS
6476000	6478000	Cause you might remember they had an epic, epic remake
6478000	6480000	Of Final Fantasy 3
6480000	6482000	That was followed by an epic remake of Final Fantasy 4
6482000	6484000	When I say epic remake, they were done in the more 3D-ish
6484000	6486000	Style of the newer Final Fantasy games
6486000	6488000	Which is pretty awesome
6488000	6490000	So the big question on everybody's mind is
6490000	6492000	Where the hell is Final Fantasy 5
6492000	6494000	And really Final Fantasy 5 is just a stepping stone
6494000	6496000	To Final Fantasy 6
6496000	6498000	Because we want our opera scene in fully rendered 3D
6498000	6500000	Thank you very much
6500000	6502000	But apparently
6502000	6504000	It's not in development just yet
6504000	6506000	There was apparently a Twitter thing
6506000	6508000	Going on earlier this week
6508000	6510000	And one of the producers of Square Enix
6510000	6512000	Shinji Hashimoto
6512000	6514000	Was quoted on Twitter saying that
6514000	6516000	They are undecided about
6516000	6518000	A downloadable port of Second Densetsu 3
6518000	6520000	And the mobile RPG Everheart Odyssey
6520000	6522000	And then he also said
6522000	6524000	For Final Fantasy 5 and 6
6524000	6526000	There are technical issues as well
6526000	6528000	So at present these are also
6528000	6530000	Undecided
6530000	6532000	Not sure what those technical issues are
6532000	6534000	I wonder if it's space
6534000	6536000	It's a much shorter game than 5 and 6
6536000	6538000	And I wonder if they maybe have just maxed out
6538000	6540000	Those damn cartridges
6540000	6542000	I wouldn't think so
6542000	6544000	I don't think so
6544000	6546000	Well Amiga777
6546000	6548000	In chat says Square Enix spare us
6548000	6550000	The FMV theatrics and give us some awesome gameplay
6550000	6552000	I agree I would sacrifice
6552000	6554000	The full motion theatrics
6554000	6556000	For some uber 3D-ness
6556000	6558000	But I don't know
6558000	6560000	At the same time
6560000	6562000	I'm okay if they spend the resources just developing
6562000	6564000	Something new you know
6564000	6566000	Although I don't know I'm torn
6566000	6568000	Because the 3 and 4 remakes were pretty hot
6568000	6570000	But at the same time I'm not like
6570000	6572000	Ah they need to do 5 and 6
6572000	6574000	Or you know if you just want to I don't know
6574000	6576000	Port say for example 4, 5 and 6
6576000	6578000	Onto a DS cartridge
6578000	6580000	And don't even worry about upgrading it
6580000	6582000	I'd be fine with that
6582000	6584000	Maybe it's something they're going to do for the 3DS
6584000	6586000	Hmm?
6586000	6588000	I don't know
6588000	6590000	Alright guys well we
6590000	6592000	Are going to get into a segment here on the show
6592000	6594000	Called Listless
6594000	6596000	Yay Listless
6596000	6598000	Weee
6598000	6600000	And for tonight's Listless
6600000	6602000	We got to get one of our friends here on the phone
6602000	6604000	So we're going to make a little
6604000	6606000	Outbound call right now
6606000	6608000	Tonight's Listless topic what Capcom
6608000	6610000	Versus series should they do
6610000	6612000	Next
6612000	6614000	Does somebody want to explain Listless how Listless works
6614000	6616000	While I give our guest a call tonight
6616000	6618000	Well the way that it works
6618000	6620000	Is that we go around all of us
6620000	6622000	And we each pick a game
6622000	6624000	We pick 3 of them in
6624000	6626000	Order or pick a subject
6626000	6628000	You know something that we would like to be on the list
6628000	6630000	Not a game tonight but something
6630000	6632000	And then what happens is we leave it
6632000	6634000	To the chat room to pick
6634000	6636000	Um
6636000	6638000	Well we each take one off of the list
6638000	6640000	And then we leave it to the chat room to pick the winner
6640000	6642000	That's right so if you want to help
6642000	6644000	Vote for the winner and remember guys
6644000	6646000	This is the definitive list
6646000	6648000	If this list is written there's no arguing
6648000	6650000	It's done
6650000	6652000	It's the definitive list it's a highly scientific
6652000	6654000	Process but in order to play the game
6654000	6656000	We need 4 people so we're going to
6656000	6658000	Call up a special guest right now
6658000	6660000	Let me down the music here
6660000	6662000	While we give our guest a call here
6662000	6664000	Hopefully he's standing by I told him it would be 8 o'clock
6664000	6666000	Otherwise
6666000	6668000	We'll just open it up to somebody else on Skype
6668000	6670000	I suppose

6710000	6712000	Well folks let me introduce
6712000	6714000	Because I didn't say who was coming on the show tonight
6714000	6716000	This is our good buddy Jon Breslull
6716000	6718000	From Undersedation Live
6718000	6720000	Saturday nights here at All Games Radio

6726000	6728000	Eastern
6728000	6730000	Did you know that one of your old co-hosts
6730000	6732000	Said that I sound like a straight version of you
6734000	6736000	Who is that? Jenna?
6736000	6738000	Or Jessica?
6738000	6740000	When was she on the show? Yeah Jessica
6740000	6742000	I haven't talked to her in years
6742000	6744000	She's actually, whenever I take off from
6744000	6746000	U.S.L. she's going to be hosting for me now
6746000	6748000	Oh wow
6748000	6750000	How come I wasn't invited to be a guest host?
6750000	6752000	I see how it is
6752000	6754000	Okay well you can bring that up with Travis
6754000	6756000	I will I will
6756000	6758000	I'm going to be my Star Trek Online character just to find Travis
6758000	6760000	And beat the shit out of him
6760000	6762000	Was Travis a human? I have to be a Klingon
6762000	6764000	I don't know I don't play Star Trek Online
6764000	6766000	I play WoW
6766000	6768000	I don't know because certain somebody named Travis
6768000	6770000	Took me off of Facebook
6770000	6772000	Travis Donovan you're a bitch
6772000	6774000	Punch him in the balls
6774000	6776000	That's always a good solution for Travis
6776000	6778000	You know what though?
6778000	6780000	Facebook does weird things
6780000	6782000	I've lost friends mysteriously
6782000	6784000	He may not have done that on purpose
6784000	6786000	If he did he's got some drama
6786000	6788000	Alright here we go
6788000	6790000	Let's do this
6790000	6792000	Hey tell the people in the background to shut up
6792000	6794000	We're trying to do a radio show
6794000	6796000	Hey people in the background please stop masturbating
6796000	6798000	Alright
6798000	6800000	How was Securicon by the way?
6800000	6802000	Did you have fun?
6802000	6804000	It was a lot of fun
6804000	6806000	I made a lot of friends
6806000	6808000	I made a lot more friends and it was just a great time
6808000	6810000	Wait you have friends?
6810000	6812000	Definitely look forward to 2011
6812000	6816000	Oh good times good times
6816000	6820000	Aren't we supposed to be playing a game online soon or something?
6820000	6822000	Was I what?
6822000	6824000	Never mind
6824000	6826000	I think I was talking about something I'm not supposed to talk about yet
6826000	6828000	Alright
6828000	6830000	Let's get into something else
6830000	6832000	Get into the list list
6832000	6834000	You know tonight's topic is
6834000	6836000	What Capcom vs series or should I say vs Capcom series
6836000	6838000	Should they do next?
6838000	6842000	We're going to go around and get your top 3 answers
6842000	6844000	Breslow we'll start with you
6844000	6846000	Your number 3 answer
6846000	6848000	What Capcom vs series should they do next?
6848000	6850000	I'm throwing the political card on here
6850000	6852000	Because I think this is the most important one
6852000	6854000	Since I get to go first
6854000	6856000	And I'm surprised I haven't done this
6856000	6858000	Capcom vs Midway
6858000	6860000	That would be fun
6860000	6862000	So like Mortal Kombat characters
6862000	6864000	Yeah so you'd have a bunch of Mortal Kombat characters
6864000	6866000	Against the Street Fighter characters and such
6866000	6868000	I think that would be awesome
6868000	6872000	I'm actually rewording your answer to be Midway vs Capcom
6872000	6874000	Because it's always something vs Capcom
6874000	6876000	Just so you know
6876000	6878000	That was attractive
6878000	6882000	By the way, logical answer coming from Breslow
6882000	6884000	I mean this episode is full of shockers tonight
6884000	6886000	Alright
6886000	6888000	Who wants to go next?
6888000	6890000	Dark Sakura what do you want to pick for your number 3 answer?
6890000	6892000	Um
6892000	6894000	McDonaldland vs Capcom
6894000	6896000	Mayor McCheese
6896000	6898000	And the Grimace
6898000	6900000	And the Fry Guys
6900000	6902000	I fucking love it
6902000	6904000	The Grimace
6904000	6906000	And
6906000	6908000	Birdie the Early Bird
6910000	6912000	Hello?
6912000	6914000	Whatever happened in the McDonaldland characters?
6914000	6916000	Hello?
6916000	6918000	Breslow?
6918000	6920000	It's McDonaldland vs Capcom
6920000	6922000	Is what it is
6922000	6924000	Oh our stream
6924000	6926000	I want Mayor McCheese as the boss
6926000	6928000	Apparently our stream died
6928000	6930000	And our thing is trying to reconnect right now
6930000	6932000	But we're going to keep recording for podcast sake
6932000	6934000	Shit but now our chatters
6934000	6936000	Can't hear to vote
6936000	6938000	We're going to hope
6938000	6940000	The chatters right now are saying
6940000	6942000	The all games stream vs Capcom
6942000	6944000	Because apparently we shut down
6944000	6946000	Alright we're back up
6946000	6948000	Alright so far we have Midway vs Capcom
6948000	6950000	And McDonaldland vs Capcom
6950000	6952000	Alright Loki
6952000	6954000	What is your number 3 answer tonight?
6954000	6956000	I was trying to be slightly serious here
6956000	6958000	So this is kind of obscure
6958000	6960000	For people who don't remember
6960000	6962000	But Paul Robertson vs Capcom
6962000	6964000	And to explain
6964000	6966000	Who Paul Robertson is
6966000	6968000	He's the guy that did the animation
6968000	6970000	Pirate Baby's Cabana Street Fight
6970000	6972000	And then also
6972000	6974000	Yes that one
6974000	6976000	That animation was such an amazing thing
6976000	6978000	Exactly and like
6978000	6980000	Devil eyes and just like
6980000	6982000	All sorts of crazy ass 8 bit
6982000	6984000	Animation stuff so
6984000	6986000	That would be kind of cool
6986000	6988000	Okay fair enough
6988000	6990000	Paul Robertson vs Capcom
6990000	6992000	It's better than Pirate Baby's Cabana Street Fight
6992000	6994000	vs Capcom
6994000	6996000	Alright my number 3 answer
6996000	6998000	I have picked Saturday Night Live
6998000	7000000	vs Capcom
7000000	7002000	Because
7002000	7004000	I just won an excuse to
7004000	7006000	Beat the shit out of any character Chris Kattan
7006000	7008000	Who I never played
7008000	7010000	And you know I think some of it would be kind of cool
7010000	7012000	You know your favorite SNL
7012000	7014000	Like the coneheads and the guys that
7014000	7016000	Bob their heads to what is love
7016000	7018000	Baby don't hurt me
7018000	7020000	SNL vs Capcom is my number 3 answer
7020000	7022000	Did you like that answer Bresloh?
7022000	7024000	I did
7024000	7026000	I beat the crap out of all the crappy skits
7026000	7028000	They've done from like 97 to 2003
7028000	7030000	I know it would be fun
7030000	7032000	Alright
7032000	7034000	Anyhow your number 2 answer
7034000	7036000	Bresloh and just to catch the folks up joining us
7036000	7038000	Because the feed was down so far we have
7038000	7040000	Midway vs Capcom
7040000	7042000	McDonaldland vs Capcom
7042000	7044000	Paul Robertson vs Capcom
7044000	7046000	And Saturday Night Live vs Capcom
7046000	7048000	What is your
7048000	7050000	Number 2 answer
7050000	7052000	Bresloh?
7052000	7054000	How bad would you want?
7054000	7056000	Jesus vs Capcom
7056000	7058000	So Jesus vs Capcom
7058000	7060000	You're not going to make it just
7060000	7062000	The Bible?
7062000	7064000	Bible vs Capcom
7064000	7066000	Bible vs Capcom
7068000	7070000	So you can play like Moses
7070000	7072000	And Jesus
7072000	7074000	What character
7074000	7076000	God would be the end boss
7076000	7078000	Who would be the end boss?
7078000	7080000	God
7080000	7082000	God would be the end boss
7082000	7084000	Bible vs Capcom
7086000	7088000	I love some of these answers in chat
7088000	7090000	I'm just cracking up
7090000	7092000	Sarah your number 2 pick
7092000	7094000	It was actually something on the serious end
7094000	7096000	I picked
7096000	7098000	Arc System Works vs Capcom
7098000	7100000	As in Guilty Gear and Blaze Blue
7102000	7104000	Ah okay
7104000	7106000	So you want your Blaze Blue and all that stuff vs Capcom
7106000	7108000	And the fighting
7108000	7110000	The fighting systems
7110000	7112000	Are pretty similar too
7112000	7114000	So I think it would be fun
7114000	7116000	I want to have Strider hear you
7116000	7118000	vs the little bad guy
7118000	7120000	Alright
7120000	7122000	Let's see, Loki what is your number 2
7122000	7124000	answer tonight?
7124000	7126000	You know I had to change one of my answers
7126000	7128000	Because of your SNL thing
7128000	7130000	I got to top that
7130000	7132000	Although that would be my number 1 answer
7132000	7134000	Now it's going to be a semi serious one
7134000	7136000	Konami vs Capcom
7136000	7138000	Because they have a lot of good 8-bit characters
7138000	7140000	That would be pretty awesome to bring over
7140000	7142000	You have different Contra characters
7142000	7144000	Hell you can put
7144000	7146000	Frogger in there if you want
7146000	7148000	Castlevania
7148000	7150000	I mean that would be pretty awesome
7150000	7152000	Alright
7152000	7154000	I'm also going to go with the super freaking
7154000	7156000	Obviously I was going to do
7156000	7158000	See I don't know if this would
7158000	7160000	Well I'm going to go with a different one
7160000	7162000	Because I already have a list just in case mine gets taken
7162000	7164000	Mine was kind of a Konami thing
7164000	7166000	But I'll go ahead and go in a different direction
7166000	7168000	I'm going to do the completely obvious and probably stealing someone else's answer
7168000	7170000	And why hasn't anyone thought of this yet
7170000	7172000	Nintendo vs Capcom
7172000	7174000	Hello
7174000	7176000	I'm a jackass Ronald Roberts

7270000	7272000	Getting like
7272000	7274000	Hadoken
7274000	7276000	What would their special move be
7276000	7278000	They'd just trap the opponent in a bubble
7278000	7280000	Yeah and pop them
7280000	7282000	That might be fun
7282000	7284000	They'd have special attacks like the water
7284000	7286000	Bubble
7286000	7288000	Boom
7288000	7290000	We're recording this

7300000	7302000	Loki your number 1 answer please
7302000	7304000	My number 1 answer is
7304000	7306000	Very obvious considering the
7306000	7308000	SNL thing
7308000	7310000	It's Nick at Nite vs Capcom
7310000	7312000	And of course
7312000	7314000	It's awesome because you have a fighting
7314000	7316000	game with Bill Cosby
7316000	7318000	Will Smith
7318000	7320000	From the Fresh Prince of Bel Air
7320000	7322000	John shut the fuck up
7322000	7324000	You're interrupting a professionally done radio
7324000	7326000	show by raping me
7326000	7328000	I just want you to know this
7328000	7330000	This is a bad idea
7330000	7332000	Hey

7334000	7336000	asshole raped by a woman
7336000	7338000	In time to do this show here
7338000	7340000	Actually the worst part is I'm getting my
7340000	7342000	asshole raped by a man
7342000	7344000	That's nothing new

7348000	7350000	Yes and I think the golden
7350000	7352000	girls was on there one time so that would be
7352000	7354000	pretty awesome
7354000	7356000	The monkeys were on there and could you imagine that fight
7356000	7358000	That would be pretty awesome
7358000	7360000	As long as Bea Arthur is a character I'm fine
7360000	7362000	Would Bea Arthur be a character?
7362000	7364000	Sure then I'm fine

7470000	7472000	I'm sorry chat room that's just it's the it's
7472000	7474000	one of life's tough lessons is that
7474000	7476000	sometimes your account

7484000	7486000	uh here it is for your recap
7486000	7488000	we're gonna go around and take one off the
7488000	7490000	list alright Bresl so listen carefully
7490000	7492000	cause I'm not gonna read this a million times
7492000	7494000	Midway vs Capcom
7494000	7496000	McDonaldland vs Capcom
7496000	7498000	Paul Robertson vs Capcom
7498000	7500000	SNL vs Capcom
7500000	7502000	Bible vs Capcom
7502000	7504000	Arc System Works vs Capcom
7504000	7506000	Konami vs Capcom
7506000	7508000	Nintendo vs Capcom
7508000	7510000	All Games vs Capcom
7510000	7512000	and Whedon vs Capcom
7512000	7514000	Bresl which one of these
7514000	7516000	is not worthy of the list?
7516000	7518000	Nintendo vs Capcom
7518000	7520000	Oh you whore
7520000	7522000	why not
7522000	7524000	it'd be hard to go multiplatform
7524000	7526000	because it would turn into the Capcom characters
7526000	7528000	have to do button combinations and then you could
7528000	7530000	just stamp Falcon Punch
7530000	7532000	with the Nintendo characters
7532000	7534000	I suppose I will accept that logic
7534000	7536000	but you're still an asshole alright
7536000	7538000	Dark Sakura you're next
7538000	7540000	which one of these is not worthy of the list?
7540000	7542000	Bible vs Capcom
7542000	7544000	oh you just
7544000	7546000	just
7546000	7548000	not feeling Jesus
7548000	7550000	as a playable character huh?
7550000	7552000	I don't really give a crap about
7552000	7554000	Jesus in the game
7554000	7556000	alright fair enough
7556000	7558000	Loki which one of these is not worthy of the list?
7558000	7560000	uh
7560000	7562000	I'm gonna have to go with Midway vs Capcom
7562000	7564000	just because
7564000	7566000	you know I've seen the
7566000	7568000	Coogan videos with the
7568000	7570000	Mortal Kombat characters vs Street Fighter
7570000	7572000	it looks weird okay
7572000	7574000	I guess they could reanimate them
7574000	7576000	but it would just be weird
7576000	7578000	and besides Midway
7578000	7580000	is no longer around so
7580000	7582000	that's true it would be kinda hard to get the licensing wouldn't it
7582000	7584000	alright as far as me
7584000	7586000	which one of these is not worthy of the list?
7586000	7588000	I'm gonna have to say Paul Robertson vs Capcom
7588000	7590000	too obscure
7590000	7592000	too obscure sorry Loki
7592000	7594000	I'm sure it was funny but too obscure
7594000	7596000	see there's more coming in
7596000	7598000	Rob's Mom vs Capcom
7598000	7600000	Atlas vs Capcom

7720000	7722000	darksagras save us
7722000	7724000	for call of duty fans
7724000	7726000	actually the next one coming out
7726000	7728000	has been named
7728000	7730000	it's call of duty
7730000	7732000	black ops coming out on
7732000	7734000	the 9th of November 2010
7734000	7736000	that's at least the European date
7736000	7738000	and they've confirmed co-op
7738000	7740000	for it so
7740000	7742000	you can play with your buddies together
7742000	7744000	killing people
7744000	7746000	and that's actually one
7746000	7748000	that I would be interested in I think
7748000	7750000	checking out is a black ops
7750000	7752000	game you know
7752000	7754000	instead of you know full on face front combo
7754000	7756000	you know combat you have
7756000	7758000	to be sneaky like solid snake
7758000	7760000	so
7760000	7762000	I
7762000	7764000	well I'm sure the fans
7764000	7766000	are just
7766000	7768000	all they're saying is it's a
7768000	7770000	Treyarch call of duty
7770000	7772000	so
7772000	7774000	um
7774000	7776000	alright so apparently
7776000	7778000	this is kind of interesting and scary at the same time
7778000	7780000	red faction
7780000	7782000	a wonderful
7782000	7784000	you know kind of sci-fi
7784000	7786000	action game from
7786000	7788000	Q and volition is being
7788000	7790000	turned into a TV
7790000	7792000	movie the problem is
7792000	7794000	it's being produced by sci-fi
7794000	7796000	the same folks that brought us
7796000	7798000	what was it
7798000	7800000	mega shark versus
7800000	7802000	giant octopus or whatever the hell
7802000	7804000	it was that's
7804000	7806000	scary I'm sorry how is this
7806000	7808000	a problem
7808000	7810000	I believe you just called
7810000	7812000	this a problem because it's gonna
7812000	7814000	suck the problem is the rumor I
7814000	7816000	heard that sci-fi is like picking up wrestling
7816000	7818000	and stuff now and they're not gonna do those movies
7818000	7820000	anymore that's a problem
7820000	7822000	they're all just
7822000	7824000	blending together every station does
7824000	7826000	not need wrestling okay
7826000	7828000	unless they're dressing up like space
7828000	7830000	aliens or people from
7830000	7832000	battle star galactica it does not
7832000	7834000	need to be on sci-fi there is nothing
7834000	7836000	science fiction about wrestling except for the plot
7836000	7838000	um
7838000	7840000	what the hell is that
7844000	7846000	watch the shark
7846000	7848000	through the plane
7850000	7852000	ah yes
7852000	7854000	it is so
7854000	7856000	this looks so fake I love it
7856000	7858000	condor airlines
7862000	7864000	and they had a
7864000	7866000	image or whatever a little picture
7866000	7868000	that someone made that talked about what
7868000	7870000	it would take physics wise for
7870000	7872000	the shark to do that it was just
7872000	7874000	retarded
7876000	7878000	ah yes high production
7878000	7880000	value right there
7880000	7882000	holy shit
7888000	7890000	that's the kind of stuff you make
7890000	7892000	in like high school how dare someone
7892000	7894000	try to take this from me
7894000	7896000	shark eating a
7896000	7898000	plane how dare you try to take that out of
7898000	7900000	my life anyways
7900000	7902000	so they're gonna be doing
7902000	7904000	possibly um
7904000	7906000	an ongoing series
7906000	7908000	as well if the movie does well so it's
7908000	7910000	expected to be um
7910000	7912000	coming out early 2011
7912000	7914000	and um
7914000	7916000	we'll see how it turns out cause
7916000	7918000	most movies that are based on video
7918000	7920000	games kinda suck and this one's
7920000	7922000	done by sci-fi who puts out movies that
7922000	7924000	pretty much always suck so
7926000	7928000	I don't know it's like um
7928000	7930000	a convergence of suck
7933000	7935000	a convergence of suck really
7935000	7937000	yes alright uh
7937000	7939000	well we'll see what happens uh good thing
7939000	7941000	they're not making a movie out of this but uh
7941000	7943000	cause I think it would be kinda boring but apparently
7943000	7945000	somebody has beat Bejeweled 2
7945000	7947000	yes who knew that Bejeweled 2
7947000	7949000	was beatable I sure didn't but Bejeweled 2
7949000	7951000	got beaten this week after
7951000	7953000	three years
7953000	7955000	that's right this guy Mike
7955000	7958000	Lady? Ladi? Ladi?
7958000	7960000	he probably gets called Lady poor guy
7960000	7962000	Mike Ladi I'm gonna say it's Ladi
7962000	7964000	uh apparently uh beat
7964000	7966000	Bejeweled 2 he played the same game
7966000	7968000	for 2205
7968000	7970000	hours and 51 minutes that
7970000	7972000	was a score of 2
7972000	7974000	billion 147 million
7974000	7976000	so on and so on points apparently
7976000	7978000	that's the point where the score display
7978000	7980000	just went to black and there's actually
7980000	7982000	a YouTube of it that's up um
7982000	7984000	and PopCap just said hey
7984000	7986000	you beat it they didn't
7986000	7988000	want to acknowledge that the game broke they were just like
7988000	7990000	you beat it congrats
7990000	7992000	it's the Bejeweled kill screen
7992000	7994000	yeah it's basically what it is the Bejeweled kill screen and you can
7994000	7996000	actually see
7996000	7998000	PopCap actually put up the video themselves
8000000	8002000	exactly what that took
8002000	8004000	and I think they put the picture
8004000	8006000	of the kill screen here
8006000	8008000	or not cause maybe PopCap
8008000	8010000	didn't want to show their game breaking
8010000	8012000	I don't know
8012000	8014000	that was just like a little promotional video
8014000	8016000	it was all happy go lucky
8016000	8018000	yay Bejeweled were awesome
8018000	8020000	play us on Facebook
8020000	8022000	well somebody broke it so yes a kill screen
8022000	8024000	is achievable in Bejeweled 2 but 3 years
8024000	8026000	seriously
8026000	8028000	seriously
8028000	8030000	3 years is a long time
8030000	8032000	I know right
8032000	8034000	and that was all time when he was supposed to be working
8034000	8036000	mailbag
8040000	8042000	every week you send us emails
8042000	8044000	mailbagatorangelaungeradio.com
8044000	8046000	darksacra might read them on air
8046000	8048000	and she might decide to say screw you guys I'm not reading emails this week
8048000	8050000	I'm reading them
8050000	8052000	alright yay we caught her in a good mood
8052000	8054000	hello Orange Lounge Radio
8054000	8056000	Haseo here to rant a bit
8056000	8058000	first I'm sorry for spelling errors due to the use of
8058000	8060000	Vicodin after surgery involving
8060000	8062000	knee dislocation dude sorry
8062000	8064000	but you misspelled Vicodin
8064000	8066000	you know what though I would say
8066000	8068000	being on Vicodin is an acceptable excuse
8068000	8070000	for bad grammar dude when you're on Vicodin you don't
8070000	8072000	care
8072000	8074000	we're going to give them a pass
8074000	8076000	second I was really just saying that to be
8076000	8078000	a smartass second the whole Activision
8078000	8080000	bullshit starting with this whole
8080000	8082000	Infinity Ward leaving the company
8082000	8084000	Infinity Ward left Activision
8084000	8086000	and they as we already
8086000	8088000	know are the creators of Call of Duty
8088000	8090000	now according to G4 and their
8090000	8092000	the feed service
8092000	8094000	they say that the next Call of Duty games will be called
8094000	8096000	Call of Duty Black Ops comes out this fall
8096000	8098000	what the hell is Activision thinking?
8098000	8100000	especially when the Infinity Ward founders left and
8100000	8102000	35 other team members quit oh and did I mention
8102000	8104000	they are suing Activision for up to
8104000	8106000	500 million
8106000	8108000	for reasons untold to me
8108000	8110000	now Activision as stupid as they are
8110000	8112000	they have the Bungie
8112000	8114000	they have Bungie the creators of Halo
8114000	8116000	sign a 10 year contract what the hell
8116000	8118000	lastly three questions
8118000	8120000	one would it be illegal
8120000	8122000	to infect my aunts computer with a virus
8122000	8124000	to teach her a lesson?
8124000	8126000	how would I go about that?
8126000	8128000	well she's a bitch I mean
8128000	8130000	no I'm not trying to cripple it only trying to
8130000	8132000	burst her I'm not to blame for the
8132000	8134000	fucking it up bubble like a warning virus
8136000	8138000	switch her default browser
8138000	8140000	to Internet Explorer I think that will pretty much do it
8140000	8142000	I thought it would do it
8142000	8144000	have her use yahoo mail
8144000	8146000	just switch her homepage to
8146000	8148000	two girls one cup
8148000	8150000	or lemon party
8150000	8152000	two
8152000	8154000	is there a way to hack a copy of Final Fantasy 12
8154000	8156000	like you hacked 13
8156000	8158000	or do you know of a cheat I've beaten it over a year ago
8158000	8160000	and I want to replay for story
8160000	8162000	cause Loki's a big cheater
8162000	8164000	at 13 so can you cheat at 12?
8164000	8166000	12 I'm not sure
8166000	8168000	if there's a way to hack set at the
8168000	8170000	save I mean maybe
8170000	8172000	I'm sure there is
8172000	8174000	three
8174000	8176000	you just need a game genie
8176000	8178000	is there a way to hack an imported
8178000	8180000	UMD and change the text to English?
8180000	8182000	no
8182000	8184000	but yeah back to the
8184000	8186000	Final Fantasy 12 thing because it's on Playstation 2
8186000	8188000	you could probably just get like a game shark or
8188000	8190000	approach and replay or something like that
8190000	8192000	if you don't want to cheat in the game
8192000	8194000	why did
8194000	8196000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat just say two girls
8196000	8198000	one cup versus Capcom?
8198000	8200000	because he's trying to mess with
8200000	8202000	our brains I think the cup wins
8202000	8204000	thanks for reading my email
8204000	8206000	and if you don't what the fuck people
8206000	8208000	your loyal listener Hasia Sumiragawa
8208000	8210000	Sumiragawa
8210000	8212000	Sumiragawa
8212000	8214000	made me
8214000	8216000	I was just thinking of the cup winning
8216000	8218000	whoever wins we all lose
8218000	8220000	this is Robert M. I don't mean
8220000	8222000	to sound like one of those one-knit fanboys
8222000	8224000	but since it came out I'm pretty obsessed with WarioWare
8224000	8226000	DIY even though I'm currently somewhat
8226000	8228000	stagnant at creating new games in it
8228000	8230000	for some reason I actually had a dream
8230000	8232000	where one of my micro games set
8232000	8234000	a record for in-game sales
8234000	8236000	which somehow made the Orange Knowledge
8236000	8238000	Radio show roll I remember
8238000	8240000	Loki saying he didn't get it meaning the game
8240000	8242000	and all of you were
8242000	8244000	as all you did was tap and a character
8244000	8246000	moves up slightly
8246000	8248000	this somehow leads to a kernel of thought would you like to
8248000	8250000	see a series of OLR dream game micro
8250000	8252000	games or would you of course
8252000	8254000	prefer these concepts in a more substantial
8254000	8256000	more readily accessible less handheld
8256000	8258000	format I imagine having puzzle
8258000	8260000	slots or what they play snap
8260000	8262000	available in my warehouse might be
8262000	8264000	confusing to other people
8264000	8266000	in my in-game friends list have a good
8266000	8268000	show I think we'll take it in whatever format
8268000	8270000	we can get it yeah I know I'll take it wherever I can get it
8270000	8272000	but I think what they play dot com snap would
8272000	8274000	be very I mean because what was what
8274000	8276000	they play dot com snap supposed to be was just like what
8276000	8278000	two gay guys having sex holding
8278000	8280000	a dismembered head shouting fuck wasn't that the whole
8280000	8282000	and you take pictures of it like Pokemon
8282000	8284000	snap yeah and if you if you're kind of
8284000	8286000	like sitting at your radio right now in disgust
8286000	8288000	um it has to do with a poll
8288000	8290000	that what they play dot com ran like a
8290000	8292000	year ago about the most offensive game
8292000	8294000	most offensive thing in video games
8294000	8296000	and like I think homos and games was like
8296000	8298000	more offensive than dismembered heads or something
8298000	8300000	um so we suggested that they
8300000	8302000	should make a game about it called what they play dot com
8302000	8304000	snap uh go read about it in
8304000	8306000	the OLR wiki it's it's all there
8306000	8308000	this next email just made me
8308000	8310000	snort hard
8310000	8312000	hi OLR as usual thank you for
8312000	8314000	supporting yyr games OLR is awesome
8314000	8316000	and so is everyone who listens to it
8316000	8318000	as a show under mat
8318000	8320000	relayed your game request discussed
8320000	8322000	during the last weeks show apparently you have requested
8322000	8324000	a game based on the golden girls yes
8324000	8326000	yes please oh my god yes
8326000	8328000	after spending many hours sweating countless
8328000	8330000	buckets and crumbling hundreds of pieces
8330000	8332000	of paper before tossing them in the general
8332000	8334000	direction of a wastebasket I'm prepared to
8334000	8336000	unveil the following concept the golden girls
8336000	8338000	death squad
8338000	8340000	the golden girls death squad will be a four player
8340000	8342000	cooperative twin stick shooter
8342000	8344000	each player will assume the likeness of either
8344000	8346000	Dorothy, Rose, Blanche or Sophia
8346000	8348000	and battle an advancing army of terrorist robots
8348000	8350000	and balding perverted old men in full
8350000	8352000	180p high definition I'm sorry
8352000	8354000	I'm about to explode from awesomeness
8354000	8356000	Rob needs to go change his mantis
8356000	8358000	I do
8358000	8360000	you'll use the left stick to maneuver each
8360000	8362000	girl's technologically advanced mechanical
8362000	8364000	wheelchair each wheelchair
8364000	8366000	is equipped with its own unique weaponry
8366000	8368000	just as each girl is equipped with wisecracks
8368000	8370000	and quips taken straight from the popular TV
8370000	8372000	show voiced by the original actresses
8372000	8374000	spoken dialogue varies with context
8374000	8376000	when you get close to an enemy you'll hear Dorothy cry
8376000	8378000	have you lost your head? as she chops off their

8556000	8558000	unlimited 2 I was a big
8558000	8560000	fan of the original test drive unlimited
8560000	8562000	and we had an ol army clubhouse
8562000	8564000	joystick shows the demo reel here
8564000	8566000	um
8566000	8568000	it doesn't look like lost islands oahu setting
8568000	8570000	at least not for the video it does
8570000	8572000	look a lot more types
8572000	8574000	of driving events but the character models are
8574000	8576000	sims 2 ish still it releases
8576000	8578000	in fall amongst the big titles so I hope
8578000	8580000	it does well I never did get to play my 5000
8580000	8582000	miles in the first one I remember
8582000	8584000	test drive that was a pretty neat game
8584000	8586000	um it's
8586000	8588000	taken him long enough to kind of put out news of a sequel
8588000	8590000	I don't know I'll play it if it's good
8590000	8592000	but it's going to be tough because there's so many racing
8592000	8594000	games coming out that I'm so interested in
8594000	8596000	you know but um well that'll be
8596000	8598000	I'll be a ways out by the way

8624000	8626000	outside of the box for you I know this is
8626000	8628000	not a retro game or inspired
8628000	8630000	by you know other stuff but I'm telling you

8686000	8688000	cause I procrastinated
8688000	8690000	on something big time I really should have got taken
8690000	8692000	care of a lot sooner but whatever
8692000	8694000	hey you know what life goes on
8694000	8696000	alright
8696000	8698000	there's worse things that could happen in the world

8700000	8702000	we got a couple more stories for you guys
8702000	8704000	then the listless results
8704000	8706000	and then the skype line
8706000	8708000	and listless by the way I will say this about listless
8708000	8710000	this doesn't happen very often in listless
8710000	8712000	but every single answer
8712000	8714000	tonight got at least one vote
8714000	8716000	every single answer usually something gets shut out
8716000	8718000	but it's going to be a close one tonight
8718000	8720000	so hopefully you guys all voted if not
8720000	8722000	you got like 30 seconds left
8722000	8724000	loki what do you got for us
8724000	8726000	while we wrap these up stop playing that game
8726000	8728000	what are you playing now
8728000	8730000	yes you are you're playing that freaking
8730000	8732000	contra in castlevania meet
8732000	8734000	super mario brothers and all that crap
8734000	8736000	alright
8736000	8738000	well this is appropriate I guess
8738000	8740000	or not I don't know
8740000	8742000	it's of course you know a parody game
8742000	8744000	and only in
8744000	8746000	japan of course created by
8746000	8748000	joe jin circle studio
8748000	8750000	s super strip
8750000	8752000	fighter 4 is a
8752000	8754000	18 and up parody fighting
8754000	8756000	game with 15 brawlers
8756000	8758000	and skimpy outfits and apparently
8758000	8760000	there's also one big fat geek dude in there as well
8760000	8762000	and um
8762000	8764000	I guess it has parodies of
8764000	8766000	fighters from king of fighters
8766000	8768000	tekken virtual fighter
8768000	8770000	street fighter you name it and of course
8770000	8772000	um each character
8772000	8774000	has their own special abilities
8774000	8776000	for example rana
8776000	8778000	who is covered in massage oil which she uses
8778000	8780000	to rub on herself on the
8780000	8782000	other fighters and uh
8782000	8784000	slip past their punches
8784000	8786000	um or they have um some other people
8786000	8788000	who throw vibrators
8788000	8790000	and what not but it's um
8790000	8792000	a game where they basically get
8792000	8794000	uh
8794000	8796000	they get uh
8796000	8798000	their clothes ripped off as they're fighting
8798000	8800000	so awesome
8800000	8802000	only playable
8802000	8804000	in japan I'm afraid
8804000	8806000	oh what a big surprise
8806000	8808000	a game like that is never going to come out here
8808000	8810000	what a shock
8810000	8812000	but they have some screenshots and it's uh
8812000	8814000	interesting I guess
8814000	8816000	amaze satsuma in our chat room says
8816000	8818000	super strip fighter isn't that called
8818000	8820000	dead or alive
8820000	8822000	ba dum bum ba dum bum merrimay is a comedian here at
8822000	8824000	olr
8824000	8826000	orange lounge radio of course as you know started
8826000	8828000	about a little game called
8828000	8830000	adr and the other types of music games that were out there
8830000	8832000	in a series called bamani
8832000	8834000	well guess what the bamani series is still alive
8834000	8836000	so we want to take our last story
8836000	8838000	tonight to show you guys
8838000	8840000	one of the new bamani series
8840000	8842000	that's coming out well we're not going to show you because it's a radio show
8842000	8844000	but we're going to talk about it it's called reflect
8844000	8846000	beat that's right a brand new game of the bamani
8846000	8848000	series called reflect beat is apparently
8848000	8850000	location testing
8850000	8852000	what is going on here it's a
8852000	8854000	multi touch space touch screen
8854000	8856000	I guess up to five simultaneous
8856000	8858000	touches will register on the screen it's a two player
8858000	8860000	player game it's two machines
8860000	8862000	linked together if there's no second player you can play
8862000	8864000	against the CPU it's made
8864000	8866000	at a wide screen and what happens is that
8866000	8868000	player one has a red colored bar across the bottom
8868000	8870000	of the screen and player two has a blue colored bar
8870000	8872000	across the bottom of their screen and what happens
8872000	8874000	is that at the start of the game the music begins
8874000	8876000	and a ring shaped note appears at the center of the
8876000	8878000	screen the note travels from the center to
8878000	8880000	the player's bottom bar the
8880000	8882000	player touches the bottom bar when
8882000	8884000	and where ever the note
8884000	8886000	meets the bar to the beat of the music
8886000	8888000	if you hit it then it changes
8888000	8890000	to the color of the player and bounces right
8890000	8892000	back to the opponent the rate
8892000	8894000	at which it will move will depend on the music
8894000	8896000	so if it's a slow BPM then
8896000	8898000	the note will move slowly and so on and so on
8898000	8900000	there's hold notes, chain notes
8900000	8902000	and so forth they say it's also
8902000	8904000	a lot like boom boom rocket
8904000	8906000	if you've ever played that on xbox live with the whole
8906000	8908000	bar and the exploding fireworks
8908000	8910000	some of the songs in the game there's
8910000	8912000	a remix of star mine 7 7
8912000	8914000	a song called
8914000	8916000	juicy I'll leave that to
8916000	8918000	your imagination and silence so on
8918000	8920000	and so on so reflect beat a new
8920000	8922000	game in the bamani series
8922000	8924000	there's even some pictures that are posted around there
8924000	8926000	on the internets so you can see what this game looks
8926000	8928000	like it kinda
8928000	8930000	looks like dj max technica
8930000	8932000	a little bit that's what I was totally thinking
8932000	8934000	when I saw it I was thinking I wonder if
8934000	8936000	I wonder if they're stealing the
8936000	8938000	idea a little bit there isn't that funny how that
8938000	8940000	works out konami steal a music
8940000	8942000	game idea rock revolution

9714000	9716000	annoying that when it
9716000	9718000	walks up
9718000	9720000	are you how do you feel
9720000	9722000	about sims 3 coming to consoles
9722000	9724000	i uh say almost
9724000	9726000	uh j and
9726000	9728000	them kind
9728000	9730000	uh well

9732000	9734000	it's gonna be get
9734000	9736000	dumbed down and
9736000	9738000	which is boo hoo
9738000	9740000	but here's the other thing though
9740000	9742000	is that well uh
9742000	9744000	the uh well
9744000	9746000	and lucky us for us hardcore
9746000	9748000	sims players the new
9748000	9750000	expansions expansion
9750000	9752000	set ambitions
9752000	9754000	will hit
9754000	9756000	the pc before we get sims
9756000	9758000	3 on the console
9758000	9760000	hmm
9760000	9762000	uh yeah because sims 3 on the console is gonna probably
9762000	9764000	be a ways out especially if we're just hearing about it now
9764000	9766000	you know i haven't heard dark soccer talk about sims 3
9766000	9768000	in a long time i've actually been sitting here
9768000	9770000	installing my sims 3 oh it did all the talk
9770000	9772000	about it tonight well no um
9772000	9774000	because what's been going on is because i have
9774000	9776000	a lot of mods in my game
9776000	9778000	i have to completely reinstall
9778000	9780000	and delete my registries
9780000	9782000	so yeah and it decided to fart on me
9782000	9784000	so uh
9784000	9786000	i have a question dark sakura actually
9786000	9788000	how do you um
9788000	9790000	the registry
9790000	9792000	erasing
9792000	9794000	what the hell how do you do that
9794000	9796000	how do you do that
9796000	9798000	since well um
9798000	9800000	because my
9800000	9802000	current problem in sim 3 is that
9802000	9804000	well my school
9804000	9806000	building is borked
9806000	9808000	they can
9808000	9810000	be in the school building for like
9810000	9812000	2 minutes and then
9812000	9814000	they uh
9814000	9816000	it just stops i don't know
9816000	9818000	i have no idea
9818000	9820000	that's something that you're probably gonna have to
9820000	9822000	check on the sims 3 forum for
9822000	9824000	yeah
9824000	9826000	i've never had that problem so i don't
9826000	9828000	know how to help with it
9828000	9830000	what's supposed to be coming in this next sims 3
9830000	9832000	expansion what's the
9832000	9834000	big thing that they're going to do with this
9834000	9836000	uh
9836000	9838000	like they were they are
9838000	9840000	apparently they're gonna make
9840000	9842000	a move that
9842000	9844000	to make
9844000	9846000	make a move on those
9846000	9848000	those players that
9848000	9850000	never leave the sims
9850000	9852000	the sim creator
9852000	9854000	or uh
9854000	9856000	the or the uh
9856000	9858000	like where they
9858000	9860000	just build lots
9860000	9862000	and never play the actual sims game
9862000	9864000	well if they're happy doing
9864000	9866000	that i don't understand why they're gonna ruin
9866000	9868000	that get out and play the game
9868000	9870000	dammit
9870000	9872000	yeah well but
9872000	9874000	it's like never mind really so
9874000	9876000	it's
9876000	9878000	it's interesting though you know there's a lot going on
9878000	9880000	in um i don't wanna
9880000	9882000	compare the sims 3 to wow but i will
9882000	9884000	uh there's a lot going on
9884000	9886000	in wow right now where they're really changing up the game
9886000	9888000	and they're changing it in some big big ways
9888000	9890000	and it's kind of causing the player base to
9890000	9892000	have some rabble rabble although blizzard
9892000	9894000	changes big shit with every patch
9894000	9896000	and everything works out just fine but i guess the big
9896000	9898000	thing that's causing rabble rabble is that
9898000	9900000	now the 10 man and 25 man
9900000	9902000	raids are gonna share the same lockout
9902000	9904000	so if you're in one of those raiding guilds that does 10
9904000	9906000	mans and 25 mans every week you're gonna have to pick
9906000	9908000	one or the other not gonna be able
9908000	9910000	not gonna be able to do both anymore
9910000	9912000	we all have to do different raids or something like that
9912000	9914000	same loot and everything
9914000	9916000	it's gonna be very interesting they're saying oh it's gonna kill 25
9916000	9918000	man raiding so you know
9918000	9920000	big changes to the game but sometimes it works out for the better
9920000	9922000	so in a way and you know i'm relating
9922000	9924000	this back to sims 3 i promise
9924000	9926000	you know if they're gonna change some of the core elements of the game
9926000	9928000	maybe it's just because they kind of
9928000	9930000	see the habits of the players right now and
9930000	9932000	they kind of want to course people into
9932000	9934000	looking at this whole other part of the game that they've
9934000	9936000	developed that nobody's looking at
9936000	9938000	and also
9938000	9940000	a thing that's apparently
9940000	9942000	coming with the new expansion is that
9942000	9944000	there's gonna be apparently
9944000	9946000	natural disasters
9946000	9948000	coming
9948000	9950000	now there you go
9950000	9952000	there
9952000	9954000	we have something really interesting
9954000	9956000	now that kind of reminds me
9956000	9958000	if that would happen
9958000	9960000	because well the
9960000	9962000	optimal would be if they
9962000	9964000	made a
9964000	9966000	well what's the
9966000	9968000	season
9968000	9970000	i think it's actually called
9970000	9972000	the seasons
9972000	9974000	expansion that they made for sims 2
9974000	9976000	since well
9976000	9978000	since i'm like a snow person i would
9978000	9980000	love to have my sims
9980000	9982000	playing in snow
9982000	9984000	but here's the problem
9984000	9986000	is that
9986000	9988000	your cure
9988000	9990000	even though the problem that i would have
9990000	9992000	with that is that my current sims
9992000	9994000	house is
9994000	9996000	not is
9996000	9998000	not exactly a winter
9998000	10000000	house because they would
10000000	10002000	would freeze if so
10002000	10004000	were the case if you have to have walls around
10004000	10006000	everything since i'm like
10006000	10008000	i'm having like one bed here
10008000	10010000	one bed there all the all in the opening
10010000	10012000	i have to say
10012000	10014000	though this expansion where they want to
10014000	10016000	add like natural disasters
10016000	10018000	kind of reminds me of the roots of the sim
10018000	10020000	series which would be sim city
10020000	10022000	which is kind of the game that started it all
10022000	10024000	because remember you could have natural disasters in sim city
10024000	10026000	like your nuclear power plant blowing up
10026000	10028000	or godzilla attacks the city
10028000	10030000	good times
10030000	10032000	indeed good times
10032000	10034000	alright well akiripper we're gonna let you go and
