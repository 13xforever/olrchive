14079	18965	Tonight, May 2nd, 2010, is a six-player 2D Castlevania game on the way?
19366	23651	Bungie signs a new publishing deal, and is yet another sequel to Red Steel on the way?
31368	34230	Enough arguing about the graphics card in our chat room.
34330	35811	Jeez, it's like all these wars.
35871	37052	Can't we all just get along?
37192	37512	Oh, hey!
37992	45177	Hello, my friends, and welcome to episode number 365 of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.
45657	54924	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one, the only, the ultimate, the sometimes friendly, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
56124	56264	Hi.
56865	57625	My headache's gone.
58046	60127	But always ready to make guacamole.
60643	62025	Oh, my guacamole was really good.
77739	78700	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
97149	97689	It can't hurt.
97750	98230	It can only help.
98490	99110	I will say this.
99250	105534	Years and years ago, probably about seven, eight years ago, I used to date someone who is vegan, allegedly.
105995	109857	I used to date someone who is vegan, and he really, really liked to cook.
110437	113239	And I will tell you, and I don't like to cook, so I would eat
113539	114700	I love the food that he made.
136281	144530	Between that and that was at the peak of me playing DDR and doing the tournaments and that was when the Orange Bat stuff happened when the show was born, etc.
144670	145431	I was never thinner.
147609	148450	Now I'm fat.
149210	155835	Well, and the whole thing of it is, you know, I really just stopped and looked at everything that I was consuming.
156375	159458	I was having, you know, a couple of sugar-free Red Bulls a day and coffee.
160218	161419	And I was having trouble sleeping.
161479	162220	Duh!
162300	162900	Gee, I wonder why.
163440	168184	And I was really stressed out from work and from, you know, my school projects and a lot of other stuff I have going on.
168284	172367	So I just decided that it's time that I stop putting this off.
172887	173388	Stop putting this?
175589	179754	Yeah, stop putting this off, and just start, you know, doing something for myself.
180135	189947	And, yeah, and no, it's not like the crazy vegan type of people, like, oh, organic food is the only kind of food you can eat, and all these have drugs in them, and... Meat is water!
190808	191669	Yeah, fuck PETA.
192770	195073	Um, however, however...
196619	201743	I do think that the belief would not be there if there hadn't been some basis for it.
202584	205166	So, I'm doing this for me.
205266	206767	I'm not doing it for the bunnies.
207508	209089	I'm not doing it for the cows.
209690	212732	Although I did find that corn fed cow makes me sick.
212912	213833	Grass fed cow does not.
214741	215882	How strange.
216282	217703	I just never would have thought there was a difference.
217763	222347	Keep in mind they feed cows antibiotics to make them digest corn, because cows are not meant to eat corn.
222627	223268	Neither are humans.
223488	224108	Neither are humans.
226150	227571	Anyhow, I love corn.
228452	228792	Let me go.
229132	230273	I've got to introduce everybody here.
230894	236458	I'm sorry for going off on it, but I have to say right now, my headache has finally gone away.
237867	242689	Let me also introduce the host, voted least likely to go vegetarian of all the OLR hosts.
242709	244550	Say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
244670	245751	I'll never go vegetarian.
245791	246331	That's right.
246391	247791	You have to give up your double downs.
248412	249952	I don't eat the double downs anymore.
249972	253754	It's not worth it, seriously.
253774	257676	It was just experiment to see if it was any good.
257976	262158	I see right through their scam of giving me two pieces of chicken for a lot of money.
262423	266406	Well, tonight I noticed you've gone back to the old standard personal size pizza.
267146	269088	Wrong, it was six parmesan twists.
269648	270349	Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
270609	272170	And it's because those are really delicious.
272350	273031	They are delicious.
273491	274752	But also vegetarian.
277148	283175	No, but not true vegetarian because it's cheese and all that stuff.
283956	285177	Whatever the cheese and egg.
285878	286339	Labia?
286419	286659	What?
288341	290183	Octolavio or something like that.
290263	290624	I don't know.
291385	293427	I haven't researched my vegan terminology yet.
293789	294589	Thanks for watching!
310337	337854	If you're listening to us live, pull up a chair and join us in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com I know we talk a lot about food on this show, but we also talk about games once in a while, it happens, it's been known to happen Actually, tonight is a very busy game news night, so we have lots of game news to get into here in a little bit Also a game tonight, yay, we're gonna do a game, list list is coming up tonight, part B, exciting You guys asked for a game last week, so we're gonna do it tonight We'll tell you the topic in a little while, but first, how was your gaming week?
339312	339872	DarkSakura.
340353	342855	I played more Babylonian Twins, which is pretty fun.
344036	350040	Some Super Street Fighter 4, which Drury is mean and evil and badass.
350421	350981	Totally.
352662	353463	And I played some pinball.
355424	360909	And more Espagaluda too.
361909	363771	That's just kind of fun to say, Espagaluda.
365137	367759	Let's talk more Super Street Fighter 4 because I bought it this week too.
368339	369700	What console did you guys get it on?
370161	370341	We have 360.
370381	370521	Yeah.
370581	372782	I have PS3.
372802	373983	But you guys have the fight stick, right?
374303	374964	Why are you giggling?
375324	375925	Because.
377286	377726	I know why.
378626	378727	Oh.
380007	380468	That's cool.
381148	382910	You guys have the fight stick on 360, right?
383150	383370	Yeah.
383450	384110	Good times.
384471	387293	But we do have some news though about Game Crazy.
387893	388133	Okay.
388694	391996	And I was going to wait until later on in the show but I figured I'd go ahead and say it because I got an email.
392256	397079	Well, I didn't show roll it because I didn't know if you wanted to talk about it or not, but go ahead and take the floor.
397099	400461	I said I was going to wait, but... GameCrazy's gone out of business.
401802	409947	So, instead of my husband having three weeks of work, he's got 13 weeks of work, so that's good, but at the same time, bye-bye GameCrazy.
410668	410848	So...
411914	417236	I know the rumors have been floating around the internet, and I think the stories we've seen on the internet were a rumor, but... It's true.
417396	417736	It's true.
418776	423017	We got confirmation a week ago, so... Well, I'm sorry to hear it.
423037	424018	More like a couple days ago.
424678	427999	But for every door that closes, another opens, blah, blah, blah, blah.
428019	428579	Yada, yada, yada.
428679	429259	It'll be okay.
430800	431240	We're not worried.
431560	432000	I'll put it this way.
432020	432480	We're not worried.
433261	434181	So, it's all good.
434201	434601	We're not worried.
435003	442550	It's just a bummer, though, that an alternative to Baron Von GameStop is now closing.
442850	444472	It seems like they're just dropping like flies.
444512	447434	Did you totally see the GameTrader store that's on Antelope?
448015	448275	What?
448335	449016	And it's more local.
449036	454121	We sell them, yes, and I know they have their logo that's a blatant ripoff of GameStop.
454141	455141	Looks identical to GameStop.
455942	459186	Seriously, the same freaking font.
460147	463651	I don't mean to get local on you guys, but maybe there's like one or two.
464492	466994	There's the guy we met in the line at Target that listens to the show.
467014	468836	So somebody in Sacramento, if he's even still listening.
469197	470518	Some people in Sacramento are listening.
471359	474803	There's also, have you seen that place on Sunrise, Smashburger?
475183	476444	Yes, that too!
477144	481365	Same font, same white and red color and everything, but it's a burger joint.
481486	484387	The font is not a condensed font.
484427	485087	Close.
486147	490889	It's different enough that they can't... You're weird.
491449	493130	I know, I noticed this stuff.
493590	497892	By the way, I'm going to take a picture and put it on the site, but this is the newspaper that I did.
498312	500173	Nice.
500233	501613	Oh, it's all actually printed on paper.
501633	502954	Exactly, so I'm going to take a picture of it.
504395	505676	It's like I can get all my Jewish news.
506256	507437	Well, it was for a fundraiser.
508037	510639	The temple that I go to had a big fundraiser called All That Jazz.
510719	512160	Yeah, you were plugging in on the show a couple weeks ago.
512180	513661	They wanted a newspaper to distribute.
513701	515222	No OLR fans at the show?
516462	516963	I didn't go.
519304	520705	You know why I didn't go, Rob?
521486	524608	Because guess who was sitting her happy butt here in this chair doing OLR?
524728	525328	I'm sorry.
525348	525828	That was me.
526029	526369	All right.
528405	531268	Anyhow, by the way, there are some alternatives.
531468	532609	There's what, the Game Trader?
532649	533190	Is that what they're called?
533210	534551	Game Trader or Trater?
534951	535952	Trader.
536213	538535	There's also that Fair Game.
538595	539336	Now I know the guys there.
539676	541618	The guys at Fair Game are rad.
541838	542739	Aren't they expanding?
542759	546683	Because there's the one over on Fair Oaks, and then there's one right by my house in Rosemont.
546823	547443	X-Box Repairs Quote
573648	575590	Let me go to chat, chat.orange.com.
575630	579094	Ranma says, with GameCrazy going out of business, we only have GameStop left.
579114	580535	There's a lawsuit in there somewhere.
580575	580996	Monopoly?
581336	584560	Trust me, there's people that want to make game stores all the time.
584760	590946	And just like how Blockbuster closing a bunch of stores and Hollywood closing a bunch of stores.
590986	594570	Well, Hollywood's definitely going to be closing a lot of stores and same with movie gallery and stuff.
594970	599252	How that has sparked the independent video growth.
600412	605434	Now you're going to see the independent game store growth go up a little bit.
606095	607475	I mean, game crazies are out there.
607515	611937	Definitely not out there as heavily as, say, GameStop right now.
612037	614298	But there's always alternatives.
614338	615919	You just have to kind of search them out.
616279	620721	You're also forgetting GameStop's biggest competitor in some ways is Walmart.
621861	624662	Target, Best Buy.
624702	626403	Those are all big, big game retailers.
626443	629464	Now, as far as the used game market goes, I don't know.
629804	632165	But you always hear rumors about those companies maybe wanting to get into it.
632626	633046	I don't know.
633426	641269	But it's just sad when more stores like this close, especially when it affects people we know very, very well and so forth.
642050	645031	Anyhow, I hope things go okay in that situation.
645491	647872	Let us know if there's going to be any good sales at least, whatever it is.
648212	650914	Silver lining we can find in this tragic news.
651315	652756	They are in the middle of liquidation.
652776	656338	You know what they say, when life hands you lemons... Throw them back?
656939	666807	Throw them against the wall, stomp on them, squish them, say I don't wanna... I like how Ron White puts it, to quote, When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.
667487	675754	Or, when life gives you lemons, find someone who gives potatoes and makes some lemon vodka or something.
675774	675834	Tom.
679219	679820	I said it wrong.
680160	680801	Worst quote.
681322	682042	I said it wrong.
682062	687068	It's like, no, when life gives you lemons, make lemonades and then go find someone whose life gave them vodka.
687628	687969	All right.
689530	692033	Loki, how was your gaming week?
692333	694576	I didn't even remember if we were still talking about that or not.
694596	694816	Oh, yeah.
694896	698420	Once in a while we talk about video games amongst the guacamole and the vodka.
698460	698660	Yeah.
698700	700462	And Ron White quotes gone horribly wrong.
700482	700602	Yeah.
701949	704110	Yeah, I played a few things this week.
704690	709112	I tried out some of the upcoming Xbox Live Arcade games.
709212	715935	I mean, not anything I was really impressed with because they're just like ports of old arcade games or semi-recent arcade games, I guess.
716836	719817	Racestorm HD, kind of cool.
720077	724580	I actually have Racestorm on my arcade cabinet at home, so...
725680	729423	Honestly, it's just slightly crisper graphics, and that's it.
729603	732005	But otherwise, it plays pretty much exactly the same.
732966	737390	And then, Neo Geo Battle Coliseum was okay.
737410	746937	I actually never played that in the arcade, and it was kind of neat to be able to play as one of the characters from Metal Slug in a fighting game, because he uses his gun a lot.
747518	749620	But it was pretty cool.
750040	751281	So that should be coming out hopefully soon.
751401	752362	I know Raystorm, I think...
752702	754523	We have it in the show role, I think, later on.
754963	756664	So that's also coming soon.
757825	758525	Then other things.
760646	761587	Play more Grand Theft Auto.
762067	763748	Still trying to dominate that.
764488	774314	And played against one guy today who thought... I love these people that I play against that think they're so good and going to teach me a lesson and stuff.
774534	776575	And then I get like a thousand... Did they tell you that?
776595	777035	Oh, yeah.
777055	778316	I'm going to teach you a lesson.
778416	779116	No, no, seriously.
779156	779617	They're like...
780457	782319	Oh, you better remember that!
782919	790344	Yes, you better remember that you got a lucky kill on me after I chased you down through the entire damn city trying to kill you, even though I was $1,500 ahead.
790744	793166	Oh yes, you're so cool that you got one kill on me.
794026	796988	I guess that totally negates those other 15 I got on you.
797769	800431	You will remember that as the one kill they got on you all day.
800451	801071	I think he quit.
801712	801932	Loser.
803312	823384	and then I actually went back to playing a little bit more free mode because it is damn hard to get a ranked deathmatch game nowadays especially in the Battle of the Gay Tonys so free mode has actually been pretty fun we've been running across a bunch of strange people on there so definitely a good time waster
824464	837412	Um, other non-Grand Theft Auto related stuff, played some Marvel vs. Capcom 2 on my arcade cabinet, because, uh, you know, very excited about the sequel coming out, so, gotta get some of that in.
838933	842015	Hopefully have the serve bot back, because that's an awesome character to play as.
842575	850560	And then, um, I think, I think that's it for right now, because I know I've been playing a lot of stuff, but I just can't remember all of it.
851331	878723	Alright, well last week I didn't play a whole lot of games So you guys would be very proud of me that I made up for lost time this week I played Super Street Fighter 4 I bought it on PS3 because as I mentioned on the show a couple weeks ago I don't think I play enough Street Fighter to really justify the arcade stick purchase But I am a fan enough of Street Fighter where I want to buy the upgraded version of Street Fighter So I bought it on PS3 because I've decided I'm declaring war on that D-pad on the 360 And I'm not...
881104	889330	I don't know why it's taking them so long.
890190	894053	So the PlayStation 3... Then what's frustrating is they did at one time.
894153	897275	Remember in Europe they had the green one and they fixed the D-pad apparently.
897595	897835	I know.
898676	902098	Why would you... Maybe they're waiting for Natal or something.
902178	902539	I don't know.
902719	903859	No, they're not waiting for anything.
903960	905801	Why would you fix the problem and go, oh!
907256	907777	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
926278	927679	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
954702	955623	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
983577	986280	But I will tell you who I love is Guy.
986580	987701	Oh, I love Guy.
987721	989083	That's my favorite character to play.
989503	990364	He's just fun.
990404	993928	And I like how every parting shot of him is his butt.
995229	997211	They have this thing with butts in Super Street Fighter 4.
997251	997832	Have you noticed?
998312	1000014	No, I mean, surprise, no.
1000194	1005319	I just really like playing as him because he can fly across the screen and do all these cheap kick moves that I love.
1005619	1006120	I love Guy.
1006260	1006901	Did you play Cody?
1007681	1009083	and DarkSakura.com.
1026221	1026841	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1045513	1048696	I have to tell you, though, this is a huge accomplishment for me.
1048917	1052900	I was playing matches online, ranked matches, and winning some.
1053081	1056404	Like, that's huge for me, because I don't think I ever won a single one on 360.
1057305	1061229	But I won my first match on PS3, and I'm not winning them all, but I'm winning some.
1062029	1068436	I gotta say, the skill match I'm getting is actually pretty good, because I will play a guy...
1069076	1085582	and go for like five rounds if the game is configured that way and you know win narrowly and there will be like another guy I was fighting back and forth we just kept coming up against each other in ranked matches and he won half and I won half like it's actually really matching me up pretty well so I gotta I gotta say that
1086863	1102657	TigerClaw in chat says oh here's another thing guys if you play as Guy or Cody in the car smasher bonus stage you get the oh my car easter egg oh I thought that was normal cause the first time I ever played that bonus stage was with Guy and I just thought that was what was supposed to happen but that makes sense cause that happens in Final Fight too
1103397	1110923	Speaking of Final Fight, Alan and I decided just for the hell of it we would play through all of Final Fight Double Impact version, the Final Fight game.
1111383	1113825	And so we played through the whole game the other night.
1113845	1115747	It doesn't take that long, maybe an hour at most.
1115847	1117068	So that was kind of fun to play.
1117668	1118529	And so we went through that.
1118789	1126715	And the other big, big event in my world is that I finally said I can't take it anymore with my old graphics card anymore.
1126915	1127155	DRAGON AGE
1147106	1155374	I bought Dragon Age during the Christmas sale when it was only like $30, but I was really having a hard time playing it because my old video card just couldn't handle it.
1155434	1160919	And for those of you that are asking, I originally had an ATI Radeon 33.
1162240	1166863	I got an ATI Radeon 5770 and there was a lot of drama trying to get the card installed because...
1188656	1189457	Bless Alan's heart.
1189517	1190998	He knows how to do all that stuff.
1191278	1199344	I could probably figure it out, but this thing would have confused the hell out of me because this graphic card takes up two slots.
1199504	1203667	It's so big and has this gigantic fan on it, and that would have confused me.
1204167	1212633	And then we had to actually go upgrade the power supply because it needs its own power source, and it can't run on the old power supply I had.
1212973	1216876	So yeah, thank God he knew how to recognize all this stuff because I would have just been lost and cried.
1217176	1219978	You might have been able to get away with the old power supply if you had the converter for it.
1221378	1222439	We just got a new supply.
1222459	1225701	It was like $30, and now it's like 600 watts as opposed to 300.
1225761	1226762	So it works great.
1227082	1227622	Oh, 300, yeah.
1228002	1228623	Yeah, yeah.
1229083	1231945	So, yeah, no, the card works great, and I was able to play Dragon Age.
1231965	1233165	So I was playing that for a couple hours.
1233986	1237608	Did a little bit of the Warrior Human beginning because Alan wanted to show me some stuff there.
1238148	1242971	And I was playing the Mage opening a little bit earlier today, which played so much better.
1243411	1244212	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1273251	1285637	it's not a bad deal for Guild Wars because Guild Wars is one of those games you don't pay a monthly fee for it so I can buy it now and if I have the itch to play it in like six months I can just say oh I'll just fire up Guild Wars did you overclock your graphics card once you got it?
1286177	1291200	I don't think he did that no oh you should it's simple and it's extra oomph
1292120	1293261	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1316895	1318476	So I didn't really play it enough.
1318596	1321678	I mean, both Dragon Age and Guild Wars I only spent a couple hours with.
1322198	1328002	But it's fun to be able to play PC games again and not have my computer crying out in pain from it.
1328362	1339029	And what's also exciting, and I just realized on the drive over here, is that between that new card, my quad core, my 8 gigs of RAM, I ain't going to have a problem playing Final Fantasy XIV on my PC.
1340910	1342571	So, waiting for that beta test.
1344957	1351979	I need to upgrade my graphics cards because I have two of them running in SLI, but they're like 8800 Radeon GTS 512s.
1352080	1353140	Do you want my old card?
1353280	1353700	No, no.
1353720	1356341	I have a power supply and an old video card.
1356361	1357882	My card's way better than that.
1359142	1365644	It's just a lot of stuff, like if I were to go back and do it again, a lot of these games don't run SLI and it's really disappointing.
1365864	1368245	And I guess you don't really get that much benefit from it nowadays.
1368805	1368965	But...
1370826	1371126	I don't know.
1371146	1373007	I've got two slots to put graphics cards.
1373068	1375049	I almost feel obligated to get two more.
1377170	1379992	Brad from PodCulture in chat says, Sky, I didn't know it was on sale.
1380032	1380952	You just sold me on it.
1380972	1381372	There you go.
1382013	1384814	When you write NCSoft, put As Heard on OLR.
1386696	1387236	No, but that's great.
1387296	1392139	No, but I think the logic is fine because $20 for the three-game series and no monthly fee.
1392299	1393660	I mean, that's a pretty darn good deal.
1393700	1395281	And Guild Wars isn't a bad game by any means.
1396382	1406915	I don't think you'll play it forever, but I think you'll kind of go, you know, it's one of those games that would be like, you know, I'm kind of bored of WoW and Star Trek and Final Fantasy and all the other MMOs I'm playing right now.
1406935	1408937	Let me just fire up Guild Wars for the hell.
1408997	1410579	What the hell's going on in Guild Wars these days?
1410920	1412342	That's kind of how I've found it.
1412462	1414064	I've played it on and off for the past five years.
1414775	1416276	All right, anyhow, enough of our gaming weeks.
1416677	1419079	Let's move on and get into some housekeeping tonight.
1419439	1422842	I don't have a lot except for I might not be here Memorial Day weekend.
1423343	1433012	It looks like I might be taking a trip, so we might not have a show then, or I don't know if we'll do a pre-taped or something, but that's the first time I'm also telling Jamie and Loki because I didn't think of it earlier.
1434933	1435273	When?
1435854	1436614	Memorial Day weekend.
1437115	1437655	Oh, that's right.
1437675	1438375	Three-day weekend.
1438415	1441778	So if you guys want to get away, I'm planning a trip, it looks like.
1441878	1443018	So I probably won't be here.
1443579	1444039	Have fun.
1444159	1444499	We'll see.
1445400	1445720	We'll see.
1446120	1449282	It's not going to be an extravagant trip, but just a little getaway.
1449823	1450303	A little getaway.
1451624	1455386	Anyhow, more to come on that in the upcoming weeks, though.
1455666	1457147	We'll let you know for sure what's going to happen.
1457227	1462149	That's Memorial Day weekend, which I imagine a lot of our listeners, a lot of them are probably going out of town and what have you, too.
1462729	1469612	Anyhow, also our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and our Facebook, of course, is available, too, at Orange Lounge Radio.
1469672	1470193	Join us there.
1470313	1470753	Friend us.
1471433	1472254	Like our posts.
1472334	1472774	Share us.
1472854	1475255	Help us spread the word because we don't really have advertising dollars.
1475615	1479457	Another place where we could really use help, iTunes and five-star reviews on iTunes are
1479677	1483841	Just look up Orange Lounge Radio in the iTunes store and say a couple nice words about Orange Lounge Radio.
1483861	1485202	We really appreciate it.
1485242	1491968	It really does go a long way because the more positive reviews you get, the higher you go up in the rankings and you get a little more visibility and it works.
1492228	1496972	That's why a lot of podcasts you listen to want to get the reviews in iTunes because sometimes it's hard to stand out amongst the crowd.
1497333	1499395	And I'll tell you what, it's tough when you have, you know,
1499935	1511359	and IG4 and IGN and GameSpot and all these companies with limitless amounts of dollars and budget to pour into advertising and get people and so forth.
1511599	1515680	It's sometimes hard to stand out amongst that, so we rely on the OL Army to help us out.
1516300	1518281	All right, let's actually get into some gaming news.
1518361	1523702	We'll have to actually put down the guacamole for a little bit, step away from the vegetables and get into some actual gaming news.
1524263	1525223	Loki, start us off tonight.
1525623	1526283	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2
1553962	1554082	Uh-oh.
1554102	1554202	Uh-oh.
1566570	1568471	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1591747	1597471	Go to Quick Launch and choose the trial game of choice to play it as a full version.
1597731	1606418	Now, this doesn't work on all games yet, and there's really just a small list that they have so far that it works with, but, I mean, hey, might as well try it on whatever.
1607118	1622292	some of the games that have been shown to work with it so far Fatal Fury Special, Metal Slug 3, Samurai Shodown 2 and Metal Slug 7 all those of course being published by SNK so maybe other SNK games might work as well
1625270	1634804	Let's see, apparently also there might be the King of Fighters 98 Ultimate Match and Garou, Mark of Wolves might play on it.
1634844	1636286	Okay, break this down for me.
1636406	1640732	How smart do I have to be with my hacking, cracking sense to get this to work?
1641533	1642393	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1671599	1673600	This is a huge flop.
1673720	1675701	And you can earn achievements on those games as well.
1676582	1677963	Oh my gosh.
1678063	1682045	I would imagine it's going to get patched out at some point, but might as well enjoy it while it lasts.
1682065	1687107	We need to introduce something new here on Orange Lounge Radio called the Dup Factor.
1687248	1689109	That's right, the Dup Factor.
1693308	1696969	and the Dup Factor would be Days Until the Patch.
1697950	1699750	D-U-P, Days Until Patch.
1700331	1702932	Loki, what do you believe is the Dup Factor?
1704292	1709694	I'm not sure because I don't think this is... This hasn't been published on major blog sites or anything like that.
1710014	1713436	Usually when it does hit those... Good thing no one listens to this show.
1713456	1714096	Yeah, it's a good thing.
1714736	1742923	you know once that happens they'll be like because obviously Microsoft doesn't read every forum out there so it's hard to say but yeah so that's interesting and if you don't happen to have Mario Warfare 2 that's okay because there's other glitches that also involve the 9199 dashboard as well a couple of the games were also found to be working as full Xbox Live Arcade games as well
1744103	1745164	Thanks for watching!
1771175	1785895	and apparently Family Game Night has something else that works like that as well but I'm not sure what's involved with that one but it's just interesting to see that a lot of these glitches are out there
1786736	1788598	I put the DUP factor at seven days.
1789118	1790960	I say by this time next week, it's out.
1791480	1794283	Because I think the... Let me put it this way, okay?
1794303	1796845	Red alarms are going off at Microsoft as we speak.
1796865	1797526	Let me put it this way.
1798527	1800088	I just found out about it this week.
1800348	1806394	This has been posted for about three weeks now, so... Has anyone... What was the last posting date?
1807134	1807815	The 22nd.
1808556	1809757	So it may already...
1811574	1813216	No, nothing's.
1813656	1816698	No, I think somebody would have said something in that little thread he's looking at if that's the case.
1817379	1821502	Or we would have seen a patch on the dashboard or we would have seen a patch for Call of Duty.
1821683	1822703	But I see seven days.
1824245	1824465	We'll see.
1824778	1825358	All right, we'll see.
1826019	1826279	All right.
1827559	1831541	Now, Loki, I'm sure you would not be taking advantage of a patch like this.
1831601	1833863	Or if you have, it's only for journalistic purposes.
1835023	1835804	I don't really care.
1836644	1840006	And honestly... Yeah, it's just the SNK games, I mean.
1840226	1843587	Well, and dude, I have a JTAG console.
1843747	1844828	I don't need this crap.
1845088	1845808	I mean, seriously.
1847342	1848723	Red Steel 2 Not Doing So Hot
1873505	1879851	Well, they were saying it wasn't doing hot, but that's because they only have data from like, you know, what, 10 days?
1879971	1881373	You know, not that long.
1881761	1885522	Well, apparently the game is going to support the Wii Vitality Sensor.
1886183	1886963	Oh, God.
1887003	1887443	Fail!
1889084	1889604	Right there.
1890004	1890464	Fail.
1890785	1891325	I'm sorry.
1891765	1893426	That's going to be awful.
1893806	1894726	Absolutely awful.
1896007	1896927	What's the point of that?
1897907	1899508	How are you going to control the game now?
1899568	1903269	Because you're going to have... Where are you going to plug the nunchuck into?
1903309	1907991	Unless they're going to come up with some sort of splitter or something like that for the Wii Remote.
1908111	1909752	I can't see how this is going to work.
1912954	1913575	I don't know either.
1913635	1915717	I don't write the news, I just report it, just so you know.
1916358	1916738	Fail.
1917459	1918320	That's all I gotta say.
1918440	1924306	I was looking for a clip of the old school DDR failed noise to play behind that.
1925788	1927269	There was a couple other things I wanted to say about this.
1928791	1930192	It's supposed to, I guess...
1931093	1935455	This is just part of, you know, if you think about it, Red Steel 2 supported the Motion Plus.
1936015	1938877	Red Steel was kind of a launch title for the Wii.
1939337	1945880	It would not be a surprise if this supports the Vitality Sensor because it's just yet another add-on of Nintendo's that Ubisoft is supporting.
1946260	1950602	The only one that Red Steel really didn't get on was the balance board, to be honest.
1952975	1954296	So, there you go.
1954376	1960402	Even though Loki's not a big fan of it, apparently Red Steel 3 with vitality sensors... The vitality sensor is retarded.
1960622	1961202	I'm sorry.
1961362	1963004	It's absolutely retarded.
1963584	1971391	Yeah, it'll be wonderful for the Wii Relax game that comes out and people will buy it because it's like, oh, look, you can relax now, now that Nintendo's helping you.
1971431	1972092	Hold up, hold on.
1972692	1974354	How do you really know yet, though?
1974554	1976996	I mean, all you've really heard about this is a concept.
1977036	1978658	You haven't seen it in motion yet.
1979523	1980404	Maybe it'll be neat.
2004429	2008810	This is someone who gets a blood test twice a year and has her blood pressure checked regularly.
2008910	2010291	Yeah, but is it fun?
2011731	2013051	If it keeps me alive.
2014072	2015892	Yeah, but I don't consider that fun.
2017132	2022454	I had to have four MRIs a couple years ago to keep me alive, but I wasn't exactly like, gosh, I wish I had one of these at home.
2022774	2023294	It's a lot of fun.
2023314	2024574	It's like a colonoscopy.
2024754	2027495	Oh, well, that helps you stay alive, but I don't think it's fun.
2027515	2028435	Some people get off on that.
2028795	2030496	The Wii virtual colon sensor.
2034136	2036901	Thanks God for when the Human Centipede video game comes out.
2037522	2046359	I'm just saying though that fun aside, they'll be illegitimate.
2047802	2054946	And they did say there was like a subtitle at least on the human centipede that it makes it seem like it's going to be one of a series.
2055026	2061989	So I'm like... That discussion on that movie has gotten far too much airtime on the All News Network.
2062530	2065851	Let's move on to some more video game stories.
2066011	2068012	I was actually putting something up for you, Rob.
2068253	2068633	What's that?
2069193	2069833	Come and look at it.
2070033	2070754	I can't even see it.
2070814	2072095	I'm going to link it to the chat room too.
2072115	2072675	Is that Gaia?
2073155	2079017	Yes it is, but so they put up an item called Starmony that's a little rainbow unicorn that says open your eyes.
2080638	2082878	Loki's the rainbow unicorn fan, not me.
2083358	2085799	Who's the one that always play in the rainbow unicorn game?
2085999	2086580	That would be Loki.
2086600	2087480	That would be Loki.
2087840	2089100	You need to put that on his wall.
2089421	2091521	I'm going to post it on my Facebook later.
2092161	2093222	But I thought it was funny.
2093422	2093662	Anyway.
2095057	2096038	So, how about a story?
2096659	2098241	How about something about Guitar Hero?
2112797	2116699	I guess, but aren't most of their songs in, like, rock band or guitar here already?
2117199	2120901	Like, I think, isn't the whole Blood Sugar Sex Magic album on rock band, right?
2121561	2127864	I think that it's supposed to also have an exclusive for their new album.
2129225	2129345	Oh.
2130560	2137647	That's at least the speculation, but then again, you can get the whole thing of Blood Sugar Sex Magic on Rock Band.
2139068	2141991	But I mean, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were much more than one album.
2142031	2142592	I mean, they are...
2145069	2148071	I've been listening to their stuff since George Clinton produced them.
2148991	2151733	You know, P-Funk, Parliament.
2152374	2153674	They gotta be like in their 50s by now, right?
2153694	2154675	Multicolored Dreads.
2155055	2155315	No.
2155676	2156376	They're getting there.
2156696	2157837	They gotta be older.
2158057	2159778	They gotta... I think the...
2160819	2163620	Red Hot Chili Peppers is far more expansive than Green Day.
2191420	2197025	I agree to an extent, yeah.
2197045	2199508	I think it's a good choice for their own video game.
2199888	2201149	I would look at it.
2201430	2208456	I don't know if I'd pay $50 for it, but I'd look at it and I'd go, oh, neat, I like these songs.
2209297	2209918	We'll see, though.
2210038	2210358	I don't know.
2211179	2214482	See, but then there's that part of me that goes, I don't know, Guitar Hero Van Halen was kind of poop.
2215720	2218842	Yeah, they're better off sticking with Rock Band.
2219562	2221663	Just putting out more content for Rock Band.
2222964	2223344	We'll see.
2224885	2228767	Well, I'm just like, because I thought they were supposed to be cutting back.
2229087	2233049	Well, I guess they sort of have cut back on Guitar Hero a little bit because we haven't had a game in like six months.
2233589	2234830	Well, not six months, four months.
2235170	2235711	Yeah, six months.
2236711	2237872	Is that counting like DS versions and all that?
2237892	2238372	No, no, I take them back.
2238452	2238832	I'm sorry.
2238892	2240053	I take them back about four months.
2241744	2243765	And yes, it does count DS versions and whatnot.
2244726	2250129	And nothing I've seen on the horizon yet until like fall, which is good.
2251970	2254291	So here's a rumor that's kind of interesting.
2255332	2262516	We may have talked about it a little bit before when it was discovered as a trademark from Konami, Harmony of Despair.
2262936	2266418	Well, a trusted source, as Joystick puts it,
2267078	2273780	It says that Harmony of Despair is a 2D, 6-player, Xbox Live Arcade game.
2273920	2278661	You'll get to play as some of the old characters, or I guess main characters from a bunch of different games.
2279081	2286463	And it's supposed to kind of appear like the Game Boy Advance or DS versions of the game.
2286483	2289404	So I guess like, you know, Super NES type thing.
2290124	2298468	and you'll get to play with a bunch of people at the same time and they'll actually be able to zoom out to show where everyone's at and stuff like that.
2298508	2301549	So six player co-op Castlevania sounds kind of fun actually.
2301909	2304750	I feel like God has finally listened to me.
2305291	2306031	Thank you.
2306491	2307712	Thank you Jesus.
2308732	2311974	This is what I've been asking for for how long now on this program.
2312314	2323620	Give me a old school 2D New Castlevania game on my television and this sounds sweet that it's going to be like six players zooming in and out co-op stuff sounds kind of rad actually.
2324040	2325441	Sounds way better than Judgment.
2325461	2332145	And then when you're done with this Nintendo give us a new Metroid like this and then when you're done with this Konami you can come back and give me a new Contra like this.
2333426	2334246	No Frogger.
2334606	2337568	Do not want Frogger with six people.
2339744	2341265	Unless it's an extreme frogger.
2342265	2344426	I gotta admit though, this sounds very awesome.
2344446	2347887	Can you imagine being able to explore the castle with multiple people at the same time?
2348147	2348868	But how would that work?
2348908	2356811	Because there's gonna have to be some type of random castle generator element to it or something or else it's always gonna be the same damn game.
2358612	2362214	Obviously, this is a very early type of story, and it's also rumor, right?
2362274	2362815	It's not confirmed.
2362835	2368779	Yeah, it's rumor right now, but maybe they're going to have multiple castles or something like that, or you'll be able to download extra castles later.
2368799	2369960	God, I hope it's at E3.
2370360	2372081	I really want more information on this soon.
2372642	2373302	It sounds great.
2374883	2377725	Or maybe that partner net site will leak everything like it always does.
2377745	2378566	That would be wonderful, too.
2379011	2379852	We'll see you next time.
2391687	2394028	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2416212	2422082	AmazeSatsuma in our chatroom chat.orangehauntradio.com says, I'd be fine with a six-player Frogger if I could play as a truck.
2423724	2424786	That would be awesome.
2424826	2425868	I want to play as a gator.
2426008	2427350	That's like Frogger versus.
2428352	2430234	Remember in Pac-Man versus you could be the ghost?
2432381	2434163	That would be amazingly fun.
2434804	2438909	Total side note, but it's not on our show roll, but I think this chat room comment is worth reading.
2438969	2442673	Spyro in our chat says, is there no more game room games being released now?
2443014	2446378	You know, they were supposed to put out like Pitfall and...
2448480	2475462	Super Breakout I think were some of the big games this week and it got halted the release just didn't end up happening and there was actually a tweet over on god I can't believe I'm using Twitter but the thing is Game Room did not have much of a good website behind it I mean I guess they have an official website but it kind of sucks they don't have the greatest web presence I don't know this thing was kind of set up to fail from the beginning but on their Twitter which is at Live Game Room they say
2476844	2481371	First off, they broke the news by retweeting Major Nelson.
2482679	2485681	That's awesome.
2487242	2489784	Professional radio.
2490044	2497169	They broke the news by retweeting Major Nelson saying, We're working to bring you additional Game Room titles as soon as possible.
2497249	2499510	I'll let you know the moment I have more details.
2500191	2505995	And then they sent an app message to somebody saying, There was a delay in the game pack release.
2506115	2507696	We'll update when we've got more details.
2507796	2508136	That's it.
2509177	2510638	So, I mean, fail.
2510898	2511899	Fail, fail, fail.
2513099	2531670	I kind of regret a couple weeks ago when I was reviewing Game Room on the show I said hey this is going to be better than Virtual Console because at least you know although it has plenty of room for improvement it's more than just straight up ports of the games well I mean at least games are coming out for Virtual Console
2533075	2545182	It irritates me because there was so much potential here that they have just crashed and burned with.
2545722	2547143	It's so frustrating.
2547463	2549624	This is an awesome idea.
2550304	2562571	Well, they should have integrated it with different Xbox Live Arcade games, so it wouldn't matter that they're not putting out any because you could still use your Xbox Live Arcade games and have them in your arcade and whatnot.
2563942	2564964	And then here's the thing.
2565404	2571353	SSJ100Matt says, Seriously, Game Room was supposed to be Microsoft's answer to Home, but it's just as much of a failure as Home.
2571413	2572275	So far, that is.
2574157	2576901	I don't know if I'm okay with the Game Room to Home comparisons.
2577422	2579405	I think people assumed...
2580046	2585910	It was going to be like home because you would be able to navigate around in the first person, which was, I don't think, ever the case.
2586010	2590373	I think Microsoft's always kind of strung you along with the, well, maybe we'll implement that someday.
2590673	2594055	Dude, you can't even fucking release a new pack for the game on time.
2594676	2598959	You're not going to have the full first person movement around like home ever.
2599979	2600240	Ever.
2600840	2602021	Prove me wrong, please.
2603931	2620328	I'm just irritated because the problem is if this fails which it's starting to look more and more like it's going to and how fucking disappointing is that that we're never going to get any more packs for this game at the rate we're going you know whatever happened to like the thousand games if this thing fails we're not going to see anything like it
2621249	2622950	until maybe the next generation.
2623330	2623730	Maybe.
2625130	2636654	Maybe on Nintendo's Wii HD or whatever console they do after the Wii, maybe they will finally say, okay, you can play the old NES games over the internet after you re-buy them for five bucks a piece.
2638835	2639775	Just irritates me.
2641436	2641976	I am mad.
2643766	2644066	Anyway.
2645047	2645287	Rob?
2645687	2645867	What?
2646168	2646668	Deep breaths.
2646888	2648369	I know, it's just frustrating.
2648790	2655434	As a retro game fan, you know, I was really excited about a lot that Game Room had to bring, and it didn't really suck.
2655494	2656975	I mean, there was a lot of promise with it.
2657015	2659177	I mean, yeah, they could have had a little more, but...
2661761	2664482	Hopefully I'm just overreacting and this is all fixed in a week.
2664522	2666883	I mean, maybe they had problems with the whole PC.
2666963	2672705	And I heard people were able to hack certain games in Game Room, like a lot of the high scores on Asteroids were faked.
2673105	2675366	So maybe for quality purposes they pulled it back.
2675646	2683749	But when I hear about these layoffs, when I see crappy web support for this, my hope fades more and more.
2684369	2686150	I have a feeling that there's going to be all sorts of...
2687751	2698059	Exploits with it because it's in file form and people have modded consoles and they're gonna hex edit crap so that they can cheat in the games and it's gonna screw up the leaderboards and
2700185	2701706	Prove me wrong, Microsoft, please.
2701906	2702446	Please.
2702666	2704207	I would love to get proven wrong on this.
2704307	2705467	Meanwhile, other news.
2706047	2709208	PlayStation 3, and here's something else to rage about.
2711549	2716691	Of course, we reported a couple weeks ago on the show, and I'm sure you read about it everywhere on the internet, or you saw this firsthand.
2716731	2719992	They took out the other OS feature on the PlayStation 3.
2720612	2721173	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2736009	2736709	Somebody sued.
2736890	2741311	A class action lawsuit for removing the PlayStation 3 support for other OSs.
2741992	2745373	Anthony Ventura is the lawsuit filer's name.
2745513	2746234	The plaintiff.
2747154	2747914	I'm a plaintiff.
2748695	2756358	He filed a class action lawsuit against the company saying that it's a breach of contract, false advertising, and you know all this other big legal words.
2756698	2757679	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
2779216	2783257	I don't know if it'll work, but it's interesting that somebody's actually filed a lawsuit over this.
2784138	2787799	As I suspected somebody probably would in this too happy nation that we're in.
2789219	2789499	I don't know.
2789539	2791160	What do you guys think will happen with this lawsuit?
2791900	2792200	I don't know.
2792220	2795401	It'd be interesting to see how it plays out.
2796622	2802564	I'm interested because I have a system that hasn't been updated yet and I'm not planning on updating it because guess what?
2802584	2806385	I haven't bought any new games for it since LittleBigPlanet.
2807708	2813290	I think the biggest kicker here is are they going to be able to prove that this was an advertised feature?
2813310	2814010	That's going to be tough.
2814190	2816651	And I don't think they're going to be able to get away with it.
2816711	2818172	Maybe in other countries, but not here.
2818232	2819572	I don't remember that being advertised.
2819612	2824274	It's not on a commercial or something, but they did advertise it coming out of E3 and that kind of stuff.
2825294	2828415	And it was a feature, and it's in the console.
2828455	2832397	It's not like, you know, people didn't know it was there, but...
2833257	2835258	I do think it's kind of messed up.
2835699	2840522	It's the whole kind of conspiracy part of it, or I guess paranoia part of it.
2840882	2849929	It's like if they're going to take this out because some hacker or whatever found a way around their copy protection and stuff, which didn't really happen.
2850029	2857514	I don't think anyone's actually found a way around their copy protection yet, other than the fact that they're starting to mess around with Linux, but...
2859147	2859727	I'm surprised they haven't.
2881684	2882024	I don't know.
2882424	2889287	And let's just say, for example, that they decide later on, hey, you know what, we're going to start selling PlayStation 2 games on the PlayStation Network.
2889787	2892348	Now we're going to remove your backwards compatibility so you can buy those games from us.
2893389	2893609	Again.
2895169	2895950	That would be kind of shady.
2896690	2901132	And if you want to play your PlayStation 2 games, you can go buy one of our $99.99 PlayStation 2 Slim systems.
2906260	2909102	But at the same time, let me play devil's advocate for a minute here.
2909282	2912465	Because Ranma says, forget the lawsuit, people.
2912525	2914907	Just trade in your PS3s for something worthwhile.
2915507	2922112	That chat coming from chat.orange.radio.com Well, I mean, to play devil's advocate, you never could install Linux on a 360.
2923193	2924394	You can't even get the web on your 360.
2924434	2924594	I mean...
2927850	2933693	You can now, but... Well, without... Legitimately, none of these features are possible.
2933753	2938195	I mean, you can still get the other OS feature on your PlayStation 3, too, if you know where to look.
2939075	2939295	Right?
2942756	2944377	Well, it's being worked on or something, something.
2945117	2945397	Anyway.
2947497	2948978	Yeah, I guess we'll see what develops with this.
2949018	2955860	It'll be very interesting, though, because you know what happens is that if this guy wins, you'll all be able to get a check in the mail for like five whole dollars.
2956360	2958641	Because that's what happens with class action lawsuits.
2959221	2961142	Or maybe they'll have to give out a free game or something.
2961182	2961562	I don't know.
2961722	2962402	Hey, that'd be nice.
2962842	2966964	Yeah, but I mean, what if that free game is like Yaris 2 for the PS3 or something?
2966984	2969184	You know, it doesn't have to be a good game.
2970185	2970925	Freeze free?
2970945	2971025	Yeah.
2971746	2972206	I don't know.
2973288	2976113	There's some things that you couldn't even pay me to play for free.
2976493	2977495	It's like bad.
2977855	2978797	Anyway, let's move on.
2978837	2979678	More gaming news, DarkSakura.
2979698	2980560	How about something happier?
2980700	2980900	Yes.
2981201	2982002	Happy, happy, joy, joy.
2982022	2982523	Cub Scouts!
2983445	2984206	I thought you said happier.
2984631	2988373	Well, yeah, okay, I know, little Mormons in training.
2988954	2989734	Sorry, I didn't say that.
2990355	2991556	I was in the Cub Scouts for a year.
2992136	2992536	One whole year.
2992856	2996859	I was in the Cub Scouts and the Boy Scouts and I never became a Mormon.
2997639	3001402	In fact, I just learned how to set fire to things and tie knots.
3002182	3003263	I forgot the knots part.
3003683	3006185	Oh, if only they knew I was a gay in training.
3006445	3007366	It's so awesome though.
3007386	3014529	I mean, seriously, if you want to have fun in the Boy Scouts or something like that, just buy the damn manual, give it to your kid, have them read through it.
3014569	3015850	That's all the information you need.
3015870	3018891	The rest is just camping trips and Pinewood Car Derby.
3019111	3020092	That's all it really is.
3022613	3024674	Although we built a catapult one time and that was awesome.
3025962	3029184	I love how DarkSakura's like, I swear to God, I have news to report.
3029204	3032406	Will you boys stop reminiscing about your stupid scout troops?
3033767	3035308	We build wooden cars, just so you know.
3035468	3035909	Anyway, hi.
3036749	3043234	So, for the Cub Scouts, there's a new badge available.
3044074	3047276	Sorry, belt loop, or whatever the crap that means.
3048497	3053120	You can get a video game belt loop, I guess.
3054261	3055202	I don't get a belt loop.
3055962	3058123	I don't remember them having belt loops.
3058143	3059004	I remember the badges.
3059204	3060124	The badges I remember, yeah.
3060144	3062606	They usually get sewed on and then there was the little patches.
3062626	3063846	There were patches and there were badges.
3064266	3065867	So now they have belt loops too, whatever.
3066147	3067028	They get more bling.
3067168	3068609	It was pins back in my day.
3069389	3070410	Yeah, that's what I meant.
3070610	3070830	Pins.
3071010	3071390	Anyway.
3071590	3082936	I remember they would flip the kid upside down and put the pin on when the kid was upside down and then when you actually did whatever, your parents could turn it right side up as if you weren't capable of just doing it yourself.
3083976	3084877	If you did, you'd go to hell.
3087031	3087752	You make John Smith cry.
3099313	3101175	Anyway, I'm going to... Can I tell you a true story?
3101195	3101935	I'm sorry, DarkSakura.
3101955	3103457	I know you have a legitimate gaming story here.
3103777	3104317	Hey, guess what?
3104598	3104818	What?
3105178	3106539	My mother... Carrot.
3107019	3108180	Pulled me out of Cub Scout.
3108200	3109301	She didn't want me going anymore.
3109542	3110342	Because you know why?
3110522	3111043	True story.
3111903	3113505	She didn't like the other kids in my troop.
3113785	3118849	She thought all the other kids in my troop... And ten years later, she told me this.
3119189	3122692	Quote, all the other little kids in your troop were little assholes.
3125294	3125975	I love your mom.
3128228	3150912	And I didn't want you hanging out with those assholes I love your mom So, Rob No offense meant to any scouts who might be listening to the show I'm just saying that, you know, the Roseville troop was a bunch of assholes, allegedly So, the whole way to get this video game belt loop You have to complete three tasks And I think this is actually a really positive thing
3152236	3152796	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3174444	3183336	You earn a pin by completing five of nine tasks, which would be... With your parents, create a plan to buy a video game that is right for your age group.
3183716	3184257	Like, that's hard.
3186145	3203820	compare two game systems and explain the differences between the two and good purchase or use of a game system play a video game with family members in a family tournament teach an adult or friend how to play a video game list at least five tips that would help someone who was learning how to play your favorite video game
3204520	3229689	Play an appropriate video game with a friend for one hour Play a video game that will help practice math, spelling, or other skills that help you in your schoolwork Choose a game you might like to purchase and compare the price at three different stores Decide which one's the best deal Include factors like return policy and warranty And with an adult supervision, install a gaming system
3231378	3243068	um okay I think it's good because it's encouraging you know family time it could be good for parents to demystify video games
3243536	3244857	Yeah, it's not a bad thing.
3244897	3250920	I mean, I know we're sitting here and teeing about it, but yeah, it's encouraging what should be happening in the first place.
3251260	3254882	Parents and kids to talk about the kid's hobby.
3255722	3256282	Who would have thought?
3256382	3261725	When I was a kid, my papa and I, my dad's father, we used to sit around playing Jackal.
3264048	3270299	On Nintendo, on the big screen TV, which is a war game where you shoot people and run over them in a tank.
3271581	3273524	And we played, get this, Abadox.
3274997	3278079	That was supposed to be the most disgusting game at the time.
3278399	3279660	I love Abydox, for the record.
3279980	3288565	I could imagine coming home from a Cub Scout meeting and telling my mom, Hey, Mom, I want to get this video game badge that they're giving away.
3288685	3292607	So would you sit for me for an hour while I install a video game system and show you how to do it?
3292647	3295429	She'd just be like, Where's the paper that I just signed?
3298571	3301533	Well, also, they're...
3306488	3313893	I think that kind of also, you know, sort of discounts the fact that a lot of these parents might have grown up with video games, too.
3314914	3317576	You know, my mom and I used to play Tetris together.
3318957	3321418	And we used to play Super Mario Brothers and all kinds of games.
3321438	3327983	Okay, stop trying to smack the fly with your pizza box.
3328003	3329564	There's a fly on the loose in the studio.
3329584	3330185	Keep in mind.
3330525	3331586	It flew outside, it flew outside.
3332006	3332626	Keep in mind.
3332646	3333047	Stay out.
3333287	3334928	In two days, it will be dead.
3334948	3335028	Dead.
3336417	3337197	Not if I can help it.
3338758	3339459	Won't take that long.
3340019	3341760	Flies really don't live longer than a few days.
3342280	3344761	That's the comfort I take in that they're going to die soon.
3345061	3347422	Tangent Lounge Radio, back to the Cub Scouts, please.
3347442	3347803	I have carrots.
3348863	3349824	They're delicious and raw.
3349884	3350304	Cub Scouts!
3351224	3352065	I said my piece.
3352565	3352645	Oh.
3353810	3356813	Now if they wanted them to really earn the damn badge, they should program a game.
3357393	3358194	I'm very disappointed.
3358214	3359775	Well, that's a programming badge.
3360536	3369843	I'm very disappointed, though, that not one of those little, I guess, achievements or requirements on that list is go to arcade.
3371603	3373145	Well, because there are no arcades anymore.
3373166	3374107	That's a myth!
3374908	3377431	In some parts of the states, there are no arcades.
3377451	3378353	Well, then, you know what?
3378413	3380475	You don't really want that badge now, do you?
3381877	3382278	Here's the thing.
3382298	3387886	The only problem... I don't know if I want to even open this door and go there, but I live there.
3388987	3411649	The only problem I have with this badge, like I think it's a good thing and it's encouraging the family to talk, yada yada yada, is that this badge could go right next to your queer-hating badge because, you know, the Boy Scouts won't, you know the whole thing about how, you know, they won't let gay guys be scoutmasters and so forth because apparently all gay guys know how to do is molest kids.
3412592	3414614	They won't let them be scouts at all.
3414674	3421622	It's just... I think at that age, you're kind of too young to know anyway, so I think that argument's irrelevant.
3421822	3422543	Like, honestly.
3423203	3424965	Like, you know, how old are Boy Scouts?
3425005	3426587	Like, 12 to, like, 15?
3427347	3430411	Like, you just... Here, everything is...
3431412	3432913	It's not even an issue at that age.
3433434	3434936	If it is an issue, you're too young.
3435677	3436918	Don't even think about that stuff.
3437599	3444827	It does kind of irritate me that they don't really have a good reason for justifying why
3445988	3452632	I don't know why homos would want to be involved with such an organization that hates them, but if they do, they should, you know, get to do it.
3452692	3455313	My problem is, why is this even a badge in the first place?
3455333	3475004	Because I thought the Boy Scouts and Cub Scouts and whatever were all about kind of like the whole outdoors, you know, the woodsman, you know, type mentality where it's like learning how to kind of, not really necessarily survive, but there are survival tools in there as well and, you know, kind of, you know, how to be good, you know,
3475524	3476685	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3495894	3496255	VCR, TiVo Badge
3513366	3514827	No, you just have to know how to be a priest Oh
3540827	3542930	And if that joke offended you, guess what?
3543050	3549520	Now you know how offended I get when I hear the rationalization for why gays can't be in Boy Scouts.
3549660	3550442	And there you have it.
3552385	3554328	See, I offended people, but to teach a lesson.
3555805	3556746	Now you know how I feel.
3557266	3557586	All right.
3558547	3559207	It is offensive.
3559448	3559928	Moving on.
3560048	3560709	Release dates.
3562230	3563370	Let's go to the U.S.
3563410	3564892	and see what games are going to be coming out soon.
3565012	3565292	Loki.
3565632	3566172	Not much.
3566353	3572917	This week is pretty light, and it's sad that one of the biggest games this week is actually Iron Man 2.
3572997	3577721	Of course, coming out on Friday in theaters.
3577801	3580002	You've got to have your typical movie-tying game.
3580383	3580903	But don't worry.
3580963	3583725	Sega says that this game isn't crap like the last one.
3585123	3590307	That's famous last words from people that make crappy ported or movie tie-in games.
3591849	3593250	Other fun stuff coming out this week.
3593390	3594671	Picross 3D.
3595332	3598054	It's Picross, but it's in 3D form.
3598654	3600396	And you make nice little cube animals.
3602638	3602718	Um...
3605546	3609689	Total War Battle Pack Total War Battle Pack Total War Battle Pack Total War Battle Pack
3624150	3627833	Dance Sensation, Dementium 2, Cup Scout Badge
3645469	3652014	and also this week the official Xbox 360 USB flash sticks.
3652834	3655956	These are hilarious and I'm laughing at the prices.
3657297	3665743	An 8GB USB flash drive will cost you $39.99 and a 16GB flash drive will run you $69.99.
3666744	3671587	I was just pricing these online because I'm planning on picking up an 8GB and guess what?
3671607	3672708	You can get them for about half the price.
3672928	3674769	So really, thank you Microsoft for
3675129	3681160	still overcharging, it's not going to work as well with a USB stick and that's it for this week
3682475	3683175	Golden Week
3706983	3707224	Is it?
3707524	3707985	Golden Week.
3708045	3710428	It's a big... Like finals and school night?
3710508	3711069	No, no, no, no.
3711189	3718679	It's like, if I remember right, Golden Week is when families go back to their hometowns and visit with people.
3718699	3719840	Like, everything's closed.
3719921	3722304	I just know the 5th of May is Children's Day.
3723765	3725847	Oh, maybe that explains where the holiday comes from in WoW.
3726087	3727748	Because this is Children's Week in WoW right now.
3728269	3730410	Yeah, I totally just made a Warcraft reference.
3730450	3732712	Hey, Nintendo Wii, also nothing this week.
3732772	3733232	Really?
3733272	3734773	No releases until the 13th of May.
3735434	3736795	PlayStation 2, nothing.
3736935	3738116	DS, nothing.
3738976	3740137	PSP, nothing.
3740277	3742199	Nothing is coming out in Japan until the 13th.
3742739	3744080	Okay, by the way, I found it.
3744500	3744800	What's that?
3745420	3749502	Golden Week, it's paid time off on the work days.
3750102	3752783	Some companies completely close down and give their employees time off.
3753144	3756105	It's the longest vacation period of the year for many Japanese jobs.
3756605	3758026	So, yeah.
3758666	3759686	I wish we had that over here.
3759706	3760927	I know, I want Golden Week.
3760967	3762047	How about Golden Arches Week?
3763007	3766288	We have FIFA World Cup Soccer to look forward to when Golden Week's over.
3766308	3774731	It's because there's... It's because there's... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 holidays during that period of time.
3774771	3775031	Wow.
3776351	3778112	Well, we get Cinco de Mayo over here.
3779195	3780755	We don't get it off, do we?
3780775	3785877	I mean, really, I don't think Cinco de Mayo is really like actually an American holiday anyway.
3785917	3789958	It's just one we kind of borrowed from our neighbors to have an excuse to drink.
3789978	3791718	Mexican food potluck day.
3791758	3792418	Exactly.
3793738	3796259	As if work needed another excuse to have a potluck.
3799040	3799400	All right.
3799880	3800660	Let's move on.
3801260	3802080	How about the UK?
3802300	3804721	Is there any holidays in the UK stopping video games this week?
3805721	3805821	No.
3806501	3806942	I don't think so.
3807122	3808562	Why don't they celebrate Cinco de Mayo?
3812866	3822675	Runaway 3 for DS, Runaway A Twist of Fate for PC on the 7th by the way, Sin and Punishment 2 for Wii, and What Did I Do to Deserve This My Lord?
3823195	3827179	Dude, that's awesome that they're getting Sin and Punishment 2 seeing as ours has been delayed.
3827640	3827860	Yeah.
3829181	3831243	But that last one's on PSP and that's really it.
3833140	3841145	Alright, a few more gaming stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week where DarkSakura is going to dig through the vaults and believe me kids, she's digging this week.
3841586	3841886	Loki.
3843087	3862299	You may remember that Microsoft sued Datel over their unofficial max memory memory cards that they had out because they took little micro SD cards and allowed you to use them on the Xbox 360 which now that I think of it, it's kind of funny because
3864941	3869465	They actually... Now that they've opened that up, you don't really need these memory cards.
3869986	3872808	Talk about... Sucking.
3873829	3884398	Anyways, so... To kind of respond to Datel's request, they filed an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft.
3886100	3889383	Pissed off that they weren't kind of playing on even playing ground here.
3890223	3890363	And...
3893764	3895926	I kind of remember this whole back and forth from a couple weeks ago.
3896607	3911940	Yeah, they're basically saying that the claims that by detail that they locked them out with a firmware update and Microsoft has used its status as a platform holder to unlawfully prevent competition.
3912660	3914282	Which I can see that because there's a lot of
3916727	3925333	A lot of first-party products out there, but there's a lot of stuff that you have to get approval from Microsoft to build the release items for those systems.
3925633	3940742	I think that pretty much goes with any other system, but seeing as the Wii and the PlayStation 3 use open storage formats, the SD memory cards and USB memory sticks and stuff like that, now Microsoft...
3942643	3955992	You can see how that would be a problem since they were, prior to the last firmware update, only allowed to use either the hard drive or a memory stick, memory unit from Microsoft.
3957353	3968380	They're saying in Microsoft's motion to dismiss, because they tried to dismiss it, it claimed that the language in the additional terms and conditions clause of the Xbox 360 product warranty, because everybody reads that,
3969201	3988901	um barred the use of unauthorized peripherals and the company backed up its case by citing Apple's I guess successful defense of its right to limit the use of OS X to its own hardware and the court rejected Microsoft's motion to have it dismissed so it will apparently go to trial
3990234	4002103	Although at this point it's like, well, that's great and all, but in the meantime, I'll just pop in my USB memory stick to save my games now.
4002163	4006407	So that's going to be kind of hard to make the case now.
4009520	4009760	Hmm.
4010961	4018565	Well, I mean, do you think this is going to be one of those cases that gets dragged out for years and years, or is it going to get settled pretty quickly?
4019005	4020165	What do you think?
4020426	4022327	Put on your legal expert hat.
4024168	4034373	I think it'll probably get settled because, you know, really, yeah, it sucks that they made these devices and they got pulled from the market really quick.
4035033	4036034	My thing is, though...
4038513	4038933	Thanks for watching!
4055928	4056688	I don't know.
4057729	4058169	It's hard.
4058309	4060531	Yeah, they're not making them.
4060551	4061551	Yeah, well, they're not making them now.
4061611	4069996	But if they were to, say, completely ignore the time when they had just the memory units, now that argument doesn't really hold.
4070937	4073278	But, of course, this took place before that update.
4073438	4077640	But it almost makes you wonder if that update was partially in response to this.
4077861	4078841	But who knows?
4080762	4081562	It just sucks for them.
4081762	4085144	That's an interesting thought because it did seem like that USB thing came out of nowhere, didn't it?
4085324	4105930	I think they were worried that there was going to be some sort of... Because with this, you'll be able to access your files on your memory cards or whatever, and you might be able to cheat or something, like edit your save games or something, which I can tell you right now that wouldn't have stopped them because it's very easy to do that if you have the right tools.
4106110	4108051	Even easier now that they have USB support.
4108131	4108431	It's like...
4110137	4131105	A program in hex editing Alright, we're gonna go ahead and move on We got one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week And that story has to do with something we sort of talked about last week Don't know if you heard, but apparently a leaked GameStop ad has revealed that a black Wii bundle is on its way Who would have thought?
4131425	4132926	I had never heard about this
4133686	4139191	Yes, this black Wii will contain a Wii Mode and Motion Plus and Wii Sports, Wii Sports Resorts, all for $200.
4139511	4144515	However, it's supposed to be coming out May 4th, which differs from an earlier report.
4144796	4150540	But the interesting thing is that, I'm sorry, the ad is not supposed to go up until May 4th, but it got leaked.
4150961	4153142	The debut of the system, I'm sorry, is May 9th.
4153943	4180482	which differs from the earlier report Canada is supposed to get it on May 23rd which is interesting because May 23rd is the date that had originally been reported and my source was not Canadian thank you very much so don't know what happened there but could also be that more is to come because Nintendo has yet to make any official announcement you have to keep in mind all of this is still rumor it's just that now instead of you know some schmo on an internet radio show saying something now there's a picture to prove it it's coming
4180902	4182424	Whereas everybody outside of the U.S.
4182484	4184327	is rolling their eyes and saying move on with it.
4184367	4185688	We already have the Black We here.
4185748	4186710	Well, it's news here.
4187674	4190676	Anyhow, Nintendo is pissed.
4191657	4194798	Okay, they commented actually on what's going on here.
4195059	4196159	Well, no, they didn't comment.
4196219	4199281	They made threats which caused GameStop to comment.
4199742	4200762	Here is an email.
4201843	4207326	I love this because this whole email is about stop leaking stuff and then the email gets leaked.
4207546	4208347	That's my favorite.
4208667	4209087	So here it is.
4209127	4209688	Here's the email.
4210088	4211629	Let me read the email that went out to all the stores.
4213226	4217772	As you know, there is a lot of rumor and speculation about various new products and titles launching this year.
4218333	4219495	One of these is the Black Wii.
4219915	4223640	Various blogs and internet sites are raising awareness about this product.
4224001	4227285	GameStop stores and associates should not proliferate these rumors.
4227726	4229869	Today you received Pop, I guess that's what.
4230069	4230549	P.O.P.
4231050	4231470	What is that?
4233371	4234372	Point of purchase advertising.
4234672	4235052	Whatever.
4235512	4239895	For your windows regarding the Black Wii, somehow a picture of this appeared on the internet.
4240416	4241997	It's just somebody snapped it with their camera phone.
4242017	4242997	I mean, it's not that hard to figure out.
4243317	4247380	Oh, hey, it may seem cool to be in the know and feel compelled to share something like this.
4247800	4249280	Nothing can be further from the truth.
4249460	4255282	All activity like this does is hurt our reputation with publishers and manufacturers and potentially hurts our company.
4255702	4262864	Until Nintendo decides to announce their product, their was capitalized, that's why I shouted it, there should be no discussion of it with customers, period.
4263204	4267725	If they ask, it's not appropriate to comment on speculation and rumors should be the answer.
4267765	4268345	That's dumb.
4268365	4269825	So in other words, you should just confirm it.
4269845	4270846	Just say, I don't know.
4273487	4275028	Here's an excuse that people will believe.
4275608	4276949	Dude, I work at a game store.
4277069	4277509	I don't know.
4278610	4279331	Don't believe that.
4280711	4280932	Anyway.
4280952	4281512	Bitch, please!
4302148	4303610	Well, here's the funny thing about it.
4303650	4303910	Hold on.
4303970	4304310	Oh, sorry.
4304450	4311397	If you didn't want news on this to get out until May 4th, then maybe you should have sent out the materials, I don't know, May 2nd?
4311838	4312719	I mean, come on.
4313159	4319906	If you're going to pay these guys next to nothing, and let's face it, these employees at GameStop don't make enough money to shut up.
4321047	4321347	Right?
4322769	4322969	Yeah.
4323487	4328351	I mean, you shouldn't be telling the whole world that the Black Week's coming out if you don't want people to say things about it.
4328371	4331793	And I love how they put, oh, it hurts our relationship with Nintendo.
4331953	4337317	Yeah, I'm sure Nintendo's going to go, oh, we're not going to ship product to our largest partner.
4337437	4339979	Actually, Loki, actually, Loki, they did make that threat.
4340099	4341420	Apparently, that is the rumor going around.
4341440	4345523	Nintendo did make the threat to pull all of its products from GameStop Stories.
4345543	4347245	You know what I have to say to Nintendo over that?
4347285	4347485	Right.
4347685	4355945	bitch please it would never happen bitch please never happen what other game stores are there?
4359645	4363748	I mean, you're gonna just rely on Walmart and Target and all that for your sales?
4363949	4364649	I mean, come on.
4365110	4368753	Maybe they'll actually send us an actual decent... I mean, that is an empty threat if I've ever heard one.
4368773	4382424	Maybe they'll send us a decent quantity of product then, because we service all the independent guys and they seem to fuck us over all the time, so... I would love to see the big gorilla in the corner GameStop get fucked over once.
4383545	4383945	Ha ha ha!
4384425	4384806	Or twice.
4385126	4387288	Yeah, you're kind of sitting there going, leak more, leak more.
4388328	4389389	It's not going to do anything.
4389429	4390310	Let me put it this way.
4390450	4393092	Game stops leak information all the time.
4393392	4399858	Not only do you leak information all the time, I'm sure that they're the source of a lot of the leaked games that appear on the internet as well.
4402429	4402889	Oh well.
4403209	4405311	Things get leaked.
4405571	4407052	Trust no one.
4407232	4407872	And you know what?
4407892	4409493	These people don't give a shit.
4409693	4411074	Look at the music industry.
4411914	4416957	I mean, CDs get leaked weeks before their release date on the internet.
4417437	4419858	And you know what they say about when something hits the internet, it's done.
4420879	4422620	Everybody's got it now.
4423160	4425241	Once it's been put on the internet, it is not coming off.
4426042	4426362	Period.
4428709	4429090	Anyhow.
4430071	4431412	So yeah, the Black Wii is coming.
4431432	4432053	Big surprise!
4432573	4434656	Five minutes of fame and an eternity on the internet.
4434796	4435336	Well, here's the thing.
4435717	4441603	The only reason why they probably didn't want to leak, and this is a stupid reason anyways, is that's going to hurt the sales of the Wii right now.
4441783	4447510	Because people are like, why the fuck am I going to pay $1.99 for the Wii when I can get the Wii with Wii Sports Resort?
4449202	4450883	for the same price.
4451023	4453104	But retailers are already doing that.
4453365	4459088	We had a story a couple weeks ago about Walmart was already selling this as a bundle, and I believe other games... Yeah, they already have it.
4459588	4461029	So what's Nintendo's problem?
4461049	4461869	But it's black!
4461909	4462990	Bitch, please!
4466752	4467132	I don't know.
4467252	4469794	All I can say is that my Wii's been gathering dust for...
4472235	4473016	Five months?
4473277	4476943	I would love to see that meeting where somebody at GameStop says that to Reggie Fils-Aimé's face.
4477003	4477665	Bitch, please!
4478025	4479408	I still want to borrow your Wii Fit.
4480730	4481552	Maybe I want to use it.
4482914	4483676	If you're not using it.
4485888	4486168	Yeah, sure.
4486388	4486808	Okay, thank you.
4487069	4487309	All right.
4487669	4488789	Anyhow, let's move on.
4490130	4492371	Spyro in chat says, Wade, it's already here.
4492631	4493451	Yeah, that's my other thing.
4493491	4496993	Is it like in all the rest of the world, like the UK and what?
4497173	4498533	Doesn't even Canada have the Black Week?
4498593	4500414	No, no, because it's supposed to come out May 23rd.
4500854	4503815	Pretty much everywhere but the US and Canada has already had the Black Week.
4503855	4505796	They'll announce it like tomorrow, okay?
4505876	4507717	I mean, they're going to make the announcement soon.
4507777	4508997	It's retarded that they're not.
4510698	4511618	Maybe on the 4th.
4511818	4513699	I don't know why they wait until Tuesday.
4513799	4515619	But it's just going to be an announcement.
4515960	4517940	And whoop-dee-shit.
4518100	4519021	Okay, seriously.
4520021	4521221	Really, a color change?
4521261	4524742	That's really going to get people to buy the Wii that didn't before?
4525142	4527163	I would have bought it, but if only it were black.
4528803	4533848	Going to comments from our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com Actdeft says, to Nintendo, you mad?
4535829	4537911	Ranma says, is that sky getting sassy?
4539853	4554947	Frisbee says, Nintenlol And Tigerclaw says, a black Wii would be nice, but it's not going to hide all the dust it will collect turning it into a white Wii Should be more of like a grayish Wii, but I get your point, that's true It's going to be like the PS3's little dust magnets
4556438	4557579	Good times, good times.
4557939	4567808	Hey, it's that part of the show where we're going to, speaking of dusty things, we're going to jump into DarkSakura's vault and pull out a video game that's a classic.
4567948	4576475	It's time to bring a game up from the vaults of history and deem it as a true classic that you kids need to respect and adore and play some of this week.
4576796	4579098	It's DarkSakura's classic game of the week.
4579758	4581560	DarkSakura, what game did you pick for us this week?
4582518	4584580	I picked a sequel, Rob.
4585601	4586923	I picked Dodonpachi.
4588084	4589065	Dodonpachi.
4589205	4590727	Can't say I've heard of this game.
4590767	4591367	Let's check it out.
4591388	4591828	What's Dodonpachi?
4591848	4593169	You haven't heard of Dodonpachi?
4593189	4593930	I don't think so.
4594591	4596773	Like one of the classic cave shooters.
4596793	4597374	Countdown begins.
4598200	4601441	As in the company that gave us Eskabaluga Whale.
4601982	4603042	I'm sorry, Eskabaluda.
4603462	4605563	I know, I know Cave, but I didn't play all of their games.
4605623	4608304	I mean, was this actually released in the U.S.?
4608344	4609084	What system was this on?
4609285	4611105	Well, I played Dodonpachi in the arcade.
4613266	4614807	It was published by Atlus.
4617508	4623350	But yeah, for systems it came out on... Let's see.
4624051	4626432	I'm trying to remember, because I think that there was... Wasn't there...
4628672	4630132	I don't remember if it was arcade only.
4630793	4640515	It couldn't have been arcade only because I know that this... And I think that Dodonpachi came out in the arcade only.
4642695	4644656	Because I really don't remember playing this at home.
4644696	4646256	I've just had name wrongs.
4646336	4647196	It was also on the Saturn.
4647496	4648697	That's right, it was on the Saturn.
4648737	4649777	And the original PlayStation.
4651485	4652807	Thank you for watching!
4668288	4684425	and then there's another twist in this one but I'm not going to really go much into it but you have different fighters you have your type A which is a narrow stream of shots you have B which is a helicopter that has guns forward and side guns and then type C
4685626	4688268	which is a wide three-way spread of shots.
4689169	4692911	You've got different guns, lasers, bombs, all kinds of different stuff, different power-ups.
4693351	4694832	You get shot mode and laser mode.
4695373	4701577	Different collectible items where you can get power to increase your guns and lasers.
4701837	4703018	Bombs where you get more bombs.
4704018	4707561	MP appears when you've lost all your lives.
4707781	4711083	So when you continue, you can pick that up and you start back at full strength.
4711443	4713664	Which is also in Escaluda.
4714765	4720390	and in another game that... Crap, it's supposed to be even harder than that.
4720510	4725113	I had set a link aside to get the name of it, but anyway.
4727715	4737883	You also... Now, this is something else that totally incorporated into Escaluda later on is that you can get stars for...
4739915	4744999	for killing a boss, a mid-boss or an end-boss.
4745659	4749182	And their bullets are converted into stars, and you get 100 points.
4749282	4754206	Then you get a giant star when you get 10,000 points for a multi-part boss.
4755867	4761911	And then a pentagon that gives you 300 points, but you only find them on the ground.
4762411	4765974	And by the way, the other game that I am thinking of is...
4768999	4769840	Mushahime-sama
4782489	4794987	You've also got a maximum mode in this where if you trigger a bomb when all of your bomb slots are full and then your score increases by 220 points per 1 60th of a second.
4799053	4799253	Yeah.
4800334	4805618	And so you start off with a two multiplier and you increase by one for every successive bomb collected in maximum mode.
4806098	4808260	So it's pretty crazy.
4808580	4818608	You also have a get point system where you have a combo gauge and you get increased number of points from enemies' larger hit counts.
4818728	4820289	It's pretty complex.
4820329	4820950	It's got other stuff.
4820970	4822871	So you've got different areas in the game.
4825253	4840580	but area 7 you can only get to by entering the second loop which is done by completing the first six areas on one credit and doing any of these following requirements where you lose two lives
4841901	4855999	or depending on which one you lose for type A you have to have a maximum hit count of 270 hits type B 300 and type C 330 or score at least 50 million points at the end of area 6 or collect all 13 B's in 4 of the 6 areas
4858840	4866262	And the second loop has the same areas, same bosses, but you have many, many, many more bullets.
4867143	4868543	And giant mechanical bees.
4869584	4873525	And then you get the actual real boss of the game.
4874325	4881628	We've got different bonuses, so you get stuff for getting the pentagons, getting the stars, boss hits, no miss.
4882588	4889131	And then in the second loop, you get 10 million points for each reserve fighter.
4889471	4891531	So you've got different endings, too.
4892852	4898474	If you don't get the second loop access, then you're congratulated by the Donpachi Corps for being brave.
4899275	4905809	if you get everything the mechanized aliens this is what I was talking about with the first one are your own comrades
4907412	4936387	although the international release says it's a lost fleet but they're actually trying to stop you so once everything is done they're all ordered to kill you and that's when you start the second loop so going through it again the whole point of Dampachi is to annihilate all the human beings in the world awesome
4937392	4939333	So yeah, pretty crazy, huh?
4962780	4978888	I believe SSJ100Matt actually linked that in our chatroom because our chatroom is very resourceful here it is, the hardest video game boss ever let me fast forward a little bit here this is nuts, you don't need to fast forward all that much it starts off hard isn't that gorgeous?
4979828	4987692	this is ridiculous this is just retarded stupid there's a video up of a person missing on it not getting hit
4989881	4997122	And keep in mind, the final boss in Espaluda on iPhone releases not quite as many bullets.
4997182	5001263	See Rob, the way these games work, you can only get hit in that little glowing spot right there.
5001403	5001923	That's it.
5006424	5007184	That's bullet hell.
5008185	5008645	Ridiculous.
5009205	5013526	And I like that it talks to you the whole time just like it does in Espaluda.
5015206	5015386	Sorry.
5016587	5018669	But yeah, Cave is evil.
5018769	5021851	Cave is evil for throwing bullets up our noses.
5022692	5036523	So yeah, there was a special version, the campaign version, or DDP Blue ROM, that has a very limited print of the game that was given to winners at a Dodonpachi contest that Cave had.
5037684	5037764	Um...
5039025	5040766	It has the same game.
5040846	5046849	It's harder and has a hyper mode in it, which actually shows up later in Dodonpachi Daiojo.
5048069	5049110	A blue title screen.
5050090	5051291	Very, very hard to get.
5052911	5053592	And actually...
5057674	5059476	There's actually two that have confirmed to exist.
5059556	5066262	One of them belongs to the current world holder for Dodonpachi.
5069245	5076491	There were, of course, the other versions to the Saturn and PlayStation.
5077472	5080915	I was trying to remember if it was Dodonpachi or Dodonpachi, but I think it was Dodonpachi.
5081736	5087818	And that game, I've only ever really played it in the arcade, although I think I have it on Saturn in one of my collections somewhere.
5088418	5089799	But yeah, pretty crazy.
5089979	5093460	And for the record, you want to play 2D games on the Saturn.
5093480	5094060	They look better.
5094961	5098162	Alright, there it is, your classic video game of the week, Dodonpachi.
5098242	5105324	Going to comments from our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Shaoran says, Bullet Hell is all about patterns, beauty, thought.
5105384	5110146	In Bullet Hell, only gorgeous patterns should be allowed as there are no things superior to beauty and thought.
5110926	5114849	Kevin DDR says, Sky, 2-3 means it's the second loop.
5115169	5117831	You have to beat the game with certain conditions to even get to that.
5117871	5120613	Well, that ain't happening, I'll tell you that.
5121414	5126097	And then Shaoran follows up and says, yeah, once you get grazing down, bullet hell games aren't that hard.
5126137	5130180	It's just about memorization, just like any other old Japanese game.
5131041	5133483	Frisbee says, bullet hell is almost like a maze game.
5135003	5135804	I guess I could see that.
5136184	5137485	Just interesting.
5138185	5138486	Alright.
5139226	5140587	I'm just not very good at those games.
5141548	5148293	The last bullet hell game I played was the You Will Die, which was by one of the other All Games hosts making his own game on XNA.
5149134	5149914	And I suck at it.
5151155	5153336	Alright, let's go do our break.
5153356	5154416	We're going to take a quick break.
5154436	5155036	We'll be right back.
5155056	5156236	There's plenty more to come tonight.
5156336	5156957	Listless!
5157077	5157757	Yay!
5157797	5163918	Speaking of friends on all games, one of our podcasting buddies is going to join us for Listless later and Bungie news.
5164259	5165719	There was huge news out of Bungie this week.
5165739	5167059	We're going to talk about that in the next segment.
5167319	5169820	Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy VI remakes?
5169980	5170500	Possibly?
5170580	5170960	Maybe?
5171420	5172901	We'll see after a quick break.
5172921	5173541	So stay tuned.
5173561	5174181	Don't go anywhere.
5174221	5176782	We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5182751	5187295	Hello everybody and welcome back to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
5187375	5193201	It's part B of our show, already in progress, episode number 365 on this May 2nd of 2010.
5193341	5199286	We have plenty more gaming news to get to this hour and listless tonight.
5199366	5201909	And I'll tell you the topic right now, what we're going to be doing tonight.
5202469	5202709	What?
5203650	5206611	Capcom vs. series, should they do next?
5206671	5209413	Or maybe I should actually say versus Capcom would be correct.
5209433	5215095	Because you know, you've had Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, Marvel vs. Capcom, what should they do next?
5215175	5219857	We're going to find out with the definitive list in a few more minutes here at Orange Lounge Radio.
5219877	5221498	But first, we have some rapid, quick...
5222598	5222758	Hey!
5248140	5248380	What?
5249181	5249601	Hey, what?
5249721	5251602	That's what I did during the Live 365.
5251742	5252043	Oh, yeah.
5252243	5253524	When they... Oh, God.
5253804	5255865	How could I forget when they forgot our name?
5255885	5260568	When they were going over... Yeah, we got nominated one year for Live 365 Station of the Year.
5260768	5264171	Like, that's a pretty big honor because it was, what, like 11,000 stations on Live 365?
5264551	5266833	We were one of the five nominated for Station of the Year.
5267213	5272316	And when What's Her Name, Betty whatever, was reading the nominees, she forgot OLR.
5272776	5275198	And you just hear... And, God, I wish I could find that recording.
5275238	5277800	I think it's long gone in the recycle bin or whatever.
5278340	5279422	Thank you for watching!
5296676	5297597	Thanks for watching!
5321429	5322932	Alright, so yeah, that was good times.
5323132	5326778	So I really wish I had a recording of that with Loki in the background.
5326858	5327038	Hey!
5327298	5328761	And then she goes, oh, oh, yeah, yeah!
5328881	5333167	And on Orange Launch, Orange Launch, we just gave each other that look of, well, we didn't win.
5335631	5336092	I'm out of here.
5337851	5338972	Drew all this way for this.
5339132	5342855	And then they drove up their fees by like 300% and we got the fuck out.
5342895	5343775	And now we're here at All Games.
5343795	5344096	You know what?
5344116	5344896	It worked out for the better.
5344996	5351441	Because coming over to All Games I think got us new listeners because we had kind of a cultish audience.
5352121	5356424	And Scott Rubin and Bobby Blackwolf and all the people at All Games had a bit of a cultish audience.
5356805	5360107	So when we married these cults together, it was a good thing.
5360370	5361531	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5380321	5400818	Yes, you can actually play, they have a little game where you can fly around as Iron Man, and apparently it debuted earlier last week on Thursday, and apparently it was part of the out, I'm surprised that they actually have a space, but
5401378	5405260	Um, Audi, I guess, has a space there, and they're teaming up with Paramount for that.
5405781	5408102	So, no actual Iron Man themed space.
5408122	5411304	I mean, it sort of is, but it's part of Audi's thing.
5412184	5412344	Yay.
5413325	5416527	Um, and then I guess, oh, that's funny.
5417347	5424591	Unfortunately, though, it is exclusive to the European PlayStation Network, so... That sucks for most of our listeners.
5425272	5425392	Um...
5427008	5428489	Link, Mega Man, Samus, Simon Belmont, and Bill from Contra
5456478	5461402	And then finally, APP has been slated to be coming out now on June 29th.
5461762	5466605	And they also kind of talked a little bit about how their pricing structure is going to go as well.
5466945	5467766	It's really cool.
5468126	5469327	I like the way that they're doing it.
5469467	5470668	I mean, I think it's going to be pretty sweet.
5471748	5476211	Instead of paying a monthly fee, as you would with most MMOs, you pay for time.
5476612	5479754	So, for example, when you buy the game, you get 50 hours.
5480474	5482756	And how you use that is up to you.
5482796	5484197	If you play a lot, great.
5484557	5485438	If you don't play a lot,
5486238	5486678	No big deal.
5487478	5499442	And once those are up, you have the option to purchase 20 more hours for $7, or you can do 30 days of unlimited access for $10, or 90 days or 180-day passes as well, and they haven't given the prices on those.
5499862	5506604	In addition to extra playtime... Oh, in addition, extra playtime can be earned through different accomplishments in the game.
5507764	5508924	So that's pretty awesome.
5509084	5511645	And I have to say, you know, I don't really hop on the...
5512546	5517885	MMO Bandwagon because I don't have time to play games, but if it's pain as I go...
5519671	5524653	I'm interested, definitely, especially since the game looks like Grand Theft Auto, so I'm all over that.
5524973	5527253	And it's real-time worlds, man.
5527293	5530574	They did Crackdown, and I really am sad that they didn't do the second Crackdown.
5530594	5532695	Thank God WoW doesn't charge by the hour.
5533996	5534716	I'd be in debt.
5535096	5542838	Well, I mean, they do have that option, though, where you can buy unlimited access for 30 days for $10, which is still cheaper than WoW.
5543338	5544539	So it's not bad.
5544719	5544979	Not bad.
5546021	5548682	Alright, well, here's a game that I think Loki might be interested in.
5548722	5551323	I think DarkSakura, I don't know why, this seems like a DarkSakura kind of game, too.
5551943	5556524	THQ and SyFy, the TV network, are getting together to make a new game.
5557044	5560806	Sadly, it's not a Caprica game, but what it is, it's a Ghost Hunters Academy game.
5561246	5562406	Here's the problem I have with that.
5562426	5568148	It's Ghost Hunters Academy, and they've done so many spin-offs of the Ghost Hunters show, it's retarded.
5568188	5569929	Yeah, that's what Academy is about.
5569949	5571670	Academy is what the game's about.
5571930	5572471	Just sayin'.
5596055	5598058	By the way, no details about actual gameplay.
5598378	5605327	Hopefully it plays like Ghostbusters, the old school game that was on Commodore and NES, Don't Cross the Streams, Marshmallow Man, etc.
5606807	5610569	Also, apparently there's stuff afoot in the Mega Man universe.
5610649	5615351	No surprise there, because obviously Mega Man's been having a little bit of a renaissance thanks to Mega Man 9 and Mega Man 10.
5616051	5618052	Apparently there is a Mega Man universe.
5618132	5622553	We talked about this before, you know, but now we might know what this is actually connected to.
5623294	5631137	Apparently there was a little tease dropped in another podcast called Bit Transmission, and Seth Killen was the guest from Capcom.
5631497	5634618	Mega Man still has some surprises in store for everybody
5652923	5656006	It's a six-player co-op Xbox Live RPG game.
5659269	5662232	And this week they're going to be like, shit, someone beat us to it.
5662492	5663213	God damn it.
5663313	5663553	M.U.
5663593	5664134	Konami.
5664734	5665215	Here's the thing.
5665255	5665675	No, no, no.
5665695	5667737	We all know it would be Konami copying them.
5668418	5669139	Oh, I went there.
5669439	5670119	Hey, look, no.
5670200	5671481	Seriously, think about it.
5672101	5674143	I don't want to say nobody has seen it coming.
5675054	5675914	So here's my thought.
5676734	5678715	And especially if the game is called Mega Man Universe.
5679295	5681116	Is this finally that game?
5681756	5689378	Oh yes, that Mega Man game with all of the robot bosses in it at once.
5690958	5691479	That'd be awesome.
5691519	5692879	That would be so fucking awesome.
5694099	5695720	That's more awesome than I think I can handle.
5698118	5698378	DarkTetsuya
5717268	5717528	All right.
5718729	5723172	Anyway, speaking of games that sound really awesome, it'll probably make me pass out from how awesome it is.
5723252	5725414	Mod Nation Racers is on its way out.
5725474	5727635	I never did play the beta, so I don't know if it's actually that good.
5727855	5729397	I got in the beta and never played it.
5729437	5730417	You dumbass.
5730637	5731578	I do that a lot.
5731598	5732299	I would have played it.
5732339	5733359	I didn't get in the beta.
5733399	5734240	I didn't try hard enough.
5734480	5735861	I meant to, but then it expired.
5735881	5737802	Well, I didn't realize the beta was coming out so soon.
5737862	5739563	It's coming out like the end of May.
5739764	5741345	There was a commercial for it on TV the other day.
5741765	5743906	I'm seeing more and more PlayStation commercials on TV.
5743967	5744487	What's up with that?
5745854	5746714	DarkSakura, what you got for us?
5775323	5777045	I have some stuff, Rob.
5777425	5780529	I bet it's not as cool as every freaking Mega Man boss at once.
5781209	5786154	Sims 3 is coming to PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS this fall.
5790846	5799434	EA is working on console versions and should have different features like Karma Power depending on whether you can get lucky or have epic fail.
5800374	5801896	Yeah.
5802436	5806480	Which actually still reminds me that I need to completely uninstall all my Sims 3 stuff.
5807601	5807781	What?
5807801	5810003	I spilled water all over myself.
5811384	5812845	You're a big boy, Rob.
5813245	5814406	I need a sippy cup.
5815227	5815988	I could go get you one.
5816428	5817649	He's getting wet over that news.
5818960	5823930	Literally, I just got wet over the Mega Man news I'll be right back, I need a towel
5825800	5831223	So also, though, coming up for Rock Band, we have new download content.
5831263	5846091	We have No Doubt's Tragic Kingdom to download, which are basically all... We have the songs on there, including different people, and ended on this, Happy Now, See You Then, 16, The Climb, Tragic Kingdom, World Go Round, and You Can Do It.
5846191	5852454	And then individual songs is Orianthe, According to You, and Picture Me Broken, Dearest, I'm So Sorry.
5854205	5859330	and then we also have our UK download games.
5860011	5863614	Just to mention what's coming out, it's Hamster Ball for PlayStation 3.
5865636	5869020	Yeah, Hamster Ball, which looks kind of Monkey Ball-like to me.
5872213	5876797	Alpha Bounce for DSiWare 500 points The Will of Dr. Frankenstein for WiiWare Nintendo 64ish
5894022	5922731	and it's actually a cut down version of The Island of Dr. Frankenstein and then we've got a few others there's Earthworm Jim for DSiWare 500 points which you know it's freaking Earthworm Jim so hey I loved Earthworm Jim it was cute I loved how the titles credits would burp sound like me earlier in the show tonight we have Lead and Gold Gangs of the Wild West which is for PlayStation Network and Steam that would do it
5924253	5926415	Alright, let's get into some Twitter topics!
5928597	5935482	Every week we solicit your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR and we like to pick some of our favorite tweets and read them here on the show.
5936463	5937564	So let's get into the tweets.
5938264	5942568	I gotta admit, they're not always on topic, you guys, but whatever.
5943368	5944029	We're flexible.
5945301	5954847	Uh, let's see, Sutur in Twitter says, uh, what I've been playing, Harvest Moon, Hero of Leaf Valley, fun, but frequent, though short loading screens.
5955028	5956168	What do you think of Harvest Moon?
5957069	5964494	I tried to get into that series on the GameCube, I think there was a game on the GameCube, I couldn't really get into it, I don't know, like, I was just more into Animal Crossing, I wasn't...
5965538	5966099	Maybe it was too much.
5966119	5966840	Fun with cows!
5967060	5968682	Maybe it was too much micromanaging for me.
5968902	5970765	I think it's one of those games I really need to give another shot.
5970845	5972287	Like, I don't think I gave it a fair shot, to be honest.
5972327	5973228	Fun with cows!
5973548	5976672	Did you play, uh... No, you know, Jessica played it a whole bunch.
5976693	5977293	Oh, that's right!
5977313	5978755	And I would hang over.
5978855	5981238	And I was just like, look, my cow loves me!
5981619	5981999	Okay.
5982660	5983321	You guys are awesome.
5983361	5983661	Do you agree?
6004269	6004429	No.
6004810	6005271	Most days.
6006213	6008918	I'm awesome every day, Rob.
6008998	6011603	Knights of Blaze says, here's Twitter topic for tonight.
6011723	6013366	Blur or split second?
6013447	6014308	Which will be better?
6014549	6015050	Split second.
6016294	6017335	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6038769	6042537	They both look awesome to me, but I'm gonna say Blur just because it's the one Loki didn't pick.
6043519	6044762	So now it's officially a tie.
6045243	6048170	I'll let Dan get whatever he wants to and then I'll go, oh that's neat.
6048562	6051404	One for Blur, one for Split Second, one for I don't give a fuck.
6052124	6058609	I mean, you have a game that looks like Burnout with explosions, or you have Mario Kart meets Project Gotham.
6059750	6060150	It's tough.
6060790	6061211	It's tough.
6061671	6062872	Both games look good, actually.
6063272	6063732	But we'll see.
6063852	6065994	You know, a lot of it has to do with the controls, too.
6066474	6067114	Keep that in mind.
6067635	6068395	So we'll see how they control.
6068455	6069376	Blur controls pretty good.
6069416	6073078	I'll check out Split Second soon, but I remember playing it at E3 last year, and it was pretty cool.
6073439	6075260	I wonder if they'll have the same damn demo this year.
6075480	6077161	Oh, no, the game will be out by E3 this year, right?
6077381	6078042	Game's out pretty soon.
6080103	6082846	TigerClaw sends us a couple stories.
6082886	6085888	I'll go ahead and read this one here because the other one I think Bobby got on his show.
6085908	6086969	So let's talk about this one here.
6090693	6091433	Oh, I love this.
6092494	6094216	This is so appropriate what TigerClaw sent us.
6094516	6104504	Apparently a couple of game testers at Activision, as identified by one of the vending machines in the background, they had a speed eating competition of the KFC Double Down.
6105405	6129771	Polishing it off in 57.97 seconds That's just under a minute Apparently it was sent in some type of video over to Kotaku Not yet verified by Twin Galaxies, lol So there it is, you can actually see the guys eating the Double Down And these little bastards are skinny That's what I don't like Like if I ate that Double Down in 60 seconds, I would gain weight These little bastards are still skinny
6131323	6132064	You guys can go to hell.
6132605	6132885	All right.
6134627	6135288	I'm just jealous.
6136129	6136589	Let's see.
6137851	6144959	Sponchtwang says, Can anyone make me anything OLR slash gamer related I can wear on my 5K race in a couple weeks?
6145400	6147102	I'm already going to wear a PokeWalker.
6148383	6148724	I don't know.
6148784	6151447	DarkSakura is the seamstress of the bunch.
6152626	6173841	I can make you a keychain I don't know if Misty is still in the business of making OLR like keychains and stuff but you might want to try talking to Misty because I know she used to have some of that stuff like you know beateries and necklaces and things like that as far as like official shirts yeah I've been talking about that for years nothing yet nothing yet maybe soon
6175482	6176123	DarkTetsuya
6200342	6201804	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6220689	6222371	BlackWolf suggests rearview mirror.
6222651	6223352	I kind of like that.
6224113	6224453	Let's see.
6225394	6229638	DarkTetsuya said he's not totally... I like that rose-colored rearview mirror.
6231380	6232662	Anyway, let's see.
6232782	6239769	BlueSwim sends us a tweet saying, Rob, are you going to get behind the Bieber ruined Twitter trending topic?
6240189	6241770	Happy that people are revolting.
6242190	6252913	See, I'm just ahead of my time because I commented on that whole thing a couple weeks ago about how I don't want to use Twitter anymore because I really can't justify using a site that Justin Bieber is a trending topic on every single day.
6253733	6255613	So I'm glad that people are finally revolting.
6255713	6260775	Take back Twitter from Justin Bieber and all his freaking mouthy fans.
6261655	6262495	And there you have it.
6262515	6263796	Those are Twitter topics for tonight.
6263996	6265936	Twitter.com slash OLR.
6265976	6266937	Or just ignore it.
6268504	6271025	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6291604	6294747	Bungie has entered in a 10 year partnership with Activision
6311792	6318117	Yeah, apparently they're going to publish all games based on Bungie's next big action game universe.
6319038	6325503	And they're looking to publish on multiple platforms, so it's no longer going to be Xbox exclusive anymore.
6326343	6326483	And...
6328447	6329327	It kind of makes you wonder.
6329747	6331828	Bungie, have you not been reading the news?
6332108	6332968	I mean, seriously?
6332988	6335749	Yeah, but there's a huge difference, Loki.
6336049	6337969	I think you made the mistake a lot of people are making.
6338289	6340650	Activision did not buy Bungie.
6341550	6343451	Activision has a publishing deal with Bungie.
6344071	6346311	Activision is basically getting free money out of this deal.
6346531	6352333	I mean, all they're doing, they're putting out, you know, they'll do the marketing and they'll do everything outside the actual development of the game.
6352353	6353773	That's what this agreement's all about.
6355262	6357083	I honestly don't think this is a big deal.
6357403	6359884	If Activision had bought Bungie, then yes.
6359984	6362165	Oh my gosh, Doom and Gloom, Bungie, what are you smoking?
6362205	6363986	You all are high.
6364306	6366327	But it's just a publishing deal.
6366627	6368148	I mean, they had to sign with somebody.
6369088	6370308	They weren't going to self-publish.
6370609	6375511	And what's funny is Bungie's Harold Ryan looks like Brendan Fraser.
6375631	6377692	He even has that really creepy smile.
6378692	6380453	I didn't realize Brendan Fraser had a creepy smile.
6381193	6406137	and he's just creepy all around um so yeah so they're gonna be publishing their next game no word exactly on what the next game is actually gonna be but that will probably be coming up at E3 probably at E3 and then also probably gonna help uh with that void of people that hate on Activision right now although I can't imagine it's gonna really affect their sales that much including uh the Call of Duty franchise because people bitch but people still buy
6408405	6413731	It would be interesting to know about this agreement if the Final Cut arrangement is still with Bungie.
6413751	6415072	You know, Final Cut, so to speak.
6415452	6418115	Or if Activision gets to make changes to games they want to publish.
6418235	6420197	I doubt that's in the agreement.
6420237	6422820	Kind of Bungie, I imagine, got to do whatever the hell they wanted with this.
6423581	6425523	So I don't think this is going to be bad news at all.
6426364	6426844	I really don't.
6427905	6447025	and I've been as critical of Activision as the next guy and so forth but I just think this is just Bungie had to sign with someone and Activision makes as good of a sense as anyone else if it had been EA people would have still been like oh my god I can't believe it it could have been Konami and it would have been oh my god doesn't matter
6449181	6449341	Pick one.
6466288	6469870	Square Enix Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy VI Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy VI
6495646	6496247	Thank you very much.
6510817	6538614	Shinji Hashimoto was quoted on Twitter saying that they are undecided about a downloadable port of Second Densetsu 3 and the mobile RPG Everheart Odyssey and then he also said for Final Fantasy 5 and 6 there are technical issues as well so at present these are also undecided not sure what those technical issues are I wonder if it's space because if you think about it 4 was a much shorter game than 5 and 6 and I wonder if they maybe have just maxed out those damn cartridges
6540430	6540970	I wouldn't think so.
6540990	6541471	I don't know.
6541611	6542351	I don't think so.
6544953	6550778	Well, Amiga777 in chat says, Square Enix, spare us the FMV theatrics and give us some awesome gameplay.
6551178	6551598	I agree.
6551638	6557302	I would sacrifice the full motion theatrics for some Uber 3D-ness, but I don't know.
6558183	6563087	At the same time, I'm okay if they spend the resources just developing something new, you know?
6564127	6565088	I don't know.
6565208	6570350	I'm torn because the 3 and 4 remakes were pretty hot, but at the same time, I'm not like, ah, they need to do 5 and 6.
6570671	6581416	Or, you know, if you just want to, I don't know, port, say, for example, 4, 5, and 6 onto a DS cartridge and don't even worry about upgrading it, I'd be fine with that.
6581936	6583757	Maybe it's something they're going to do for the 3DS.
6584258	6584478	Hmm?
6586439	6586759	I don't know.
6588038	6593864	Alright guys, well we are going to get into a segment here on the show called Listless!
6595145	6596987	Yay, Listless!
6599090	6605136	And for tonight's Listless, we gotta get one of our friends here on the phone, so we're gonna make a little outbound call right now.
6605543	6611126	Tonight's listless topic, what Capcom vs. series should they do next?
6611587	6615749	Does somebody want to explain listless, how listless works, while I give our guest a call tonight?
6616369	6621232	Well, the way that it works is that we go around, all of us, and we each pick a game.
6621873	6627396	We pick three of them in order, or pick a subject, you know, something that we would like to be on the list.
6627436	6629197	Not a game tonight, but something, yeah.
6629677	6639868	and then what happens is we leave it to the chat room to pick well we each take one off of the list and then we leave it to the chat room to pick the winner
6640393	6645054	That's right, so if you want to help vote for the winner, and remember guys, this is the definitive list.
6645754	6648194	Once this list is written, there's no arguing.
6648334	6648815	It's done.
6649735	6650875	It's the definitive list.
6651155	6652795	It's a highly scientific process.
6653155	6657336	But in order to play the game, we need four people, so we're going to call up a special guest right now.
6658796	6661437	Let me down the music here while we give our guest a call here.
6661537	6662517	Hopefully he's standing by.
6662557	6663597	I told him it would be 8 o'clock.
6665637	6668398	Otherwise, we'll just open it up to somebody else on Skype, I suppose.
6670914	6671534	One ringy dingy.
6672415	6673375	Live radio, it's fun.
6673415	6674115	Two ringy dingys.
6678637	6679777	Watch, he's not going to pick up.
6686059	6686399	Hello?
6686699	6687159	Hi!
6687720	6688460	Is this John?
6688500	6689220	Hi, who's this?
6689500	6691361	Oh my god, it's Crazy Radio Guy.
6691441	6692201	Hey, John.
6692721	6694742	Oh, hey, I totally forgot you were calling.
6694762	6695182	You're on and off.
6696738	6698539	DarkSakura.com
6727675	6732419	Did you know that one of your old co-hosts said that I sound like a straight version of you?
6734541	6735222	Who is that?
6735342	6735682	Jenna?
6735702	6737444	Or Jessica?
6737964	6738905	When was she on the show?
6738925	6739645	Yeah, Jessica.
6739846	6742548	I haven't talked to her in years.
6742648	6745751	Whenever I take off from USL, she's going to be hosting for me now.
6746011	6746611	Oh, wow.
6747692	6749574	Oh, how come I wasn't invited to be a guest host?
6749614	6750235	I see how it is.
6750455	6751116	Okay, okay.
6751216	6751617	That's fine.
6751997	6753779	Okay, well, you can bring that up with Travis.
6753799	6754460	No, I will.
6754720	6754980	I will.
6755221	6755461	All right.
6755841	6759125	I'm going to make my Star Trek Online character just to find Travis and beat the shit out of him.
6759345	6760546	Was Travis a human?
6760566	6761507	I have to be a Klingon.
6761968	6762388	I don't know.
6762428	6763610	I don't play Star Trek Online.
6763690	6764511	I play WoW.
6764651	6764931	All right.
6765271	6769516	I don't know because certain somebody named Travis took me off of Facebook.
6771300	6772701	Travis Donovan, you're a bitch.
6773301	6774121	I know, punch him in the balls.
6774141	6775982	That's always a good solution for Travis.
6776122	6776683	You know what, though?
6777343	6778944	Facebook does weird things.
6779084	6786288	Like, I've lost friends mysteriously, so he may not have done it on purpose, but if he did, it's got some drama.
6786428	6787108	All right, here we go.
6787168	6788309	Let's do this.
6788909	6792291	All right, so, Bressel, you know how... Hey, tell the people in the background to shut up.
6792791	6794011	We're trying to do a radio show.
6794031	6796533	Hey, people in the background, please stop masturbating.
6796973	6797373	All right.
6798794	6800115	How was SakuraCon, by the way?
6800255	6800775	Did you have fun?
6802835	6803695	It was a lot of fun.
6804416	6805757	I've made a lot of friends.
6805857	6807959	I've made a lot more friends, and it was just a great time.
6808640	6809240	Wait, you have friends?
6809300	6810881	I definitely look forward to 2011.
6811001	6812142	Shut the fuck up, dude.
6815645	6816666	Oh, good times, good times.
6816686	6817026	What is this?
6817067	6819408	Aren't we supposed to be playing a game online soon or something?
6821170	6821730	Was I what?
6822271	6822791	Never mind.
6823192	6823472	All right.
6824884	6826785	I think I was talking about something I'm not supposed to talk about yet.
6826825	6827085	All right.
6828866	6829827	Let's get into something else.
6830267	6831188	Get into the list list.
6831868	6837591	You know tonight's topic is what Capcom versus series, or should I say versus Capcom series, should they do next?
6839853	6842254	We're going to go around and get your top three answers.
6842314	6843715	And Breslow, we'll start with you.
6843755	6845056	Your number three answer.
6845176	6848518	What Capcom versus series should they do next?
6849614	6854138	I'm throwing the political card on here because I think this is the most important one since I get to go first.
6854718	6855999	And I'm surprised they haven't done this.
6856060	6857461	Capcom versus Midway.
6860461	6862662	DarkSakura, what do you want to pick for your number three answer?
6891631	6908623	McDonaldland vs. Capcom Mayor McCheese and the Grimace and the Fry Guys I fucking love it, the Grimace and Birdie the Early Bird
6910663	6911043	Hello?
6911223	6913544	Whatever happened to the McDonaldland characters?
6913584	6914405	Cut off, hello?
6914465	6914865	Hello?
6914925	6915285	Hello?
6915325	6915845	Breslow?
6916485	6916865	Okay.
6917086	6917566	Sorry.
6917906	6921567	It's McDonaldland versus Capcom, is what it is.
6922328	6923028	Oh, our stream?
6923448	6925729	I want Mayor McCheese as the boss.
6925909	6932472	Apparently our stream died, and our thing is trying to reconnect right now, so... But we're gonna keep recording for podcast's sake.
6933132	6937294	Shit, but now our chatters can't hear to vote, so... We're gonna hope... Yeah.
6938334	6939435	Midway vs. Capcom, McDonaldland vs. Capcom
6954813	6976421	I was trying to be slightly serious here, so this is kind of obscure for people who don't remember him, but Paul Robertson versus Capcom, and to explain who Paul Robertson is, he's the guy that did the animation Pirate Babies Cabana Street Fight, and then also some... Yes, that animation was such an amazing thing.
6977085	6983090	Exactly, and like Devil Eyes and just like all sorts of crazy ass 8-bit animation stuff.
6983170	6985031	So, that would be kind of cool.
6986232	6987633	Okay, fair enough.
6987733	6989295	Paul Robertson vs. Capcom?
6990075	6992837	It's better than Pirate Baby's Cabana Street Fight vs. Capcom.
6993978	6998882	Alright, my number three answer, I have picked Saturday Night Live vs. Capcom.
7001280	7001360	S.N.L.
7001380	7002601	vs. Capcom S.N.L.
7002641	7003042	vs. Capcom
7021394	7021774	I did!
7022135	7028558	I beat the crap out of all the crappy skits they've done from like 97 to 2003.
7028738	7029579	I know, it'd be fun.
7030219	7046669	Anyhow, your number two answer, Breslow, and just to catch the folks up joining us because the feed was down, so far we have Midway vs. Capcom, McDonaldland vs. Capcom, Paul Robertson vs. Capcom, and Saturday Night Live vs. Capcom.
7047389	7049891	What is your number two answer, Breslow?
7050373	7051254	How bad are you?
7051294	7055236	Jesus vs. Capcom I will do Bible vs. Capcom God would be the end boss
7078203	7079865	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7102687	7105449	I had to change one of my answers because of your SNL thing.
7105509	7106149	I gotta top that.
7129895	7131296	Although that would be my number one answer.
7132096	7133917	Now it's going to be a semi-serious one.
7134157	7135557	Konami vs. Capcom.
7135657	7140159	Because they have a lot of good 8-bit characters that would be pretty awesome to bring over.
7141159	7142340	Different Contra characters.
7142360	7145761	You can put Frogger in there if you want.
7147342	7148522	Castlevania.
7148542	7150803	That would be pretty awesome.
7150863	7154624	I'm also going to go with the super freaking obvious.
7154704	7155345	I was going to do...
7156965	7157866	You're a jackass, Rob Roberts!
7178587	7184490	I mean, hello, Mario, Samus, Pit, all the Super Smash Bros.
7184530	7186452	Melee characters versus Capcom.
7186792	7188353	Hello, why is this not happening?
7189349	7189869	Duh!
7190770	7191090	Alright.
7191971	7193852	Sounds like I took your answer, didn't I, Breslol?
7195073	7195294	You did.
7195534	7196014	My bad.
7196034	7197175	Well, do you have a backup answer?
7197195	7199196	Because we're ready for your number one answer.
7199497	7201458	So far, let me recap while you think.
7201879	7214348	So far, the list is Midway vs. Capcom, McDonaldland vs. Capcom, Paul Robertson vs. Capcom, SNL vs. Capcom, Bible vs. Capcom, Arc System Works vs. Capcom, Konami vs. Capcom, Nintendo vs. Capcom.
7215349	7216810	Breslol, what is your number one answer?
7219002	7226644	all games versus Capcom all games versus Capcom would you be one of the fighters in all games versus Capcom?
7227804	7232745	I would and so would you and your special move would be to bitch slap people silly what would my special move be?
7234586	7238767	it would be to bitch slap people silly what would DarkSakura's special move be?
7240747	7245408	um throwing Guinness bombs at people and Loki?
7247409	7247509	um
7249062	7255387	Throwing his number 7 ranking of DPA, what's it called, at everybody.
7256928	7257289	Alright.
7259170	7262513	DarkSakura, it's time for your number 1 answer.
7262533	7264355	What is your number 1 answer, Blank vs. Capcom?
7265115	7265596	Taito.
7267457	7273102	Could you imagine Bob and Bob getting, like, Hadouken?
7274343	7275464	What would their special move be?
7275504	7276845	They just trap the opponent in a bubble?
7277751	7278792	Yeah, and Pop'Em.
7279593	7280333	That might be fun.
7280954	7286058	And they could have special attacks like the water bubble.
7289241	7290121	We're recording this.
7290162	7292103	Remember, it's only porn if you tape it.
7292123	7294005	John, blow your rape whistle.
7294685	7295886	Alright, back to the show.
7296927	7298829	Anything else you want to say about Tidal vs. Capcom?
7299089	7299670	Rainbow Islands.
7300370	7302071	Loki, your number one answer, please.
7302532	7307776	My number one answer is very obvious considering the SNL thing.
7308456	7310538	It's Nick at Night versus Capcom.
7311198	7315422	And, of course, it's awesome because you have a fighting game with Bill Cosby.
7315902	7316882	I'll murder you.
7317242	7319703	Will Smith from the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.
7319783	7320963	John, shut the fuck up.
7321643	7325304	You're interrupting a professionally done radio show by raping me.
7325444	7326705	I just want you to know this.
7326745	7327565	This is a bad idea.
7327585	7329645	This is totally going in the best of later on.
7330966	7337467	Hey, do you think you could stop getting your asshole raped by a woman in time to do this show here?
7338427	7341248	Actually, the worst part is I'm getting my asshole raped by a man.
7341548	7342708	Oh, well, that's nothing new.
7343129	7344449	All right, Loki.
7346065	7347606	Nick at Night vs. Capcom.
7347806	7352390	Yes, and I think the Golden Girls was on there one time, so that would be pretty awesome.
7353210	7355652	But the monkeys were on there, and could you imagine that fight?
7355752	7356893	That would be pretty awesome.
7357113	7359115	As long as Bea Arthur is a character, I'm fine.
7360096	7361237	Would Bea Arthur be a character?
7361937	7362178	Sure.
7362258	7362818	Then I'm fine.
7363278	7363619	All right.
7364379	7370945	My number one answer, I'm going to totally... Black Wolf says, Cosby's Ultra is serving Puddin' Pop.
7372225	7372706	Jane vs. Capcom?
7372746	7374007	Jane vs. Capcom, that would be funny.
7395495	7397957	So, Joss Whedonverse versus Capcom.
7398197	7401220	And when he comes out, the first thing he says is, you're damaging my calm.
7402621	7403842	Tell me that would not sell.
7403882	7406824	But we also need the blue... Like, I'll be in my bunk.
7407505	7413350	But we also need, like, a mid-boss to be, like, the blue hand guys from, you know...
7415322	7418463	I just want Elijah Dusku from Dollhouse to be a character because she's hot.
7418743	7419023	All right.
7420784	7421064	Anyhow.
7421264	7423345	Oh, you are not booing me, chat room.
7423605	7424005	F you.
7425386	7425726	F you all.
7425766	7426026	All right.
7426826	7428307	Becky just said that you were made of wind.
7428747	7429367	Thank you, Becky.
7430127	7430408	All right.
7430428	7431548	See, somebody loves me.
7431968	7432188	Ass.
7432588	7432869	All right.
7433049	7436690	And some of the suggestions from chat that didn't make the cut.
7438190	7438911	What the fuck?
7438971	7439731	All right.
7439831	7441492	Doctor Who versus Capcom.
7441672	7441832	Capcom.
7444693	7460818	Disney vs. Capcom, Duck Island vs. Capcom, Power Rangers vs. Capcom, Cooking Mama vs. Capcom, Mavis Beacon vs. Capcom, Capcom vs. Capcom, Coco vs. Capcom
7463077	7464618	Wow, DC vs. Capcom.
7464678	7464978	All right.
7466039	7467460	Anyhow, it's time now.
7467680	7468240	It's too late.
7468280	7470041	Your suggestions didn't make the cut.
7470081	7470962	I'm sorry, chat room.
7471042	7476084	It's one of life's tough lessons is that sometimes your opinions don't count.
7476485	7476705	What?
7478075	7486061	I said it sucks for those guys Midway vs. Capcom McDonaldland vs. Capcom Paul Robertson vs. Capcom SNL vs. Capcom Bible vs. Capcom Arc System Works vs. Capcom Konami vs. Capcom Nintendo vs. Capcom All Games vs. Capcom
7507378	7515360	Taito vs. Capcom, Nick at Night vs. Capcom, and Whedon vs. Capcom, Brest Lol, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
7517081	7518521	Nintendo vs. Capcom.
7519001	7520001	Oh, you whore.
7520101	7520682	Why not?
7521742	7523062	It'd be hard to go multi-platform.
7523662	7529384	Because it would turn into the Capcom characters have to do button combinations, and then you could just spam Falcon Punch.
7531887	7535269	I suppose I will accept that logic, but you're still an asshole.
7535369	7537630	Alright, DarkSakura, you're next.
7537971	7540172	Which one of these is not worthy of the list?
7540552	7541633	Bible vs. Capcom.
7543154	7543894	Oh, you just...
7547097	7549559	Not feeling Jesus is a playable character, huh?
7549659	7553942	I don't really give a crap about Jesus in the game.
7554182	7555363	Alright, fair enough.
7555944	7558266	Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
7559787	7562109	I'm going to have to go with Midway vs. Capcom.
7563390	7569555	Just because I've seen the Mugen videos with the Mortal Kombat characters vs. Street Fighter.
7569655	7571457	It looks weird, okay?
7572718	7575060	I guess they could reanimate him, but it would just be weird.
7575800	7578725	And besides, Midway is no longer around.
7579927	7580367	That's true.
7580387	7581910	It would be kind of hard to get the licensing, wouldn't it?
7582287	7582547	All right.
7582867	7585888	As far as me, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
7585928	7588068	I'm going to have to say Paul Robertson versus Capcom.
7588088	7588528	Too obscure.
7589049	7589529	Too obscure.
7589629	7590429	Yeah, too obscure.
7591189	7591749	Sorry, Loki.
7592669	7594170	I'm sure it was funny, but too obscure.
7594430	7595510	See, there's more coming in.
7595830	7597251	Rob's mom versus Capcom.
7597751	7598931	Atlas versus Capcom.
7599011	7600211	Fallout 3 versus Capcom.
7600451	7602112	Prop 8 versus Capcom.
7602992	7605132	Yeah.
7605693	7605953	All right.
7606293	7606653	Wait, wait.
7606913	7609173	The Hall of Presidents versus Capcom.
7612501	7634484	Animatronic Presidents vs. Capcom Alright guys, it is now your time to vote You are going to place a vote via private message to Sky With your number 1 and number 2 answers Please label them, number 1 and number 2 answers Here's the list McDonaldland vs. Capcom SNL vs. Capcom Arc System Works vs. Capcom Konami vs. Capcom All Games vs. Capcom Taito vs. Capcom

7638706	7641607	And if you're not listening to Orange Lodge Radio Live, you're a terrible human being.
7663908	7665008	Well, thank you, Breslul.
7666849	7670530	Uh-oh, yeah?
7675011	7675591	He just hung up.
7675711	7677411	That was his last thing to say.
7677931	7679052	I bet he thought that was funny.
7681032	7683953	Well, I hope you get your butthole torn open by that guy.
7684033	7685693	Alright, let's move on.
7688308	7688668	Wow.
7689529	7693270	I think that was the first on-air rape that we had going on during a fun, happy segment.
7693290	7695611	I don't think that was the first on-air rape that we've had.
7696251	7697572	This show is on-air rape.
7697612	7698172	That's true.
7698552	7700413	We do kind of rape gaming news every week.
7700433	7705495	Well, back in the day when we used to broadcast live during some of those DDR parties.
7705715	7711718	Yeah, that was on-air rape, and I think that's where Big Black Cock came into play.
7711938	7712318	Yeah.
7715617	7716418	I believe in them.
7717058	7719319	Alright, please, more gaming news.
7719460	7720680	DarkSakura, save us.
7721301	7722101	Help.
7722301	7728225	For Call of Duty fans, actually the next one coming out has been named.
7728485	7733188	It's Call of Duty Black Ops coming out on the 9th of November 2010.
7733248	7735449	That's at least the European date.
7736950	7738651	And they've confirmed co-op for it.
7738911	7743694	So you can play with your buddies together killing people.
7744754	7750438	Um, and that's actually one that I would be interested in, I think, checking out as a Black Ops game.
7750919	7758004	You know, instead of, you know, full-on face-front combo, you know, combat, you have to be sneaky like Solid Snake.
7760446	7760666	So.
7762587	7769152	I, well, I'm sure the fans are just, no, all they're saying is, it's a triarch, Call of Duty, meh.
7771042	7772865	Red Faction
7782649	7784510	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7803737	7804638	That's scary.
7804858	7806800	I'm sorry, how is this a problem?
7809161	7810943	I believe you just called this a problem.
7811143	7812484	Because it's gonna suck.
7812524	7818429	The problem is the rumor I heard that SyFy is like picking up wrestling and stuff now and they're not gonna do those movies anymore.
7818549	7819450	That's a problem.
7821465	7822886	They're all just blending together.
7823026	7825047	Every station does not need wrestling.
7826407	7833270	Unless they're dressing up like space aliens or people from Battlestar Galactica, it does not need to be on sci-fi.
7833310	7836251	There's nothing science fiction about wrestling except for the plot.
7841593	7842353	What the hell was that?
7847984	7849565	Watch the shark through the plane.
7853547	7854047	Ah yes.
7854267	7857889	This looks so fake, I love it.
7858009	7860570	Condor Airlines.
7863932	7871656	And they had an image or whatever, a little picture that someone made that talked about what it would take physics-wise for the shark to do that.
7872096	7873096	It was just retarded.
7876622	7878905	Ah yes, high production value right there.
7880087	7880768	Holy shit!
7889099	7891202	That's the kind of stuff you make in like high school.
7891242	7893105	How dare someone try to take this from me!
7895396	7896557	Shark eating a plane.
7896597	7898478	How dare you try to take that out of my life?
7899179	7907204	Anyways, so they're going to be doing possibly an ongoing series as well, if the movie does well.
7907464	7923414	So it's expected to be coming out early 2011, and we'll see how it turns out, because most movies that are based on video games kind of suck, and this one's done by SyFy, who puts out movies that pretty much always suck, so...
7926405	7929319	I don't know, it's like a convergence of suck
7933320	7947826	A convergence of suck, really Yes Alright Well, we'll see what happens Good thing they're not making a movie out of this Because I think it would be kind of boring But apparently somebody has beat Bejeweled 2 Yes, who knew that Bejeweled 2 was beatable?
7947926	7956330	I sure didn't But Bejeweled 2 got beaten this week after three years That's right, this guy Mike Lady
7957010	7985071	Ladi, he probably gets called Lady, poor guy Mike Ladi, I'm going to say it's Ladi Apparently beat Bejeweled 2 He played the same game for 2,205 hours and 51 minutes That was a score of 2,147,000,000 points Apparently that's the point where the score display just went to black And there's actually a YouTube of it that's up And PopCap just said, hey, you beat it
7985811	7986211	and DarkSakura.com
8006869	8010530	or not because maybe PopCap didn't want to show their game breaking, I don't know.
8011790	8013610	That was just like a little promotional video.
8013630	8014930	It was all happy go lucky.
8014970	8016231	Yay, Bejeweled, we're awesome.
8017111	8018351	Play us on Facebook.
8019471	8020471	Well, somebody broke it.
8020511	8024132	So yes, a kill screen is achievable in Bejeweled 2, but three years?
8024332	8024852	Seriously?
8025512	8025952	Seriously.
8026272	8026712	I know, right?
8026872	8027232	Seriously.
8028093	8029033	Three years is a long time.
8030293	8030813	I know, right?
8030933	8032753	And that was all time when he was supposed to be working.
8035754	8036254	Mailbag!
8040143	8041403	Every week you send us emails.
8041463	8044704	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com DarkSakura might read them on air.
8045284	8045524	Okay.
8045624	8048565	And she might decide to say, screw you guys, I'm not reading emails this week.
8048825	8049245	I'm reading them.
8049465	8050826	Alright, yay, we caught her in a good mood.
8052206	8053706	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio.
8053826	8055347	Haseo here to rant a bit.
8055767	8060908	First, I'm sorry for spelling errors due to the use of Vicodin after surgery involving knee dislocation.
8061108	8061928	Dude, sorry.
8062468	8063329	But you misspelled Vicodin.
8065029	8065531	You know what though?
8065611	8068740	I would say being on Vicodin is an acceptable excuse for bad grammar.
8068760	8070505	Dude, when you're on Vicodin, you don't care.
8071875	8072876	We're gonna give them a pass.
8073317	8074658	You get a pass.
8075018	8076640	I was really just saying that to be a smartass.
8077160	8081564	Second, the whole Activision bullshit starting with this whole Infinity Ward leaving the company.
8081724	8087870	Okay, Infinity Ward left Activision and they, as we already know, are the creators of Call of Duty.
8088351	8095638	Now, according to G4 and their The Feed service, they say that the next Call of Duty games will be called Call of Duty Black Ops comes out this fall.
8095738	8096939	What the hell is Activision thinking?
8097339	8100902	Especially when the Infinity Ward founders left and 35 other team members quit.
8101082	8107747	Oh, and did I mention they're suing Activision for up to $500 million for reasons untold to me.
8108267	8115312	Now, Activision, as stupid as they are, they have Bungie, the creators of Halo, sign a 10-year contract.
8115552	8116033	What the hell?
8117113	8118454	Lastly, three questions for Loki.
8119535	8118454	1.
8119595	8122837	Would it be illegal to infect my aunt's computer with a virus to teach her a lesson? 2.
8123998	8125279	How would I go about that?
8126100	8128022	She's a bitch, I mean.
8128062	8130123	I'm not trying to cripple it, only trying to burst her.
8130264	8133666	I'm not to blame for the fucking it up bubble like a warning virus.
8136809	8138811	Switch her default browser to Internet Explorer.
8138831	8139972	I think that'll pretty much do it.
8142173	8143074	Have her use Yahoo Mail.
8144515	8146957	Just switch her homepage to Two Girls, One Cup.
8148639	8149460	Or Lemon Party.
8150926	8156851	2.
8151727	8156851	Is there a way to hack a copy of Final Fantasy XII like you hacked XIII, or do you know of a cheat?
8156891	8159514	I've beaten it over a year ago, and I want to replay for story.
8161235	8164618	Because Loki's a big cheater at XIII, so can you cheat at XII?
8164958	8168101	XII, I'm not sure if there's a way to hex edit the save.
8168121	8168482	I mean, maybe.
8168602	8168882	Maybe.
8170541	8171382	I'm sure there is.
8172262	8172583	Three.
8173183	8173343	Yeah.
8174084	8175125	You just need a game genie.
8175625	8176065	Yeah, really.
8176606	8179448	Is there a way to hack an imported UMD and change the text to English?
8180328	8180509	No.
8181009	8181249	No.
8182230	8190496	But, yeah, back to the Final Fantasy XII thing, because it was on PlayStation 2, you could probably just get, like, a GameShark or a Pro Action Replay or something like that if you don't want to cheat in the game.
8193778	8197081	Why did Bobby Blackwolf in chat just say two girls, one cup versus Capcom?
8198523	8200504	Because he's trying to mess with our brains.
8200764	8201744	I think the cup wins.
8203245	8205706	Thanks for reading my email, and if you don't, what the fuck, people?
8206066	8210447	Your loyal listener, Haseo Sumiragawa.
8213188	8213549	Made me.
8213829	8215829	I was just thinking of the cup winning.
8216309	8217650	Whoever wins, we all lose.
8218351	8227854	This is Robert M. I don't mean to sound like one of those one-nit fanboys, but since it came out, I've been pretty obsessed with WarioWare DIY, even though I'm currently somewhat stagnant at creating new games in it.
8228294	8236897	For some reason, I actually had a dream where one of my microgames set a record for in-game sales, which somehow made the Orange Challenge Radio show roll.
8237417	8244900	I remember Loki saying he didn't get it, meaning the game, and all you did was tap and a character moves up slightly.
8245880	8247441	This somehow leads to a kernel of thought.
8247461	8250282	Would you like to see a series of OLR dream game microgames?
8250862	8256305	Or would you, of course, prefer these concepts in a more substantial, more readily accessible, less handheld format?
8256885	8265469	I imagine having Puzzle Sluts or What They Play Snap available in my warehouse might be confusing to other people in my in-game friends list.
8265669	8266250	Have a good show!
8287112	8305503	it has to do with a poll that whattheyplay.com ran like a year ago about the most offensive game most offensive thing in video games and like I think homos in games was like more offensive than dismembered heads or something so we suggested that they should make a game about it called whattheyplay.com snap go read about it in the OLR wiki it's all there
8306627	8308788	This next email just made me snort hard.
8310429	8311409	Yes, yes please, oh my god, yes.
8326056	8336499	After spending many hours sweating countless buckets and crumbling hundreds of pieces of paper before tossing them in the general direction of a wastebasket, I'm prepared to unveil the following concept, the Golden Girls Death Squad.
8338080	8341801	The Golden Girls Death Squad will be a four-player cooperative twin-stick shooter.
8342341	8351504	Each player will assume the likeness of either Dorothy, Rose, Blanche, or Sophia and battle an advancing army of terrorist robots and balding perverted old men in full 180p high definition.
8351604	8354065	I'm sorry, I'm about to explode from awesomeness.
8354545	8355886	Rob needs to go change his mantis.
8356346	8356766	I do.
8358087	8362490	You'll use the left stick to maneuver each girl's technologically advanced mechanical wheelchair.
8363450	8371775	Each wheelchair is equipped with its own unique weaponry, just as each girl is equipped with wisecracks and quips taken straight from the popular TV show and voiced by the original actresses.
8372355	8374116	Spoken dialogue varies with context.
8374236	8376878	When you get close to an enemy, you'll hear Dorothy cry, Have you lost your head?
8377338	8378679	as she chops off their head with an axe.
8380254	8380954	I'm crying.
8381014	8383175	This is so beautiful.
8383335	8384335	Rob's red in the face.
8384355	8385076	This is beautiful.
8386536	8389777	Each of the seven levels are loosely based on the show's seven seasons.
8389877	8397720	Boss enemies will include Dorothy's cheating husband, Stanley, evil palette swapped versions of the main characters, and the leader of a cult named High Cholesterol.
8398760	8404082	Fortunately, you will have rocket launchers, nuclear bombs, exploding calcium supplements as part of your wheelchair arsenal.
8405353	8421479	The game will feature 4 player simultaneous drop in drop out play over Xbox Live 60 frames per second animation simple and responsive controls motion captured versions of the show's actresses and a driving rock and electronic soundtrack featuring a hard drum and bass mix of the show's opening theme Thank you for being a friend
8422339	8426120	Development of the game will commence immediately upon our receipt of the rights to the Golden Girls license.
8426680	8428020	You can help me get that for free, right?
8428660	8433421	The budget currently allocated for the development of this game consists of the $4 in my wallet.
8433541	8436222	I'd hate to use it on licensing when I can pick up a sandwich instead.
8436842	8437162	Oh, wait.
8437442	8439143	I think I just sold a copy of Falling.
8439423	8440103	Now my budget is $4.70.
8441003	8441483	Wait, what?
8441523	8442723	You have to pay tax on sandwiches?
8442903	8443303	Crap.
8444144	8444444	Oh, well.
8444464	8445004	You little bitch.
8445444	8445684	Oh, well.
8445724	8449725	Please look forward to the upcoming release of Sharpshooter, the announcement of future YYR game titles.
8449825	8450445	All my love, Erin.
8451584	8453926	That is the pinnacle of awesome email.
8453966	8458929	Yeah, first off, you get a gold medal for awesome email.
8459149	8461171	That's an official OLR gold star.
8461211	8463573	They don't get handed out very often, but you just won one, sir.
8464653	8467255	Even if that was the biggest tease I've ever heard in my life.
8467355	8468696	Dude, here it is.
8469117	8470818	You don't have to get the licensing.
8471358	8474220	You just call it Grandma's Got Guns.
8475961	8477543	And it would sell billions.
8478462	8482958	Quick poll in chat How many of you would play a game called Grandma's Got Guns?
8485763	8487044	Also, I want to throw this out here.
8487945	8490848	Everybody should buy Falling and what's his other game?
8490888	8493250	Snake360 and the other one, Sharpshooter.
8493610	8495512	Buy them all immediately when they come out.
8495752	8496633	They're like a dollar.
8496733	8497734	So, I mean, what?
8497774	8499115	Like $3, maybe $4.
8499155	8499776	I don't remember how much.
8499856	8500957	Maybe Snake360 is more.
8501237	8501657	Whatever.
8501697	8504079	It's like less than $10 for all these games.
8504580	8510065	And if you buy these games, then we will guilt him into making Grandma's Got Guns.
8512196	8512636	There you go.
8513177	8516559	And just so you know, I just want Aaron to hear the quick results of our poll and chat.
8517280	8524265	Me, yes, me, Grandma vs. Capcom, fuck yeah, yes, yes, me, fuck yeah, hi, yes.
8525486	8526447	I haven't seen a no yet.
8527908	8533412	Dude, if I made a game with zombies in it, can sell millions of copies, how about I made a game with Grandma in it?
8536254	8537055	You know you want to do it.
8537956	8538236	All right.
8541334	8542255	Am I getting pathetic?
8542375	8544657	Is this turning into a begging and groveling a bit too much?
8544717	8545037	I don't know.
8545077	8546699	I just really want to see my grandma game.
8548520	8548761	All right.
8549021	8549702	You're so funny.
8549962	8550222	I know.
8551303	8551603	Okay.
8551843	8556528	This one is from Rababa about Test Drive Unlimited 2.
8556588	8562093	It says, I was a big fan of the original Test Drive Unlimited and we had an OL Army clubhouse.
8562153	8563794	Joystick shows the demo reel here.
8565336	8569160	Um, it doesn't look like Lost Islands Oahu setting, at least not from the video.
8569661	8575108	It does look a lot more types of driving events, but the character models are The Sims 2-ish still.
8575769	8578572	It releases in fall amongst the big titles, so I hope it does well.
8578672	8580895	I never did get to play my 5,000 miles in the first one.
8581718	8582738	I remember Test Drive.
8582758	8583818	That was a pretty neat game.
8585559	8588220	It's taken them long enough to kind of put out news of a sequel.
8588660	8588920	I don't know.
8588960	8589840	I'll play it if it's good.
8590440	8594161	But it's going to be tough because there's so many racing games coming out that I'm so interested in, you know.
8594221	8596982	But, well, that'll be a ways out.
8597622	8597962	By the way.
8598342	8598742	That's it.
8599382	8607464	Going back to the email from YYR, Actdeft says, you can call it Golden Age Grannies Killing Spree.
8608324	8610425	The prize has to still be cheesecake.
8610885	8611105	Yes.
8612891	8616013	Granny's with a Z. I made a game with Granny's in it.
8616633	8618094	All right, there was our mailbag.
8618134	8618714	Now it's time.
8618974	8619854	Imagine Granny's.
8623256	8625237	I know this is a little outside of the box for you.
8625337	8631940	I know this is not a retro game or inspired by other stuff, but I'm telling you, instant cash machine.
8632340	8633721	All right, let's get into the FUs of the week.
8650378	8655621	F you to, um, caffeine withdrawal headaches.
8656602	8657723	They stink.
8659544	8660204	Yeah.
8661245	8661545	Loki?
8664266	8672851	Um, I guess F you to my neighbor's bushes for still being alive even after I dumped a half gallon of weed killer on him.
8674832	8675613	Damn you, weeds!
8676218	8679540	Oh, I will kill them.
8680481	8682022	I don't really have much of an FU of the week.
8682102	8684163	I'm, again, in fairly good spirits.
8684243	8688986	I will say FU to me being such a procrastinator because I procrastinated on something big time.
8689006	8691367	I really should have gotten taken care of a lot sooner, but whatever.
8691607	8692288	Hey, you know what?
8693649	8694189	Life goes on.
8695017	8697718	Alright, there's worse things that could happen in the world.
8698899	8699519	Let's move on.
8700300	8701761	We got a couple more stories for you guys.
8701781	8703221	Then the listless results.
8703802	8705302	And then the Skype line.
8705943	8707864	And listless, by the way, I will say this about listless.
8708164	8709865	This doesn't happen very often in listless.
8710345	8713706	But every single answer tonight got at least one vote.
8714066	8715026	Every single answer.
8715146	8717687	Usually something gets shut out, but it's going to be a close one tonight.
8717747	8719207	So hopefully you guys all voted.
8719387	8721627	If not, you got like 30 seconds left.
8722108	8724548	Loki, what do you got for us while we wrap things up?
8724588	8725468	Stop playing that game.
8725488	8726268	What are you playing now?
8726308	8727569	Nothing.
8727969	8728509	Yes, you are.
8728529	8732910	You're playing that freaking Contra in Castlevania meets Super Mario Brothers and...
8733510	8734230	Oh my crap.
8760819	8769185	And, um, I guess it has parodies of, uh, fighters from King of Fighters, Tekken, Virtua Fighter, Street Fighter, you name it.
8769345	8773448	And, of course, um, each character has their own special abilities.
8773989	8783015	These, for example, uh, Rana, who is covered in massage oil, which she uses to rub on herself on, uh, other fighters and, uh, slip past their punches.
8784016	8786417	Um, or they have, um, some other people who...
8787378	8798480	Throw vibrators and whatnot, but it's a game where they basically get their clothes ripped off as they're fighting.
8799760	8800040	Awesome.
8801781	8803261	Only playable in Japan, I'm afraid.
8804081	8805261	Oh, what a big surprise.
8805882	8807542	A game like that's never going to come out here?
8807662	8808322	What a shock.
8809622	8813283	They have some screenshots, and it's interesting, I guess.
8814284	8818385	Amaze Satsuma in our chatroom says, Super Strip Fighter, isn't that called Dead or Alive?
8819365	8822026	Ba-dum-bum, ba-dum-bum, everybody's a comedian here at OLR.
8823806	8831668	Oh, Orange Lounge Radio, of course, as you know, started about a little game called DDR and the other types of music games that were out there in a series called Bomani.
8831988	8832469	Well, guess what?
8832489	8837610	The Bomani series is still alive, so we want to take our last story tonight to show you guys...
8838610	8839730	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8863557	8864678	It's made out of widescreen.
8886846	8890968	If you hit it, then it changes to the color of the player and bounces right back to the opponent.
8891669	8898292	The rate at which it will move will depend on the music, so if it's a slow BPM, then the note will move slowly, and so on and so on.
8898572	8901153	There's hold notes, chain notes, and so forth.
8901193	8908056	They say it's also a lot like Boom Boom Rocket, if you've ever played that on Xbox Live, with the whole bar and the exploding fireworks.
8908477	8914880	Some of the songs in the game, there's a remix of Star Mine, 777, a song called Juicy,
8915740	8916780	I'll leave that to your imagination.
8916841	8918521	And Silence, so on and so on.
8918601	8921903	So Reflect Beat, a new game in the Bomani series.
8921923	8926385	There's even some pictures that are posted around there on the internets so you can see what this game looks like.
8927765	8930686	It kind of looks like DJ Max Technica a little bit.
8930746	8932747	That's what I was totally thinking when I saw it.
8933067	8937169	I wonder if they're stealing the idea a little bit there.
8937209	8938470	Isn't it funny how that works out?
8938970	8940771	Konami steal a music game idea?
8941211	8942011	Rock Revolution?
8942111	8942531	What?
8943492	8943752	All right.
8945089	8945409	Whatever.
8946569	8947030	There it is.
8947810	8948950	We don't write it, we just report it.
8949010	8949730	Reflect Beat.
8950431	8953212	Probably never coming to an arcade near you unless you live in Japan.
8953832	8957313	Alright, let's get to the listless results.
8957473	8961154	Yes, the listless results and who won tonight's listless.
8965175	8970017	As you know, tonight was all about what versus Capcom game would you like to see next.
8970637	8972698	And we had a lot of votes in our chat room.
8975767	8977248	In the end, only one could win.
8979808	8981549	But for fun, we'll read you the top three.

9013508	9014889	Konami versus Capcom.
9015530	9016811	There it is, the definitive list.

9044972	9047152	Anyhow, the Skype line is now open.
9047172	9057574	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you wish to give us a call and talk about anything you've heard about on the show tonight or I suppose anything else if you want.
9058194	9062435	All right, Loki, you have any last minute stories or are you just going to play your little Capcom?
9062515	9063555	Why was I playing this game?
9063595	9067196	Yeah, I'm sure there's stuff I could talk about here.
9067276	9067856	Let's see.
9067876	9067916	Um...
9079257	9079517	Oh, yes.
9080097	9080297	Hi.
9081717	9083378	The Record of Argus War.
9083598	9085559	Apparently, it's too hot for GameStop.
9085859	9088519	They have decided to put it behind the counter like porno.
9090360	9100123	And apparently, they said, and this was actually an email that went out to the stores, please place Record of Argus War Limited Edition behind the cash wrap.
9101303	9105125	If a customer inquires about the game, let the customer know you have it in stock.
9105425	9106325	What's so bad about it?
9106878	9110219	It has, like, suggestive looking pictures on the outside.
9110239	9111620	Oops, sorry, we picked up a call.
9111640	9112620	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9112640	9113000	Who's this?
9114460	9116541	This is DS Master 26.
9116801	9121343	All right, DarkSakura yelled disconnect.
9124103	9125844	DarkSakura vetoed that call.
9131287	9132309	Oh, sorry, sir.
9132749	9133090	All right.
9133811	9134512	You are not.
9135013	9135314	You're right.
9135354	9136896	I'm not.
9136916	9137717	877-KMOLR.
9137798	9139440	Use name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9139500	9142045	Unless you're DS Master, then you just don't want to call in.
9142565	9142866	All right.
9146164	9148565	Let's see, what other fun stuff can we talk about here?
9149065	9149746	Oh, this is kind of neat.
9149786	9152807	I tried this a little bit earlier this week, but it crashed my computer.
9153327	9159089	But Instant Action, it's a game service that they sell a bunch of different PC games.
9159469	9164531	They actually have a new thing now where you can embed game demos into webpages.
9164971	9167432	So, say, for example, the example shown.
9168112	9188772	The Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition You can embed a 20 minute free trial into a webpage and get tested out Fortunately when I did that on my work computer it crashed I don't blame the website, I blame my computer because it sucks It's too bad Um
9192327	9195830	Some games that are going to be coming out later in the month.
9196810	9201213	Raystorm HD is supposed to be making its way out on May 5th as well as Xenoclash.
9202755	9205416	And then, of course, those are both on Xbox Live Arcade.
9206037	9215063	Rocket Knight, the remake there, is supposed to be making its way out on May 12th on Xbox Live Arcade and Steam and then May 18th on the PlayStation Network.
9215303	9215964	So that's kind of cool.
9220578	9220878	I don't know.
9222400	9225182	And, yeah, that's pretty much it.
9227524	9228765	What is up with Skype?
9229005	9231087	Like, last week, nobody wanted to call.
9231907	9234289	Like, wow.
9234530	9236311	They're too busy playing Super Mario.
9236351	9237032	What is up?
9237212	9241856	Like, a couple weeks ago, we were getting, like, seven calls at once.
9241916	9242756	It was insane.
9243097	9244378	Freaking call us, people.
9244398	9245258	What?
9247096	9248396	DarkSakura's already mad.
9248476	9248857	Now.
9249137	9249457	I know.
9249897	9252238	Maybe they're afraid we're going to hang up on them too.
9252358	9254458	We're not going to hang up on you unless you're DS Master.
9254679	9258140	Alright, let's see what's... You know what's so funny?
9258560	9262221	A phone call was coming in and the minute DarkSakura said that, it disappeared.
9273152	9273972	Alright, I don't know.
9274613	9275793	Are we just going to sit here and wait?
9275813	9280395	I don't want people to call us, please.
9281976	9283737	Don't make me use the little girl voice.
9285518	9286598	Somebody's offering to call in.
9286678	9287599	Damn it, call!
9287959	9288379	Well, hold on.
9288419	9289539	Maybe we'll get a call here in a minute.
9289559	9290940	We'll just be nice and wait.
9290980	9291840	See, now a phone number.
9292301	9292981	Now a call's coming in.
9293441	9294462	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.
9294482	9294882	Who's this?
9296195	9297776	Hey, this is SSJ100Matt.
9297836	9299277	Hey, SSJ100Matt.
9299337	9302319	Thank you so much for... Hi.
9302339	9303840	Thank you for not being DSMaster.
9303960	9304560	How are you?
9307042	9307983	I'm doing very good.
9308483	9309183	So, tell us.
9309464	9317989	Look, I know you're kind of buds with YYR, Aaron, you know, the guy behind Snake360, following all that fun stuff, and who sent us the gold star email tonight.
9318550	9320691	Is he serious, or is he just fucking with us?
9324515	9325135	I plead the fifth.
9327176	9327757	You're killing me.
9327797	9332919	Look, I'm just saying, go back to him and say, hey, you don't have to make it a Golden Girls game.
9332959	9334620	It's Grandma's Got Guns.
9335921	9337061	Well, let me tell you something.
9337081	9341924	When you were reading the email and with all the comments, I texted him saying, hey, people want this game.
9343505	9344565	He hasn't texted me back.
9346046	9347627	All right, fair enough.
9347827	9348307	You tried.
9348787	9349728	You get an A for effort.
9350909	9351169	All right.
9352443	9354085	Well, what else is on your mind tonight?
9354105	9355446	What kind of video games have you been playing this week?
9357167	9360050	Actually, I called in to do a giveaway right this very second.
9360110	9361071	Holy crap!
9361231	9361652	I want it!
9361672	9362472	Gimme, gimme, gimme!
9364654	9364955	What is it?
9364975	9365895	What are you giving away tonight?
9366056	9374764	Actually, you know, what I'm giving away is... Back at PAX East, I was given an Avatar download code.
9375784	9376665	Oh, is it one of the...
9378177	9379017	It's an Avatar hoodie.
9379318	9380818	It's a PAX East Avatar hoodie.
9380918	9382279	Even I didn't get one of those.
9382419	9383820	And you're going to give it away to a listener?
9385460	9386801	Yes, I'm going to give it away to a listener.
9386861	9389022	God, I hope DS Master wins it, just to make you mad.
9389202	9390743	All right, well, how are you going to give this away?
9392163	9400387	I'm going to do a quick trivia question on a game that just came out that me and Wawa are actually battling with after Burner Climax.
9400807	9402168	Ooh, okay, fair enough.
9402528	9406970	And if somebody knows the answer, I assume they're going to, what, send you a private message in chat or something?
9408021	9409862	No, they're just going to spam chat.
9410022	9411242	Oh, spam chat.
9411422	9415124	Okay, first to yell out in chat, and then we'll see who won, because you're watching chat right now.
9415164	9417705	All right, what is the question?
9417725	9423307	All right, the question is, Yu Suzuki is the creator of Afterburner.
9424408	9428249	Now, Afterburner made an appearance in another Yu Suzuki game.
9428710	9429490	Which game is that?
9430603	9430823	Go.
9431444	9432825	Jeopardy?
9433525	9434806	I don't have Jeopardy.
9434846	9437067	Chuck Norris is not the answer, Bobby Blackwolf.
9437107	9437388	All right.
9437848	9442611	Well, I don't have the theme song to Jeopardy or anything like that, but I do have this for game show music.
9463994	9465955	People need to be more specific.
9465995	9467556	They almost have the answer.
9467876	9473540	There's like four people shouted out Shenmue, Daytona USA, Bayonetta.
9473560	9476162	Oh, Loki got it.
9476242	9476562	Loki!
9476582	9476942	Loki!
9476982	9477202	Loki!
9483675	9484075	I cheated.
9484255	9484856	No, I didn't cheat.
9485056	9486236	These will be more specific.
9486696	9487137	Shenmue 2?
9487357	9489078	Loki, you are not eligible.
9489158	9490758	You are a host of this program.
9491199	9491879	Do another question.
9492379	9493560	You need to do another question.
9493660	9495721	Loki, keep your hands... Another question.
9495761	9496881	Play your stupid game.
9498122	9499582	New question, new question.
9499602	9500683	Hold on, I'm going to put new question.
9503384	9505585	No, you... What?
9505985	9508186	You know, I did not expect Loki to ruin it.
9508407	9510027	I know, Loki ruins everything.
9510127	9511108	God, Loki...
9513257	9514598	I'll help you come up with a new question.
9514779	9515519	You want a new question?
9516921	9517501	Yeah, you know what?
9517521	9518663	Yeah, come up with a new question.
9520344	9520604	All right.
9521425	9521706	All right.
9521966	9522426	I know, Matt.
9522466	9524228	Now look how much you've upset Matt.
9524749	9525730	You need to apologize.
9525770	9526230	No, no, no.
9526270	9527011	You didn't upset me.
9527031	9530895	You know, the thing was, it was my fault because I just saw the answer.
9531474	9533455	I said Shenmue 2 when I saw Loki next to him.
9533475	9534175	I'm like, shit.
9537857	9538318	Shit.
9538938	9539298	Alright.
9540599	9541099	Here you go.
9543220	9552025	According to my source that I'm looking at right now, what type of airplane do you fly in Afterburner?
9553286	9554286	That's a good question, right?
9555307	9555867	Yeah, there you go.
9558772	9562276	What type of plane do you fly in After Burner?
9567462	9568803	A big plane will not work.
9568823	9571947	A boat!
9572607	9573428	You're not on a boat.
9574449	9576552	What type of plane do you fly in After Burner?
9578135	9580758	Oh, oh, oh, oh, Dark Tetsuya got it.
9580858	9582540	It's an F-14 Tomcat.
9582880	9583701	There you go.
9583721	9584342	There you go.
9584362	9585523	Dark Tetsuya got it.
9585783	9586584	And there you go.
9586664	9590548	Even though he's sort of on OLR staff, at least he's not one of the hosts of the freaking show.
9591309	9591870	So there you go.
9593806	9594727	Dark Tetsuya wins.
9595507	9596387	Congrats, DT.
9596467	9597828	You get the code.
9597888	9598829	Applause for DT.
9598929	9599549	He's a winner.
9600069	9601850	The rest of you, I'm sorry, you lose.
9602350	9602651	Alright.
9604392	9605392	We love giveaways.
9606493	9606793	Go ahead.

9622776	9630939	I was so busy having sand in my vagina over Game Room and then playing stuff on my new video card that I totally forgot about Afterburner, so I need to check it out.

9657413	9658813	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9658893	9660634	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9660674	9662134	Did we run out of last-minute stories, Loki?
9663795	9665015	Ones that I wanted to talk about.
9665055	9667856	There's just, you know... Well, how about the ones you didn't want to talk about?
9669117	9670017	I don't want to talk about them.
9670217	9670657	Okay, fine.
9673809	9674509	I wasn't paying attention.
9674589	9676090	Let's go to the B-sides tonight.
9676130	9679692	Let's go to the B-sides stories and see what's going on there.
9680072	9680912	The B-sides?
9680932	9682433	No, you got saved by a phone call.
9682493	9683394	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9683414	9683754	Who's this?
9684614	9687256	Good evening, O-U-O-N-R.
9687896	9688776	Good evening.
9689276	9689657	How are you?
9690437	9690837	Oh, I don't know.
9693530	9697231	Well, when the fuck did I get a German accent?
9697591	9699052	Oh, well.
9699612	9699952	I don't know.
9700372	9703734	Well, how are you and your German accent this fine week?
9705214	9705814	I'm just fine.
9706054	9707695	Well, kind of.
9708275	9708975	Well, what's on your mind?
9709096	9710176	What do we owe the phone call to?
9711897	9712237	Sims 3.
9713677	9718459	That's annoying when it locks up.
9719579	9721540	How do you feel about Sims 3 coming to consoles?
9722715	9736994	I, uh, say almost, uh, yay and dem kinda, uh, well, oh, well, it's gonna be, it's gonna be get dumbed down and, which is boo-hoo.
9738035	9757118	But here's the other thing, though, is that, well, lucky us, for us hardcore Sims players, the new expansion set, Ambitions, will hit the PC before we get Sims 3 on the console.
9759363	9759723	Hmm.
9760143	9763965	Yeah, because Sims 3 on the console is going to probably be a ways out, especially if we're just hearing about it now.
9764005	9766666	You know, I haven't heard DarkSakura talk about Sims 3 in a long time.
9766706	9768766	I've actually been sitting here uninstalling my Sims 3.
9769166	9770667	Oh, did all the talk about it tonight?
9771107	9779050	Well, no, because what's been going on is because I have a lot of mods in my game, I have to completely reinstall and delete my registries.
9780190	9782311	So, yeah, and it decided to fart on me, so...
9784074	9784754	I have a question.
9784854	9791938	DarkSakura, actually, how do you... Registry erasing?
9792078	9792878	What the hell?
9793178	9793819	How do you do that?
9794479	9795239	How do you do that?
9799302	9805585	Because my current problem in Sim 3 is that my school building is borked.
9806823	9814868	They can be in the school building for like two minutes, and then they just stop.
9815449	9816889	I don't know, I have no idea.
9818450	9821532	That's something that you're probably going to have to check on the Sims 3 forum for.
9824454	9826956	I've never had that problem, so I don't know how to help with it.
9828055	9830616	What's supposed to be coming in this next Sims 3 expansion?
9831696	9833777	What's the big thing that they're going to do with this?
9836078	9840959	Like, apparently they're going to make a move to make...
9843963	9862246	Make a move on those players that never leave the sim creator or where they just build lots and never play the actual sims game.
9863325	9864326	Oh, they're happy doing that.
9864346	9866368	I don't understand why they're going to ruin that.
9867069	9868570	Get out and play the game, dammit.
9869291	9870753	What if I just want to build stuff?
9871213	9873555	It's like, never mind, really.
9874737	9874857	It's...
9875982	9876782	It's interesting, though.
9876822	9882025	You know, there's a lot going on in... I don't want to compare The Sims 3 to WoW, but I will.
9883125	9891108	There's a lot going on in WoW right now where they're really changing up the game, and they're changing it in some big, big ways, and it's kind of causing the player base to have some rabble rabble.
9891469	9901973	Although Blizzard changes big shit with every patch, and everything works out just fine, but I guess the big, big thing that's causing rabble rabble is that now the 10-man and 25-man raids are going to share the same lockout.
9902213	9902814	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9917310	9946015	so you know big changes to the game but sometimes it works out for the better so in a way and you know I'm relating this back to Sims 3 I promise you know if they're going to change some of the core elements of the game maybe it's just because they kind of see the habits of the players right now and they kind of want to course people into looking at this whole other part of the game that they've developed that nobody's looking at and also a thing that's apparently coming with the new expansion is that there's going to be apparently natural disasters
9947599	9948420	That'll be fun!
9948820	9954022	Now there you go, that kind of... There we have something really interesting.
9954643	9973512	Now that kind of reminds me... If that would happen, not that... Because, well, the optimal would be if they made a... Well, what's the... I think it's actually called the Sims... Well, the Seasons expansion that they made for Sims 2.
9974133	9974413	Since...
9974733	9981797	Well, since I'm like a snow person, I would love to have my Sims playing in snow.
9982998	9985359	But here's the problem.
9988421	9992644	The problem that I would have with that is that my current Sims house
9993904	10010238	is not is not exactly a winter house because they would free would freeze if so were the case if you have to have walls around everything since I'm like I'm having like one bed here one bed there all the all in the opening
10011519	10014241	I hope the expansion works out okay for you.
10041209	10041549	Yeah, well.
10041829	10042189	All right.
10042349	10042830	Take care, buddy.
10044270	10044590	All right.
10045751	10047051	And we'll go ahead and wrap up there.
10047091	10056334	That'll be our last call tonight because we want to go and wrap stuff up and get to our afterbirth, the part of the show that's not podcast, you know, nothing to.
10056635	10060436	You see, you got to join us for a live show to know what that's all about, but don't worry.
10060956	10062277	You're not missing too much.
10062317	10063077	We wouldn't do that to you.
10063477	10065938	But we want to get to that and wrap things up and get out of here tonight.
10066519	10068419	But first, we've got to thank all you guys for listening tonight.
10069000	10072161	Were there any other last-minute stories, though, before I get to that, Loki, real quick?
10072741	10072881	Nope.
10073121	10073922	DarkSakura, nothing?
10073962	10074222	All right.
10074742	10081085	Then let me take an opportunity to say thank you guys so much for downloading our show and tuning in to us or tuning in to us live, however you choose to listen to OLR.
10081445	10082206	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10103038	10105180	My final thought is new video card.
10105220	10106141	Yay!
10106242	10106822	Dragon Age.
10106862	10107283	Yay!
10107403	10108164	Loki, your final thought.
10110346	10114851	With the power of hot swapping, I will once again be able to play my crazy Grand Theft Auto games.
10115458	10116218	Yay!
10116418	10116738	Alright.
10117519	10119799	Thank you guys so much for listening to our show.
10120119	10122000	We're going to be back next week to do it all again.
10122140	10125301	More news, more chatters, more stuff, more antics.
10125721	10126481	It'll be a good time.
10126521	10128462	Thank you guys so much for downloading our show.
10128982	10129702	That's it, right?
10129962	10130482	Nothing else?
10131022	10132003	I guess we'll see you next week.
10132243	10132903	Have a good one, everybody.
10133871	10134391	See you next week!
10164882	10166113	Thanks for watching!
