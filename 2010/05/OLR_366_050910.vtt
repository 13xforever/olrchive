WEBVTT

00:14.020 --> 00:23.594
[SPEAKER_11]: Tonight, May 9th, 2010, StarCraft II gets a release date, Nintendo promises to increase anti-piracy measures on the 3DS, and a sequel to LittleBigPlanet gets confirmed.

00:31.636 --> 00:40.023
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, my friends, and welcome to episode number 366 of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.

00:40.483 --> 00:46.949
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:47.149 --> 00:47.209
[SPEAKER_09]: Mmm.

00:48.772 --> 00:49.152
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

00:50.914 --> 00:52.215
[SPEAKER_09]: Filled with food, apparently.

00:52.235 --> 00:54.077
[SPEAKER_09]: I had nummies.

00:54.558 --> 00:57.701
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you talked about this on the show, your new diet, a little bit?

00:58.121 --> 00:58.922
[SPEAKER_15]: A little bit, yeah.

00:59.002 --> 01:03.406
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not really so much of a diet anymore as a full-on lifestyle change.

01:04.654 --> 01:06.415
[SPEAKER_15]: I got sick of getting sick every time I eat.

01:07.255 --> 01:09.636
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I can't eat anything without being stuck.

01:09.856 --> 01:10.537
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to say it.

01:11.077 --> 01:12.958
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything makes me constipated.

01:14.078 --> 01:14.438
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything.

01:14.998 --> 01:16.159
[SPEAKER_09]: You just need more Metamucil.

01:16.639 --> 01:16.779
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

01:16.959 --> 01:18.660
[SPEAKER_09]: Or McDonald's.

01:18.680 --> 01:19.760
[SPEAKER_15]: That made me throw up.

01:19.780 --> 01:22.341
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the voice over there, the one and only Tech Master, Loki.

01:22.361 --> 01:23.162
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you doing, Loki?

01:23.782 --> 01:26.003
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm fine, but I think I've eaten too much.

01:26.303 --> 01:27.364
[SPEAKER_07]: It's weird because...

01:28.484 --> 01:29.165
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

01:39.995 --> 01:40.836
[SPEAKER_15]: Blessing in Disguise

02:09.878 --> 02:11.639
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura.com

02:32.819 --> 02:36.321
[SPEAKER_07]: We discovered Smashburger and there went everything.

02:37.181 --> 02:40.102
[SPEAKER_07]: So this weekend's been bad.

02:40.623 --> 02:49.427
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, so now I'm trying to eat my Twists and I'm shoving the last piece down my throat because I'm full.

02:50.017 --> 02:52.458
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're so delicious, I can't let them go to waste.

02:52.478 --> 02:54.539
[SPEAKER_09]: They're good stuff, and they make the whole room smell yummy.

02:55.219 --> 02:58.160
[SPEAKER_13]: May I say one thing so that I don't leave what I was saying on the word constipated?

02:58.260 --> 03:02.562
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, of course, I know, sorry.

03:02.602 --> 03:04.282
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm eating 70 to 80% raw now.

03:05.303 --> 03:06.443
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, certain things I'll have cooked.

03:07.203 --> 03:11.725
[SPEAKER_15]: And I finally have gotten to the point where I'm trying to see where I can go out to eat.

03:12.725 --> 03:14.706
[SPEAKER_15]: So far, Persian food is out if I eat meat.

03:17.047 --> 03:20.349
[SPEAKER_15]: Chevys is kind of okay, but I have to be careful of corn chips.

03:20.369 --> 03:21.089
[SPEAKER_15]: Corn chips make me sick.

03:21.430 --> 03:23.571
[SPEAKER_15]: This morning I had eggs and they didn't make me sick.

03:24.231 --> 03:26.072
[SPEAKER_15]: So now I know what I can eat.

03:26.755 --> 03:28.376
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

03:50.410 --> 03:51.151
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

04:09.274 --> 04:09.594
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

04:09.654 --> 04:12.575
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think of the Warcraft episode of South Park and that guy.

04:13.155 --> 04:17.076
[SPEAKER_15]: Eating Cheetos off your chest playing Halo 2.

04:17.336 --> 04:24.639
[SPEAKER_09]: But how easy is it, though, to sit there and play a game like Halo 2 or whatever it is you play and go through a whole bag of Doritos?

04:25.199 --> 04:28.080
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not the smartest lifestyle.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.341
[SPEAKER_15]: That's called idle eating.

04:29.921 --> 04:31.802
[SPEAKER_15]: And I do it when I'm working.

04:32.302 --> 04:34.223
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I've been working on my homework for my finals.

04:34.243 --> 04:38.526
[SPEAKER_15]: Because my finals next week, ooh, which are all projects, so that means I have a lot of crap to do.

04:39.446 --> 04:43.088
[SPEAKER_15]: But the biggest thing that I always loved is I loved eating blue corn chips.

04:43.748 --> 04:46.229
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, just chomping away because I would feel too...

04:48.079 --> 04:51.302
[SPEAKER_15]: I would get distracted from other stuff without something for my mouth to do or something.

04:51.883 --> 04:55.226
[SPEAKER_15]: And now I have pecans and goji berries that I snack on.

04:56.046 --> 04:58.188
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me give you my piece of dieting advice.

04:58.228 --> 05:00.450
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that I'm one that really should be giving out dieting advice.

05:00.850 --> 05:04.774
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's my tip for those of you that want to defy the gamer stereotype.

05:04.814 --> 05:08.777
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is one really easy thing you can do that will really cut back on a lot of this.

05:09.038 --> 05:10.259
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, kind of a two-part thing.

05:10.559 --> 05:13.602
[SPEAKER_09]: A, if you're eating Doritos, Ruffles, Lays, whatever...

05:14.202 --> 05:16.503
[SPEAKER_09]: See if you can't switch to something lower fat.

05:16.824 --> 05:24.248
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, even if it's just the baked version or pretzels are a really, really good substitute as long as you're not getting the ranch pretzels and all that.

05:24.428 --> 05:25.028
[SPEAKER_09]: Carrots and hummus.

05:27.098 --> 05:29.520
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think a lot of people are going to go that extreme.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.001
[SPEAKER_09]: Certainly that would be ideal.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.382
[SPEAKER_09]: Or pita chips and hummus.

05:32.923 --> 05:33.823
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's the other tip.

05:34.424 --> 05:36.866
[SPEAKER_09]: Put it in a bowl before you take it to the living room.

05:37.466 --> 05:41.669
[SPEAKER_09]: That way you're rationing off a certain size and you don't go through a whole bag in one sitting.

05:42.130 --> 05:42.750
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not perfect.

05:43.050 --> 05:46.213
[SPEAKER_09]: I downed a whole bag of fortune cookies over the weekend because they're really good.

05:46.973 --> 05:48.354
[SPEAKER_09]: They sell like flat fortune cookies.

05:48.394 --> 05:49.415
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like sugar paper.

05:49.435 --> 05:50.376
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, they're so good though.

05:50.396 --> 05:51.236
[SPEAKER_15]: With orange flavoring.

05:51.677 --> 05:52.677
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know how it goes.

05:53.038 --> 05:53.938
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not always perfect.

05:54.018 --> 05:55.920
[SPEAKER_09]: But that would be my tip.

05:56.280 --> 06:24.272
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want to be better when you're gaming And for anyone who is curious about how eating raw has affected me in other ways After my birthday, you know all that beer and cake that I consumed all week Because I had a lot of beer and cake left over I had gone, with my eating less thing, I had gone down 3 pounds And then I put back on 8 or 9 And now I'm back to where I was before my birthday So that means I've lost...

06:26.073 --> 06:29.095
[SPEAKER_15]: I've lost about eight pounds in a week.

06:29.855 --> 06:30.495
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations.

06:30.515 --> 06:31.976
[SPEAKER_09]: Hope it can keep going for you.

06:32.016 --> 06:32.957
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've been eating more.

06:33.577 --> 06:34.638
[SPEAKER_15]: For the record, I've been eating more.

06:34.858 --> 06:37.099
[SPEAKER_09]: But more vegetables and stuff.

06:37.299 --> 06:39.100
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been eating a lot of vegetables.

06:39.240 --> 06:40.821
[SPEAKER_15]: And I like bananas now, Rob.

06:42.342 --> 06:43.802
[SPEAKER_15]: I used to only like banana-flavored things.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.303
[SPEAKER_15]: Now I actually like bananas.

06:45.763 --> 06:46.884
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'll give everyone a quick recipe.

06:46.904 --> 06:47.564
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a quick one.

06:47.664 --> 06:48.785
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, hurry, because we've got to get to games.

06:48.945 --> 06:50.766
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, what kind of games have you been playing this week?

07:18.844 --> 07:25.372
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually started off playing Final Fantasy 2, finally, I got around, and I like it Oh, like the iPhone one?

07:25.392 --> 07:32.801
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, the iPhone one The control's pretty interesting, and sometimes it doesn't want to actually go where I tell it to go But maybe it's because I've got big fat thumbs, I don't know

07:33.792 --> 07:36.533
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet it plays better on a 3GS than it does the 3G too.

07:36.693 --> 07:39.175
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it has a slightly faster processor and those things, right?

07:39.255 --> 07:39.755
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.

07:39.955 --> 07:41.035
[SPEAKER_15]: It plays smoothly.

07:41.496 --> 07:41.776
[SPEAKER_09]: No problem.

07:41.796 --> 07:43.897
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I have a 3G and I have issues.

07:43.917 --> 07:44.437
[SPEAKER_15]: You can try mine.

07:45.157 --> 07:45.557
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I will.

07:45.878 --> 07:46.678
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

07:46.758 --> 07:56.643
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I actually, while we were waiting to get into the stupid restaurant this morning, because seriously we were waiting for like an hour, I just finally got bored and beat Espagluta again on my iPhone.

07:58.083 --> 08:03.167
[SPEAKER_15]: and I played some Star Trek Online.

08:03.267 --> 08:03.847
[SPEAKER_15]: A little bit.

08:03.947 --> 08:07.850
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've been trying to fix my Sims and I think that I just have way too many mods so fuck it.

08:07.990 --> 08:08.871
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just not going to play Sims.

08:09.711 --> 08:12.193
[SPEAKER_09]: And DarkSakura is trying to sucker me into the world.

08:12.233 --> 08:16.175
[SPEAKER_09]: I should say back into the world because I did play the beta for a little bit of Star Trek Online.

08:16.195 --> 08:19.177
[SPEAKER_09]: She gave me a little 10 day code so I don't know.

08:19.718 --> 08:20.158
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

08:20.478 --> 08:20.879
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

08:21.119 --> 08:22.400
[SPEAKER_13]: Play for free with me.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.841
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've been saving stuff to give you.

08:26.022 --> 08:27.303
[SPEAKER_15]: Like stuff to add on your ship.

08:28.405 --> 08:29.987
[SPEAKER_09]: You know I've already addicted to one MMO.

08:30.007 --> 08:31.188
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I can get addicted to another.

08:31.228 --> 08:31.589
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

08:31.629 --> 08:31.909
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

08:32.430 --> 08:44.925
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it was on the show or not, but there's that, remember they're doing now like an unlimited trial basically where you can go play the first couple tutorial levels or whatever and spend as much time you want doing that.

08:45.105 --> 08:45.725
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Star Trek?

08:45.766 --> 08:46.887
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that was one of the others.

08:47.047 --> 08:47.908
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's Star Trek Online.

08:48.028 --> 08:48.288
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

08:49.397 --> 08:49.697
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

09:13.831 --> 09:15.852
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to win 500 games in a row.

09:16.712 --> 09:18.353
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, probably more like 1,000 games in a row.

09:18.613 --> 09:19.893
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm working on that.

09:20.053 --> 09:23.915
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm about five now.

09:25.435 --> 09:26.036
[SPEAKER_07]: Doing a good job.

09:27.956 --> 09:35.699
[SPEAKER_07]: With how high I am on the TrueSkill leaderboard right now, if I lose a game, it bumps me down about five to ten ranks.

09:36.459 --> 09:40.421
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have to win about five games to go up a rank.

09:41.401 --> 09:43.763
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really frustrating when I get in.

09:44.664 --> 09:51.730
[SPEAKER_07]: Not necessarily lose a game, because losing basically just by a few bucks would be considered a loss.

09:51.790 --> 09:59.037
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, if you beat people, say if you don't win the game, but you beat three people, that still counts towards going up the leaderboards.

09:59.757 --> 10:03.680
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, but I have been playing perfect games though.

10:04.080 --> 10:09.344
[SPEAKER_07]: So much so that it's been pissing off my coworkers and they actually threatened to pull the Ethernet one time.

10:09.384 --> 10:12.946
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, they did for a second and plugged it back in.

10:13.046 --> 10:13.967
[SPEAKER_07]: I got pissed off at them.

10:14.027 --> 10:17.930
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, hey, I'm pretty high up there.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.871
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like rank 70 right now.

10:20.111 --> 10:23.874
[SPEAKER_07]: And 70 out of 60,000 people is pretty damn good, if you ask me.

10:26.135 --> 10:26.676
[SPEAKER_07]: And then...

10:27.406 --> 10:28.587
[SPEAKER_08]: Me, me, me, me, I'm the best.

10:28.627 --> 10:29.728
[SPEAKER_08]: Me, me, me, I'm the best.

10:29.748 --> 10:30.368
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey!

10:31.869 --> 10:32.590
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just messing.

10:32.610 --> 10:33.971
[SPEAKER_07]: The leaderboards say so.

10:34.111 --> 10:36.993
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a leaderboard thing this week, too, and I'll get into that in a minute.

10:37.113 --> 10:38.273
[SPEAKER_07]: And I work really hard for it.

10:38.954 --> 10:48.841
[SPEAKER_07]: Trust me, if anybody plays actually Grand Theft Auto out there on the ranked games, you have to know how hard it is to get an actual game with people in it.

10:49.421 --> 10:54.404
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on top of that, getting a game where you finish with everybody still...

10:55.805 --> 10:59.108
[SPEAKER_07]: in the game because a lot of people rage quit out of all these games.

10:59.849 --> 11:02.551
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially the games I'm in because I kick the crap out of them.

11:02.571 --> 11:06.094
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm surprised you don't get penalized for that stuff.

11:06.374 --> 11:06.654
[SPEAKER_07]: You can.

11:07.214 --> 11:17.343
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically what you do is you go, if they quit out when you're done with the game, or during the game sometimes I'll do that, you go to their profile and you put review.

11:17.683 --> 11:18.944
[SPEAKER_09]: You can do that in any game though.

11:18.984 --> 11:19.164
[SPEAKER_09]: There's

11:19.484 --> 11:20.224
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

11:48.697 --> 11:54.681
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm better than everybody, I'm going to kick the crap out of anybody I had 33 kills, the person below me had 3 I had 33 kills, didn't you?

12:10.856 --> 12:12.957
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever, okay?

12:13.057 --> 12:15.498
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish someone would show me up, but no one's coming.

12:15.778 --> 12:18.760
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's the other 69 players ahead of you?

12:18.960 --> 12:19.360
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

12:19.720 --> 12:22.982
[SPEAKER_07]: But see, it's weird though, the true skill rankings, it's just win-losses.

12:23.102 --> 12:24.543
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a lot of people on there.

12:24.843 --> 12:26.163
[SPEAKER_07]: I play like 300-some games.

12:26.524 --> 12:32.446
[SPEAKER_07]: There's people on there that are above me that have played like 20 games, but they've just happened to win the majority of those 20 games.

12:33.607 --> 12:37.708
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I could create a new profile, win all the games, and then, oh, look at that, I'm at the top of the list.

12:37.728 --> 12:39.749
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's not playing fair.

12:40.749 --> 12:49.532
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so other than that, I'm actually now working on, we're going to go back to playing the modded games again because it's just too hard to find people to play with.

12:49.572 --> 12:56.174
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm looking and doing the research phase of a new modded Grand Theft Auto game.

12:56.194 --> 12:59.495
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm looking now on map editing and stuff like that because it's,

13:00.255 --> 13:03.960
[SPEAKER_07]: We gotta have ramps and stuff going to the moon, you know, basically in this game.

13:04.640 --> 13:07.844
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to edge it out a little bit more than it was last time.

13:08.625 --> 13:11.147
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm definitely looking forward to doing that.

13:12.048 --> 13:17.034
[SPEAKER_07]: And without modding the consoles, of course, we're gonna do the disc swap technique with that.

13:18.482 --> 13:31.195
[SPEAKER_07]: and then I just have a lot of games I'm waiting for Red Dead Redemption supposedly coming out in a few weeks so looking forward to that but have Alan Wake and Lost Planet 2 to get to and a whole bunch of stuff

13:33.257 --> 13:35.819
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, if you're done, then my gaming week.

13:36.319 --> 13:37.840
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and I joined the APB beta.

13:39.041 --> 13:43.643
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully, the beta requirements are a little bit more than what the actual game requires.

13:44.024 --> 13:51.188
[SPEAKER_07]: It says I need more RAM, even though I have Windows XP 3 2-bit, and I have 2 gigs of RAM, and Windows doesn't see really any more than that.

13:51.228 --> 13:54.490
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'll get like 2 point something gigs of RAM.

13:55.090 --> 13:56.551
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just need to get some more RAM.

13:56.591 --> 13:58.393
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably going to upgrade my graphics card as well.

13:59.913 --> 14:00.814
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking forward to that game.

14:01.434 --> 14:01.855
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

14:02.795 --> 14:06.177
[SPEAKER_09]: My gaming week, honestly, not a whole lot different than last week.

14:06.818 --> 14:10.200
[SPEAKER_09]: A little disappointing because I had so many games last week and this week not quite as many.

14:10.540 --> 14:11.981
[SPEAKER_09]: It was mostly the same stuff.

14:12.101 --> 14:17.304
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still enjoying my new video card with lots of World of Warcraft, of course, and Dragon Age a little bit here and there too.

14:17.885 --> 14:23.768
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably the only other newish thing I played was some of the new Game Room releases, although I guess that's not really new now, is it?

14:24.169 --> 14:25.389
[SPEAKER_09]: These games from 1981 and so forth.

14:26.550 --> 14:27.731
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen

14:46.229 --> 14:53.313
[SPEAKER_09]: So hopefully they're going to stick to that schedule and prove me wrong a little bit on some of the things last week, which is good, because there's a lot about Game Room I do like.

14:54.594 --> 15:01.658
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I think there's a lot of room for improvement, and I hope that that base engine for Game Room will not stay that way forever.

15:01.738 --> 15:03.298
[SPEAKER_09]: I do hope they make some upgrades to it.

15:04.379 --> 15:04.719
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.523
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

15:22.720 --> 15:23.820
[SPEAKER_09]: Pitfall is a timed game.

15:23.861 --> 15:27.502
[SPEAKER_09]: You only have 20 minutes tops to run through the jungle and collect as much treasure as you can.

15:27.842 --> 15:34.204
[SPEAKER_09]: So I played for the full 20 minutes without losing all my lives because some things you learn when you're five and you never forget.

15:34.504 --> 15:38.046
[SPEAKER_09]: And the thing I learned is how to get across that alligator pit when there's no vines.

15:38.566 --> 15:40.367
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the part of the game that usually trips people up.

15:40.747 --> 15:45.469
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I was able to get through there and I pretty much ran consistently for 20 minutes.

15:46.029 --> 15:46.369
[SPEAKER_09]: I go...

15:47.626 --> 15:48.826
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

16:08.432 --> 16:09.353
[SPEAKER_09]: That's if you get all the treasure.

16:09.753 --> 16:14.195
[SPEAKER_09]: I was only 400 points shy of being in the top 20 on the game room leaderboard at the time.

16:14.255 --> 16:15.495
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's gotten a lot harder now.

16:15.515 --> 16:17.436
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the minimum score is about 100,000 now.

16:18.957 --> 16:22.759
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just need to learn one thing I didn't know as a kid was how to navigate the tunnels.

16:23.099 --> 16:26.160
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought the tunnels were stupid because trying to get around the scorpions is kind of hard.

16:26.500 --> 16:34.404
[SPEAKER_09]: So I never really learned how to navigate the tunnels and my little five, six-year-old brain didn't understand a tunnel skips three regular screens.

16:34.844 --> 16:40.848
[SPEAKER_09]: So I didn't really learn the patterns that some people, I'm sure, memorized when they were younger, and that's how they're getting on the leaderboard now.

16:41.348 --> 16:44.370
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe I'll go back to that and try to actually play a better game.

16:44.390 --> 16:44.731
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

16:44.811 --> 16:50.434
[SPEAKER_09]: But other games I checked out this week on Game Room, Super Breakout, which I think kind of stinks.

16:50.674 --> 16:57.579
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I realize it was the first game like it, but I would much rather see a game like Arkanoid or something come to a Game Room.

16:57.619 --> 16:58.900
[SPEAKER_09]: And plus the controller...

16:59.460 --> 17:00.000
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

17:24.129 --> 17:40.445
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw on our chatroom By the way, join us in our chatroom if you're not already there We do tape live every week at All Games Radio www.allgames.com at 6pm Pacific right after the Bobby Blackwolf show But if you are listening to us live pull up a chair and join us in our chatroom chat.orangeloungeradio.com And TigerClaw actually says

17:40.905 --> 17:41.585
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

18:04.156 --> 18:04.477
[SPEAKER_09]: No kill screen!

18:21.719 --> 18:22.200
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm joking.

18:43.143 --> 18:44.323
[SPEAKER_09]: is also on Game Room this week.

18:44.603 --> 18:46.624
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was kind of a funny shooter game.

18:47.005 --> 18:48.145
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a little silly.

18:48.185 --> 18:52.607
[SPEAKER_09]: You could say it's Space Invaders-esque, but basically objects are falling from the sky or they float in the sky.

18:52.948 --> 18:53.608
[SPEAKER_09]: You shoot them.

18:54.849 --> 19:06.334
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little more challenging, I think, in some ways in Space Invaders because the things, they're supposed to be based on household objects, like you shoot toasters and hamburgers, but it's Atari 2600 graphics.

19:06.394 --> 19:07.295
[SPEAKER_09]: So they just all look like

19:07.475 --> 19:08.536
[SPEAKER_03]: Blob and Blob.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.058
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you're shooting things.

19:11.119 --> 19:16.064
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of the things in later levels float down towards the bottom, but they're in very specific patterns.

19:17.445 --> 19:21.389
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of them will hover right where your ship could go, so you have to actually kind of memorize the patterns.

19:21.810 --> 19:23.031
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you could go explodey.

19:23.777 --> 19:25.560
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, and Vandy in our chatroom says River Raid.

19:25.580 --> 19:27.482
[SPEAKER_09]: That is definitely a classic Activision game, too.

19:28.303 --> 19:29.205
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots and lots of good stuff.

19:30.867 --> 19:34.692
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, SalaciousPop asking me in chat if I ever got in on the Civ 3 for sale.

19:34.712 --> 19:35.974
[SPEAKER_09]: I should put that out as an FYI.

19:36.434 --> 19:37.336
[SPEAKER_09]: Steam was running a sale.

19:37.636 --> 19:39.919
[SPEAKER_09]: Civilization 3 Complete Edition

19:40.660 --> 19:44.061
[SPEAKER_09]: A dollar twenty-five That's a great deal What?

19:44.301 --> 20:02.328
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, on Steam Civ 3, the complete edition But get this Civ 4 I think was like And Alan, correct me if I'm wrong But I think it was like $19.95 No, I think it was less than that Maybe $12.95 For everything Civ 4 Civ 4, the expansion and colonization Was like less than $20 It was nice

20:04.133 --> 20:32.704
[SPEAKER_09]: one other thing I do want to mention during my game week because I do play a lot of World of Warcraft lots of information leaking on Cataclysm this week I don't want to go too spoilery because I know some people are really trying to prevent hearing all the spoilers a lot of what I've seen is very visual so thankfully this is a radio show and I can't really spoil the visuals but I will say I am so glad that the game is getting like a graphical upgrade I think it's great that Blizzard is kind of taking this opportunity to say let's see how could we like retcon a graphical upgrade into the game oh

20:33.724 --> 20:38.728
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's blow up the world as it is and make this whole new world and it'll have all new graphics.

20:40.129 --> 20:41.250
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of the screenshots are great.

20:41.750 --> 20:42.571
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah.

20:43.571 --> 20:45.833
[SPEAKER_09]: And Bobby in chat is correcting us, jumping in.

20:46.734 --> 20:49.216
[SPEAKER_09]: $10 for Civ IV, the two expansions, and colonization.

20:49.236 --> 20:50.136
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a great deal.

20:50.557 --> 20:51.517
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a great deal.

20:51.537 --> 20:53.239
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta get in on that before it's over.

20:53.839 --> 20:54.580
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn you, Steam.

20:55.660 --> 21:24.186
[SPEAKER_09]: Nickel and Diamond me for all these old games yeah so World of Warcraft Cataclysm I'm excited about that kind of surprised at how fast information is leaking out but the friends and family alpha is going on and unfortunately not everybody's friends and family at Blizzard can apparently be trusted because once it hits the internet which the client has apparently it's done because that thing's got data mined and there's pictures and models and everything so yeah looking forward to some of the things they have planned for the expansion

21:25.663 --> 21:28.344
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's get into some housekeeping tonight.

21:28.384 --> 21:37.627
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to wish a very happy Mother's Day to all the mothers who happen to be listening and all of your mothers or motherly figure in your life and what have you who happen to be tuning in.

21:37.687 --> 21:39.888
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if we have a lot of mothers that listen to this show.

21:40.409 --> 21:41.549
[SPEAKER_09]: We all know mine doesn't listen.

21:41.869 --> 21:43.010
[SPEAKER_15]: We have one listening now.

21:43.731 --> 21:44.431
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Becky, right?

21:44.752 --> 21:45.873
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, happy Mother's Day, Becky.

21:46.393 --> 21:50.557
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think Deakman's wife might listen once in a while.

21:51.057 --> 21:52.679
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know what other mothers.

21:52.719 --> 21:53.940
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize if I forgot you.

21:54.040 --> 21:58.484
[SPEAKER_09]: But happy Mother's Day to all you or just anybody who considers themselves a mother.

21:59.085 --> 21:59.345
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

22:00.306 --> 22:03.308
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on and actually get into some gaming news now.

22:03.509 --> 22:07.392
[SPEAKER_09]: And speaking of Blizzard, I believe we're starting off tonight with just an avalanche of Blizzard news.

22:07.432 --> 22:07.732
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, Loki?

22:07.752 --> 22:07.833
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

22:08.653 --> 22:12.798
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there's a lot of news coming out for... I heard what you did there.

22:12.878 --> 22:13.960
[SPEAKER_09]: Totally unintended, too.

22:14.540 --> 22:17.424
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally unintended.

22:17.624 --> 22:27.155
[SPEAKER_07]: With StarCraft 2, of course, they announced the release date for July 27th, and both the collector's edition and the regular edition will be coming out that...

22:27.956 --> 22:31.557
[SPEAKER_07]: At that time, of course, this will be the first StarCraft 2 that's being released.

22:31.677 --> 22:35.518
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe there's still going to be two more because one for each campaign.

22:35.898 --> 22:36.679
[SPEAKER_07]: Way to whore it out.

22:39.259 --> 22:40.140
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of neat.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.720
[SPEAKER_07]: Some other neat things, though.

22:42.160 --> 22:45.441
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently the map editor is very versatile.

22:45.501 --> 22:50.863
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, not only can you make custom maps with it, you can make custom games with it.

22:52.344 --> 22:54.666
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people have used different examples here.

22:55.106 --> 22:57.508
[SPEAKER_07]: They've made a Tetris-like game.

22:58.529 --> 23:04.754
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a Mario Kart type of game where you can race different characters around.

23:05.415 --> 23:11.340
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally, there was also a Shmup game made with the editor as well.

23:11.580 --> 23:16.424
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty awesome that you have so much flexibility with just that editor.

23:18.717 --> 23:21.558
[SPEAKER_09]: Be very interesting to see what kind of mods you'll see for it.

23:21.618 --> 23:24.980
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be more interesting to see what Blizzard does to not have this happen.

23:25.020 --> 23:29.542
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, I don't know, Blizzard also kind of is supporting the mod community because they kind of realize it's going to happen.

23:29.922 --> 23:34.204
[SPEAKER_09]: Warcraft especially, you know, I notice there's two kinds of people.

23:34.244 --> 23:36.405
[SPEAKER_09]: There's StarCraft people and there's Diablo people.

23:36.525 --> 23:40.006
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm more of a Diablo person, so I don't follow the StarCraft news as much.

23:40.367 --> 23:44.408
[SPEAKER_09]: But at least when it comes to World of Warcraft, they're very embracing of the mod community there.

23:44.749 --> 23:47.430
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe they're laughing at this too.

23:47.470 --> 23:47.750
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

23:50.054 --> 23:50.674
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty neat.

23:51.955 --> 24:00.477
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not planning on picking up the game, though, because I don't think I was either a StarCraft or a Warcraft type of person.

24:01.277 --> 24:06.619
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, I did play the original Warcraft, but that was how long ago I played the original Warcraft.

24:06.679 --> 24:08.019
[SPEAKER_07]: That would have been about 15 years ago.

24:08.039 --> 24:09.560
[SPEAKER_09]: The original Warcraft's pretty old.

24:09.860 --> 24:09.980
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

24:13.112 --> 24:14.734
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

24:15.034 --> 24:17.318
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have you know, I didn't actually buy Warcraft.

24:17.518 --> 24:19.982
[SPEAKER_07]: I played the demo in PC Gamer.

24:20.783 --> 24:21.945
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how old.

24:24.006 --> 24:28.589
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to our listeners' chats here at chat.orangeentree.com.

24:28.609 --> 24:31.190
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw says, Sky, you should call your mother during the show.

24:31.430 --> 24:35.692
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, Loomis follows up, any chance of the OLR crew calling their moms?

24:35.732 --> 24:37.754
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember y'all tried a few months ago, and it was a lot of fun.

24:38.574 --> 24:44.817
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you know, I already called my mom this morning, and we chatted about that, because she said I was surprised I wasn't calling her during the show.

24:44.857 --> 24:47.599
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, well, you know, we kind of did that bit a couple weeks ago.

24:48.259 --> 24:51.561
[SPEAKER_15]: I called my mom and talked to her while I was waiting to get in the restaurant, yeah.

24:51.561 --> 24:52.962
[SPEAKER_09]: I already did stuff with my mom this week.

25:19.459 --> 25:46.020
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, let's see, other comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchery.com Bochikawa talking about the Cataclysm leaks Sky, remember not all leaks are unintentional Blizz only gets more people interested for what they're showing off in Cat That's true, you know, I'm sure Blizzard to some extent realizes that a lot of the stuff they put in the Friends and Family Alpha is going to be out there even though it's all under NDA and they've come out and said, hey, all this stuff is still under NDA although it hasn't stopped MMO Champion from running everything

25:46.660 --> 25:53.110
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but I, I, I think to some extent, uh, anything they put out there, they realize is, is gonna leak.

25:53.670 --> 25:57.696
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but there's, there's a lot that isn't in the Cataclysm beta right now.

25:57.756 --> 26:00.400
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, like, like not every zone, apparently.

26:01.181 --> 26:01.261
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

26:02.723 --> 26:03.903
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

26:22.955 --> 26:48.615
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, one thing that also could change in the future, apparently the Wii, and Nintendo in general, might be kind of reconsidering their stance on online, because apparently Nintendo, you know, one place Nintendo fails hardcore is online, and a lot of that has to do with, you know, the whole friend code thing was a little bit silly, and, you know, just that they haven't embraced the online gaming to the extent that Xbox Live or even, you know, PlayStation Network has.

26:49.835 --> 26:55.898
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some comments that Miyamoto, the god of Nintendo in many ways, brought us Mario and all these folks.

26:56.358 --> 27:00.479
[SPEAKER_09]: He talked to Edge Magazine and apparently was talking about online business this week.

27:00.559 --> 27:07.342
[SPEAKER_09]: Miyamoto said the following, "...probably the other thing that we are desperate to realize is the core online business structure."

27:07.862 --> 27:11.284
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we need to demand customers pay monthly fees to enjoy online activities?

27:11.765 --> 27:17.508
[SPEAKER_09]: Or give an online subscription that is free of charge but then offer something extra for people to pay so they get some extra value?

27:17.868 --> 27:21.310
[SPEAKER_09]: With these core business strategies, I think we are less active than we should be.

27:23.132 --> 27:31.157
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, it had come up in conversation that Nintendo actually wasn't being very proactive with their online strategy because, well, they're not.

27:32.077 --> 27:39.243
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, basically, if you look at what Miyamoto's saying in those quotes, I mean, in my opinion, he basically says Xbox Live and then PlayStation, right?

27:39.943 --> 27:41.865
[SPEAKER_09]: Pay monthly fees to enjoy online activities.

27:42.005 --> 27:42.825
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Xbox Live.

27:43.246 --> 27:46.448
[SPEAKER_09]: Or give an online subscription that's free but something extra for people that pay.

27:46.748 --> 27:56.976
[SPEAKER_09]: That's PlayStation Network with their free model, but you have, like, the core magazine that has all the little frills in it and some of their other... It's also kind of Xbox Live because you can access it for free.

27:56.996 --> 27:57.296
[SPEAKER_07]: True.

27:57.476 --> 27:57.657
[SPEAKER_07]: True.

27:58.397 --> 28:05.786
[SPEAKER_09]: So, uh, but he, Miyamoto does say, don't forget that there is like a reward program for folks that get their Wii's online if you help others.

28:06.487 --> 28:13.676
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but he did admit Nintendo has, hasn't been very proactive in developing such online activities as an MMOG.

28:14.898 --> 28:15.138
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

28:15.178 --> 28:15.238
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

28:16.112 --> 28:16.452
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

28:16.532 --> 28:21.475
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the door is still wide open, I think, to make a real Animal Crossing online game.

28:22.375 --> 28:24.317
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say the door is still open to that.

28:24.437 --> 28:31.440
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a rehashed frickin' original Animal Crossing game with online elements as the DS and Wii ones were.

28:31.460 --> 28:33.602
[SPEAKER_09]: You could still make a full-fledged MMO for Animal Crossing.

28:33.982 --> 28:37.124
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, Pokemon, I think, would lend itself to an MMO very well.

28:38.244 --> 28:41.406
[SPEAKER_09]: But could we perhaps see something at E3 this year?

28:42.186 --> 28:43.407
[SPEAKER_09]: I would guess probably not.

28:44.502 --> 28:48.186
[SPEAKER_07]: They're never going to embrace online, at least not with this console.

28:48.887 --> 28:50.729
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say probably not with this console either.

28:51.110 --> 28:55.355
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's going to happen with the Wii, but I think it's something you've got to see in their next console.

28:55.395 --> 28:55.916
[SPEAKER_07]: They have to.

28:56.196 --> 29:01.823
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no... Because they're basically saying, oh, people don't really care about online.

29:01.963 --> 29:03.124
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's not true.

29:04.085 --> 29:07.168
[SPEAKER_09]: and then you see 11 million subscribers of World of Warcraft.

29:07.368 --> 29:10.130
[SPEAKER_07]: Or all the people on Facebook and stuff.

29:10.170 --> 29:11.071
[SPEAKER_07]: That's still online.

29:12.532 --> 29:12.932
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true.

29:12.972 --> 29:16.615
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm surprised Nintendo doesn't try to do something with Facebook because a lot of it's the same audience.

29:17.195 --> 29:17.696
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

29:17.716 --> 29:19.677
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, wasn't there something...

29:22.043 --> 29:23.284
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking of something.

29:23.304 --> 29:25.565
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I think you're thinking of the parody stuff with Mario.

29:25.645 --> 29:26.506
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, no.

29:26.806 --> 29:29.307
[SPEAKER_09]: I know there was that, but there was something else I was thinking of.

29:29.327 --> 29:34.550
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought there actually was something with this whole get your friends on the Wii that's somehow tied into Facebook, but I could be wrong.

29:35.831 --> 29:36.231
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine.

29:36.732 --> 29:37.472
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm wrong sometimes.

29:37.612 --> 29:37.952
[SPEAKER_09]: It happens.

29:39.093 --> 29:45.677
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see what happens with Nintendo in the future and their online presence, but I would say don't get your hopes up, at least with this generation.

29:46.157 --> 29:51.321
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to probably hype it up for whatever console is coming next and make it sound like it's new.

29:51.581 --> 29:54.222
[SPEAKER_09]: Like all these things are just new ideas that have never been done before.

29:54.703 --> 29:55.083
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

29:55.303 --> 30:04.289
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and real quick, since we're on the topic of Nintendo and being that we did sort of like a sort of secret club a few weeks ago,

30:05.169 --> 30:06.330
[SPEAKER_07]: I have something to tie in with that.

30:06.531 --> 30:06.891
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, really?

30:06.951 --> 30:10.615
[SPEAKER_07]: It hasn't quite made it out there yet, but we'll be out there soon enough.

30:10.855 --> 30:11.316
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

30:11.476 --> 30:11.777
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

30:12.257 --> 30:14.540
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish I knew I would have brought up the Secret Club theme music.

30:14.560 --> 30:15.901
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's all right.

30:16.161 --> 30:17.002
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really stupid.

30:17.263 --> 30:18.204
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember Secret Club?

30:18.544 --> 30:19.165
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't hear it here.

30:20.327 --> 30:33.338
[SPEAKER_07]: So, as you may remember, it was confirmed that today, actually, that the black Wii system bundle with Wii Sports Resort and Wii Motion Plus and all the Wii Sports that came out for the same price.

30:33.938 --> 30:37.081
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, great.

30:39.002 --> 30:41.004
[SPEAKER_07]: What they didn't mention is it's also coming out in white.

30:42.671 --> 30:43.372
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's stupid.

30:43.472 --> 30:43.832
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

30:43.912 --> 30:44.412
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

30:44.693 --> 30:45.393
[SPEAKER_07]: I see exactly.

30:45.673 --> 30:46.294
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

30:46.674 --> 30:52.018
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's good to know that the White Whees aren't going away or they're not going to be collector's items or anything.

30:52.278 --> 30:58.363
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically going to be... They're just going to do this for... I don't know how long.

30:58.383 --> 30:59.243
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it is limited.

30:59.263 --> 31:00.805
[SPEAKER_07]: It says on the box, limited edition.

31:00.885 --> 31:04.747
[SPEAKER_07]: But that might be just like, buy this, please.

31:05.588 --> 31:06.249
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know.

31:07.149 --> 31:15.836
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically you will be able to pick when you go to the store if you want to make a Wii and you'll have a big decision to make and that would be do you want it black or white?

31:33.673 --> 31:35.815
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's the question shoppers everywhere are going to ask themselves.

31:36.215 --> 31:36.715
[SPEAKER_09]: Black or white?

31:37.356 --> 31:37.716
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

31:38.877 --> 31:39.357
[SPEAKER_09]: I am a dork.

31:39.637 --> 31:40.878
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, what's up next?

31:41.979 --> 31:52.547
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Nintendo has sent out a little plug for something that's supposed to happen for June 16th, which is right during E3.

31:53.407 --> 32:00.833
[SPEAKER_15]: The official Nintendo magazine is going to have a world exclusive in issue 57, which is something, but the

32:01.613 --> 32:05.837
[SPEAKER_15]: The quote goes, you may want to mark Wednesday, 16th, June in your diary.

32:06.157 --> 32:13.323
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be revealing world exclusive details on a top secret new game in the next issue of O&M.

32:14.184 --> 32:15.605
[SPEAKER_07]: How do they know I have a diary?

32:16.741 --> 32:24.224
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that, given the way that the date's listed and diary, I would suspect that it's European information.

32:25.524 --> 32:25.784
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

32:27.465 --> 32:33.967
[SPEAKER_15]: But, maybe it's an excuse to try to get people to go out and buy more official Nintendo magazine.

32:35.207 --> 32:38.888
[SPEAKER_15]: All they have to do is say, Howard and Nestor, back for real, forever.

32:38.988 --> 32:39.628
[SPEAKER_07]: How about this?

32:39.748 --> 32:43.089
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's like, why don't you just wait to see what's at E3?

32:43.109 --> 32:45.210
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I can guarantee whatever's at E3 is going to be there.

32:45.230 --> 32:46.991
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's coming out during E3, right?

32:47.031 --> 32:47.571
[SPEAKER_07]: June 16th?

32:47.591 --> 32:48.711
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, not everyone gets to go.

32:48.771 --> 32:50.171
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like the Wednesday of E3.

32:51.012 --> 32:54.493
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but everybody that we know has internet access.

32:54.693 --> 33:02.275
[SPEAKER_15]: And if it's the June issue, typically the issues for one month for subscribers come out a month earlier.

33:03.880 --> 33:05.381
[SPEAKER_09]: This could be a timed thing though.

33:06.462 --> 33:08.043
[SPEAKER_09]: It could still be like the July issue.

33:08.083 --> 33:08.663
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

33:08.783 --> 33:09.724
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be timed.

33:09.924 --> 33:13.986
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially if it's sensitive information that is going to be blown at the E3 press conference.

33:14.407 --> 33:18.509
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to make sure they don't leave headquarters until the game.

33:18.589 --> 33:19.570
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all it is.

33:19.630 --> 33:22.432
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be the Nintendo money printer.

33:23.496 --> 33:26.338
[SPEAKER_07]: Hinting that they're going to be doing a new Zelda game.

33:26.499 --> 33:27.720
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, new Zelda game.

33:28.040 --> 33:30.142
[SPEAKER_09]: Xlink in our chatroom says, it's Earthbound.

33:30.202 --> 33:30.802
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

33:30.822 --> 33:34.125
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what if it's Kid Icarus?

33:34.565 --> 33:35.326
[SPEAKER_09]: Jizz to my pants.

33:36.440 --> 33:41.563
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, you know, to be fair, I mean, I know, Loki, you're sitting over there going, it's Zelda, big fucking deal.

33:42.123 --> 33:51.849
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, one of the best games to come out last year, if not the best game to come out last year, was a blindside by Nintendo at E3 that nobody saw coming.

33:52.209 --> 33:53.570
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was New Super Mario Bros.

33:53.610 --> 33:53.790
[SPEAKER_09]: Wii.

33:53.850 --> 33:55.651
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, there was no news on that before E3.

33:56.331 --> 33:56.752
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

33:57.032 --> 34:02.277
[SPEAKER_07]: I never saw them rehashing something that was on another system and re-releasing it for another system.

34:02.298 --> 34:02.938
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what though, Loki?

34:02.958 --> 34:04.980
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so unlike Nintendo.

34:05.061 --> 34:08.284
[SPEAKER_09]: Your cynicism aside, it really was one of the best games to come out last year.

34:08.404 --> 34:09.285
[SPEAKER_09]: If not the best.

34:09.345 --> 34:10.887
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, last year was not like an A-plus last year.

34:10.907 --> 34:12.368
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you know why it sold a lot?

34:12.408 --> 34:16.433
[SPEAKER_07]: Because people that buy the Wii eat up anything that comes out this month.

34:17.413 --> 34:18.474
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good game.

34:18.994 --> 34:20.135
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a platform game.

34:20.936 --> 34:26.259
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very accessible to those that played the old Mario on the Nintendo NES.

34:26.359 --> 34:27.239
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a great game.

34:27.860 --> 34:28.860
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand it.

34:28.920 --> 34:37.986
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a Mario game and it'll do really well just like Super Mario Galaxy 2 will do really well because it's a Mario game because people buy Mario and Zelda and Pokemon.

34:39.952 --> 34:46.674
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if they came out with an awesome Metroid game, and yes, I know Metroid Other M is right around the corner.

34:47.254 --> 34:51.035
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me tell you something, Metroid Other M is going to sell as well as Mario.

34:51.355 --> 35:03.498
[SPEAKER_07]: If they dressed up Mario in the Samus suit and had him going fighting Bowser and stuff with a blaster and he can turn into a ball and shoot bombs and stuff like that, it would sell a billion copies because people eat up Mario.

35:03.558 --> 35:06.339
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like Apple and their iPods.

35:07.720 --> 35:10.822
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually am going to go out on a limb, and I could be dead wrong.

35:11.262 --> 35:14.645
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think Mario Galaxy 2 is going to sell as great as everyone thinks it is.

35:14.825 --> 35:15.345
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not.

35:15.406 --> 35:20.730
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's going to be this kind of like just general rejection of the game.

35:21.490 --> 35:32.038
[SPEAKER_09]: What I think is interesting, and I don't think it's on our show roll tonight, but I heard something about they were releasing Mario Galaxy 2, not in America, but in other countries, Japan and Europe, with a DVD.

35:32.058 --> 35:32.139
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

35:32.839 --> 35:33.360
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

35:53.482 --> 35:54.522
[SPEAKER_07]: But it doesn't matter.

35:54.722 --> 35:56.643
[SPEAKER_07]: The system doesn't play DVDs.

35:57.303 --> 35:57.703
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares?

35:58.264 --> 36:03.345
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, they could include the videos on the actual disc, but so what?

36:04.446 --> 36:11.308
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you remember, Mario Galaxy was the first dual-layer DVD game from Nintendo.

36:12.608 --> 36:13.389
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was a good game.

36:13.589 --> 36:19.472
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not bagging on Mario Galaxy and I'm not trying to say that Mario Galaxy 2 won't sell well because it's a bad game by any means.

36:19.553 --> 36:19.713
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

36:19.953 --> 36:21.674
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think... I don't know.

36:21.734 --> 36:26.237
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you're going to really see a difference between how a game like New Super Mario Bros.

36:26.277 --> 36:27.798
[SPEAKER_09]: Wii and that will be received.

36:28.098 --> 36:28.498
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

36:28.518 --> 36:31.720
[SPEAKER_07]: The only reason I'm saying that it's just...

36:33.337 --> 36:36.098
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have high expectations for Nintendo.

36:37.279 --> 36:39.300
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, great, New Super Mario Bros.

36:39.940 --> 36:40.360
[SPEAKER_07]: did well.

36:40.600 --> 36:41.060
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

36:41.260 --> 36:42.601
[SPEAKER_07]: If it was a different Mario Bros.

36:42.641 --> 36:43.782
[SPEAKER_07]: game, it was still done well.

36:43.842 --> 36:48.824
[SPEAKER_07]: Mario game during the fourth quarter, during holiday season, it's going to be on everyone's shopping list.

36:49.444 --> 36:50.544
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course it's going to do well.

36:51.025 --> 36:51.785
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not a surprise.

36:52.025 --> 36:55.907
[SPEAKER_07]: But the thing is, Nintendo doesn't really do anything to surprise us.

36:56.667 --> 36:59.248
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, their latest announcement that was this week.

36:59.428 --> 37:00.949
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just like, really?

37:01.709 --> 37:02.029
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

37:02.529 --> 37:08.772
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there wasn't enough party games on the Wii that you needed Me Party or Wii Party?

37:08.872 --> 37:09.712
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, really?

37:10.452 --> 37:11.012
[SPEAKER_07]: Wii Party?

37:13.533 --> 37:14.454
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that necessary?

37:16.414 --> 37:18.235
[SPEAKER_07]: Where am I going to get a good party game on the Wii?

37:18.735 --> 37:19.075
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

37:19.115 --> 37:20.216
[SPEAKER_07]: There's just none out there.

37:20.396 --> 37:20.656
[SPEAKER_07]: Ever.

37:21.596 --> 37:21.896
[SPEAKER_07]: Ever.

37:24.577 --> 37:25.558
[SPEAKER_09]: If that's what people are going to buy...

37:27.543 --> 37:35.753
[SPEAKER_07]: But just like, you know, don't try to pretend, Nintendo, that you're going to just come out with some sort of amazing product that's just going to blow us all away.

37:36.173 --> 37:40.478
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'll tell you what, it's just going to be a port of something, or it's going to be another Mario or Zelda game.

37:42.077 --> 38:07.590
[SPEAKER_07]: All it really is And those Mario and Zelda games I bet you anything the new Zelda game Probably going to be exactly like the last Zelda game As far as engine goes Just new levels and stuff Maybe a few little Link is going to turn into a duck this time I don't know, something different It's just Duck Link Zelda 2 The Adventures of Quack

38:08.826 --> 38:10.647
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft says they'll probably publish President Cat No

38:29.162 --> 38:31.564
[SPEAKER_09]: No, President Cat's not going to happen, sadly.

38:32.485 --> 38:33.005
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish it would.

38:33.045 --> 38:34.126
[SPEAKER_09]: You all know how I feel about it.

38:35.307 --> 38:39.931
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's still my dream that it'll be the big... Maybe that's the big surprise reveal at E3.

38:40.472 --> 38:41.273
[SPEAKER_09]: President Cat.

38:42.894 --> 38:44.215
[SPEAKER_09]: When is this cat coming on stage?

38:44.495 --> 38:46.117
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy shit.

38:46.797 --> 38:49.960
[SPEAKER_09]: I probably won't get invited to the Nintendo press conference, but that's okay.

38:50.020 --> 38:50.921
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't matter.

38:50.961 --> 38:52.142
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll hear you yelling.

38:52.402 --> 38:54.584
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll hear me yelling from wherever I am.

38:54.684 --> 38:55.665
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell?

38:57.677 --> 38:58.557
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

38:58.998 --> 39:00.158
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys really did that?

39:00.779 --> 39:01.579
[SPEAKER_09]: You really did it?

39:02.940 --> 39:03.420
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, shit.

39:04.320 --> 39:05.061
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this real life?

39:06.581 --> 39:08.062
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, let's move on, Loki.

39:08.422 --> 39:09.683
[SPEAKER_07]: President Cat will never happen.

39:12.566 --> 39:15.229
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so, other stuff we can talk about Nintendo.

39:15.970 --> 39:24.139
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, they're going to want to step up their anti-piracy measures for the 3DS, seeing as it's running rampant with the DS and the DSi.

39:24.519 --> 39:29.265
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though, oh yeah, we changed some stuff to the DSi to make it harder to pirate, but yeah, that was defeated within...

39:30.906 --> 39:32.086
[SPEAKER_07]: Little time whatsoever.

39:32.186 --> 39:36.428
[SPEAKER_07]: But apparently they hate piracy.

39:36.508 --> 39:36.768
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

39:37.208 --> 39:37.708
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God.

39:38.348 --> 39:49.111
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course now that six years with the system being out, they want to find ways to stop the piracy.

39:49.471 --> 39:53.372
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, we have a strong sense of the crisis about this problem.

39:56.024 --> 39:57.845
[SPEAKER_07]: Which doesn't really say what they're going to do.

39:59.527 --> 40:00.908
[SPEAKER_09]: We're aware of the problem.

40:01.968 --> 40:02.309
[SPEAKER_09]: Good.

40:03.429 --> 40:07.112
[SPEAKER_09]: No shit, because you sued the companies that were doing the chips and stuff, right?

40:07.132 --> 40:08.413
[SPEAKER_09]: They went after all these people.

40:08.953 --> 40:10.515
[SPEAKER_09]: So no shit you're aware of the problem.

40:11.624 --> 40:14.165
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you going to make that perfect anti-piracy?

40:14.205 --> 40:15.985
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, doesn't Sony say this all the time?

40:16.406 --> 40:19.807
[SPEAKER_09]: We have made our next console unhackable.

40:21.047 --> 40:22.408
[SPEAKER_09]: 48 hours later, LOL hack.

40:22.788 --> 40:23.568
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to tell you right now.

40:24.428 --> 40:36.112
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless the system has downloadable firmware updates that they can do, something like that, the fact that these games are on a cartridge, there's no way that they're going to be able to stop piracy.

40:36.712 --> 40:38.573
[SPEAKER_07]: It will get broken quickly.

40:38.613 --> 40:38.933
[SPEAKER_07]: Quickly.

40:41.124 --> 40:41.764
[SPEAKER_09]: Bold statement.

40:42.985 --> 40:44.626
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's look at the past history now.

40:47.288 --> 40:49.570
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, the only system that's been hard to crack is the PS3.

40:49.590 --> 40:55.233
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just because Blu-ray has it really, you know, it's somewhat a new technology.

40:55.674 --> 40:56.614
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not necessarily that.

40:56.634 --> 40:58.075
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just they have good encryption and stuff.

40:58.115 --> 41:02.018
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's just, look at the Nintendo systems.

41:02.058 --> 41:03.999
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the DS, the Game Boy Advance.

41:05.120 --> 41:05.560
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll happen.

41:07.105 --> 41:17.379
[SPEAKER_07]: and especially since I'm assuming this system is going to have some of the technology that's in the DS because it is going to be backwards compatible.

41:18.821 --> 41:21.825
[SPEAKER_07]: So it probably won't be that difficult.

41:23.396 --> 41:25.157
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm planning on picking one up because I think it's going to be neat.

41:26.098 --> 41:28.020
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

41:28.760 --> 41:30.922
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's move on to talk about some other news.

41:30.982 --> 41:34.104
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, wait, I've got to read these A-plus comments from chat because there was some hilarious stuff.

41:34.385 --> 41:44.512
[SPEAKER_09]: Going back to the whole duck Link thing, Stan in our chat room, A-plus comment, Link turns into a donkey and the next game will be called The Legend of Zelda, Zelda's Tijuana Donkey Show.

41:46.474 --> 41:47.855
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that's a game I'd play.

41:47.875 --> 41:47.955
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

41:50.222 --> 42:05.632
[SPEAKER_09]: or Link turns into a wolf gets captured by Bob Barker and then neutered LittleBigPlanet 2 is going to be coming out that's right, it's real, it's actually happening we've had a few leaks and remember the guy a couple weeks ago whose song was confirmed to be in the game, etc, etc

42:06.232 --> 42:12.777
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, apparently Game Informer has said it is coming and we're going to show off more information in our June issue of Game Informer.

42:13.298 --> 42:14.979
[SPEAKER_09]: So, what exactly is going on?

42:14.999 --> 42:16.661
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, some of the little details have leaked.

42:16.841 --> 42:18.362
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a whole new game.

42:19.563 --> 42:21.585
[SPEAKER_09]: This is coming from the NeoGAF forums.

42:21.685 --> 42:31.212
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, Media Molecule is making tools that will allow you to do racing games, space invader shooters, puzzle games, role-playing games, and strategy games.

42:31.733 --> 42:32.453
[SPEAKER_09]: They are just...

42:33.314 --> 42:36.115
[SPEAKER_09]: Making this engine, it's not just for side-scrollers now.

42:36.736 --> 42:37.756
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the big difference here.

42:37.816 --> 42:44.259
[SPEAKER_07]: And the thing I heard, I thought, was the stuff from LittleBigPlanet 1, I think you're going to be able to bring into LittleBigPlanet 2.

42:45.220 --> 42:49.362
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently a media molecule developer made a Command & Conquer clone in the game.

42:50.522 --> 42:57.606
[SPEAKER_07]: And they also were saying that they were able to, now you can really have good control over the cameras and stuff like that, the physics.

42:57.906 --> 43:00.267
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to be able to create and edit short films.

43:00.487 --> 43:02.428
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is going to be Mashima Heaven, apparently.

43:03.369 --> 43:05.990
[SPEAKER_09]: You will be able to record your own sound effects.

43:06.150 --> 43:08.511
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even know how that works, but that's what they're promising.

43:08.972 --> 43:12.914
[SPEAKER_09]: You will be able to move the game's camera around to make your own cut scenes using Sack Boys.

43:13.474 --> 43:15.855
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and, and, the Sack Bot.

43:16.375 --> 43:19.177
[SPEAKER_09]: A fully customizable, programmable enemy unit.

43:20.358 --> 43:22.301
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can control it yourself.

43:23.683 --> 43:25.425
[SPEAKER_09]: I almost think this is going to be too much.

43:25.626 --> 43:27.709
[SPEAKER_09]: It is going to be epic.

43:27.969 --> 43:34.158
[SPEAKER_09]: Part of what made LittleBigPlanet so cool was that it was relatively easy to make your own levels, but there was still... It wasn't...

43:35.820 --> 43:37.141
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't easy to make a good level.

43:37.181 --> 43:37.842
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me put it this way.

43:37.862 --> 43:38.562
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me put it that way.

43:38.722 --> 43:43.606
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard with... The problem you run into when you can do that is it's like you don't know where to begin.

43:44.207 --> 43:46.108
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like all these options.

43:46.148 --> 43:47.469
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't know how to kind of focus it.

43:47.829 --> 43:50.071
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas if you're limited somewhat, it's a little bit easier.

43:50.131 --> 43:52.913
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I got to make a side-scrolling game, so here's this.

43:53.213 --> 43:58.938
[SPEAKER_07]: But people that want to expand beyond that to make like the space shooters and stuff, they're limited by what they can do.

43:59.178 --> 44:09.022
[SPEAKER_07]: So this, I think, since you're going to have full control over the camera and stuff, you're going to see a lot of maybe even top-down games and whatever, but it's just going to be nuts.

44:09.342 --> 44:14.464
[SPEAKER_09]: Alpha Cananogram wants to jump in there and try to correct me, saying the PlayStation Eye has a microphone.

44:15.484 --> 44:24.492
[SPEAKER_09]: That, okay, so you'll be able to make your own sound effects, but, I mean, what are you going to be able to make with a microphone on a camera besides, like, you know, fart noises and, you know, just, like, random screaming?

44:24.672 --> 44:26.734
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be cool if you could import WAV files in MP3s.

44:26.754 --> 44:27.815
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be awesome.

44:27.915 --> 44:29.237
[SPEAKER_09]: Make your own background music?

44:29.317 --> 44:29.717
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

44:30.157 --> 44:33.560
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, that also opens the door to, like, rampant piracy.

44:34.982 --> 44:35.162
[SPEAKER_09]: Like...

44:35.602 --> 44:52.353
[SPEAKER_09]: soon not only will you be able to listen to Lady Gaga leaks and whatever else is leaking on the internet that whole iLeaks thing not only will you be able to do that on YouTube but you'll be able to go into LittleBigPlanet and listen to new songs because people will bring MP3s over it's great

44:54.574 --> 44:56.355
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, this sounds pretty awesome.

44:56.395 --> 45:01.217
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, there are some other little things trickling out about there.

45:02.517 --> 45:06.519
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a more robust game that is not just side-scrollers.

45:07.259 --> 45:09.920
[SPEAKER_09]: And this kind of catches me by surprise, because I thought...

45:10.720 --> 45:11.381
[SPEAKER_09]: LittleBigPlanet 2

45:30.621 --> 45:31.302
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds epic.

45:32.062 --> 45:33.323
[SPEAKER_09]: Erasing games?

45:34.123 --> 45:37.005
[SPEAKER_09]: Direct competition with... Themselves, almost.

45:37.025 --> 45:37.766
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so weird.

45:40.488 --> 45:41.208
[SPEAKER_09]: RPG Maker.

45:41.388 --> 45:42.529
[SPEAKER_09]: You used to love that.

45:42.769 --> 45:44.170
[SPEAKER_09]: You used to love the RPG Maker series.

45:44.190 --> 45:46.572
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a lot to do, though, with RPG Maker.

45:46.592 --> 45:48.673
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the problem.

45:49.534 --> 45:59.801
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to create an RPG or something, it's just a lot of work with trying to create the storyline and all the different AI and sequences and stuff.

46:01.501 --> 46:02.482
[SPEAKER_07]: It gets too difficult.

46:02.702 --> 46:11.425
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I think the most work that I did on an actual RPG or adventure game or something was actually, like, in MegaZooks.

46:11.945 --> 46:13.386
[SPEAKER_07]: You remember the ZZT sequel?

46:13.486 --> 46:13.866
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes.

46:14.106 --> 46:21.529
[SPEAKER_07]: And the only reason why is because it was pretty much, you know, you can draw your levels, place your enemies and stuff, and you don't really do a lot of programming.

46:21.889 --> 46:26.131
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I did have some boss characters and stuff like that, like a barrier that you can kill with grenades.

46:26.531 --> 46:28.772
[SPEAKER_09]: Little big planet three, ZZT.

46:29.232 --> 46:31.293
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, that was awesome.

46:32.474 --> 46:36.717
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, now that's something that they need to bring to, like, a console or something.

46:36.877 --> 46:39.819
[SPEAKER_09]: One of these weeks, we really need to highlight that as a classic game of the week.

46:39.859 --> 46:44.441
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that's not really DarkSakura's alley, but if she's ever gone in the future, we gotta do ZZT.

46:45.022 --> 46:47.884
[SPEAKER_09]: I could do a whole episode about how much I love ZZT.

46:49.365 --> 46:50.025
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a great game.

46:51.709 --> 46:55.292
[SPEAKER_09]: Create an OLR game in the ZZT contest or something like that.

46:55.572 --> 47:01.176
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually, TigerClaw in our chatroom talking about this whole LittleBigPlanet2 says, Somebody can make a level with clips from OLR.

47:01.597 --> 47:02.978
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a little scared of what that might bring.

47:03.258 --> 47:04.239
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, I thought this was neat, too.

47:04.259 --> 47:08.542
[SPEAKER_09]: They're also talking about PlayStation Eye integration for loading levels using QR codes.

47:08.582 --> 47:11.385
[SPEAKER_09]: Are those like those barcodes that are meant for cell phones and stuff?

47:11.465 --> 47:11.945
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

47:12.025 --> 47:15.128
[SPEAKER_09]: So you'll be able to bring in levels just by holding up a little thing to your camera.

47:15.828 --> 47:16.448
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

47:16.468 --> 47:17.669
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds like the e-reader.

47:18.349 --> 47:18.909
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember that?

47:19.489 --> 47:19.729
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

47:19.789 --> 47:22.790
[SPEAKER_09]: Where they would put full Nintendo games on like five little cards.

47:23.270 --> 47:23.771
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember that?

47:23.791 --> 47:26.612
[SPEAKER_09]: That was awesome.

47:26.972 --> 47:27.812
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, lots of stuff.

47:27.892 --> 47:32.113
[SPEAKER_09]: And oh my gosh, just so much.

47:32.173 --> 47:35.815
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some spoilers of levels that are out there.

47:35.855 --> 47:42.977
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I shouldn't give you too many spoilers, but they are talking about a tribute level to all these old arcade classics.

47:45.771 --> 47:47.352
[SPEAKER_09]: More information at E3, I'm sure.

47:47.673 --> 47:50.115
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, I wonder if it'll be playable on the show floor.

47:50.475 --> 47:51.015
[SPEAKER_09]: Excited.

47:52.577 --> 47:54.198
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll definitely be part of their press conference.

47:54.438 --> 47:55.679
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

47:55.779 --> 47:58.442
[SPEAKER_07]: Weren't they supposed to be having two press conferences, or was that Microsoft?

47:58.482 --> 47:59.162
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Microsoft.

47:59.242 --> 48:01.204
[SPEAKER_09]: It's doing one just about Natal, I believe.

48:01.484 --> 48:04.206
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if that's like a media night or what that's all about.

48:04.987 --> 48:05.347
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

48:05.908 --> 48:07.069
[SPEAKER_09]: Dark Sakura, what you got for us?

48:07.938 --> 48:08.839
[SPEAKER_15]: More stuff, Rob.

48:09.199 --> 48:09.800
[SPEAKER_15]: More stuff.

48:10.501 --> 48:12.383
[SPEAKER_15]: In fact, more Nintendo.

48:13.284 --> 48:18.189
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is actually specifically about Sin and Punishment, Successor of the Skies.

48:21.432 --> 48:25.636
[SPEAKER_15]: The European box art has a reversible cover.

48:26.477 --> 48:53.779
[SPEAKER_15]: so you can actually put have the Japanese box art on it it's not going to look exactly like the Japanese box art because the big logo is not up at the top side of it it's on the bottom but it is the Japanese artwork and I was looking at the European box art yeah and it's just it's not bad but it's not as really good as the Japanese one

48:54.780 --> 48:57.922
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that it's actually... I mean, it's not bad.

48:58.443 --> 49:00.704
[SPEAKER_15]: But the Japanese art is just really fantastic.

49:01.425 --> 49:03.847
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a really gorgeous piece of artwork.

49:05.608 --> 49:06.709
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd say that's a treat.

49:06.929 --> 49:10.211
[SPEAKER_15]: I like it when you get fun little reversible things.

49:10.731 --> 49:13.453
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, it was cool when Capcom did the Okami.

49:14.494 --> 49:15.315
[SPEAKER_15]: And I ordered mine.

49:16.095 --> 49:17.756
[SPEAKER_09]: That I got five months later.

49:18.017 --> 49:20.538
[SPEAKER_09]: When you can print your own and put them in there.

49:20.578 --> 49:22.280
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody did one for Wii Sports.

49:22.820 --> 49:23.921
[SPEAKER_09]: It was kind of fan-made.

49:24.531 --> 49:30.973
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to see a lot of those Photoshop contests too that do like the retro style book covers but out of video games.

49:31.393 --> 49:32.874
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been some very creative ones.

49:32.934 --> 49:36.495
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to just kind of film up my gaming library with the alternative covers.

49:36.535 --> 49:37.255
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would be cool.

49:37.375 --> 49:41.437
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to link this image though to the chat room because I think they'd really like to see it.

49:41.517 --> 49:41.777
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope.

49:42.717 --> 49:43.278
[SPEAKER_15]: If not, too bad.

49:43.298 --> 49:43.998
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm linking it anyway.

49:45.078 --> 49:48.122
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to our chatroom, chat.orangeloundtrader.com.

49:48.162 --> 49:50.444
[SPEAKER_09]: Stan is asking, wasn't there already a Nintendo cereal?

49:50.824 --> 49:53.347
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure it was a Mario cereal or a Zelda cereal.

49:53.427 --> 49:54.188
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, it was both.

49:54.889 --> 49:58.232
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was in response to a comment Actdeft had said, what's next, Nintendo cereal?

49:58.252 --> 49:59.674
[SPEAKER_15]: It was the Nintendo breakfast system.

49:59.794 --> 50:00.935
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the Nintendo breakfast system.

50:02.056 --> 50:04.098
[SPEAKER_09]: And it had a little theme song.

50:04.138 --> 50:05.240
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it had both, right?

50:05.900 --> 50:07.241
[SPEAKER_15]: It's for breakfast now.

50:07.762 --> 50:10.925
[SPEAKER_09]: It had both the Mario and Zelda, right?

50:11.025 --> 50:15.529
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it was split in the center like those logos for the two game cartridges.

50:16.470 --> 50:16.930
[SPEAKER_09]: Here, hold on.

50:16.950 --> 50:17.891
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.

50:18.852 --> 50:20.553
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to take me way back, y'all.

50:20.934 --> 50:21.634
[SPEAKER_09]: Way back, y'all.

50:22.355 --> 50:23.196
[SPEAKER_09]: Before some of you were born.

50:29.184 --> 50:29.784
[SPEAKER_15]: It's too low.

50:29.824 --> 50:30.405
[SPEAKER_09]: It's too low.

50:30.445 --> 50:31.365
[SPEAKER_09]: They probably can't hear that in chat.

50:31.385 --> 50:31.605
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

50:31.625 --> 50:33.926
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me try another one here.

50:33.966 --> 50:35.767
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's try this one.

50:51.874 --> 50:52.855
[SPEAKER_15]: A Fruit Flavored Crunch Fruit Loops

51:13.026 --> 51:14.828
[SPEAKER_15]: I couldn't get over just how awful it smelled.

51:14.868 --> 51:17.352
[SPEAKER_15]: But then again, my favorite cereal when I was a child was Grape Nuts.

51:19.455 --> 51:20.717
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on.

51:20.777 --> 51:22.779
[SPEAKER_09]: Release dates and see what's coming out around the world.

51:22.820 --> 51:25.864
[SPEAKER_09]: Sadly, no new Nintendo cereal, but at least some video games coming out, hopefully.

51:26.758 --> 51:29.881
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, video games definitely on their way out this week.

51:30.382 --> 51:31.823
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, some pretty decent stuff.

51:32.724 --> 51:36.387
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got some big game releases starting off with Lost Planet 2.

51:37.428 --> 51:40.972
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be making its way out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

51:41.452 --> 51:43.254
[SPEAKER_07]: Sad, though, I was reading the reviews on it, man.

51:43.294 --> 51:44.856
[SPEAKER_07]: Just some real...

51:46.463 --> 51:50.164
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, just okay reviews, not kind of gloating over the whole thing.

51:51.544 --> 51:52.125
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.

51:52.665 --> 51:54.125
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's too bad.

51:54.925 --> 52:01.787
[SPEAKER_07]: Dance Sensation, Majesco's, I guess, version of Let's Just Dance, except not as good.

52:01.947 --> 52:04.048
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be coming its way on the Wii.

52:04.668 --> 52:08.050
[SPEAKER_07]: Skate 3, coming out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this week.

52:08.491 --> 52:12.673
[SPEAKER_07]: A game I'm probably going to pick up, 3D Game Heroes, coming out on PlayStation 3.

52:12.713 --> 52:14.635
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, you'll have to tell me if that's worth getting.

52:14.775 --> 52:16.516
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really curious about that game.

52:16.536 --> 52:17.857
[SPEAKER_09]: The reviews have been excellent.

52:18.037 --> 52:18.257
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

52:18.357 --> 52:19.118
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent reviews.

52:19.418 --> 52:21.439
[SPEAKER_07]: So I am definitely picking that up.

52:22.400 --> 52:26.723
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's really a dilemma for me because that means I'm going to have to update my firmware on my PS3.

52:29.359 --> 52:31.540
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, were you trying to hold off on the whole Linux thing?

52:31.560 --> 52:32.181
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I was.

52:32.681 --> 52:33.962
[SPEAKER_09]: When do you ever use Linux?

52:34.302 --> 52:34.902
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter.

52:35.022 --> 52:36.763
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not Linux that I'm interested in.

52:37.764 --> 52:38.224
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I see.

52:40.345 --> 52:44.487
[SPEAKER_07]: The expansion for Age of Conan, Rise of the Godslayer, coming out on PC this week.

52:45.368 --> 52:49.270
[SPEAKER_07]: Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3, coming out on PSP.

52:51.765 --> 52:57.769
[SPEAKER_07]: Batman Arkham Asylum Game of the Year Edition in 3D coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

53:05.300 --> 53:13.090
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, also, of course, the real overpriced Xbox 360 USB flash drives will be coming out this week.

53:14.051 --> 53:15.273
[SPEAKER_07]: 8GB and 16GB.

53:15.914 --> 53:17.556
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, just go buy a third-party one.

53:17.616 --> 53:18.677
[SPEAKER_07]: It's way cheaper.

53:19.578 --> 53:19.839
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

53:20.840 --> 53:21.341
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's it.

53:22.711 --> 53:24.593
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to Japan on the Xbox 360.

53:24.653 --> 53:26.814
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember last week was a dead week because of the holidays.

53:27.355 --> 53:30.057
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're back in the swing of things this week.

53:30.217 --> 53:32.359
[SPEAKER_09]: 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa comes out this week on the 360.

53:33.320 --> 53:35.201
[SPEAKER_09]: Also a game on the 360 called Metro 2033.

53:35.642 --> 53:38.024
[SPEAKER_09]: This is coming from THQ.

53:38.184 --> 53:39.885
[SPEAKER_09]: I have not heard a lot about what this game is all about.

53:39.945 --> 53:43.728
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a Russian first-person shooter game, kind of like a post-apocalyptic type thing.

53:43.849 --> 53:44.569
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, it looks like fun.

53:44.609 --> 53:45.370
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that coming out over here?

53:45.530 --> 53:46.671
[SPEAKER_07]: It came out last month.

53:46.751 --> 53:47.952
[SPEAKER_09]: Or actually it came out in March.

53:48.032 --> 53:48.352
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

54:14.496 --> 54:18.299
[SPEAKER_09]: Going on to the Nintendo Wii, also the FIFA World Cup South Africa game.

54:18.419 --> 54:21.161
[SPEAKER_09]: Other than that, not a whole lot coming out.

54:21.221 --> 54:28.485
[SPEAKER_09]: PlayStation 2 gets Daisen Ryaku, Daitua Kobushi, Tora Tora Tora, where Kishu ni Seku Seri.

54:28.865 --> 54:30.887
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that is the full name of the game.

54:30.907 --> 54:31.647
[SPEAKER_09]: Best version.

54:31.767 --> 54:32.508
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the best hits.

54:32.828 --> 54:41.033
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's probably a price reduction of an existing PS2 game because are any developers really making that many games anymore?

54:41.053 --> 54:41.533
[SPEAKER_09]: PlayStation 2?

54:41.573 --> 54:41.834
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

54:42.194 --> 54:42.414
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

54:42.714 --> 54:44.956
[SPEAKER_09]: Very few, but they're still coming.

54:45.356 --> 54:47.297
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically looks like your Ace Combat clone.

54:47.777 --> 54:49.839
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what you have on the PlayStation 2.

54:50.379 --> 54:55.082
[SPEAKER_09]: And then lastly, looking at the handhelds and the PSP, you also have the World Cup South Africa game.

54:55.922 --> 55:00.905
[SPEAKER_09]: Hakyoki Yugi Roku comes out as well on the DS and the PS.

55:00.945 --> 55:04.468
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, that's just the PSP where that is coming out.

55:04.848 --> 55:06.489
[SPEAKER_09]: I got my handhelds mixed up.

55:07.109 --> 55:09.491
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what the point is there though.

55:09.531 --> 55:11.733
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't say a lot about it.

55:22.603 --> 55:31.185
[SPEAKER_09]: So lastly on the DS, Trick DS Han Kakushi Kami no Sumo-Kan is supposed to come out this week.

55:31.345 --> 55:34.086
[SPEAKER_09]: It's known as Trick, and it's from Konami.

55:34.686 --> 55:37.547
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know if this game's about getting tricks or what.

55:37.607 --> 55:43.828
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I think it's kind of like a survival horror, but one of those slower-paced adventure games.

55:43.948 --> 55:50.490
[SPEAKER_09]: Imagine if something like Ace Attorney was a survival horror game.

55:51.070 --> 55:52.511
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what trick kind of looks like to me.

55:52.751 --> 55:54.991
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's ghost trick is what's coming out over here.

55:55.091 --> 55:56.312
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, okay.

55:56.612 --> 56:01.534
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, and the reason why it looks like the Ace Attorney series, it's the same guy that's doing the artwork for it.

56:01.654 --> 56:03.054
[SPEAKER_07]: Aha, so it's not just coincidence.

56:03.074 --> 56:04.935
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is coming out over here as ghost trick later on.

56:05.335 --> 56:05.935
[SPEAKER_07]: From Capcom.

56:06.775 --> 56:08.296
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it for Japan, Dark Sakura.

56:09.491 --> 56:13.013
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, for Europe, we have a few things.

56:13.173 --> 56:19.957
[SPEAKER_15]: On the 11th, we've got Age of Conan, Rise of the Godslayer, Lost Planet 2 for Xbox 360 and PS3.

56:20.197 --> 56:30.443
[SPEAKER_15]: On the 14th, we have Alan Wake, Naruto Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Skate 3.

56:31.583 --> 56:32.444
[SPEAKER_15]: That's about it.

56:33.985 --> 56:34.405
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

56:35.330 --> 56:39.631
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a couple more news stories for you guys, then we're going to get into the classic game of the week.

56:40.611 --> 56:41.712
[SPEAKER_09]: But for now, some more news.

56:42.852 --> 56:44.652
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, there was a countdown.

56:45.652 --> 56:59.076
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, apparently if you got the platinum trophy on God of War 3, it gave you a link to a website run by Ready at Dawn teasing a new God of War game.

56:59.256 --> 57:02.156
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the new God of War game is going to be a PSP exclusive.

57:02.216 --> 57:04.137
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called God of War Ghosts of Sparta.

57:04.817 --> 57:09.298
[SPEAKER_07]: and it is also being developed by Ready at Dawn and looks pretty awesome.

57:09.438 --> 57:11.779
[SPEAKER_07]: No word exactly on when it's going to be coming out.

57:12.119 --> 57:14.300
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably something that will show around at E3.

57:16.281 --> 57:22.822
[SPEAKER_07]: But they were saying that it's going to feature save-the-art visuals and high-quality environments and characters.

57:22.882 --> 57:29.184
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition, the Ghost of Sparta will offer 25% more gameplay than its PSP predecessor.

57:29.204 --> 57:29.184
25%?!

57:29.925 --> 57:31.145
[SPEAKER_07]: That's almost a fourth!

57:33.877 --> 58:02.485
[SPEAKER_07]: and judging by the screenshots though it does look pretty good and I'd say it's actually really good for a PSP game but I remember the God of War game Chains of Olympus looked pretty awesome on the PSP played quite a bit of that one and probably have to check this out I haven't gotten a PSP game in a long time really need to check out LittleBigPlanet 2 on PSP I think that might be cool so I think they had some new levels in that alright

58:04.039 --> 58:05.140
[SPEAKER_15]: He sounds so speculative.

58:05.900 --> 58:11.444
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I had to find my PSP because I have like I have a few PSPs.

58:11.724 --> 58:14.245
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember if I have one that still has an official firmware on it.

58:14.385 --> 58:15.106
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I do.

58:17.107 --> 58:24.812
[SPEAKER_09]: Salacious Pop in chat says the first PSP God of War had A++++ visuals and gameplay but damn was the story milk toast and lame.

58:26.093 --> 58:27.794
[SPEAKER_15]: I like when people can use the word milk toast.

58:27.994 --> 58:31.336
[SPEAKER_09]: I have not heard that used in a sentence in a very long time.

58:31.556 --> 58:35.100
[SPEAKER_15]: The last time I actually saw anything with milk toast in it was reading Bloom County.

58:52.300 --> 58:59.782
[SPEAKER_09]: That forum had a little contest, I guess you could say, a little Photoshopping contest about what would Mario look like if it was released today?

59:00.383 --> 59:08.065
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of the results are really funny because you get kind of the achievement unlocked, you know, hey, you got a one-up, five gamerscore.

59:08.816 --> 59:27.414
[SPEAKER_09]: tutorial levels built in you know just kind of like they're doing with the new Mario games my favorite absolutely was the one that made it look like a Facebook game you squashed a Goomba achievement and then it says do you want to post this to your wall you just got an achievement Super Mario Brothers so and so just got the Goomba Squisher achievement and wants everyone to know

59:28.942 --> 59:30.984
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thought that was so on point.

59:31.545 --> 59:32.866
[SPEAKER_09]: So on point.

59:33.567 --> 59:35.709
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if you think about it, that's already there.

59:36.710 --> 59:38.472
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm just as guilty as the next guy.

59:38.812 --> 59:43.677
[SPEAKER_09]: PS3 will post your achievements to your wall.

59:43.717 --> 59:45.699
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember when everybody was kind of talking about that feature?

59:45.719 --> 59:47.000
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm sure some of you blocked it.

59:47.400 --> 59:51.865
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, when I unlock trophies in Super Street Fighter, my wall knows about it.

59:53.226 --> 59:55.187
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, except for those of us that blocked him.

59:55.508 --> 59:59.130
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan runs that Raptor thing, and every day I can see he's playing World of Warcraft.

59:59.170 --> 01:00:03.693
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I know if that thing doesn't publish one day, I should probably make sure he's okay.

01:00:08.799 --> 01:00:14.282
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anyhow, kind of neat to see some of the concepts of what would happen if Mario was released today.

01:00:15.682 --> 01:00:18.684
[SPEAKER_09]: Any ideas on how it might be different if Mario was released today?

01:00:22.186 --> 01:00:26.848
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we know what Mario would be like if it's released today, because we keep getting Mario games.

01:00:28.513 --> 01:00:30.034
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, they have the tutorial levels in there.

01:00:30.334 --> 01:00:34.497
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason why is because people nowadays don't want to spend the time to read the manual.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.981
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, I think that's a good idea.

01:00:40.261 --> 01:00:49.768
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know a lot of stuff now is coming out digitally and stuff, so there isn't really necessarily manuals for it.

01:00:49.808 --> 01:00:53.310
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you think about it, though, if you just want to jump into a game and play it,

01:00:54.611 --> 01:00:58.195
[SPEAKER_07]: Then, you know, back then you could do that and there's no wasting time.

01:00:59.036 --> 01:01:02.720
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't understand what's going on or you have difficulty, then you can refer to the manual.

01:01:03.081 --> 01:01:07.325
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but think about like some of the greatest games from the 80s that were all like the coin-op games.

01:01:07.626 --> 01:01:08.707
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have a manual.

01:01:08.827 --> 01:01:10.489
[SPEAKER_09]: You should be able to just put in a quarter and play.

01:01:10.629 --> 01:01:12.191
[SPEAKER_15]: The button says fire.

01:01:12.852 --> 01:01:14.433
[SPEAKER_15]: That means fire.

01:01:15.254 --> 01:01:24.078
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, also, I mean, there are a lot of times you would have either like a little brief tutorial, and I mean like five to ten second tutorial in the beginning.

01:01:24.358 --> 01:01:24.618
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.

01:01:24.638 --> 01:01:26.559
[SPEAKER_07]: Like some of the Neo Geo games would say, okay, here's what you do.

01:01:27.099 --> 01:01:32.341
[SPEAKER_07]: And there would be instructions on the cabinet so that, you know, okay, you know, 500 points gives me an extra life.

01:01:32.721 --> 01:01:37.263
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, if I hit, you know, fire and jump together, I get a special attack.

01:01:37.363 --> 01:01:38.283
[SPEAKER_09]: Or like Street Fighter 2.

01:01:39.144 --> 01:01:43.765
[SPEAKER_09]: When they started making the newer cabinets, they would actually put on there little things that had all the moves on them.

01:01:43.966 --> 01:01:44.186
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:01:44.206 --> 01:01:44.506
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:01:46.127 --> 01:02:09.609
[SPEAKER_09]: you can actually do that with some of the Neo Geo games that are out on Xbox Live like I know Fatal Fury Special you can actually have the background just show that old little plastic card that has the moves on it pretty cool alright let's get into a segment here on the show we do every week and it's a lot of fun because we get to talk about old stuff

01:02:11.715 --> 01:02:13.016
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a classic game of the week.

01:02:13.316 --> 01:02:25.265
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura is going to dive into the vault and pull out a classic video game that she thinks, you know what, you ungrateful little kids out there, you should try a classic game and know your roots a little better.

01:02:25.525 --> 01:02:25.866
[SPEAKER_09]: Do it!

01:02:25.886 --> 01:02:26.666
[SPEAKER_09]: Where you came from.

01:02:26.806 --> 01:02:27.126
[SPEAKER_09]: Do it!

01:02:27.227 --> 01:02:27.807
[SPEAKER_09]: Do it!

01:02:28.087 --> 01:02:29.889
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so what game should they be playing this week?

01:02:30.029 --> 01:02:30.549
[SPEAKER_15]: Final Fantasy 2.

01:02:30.609 --> 01:02:34.252
[SPEAKER_09]: You mean actual Final Fantasy 2.

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:35.613
[SPEAKER_15]: The actual Final Fantasy 2.

01:02:36.594 --> 01:02:38.455
[SPEAKER_15]: Which I actually own the cartridge of, by the way.

01:02:39.096 --> 01:02:39.576
[SPEAKER_09]: Very nice.

01:02:39.656 --> 01:02:44.259
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's actually take a look here at some of the music from Final Fantasy II, if we can.

01:02:48.401 --> 01:02:54.185
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually had the number that I gave you on that was to the battle music.

01:02:54.265 --> 01:02:57.086
[SPEAKER_09]: A little hard to get to the exact right point on YouTube, sorry.

01:02:59.148 --> 01:03:02.269
[SPEAKER_15]: At any rate, this is the theme, you know.

01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:03.750
[SPEAKER_15]: Now you can skip up.

01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:04.251
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

01:03:05.431 --> 01:03:13.136
[SPEAKER_15]: Final Fantasy 2 was actually pretty innovative on an innovative sequel to the last Final Fantasy.

01:03:13.997 --> 01:03:14.837
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, to the first one.

01:03:16.598 --> 01:03:27.805
[SPEAKER_15]: It's, of course, like every Final Fantasy with a fresh number is, it's a different series of characters, a different world, a different dimension.

01:03:29.146 --> 01:03:38.288
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so, um, this one is, there's these four people that are killed in an army invasion in Palamecia.

01:03:38.929 --> 01:03:42.129
[SPEAKER_15]: And three of the characters join a rebellion and the other one turns out missing.

01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:42.950
[SPEAKER_15]: Ooh.

01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:50.511
[SPEAKER_15]: So, um, with this one, it actually brought in a lot of stuff that we, you know, take for granted now in a Final Fantasy game.

01:03:51.032 --> 01:03:52.312
[SPEAKER_15]: Like Chocobos.

01:03:53.153 --> 01:03:53.774
[SPEAKER_15]: and Sid.

01:03:54.576 --> 01:03:55.618
[SPEAKER_15]: There's always a Sid.

01:03:55.779 --> 01:03:56.440
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

01:03:57.001 --> 01:04:01.953
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people assumed that Chocobos were in the very first game as well as Sid and those didn't appear until two.

01:04:02.722 --> 01:04:04.023
[SPEAKER_15]: No, you are right, Rob.

01:04:04.504 --> 01:04:06.545
[SPEAKER_15]: It also got rid of experience point leveling.

01:04:09.628 --> 01:04:11.690
[SPEAKER_15]: And, of course, the later ones used it.

01:04:11.770 --> 01:04:21.818
[SPEAKER_15]: But it used a system where statistics increased depending on how you use the character or how you acquire, I guess.

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:25.902
[SPEAKER_15]: Keep in mind, when I first started playing this game back in the day...

01:04:26.582 --> 01:04:29.966
[SPEAKER_15]: I was playing a ROM in Japanese, and I kind of gave up.

01:04:30.106 --> 01:04:32.929
[SPEAKER_15]: I played through a bit more of 3 than I did of 2.

01:04:34.411 --> 01:04:35.953
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm really enjoying it now.

01:04:36.253 --> 01:04:39.016
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the best way to level is to beat your friends, basically.

01:04:39.937 --> 01:04:40.939
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, anyway.

01:04:45.584 --> 01:04:46.225
[SPEAKER_15]: It's actually...

01:04:47.905 --> 01:04:53.929
[SPEAKER_15]: was kind of... Well, you know, they were gonna do this one, Rob.

01:04:54.850 --> 01:05:00.854
[SPEAKER_15]: Nintendo actually has... What you're looking at now for our YouTube thing is off the prototype that Nintendo did.

01:05:01.114 --> 01:05:01.395
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.

01:05:01.955 --> 01:05:04.257
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's where they got the prototype translation.

01:05:05.637 --> 01:05:13.823
[SPEAKER_15]: This one had another really cool thing, as you can see on the video now, Rob, where you have a memory system where you can...

01:05:16.785 --> 01:05:31.279
[SPEAKER_15]: a keyword will pop up and you can ask to learn the keyword and once you learn the keyword you can go talk to different people and if it gives you the opportunity to ask them you can use a different keyword and they'll give you new information based on using that keyword

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:40.044
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, the first one that you get in, you know, right when you join the rebellion is, I think it's Wild Rose.

01:05:40.304 --> 01:05:42.365
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can go around and you say, Wild Rose!

01:05:42.445 --> 01:05:43.146
[SPEAKER_15]: To random people.

01:05:43.566 --> 01:05:46.447
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're like, I'm really... Or Ivy in this prototype.

01:05:47.188 --> 01:05:48.828
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm really not a senile old man.

01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:50.049
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a super blacksmith.

01:05:50.389 --> 01:05:52.470
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why I'm hanging out at the blacksmith shop.

01:05:52.931 --> 01:05:53.211
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

01:05:54.498 --> 01:05:56.800
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want them to think I'm anything other than a silly old man.

01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:03.263
[SPEAKER_15]: So the characters in here, and actually, I don't remember that the characters had... Do the characters have names?

01:06:04.364 --> 01:06:06.826
[SPEAKER_15]: The Warriors of Light have names in the Japanese version?

01:06:06.846 --> 01:06:07.786
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I don't think they did.

01:06:08.687 --> 01:06:13.529
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you could just name them and they had default names, kind of like how it works here.

01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:22.295
[SPEAKER_15]: In the US one, well, there was, you know, Fighter, you know, BL Mage, you know, or B Mage or whatever.

01:06:24.637 --> 01:06:30.443
[SPEAKER_15]: This one, the characters, you have Firion, or Frianiel in the Japanese version.

01:06:30.583 --> 01:06:35.588
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you've got Maria, Guy, who, when they brought this out on PlayStation, his name was Gus.

01:06:36.529 --> 01:06:39.032
[SPEAKER_15]: And Leon, in the Japanese version, his name was Leonhard.

01:06:39.973 --> 01:06:40.773
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, um...

01:06:41.434 --> 01:06:43.395
[SPEAKER_15]: You spend a lot of the game looking for Leon, by the way.

01:06:44.856 --> 01:06:51.761
[SPEAKER_15]: You can also get other people that hang out with you from time to time in your party, like Gordon and Joseph and Layla.

01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:54.682
[SPEAKER_15]: Meanwoo, the PlayStation version was Meendoo.

01:06:55.563 --> 01:06:56.784
[SPEAKER_15]: And Richard Highwind.

01:06:56.864 --> 01:06:58.945
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we noticing themes that come up in later games?

01:06:59.105 --> 01:07:01.487
[SPEAKER_15]: Highwind, you know, Leonheart.

01:07:03.028 --> 01:07:03.608
[SPEAKER_15]: Sound familiar?

01:07:03.628 --> 01:07:04.629
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit.

01:07:06.716 --> 01:07:12.918
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, again, this is one that really, really, you know, set a big theme.

01:07:13.118 --> 01:07:23.642
[SPEAKER_15]: And also, of course, Furion and Matthias, who is the Emperor, um, the bad guy in the game, uh, they both were in Dissidia, um, as their versus each other character.

01:07:24.822 --> 01:07:31.085
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, but I'm not really gonna go too much into the story.

01:07:31.305 --> 01:07:34.726
[SPEAKER_15]: The other thing, though, about this, another class that this introduced was the Dragoon.

01:07:36.765 --> 01:07:37.966
[SPEAKER_15]: The Dragoon and the Dark Knight.

01:07:37.986 --> 01:07:41.269
[SPEAKER_15]: You could sort of get kind of a Dark Knight.

01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:45.412
[SPEAKER_15]: This had Dark Knights and Dragoons in them.

01:07:46.533 --> 01:07:51.278
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot more story driven, a lot more character driven too than the previous versions.

01:07:52.138 --> 01:07:54.980
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as, well, the previous version, I should say.

01:07:56.901 --> 01:08:14.830
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, another thing is that it did have re-releases, and I was really irritated because I was waiting for Final Fantasy 3 to come out on the WonderSwan Color, because I have the remake of the first Final Fantasy on the WonderSwan Color, which was beautiful, it was gorgeous.

01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:18.311
[SPEAKER_15]: Final Fantasy 2 came out and I was like, I didn't play too much of it.

01:08:18.351 --> 01:08:20.873
[SPEAKER_15]: I was waiting for Final Fantasy 3 and then they went right to 4.

01:08:22.654 --> 01:08:34.219
[SPEAKER_15]: But they did a collection re-release for the PlayStation in 2002 that was based off the Game Boy Advance re-release of Final Fantasy 1 and 2, Dawn of Souls.

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:39.101
[SPEAKER_15]: And then it came out on mobiles later and then the PSP version in 2007.

01:08:39.682 --> 01:08:44.064
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the Japanese Wii Virtual Console got a version last year on June 16th.

01:08:46.391 --> 01:08:57.658
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, what I think is super cool, and this makes me really happy, is that we've had other releases now.

01:08:57.718 --> 01:09:00.960
[SPEAKER_15]: Final Fantasy Origins was the first release outside of Japan.

01:09:03.981 --> 01:09:06.803
[SPEAKER_15]: But it came out on iPhone.

01:09:07.543 --> 01:09:09.525
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have been digging it on iPhone.

01:09:10.385 --> 01:09:16.290
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think part of it for me was not being able to read all that well when I was playing it the first time.

01:09:16.830 --> 01:09:20.893
[SPEAKER_15]: But now that I'm actually playing it in English, I'm having a pretty good time playing it.

01:09:20.953 --> 01:09:27.058
[SPEAKER_15]: The iPhone controls are interesting, but it's really, I think, as good as they can expect to do those controls.

01:09:27.118 --> 01:09:28.459
[SPEAKER_15]: It actually works fairly well.

01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:45.470
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, the way that it sold in 2003, um, well, by March 31st, 2003, with all of its re-releases, had 1.28 million copies worldwide, and, uh, with 1.08 million of those in Japan.

01:09:46.831 --> 01:09:50.954
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, it's just, it's a really good game.

01:09:51.014 --> 01:09:52.395
[SPEAKER_15]: I suggest everyone play it, so...

01:10:05.687 --> 01:10:20.558
[SPEAKER_09]: Final Fantasy 2 is your classic game of the week and it's available originally on the NES but probably a little more accessible on some of those redone versions the Dark Sakura earlier referenced most commonly the PSP these days and the iPhone versions so check it out Final Fantasy 2

01:10:21.499 --> 01:10:27.522
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we're going to go ahead and use this opportunity to take a quick break, but when we come back we have plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:10:27.582 --> 01:10:38.508
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to talk about some of the fan films that have hit the internet, a new Bomani game, and a new non-Bomani game, but might as well be a Bomani game, and talk a little bit about a game called Babymaker.

01:10:38.788 --> 01:10:40.569
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that's right, Babymaker.

01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:45.132
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, so stick around.

01:10:51.656 --> 01:10:56.601
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, this 366th episode of our show.

01:10:57.041 --> 01:10:59.664
[SPEAKER_09]: May 9th, 2010, already in progress.

01:10:59.704 --> 01:11:06.310
[SPEAKER_09]: We're here for Part B. More news, fast topics, and all that fun stuff in a few weeks here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:11:06.511 --> 01:11:07.692
[SPEAKER_09]: E3 is going to be...

01:11:08.132 --> 01:11:10.314
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

01:11:34.151 --> 01:11:36.154
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news.

01:11:36.174 --> 01:11:41.002
[SPEAKER_09]: We have some fast stuff we like to call Rapid Fire Topics and Loki's gonna start it off.

01:11:43.285 --> 01:11:43.566
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope.

01:11:43.908 --> 01:11:44.449
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I am.

01:11:44.469 --> 01:11:45.650
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, there you are.

01:11:45.670 --> 01:11:46.371
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of cool.

01:11:47.071 --> 01:11:51.135
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though the game's not out yet, they're already talking about download content for Red Dead Redemption.

01:11:51.736 --> 01:11:56.000
[SPEAKER_07]: And the first piece of download content is going to be coming shortly after its release in June.

01:11:56.601 --> 01:12:01.086
[SPEAKER_07]: And it will be getting a free co-op expansion, which is kind of cool.

01:12:01.106 --> 01:12:05.951
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to have some new, I guess, I'm not sure these are missions.

01:12:06.431 --> 01:12:08.713
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:12:25.588 --> 01:12:54.290
[SPEAKER_07]: and AmiMission which the Mexican army has I guess a town under siege and you have to storm the gates under heavy cannon fire and that sounds kind of cool and those are going to be compatible with up to two to four players and doesn't say exactly when they'll be coming out in June but sometime during June also they're saying that they're going to be having some more two more additional download content updates over the summer

01:12:55.431 --> 01:12:57.493
[SPEAKER_07]: However, those are unlikely to be free.

01:12:59.954 --> 01:13:01.495
[SPEAKER_07]: Pricing, I guess, will be announced later on.

01:13:03.797 --> 01:13:11.862
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, in May, we've got some more songs becoming available for Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero.

01:13:13.303 --> 01:13:20.187
[SPEAKER_07]: Starting off with May 6th, the Classic Rock Track Pack 3, which you can get the whole pack for 440 Microsoft Points, or $5.49.

01:13:20.227 --> 01:13:20.287
[SPEAKER_07]: And

01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:34.535
[SPEAKER_07]: Regular Money, and that includes Jukebox Hero by Foreigner, Sweet Home Alabama by Leonard Skinner, and Take the Money and Run by the Steve Miller Band.

01:13:34.875 --> 01:13:35.275
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

01:13:36.036 --> 01:13:37.496
[SPEAKER_15]: I love that song.

01:13:37.577 --> 01:13:43.620
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a Guitar Hero pack coming out with Foreigner, Skinner, and Steve Miller Band.

01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:54.807
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like the county fair pack right there.

01:13:55.167 --> 01:14:01.151
[SPEAKER_09]: I was driving home from the bay today, and you have to drive through the middle of nowhere to get between San Francisco and Sac, right?

01:14:01.531 --> 01:14:04.053
[SPEAKER_09]: And sure enough, come into Dixon, the Dixon County Fair.

01:14:04.573 --> 01:14:05.214
[SPEAKER_09]: Foreigner!

01:14:07.735 --> 01:14:15.661
[SPEAKER_07]: and also of course the Classic Brock track pack was available on May 6th.

01:14:15.721 --> 01:14:19.003
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course it will not be available for the PlayStation 3 until May 11th.

01:14:20.804 --> 01:14:24.627
[SPEAKER_07]: Also on May 11th, the Alternative Pop track pack coming out.

01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:26.048
[SPEAKER_07]: Same pricing there.

01:14:26.448 --> 01:14:34.053
[SPEAKER_07]: Including with that would be Facedown by AlphaRev, Lode by Capra, and You're All I Have by Snow Patrol.

01:14:35.334 --> 01:14:42.999
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are also available for 160 Microsoft Points each or 200 Wii Points, $2, real money.

01:14:43.399 --> 01:14:50.164
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally, the Aerosmith track pack, which includes Livin' on the Edge, Lovin' in an Elevator, and Ragdoll.

01:14:50.184 --> 01:14:50.824
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, wait, wait.

01:14:50.864 --> 01:14:53.006
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't Aerosmith have like a Guitar Hero game?

01:14:53.246 --> 01:14:59.049
[SPEAKER_07]: They may have with all those tracks in there, but hey, if you don't have those... Why not buy them all over again?

01:14:59.590 --> 01:15:00.110
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:00.951
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

01:15:01.951 --> 01:15:02.252
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

01:15:04.309 --> 01:15:04.929
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

01:15:22.781 --> 01:15:23.882
[SPEAKER_07]: That's already been confirmed.

01:15:24.162 --> 01:15:24.663
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, whatever.

01:15:24.963 --> 01:15:37.711
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, other stuff that's coming out on the Xbox Live Marketplace in May, including, let's see here, May 17th, the deal of the week will be Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition.

01:15:37.731 --> 01:15:40.173
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to be able to get that for half off for $5.

01:15:40.833 --> 01:15:43.055
[SPEAKER_07]: They're also going to have some Avatar items as well.

01:15:43.495 --> 01:15:48.478
[SPEAKER_07]: Lee Chuck Pirate Hat for $0.50 and Avatar Cotton Swab.

01:15:48.519 --> 01:15:50.280
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, the giant cotton swab for

01:15:52.781 --> 01:15:53.462
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess a dollar.

01:15:54.902 --> 01:15:55.863
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

01:15:56.343 --> 01:15:59.265
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's more expensive than an actual cotton swab, by the way.

01:15:59.505 --> 01:16:00.766
[SPEAKER_07]: You paid a whole dollar for that?

01:16:01.366 --> 01:16:03.047
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I wouldn't pay for that.

01:16:03.327 --> 01:16:04.728
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, that's what they're asking for.

01:16:05.588 --> 01:16:07.009
[SPEAKER_07]: New games on demand are going to be coming out.

01:16:07.629 --> 01:16:10.331
[SPEAKER_07]: Last week we had Brothers in Arms, Hell's Highway, and Prince of Persia.

01:16:11.952 --> 01:16:26.819
[SPEAKER_07]: This week on the 11th we have Tom Clancy's End War May 18th in the Asian region Command & Conquer 3 And on May 25th Battlefield 2 Modern Combat will be available in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand only

01:16:27.139 --> 01:16:31.802
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I was going to say, when did they start doing new games on demand every week?

01:16:31.902 --> 01:16:34.344
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're not really doing new games on demand every week.

01:16:34.364 --> 01:16:35.765
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just different regions are getting it.

01:16:36.005 --> 01:16:36.305
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

01:16:37.306 --> 01:16:42.169
[SPEAKER_07]: Last week we had Xenoclash Ultimate Edition for $15, 1200 Microsoft points, and Raystorm HD also for $15.

01:16:42.209 --> 01:16:42.749
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like $15 and new $10.

01:16:42.789 --> 01:16:43.230
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

01:16:49.074 --> 01:16:54.098
[SPEAKER_07]: This week on May 12th, Rocket Knight Adventures will be coming out for $15 or 1,200 Microsoft points.

01:16:54.699 --> 01:17:03.948
[SPEAKER_07]: And on June 2nd, which technically isn't May, even though this is a May list, and technically isn't a game I care about, Snoopy Flying Ace coming out for $10.

01:17:04.228 --> 01:17:05.489
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what?

01:17:05.569 --> 01:17:07.731
[SPEAKER_07]: That's $10 more than you should really pay for that.

01:17:08.272 --> 01:17:09.833
[SPEAKER_07]: Will Snoopy be fighting the Red Baron?

01:17:10.194 --> 01:17:12.236
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, probably, because that's all he ever does.

01:17:13.117 --> 01:17:13.597
[SPEAKER_07]: Get over it!

01:17:13.637 --> 01:17:14.859
[SPEAKER_09]: That was World War II!

01:17:14.919 --> 01:17:17.964
[SPEAKER_09]: Will Woodstock be in there to talk in his little lines?

01:17:18.845 --> 01:17:19.966
[SPEAKER_09]: I always loved Woodstock's speech.

01:17:21.514 --> 01:17:21.854
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:17:23.515 --> 01:17:28.676
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the Avatar Marketplace will be getting some Final Fantasy XIII and Gamer items.

01:17:29.277 --> 01:17:33.298
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if those Final Fantasy XIII items were the same ones that you got for registering the game.

01:17:33.978 --> 01:17:34.238
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't know.

01:17:35.219 --> 01:17:40.941
[SPEAKER_07]: Army of Two and Kingdom for Kefling items will be available May 13th as well.

01:17:41.321 --> 01:17:42.601
[SPEAKER_07]: Finally, download content.

01:17:43.261 --> 01:17:49.524
[SPEAKER_07]: No Doubt is getting the Tragic Kingdom album for Rock Band, which I think that came out last week.

01:17:49.624 --> 01:17:50.884
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we talked about it last week.

01:17:52.445 --> 01:18:12.041
[SPEAKER_07]: Lips is getting the Miley Cyrus song pack and Forza Motorsports 3 is getting the exotic car pack Super Street Fighter 4 is getting the Super Shuriken pack and Dragon Age Origins is getting the Darkspawn Chronicles pack as well

01:18:12.461 --> 01:18:19.484
[SPEAKER_07]: and also sometime, they didn't say when, Magic Gathering Duels of the Planeswalker will be getting a second expansion pack.

01:18:20.085 --> 01:18:35.092
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, speaking of Snoopy and all that stuff, when Loki was reading a lot of those releases, you know, those really exciting releases for the month of May, this is kind of what I was hearing was a lot of, you know, the teacher from Charlie Brown. ...

01:18:38.837 --> 01:18:39.698
[SPEAKER_06]: He said my name.

01:18:39.798 --> 01:18:42.502
[SPEAKER_08]: Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

01:18:42.522 --> 01:18:45.145
[SPEAKER_08]: Wah, wah, wah, wah.

01:18:45.265 --> 01:18:45.886
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, Ms.

01:18:45.906 --> 01:18:46.447
[SPEAKER_15]: Trombone.

01:18:48.945 --> 01:18:49.725
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:19:19.478 --> 01:19:20.619
[SPEAKER_09]: You can check it out.

01:19:21.119 --> 01:19:25.903
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently it was already at San Diego Comic Con, but now it's there in 15 levels.

01:19:26.844 --> 01:19:28.665
[SPEAKER_09]: You get to blow stuff up.

01:19:28.705 --> 01:19:29.266
[SPEAKER_09]: Have fun.

01:19:31.247 --> 01:19:34.650
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, some new developments in the silver lining.

01:19:35.911 --> 01:19:37.032
[SPEAKER_09]: Drama that's going on.

01:19:37.052 --> 01:19:40.795
[SPEAKER_09]: You might remember the silver lining, because we actually had them on our show a while ago.

01:19:41.355 --> 01:19:49.361
[SPEAKER_09]: It was this fan project for a King's Quest 9, basically, but at the end of the day, they had to take the King's Quest name off of it if they wanted to actually release the game.

01:19:49.982 --> 01:19:54.125
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when Activision got the rights to the game, they were like, well, you're not releasing that game.

01:19:54.605 --> 01:19:57.047
[SPEAKER_09]: And they were like, but boo-hoo, we spent so many years making it.

01:19:57.507 --> 01:19:58.468
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the deal.

01:19:59.028 --> 01:20:04.492
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, I guess it has come full circle that it might actually...

01:20:05.353 --> 01:20:07.315
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:20:29.697 --> 01:20:30.297
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

01:20:51.505 --> 01:21:11.011
[SPEAKER_09]: you can check that out Kotaku ran this story on what was this May 3rd was the date that they ran it and kind of this whole little epic piece about it and yeah Activision I guess finally getting in touch with them realizing they are being dicks got the big stick out their butt Bobby Kotek clearly was not involved

01:21:12.158 --> 01:21:33.290
[SPEAKER_09]: also coming out on the Wii soon a very exciting game called My Fireplace that is if the ESRB is to be believed there will be a game called My Fireplace and you'll be able to actually you know have your own fireplace you can put logs on the fire and decorate the mantle and pump air in the fireplace to keep it going that better be free

01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:37.481
[SPEAKER_09]: Sadly, it's probably WiiWare.

01:21:37.641 --> 01:21:40.763
[SPEAKER_09]: I would guess it's probably going to be $10 WiiWare.

01:21:40.783 --> 01:21:42.904
[SPEAKER_15]: People do buy those fireplace DVDs.

01:21:43.444 --> 01:21:44.324
[SPEAKER_09]: And Blu-rays now.

01:21:44.724 --> 01:21:46.925
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't Xbox have one of those last year?

01:21:47.366 --> 01:21:48.206
[SPEAKER_07]: A fireplace sim?

01:21:48.866 --> 01:21:58.551
[SPEAKER_07]: I think an Xbox fireplace sim is the more appropriate console for that, being that it can put out the heat of a fireplace as well.

01:21:58.631 --> 01:22:02.973
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the Wii fireplace thing deserves to be in the fireplace.

01:22:03.713 --> 01:22:04.454
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:22:28.806 --> 01:22:34.130
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, 77 degrees Celsius, your Intel processor chips don't run that hot.

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:38.333
[SPEAKER_09]: Real quick before we get to DarkSakura's story, some comments from our chat room.

01:22:39.133 --> 01:22:43.036
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the folks in chat, our DJ Dark Knight says, Can't wait for Rocket Knight.

01:22:43.156 --> 01:22:44.777
[SPEAKER_09]: And Actdeft says, Rocket Knight, awesome.

01:22:44.797 --> 01:22:47.959
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess there is at least one game to look forward to in May.

01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:55.204
[SPEAKER_09]: And ToyGak commenting on the Wii Fireplace says, Fucking shitty WiiWare can go choke on a piece of my anatomy.

01:22:56.724 --> 01:22:57.505
[SPEAKER_09]: Elbow Porkchop

01:23:13.257 --> 01:23:16.340
[SPEAKER_15]: Star Trek Adventures Year One Fan Project Fan Project

01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:45.163
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks along the lines of old school Star Trek games, like maybe from the mid to late 90s, possibly.

01:23:45.724 --> 01:23:46.024
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway...

01:23:47.992 --> 01:23:59.421
[SPEAKER_15]: You can go to the official homepage for the project, which is just Star Trek Adventures All In Word dot com slash year one.

01:24:00.182 --> 01:24:01.323
[SPEAKER_15]: See if you like it.

01:24:01.423 --> 01:24:01.823
[SPEAKER_15]: Let us know.

01:24:01.883 --> 01:24:02.364
[SPEAKER_15]: I won't play it.

01:24:02.384 --> 01:24:03.224
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got Star Trek online.

01:24:04.165 --> 01:24:07.548
[SPEAKER_15]: And the next story, which is one that Rob gave me the wrong link to and I had to go find.

01:24:07.853 --> 01:24:08.713
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm sorry, my bad.

01:24:09.573 --> 01:24:10.854
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you sound so sad.

01:24:10.894 --> 01:24:12.794
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry you had to do work tonight, Jamie.

01:24:12.974 --> 01:24:14.395
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very sorry to inconvenience you.

01:24:14.415 --> 01:24:14.735
[SPEAKER_09]: I do work.

01:24:15.755 --> 01:24:16.935
[SPEAKER_15]: Sid Meier's Pirates.

01:24:17.935 --> 01:24:18.476
[SPEAKER_15]: Arr!

01:24:18.976 --> 01:24:21.616
[SPEAKER_15]: Plundering, shooting.

01:24:21.716 --> 01:24:22.777
[SPEAKER_09]: Plundering the booty.

01:24:22.857 --> 01:24:23.897
[SPEAKER_15]: Keelhauling.

01:24:25.717 --> 01:24:31.459
[SPEAKER_15]: It will be on the Wii in the fall and has, so it's got some minigames.

01:24:31.479 --> 01:24:32.879
[SPEAKER_15]: It's put up by 2K China.

01:24:32.899 --> 01:24:33.979
[SPEAKER_15]: Ooh.

01:24:34.479 --> 01:24:36.540
[SPEAKER_15]: With streamlined controls for the Wiimote.

01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:38.580
[SPEAKER_15]: Ooh.

01:24:39.441 --> 01:24:44.382
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the minigames, the two new ones would be Bombardment and Lockpicking.

01:24:45.762 --> 01:24:45.982
[SPEAKER_15]: Ooh.

01:24:46.202 --> 01:24:50.023
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can have character and ship customization options.

01:24:51.624 --> 01:24:51.864
[SPEAKER_15]: Ooh.

01:24:52.224 --> 01:24:52.444
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

01:24:53.824 --> 01:24:57.245
[SPEAKER_15]: And last but never least, except in this case, Rock Band.

01:24:57.925 --> 01:24:59.846
[SPEAKER_15]: We will be getting stuff.

01:25:01.166 --> 01:25:29.756
[SPEAKER_15]: mostly actually all consisting of the Judas Priest British Steel 30th Anniversary Complete Album Pack which will be 1200 points or $14.99 US dollars including on it Breaking the Law Breaking the Law and Rapid Fire Metal Gods Grinder United Living After Midnight Midnight You Don't Have to Be Old to Be Wise The Rage and Stealer but you know it's all for me

01:25:30.456 --> 01:25:32.356
[SPEAKER_15]: Breaking the law, breaking the law.

01:25:32.757 --> 01:25:35.117
[SPEAKER_15]: Or washing the dog, washing the dog.

01:25:36.317 --> 01:25:36.718
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

01:25:37.278 --> 01:25:38.018
[SPEAKER_14]: You remember that?

01:25:38.678 --> 01:25:38.938
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

01:25:39.838 --> 01:25:41.059
[SPEAKER_09]: And I tried very hard to forget.

01:25:41.659 --> 01:25:45.380
[SPEAKER_14]: That was like my favorite episode of Beavis and Butthead.

01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:49.741
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, they put the dog in the dryer, then they put Beavis in the dryer.

01:25:51.341 --> 01:25:52.661
[SPEAKER_14]: I threw up on the dog.

01:25:53.081 --> 01:25:54.182
[SPEAKER_09]: I threw up on you.

01:25:54.562 --> 01:25:56.942
[SPEAKER_09]: My favorite episode of Beavis and Butthead was with the gym teacher.

01:25:57.302 --> 01:25:59.103
[SPEAKER_09]: Today we're going to talk about the penis.

01:26:00.413 --> 01:26:02.094
[SPEAKER_09]: and then we'll talk about the vagina.

01:26:02.434 --> 01:26:05.456
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I played that clip on OLR a few weeks ago.

01:26:05.476 --> 01:26:06.277
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I loved it.

01:26:06.397 --> 01:26:07.218
[SPEAKER_09]: That was my favorite episode.

01:26:07.238 --> 01:26:08.098
[SPEAKER_09]: You should play that again soon.

01:26:08.238 --> 01:26:09.159
[SPEAKER_09]: You want me to play that again soon?

01:26:09.179 --> 01:26:09.879
[SPEAKER_15]: Play that again now.

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:12.061
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's going to take me a minute to find it.

01:26:12.521 --> 01:26:13.642
[SPEAKER_15]: Soon.

01:26:13.742 --> 01:26:14.242
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

01:26:14.342 --> 01:26:17.524
[SPEAKER_09]: Just randomly later in the show, I'll play that clip from Beavis and Butthead.

01:26:17.544 --> 01:26:19.806
[SPEAKER_09]: You won't know when, but it will happen.

01:26:19.906 --> 01:26:21.787
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be during one of my stories, I'm sure.

01:26:23.648 --> 01:26:24.549
[SPEAKER_15]: This will be Matt.

01:26:25.109 --> 01:26:28.472
[SPEAKER_15]: And yeah, this game's gonna come out and it's probably gonna suck.

01:26:28.952 --> 01:26:30.813
[SPEAKER_15]: And today we're talking about the penis!

01:26:31.494 --> 01:26:36.718
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

01:26:37.018 --> 01:26:38.859
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think of my Loki impression?

01:26:38.979 --> 01:26:39.740
[SPEAKER_09]: I have the wah-wah-wah.

01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:40.440
[SPEAKER_09]: It was very good.

01:26:40.941 --> 01:26:41.621
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was pretty spot on.

01:26:41.641 --> 01:26:42.162
[SPEAKER_09]: A little more anger.

01:26:42.182 --> 01:26:42.982
[SPEAKER_09]: A little more anger.

01:26:43.122 --> 01:26:47.886
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I was going for disinterested yet snarky.

01:26:51.772 --> 01:26:52.813
[SPEAKER_07]: That's me, alright.

01:26:53.634 --> 01:26:54.975
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, Loki, heart, heart, heart.

01:26:55.175 --> 01:26:56.156
[SPEAKER_09]: Needs more Smashburger.

01:26:57.057 --> 01:26:57.917
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter topics!

01:26:58.178 --> 01:26:58.938
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

01:26:59.018 --> 01:27:01.641
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter, saving the show from being a complete train wreck.

01:27:01.701 --> 01:27:04.043
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, every week we take your tweets.

01:27:04.503 --> 01:27:07.326
[SPEAKER_09]: Show us your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.

01:27:07.386 --> 01:27:08.687
[SPEAKER_09]: Blue Swim starts us off tonight.

01:27:09.628 --> 01:27:18.656
[SPEAKER_09]: OLR, if you could only have one CD or album to listen to forever while killing the undead after the zombie apocalypse, what would it be?

01:27:22.103 --> 01:27:24.505
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, one album left ever?

01:27:25.265 --> 01:27:28.528
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, while killing the undead after the zombie apocalypse.

01:27:28.928 --> 01:27:36.874
[SPEAKER_09]: See, for me that changes it, because that's not asking like my Desert Island CD, but you're asking what CD am I going to kill all the zombies to after the apocalypse.

01:27:36.894 --> 01:27:38.395
[SPEAKER_09]: That kind of changes my answer a little bit.

01:27:39.191 --> 01:28:07.812
[SPEAKER_15]: um I would have to you know for me because I'll listen to his custom CDs anyway um I'd actually I'd have one of two now if I was just watching the zombies it would definitely be the soundtrack to Shaun of the Dead but if I'm out there killing them it would be Anthrax's Attack of the Killer Bees just so I can put uh bring the noise on repeat and just wail on zombies with crowbar and remember Rob double tap

01:28:08.832 --> 01:28:18.395
[SPEAKER_09]: Mine would be the soundtrack to Lost Highway, which was a completely screwed up movie that had a great soundtrack that would be great for zombie killing.

01:28:18.875 --> 01:28:20.516
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, do you have a zombie killing CD?

01:28:20.616 --> 01:28:22.756
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:28:25.417 --> 01:28:28.138
[SPEAKER_09]: Bochikawa says, I'd have to do zombie killing to Space Channel 5.

01:28:28.698 --> 01:28:30.519
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, I put Mexican Flyer in Cage March once.

01:28:32.546 --> 01:28:33.247
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really know.

01:28:33.267 --> 01:28:37.209
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have any albums that would necessarily be good for zombie killing.

01:28:38.050 --> 01:28:42.453
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess... I don't know.

01:28:42.533 --> 01:28:42.933
[SPEAKER_09]: No ideas?

01:28:43.134 --> 01:28:44.575
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, fine.

01:28:44.595 --> 01:28:47.116
[SPEAKER_07]: We can do the Top Gun soundtrack because that would be funny.

01:28:47.237 --> 01:28:48.417
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go, Top Gun soundtrack.

01:28:48.477 --> 01:28:48.978
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that idea.

01:28:48.998 --> 01:28:51.680
[SPEAKER_14]: I head to the danger zone.

01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:54.822
[SPEAKER_14]: BOOM!

01:28:57.044 --> 01:28:58.825
[SPEAKER_09]: Take my breath away.

01:28:59.065 --> 01:28:59.745
[SPEAKER_09]: BANG!

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:03.122
[SPEAKER_09]: Eat your brains away.

01:29:03.182 --> 01:29:04.683
[SPEAKER_09]: Bam!

01:29:04.723 --> 01:29:06.365
[SPEAKER_15]: We used to have... I have to tell you.

01:29:07.266 --> 01:29:09.107
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll tell you the funny story about Becky's son.

01:29:09.308 --> 01:29:10.449
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's sort of related to that.

01:29:10.569 --> 01:29:10.829
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

01:29:11.289 --> 01:29:11.770
[SPEAKER_15]: Please.

01:29:13.452 --> 01:29:15.113
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just playing with Julian and we were talking.

01:29:15.153 --> 01:29:16.675
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, what's in your head?

01:29:16.695 --> 01:29:19.918
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, he's like, brains.

01:29:20.878 --> 01:29:21.079
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

01:29:21.099 --> 01:29:22.700
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, what are your brains like?

01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:23.241
[SPEAKER_15]: Space.

01:29:23.621 --> 01:29:24.221
[SPEAKER_15]: Spicy!

01:29:24.541 --> 01:29:28.663
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I'm gonna have to go with Maze Satsuma, Rob Zombie.

01:29:29.743 --> 01:29:30.203
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude!

01:29:30.603 --> 01:29:34.104
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no, it would have to be the old school white zombie album from 93.

01:29:34.364 --> 01:29:35.925
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh god.

01:29:36.345 --> 01:29:38.285
[SPEAKER_09]: More human than human!

01:29:38.586 --> 01:29:40.006
[SPEAKER_09]: More human than human!

01:29:40.627 --> 01:29:41.007
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously?

01:29:41.027 --> 01:29:42.489
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my white zombie impression.

01:29:42.549 --> 01:29:43.951
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of sounds like an angry St.

01:29:43.971 --> 01:29:44.332
[SPEAKER_09]: Bernard.

01:29:44.953 --> 01:29:50.861
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, SSJ100Matt says, Blues Brothers themed for when you're driving.

01:29:51.542 --> 01:29:53.585
[SPEAKER_15]: And then Frisbee says, blow my parts away.

01:29:56.769 --> 01:29:58.710
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are kind of weird in chat.

01:29:58.750 --> 01:29:59.150
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what?

01:29:59.230 --> 01:30:02.452
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I know what music would be perfect.

01:30:03.093 --> 01:30:07.475
[SPEAKER_09]: Would be just absolutely perfect for Loki to be killing to.

01:30:08.356 --> 01:30:12.318
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe he would have to have this old soundtrack and would kill the zombies to this.

01:30:14.479 --> 01:30:15.399
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a sexy party song.

01:30:15.419 --> 01:30:16.260
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a sexy party song.

01:30:25.467 --> 01:30:29.669
[SPEAKER_09]: I would play any video game with this as the theme song.

01:30:29.689 --> 01:30:33.311
[SPEAKER_15]: Yaris 2, Future Rain, Benny Hill.

01:30:33.932 --> 01:30:36.493
[SPEAKER_09]: Was there ever a Benny Hill video game?

01:30:36.613 --> 01:30:45.197
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what, the weirdness in my brain just went from show theme to show theme to show theme, imagining killing zombies to.

01:30:45.238 --> 01:30:47.018
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know what I finally settled on, Rob?

01:30:47.679 --> 01:30:48.339
[SPEAKER_15]: The facts of life.

01:30:53.544 --> 01:30:55.545
[SPEAKER_14]: You take the good, you take the bad.

01:30:56.446 --> 01:30:59.908
[SPEAKER_14]: Could you imagine just be skipping along with your Uzi?

01:31:06.611 --> 01:31:08.012
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I was trying to play it for you guys.

01:31:08.412 --> 01:31:10.653
[SPEAKER_09]: Stupid YouTube is like too quiet sometimes.

01:31:10.673 --> 01:31:10.994
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's try.

01:31:11.014 --> 01:31:12.054
[SPEAKER_09]: So, okay.

01:31:12.074 --> 01:31:13.015
[SPEAKER_09]: Killing zombies to this.

01:31:13.075 --> 01:31:13.415
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.

01:31:18.075 --> 01:31:19.638
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, this is the stupid pilot episode.

01:31:19.658 --> 01:31:20.259
[SPEAKER_09]: This doesn't work.

01:31:20.339 --> 01:31:20.700
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn it.

01:31:20.981 --> 01:31:23.285
[SPEAKER_09]: How hard is it to find the stupid Facts of Life theme song?

01:31:23.345 --> 01:31:23.766
[SPEAKER_09]: Christ.

01:31:23.786 --> 01:31:24.407
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

01:31:27.673 --> 01:31:28.014
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.

01:31:30.177 --> 01:31:35.140
[SPEAKER_03]: That was, like, later in the series, right before it stopped being a girl's school.

01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:37.601
[SPEAKER_03]: When they, like, sized down most of the cast.

01:31:37.661 --> 01:31:38.061
[SPEAKER_15]: Aw, Tootie.

01:31:38.081 --> 01:31:39.522
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a... She was such a bitch.

01:31:39.562 --> 01:31:39.782
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

01:32:00.037 --> 01:32:03.021
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet Bluestone had no idea his question would turn into this.

01:32:03.602 --> 01:32:06.906
[SPEAKER_15]: X-Link said I would use a song that Betty White sang last night on SNL.

01:32:08.208 --> 01:32:09.510
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's move to the next topic, Rob.

01:32:09.570 --> 01:32:10.150
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, please, please.

01:32:10.591 --> 01:32:11.873
[SPEAKER_09]: We could listen to old theme songs all night.

01:32:12.253 --> 01:32:13.154
[SPEAKER_15]: Although, one more.

01:32:13.795 --> 01:32:15.838
[SPEAKER_15]: Frisbee says Having a Wonderful Time by Tiny Tim.

01:32:17.182 --> 01:32:17.463
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:32:17.703 --> 01:32:20.426
[SPEAKER_09]: And now a couple of chatters are asking, what about the Golden Girls theme?

01:32:20.487 --> 01:32:21.007
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:32:21.488 --> 01:32:24.832
[SPEAKER_09]: MissingNo64 is asking, we need to go back to Twitter topics, please.

01:32:24.993 --> 01:32:26.454
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we all get in the right state of mind, please?

01:32:26.535 --> 01:32:28.958
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me play the music.

01:32:29.078 --> 01:32:30.360
[SPEAKER_09]: Get you back into Twitter topic mood.

01:32:31.843 --> 01:32:35.284
[SPEAKER_09]: MissingNo wants to know, did you ever put up the PAX East All Games mini show?

01:32:35.544 --> 01:32:37.684
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought I did, but maybe not.

01:32:38.304 --> 01:32:39.485
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it aired on All Games.

01:32:39.525 --> 01:32:40.085
[SPEAKER_09]: Fail!

01:32:40.745 --> 01:32:42.025
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I really never put that up?

01:32:42.065 --> 01:32:42.605
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I didn't.

01:32:42.885 --> 01:32:43.466
[SPEAKER_09]: Fail!

01:32:43.586 --> 01:32:43.866
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops.

01:32:44.546 --> 01:32:45.006
[SPEAKER_09]: My bad.

01:32:45.746 --> 01:32:46.826
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have to take care of that.

01:32:47.046 --> 01:32:47.426
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me know.

01:32:47.507 --> 01:32:53.348
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't... Somebody like DarkTetsuya or Tigerclaw or somebody that knows this show or Misty would know if I put that up or not.

01:32:53.428 --> 01:32:56.789
[SPEAKER_09]: So I will... Maybe I do need to put it up.

01:32:56.849 --> 01:32:57.389
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought I did.

01:32:57.929 --> 01:32:58.189
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops.

01:32:58.289 --> 01:32:58.389
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops.

01:32:59.585 --> 01:33:09.392
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft sends us a link to Obama chat, and yes, this has to do with games, because apparently during a grad speech, he actually was kind of dissing video games a little bit.

01:33:11.173 --> 01:33:24.101
[SPEAKER_09]: He apparently was speaking at Hampton University in Virginia and saying, quote, You're coming of age in a 24-7 media environment that bombards us with all kinds of content and exposes us to all kinds of arguments, some of which don't always rank all that high on the truth meter.

01:33:24.522 --> 01:33:28.865
[SPEAKER_09]: With iPods and iPads and Xboxes and Playstations, none of which I know how to work,

01:33:29.585 --> 01:33:36.827
[SPEAKER_09]: Information becomes a distraction, a diversion, a form of entertainment rather than a tool of empowerment, rather than the means of emancipation.

01:33:37.528 --> 01:33:41.909
[SPEAKER_09]: All of this is not only putting new pressures on you, it's putting new pressures on our country and on our democracy.

01:33:45.490 --> 01:33:46.071
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:33:46.451 --> 01:33:49.892
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean... I don't think he was specifically talking about just video games.

01:33:50.032 --> 01:33:51.512
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't take that as a slam.

01:33:52.073 --> 01:33:55.394
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll take that as a, turn off the console and go play outside.

01:33:55.734 --> 01:33:55.914
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:33:55.934 --> 01:33:56.014
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:33:57.192 --> 01:33:59.353
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's nothing wrong with a distraction or diversion.

01:33:59.393 --> 01:34:02.055
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, even President Obama takes vacations to Hawaii.

01:34:02.295 --> 01:34:04.476
[SPEAKER_09]: So everybody needs a diversion every now and then.

01:34:06.097 --> 01:34:10.219
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think he's just saying... The president is the person you want to take vacations.

01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:11.700
[SPEAKER_15]: Imagine the stress.

01:34:12.881 --> 01:34:15.883
[SPEAKER_09]: And Blackwolf in chat is quick to point out that... Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:34:16.343 --> 01:34:18.244
[SPEAKER_09]: Obama has an iPod and a Blackberry.

01:34:18.304 --> 01:34:20.205
[SPEAKER_09]: He did give the Queen of England an iPod, did he not?

01:34:21.556 --> 01:34:23.839
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think one of his speech writers fucked up.

01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:25.702
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops.

01:34:26.383 --> 01:34:27.044
[SPEAKER_13]: That's different.

01:34:27.885 --> 01:34:28.186
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

01:34:29.768 --> 01:34:31.751
[SPEAKER_09]: And Blackwolf says he's addicted to his Blackberry.

01:34:33.479 --> 01:34:39.482
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, then again, wasn't it the Prime Minister of Finland, I believe it was, or one of the area countries?

01:34:40.602 --> 01:34:47.685
[SPEAKER_15]: When the volcanic ash hit Europe, he was stuck in New York running country business from his iPad.

01:34:48.766 --> 01:34:52.847
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's more of a necessity type of thing.

01:34:52.887 --> 01:34:56.009
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, even me, I'd be lost without my iPhone now because I run my life by it.

01:34:56.289 --> 01:34:58.390
[SPEAKER_09]: In my big fat opinion, it's not...

01:35:01.111 --> 01:35:01.391
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?

01:35:02.531 --> 01:35:07.574
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you can use your iPad to be completely unproductive, or you could be pretty productive with it.

01:35:07.714 --> 01:35:09.194
[SPEAKER_09]: It really just depends on how you use it.

01:35:09.534 --> 01:35:15.557
[SPEAKER_09]: You can use your iPad to play stupid video games all day, or you could use it to write a novel.

01:35:15.917 --> 01:35:17.678
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's just however you choose to use it.

01:35:20.256 --> 01:35:21.137
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know.

01:35:21.298 --> 01:35:22.099
[SPEAKER_09]: I used mine for both.

01:35:22.619 --> 01:35:28.648
[SPEAKER_09]: It's probably more of a speech writer than it is an actual Obama quote, but whatever.

01:35:29.629 --> 01:35:30.851
[SPEAKER_09]: Shouldn't say it if he doesn't agree with it.

01:35:31.612 --> 01:35:34.576
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw305 linked us to a multitude of stories.

01:35:34.656 --> 01:35:36.259
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm only going to pick a couple of these here.

01:35:36.699 --> 01:35:37.521
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

01:35:52.182 --> 01:35:56.446
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely has that Street Fighter 4, a little bit of hybrid with Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.

01:35:56.946 --> 01:36:17.843
[SPEAKER_09]: What I thought was most interesting was the character bio section, which seems to confirm some of the characters that will be in the game, including Dante, which I thought was pretty awesome, from Devil May Cry is there, Deadpool, it made DarkSakura squeal, of course, Iron Man, you gotta have that, because, you know, smashing box office records, or actually, no, I don't think it smashed records this weekend, but it did very well.

01:36:18.624 --> 01:36:24.612
[SPEAKER_09]: Felicia, Morgan, and all the hot chicks from Darkstalkers Captain America Was that from again?

01:36:25.093 --> 01:36:25.934
[SPEAKER_09]: Felicia and Morgan?

01:36:26.034 --> 01:36:29.479
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no The scan

01:36:30.293 --> 01:36:30.653
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I don't know.

01:36:30.673 --> 01:36:32.293
[SPEAKER_09]: It must be some magazine that's coming out soon.

01:36:32.333 --> 01:36:32.693
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:36:32.753 --> 01:36:34.774
[SPEAKER_09]: He linked me to a website here that had it.

01:36:34.894 --> 01:36:37.274
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm assuming it's some magazines running these screens soon.

01:36:37.294 --> 01:36:42.635
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if you look at some of the screenshots, you can see a little caption there.

01:36:43.055 --> 01:36:44.356
[SPEAKER_07]: That's some sexy stuff right there.

01:36:44.916 --> 01:36:46.056
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like it'll be a pretty hot game.

01:36:46.216 --> 01:36:47.016
[SPEAKER_09]: So looking forward to that.

01:36:47.236 --> 01:36:49.537
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming Spider-Man's in there since the Daily Bugle.

01:36:49.937 --> 01:36:50.477
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gotta be.

01:36:51.417 --> 01:36:55.218
[SPEAKER_09]: So big thanks to Tigerclaw for linking us to that because we were actually peeking at that before the show tonight.

01:36:55.758 --> 01:36:56.558
[SPEAKER_09]: Only a year away.

01:36:57.698 --> 01:37:00.081
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I thought this story was definitely worth talking about.

01:37:00.101 --> 01:37:03.224
[SPEAKER_09]: I think some of his others we already touched on, but I wanted to definitely bring this one up.

01:37:03.725 --> 01:37:08.570
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some rumors going around this week that Zynga is going to split from Facebook.

01:37:08.590 --> 01:37:16.038
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is actually something I think Alan had brought up with me the other night, actually talking about some of the splits that were going on with...

01:37:17.159 --> 01:37:17.720
[SPEAKER_09]: Zynga Zynga

01:37:32.236 --> 01:37:35.157
[SPEAKER_09]: They are actually wanting to launch their own social gaming network.

01:37:35.337 --> 01:37:41.678
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's because there's tensions between Zynga and Facebook because... Well, Facebook just implemented these whole token things recently.

01:37:41.758 --> 01:37:44.719
[SPEAKER_09]: They basically want to kind of go with the Apple methodology.

01:37:44.739 --> 01:37:47.379
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what it had to be said because I think he was making the comparisons to the Apple thing.

01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:53.681
[SPEAKER_09]: This whole Apple methodology of that they want such a big cut of the profits, but maybe...

01:37:55.422 --> 01:37:57.985
[SPEAKER_09]: and maybe they shouldn't be entitled to that.

01:37:58.045 --> 01:37:58.366
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:37:58.806 --> 01:38:03.813
[SPEAKER_09]: So apparently, yeah, Zynga's wanting to split off from Facebook.

01:38:04.133 --> 01:38:08.880
[SPEAKER_09]: However, Facebook is trying to pressure them into a long-term deal, trying to strong-arm them.

01:38:09.441 --> 01:38:11.003
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess there was an all-hands meeting at Zynga.

01:38:11.663 --> 01:38:16.386
[SPEAKER_09]: I personally think they would be completely fucking stupid to split off from Facebook.

01:38:16.786 --> 01:38:23.550
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if they do, they're just another Pogo.com, iWin, or one of those other game network websites.

01:38:23.630 --> 01:38:24.851
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't think they're going to stick out.

01:38:24.911 --> 01:38:28.353
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, yeah, they have Farmville, but people play Farmville because it's a Facebook game.

01:38:28.713 --> 01:38:30.614
[SPEAKER_09]: And they can use all those integrations with Facebook.

01:38:30.874 --> 01:38:32.995
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they would just be kind of ridiculous to do that.

01:38:33.035 --> 01:38:34.496
[SPEAKER_09]: They'd be committing suicide.

01:38:35.397 --> 01:38:37.298
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that I'd really care if they did do that.

01:38:37.598 --> 01:38:37.718
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:38:37.978 --> 01:38:40.280
[SPEAKER_09]: Retro Rear View Retro Rear View

01:38:58.058 --> 01:38:59.259
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that.

01:38:59.279 --> 01:38:59.679
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that.

01:38:59.739 --> 01:39:00.599
[SPEAKER_09]: Retro Rearview.

01:39:01.039 --> 01:39:05.121
[SPEAKER_09]: And this week is all about, I have never fucking heard of this, the Marty.

01:39:05.721 --> 01:39:07.182
[SPEAKER_09]: The FM Towns Marty.

01:39:07.202 --> 01:39:10.884
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a Japanese computer in 1991 by Fujitsu.

01:39:11.284 --> 01:39:15.786
[SPEAKER_09]: And Dark to See tells us a whole lot of information about that at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:39:16.006 --> 01:39:17.987
[SPEAKER_09]: Actual content on our website, OMG.

01:39:19.307 --> 01:39:19.888
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty awesome.

01:39:19.928 --> 01:39:22.829
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks to all the folks that contribute at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:39:24.243 --> 01:39:28.746
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter.com slash OLR, add us, be our friend, yay, we like friends

01:39:48.101 --> 01:39:49.862
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:40:12.653 --> 01:40:13.473
[SPEAKER_07]: So I watched it.

01:40:13.713 --> 01:40:17.156
[SPEAKER_07]: The positives on it, at least Ken looks like Ken in this one.

01:40:17.336 --> 01:40:19.737
[SPEAKER_07]: And Ryu, or Ryu, I guess.

01:40:22.019 --> 01:40:22.799
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I guess.

01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:27.122
[SPEAKER_07]: But he looks, compared, because there were two Street Fighter short films.

01:40:27.282 --> 01:40:31.645
[SPEAKER_07]: Both happen to be in a forest, both with Ryu and Ken.

01:40:33.206 --> 01:40:35.648
[SPEAKER_07]: But props to them for nailing the appearance of Ken.

01:40:36.549 --> 01:40:37.409
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty cool.

01:40:38.430 --> 01:40:39.711
[SPEAKER_07]: Ryu, not so much.

01:40:40.271 --> 01:40:41.592
[SPEAKER_07]: And the effects in it.

01:40:42.032 --> 01:40:42.773
[SPEAKER_07]: Eh, they're alright.

01:40:44.194 --> 01:40:47.436
[SPEAKER_07]: The other Street Fighter film... For a fan film, pretty good, I thought.

01:40:48.517 --> 01:40:50.118
[SPEAKER_09]: Better than anything I could do, that's for damn sure.

01:40:50.138 --> 01:41:03.047
[SPEAKER_07]: The one I liked better, though, was actually the Street Fighter Beginnings End, and for me, I liked the way it was shot better, and the effects were kind of cool, but Ken looks stupid, because...

01:41:03.627 --> 01:41:04.308
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:41:12.546 --> 01:41:13.307
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:41:43.091 --> 01:41:45.372
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I watched that last night.

01:42:05.924 --> 01:42:26.733
[SPEAKER_07]: and Wiley was kind of weird looking but overall it was kind of cool might be fun to check it out but wish there was a little bit more polish on it I guess but hell but they're fan projects exactly it's a fan project and you know good job for them it's just you know some of the stuff just

01:42:28.234 --> 01:42:45.716
[SPEAKER_07]: you know some of the characters were kind of like damn I wish you know this was because they had some of those renders that people were doing for like some of the Mega Man 2 characters and it just looked awesome I just kind of wish they were doing the same thing with these guys but hey props to them it was pretty cool

01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:48.541
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:04.021
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, apparently it is coming back.

01:43:04.382 --> 01:43:08.606
[SPEAKER_09]: It was originally going to come out fall of 2009 against DJ Hero, but it was delayed.

01:43:09.226 --> 01:43:12.169
[SPEAKER_09]: The game is now set to come out on June 26th in Europe.

01:43:12.429 --> 01:43:13.290
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, that's my birthday.

01:43:14.091 --> 01:43:24.440
[SPEAKER_09]: No word about a North American release yet, so I should state this is right now a Europe-only game, which makes sense because unfortunately this type of music has a much better following over there than it does here.

01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:28.164
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't know, I'd be a little worried if this thing would even come out over here.

01:43:28.724 --> 01:43:31.665
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some new screenshots that are posted of the game.

01:43:32.025 --> 01:43:34.086
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, there's no note markers.

01:43:34.166 --> 01:43:40.589
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like you do more of like a twist thing where you kind of like maybe go through these tunnels and maybe point at things.

01:43:41.329 --> 01:43:43.330
[SPEAKER_09]: You would gesture maybe to glow.

01:43:43.410 --> 01:43:45.511
[SPEAKER_09]: We really don't know what the hell this game is about.

01:43:45.871 --> 01:43:47.092
[SPEAKER_09]: But we do have song lists.

01:43:47.392 --> 01:43:47.672
[SPEAKER_09]: Woohoo!

01:43:48.152 --> 01:43:49.192
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:14.501
[SPEAKER_09]: Floatation by Vincent D'Amore.

01:44:14.521 --> 01:44:16.363
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one of my favorite 2DX songs they ever did.

01:44:16.703 --> 01:44:17.664
[SPEAKER_09]: That is going to be in this game.

01:44:17.964 --> 01:44:18.945
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of cool.

01:44:19.085 --> 01:44:21.466
[SPEAKER_09]: Stringer by Riva.

01:44:21.807 --> 01:44:23.107
[SPEAKER_09]: Push is in the game.

01:44:23.688 --> 01:44:28.791
[SPEAKER_09]: There's just lots and lots of those trancy bands that you probably hear on his podcast all in this game.

01:44:28.871 --> 01:44:31.213
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, it looks pretty cool.

01:44:31.253 --> 01:44:34.616
[SPEAKER_09]: It's too bad that the game might only come out in Europe, but I guess since we have some...

01:44:35.496 --> 01:44:43.844
[SPEAKER_09]: Listeners over there, I guess you get something we don't, so I don't want to hear all that bitching about that we get all the games, because I don't know if we'll ever get that one.

01:44:44.165 --> 01:44:44.625
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see though.

01:44:46.066 --> 01:44:47.288
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, DarkSakura.

01:44:49.410 --> 01:44:56.537
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yes, this is actually, and I'm debating with myself because I want them, but I'm probably not going to get them.

01:44:57.133 --> 01:45:06.661
[SPEAKER_15]: They are, um, they made little, um, River City Ransom characters, or as the original was, the hot-blooded downtown story.

01:45:07.241 --> 01:45:08.242
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're so cute!

01:45:08.622 --> 01:45:13.206
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, they actually were shown at the Treasure Festa show going on in Japan.

01:45:13.847 --> 01:45:23.475
[SPEAKER_15]: Little, um, custom kits that are, um, they have, like, the two main guys and then some of the other guys that you can beat up to.

01:45:24.495 --> 01:45:24.896
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um,

01:45:25.496 --> 01:45:26.397
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just so cute.

01:45:26.698 --> 01:45:28.419
[SPEAKER_15]: It's put up by Tomopop.

01:45:30.642 --> 01:45:31.342
[SPEAKER_15]: They're adorable.

01:45:32.524 --> 01:45:35.667
[SPEAKER_15]: And no, it's not River City Ransom technically.

01:45:35.687 --> 01:45:41.673
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I said, it's a hot-blooded downtown story, but it's got all kinds of cute little guys and it's adorable.

01:45:43.675 --> 01:45:44.055
[SPEAKER_15]: I want.

01:45:45.917 --> 01:45:46.498
[SPEAKER_09]: They look cute.

01:45:49.553 --> 01:45:55.299
[SPEAKER_07]: Team Fortress 2 The Engineer is finally getting its update thanks to a teaser trailer that was released.

01:45:56.460 --> 01:46:03.288
[SPEAKER_07]: No word exactly on what upgrades he's going to be getting, but there's a lot of stuff that if you read between the lines...

01:46:05.530 --> 01:46:10.493
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the stuff that you see in the background in the video that perhaps is going to be being added.

01:46:10.993 --> 01:46:17.177
[SPEAKER_07]: Including, they have some sort of Iron Man type of helmet thing on the workbench.

01:46:17.517 --> 01:46:20.199
[SPEAKER_07]: Some sort of robotic arm in a blueprint.

01:46:21.179 --> 01:46:29.044
[SPEAKER_07]: So, no word exactly on when the update is coming, but it is kind of neat that they keep adding updates to this game.

01:46:32.597 --> 01:46:34.765
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that game's like three years old at this point, isn't it?

01:46:34.966 --> 01:46:36.311
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's extremely old.

01:46:38.166 --> 01:46:38.446
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:46:38.806 --> 01:46:46.010
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, a game that's rather new but about something, oh, very old-fashioned for all of us is a game called Babymaker Extreme.

01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:48.851
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, there is a trailer out for Babymaker Extreme.

01:46:48.871 --> 01:46:51.892
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess the game is actually out on Xbox Live Marketplace right now.

01:46:51.912 --> 01:46:52.693
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:46:53.013 --> 01:46:53.633
[SPEAKER_09]: Community games.

01:46:53.933 --> 01:46:54.653
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry.

01:46:54.673 --> 01:46:55.214
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's what I meant.

01:46:55.234 --> 01:46:55.894
[SPEAKER_07]: Community games.

01:46:56.054 --> 01:46:56.754
[SPEAKER_07]: Indie games, whatever.

01:46:57.375 --> 01:46:58.935
[SPEAKER_09]: 80 Microsoft points for this game.

01:46:59.776 --> 01:47:04.418
[SPEAKER_09]: And let me just kind of play the trailer for you guys and describe what's going on in Babymaker Extreme.

01:47:04.498 --> 01:47:05.758
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's not just sex.

01:47:06.059 --> 01:47:06.399
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay?

01:47:06.419 --> 01:47:06.759
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

01:47:07.099 --> 01:47:09.301
[SPEAKER_09]: But it is about the joy of giving birth.

01:47:09.361 --> 01:47:12.283
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, you push A to experience the miracle of childbirth.

01:47:13.785 --> 01:47:17.187
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, you control your breathing in this game just like a real mother.

01:47:17.628 --> 01:47:20.450
[SPEAKER_09]: And you use the L-T-R-T to breathe as you go back and forth.

01:47:20.490 --> 01:47:21.851
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's like to build out the power.

01:47:22.392 --> 01:47:23.893
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you get ready to push.

01:47:25.294 --> 01:47:28.377
[SPEAKER_09]: And you hit B as fast as you can to get ready to push.

01:47:28.777 --> 01:47:30.318
[SPEAKER_09]: You just keep slamming on that B button.

01:47:32.140 --> 01:47:33.341
[SPEAKER_09]: And then what's next?

01:47:34.912 --> 01:47:55.374
[SPEAKER_07]: probably screaming for drugs and then a c-section no no it gets better well they don't show you what happens next but I believe featuring avatars I believe you push the a button and the baby goes flying through the air no featuring avatars but have you seen did you watch the whole trailer that's right you have your avatars get born out of this woman

01:47:57.788 --> 01:48:00.870
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can give them scuba gear and shoes and a vest.

01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:02.431
[SPEAKER_09]: And they go shooting.

01:48:02.471 --> 01:48:04.852
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like one of those rocket-like launching games, right?

01:48:04.872 --> 01:48:05.692
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Baby Launcher?

01:48:05.712 --> 01:48:07.373
[SPEAKER_09]: The baby goes flying through the air, right?

01:48:07.994 --> 01:48:08.754
[SPEAKER_16]: Kick the baby!

01:48:08.854 --> 01:48:09.374
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing.

01:48:09.474 --> 01:48:10.295
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't kick the baby.

01:48:11.095 --> 01:48:12.396
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, that sounds like it's worth a buck.

01:48:13.016 --> 01:48:14.157
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, one whole dollar.

01:48:14.477 --> 01:48:15.338
[SPEAKER_15]: That's just awful.

01:48:16.998 --> 01:48:17.939
[SPEAKER_09]: Awfully funny.

01:48:18.339 --> 01:48:19.760
[SPEAKER_09]: You should have my wife play it.

01:48:19.940 --> 01:48:20.340
[SPEAKER_09]: You should.

01:48:21.181 --> 01:48:22.341
[SPEAKER_09]: How far along is she now?

01:48:22.782 --> 01:48:24.302
[SPEAKER_09]: She is 25 weeks.

01:48:24.483 --> 01:48:27.104
[SPEAKER_09]: She should be kind of practicing for the big day.

01:48:27.799 --> 01:48:29.379
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, what's in the email bag this week?

01:48:29.419 --> 01:48:29.720
[SPEAKER_09]: Some crap.

01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:29.920
[SPEAKER_09]: Delete.

01:48:29.980 --> 01:48:31.800
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, that was system spam.

01:48:55.467 --> 01:49:00.633
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a few quickies through the website, so some of them are not letting us know who they are.

01:49:00.653 --> 01:49:01.995
[SPEAKER_15]: This one's from NerdE1.

01:49:04.317 --> 01:49:11.185
[SPEAKER_15]: Though Sky might appreciate checking out a web show called... Oh, he's asking about if you watch The Guild.

01:49:12.398 --> 01:49:13.239
[SPEAKER_09]: The Guild is cute Epic Ness

01:49:32.562 --> 01:49:36.163
[SPEAKER_15]: I wonder if our covers of old NES tunes might be interesting for your radio station.

01:49:36.644 --> 01:49:39.865
[SPEAKER_15]: We remake the music from old games and make them into rock medleys.

01:49:40.505 --> 01:49:42.706
[SPEAKER_15]: We have gotten quite good feedback so far.

01:49:42.786 --> 01:49:45.147
[SPEAKER_15]: Please visit our MySpace and tell me what you think about it.

01:49:45.247 --> 01:49:46.067
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll go ahead and plug it.

01:49:46.307 --> 01:49:47.007
[SPEAKER_07]: MySpace?

01:49:47.407 --> 01:49:47.807
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

01:49:47.827 --> 01:49:48.628
[SPEAKER_15]: Who uses MySpace?

01:49:48.688 --> 01:49:51.149
[SPEAKER_15]: First off... Epicness Band.

01:49:51.529 --> 01:49:51.869
[SPEAKER_15]: NES.

01:49:52.782 --> 01:49:53.503
[SPEAKER_09]: And this last one is Shook

01:50:11.485 --> 01:50:13.226
[SPEAKER_15]: By the way, very excellent grammar.

01:50:40.385 --> 01:50:40.725
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

01:50:40.885 --> 01:50:42.146
[SPEAKER_15]: Except for a few missing comments.

01:50:42.246 --> 01:50:48.507
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this year, the only difference between last year and this year would be that this year, we don't really know what's coming.

01:50:49.268 --> 01:51:04.092
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we have an idea with some of the stuff that they've talked about already, but I think that this year, they're keeping a lot of it kind of tight to the chest so that there's going to be a lot more surprises, whereas last year, it's kind of like, yeah, we kind of know what you're going to talk about, and there's some things, but I don't know.

01:51:04.232 --> 01:51:08.553
[SPEAKER_07]: Personally, I'm okay with not going to E3 this year because last year, it was just kind of, eh.

01:51:09.073 --> 01:51:10.337
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't what it used to be.

01:51:10.938 --> 01:51:11.540
[SPEAKER_09]: I disagree.

01:51:12.162 --> 01:51:14.347
[SPEAKER_09]: I think our emailer couldn't be more wronger.

01:51:15.905 --> 01:51:40.360
[SPEAKER_09]: To use a term that DarkSakura will appreciate I think that between actually getting to do some hands-on with Natal To see what it's really like Besides just a concept Getting to get hands-on with Move Final Fantasy XIV, Rock Band 3, Portal 2 I think there's a lot of big releases this year That are kind of exciting Whereas last year there wasn't I mean, one of the bigger things there was Halo 3 ODST Which wasn't a game I was really that excited about

01:51:41.060 --> 01:51:46.664
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, one thing I haven't played is the Halo Reach beta, really, at all, which I guess came out this week.

01:51:47.884 --> 01:51:52.187
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of don't play Halo anymore, thanks to Halo 3 wasn't that great.

01:51:52.407 --> 01:51:54.148
[SPEAKER_09]: So, all right.

01:51:56.029 --> 01:51:57.770
[SPEAKER_09]: So, oh, thank you for that, DarkSakura.

01:51:57.790 --> 01:51:58.370
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate that.

01:51:58.430 --> 01:52:00.772
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura's taking my picture over here while I'm trying to talk.

01:52:00.792 --> 01:52:03.413
[SPEAKER_15]: I was poking your head with a .50 caliber bullet shell.

01:52:03.974 --> 01:52:04.714
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice, thank you.

01:52:05.254 --> 01:52:09.377
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was going to say, by the way, our youngest documented listener that I know of has actually just turned three.

01:52:09.657 --> 01:52:09.817
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

01:52:10.837 --> 01:52:11.917
[SPEAKER_15]: He doesn't really pay attention to us.

01:52:11.937 --> 01:52:12.758
[SPEAKER_15]: He just listens sometimes.

01:52:13.018 --> 01:52:18.239
[SPEAKER_09]: BlackWolf in our chatroom wants to point out it's also still a month away and E3 booth lists come out about a week or two before.

01:52:18.899 --> 01:52:19.259
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

01:52:19.319 --> 01:52:20.540
[SPEAKER_09]: Blizzard could be back this year.

01:52:20.620 --> 01:52:21.280
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't know yet.

01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:23.180
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, Nintendo's got the 3DS.

01:52:23.781 --> 01:52:28.742
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a little antsy about the 3DS because I don't know about how 3D's going to go.

01:52:28.882 --> 01:52:31.182
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, I'm not going to knock it until I've tried it.

01:52:31.483 --> 01:52:32.403
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just a little nervous.

01:52:32.443 --> 01:52:32.803
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all.

01:52:34.449 --> 01:52:35.990
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so was that it for the emails?

01:52:36.990 --> 01:52:37.450
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, no.

01:52:37.810 --> 01:52:38.451
[SPEAKER_09]: No, alright.

01:52:39.091 --> 01:52:41.212
[SPEAKER_15]: But I did put that picture up on the website.

01:52:41.872 --> 01:52:42.892
[SPEAKER_09]: Grand, thank you.

01:52:44.653 --> 01:52:46.194
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, it's from Rababababa.

01:52:47.234 --> 01:52:51.216
[SPEAKER_15]: I love the way game politics presents the story of Dave and Buster's new owners.

01:52:51.916 --> 01:52:52.476
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a link there.

01:52:54.457 --> 01:52:54.897
[SPEAKER_09]: P.S.

01:52:55.177 --> 01:52:57.238
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them opened up in Roseville this week.

01:52:57.498 --> 01:52:57.758
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

01:52:57.938 --> 01:53:00.779
[SPEAKER_09]: I drove by and I did not see it, but then I didn't drive that close.

01:53:00.799 --> 01:53:02.180
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in the fountains.

01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:03.100
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew it was over there.

01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:05.541
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in the fountains over by... I know what we're talking about.

01:53:05.621 --> 01:53:06.501
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's in the back.

01:53:06.621 --> 01:53:08.562
[SPEAKER_09]: It's by California Peach Kitchen and all that stuff in the back.

01:53:08.802 --> 01:53:14.824
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking too, because we were over at the Galleria this week, and I was like, I wonder if it's over there, and I'm like, the fountains, where's this?

01:53:14.844 --> 01:53:16.984
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's how long it's been since I've been over there.

01:53:17.184 --> 01:53:19.445
[SPEAKER_07]: The fountains didn't exist when I went last.

01:53:19.565 --> 01:53:20.065
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nice.

01:53:20.145 --> 01:53:22.206
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little bit too high class for me, but...

01:53:22.426 --> 01:53:23.226
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some nice stuff there.

01:53:23.427 --> 01:53:25.027
[SPEAKER_09]: But did you go to Dave & Buster's, though?

01:53:25.147 --> 01:53:25.548
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not yet.

01:53:25.868 --> 01:53:26.668
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we'll have to plan that this week.

01:53:26.688 --> 01:53:27.228
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we'll have to go there.

01:53:27.268 --> 01:53:29.069
[SPEAKER_09]: We should plan an OLR night at Dave & Buster's.

01:53:29.109 --> 01:53:29.870
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we need to go there.

01:53:29.970 --> 01:53:30.350
[SPEAKER_09]: Fun!

01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:31.090
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

01:53:31.251 --> 01:53:31.611
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

01:53:34.772 --> 01:53:43.857
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so in the middle of the GP article, it says, In a press release on its site, Oak Hill called the deal an investment in partnership with Dave & Buster's current management team.

01:53:44.217 --> 01:53:44.497
[SPEAKER_15]: Joke.

01:53:45.138 --> 01:53:47.979
[SPEAKER_15]: They soon followed with an email, By the way, you're defired.

01:53:48.219 --> 01:53:48.699
[SPEAKER_15]: All in leet.

01:53:48.980 --> 01:53:49.280
[SPEAKER_15]: End joke.

01:53:50.140 --> 01:53:56.574
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe this marks the beginning of a round of closing of some DMV sites because that's what the new company always does, isn't it?

01:53:57.075 --> 01:53:58.598
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an Arcadiapocalypse.

01:53:58.778 --> 01:54:00.261
[SPEAKER_15]: The Arcadiapocalypse is nigh.

01:54:01.063 --> 01:54:01.444
[SPEAKER_15]: Rababa.

01:54:02.239 --> 01:54:07.022
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of funny because they just opened the one here and now they're already talking about closing certain Dave and Busters.

01:54:07.362 --> 01:54:10.384
[SPEAKER_15]: I like that he signs his name now, Ra-ba-ba.

01:54:11.424 --> 01:54:12.085
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how you say it.

01:54:12.185 --> 01:54:13.165
[SPEAKER_07]: It is, if you think about it.

01:54:13.225 --> 01:54:21.090
[SPEAKER_07]: It's surprising, though, that it is in such close proximity to the Family Fun Center, you know, Golf Land.

01:54:22.030 --> 01:54:24.812
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully it makes them... And John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza is right around the corner.

01:54:25.152 --> 01:54:27.473
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, their arcade's kind of crap.

01:54:28.134 --> 01:54:30.355
[SPEAKER_14]: But I would say... They do have an Afterburner Climax.

01:54:31.337 --> 01:54:33.819
[SPEAKER_07]: Good for them, but I'm just saying... And an indoor rollercoaster.

01:54:35.980 --> 01:54:36.260
[SPEAKER_07]: They do?

01:54:36.700 --> 01:54:37.061
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

01:54:37.081 --> 01:54:38.642
[SPEAKER_07]: It's for, like, little kids, but yeah.

01:54:39.182 --> 01:54:40.023
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't really count.

01:54:41.884 --> 01:54:46.967
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's interesting to see, because, you know, Dave Busters has a pretty decent arcade.

01:54:47.287 --> 01:54:48.548
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, there's a lot of ticket games.

01:54:48.928 --> 01:54:54.772
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad, though, I'll be able to use my two power cards that I have from, like, five years ago, which is very exciting.

01:54:57.298 --> 01:54:58.578
[SPEAKER_07]: Those things don't expire, do they?

01:54:59.198 --> 01:55:01.539
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think so, but you might have to get it transferred.

01:55:02.159 --> 01:55:03.220
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:07.641
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, DarkSakura's taking pictures over here and she keeps pointing the camera at me and I don't know why.

01:55:08.801 --> 01:55:10.081
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I know you'll play along.

01:55:10.341 --> 01:55:10.621
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

01:55:12.582 --> 01:55:14.002
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm campier than Loki.

01:55:14.903 --> 01:55:17.723
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm putting up a picture of me poking Rob with the nose condom.

01:55:17.863 --> 01:55:18.223
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

01:55:19.204 --> 01:55:20.184
[SPEAKER_15]: The nose tampon, sorry.

01:55:20.744 --> 01:55:44.105
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Beavis and Butthead I understand Mr. McVicar has made a little arrangement with you guys Yeah, a little probation You see, class, Beavis and Butthead here are not allowed to laugh for a whole week

01:55:45.034 --> 01:55:54.182
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, and if they do laugh, they'll be expelled and they'll have to go to Hope High School where they'll get their asses kicked on a daily basis by all the other delinquents.

01:55:56.524 --> 01:56:01.148
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was real glad to hear that because this is Sex Education Week.

01:56:01.808 --> 01:56:03.690
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, Sex Ed Week.

01:56:04.892 --> 01:56:06.673
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be talking about the penis.

01:56:07.754 --> 01:56:09.796
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be talking about the vagina.

01:56:10.416 --> 01:56:12.218
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that's funny, butthead?

01:56:12.518 --> 01:56:15.921
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you find it amusing that we'll be talking about the testicles?

01:56:16.961 --> 01:56:28.711
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we're also going to be talking about venereal disease, sexual intercourse, and we will definitely be spending a lot of time talking about masturbation.

01:56:33.707 --> 01:56:36.091
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now that that's out of the way, let's take roll.

01:56:36.892 --> 01:56:37.653
[SPEAKER_01]: Butt kiss!

01:56:37.934 --> 01:56:38.314
[SPEAKER_01]: Here.

01:56:40.017 --> 01:56:40.678
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaylord!

01:56:41.599 --> 01:56:41.940
[SPEAKER_01]: Iron!

01:56:46.667 --> 01:56:47.368
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we're so mature.

01:56:49.194 --> 01:57:02.203
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to realize, especially after getting that email from the 13-year-old that listens to the show, a lot of you didn't grow up with Beavis and Butthead, and that kind of makes me sad for you, because Beavis and Butthead was pretty fucking amazing.

01:57:02.303 --> 01:57:03.144
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, it really was.

01:57:05.285 --> 01:57:06.865
[SPEAKER_15]: It really summed up a generation.

01:57:06.945 --> 01:57:07.726
[SPEAKER_09]: It really did.

01:57:07.806 --> 01:57:13.187
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, if you want to know what life was like for us, just go watch an old episode of Beavis and Butthead.

01:57:13.227 --> 01:57:14.327
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty summed up.

01:57:14.367 --> 01:57:18.048
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, back when MTV would actually play music videos and everything else.

01:57:18.668 --> 01:57:19.168
[SPEAKER_09]: Good stuff.

01:57:20.449 --> 01:57:26.090
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's get into a little bit of angst, because, you know, sometimes we get a little angry here on Orange Lounge Radio, and we have to do this segment.

01:57:26.130 --> 01:57:27.270
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just tradition for 366 weeks now.

01:57:27.290 --> 01:57:28.191
[SPEAKER_09]: The F-Years of the Week!

01:57:45.258 --> 01:57:53.216
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, F you to the sudden fifth coughing that I have and also for my finger for starting to trigger again even though I had it operated on last year.

01:57:56.449 --> 01:58:02.613
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to people that drift in and out of lanes, especially people that try to hit me with their car.

01:58:03.073 --> 01:58:10.918
[SPEAKER_07]: Also those people that like to make left turns by kind of slightly going to the right portion of their lane or outside of their lane and then making left turn.

01:58:11.359 --> 01:58:13.620
[SPEAKER_07]: Same goes for people that make the right turns that way as well.

01:58:14.220 --> 01:58:17.883
[SPEAKER_07]: And to this old grandma that we saw today who decided that, you know, the...

01:58:19.150 --> 01:58:19.290
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey!

01:58:19.330 --> 01:58:19.570
[SPEAKER_07]: Oops.

01:58:19.970 --> 01:58:20.631
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that it?

01:58:20.711 --> 01:58:21.271
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

01:58:21.351 --> 01:58:21.711
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

01:58:40.057 --> 01:58:43.059
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to say a quick F you to my teeth.

01:58:43.619 --> 01:58:46.340
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I went to a Mamma Mia sing-along this week.

01:58:46.841 --> 01:58:48.281
[SPEAKER_09]: And don't judge me.

01:58:49.102 --> 01:58:49.882
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a lot of fun.

01:58:50.122 --> 01:58:50.442
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up.

01:58:50.662 --> 01:58:51.063
[SPEAKER_09]: It was great.

01:58:51.143 --> 01:58:52.483
[SPEAKER_09]: They did it all Rocky Horror Picture Show style.

01:58:52.723 --> 01:58:54.944
[SPEAKER_09]: But one of the things they did is that one of the songs is Honey Honey.

01:58:55.265 --> 01:58:58.186
[SPEAKER_09]: And they actually had Biddle Honey available as part of Honey Honey.

01:58:58.726 --> 01:58:58.846
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

01:59:01.954 --> 01:59:07.138
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually ate the bit of honey during Honey Honey and part of my tooth chipped off on the bit of honey.

01:59:07.619 --> 01:59:08.359
[SPEAKER_09]: One of my back teeth.

01:59:08.759 --> 01:59:14.964
[SPEAKER_09]: But I had like tons of cavities when I was a kid and I think like a lot of the fillings now that I'm like 30 are cracking out.

01:59:15.485 --> 01:59:16.906
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's exactly what happened.

01:59:16.926 --> 01:59:19.228
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the filling broke off and took the corner of my tooth with it.

01:59:19.728 --> 01:59:24.852
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm really hoping it doesn't start to hurt because something else about me, I really hate going to the dentist.

01:59:24.892 --> 01:59:28.014
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I really, really hate going to the dentist.

01:59:28.034 --> 01:59:30.096
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what will help though if it does start to hurt wrong?

01:59:30.136 --> 01:59:31.057
[SPEAKER_15]: Just a natural remedy.

01:59:32.037 --> 01:59:32.458
[SPEAKER_15]: Chin!

01:59:33.418 --> 01:59:37.320
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm just, you know, I can't, like, if it starts to hurt, I'm gonna have to do something about it.

01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:39.881
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't let it go, because it will never, like, stop hurting.

01:59:40.522 --> 01:59:41.802
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, yeah.

01:59:42.343 --> 01:59:42.963
[SPEAKER_09]: A few to my teeth.

01:59:45.702 --> 01:59:47.504
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to fillings we got as kids too.

01:59:48.285 --> 01:59:49.526
[SPEAKER_15]: I never had a filling as a kid.

01:59:49.766 --> 01:59:53.790
[SPEAKER_15]: Then again, I didn't go to the dentist until I was an adult from the time I was in third grade.

01:59:53.970 --> 01:59:54.291
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

01:59:55.612 --> 01:59:56.053
[SPEAKER_09]: Lucky you.

01:59:57.334 --> 01:59:58.835
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, that's it for the FUs of the week.

01:59:58.876 --> 02:00:03.200
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get into some other stories and then we'll get into the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR

02:00:05.262 --> 02:00:12.989
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a new Bomani game that apparently came out back in February in Japan, of course, because I'm not over here.

02:00:13.690 --> 02:00:26.682
[SPEAKER_07]: And unfortunately, I didn't really know much about it, but it's a new game called Utachi, and it looks like poppin' music, but kind of like almost like a light version of poppin' music with only three buttons, because you play it in kind of like the book...

02:00:27.122 --> 02:00:29.044
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:00:50.280 --> 02:01:13.378
[SPEAKER_07]: and tap and tap and quickly slide for yellow the green notes sound a bit tricky you have to tap once and hit it's tap once it hits the bottom and then slide the stylus up and down until the note ends so it's like a new rhythm is a game and the characters definitely look like they're from poppin music it's no beat and groovy though

02:01:16.676 --> 02:01:20.202
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it looks like it'll be better than beaten groovy, but I don't know.

02:01:21.565 --> 02:01:23.709
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just not excited about these games anymore.

02:01:23.729 --> 02:01:25.372
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I agree.

02:01:26.937 --> 02:01:27.798
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's sad though?

02:01:28.418 --> 02:01:38.964
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I showed you there was like a homebrew DS game that really kind of gave me an idea of how they could do like a DDR type of game on the DS and it was pretty awesome.

02:01:39.024 --> 02:01:51.831
[SPEAKER_07]: It involved like kind of making gestures with the stylus and just really cool the way it kind of worked but it was with like a par-a-par type of video or something that they did it with.

02:01:52.492 --> 02:01:54.553
[SPEAKER_07]: Still would be really cool though to implement.

02:01:57.054 --> 02:02:03.500
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, one more story for you guys tonight, and I don't think this guy will be making a Parapara game, but you never know.

02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:07.123
[SPEAKER_09]: George Romero, you guys know who he is, right?

02:02:07.183 --> 02:02:12.627
[SPEAKER_09]: He did zombie movies, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, you know, all these awesome zombie movies.

02:02:13.608 --> 02:02:17.392
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, George Romero recently talked to the website Destructoid and said...

02:02:18.052 --> 02:02:19.033
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to do a game.

02:02:19.473 --> 02:02:21.034
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to work with a gamer on it.

02:02:21.474 --> 02:02:25.656
[SPEAKER_09]: But everyone who has ever approached me, it's always been, sell us your name and go home.

02:02:25.856 --> 02:02:27.577
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't particularly want to do that.

02:02:28.317 --> 02:02:32.439
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, and then, of course, there's the whole Dead Rising thing, which was definitely influenced.

02:02:32.459 --> 02:02:34.540
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think one of the companies he said he wanted to work with was Capcom.

02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:35.961
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, they already did it.

02:02:36.361 --> 02:02:36.621
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

02:02:37.642 --> 02:02:41.523
[SPEAKER_09]: So he actually said, he admitted, I'm not a gamer, so I don't know what excites a gamer.

02:02:41.644 --> 02:02:42.024
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

02:02:42.284 --> 02:02:43.885
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I could come up with a good story.

02:02:44.405 --> 02:02:44.885
[SPEAKER_09]: Zombies.

02:02:44.965 --> 02:02:45.946
[SPEAKER_09]: People like zombies.

02:02:46.046 --> 02:02:46.526
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

02:02:48.490 --> 02:02:57.036
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure you're not very familiar with the zombie phenomenon, but I'm sure if you do your research there, George Romero, that you'll be fine.

02:02:57.176 --> 02:03:00.478
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as he makes the right arrangement with the right game company, it'll be fine.

02:03:00.538 --> 02:03:05.662
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as he doesn't partner up with the wrong game company, it'll be great.

02:03:06.673 --> 02:03:09.676
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so that's it for our scripted stories tonight.

02:03:09.736 --> 02:03:15.042
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to the phones at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:03:15.342 --> 02:03:16.524
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to take your calls.

02:03:17.064 --> 02:03:19.487
[SPEAKER_09]: The last few weeks have been a little dry, so I don't know what's going on.

02:03:19.847 --> 02:03:21.489
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see if we actually get some phone calls tonight.

02:03:21.870 --> 02:03:25.453
[SPEAKER_09]: In the meantime, let's see if there's anyone that has last minute stories.

02:03:28.076 --> 02:03:28.156
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh...

02:03:30.549 --> 02:03:31.990
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the small stuff.

02:03:32.871 --> 02:03:36.494
[SPEAKER_07]: They're doing another Xbox 360 bundle instead of the elites with two free games.

02:03:36.514 --> 02:03:39.696
[SPEAKER_07]: They're also going to have an Xbox 360 arcade system with two free games.

02:03:40.277 --> 02:03:45.421
[SPEAKER_07]: Those free games, of course, are Banjo-Kazooie and Viva Pinata, the first Viva Pinata game.

02:03:45.901 --> 02:03:48.623
[SPEAKER_07]: But hey, two free games is better than none.

02:03:48.783 --> 02:03:49.904
[SPEAKER_09]: Free games are free, so.

02:03:50.264 --> 02:03:51.345
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's go to the phones.

02:03:51.385 --> 02:03:51.886
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a call.

02:03:51.926 --> 02:03:52.926
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:03:52.946 --> 02:03:53.307
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

02:03:54.668 --> 02:03:56.129
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the one and only Ranma.

02:03:56.169 --> 02:03:57.770
[SPEAKER_09]: How's everybody doing tonight?

02:03:57.890 --> 02:03:58.311
[SPEAKER_09]: Not bad.

02:03:58.351 --> 02:03:58.691
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

02:04:00.382 --> 02:04:04.747
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm pretty good, I just came back from a job interview, but that's not the reason why I called.

02:04:04.807 --> 02:04:06.328
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, good luck with that, hope it works out.

02:04:06.749 --> 02:04:07.890
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the reason you called tonight?

02:04:08.851 --> 02:04:18.921
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, before I get into it, to reiterate what was said in the chat room earlier, I'm surprised you wouldn't go around zombie killing to the theme of the Golden Girls extended remix.

02:04:20.783 --> 02:04:29.748
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, you know, I just, I have to think if Push came to shove, the thing is about the Golden Girls, there was really only that one song, and that's not enough to really fill up a whole CD.

02:04:30.168 --> 02:04:33.750
[SPEAKER_09]: But maybe if we could somehow get that song on the soundtrack to Lost Highway, then we'd be good.

02:04:35.071 --> 02:04:36.592
[SPEAKER_12]: Or maybe audio clips from the show?

02:04:38.613 --> 02:04:40.154
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I'd want to hear that.

02:04:41.334 --> 02:04:42.375
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that make sense?

02:04:42.655 --> 02:04:45.016
[SPEAKER_12]: You know we're just busting your balls because we love you, right?

02:04:45.156 --> 02:04:46.157
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I know, I know.

02:04:46.217 --> 02:04:47.197
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are weird.

02:04:47.538 --> 02:04:47.878
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, no.

02:04:50.678 --> 02:04:53.960
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually sat down and watched the Mega Man fan film Friday night Yeah, Friday night Uh-huh

02:05:20.087 --> 02:05:20.587
[SPEAKER_12]: I liked it.

02:05:20.707 --> 02:05:27.674
[SPEAKER_12]: I was expecting something really half-assed, rushed project, but it turned out to be much better than I thought it would be.

02:05:28.195 --> 02:05:31.678
[SPEAKER_09]: Without spoiling it too bad, what in a nutshell happens in this movie?

02:05:35.402 --> 02:05:38.065
[SPEAKER_12]: It's sort of like a retelling of the first game.

02:05:39.929 --> 02:05:41.210
[SPEAKER_12]: with Elements of the Third.

02:05:41.730 --> 02:05:48.093
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm surprised Capcom isn't trying to shut this shit down.

02:05:48.113 --> 02:05:51.675
[SPEAKER_12]: Did Capcom endorse this or are they just hoping?

02:06:04.551 --> 02:06:13.735
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually have no idea, but I don't think they would shut it down because I don't know if you remember a few years back at, I think it was DragonCon or some convention in the South.

02:06:14.355 --> 02:06:22.439
[SPEAKER_12]: Might have been SEC, I don't know, but reps from Capcom was there to watch a, I think it was a Devil May Cry fan film or something like that.

02:06:24.299 --> 02:06:25.721
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, so this has kind of been done before.

02:06:26.041 --> 02:06:28.804
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess the other movies talked about tonight, you know, Street Fighter movie.

02:06:29.084 --> 02:06:34.949
[SPEAKER_09]: Capcom is apparently just these grounds for, you know, making fan movies.

02:06:36.110 --> 02:06:36.951
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw Legacy.

02:06:36.991 --> 02:06:38.753
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought that was great, but I didn't see the other one, though.

02:06:41.195 --> 02:06:44.358
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess maybe I'll have to check out the movie too.

02:06:44.558 --> 02:06:44.838
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

02:06:44.858 --> 02:06:50.263
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not a big fan of that particular website that made it, but I guess I can try and just sit down and watch it.

02:06:50.283 --> 02:06:50.783
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't make it.

02:06:50.843 --> 02:06:51.644
[SPEAKER_09]: They're hosting it.

02:06:52.124 --> 02:06:52.404
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

02:06:52.424 --> 02:06:53.105
[SPEAKER_12]: They're hosting it.

02:06:53.185 --> 02:06:54.006
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, then that's different.

02:06:55.847 --> 02:06:58.950
[SPEAKER_12]: And their official soundtrack to the fan film is also available.

02:07:00.960 --> 02:07:05.763
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the soundtrack not clips from the game, or is it arranged stuff from the game, or is it all original stuff?

02:07:06.524 --> 02:07:07.404
[SPEAKER_12]: All original.

02:07:07.444 --> 02:07:11.107
[SPEAKER_12]: This one guy did original recordings for the whole movie.

02:07:11.967 --> 02:07:18.711
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a couple of tracks he did do remixes of, but it's like dark-themed.

02:07:18.851 --> 02:07:22.153
[SPEAKER_12]: It kind of reminded me of the music from Lord in the Rings, in a way.

02:07:22.514 --> 02:07:23.094
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

02:07:23.394 --> 02:07:23.975
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Enya?

02:07:23.995 --> 02:07:24.255
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

02:07:25.382 --> 02:07:26.003
[SPEAKER_12]: Something like that.

02:07:26.643 --> 02:07:29.846
[SPEAKER_12]: The fan film itself isn't like comedy chop socket.

02:07:29.886 --> 02:07:32.148
[SPEAKER_12]: It's more like drama.

02:07:32.388 --> 02:07:34.190
[SPEAKER_12]: It's more of a drama, darkish theme.

02:07:34.791 --> 02:07:40.776
[SPEAKER_12]: Plus the fact that the science, Wily and Light are much younger than they're supposed to be.

02:07:41.989 --> 02:07:45.111
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw in chat says Capcom did endorse the Street Fighter legacy.

02:07:45.351 --> 02:07:51.274
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat.OrangeLampTrader.com Capcom's pretty good with their fan base, though.

02:07:51.554 --> 02:07:53.515
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got a blog that reaches out to fans.

02:07:53.656 --> 02:07:55.657
[SPEAKER_09]: They try not to be jerks about stuff.

02:07:57.409 --> 02:08:01.730
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know, at the same time, when Nintendo pulled that Zelda film, I didn't really think they were being jerks.

02:08:01.810 --> 02:08:06.552
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they have a right to protect their IP, so if Capcom wanted to be jerks, they have a right.

02:08:07.632 --> 02:08:08.413
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

02:08:08.513 --> 02:08:15.675
[SPEAKER_12]: If Nintendo's going to pull that fan film, at least let us know about the supposed Metroid film that's supposed to be coming out.

02:08:15.695 --> 02:08:17.315
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been hearing about it for the last two, three years.

02:08:17.335 --> 02:08:18.036
[SPEAKER_09]: Good luck with that.

02:08:18.116 --> 02:08:19.016
[SPEAKER_09]: No, ain't happening.

02:08:19.396 --> 02:08:19.796
[SPEAKER_09]: Ain't happening.

02:08:19.816 --> 02:08:20.316
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know.

02:08:22.257 --> 02:08:25.178
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is too bad, because if it did happen, maybe they'd sell more copies of the game.

02:08:26.480 --> 02:08:26.880
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

02:08:27.841 --> 02:08:28.101
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

02:08:28.161 --> 02:08:31.402
[SPEAKER_09]: And SJ1 and Matt wants to point out that the Megas did the closing music.

02:08:31.662 --> 02:08:34.684
[SPEAKER_09]: So there is at least still some other Mega Man community tie-ins.

02:08:35.184 --> 02:08:36.084
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

02:08:36.184 --> 02:08:36.705
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely.

02:08:36.845 --> 02:08:37.065
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

02:08:37.085 --> 02:08:38.065
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Ranma, we got to let you go.

02:08:38.085 --> 02:08:39.906
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any other final thoughts before we let you go?

02:08:41.307 --> 02:08:43.568
[SPEAKER_09]: If you like Street Fighter stuff, check out Street Fighter High.

02:08:43.668 --> 02:08:44.468
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I got to say.

02:08:45.048 --> 02:08:45.349
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

02:08:45.389 --> 02:08:45.649
[SPEAKER_09]: Will do.

02:08:45.669 --> 02:08:47.049
[SPEAKER_15]: Dan was watching that the other day.

02:08:47.189 --> 02:08:48.210
[SPEAKER_15]: It's amusing.

02:08:49.090 --> 02:08:49.631
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it is.

02:08:50.031 --> 02:08:50.251
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

02:08:50.291 --> 02:08:51.091
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see you soon, Ranma.

02:08:51.111 --> 02:08:52.592
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you still coming out here like in July?

02:08:53.810 --> 02:08:56.611
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, we gotta talk about that, yeah.

02:08:56.631 --> 02:08:58.332
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, sounds good.

02:08:58.352 --> 02:08:59.233
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, all right, take care.

02:09:00.073 --> 02:09:00.513
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll chat.

02:09:00.533 --> 02:09:06.676
[SPEAKER_09]: 877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:09:07.296 --> 02:09:09.798
[SPEAKER_09]: While we wait for other calls, do we have any other last-minute stories that came up?

02:09:11.218 --> 02:09:12.539
[SPEAKER_13]: Not particularly, I don't think.

02:09:13.019 --> 02:09:14.440
[SPEAKER_09]: But Joel, too, come in the WiiWare.

02:09:15.220 --> 02:09:16.401
[SPEAKER_09]: Woo!

02:09:16.561 --> 02:09:17.221
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay for that.

02:09:17.241 --> 02:09:18.081
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we got another call.

02:09:18.121 --> 02:09:19.082
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:09:19.102 --> 02:09:19.422
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

02:09:21.498 --> 02:09:22.719
[SPEAKER_10]: One and only Legend of Zaku.

02:09:23.179 --> 02:09:24.259
[SPEAKER_09]: Legend of Zaku.

02:09:24.359 --> 02:09:24.679
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up?

02:09:24.719 --> 02:09:25.200
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind?

02:09:26.420 --> 02:09:26.960
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing much.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.781
[SPEAKER_10]: Just recovering from Mother's Day gorging of food.

02:09:30.281 --> 02:09:30.561
[SPEAKER_10]: I see.

02:09:30.602 --> 02:09:35.083
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, at least it's not a Mother's Day hangover because I've definitely had those types of Mother's Days too.

02:09:35.963 --> 02:09:38.504
[SPEAKER_09]: So what's on your mind?

02:09:38.524 --> 02:09:39.985
[SPEAKER_09]: To what do we owe this phone call?

02:09:41.989 --> 02:09:51.074
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess the way I've been seeing it right now, is it just me or is Activision trying to defend just in general ass rape?

02:09:51.614 --> 02:10:07.502
[SPEAKER_10]: In other words, when they try to sell the stimulus pack for Modern Warfare 2, their exec has the gall to say it's the best deal, it's the best value for the amount you're paying, which we all know, and let's be honest here, it's a crock of shit.

02:10:08.749 --> 02:10:09.189
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

02:10:31.728 --> 02:10:37.770
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, I think they definitely have some damage control to be doing, so of course you're going to see comments like that.

02:10:37.790 --> 02:10:46.252
[SPEAKER_10]: The problem with, you know, the way I see it is that you know, they have to they can't just do what they did to Infinity Ward with Bungie.

02:10:47.452 --> 02:10:48.913
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold, hold, hold, I'm going to stop you right there.

02:10:49.733 --> 02:10:50.853
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't own Bungie.

02:10:50.913 --> 02:10:52.034
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a big difference.

02:10:52.594 --> 02:10:57.615
[SPEAKER_10]: You'd be surprised at how, you know, the actual details of the deal itself.

02:10:58.796 --> 02:10:59.936
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you know, the

02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:19.009
[SPEAKER_10]: you know the details that are pretty much confidential I mean in other words what I'm trying to say is that the point is that perhaps Activision is going to be inclined to pull their strings as much as possible not to actually own them but to make their life that miserable

02:11:20.071 --> 02:11:25.877
[SPEAKER_10]: in terms of just like being demanding and overworking them if they were signed up for that type of deal.

02:11:26.697 --> 02:11:32.403
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a feeling this agreement is probably going to favor Bungie a little more because Activision is not directly paying for it.

02:11:32.463 --> 02:11:41.131
[SPEAKER_10]: As long as they actually negotiated, as long as Bungie managed to negotiate that contract with terms that they would agree with.

02:11:41.900 --> 02:11:42.801
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty sure they were.

02:11:42.821 --> 02:11:49.285
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm just, you know, as I'm saying, I just want to be sure that we just have to keep in mind that as long as Bungie doesn't get screwed over by Activision in terms of like

02:12:08.948 --> 02:12:11.250
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember though, Zaku, Bungie has survived a divorce with Microsoft.

02:12:11.290 --> 02:12:11.990
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty big.

02:12:12.250 --> 02:12:15.393
[SPEAKER_10]: These guys have publicly stated that they're helping on just maximizing profits.

02:12:35.183 --> 02:12:42.545
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me take this kind of a different direction a little bit here because we could kind of talk about this without really knowing the details of it for a very long time.

02:12:42.965 --> 02:12:49.527
[SPEAKER_09]: But come E3, hold on, come E3, we're actually going to see what this game is and what the big mystery project is.

02:12:49.547 --> 02:12:52.368
[SPEAKER_09]: At least that's the assumption and God, I hope it is the case.

02:12:52.708 --> 02:12:54.648
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll actually get to see what this mystery game is.

02:12:54.708 --> 02:12:55.728
[SPEAKER_09]: The curtain will be revealed.

02:12:56.129 --> 02:13:01.670
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think people are going to remember all this once the game can speak for itself as opposed to being just an idea?

02:13:02.290 --> 02:13:02.550
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

02:13:02.810 --> 02:13:11.312
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter that Activision and Bungie are basically a 10-year deal.

02:13:12.012 --> 02:13:15.552
[SPEAKER_10]: The important thing is that the game will be the face of everything.

02:13:16.313 --> 02:13:26.014
[SPEAKER_10]: It will be the face and that will be the front, the things that your average Joe gamer will see when talking about that particular game.

02:13:26.114 --> 02:13:28.895
[SPEAKER_10]: He would see whatever character is tied to that game and nothing else.

02:13:29.702 --> 02:13:34.043
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet most people don't really follow this stuff either.

02:13:34.403 --> 02:13:39.245
[SPEAKER_09]: Like how many people go, oh, I've got to go see this movie because 20th Century Fox is doing it.

02:13:39.365 --> 02:13:43.526
[SPEAKER_09]: And like, you know, 20th Century Fox, I just love that little theme they play before all the movies.

02:13:43.686 --> 02:13:44.626
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

02:13:44.666 --> 02:13:48.467
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, most people don't really give a hoot at the end of the day.

02:13:49.608 --> 02:13:50.008
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

02:13:50.148 --> 02:13:54.669
[SPEAKER_10]: This is where the franchises sell themselves to the point where the people who made them

02:13:56.173 --> 02:13:56.733
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter.

02:13:56.793 --> 02:13:57.715
[SPEAKER_10]: It's irrelevant to them.

02:13:58.155 --> 02:13:59.917
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the same thing with Call of Duty right now.

02:14:00.157 --> 02:14:04.122
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't care that Treyarch or Infinity Ward made it.

02:14:04.202 --> 02:14:07.026
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just another Call of Duty game to appease Joe Gamer.

02:14:08.095 --> 02:14:08.975
[SPEAKER_09]: I should say this, though.

02:14:09.055 --> 02:14:16.256
[SPEAKER_09]: There are definitely people that will follow, if I'm going to continue this analogy, follow their favorite directors.

02:14:16.557 --> 02:14:18.597
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, oh, Kevin Smith has a new film out.

02:14:18.737 --> 02:14:20.177
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got to go see that.

02:14:20.197 --> 02:14:21.837
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are niches you have to realize.

02:14:22.358 --> 02:14:31.899
[SPEAKER_10]: You have one aspect of really devoted fan base for that one particular person, but then you have another one that's just so passive.

02:14:32.519 --> 02:14:35.780
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't really take that into account.

02:14:36.803 --> 02:14:39.625
[SPEAKER_10]: So to them, it's just another movie that they're seeing.

02:14:40.105 --> 02:14:46.249
[SPEAKER_10]: And in this case, it's just another first-person shooter that this average Joe gamer is playing.

02:14:47.410 --> 02:14:47.710
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

02:14:48.011 --> 02:14:49.992
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Zaku, we've got to wrap up so we can get some more calls.

02:14:50.052 --> 02:14:51.333
[SPEAKER_09]: But thank you so much for your call.

02:14:51.553 --> 02:14:56.076
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sure we'll check in with you again after E3 when the curtain is revealed.

02:14:57.017 --> 02:14:57.357
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

02:14:57.597 --> 02:14:57.837
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

02:14:58.177 --> 02:14:58.758
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care, Zaku.

02:14:59.716 --> 02:15:00.396
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, have a good one

02:15:21.644 --> 02:15:22.385
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a few things.

02:15:23.966 --> 02:15:32.133
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently Square Enix is trying to prohibit people from making pictures and videos of their games, I guess, before they come out or something.

02:15:32.273 --> 02:15:32.914
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really know.

02:15:32.934 --> 02:15:34.655
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't realize that was a big problem.

02:15:34.915 --> 02:15:39.899
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know they've been really kind of anal about people taking pictures and stuff during E3.

02:15:40.060 --> 02:15:41.201
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, they do that all the time.

02:15:41.601 --> 02:15:42.762
[SPEAKER_09]: The phone's ringing off the hook.

02:15:42.802 --> 02:15:43.623
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta get one of these calls.

02:15:43.663 --> 02:15:44.543
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:15:44.563 --> 02:15:44.864
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

02:15:45.484 --> 02:15:46.365
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, this is X-Link.

02:15:46.445 --> 02:15:47.305
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, X-Link.

02:15:47.325 --> 02:15:48.046
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind, buddy?

02:15:48.606 --> 02:16:00.855
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I was reading over some news and I was glad to see that Sega had detailed the DRM for Alpha Protocol and that I don't have to have an internet connection 24-7 in order to play it when I do play it.

02:16:00.935 --> 02:16:03.397
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's because it's Sega, not Ubisoft, but that's good.

02:16:04.110 --> 02:16:04.590
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God.

02:16:04.670 --> 02:16:07.012
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank somebody for being DRM-friendly about it.

02:16:07.513 --> 02:16:14.819
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the fact that after about two years after the game comes out that they're going to put a patch where there will be no other requirements.

02:16:15.599 --> 02:16:25.728
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's good to know that somebody is at least looking at the consumer and saying, we don't want to go down these same footsteps as some of these other companies have been.

02:16:25.848 --> 02:16:30.652
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to see that somebody is at least trying to appease the PC customer.

02:16:32.318 --> 02:16:32.938
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's good.

02:16:33.899 --> 02:16:41.162
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't usually think of Sega as a big PC publisher, but I guess they certainly have some of their stuff there, so that's pretty cool.

02:16:42.562 --> 02:16:45.603
[SPEAKER_00]: But even so, I'm glad somebody's taking the right steps towards it.

02:16:46.404 --> 02:16:47.764
[SPEAKER_09]: What else is on your mind this week, buddy?

02:16:49.385 --> 02:16:49.985
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing much.

02:16:50.465 --> 02:16:54.467
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working on my finals and stuff, and of course playing WoW just like you.

02:16:54.607 --> 02:16:55.527
[SPEAKER_00]: How is Warcraft going?

02:16:55.547 --> 02:16:57.488
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you been reading the Cataclysm spoilers at all?

02:16:58.422 --> 02:16:59.463
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I have not actually.

02:16:59.583 --> 02:17:01.284
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's kind of hard not to.

02:17:01.644 --> 02:17:02.304
[SPEAKER_00]: I take that back.

02:17:02.445 --> 02:17:11.550
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hard not to read anything with it, but at the same time too, I try not to read too much because I like the whole aspect of surprise and see what's going to happen.

02:17:12.011 --> 02:17:20.256
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like I was telling other people in the guild and stuff, I'm looking forward to seeing how these events actually unfold and how the event's going to play out.

02:17:20.836 --> 02:17:27.422
[SPEAKER_00]: and hopefully they might have some kind of timely worldly events where this all is going to come and unfold at one step at a time.

02:17:27.502 --> 02:17:28.984
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be kind of neat to see how it happens.

02:17:29.004 --> 02:17:33.768
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they did some fun events when Lich King came out so I'm sure they'll do some fun stuff here too.

02:17:33.848 --> 02:17:34.469
[SPEAKER_09]: So that'll be cool.

02:17:35.370 --> 02:17:35.590
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

02:17:36.791 --> 02:17:38.533
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh gosh, there's something else I was going to ask you.

02:17:38.613 --> 02:17:41.616
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you're trying to still do your Loremaster achievement, right?

02:17:41.756 --> 02:17:42.997
[SPEAKER_09]: You may not have a lot of time left.

02:17:43.017 --> 02:17:44.558
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got to get cracking on that.

02:17:44.578 --> 02:17:44.719
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.

02:17:45.526 --> 02:17:46.647
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yes, definitely.

02:17:46.767 --> 02:17:48.228
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will definitely be doing that.

02:17:48.448 --> 02:17:54.172
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like a lot of my schoolwork had come up, unfortunately, where it had stopped me and slowed down my process, which, of course, you guys can tell.

02:17:54.252 --> 02:17:57.834
[SPEAKER_00]: But then again, I started speeding up again as well.

02:17:57.954 --> 02:18:00.956
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you finally decided, hey, maybe I should actually go to the new content.

02:18:00.976 --> 02:18:02.197
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll level a lot faster.

02:18:02.217 --> 02:18:06.240
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when you hit 80, it makes the old content super easy because you can start running dungeons by yourself.

02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:08.001
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, precisely.

02:18:08.161 --> 02:18:08.782
[SPEAKER_00]: Precisely.

02:18:08.882 --> 02:18:12.244
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a few surprises in store this next coming week, too, for some of us.

02:18:12.404 --> 02:18:13.765
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will talk about that later.

02:18:15.746 --> 02:18:16.006
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:18:16.166 --> 02:18:18.907
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got a few interesting things, which was kind of cool.

02:18:19.628 --> 02:18:19.928
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

02:18:20.228 --> 02:18:22.088
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're going to let you go, buddy, so we can get some more calls.

02:18:22.229 --> 02:18:24.489
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'll see you in a while, I'm sure.

02:18:24.849 --> 02:18:25.070
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

02:18:25.770 --> 02:18:26.230
[SPEAKER_00]: Later.

02:18:26.550 --> 02:18:28.111
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye-bye.

02:18:28.131 --> 02:18:30.472
[SPEAKER_09]: 877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:18:30.512 --> 02:18:30.892
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not?

02:18:31.192 --> 02:18:36.374
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll do a couple more calls, maybe at least one more call, since we were really thin on calls the past couple weeks.

02:18:36.434 --> 02:18:38.395
[SPEAKER_09]: And it seems like our phone's been ringing tonight.

02:18:38.495 --> 02:18:39.495
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess folks have things to say.

02:18:39.835 --> 02:19:03.122
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is strange because this was not quite as busy of a news week as weeks past And I expect the next few shows leading up to mid-June are going to be a little bit of the same thing Because, you know, most companies are going to try and keep it in their pants until E3 But you'll have little tidbits here and there Just like, you know, you've got going with A Little Big Planet 2 and everything But let's get to another call Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:19:04.542 --> 02:19:06.663
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Actdeft Hey, Actdeft, what's on your mind?

02:19:08.263 --> 02:19:11.784
[SPEAKER_17]: Not much, I just wanna talk about the Humble Indie Bundle.

02:19:12.642 --> 02:19:13.142
[SPEAKER_09]: What is this?

02:19:13.463 --> 02:19:13.683
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

02:19:14.843 --> 02:19:17.145
[SPEAKER_17]: The Humble in the Bundle.

02:19:17.605 --> 02:19:19.006
[SPEAKER_09]: What is Humble in the Bundle?

02:19:21.187 --> 02:19:26.870
[SPEAKER_17]: It's actually a six-game pack you can download just by donating anything you want.

02:19:27.911 --> 02:19:29.412
[SPEAKER_17]: Any amount of cash.

02:19:29.452 --> 02:19:31.033
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't this come up on last week?

02:19:31.093 --> 02:19:32.454
[SPEAKER_09]: No, maybe I just read a story on it.

02:19:32.534 --> 02:19:34.275
[SPEAKER_09]: Or was it maybe a last-minute story last week?

02:19:34.295 --> 02:19:34.815
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember.

02:19:35.335 --> 02:19:36.696
[SPEAKER_09]: I now know what you're talking about.

02:19:36.816 --> 02:19:39.638
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the games that's in there is Deblob, one of them?

02:19:41.266 --> 02:19:43.707
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it's actually World of Goo.

02:19:44.347 --> 02:19:45.548
[SPEAKER_09]: World of Goo, that's it.

02:19:45.788 --> 02:19:47.269
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't get them confused.

02:19:47.289 --> 02:19:48.969
[SPEAKER_09]: They're both blobby slime games.

02:19:50.070 --> 02:19:50.830
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so there it is.

02:19:51.130 --> 02:19:53.331
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, yes, I did read about this, but go ahead.

02:19:55.072 --> 02:20:00.754
[SPEAKER_17]: It's World of Goo, Aquaria, Gish, Lugaroo, NHD, and Penumbra Overture.

02:20:00.934 --> 02:20:05.996
[SPEAKER_17]: And also they added a sixth game that is Samorost 2.

02:20:07.677 --> 02:20:10.438
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you actually pick this up and download it?

02:20:11.758 --> 02:20:12.758
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I actually did.

02:20:13.099 --> 02:20:14.499
[SPEAKER_09]: And what did you pay for it?

02:20:15.180 --> 02:20:18.761
[SPEAKER_17]: Even though Bobby may think I carried it, but no, I did pay for it.

02:20:19.141 --> 02:20:21.082
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you get to name your own price for this, right?

02:20:21.823 --> 02:20:28.206
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's the cool thing about it, that you can put your own price on it.

02:20:28.806 --> 02:20:37.490
[SPEAKER_17]: You can put just a cent, but if you don't got a... Well, sorry.

02:20:38.348 --> 02:20:39.749
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't want to look that cheap.

02:20:39.789 --> 02:20:49.154
[SPEAKER_17]: You can donate $1 or $6, $5, $10, or even there's a donation here on the site that says $1,000.

02:20:49.634 --> 02:20:58.399
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you have a lot of cash to spend or donate, you can donate whatever you want.

02:20:58.499 --> 02:20:59.119
[SPEAKER_09]: Very generous.

02:20:59.139 --> 02:21:00.760
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, Orange Lounge Radio would happily take $1,000.

02:21:00.800 --> 02:21:05.882
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I won't drill you on how much you actually pay, but I do want to know, were you able to pay in pesos?

02:21:05.902 --> 02:21:07.043
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you're from Mexico.

02:21:07.143 --> 02:21:10.785
[SPEAKER_09]: Or did you have to actually pay like a conversion fee to translate to dollars?

02:21:11.445 --> 02:21:12.906
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, yeah, it's a conversion fee.

02:21:14.246 --> 02:21:19.709
[SPEAKER_17]: You can pay via PayPal, Amazon.com checkout, or Google checkout also.

02:21:20.269 --> 02:21:22.030
[SPEAKER_17]: You can get an account on those sites.

02:21:22.530 --> 02:21:23.030
[SPEAKER_17]: I gotcha.

02:21:23.250 --> 02:21:30.292
[SPEAKER_09]: And plus, you live relatively close to the border of the U.S., so I don't know, do you maybe have some bank accounts to deal in dollars?

02:21:32.073 --> 02:21:36.894
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually have international credit cards, so I just use them.

02:21:37.154 --> 02:21:42.096
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually people in border towns, no matter where you are, have some type of pass to kind of go between.

02:21:43.376 --> 02:21:44.416
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, very cool.

02:21:45.877 --> 02:21:47.537
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll quickly ask you this.

02:21:47.617 --> 02:21:49.578
[SPEAKER_09]: Which game was your favorite out of the bunch?

02:21:50.902 --> 02:21:54.865
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I haven't tried any of them because I got it today.

02:21:55.405 --> 02:21:58.087
[SPEAKER_17]: Though I have played World of Goo and that's a pretty good game.

02:21:58.627 --> 02:22:02.010
[SPEAKER_17]: I would recommend downloading this just for that game.

02:22:02.650 --> 02:22:06.773
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're donating money just based on that game and everything else is just a bonus?

02:22:07.799 --> 02:22:08.219
[SPEAKER_17]: Probably.

02:22:08.359 --> 02:22:08.959
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fair enough.

02:22:09.139 --> 02:22:09.499
[SPEAKER_09]: Fair enough.

02:22:10.340 --> 02:22:10.940
[SPEAKER_09]: I can go with that.

02:22:11.620 --> 02:22:11.900
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

02:22:11.940 --> 02:22:13.580
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Actdeft, thank you for the heads up.

02:22:13.620 --> 02:22:17.841
[SPEAKER_09]: We always like cheap games or expensive games, whatever you think they're worth.

02:22:18.621 --> 02:22:23.282
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I read somewhere the average amount that people were paying were like $10 for all the games.

02:22:23.602 --> 02:22:27.123
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, for six games, it's not a lot of money.

02:22:27.163 --> 02:22:29.664
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, it's an average of everything.

02:22:29.704 --> 02:22:32.104
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess, you know, some people just simply can't afford more.

02:22:32.364 --> 02:22:35.765
[SPEAKER_09]: So hopefully people are paying what they really truly believe it's worth.

02:22:36.653 --> 02:22:42.175
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, the average contribution here is $8.36, though they have raised over $600,000.

02:22:44.596 --> 02:22:48.377
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess in the end that's what really counts, is the amount they've raised as a whole.

02:22:48.798 --> 02:22:52.099
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, Actdeft, we're going to let you go, but thank you so much for your call.

02:22:53.739 --> 02:22:54.120
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

02:22:54.180 --> 02:22:54.900
[SPEAKER_09]: Have fun with the games.

02:22:56.337 --> 02:22:57.417
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I like that heads up.

02:22:57.457 --> 02:23:04.100
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I like that because it was a good heads up and it was like a sale on games, although I don't know if you really call that a sale or what.

02:23:04.400 --> 02:23:06.121
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been other games that have kind of done that lately.

02:23:06.141 --> 02:23:08.822
[SPEAKER_09]: 877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lingerie.

02:23:08.842 --> 02:23:10.843
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got time to do at least one more call.

02:23:11.143 --> 02:23:14.925
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been a lot of kind of game things that have been doing this lately, like that game...

02:23:16.345 --> 02:23:22.509
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan and I were playing on Steam one day and it's like you draw these crayon lines with the mouse and I can't remember the name of it.

02:23:22.849 --> 02:23:24.190
[SPEAKER_09]: But that had a sale for a little while.

02:23:24.230 --> 02:23:25.110
[SPEAKER_09]: Crayon Physics?

02:23:25.370 --> 02:23:25.750
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that it?

02:23:25.790 --> 02:23:26.371
[SPEAKER_09]: Crayon Physics?

02:23:26.391 --> 02:23:26.971
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think it was.

02:23:27.752 --> 02:23:32.114
[SPEAKER_09]: You could pay whatever you want for that game and there's been a few games that have done that lately.

02:23:32.154 --> 02:23:34.475
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't World of Goo just alone do that for a little while?

02:23:35.236 --> 02:23:35.776
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it did.

02:23:36.997 --> 02:23:37.577
[SPEAKER_09]: Could be wrong though.

02:23:39.278 --> 02:23:40.899
[SPEAKER_09]: One day and 16 hours left, by the way.

02:23:40.979 --> 02:23:42.280
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft is clarifying in chat.

02:23:42.340 --> 02:23:47.104
[SPEAKER_09]: Wolfire.com W-O-L-F-I-R-E.com slash humble.

02:23:47.124 --> 02:23:51.187
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get to at least one more call here on Orange Lounge Radio tonight before we say goodnight.

02:23:51.247 --> 02:23:52.388
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:23:52.408 --> 02:23:52.768
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

02:23:54.129 --> 02:23:54.990
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Amiga777.

02:23:55.991 --> 02:23:57.532
[SPEAKER_09]: Amiga777.

02:23:57.552 --> 02:23:58.172
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind?

02:23:59.353 --> 02:24:05.918
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first off, I'd like to give a Happy Mother's Day shout-out to Dark Sakura.

02:24:07.600 --> 02:24:07.700
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh...

02:24:08.513 --> 02:24:09.654
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you're a mother to Shermie.

02:24:10.214 --> 02:24:10.514
[SPEAKER_13]: I am.

02:24:11.095 --> 02:24:14.037
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, well, yeah, I have my cat.

02:24:14.097 --> 02:24:16.639
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have actual children, but thank you.

02:24:18.080 --> 02:24:18.340
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

02:24:19.721 --> 02:24:26.226
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyway, I was wondering, have you all heard about Angry Birds?

02:24:28.287 --> 02:24:29.668
[SPEAKER_09]: Like actual Angry Birds?

02:24:29.688 --> 02:24:30.088
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait a minute.

02:24:30.208 --> 02:24:31.009
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this a movie?

02:24:32.703 --> 02:24:33.023
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

02:24:33.223 --> 02:24:33.924
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, never mind.

02:24:33.944 --> 02:24:35.005
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I'm thinking of something else.

02:24:35.185 --> 02:24:38.187
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm thinking of Birdemic or whatever.

02:24:38.627 --> 02:24:41.889
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a new one with slugs now.

02:24:42.350 --> 02:24:43.190
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking of something.

02:24:43.270 --> 02:24:45.131
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking of like a sci-fi movie or something.

02:24:45.191 --> 02:24:46.893
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry about that.

02:24:46.913 --> 02:24:49.394
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the birds, probably like Alfred Hitchcock.

02:24:49.534 --> 02:24:50.835
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that's what I'm thinking of.

02:24:50.895 --> 02:24:53.097
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, what is Angry Birds, sir?

02:24:54.137 --> 02:25:02.023
[SPEAKER_02]: Angry Birds is typically a game that no iPhone slash iPod touch user should be without today.

02:25:03.684 --> 02:25:04.564
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a game.

02:25:04.824 --> 02:25:06.425
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta ask, is this your game?

02:25:07.445 --> 02:25:08.586
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I didn't make it.

02:25:09.746 --> 02:25:10.367
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, alright.

02:25:10.767 --> 02:25:11.447
[SPEAKER_09]: Then plug away.

02:25:12.868 --> 02:25:13.188
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

02:25:13.968 --> 02:25:28.455
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, the story is, you got these evil greenish pigs or whatever that stole the birds' eggs and

02:25:29.218 --> 02:25:33.222
[SPEAKER_02]: and whatnot, and probably just doing God knows what with them.

02:25:34.303 --> 02:25:52.501
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what you have to do is unleash your vengeance with your birds by basically flinging them across this little map

02:25:53.676 --> 02:26:03.899
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, destroying and, you know, eliminating all the pigs in the game.

02:26:05.139 --> 02:26:12.921
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I got to tell you real quick, Amiga777, I don't mean to cut you off, but we actually just got delivered an exclusive commercial for the game.

02:26:12.981 --> 02:26:13.461
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to hear it?

02:26:14.341 --> 02:26:14.761
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

02:26:14.822 --> 02:26:15.302
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, here it is.

02:26:15.422 --> 02:26:16.602
[SPEAKER_09]: Exclusive commercial for the game.

02:26:19.163 --> 02:26:20.603
[SPEAKER_04]: Brian, can I see that paper for a second?

02:26:23.072 --> 02:26:24.293
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm, that's odd.

02:26:25.053 --> 02:26:26.294
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that would be big news.

02:26:26.534 --> 02:26:27.755
[SPEAKER_04]: You thought what would be big news?

02:26:27.995 --> 02:26:31.918
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there seems to be an absence of a certain ornithological piece.

02:26:33.152 --> 02:26:37.415
[SPEAKER_04]: A headline regarding mass awareness of a certain avian variety.

02:26:37.595 --> 02:26:38.456
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you talking about?

02:26:38.716 --> 02:26:39.416
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, have you not heard?

02:26:40.117 --> 02:26:42.198
[SPEAKER_04]: It was my understanding that everyone had heard.

02:26:42.378 --> 02:26:42.799
[SPEAKER_04]: Heard what?

02:26:42.919 --> 02:26:43.439
[SPEAKER_04]: Brian, don't!

02:26:43.559 --> 02:26:44.600
[SPEAKER_06]: The greatest episode ever.

02:26:44.640 --> 02:26:46.281
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you know about the bird?

02:26:46.301 --> 02:26:48.423
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Peter's gonna tell you about the bird.

02:26:48.563 --> 02:26:49.423
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, a bird, bird.

02:26:49.463 --> 02:26:51.565
[SPEAKER_06]: The bird, the word, the word, the bird.

02:26:51.585 --> 02:26:51.785
[SPEAKER_06]: Sir!

02:27:02.492 --> 02:27:03.112
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect!

02:27:03.412 --> 02:27:04.573
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, Peter, are you alright?

02:27:28.447 --> 02:27:31.950
[SPEAKER_09]: This just in, Angry Birds just sold 10,000 copies right there.

02:27:33.051 --> 02:27:33.691
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously?

02:27:34.532 --> 02:27:35.853
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm just fucking with you.

02:27:35.933 --> 02:27:36.314
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.

02:27:37.294 --> 02:27:39.276
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Orange Lounge Radio, for heaven's sakes.

02:27:39.356 --> 02:27:40.757
[SPEAKER_09]: We love random tangents.

02:27:41.358 --> 02:27:42.959
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I couldn't resist.

02:27:43.019 --> 02:27:43.499
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

02:27:44.260 --> 02:27:45.221
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that was awesome.

02:27:45.541 --> 02:27:46.642
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's all good.

02:27:46.662 --> 02:27:52.587
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously, it is selling a lot, and the company claims it's in more countries than they can count.

02:27:53.428 --> 02:27:54.569
[SPEAKER_02]: It's become a big deal.

02:27:56.880 --> 02:28:00.627
[SPEAKER_09]: So, how much is this game going to set you back?

02:28:01.930 --> 02:28:02.912
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's just 99 cents.

02:28:03.032 --> 02:28:05.196
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, that's not bad at all.

02:28:05.597 --> 02:28:08.783
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some people are saying, it's so good, they think it's underpriced.

02:28:09.537 --> 02:28:15.362
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now, I don't want them to go the route of that one guy who, like, kept increasing the price of his game.

02:28:15.402 --> 02:28:20.606
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, what was that one game that went up to, like, $10,000 on the store before Apple was like, what the fuck are you doing?

02:28:20.666 --> 02:28:21.767
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, he's a douchebag.

02:28:21.787 --> 02:28:23.228
[SPEAKER_07]: Get out, douchebag.

02:28:23.748 --> 02:28:25.129
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a social experiment.

02:28:25.190 --> 02:28:26.851
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually, you know what, though?

02:28:27.251 --> 02:28:28.892
[SPEAKER_07]: So what, he raised the price of his game.

02:28:28.932 --> 02:28:33.236
[SPEAKER_07]: People were dumb enough to buy it, so props to him for figuring out a way to make money.

02:28:36.024 --> 02:28:36.325
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

02:28:36.505 --> 02:28:36.785
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

02:28:37.086 --> 02:28:46.579
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Amiga77777, hopefully some folks will check out Angry Bird this week and realize that the bird is indeed the word.

02:28:47.039 --> 02:28:47.700
[SPEAKER_06]: Ba-ba-ba-bird.

02:28:47.720 --> 02:28:48.121
[SPEAKER_06]: I can get down.

02:28:48.281 --> 02:28:49.683
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

02:28:52.287 --> 02:28:55.612
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you sure you don't know the people that programmed it?

02:28:55.772 --> 02:28:57.995
[SPEAKER_09]: Or, you know, getting the cut for the profits?

02:28:58.015 --> 02:29:03.522
[SPEAKER_09]: The name of the company?

02:29:04.123 --> 02:29:05.966
[SPEAKER_09]: No, do you know the people that made it?

02:29:08.623 --> 02:29:10.885
[SPEAKER_02]: Click Gamer, and Ravio.

02:29:11.426 --> 02:29:11.666
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

02:29:11.686 --> 02:29:12.747
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't know them personally, though.

02:29:12.807 --> 02:29:13.588
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have their phone number?

02:29:13.608 --> 02:29:15.229
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't know the people.

02:29:15.610 --> 02:29:15.910
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

02:29:16.510 --> 02:29:16.751
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

02:29:17.071 --> 02:29:20.034
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for the plug.

02:29:20.074 --> 02:29:22.636
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure the developers of the game really appreciate you right now.

02:29:23.817 --> 02:29:24.097
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

02:29:24.418 --> 02:29:25.238
[SPEAKER_09]: And we appreciate you, too.

02:29:25.298 --> 02:29:25.799
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care, buddy.

02:29:26.359 --> 02:29:26.760
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care.

02:29:27.380 --> 02:29:27.720
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

02:29:28.081 --> 02:29:29.882
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

02:29:31.633 --> 02:29:35.177
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of funny because we don't really run commercials on this show but yet we do.

02:29:36.798 --> 02:29:39.200
[SPEAKER_09]: It's always somebody's podcast or game.

02:29:39.240 --> 02:29:39.961
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's all good.

02:29:40.382 --> 02:29:40.782
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

02:29:40.822 --> 02:29:44.285
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to know what people are playing and I'm all for supporting indie developers.

02:29:44.345 --> 02:29:44.786
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all good.

02:29:45.509 --> 02:29:47.029
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, that's it.

02:29:47.109 --> 02:29:51.910
[SPEAKER_09]: We're about ready to wrap up shop and be done here with the show tonight and be all over.

02:29:52.090 --> 02:29:55.551
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you had any other last minute stories you wanted to get to before I closed the shop.

02:29:55.731 --> 02:29:59.772
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really a story at all, but I think I mentioned it on my Twitter.

02:30:00.712 --> 02:30:08.234
[SPEAKER_07]: I got picked, not that I'm actually going to use the service, I got picked to be a part of the Game Crush service.

02:30:08.874 --> 02:30:11.955
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, because right now they have limited access to the website.

02:30:12.135 --> 02:30:13.915
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that the, like...

02:30:15.215 --> 02:30:43.207
[SPEAKER_09]: Almost Prostitution But With Video Games Yes But Now We Get To View The Actual Website Because I Have It's Funny I Am All For Tearing This Thing Up And Looking At It On Next Week's Show However Make Sure There's No NDA Or Nothing Because I Don't Want To Get In No Trouble Cease And Desist Whatever Make Sure We're Good There Alright Alright Well Then We'll Look At That In A Few Weeks That's It And I'm Assuming DarkSakura Doesn't Have Any Last Minute Stories I Think She Said A Moment Ago So Nope Alright

02:30:43.632 --> 02:30:47.194
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to let her go back to playing Final Fantasy 2 and everybody go back to whatever they're doing.

02:30:47.654 --> 02:30:51.996
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, but first we're going to wrap up the show by getting everybody's final thoughts.

02:30:53.576 --> 02:30:54.557
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought first.

02:30:54.597 --> 02:30:55.237
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll start tonight.

02:30:55.417 --> 02:30:56.858
[SPEAKER_09]: I really don't want to go to the dentist.

02:30:57.978 --> 02:30:58.739
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, your final thought.

02:31:03.821 --> 02:31:05.342
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody leaked Sonic 4.

02:31:06.662 --> 02:31:08.923
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, last but not least, your final thought tonight.

02:31:09.924 --> 02:31:10.664
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a pie.

02:31:12.202 --> 02:31:14.104
[SPEAKER_09]: I had banana cream pie last night, it was fabulous.

02:31:14.144 --> 02:31:17.587
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm not eating pie, I'll just make myself some chocolate something.

02:31:17.927 --> 02:31:19.628
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

02:31:19.688 --> 02:31:22.030
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't you have like spinach pie or something?

02:31:23.091 --> 02:31:25.833
[SPEAKER_15]: If I wasn't out of bananas, I'd just make myself some banana pudding.

02:31:26.834 --> 02:31:35.722
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I know the whole thing is raw foods, but are you allowed to, like if you are putting it together and you put spinach and all this stuff in there, are you allowed to put it in the oven and cook it?

02:31:35.902 --> 02:31:37.383
[SPEAKER_09]: Or no, you still have to stay away from that?

02:31:37.982 --> 02:31:40.104
[SPEAKER_15]: Allowing is such a strong word.

02:31:41.446 --> 02:31:43.428
[SPEAKER_15]: If I want it cooked, I'll have it cooked.

02:31:43.568 --> 02:31:44.609
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I'm not that.

02:31:46.170 --> 02:31:52.657
[SPEAKER_15]: But the whole essence, they say, is not to heat it more than 117 degrees because that's when the enzymes are destroyed.

02:31:55.679 --> 02:31:59.183
[SPEAKER_15]: That being said, I hate cooked spinach unless it's on a pizza.

02:32:00.569 --> 02:32:02.953
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I like raw spinach much better.

02:32:03.073 --> 02:32:04.415
[SPEAKER_09]: Spinach salad is the bomb.

02:32:04.996 --> 02:32:08.361
[SPEAKER_15]: I've actually got stuff together to make myself a good spinach salad for lunch tomorrow.

02:32:08.481 --> 02:32:08.862
[SPEAKER_15]: Good times.

02:32:09.878 --> 02:32:10.378
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, anyhow.

02:32:10.738 --> 02:32:13.219
[SPEAKER_09]: See, it starts and ends with food here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:32:13.820 --> 02:32:17.541
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you like the show, please, please tell a friend about the show.
