1
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:23,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Tonight, May 9th, 2010, StarCraft II gets a release date, Nintendo promises to increase anti-piracy measures on the 3DS, and a sequel to LittleBigPlanet gets confirmed.

2
00:00:31,636 --> 00:00:40,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, my friends, and welcome to episode number 366 of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:40,483 --> 00:00:46,949
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

4
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:47,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Mmm.

5
00:00:48,772 --> 00:00:49,152
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

6
00:00:50,914 --> 00:00:52,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Filled with food, apparently.

7
00:00:52,235 --> 00:00:54,077
[SPEAKER_09]: I had nummies.

8
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:57,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you talked about this on the show, your new diet, a little bit?

9
00:00:58,121 --> 00:00:58,922
[SPEAKER_15]: A little bit, yeah.

10
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:03,406
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not really so much of a diet anymore as a full-on lifestyle change.

11
00:01:04,654 --> 00:01:06,415
[SPEAKER_15]: I got sick of getting sick every time I eat.

12
00:01:07,255 --> 00:01:09,636
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I can't eat anything without being stuck.

13
00:01:09,856 --> 00:01:10,537
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to say it.

14
00:01:11,077 --> 00:01:12,958
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything makes me constipated.

15
00:01:14,078 --> 00:01:14,438
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything.

16
00:01:14,998 --> 00:01:16,159
[SPEAKER_09]: You just need more Metamucil.

17
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:16,779
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

18
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Or McDonald's.

19
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,760
[SPEAKER_15]: That made me throw up.

20
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,341
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the voice over there, the one and only Tech Master, Loki.

21
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:23,162
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you doing, Loki?

22
00:01:23,782 --> 00:01:26,003
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm fine, but I think I've eaten too much.

23
00:01:26,303 --> 00:01:27,364
[SPEAKER_07]: It's weird because...

24
00:01:28,484 --> 00:01:29,165
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

25
00:01:39,995 --> 00:01:40,836
[SPEAKER_15]: Blessing in Disguise

26
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:11,639
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura.com

27
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,321
[SPEAKER_07]: We discovered Smashburger and there went everything.

28
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:40,102
[SPEAKER_07]: So this weekend's been bad.

29
00:02:40,623 --> 00:02:49,427
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, so now I'm trying to eat my Twists and I'm shoving the last piece down my throat because I'm full.

30
00:02:50,017 --> 00:02:52,458
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're so delicious, I can't let them go to waste.

31
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:54,539
[SPEAKER_09]: They're good stuff, and they make the whole room smell yummy.

32
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:58,160
[SPEAKER_13]: May I say one thing so that I don't leave what I was saying on the word constipated?

33
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,562
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, of course, I know, sorry.

34
00:03:02,602 --> 00:03:04,282
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm eating 70 to 80% raw now.

35
00:03:05,303 --> 00:03:06,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, certain things I'll have cooked.

36
00:03:07,203 --> 00:03:11,725
[SPEAKER_15]: And I finally have gotten to the point where I'm trying to see where I can go out to eat.

37
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,706
[SPEAKER_15]: So far, Persian food is out if I eat meat.

38
00:03:17,047 --> 00:03:20,349
[SPEAKER_15]: Chevys is kind of okay, but I have to be careful of corn chips.

39
00:03:20,369 --> 00:03:21,089
[SPEAKER_15]: Corn chips make me sick.

40
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,571
[SPEAKER_15]: This morning I had eggs and they didn't make me sick.

41
00:03:24,231 --> 00:03:26,072
[SPEAKER_15]: So now I know what I can eat.

42
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:28,376
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

43
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,151
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

44
00:04:09,274 --> 00:04:09,594
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

45
00:04:09,654 --> 00:04:12,575
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think of the Warcraft episode of South Park and that guy.

46
00:04:13,155 --> 00:04:17,076
[SPEAKER_15]: Eating Cheetos off your chest playing Halo 2.

47
00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:24,639
[SPEAKER_09]: But how easy is it, though, to sit there and play a game like Halo 2 or whatever it is you play and go through a whole bag of Doritos?

48
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,080
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not the smartest lifestyle.

49
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,341
[SPEAKER_15]: That's called idle eating.

50
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:31,802
[SPEAKER_15]: And I do it when I'm working.

51
00:04:32,302 --> 00:04:34,223
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I've been working on my homework for my finals.

52
00:04:34,243 --> 00:04:38,526
[SPEAKER_15]: Because my finals next week, ooh, which are all projects, so that means I have a lot of crap to do.

53
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:43,088
[SPEAKER_15]: But the biggest thing that I always loved is I loved eating blue corn chips.

54
00:04:43,748 --> 00:04:46,229
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, just chomping away because I would feel too...

55
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,302
[SPEAKER_15]: I would get distracted from other stuff without something for my mouth to do or something.

56
00:04:51,883 --> 00:04:55,226
[SPEAKER_15]: And now I have pecans and goji berries that I snack on.

57
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me give you my piece of dieting advice.

58
00:04:58,228 --> 00:05:00,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that I'm one that really should be giving out dieting advice.

59
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,774
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's my tip for those of you that want to defy the gamer stereotype.

60
00:05:04,814 --> 00:05:08,777
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is one really easy thing you can do that will really cut back on a lot of this.

61
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:10,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, kind of a two-part thing.

62
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:13,602
[SPEAKER_09]: A, if you're eating Doritos, Ruffles, Lays, whatever...

63
00:05:14,202 --> 00:05:16,503
[SPEAKER_09]: See if you can't switch to something lower fat.

64
00:05:16,824 --> 00:05:24,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, even if it's just the baked version or pretzels are a really, really good substitute as long as you're not getting the ranch pretzels and all that.

65
00:05:24,428 --> 00:05:25,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Carrots and hummus.

66
00:05:27,098 --> 00:05:29,520
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think a lot of people are going to go that extreme.

67
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Certainly that would be ideal.

68
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Or pita chips and hummus.

69
00:05:32,923 --> 00:05:33,823
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's the other tip.

70
00:05:34,424 --> 00:05:36,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Put it in a bowl before you take it to the living room.

71
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:41,669
[SPEAKER_09]: That way you're rationing off a certain size and you don't go through a whole bag in one sitting.

72
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:42,750
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not perfect.

73
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,213
[SPEAKER_09]: I downed a whole bag of fortune cookies over the weekend because they're really good.

74
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:48,354
[SPEAKER_09]: They sell like flat fortune cookies.

75
00:05:48,394 --> 00:05:49,415
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like sugar paper.

76
00:05:49,435 --> 00:05:50,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, they're so good though.

77
00:05:50,396 --> 00:05:51,236
[SPEAKER_15]: With orange flavoring.

78
00:05:51,677 --> 00:05:52,677
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know how it goes.

79
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:53,938
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not always perfect.

80
00:05:54,018 --> 00:05:55,920
[SPEAKER_09]: But that would be my tip.

81
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:24,272
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want to be better when you're gaming And for anyone who is curious about how eating raw has affected me in other ways After my birthday, you know all that beer and cake that I consumed all week Because I had a lot of beer and cake left over I had gone, with my eating less thing, I had gone down 3 pounds And then I put back on 8 or 9 And now I'm back to where I was before my birthday So that means I've lost...

82
00:06:26,073 --> 00:06:29,095
[SPEAKER_15]: I've lost about eight pounds in a week.

83
00:06:29,855 --> 00:06:30,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations.

84
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Hope it can keep going for you.

85
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:32,957
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've been eating more.

86
00:06:33,577 --> 00:06:34,638
[SPEAKER_15]: For the record, I've been eating more.

87
00:06:34,858 --> 00:06:37,099
[SPEAKER_09]: But more vegetables and stuff.

88
00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:39,100
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been eating a lot of vegetables.

89
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,821
[SPEAKER_15]: And I like bananas now, Rob.

90
00:06:42,342 --> 00:06:43,802
[SPEAKER_15]: I used to only like banana-flavored things.

91
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Now I actually like bananas.

92
00:06:45,763 --> 00:06:46,884
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'll give everyone a quick recipe.

93
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:47,564
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a quick one.

94
00:06:47,664 --> 00:06:48,785
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, hurry, because we've got to get to games.

95
00:06:48,945 --> 00:06:50,766
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, what kind of games have you been playing this week?

96
00:07:18,844 --> 00:07:25,372
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually started off playing Final Fantasy 2, finally, I got around, and I like it Oh, like the iPhone one?

97
00:07:25,392 --> 00:07:32,801
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, the iPhone one The control's pretty interesting, and sometimes it doesn't want to actually go where I tell it to go But maybe it's because I've got big fat thumbs, I don't know

98
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:36,533
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet it plays better on a 3GS than it does the 3G too.

99
00:07:36,693 --> 00:07:39,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it has a slightly faster processor and those things, right?

100
00:07:39,255 --> 00:07:39,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.

101
00:07:39,955 --> 00:07:41,035
[SPEAKER_15]: It plays smoothly.

102
00:07:41,496 --> 00:07:41,776
[SPEAKER_09]: No problem.

103
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:43,897
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I have a 3G and I have issues.

104
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:44,437
[SPEAKER_15]: You can try mine.

105
00:07:45,157 --> 00:07:45,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I will.

106
00:07:45,878 --> 00:07:46,678
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

107
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:56,643
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I actually, while we were waiting to get into the stupid restaurant this morning, because seriously we were waiting for like an hour, I just finally got bored and beat Espagluta again on my iPhone.

108
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:03,167
[SPEAKER_15]: and I played some Star Trek Online.

109
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:03,847
[SPEAKER_15]: A little bit.

110
00:08:03,947 --> 00:08:07,850
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've been trying to fix my Sims and I think that I just have way too many mods so fuck it.

111
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,871
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just not going to play Sims.

112
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:12,193
[SPEAKER_09]: And DarkSakura is trying to sucker me into the world.

113
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:16,175
[SPEAKER_09]: I should say back into the world because I did play the beta for a little bit of Star Trek Online.

114
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:19,177
[SPEAKER_09]: She gave me a little 10 day code so I don't know.

115
00:08:19,718 --> 00:08:20,158
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

116
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:20,879
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

117
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:22,400
[SPEAKER_13]: Play for free with me.

118
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,841
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've been saving stuff to give you.

119
00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:27,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Like stuff to add on your ship.

120
00:08:28,405 --> 00:08:29,987
[SPEAKER_09]: You know I've already addicted to one MMO.

121
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:31,188
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I can get addicted to another.

122
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:31,589
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

123
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:31,909
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

124
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:44,925
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it was on the show or not, but there's that, remember they're doing now like an unlimited trial basically where you can go play the first couple tutorial levels or whatever and spend as much time you want doing that.

125
00:08:45,105 --> 00:08:45,725
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Star Trek?

126
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:46,887
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that was one of the others.

127
00:08:47,047 --> 00:08:47,908
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's Star Trek Online.

128
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:48,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

129
00:08:49,397 --> 00:08:49,697
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

130
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:15,852
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to win 500 games in a row.

131
00:09:16,712 --> 00:09:18,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, probably more like 1,000 games in a row.

132
00:09:18,613 --> 00:09:19,893
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm working on that.

133
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:23,915
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm about five now.

134
00:09:25,435 --> 00:09:26,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Doing a good job.

135
00:09:27,956 --> 00:09:35,699
[SPEAKER_07]: With how high I am on the TrueSkill leaderboard right now, if I lose a game, it bumps me down about five to ten ranks.

136
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:40,421
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have to win about five games to go up a rank.

137
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:43,763
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really frustrating when I get in.

138
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:51,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Not necessarily lose a game, because losing basically just by a few bucks would be considered a loss.

139
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:59,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, if you beat people, say if you don't win the game, but you beat three people, that still counts towards going up the leaderboards.

140
00:09:59,757 --> 00:10:03,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, but I have been playing perfect games though.

141
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,344
[SPEAKER_07]: So much so that it's been pissing off my coworkers and they actually threatened to pull the Ethernet one time.

142
00:10:09,384 --> 00:10:12,946
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, they did for a second and plugged it back in.

143
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:13,967
[SPEAKER_07]: I got pissed off at them.

144
00:10:14,027 --> 00:10:17,930
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, hey, I'm pretty high up there.

145
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,871
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like rank 70 right now.

146
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:23,874
[SPEAKER_07]: And 70 out of 60,000 people is pretty damn good, if you ask me.

147
00:10:26,135 --> 00:10:26,676
[SPEAKER_07]: And then...

148
00:10:27,406 --> 00:10:28,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Me, me, me, me, I'm the best.

149
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:29,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Me, me, me, I'm the best.

150
00:10:29,748 --> 00:10:30,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey!

151
00:10:31,869 --> 00:10:32,590
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just messing.

152
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,971
[SPEAKER_07]: The leaderboards say so.

153
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,993
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a leaderboard thing this week, too, and I'll get into that in a minute.

154
00:10:37,113 --> 00:10:38,273
[SPEAKER_07]: And I work really hard for it.

155
00:10:38,954 --> 00:10:48,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Trust me, if anybody plays actually Grand Theft Auto out there on the ranked games, you have to know how hard it is to get an actual game with people in it.

156
00:10:49,421 --> 00:10:54,404
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on top of that, getting a game where you finish with everybody still...

157
00:10:55,805 --> 00:10:59,108
[SPEAKER_07]: in the game because a lot of people rage quit out of all these games.

158
00:10:59,849 --> 00:11:02,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially the games I'm in because I kick the crap out of them.

159
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:06,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm surprised you don't get penalized for that stuff.

160
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:06,654
[SPEAKER_07]: You can.

161
00:11:07,214 --> 00:11:17,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically what you do is you go, if they quit out when you're done with the game, or during the game sometimes I'll do that, you go to their profile and you put review.

162
00:11:17,683 --> 00:11:18,944
[SPEAKER_09]: You can do that in any game though.

163
00:11:18,984 --> 00:11:19,164
[SPEAKER_09]: There's

164
00:11:19,484 --> 00:11:20,224
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

165
00:11:48,697 --> 00:11:54,681
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm better than everybody, I'm going to kick the crap out of anybody I had 33 kills, the person below me had 3 I had 33 kills, didn't you?

166
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:12,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever, okay?

167
00:12:13,057 --> 00:12:15,498
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish someone would show me up, but no one's coming.

168
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:18,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's the other 69 players ahead of you?

169
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,360
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

170
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,982
[SPEAKER_07]: But see, it's weird though, the true skill rankings, it's just win-losses.

171
00:12:23,102 --> 00:12:24,543
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a lot of people on there.

172
00:12:24,843 --> 00:12:26,163
[SPEAKER_07]: I play like 300-some games.

173
00:12:26,524 --> 00:12:32,446
[SPEAKER_07]: There's people on there that are above me that have played like 20 games, but they've just happened to win the majority of those 20 games.

174
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:37,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I could create a new profile, win all the games, and then, oh, look at that, I'm at the top of the list.

175
00:12:37,728 --> 00:12:39,749
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's not playing fair.

176
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:49,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so other than that, I'm actually now working on, we're going to go back to playing the modded games again because it's just too hard to find people to play with.

177
00:12:49,572 --> 00:12:56,174
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm looking and doing the research phase of a new modded Grand Theft Auto game.

178
00:12:56,194 --> 00:12:59,495
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm looking now on map editing and stuff like that because it's,

179
00:13:00,255 --> 00:13:03,960
[SPEAKER_07]: We gotta have ramps and stuff going to the moon, you know, basically in this game.

180
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to edge it out a little bit more than it was last time.

181
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,147
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm definitely looking forward to doing that.

182
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:17,034
[SPEAKER_07]: And without modding the consoles, of course, we're gonna do the disc swap technique with that.

183
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:31,195
[SPEAKER_07]: and then I just have a lot of games I'm waiting for Red Dead Redemption supposedly coming out in a few weeks so looking forward to that but have Alan Wake and Lost Planet 2 to get to and a whole bunch of stuff

184
00:13:33,257 --> 00:13:35,819
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, if you're done, then my gaming week.

185
00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:37,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and I joined the APB beta.

186
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:43,643
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully, the beta requirements are a little bit more than what the actual game requires.

187
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:51,188
[SPEAKER_07]: It says I need more RAM, even though I have Windows XP 3 2-bit, and I have 2 gigs of RAM, and Windows doesn't see really any more than that.

188
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:54,490
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'll get like 2 point something gigs of RAM.

189
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,551
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just need to get some more RAM.

190
00:13:56,591 --> 00:13:58,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably going to upgrade my graphics card as well.

191
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:00,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking forward to that game.

192
00:14:01,434 --> 00:14:01,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

193
00:14:02,795 --> 00:14:06,177
[SPEAKER_09]: My gaming week, honestly, not a whole lot different than last week.

194
00:14:06,818 --> 00:14:10,200
[SPEAKER_09]: A little disappointing because I had so many games last week and this week not quite as many.

195
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,981
[SPEAKER_09]: It was mostly the same stuff.

196
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:17,304
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still enjoying my new video card with lots of World of Warcraft, of course, and Dragon Age a little bit here and there too.

197
00:14:17,885 --> 00:14:23,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably the only other newish thing I played was some of the new Game Room releases, although I guess that's not really new now, is it?

198
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:25,389
[SPEAKER_09]: These games from 1981 and so forth.

199
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,731
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen

200
00:14:46,229 --> 00:14:53,313
[SPEAKER_09]: So hopefully they're going to stick to that schedule and prove me wrong a little bit on some of the things last week, which is good, because there's a lot about Game Room I do like.

201
00:14:54,594 --> 00:15:01,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I think there's a lot of room for improvement, and I hope that that base engine for Game Room will not stay that way forever.

202
00:15:01,738 --> 00:15:03,298
[SPEAKER_09]: I do hope they make some upgrades to it.

203
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:04,719
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

204
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,523
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

205
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Pitfall is a timed game.

206
00:15:23,861 --> 00:15:27,502
[SPEAKER_09]: You only have 20 minutes tops to run through the jungle and collect as much treasure as you can.

207
00:15:27,842 --> 00:15:34,204
[SPEAKER_09]: So I played for the full 20 minutes without losing all my lives because some things you learn when you're five and you never forget.

208
00:15:34,504 --> 00:15:38,046
[SPEAKER_09]: And the thing I learned is how to get across that alligator pit when there's no vines.

209
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:40,367
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the part of the game that usually trips people up.

210
00:15:40,747 --> 00:15:45,469
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I was able to get through there and I pretty much ran consistently for 20 minutes.

211
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:46,369
[SPEAKER_09]: I go...

212
00:15:47,626 --> 00:15:48,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

213
00:16:08,432 --> 00:16:09,353
[SPEAKER_09]: That's if you get all the treasure.

214
00:16:09,753 --> 00:16:14,195
[SPEAKER_09]: I was only 400 points shy of being in the top 20 on the game room leaderboard at the time.

215
00:16:14,255 --> 00:16:15,495
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's gotten a lot harder now.

216
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:17,436
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the minimum score is about 100,000 now.

217
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:22,759
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just need to learn one thing I didn't know as a kid was how to navigate the tunnels.

218
00:16:23,099 --> 00:16:26,160
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought the tunnels were stupid because trying to get around the scorpions is kind of hard.

219
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:34,404
[SPEAKER_09]: So I never really learned how to navigate the tunnels and my little five, six-year-old brain didn't understand a tunnel skips three regular screens.

220
00:16:34,844 --> 00:16:40,848
[SPEAKER_09]: So I didn't really learn the patterns that some people, I'm sure, memorized when they were younger, and that's how they're getting on the leaderboard now.

221
00:16:41,348 --> 00:16:44,370
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe I'll go back to that and try to actually play a better game.

222
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:44,731
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

223
00:16:44,811 --> 00:16:50,434
[SPEAKER_09]: But other games I checked out this week on Game Room, Super Breakout, which I think kind of stinks.

224
00:16:50,674 --> 00:16:57,579
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I realize it was the first game like it, but I would much rather see a game like Arkanoid or something come to a Game Room.

225
00:16:57,619 --> 00:16:58,900
[SPEAKER_09]: And plus the controller...

226
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

227
00:17:24,129 --> 00:17:40,445
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw on our chatroom By the way, join us in our chatroom if you're not already there We do tape live every week at All Games Radio www.allgames.com at 6pm Pacific right after the Bobby Blackwolf show But if you are listening to us live pull up a chair and join us in our chatroom chat.orangeloungeradio.com And TigerClaw actually says

228
00:17:40,905 --> 00:17:41,585
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

229
00:18:04,156 --> 00:18:04,477
[SPEAKER_09]: No kill screen!

230
00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:22,200
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm joking.

231
00:18:43,143 --> 00:18:44,323
[SPEAKER_09]: is also on Game Room this week.

232
00:18:44,603 --> 00:18:46,624
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was kind of a funny shooter game.

233
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:48,145
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a little silly.

234
00:18:48,185 --> 00:18:52,607
[SPEAKER_09]: You could say it's Space Invaders-esque, but basically objects are falling from the sky or they float in the sky.

235
00:18:52,948 --> 00:18:53,608
[SPEAKER_09]: You shoot them.

236
00:18:54,849 --> 00:19:06,334
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little more challenging, I think, in some ways in Space Invaders because the things, they're supposed to be based on household objects, like you shoot toasters and hamburgers, but it's Atari 2600 graphics.

237
00:19:06,394 --> 00:19:07,295
[SPEAKER_09]: So they just all look like

238
00:19:07,475 --> 00:19:08,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Blob and Blob.

239
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you're shooting things.

240
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:16,064
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of the things in later levels float down towards the bottom, but they're in very specific patterns.

241
00:19:17,445 --> 00:19:21,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of them will hover right where your ship could go, so you have to actually kind of memorize the patterns.

242
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you could go explodey.

243
00:19:23,777 --> 00:19:25,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, and Vandy in our chatroom says River Raid.

244
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,482
[SPEAKER_09]: That is definitely a classic Activision game, too.

245
00:19:28,303 --> 00:19:29,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots and lots of good stuff.

246
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:34,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, SalaciousPop asking me in chat if I ever got in on the Civ 3 for sale.

247
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:35,974
[SPEAKER_09]: I should put that out as an FYI.

248
00:19:36,434 --> 00:19:37,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Steam was running a sale.

249
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:39,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Civilization 3 Complete Edition

250
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:44,061
[SPEAKER_09]: A dollar twenty-five That's a great deal What?

251
00:19:44,301 --> 00:20:02,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, on Steam Civ 3, the complete edition But get this Civ 4 I think was like And Alan, correct me if I'm wrong But I think it was like $19.95 No, I think it was less than that Maybe $12.95 For everything Civ 4 Civ 4, the expansion and colonization Was like less than $20 It was nice

252
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:32,704
[SPEAKER_09]: one other thing I do want to mention during my game week because I do play a lot of World of Warcraft lots of information leaking on Cataclysm this week I don't want to go too spoilery because I know some people are really trying to prevent hearing all the spoilers a lot of what I've seen is very visual so thankfully this is a radio show and I can't really spoil the visuals but I will say I am so glad that the game is getting like a graphical upgrade I think it's great that Blizzard is kind of taking this opportunity to say let's see how could we like retcon a graphical upgrade into the game oh

253
00:20:33,724 --> 00:20:38,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's blow up the world as it is and make this whole new world and it'll have all new graphics.

254
00:20:40,129 --> 00:20:41,250
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of the screenshots are great.

255
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,571
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah.

256
00:20:43,571 --> 00:20:45,833
[SPEAKER_09]: And Bobby in chat is correcting us, jumping in.

257
00:20:46,734 --> 00:20:49,216
[SPEAKER_09]: $10 for Civ IV, the two expansions, and colonization.

258
00:20:49,236 --> 00:20:50,136
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a great deal.

259
00:20:50,557 --> 00:20:51,517
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a great deal.

260
00:20:51,537 --> 00:20:53,239
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta get in on that before it's over.

261
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:54,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn you, Steam.

262
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:24,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Nickel and Diamond me for all these old games yeah so World of Warcraft Cataclysm I'm excited about that kind of surprised at how fast information is leaking out but the friends and family alpha is going on and unfortunately not everybody's friends and family at Blizzard can apparently be trusted because once it hits the internet which the client has apparently it's done because that thing's got data mined and there's pictures and models and everything so yeah looking forward to some of the things they have planned for the expansion

263
00:21:25,663 --> 00:21:28,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's get into some housekeeping tonight.

264
00:21:28,384 --> 00:21:37,627
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to wish a very happy Mother's Day to all the mothers who happen to be listening and all of your mothers or motherly figure in your life and what have you who happen to be tuning in.

265
00:21:37,687 --> 00:21:39,888
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if we have a lot of mothers that listen to this show.

266
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:41,549
[SPEAKER_09]: We all know mine doesn't listen.

267
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:43,010
[SPEAKER_15]: We have one listening now.

268
00:21:43,731 --> 00:21:44,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Becky, right?

269
00:21:44,752 --> 00:21:45,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, happy Mother's Day, Becky.

270
00:21:46,393 --> 00:21:50,557
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think Deakman's wife might listen once in a while.

271
00:21:51,057 --> 00:21:52,679
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know what other mothers.

272
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:53,940
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize if I forgot you.

273
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,484
[SPEAKER_09]: But happy Mother's Day to all you or just anybody who considers themselves a mother.

274
00:21:59,085 --> 00:21:59,345
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

275
00:22:00,306 --> 00:22:03,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on and actually get into some gaming news now.

276
00:22:03,509 --> 00:22:07,392
[SPEAKER_09]: And speaking of Blizzard, I believe we're starting off tonight with just an avalanche of Blizzard news.

277
00:22:07,432 --> 00:22:07,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, Loki?

278
00:22:07,752 --> 00:22:07,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

279
00:22:08,653 --> 00:22:12,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there's a lot of news coming out for... I heard what you did there.

280
00:22:12,878 --> 00:22:13,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Totally unintended, too.

281
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally unintended.

282
00:22:17,624 --> 00:22:27,155
[SPEAKER_07]: With StarCraft 2, of course, they announced the release date for July 27th, and both the collector's edition and the regular edition will be coming out that...

283
00:22:27,956 --> 00:22:31,557
[SPEAKER_07]: At that time, of course, this will be the first StarCraft 2 that's being released.

284
00:22:31,677 --> 00:22:35,518
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe there's still going to be two more because one for each campaign.

285
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:36,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Way to whore it out.

286
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:40,140
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of neat.

287
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Some other neat things, though.

288
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently the map editor is very versatile.

289
00:22:45,501 --> 00:22:50,863
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, not only can you make custom maps with it, you can make custom games with it.

290
00:22:52,344 --> 00:22:54,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people have used different examples here.

291
00:22:55,106 --> 00:22:57,508
[SPEAKER_07]: They've made a Tetris-like game.

292
00:22:58,529 --> 00:23:04,754
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a Mario Kart type of game where you can race different characters around.

293
00:23:05,415 --> 00:23:11,340
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally, there was also a Shmup game made with the editor as well.

294
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:16,424
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty awesome that you have so much flexibility with just that editor.

295
00:23:18,717 --> 00:23:21,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Be very interesting to see what kind of mods you'll see for it.

296
00:23:21,618 --> 00:23:24,980
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be more interesting to see what Blizzard does to not have this happen.

297
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:29,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, I don't know, Blizzard also kind of is supporting the mod community because they kind of realize it's going to happen.

298
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:34,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Warcraft especially, you know, I notice there's two kinds of people.

299
00:23:34,244 --> 00:23:36,405
[SPEAKER_09]: There's StarCraft people and there's Diablo people.

300
00:23:36,525 --> 00:23:40,006
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm more of a Diablo person, so I don't follow the StarCraft news as much.

301
00:23:40,367 --> 00:23:44,408
[SPEAKER_09]: But at least when it comes to World of Warcraft, they're very embracing of the mod community there.

302
00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:47,430
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe they're laughing at this too.

303
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:47,750
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

304
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:50,674
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty neat.

305
00:23:51,955 --> 00:24:00,477
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not planning on picking up the game, though, because I don't think I was either a StarCraft or a Warcraft type of person.

306
00:24:01,277 --> 00:24:06,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, I did play the original Warcraft, but that was how long ago I played the original Warcraft.

307
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:08,019
[SPEAKER_07]: That would have been about 15 years ago.

308
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:09,560
[SPEAKER_09]: The original Warcraft's pretty old.

309
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:09,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

310
00:24:13,112 --> 00:24:14,734
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

311
00:24:15,034 --> 00:24:17,318
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have you know, I didn't actually buy Warcraft.

312
00:24:17,518 --> 00:24:19,982
[SPEAKER_07]: I played the demo in PC Gamer.

313
00:24:20,783 --> 00:24:21,945
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how old.

314
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:28,589
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to our listeners' chats here at chat.orangeentree.com.

315
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:31,190
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw says, Sky, you should call your mother during the show.

316
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:35,692
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, Loomis follows up, any chance of the OLR crew calling their moms?

317
00:24:35,732 --> 00:24:37,754
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember y'all tried a few months ago, and it was a lot of fun.

318
00:24:38,574 --> 00:24:44,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you know, I already called my mom this morning, and we chatted about that, because she said I was surprised I wasn't calling her during the show.

319
00:24:44,857 --> 00:24:47,599
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, well, you know, we kind of did that bit a couple weeks ago.

320
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:51,561
[SPEAKER_15]: I called my mom and talked to her while I was waiting to get in the restaurant, yeah.

321
00:24:51,561 --> 00:24:52,962
[SPEAKER_09]: I already did stuff with my mom this week.

322
00:25:19,459 --> 00:25:46,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, let's see, other comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchery.com Bochikawa talking about the Cataclysm leaks Sky, remember not all leaks are unintentional Blizz only gets more people interested for what they're showing off in Cat That's true, you know, I'm sure Blizzard to some extent realizes that a lot of the stuff they put in the Friends and Family Alpha is going to be out there even though it's all under NDA and they've come out and said, hey, all this stuff is still under NDA although it hasn't stopped MMO Champion from running everything

323
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:53,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but I, I, I think to some extent, uh, anything they put out there, they realize is, is gonna leak.

324
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:57,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but there's, there's a lot that isn't in the Cataclysm beta right now.

325
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:00,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, like, like not every zone, apparently.

326
00:26:01,181 --> 00:26:01,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

327
00:26:02,723 --> 00:26:03,903
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

328
00:26:22,955 --> 00:26:48,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, one thing that also could change in the future, apparently the Wii, and Nintendo in general, might be kind of reconsidering their stance on online, because apparently Nintendo, you know, one place Nintendo fails hardcore is online, and a lot of that has to do with, you know, the whole friend code thing was a little bit silly, and, you know, just that they haven't embraced the online gaming to the extent that Xbox Live or even, you know, PlayStation Network has.

329
00:26:49,835 --> 00:26:55,898
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some comments that Miyamoto, the god of Nintendo in many ways, brought us Mario and all these folks.

330
00:26:56,358 --> 00:27:00,479
[SPEAKER_09]: He talked to Edge Magazine and apparently was talking about online business this week.

331
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:07,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Miyamoto said the following, "...probably the other thing that we are desperate to realize is the core online business structure."

332
00:27:07,862 --> 00:27:11,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we need to demand customers pay monthly fees to enjoy online activities?

333
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:17,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Or give an online subscription that is free of charge but then offer something extra for people to pay so they get some extra value?

334
00:27:17,868 --> 00:27:21,310
[SPEAKER_09]: With these core business strategies, I think we are less active than we should be.

335
00:27:23,132 --> 00:27:31,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, it had come up in conversation that Nintendo actually wasn't being very proactive with their online strategy because, well, they're not.

336
00:27:32,077 --> 00:27:39,243
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, basically, if you look at what Miyamoto's saying in those quotes, I mean, in my opinion, he basically says Xbox Live and then PlayStation, right?

337
00:27:39,943 --> 00:27:41,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Pay monthly fees to enjoy online activities.

338
00:27:42,005 --> 00:27:42,825
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Xbox Live.

339
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:46,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Or give an online subscription that's free but something extra for people that pay.

340
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:56,976
[SPEAKER_09]: That's PlayStation Network with their free model, but you have, like, the core magazine that has all the little frills in it and some of their other... It's also kind of Xbox Live because you can access it for free.

341
00:27:56,996 --> 00:27:57,296
[SPEAKER_07]: True.

342
00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:57,657
[SPEAKER_07]: True.

343
00:27:58,397 --> 00:28:05,786
[SPEAKER_09]: So, uh, but he, Miyamoto does say, don't forget that there is like a reward program for folks that get their Wii's online if you help others.

344
00:28:06,487 --> 00:28:13,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but he did admit Nintendo has, hasn't been very proactive in developing such online activities as an MMOG.

345
00:28:14,898 --> 00:28:15,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

346
00:28:15,178 --> 00:28:15,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

347
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:16,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

348
00:28:16,532 --> 00:28:21,475
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the door is still wide open, I think, to make a real Animal Crossing online game.

349
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:24,317
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say the door is still open to that.

350
00:28:24,437 --> 00:28:31,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a rehashed frickin' original Animal Crossing game with online elements as the DS and Wii ones were.

351
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,602
[SPEAKER_09]: You could still make a full-fledged MMO for Animal Crossing.

352
00:28:33,982 --> 00:28:37,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, Pokemon, I think, would lend itself to an MMO very well.

353
00:28:38,244 --> 00:28:41,406
[SPEAKER_09]: But could we perhaps see something at E3 this year?

354
00:28:42,186 --> 00:28:43,407
[SPEAKER_09]: I would guess probably not.

355
00:28:44,502 --> 00:28:48,186
[SPEAKER_07]: They're never going to embrace online, at least not with this console.

356
00:28:48,887 --> 00:28:50,729
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say probably not with this console either.

357
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:55,355
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's going to happen with the Wii, but I think it's something you've got to see in their next console.

358
00:28:55,395 --> 00:28:55,916
[SPEAKER_07]: They have to.

359
00:28:56,196 --> 00:29:01,823
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no... Because they're basically saying, oh, people don't really care about online.

360
00:29:01,963 --> 00:29:03,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's not true.

361
00:29:04,085 --> 00:29:07,168
[SPEAKER_09]: and then you see 11 million subscribers of World of Warcraft.

362
00:29:07,368 --> 00:29:10,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Or all the people on Facebook and stuff.

363
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,071
[SPEAKER_07]: That's still online.

364
00:29:12,532 --> 00:29:12,932
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true.

365
00:29:12,972 --> 00:29:16,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm surprised Nintendo doesn't try to do something with Facebook because a lot of it's the same audience.

366
00:29:17,195 --> 00:29:17,696
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

367
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:19,677
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, wasn't there something...

368
00:29:22,043 --> 00:29:23,284
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking of something.

369
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:25,565
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I think you're thinking of the parody stuff with Mario.

370
00:29:25,645 --> 00:29:26,506
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, no.

371
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:29,307
[SPEAKER_09]: I know there was that, but there was something else I was thinking of.

372
00:29:29,327 --> 00:29:34,550
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought there actually was something with this whole get your friends on the Wii that's somehow tied into Facebook, but I could be wrong.

373
00:29:35,831 --> 00:29:36,231
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine.

374
00:29:36,732 --> 00:29:37,472
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm wrong sometimes.

375
00:29:37,612 --> 00:29:37,952
[SPEAKER_09]: It happens.

376
00:29:39,093 --> 00:29:45,677
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see what happens with Nintendo in the future and their online presence, but I would say don't get your hopes up, at least with this generation.

377
00:29:46,157 --> 00:29:51,321
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to probably hype it up for whatever console is coming next and make it sound like it's new.

378
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Like all these things are just new ideas that have never been done before.

379
00:29:54,703 --> 00:29:55,083
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

380
00:29:55,303 --> 00:30:04,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and real quick, since we're on the topic of Nintendo and being that we did sort of like a sort of secret club a few weeks ago,

381
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:06,330
[SPEAKER_07]: I have something to tie in with that.

382
00:30:06,531 --> 00:30:06,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, really?

383
00:30:06,951 --> 00:30:10,615
[SPEAKER_07]: It hasn't quite made it out there yet, but we'll be out there soon enough.

384
00:30:10,855 --> 00:30:11,316
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

385
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:11,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

386
00:30:12,257 --> 00:30:14,540
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish I knew I would have brought up the Secret Club theme music.

387
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,901
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's all right.

388
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:17,002
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really stupid.

389
00:30:17,263 --> 00:30:18,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember Secret Club?

390
00:30:18,544 --> 00:30:19,165
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't hear it here.

391
00:30:20,327 --> 00:30:33,338
[SPEAKER_07]: So, as you may remember, it was confirmed that today, actually, that the black Wii system bundle with Wii Sports Resort and Wii Motion Plus and all the Wii Sports that came out for the same price.

392
00:30:33,938 --> 00:30:37,081
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, great.

393
00:30:39,002 --> 00:30:41,004
[SPEAKER_07]: What they didn't mention is it's also coming out in white.

394
00:30:42,671 --> 00:30:43,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's stupid.

395
00:30:43,472 --> 00:30:43,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

396
00:30:43,912 --> 00:30:44,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

397
00:30:44,693 --> 00:30:45,393
[SPEAKER_07]: I see exactly.

398
00:30:45,673 --> 00:30:46,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

399
00:30:46,674 --> 00:30:52,018
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's good to know that the White Whees aren't going away or they're not going to be collector's items or anything.

400
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:58,363
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically going to be... They're just going to do this for... I don't know how long.

401
00:30:58,383 --> 00:30:59,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it is limited.

402
00:30:59,263 --> 00:31:00,805
[SPEAKER_07]: It says on the box, limited edition.

403
00:31:00,885 --> 00:31:04,747
[SPEAKER_07]: But that might be just like, buy this, please.

404
00:31:05,588 --> 00:31:06,249
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know.

405
00:31:07,149 --> 00:31:15,836
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically you will be able to pick when you go to the store if you want to make a Wii and you'll have a big decision to make and that would be do you want it black or white?

406
00:31:33,673 --> 00:31:35,815
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's the question shoppers everywhere are going to ask themselves.

407
00:31:36,215 --> 00:31:36,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Black or white?

408
00:31:37,356 --> 00:31:37,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

409
00:31:38,877 --> 00:31:39,357
[SPEAKER_09]: I am a dork.

410
00:31:39,637 --> 00:31:40,878
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, what's up next?

411
00:31:41,979 --> 00:31:52,547
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Nintendo has sent out a little plug for something that's supposed to happen for June 16th, which is right during E3.

412
00:31:53,407 --> 00:32:00,833
[SPEAKER_15]: The official Nintendo magazine is going to have a world exclusive in issue 57, which is something, but the

413
00:32:01,613 --> 00:32:05,837
[SPEAKER_15]: The quote goes, you may want to mark Wednesday, 16th, June in your diary.

414
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:13,323
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be revealing world exclusive details on a top secret new game in the next issue of O&M.

415
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:15,605
[SPEAKER_07]: How do they know I have a diary?

416
00:32:16,741 --> 00:32:24,224
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that, given the way that the date's listed and diary, I would suspect that it's European information.

417
00:32:25,524 --> 00:32:25,784
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

418
00:32:27,465 --> 00:32:33,967
[SPEAKER_15]: But, maybe it's an excuse to try to get people to go out and buy more official Nintendo magazine.

419
00:32:35,207 --> 00:32:38,888
[SPEAKER_15]: All they have to do is say, Howard and Nestor, back for real, forever.

420
00:32:38,988 --> 00:32:39,628
[SPEAKER_07]: How about this?

421
00:32:39,748 --> 00:32:43,089
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's like, why don't you just wait to see what's at E3?

422
00:32:43,109 --> 00:32:45,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I can guarantee whatever's at E3 is going to be there.

423
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's coming out during E3, right?

424
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:47,571
[SPEAKER_07]: June 16th?

425
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:48,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, not everyone gets to go.

426
00:32:48,771 --> 00:32:50,171
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like the Wednesday of E3.

427
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:54,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but everybody that we know has internet access.

428
00:32:54,693 --> 00:33:02,275
[SPEAKER_15]: And if it's the June issue, typically the issues for one month for subscribers come out a month earlier.

429
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,381
[SPEAKER_09]: This could be a timed thing though.

430
00:33:06,462 --> 00:33:08,043
[SPEAKER_09]: It could still be like the July issue.

431
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:08,663
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

432
00:33:08,783 --> 00:33:09,724
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be timed.

433
00:33:09,924 --> 00:33:13,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially if it's sensitive information that is going to be blown at the E3 press conference.

434
00:33:14,407 --> 00:33:18,509
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to make sure they don't leave headquarters until the game.

435
00:33:18,589 --> 00:33:19,570
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all it is.

436
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,432
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be the Nintendo money printer.

437
00:33:23,496 --> 00:33:26,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Hinting that they're going to be doing a new Zelda game.

438
00:33:26,499 --> 00:33:27,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, new Zelda game.

439
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Xlink in our chatroom says, it's Earthbound.

440
00:33:30,202 --> 00:33:30,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

441
00:33:30,822 --> 00:33:34,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what if it's Kid Icarus?

442
00:33:34,565 --> 00:33:35,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Jizz to my pants.

443
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, you know, to be fair, I mean, I know, Loki, you're sitting over there going, it's Zelda, big fucking deal.

444
00:33:42,123 --> 00:33:51,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, one of the best games to come out last year, if not the best game to come out last year, was a blindside by Nintendo at E3 that nobody saw coming.

445
00:33:52,209 --> 00:33:53,570
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was New Super Mario Bros.

446
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:53,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Wii.

447
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, there was no news on that before E3.

448
00:33:56,331 --> 00:33:56,752
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

449
00:33:57,032 --> 00:34:02,277
[SPEAKER_07]: I never saw them rehashing something that was on another system and re-releasing it for another system.

450
00:34:02,298 --> 00:34:02,938
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what though, Loki?

451
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,980
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so unlike Nintendo.

452
00:34:05,061 --> 00:34:08,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Your cynicism aside, it really was one of the best games to come out last year.

453
00:34:08,404 --> 00:34:09,285
[SPEAKER_09]: If not the best.

454
00:34:09,345 --> 00:34:10,887
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, last year was not like an A-plus last year.

455
00:34:10,907 --> 00:34:12,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you know why it sold a lot?

456
00:34:12,408 --> 00:34:16,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Because people that buy the Wii eat up anything that comes out this month.

457
00:34:17,413 --> 00:34:18,474
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good game.

458
00:34:18,994 --> 00:34:20,135
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a platform game.

459
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:26,259
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very accessible to those that played the old Mario on the Nintendo NES.

460
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:27,239
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a great game.

461
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,860
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand it.

462
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:37,986
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a Mario game and it'll do really well just like Super Mario Galaxy 2 will do really well because it's a Mario game because people buy Mario and Zelda and Pokemon.

463
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:46,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if they came out with an awesome Metroid game, and yes, I know Metroid Other M is right around the corner.

464
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:51,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me tell you something, Metroid Other M is going to sell as well as Mario.

465
00:34:51,355 --> 00:35:03,498
[SPEAKER_07]: If they dressed up Mario in the Samus suit and had him going fighting Bowser and stuff with a blaster and he can turn into a ball and shoot bombs and stuff like that, it would sell a billion copies because people eat up Mario.

466
00:35:03,558 --> 00:35:06,339
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like Apple and their iPods.

467
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,822
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually am going to go out on a limb, and I could be dead wrong.

468
00:35:11,262 --> 00:35:14,645
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think Mario Galaxy 2 is going to sell as great as everyone thinks it is.

469
00:35:14,825 --> 00:35:15,345
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not.

470
00:35:15,406 --> 00:35:20,730
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's going to be this kind of like just general rejection of the game.

471
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:32,038
[SPEAKER_09]: What I think is interesting, and I don't think it's on our show roll tonight, but I heard something about they were releasing Mario Galaxy 2, not in America, but in other countries, Japan and Europe, with a DVD.

472
00:35:32,058 --> 00:35:32,139
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

473
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,360
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

474
00:35:53,482 --> 00:35:54,522
[SPEAKER_07]: But it doesn't matter.

475
00:35:54,722 --> 00:35:56,643
[SPEAKER_07]: The system doesn't play DVDs.

476
00:35:57,303 --> 00:35:57,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares?

477
00:35:58,264 --> 00:36:03,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, they could include the videos on the actual disc, but so what?

478
00:36:04,446 --> 00:36:11,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you remember, Mario Galaxy was the first dual-layer DVD game from Nintendo.

479
00:36:12,608 --> 00:36:13,389
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was a good game.

480
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:19,472
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not bagging on Mario Galaxy and I'm not trying to say that Mario Galaxy 2 won't sell well because it's a bad game by any means.

481
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:19,713
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

482
00:36:19,953 --> 00:36:21,674
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think... I don't know.

483
00:36:21,734 --> 00:36:26,237
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you're going to really see a difference between how a game like New Super Mario Bros.

484
00:36:26,277 --> 00:36:27,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Wii and that will be received.

485
00:36:28,098 --> 00:36:28,498
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

486
00:36:28,518 --> 00:36:31,720
[SPEAKER_07]: The only reason I'm saying that it's just...

487
00:36:33,337 --> 00:36:36,098
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have high expectations for Nintendo.

488
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:39,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, great, New Super Mario Bros.

489
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,360
[SPEAKER_07]: did well.

490
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,060
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

491
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,601
[SPEAKER_07]: If it was a different Mario Bros.

492
00:36:42,641 --> 00:36:43,782
[SPEAKER_07]: game, it was still done well.

493
00:36:43,842 --> 00:36:48,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Mario game during the fourth quarter, during holiday season, it's going to be on everyone's shopping list.

494
00:36:49,444 --> 00:36:50,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course it's going to do well.

495
00:36:51,025 --> 00:36:51,785
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not a surprise.

496
00:36:52,025 --> 00:36:55,907
[SPEAKER_07]: But the thing is, Nintendo doesn't really do anything to surprise us.

497
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:59,248
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, their latest announcement that was this week.

498
00:36:59,428 --> 00:37:00,949
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just like, really?

499
00:37:01,709 --> 00:37:02,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

500
00:37:02,529 --> 00:37:08,772
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there wasn't enough party games on the Wii that you needed Me Party or Wii Party?

501
00:37:08,872 --> 00:37:09,712
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, really?

502
00:37:10,452 --> 00:37:11,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Wii Party?

503
00:37:13,533 --> 00:37:14,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that necessary?

504
00:37:16,414 --> 00:37:18,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Where am I going to get a good party game on the Wii?

505
00:37:18,735 --> 00:37:19,075
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

506
00:37:19,115 --> 00:37:20,216
[SPEAKER_07]: There's just none out there.

507
00:37:20,396 --> 00:37:20,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Ever.

508
00:37:21,596 --> 00:37:21,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Ever.

509
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:25,558
[SPEAKER_09]: If that's what people are going to buy...

510
00:37:27,543 --> 00:37:35,753
[SPEAKER_07]: But just like, you know, don't try to pretend, Nintendo, that you're going to just come out with some sort of amazing product that's just going to blow us all away.

511
00:37:36,173 --> 00:37:40,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'll tell you what, it's just going to be a port of something, or it's going to be another Mario or Zelda game.

512
00:37:42,077 --> 00:38:07,590
[SPEAKER_07]: All it really is And those Mario and Zelda games I bet you anything the new Zelda game Probably going to be exactly like the last Zelda game As far as engine goes Just new levels and stuff Maybe a few little Link is going to turn into a duck this time I don't know, something different It's just Duck Link Zelda 2 The Adventures of Quack

513
00:38:08,826 --> 00:38:10,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft says they'll probably publish President Cat No

514
00:38:29,162 --> 00:38:31,564
[SPEAKER_09]: No, President Cat's not going to happen, sadly.

515
00:38:32,485 --> 00:38:33,005
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish it would.

516
00:38:33,045 --> 00:38:34,126
[SPEAKER_09]: You all know how I feel about it.

517
00:38:35,307 --> 00:38:39,931
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's still my dream that it'll be the big... Maybe that's the big surprise reveal at E3.

518
00:38:40,472 --> 00:38:41,273
[SPEAKER_09]: President Cat.

519
00:38:42,894 --> 00:38:44,215
[SPEAKER_09]: When is this cat coming on stage?

520
00:38:44,495 --> 00:38:46,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy shit.

521
00:38:46,797 --> 00:38:49,960
[SPEAKER_09]: I probably won't get invited to the Nintendo press conference, but that's okay.

522
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:50,921
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't matter.

523
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:52,142
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll hear you yelling.

524
00:38:52,402 --> 00:38:54,584
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll hear me yelling from wherever I am.

525
00:38:54,684 --> 00:38:55,665
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell?

526
00:38:57,677 --> 00:38:58,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

527
00:38:58,998 --> 00:39:00,158
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys really did that?

528
00:39:00,779 --> 00:39:01,579
[SPEAKER_09]: You really did it?

529
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, shit.

530
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this real life?

531
00:39:06,581 --> 00:39:08,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, let's move on, Loki.

532
00:39:08,422 --> 00:39:09,683
[SPEAKER_07]: President Cat will never happen.

533
00:39:12,566 --> 00:39:15,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so, other stuff we can talk about Nintendo.

534
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:24,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, they're going to want to step up their anti-piracy measures for the 3DS, seeing as it's running rampant with the DS and the DSi.

535
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:29,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though, oh yeah, we changed some stuff to the DSi to make it harder to pirate, but yeah, that was defeated within...

536
00:39:30,906 --> 00:39:32,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Little time whatsoever.

537
00:39:32,186 --> 00:39:36,428
[SPEAKER_07]: But apparently they hate piracy.

538
00:39:36,508 --> 00:39:36,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

539
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:37,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God.

540
00:39:38,348 --> 00:39:49,111
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course now that six years with the system being out, they want to find ways to stop the piracy.

541
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:53,372
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, we have a strong sense of the crisis about this problem.

542
00:39:56,024 --> 00:39:57,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Which doesn't really say what they're going to do.

543
00:39:59,527 --> 00:40:00,908
[SPEAKER_09]: We're aware of the problem.

544
00:40:01,968 --> 00:40:02,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Good.

545
00:40:03,429 --> 00:40:07,112
[SPEAKER_09]: No shit, because you sued the companies that were doing the chips and stuff, right?

546
00:40:07,132 --> 00:40:08,413
[SPEAKER_09]: They went after all these people.

547
00:40:08,953 --> 00:40:10,515
[SPEAKER_09]: So no shit you're aware of the problem.

548
00:40:11,624 --> 00:40:14,165
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you going to make that perfect anti-piracy?

549
00:40:14,205 --> 00:40:15,985
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, doesn't Sony say this all the time?

550
00:40:16,406 --> 00:40:19,807
[SPEAKER_09]: We have made our next console unhackable.

551
00:40:21,047 --> 00:40:22,408
[SPEAKER_09]: 48 hours later, LOL hack.

552
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:23,568
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to tell you right now.

553
00:40:24,428 --> 00:40:36,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless the system has downloadable firmware updates that they can do, something like that, the fact that these games are on a cartridge, there's no way that they're going to be able to stop piracy.

554
00:40:36,712 --> 00:40:38,573
[SPEAKER_07]: It will get broken quickly.

555
00:40:38,613 --> 00:40:38,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Quickly.

556
00:40:41,124 --> 00:40:41,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Bold statement.

557
00:40:42,985 --> 00:40:44,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's look at the past history now.

558
00:40:47,288 --> 00:40:49,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, the only system that's been hard to crack is the PS3.

559
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:55,233
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just because Blu-ray has it really, you know, it's somewhat a new technology.

560
00:40:55,674 --> 00:40:56,614
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not necessarily that.

561
00:40:56,634 --> 00:40:58,075
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just they have good encryption and stuff.

562
00:40:58,115 --> 00:41:02,018
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's just, look at the Nintendo systems.

563
00:41:02,058 --> 00:41:03,999
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the DS, the Game Boy Advance.

564
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,560
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll happen.

565
00:41:07,105 --> 00:41:17,379
[SPEAKER_07]: and especially since I'm assuming this system is going to have some of the technology that's in the DS because it is going to be backwards compatible.

566
00:41:18,821 --> 00:41:21,825
[SPEAKER_07]: So it probably won't be that difficult.

567
00:41:23,396 --> 00:41:25,157
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm planning on picking one up because I think it's going to be neat.

568
00:41:26,098 --> 00:41:28,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

569
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's move on to talk about some other news.

570
00:41:30,982 --> 00:41:34,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, wait, I've got to read these A-plus comments from chat because there was some hilarious stuff.

571
00:41:34,385 --> 00:41:44,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Going back to the whole duck Link thing, Stan in our chat room, A-plus comment, Link turns into a donkey and the next game will be called The Legend of Zelda, Zelda's Tijuana Donkey Show.

572
00:41:46,474 --> 00:41:47,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that's a game I'd play.

573
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:47,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

574
00:41:50,222 --> 00:42:05,632
[SPEAKER_09]: or Link turns into a wolf gets captured by Bob Barker and then neutered LittleBigPlanet 2 is going to be coming out that's right, it's real, it's actually happening we've had a few leaks and remember the guy a couple weeks ago whose song was confirmed to be in the game, etc, etc

575
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:12,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, apparently Game Informer has said it is coming and we're going to show off more information in our June issue of Game Informer.

576
00:42:13,298 --> 00:42:14,979
[SPEAKER_09]: So, what exactly is going on?

577
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:16,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, some of the little details have leaked.

578
00:42:16,841 --> 00:42:18,362
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a whole new game.

579
00:42:19,563 --> 00:42:21,585
[SPEAKER_09]: This is coming from the NeoGAF forums.

580
00:42:21,685 --> 00:42:31,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, Media Molecule is making tools that will allow you to do racing games, space invader shooters, puzzle games, role-playing games, and strategy games.

581
00:42:31,733 --> 00:42:32,453
[SPEAKER_09]: They are just...

582
00:42:33,314 --> 00:42:36,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Making this engine, it's not just for side-scrollers now.

583
00:42:36,736 --> 00:42:37,756
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the big difference here.

584
00:42:37,816 --> 00:42:44,259
[SPEAKER_07]: And the thing I heard, I thought, was the stuff from LittleBigPlanet 1, I think you're going to be able to bring into LittleBigPlanet 2.

585
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:49,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently a media molecule developer made a Command & Conquer clone in the game.

586
00:42:50,522 --> 00:42:57,606
[SPEAKER_07]: And they also were saying that they were able to, now you can really have good control over the cameras and stuff like that, the physics.

587
00:42:57,906 --> 00:43:00,267
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to be able to create and edit short films.

588
00:43:00,487 --> 00:43:02,428
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is going to be Mashima Heaven, apparently.

589
00:43:03,369 --> 00:43:05,990
[SPEAKER_09]: You will be able to record your own sound effects.

590
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,511
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even know how that works, but that's what they're promising.

591
00:43:08,972 --> 00:43:12,914
[SPEAKER_09]: You will be able to move the game's camera around to make your own cut scenes using Sack Boys.

592
00:43:13,474 --> 00:43:15,855
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and, and, the Sack Bot.

593
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:19,177
[SPEAKER_09]: A fully customizable, programmable enemy unit.

594
00:43:20,358 --> 00:43:22,301
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can control it yourself.

595
00:43:23,683 --> 00:43:25,425
[SPEAKER_09]: I almost think this is going to be too much.

596
00:43:25,626 --> 00:43:27,709
[SPEAKER_09]: It is going to be epic.

597
00:43:27,969 --> 00:43:34,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Part of what made LittleBigPlanet so cool was that it was relatively easy to make your own levels, but there was still... It wasn't...

598
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,141
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't easy to make a good level.

599
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:37,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me put it this way.

600
00:43:37,862 --> 00:43:38,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me put it that way.

601
00:43:38,722 --> 00:43:43,606
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard with... The problem you run into when you can do that is it's like you don't know where to begin.

602
00:43:44,207 --> 00:43:46,108
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like all these options.

603
00:43:46,148 --> 00:43:47,469
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't know how to kind of focus it.

604
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:50,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas if you're limited somewhat, it's a little bit easier.

605
00:43:50,131 --> 00:43:52,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I got to make a side-scrolling game, so here's this.

606
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:58,938
[SPEAKER_07]: But people that want to expand beyond that to make like the space shooters and stuff, they're limited by what they can do.

607
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:09,022
[SPEAKER_07]: So this, I think, since you're going to have full control over the camera and stuff, you're going to see a lot of maybe even top-down games and whatever, but it's just going to be nuts.

608
00:44:09,342 --> 00:44:14,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Alpha Cananogram wants to jump in there and try to correct me, saying the PlayStation Eye has a microphone.

609
00:44:15,484 --> 00:44:24,492
[SPEAKER_09]: That, okay, so you'll be able to make your own sound effects, but, I mean, what are you going to be able to make with a microphone on a camera besides, like, you know, fart noises and, you know, just, like, random screaming?

610
00:44:24,672 --> 00:44:26,734
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be cool if you could import WAV files in MP3s.

611
00:44:26,754 --> 00:44:27,815
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be awesome.

612
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Make your own background music?

613
00:44:29,317 --> 00:44:29,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

614
00:44:30,157 --> 00:44:33,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, that also opens the door to, like, rampant piracy.

615
00:44:34,982 --> 00:44:35,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Like...

616
00:44:35,602 --> 00:44:52,353
[SPEAKER_09]: soon not only will you be able to listen to Lady Gaga leaks and whatever else is leaking on the internet that whole iLeaks thing not only will you be able to do that on YouTube but you'll be able to go into LittleBigPlanet and listen to new songs because people will bring MP3s over it's great

617
00:44:54,574 --> 00:44:56,355
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, this sounds pretty awesome.

618
00:44:56,395 --> 00:45:01,217
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, there are some other little things trickling out about there.

619
00:45:02,517 --> 00:45:06,519
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a more robust game that is not just side-scrollers.

620
00:45:07,259 --> 00:45:09,920
[SPEAKER_09]: And this kind of catches me by surprise, because I thought...

621
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,381
[SPEAKER_09]: LittleBigPlanet 2

622
00:45:30,621 --> 00:45:31,302
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds epic.

623
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Erasing games?

624
00:45:34,123 --> 00:45:37,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Direct competition with... Themselves, almost.

625
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:37,766
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so weird.

626
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:41,208
[SPEAKER_09]: RPG Maker.

627
00:45:41,388 --> 00:45:42,529
[SPEAKER_09]: You used to love that.

628
00:45:42,769 --> 00:45:44,170
[SPEAKER_09]: You used to love the RPG Maker series.

629
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:46,572
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a lot to do, though, with RPG Maker.

630
00:45:46,592 --> 00:45:48,673
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the problem.

631
00:45:49,534 --> 00:45:59,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to create an RPG or something, it's just a lot of work with trying to create the storyline and all the different AI and sequences and stuff.

632
00:46:01,501 --> 00:46:02,482
[SPEAKER_07]: It gets too difficult.

633
00:46:02,702 --> 00:46:11,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I think the most work that I did on an actual RPG or adventure game or something was actually, like, in MegaZooks.

634
00:46:11,945 --> 00:46:13,386
[SPEAKER_07]: You remember the ZZT sequel?

635
00:46:13,486 --> 00:46:13,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes.

636
00:46:14,106 --> 00:46:21,529
[SPEAKER_07]: And the only reason why is because it was pretty much, you know, you can draw your levels, place your enemies and stuff, and you don't really do a lot of programming.

637
00:46:21,889 --> 00:46:26,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I did have some boss characters and stuff like that, like a barrier that you can kill with grenades.

638
00:46:26,531 --> 00:46:28,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Little big planet three, ZZT.

639
00:46:29,232 --> 00:46:31,293
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, that was awesome.

640
00:46:32,474 --> 00:46:36,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, now that's something that they need to bring to, like, a console or something.

641
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,819
[SPEAKER_09]: One of these weeks, we really need to highlight that as a classic game of the week.

642
00:46:39,859 --> 00:46:44,441
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that's not really DarkSakura's alley, but if she's ever gone in the future, we gotta do ZZT.

643
00:46:45,022 --> 00:46:47,884
[SPEAKER_09]: I could do a whole episode about how much I love ZZT.

644
00:46:49,365 --> 00:46:50,025
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a great game.

645
00:46:51,709 --> 00:46:55,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Create an OLR game in the ZZT contest or something like that.

646
00:46:55,572 --> 00:47:01,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually, TigerClaw in our chatroom talking about this whole LittleBigPlanet2 says, Somebody can make a level with clips from OLR.

647
00:47:01,597 --> 00:47:02,978
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a little scared of what that might bring.

648
00:47:03,258 --> 00:47:04,239
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, I thought this was neat, too.

649
00:47:04,259 --> 00:47:08,542
[SPEAKER_09]: They're also talking about PlayStation Eye integration for loading levels using QR codes.

650
00:47:08,582 --> 00:47:11,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Are those like those barcodes that are meant for cell phones and stuff?

651
00:47:11,465 --> 00:47:11,945
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

652
00:47:12,025 --> 00:47:15,128
[SPEAKER_09]: So you'll be able to bring in levels just by holding up a little thing to your camera.

653
00:47:15,828 --> 00:47:16,448
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

654
00:47:16,468 --> 00:47:17,669
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds like the e-reader.

655
00:47:18,349 --> 00:47:18,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember that?

656
00:47:19,489 --> 00:47:19,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

657
00:47:19,789 --> 00:47:22,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Where they would put full Nintendo games on like five little cards.

658
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:23,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember that?

659
00:47:23,791 --> 00:47:26,612
[SPEAKER_09]: That was awesome.

660
00:47:26,972 --> 00:47:27,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, lots of stuff.

661
00:47:27,892 --> 00:47:32,113
[SPEAKER_09]: And oh my gosh, just so much.

662
00:47:32,173 --> 00:47:35,815
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some spoilers of levels that are out there.

663
00:47:35,855 --> 00:47:42,977
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I shouldn't give you too many spoilers, but they are talking about a tribute level to all these old arcade classics.

664
00:47:45,771 --> 00:47:47,352
[SPEAKER_09]: More information at E3, I'm sure.

665
00:47:47,673 --> 00:47:50,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, I wonder if it'll be playable on the show floor.

666
00:47:50,475 --> 00:47:51,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Excited.

667
00:47:52,577 --> 00:47:54,198
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll definitely be part of their press conference.

668
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:55,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

669
00:47:55,779 --> 00:47:58,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Weren't they supposed to be having two press conferences, or was that Microsoft?

670
00:47:58,482 --> 00:47:59,162
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Microsoft.

671
00:47:59,242 --> 00:48:01,204
[SPEAKER_09]: It's doing one just about Natal, I believe.

672
00:48:01,484 --> 00:48:04,206
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if that's like a media night or what that's all about.

673
00:48:04,987 --> 00:48:05,347
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

674
00:48:05,908 --> 00:48:07,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Dark Sakura, what you got for us?

675
00:48:07,938 --> 00:48:08,839
[SPEAKER_15]: More stuff, Rob.

676
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:09,800
[SPEAKER_15]: More stuff.

677
00:48:10,501 --> 00:48:12,383
[SPEAKER_15]: In fact, more Nintendo.

678
00:48:13,284 --> 00:48:18,189
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is actually specifically about Sin and Punishment, Successor of the Skies.

679
00:48:21,432 --> 00:48:25,636
[SPEAKER_15]: The European box art has a reversible cover.

680
00:48:26,477 --> 00:48:53,779
[SPEAKER_15]: so you can actually put have the Japanese box art on it it's not going to look exactly like the Japanese box art because the big logo is not up at the top side of it it's on the bottom but it is the Japanese artwork and I was looking at the European box art yeah and it's just it's not bad but it's not as really good as the Japanese one

681
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:57,922
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that it's actually... I mean, it's not bad.

682
00:48:58,443 --> 00:49:00,704
[SPEAKER_15]: But the Japanese art is just really fantastic.

683
00:49:01,425 --> 00:49:03,847
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a really gorgeous piece of artwork.

684
00:49:05,608 --> 00:49:06,709
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd say that's a treat.

685
00:49:06,929 --> 00:49:10,211
[SPEAKER_15]: I like it when you get fun little reversible things.

686
00:49:10,731 --> 00:49:13,453
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, it was cool when Capcom did the Okami.

687
00:49:14,494 --> 00:49:15,315
[SPEAKER_15]: And I ordered mine.

688
00:49:16,095 --> 00:49:17,756
[SPEAKER_09]: That I got five months later.

689
00:49:18,017 --> 00:49:20,538
[SPEAKER_09]: When you can print your own and put them in there.

690
00:49:20,578 --> 00:49:22,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody did one for Wii Sports.

691
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:23,921
[SPEAKER_09]: It was kind of fan-made.

692
00:49:24,531 --> 00:49:30,973
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to see a lot of those Photoshop contests too that do like the retro style book covers but out of video games.

693
00:49:31,393 --> 00:49:32,874
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been some very creative ones.

694
00:49:32,934 --> 00:49:36,495
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to just kind of film up my gaming library with the alternative covers.

695
00:49:36,535 --> 00:49:37,255
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would be cool.

696
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:41,437
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to link this image though to the chat room because I think they'd really like to see it.

697
00:49:41,517 --> 00:49:41,777
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope.

698
00:49:42,717 --> 00:49:43,278
[SPEAKER_15]: If not, too bad.

699
00:49:43,298 --> 00:49:43,998
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm linking it anyway.

700
00:49:45,078 --> 00:49:48,122
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to our chatroom, chat.orangeloundtrader.com.

701
00:49:48,162 --> 00:49:50,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Stan is asking, wasn't there already a Nintendo cereal?

702
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:53,347
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure it was a Mario cereal or a Zelda cereal.

703
00:49:53,427 --> 00:49:54,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, it was both.

704
00:49:54,889 --> 00:49:58,232
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was in response to a comment Actdeft had said, what's next, Nintendo cereal?

705
00:49:58,252 --> 00:49:59,674
[SPEAKER_15]: It was the Nintendo breakfast system.

706
00:49:59,794 --> 00:50:00,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the Nintendo breakfast system.

707
00:50:02,056 --> 00:50:04,098
[SPEAKER_09]: And it had a little theme song.

708
00:50:04,138 --> 00:50:05,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it had both, right?

709
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,241
[SPEAKER_15]: It's for breakfast now.

710
00:50:07,762 --> 00:50:10,925
[SPEAKER_09]: It had both the Mario and Zelda, right?

711
00:50:11,025 --> 00:50:15,529
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it was split in the center like those logos for the two game cartridges.

712
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:16,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Here, hold on.

713
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:17,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.

714
00:50:18,852 --> 00:50:20,553
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to take me way back, y'all.

715
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:21,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Way back, y'all.

716
00:50:22,355 --> 00:50:23,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Before some of you were born.

717
00:50:29,184 --> 00:50:29,784
[SPEAKER_15]: It's too low.

718
00:50:29,824 --> 00:50:30,405
[SPEAKER_09]: It's too low.

719
00:50:30,445 --> 00:50:31,365
[SPEAKER_09]: They probably can't hear that in chat.

720
00:50:31,385 --> 00:50:31,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

721
00:50:31,625 --> 00:50:33,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me try another one here.

722
00:50:33,966 --> 00:50:35,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's try this one.

723
00:50:51,874 --> 00:50:52,855
[SPEAKER_15]: A Fruit Flavored Crunch Fruit Loops

724
00:51:13,026 --> 00:51:14,828
[SPEAKER_15]: I couldn't get over just how awful it smelled.

725
00:51:14,868 --> 00:51:17,352
[SPEAKER_15]: But then again, my favorite cereal when I was a child was Grape Nuts.

726
00:51:19,455 --> 00:51:20,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on.

727
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:22,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Release dates and see what's coming out around the world.

728
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:25,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Sadly, no new Nintendo cereal, but at least some video games coming out, hopefully.

729
00:51:26,758 --> 00:51:29,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, video games definitely on their way out this week.

730
00:51:30,382 --> 00:51:31,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, some pretty decent stuff.

731
00:51:32,724 --> 00:51:36,387
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got some big game releases starting off with Lost Planet 2.

732
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:40,972
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be making its way out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

733
00:51:41,452 --> 00:51:43,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Sad, though, I was reading the reviews on it, man.

734
00:51:43,294 --> 00:51:44,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Just some real...

735
00:51:46,463 --> 00:51:50,164
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, just okay reviews, not kind of gloating over the whole thing.

736
00:51:51,544 --> 00:51:52,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.

737
00:51:52,665 --> 00:51:54,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's too bad.

738
00:51:54,925 --> 00:52:01,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Dance Sensation, Majesco's, I guess, version of Let's Just Dance, except not as good.

739
00:52:01,947 --> 00:52:04,048
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be coming its way on the Wii.

740
00:52:04,668 --> 00:52:08,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Skate 3, coming out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this week.

741
00:52:08,491 --> 00:52:12,673
[SPEAKER_07]: A game I'm probably going to pick up, 3D Game Heroes, coming out on PlayStation 3.

742
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:14,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, you'll have to tell me if that's worth getting.

743
00:52:14,775 --> 00:52:16,516
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really curious about that game.

744
00:52:16,536 --> 00:52:17,857
[SPEAKER_09]: The reviews have been excellent.

745
00:52:18,037 --> 00:52:18,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

746
00:52:18,357 --> 00:52:19,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent reviews.

747
00:52:19,418 --> 00:52:21,439
[SPEAKER_07]: So I am definitely picking that up.

748
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,723
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's really a dilemma for me because that means I'm going to have to update my firmware on my PS3.

749
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:31,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, were you trying to hold off on the whole Linux thing?

750
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I was.

751
00:52:32,681 --> 00:52:33,962
[SPEAKER_09]: When do you ever use Linux?

752
00:52:34,302 --> 00:52:34,902
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter.

753
00:52:35,022 --> 00:52:36,763
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not Linux that I'm interested in.

754
00:52:37,764 --> 00:52:38,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I see.

755
00:52:40,345 --> 00:52:44,487
[SPEAKER_07]: The expansion for Age of Conan, Rise of the Godslayer, coming out on PC this week.

756
00:52:45,368 --> 00:52:49,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3, coming out on PSP.

757
00:52:51,765 --> 00:52:57,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Batman Arkham Asylum Game of the Year Edition in 3D coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

758
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:13,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, also, of course, the real overpriced Xbox 360 USB flash drives will be coming out this week.

759
00:53:14,051 --> 00:53:15,273
[SPEAKER_07]: 8GB and 16GB.

760
00:53:15,914 --> 00:53:17,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, just go buy a third-party one.

761
00:53:17,616 --> 00:53:18,677
[SPEAKER_07]: It's way cheaper.

762
00:53:19,578 --> 00:53:19,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

763
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,341
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's it.

764
00:53:22,711 --> 00:53:24,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to Japan on the Xbox 360.

765
00:53:24,653 --> 00:53:26,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember last week was a dead week because of the holidays.

766
00:53:27,355 --> 00:53:30,057
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're back in the swing of things this week.

767
00:53:30,217 --> 00:53:32,359
[SPEAKER_09]: 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa comes out this week on the 360.

768
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Also a game on the 360 called Metro 2033.

769
00:53:35,642 --> 00:53:38,024
[SPEAKER_09]: This is coming from THQ.

770
00:53:38,184 --> 00:53:39,885
[SPEAKER_09]: I have not heard a lot about what this game is all about.

771
00:53:39,945 --> 00:53:43,728
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a Russian first-person shooter game, kind of like a post-apocalyptic type thing.

772
00:53:43,849 --> 00:53:44,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, it looks like fun.

773
00:53:44,609 --> 00:53:45,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that coming out over here?

774
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:46,671
[SPEAKER_07]: It came out last month.

775
00:53:46,751 --> 00:53:47,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Or actually it came out in March.

776
00:53:48,032 --> 00:53:48,352
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

777
00:54:14,496 --> 00:54:18,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Going on to the Nintendo Wii, also the FIFA World Cup South Africa game.

778
00:54:18,419 --> 00:54:21,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Other than that, not a whole lot coming out.

779
00:54:21,221 --> 00:54:28,485
[SPEAKER_09]: PlayStation 2 gets Daisen Ryaku, Daitua Kobushi, Tora Tora Tora, where Kishu ni Seku Seri.

780
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:30,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that is the full name of the game.

781
00:54:30,907 --> 00:54:31,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Best version.

782
00:54:31,767 --> 00:54:32,508
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the best hits.

783
00:54:32,828 --> 00:54:41,033
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's probably a price reduction of an existing PS2 game because are any developers really making that many games anymore?

784
00:54:41,053 --> 00:54:41,533
[SPEAKER_09]: PlayStation 2?

785
00:54:41,573 --> 00:54:41,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

786
00:54:42,194 --> 00:54:42,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

787
00:54:42,714 --> 00:54:44,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Very few, but they're still coming.

788
00:54:45,356 --> 00:54:47,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically looks like your Ace Combat clone.

789
00:54:47,777 --> 00:54:49,839
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what you have on the PlayStation 2.

790
00:54:50,379 --> 00:54:55,082
[SPEAKER_09]: And then lastly, looking at the handhelds and the PSP, you also have the World Cup South Africa game.

791
00:54:55,922 --> 00:55:00,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Hakyoki Yugi Roku comes out as well on the DS and the PS.

792
00:55:00,945 --> 00:55:04,468
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, that's just the PSP where that is coming out.

793
00:55:04,848 --> 00:55:06,489
[SPEAKER_09]: I got my handhelds mixed up.

794
00:55:07,109 --> 00:55:09,491
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what the point is there though.

795
00:55:09,531 --> 00:55:11,733
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't say a lot about it.

796
00:55:22,603 --> 00:55:31,185
[SPEAKER_09]: So lastly on the DS, Trick DS Han Kakushi Kami no Sumo-Kan is supposed to come out this week.

797
00:55:31,345 --> 00:55:34,086
[SPEAKER_09]: It's known as Trick, and it's from Konami.

798
00:55:34,686 --> 00:55:37,547
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know if this game's about getting tricks or what.

799
00:55:37,607 --> 00:55:43,828
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I think it's kind of like a survival horror, but one of those slower-paced adventure games.

800
00:55:43,948 --> 00:55:50,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Imagine if something like Ace Attorney was a survival horror game.

801
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:52,511
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what trick kind of looks like to me.

802
00:55:52,751 --> 00:55:54,991
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's ghost trick is what's coming out over here.

803
00:55:55,091 --> 00:55:56,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, okay.

804
00:55:56,612 --> 00:56:01,534
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, and the reason why it looks like the Ace Attorney series, it's the same guy that's doing the artwork for it.

805
00:56:01,654 --> 00:56:03,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Aha, so it's not just coincidence.

806
00:56:03,074 --> 00:56:04,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is coming out over here as ghost trick later on.

807
00:56:05,335 --> 00:56:05,935
[SPEAKER_07]: From Capcom.

808
00:56:06,775 --> 00:56:08,296
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it for Japan, Dark Sakura.

809
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:13,013
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, for Europe, we have a few things.

810
00:56:13,173 --> 00:56:19,957
[SPEAKER_15]: On the 11th, we've got Age of Conan, Rise of the Godslayer, Lost Planet 2 for Xbox 360 and PS3.

811
00:56:20,197 --> 00:56:30,443
[SPEAKER_15]: On the 14th, we have Alan Wake, Naruto Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Skate 3.

812
00:56:31,583 --> 00:56:32,444
[SPEAKER_15]: That's about it.

813
00:56:33,985 --> 00:56:34,405
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

814
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:39,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a couple more news stories for you guys, then we're going to get into the classic game of the week.

815
00:56:40,611 --> 00:56:41,712
[SPEAKER_09]: But for now, some more news.

816
00:56:42,852 --> 00:56:44,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, there was a countdown.

817
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:59,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, apparently if you got the platinum trophy on God of War 3, it gave you a link to a website run by Ready at Dawn teasing a new God of War game.

818
00:56:59,256 --> 00:57:02,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the new God of War game is going to be a PSP exclusive.

819
00:57:02,216 --> 00:57:04,137
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called God of War Ghosts of Sparta.

820
00:57:04,817 --> 00:57:09,298
[SPEAKER_07]: and it is also being developed by Ready at Dawn and looks pretty awesome.

821
00:57:09,438 --> 00:57:11,779
[SPEAKER_07]: No word exactly on when it's going to be coming out.

822
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:14,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably something that will show around at E3.

823
00:57:16,281 --> 00:57:22,822
[SPEAKER_07]: But they were saying that it's going to feature save-the-art visuals and high-quality environments and characters.

824
00:57:22,882 --> 00:57:29,184
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition, the Ghost of Sparta will offer 25% more gameplay than its PSP predecessor.

825
00:57:29,204 --> 00:57:29,184
25%?!

826
00:57:29,925 --> 00:57:31,145
[SPEAKER_07]: That's almost a fourth!

827
00:57:33,877 --> 00:58:02,485
[SPEAKER_07]: and judging by the screenshots though it does look pretty good and I'd say it's actually really good for a PSP game but I remember the God of War game Chains of Olympus looked pretty awesome on the PSP played quite a bit of that one and probably have to check this out I haven't gotten a PSP game in a long time really need to check out LittleBigPlanet 2 on PSP I think that might be cool so I think they had some new levels in that alright

828
00:58:04,039 --> 00:58:05,140
[SPEAKER_15]: He sounds so speculative.

829
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:11,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I had to find my PSP because I have like I have a few PSPs.

830
00:58:11,724 --> 00:58:14,245
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember if I have one that still has an official firmware on it.

831
00:58:14,385 --> 00:58:15,106
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I do.

832
00:58:17,107 --> 00:58:24,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Salacious Pop in chat says the first PSP God of War had A++++ visuals and gameplay but damn was the story milk toast and lame.

833
00:58:26,093 --> 00:58:27,794
[SPEAKER_15]: I like when people can use the word milk toast.

834
00:58:27,994 --> 00:58:31,336
[SPEAKER_09]: I have not heard that used in a sentence in a very long time.

835
00:58:31,556 --> 00:58:35,100
[SPEAKER_15]: The last time I actually saw anything with milk toast in it was reading Bloom County.

836
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:59,782
[SPEAKER_09]: That forum had a little contest, I guess you could say, a little Photoshopping contest about what would Mario look like if it was released today?

837
00:59:00,383 --> 00:59:08,065
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of the results are really funny because you get kind of the achievement unlocked, you know, hey, you got a one-up, five gamerscore.

838
00:59:08,816 --> 00:59:27,414
[SPEAKER_09]: tutorial levels built in you know just kind of like they're doing with the new Mario games my favorite absolutely was the one that made it look like a Facebook game you squashed a Goomba achievement and then it says do you want to post this to your wall you just got an achievement Super Mario Brothers so and so just got the Goomba Squisher achievement and wants everyone to know

839
00:59:28,942 --> 00:59:30,984
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thought that was so on point.

840
00:59:31,545 --> 00:59:32,866
[SPEAKER_09]: So on point.

841
00:59:33,567 --> 00:59:35,709
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if you think about it, that's already there.

842
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,472
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm just as guilty as the next guy.

843
00:59:38,812 --> 00:59:43,677
[SPEAKER_09]: PS3 will post your achievements to your wall.

844
00:59:43,717 --> 00:59:45,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember when everybody was kind of talking about that feature?

845
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:47,000
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm sure some of you blocked it.

846
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:51,865
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, when I unlock trophies in Super Street Fighter, my wall knows about it.

847
00:59:53,226 --> 00:59:55,187
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, except for those of us that blocked him.

848
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:59,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan runs that Raptor thing, and every day I can see he's playing World of Warcraft.

849
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:03,693
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I know if that thing doesn't publish one day, I should probably make sure he's okay.

850
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:14,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anyhow, kind of neat to see some of the concepts of what would happen if Mario was released today.

851
01:00:15,682 --> 01:00:18,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Any ideas on how it might be different if Mario was released today?

852
01:00:22,186 --> 01:00:26,848
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we know what Mario would be like if it's released today, because we keep getting Mario games.

853
01:00:28,513 --> 01:00:30,034
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, they have the tutorial levels in there.

854
01:00:30,334 --> 01:00:34,497
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason why is because people nowadays don't want to spend the time to read the manual.

855
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, I think that's a good idea.

856
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:49,768
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know a lot of stuff now is coming out digitally and stuff, so there isn't really necessarily manuals for it.

857
01:00:49,808 --> 01:00:53,310
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you think about it, though, if you just want to jump into a game and play it,

858
01:00:54,611 --> 01:00:58,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Then, you know, back then you could do that and there's no wasting time.

859
01:00:59,036 --> 01:01:02,720
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't understand what's going on or you have difficulty, then you can refer to the manual.

860
01:01:03,081 --> 01:01:07,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but think about like some of the greatest games from the 80s that were all like the coin-op games.

861
01:01:07,626 --> 01:01:08,707
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have a manual.

862
01:01:08,827 --> 01:01:10,489
[SPEAKER_09]: You should be able to just put in a quarter and play.

863
01:01:10,629 --> 01:01:12,191
[SPEAKER_15]: The button says fire.

864
01:01:12,852 --> 01:01:14,433
[SPEAKER_15]: That means fire.

865
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:24,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, also, I mean, there are a lot of times you would have either like a little brief tutorial, and I mean like five to ten second tutorial in the beginning.

866
01:01:24,358 --> 01:01:24,618
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.

867
01:01:24,638 --> 01:01:26,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Like some of the Neo Geo games would say, okay, here's what you do.

868
01:01:27,099 --> 01:01:32,341
[SPEAKER_07]: And there would be instructions on the cabinet so that, you know, okay, you know, 500 points gives me an extra life.

869
01:01:32,721 --> 01:01:37,263
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, if I hit, you know, fire and jump together, I get a special attack.

870
01:01:37,363 --> 01:01:38,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Or like Street Fighter 2.

871
01:01:39,144 --> 01:01:43,765
[SPEAKER_09]: When they started making the newer cabinets, they would actually put on there little things that had all the moves on them.

872
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:44,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

873
01:01:44,206 --> 01:01:44,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

874
01:01:46,127 --> 01:02:09,609
[SPEAKER_09]: you can actually do that with some of the Neo Geo games that are out on Xbox Live like I know Fatal Fury Special you can actually have the background just show that old little plastic card that has the moves on it pretty cool alright let's get into a segment here on the show we do every week and it's a lot of fun because we get to talk about old stuff

875
01:02:11,715 --> 01:02:13,016
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a classic game of the week.

876
01:02:13,316 --> 01:02:25,265
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura is going to dive into the vault and pull out a classic video game that she thinks, you know what, you ungrateful little kids out there, you should try a classic game and know your roots a little better.

877
01:02:25,525 --> 01:02:25,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Do it!

878
01:02:25,886 --> 01:02:26,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Where you came from.

879
01:02:26,806 --> 01:02:27,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Do it!

880
01:02:27,227 --> 01:02:27,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Do it!

881
01:02:28,087 --> 01:02:29,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so what game should they be playing this week?

882
01:02:30,029 --> 01:02:30,549
[SPEAKER_15]: Final Fantasy 2.

883
01:02:30,609 --> 01:02:34,252
[SPEAKER_09]: You mean actual Final Fantasy 2.

884
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:35,613
[SPEAKER_15]: The actual Final Fantasy 2.

885
01:02:36,594 --> 01:02:38,455
[SPEAKER_15]: Which I actually own the cartridge of, by the way.

886
01:02:39,096 --> 01:02:39,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Very nice.

887
01:02:39,656 --> 01:02:44,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's actually take a look here at some of the music from Final Fantasy II, if we can.

888
01:02:48,401 --> 01:02:54,185
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually had the number that I gave you on that was to the battle music.

889
01:02:54,265 --> 01:02:57,086
[SPEAKER_09]: A little hard to get to the exact right point on YouTube, sorry.

890
01:02:59,148 --> 01:03:02,269
[SPEAKER_15]: At any rate, this is the theme, you know.

891
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:03,750
[SPEAKER_15]: Now you can skip up.

892
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:04,251
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

893
01:03:05,431 --> 01:03:13,136
[SPEAKER_15]: Final Fantasy 2 was actually pretty innovative on an innovative sequel to the last Final Fantasy.

894
01:03:13,997 --> 01:03:14,837
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, to the first one.

895
01:03:16,598 --> 01:03:27,805
[SPEAKER_15]: It's, of course, like every Final Fantasy with a fresh number is, it's a different series of characters, a different world, a different dimension.

896
01:03:29,146 --> 01:03:38,288
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so, um, this one is, there's these four people that are killed in an army invasion in Palamecia.

897
01:03:38,929 --> 01:03:42,129
[SPEAKER_15]: And three of the characters join a rebellion and the other one turns out missing.

898
01:03:42,349 --> 01:03:42,950
[SPEAKER_15]: Ooh.

899
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:50,511
[SPEAKER_15]: So, um, with this one, it actually brought in a lot of stuff that we, you know, take for granted now in a Final Fantasy game.

900
01:03:51,032 --> 01:03:52,312
[SPEAKER_15]: Like Chocobos.

901
01:03:53,153 --> 01:03:53,774
[SPEAKER_15]: and Sid.

902
01:03:54,576 --> 01:03:55,618
[SPEAKER_15]: There's always a Sid.

903
01:03:55,779 --> 01:03:56,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

904
01:03:57,001 --> 01:04:01,953
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people assumed that Chocobos were in the very first game as well as Sid and those didn't appear until two.

905
01:04:02,722 --> 01:04:04,023
[SPEAKER_15]: No, you are right, Rob.

906
01:04:04,504 --> 01:04:06,545
[SPEAKER_15]: It also got rid of experience point leveling.

907
01:04:09,628 --> 01:04:11,690
[SPEAKER_15]: And, of course, the later ones used it.

908
01:04:11,770 --> 01:04:21,818
[SPEAKER_15]: But it used a system where statistics increased depending on how you use the character or how you acquire, I guess.

909
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:25,902
[SPEAKER_15]: Keep in mind, when I first started playing this game back in the day...

910
01:04:26,582 --> 01:04:29,966
[SPEAKER_15]: I was playing a ROM in Japanese, and I kind of gave up.

911
01:04:30,106 --> 01:04:32,929
[SPEAKER_15]: I played through a bit more of 3 than I did of 2.

912
01:04:34,411 --> 01:04:35,953
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm really enjoying it now.

913
01:04:36,253 --> 01:04:39,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the best way to level is to beat your friends, basically.

914
01:04:39,937 --> 01:04:40,939
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, anyway.

915
01:04:45,584 --> 01:04:46,225
[SPEAKER_15]: It's actually...

916
01:04:47,905 --> 01:04:53,929
[SPEAKER_15]: was kind of... Well, you know, they were gonna do this one, Rob.

917
01:04:54,850 --> 01:05:00,854
[SPEAKER_15]: Nintendo actually has... What you're looking at now for our YouTube thing is off the prototype that Nintendo did.

918
01:05:01,114 --> 01:05:01,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.

919
01:05:01,955 --> 01:05:04,257
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's where they got the prototype translation.

920
01:05:05,637 --> 01:05:13,823
[SPEAKER_15]: This one had another really cool thing, as you can see on the video now, Rob, where you have a memory system where you can...

921
01:05:16,785 --> 01:05:31,279
[SPEAKER_15]: a keyword will pop up and you can ask to learn the keyword and once you learn the keyword you can go talk to different people and if it gives you the opportunity to ask them you can use a different keyword and they'll give you new information based on using that keyword

922
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:40,044
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, the first one that you get in, you know, right when you join the rebellion is, I think it's Wild Rose.

923
01:05:40,304 --> 01:05:42,365
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can go around and you say, Wild Rose!

924
01:05:42,445 --> 01:05:43,146
[SPEAKER_15]: To random people.

925
01:05:43,566 --> 01:05:46,447
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're like, I'm really... Or Ivy in this prototype.

926
01:05:47,188 --> 01:05:48,828
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm really not a senile old man.

927
01:05:49,069 --> 01:05:50,049
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a super blacksmith.

928
01:05:50,389 --> 01:05:52,470
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why I'm hanging out at the blacksmith shop.

929
01:05:52,931 --> 01:05:53,211
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

930
01:05:54,498 --> 01:05:56,800
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want them to think I'm anything other than a silly old man.

931
01:05:57,860 --> 01:06:03,263
[SPEAKER_15]: So the characters in here, and actually, I don't remember that the characters had... Do the characters have names?

932
01:06:04,364 --> 01:06:06,826
[SPEAKER_15]: The Warriors of Light have names in the Japanese version?

933
01:06:06,846 --> 01:06:07,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I don't think they did.

934
01:06:08,687 --> 01:06:13,529
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you could just name them and they had default names, kind of like how it works here.

935
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:22,295
[SPEAKER_15]: In the US one, well, there was, you know, Fighter, you know, BL Mage, you know, or B Mage or whatever.

936
01:06:24,637 --> 01:06:30,443
[SPEAKER_15]: This one, the characters, you have Firion, or Frianiel in the Japanese version.

937
01:06:30,583 --> 01:06:35,588
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you've got Maria, Guy, who, when they brought this out on PlayStation, his name was Gus.

938
01:06:36,529 --> 01:06:39,032
[SPEAKER_15]: And Leon, in the Japanese version, his name was Leonhard.

939
01:06:39,973 --> 01:06:40,773
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, um...

940
01:06:41,434 --> 01:06:43,395
[SPEAKER_15]: You spend a lot of the game looking for Leon, by the way.

941
01:06:44,856 --> 01:06:51,761
[SPEAKER_15]: You can also get other people that hang out with you from time to time in your party, like Gordon and Joseph and Layla.

942
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:54,682
[SPEAKER_15]: Meanwoo, the PlayStation version was Meendoo.

943
01:06:55,563 --> 01:06:56,784
[SPEAKER_15]: And Richard Highwind.

944
01:06:56,864 --> 01:06:58,945
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we noticing themes that come up in later games?

945
01:06:59,105 --> 01:07:01,487
[SPEAKER_15]: Highwind, you know, Leonheart.

946
01:07:03,028 --> 01:07:03,608
[SPEAKER_15]: Sound familiar?

947
01:07:03,628 --> 01:07:04,629
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit.

948
01:07:06,716 --> 01:07:12,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, again, this is one that really, really, you know, set a big theme.

949
01:07:13,118 --> 01:07:23,642
[SPEAKER_15]: And also, of course, Furion and Matthias, who is the Emperor, um, the bad guy in the game, uh, they both were in Dissidia, um, as their versus each other character.

950
01:07:24,822 --> 01:07:31,085
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, but I'm not really gonna go too much into the story.

951
01:07:31,305 --> 01:07:34,726
[SPEAKER_15]: The other thing, though, about this, another class that this introduced was the Dragoon.

952
01:07:36,765 --> 01:07:37,966
[SPEAKER_15]: The Dragoon and the Dark Knight.

953
01:07:37,986 --> 01:07:41,269
[SPEAKER_15]: You could sort of get kind of a Dark Knight.

954
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:45,412
[SPEAKER_15]: This had Dark Knights and Dragoons in them.

955
01:07:46,533 --> 01:07:51,278
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot more story driven, a lot more character driven too than the previous versions.

956
01:07:52,138 --> 01:07:54,980
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as, well, the previous version, I should say.

957
01:07:56,901 --> 01:08:14,830
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, another thing is that it did have re-releases, and I was really irritated because I was waiting for Final Fantasy 3 to come out on the WonderSwan Color, because I have the remake of the first Final Fantasy on the WonderSwan Color, which was beautiful, it was gorgeous.

958
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:18,311
[SPEAKER_15]: Final Fantasy 2 came out and I was like, I didn't play too much of it.

959
01:08:18,351 --> 01:08:20,873
[SPEAKER_15]: I was waiting for Final Fantasy 3 and then they went right to 4.

960
01:08:22,654 --> 01:08:34,219
[SPEAKER_15]: But they did a collection re-release for the PlayStation in 2002 that was based off the Game Boy Advance re-release of Final Fantasy 1 and 2, Dawn of Souls.

961
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:39,101
[SPEAKER_15]: And then it came out on mobiles later and then the PSP version in 2007.

962
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:44,064
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the Japanese Wii Virtual Console got a version last year on June 16th.

963
01:08:46,391 --> 01:08:57,658
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, what I think is super cool, and this makes me really happy, is that we've had other releases now.

964
01:08:57,718 --> 01:09:00,960
[SPEAKER_15]: Final Fantasy Origins was the first release outside of Japan.

965
01:09:03,981 --> 01:09:06,803
[SPEAKER_15]: But it came out on iPhone.

966
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:09,525
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have been digging it on iPhone.

967
01:09:10,385 --> 01:09:16,290
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think part of it for me was not being able to read all that well when I was playing it the first time.

968
01:09:16,830 --> 01:09:20,893
[SPEAKER_15]: But now that I'm actually playing it in English, I'm having a pretty good time playing it.

969
01:09:20,953 --> 01:09:27,058
[SPEAKER_15]: The iPhone controls are interesting, but it's really, I think, as good as they can expect to do those controls.

970
01:09:27,118 --> 01:09:28,459
[SPEAKER_15]: It actually works fairly well.

971
01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:45,470
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, the way that it sold in 2003, um, well, by March 31st, 2003, with all of its re-releases, had 1.28 million copies worldwide, and, uh, with 1.08 million of those in Japan.

972
01:09:46,831 --> 01:09:50,954
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, it's just, it's a really good game.

973
01:09:51,014 --> 01:09:52,395
[SPEAKER_15]: I suggest everyone play it, so...

974
01:10:05,687 --> 01:10:20,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Final Fantasy 2 is your classic game of the week and it's available originally on the NES but probably a little more accessible on some of those redone versions the Dark Sakura earlier referenced most commonly the PSP these days and the iPhone versions so check it out Final Fantasy 2

975
01:10:21,499 --> 01:10:27,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we're going to go ahead and use this opportunity to take a quick break, but when we come back we have plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.

976
01:10:27,582 --> 01:10:38,508
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to talk about some of the fan films that have hit the internet, a new Bomani game, and a new non-Bomani game, but might as well be a Bomani game, and talk a little bit about a game called Babymaker.

977
01:10:38,788 --> 01:10:40,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that's right, Babymaker.

978
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:45,132
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, so stick around.

979
01:10:51,656 --> 01:10:56,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, this 366th episode of our show.

980
01:10:57,041 --> 01:10:59,664
[SPEAKER_09]: May 9th, 2010, already in progress.

981
01:10:59,704 --> 01:11:06,310
[SPEAKER_09]: We're here for Part B. More news, fast topics, and all that fun stuff in a few weeks here at Orange Lounge Radio.

982
01:11:06,511 --> 01:11:07,692
[SPEAKER_09]: E3 is going to be...

983
01:11:08,132 --> 01:11:10,314
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

984
01:11:34,151 --> 01:11:36,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news.

985
01:11:36,174 --> 01:11:41,002
[SPEAKER_09]: We have some fast stuff we like to call Rapid Fire Topics and Loki's gonna start it off.

986
01:11:43,285 --> 01:11:43,566
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope.

987
01:11:43,908 --> 01:11:44,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I am.

988
01:11:44,469 --> 01:11:45,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, there you are.

989
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:46,371
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of cool.

990
01:11:47,071 --> 01:11:51,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though the game's not out yet, they're already talking about download content for Red Dead Redemption.

991
01:11:51,736 --> 01:11:56,000
[SPEAKER_07]: And the first piece of download content is going to be coming shortly after its release in June.

992
01:11:56,601 --> 01:12:01,086
[SPEAKER_07]: And it will be getting a free co-op expansion, which is kind of cool.

993
01:12:01,106 --> 01:12:05,951
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to have some new, I guess, I'm not sure these are missions.

994
01:12:06,431 --> 01:12:08,713
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

995
01:12:25,588 --> 01:12:54,290
[SPEAKER_07]: and AmiMission which the Mexican army has I guess a town under siege and you have to storm the gates under heavy cannon fire and that sounds kind of cool and those are going to be compatible with up to two to four players and doesn't say exactly when they'll be coming out in June but sometime during June also they're saying that they're going to be having some more two more additional download content updates over the summer

996
01:12:55,431 --> 01:12:57,493
[SPEAKER_07]: However, those are unlikely to be free.

997
01:12:59,954 --> 01:13:01,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Pricing, I guess, will be announced later on.

998
01:13:03,797 --> 01:13:11,862
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, in May, we've got some more songs becoming available for Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero.

999
01:13:13,303 --> 01:13:20,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Starting off with May 6th, the Classic Rock Track Pack 3, which you can get the whole pack for 440 Microsoft Points, or $5.49.

1000
01:13:20,227 --> 01:13:20,287
[SPEAKER_07]: And

1001
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:34,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Regular Money, and that includes Jukebox Hero by Foreigner, Sweet Home Alabama by Leonard Skinner, and Take the Money and Run by the Steve Miller Band.

1002
01:13:34,875 --> 01:13:35,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1003
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:37,496
[SPEAKER_15]: I love that song.

1004
01:13:37,577 --> 01:13:43,620
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a Guitar Hero pack coming out with Foreigner, Skinner, and Steve Miller Band.

1005
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:54,807
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like the county fair pack right there.

1006
01:13:55,167 --> 01:14:01,151
[SPEAKER_09]: I was driving home from the bay today, and you have to drive through the middle of nowhere to get between San Francisco and Sac, right?

1007
01:14:01,531 --> 01:14:04,053
[SPEAKER_09]: And sure enough, come into Dixon, the Dixon County Fair.

1008
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:05,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Foreigner!

1009
01:14:07,735 --> 01:14:15,661
[SPEAKER_07]: and also of course the Classic Brock track pack was available on May 6th.

1010
01:14:15,721 --> 01:14:19,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course it will not be available for the PlayStation 3 until May 11th.

1011
01:14:20,804 --> 01:14:24,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Also on May 11th, the Alternative Pop track pack coming out.

1012
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:26,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Same pricing there.

1013
01:14:26,448 --> 01:14:34,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Including with that would be Facedown by AlphaRev, Lode by Capra, and You're All I Have by Snow Patrol.

1014
01:14:35,334 --> 01:14:42,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are also available for 160 Microsoft Points each or 200 Wii Points, $2, real money.

1015
01:14:43,399 --> 01:14:50,164
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally, the Aerosmith track pack, which includes Livin' on the Edge, Lovin' in an Elevator, and Ragdoll.

1016
01:14:50,184 --> 01:14:50,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, wait, wait.

1017
01:14:50,864 --> 01:14:53,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't Aerosmith have like a Guitar Hero game?

1018
01:14:53,246 --> 01:14:59,049
[SPEAKER_07]: They may have with all those tracks in there, but hey, if you don't have those... Why not buy them all over again?

1019
01:14:59,590 --> 01:15:00,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

1020
01:15:00,410 --> 01:15:00,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1021
01:15:01,951 --> 01:15:02,252
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1022
01:15:04,309 --> 01:15:04,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1023
01:15:22,781 --> 01:15:23,882
[SPEAKER_07]: That's already been confirmed.

1024
01:15:24,162 --> 01:15:24,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, whatever.

1025
01:15:24,963 --> 01:15:37,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, other stuff that's coming out on the Xbox Live Marketplace in May, including, let's see here, May 17th, the deal of the week will be Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition.

1026
01:15:37,731 --> 01:15:40,173
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to be able to get that for half off for $5.

1027
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:43,055
[SPEAKER_07]: They're also going to have some Avatar items as well.

1028
01:15:43,495 --> 01:15:48,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Lee Chuck Pirate Hat for $0.50 and Avatar Cotton Swab.

1029
01:15:48,519 --> 01:15:50,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, the giant cotton swab for

1030
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:53,462
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess a dollar.

1031
01:15:54,902 --> 01:15:55,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1032
01:15:56,343 --> 01:15:59,265
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's more expensive than an actual cotton swab, by the way.

1033
01:15:59,505 --> 01:16:00,766
[SPEAKER_07]: You paid a whole dollar for that?

1034
01:16:01,366 --> 01:16:03,047
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I wouldn't pay for that.

1035
01:16:03,327 --> 01:16:04,728
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, that's what they're asking for.

1036
01:16:05,588 --> 01:16:07,009
[SPEAKER_07]: New games on demand are going to be coming out.

1037
01:16:07,629 --> 01:16:10,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Last week we had Brothers in Arms, Hell's Highway, and Prince of Persia.

1038
01:16:11,952 --> 01:16:26,819
[SPEAKER_07]: This week on the 11th we have Tom Clancy's End War May 18th in the Asian region Command & Conquer 3 And on May 25th Battlefield 2 Modern Combat will be available in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand only

1039
01:16:27,139 --> 01:16:31,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I was going to say, when did they start doing new games on demand every week?

1040
01:16:31,902 --> 01:16:34,344
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're not really doing new games on demand every week.

1041
01:16:34,364 --> 01:16:35,765
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just different regions are getting it.

1042
01:16:36,005 --> 01:16:36,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1043
01:16:37,306 --> 01:16:42,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Last week we had Xenoclash Ultimate Edition for $15, 1200 Microsoft points, and Raystorm HD also for $15.

1044
01:16:42,209 --> 01:16:42,749
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like $15 and new $10.

1045
01:16:42,789 --> 01:16:43,230
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1046
01:16:49,074 --> 01:16:54,098
[SPEAKER_07]: This week on May 12th, Rocket Knight Adventures will be coming out for $15 or 1,200 Microsoft points.

1047
01:16:54,699 --> 01:17:03,948
[SPEAKER_07]: And on June 2nd, which technically isn't May, even though this is a May list, and technically isn't a game I care about, Snoopy Flying Ace coming out for $10.

1048
01:17:04,228 --> 01:17:05,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what?

1049
01:17:05,569 --> 01:17:07,731
[SPEAKER_07]: That's $10 more than you should really pay for that.

1050
01:17:08,272 --> 01:17:09,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Will Snoopy be fighting the Red Baron?

1051
01:17:10,194 --> 01:17:12,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, probably, because that's all he ever does.

1052
01:17:13,117 --> 01:17:13,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Get over it!

1053
01:17:13,637 --> 01:17:14,859
[SPEAKER_09]: That was World War II!

1054
01:17:14,919 --> 01:17:17,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Will Woodstock be in there to talk in his little lines?

1055
01:17:18,845 --> 01:17:19,966
[SPEAKER_09]: I always loved Woodstock's speech.

1056
01:17:21,514 --> 01:17:21,854
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1057
01:17:23,515 --> 01:17:28,676
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the Avatar Marketplace will be getting some Final Fantasy XIII and Gamer items.

1058
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:33,298
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if those Final Fantasy XIII items were the same ones that you got for registering the game.

1059
01:17:33,978 --> 01:17:34,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't know.

1060
01:17:35,219 --> 01:17:40,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Army of Two and Kingdom for Kefling items will be available May 13th as well.

1061
01:17:41,321 --> 01:17:42,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Finally, download content.

1062
01:17:43,261 --> 01:17:49,524
[SPEAKER_07]: No Doubt is getting the Tragic Kingdom album for Rock Band, which I think that came out last week.

1063
01:17:49,624 --> 01:17:50,884
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we talked about it last week.

1064
01:17:52,445 --> 01:18:12,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Lips is getting the Miley Cyrus song pack and Forza Motorsports 3 is getting the exotic car pack Super Street Fighter 4 is getting the Super Shuriken pack and Dragon Age Origins is getting the Darkspawn Chronicles pack as well

1065
01:18:12,461 --> 01:18:19,484
[SPEAKER_07]: and also sometime, they didn't say when, Magic Gathering Duels of the Planeswalker will be getting a second expansion pack.

1066
01:18:20,085 --> 01:18:35,092
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, speaking of Snoopy and all that stuff, when Loki was reading a lot of those releases, you know, those really exciting releases for the month of May, this is kind of what I was hearing was a lot of, you know, the teacher from Charlie Brown. ...

1067
01:18:38,837 --> 01:18:39,698
[SPEAKER_06]: He said my name.

1068
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:42,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

1069
01:18:42,522 --> 01:18:45,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Wah, wah, wah, wah.

1070
01:18:45,265 --> 01:18:45,886
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, Ms.

1071
01:18:45,906 --> 01:18:46,447
[SPEAKER_15]: Trombone.

1072
01:18:48,945 --> 01:18:49,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1073
01:19:19,478 --> 01:19:20,619
[SPEAKER_09]: You can check it out.

1074
01:19:21,119 --> 01:19:25,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently it was already at San Diego Comic Con, but now it's there in 15 levels.

1075
01:19:26,844 --> 01:19:28,665
[SPEAKER_09]: You get to blow stuff up.

1076
01:19:28,705 --> 01:19:29,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Have fun.

1077
01:19:31,247 --> 01:19:34,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, some new developments in the silver lining.

1078
01:19:35,911 --> 01:19:37,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Drama that's going on.

1079
01:19:37,052 --> 01:19:40,795
[SPEAKER_09]: You might remember the silver lining, because we actually had them on our show a while ago.

1080
01:19:41,355 --> 01:19:49,361
[SPEAKER_09]: It was this fan project for a King's Quest 9, basically, but at the end of the day, they had to take the King's Quest name off of it if they wanted to actually release the game.

1081
01:19:49,982 --> 01:19:54,125
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when Activision got the rights to the game, they were like, well, you're not releasing that game.

1082
01:19:54,605 --> 01:19:57,047
[SPEAKER_09]: And they were like, but boo-hoo, we spent so many years making it.

1083
01:19:57,507 --> 01:19:58,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the deal.

1084
01:19:59,028 --> 01:20:04,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, I guess it has come full circle that it might actually...

1085
01:20:05,353 --> 01:20:07,315
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1086
01:20:29,697 --> 01:20:30,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1087
01:20:51,505 --> 01:21:11,011
[SPEAKER_09]: you can check that out Kotaku ran this story on what was this May 3rd was the date that they ran it and kind of this whole little epic piece about it and yeah Activision I guess finally getting in touch with them realizing they are being dicks got the big stick out their butt Bobby Kotek clearly was not involved

1088
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:33,290
[SPEAKER_09]: also coming out on the Wii soon a very exciting game called My Fireplace that is if the ESRB is to be believed there will be a game called My Fireplace and you'll be able to actually you know have your own fireplace you can put logs on the fire and decorate the mantle and pump air in the fireplace to keep it going that better be free

1089
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:37,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Sadly, it's probably WiiWare.

1090
01:21:37,641 --> 01:21:40,763
[SPEAKER_09]: I would guess it's probably going to be $10 WiiWare.

1091
01:21:40,783 --> 01:21:42,904
[SPEAKER_15]: People do buy those fireplace DVDs.

1092
01:21:43,444 --> 01:21:44,324
[SPEAKER_09]: And Blu-rays now.

1093
01:21:44,724 --> 01:21:46,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't Xbox have one of those last year?

1094
01:21:47,366 --> 01:21:48,206
[SPEAKER_07]: A fireplace sim?

1095
01:21:48,866 --> 01:21:58,551
[SPEAKER_07]: I think an Xbox fireplace sim is the more appropriate console for that, being that it can put out the heat of a fireplace as well.

1096
01:21:58,631 --> 01:22:02,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the Wii fireplace thing deserves to be in the fireplace.

1097
01:22:03,713 --> 01:22:04,454
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1098
01:22:28,806 --> 01:22:34,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, 77 degrees Celsius, your Intel processor chips don't run that hot.

1099
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:38,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Real quick before we get to DarkSakura's story, some comments from our chat room.

1100
01:22:39,133 --> 01:22:43,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the folks in chat, our DJ Dark Knight says, Can't wait for Rocket Knight.

1101
01:22:43,156 --> 01:22:44,777
[SPEAKER_09]: And Actdeft says, Rocket Knight, awesome.

1102
01:22:44,797 --> 01:22:47,959
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess there is at least one game to look forward to in May.

1103
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:55,204
[SPEAKER_09]: And ToyGak commenting on the Wii Fireplace says, Fucking shitty WiiWare can go choke on a piece of my anatomy.

1104
01:22:56,724 --> 01:22:57,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Elbow Porkchop

1105
01:23:13,257 --> 01:23:16,340
[SPEAKER_15]: Star Trek Adventures Year One Fan Project Fan Project

1106
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:45,163
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks along the lines of old school Star Trek games, like maybe from the mid to late 90s, possibly.

1107
01:23:45,724 --> 01:23:46,024
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway...

1108
01:23:47,992 --> 01:23:59,421
[SPEAKER_15]: You can go to the official homepage for the project, which is just Star Trek Adventures All In Word dot com slash year one.

1109
01:24:00,182 --> 01:24:01,323
[SPEAKER_15]: See if you like it.

1110
01:24:01,423 --> 01:24:01,823
[SPEAKER_15]: Let us know.

1111
01:24:01,883 --> 01:24:02,364
[SPEAKER_15]: I won't play it.

1112
01:24:02,384 --> 01:24:03,224
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got Star Trek online.

1113
01:24:04,165 --> 01:24:07,548
[SPEAKER_15]: And the next story, which is one that Rob gave me the wrong link to and I had to go find.

1114
01:24:07,853 --> 01:24:08,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm sorry, my bad.

1115
01:24:09,573 --> 01:24:10,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you sound so sad.

1116
01:24:10,894 --> 01:24:12,794
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry you had to do work tonight, Jamie.

1117
01:24:12,974 --> 01:24:14,395
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very sorry to inconvenience you.

1118
01:24:14,415 --> 01:24:14,735
[SPEAKER_09]: I do work.

1119
01:24:15,755 --> 01:24:16,935
[SPEAKER_15]: Sid Meier's Pirates.

1120
01:24:17,935 --> 01:24:18,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Arr!

1121
01:24:18,976 --> 01:24:21,616
[SPEAKER_15]: Plundering, shooting.

1122
01:24:21,716 --> 01:24:22,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Plundering the booty.

1123
01:24:22,857 --> 01:24:23,897
[SPEAKER_15]: Keelhauling.

1124
01:24:25,717 --> 01:24:31,459
[SPEAKER_15]: It will be on the Wii in the fall and has, so it's got some minigames.

1125
01:24:31,479 --> 01:24:32,879
[SPEAKER_15]: It's put up by 2K China.

1126
01:24:32,899 --> 01:24:33,979
[SPEAKER_15]: Ooh.

1127
01:24:34,479 --> 01:24:36,540
[SPEAKER_15]: With streamlined controls for the Wiimote.

1128
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:38,580
[SPEAKER_15]: Ooh.

1129
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:44,382
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the minigames, the two new ones would be Bombardment and Lockpicking.

1130
01:24:45,762 --> 01:24:45,982
[SPEAKER_15]: Ooh.

1131
01:24:46,202 --> 01:24:50,023
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can have character and ship customization options.

1132
01:24:51,624 --> 01:24:51,864
[SPEAKER_15]: Ooh.

1133
01:24:52,224 --> 01:24:52,444
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

1134
01:24:53,824 --> 01:24:57,245
[SPEAKER_15]: And last but never least, except in this case, Rock Band.

1135
01:24:57,925 --> 01:24:59,846
[SPEAKER_15]: We will be getting stuff.

1136
01:25:01,166 --> 01:25:29,756
[SPEAKER_15]: mostly actually all consisting of the Judas Priest British Steel 30th Anniversary Complete Album Pack which will be 1200 points or $14.99 US dollars including on it Breaking the Law Breaking the Law and Rapid Fire Metal Gods Grinder United Living After Midnight Midnight You Don't Have to Be Old to Be Wise The Rage and Stealer but you know it's all for me

1137
01:25:30,456 --> 01:25:32,356
[SPEAKER_15]: Breaking the law, breaking the law.

1138
01:25:32,757 --> 01:25:35,117
[SPEAKER_15]: Or washing the dog, washing the dog.

1139
01:25:36,317 --> 01:25:36,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1140
01:25:37,278 --> 01:25:38,018
[SPEAKER_14]: You remember that?

1141
01:25:38,678 --> 01:25:38,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1142
01:25:39,838 --> 01:25:41,059
[SPEAKER_09]: And I tried very hard to forget.

1143
01:25:41,659 --> 01:25:45,380
[SPEAKER_14]: That was like my favorite episode of Beavis and Butthead.

1144
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:49,741
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, they put the dog in the dryer, then they put Beavis in the dryer.

1145
01:25:51,341 --> 01:25:52,661
[SPEAKER_14]: I threw up on the dog.

1146
01:25:53,081 --> 01:25:54,182
[SPEAKER_09]: I threw up on you.

1147
01:25:54,562 --> 01:25:56,942
[SPEAKER_09]: My favorite episode of Beavis and Butthead was with the gym teacher.

1148
01:25:57,302 --> 01:25:59,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Today we're going to talk about the penis.

1149
01:26:00,413 --> 01:26:02,094
[SPEAKER_09]: and then we'll talk about the vagina.

1150
01:26:02,434 --> 01:26:05,456
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I played that clip on OLR a few weeks ago.

1151
01:26:05,476 --> 01:26:06,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I loved it.

1152
01:26:06,397 --> 01:26:07,218
[SPEAKER_09]: That was my favorite episode.

1153
01:26:07,238 --> 01:26:08,098
[SPEAKER_09]: You should play that again soon.

1154
01:26:08,238 --> 01:26:09,159
[SPEAKER_09]: You want me to play that again soon?

1155
01:26:09,179 --> 01:26:09,879
[SPEAKER_15]: Play that again now.

1156
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's going to take me a minute to find it.

1157
01:26:12,521 --> 01:26:13,642
[SPEAKER_15]: Soon.

1158
01:26:13,742 --> 01:26:14,242
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1159
01:26:14,342 --> 01:26:17,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Just randomly later in the show, I'll play that clip from Beavis and Butthead.

1160
01:26:17,544 --> 01:26:19,806
[SPEAKER_09]: You won't know when, but it will happen.

1161
01:26:19,906 --> 01:26:21,787
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be during one of my stories, I'm sure.

1162
01:26:23,648 --> 01:26:24,549
[SPEAKER_15]: This will be Matt.

1163
01:26:25,109 --> 01:26:28,472
[SPEAKER_15]: And yeah, this game's gonna come out and it's probably gonna suck.

1164
01:26:28,952 --> 01:26:30,813
[SPEAKER_15]: And today we're talking about the penis!

1165
01:26:31,494 --> 01:26:36,718
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

1166
01:26:37,018 --> 01:26:38,859
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think of my Loki impression?

1167
01:26:38,979 --> 01:26:39,740
[SPEAKER_09]: I have the wah-wah-wah.

1168
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:40,440
[SPEAKER_09]: It was very good.

1169
01:26:40,941 --> 01:26:41,621
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was pretty spot on.

1170
01:26:41,641 --> 01:26:42,162
[SPEAKER_09]: A little more anger.

1171
01:26:42,182 --> 01:26:42,982
[SPEAKER_09]: A little more anger.

1172
01:26:43,122 --> 01:26:47,886
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I was going for disinterested yet snarky.

1173
01:26:51,772 --> 01:26:52,813
[SPEAKER_07]: That's me, alright.

1174
01:26:53,634 --> 01:26:54,975
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, Loki, heart, heart, heart.

1175
01:26:55,175 --> 01:26:56,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Needs more Smashburger.

1176
01:26:57,057 --> 01:26:57,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter topics!

1177
01:26:58,178 --> 01:26:58,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

1178
01:26:59,018 --> 01:27:01,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter, saving the show from being a complete train wreck.

1179
01:27:01,701 --> 01:27:04,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, every week we take your tweets.

1180
01:27:04,503 --> 01:27:07,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Show us your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.

1181
01:27:07,386 --> 01:27:08,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Blue Swim starts us off tonight.

1182
01:27:09,628 --> 01:27:18,656
[SPEAKER_09]: OLR, if you could only have one CD or album to listen to forever while killing the undead after the zombie apocalypse, what would it be?

1183
01:27:22,103 --> 01:27:24,505
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, one album left ever?

1184
01:27:25,265 --> 01:27:28,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, while killing the undead after the zombie apocalypse.

1185
01:27:28,928 --> 01:27:36,874
[SPEAKER_09]: See, for me that changes it, because that's not asking like my Desert Island CD, but you're asking what CD am I going to kill all the zombies to after the apocalypse.

1186
01:27:36,894 --> 01:27:38,395
[SPEAKER_09]: That kind of changes my answer a little bit.

1187
01:27:39,191 --> 01:28:07,812
[SPEAKER_15]: um I would have to you know for me because I'll listen to his custom CDs anyway um I'd actually I'd have one of two now if I was just watching the zombies it would definitely be the soundtrack to Shaun of the Dead but if I'm out there killing them it would be Anthrax's Attack of the Killer Bees just so I can put uh bring the noise on repeat and just wail on zombies with crowbar and remember Rob double tap

1188
01:28:08,832 --> 01:28:18,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Mine would be the soundtrack to Lost Highway, which was a completely screwed up movie that had a great soundtrack that would be great for zombie killing.

1189
01:28:18,875 --> 01:28:20,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, do you have a zombie killing CD?

1190
01:28:20,616 --> 01:28:22,756
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1191
01:28:25,417 --> 01:28:28,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Bochikawa says, I'd have to do zombie killing to Space Channel 5.

1192
01:28:28,698 --> 01:28:30,519
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, I put Mexican Flyer in Cage March once.

1193
01:28:32,546 --> 01:28:33,247
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really know.

1194
01:28:33,267 --> 01:28:37,209
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have any albums that would necessarily be good for zombie killing.

1195
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:42,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess... I don't know.

1196
01:28:42,533 --> 01:28:42,933
[SPEAKER_09]: No ideas?

1197
01:28:43,134 --> 01:28:44,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, fine.

1198
01:28:44,595 --> 01:28:47,116
[SPEAKER_07]: We can do the Top Gun soundtrack because that would be funny.

1199
01:28:47,237 --> 01:28:48,417
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go, Top Gun soundtrack.

1200
01:28:48,477 --> 01:28:48,978
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that idea.

1201
01:28:48,998 --> 01:28:51,680
[SPEAKER_14]: I head to the danger zone.

1202
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:54,822
[SPEAKER_14]: BOOM!

1203
01:28:57,044 --> 01:28:58,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Take my breath away.

1204
01:28:59,065 --> 01:28:59,745
[SPEAKER_09]: BANG!

1205
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:03,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Eat your brains away.

1206
01:29:03,182 --> 01:29:04,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Bam!

1207
01:29:04,723 --> 01:29:06,365
[SPEAKER_15]: We used to have... I have to tell you.

1208
01:29:07,266 --> 01:29:09,107
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll tell you the funny story about Becky's son.

1209
01:29:09,308 --> 01:29:10,449
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's sort of related to that.

1210
01:29:10,569 --> 01:29:10,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1211
01:29:11,289 --> 01:29:11,770
[SPEAKER_15]: Please.

1212
01:29:13,452 --> 01:29:15,113
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just playing with Julian and we were talking.

1213
01:29:15,153 --> 01:29:16,675
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, what's in your head?

1214
01:29:16,695 --> 01:29:19,918
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, he's like, brains.

1215
01:29:20,878 --> 01:29:21,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1216
01:29:21,099 --> 01:29:22,700
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, what are your brains like?

1217
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:23,241
[SPEAKER_15]: Space.

1218
01:29:23,621 --> 01:29:24,221
[SPEAKER_15]: Spicy!

1219
01:29:24,541 --> 01:29:28,663
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I'm gonna have to go with Maze Satsuma, Rob Zombie.

1220
01:29:29,743 --> 01:29:30,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude!

1221
01:29:30,603 --> 01:29:34,104
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no, it would have to be the old school white zombie album from 93.

1222
01:29:34,364 --> 01:29:35,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh god.

1223
01:29:36,345 --> 01:29:38,285
[SPEAKER_09]: More human than human!

1224
01:29:38,586 --> 01:29:40,006
[SPEAKER_09]: More human than human!

1225
01:29:40,627 --> 01:29:41,007
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously?

1226
01:29:41,027 --> 01:29:42,489
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my white zombie impression.

1227
01:29:42,549 --> 01:29:43,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of sounds like an angry St.

1228
01:29:43,971 --> 01:29:44,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Bernard.

1229
01:29:44,953 --> 01:29:50,861
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, SSJ100Matt says, Blues Brothers themed for when you're driving.

1230
01:29:51,542 --> 01:29:53,585
[SPEAKER_15]: And then Frisbee says, blow my parts away.

1231
01:29:56,769 --> 01:29:58,710
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are kind of weird in chat.

1232
01:29:58,750 --> 01:29:59,150
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what?

1233
01:29:59,230 --> 01:30:02,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I know what music would be perfect.

1234
01:30:03,093 --> 01:30:07,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Would be just absolutely perfect for Loki to be killing to.

1235
01:30:08,356 --> 01:30:12,318
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe he would have to have this old soundtrack and would kill the zombies to this.

1236
01:30:14,479 --> 01:30:15,399
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a sexy party song.

1237
01:30:15,419 --> 01:30:16,260
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a sexy party song.

1238
01:30:25,467 --> 01:30:29,669
[SPEAKER_09]: I would play any video game with this as the theme song.

1239
01:30:29,689 --> 01:30:33,311
[SPEAKER_15]: Yaris 2, Future Rain, Benny Hill.

1240
01:30:33,932 --> 01:30:36,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Was there ever a Benny Hill video game?

1241
01:30:36,613 --> 01:30:45,197
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what, the weirdness in my brain just went from show theme to show theme to show theme, imagining killing zombies to.

1242
01:30:45,238 --> 01:30:47,018
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know what I finally settled on, Rob?

1243
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:48,339
[SPEAKER_15]: The facts of life.

1244
01:30:53,544 --> 01:30:55,545
[SPEAKER_14]: You take the good, you take the bad.

1245
01:30:56,446 --> 01:30:59,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Could you imagine just be skipping along with your Uzi?

1246
01:31:06,611 --> 01:31:08,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I was trying to play it for you guys.

1247
01:31:08,412 --> 01:31:10,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Stupid YouTube is like too quiet sometimes.

1248
01:31:10,673 --> 01:31:10,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's try.

1249
01:31:11,014 --> 01:31:12,054
[SPEAKER_09]: So, okay.

1250
01:31:12,074 --> 01:31:13,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Killing zombies to this.

1251
01:31:13,075 --> 01:31:13,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.

1252
01:31:18,075 --> 01:31:19,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, this is the stupid pilot episode.

1253
01:31:19,658 --> 01:31:20,259
[SPEAKER_09]: This doesn't work.

1254
01:31:20,339 --> 01:31:20,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn it.

1255
01:31:20,981 --> 01:31:23,285
[SPEAKER_09]: How hard is it to find the stupid Facts of Life theme song?

1256
01:31:23,345 --> 01:31:23,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Christ.

1257
01:31:23,786 --> 01:31:24,407
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1258
01:31:27,673 --> 01:31:28,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.

1259
01:31:30,177 --> 01:31:35,140
[SPEAKER_03]: That was, like, later in the series, right before it stopped being a girl's school.

1260
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:37,601
[SPEAKER_03]: When they, like, sized down most of the cast.

1261
01:31:37,661 --> 01:31:38,061
[SPEAKER_15]: Aw, Tootie.

1262
01:31:38,081 --> 01:31:39,522
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a... She was such a bitch.

1263
01:31:39,562 --> 01:31:39,782
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

1264
01:32:00,037 --> 01:32:03,021
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet Bluestone had no idea his question would turn into this.

1265
01:32:03,602 --> 01:32:06,906
[SPEAKER_15]: X-Link said I would use a song that Betty White sang last night on SNL.

1266
01:32:08,208 --> 01:32:09,510
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's move to the next topic, Rob.

1267
01:32:09,570 --> 01:32:10,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, please, please.

1268
01:32:10,591 --> 01:32:11,873
[SPEAKER_09]: We could listen to old theme songs all night.

1269
01:32:12,253 --> 01:32:13,154
[SPEAKER_15]: Although, one more.

1270
01:32:13,795 --> 01:32:15,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Frisbee says Having a Wonderful Time by Tiny Tim.

1271
01:32:17,182 --> 01:32:17,463
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1272
01:32:17,703 --> 01:32:20,426
[SPEAKER_09]: And now a couple of chatters are asking, what about the Golden Girls theme?

1273
01:32:20,487 --> 01:32:21,007
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1274
01:32:21,488 --> 01:32:24,832
[SPEAKER_09]: MissingNo64 is asking, we need to go back to Twitter topics, please.

1275
01:32:24,993 --> 01:32:26,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we all get in the right state of mind, please?

1276
01:32:26,535 --> 01:32:28,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me play the music.

1277
01:32:29,078 --> 01:32:30,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Get you back into Twitter topic mood.

1278
01:32:31,843 --> 01:32:35,284
[SPEAKER_09]: MissingNo wants to know, did you ever put up the PAX East All Games mini show?

1279
01:32:35,544 --> 01:32:37,684
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought I did, but maybe not.

1280
01:32:38,304 --> 01:32:39,485
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it aired on All Games.

1281
01:32:39,525 --> 01:32:40,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Fail!

1282
01:32:40,745 --> 01:32:42,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I really never put that up?

1283
01:32:42,065 --> 01:32:42,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I didn't.

1284
01:32:42,885 --> 01:32:43,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Fail!

1285
01:32:43,586 --> 01:32:43,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops.

1286
01:32:44,546 --> 01:32:45,006
[SPEAKER_09]: My bad.

1287
01:32:45,746 --> 01:32:46,826
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have to take care of that.

1288
01:32:47,046 --> 01:32:47,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me know.

1289
01:32:47,507 --> 01:32:53,348
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't... Somebody like DarkTetsuya or Tigerclaw or somebody that knows this show or Misty would know if I put that up or not.

1290
01:32:53,428 --> 01:32:56,789
[SPEAKER_09]: So I will... Maybe I do need to put it up.

1291
01:32:56,849 --> 01:32:57,389
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought I did.

1292
01:32:57,929 --> 01:32:58,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops.

1293
01:32:58,289 --> 01:32:58,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops.

1294
01:32:59,585 --> 01:33:09,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft sends us a link to Obama chat, and yes, this has to do with games, because apparently during a grad speech, he actually was kind of dissing video games a little bit.

1295
01:33:11,173 --> 01:33:24,101
[SPEAKER_09]: He apparently was speaking at Hampton University in Virginia and saying, quote, You're coming of age in a 24-7 media environment that bombards us with all kinds of content and exposes us to all kinds of arguments, some of which don't always rank all that high on the truth meter.

1296
01:33:24,522 --> 01:33:28,865
[SPEAKER_09]: With iPods and iPads and Xboxes and Playstations, none of which I know how to work,

1297
01:33:29,585 --> 01:33:36,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Information becomes a distraction, a diversion, a form of entertainment rather than a tool of empowerment, rather than the means of emancipation.

1298
01:33:37,528 --> 01:33:41,909
[SPEAKER_09]: All of this is not only putting new pressures on you, it's putting new pressures on our country and on our democracy.

1299
01:33:45,490 --> 01:33:46,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1300
01:33:46,451 --> 01:33:49,892
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean... I don't think he was specifically talking about just video games.

1301
01:33:50,032 --> 01:33:51,512
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't take that as a slam.

1302
01:33:52,073 --> 01:33:55,394
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll take that as a, turn off the console and go play outside.

1303
01:33:55,734 --> 01:33:55,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1304
01:33:55,934 --> 01:33:56,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1305
01:33:57,192 --> 01:33:59,353
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's nothing wrong with a distraction or diversion.

1306
01:33:59,393 --> 01:34:02,055
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, even President Obama takes vacations to Hawaii.

1307
01:34:02,295 --> 01:34:04,476
[SPEAKER_09]: So everybody needs a diversion every now and then.

1308
01:34:06,097 --> 01:34:10,219
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think he's just saying... The president is the person you want to take vacations.

1309
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:11,700
[SPEAKER_15]: Imagine the stress.

1310
01:34:12,881 --> 01:34:15,883
[SPEAKER_09]: And Blackwolf in chat is quick to point out that... Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1311
01:34:16,343 --> 01:34:18,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Obama has an iPod and a Blackberry.

1312
01:34:18,304 --> 01:34:20,205
[SPEAKER_09]: He did give the Queen of England an iPod, did he not?

1313
01:34:21,556 --> 01:34:23,839
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think one of his speech writers fucked up.

1314
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:25,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops.

1315
01:34:26,383 --> 01:34:27,044
[SPEAKER_13]: That's different.

1316
01:34:27,885 --> 01:34:28,186
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1317
01:34:29,768 --> 01:34:31,751
[SPEAKER_09]: And Blackwolf says he's addicted to his Blackberry.

1318
01:34:33,479 --> 01:34:39,482
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, then again, wasn't it the Prime Minister of Finland, I believe it was, or one of the area countries?

1319
01:34:40,602 --> 01:34:47,685
[SPEAKER_15]: When the volcanic ash hit Europe, he was stuck in New York running country business from his iPad.

1320
01:34:48,766 --> 01:34:52,847
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's more of a necessity type of thing.

1321
01:34:52,887 --> 01:34:56,009
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, even me, I'd be lost without my iPhone now because I run my life by it.

1322
01:34:56,289 --> 01:34:58,390
[SPEAKER_09]: In my big fat opinion, it's not...

1323
01:35:01,111 --> 01:35:01,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?

1324
01:35:02,531 --> 01:35:07,574
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you can use your iPad to be completely unproductive, or you could be pretty productive with it.

1325
01:35:07,714 --> 01:35:09,194
[SPEAKER_09]: It really just depends on how you use it.

1326
01:35:09,534 --> 01:35:15,557
[SPEAKER_09]: You can use your iPad to play stupid video games all day, or you could use it to write a novel.

1327
01:35:15,917 --> 01:35:17,678
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's just however you choose to use it.

1328
01:35:20,256 --> 01:35:21,137
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know.

1329
01:35:21,298 --> 01:35:22,099
[SPEAKER_09]: I used mine for both.

1330
01:35:22,619 --> 01:35:28,648
[SPEAKER_09]: It's probably more of a speech writer than it is an actual Obama quote, but whatever.

1331
01:35:29,629 --> 01:35:30,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Shouldn't say it if he doesn't agree with it.

1332
01:35:31,612 --> 01:35:34,576
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw305 linked us to a multitude of stories.

1333
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:36,259
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm only going to pick a couple of these here.

1334
01:35:36,699 --> 01:35:37,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1335
01:35:52,182 --> 01:35:56,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely has that Street Fighter 4, a little bit of hybrid with Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.

1336
01:35:56,946 --> 01:36:17,843
[SPEAKER_09]: What I thought was most interesting was the character bio section, which seems to confirm some of the characters that will be in the game, including Dante, which I thought was pretty awesome, from Devil May Cry is there, Deadpool, it made DarkSakura squeal, of course, Iron Man, you gotta have that, because, you know, smashing box office records, or actually, no, I don't think it smashed records this weekend, but it did very well.

1337
01:36:18,624 --> 01:36:24,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Felicia, Morgan, and all the hot chicks from Darkstalkers Captain America Was that from again?

1338
01:36:25,093 --> 01:36:25,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Felicia and Morgan?

1339
01:36:26,034 --> 01:36:29,479
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no The scan

1340
01:36:30,293 --> 01:36:30,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I don't know.

1341
01:36:30,673 --> 01:36:32,293
[SPEAKER_09]: It must be some magazine that's coming out soon.

1342
01:36:32,333 --> 01:36:32,693
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1343
01:36:32,753 --> 01:36:34,774
[SPEAKER_09]: He linked me to a website here that had it.

1344
01:36:34,894 --> 01:36:37,274
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm assuming it's some magazines running these screens soon.

1345
01:36:37,294 --> 01:36:42,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if you look at some of the screenshots, you can see a little caption there.

1346
01:36:43,055 --> 01:36:44,356
[SPEAKER_07]: That's some sexy stuff right there.

1347
01:36:44,916 --> 01:36:46,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like it'll be a pretty hot game.

1348
01:36:46,216 --> 01:36:47,016
[SPEAKER_09]: So looking forward to that.

1349
01:36:47,236 --> 01:36:49,537
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming Spider-Man's in there since the Daily Bugle.

1350
01:36:49,937 --> 01:36:50,477
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gotta be.

1351
01:36:51,417 --> 01:36:55,218
[SPEAKER_09]: So big thanks to Tigerclaw for linking us to that because we were actually peeking at that before the show tonight.

1352
01:36:55,758 --> 01:36:56,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Only a year away.

1353
01:36:57,698 --> 01:37:00,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I thought this story was definitely worth talking about.

1354
01:37:00,101 --> 01:37:03,224
[SPEAKER_09]: I think some of his others we already touched on, but I wanted to definitely bring this one up.

1355
01:37:03,725 --> 01:37:08,570
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some rumors going around this week that Zynga is going to split from Facebook.

1356
01:37:08,590 --> 01:37:16,038
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is actually something I think Alan had brought up with me the other night, actually talking about some of the splits that were going on with...

1357
01:37:17,159 --> 01:37:17,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Zynga Zynga

1358
01:37:32,236 --> 01:37:35,157
[SPEAKER_09]: They are actually wanting to launch their own social gaming network.

1359
01:37:35,337 --> 01:37:41,678
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's because there's tensions between Zynga and Facebook because... Well, Facebook just implemented these whole token things recently.

1360
01:37:41,758 --> 01:37:44,719
[SPEAKER_09]: They basically want to kind of go with the Apple methodology.

1361
01:37:44,739 --> 01:37:47,379
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what it had to be said because I think he was making the comparisons to the Apple thing.

1362
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:53,681
[SPEAKER_09]: This whole Apple methodology of that they want such a big cut of the profits, but maybe...

1363
01:37:55,422 --> 01:37:57,985
[SPEAKER_09]: and maybe they shouldn't be entitled to that.

1364
01:37:58,045 --> 01:37:58,366
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1365
01:37:58,806 --> 01:38:03,813
[SPEAKER_09]: So apparently, yeah, Zynga's wanting to split off from Facebook.

1366
01:38:04,133 --> 01:38:08,880
[SPEAKER_09]: However, Facebook is trying to pressure them into a long-term deal, trying to strong-arm them.

1367
01:38:09,441 --> 01:38:11,003
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess there was an all-hands meeting at Zynga.

1368
01:38:11,663 --> 01:38:16,386
[SPEAKER_09]: I personally think they would be completely fucking stupid to split off from Facebook.

1369
01:38:16,786 --> 01:38:23,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if they do, they're just another Pogo.com, iWin, or one of those other game network websites.

1370
01:38:23,630 --> 01:38:24,851
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't think they're going to stick out.

1371
01:38:24,911 --> 01:38:28,353
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, yeah, they have Farmville, but people play Farmville because it's a Facebook game.

1372
01:38:28,713 --> 01:38:30,614
[SPEAKER_09]: And they can use all those integrations with Facebook.

1373
01:38:30,874 --> 01:38:32,995
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they would just be kind of ridiculous to do that.

1374
01:38:33,035 --> 01:38:34,496
[SPEAKER_09]: They'd be committing suicide.

1375
01:38:35,397 --> 01:38:37,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that I'd really care if they did do that.

1376
01:38:37,598 --> 01:38:37,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1377
01:38:37,978 --> 01:38:40,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Retro Rear View Retro Rear View

1378
01:38:58,058 --> 01:38:59,259
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that.

1379
01:38:59,279 --> 01:38:59,679
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that.

1380
01:38:59,739 --> 01:39:00,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Retro Rearview.

1381
01:39:01,039 --> 01:39:05,121
[SPEAKER_09]: And this week is all about, I have never fucking heard of this, the Marty.

1382
01:39:05,721 --> 01:39:07,182
[SPEAKER_09]: The FM Towns Marty.

1383
01:39:07,202 --> 01:39:10,884
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a Japanese computer in 1991 by Fujitsu.

1384
01:39:11,284 --> 01:39:15,786
[SPEAKER_09]: And Dark to See tells us a whole lot of information about that at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1385
01:39:16,006 --> 01:39:17,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Actual content on our website, OMG.

1386
01:39:19,307 --> 01:39:19,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty awesome.

1387
01:39:19,928 --> 01:39:22,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks to all the folks that contribute at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1388
01:39:24,243 --> 01:39:28,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter.com slash OLR, add us, be our friend, yay, we like friends

1389
01:39:48,101 --> 01:39:49,862
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1390
01:40:12,653 --> 01:40:13,473
[SPEAKER_07]: So I watched it.

1391
01:40:13,713 --> 01:40:17,156
[SPEAKER_07]: The positives on it, at least Ken looks like Ken in this one.

1392
01:40:17,336 --> 01:40:19,737
[SPEAKER_07]: And Ryu, or Ryu, I guess.

1393
01:40:22,019 --> 01:40:22,799
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I guess.

1394
01:40:23,140 --> 01:40:27,122
[SPEAKER_07]: But he looks, compared, because there were two Street Fighter short films.

1395
01:40:27,282 --> 01:40:31,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Both happen to be in a forest, both with Ryu and Ken.

1396
01:40:33,206 --> 01:40:35,648
[SPEAKER_07]: But props to them for nailing the appearance of Ken.

1397
01:40:36,549 --> 01:40:37,409
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty cool.

1398
01:40:38,430 --> 01:40:39,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Ryu, not so much.

1399
01:40:40,271 --> 01:40:41,592
[SPEAKER_07]: And the effects in it.

1400
01:40:42,032 --> 01:40:42,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Eh, they're alright.

1401
01:40:44,194 --> 01:40:47,436
[SPEAKER_07]: The other Street Fighter film... For a fan film, pretty good, I thought.

1402
01:40:48,517 --> 01:40:50,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Better than anything I could do, that's for damn sure.

1403
01:40:50,138 --> 01:41:03,047
[SPEAKER_07]: The one I liked better, though, was actually the Street Fighter Beginnings End, and for me, I liked the way it was shot better, and the effects were kind of cool, but Ken looks stupid, because...

1404
01:41:03,627 --> 01:41:04,308
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1405
01:41:12,546 --> 01:41:13,307
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1406
01:41:43,091 --> 01:41:45,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I watched that last night.

1407
01:42:05,924 --> 01:42:26,733
[SPEAKER_07]: and Wiley was kind of weird looking but overall it was kind of cool might be fun to check it out but wish there was a little bit more polish on it I guess but hell but they're fan projects exactly it's a fan project and you know good job for them it's just you know some of the stuff just

1408
01:42:28,234 --> 01:42:45,716
[SPEAKER_07]: you know some of the characters were kind of like damn I wish you know this was because they had some of those renders that people were doing for like some of the Mega Man 2 characters and it just looked awesome I just kind of wish they were doing the same thing with these guys but hey props to them it was pretty cool

1409
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:48,541
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1410
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:04,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, apparently it is coming back.

1411
01:43:04,382 --> 01:43:08,606
[SPEAKER_09]: It was originally going to come out fall of 2009 against DJ Hero, but it was delayed.

1412
01:43:09,226 --> 01:43:12,169
[SPEAKER_09]: The game is now set to come out on June 26th in Europe.

1413
01:43:12,429 --> 01:43:13,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, that's my birthday.

1414
01:43:14,091 --> 01:43:24,440
[SPEAKER_09]: No word about a North American release yet, so I should state this is right now a Europe-only game, which makes sense because unfortunately this type of music has a much better following over there than it does here.

1415
01:43:24,580 --> 01:43:28,164
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't know, I'd be a little worried if this thing would even come out over here.

1416
01:43:28,724 --> 01:43:31,665
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some new screenshots that are posted of the game.

1417
01:43:32,025 --> 01:43:34,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, there's no note markers.

1418
01:43:34,166 --> 01:43:40,589
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like you do more of like a twist thing where you kind of like maybe go through these tunnels and maybe point at things.

1419
01:43:41,329 --> 01:43:43,330
[SPEAKER_09]: You would gesture maybe to glow.

1420
01:43:43,410 --> 01:43:45,511
[SPEAKER_09]: We really don't know what the hell this game is about.

1421
01:43:45,871 --> 01:43:47,092
[SPEAKER_09]: But we do have song lists.

1422
01:43:47,392 --> 01:43:47,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Woohoo!

1423
01:43:48,152 --> 01:43:49,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1424
01:44:12,940 --> 01:44:14,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Floatation by Vincent D'Amore.

1425
01:44:14,521 --> 01:44:16,363
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one of my favorite 2DX songs they ever did.

1426
01:44:16,703 --> 01:44:17,664
[SPEAKER_09]: That is going to be in this game.

1427
01:44:17,964 --> 01:44:18,945
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of cool.

1428
01:44:19,085 --> 01:44:21,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Stringer by Riva.

1429
01:44:21,807 --> 01:44:23,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Push is in the game.

1430
01:44:23,688 --> 01:44:28,791
[SPEAKER_09]: There's just lots and lots of those trancy bands that you probably hear on his podcast all in this game.

1431
01:44:28,871 --> 01:44:31,213
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, it looks pretty cool.

1432
01:44:31,253 --> 01:44:34,616
[SPEAKER_09]: It's too bad that the game might only come out in Europe, but I guess since we have some...

1433
01:44:35,496 --> 01:44:43,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Listeners over there, I guess you get something we don't, so I don't want to hear all that bitching about that we get all the games, because I don't know if we'll ever get that one.

1434
01:44:44,165 --> 01:44:44,625
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see though.

1435
01:44:46,066 --> 01:44:47,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, DarkSakura.

1436
01:44:49,410 --> 01:44:56,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yes, this is actually, and I'm debating with myself because I want them, but I'm probably not going to get them.

1437
01:44:57,133 --> 01:45:06,661
[SPEAKER_15]: They are, um, they made little, um, River City Ransom characters, or as the original was, the hot-blooded downtown story.

1438
01:45:07,241 --> 01:45:08,242
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're so cute!

1439
01:45:08,622 --> 01:45:13,206
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, they actually were shown at the Treasure Festa show going on in Japan.

1440
01:45:13,847 --> 01:45:23,475
[SPEAKER_15]: Little, um, custom kits that are, um, they have, like, the two main guys and then some of the other guys that you can beat up to.

1441
01:45:24,495 --> 01:45:24,896
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um,

1442
01:45:25,496 --> 01:45:26,397
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just so cute.

1443
01:45:26,698 --> 01:45:28,419
[SPEAKER_15]: It's put up by Tomopop.

1444
01:45:30,642 --> 01:45:31,342
[SPEAKER_15]: They're adorable.

1445
01:45:32,524 --> 01:45:35,667
[SPEAKER_15]: And no, it's not River City Ransom technically.

1446
01:45:35,687 --> 01:45:41,673
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I said, it's a hot-blooded downtown story, but it's got all kinds of cute little guys and it's adorable.

1447
01:45:43,675 --> 01:45:44,055
[SPEAKER_15]: I want.

1448
01:45:45,917 --> 01:45:46,498
[SPEAKER_09]: They look cute.

1449
01:45:49,553 --> 01:45:55,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Team Fortress 2 The Engineer is finally getting its update thanks to a teaser trailer that was released.

1450
01:45:56,460 --> 01:46:03,288
[SPEAKER_07]: No word exactly on what upgrades he's going to be getting, but there's a lot of stuff that if you read between the lines...

1451
01:46:05,530 --> 01:46:10,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the stuff that you see in the background in the video that perhaps is going to be being added.

1452
01:46:10,993 --> 01:46:17,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Including, they have some sort of Iron Man type of helmet thing on the workbench.

1453
01:46:17,517 --> 01:46:20,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Some sort of robotic arm in a blueprint.

1454
01:46:21,179 --> 01:46:29,044
[SPEAKER_07]: So, no word exactly on when the update is coming, but it is kind of neat that they keep adding updates to this game.

1455
01:46:32,597 --> 01:46:34,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that game's like three years old at this point, isn't it?

1456
01:46:34,966 --> 01:46:36,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's extremely old.

1457
01:46:38,166 --> 01:46:38,446
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1458
01:46:38,806 --> 01:46:46,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, a game that's rather new but about something, oh, very old-fashioned for all of us is a game called Babymaker Extreme.

1459
01:46:46,470 --> 01:46:48,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, there is a trailer out for Babymaker Extreme.

1460
01:46:48,871 --> 01:46:51,892
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess the game is actually out on Xbox Live Marketplace right now.

1461
01:46:51,912 --> 01:46:52,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1462
01:46:53,013 --> 01:46:53,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Community games.

1463
01:46:53,933 --> 01:46:54,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry.

1464
01:46:54,673 --> 01:46:55,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's what I meant.

1465
01:46:55,234 --> 01:46:55,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Community games.

1466
01:46:56,054 --> 01:46:56,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Indie games, whatever.

1467
01:46:57,375 --> 01:46:58,935
[SPEAKER_09]: 80 Microsoft points for this game.

1468
01:46:59,776 --> 01:47:04,418
[SPEAKER_09]: And let me just kind of play the trailer for you guys and describe what's going on in Babymaker Extreme.

1469
01:47:04,498 --> 01:47:05,758
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's not just sex.

1470
01:47:06,059 --> 01:47:06,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay?

1471
01:47:06,419 --> 01:47:06,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1472
01:47:07,099 --> 01:47:09,301
[SPEAKER_09]: But it is about the joy of giving birth.

1473
01:47:09,361 --> 01:47:12,283
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, you push A to experience the miracle of childbirth.

1474
01:47:13,785 --> 01:47:17,187
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, you control your breathing in this game just like a real mother.

1475
01:47:17,628 --> 01:47:20,450
[SPEAKER_09]: And you use the L-T-R-T to breathe as you go back and forth.

1476
01:47:20,490 --> 01:47:21,851
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's like to build out the power.

1477
01:47:22,392 --> 01:47:23,893
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you get ready to push.

1478
01:47:25,294 --> 01:47:28,377
[SPEAKER_09]: And you hit B as fast as you can to get ready to push.

1479
01:47:28,777 --> 01:47:30,318
[SPEAKER_09]: You just keep slamming on that B button.

1480
01:47:32,140 --> 01:47:33,341
[SPEAKER_09]: And then what's next?

1481
01:47:34,912 --> 01:47:55,374
[SPEAKER_07]: probably screaming for drugs and then a c-section no no it gets better well they don't show you what happens next but I believe featuring avatars I believe you push the a button and the baby goes flying through the air no featuring avatars but have you seen did you watch the whole trailer that's right you have your avatars get born out of this woman

1482
01:47:57,788 --> 01:48:00,870
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can give them scuba gear and shoes and a vest.

1483
01:48:01,030 --> 01:48:02,431
[SPEAKER_09]: And they go shooting.

1484
01:48:02,471 --> 01:48:04,852
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like one of those rocket-like launching games, right?

1485
01:48:04,872 --> 01:48:05,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Baby Launcher?

1486
01:48:05,712 --> 01:48:07,373
[SPEAKER_09]: The baby goes flying through the air, right?

1487
01:48:07,994 --> 01:48:08,754
[SPEAKER_16]: Kick the baby!

1488
01:48:08,854 --> 01:48:09,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing.

1489
01:48:09,474 --> 01:48:10,295
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't kick the baby.

1490
01:48:11,095 --> 01:48:12,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, that sounds like it's worth a buck.

1491
01:48:13,016 --> 01:48:14,157
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, one whole dollar.

1492
01:48:14,477 --> 01:48:15,338
[SPEAKER_15]: That's just awful.

1493
01:48:16,998 --> 01:48:17,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Awfully funny.

1494
01:48:18,339 --> 01:48:19,760
[SPEAKER_09]: You should have my wife play it.

1495
01:48:19,940 --> 01:48:20,340
[SPEAKER_09]: You should.

1496
01:48:21,181 --> 01:48:22,341
[SPEAKER_09]: How far along is she now?

1497
01:48:22,782 --> 01:48:24,302
[SPEAKER_09]: She is 25 weeks.

1498
01:48:24,483 --> 01:48:27,104
[SPEAKER_09]: She should be kind of practicing for the big day.

1499
01:48:27,799 --> 01:48:29,379
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, what's in the email bag this week?

1500
01:48:29,419 --> 01:48:29,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Some crap.

1501
01:48:29,740 --> 01:48:29,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Delete.

1502
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:31,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, that was system spam.

1503
01:48:55,467 --> 01:49:00,633
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a few quickies through the website, so some of them are not letting us know who they are.

1504
01:49:00,653 --> 01:49:01,995
[SPEAKER_15]: This one's from NerdE1.

1505
01:49:04,317 --> 01:49:11,185
[SPEAKER_15]: Though Sky might appreciate checking out a web show called... Oh, he's asking about if you watch The Guild.

1506
01:49:12,398 --> 01:49:13,239
[SPEAKER_09]: The Guild is cute Epic Ness

1507
01:49:32,562 --> 01:49:36,163
[SPEAKER_15]: I wonder if our covers of old NES tunes might be interesting for your radio station.

1508
01:49:36,644 --> 01:49:39,865
[SPEAKER_15]: We remake the music from old games and make them into rock medleys.

1509
01:49:40,505 --> 01:49:42,706
[SPEAKER_15]: We have gotten quite good feedback so far.

1510
01:49:42,786 --> 01:49:45,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Please visit our MySpace and tell me what you think about it.

1511
01:49:45,247 --> 01:49:46,067
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll go ahead and plug it.

1512
01:49:46,307 --> 01:49:47,007
[SPEAKER_07]: MySpace?

1513
01:49:47,407 --> 01:49:47,807
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1514
01:49:47,827 --> 01:49:48,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Who uses MySpace?

1515
01:49:48,688 --> 01:49:51,149
[SPEAKER_15]: First off... Epicness Band.

1516
01:49:51,529 --> 01:49:51,869
[SPEAKER_15]: NES.

1517
01:49:52,782 --> 01:49:53,503
[SPEAKER_09]: And this last one is Shook

1518
01:50:11,485 --> 01:50:13,226
[SPEAKER_15]: By the way, very excellent grammar.

1519
01:50:40,385 --> 01:50:40,725
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1520
01:50:40,885 --> 01:50:42,146
[SPEAKER_15]: Except for a few missing comments.

1521
01:50:42,246 --> 01:50:48,507
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this year, the only difference between last year and this year would be that this year, we don't really know what's coming.

1522
01:50:49,268 --> 01:51:04,092
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we have an idea with some of the stuff that they've talked about already, but I think that this year, they're keeping a lot of it kind of tight to the chest so that there's going to be a lot more surprises, whereas last year, it's kind of like, yeah, we kind of know what you're going to talk about, and there's some things, but I don't know.

1523
01:51:04,232 --> 01:51:08,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Personally, I'm okay with not going to E3 this year because last year, it was just kind of, eh.

1524
01:51:09,073 --> 01:51:10,337
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't what it used to be.

1525
01:51:10,938 --> 01:51:11,540
[SPEAKER_09]: I disagree.

1526
01:51:12,162 --> 01:51:14,347
[SPEAKER_09]: I think our emailer couldn't be more wronger.

1527
01:51:15,905 --> 01:51:40,360
[SPEAKER_09]: To use a term that DarkSakura will appreciate I think that between actually getting to do some hands-on with Natal To see what it's really like Besides just a concept Getting to get hands-on with Move Final Fantasy XIV, Rock Band 3, Portal 2 I think there's a lot of big releases this year That are kind of exciting Whereas last year there wasn't I mean, one of the bigger things there was Halo 3 ODST Which wasn't a game I was really that excited about

1528
01:51:41,060 --> 01:51:46,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, one thing I haven't played is the Halo Reach beta, really, at all, which I guess came out this week.

1529
01:51:47,884 --> 01:51:52,187
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of don't play Halo anymore, thanks to Halo 3 wasn't that great.

1530
01:51:52,407 --> 01:51:54,148
[SPEAKER_09]: So, all right.

1531
01:51:56,029 --> 01:51:57,770
[SPEAKER_09]: So, oh, thank you for that, DarkSakura.

1532
01:51:57,790 --> 01:51:58,370
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate that.

1533
01:51:58,430 --> 01:52:00,772
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura's taking my picture over here while I'm trying to talk.

1534
01:52:00,792 --> 01:52:03,413
[SPEAKER_15]: I was poking your head with a .50 caliber bullet shell.

1535
01:52:03,974 --> 01:52:04,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice, thank you.

1536
01:52:05,254 --> 01:52:09,377
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was going to say, by the way, our youngest documented listener that I know of has actually just turned three.

1537
01:52:09,657 --> 01:52:09,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

1538
01:52:10,837 --> 01:52:11,917
[SPEAKER_15]: He doesn't really pay attention to us.

1539
01:52:11,937 --> 01:52:12,758
[SPEAKER_15]: He just listens sometimes.

1540
01:52:13,018 --> 01:52:18,239
[SPEAKER_09]: BlackWolf in our chatroom wants to point out it's also still a month away and E3 booth lists come out about a week or two before.

1541
01:52:18,899 --> 01:52:19,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

1542
01:52:19,319 --> 01:52:20,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Blizzard could be back this year.

1543
01:52:20,620 --> 01:52:21,280
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't know yet.

1544
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:23,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, Nintendo's got the 3DS.

1545
01:52:23,781 --> 01:52:28,742
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a little antsy about the 3DS because I don't know about how 3D's going to go.

1546
01:52:28,882 --> 01:52:31,182
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, I'm not going to knock it until I've tried it.

1547
01:52:31,483 --> 01:52:32,403
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just a little nervous.

1548
01:52:32,443 --> 01:52:32,803
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all.

1549
01:52:34,449 --> 01:52:35,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so was that it for the emails?

1550
01:52:36,990 --> 01:52:37,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, no.

1551
01:52:37,810 --> 01:52:38,451
[SPEAKER_09]: No, alright.

1552
01:52:39,091 --> 01:52:41,212
[SPEAKER_15]: But I did put that picture up on the website.

1553
01:52:41,872 --> 01:52:42,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Grand, thank you.

1554
01:52:44,653 --> 01:52:46,194
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, it's from Rababababa.

1555
01:52:47,234 --> 01:52:51,216
[SPEAKER_15]: I love the way game politics presents the story of Dave and Buster's new owners.

1556
01:52:51,916 --> 01:52:52,476
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a link there.

1557
01:52:54,457 --> 01:52:54,897
[SPEAKER_09]: P.S.

1558
01:52:55,177 --> 01:52:57,238
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them opened up in Roseville this week.

1559
01:52:57,498 --> 01:52:57,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1560
01:52:57,938 --> 01:53:00,779
[SPEAKER_09]: I drove by and I did not see it, but then I didn't drive that close.

1561
01:53:00,799 --> 01:53:02,180
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in the fountains.

1562
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:03,100
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew it was over there.

1563
01:53:03,120 --> 01:53:05,541
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in the fountains over by... I know what we're talking about.

1564
01:53:05,621 --> 01:53:06,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's in the back.

1565
01:53:06,621 --> 01:53:08,562
[SPEAKER_09]: It's by California Peach Kitchen and all that stuff in the back.

1566
01:53:08,802 --> 01:53:14,824
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking too, because we were over at the Galleria this week, and I was like, I wonder if it's over there, and I'm like, the fountains, where's this?

1567
01:53:14,844 --> 01:53:16,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's how long it's been since I've been over there.

1568
01:53:17,184 --> 01:53:19,445
[SPEAKER_07]: The fountains didn't exist when I went last.

1569
01:53:19,565 --> 01:53:20,065
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nice.

1570
01:53:20,145 --> 01:53:22,206
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little bit too high class for me, but...

1571
01:53:22,426 --> 01:53:23,226
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some nice stuff there.

1572
01:53:23,427 --> 01:53:25,027
[SPEAKER_09]: But did you go to Dave & Buster's, though?

1573
01:53:25,147 --> 01:53:25,548
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not yet.

1574
01:53:25,868 --> 01:53:26,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we'll have to plan that this week.

1575
01:53:26,688 --> 01:53:27,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we'll have to go there.

1576
01:53:27,268 --> 01:53:29,069
[SPEAKER_09]: We should plan an OLR night at Dave & Buster's.

1577
01:53:29,109 --> 01:53:29,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we need to go there.

1578
01:53:29,970 --> 01:53:30,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Fun!

1579
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:31,090
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

1580
01:53:31,251 --> 01:53:31,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

1581
01:53:34,772 --> 01:53:43,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so in the middle of the GP article, it says, In a press release on its site, Oak Hill called the deal an investment in partnership with Dave & Buster's current management team.

1582
01:53:44,217 --> 01:53:44,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Joke.

1583
01:53:45,138 --> 01:53:47,979
[SPEAKER_15]: They soon followed with an email, By the way, you're defired.

1584
01:53:48,219 --> 01:53:48,699
[SPEAKER_15]: All in leet.

1585
01:53:48,980 --> 01:53:49,280
[SPEAKER_15]: End joke.

1586
01:53:50,140 --> 01:53:56,574
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe this marks the beginning of a round of closing of some DMV sites because that's what the new company always does, isn't it?

1587
01:53:57,075 --> 01:53:58,598
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an Arcadiapocalypse.

1588
01:53:58,778 --> 01:54:00,261
[SPEAKER_15]: The Arcadiapocalypse is nigh.

1589
01:54:01,063 --> 01:54:01,444
[SPEAKER_15]: Rababa.

1590
01:54:02,239 --> 01:54:07,022
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of funny because they just opened the one here and now they're already talking about closing certain Dave and Busters.

1591
01:54:07,362 --> 01:54:10,384
[SPEAKER_15]: I like that he signs his name now, Ra-ba-ba.

1592
01:54:11,424 --> 01:54:12,085
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how you say it.

1593
01:54:12,185 --> 01:54:13,165
[SPEAKER_07]: It is, if you think about it.

1594
01:54:13,225 --> 01:54:21,090
[SPEAKER_07]: It's surprising, though, that it is in such close proximity to the Family Fun Center, you know, Golf Land.

1595
01:54:22,030 --> 01:54:24,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully it makes them... And John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza is right around the corner.

1596
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:27,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, their arcade's kind of crap.

1597
01:54:28,134 --> 01:54:30,355
[SPEAKER_14]: But I would say... They do have an Afterburner Climax.

1598
01:54:31,337 --> 01:54:33,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Good for them, but I'm just saying... And an indoor rollercoaster.

1599
01:54:35,980 --> 01:54:36,260
[SPEAKER_07]: They do?

1600
01:54:36,700 --> 01:54:37,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1601
01:54:37,081 --> 01:54:38,642
[SPEAKER_07]: It's for, like, little kids, but yeah.

1602
01:54:39,182 --> 01:54:40,023
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't really count.

1603
01:54:41,884 --> 01:54:46,967
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's interesting to see, because, you know, Dave Busters has a pretty decent arcade.

1604
01:54:47,287 --> 01:54:48,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, there's a lot of ticket games.

1605
01:54:48,928 --> 01:54:54,772
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad, though, I'll be able to use my two power cards that I have from, like, five years ago, which is very exciting.

1606
01:54:57,298 --> 01:54:58,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Those things don't expire, do they?

1607
01:54:59,198 --> 01:55:01,539
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think so, but you might have to get it transferred.

1608
01:55:02,159 --> 01:55:03,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1609
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:07,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, DarkSakura's taking pictures over here and she keeps pointing the camera at me and I don't know why.

1610
01:55:08,801 --> 01:55:10,081
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I know you'll play along.

1611
01:55:10,341 --> 01:55:10,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1612
01:55:12,582 --> 01:55:14,002
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm campier than Loki.

1613
01:55:14,903 --> 01:55:17,723
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm putting up a picture of me poking Rob with the nose condom.

1614
01:55:17,863 --> 01:55:18,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1615
01:55:19,204 --> 01:55:20,184
[SPEAKER_15]: The nose tampon, sorry.

1616
01:55:20,744 --> 01:55:44,105
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Beavis and Butthead I understand Mr. McVicar has made a little arrangement with you guys Yeah, a little probation You see, class, Beavis and Butthead here are not allowed to laugh for a whole week

1617
01:55:45,034 --> 01:55:54,182
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, and if they do laugh, they'll be expelled and they'll have to go to Hope High School where they'll get their asses kicked on a daily basis by all the other delinquents.

1618
01:55:56,524 --> 01:56:01,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was real glad to hear that because this is Sex Education Week.

1619
01:56:01,808 --> 01:56:03,690
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, Sex Ed Week.

1620
01:56:04,892 --> 01:56:06,673
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be talking about the penis.

1621
01:56:07,754 --> 01:56:09,796
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be talking about the vagina.

1622
01:56:10,416 --> 01:56:12,218
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that's funny, butthead?

1623
01:56:12,518 --> 01:56:15,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you find it amusing that we'll be talking about the testicles?

1624
01:56:16,961 --> 01:56:28,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we're also going to be talking about venereal disease, sexual intercourse, and we will definitely be spending a lot of time talking about masturbation.

1625
01:56:33,707 --> 01:56:36,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now that that's out of the way, let's take roll.

1626
01:56:36,892 --> 01:56:37,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Butt kiss!

1627
01:56:37,934 --> 01:56:38,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Here.

1628
01:56:40,017 --> 01:56:40,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaylord!

1629
01:56:41,599 --> 01:56:41,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Iron!

1630
01:56:46,667 --> 01:56:47,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we're so mature.

1631
01:56:49,194 --> 01:57:02,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to realize, especially after getting that email from the 13-year-old that listens to the show, a lot of you didn't grow up with Beavis and Butthead, and that kind of makes me sad for you, because Beavis and Butthead was pretty fucking amazing.

1632
01:57:02,303 --> 01:57:03,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, it really was.

1633
01:57:05,285 --> 01:57:06,865
[SPEAKER_15]: It really summed up a generation.

1634
01:57:06,945 --> 01:57:07,726
[SPEAKER_09]: It really did.

1635
01:57:07,806 --> 01:57:13,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, if you want to know what life was like for us, just go watch an old episode of Beavis and Butthead.

1636
01:57:13,227 --> 01:57:14,327
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty summed up.

1637
01:57:14,367 --> 01:57:18,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, back when MTV would actually play music videos and everything else.

1638
01:57:18,668 --> 01:57:19,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Good stuff.

1639
01:57:20,449 --> 01:57:26,090
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's get into a little bit of angst, because, you know, sometimes we get a little angry here on Orange Lounge Radio, and we have to do this segment.

1640
01:57:26,130 --> 01:57:27,270
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just tradition for 366 weeks now.

1641
01:57:27,290 --> 01:57:28,191
[SPEAKER_09]: The F-Years of the Week!

1642
01:57:45,258 --> 01:57:53,216
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, F you to the sudden fifth coughing that I have and also for my finger for starting to trigger again even though I had it operated on last year.

1643
01:57:56,449 --> 01:58:02,613
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to people that drift in and out of lanes, especially people that try to hit me with their car.

1644
01:58:03,073 --> 01:58:10,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Also those people that like to make left turns by kind of slightly going to the right portion of their lane or outside of their lane and then making left turn.

1645
01:58:11,359 --> 01:58:13,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Same goes for people that make the right turns that way as well.

1646
01:58:14,220 --> 01:58:17,883
[SPEAKER_07]: And to this old grandma that we saw today who decided that, you know, the...

1647
01:58:19,150 --> 01:58:19,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey!

1648
01:58:19,330 --> 01:58:19,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Oops.

1649
01:58:19,970 --> 01:58:20,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that it?

1650
01:58:20,711 --> 01:58:21,271
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1651
01:58:21,351 --> 01:58:21,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1652
01:58:40,057 --> 01:58:43,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to say a quick F you to my teeth.

1653
01:58:43,619 --> 01:58:46,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I went to a Mamma Mia sing-along this week.

1654
01:58:46,841 --> 01:58:48,281
[SPEAKER_09]: And don't judge me.

1655
01:58:49,102 --> 01:58:49,882
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a lot of fun.

1656
01:58:50,122 --> 01:58:50,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up.

1657
01:58:50,662 --> 01:58:51,063
[SPEAKER_09]: It was great.

1658
01:58:51,143 --> 01:58:52,483
[SPEAKER_09]: They did it all Rocky Horror Picture Show style.

1659
01:58:52,723 --> 01:58:54,944
[SPEAKER_09]: But one of the things they did is that one of the songs is Honey Honey.

1660
01:58:55,265 --> 01:58:58,186
[SPEAKER_09]: And they actually had Biddle Honey available as part of Honey Honey.

1661
01:58:58,726 --> 01:58:58,846
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

1662
01:59:01,954 --> 01:59:07,138
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually ate the bit of honey during Honey Honey and part of my tooth chipped off on the bit of honey.

1663
01:59:07,619 --> 01:59:08,359
[SPEAKER_09]: One of my back teeth.

1664
01:59:08,759 --> 01:59:14,964
[SPEAKER_09]: But I had like tons of cavities when I was a kid and I think like a lot of the fillings now that I'm like 30 are cracking out.

1665
01:59:15,485 --> 01:59:16,906
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's exactly what happened.

1666
01:59:16,926 --> 01:59:19,228
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the filling broke off and took the corner of my tooth with it.

1667
01:59:19,728 --> 01:59:24,852
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm really hoping it doesn't start to hurt because something else about me, I really hate going to the dentist.

1668
01:59:24,892 --> 01:59:28,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I really, really hate going to the dentist.

1669
01:59:28,034 --> 01:59:30,096
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what will help though if it does start to hurt wrong?

1670
01:59:30,136 --> 01:59:31,057
[SPEAKER_15]: Just a natural remedy.

1671
01:59:32,037 --> 01:59:32,458
[SPEAKER_15]: Chin!

1672
01:59:33,418 --> 01:59:37,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm just, you know, I can't, like, if it starts to hurt, I'm gonna have to do something about it.

1673
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:39,881
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't let it go, because it will never, like, stop hurting.

1674
01:59:40,522 --> 01:59:41,802
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, yeah.

1675
01:59:42,343 --> 01:59:42,963
[SPEAKER_09]: A few to my teeth.

1676
01:59:45,702 --> 01:59:47,504
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to fillings we got as kids too.

1677
01:59:48,285 --> 01:59:49,526
[SPEAKER_15]: I never had a filling as a kid.

1678
01:59:49,766 --> 01:59:53,790
[SPEAKER_15]: Then again, I didn't go to the dentist until I was an adult from the time I was in third grade.

1679
01:59:53,970 --> 01:59:54,291
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

1680
01:59:55,612 --> 01:59:56,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Lucky you.

1681
01:59:57,334 --> 01:59:58,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, that's it for the FUs of the week.

1682
01:59:58,876 --> 02:00:03,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get into some other stories and then we'll get into the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR

1683
02:00:05,262 --> 02:00:12,989
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a new Bomani game that apparently came out back in February in Japan, of course, because I'm not over here.

1684
02:00:13,690 --> 02:00:26,682
[SPEAKER_07]: And unfortunately, I didn't really know much about it, but it's a new game called Utachi, and it looks like poppin' music, but kind of like almost like a light version of poppin' music with only three buttons, because you play it in kind of like the book...

1685
02:00:27,122 --> 02:00:29,044
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1686
02:00:50,280 --> 02:01:13,378
[SPEAKER_07]: and tap and tap and quickly slide for yellow the green notes sound a bit tricky you have to tap once and hit it's tap once it hits the bottom and then slide the stylus up and down until the note ends so it's like a new rhythm is a game and the characters definitely look like they're from poppin music it's no beat and groovy though

1687
02:01:16,676 --> 02:01:20,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it looks like it'll be better than beaten groovy, but I don't know.

1688
02:01:21,565 --> 02:01:23,709
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just not excited about these games anymore.

1689
02:01:23,729 --> 02:01:25,372
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I agree.

1690
02:01:26,937 --> 02:01:27,798
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's sad though?

1691
02:01:28,418 --> 02:01:38,964
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I showed you there was like a homebrew DS game that really kind of gave me an idea of how they could do like a DDR type of game on the DS and it was pretty awesome.

1692
02:01:39,024 --> 02:01:51,831
[SPEAKER_07]: It involved like kind of making gestures with the stylus and just really cool the way it kind of worked but it was with like a par-a-par type of video or something that they did it with.

1693
02:01:52,492 --> 02:01:54,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Still would be really cool though to implement.

1694
02:01:57,054 --> 02:02:03,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, one more story for you guys tonight, and I don't think this guy will be making a Parapara game, but you never know.

1695
02:02:04,120 --> 02:02:07,123
[SPEAKER_09]: George Romero, you guys know who he is, right?

1696
02:02:07,183 --> 02:02:12,627
[SPEAKER_09]: He did zombie movies, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, you know, all these awesome zombie movies.

1697
02:02:13,608 --> 02:02:17,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, George Romero recently talked to the website Destructoid and said...

1698
02:02:18,052 --> 02:02:19,033
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to do a game.

1699
02:02:19,473 --> 02:02:21,034
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to work with a gamer on it.

1700
02:02:21,474 --> 02:02:25,656
[SPEAKER_09]: But everyone who has ever approached me, it's always been, sell us your name and go home.

1701
02:02:25,856 --> 02:02:27,577
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't particularly want to do that.

1702
02:02:28,317 --> 02:02:32,439
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, and then, of course, there's the whole Dead Rising thing, which was definitely influenced.

1703
02:02:32,459 --> 02:02:34,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think one of the companies he said he wanted to work with was Capcom.

1704
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:35,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, they already did it.

1705
02:02:36,361 --> 02:02:36,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1706
02:02:37,642 --> 02:02:41,523
[SPEAKER_09]: So he actually said, he admitted, I'm not a gamer, so I don't know what excites a gamer.

1707
02:02:41,644 --> 02:02:42,024
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1708
02:02:42,284 --> 02:02:43,885
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I could come up with a good story.

1709
02:02:44,405 --> 02:02:44,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Zombies.

1710
02:02:44,965 --> 02:02:45,946
[SPEAKER_09]: People like zombies.

1711
02:02:46,046 --> 02:02:46,526
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1712
02:02:48,490 --> 02:02:57,036
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure you're not very familiar with the zombie phenomenon, but I'm sure if you do your research there, George Romero, that you'll be fine.

1713
02:02:57,176 --> 02:03:00,478
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as he makes the right arrangement with the right game company, it'll be fine.

1714
02:03:00,538 --> 02:03:05,662
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as he doesn't partner up with the wrong game company, it'll be great.

1715
02:03:06,673 --> 02:03:09,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so that's it for our scripted stories tonight.

1716
02:03:09,736 --> 02:03:15,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to the phones at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1717
02:03:15,342 --> 02:03:16,524
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to take your calls.

1718
02:03:17,064 --> 02:03:19,487
[SPEAKER_09]: The last few weeks have been a little dry, so I don't know what's going on.

1719
02:03:19,847 --> 02:03:21,489
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see if we actually get some phone calls tonight.

1720
02:03:21,870 --> 02:03:25,453
[SPEAKER_09]: In the meantime, let's see if there's anyone that has last minute stories.

1721
02:03:28,076 --> 02:03:28,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh...

1722
02:03:30,549 --> 02:03:31,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the small stuff.

1723
02:03:32,871 --> 02:03:36,494
[SPEAKER_07]: They're doing another Xbox 360 bundle instead of the elites with two free games.

1724
02:03:36,514 --> 02:03:39,696
[SPEAKER_07]: They're also going to have an Xbox 360 arcade system with two free games.

1725
02:03:40,277 --> 02:03:45,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Those free games, of course, are Banjo-Kazooie and Viva Pinata, the first Viva Pinata game.

1726
02:03:45,901 --> 02:03:48,623
[SPEAKER_07]: But hey, two free games is better than none.

1727
02:03:48,783 --> 02:03:49,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Free games are free, so.

1728
02:03:50,264 --> 02:03:51,345
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's go to the phones.

1729
02:03:51,385 --> 02:03:51,886
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a call.

1730
02:03:51,926 --> 02:03:52,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1731
02:03:52,946 --> 02:03:53,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1732
02:03:54,668 --> 02:03:56,129
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the one and only Ranma.

1733
02:03:56,169 --> 02:03:57,770
[SPEAKER_09]: How's everybody doing tonight?

1734
02:03:57,890 --> 02:03:58,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Not bad.

1735
02:03:58,351 --> 02:03:58,691
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

1736
02:04:00,382 --> 02:04:04,747
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm pretty good, I just came back from a job interview, but that's not the reason why I called.

1737
02:04:04,807 --> 02:04:06,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, good luck with that, hope it works out.

1738
02:04:06,749 --> 02:04:07,890
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the reason you called tonight?

1739
02:04:08,851 --> 02:04:18,921
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, before I get into it, to reiterate what was said in the chat room earlier, I'm surprised you wouldn't go around zombie killing to the theme of the Golden Girls extended remix.

1740
02:04:20,783 --> 02:04:29,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, you know, I just, I have to think if Push came to shove, the thing is about the Golden Girls, there was really only that one song, and that's not enough to really fill up a whole CD.

1741
02:04:30,168 --> 02:04:33,750
[SPEAKER_09]: But maybe if we could somehow get that song on the soundtrack to Lost Highway, then we'd be good.

1742
02:04:35,071 --> 02:04:36,592
[SPEAKER_12]: Or maybe audio clips from the show?

1743
02:04:38,613 --> 02:04:40,154
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I'd want to hear that.

1744
02:04:41,334 --> 02:04:42,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that make sense?

1745
02:04:42,655 --> 02:04:45,016
[SPEAKER_12]: You know we're just busting your balls because we love you, right?

1746
02:04:45,156 --> 02:04:46,157
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I know, I know.

1747
02:04:46,217 --> 02:04:47,197
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are weird.

1748
02:04:47,538 --> 02:04:47,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, no.

1749
02:04:50,678 --> 02:04:53,960
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually sat down and watched the Mega Man fan film Friday night Yeah, Friday night Uh-huh

1750
02:05:20,087 --> 02:05:20,587
[SPEAKER_12]: I liked it.

1751
02:05:20,707 --> 02:05:27,674
[SPEAKER_12]: I was expecting something really half-assed, rushed project, but it turned out to be much better than I thought it would be.

1752
02:05:28,195 --> 02:05:31,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Without spoiling it too bad, what in a nutshell happens in this movie?

1753
02:05:35,402 --> 02:05:38,065
[SPEAKER_12]: It's sort of like a retelling of the first game.

1754
02:05:39,929 --> 02:05:41,210
[SPEAKER_12]: with Elements of the Third.

1755
02:05:41,730 --> 02:05:48,093
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm surprised Capcom isn't trying to shut this shit down.

1756
02:05:48,113 --> 02:05:51,675
[SPEAKER_12]: Did Capcom endorse this or are they just hoping?

1757
02:06:04,551 --> 02:06:13,735
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually have no idea, but I don't think they would shut it down because I don't know if you remember a few years back at, I think it was DragonCon or some convention in the South.

1758
02:06:14,355 --> 02:06:22,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Might have been SEC, I don't know, but reps from Capcom was there to watch a, I think it was a Devil May Cry fan film or something like that.

1759
02:06:24,299 --> 02:06:25,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, so this has kind of been done before.

1760
02:06:26,041 --> 02:06:28,804
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess the other movies talked about tonight, you know, Street Fighter movie.

1761
02:06:29,084 --> 02:06:34,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Capcom is apparently just these grounds for, you know, making fan movies.

1762
02:06:36,110 --> 02:06:36,951
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw Legacy.

1763
02:06:36,991 --> 02:06:38,753
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought that was great, but I didn't see the other one, though.

1764
02:06:41,195 --> 02:06:44,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess maybe I'll have to check out the movie too.

1765
02:06:44,558 --> 02:06:44,838
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1766
02:06:44,858 --> 02:06:50,263
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not a big fan of that particular website that made it, but I guess I can try and just sit down and watch it.

1767
02:06:50,283 --> 02:06:50,783
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't make it.

1768
02:06:50,843 --> 02:06:51,644
[SPEAKER_09]: They're hosting it.

1769
02:06:52,124 --> 02:06:52,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

1770
02:06:52,424 --> 02:06:53,105
[SPEAKER_12]: They're hosting it.

1771
02:06:53,185 --> 02:06:54,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, then that's different.

1772
02:06:55,847 --> 02:06:58,950
[SPEAKER_12]: And their official soundtrack to the fan film is also available.

1773
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:05,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the soundtrack not clips from the game, or is it arranged stuff from the game, or is it all original stuff?

1774
02:07:06,524 --> 02:07:07,404
[SPEAKER_12]: All original.

1775
02:07:07,444 --> 02:07:11,107
[SPEAKER_12]: This one guy did original recordings for the whole movie.

1776
02:07:11,967 --> 02:07:18,711
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a couple of tracks he did do remixes of, but it's like dark-themed.

1777
02:07:18,851 --> 02:07:22,153
[SPEAKER_12]: It kind of reminded me of the music from Lord in the Rings, in a way.

1778
02:07:22,514 --> 02:07:23,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1779
02:07:23,394 --> 02:07:23,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Enya?

1780
02:07:23,995 --> 02:07:24,255
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1781
02:07:25,382 --> 02:07:26,003
[SPEAKER_12]: Something like that.

1782
02:07:26,643 --> 02:07:29,846
[SPEAKER_12]: The fan film itself isn't like comedy chop socket.

1783
02:07:29,886 --> 02:07:32,148
[SPEAKER_12]: It's more like drama.

1784
02:07:32,388 --> 02:07:34,190
[SPEAKER_12]: It's more of a drama, darkish theme.

1785
02:07:34,791 --> 02:07:40,776
[SPEAKER_12]: Plus the fact that the science, Wily and Light are much younger than they're supposed to be.

1786
02:07:41,989 --> 02:07:45,111
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw in chat says Capcom did endorse the Street Fighter legacy.

1787
02:07:45,351 --> 02:07:51,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat.OrangeLampTrader.com Capcom's pretty good with their fan base, though.

1788
02:07:51,554 --> 02:07:53,515
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got a blog that reaches out to fans.

1789
02:07:53,656 --> 02:07:55,657
[SPEAKER_09]: They try not to be jerks about stuff.

1790
02:07:57,409 --> 02:08:01,730
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know, at the same time, when Nintendo pulled that Zelda film, I didn't really think they were being jerks.

1791
02:08:01,810 --> 02:08:06,552
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they have a right to protect their IP, so if Capcom wanted to be jerks, they have a right.

1792
02:08:07,632 --> 02:08:08,413
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1793
02:08:08,513 --> 02:08:15,675
[SPEAKER_12]: If Nintendo's going to pull that fan film, at least let us know about the supposed Metroid film that's supposed to be coming out.

1794
02:08:15,695 --> 02:08:17,315
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been hearing about it for the last two, three years.

1795
02:08:17,335 --> 02:08:18,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Good luck with that.

1796
02:08:18,116 --> 02:08:19,016
[SPEAKER_09]: No, ain't happening.

1797
02:08:19,396 --> 02:08:19,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Ain't happening.

1798
02:08:19,816 --> 02:08:20,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know.

1799
02:08:22,257 --> 02:08:25,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is too bad, because if it did happen, maybe they'd sell more copies of the game.

1800
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:26,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

1801
02:08:27,841 --> 02:08:28,101
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1802
02:08:28,161 --> 02:08:31,402
[SPEAKER_09]: And SJ1 and Matt wants to point out that the Megas did the closing music.

1803
02:08:31,662 --> 02:08:34,684
[SPEAKER_09]: So there is at least still some other Mega Man community tie-ins.

1804
02:08:35,184 --> 02:08:36,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

1805
02:08:36,184 --> 02:08:36,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely.

1806
02:08:36,845 --> 02:08:37,065
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1807
02:08:37,085 --> 02:08:38,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Ranma, we got to let you go.

1808
02:08:38,085 --> 02:08:39,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any other final thoughts before we let you go?

1809
02:08:41,307 --> 02:08:43,568
[SPEAKER_09]: If you like Street Fighter stuff, check out Street Fighter High.

1810
02:08:43,668 --> 02:08:44,468
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I got to say.

1811
02:08:45,048 --> 02:08:45,349
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1812
02:08:45,389 --> 02:08:45,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Will do.

1813
02:08:45,669 --> 02:08:47,049
[SPEAKER_15]: Dan was watching that the other day.

1814
02:08:47,189 --> 02:08:48,210
[SPEAKER_15]: It's amusing.

1815
02:08:49,090 --> 02:08:49,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it is.

1816
02:08:50,031 --> 02:08:50,251
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1817
02:08:50,291 --> 02:08:51,091
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see you soon, Ranma.

1818
02:08:51,111 --> 02:08:52,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you still coming out here like in July?

1819
02:08:53,810 --> 02:08:56,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, we gotta talk about that, yeah.

1820
02:08:56,631 --> 02:08:58,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, sounds good.

1821
02:08:58,352 --> 02:08:59,233
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, all right, take care.

1822
02:09:00,073 --> 02:09:00,513
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll chat.

1823
02:09:00,533 --> 02:09:06,676
[SPEAKER_09]: 877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, is Orange Lounge Radio.

1824
02:09:07,296 --> 02:09:09,798
[SPEAKER_09]: While we wait for other calls, do we have any other last-minute stories that came up?

1825
02:09:11,218 --> 02:09:12,539
[SPEAKER_13]: Not particularly, I don't think.

1826
02:09:13,019 --> 02:09:14,440
[SPEAKER_09]: But Joel, too, come in the WiiWare.

1827
02:09:15,220 --> 02:09:16,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Woo!

1828
02:09:16,561 --> 02:09:17,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay for that.

1829
02:09:17,241 --> 02:09:18,081
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we got another call.

1830
02:09:18,121 --> 02:09:19,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1831
02:09:19,102 --> 02:09:19,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1832
02:09:21,498 --> 02:09:22,719
[SPEAKER_10]: One and only Legend of Zaku.

1833
02:09:23,179 --> 02:09:24,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Legend of Zaku.

1834
02:09:24,359 --> 02:09:24,679
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up?

1835
02:09:24,719 --> 02:09:25,200
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind?

1836
02:09:26,420 --> 02:09:26,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing much.

1837
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Just recovering from Mother's Day gorging of food.

1838
02:09:30,281 --> 02:09:30,561
[SPEAKER_10]: I see.

1839
02:09:30,602 --> 02:09:35,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, at least it's not a Mother's Day hangover because I've definitely had those types of Mother's Days too.

1840
02:09:35,963 --> 02:09:38,504
[SPEAKER_09]: So what's on your mind?

1841
02:09:38,524 --> 02:09:39,985
[SPEAKER_09]: To what do we owe this phone call?

1842
02:09:41,989 --> 02:09:51,074
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess the way I've been seeing it right now, is it just me or is Activision trying to defend just in general ass rape?

1843
02:09:51,614 --> 02:10:07,502
[SPEAKER_10]: In other words, when they try to sell the stimulus pack for Modern Warfare 2, their exec has the gall to say it's the best deal, it's the best value for the amount you're paying, which we all know, and let's be honest here, it's a crock of shit.

1844
02:10:08,749 --> 02:10:09,189
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1845
02:10:31,728 --> 02:10:37,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, I think they definitely have some damage control to be doing, so of course you're going to see comments like that.

1846
02:10:37,790 --> 02:10:46,252
[SPEAKER_10]: The problem with, you know, the way I see it is that you know, they have to they can't just do what they did to Infinity Ward with Bungie.

1847
02:10:47,452 --> 02:10:48,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold, hold, hold, I'm going to stop you right there.

1848
02:10:49,733 --> 02:10:50,853
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't own Bungie.

1849
02:10:50,913 --> 02:10:52,034
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a big difference.

1850
02:10:52,594 --> 02:10:57,615
[SPEAKER_10]: You'd be surprised at how, you know, the actual details of the deal itself.

1851
02:10:58,796 --> 02:10:59,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you know, the

1852
02:11:00,680 --> 02:11:19,009
[SPEAKER_10]: you know the details that are pretty much confidential I mean in other words what I'm trying to say is that the point is that perhaps Activision is going to be inclined to pull their strings as much as possible not to actually own them but to make their life that miserable

1853
02:11:20,071 --> 02:11:25,877
[SPEAKER_10]: in terms of just like being demanding and overworking them if they were signed up for that type of deal.

1854
02:11:26,697 --> 02:11:32,403
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a feeling this agreement is probably going to favor Bungie a little more because Activision is not directly paying for it.

1855
02:11:32,463 --> 02:11:41,131
[SPEAKER_10]: As long as they actually negotiated, as long as Bungie managed to negotiate that contract with terms that they would agree with.

1856
02:11:41,900 --> 02:11:42,801
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty sure they were.

1857
02:11:42,821 --> 02:11:49,285
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm just, you know, as I'm saying, I just want to be sure that we just have to keep in mind that as long as Bungie doesn't get screwed over by Activision in terms of like

1858
02:12:08,948 --> 02:12:11,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember though, Zaku, Bungie has survived a divorce with Microsoft.

1859
02:12:11,290 --> 02:12:11,990
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty big.

1860
02:12:12,250 --> 02:12:15,393
[SPEAKER_10]: These guys have publicly stated that they're helping on just maximizing profits.

1861
02:12:35,183 --> 02:12:42,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me take this kind of a different direction a little bit here because we could kind of talk about this without really knowing the details of it for a very long time.

1862
02:12:42,965 --> 02:12:49,527
[SPEAKER_09]: But come E3, hold on, come E3, we're actually going to see what this game is and what the big mystery project is.

1863
02:12:49,547 --> 02:12:52,368
[SPEAKER_09]: At least that's the assumption and God, I hope it is the case.

1864
02:12:52,708 --> 02:12:54,648
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll actually get to see what this mystery game is.

1865
02:12:54,708 --> 02:12:55,728
[SPEAKER_09]: The curtain will be revealed.

1866
02:12:56,129 --> 02:13:01,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think people are going to remember all this once the game can speak for itself as opposed to being just an idea?

1867
02:13:02,290 --> 02:13:02,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1868
02:13:02,810 --> 02:13:11,312
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter that Activision and Bungie are basically a 10-year deal.

1869
02:13:12,012 --> 02:13:15,552
[SPEAKER_10]: The important thing is that the game will be the face of everything.

1870
02:13:16,313 --> 02:13:26,014
[SPEAKER_10]: It will be the face and that will be the front, the things that your average Joe gamer will see when talking about that particular game.

1871
02:13:26,114 --> 02:13:28,895
[SPEAKER_10]: He would see whatever character is tied to that game and nothing else.

1872
02:13:29,702 --> 02:13:34,043
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet most people don't really follow this stuff either.

1873
02:13:34,403 --> 02:13:39,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Like how many people go, oh, I've got to go see this movie because 20th Century Fox is doing it.

1874
02:13:39,365 --> 02:13:43,526
[SPEAKER_09]: And like, you know, 20th Century Fox, I just love that little theme they play before all the movies.

1875
02:13:43,686 --> 02:13:44,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1876
02:13:44,666 --> 02:13:48,467
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, most people don't really give a hoot at the end of the day.

1877
02:13:49,608 --> 02:13:50,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

1878
02:13:50,148 --> 02:13:54,669
[SPEAKER_10]: This is where the franchises sell themselves to the point where the people who made them

1879
02:13:56,173 --> 02:13:56,733
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter.

1880
02:13:56,793 --> 02:13:57,715
[SPEAKER_10]: It's irrelevant to them.

1881
02:13:58,155 --> 02:13:59,917
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the same thing with Call of Duty right now.

1882
02:14:00,157 --> 02:14:04,122
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't care that Treyarch or Infinity Ward made it.

1883
02:14:04,202 --> 02:14:07,026
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just another Call of Duty game to appease Joe Gamer.

1884
02:14:08,095 --> 02:14:08,975
[SPEAKER_09]: I should say this, though.

1885
02:14:09,055 --> 02:14:16,256
[SPEAKER_09]: There are definitely people that will follow, if I'm going to continue this analogy, follow their favorite directors.

1886
02:14:16,557 --> 02:14:18,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, oh, Kevin Smith has a new film out.

1887
02:14:18,737 --> 02:14:20,177
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got to go see that.

1888
02:14:20,197 --> 02:14:21,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are niches you have to realize.

1889
02:14:22,358 --> 02:14:31,899
[SPEAKER_10]: You have one aspect of really devoted fan base for that one particular person, but then you have another one that's just so passive.

1890
02:14:32,519 --> 02:14:35,780
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't really take that into account.

1891
02:14:36,803 --> 02:14:39,625
[SPEAKER_10]: So to them, it's just another movie that they're seeing.

1892
02:14:40,105 --> 02:14:46,249
[SPEAKER_10]: And in this case, it's just another first-person shooter that this average Joe gamer is playing.

1893
02:14:47,410 --> 02:14:47,710
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1894
02:14:48,011 --> 02:14:49,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Zaku, we've got to wrap up so we can get some more calls.

1895
02:14:50,052 --> 02:14:51,333
[SPEAKER_09]: But thank you so much for your call.

1896
02:14:51,553 --> 02:14:56,076
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sure we'll check in with you again after E3 when the curtain is revealed.

1897
02:14:57,017 --> 02:14:57,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1898
02:14:57,597 --> 02:14:57,837
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1899
02:14:58,177 --> 02:14:58,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care, Zaku.

1900
02:14:59,716 --> 02:15:00,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, have a good one

1901
02:15:21,644 --> 02:15:22,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a few things.

1902
02:15:23,966 --> 02:15:32,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently Square Enix is trying to prohibit people from making pictures and videos of their games, I guess, before they come out or something.

1903
02:15:32,273 --> 02:15:32,914
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really know.

1904
02:15:32,934 --> 02:15:34,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't realize that was a big problem.

1905
02:15:34,915 --> 02:15:39,899
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know they've been really kind of anal about people taking pictures and stuff during E3.

1906
02:15:40,060 --> 02:15:41,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, they do that all the time.

1907
02:15:41,601 --> 02:15:42,762
[SPEAKER_09]: The phone's ringing off the hook.

1908
02:15:42,802 --> 02:15:43,623
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta get one of these calls.

1909
02:15:43,663 --> 02:15:44,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1910
02:15:44,563 --> 02:15:44,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1911
02:15:45,484 --> 02:15:46,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, this is X-Link.

1912
02:15:46,445 --> 02:15:47,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, X-Link.

1913
02:15:47,325 --> 02:15:48,046
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1914
02:15:48,606 --> 02:16:00,855
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I was reading over some news and I was glad to see that Sega had detailed the DRM for Alpha Protocol and that I don't have to have an internet connection 24-7 in order to play it when I do play it.

1915
02:16:00,935 --> 02:16:03,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's because it's Sega, not Ubisoft, but that's good.

1916
02:16:04,110 --> 02:16:04,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God.

1917
02:16:04,670 --> 02:16:07,012
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank somebody for being DRM-friendly about it.

1918
02:16:07,513 --> 02:16:14,819
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the fact that after about two years after the game comes out that they're going to put a patch where there will be no other requirements.

1919
02:16:15,599 --> 02:16:25,728
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's good to know that somebody is at least looking at the consumer and saying, we don't want to go down these same footsteps as some of these other companies have been.

1920
02:16:25,848 --> 02:16:30,652
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to see that somebody is at least trying to appease the PC customer.

1921
02:16:32,318 --> 02:16:32,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's good.

1922
02:16:33,899 --> 02:16:41,162
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't usually think of Sega as a big PC publisher, but I guess they certainly have some of their stuff there, so that's pretty cool.

1923
02:16:42,562 --> 02:16:45,603
[SPEAKER_00]: But even so, I'm glad somebody's taking the right steps towards it.

1924
02:16:46,404 --> 02:16:47,764
[SPEAKER_09]: What else is on your mind this week, buddy?

1925
02:16:49,385 --> 02:16:49,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing much.

1926
02:16:50,465 --> 02:16:54,467
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working on my finals and stuff, and of course playing WoW just like you.

1927
02:16:54,607 --> 02:16:55,527
[SPEAKER_00]: How is Warcraft going?

1928
02:16:55,547 --> 02:16:57,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you been reading the Cataclysm spoilers at all?

1929
02:16:58,422 --> 02:16:59,463
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I have not actually.

1930
02:16:59,583 --> 02:17:01,284
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's kind of hard not to.

1931
02:17:01,644 --> 02:17:02,304
[SPEAKER_00]: I take that back.

1932
02:17:02,445 --> 02:17:11,550
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hard not to read anything with it, but at the same time too, I try not to read too much because I like the whole aspect of surprise and see what's going to happen.

1933
02:17:12,011 --> 02:17:20,256
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like I was telling other people in the guild and stuff, I'm looking forward to seeing how these events actually unfold and how the event's going to play out.

1934
02:17:20,836 --> 02:17:27,422
[SPEAKER_00]: and hopefully they might have some kind of timely worldly events where this all is going to come and unfold at one step at a time.

1935
02:17:27,502 --> 02:17:28,984
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be kind of neat to see how it happens.

1936
02:17:29,004 --> 02:17:33,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they did some fun events when Lich King came out so I'm sure they'll do some fun stuff here too.

1937
02:17:33,848 --> 02:17:34,469
[SPEAKER_09]: So that'll be cool.

1938
02:17:35,370 --> 02:17:35,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1939
02:17:36,791 --> 02:17:38,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh gosh, there's something else I was going to ask you.

1940
02:17:38,613 --> 02:17:41,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you're trying to still do your Loremaster achievement, right?

1941
02:17:41,756 --> 02:17:42,997
[SPEAKER_09]: You may not have a lot of time left.

1942
02:17:43,017 --> 02:17:44,558
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got to get cracking on that.

1943
02:17:44,578 --> 02:17:44,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.

1944
02:17:45,526 --> 02:17:46,647
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yes, definitely.

1945
02:17:46,767 --> 02:17:48,228
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will definitely be doing that.

1946
02:17:48,448 --> 02:17:54,172
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like a lot of my schoolwork had come up, unfortunately, where it had stopped me and slowed down my process, which, of course, you guys can tell.

1947
02:17:54,252 --> 02:17:57,834
[SPEAKER_00]: But then again, I started speeding up again as well.

1948
02:17:57,954 --> 02:18:00,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you finally decided, hey, maybe I should actually go to the new content.

1949
02:18:00,976 --> 02:18:02,197
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll level a lot faster.

1950
02:18:02,217 --> 02:18:06,240
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when you hit 80, it makes the old content super easy because you can start running dungeons by yourself.

1951
02:18:07,080 --> 02:18:08,001
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, precisely.

1952
02:18:08,161 --> 02:18:08,782
[SPEAKER_00]: Precisely.

1953
02:18:08,882 --> 02:18:12,244
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a few surprises in store this next coming week, too, for some of us.

1954
02:18:12,404 --> 02:18:13,765
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will talk about that later.

1955
02:18:15,746 --> 02:18:16,006
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1956
02:18:16,166 --> 02:18:18,907
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got a few interesting things, which was kind of cool.

1957
02:18:19,628 --> 02:18:19,928
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1958
02:18:20,228 --> 02:18:22,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're going to let you go, buddy, so we can get some more calls.

1959
02:18:22,229 --> 02:18:24,489
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'll see you in a while, I'm sure.

1960
02:18:24,849 --> 02:18:25,070
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

1961
02:18:25,770 --> 02:18:26,230
[SPEAKER_00]: Later.

1962
02:18:26,550 --> 02:18:28,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye-bye.

1963
02:18:28,131 --> 02:18:30,472
[SPEAKER_09]: 877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1964
02:18:30,512 --> 02:18:30,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not?

1965
02:18:31,192 --> 02:18:36,374
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll do a couple more calls, maybe at least one more call, since we were really thin on calls the past couple weeks.

1966
02:18:36,434 --> 02:18:38,395
[SPEAKER_09]: And it seems like our phone's been ringing tonight.

1967
02:18:38,495 --> 02:18:39,495
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess folks have things to say.

1968
02:18:39,835 --> 02:19:03,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is strange because this was not quite as busy of a news week as weeks past And I expect the next few shows leading up to mid-June are going to be a little bit of the same thing Because, you know, most companies are going to try and keep it in their pants until E3 But you'll have little tidbits here and there Just like, you know, you've got going with A Little Big Planet 2 and everything But let's get to another call Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1969
02:19:04,542 --> 02:19:06,663
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Actdeft Hey, Actdeft, what's on your mind?

1970
02:19:08,263 --> 02:19:11,784
[SPEAKER_17]: Not much, I just wanna talk about the Humble Indie Bundle.

1971
02:19:12,642 --> 02:19:13,142
[SPEAKER_09]: What is this?

1972
02:19:13,463 --> 02:19:13,683
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1973
02:19:14,843 --> 02:19:17,145
[SPEAKER_17]: The Humble in the Bundle.

1974
02:19:17,605 --> 02:19:19,006
[SPEAKER_09]: What is Humble in the Bundle?

1975
02:19:21,187 --> 02:19:26,870
[SPEAKER_17]: It's actually a six-game pack you can download just by donating anything you want.

1976
02:19:27,911 --> 02:19:29,412
[SPEAKER_17]: Any amount of cash.

1977
02:19:29,452 --> 02:19:31,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't this come up on last week?

1978
02:19:31,093 --> 02:19:32,454
[SPEAKER_09]: No, maybe I just read a story on it.

1979
02:19:32,534 --> 02:19:34,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Or was it maybe a last-minute story last week?

1980
02:19:34,295 --> 02:19:34,815
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember.

1981
02:19:35,335 --> 02:19:36,696
[SPEAKER_09]: I now know what you're talking about.

1982
02:19:36,816 --> 02:19:39,638
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the games that's in there is Deblob, one of them?

1983
02:19:41,266 --> 02:19:43,707
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it's actually World of Goo.

1984
02:19:44,347 --> 02:19:45,548
[SPEAKER_09]: World of Goo, that's it.

1985
02:19:45,788 --> 02:19:47,269
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't get them confused.

1986
02:19:47,289 --> 02:19:48,969
[SPEAKER_09]: They're both blobby slime games.

1987
02:19:50,070 --> 02:19:50,830
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so there it is.

1988
02:19:51,130 --> 02:19:53,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, yes, I did read about this, but go ahead.

1989
02:19:55,072 --> 02:20:00,754
[SPEAKER_17]: It's World of Goo, Aquaria, Gish, Lugaroo, NHD, and Penumbra Overture.

1990
02:20:00,934 --> 02:20:05,996
[SPEAKER_17]: And also they added a sixth game that is Samorost 2.

1991
02:20:07,677 --> 02:20:10,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you actually pick this up and download it?

1992
02:20:11,758 --> 02:20:12,758
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I actually did.

1993
02:20:13,099 --> 02:20:14,499
[SPEAKER_09]: And what did you pay for it?

1994
02:20:15,180 --> 02:20:18,761
[SPEAKER_17]: Even though Bobby may think I carried it, but no, I did pay for it.

1995
02:20:19,141 --> 02:20:21,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you get to name your own price for this, right?

1996
02:20:21,823 --> 02:20:28,206
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's the cool thing about it, that you can put your own price on it.

1997
02:20:28,806 --> 02:20:37,490
[SPEAKER_17]: You can put just a cent, but if you don't got a... Well, sorry.

1998
02:20:38,348 --> 02:20:39,749
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't want to look that cheap.

1999
02:20:39,789 --> 02:20:49,154
[SPEAKER_17]: You can donate $1 or $6, $5, $10, or even there's a donation here on the site that says $1,000.

2000
02:20:49,634 --> 02:20:58,399
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you have a lot of cash to spend or donate, you can donate whatever you want.

2001
02:20:58,499 --> 02:20:59,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Very generous.

2002
02:20:59,139 --> 02:21:00,760
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, Orange Lounge Radio would happily take $1,000.

2003
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:05,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I won't drill you on how much you actually pay, but I do want to know, were you able to pay in pesos?

2004
02:21:05,902 --> 02:21:07,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you're from Mexico.

2005
02:21:07,143 --> 02:21:10,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Or did you have to actually pay like a conversion fee to translate to dollars?

2006
02:21:11,445 --> 02:21:12,906
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, yeah, it's a conversion fee.

2007
02:21:14,246 --> 02:21:19,709
[SPEAKER_17]: You can pay via PayPal, Amazon.com checkout, or Google checkout also.

2008
02:21:20,269 --> 02:21:22,030
[SPEAKER_17]: You can get an account on those sites.

2009
02:21:22,530 --> 02:21:23,030
[SPEAKER_17]: I gotcha.

2010
02:21:23,250 --> 02:21:30,292
[SPEAKER_09]: And plus, you live relatively close to the border of the U.S., so I don't know, do you maybe have some bank accounts to deal in dollars?

2011
02:21:32,073 --> 02:21:36,894
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually have international credit cards, so I just use them.

2012
02:21:37,154 --> 02:21:42,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually people in border towns, no matter where you are, have some type of pass to kind of go between.

2013
02:21:43,376 --> 02:21:44,416
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, very cool.

2014
02:21:45,877 --> 02:21:47,537
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll quickly ask you this.

2015
02:21:47,617 --> 02:21:49,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Which game was your favorite out of the bunch?

2016
02:21:50,902 --> 02:21:54,865
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I haven't tried any of them because I got it today.

2017
02:21:55,405 --> 02:21:58,087
[SPEAKER_17]: Though I have played World of Goo and that's a pretty good game.

2018
02:21:58,627 --> 02:22:02,010
[SPEAKER_17]: I would recommend downloading this just for that game.

2019
02:22:02,650 --> 02:22:06,773
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're donating money just based on that game and everything else is just a bonus?

2020
02:22:07,799 --> 02:22:08,219
[SPEAKER_17]: Probably.

2021
02:22:08,359 --> 02:22:08,959
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fair enough.

2022
02:22:09,139 --> 02:22:09,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Fair enough.

2023
02:22:10,340 --> 02:22:10,940
[SPEAKER_09]: I can go with that.

2024
02:22:11,620 --> 02:22:11,900
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2025
02:22:11,940 --> 02:22:13,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Actdeft, thank you for the heads up.

2026
02:22:13,620 --> 02:22:17,841
[SPEAKER_09]: We always like cheap games or expensive games, whatever you think they're worth.

2027
02:22:18,621 --> 02:22:23,282
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I read somewhere the average amount that people were paying were like $10 for all the games.

2028
02:22:23,602 --> 02:22:27,123
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, for six games, it's not a lot of money.

2029
02:22:27,163 --> 02:22:29,664
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, it's an average of everything.

2030
02:22:29,704 --> 02:22:32,104
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess, you know, some people just simply can't afford more.

2031
02:22:32,364 --> 02:22:35,765
[SPEAKER_09]: So hopefully people are paying what they really truly believe it's worth.

2032
02:22:36,653 --> 02:22:42,175
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, the average contribution here is $8.36, though they have raised over $600,000.

2033
02:22:44,596 --> 02:22:48,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess in the end that's what really counts, is the amount they've raised as a whole.

2034
02:22:48,798 --> 02:22:52,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, Actdeft, we're going to let you go, but thank you so much for your call.

2035
02:22:53,739 --> 02:22:54,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2036
02:22:54,180 --> 02:22:54,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Have fun with the games.

2037
02:22:56,337 --> 02:22:57,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I like that heads up.

2038
02:22:57,457 --> 02:23:04,100
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I like that because it was a good heads up and it was like a sale on games, although I don't know if you really call that a sale or what.

2039
02:23:04,400 --> 02:23:06,121
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been other games that have kind of done that lately.

2040
02:23:06,141 --> 02:23:08,822
[SPEAKER_09]: 877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lingerie.

2041
02:23:08,842 --> 02:23:10,843
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got time to do at least one more call.

2042
02:23:11,143 --> 02:23:14,925
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been a lot of kind of game things that have been doing this lately, like that game...

2043
02:23:16,345 --> 02:23:22,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan and I were playing on Steam one day and it's like you draw these crayon lines with the mouse and I can't remember the name of it.

2044
02:23:22,849 --> 02:23:24,190
[SPEAKER_09]: But that had a sale for a little while.

2045
02:23:24,230 --> 02:23:25,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Crayon Physics?

2046
02:23:25,370 --> 02:23:25,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that it?

2047
02:23:25,790 --> 02:23:26,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Crayon Physics?

2048
02:23:26,391 --> 02:23:26,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think it was.

2049
02:23:27,752 --> 02:23:32,114
[SPEAKER_09]: You could pay whatever you want for that game and there's been a few games that have done that lately.

2050
02:23:32,154 --> 02:23:34,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't World of Goo just alone do that for a little while?

2051
02:23:35,236 --> 02:23:35,776
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it did.

2052
02:23:36,997 --> 02:23:37,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Could be wrong though.

2053
02:23:39,278 --> 02:23:40,899
[SPEAKER_09]: One day and 16 hours left, by the way.

2054
02:23:40,979 --> 02:23:42,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft is clarifying in chat.

2055
02:23:42,340 --> 02:23:47,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Wolfire.com W-O-L-F-I-R-E.com slash humble.

2056
02:23:47,124 --> 02:23:51,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get to at least one more call here on Orange Lounge Radio tonight before we say goodnight.

2057
02:23:51,247 --> 02:23:52,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2058
02:23:52,408 --> 02:23:52,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2059
02:23:54,129 --> 02:23:54,990
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Amiga777.

2060
02:23:55,991 --> 02:23:57,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Amiga777.

2061
02:23:57,552 --> 02:23:58,172
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind?

2062
02:23:59,353 --> 02:24:05,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first off, I'd like to give a Happy Mother's Day shout-out to Dark Sakura.

2063
02:24:07,600 --> 02:24:07,700
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh...

2064
02:24:08,513 --> 02:24:09,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you're a mother to Shermie.

2065
02:24:10,214 --> 02:24:10,514
[SPEAKER_13]: I am.

2066
02:24:11,095 --> 02:24:14,037
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, well, yeah, I have my cat.

2067
02:24:14,097 --> 02:24:16,639
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have actual children, but thank you.

2068
02:24:18,080 --> 02:24:18,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2069
02:24:19,721 --> 02:24:26,226
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyway, I was wondering, have you all heard about Angry Birds?

2070
02:24:28,287 --> 02:24:29,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Like actual Angry Birds?

2071
02:24:29,688 --> 02:24:30,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait a minute.

2072
02:24:30,208 --> 02:24:31,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this a movie?

2073
02:24:32,703 --> 02:24:33,023
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

2074
02:24:33,223 --> 02:24:33,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, never mind.

2075
02:24:33,944 --> 02:24:35,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I'm thinking of something else.

2076
02:24:35,185 --> 02:24:38,187
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm thinking of Birdemic or whatever.

2077
02:24:38,627 --> 02:24:41,889
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a new one with slugs now.

2078
02:24:42,350 --> 02:24:43,190
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking of something.

2079
02:24:43,270 --> 02:24:45,131
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking of like a sci-fi movie or something.

2080
02:24:45,191 --> 02:24:46,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry about that.

2081
02:24:46,913 --> 02:24:49,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the birds, probably like Alfred Hitchcock.

2082
02:24:49,534 --> 02:24:50,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that's what I'm thinking of.

2083
02:24:50,895 --> 02:24:53,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, what is Angry Birds, sir?

2084
02:24:54,137 --> 02:25:02,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Angry Birds is typically a game that no iPhone slash iPod touch user should be without today.

2085
02:25:03,684 --> 02:25:04,564
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a game.

2086
02:25:04,824 --> 02:25:06,425
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta ask, is this your game?

2087
02:25:07,445 --> 02:25:08,586
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I didn't make it.

2088
02:25:09,746 --> 02:25:10,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, alright.

2089
02:25:10,767 --> 02:25:11,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Then plug away.

2090
02:25:12,868 --> 02:25:13,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2091
02:25:13,968 --> 02:25:28,455
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, the story is, you got these evil greenish pigs or whatever that stole the birds' eggs and

2092
02:25:29,218 --> 02:25:33,222
[SPEAKER_02]: and whatnot, and probably just doing God knows what with them.

2093
02:25:34,303 --> 02:25:52,501
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what you have to do is unleash your vengeance with your birds by basically flinging them across this little map

2094
02:25:53,676 --> 02:26:03,899
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, destroying and, you know, eliminating all the pigs in the game.

2095
02:26:05,139 --> 02:26:12,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I got to tell you real quick, Amiga777, I don't mean to cut you off, but we actually just got delivered an exclusive commercial for the game.

2096
02:26:12,981 --> 02:26:13,461
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to hear it?

2097
02:26:14,341 --> 02:26:14,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

2098
02:26:14,822 --> 02:26:15,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, here it is.

2099
02:26:15,422 --> 02:26:16,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Exclusive commercial for the game.

2100
02:26:19,163 --> 02:26:20,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Brian, can I see that paper for a second?

2101
02:26:23,072 --> 02:26:24,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm, that's odd.

2102
02:26:25,053 --> 02:26:26,294
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that would be big news.

2103
02:26:26,534 --> 02:26:27,755
[SPEAKER_04]: You thought what would be big news?

2104
02:26:27,995 --> 02:26:31,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there seems to be an absence of a certain ornithological piece.

2105
02:26:33,152 --> 02:26:37,415
[SPEAKER_04]: A headline regarding mass awareness of a certain avian variety.

2106
02:26:37,595 --> 02:26:38,456
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you talking about?

2107
02:26:38,716 --> 02:26:39,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, have you not heard?

2108
02:26:40,117 --> 02:26:42,198
[SPEAKER_04]: It was my understanding that everyone had heard.

2109
02:26:42,378 --> 02:26:42,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Heard what?

2110
02:26:42,919 --> 02:26:43,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Brian, don't!

2111
02:26:43,559 --> 02:26:44,600
[SPEAKER_06]: The greatest episode ever.

2112
02:26:44,640 --> 02:26:46,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you know about the bird?

2113
02:26:46,301 --> 02:26:48,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Peter's gonna tell you about the bird.

2114
02:26:48,563 --> 02:26:49,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, a bird, bird.

2115
02:26:49,463 --> 02:26:51,565
[SPEAKER_06]: The bird, the word, the word, the bird.

2116
02:26:51,585 --> 02:26:51,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Sir!

2117
02:27:02,492 --> 02:27:03,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect!

2118
02:27:03,412 --> 02:27:04,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, Peter, are you alright?

2119
02:27:28,447 --> 02:27:31,950
[SPEAKER_09]: This just in, Angry Birds just sold 10,000 copies right there.

2120
02:27:33,051 --> 02:27:33,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously?

2121
02:27:34,532 --> 02:27:35,853
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm just fucking with you.

2122
02:27:35,933 --> 02:27:36,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.

2123
02:27:37,294 --> 02:27:39,276
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Orange Lounge Radio, for heaven's sakes.

2124
02:27:39,356 --> 02:27:40,757
[SPEAKER_09]: We love random tangents.

2125
02:27:41,358 --> 02:27:42,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I couldn't resist.

2126
02:27:43,019 --> 02:27:43,499
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

2127
02:27:44,260 --> 02:27:45,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that was awesome.

2128
02:27:45,541 --> 02:27:46,642
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's all good.

2129
02:27:46,662 --> 02:27:52,587
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously, it is selling a lot, and the company claims it's in more countries than they can count.

2130
02:27:53,428 --> 02:27:54,569
[SPEAKER_02]: It's become a big deal.

2131
02:27:56,880 --> 02:28:00,627
[SPEAKER_09]: So, how much is this game going to set you back?

2132
02:28:01,930 --> 02:28:02,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's just 99 cents.

2133
02:28:03,032 --> 02:28:05,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, that's not bad at all.

2134
02:28:05,597 --> 02:28:08,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some people are saying, it's so good, they think it's underpriced.

2135
02:28:09,537 --> 02:28:15,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now, I don't want them to go the route of that one guy who, like, kept increasing the price of his game.

2136
02:28:15,402 --> 02:28:20,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, what was that one game that went up to, like, $10,000 on the store before Apple was like, what the fuck are you doing?

2137
02:28:20,666 --> 02:28:21,767
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, he's a douchebag.

2138
02:28:21,787 --> 02:28:23,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Get out, douchebag.

2139
02:28:23,748 --> 02:28:25,129
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a social experiment.

2140
02:28:25,190 --> 02:28:26,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually, you know what, though?

2141
02:28:27,251 --> 02:28:28,892
[SPEAKER_07]: So what, he raised the price of his game.

2142
02:28:28,932 --> 02:28:33,236
[SPEAKER_07]: People were dumb enough to buy it, so props to him for figuring out a way to make money.

2143
02:28:36,024 --> 02:28:36,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2144
02:28:36,505 --> 02:28:36,785
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2145
02:28:37,086 --> 02:28:46,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Amiga77777, hopefully some folks will check out Angry Bird this week and realize that the bird is indeed the word.

2146
02:28:47,039 --> 02:28:47,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Ba-ba-ba-bird.

2147
02:28:47,720 --> 02:28:48,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I can get down.

2148
02:28:48,281 --> 02:28:49,683
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2149
02:28:52,287 --> 02:28:55,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you sure you don't know the people that programmed it?

2150
02:28:55,772 --> 02:28:57,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Or, you know, getting the cut for the profits?

2151
02:28:58,015 --> 02:29:03,522
[SPEAKER_09]: The name of the company?

2152
02:29:04,123 --> 02:29:05,966
[SPEAKER_09]: No, do you know the people that made it?

2153
02:29:08,623 --> 02:29:10,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Click Gamer, and Ravio.

2154
02:29:11,426 --> 02:29:11,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

2155
02:29:11,686 --> 02:29:12,747
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't know them personally, though.

2156
02:29:12,807 --> 02:29:13,588
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have their phone number?

2157
02:29:13,608 --> 02:29:15,229
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't know the people.

2158
02:29:15,610 --> 02:29:15,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

2159
02:29:16,510 --> 02:29:16,751
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2160
02:29:17,071 --> 02:29:20,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for the plug.

2161
02:29:20,074 --> 02:29:22,636
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure the developers of the game really appreciate you right now.

2162
02:29:23,817 --> 02:29:24,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2163
02:29:24,418 --> 02:29:25,238
[SPEAKER_09]: And we appreciate you, too.

2164
02:29:25,298 --> 02:29:25,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care, buddy.

2165
02:29:26,359 --> 02:29:26,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care.

2166
02:29:27,380 --> 02:29:27,720
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2167
02:29:28,081 --> 02:29:29,882
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2168
02:29:31,633 --> 02:29:35,177
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of funny because we don't really run commercials on this show but yet we do.

2169
02:29:36,798 --> 02:29:39,200
[SPEAKER_09]: It's always somebody's podcast or game.

2170
02:29:39,240 --> 02:29:39,961
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's all good.

2171
02:29:40,382 --> 02:29:40,782
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

2172
02:29:40,822 --> 02:29:44,285
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to know what people are playing and I'm all for supporting indie developers.

2173
02:29:44,345 --> 02:29:44,786
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all good.

2174
02:29:45,509 --> 02:29:47,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, that's it.

2175
02:29:47,109 --> 02:29:51,910
[SPEAKER_09]: We're about ready to wrap up shop and be done here with the show tonight and be all over.

2176
02:29:52,090 --> 02:29:55,551
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you had any other last minute stories you wanted to get to before I closed the shop.

2177
02:29:55,731 --> 02:29:59,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really a story at all, but I think I mentioned it on my Twitter.

2178
02:30:00,712 --> 02:30:08,234
[SPEAKER_07]: I got picked, not that I'm actually going to use the service, I got picked to be a part of the Game Crush service.

2179
02:30:08,874 --> 02:30:11,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, because right now they have limited access to the website.

2180
02:30:12,135 --> 02:30:13,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that the, like...

2181
02:30:15,215 --> 02:30:43,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Almost Prostitution But With Video Games Yes But Now We Get To View The Actual Website Because I Have It's Funny I Am All For Tearing This Thing Up And Looking At It On Next Week's Show However Make Sure There's No NDA Or Nothing Because I Don't Want To Get In No Trouble Cease And Desist Whatever Make Sure We're Good There Alright Alright Well Then We'll Look At That In A Few Weeks That's It And I'm Assuming DarkSakura Doesn't Have Any Last Minute Stories I Think She Said A Moment Ago So Nope Alright

2182
02:30:43,632 --> 02:30:47,194
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to let her go back to playing Final Fantasy 2 and everybody go back to whatever they're doing.

2183
02:30:47,654 --> 02:30:51,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, but first we're going to wrap up the show by getting everybody's final thoughts.

2184
02:30:53,576 --> 02:30:54,557
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought first.

2185
02:30:54,597 --> 02:30:55,237
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll start tonight.

2186
02:30:55,417 --> 02:30:56,858
[SPEAKER_09]: I really don't want to go to the dentist.

2187
02:30:57,978 --> 02:30:58,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, your final thought.

2188
02:31:03,821 --> 02:31:05,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody leaked Sonic 4.

2189
02:31:06,662 --> 02:31:08,923
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, last but not least, your final thought tonight.

2190
02:31:09,924 --> 02:31:10,664
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a pie.

2191
02:31:12,202 --> 02:31:14,104
[SPEAKER_09]: I had banana cream pie last night, it was fabulous.

2192
02:31:14,144 --> 02:31:17,587
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm not eating pie, I'll just make myself some chocolate something.

2193
02:31:17,927 --> 02:31:19,628
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

2194
02:31:19,688 --> 02:31:22,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't you have like spinach pie or something?

2195
02:31:23,091 --> 02:31:25,833
[SPEAKER_15]: If I wasn't out of bananas, I'd just make myself some banana pudding.

2196
02:31:26,834 --> 02:31:35,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I know the whole thing is raw foods, but are you allowed to, like if you are putting it together and you put spinach and all this stuff in there, are you allowed to put it in the oven and cook it?

2197
02:31:35,902 --> 02:31:37,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Or no, you still have to stay away from that?

2198
02:31:37,982 --> 02:31:40,104
[SPEAKER_15]: Allowing is such a strong word.

2199
02:31:41,446 --> 02:31:43,428
[SPEAKER_15]: If I want it cooked, I'll have it cooked.

2200
02:31:43,568 --> 02:31:44,609
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I'm not that.

2201
02:31:46,170 --> 02:31:52,657
[SPEAKER_15]: But the whole essence, they say, is not to heat it more than 117 degrees because that's when the enzymes are destroyed.

2202
02:31:55,679 --> 02:31:59,183
[SPEAKER_15]: That being said, I hate cooked spinach unless it's on a pizza.

2203
02:32:00,569 --> 02:32:02,953
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I like raw spinach much better.

2204
02:32:03,073 --> 02:32:04,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Spinach salad is the bomb.

2205
02:32:04,996 --> 02:32:08,361
[SPEAKER_15]: I've actually got stuff together to make myself a good spinach salad for lunch tomorrow.

2206
02:32:08,481 --> 02:32:08,862
[SPEAKER_15]: Good times.

2207
02:32:09,878 --> 02:32:10,378
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, anyhow.

2208
02:32:10,738 --> 02:32:13,219
[SPEAKER_09]: See, it starts and ends with food here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2209
02:32:13,820 --> 02:32:17,541
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you like the show, please, please tell a friend about the show.
