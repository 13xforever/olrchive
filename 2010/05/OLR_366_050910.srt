00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,120
Tonight, May 9th, 2010, Starcraft 2 gets a release date, Nintendo promises to increase

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:29,600
anti-piracy measures on the 3DS, and a sequel to LittleBigPlanet gets confirmed.

3
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:37,680
Hello, my friends, and welcome to episode number 366 of Orange Lounge Radio, the video

4
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,520
game talk show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,120
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host,

6
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,600
the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,800
Mmm.

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,800
How are you?

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,800
Mmm.

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,800
Mmm.

11
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,800
Filled with food, apparently.

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,800
I had nummies.

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,800
Had nummies.

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,000
Have you talked about this on the show, your new diet, a little bit?

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
A little bit, yeah.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,840
It's not really so much of a diet anymore as a full-on lifestyle change, because I got

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,760
sick of getting sick every time I eat, because I can't eat anything without being stuck in

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,760
it.

19
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,760
I'm gonna say it.

20
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,760
Everything makes me constipated.

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,760
Everything.

22
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,760
You just need more Metamucil.

23
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
No.

24
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,760
Or McDonald's.

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,840
By the way, that made me throw up.

26
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,080
That is the voice over there, the one and only tech master, Loki.

27
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,680
How are you doing, Loki?

28
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,360
I'm fine, but I think I've eaten too much.

29
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:32,200
It's weird, because you would think, with the quantity of food that I normally consume,

30
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,200
that I would be able to eat more.

31
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,280
But it's actually, lately, I've been unable to eat as much.

32
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,280
Blessing in disguise?

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,280
I guess.

34
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:51,200
Granted, you probably don't know, I eat pretty, not healthy, but healthier than I used to.

35
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,480
I mean, really, during the week, I don't drink soda.

36
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,200
I don't go to fast food.

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,680
I have these low-fat salami sandwiches with whole wheat bread and that kind of stuff,

38
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,600
and I eat usually one in the morning, one for lunch, have-

39
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,320
And a sensible dinner.

40
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,320
Sorry.

41
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:20,160
For a snack later on, have no butter or popcorn that's light and stuff, and then for dinner,

42
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,800
I just gorge on whatever I have at home.

43
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,240
But usually not- On the weekend, you have fun a little bit.

44
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,240
Sometimes, yeah.

45
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:35,480
I mean, usually within reason, although this weekend, we discovered Smashburger and there

46
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,240
went everything.

47
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:46,400
So this weekend's been bad, but yeah, so now I'm trying to eat my twists and I'm shoving

48
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,080
the last piece down my throat, because I'm full.

49
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,560
But they're so delicious, I can't let them go to waste.

50
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,360
They're good stuff and they make the whole room smell yummy.

51
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,920
May I say one thing so that I don't leave what I was saying on the word constipated?

52
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,920
Yes, of course.

53
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,920
I know.

54
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,920
Sorry.

55
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,920
Yes.

56
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,280
I'm eating 70 to 80% raw now, like certain things I'll have cooked.

57
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,760
And I finally got to the point where I'm trying to see where I can go out to eat.

58
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,280
So far, Persian food is out if I eat meat.

59
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,480
Not chilies, but Chevy's is kind of okay, but I have to be careful of corn chips.

60
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,480
Corn chips make me sick.

61
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,920
This morning I had eggs and they didn't make me sick.

62
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
Hooray.

63
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,800
So now I know what I can eat.

64
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,520
This morning I went to IHOP and I had pancakes with cheesecake spread in the middle.

65
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,520
That just sounds amazing.

66
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,520
P.S.

67
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,520
I'm fat.

68
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
Anyhow.

69
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,080
And you might be wondering, why do they always talk about food on Orange Laundry Note?

70
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,080
But you know, these...

71
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,600
Food keeps us alive!

72
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,320
And we talked about Smashburger last week because their logo rips off the GameStop logo

73
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,520
because it's the exact same font and colors.

74
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,720
But instead of selling games, they smash meat and make it delicious.

75
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,760
It actually is a condensed font.

76
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,360
You know what, and it's important because if you think about that stereotypical image

77
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,880
of a gamer, what, you know, fat, lazy, controller, crumbs, you know, pouring off your face and

78
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,880
all that stuff.

79
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,800
What was the weird owl line in your pitiful?

80
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,600
I don't know.

81
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,320
I just think of the Warcraft episode of South Park and that guy.

82
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,400
Eating, what, Cheetos off your chest playing Halo 2?

83
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,760
But how easy is it, though, to sit there and play a game like Halo 2, you know, or whatever

84
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,360
it is you play, and go through like a whole bag of Doritos?

85
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,360
That's not the smartest lifestyle.

86
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,360
That's called idle eating.

87
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,360
Yes.

88
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,360
And I do it when I'm working, like, because I've been working on my homework for my finals.

89
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,120
Because my finals next week, ooh, they're all projects, so that means I have a lot of

90
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,120
crap to do.

91
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,820
But the biggest thing that I always loved is I loved eating blue corn chips.

92
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,540
Like just chomping away because I would feel too, I would get distracted from other stuff

93
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,960
without something for my mouth to do or something.

94
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,080
And now I have pecans and goji berries that I snack on.

95
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,140
Let me give you my piece of dieting advice for the, you know, not that I'm one that really

96
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,000
should be giving out dieting advice.

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,880
But here's my tip for those of you that want to defy the gamer stereotype.

98
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,120
And this is one really easy thing you can do that will really cut back on a lot of this.

99
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,600
Well, kind of a two-part thing.

100
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,760
Hey, if you're eating Doritos, Ruffles, Lay's, whatever, see if you can't switch to something

101
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,760
low or fat.

102
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,960
Like, even if it's just the baked version or pretzels are a really, really good substitute

103
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,640
as long as you're not getting the, like, ranch pretzels and all that.

104
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,020
Carrots and hummus?

105
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,620
I don't think, you know, a lot of people are going to go that extreme.

106
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,120
You know, certainly that would be ideal.

107
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,520
Or pita chips and hummus.

108
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
Right.

109
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,560
But here's the other tip.

110
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,200
Put it in a bowl before you take it to the living room.

111
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
Yeah.

112
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,000
And you're rationing off a certain size and you don't go through a whole bag in one sitting.

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm not perfect.

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,160
I downed a whole bag of fortune cookies over the weekend because they're really good.

115
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,320
And, like, they sell, like, flat fortune cookies.

116
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
They're like sugar paper.

117
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,320
Oh my god, they're so good.

118
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
With orange flavoring.

119
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,160
So, but you know how it goes, you know, we're not always perfect.

120
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,280
But that would be my tip if you want to be better when you're gaming.

121
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,480
And for anyone who is curious about how eating raw has affected me in other ways, after my

122
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,400
birthday, you know, all that beer and cake that I consumed all week because I had a lot

123
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,420
of beer and cake left over.

124
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:16,480
I had gone, with my eating less thing, I had gone down three pounds and then I put back

125
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,240
on eight or nine.

126
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,720
And now I'm back to where I was before my birthday.

127
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:29,160
So that means I've lost, I've lost about eight pounds in a week.

128
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
Congratulations.

129
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,080
Hope it can keep going for you.

130
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,960
And I've been eating more, for the record.

131
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,960
I've been eating more.

132
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,080
But more vegetables and stuff.

133
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,280
I've been eating a lot of vegetables and I like bananas now, Rob.

134
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,920
I used to only like banana flavored things.

135
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
Now I actually like bananas.

136
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,920
And I'll give everyone a quick recipe.

137
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
Bananas are good.

138
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
It's a quick one.

139
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
All right.

140
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Hurry, kids.

141
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
We got to get to games.

142
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,480
Get a food processor, throw in a banana, some two tablespoons of raw cocoa and about a tablespoon

143
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,400
of honey or agave nectar and just blend it all really smooth.

144
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
Put it in the fridge.

145
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Take it out two hours later.

146
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,160
Chocolate banana pudding, consistency and everything.

147
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
So there you go.

148
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
Sometimes, sometimes.

149
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,160
All right.

150
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,120
Let's get into video games because believe it or not, between the food, we do talk about

151
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,040
video games once in a great while on this show.

152
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,620
Let's start off as we always do with a little bit of how is your gaming week?

153
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,640
So Dark Soccer, what kind of games you've been playing this week?

154
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,600
I actually started off playing Final Fantasy II.

155
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Finally, I got around and I like it.

156
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Oh, like the iPhone one?

157
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
Yeah, the iPhone one.

158
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,240
The control is pretty interesting and sometimes it doesn't want to actually go where I tell

159
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,440
it to go, but maybe it's because I've got big fat thumbs.

160
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,680
I don't know.

161
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,560
I bet it plays better on a 3GS than it does the 3G too.

162
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,280
I bet because it has a slightly faster processor in those things, right?

163
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
Oh yeah.

164
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,280
Yeah.

165
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
It plays smoothly.

166
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,280
No problem.

167
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,280
See, I have a 3G and I have issues.

168
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,280
You can try mine.

169
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,280
Maybe I will.

170
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,280
Okay.

171
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,360
And then I actually, while we were waiting to get into the stupid restaurant this morning,

172
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,600
because seriously, we were waiting for like an hour, I just finally got bored and beat

173
00:07:53,600 --> 00:08:04,080
Espagluta again on my iPhone and I played some Star Trek Online a little bit and I've

174
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,160
been trying to fix my Sims and I think that I just have way too many mods.

175
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
So fuck it.

176
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,720
I'm just not going to play Sims.

177
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,080
And Dark Soccer is trying to sucker me into the world.

178
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,560
I should say back into the world because I did play the beta for a little bit of Star

179
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,560
Trek Online.

180
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,720
She gave me a little 10-day code.

181
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,720
So I don't know.

182
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,720
I don't know.

183
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,720
We'll see.

184
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,720
We'll see.

185
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
I don't know.

186
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,080
And I've been saving stuff to give you.

187
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,400
Like stuff to add on your ship.

188
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,960
You know I've already addicted to one MMO.

189
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,280
I don't know if I can get addicted to another.

190
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
We'll see.

191
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
We'll see.

192
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,600
I don't know if it was on the show or not, but there's that, remember they're doing now

193
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,880
like an unlimited trial basically where you can go play the first couple tutorial levels

194
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,160
or whatever and spend as much time as you want doing that.

195
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,160
That's Star Trek?

196
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,160
I thought that was one of the others.

197
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
No, it's Star Trek Online.

198
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,160
Oh, okay.

199
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,160
Very cool.

200
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,880
Alright, well if that's it for Dark Soccer's Gaming Week, then Loki, while you're filling

201
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,040
us in on those MMO tips, how was your gaming week?

202
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,920
Didn't play a lot of stuff actually.

203
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,640
It was pretty much just Grand Theft Auto.

204
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:11,040
Been trying to, basically I have to in order to get where I want to be in the rankings,

205
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,840
which is the top of the list, I have to win 500 games in a row.

206
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,640
Actually probably more like a thousand games in a row.

207
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,920
So I'm working on that.

208
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,580
I'm about five now.

209
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:30,920
So doing a good job, I'm actually, because with how high I am on the Trueskill leaderboard

210
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:37,220
right now, if I lose a game, it bumps me down about five to ten ranks, and I have to win

211
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,220
about five games to go up a rank.

212
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,640
So it's really frustrating when I get in, not necessarily lose a game, because losing

213
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:54,280
basically just by a few bucks would be considered a loss, although if you beat people, like

214
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,000
say if you don't win the game, but you beat like three people, that still counts towards

215
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,080
going up the leaderboards.

216
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,240
Anyways, but I have been playing perfect games though, so much so that it's been pissing

217
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,320
off my coworkers and they actually threatened to pull the ethernet one time.

218
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,800
In fact, they did for a second and plugged it back in.

219
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,960
I got pissed off at them, but hey, I'm pretty high up there.

220
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:23,320
I'm like rank 70 right now, and 70 out of 60,000 people is pretty damn good, if you

221
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,320
ask me.

222
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,320
And then...

223
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,320
Me, me, me, me, I'm the best.

224
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
Me, me, me, I'm the best.

225
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,320
Hey!

226
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,320
I'm just messing.

227
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
No, I think it's great.

228
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,960
The leaderboards say so.

229
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,120
I had a leaderboard thing this week too, and I'll get into that in a minute.

230
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,920
And I work really hard for it.

231
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Trust me.

232
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,040
For anybody that plays actually Grand Theft Auto out there on the ranked games, you have

233
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,480
to know how hard it is to get an actual game with people in it.

234
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:56,560
And then on top of that, getting a game where you finish with everybody still in the game,

235
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,200
because a lot of people rage quit out of all these games.

236
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,560
Especially the games I'm in, because I kick the crap out of them.

237
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,280
I'm surprised you don't get penalized for that stuff.

238
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,680
Do you have big devahissies?

239
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,680
You can.

240
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,000
Basically what you do is you go, if they quit out, and when you're done with the game, or

241
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,960
during the game sometimes I'll do that, you go to their profile and you put, you know,

242
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
a review.

243
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,040
You can do that in any game though.

244
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,560
There's no, like, they lose rating points or anything?

245
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,840
No, there's nothing like that.

246
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,960
And you know, that's good in a sense, because our internet at work really sucks, so we get

247
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,240
disconnected from live a lot, and it kind of sucks.

248
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,640
But I mean, the people that...

249
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,000
There's a difference between getting disconnected from live and being a devah.

250
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,600
Like DarkSaga said, there's a lot of devahs on Xbox Live.

251
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,240
There's a lot of Halo devahs out there.

252
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,840
There is a lot of people that are like up in the top ten in the ranked games and stuff,

253
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,980
and they will not play me.

254
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,920
Because I know they're trying to look for these newbie guys to just basically pick on.

255
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,440
I'm playing anybody.

256
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,660
Anybody that hops in the game, I'm gonna play them and I'm gonna kick the crap out of them.

257
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,520
The last game I played, I had 33 kills.

258
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,960
The person below me had three.

259
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,600
So you know, I'm just very intense.

260
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,920
I had 33 kills.

261
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Whatever, okay?

262
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,920
Just, I'm messing.

263
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,880
Yeah, I wish someone would show me up, but no one's coming.

264
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,840
Where's the other 69 players ahead of you?

265
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
I don't know.

266
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,100
But see, it's weird though, the true skill rankings, it's just win-losses.

267
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,720
So there's a lot of people on there.

268
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,600
I play like 300-some games.

269
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,400
There's people on there there above me that played like 20 games, but they've just happened

270
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,560
to win the majority of those 20 games, you know?

271
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,040
Yeah, I could create a new profile, win all the games, and then, oh look at that, I'm

272
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,760
at the top of the list, but that's not playing fair.

273
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:46,160
Anyways, so other than that, I'm actually now working on, we're gonna go back to playing

274
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,600
the modded games again, because it's just too hard to find people to play with.

275
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:56,200
So I'm looking and doing the research phase of a new modded Grand Theft Auto games.

276
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,440
I'm looking now on map editing and stuff like that, because we gotta have ramps and stuff

277
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,560
going to the moon, you know, basically in this game, just to edge it out a little bit

278
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:13,360
more than it was last time, but I'm definitely looking forward to doing that, and without

279
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,520
modding the consoles, of course, we're gonna do the disc swap technique with that.

280
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:24,040
And then I just have a lot of games I'm waiting for, Red Dead Redemption, supposedly coming

281
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,520
out in a few weeks, so look forward to that, but have Alan Wake and Lost Planet 2 to get

282
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,480
to, and a whole bunch of stuff.

283
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,040
Alright, well, if you're done then, my gaming week.

284
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:42,080
Oh, and I joined the APB beta, so hopefully, the beta requirements are a little bit more

285
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,000
than what the actual game requires.

286
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,560
It says I need more RAM, even though I have Windows XP3 2-bit, and I have 2 gigs of RAM,

287
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,880
and Windows doesn't see really any more than that, I mean I'll get like 2 point something

288
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,880
gigs of RAM, so I just need to get some more RAM, probably gonna upgrade my graphics card

289
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,480
as well, looking forward to that game.

290
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,480
Good times.

291
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,480
My gaming week, honestly, not a whole lot different than last week, a little disappointing

292
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,040
because I had so many games last week and this week, not quite as many, or mostly the

293
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,680
same stuff, I'm still enjoying my new video card with lots of World of Warcraft, of course,

294
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,040
and Dragon Age a little bit here and there too.

295
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,100
Probably the only other newish thing I played was some of the new Game Room releases, although

296
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,240
I guess that's not really new, now is it?

297
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,940
These games from 1981 and so forth, wouldn't really be considered new, but whatever.

298
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,920
It was exciting to at least see some new content for Game Room, especially after my little

299
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,880
rant last week.

300
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,000
I guess I got put in my place a little bit with them finally coming out and having just

301
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,920
the one week delay.

302
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,200
So obviously, they've committed that it's out there, what's coming out for the next

303
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,440
few weeks, so hopefully they're gonna stick to that schedule and prove me wrong a little

304
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,480
bit on some of the things last week, which is good, because there's a lot about Game

305
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:58,540
Room I do like, again, I think there's a lot of room for improvement and I hope that that

306
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,920
base engine for Game Room will not stay that way forever, I do hope they make some upgrades

307
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,200
to it, meh, we'll see.

308
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:13,160
So I did play, Pitfall was probably the biggest release this week from the old 2600 days and

309
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,960
that's a game I spent a lot of time with when I was a kid, when I was about five or six,

310
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,800
played through a lot of Pitfall, so I actually sat down and played a full game of Pitfall,

311
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,840
when I say a full game of Pitfall, Pitfall is a timed game, you only have 20 minutes

312
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,860
tops to run through the jungle and collect as much treasure as you can.

313
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,080
So I played for the full 20 minutes without losing all my lives, because you know, some

314
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,440
things you learn when you're five and you never forget, and the thing I learned is how

315
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,080
to get across that alligator pit, when there's no vines, you know, and that's the part of

316
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,680
the game that usually trips people up, but yeah, I was able to get through there and

317
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:49,880
I pretty much ran consistently for 20 minutes, I go to the left, you know, most people think

318
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,680
you have to play Pitfall to the right, because that's the way your character faces, but you

319
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,800
actually don't, if you want to start the game going backwards, you can, so I actually start

320
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,800
the game going to the left, and kept going until the time ran out, and I had a score

321
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,640
of about 89,000, which isn't bad, because the most you can possibly score in Pitfall

322
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:11,640
is 110,000, that's if you get all the treasure, I was only 400 points shy of being in the

323
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,480
top 20 on the game room leaderboard, at the time, I think it's gotten a lot harder now,

324
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,160
I think the minimum score is about 100,000 now, but I just need to learn one thing I

325
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,200
didn't know as a kid, was how to navigate the tunnels, I thought the tunnels were stupid,

326
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,160
because trying to get around the scorpions is kind of hard, so I never really learned

327
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,000
how to navigate the tunnels, and my little five, six year old brain didn't understand,

328
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,580
you know, a tunnel skips three regular screens, so I didn't really learn the patterns that

329
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,040
some people I'm sure memorized when they were younger, and that's how they're getting on

330
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,320
the leaderboard now, so maybe I'll go back to that and try to actually play a better

331
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,860
game, we'll see, but other games I checked out this week on Game Room, Super Breakout,

332
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:54,320
which I think kind of stinks, and you know, I realized it was the first game like it,

333
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,860
but I would much rather see a game like Arknoid or something come to a game room, and plus

334
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,280
the controller, just not the same thing, it's like a trackball, that's what we need, we

335
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,600
need like a trackball on 360, that'd be great for like Crystal Castles, and some of the

336
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,600
other games.

337
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,120
Maybe they'll just have the tall support or some crap like that, and be like, oh look,

338
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,440
instead of being, you know, the control scheme that makes sense by moving your hand around

339
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:24,160
or something like that, they'll have you like roll a fictional trackball or something.

340
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,520
Tiger Claw in our chat room, by the way, join us in our chat room if you're not already

341
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,720
there, we do tape live every week at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com at 6pm pacific, right

342
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,120
after the Bobby Black Wolf show, but if you are listening to us live, pull up a chair

343
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,480
and join us in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, and Tiger Claw actually says, I used to play

344
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,640
a whole lot of Pitfall to see how far I could get, and hoping I reach the end, but it never

345
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,640
ends.

346
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:53,800
It actually will, if you get every piece of treasure, and there are only 255 screens,

347
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,880
or 256, because you know how everything has to be based on powers of two a lot when you're

348
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,480
programming for those old languages, so I think there's 256 screens in the game, but

349
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,800
there's like, I think 32 pieces of treasure, because again, everything's on powers of two,

350
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,120
so I think once you get every piece of treasure, the game ends.

351
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,920
I think the clock just stops and it's over, and you know you basically beat it.

352
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:22,320
There's no actual ending like there is in Pitfall 2, where, no kill screen, it's not

353
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,560
really a kill screen, it's just Harry jumps over and over again, and that's how you know

354
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,220
you beat it, because he goes jump, jump, jump, because you beat it.

355
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,280
By the way, I hope that game does come out eventually, Pitfall 2 I want to see, H.E.R.O.

356
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,600
I want to see, what other big Activision classics do I want to see, Oink, which is out next

357
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,120
week, I actually just play that game a lot.

358
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,760
One other game I'll quickly talk about, Mega Maniac, is also on Game Room this week, and

359
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,860
that was kind of a funny shooter game, it was a little silly, you could say it's Space

360
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,240
Invaders-esque, but basically objects are falling from the sky, or they float in the

361
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,880
sky, you shoot them, da da da.

362
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,060
It's a little more challenging, I think, in some ways in Space Invaders, because the things,

363
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,500
they're supposed to be based on household objects, like you shoot toasters and hamburgers,

364
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:11,120
but it's Atari 2600 graphics, so they just all look like things, you're shooting things,

365
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,240
and some of the things in later levels like float down towards the bottom, but they're

366
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,680
in very specific patterns, and you have to, like, some of them will hover right where

367
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,040
your ship could go, so you have to actually kind of memorize the patterns, or you could

368
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,040
go explodey.

369
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,200
Ooh, and Vandy in our chat room says River Raid, that is definitely a classic Activision

370
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
game, too.

371
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,200
Lots and lots of good stuff.

372
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,880
Ooh, Salacious Pop asking me in chat if I ever got in on the Civ 3 for sale, I should

373
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,440
put that out as an FYI.

374
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:42,600
Steam was running a sale, Civilization 3, complete edition, $1.25.

375
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
That's a great deal.

376
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
What?

377
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,360
Yeah, on Steam, Civ 3, the complete edition, but get this, Civ 4, I think it was like,

378
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,080
and Alan, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it was like $19.95, no, I think it was less

379
00:19:53,080 --> 00:20:00,040
than that, maybe $12.95 for everything, Civ 4, Civ 4, the expansion and colonization was

380
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
like less than $20.

381
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
It was nice.

382
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,600
One other thing I do want to mention during my gaming week, because I do play a lot of

383
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,400
World of Warcraft, lots of information leaking on Cataclysm this week.

384
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,800
I don't want to go too spoilery, because I know some people are really trying to prevent

385
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,240
hearing all the spoilers.

386
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,720
A lot of what I've seen is very visual, so thankfully this is a radio show and I can't

387
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,560
really spoil the visuals, but I will say I am so glad that the game is getting like a

388
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,800
graphical upgrade.

389
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,720
I think it's great that Blizzard is kind of taking this opportunity to say, let's see,

390
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,040
how could we like retcon a graphical upgrade into the game?

391
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,560
Oh, let's blow up the world as it is and make this whole new world and it'll have all new

392
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,560
graphics.

393
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:43,640
And some of the screenshots are great, so yeah.

394
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,680
And Bobby in Chat is correcting us, jumping in, $10 for Civ 4, the two expansions and

395
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,680
colonization.

396
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,680
That's a great deal.

397
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,680
That's a great deal.

398
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,960
I've got to get in on that before it's over.

399
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,680
Damn you Steam, nickel and dime me for all these old games.

400
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:02,000
Yeah, so World of Warcraft Cataclysm, I'm excited about that.

401
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,400
Kind of surprised at how fast information is leaking out, but the friends and family

402
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,680
alpha is going on and unfortunately not everybody's friends and family at Blizzard can apparently

403
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:15,620
be trusted because once it hits the internet, which the client has apparently, it's done

404
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:21,160
because that thing's got data mined and there's pictures and models and everything.

405
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,640
So yeah, looking forward to some of the things they have planned for the expansion.

406
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,360
All right, let's get into some housekeeping tonight.

407
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,480
We want to wish a very happy Mother's Day to all the mothers who happen to be listening

408
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,000
and all of your mothers or motherly figure in your life and what have you who happen

409
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
to be tuning in.

410
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,400
I don't know if we have a lot of mothers that listen to this show.

411
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,840
We all know mine doesn't listen.

412
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,120
We have one listening now.

413
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,120
Oh, Becky.

414
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,120
Right?

415
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,400
Well, happy Mother's Day, Becky.

416
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,120
And I think Deep Man's wife might listen once in a while.

417
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,680
And I don't know what other mothers, I apologize if I forgot you, but happy Mother's Day to

418
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,080
all of you or just anybody who considers themselves a mother.

419
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,560
All right, let's move on and actually get into some gaming news now.

420
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,700
And speaking of Blizzard, I believe we're starting off tonight with just an avalanche

421
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,360
of Blizzard news, right, Logie?

422
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,800
Yeah, there's a lot of news coming out for.

423
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,320
I heard what you did there.

424
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,800
I totally unintended, too.

425
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,680
Totally unintended.

426
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:24,320
With StarCraft II, of course, they announced the release date for July 27th, and both the

427
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,520
collector's edition and the regular edition will be coming out at that time.

428
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,600
Of course, this will be the first StarCraft II that's being released.

429
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,920
I believe there's still going to be two more because one for each campaign.

430
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,280
Way to whore it out.

431
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,600
So that's kind of neat.

432
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,160
Some other neat things, though.

433
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,360
Apparently the map editor is very versatile.

434
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,360
In fact, not only can you make custom maps with it, you can make custom games with it,

435
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,120
including some people have used different examples here.

436
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,640
They've made a Tetris-like game.

437
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:05,460
There was a Mario Kart type of game where you can race different characters around.

438
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:11,600
And then finally, there was also a SHMUP game made with the editor as well.

439
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:17,520
So that's pretty awesome that you have so much flexibility with just that editor.

440
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,520
It'd be very interesting to see what kind of mods you'll see for it.

441
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,000
It'd be more interesting to see what Blizzard does to not have this happen.

442
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,360
Although, I don't know, Blizzard also kind of is supporting the mod community because

443
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,000
they kind of realize it's going to happen.

444
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,320
Warcraft especially, you know, I notice there's two kinds of people.

445
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,560
There's Starcraft people and there's Diablo people.

446
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,520
And I'm more of a Diablo person, so I don't follow the Starcraft news as much.

447
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,320
But at least when it comes to World of Warcraft, they're very embracing of the mod community

448
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,320
there.

449
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:50,140
So maybe they're laughing at this too, I don't know.

450
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,900
It's pretty neat.

451
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,880
I'm not planning on picking up the game, though, because I don't think I was either a Starcraft

452
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,280
or a Warcraft type of person.

453
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,300
Although I did play the original Warcraft, but that was how long ago I played the original

454
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,300
Warcraft.

455
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
That would have been about 15 years ago.

456
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,560
The original Warcraft's pretty old.

457
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,560
Yeah.

458
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,840
So, that's it.

459
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,840
Alright.

460
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,400
And I'll have you know, I didn't actually buy Warcraft.

461
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,000
I played the demo in PC Gamer.

462
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,400
That's how old.

463
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,040
Going to our listeners' chats here at chat.orangetonstrategy.com, Tigerclaw says, Sky, you should call your

464
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:35,560
mother during the show, and also Lumi's follows up, any chance of the OLR crew calling their

465
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,560
moms?

466
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,960
I remember y'all tried a few months ago and it was a lot of fun.

467
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,840
Yeah, you know, I already called my mom this morning and we chatted about that, because

468
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,400
she said I was surprised I wasn't, or she was surprised I wasn't calling her during

469
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,080
the show, and I was like, well, you know, we just, we kind of did that bit a couple

470
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,080
weeks ago.

471
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,040
I called my mom and talked to her while I was waiting to get in the restaurant.

472
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,080
I already did stuff with my mom this week.

473
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:57,520
But I did tell my mother, just for you all, that I consider my mother to be like the Betty

474
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,840
White of Orange Lounge Radio, so, there you go, and of course all of our moms are really

475
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,840
great.

476
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,080
But so, not today, we're not going to call them today, but maybe in the future, you know,

477
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,880
that whole time, the last time we called mom was related to a chat room comment, I believe.

478
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,120
Some chatter said something and I called my mother as a result of it.

479
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
So stay tuned.

480
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,120
You never know what will happen.

481
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,200
Let's see, other comments from our chat room at chat.orangetonstrategy.com, Bochi Kawa

482
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,160
talking about the cataclysm leaks, Sky, remember not all leaks are unintentional.

483
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,800
Blizz only gets more people interested for what they're showing off in cat.

484
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,480
That's true, you know, I'm sure Blizzard to some extent realizes that a lot of the stuff

485
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,760
they put in the Friends and Family Alpha is going to be out there, even though it's all

486
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,760
under NDA.

487
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,120
And they've come out and said, hey, all this stuff is still under NDA, although it hasn't

488
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,920
stopped MMO Champion from running everything.

489
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:53,960
But I think to some extent, anything they put out there they realize is going to leak.

490
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,360
But there's a lot that isn't in the cataclysm beta right now.

491
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:04,380
Like not every zone apparently has been overhauled yet.

492
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,120
And I don't think the Goblin and Worgen zones, like we're not hearing a lot of information

493
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,480
about really what's happening there.

494
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,640
So I think there's still a lot to kind of be discovered that isn't in the alpha yet.

495
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,920
Remember it's in the alpha, really, really early testing stage, and not finalized by

496
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,920
any means.

497
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,880
Everything is subject to change.

498
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,480
Anyhow, one thing that also could change in the future, apparently the Wii and Nintendo

499
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,140
in general might be kind of reconsidering their stance on online, because apparently

500
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:37,000
Nintendo, you know, one place Nintendo fails hardcore is online.

501
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,660
And a lot of that has to do with, you know, the whole friend code thing was a little bit

502
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,660
silly.

503
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:46,280
And, you know, just that they haven't embraced the online gaming to the extent that Xbox

504
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,360
Live or even, you know, PlayStation Network has.

505
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,520
Well there's some comments that Miyamoto, of course the god of Nintendo in many ways,

506
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,320
brought us Mario and all these folks.

507
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,560
He talked to Edge Magazine and apparently was talking about online business this week.

508
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,960
Miyamoto said the following, quote, probably the other thing that we are desperate to realize

509
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,840
is the core online business structure.

510
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,600
Do we need to demand customers pay monthly fees to enjoy online activities?

511
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,240
Or give an online subscription that is free of charge but then offer something extra for

512
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,880
people to pay so they get some extra value?

513
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:23,400
With these core business strategies, I think we are less active than we should be.

514
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:28,080
Apparently it had come up in conversation that Nintendo actually wasn't being very proactive

515
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,060
with their online strategy because, well, they're not.

516
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:35,320
You know, basically if you look at what Miyamoto is saying in those quotes, I mean in my opinion

517
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,920
he basically says Xbox Live and then PlayStation, right?

518
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,120
Pay monthly fees to enjoy online activities.

519
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,240
That's Xbox Live.

520
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,920
Or give an online subscription that's free but something extra for people to pay.

521
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:51,640
That's PlayStation Network with their free model but you have like the core magazine

522
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,640
that has all the little frills in it and some of their other.

523
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,600
It's also kind of Xbox Live because you can access it for free.

524
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,600
True.

525
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,840
So, but Miyamoto does say don't forget that there is like a reward program for folks that

526
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,000
get their Wii's online if you help others.

527
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,780
But he did admit Nintendo hasn't been very proactive in developing such online activities

528
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,240
as an MMOG.

529
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,240
Hmm.

530
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,240
Who knows?

531
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:22,240
I mean, the door is still wide open I think to make a real Animal Crossing online game.

532
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,560
I would say the door is still open to that.

533
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:30,840
Not a rehashed frickin' original Animal Crossing game with online elements as the DS and Wii

534
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,840
ones were.

535
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,080
You could still make a full-fledged MMO for Animal Crossing.

536
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,280
Also Pokemon I think would lend itself to an MMO very well.

537
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,920
But could we perhaps see something at E3 this year?

538
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,560
I would guess probably not.

539
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,680
They're never going to embrace online, at least not with this console.

540
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,940
I would say probably not with this console either.

541
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,000
I don't think it's going to happen with the Wii but I think it's something you've got

542
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,360
to see in their next console.

543
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,360
They have to.

544
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:02,040
There's no... because they're basically saying, oh people don't really care about online.

545
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,040
Well, that's not true.

546
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,320
And then you see 11 million subscribers of World of Warcraft and you're like, well maybe...

547
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,200
Or all the people on Facebook and stuff.

548
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,200
That's still online.

549
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,600
I mean, it's not, you know...

550
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,600
That's true.

551
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,120
I'm surprised Nintendo doesn't try to do something with Facebook because a lot of it's the same

552
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,120
audience.

553
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,120
You know what I mean?

554
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,120
Mm-hmm.

555
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,120
In fact, wasn't there something...

556
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,680
Ah man, I'm thinking of something.

557
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,680
No, that was...

558
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,560
I think you're thinking of the parody stuff with Mario.

559
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,560
No, no, no, no.

560
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,240
I know there was that but there was something else I was thinking of.

561
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,320
I thought there actually was something with this whole, like, get your friends on the

562
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,880
Wii that somehow tied into Facebook but I could be wrong.

563
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,880
That's fine.

564
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,880
I'm wrong sometimes.

565
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,880
It happens.

566
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,680
So we'll see what happens with Nintendo in the future and their online presence but I

567
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,220
would say don't get your hopes up, at least with this generation.

568
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:50,680
They're gonna probably hype it up for whatever console is coming next and make it sound like

569
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,680
it's new.

570
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,360
Like, all these things are just new ideas that have never been done before.

571
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,360
We'll see.

572
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:01,840
Oh, and real quick, since we're on the topic of Nintendo and being that we did sort of

573
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,400
like a sort of secret club a few weeks ago, I have something to tie in with that.

574
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,400
Oh really?

575
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,640
It hasn't quite made it out there yet but we'll be out there soon enough.

576
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,640
I see.

577
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,640
Okay.

578
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,680
I wish I knew I would have brought up the secret club theme music.

579
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,680
No, that's alright.

580
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,400
It's really stupid.

581
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,400
Remember secret club?

582
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,320
I didn't hear it here.

583
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:26,180
So as you may remember, it was confirmed that today, actually, that the black Wii system

584
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:32,400
bundle with Wii Sports Resort and Wii Motion Plus and all the Wii Sports that came out

585
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:39,000
for the same price and, you know, great.

586
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,680
What they didn't mention is, it's always coming out white.

587
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,680
Ah, that's stupid.

588
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,680
Yeah.

589
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,680
I see exactly.

590
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,160
Okay, so that's good to know that the white Wiis aren't like going away or they're not

591
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,320
going to be collector's items or anything.

592
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:58,320
It's basically going to be, they're just going to do this for, I don't know how long.

593
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,320
Because it is limited.

594
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,920
It says on the box, limited edition.

595
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:07,160
But that might be just like, buy this, please, you know, so I don't know.

596
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:12,120
So basically, you will be able to pick when you go to the store if you want to make a

597
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,720
Wii and you'll have a big decision to make and that would be, do you want it black or

598
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,720
white?

599
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,720
Yes.

600
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:30,240
Do I get the Wii in black or do I get the Wii with the white glass?

601
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,760
Alright, anyway.

602
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,360
But that's the question shoppers everywhere are going to ask themselves.

603
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,360
Black or white?

604
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,360
Alright.

605
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,800
I am a dork.

606
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,200
Dark Sakura, what's up next?

607
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:49,280
Well, Nintendo has sent out a little plug for something that's supposed to happen for

608
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:53,280
June 16th, which is right during E3.

609
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:58,800
The official Nintendo Magazine is going to have a world exclusive in issue 57, which

610
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,600
is something.

611
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:07,320
But the quote goes, you may want to mark Wednesday 16th, June in your diary will be revealing

612
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:14,240
world exclusive details on a top secret new game in the next issue of O&M.

613
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,640
How do they know I have a diary?

614
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,960
I think that, given the way that the date's listed and diary, I would suspect that it's

615
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,640
European information.

616
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,520
Anyway.

617
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:33,480
But, um, maybe it's an excuse to try to get people to go out and buy more official Nintendo

618
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,480
Magazine.

619
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,720
All they have to do is say, Howard and Nestor, back for real, forever.

620
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,720
Howard, how about this?

621
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,840
I mean, it's like, why don't you just wait to see what's at E3, because I can guarantee

622
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,280
whatever's at E3 is going to be there.

623
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,960
It's what's coming out during E3, right?

624
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,960
June 16th?

625
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,960
Well, not everyone gets to go.

626
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,480
That's like the Wednesday of E3.

627
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,840
Yeah, but everybody that we know has internet access.

628
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:01,240
And if it's the June issue, typically the issues for one month come, for subscribers,

629
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,040
come out a month earlier.

630
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,560
This could be a time thing, though.

631
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:09,040
I mean, they could still be like the July issue, you know what I mean?

632
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,040
It's going to be timed.

633
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:14,480
Especially if it's sensitive information that is going to be blown at the E3 press conference.

634
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,160
They're going to make sure they don't leave headquarters until...

635
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,720
It'll be a new Zelda game.

636
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,720
That's all it is.

637
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,720
I mean, come on.

638
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,720
They've already been...

639
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,520
It's going to be the Nintendo money printer.

640
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,480
Hinting that they're going to be doing a new Zelda game.

641
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,080
Yay, new Zelda game.

642
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,160
X-Link in our chat room says, it's Earthbound!

643
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,160
Yay!

644
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,520
Hey, what if it's Kid Icarus?

645
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,880
Jizzed in my pants.

646
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,120
Although, you know, to be fair, I mean, I know, Loki, you're sitting over there going,

647
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
it's Zelda.

648
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,520
Big fucking deal.

649
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:47,120
Remember, one of the best games to come out last year, if not the best game to come out

650
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:52,280
last year, was A Blind Side by Nintendo at E3 that nobody saw coming.

651
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,840
And that was New Super Mario Brothers Wii.

652
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,000
Remember, there was no news on that before E3.

653
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Wow, that's right.

654
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,280
I never saw them rehashing something that was on another system and re-releasing it

655
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,280
for another system.

656
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,280
You know what though, Loki?

657
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,120
That's so unlike Nintendo.

658
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,760
Your cynicism aside, it really was one of the best games to come out last year, if not

659
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
the best.

660
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,760
I mean, last year was not like an A++ game.

661
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,640
Yeah, you know why it sold a lot?

662
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:17,240
Because people that buy the Wii eat up anything that comes out that's Mario in it.

663
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,240
Have you played it?

664
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,240
It's a good game, and it's very accessible.

665
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,240
It's a platform game.

666
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,240
Woo, okay.

667
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,240
Yeah, it's a Mario game.

668
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,360
But it's very accessible to those that played the old Mario on the Nintendo NES.

669
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,720
It was a great game.

670
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,800
I understand it, that it's a Mario game, and it'll do really well.

671
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,740
Just like Super Mario Galaxy 2 will do really well.

672
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,820
Because it's a Mario game.

673
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,300
Because people buy Mario and Zelda.

674
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,880
And Pokemon.

675
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:45,020
I mean, if they came out with like, you know, an awesome Metroid game, and yes, I know Metroid

676
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:49,120
Other M is right around the corner, let me tell you something, Metroid Other M isn't

677
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,380
gonna sell as well as Mario.

678
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:56,040
If they dressed up Mario in the Samus suit, and had him going, you know, fighting Bowser

679
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,000
and stuff with a blaster, and he can turn into a ball and shoot bombs and stuff like

680
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,440
that, it would sell a billion copies, because people eat up Mario, which is like Apple and

681
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,520
their iPods.

682
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,160
I actually am gonna go out on a limb, and I could be dead wrong.

683
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,720
I don't think Mario Galaxy 2 is gonna sell as great as everyone thinks it is.

684
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,720
No, it's not.

685
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:21,560
I think there's gonna be this kind of like, just general rejection of the game.

686
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,880
What I think is interesting, and I don't think it's on our show world tonight, but I heard

687
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,080
something about they were releasing Mario Galaxy 2, not in America, but in other countries,

688
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:37,080
Japan and Europe, with a DVD that basically tells them how to play Mario Galaxy 2, and

689
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:42,320
how it's not that different from a, you know, the old school Mario, and kind of trying to

690
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,360
make the 3D game more accessible.

691
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:49,920
Ironic that it's on a DVD, if you think about what system it's coming out on, but that's

692
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,080
besides the point.

693
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,600
You know, that this tutorial video's coming out.

694
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:58,040
But it doesn't matter that the system doesn't play DVDs, who cares.

695
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:03,000
Really, they could include the videos on the actual disc, but, so what.

696
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:11,320
Um, cause if you remember, Mario Galaxy was the first dual-layer DVD game from Nintendo.

697
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,560
And it was a good game, like I'm not bagging on Mario Galaxy, and I'm not trying to say

698
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,680
that Mario Galaxy 2 won't sell well because it's like, you know, a bad game by any means.

699
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,680
No.

700
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,560
I, I don't know, it's just, I think you're gonna really see a difference between how

701
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,960
a game like New Super Mario Brothers Wii and that will be received.

702
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:33,720
I'm sorry, I'm dealing with the reason I'm saying that, you know, it's just, I don't

703
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,480
have high expectations for Nintendo.

704
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,640
That's, yeah, great, New Super Mario Brothers did well.

705
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,080
You know what, if it was a different Mario Brothers game, it was still done well.

706
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,640
Mario game during the fourth quarter, during holiday season, it's gonna be on everyone's,

707
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,440
you know, shopping list.

708
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,180
Of course it's gonna do well.

709
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,180
That's not a surprise.

710
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:56,800
But the thing is, Nintendo doesn't really do anything to surprise us.

711
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,440
For example, their latest announcement that was this week.

712
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,880
It was just like, really, really, I mean, there wasn't enough party games on the Wii

713
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:13,600
that you needed me party or Wii party, I mean, really, Wii party?

714
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,600
Was that necessary?

715
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,560
Where am I gonna get a good party game on the Wii?

716
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:24,560
I don't know, there's just none out there ever, ever.

717
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,600
If that's what people are gonna buy.

718
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:33,160
But just like, you know, don't try to pretend Nintendo that you're gonna just come out with

719
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:37,160
some sort of amazing product that's just gonna blow us all away, because I'll tell you what,

720
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:41,760
it's just gonna be a port of something or it's gonna be another Mario and Zelda game.

721
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,560
That's all it really is.

722
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,360
And those Mario and Zelda games, I bet you anything the new Zelda game, probably gonna

723
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,700
be exactly like the last Zelda game.

724
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,360
As far as engine goes, just new levels and stuff.

725
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:58,200
Maybe a few little, Link is gonna turn into a duck this time, I don't know, something

726
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,200
different.

727
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,200
It's just...

728
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,460
Duck Link!

729
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,840
Zelda 2, the adventures of quack.

730
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,840
Or like a Smash, Smash Brothers on DS might be cool, I don't know.

731
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:16,700
We'll just have to see what they come out with, but I guarantee it's just gonna be,

732
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:21,560
it's gonna be weird and awkward, just like we relax.

733
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,680
Act Deaf says they'll probably publish President Cat.

734
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,000
That will never happen.

735
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
No.

736
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,040
No, President Cat's not gonna happen, sadly.

737
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,520
I wish it would, you all know how I feel about it, but, uh, and there's, there's still my

738
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,920
dream that it'll be the big, maybe that's the big surprise reveal at E3.

739
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,920
President Cat.

740
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,920
No, when is this cat coming on stage?

741
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,920
Holy shit!

742
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,920
I will...

743
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,480
I probably won't get invited to the Nintendo press conference, but that's okay, I've tried

744
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,480
to stay in person.

745
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,480
It doesn't matter, they'll hear you yelling.

746
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,000
They'll hear me yelling from wherever I am.

747
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
What the hell?

748
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,040
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

749
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,800
You guys really did that?

750
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,160
You really did it?

751
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,320
Oh shit!

752
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,320
Is this real life?

753
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,720
Anyhow, let's move on, Loki.

754
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,080
President Cat'll never happen.

755
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,960
So other stuff, we can talk about Nintendo.

756
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:20,760
Of course they're gonna wanna step up their anti-piracy measures for the 3DS, seeing as

757
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:26,160
it's running rampant with the DS and the DSi, even though, oh yeah, we changed some stuff

758
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,640
to the DSi to make it harder to pirate, but yeah, that was defeated within little time

759
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,640
whatsoever.

760
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:41,040
But apparently, uh, they hate piracy, yes, oh my god, and, um, you know, of course now

761
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:48,400
that, you know, six years with the system being out, they wanna find ways to, um, stop

762
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,400
the piracy.

763
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:56,120
It says, uh, we have a strong sense of the crisis about this problem.

764
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,280
Which doesn't really say what they're gonna do.

765
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,920
We're aware of the problem!

766
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,440
Good!

767
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,160
No shit, cause you sued the companies that were doing the chips and stuff, right?

768
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,980
They went after all these people.

769
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,680
So no shit, you're aware of the problem.

770
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,460
How are you gonna make that perfect anti-pirate, I mean, doesn't Sony say this all the time?

771
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:22,720
We have made our next console unhackable, 48 hours later, lol hack.

772
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,620
I'm gonna tell you right now, unless the system has downloadable firmware updates that they

773
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:34,320
can do, something like that, um, the fact that these games are on a cartridge, there's

774
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,720
no way that they're gonna be able to stop piracy.

775
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,120
It will get broken, quickly.

776
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,120
Bold statement.

777
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,560
Let's look at the past history now.

778
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:51,800
Um, really the only system that's been hard to crack is the PS3, but as far as the system

779
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,800
is-

780
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,720
It's just cause Blu-ray has it really, you know, it's somewhat a new technology.

781
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:00,840
It's not necessarily that, it's just they have good encryption on stuff, but it's just,

782
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:06,240
look at the Nintendo systems, I mean the DS, the Game Boy Advance, it'll happen.

783
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,600
And especially in the sense, I'm assuming this, you know, this system is gonna have

784
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:18,840
some of the technology that's in the DS, cause it is gonna be backwards compatible.

785
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:23,320
So it probably won't be that difficult.

786
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,880
I'm planning on picking one up, cause I think it's gonna be neat.

787
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,880
Alright.

788
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,680
Um, well, let's move on to talk about some of the news, actually, wait, I gotta read

789
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,720
these A-plus comments from chat, cause there was some hilarious stuff, um, going back to

790
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,220
the whole duck Link thing, uh, stand in our chat room, A-plus comment, Link turns into

791
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:44,280
a donkey, and the next game will be called The Legend of Zelda, Zelda's Tijuana Donkey

792
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,280
Show.

793
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,640
Now that's a game I'd play.

794
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,980
Okay, anyway.

795
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:56,040
Or Link turns into a wolf, gets captured by Bob Barker and then neutered.

796
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:00,440
Little Big Planet 2 is going to be coming out, that's right, it's real, it's actually

797
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,440
happening.

798
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,840
If you like leaks and remember the guy a couple weeks ago whose song was confirmed to be in

799
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:09,360
the game, et cetera, et cetera, well apparently Game Informer has said it is coming and we're

800
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,320
gonna show off more information in our June issue of Game Informer.

801
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,000
So what exactly is going on?

802
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,800
Well some of the little details have leaked.

803
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,480
It is a whole new game, okay, this is coming from the Neo GAF forums, apparently Media

804
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,840
Molecule is making tools that will allow you to do racing games, space invader shooters,

805
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,720
puzzle games, role playing games, and strategy games.

806
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:36,840
They are just making this engine, it's not just for side-scrollers now.

807
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,840
That's the big difference here.

808
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,640
And the thing I heard I thought was the stuff from Little Big Planet 1 I think you're gonna

809
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,520
be able to bring into Little Big Planet 2.

810
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,560
Apparently a Media Molecule developer made a Command and Conquer clone in the game.

811
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:55,460
And they also were saying that they were able to, now you can really have good control over

812
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,960
like the cameras and stuff like that, the physics.

813
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,480
You're gonna be able to create and edit short films.

814
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,380
So this is gonna be Mashima Heaven, apparently.

815
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,040
You will be able to record your own sound effects.

816
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,960
I don't even know how that works, but that's what they're promising.

817
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,520
You will be able to move the game's camera around to make your own cutscenes using Sack

818
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,520
Boys.

819
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:20,360
And, and, and the Sack Bot, a fully customizable programmable enemy unit.

820
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,520
So you can control it yourself.

821
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,600
I almost think this is gonna be too much.

822
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,600
Like you know, part of what-

823
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,080
It is gonna be epic.

824
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,900
Part of what made Little Big Planet so cool was that it was relatively easy to make your

825
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:37,280
own levels, but there was still, it wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't easy to make a good level.

826
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,280
Let me put it this way.

827
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,280
Let me put it that way.

828
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,040
It's hard with, the problem you run into when you can do that is it's like you don't know

829
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,240
where to begin.

830
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,880
It's just like all these options, you don't know how to kind of focus it.

831
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:52,200
Whereas if you're limited somewhat, it's a little bit easier, okay, I gotta make a side-scrolling

832
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,200
game.

833
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,360
But people that want to expand beyond that to make like the space shooters and stuff,

834
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,160
you know, they're limited by what they can do.

835
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,520
So this, I think, since you're gonna have full control over the camera and stuff, you're

836
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,500
gonna see a lot of like maybe even top-down games and whatever.

837
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,200
But it's just gonna be nuts.

838
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,240
AlphaKananagram wants to jump in there and try to correct me, saying the PlayStation

839
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,560
Eye has a microphone.

840
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,760
That may- okay, so you'll be able to make your own sound effects, but I mean, what are

841
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,240
you gonna be able to make with a microphone on a camera besides like, you know, fart noises

842
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,280
and, you know, just like random screaming.

843
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,960
It'd be cool if you can import WAV files in MP3s, that'd be awesome.

844
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:35,000
Make your own background music, hello, although that also opens the door to like rampant piracy.

845
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,060
Like soon, not only will you be able to like listen to Lady Gaga leaks and whatever else

846
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:43,280
is leaking on the internet, that whole eye leaks thing.

847
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,840
Not only will you be able to do that on YouTube, but you'll be able to like go into Little

848
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:51,800
Big Planet and like listen to new songs because people will bring MP3s over.

849
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,600
That's great.

850
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,400
So yeah, this sounds pretty awesome.

851
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:02,560
By the way, there are some other little things trickling out about there, just that it's

852
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:07,320
just a more robust game that is not just side-scrollers.

853
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:12,240
And this kind of catches me by surprise because I thought Little Big Planet 2 would just be-

854
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,680
it would be like more side-scrollers, but probably like more you could do with it.

855
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,480
Like the enemy robot thing, like that I would think would have been the sequel, maybe a

856
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,160
couple other little things, but I wasn't expecting this much.

857
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:28,400
But to hear that you can make role-playing and strategy games, that's really big.

858
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,640
That sounds fun.

859
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,880
That sounds epic.

860
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:38,360
That's like erasing games, direct competition with themselves almost, is so weird.

861
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:44,200
But RPG Maker, you used to love that, you used to love the RPG Maker series.

862
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,700
It's just a lot to do though with RPG Maker.

863
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:51,760
That's the problem, is you don't really- trying to create an RPG or something, it's just a

864
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:59,240
lot of work with trying to create the storyline and all the different, you know, AI and sequences

865
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,240
and stuff.

866
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,760
It's just- it gets too difficult.

867
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:09,080
Like I think the most work that I did on an actual RPG or adventure game or something

868
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:14,200
was actually like in Megazooks, the ZZT sequel.

869
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:18,440
And the only reason why is because it was pretty much, you know, you can draw your levels,

870
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,880
make your little- place your enemies and stuff, you don't really do a lot of programming,

871
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,520
although I did have some boss characters and stuff like that, like a barrier to kill with

872
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,620
grenades.

873
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:27,620
But um-

874
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,360
Big Planet 3 ZZT edition.

875
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,520
But I mean, you know, that was awesome.

876
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,920
Seriously though, that's something that they need to bring to like a console or something.

877
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,840
One of these weeks we really need to highlight that as a classic game of the week.

878
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,440
I know that's not really Dark Soccer's alley, but if she's ever gone in a future week we

879
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,440
gotta-

880
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,440
Work on that, uh-

881
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,240
I could do a whole episode about how much I love ZZT.

882
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,520
It was a great game.

883
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:55,680
Or the create an OLR game in ZZT contest or something like that.

884
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,020
Well actually, Tigerkaw in our chatroom talking about this whole little Big Planet 2 says

885
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,080
somebody can make a level with clips from OLR.

886
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,320
I'm a little scared of what that might bring.

887
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,440
By the way, I thought this was neat too, they're also talking about PlayStation Eye integration

888
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,360
for loading levels using QR codes.

889
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,400
Are those like those barcodes like that are meant for cell phones and stuff?

890
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,400
I think so.

891
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,440
They're able to bring in levels just by holding up a little thing to your camera.

892
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,440
That's a-

893
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,560
You know what, that sounds like the e-reader.

894
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,560
Remember that?

895
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,560
Yeah.

896
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,440
Where they would put full Nintendo games on like five little cards.

897
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,440
Remember that?

898
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,000
That was awesome.

899
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:32,280
Um, wow, lots of stuff and uh, oh my gosh, just so much.

900
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,800
There's some uh, uh, spoilers of levels that are out there.

901
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:40,840
I guess I shouldn't give you too many spoilers, but they are talking about a tribute level

902
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:44,120
to all these old arcade classics.

903
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,880
Awesome.

904
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,360
More information to E3 I'm sure.

905
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,760
Ooh, I wonder if it'll be playable on the show floor.

906
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,600
Excited.

907
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,320
It'll definitely be part of their press conference.

908
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,320
Absolutely.

909
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,560
Didn't they- weren't they supposed to be having two press conferences or was that Microsoft?

910
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,560
That's Microsoft.

911
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,380
It's doing one just about in Natal, I believe.

912
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:04,560
I don't know if that's like a media night or what that- that's all about.

913
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,560
We'll see.

914
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,040
Dark Sakura, what you got for us?

915
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,520
More stuff Rob, more stuff.

916
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,640
In fact, more Nintendo.

917
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:19,440
Um, but this is actually specifically about Sin and Punishment, successor of the skies.

918
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:26,520
Um, the European box art has a reversible cover.

919
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:32,080
So you can actually put, um, have the Japanese box art on it.

920
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:35,760
It's not gonna look exactly like the Japanese box art because the big logo is not up at

921
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,600
the top side of it.

922
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,920
It's on the bottom, but it is the, uh, Japanese artwork.

923
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,800
And I was looking at the European box art.

924
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:53,680
I was- yeah, and it's just- it's not bad, but it's not as really good as the Japanese

925
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,680
one.

926
00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:01,700
I think that it's actually- I mean, it's not bad, but the Japanese art is just really fantastic.

927
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:04,320
It's a really gorgeous piece of artwork.

928
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,800
So I'd say that's a treat.

929
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,200
I like it when you get fun little reversible things.

930
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:15,160
You know, also it was cool when we, when, um, Capcom did the Okami and I ordered mine

931
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,040
that I got five months later.

932
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,400
When you can like print your own and put them in there.

933
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,400
Like somebody did one for Wii Sports, it was kind of like fan made.

934
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:29,020
I would like to see, um, a lot of those Photoshop contests too that do like the retro style

935
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:32,880
book covers, but out of video games, there's been some very creative ones.

936
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,480
I'd like to just kind of fill up my gaming library with the alternative covers.

937
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,480
I think that'd be cool.

938
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,040
I'm gonna link this image though to the chat room because I think they'd really like to

939
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,680
see it, I hope.

940
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,760
If not too bad, I'm linking it anyway.

941
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:49,920
Um, going to our chat room, chat.orangelauncherator.com, Stan is asking, wasn't there already a Nintendo

942
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,920
cereal?

943
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,560
I'm sure it was a Mario cereal or a Zelda cereal.

944
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,880
Actually it was both.

945
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,080
And that was in response to a comment Act Deft had said, what's next Nintendo cereal?

946
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,560
It was the Nintendo Breakfast System.

947
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,200
Yeah, the Nintendo Breakfast System.

948
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,040
Um, and it had, uh- Got a little theme song.

949
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,920
Yes, it had both, right?

950
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,760
It's breakfast now.

951
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,080
It had both the, um, Nintendo or Mario and Zelda, right?

952
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,080
Yeah.

953
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:16,680
And it was split in the center, like those logos for the two game cartridges here.

954
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,680
Hold on.

955
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,680
Here we go.

956
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,680
Here we go.

957
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,680
Here we go.

958
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:29,200
This is going to take me way back y'all way back y'all before some of you were born.

959
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,200
It's too low.

960
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,200
It's too low.

961
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,200
They probably can't hear that in chat.

962
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,200
Hold on.

963
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,200
Let me try.

964
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,200
Let me try another one here.

965
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,200
This one.

966
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:54,800
Yeah, it had that little cardboard divider in the middle of the two bags.

967
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,800
Yeah.

968
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,960
Nintendo cereal system.

969
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,960
Yeah.

970
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:58,960
Nice.

971
00:50:58,960 --> 00:50:59,960
I actually had that when I was a kid.

972
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,480
Uh, my brothers liked that stuff.

973
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,480
I thought it was nasty.

974
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,480
What did it taste like, Rob?

975
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,880
A fruit flavored crunch.

976
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,640
I thought you were going to say a fruit flavored crap.

977
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,560
It was, it tasted like, uh, Froot Loops to me.

978
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:16,200
I couldn't get over just how awful it smelled, but then again, my favorite cereal when I

979
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,920
was a child was Grape Nuts.

980
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,800
All right, let's move on to release dates and see what's coming out around the world.

981
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,960
Sadly, no new Nintendo cereal, but at least some video games coming out, hopefully.

982
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:27,960
Yes.

983
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,120
Uh, video games definitely on their way out this week.

984
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,120
I actually some pretty decent stuff.

985
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:36,440
Um, we've got some big game releases starting off with Lost Planet 2.

986
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:41,200
Uh, that's going to be making its way out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

987
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,440
Sad, though, I was reading the reviews on it, man.

988
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:50,080
Just some real, I don't know, just okay reviews, not, you know, kind of gloating over the whole

989
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,080
thing.

990
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,080
Uh, oh.

991
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,480
Yeah, it's not, that's too bad.

992
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:01,800
Uh, Dance Sensation, Majesco's, I guess, version of Let's Just Dance, except not as good.

993
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,640
That'll be coming its way on the Wii.

994
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,280
Skate 3, coming out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this week.

995
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:12,960
A game I'm probably going to pick up, 3D Game Heroes, coming out on PlayStation 3.

996
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,640
Ooh, you'll have to tell me if that's worth getting.

997
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,520
I'm really, like, curious about that game.

998
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,520
The reviews have been excellent.

999
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,520
Really?

1000
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,520
Excellent reviews.

1001
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,440
So, I am definitely picking that up.

1002
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,560
And that's really a dilemma for me, because that means I'm going to have to update my

1003
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,720
firmware on my PS3.

1004
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,480
Wait, were you trying to hold off on the whole Linux thing?

1005
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,480
Yes, I was.

1006
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,040
When do you ever use Linux?

1007
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:37,280
Doesn't matter, it's not Linux that I'm interested in.

1008
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,160
Oh, I see.

1009
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:45,360
Uh, the expansion for Age of Conan, Rise of the Godslayer, coming out on PC this week.

1010
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:51,840
Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3, coming out on PSP.

1011
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:57,360
Batman Arkham Asylum, Game of the Year edition in 3D, coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox

1012
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:02,240
360 this week.

1013
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:12,760
Oh, also, of course, the real overpriced Xbox 360 USB flash drives will be coming out this

1014
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,600
week on 8GB and 16GB.

1015
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,920
Just seriously, just go buy a third party one.

1016
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,920
It's way cheaper.

1017
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:20,920
Okay.

1018
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,840
And that's it.

1019
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,560
Going to Japan on the Xbox 360.

1020
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:28,520
Remember, last week was a dead week because of the holidays, so we're back in the swing

1021
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,520
of things this week.

1022
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,480
2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa comes out this week on the 360.

1023
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,960
Also a game on the 360 called Metro 2033.

1024
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,960
This is coming from THQ.

1025
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,840
I have not heard a lot about what this game's all about.

1026
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,720
It's a Russian first person shooter game, kind of like a post-apocalyptic type thing.

1027
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,720
Ooh, looks like fun.

1028
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,720
Is that coming out over here?

1029
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,720
It came out last month.

1030
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,720
Oh, did it?

1031
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,720
It actually came out in March.

1032
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,720
Well, it's not usually the type of game I would follow too much.

1033
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,720
Same name?

1034
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,720
Yeah, Metro 2033.

1035
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,800
Oh, I just haven't heard much about this game.

1036
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,960
Can't play them all.

1037
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:59,240
That's coming out on the 360 in Japan this week, so I guess it's like a localized version

1038
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,240
or what have you.

1039
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,480
On the PlayStation 3, also the World Cup South Africa game makes its way to the PlayStation

1040
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,480
3.

1041
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,760
That's really it on the PS3.

1042
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,280
Not a lot this week.

1043
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:11,160
Lost Planet 2 actually doesn't come to Japan until next week.

1044
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,680
Also a big, big soccer game next week.

1045
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,660
We'll tell you more about that later.

1046
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:18,560
Going up to the Nintendo Wii, also the FIFA World Cup South Africa game.

1047
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:21,720
Other than that, not a whole lot coming out.

1048
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:28,800
PlayStation 2 gets Daisen Ryaku, Daitoua Kobushi, Tora Tora Tora, where Kishu Ni Sekou Seri.

1049
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,120
Yes, that is the full name of the game.

1050
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,120
Best version.

1051
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,120
It's the best hits.

1052
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:38,720
So I think it's probably a price reduction of an existing PS2 game because are any developers

1053
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,480
really making that many games anymore?

1054
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,480
PlayStation 2?

1055
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,480
Yeah.

1056
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,840
Very few, but they're still coming.

1057
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:49,880
Basically looks like your Ace Combat clone, so that's what you have on the PlayStation

1058
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,880
2.

1059
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,960
Lastly, looking at the handhelds and the PSP, you also have the World Cup South Africa game.

1060
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:00,880
Hakioki Yugi Roku comes out as well on the DS and the PS.

1061
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,520
I'm sorry, that's just the PSP where that is coming out.

1062
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,880
I got my handhelds mixed up.

1063
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:12,960
Hakioki Yugi Roku looks like, I don't know, they don't have a lot of screenshots of the

1064
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,560
actual game, but these little chibi anime characters, kind of like in a school, a little

1065
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:21,000
adventure game, so I don't know what the point is there though.

1066
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,640
They don't say a lot about it.

1067
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:30,760
So lastly on the DS, Trick DS Han Kakushi Kami no Sumo Kan is supposed to come out this

1068
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:31,760
week.

1069
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,720
It's known as Trick and it's from Konami.

1070
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,600
So I don't know if this game's about getting tricks or what.

1071
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,600
No.

1072
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:43,680
I think it's, looks like kind of like a survival horror, but one of those slower paced adventure

1073
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,680
games.

1074
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:51,200
Like if something like Ace Attorney was like a survival horror game.

1075
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,640
That's what Trick kind of looks like to me.

1076
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,440
I think it's Ghost Trick is what it's coming out over here as.

1077
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,440
Ah, okay.

1078
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,960
And yes, and the reason why it looks like the Ace Attorney series, it's the same guy

1079
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,240
that's doing the artwork for it.

1080
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,240
So it's not just points.

1081
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:06,960
Yeah, it is coming out over here as Ghost Trick later on from Capcom.

1082
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,080
That's it for Japan, Dark Sakura.

1083
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:13,200
Well, for Europe we have a few things.

1084
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:18,800
On the 11th, we've got Age of Conan, Rise of the God Slayer, Lost Planet 2 for Xbox

1085
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,200
360 and PS3.

1086
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:30,040
On the 14th, we have Alan Wake, Naruto Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Skate

1087
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,040
3.

1088
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,400
That's about it.

1089
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,400
Alright.

1090
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,800
Just a couple more news stories for you guys, then we're going to get into the classic game

1091
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,680
of the week.

1092
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,320
But for now, some more news?

1093
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:50,840
Yes, there was a countdown, well apparently if you got the platinum trophy on God of War

1094
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:59,120
3, it gave you a link to a website run by Ready at Dawn, teasing a new God of War game.

1095
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:02,960
Well, the new God of War game is going to be a PSP exclusive, it's called God of War

1096
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:09,480
Ghosts of Sparta, and it is also being developed by Ready at Dawn, and looks pretty awesome.

1097
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,600
No word exactly on when it's going to be coming out, probably something that will show around

1098
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:20,400
at E3, but they were saying that it's going to feature state of the art visuals, and high

1099
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:26,600
quality environments and characters, in addition, the Ghost of Sparta will offer 25% more gameplay

1100
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,560
than it's PSP predecessor.

1101
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:29,560
25%?!

1102
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:34,000
That's almost a fourth!

1103
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,280
And judging by the screenshots though, it does look pretty good.

1104
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:41,320
And I'd say it's actually really good for a PSP game.

1105
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:47,920
But I remember the God of War game, Chains of Olympus looked pretty awesome on the PSP,

1106
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,560
played quite a bit of that one, and I probably have to check this out, I haven't gotten a

1107
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:57,240
PSP game in a long time, I really need to check out a little big planet too on PSP,

1108
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,240
I think that might be cool.

1109
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:03,480
So I think they had some new levels in that, I don't know, right.

1110
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,760
You sound so speculative.

1111
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:12,080
Well, I have to find my PSP because I have like, I have a few PSPs, I can't remember

1112
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:17,040
if I have one that still has an official firmware on it, I don't think I do.

1113
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:22,600
Salacious Pop in chat says, the first PSP God of War had A++ visuals and gameplay, but

1114
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:26,000
damn was the story milk toast and lame.

1115
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,880
I like when people can use the word milk toast in a sentence.

1116
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:31,520
I have not heard that used in a sentence in a very long time.

1117
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:35,920
The last time I actually saw anything with milk toast in it was reading Bloom County.

1118
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:40,160
Anyhow, one more story for you guys, and this is something that Loki was slightly referencing

1119
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:44,640
earlier, it's actually kind of like an internet meme that ended up hitting the blogs.

1120
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:49,960
This is about, I guess a NeoJaf GAF, I would say NeoJaf or NeoGaf, I don't know.

1121
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,200
Neo games are fun.

1122
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,200
Yeah, whatever.

1123
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:57,240
That forum had a little contest, I guess you could say, a little photoshopping contest

1124
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:00,400
about what would Mario look like if it was released today.

1125
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:05,620
And some of the results are really funny, because you get kind of the achievement unlocked,

1126
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:08,840
you know, hey, you got a one up, five gamer score.

1127
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:12,320
Tutorial levels built in, you know, just kind of like they're doing with the new Mario games.

1128
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:17,720
My favorite absolutely was the one that made it look like a Facebook game, you squashed

1129
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,820
a Goomba achievement, and then it says, do you want to post this to your wall?

1130
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:24,520
You just got an achievement in Super Mario Brothers.

1131
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:28,960
So and so just got the Goomba squisher achievement and wants everyone to know.

1132
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,440
And I thought that was so on point, I mean, so on point.

1133
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,800
I mean, if you think about it, that's already there.

1134
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:43,120
And I'm just as guilty as the next guy, PSP, or sorry, PS3 will post your achievements

1135
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,120
to your wall.

1136
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,560
Remember when everybody was kind of talking about that feature?

1137
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,480
I mean, I'm sure some of you blocked it.

1138
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:53,320
But you know, when I unlock trophies in Super Street Fighter, my wall knows about it.

1139
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,320
That freaking Raptor thing.

1140
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,360
Yeah, except for those of us that blocked him.

1141
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:59,200
Alan runs that Raptor thing and every day I can see he's playing World of Warcraft.

1142
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:03,320
And so if I know if that thing doesn't publish one day, I should probably make sure he's

1143
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,320
okay.

1144
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:13,000
So, all right, anyhow, I kind of need to see some of the concepts of what would happen

1145
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,840
if Mario was released today.

1146
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:18,840
Any, any, any ideas on what how it might be different if Mario was released today that

1147
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:22,080
the chat chatters would or folks in studio?

1148
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:25,960
I think we know what Mario would be like if it's released today, because we keep getting

1149
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:26,960
Mario games.

1150
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,120
And then, yeah, they have the tutorial levels in there.

1151
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:35,400
And the reason why is because people nowadays don't want to spend the time to read the manual.

1152
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:40,280
That's, granted, I think that's a good idea.

1153
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:47,120
But remember, I know a lot of stuff now is coming out with digital, you know, digitally

1154
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,120
and stuff.

1155
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:51,280
So there isn't really necessarily manuals for it, but you think about it, though, if

1156
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:56,080
you just want to jump into a game and play it, then, you know, back then you could do

1157
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:59,020
that and there's no wasting time.

1158
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:01,880
If you don't understand what's going off, or you have difficulty, then you can refer

1159
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:02,880
to the manual.

1160
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,440
Yeah, but think about, like, some of the greatest games from the 80s that were all, like, the

1161
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,640
coin-op games.

1162
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,820
You don't have a manual.

1163
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:10,620
You should be able to just put in a quarter and play.

1164
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:13,000
The button says fire.

1165
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
That means fire!

1166
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:19,560
Well, also, I mean, there are a lot of times they would have either, like, a little brief

1167
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:24,560
tutorial, and I mean, like, five to ten second tutorial in the beginning.

1168
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:28,080
Some of the Neo Geo games would say, okay, here's what you do, and there'd be instructions

1169
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:32,800
on the cabinet so that, you know, okay, you know, 500 points gives me an extra life.

1170
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:37,320
And you know, if I hit, you know, fire and jump together, I get a special attack.

1171
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,160
Or like Street Fighter, too.

1172
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:42,640
When they started making the newer cabinets, they would actually put on there little things

1173
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,720
that had all the moves on them.

1174
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,160
Yeah.

1175
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:50,080
You can actually do that with some of the Neo Geo games that are out on Xbox Live, like,

1176
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:54,000
I know Fatal Fury Special.

1177
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,020
You can actually have the background just show that old little plastic card that has

1178
01:01:58,020 --> 01:01:59,880
the moves on it.

1179
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,600
Pretty cool.

1180
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,880
All right.

1181
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:08,240
Let's get into a segment here on the show we do every week, and it's a lot of fun because

1182
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,120
we get to talk about old stuff.

1183
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:13,480
It's a classic game of the week!

1184
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:17,600
Dark Sakura's going to dive into the vault and pull out a classic video game that she

1185
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:23,520
thinks, you know what, you ungrateful little kids out there, you should try a classic game

1186
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,560
and know your roots a little better.

1187
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,560
Do it!

1188
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:27,560
Where you came from.

1189
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:28,560
Do it!

1190
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:29,560
Delete!

1191
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:30,560
All right, so what game should they be playing this week?

1192
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:31,560
Final Fantasy II.

1193
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:32,560
Ah.

1194
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:33,560
As in...

1195
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:34,560
You mean actual Final Fantasy II.

1196
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,040
The actual Final Fantasy II.

1197
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,040
All right.

1198
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,240
Which I actually own the cartridge of, by the way.

1199
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,240
Very nice.

1200
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:47,280
We're going to take a look here at some of the music from Final Fantasy II, if we can.

1201
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,280
Let's see.

1202
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:54,200
I actually had the number that I gave you on that was to the battle music.

1203
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,200
But anyway.

1204
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,000
A little hard to get to the exact right point on YouTube.

1205
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Sorry.

1206
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Oh.

1207
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,600
Well, at any rate, this is the theme, you know.

1208
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,520
Yeah, you can skip up.

1209
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:05,520
Anyway.

1210
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:12,400
Final Fantasy II was actually pretty innovative on the, uh, an innovative sequel to the last

1211
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,400
Final Fantasy.

1212
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,440
Well, to the first one.

1213
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:25,000
It's a, of course, like every Final Fantasy with a fresh number is, it's a different series

1214
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:30,280
of characters, a different world, a different dimension.

1215
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:38,960
So this one is, there's these four people that are killed in an army invasion in Palamicia.

1216
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:43,760
And three of the characters join a rebellion and the other one turns out missing.

1217
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:49,280
So with this one, it actually brought in a lot of stuff that we, you know, take for granted

1218
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,080
now in a Final Fantasy game.

1219
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:54,720
Like chocobos and Cid.

1220
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,240
There's always a Cid.

1221
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,240
Correct.

1222
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:00,720
A lot of people assume that chocobos were in the very first game as well as Cid and

1223
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,720
they, those didn't appear till two.

1224
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:03,720
No.

1225
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,720
You are right, Rob.

1226
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:09,760
It also got rid of experience point leveling.

1227
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,720
And of course the later ones used it.

1228
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:18,200
But it used a system where statistics increased depending on how you use the character or

1229
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:22,560
how you acquire, I guess, you know.

1230
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:27,000
I keep in mind, when I first started playing this game back in the day, I was playing a

1231
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,960
ROM in Japanese and I kind of gave up.

1232
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:35,520
I played through a bit more of three than I did of two, but I'm really, I'm really enjoying

1233
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,520
it now.

1234
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:39,360
Well, the best way to level is to beat your friends, basically.

1235
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:53,240
Well, anyway, the, it's actually was kind of, well, you know, they were going to do

1236
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,200
this one, Rob.

1237
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:59,960
Nintendo actually has, what you're looking at now for our YouTube thing is off the prototype

1238
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,160
that Nintendo did.

1239
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,160
Oh wow.

1240
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:05,680
So that's where they got the prototype translation.

1241
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:10,400
This one had another really cool thing, as you can see on the video now, Rob, where you

1242
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:18,760
have a memory system where, excuse me, you can, a keyword will pop up and you can ask

1243
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:23,440
to learn the keyword and once you learn the keyword, you can go talk to different people

1244
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:27,640
and if it gives you the opportunity to ask them, you can use a different keyword and

1245
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:32,120
they'll give you new information based on using that keyword.

1246
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:38,680
Like the first one that you get in, you know, right when you joined the rebellion is, I

1247
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:43,600
think it's wild rose and you can go around and you see wild rose to random people and

1248
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,800
they're like, I'm really Ivy in this prototype.

1249
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,920
I'm really not a senile old man.

1250
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:49,920
I'm a super blacksmith.

1251
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:54,400
That's why I'm hanging out in the blacksmith shop, the blacksmith shop, anyway, he's like,

1252
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:58,440
I don't want them to think I'm anything other than a silly old man, but so your characters

1253
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:02,840
in here, and actually I don't remember that the characters had, do the characters have

1254
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,380
names?

1255
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:08,120
The warriors of light have names in the Japanese version cause I don't think they did.

1256
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:12,720
Uh, I believe, I think you could just name them and they had default names kind of like

1257
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:13,720
our words here.

1258
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:21,560
In the U S one, well, there was, you know, fighter, you know, BL mage, you know, or B

1259
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,520
major or whatever.

1260
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:30,640
Um, this one, um, the characters, you have Furion or Freoniel in the Japanese version.

1261
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:35,080
And then you've got Maria guy who, when they brought this out on PlayStation, his name

1262
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:40,080
was Gus and Leon in Japanese version, his name was Leonhardt.

1263
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:44,960
And then, um, you spend like a lot of the game looking for Leon, by the way, um, you

1264
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,240
can also get other people that hang out with you from time to time in your party, like

1265
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:56,400
Gordon and Joseph and Layla, Minwoo, uh, the PlayStation version was Mindu and, uh, Richard

1266
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,400
Highwind.

1267
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:58,400
Yeah.

1268
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,400
We noticing themes that come up in later games.

1269
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:09,120
Highwind, you know, Leonhardt sound familiar a little bit, um, again, this is one that

1270
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:13,160
really, really, you know, set a big theme.

1271
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:18,560
And also of course, Furion and Matthias, who was the emperor, um, the bad guy in the game,

1272
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:24,920
uh, they both were in Dissidia, um, as their versus each other character.

1273
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:31,320
And um, but I'm not really going to get too much into the story.

1274
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:35,240
The other thing though about this, another class that this introduced was the Dragoon.

1275
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:40,600
Um, so the Dragoon and the Dark Knight, you could, well, you could sort of get kind of

1276
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:46,960
a Dark Knight, but this was, this had Dark Knights and Dragoons in them, um, a lot more

1277
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:51,400
story driven, a lot more character driven too than the, um, previous versions.

1278
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:58,560
Um, as far as, well, the previous version, I should say, um, now another thing is that

1279
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:06,260
it did have re-releases, and I was really irritated, um, because I was waiting for Final

1280
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:10,840
Fantasy 3 to come out on the Wonderswan color, because I have the remake of the first Final

1281
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:15,480
Fantasy on the Wonderswan color, which was beautiful, it was gorgeous.

1282
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:18,400
And then Final Fantasy 2 came out, and I was like, ah, I didn't play too much of it, I

1283
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,760
was waiting for Final Fantasy 3, and then they went right to 4.

1284
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:29,980
Um, but they did, um, a collection re-release for the Playstation in 2002, um, that was based

1285
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:35,040
off the Game Boy Advance re-release of Final Fantasy 1 and 2 Dawn of Souls, and then it

1286
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:40,580
came out on mobiles later, and then, um, the PSP version in 2007, and then the Japanese

1287
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:46,400
Wii Virtual Console got, um, a version last year on June 16th.

1288
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:53,920
Now, um, what I think is super cool, and, you know, this, this makes me really happy,

1289
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:59,880
is that we've, we've had other releases now, Final Fantasy Origins was the first release

1290
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:10,440
outside of Japan, um, but it came out on iPhone, and I have been digging it on iPhone, and

1291
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:15,280
I think part of it for me was not being able to read all that well when I was playing it,

1292
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:19,840
you know, the first time, but now that I'm actually playing it in English, I'm, I'm having

1293
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:20,920
a pretty good time playing it.

1294
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:25,680
The iPhone controls are interesting, but it's, it's, it's really, I think, as good as they

1295
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:29,280
could expect to do those controls, it actually works fairly well.

1296
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:37,400
Um, the way that it sold in 2003, um, well, by March 31st, 2003, with all of its re-releases,

1297
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:46,240
it had 1.28 million copies worldwide, worldwide, and, uh, with 1.08 million of those in Japan.

1298
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:53,120
Um, it was just, it's a really good game, I suggest everyone play it, so.

1299
01:09:53,120 --> 01:10:01,000
Oh, also it got a, a novelization, um, that was, uh, put out by Kadokawa Shoutou to Japan.

1300
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
That came out in 89.

1301
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Hmm.

1302
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
So, very cool.

1303
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,880
I like that game.

1304
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:09,440
Final Fantasy II is your classic game of the week, and it's available originally on the

1305
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:13,520
NES, but probably a little more accessible on some of those, uh, redone versions, the

1306
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:19,380
Dark Sakura earlier referenced, most commonly the PSP these days, and the iPhone versions,

1307
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:21,000
so check it out, Final Fantasy II.

1308
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,680
All right, uh, we're gonna go ahead and use this opportunity to take a quick break, but

1309
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:28,000
when we come back, we have plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio, uh, we're gonna talk

1310
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,080
about some of the fan films that have hit the internet, um, a new Bimani game, and a

1311
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:36,560
new non-Bimani game, but might as well be a Bimani game, uh, and, uh, talk a little

1312
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,680
bit about, uh, a game called Baby Maker.

1313
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:41,240
Yes, that's right, Baby Maker.

1314
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:51,760
So we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, so stick around.

1315
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:58,040
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, this, uh, 366th episode of our show, May 9th,

1316
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:01,160
2010, already in progress, we're here for part B.

1317
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:05,840
More news, fast topics, and all that fun stuff, uh, in a few weeks, here at Orange Lounge

1318
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:12,080
Radio, E3 is gonna be filled with tons and tons and tons of news this year, um, sadly

1319
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:16,600
low-key Dark Sakura not able to attend due to that thing called real life, and, like,

1320
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:20,840
having a real life, like, what's up with that, uh, but me, since I have no life, I am going,

1321
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:24,680
and, um, hoping to bring you some special content from E3, we're not sure if it's gonna

1322
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:28,920
be a daily show or what, uh, but hopefully some good interviews for Orange Lounge Radio,

1323
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:32,480
and, uh, some other good stuff for the future, more info on that as we get a little closer

1324
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:33,480
to the show.

1325
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:37,960
Anyhow, uh, let's get back into some gaming news, we have some fast stuff we like to call

1326
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:43,160
rapid-fire topics, and, uh, Loki's gonna start it off.

1327
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:44,160
I hope.

1328
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,160
Yes, I am.

1329
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,160
Hey, there you go.

1330
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,840
Um, so it's kinda cool, you know, even though the game's not out yet, they're already

1331
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:53,120
talking about download content for Red Dead Redemption, and the first piece of download

1332
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:57,400
content is gonna be coming shortly after its release in June, and it will be getting a

1333
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:01,120
free co-op, um, expansion, which is kinda cool.

1334
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:06,840
They're gonna have, um, some new, I guess, I'm not sure if these are missions, including

1335
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:11,980
Walton's Gold, uh, which is apparently, uh, Walton's Gang has taken control of a mining

1336
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:16,680
camp rich with gold, and you have to fight through the camp to, uh, load your mine cart

1337
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:20,520
as with as much gold as you can carry and get out of there fast, and then they have

1338
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:25,680
the river where you ride a raft down a river, taking out rebel encampments along the way,

1339
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:30,920
and ammunition, which, uh, the Mexican army has, I guess, a town under siege, and you

1340
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:36,320
have to storm the gates under heavy cannon fire, and, um, that sounds kinda cool, and

1341
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:41,920
those are gonna be compatible with, uh, up to two to four players, and it doesn't say

1342
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:47,200
exactly when, um, they'll be coming out in June, but sometime during June.

1343
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:52,320
Also, they're saying that they're gonna be having some more, um, uh, two more additional

1344
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:59,680
download content updates over the summer, and, however, those are unlikely to be free,

1345
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:05,720
and pricing, I guess, will be announced later on, um, and then, of course, in May, we've

1346
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:13,520
got some, uh, more songs becoming available for Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero, um, starting

1347
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:20,600
off with May 6th, the Classic Rock Track Pack 3, which you can get the whole pack for 440

1348
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:29,560
Microsoft points, or $5.49 in regular money, and that includes, uh, Jukebox Hero by Foreigner,

1349
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:34,080
Sweet Home Alabama by Leonard Skynyrd, and Take the Money and Run by the Steve Miller

1350
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,080
Band.

1351
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,080
Wow.

1352
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:37,080
There really is-

1353
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,080
I love that song.

1354
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:45,060
There's a Guitar Hero pack coming out with Foreigner, Skynyrd, and Steve Miller Band.

1355
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:52,000
That's like the county fair pack right there.

1356
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Of course-

1357
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,720
I was driving home from the bay today, and, you know, you have to kind of drive through

1358
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:01,600
the middle of nowhere to get between San Francisco and SAC, right?

1359
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:07,840
And sure enough, come into Dixon, the Dixon County Fair, Foreigner, high blooded.

1360
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:16,320
And also, of course, the Classic Rock Track Pack was available May 6th, of course it will

1361
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:20,960
not be available for Playstation 3 until May 11th.

1362
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:26,720
Also on May 11th, the Alternative Pop Track Pack coming out, same pricing there.

1363
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:32,960
Included with that would be Face Down by Alpha Rev, Lode by Capra, and You're All I Have by

1364
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,400
Snow Patrol.

1365
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:42,680
Those are also available for 160 Microsoft points each, or 200 Wii points, $2 is real

1366
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:43,680
money.

1367
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:49,560
And finally, the Aerosmith Track Pack, which includes Livin' on the Edge, Lovin' an Elevator,

1368
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:50,560
and Ragdoll.

1369
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:51,560
Wait, wait, wait.

1370
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,240
Didn't Aerosmith have like a Guitar Hero game already?

1371
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:57,440
They may have with all those tracks in there, but hey, if you don't have those-

1372
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,560
Why not buy them all over again?

1373
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:00,560
Why not?

1374
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:01,560
Exactly.

1375
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:08,440
So, uh, it's too bad you can't import the tracks into your next, uh, new version of

1376
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:12,480
the game like Rock Band, otherwise that problem might not be a problem at all.

1377
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:15,320
Side note, they did confirm a Guitar Hero 6 this week.

1378
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,320
Wow.

1379
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,760
File that under no shit.

1380
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:22,960
I think they've already said that they were doing that, same with the DJ Hero 2.

1381
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:23,960
That's already been confirmed.

1382
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:24,960
Well, whatever.

1383
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:29,720
Anyways, uh, other stuff that's coming out on the Xbox Live Marketplace in May, including,

1384
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:37,000
uh, let's see here, May 17th, the deal of the week will be, uh, Secret of Monkey Island

1385
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Special Edition.

1386
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,040
You're gonna be able to get that for half off for $5.

1387
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:45,680
Uh, they're also gonna have some Avatar items as well, uh, Lee Chuck pirate hat for, uh,

1388
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:54,400
50 cents, and Avatar cotton swab, yes, the giant cotton swab for, um, I guess a dollar.

1389
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,400
Mmkay.

1390
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:59,560
Uh, you know, that's more expensive than an actual cotton swab, by the way.

1391
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:00,960
You paid a whole dollar for that?

1392
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:05,120
No, I wouldn't pay for that, but yeah, that's what they're asking for.

1393
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:08,880
Um, new games on demand are gonna be coming out, um, last week we had Brothers in Arms

1394
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:14,640
Hell's Highway and Prince of Persia, um, this week on the 11th we have Tom Clancy's End

1395
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:22,600
War, uh, May 18th in the Asian region, uh, Command & Conquer 3, and on May 25th Battlefield

1396
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:27,000
2 Modern Combat will be available in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand only.

1397
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:31,920
Well, I was gonna say, when did they start doing, like, new games on demand every week,

1398
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,200
but they're not really doing new games on demand every week, it's just that other regions

1399
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:36,200
are getting it.

1400
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:37,200
Okay.

1401
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:43,280
Um, last week we had Xenoclash Ultimate Edition for $15, 1200 microsoft points, and Raystorm

1402
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:48,600
HD also for $15, it's like $15 and new $10, I don't know.

1403
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:53,720
Uh, this week on May 12th, Rocket Knight Adventures will be coming out for $15 or 1200 microsoft

1404
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:58,840
points, and on June 2nd, which technically isn't May, even though this is a May list,

1405
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:04,280
and technically isn't a game I care about, um, Snoopy Flying Ace coming out for $10.

1406
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:05,280
Snoopy!

1407
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:08,280
Guess what, that's $10 more than you should really pay for that.

1408
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:09,960
Will Snoopy be fighting the Red Baron?

1409
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:12,560
Oh, probably, cause that's all he ever does.

1410
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,920
Get over it, that was World War II!

1411
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:18,720
Will Woodstock be in there to talk in his little lines?

1412
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:21,360
I always loved Woodstock's speech.

1413
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,360
I don't know.

1414
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:28,200
Um, and then the Avatar Marketplace will be getting some Final Fantasy XIII and Gamer

1415
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,200
items.

1416
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:32,920
I wonder if those Final Fantasy XIII items were the same ones that you got for registering

1417
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:33,920
the game.

1418
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:34,920
Don't know.

1419
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:41,480
Uh, Army of Two and Kingdom for Kefling items will be available on May 13th as well.

1420
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:46,160
Finally download content, uh, no doubt it's getting the Tragic Kingdom album for Rock

1421
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:49,560
Band, which I think that came out last week.

1422
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:51,480
Yeah, we talked about it last week.

1423
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:58,800
Uh, Lips is getting the Miley Cyrus song pack, oh boy, and, uh, Forza Motorsport 3 getting

1424
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:07,640
the Exotic Car pack, uh, Super Street Fighter IV getting the Super Shuriken pack, and, uh,

1425
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:12,520
Dragon Age Origins getting the Darkspawn Chronicles pack as well.

1426
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:17,720
And also, um, sometime, they didn't say when, Magic the Gathering Duels of the Planeswalker

1427
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:20,100
will be getting the second expansion pack.

1428
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:24,080
You know, speaking of, um, Snoopy and all that stuff, when Loki was reading a lot of

1429
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:29,640
those releases, um, you know, those really exciting releases for the month of May, uh,

1430
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:33,600
this is kind of what I was hearing was, um, a lot of, um, you know, the, uh, uh, teacher

1431
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,600
from, uh, Charlie Brown.

1432
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,600
He said my name.

1433
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,600
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah.

1434
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,600
Wah wah wah wah.

1435
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,600
Okay, Ms. Trombone.

1436
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:52,400
Alright, well, hopefully something a little more exciting, no disrespect to Loki, it's

1437
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:56,320
just there's not a lot of exciting stuff on Xbox in May, I'm sorry, it's just, I'm not

1438
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,320
hearing anything exciting.

1439
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,600
Alright, uh, how about Tron?

1440
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,600
Tron, wake up, hello, Tron, you like Tron?

1441
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:07,240
Okay, well, Tron, of course, was based around a game called Space Paranoids, was kind of

1442
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:08,520
like the game in Tron.

1443
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:13,760
Well, guess what, now, um, you can actually play Space Paranoids online.

1444
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:19,520
That's right, it's at spaceparanoidsonline.com, if you wanna actually go play the game, uh,

1445
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:20,800
you can check it out.

1446
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:24,840
Uh, apparently it was already, um, at, like, San Diego Comic Con, but now it's there in

1447
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:30,760
fifteen levels and, you know, you get to blow stuff up, have fun.

1448
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:37,040
Uh, also, uh, some new developments in the Silver Lining, uh, drama that's going on.

1449
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:40,600
You might remember the Silver Lining, um, cause we actually had them on our show a while

1450
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:41,600
ago.

1451
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:45,800
It was a fan project for a King's Quest IX, basically, but, uh, at the end of the day,

1452
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:49,000
they had to take the King's Quest name off of it if they wanted to actually release the

1453
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,160
game, and, uh, then when Activision got the rights to the game, they were like, well,

1454
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:56,520
you're not releasing that game, and they were like, but boo hoo, we spent so many years

1455
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:57,520
making it.

1456
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:03,360
Well, here's the deal, um, apparently, uh, I guess it has come full circle that, uh,

1457
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:08,360
it might actually be able to, uh, be released after all.

1458
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:13,040
Um, there's this whole epic piece that was written on the game, uh, that Kotaku ran this

1459
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:17,120
week that kind of traces everything from the beginning towards where things kind of were

1460
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:22,760
at as of April of 2010, which is when Activision really wasn't calling, uh, people, but actually

1461
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:27,320
Kotaku and some of the other folks actually started kind of bugging Activision for them,

1462
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:31,360
and, uh, Activision actually told Kotaku, um, the situation came to our attention a

1463
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:35,560
few months ago, and it seems more and more appropriate all the time that the game is

1464
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:38,960
called The Silver Lining, no matter how many stumbling blocks we run into, whether it's

1465
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:42,160
random bickering about tiny issues or what have you, I'm sorry, this is from one of the

1466
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:46,260
makers, not actual, uh, Activision there, um, there's actually, like, I guess a silver

1467
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:51,040
lining to it all that they may actually be able to release the game after all.

1468
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:56,400
So you can check that out, um, Kotaku ran this story on, um, what was this, uh, May

1469
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:01,400
3rd was the date that they ran it, and kind of this whole little epic piece about it,

1470
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:05,600
and, uh, yeah, Activision, I guess, finally getting in touch with them, realizing they

1471
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:06,600
were being dicks.

1472
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:09,000
Got the big stick out their butt.

1473
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Mm-hmm.

1474
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,440
Bobby Kotak clearly was not involved.

1475
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:18,760
Uh, also, coming out on the Wii soon, uh, a very exciting game called My Fireplace,

1476
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:22,720
that is if the ESRB is to be believed, there will be a game called My Fireplace, and you'll

1477
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:28,720
be able to actually, you know, have your own fireplace, you can put logs on the fire and

1478
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:32,600
decorate the mantle, and pump air in the fireplace to keep it going.

1479
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,400
That better be free.

1480
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:40,400
Sadly, it's, it's probably WiiWare, I would guess it's probably gonna be $10 WiiWare.

1481
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,800
Well, people do buy those fireplace DVDs.

1482
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:47,260
And Blu-rays now, and, uh, didn't Xbox have one of those last year?

1483
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:48,260
A fireplace sim?

1484
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:49,260
Mm-hmm.

1485
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:53,480
I think an Xbox fireplace sim is the more appropriate, you know, console for that, being

1486
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:57,360
that it can put out the heat of a fireplace as well.

1487
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:03,600
Ba-dum-bum, uh, yeah, the, uh, Wii, uh, fireplace thing deserves to be in the, uh, fireplace.

1488
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:07,960
My JTAG console, because I do have programs on there that measure the, um, heat off of

1489
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:08,960
it.

1490
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:14,280
The GPO on it runs about 77 degrees Celsius, and, let me put it this way, uh, for like

1491
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:19,240
your, your regular dual core chips, that's like, that's way too hot.

1492
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:20,240
Way too fuckin' hot.

1493
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:25,800
Thankfully, you can use a software, uh, mod in there to upgrade the fans to 12 volt mods,

1494
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:31,840
and it drops temperature down to like 50, but, seriously, 77 degrees Celsius, your Intel

1495
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,120
processor chips don't run that hot.

1496
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:39,200
Uh, real quick before we get to Dark Soccer's story, some comments from our chat room, uh,

1497
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:43,160
some of the folks in chat, um, are, uh, DJ Dark Knight says, can't wait for Rocket Knight,

1498
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:47,000
and Act F says Rocket Knight, awesome, so I guess there is at least one, uh, game to

1499
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:52,400
look forward to in May, um, and Toygak, uh, commenting on the Wii fireplace, says, uh,

1500
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:56,680
fucking shitty WiiWare can go choke on a piece of my anatomy.

1501
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,520
I'll leave, uh, that to your imagination.

1502
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:59,520
Elbow!

1503
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,800
That's right, go choke on an elbow.

1504
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:02,800
Pork chop.

1505
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:03,800
That's right.

1506
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:04,960
Suck my kneecap.

1507
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:08,040
I've just been telling Dan that I'm gonna punch him in the pork chop so that he can

1508
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:11,540
specify in his brain whatever organ he wishes that to be.

1509
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:13,840
It was the liver for a while.

1510
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:19,440
Anyway, um, for Star Trek fans, there is an unofficial demo, I'm sorry, an unofficial

1511
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:25,200
Star Trek game, um, that's got a demo, uh, out, it's, uh, called, uh, Star Trek Adventures

1512
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:32,400
Year One, it's a fan project, it looks kinda, well, not great, but-

1513
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,040
A fan project!

1514
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:35,040
Yeah.

1515
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:42,040
Um, it, it looks along the lines of, uh, old school Star Trek games, like maybe from the,

1516
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:46,280
uh, late, mid to late 90s possibly.

1517
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:55,760
Um, you can, uh, go to, uh, the, uh, official homepage for the, uh, uh, project, which is

1518
01:23:55,760 --> 01:24:00,260
just StarTrekAdventuresAllInWord.com slash year one.

1519
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:04,320
See if you like it, let us know, I won't play it, I've got Star Trek Online.

1520
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:07,520
And the next story, which is one that Rob gave me the wrong link to and I had to go

1521
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:08,520
find.

1522
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,520
Oh, I'm sorry, my bad.

1523
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:10,800
Yeah, you sound so sad.

1524
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,120
I'm sorry you had to do work tonight, Jamie, I'm very sorry to inconvenience you.

1525
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,120
Hey!

1526
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,120
I do work!

1527
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:17,120
It requires pirates!

1528
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,120
Argh!

1529
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:19,120
Plundering!

1530
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,120
Shooting!

1531
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:23,120
Plundering the booty!

1532
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,120
Keelhauling!

1533
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:31,600
Um, it will be on the Wii in the fall and has, um, so it's got some mini games, it's

1534
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:39,560
put up by 2K China, oooh, with streamlined controls for the Wii mode, oooh!

1535
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:46,080
And so the mini games, um, the two new ones would be Bombardment and Lockpicking, oooh,

1536
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:51,760
and you can have character and ship customization options, oooh.

1537
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:57,960
Anyway, um, and last but never least, except in this case, Rock Band!

1538
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:01,400
We will be getting stuff!

1539
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:07,980
Mostly, um, actually all consisting of a Judas Priest British Steel 30th Anniversary Complete

1540
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:16,480
Album Pack, which will be, um, 1200 points, or $14.99 US dollars, including on it Breaking

1541
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:17,480
the Law!

1542
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:19,480
Breaking the Law!

1543
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:26,000
And Rapid Fire, Metal Gods, Grinder, United, Living After Midnight, Midnight, You Don't

1544
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,520
Have to be Old to be Wise, The Rage and Stealer, but you know what's all for me?

1545
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:31,520
Breaking the Law!

1546
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,520
Breaking the Law!

1547
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,120
Or Washing the Dog!

1548
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:35,880
Washing the Dog!

1549
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,320
Wow.

1550
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:38,760
You remember that?

1551
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:39,760
Yes.

1552
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,760
And I tried very hard to forget.

1553
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:47,880
That was like my favorite episode of Beavis and Butthead, you know, they put the dog in

1554
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:51,280
the dryer, then they put Beavis in the dryer.

1555
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:54,560
My favorite- I threw up on the dog, I threw up on you.

1556
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,880
My favorite episode of Beavis and Butthead was with the gym teacher, today we're gonna

1557
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:00,440
talk about the penis!

1558
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:02,120
And then we'll talk about the vagina!

1559
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:05,480
I think I played that clip on OLR a few weeks ago.

1560
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:06,480
Yeah, I love it.

1561
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:07,480
That was my favorite episode of Beavis and Butthead.

1562
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:08,480
You should play that again soon.

1563
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:09,480
You want me to play that again soon?

1564
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:10,480
Play that again now.

1565
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,480
Well, it's gonna take me a minute to find it.

1566
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,480
Soon.

1567
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:14,480
Soon.

1568
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:17,240
You know what, just randomly later in the show, I'll play that clip from Beavis and

1569
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,240
Butthead.

1570
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:19,720
You won't know when, but it will happen.

1571
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:24,040
It'll be during one of my stories, I'm sure.

1572
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:25,160
This'll be mad.

1573
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:29,640
And yeah, this game's gonna come out, and it's probably gonna suck, and today we're

1574
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:33,640
talking about the penis!

1575
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:34,640
What?

1576
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:38,880
What do you think of my Loki impression?

1577
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:39,880
I have the wah-wah-wah.

1578
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:40,880
It was very good.

1579
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:41,880
I think I was pretty small.

1580
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:42,880
A little more anger.

1581
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:43,880
A little more anger.

1582
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:52,000
No, I was going for disinterested yet snarky.

1583
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,000
That's me, alright.

1584
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Hey, Loki.

1585
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Hart.

1586
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Hart.

1587
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Hart.

1588
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Needs more Smashburger.

1589
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Twitter topics!

1590
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Yay!

1591
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Twitter.

1592
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Saving the show from being a complete trainwreck.

1593
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Hey!

1594
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Every week we take your tweets.

1595
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,320
Show us your tweets at twitter.com slash o-l-r.

1596
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:09,480
Blue Swim starts us off tonight.

1597
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:15,920
O-l-r, if you could only have one CD or album to listen to forever while killing the undead

1598
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:20,440
after the zombie apocalypse, what would it be?

1599
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:24,880
Oh, one album left ever?

1600
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:28,920
Yes, while killing the undead after the zombie apocalypse.

1601
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:32,960
See for me, that changes it, because that's not asking like my Desert Island CD, but you're

1602
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:36,880
asking what CD am I going to kill all the zombies to after the apocalypse.

1603
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:40,200
That kind of changes my answer a little bit.

1604
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:46,700
I would have to, you know, for me, because all I listen to is custom CDs anyway, I'd

1605
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:48,800
actually, I'd have one of two.

1606
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:53,240
Now, if I was just watching the zombies, it would definitely be the soundtrack to Shaun

1607
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:54,240
of the Dead.

1608
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:59,280
But, if I'm out there killing them, it would be Anthrax's Attack of the Killer Bees.

1609
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:06,440
Just so I can put, bring the noise on repeat, and just wail on zombies with crowbar.

1610
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:08,800
And remember, Rob, double tap.

1611
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:15,760
Mine would be the soundtrack to Lost Highway, which is a completely screwed up movie that

1612
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:18,360
had a great soundtrack that would be great for zombie killing.

1613
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:21,200
Loki, do you have a zombie killing CD?

1614
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:25,360
I don't know, um...

1615
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:28,400
Bochi Kawa says I'd have to do zombie killing to Space Channel 5.

1616
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:32,480
Hey, I put Mexican Flyer in Kage March 1, it's cheey, cheey.

1617
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:33,480
I don't really know.

1618
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:38,000
I don't have any, like, albums that would necessarily be good for zombie killing.

1619
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
I guess...

1620
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
I don't know.

1621
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
No?

1622
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
No ideas?

1623
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Alright, fine.

1624
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:47,000
We can do the Top Gun soundtrack, because that would be funny.

1625
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,600
There you go, Top Gun soundtrack, I like that idea.

1626
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:57,280
I'm back to the danger zone, boom!

1627
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:01,480
Take my breath away, bang!

1628
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:04,760
Eat your brains away, bam!

1629
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:05,760
We used to have...

1630
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:09,600
I have to tell you, I have to tell you the funny story about Becky Sun, because it's

1631
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:10,600
sort of related to that.

1632
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:11,600
Okay, please.

1633
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:16,160
Um, I was just playing with Julian and we were talking and I was like, what's in your

1634
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:17,160
head?

1635
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:19,880
I was like, he's like, brains!

1636
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:20,880
Yeah.

1637
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,400
I was like, what are your brains like?

1638
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,400
Spicy!

1639
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:28,600
I think I'm gonna have to go with Mae Satsuma, Rob Zombie.

1640
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:29,600
Dude!

1641
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,600
A Rob Zombie album.

1642
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:31,600
Yeah.

1643
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:34,800
No, no, it would have to be the old school White Zombie album from 93.

1644
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,240
Oh god.

1645
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:37,240
You know which one?

1646
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:38,240
More human than human!

1647
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:39,240
More human than human!

1648
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:40,240
Yeah.

1649
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:41,240
Seriously?

1650
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:42,660
That's my White Zombie impression.

1651
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:44,840
Kinda sounds like an angry St. Bernard.

1652
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:46,840
More human than human!

1653
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:47,840
Woof woof woof woof!

1654
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:51,600
Okay, SSG100 Matt says, Blues Brothers theme for when you're driving.

1655
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,960
And then Frisbee says, blow my parts away.

1656
01:29:53,960 --> 01:30:01,000
You guys are kinda weird in chat, but you know what, actually, I know actually what

1657
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,200
music would be perfect.

1658
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:08,240
Would be just absolutely perfect for Loki to be killing too.

1659
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:13,360
I believe he would have to have this old soundtrack and would kill the zombies to this.

1660
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:20,760
That's the sexy party song.

1661
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:30,040
I would play any video game where this is the beat song.

1662
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:31,920
Yaris 2, Pute Rain.

1663
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:32,920
Benny Hill.

1664
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:35,920
Was there ever a Benny Hill video game?

1665
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:43,000
You know what, the weirdness in my brain just went from show theme to show theme to show

1666
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,280
theme imagining killing zombies to.

1667
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:47,640
And you know what I finally settled on, Rob?

1668
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:49,640
The facts of life.

1669
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:56,520
You take the good, you take the bad.

1670
01:30:56,520 --> 01:31:01,280
Could you imagine it just be skipping along with your Uzi?

1671
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:08,640
Aw, I was trying to play it for you guys.

1672
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:11,580
Stupid YouTube is like too quiet sometimes.

1673
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:13,120
So okay, killing zombies to this.

1674
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:14,120
Here we go.

1675
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:19,760
Oh, this is the stupid pilot episode.

1676
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:20,760
This doesn't work.

1677
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:21,760
Damn it.

1678
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,440
How hard is it to find the stupid facts of life theme song?

1679
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:24,440
Christ.

1680
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:25,440
There you go.

1681
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:26,440
Here we go.

1682
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:41,480
That was like later in the series right before it stopped being a girl school.

1683
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:47,240
And they like sized down most of the cast.

1684
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:49,240
Aw, Tootie.

1685
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:54,240
Claire was such a bitch.

1686
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,240
Anyway.

1687
01:31:55,240 --> 01:32:03,640
I bet Blue Sword had no idea his question would turn into this.

1688
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:08,360
X-Link said I would use the song that Betty White sang last night on SNL.

1689
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:09,720
Let's move to the next topic, Rob.

1690
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:10,720
Yes, please, please.

1691
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:12,440
I could listen to old theme songs all night.

1692
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:13,840
One more.

1693
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:16,440
Frisbee says having a wonderful time by Tiny Tim.

1694
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:17,440
Alright.

1695
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:20,560
And now a couple of chatters are asking, what about the Golden Girls theme?

1696
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:21,560
Alright.

1697
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:24,760
MissingNo64 is asking, we need to go back to Twitter topics, please.

1698
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:26,840
Can we all get in the right state of mind, please?

1699
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:28,320
Let me play the music.

1700
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:29,320
Twitter.

1701
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:31,960
Get you back on a Twitter topic, Moon.

1702
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:35,440
MissingNo wants to know, did you ever put up the PAX East All Games mini show?

1703
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:38,280
I thought I did, but maybe not.

1704
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:40,280
I know it aired on the All Games.

1705
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:42,160
Did I really never put that up?

1706
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:43,160
Maybe I didn't.

1707
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:44,160
Fail.

1708
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,160
Oops.

1709
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:46,160
My bad.

1710
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:47,160
We'll have to take care of that.

1711
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:48,160
Let me know.

1712
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:49,160
I don't.

1713
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:52,120
Somebody like Dark Tetsuya or Tiger Claw or somebody that knows this show or Misty would

1714
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:53,440
know if I put that up or not.

1715
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,920
So I will.

1716
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:56,920
Maybe I do need to put it up.

1717
01:32:56,920 --> 01:32:58,920
I thought I did.

1718
01:32:58,920 --> 01:32:59,920
Oops.

1719
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:05,360
ActDeft sends us a link to Obama chat and yes, this has to do with games because apparently

1720
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:09,800
during a grad speech, he actually was kind of dissing video games a little bit.

1721
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:15,000
He apparently was speaking at Hampton University in Virginia and saying, quote, you're coming

1722
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,720
of age in a 24-7 media environment that bombards us with all kinds of content and exposes us

1723
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:24,520
to all kinds of arguments, some of which don't always rank all that high on the truth meter.

1724
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:30,040
With iPods and iPads and Xboxes and PlayStations, none of which I know how to work, information

1725
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:35,040
becomes a distraction, a diversion, a form of entertainment rather than a tool of empowerment

1726
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:37,520
rather than the means of emancipation.

1727
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:40,480
All of this is not only putting new pressures on you, it's putting new pressures on our

1728
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:45,320
country and on our democracy.

1729
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:46,320
I don't know.

1730
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:47,320
I mean.

1731
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:50,040
I don't think he was specifically talking about just video games.

1732
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:51,760
I don't take that as a slam.

1733
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:55,560
I'll take that as a turn off the console and go play outside.

1734
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:56,560
Yeah.

1735
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:59,120
I, you know, and there's nothing wrong with a distraction or diversion.

1736
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:03,360
I mean, even President Obama takes vacations to Hawaii, you know, so everybody needs a

1737
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:06,080
diversion every now and then.

1738
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,080
But I think he's just saying.

1739
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:10,760
Listen as a person, you want to take vacations.

1740
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:12,960
Imagine the stress.

1741
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:16,120
And Black Wolf in chat is quick to point out that, wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1742
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:17,120
wait.

1743
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:18,320
Obama has an iPod and a Blackberry.

1744
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:21,600
He did give the Queen of England an iPod, did he not?

1745
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:24,320
So I think one of his speech writers fucked up.

1746
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:25,320
Oops.

1747
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:26,320
What?

1748
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:27,320
What?

1749
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:28,320
What?

1750
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:29,320
That's different.

1751
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:30,320
That's.

1752
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:31,320
I know.

1753
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:32,320
And Black Wolf says he's addicted to his Blackberry.

1754
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:37,160
Well, then again, wasn't it the country, the president, the Prime Minister of Finland,

1755
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:40,720
I believe it was, or one of those area countries.

1756
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:47,160
When the volcanic ash hit Europe, he was stuck in New York running country business from

1757
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:48,820
his iPad.

1758
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:52,840
So that's more of a, that's more of a necessity type of thing.

1759
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:56,280
I mean, even me, I'd be lost without my iPhone now because I run my life by it.

1760
01:34:56,280 --> 01:35:01,480
In my big fat opinion, it's not the tool, it's how you use it.

1761
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:07,160
I mean, you can use your iPad to be completely unproductive or you could be pretty productive

1762
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:08,160
with it.

1763
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:09,520
It really just depends on how you use it.

1764
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:15,000
You can use your iPad to play stupid video games all day, or you could use it to write

1765
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
a novel.

1766
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,400
I mean, it's just however you choose to use it.

1767
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:21,400
But I don't know.

1768
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:22,620
I use mine for both.

1769
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:29,760
It's probably more of a speech writer than it is a actual Obama quote, but whatever.

1770
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:31,600
I didn't say it if he doesn't agree with it.

1771
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:34,560
TigerClaw305 linked us to a multitude of stories.

1772
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:37,160
I'm only going to pick a couple of these here.

1773
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:40,080
But I did want to point out one of them that he linked us to were screenshots from Marvel

1774
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,520
versus Capcom 3.

1775
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:44,760
And we were actually kind of looking at these before the show and maybe he'll post the link

1776
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:46,780
in chat for you guys to kind of take a peek at.

1777
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:50,280
But most of them involve Wolverine and Ryu in some fashion, although there's some other

1778
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:52,460
characters making a little appearance here.

1779
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:56,960
Definitely has that Street Fighter IV, a little bit of hybrid with Tatsunoko versus Capcom.

1780
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:00,920
What I thought was most interesting was the character bio section, which seems to confirm

1781
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:04,560
some of the characters that will be in the game, including Dante, which I thought was

1782
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:11,160
pretty awesome from Devil May Cry is there, Deadpool, it made Dark Soccer, Squee, of course,

1783
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:12,160
Iron Man.

1784
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:14,960
You got to have that because, you know, smashing box office records, or actually, no, I don't

1785
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:18,640
think it smashed records this weekend, but it did very well.

1786
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:23,400
Felicia Morgan and all the hot chicks from Dark Stalkers, Captain America.

1787
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:24,400
Was that from again?

1788
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:25,400
Felicia and Morgan?

1789
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:28,240
No, no, no, uh, the, uh, scan.

1790
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:33,320
Oh, I don't know, it must be some magazine that's coming out soon, I don't know, he linked

1791
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:37,120
me to a website here that had it, so I'm assuming it's some magazines running these screens

1792
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:42,240
soon, because if you look at some of the screenshots, you can see, like, a little, little, uh, caption

1793
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,240
there.

1794
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:44,240
That's, that's some sexy stuff right there.

1795
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:47,160
Uh, looks like it'd be a pretty hot game, so looking forward to that.

1796
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:50,000
I'm assuming Spider-Man's in there since the Daily Bugle.

1797
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,000
It's gotta be.

1798
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,080
So, big thanks to Tigerclaw for linking us to that, because we were actually peeking

1799
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:55,840
at that before the show tonight.

1800
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,040
Only a year away.

1801
01:36:57,040 --> 01:37:00,080
Now, I thought this story was definitely worth talking about.

1802
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:02,920
I think some of his others we already touched on, but I wanted to definitely bring this

1803
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:03,920
one up.

1804
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:08,200
There are some, uh, rumors going around this week that Zynga is going to split from Facebook,

1805
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:11,680
and this is actually something I think, I think Alan had brought up with me the other

1806
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,680
night.

1807
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:17,880
Um, actually talking about some of the, um, uh, splits that were going on with, um, Zynga,

1808
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:22,560
that apparently, uh, they are making, you know, Mafia Wars, and, uh, some of these other

1809
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:26,680
games, you know, uh, Farmville, of course, they are thinking about splitting from Facebook.

1810
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:29,280
Actually, it might have been SEG that was talking to me about this.

1811
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:31,400
I think it was SEG at dinner the other night.

1812
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:35,920
Um, they are actually wanting to launch their own social gaming network, and, uh, I think

1813
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:39,720
it's because there's tensions between Zynga and Facebook, because, well, Facebook just

1814
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:41,780
implemented these whole token things recently.

1815
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:44,800
They basically want to kind of go with the Apple methodology.

1816
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:46,920
You know what, it had to be SEG, because I think he was making the comparisons to the

1817
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:47,920
Apple thing.

1818
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:53,320
Uh, this whole Apple methodology of, that they want such a big cut of the profits, but

1819
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:58,000
maybe, um, you know, maybe they shouldn't be entitled to that.

1820
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
I don't know.

1821
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:03,880
So, uh, apparently, um, yep, Zynga's, uh, wanting to split off from Facebook.

1822
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:08,800
However, Facebook is trying to pressure them into a long-term deal, trying to strong-arm

1823
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:09,800
them.

1824
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:11,440
Uh, I guess there was an all-hands meeting at Zynga.

1825
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:17,000
I personally think they would be completely fucking stupid to split off from, um, Facebook,

1826
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:22,080
because if they do, they're just another, like, pogo.com, iWin, or one of those other,

1827
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:24,800
uh, game network websites, and I don't think they're going to stick out.

1828
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:28,720
I mean, yeah, they have FarmVille, but people play FarmVille because it's a Facebook game,

1829
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:30,600
and they can use all those integrations with Facebook.

1830
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:33,040
I think they would just be kind of ridiculous to do that.

1831
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:34,600
They'd be committing suicide.

1832
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:39,080
Um, not that I'd really care if they did do that.

1833
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:43,640
I'm just saying, from a business standpoint, I think it's kind of dumb.

1834
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:46,720
And the Dark Tetsuya wanted to work in a quick plug for his new article, which I think is

1835
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:48,240
worth, uh, plugging.

1836
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:51,880
It's on our website, and they gave it a new title instead of a look back.

1837
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:54,040
Remember how I said that wasn't extreme enough?

1838
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:58,000
It's now called Retro Rear View.

1839
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
I like that.

1840
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Ha ha ha.

1841
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
I like that.

1842
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Retro Rear View.

1843
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:06,720
And, uh, this week is all about, I have never fucking heard of this, the Marty, the FM Towns

1844
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:07,720
Marty.

1845
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:13,240
It was a Japanese computer in 1991 by Fujitsu, and, uh, Dark Tetsuya tells us a whole lot

1846
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:16,000
of information about that at OrangeLawnTradio.com.

1847
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,400
Actual content on our website, OMG.

1848
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:20,400
Pretty awesome.

1849
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,560
Thanks to all of the folks that contribute at OrangeLawnTradio.com.

1850
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:25,080
Alright, that's it for Twitter Topics tonight.

1851
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:28,160
Twitter.com slash O-L-R, at us, be our friend, yay.

1852
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:29,160
We like friends.

1853
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:32,960
Alright, let's move on to some more gaming news, and then your phone calls in a little

1854
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:33,960
while.

1855
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:34,960
Loki?

1856
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:39,720
Uh, yes, this week there was a lot of different fan films being released out on the internet.

1857
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:43,320
Um, some were good, some were kind of eh.

1858
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:48,160
Um, and I actually watched all of them, so that helps.

1859
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:51,280
So let's start off with, uh, Street Fighter Legacy.

1860
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:56,680
It was the one they were kind of teasing last week, um, with, you know, Ken and Ryu and

1861
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:57,680
pictures of it.

1862
01:39:57,680 --> 01:40:03,720
And it's supposed to be, you know, done with, uh, the blessing of Capcom and, uh, being

1863
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:11,120
done by, uh, Owen, Trevor, and, uh, Joey Ansa, uh, with Street Lane Films.

1864
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:13,680
Um, so I watched it.

1865
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:20,960
The positives on it, at least Ken looks like Ken in this one, and Ryu, or Ryu, I guess,

1866
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:21,960
eh.

1867
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:22,960
Alright, I guess.

1868
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:27,360
Um, but he looks, compared, because there were two Street Fighter, um, short films.

1869
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:34,180
Both happened to be in a forest, both with, uh, Ryu and Ken, um, but props to them for

1870
01:40:34,180 --> 01:40:35,880
nailing the appearance of Ken.

1871
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:37,960
Um, so that's pretty cool.

1872
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:39,960
Ryu, not so much.

1873
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:43,440
And, uh, the effects in it, eh, they're alright.

1874
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,360
Um, the other Street Fighter film-

1875
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:46,360
The fan film.

1876
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:47,360
Pretty good.

1877
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:48,360
Yeah.

1878
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:49,360
Alright.

1879
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:50,360
Better than anything I could do, that's for damn sure.

1880
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:56,420
The one I liked better, though, um, was actually, uh, the Street Fighter Beginnings End.

1881
01:40:56,420 --> 01:41:01,360
And for me, I liked the way it was shot better, uh, and the effects were kind of cool.

1882
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:06,660
But Ken looks stupid, because he looks like he just has a wig on, and it was just ridiculous.

1883
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:10,400
But Ryu looked pretty cool, and, um, definitely worth checking out.

1884
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:11,920
Both of those, I think, are on YouTube.

1885
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:16,760
Now, the one that was actually a little bit more impressive, and a lot longer, was actually

1886
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:19,120
the full-length Mega Man short film, which I-

1887
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:24,000
I don't even want to even call it a short film, because it's 90 minutes long, um, it's

1888
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,880
actually being shown on Screw Attack, and you may remember there was, like, some teasers

1889
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:30,400
for it before different screenshots and stuff.

1890
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:36,440
Um, having watched it, it is kind of long, and roll really gets on your nerves, because

1891
01:41:36,440 --> 01:41:42,200
it's, like, some Japanese chick wearing, like, this really weird, uh, blonde wig.

1892
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:43,200
Um.

1893
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:45,800
Yeah, I watched that last night.

1894
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:51,000
And, and the CG effects are okay, but some of the characters, like Iceman and, uh, Fireman,

1895
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,920
stuff like that, they're just dudes in, like, dirt bike gear.

1896
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:59,280
And, you know, that's okay, I guess, because of budget-wise, but, I mean, when you have

1897
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:06,040
full CG, like, Cutsman and Gutsman, you kind of wish that the rest were all CG as well.

1898
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:09,920
And Wily was kind of weird looking.

1899
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:16,360
But overall, it was kind of cool, um, might be fun to check it out, but wish there was

1900
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:19,860
a little bit more polish on it, I guess.

1901
01:42:19,860 --> 01:42:20,860
But hell, you know.

1902
01:42:20,860 --> 01:42:21,860
But they're fan projects.

1903
01:42:21,860 --> 01:42:24,560
Exactly, it's a fan project, and, you know, good job for them.

1904
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:29,560
Um, it's just, you know, some of the stuff just, you know, some of the characters were

1905
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:34,520
kind of like, damn, I wish, you know, this was- because they had some of those, uh, renders

1906
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:38,120
that people were doing for, like, some of the Mega Man 2 characters, and they just looked

1907
01:42:38,120 --> 01:42:39,120
awesome.

1908
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:43,480
Um, I just kind of wish they were doing the same thing with these guys.

1909
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:46,280
But, uh, hey, props to them, it was pretty cool.

1910
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:51,100
All right, well, um, let's move on to another game that has something to do a little bit

1911
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:54,680
with Bamani, but it's not really Bamani, it's a new music-based game that's coming out on

1912
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:55,680
the Wii.

1913
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:57,740
Uh, it's In The Mix, featuring Armin van Buren.

1914
01:42:57,740 --> 01:43:00,760
You remember this game, you know, we heard little rumblings about this a few months ago,

1915
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:02,280
but then it kind of slipped off the radar.

1916
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:06,480
Well, apparently, it is coming back, um, it was originally going to come out fall of 2009

1917
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:12,080
against DJ Hero, but it was delayed, uh, the game is now set to come out on June 26th in

1918
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:13,080
Europe.

1919
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:14,080
Hey, that's my birthday.

1920
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:18,160
Um, no word about a North American release yet, so I should state this is right now a,

1921
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:22,280
uh, Europe-only game, which makes sense, because unfortunately, this type of music has a much

1922
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:26,480
better following over there than it does here, so, I don't know, I'd be a little worried

1923
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:28,320
if this thing would even come out over here.

1924
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:32,040
Um, there are some new screenshots that are posted with the, uh, of the game.

1925
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:34,180
Apparently, um, there's no note markers.

1926
01:43:34,180 --> 01:43:38,520
It seems like you do more of, like, a twist thing, where you kind of, like, maybe go through

1927
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:41,400
these tunnels and maybe point at things.

1928
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:43,440
You would gesture, maybe, to glow.

1929
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:45,920
We really don't know what the hell this game's about.

1930
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,520
But we do have song lists!

1931
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:48,520
Woohoo!

1932
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:52,440
Uh, pretty much, as you can imagine, lots and lots of Armin van Buren songs and, uh,

1933
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:54,080
you know, featured tracks.

1934
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:57,560
But what I did think was interesting and worth pointing out, especially for you Bimani fans,

1935
01:43:57,560 --> 01:44:01,280
um, you might remember there were some songs in BeatMania 2DX that were pretty popular.

1936
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:04,960
The Sound of Goodbye with Perpetuous Dreamer, that is going to be in this game.

1937
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:10,720
Uh, Fly Away by Vincent D'Amore, also in the game, a Cosmic Gate remix, um, they did the,

1938
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:12,520
uh, Somewhere Over the Rainbow from DDR.

1939
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:16,800
Uh, Flotation by Vincent D'Amore, that's one of my favorite 2DX songs they ever did.

1940
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,000
That is going to be in this game.

1941
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,000
So that's kind of cool.

1942
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,920
Uh, Stringer by Riva, uh, Push is in the game.

1943
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:26,820
I mean, there's just lots and lots of those, uh, trancy bands that you probably hear on

1944
01:44:26,820 --> 01:44:28,880
his podcast all in this game.

1945
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:31,260
So, um, yeah, it looks pretty cool.

1946
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:34,320
It's too bad that, um, the game might only come out in Europe, but I guess since we have

1947
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:37,920
some, uh, listeners over there, I guess you get something we don't.

1948
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:42,120
So, I don't want to hear all that bitching about, um, you know, that we get all the games,

1949
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:44,200
because I don't know if we'll ever get that one.

1950
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:45,200
We'll see though.

1951
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:48,200
Anyhow, uh, Dar Sakura.

1952
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:50,400
Oh, yes.

1953
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:55,720
This is actually, and I, I, I was, I'm debating with myself because I want them, but I'm probably

1954
01:44:55,720 --> 01:44:57,120
not going to get them.

1955
01:44:57,120 --> 01:45:04,360
They are, um, they made little, um, River City Ransom characters, or as the original

1956
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:08,480
was the hot-blooded downtown story, and they're so cute.

1957
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:16,120
Um, they actually were shown at the Treasure Festo show going on in Japan, little, um,

1958
01:45:16,120 --> 01:45:21,520
custom kits that are, um, they have, like, the two main guys and then some of the other

1959
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:26,760
guys that you can beat up to, and, um, it's just so cute.

1960
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:30,720
It's put up by, uh, Tomopop.

1961
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:31,720
They're adorable.

1962
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:35,720
And, and, no, it's not River City Ransom, technically.

1963
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:40,120
Like I said, it's hot, um, it's a hot-blooded downtown story, but it's got all kinds of

1964
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:43,600
cute little guys and it's adorable.

1965
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:44,600
I want.

1966
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:47,600
They look cute.

1967
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:54,320
Um, Team Fortress 2 The Engineer is finally getting its update thanks to a teaser trailer

1968
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:55,320
that was released.

1969
01:45:55,320 --> 01:46:00,200
Um, no word exactly on what upgrades he's going to be getting, but there's a lot of

1970
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:06,200
kind of stuff that if you read between the lines, um, some of the stuff that you see

1971
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:11,560
in the background in the video that perhaps it's going to be, um, being added, including

1972
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:17,520
they have, like, some sort of Iron Man type of, uh, helmet thing, um, on the workbench,

1973
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:21,200
some sort of, uh, robotic arm and a blueprint.

1974
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:26,880
So, no word exactly on when, um, the update's coming, but it is kind of neat, though, that

1975
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:30,240
they keep adding updates to this game.

1976
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:35,280
Yeah, that game's, like, three years old at this point, isn't it?

1977
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:36,280
Yeah.

1978
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:37,280
It's extremely old.

1979
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:38,280
All right.

1980
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:42,360
Well, a game that's rather new, but about something, oh, very old-fashioned for all

1981
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:45,960
of us, is a game called Baby Maker Extreme.

1982
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:48,800
Yes, there is a trailer out for Baby Maker Extreme.

1983
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:52,160
I guess the game is actually out on, um, Xbox Live Marketplace right now.

1984
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:53,160
Um, it's-

1985
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:54,160
Yeah.

1986
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:55,160
Community games.

1987
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:56,160
80, oh, sorry, yeah, that's what I meant.

1988
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:57,160
Community games.

1989
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:58,160
Indie games, whatever.

1990
01:46:58,160 --> 01:46:59,160
80 Microsoft points for this game.

1991
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:02,960
Um, and let me just kind of play the trailer for you guys and describe what's going on

1992
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:04,360
in, uh, Baby Maker Extreme.

1993
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:07,120
No, it's not just sex, okay?

1994
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:09,160
But it is about the joy of, uh, giving birth.

1995
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:14,800
In fact, you push A to experience the miracle of childbirth, and, uh, you know, you would

1996
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:18,880
control your breathing in this game, just like a real mother, and use the L-T-R-T to

1997
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:22,640
breathe as you go back and forth, and that's, like, to build out the power, and then it's

1998
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:28,240
you get ready to push, and you hit B as fast as you can to get ready to push.

1999
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:32,120
You just keep slamming on that B button.

2000
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:35,200
And then, uh, what's next?

2001
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:37,200
Probably screaming for drugs and then a C-section.

2002
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:40,240
No, no, it gets better.

2003
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:42,600
Well, they don't show you what happens next, but I believe-

2004
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:43,600
Featuring avatars.

2005
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:46,800
I believe you push the A button, and the baby goes flying through the air.

2006
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:52,400
No, featuring avatars, but have you seen- did you watch the whole trailer?

2007
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:59,040
That's right, you have your avatars get born out of this woman, and you can give them scuba

2008
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:01,120
gear and shoes and a vest.

2009
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:04,680
And I'm right, they go shooting, it's like one of those, uh, rocket-like launching games,

2010
01:48:04,680 --> 01:48:05,680
right?

2011
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:06,680
Like Baby Launcher?

2012
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:08,120
The baby goes flying through the air, right?

2013
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:09,120
Kick the baby!

2014
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:10,120
Amazing.

2015
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:11,120
Don't kick the baby.

2016
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:12,920
Hey, that sounds like it's worth a buck.

2017
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:13,920
I know.

2018
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:14,920
One whole dollar.

2019
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:15,920
That's just awful.

2020
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:16,920
Awfully funny.

2021
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:19,960
Can I have my wife play it?

2022
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:20,960
You should.

2023
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:22,840
Does he- you know, how far along is she now?

2024
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:24,720
She is 25 weeks.

2025
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:27,880
She should be kind of practicing, you know, for the big day.

2026
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:28,880
So she might want to look at that.

2027
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:29,880
Alright.

2028
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:31,880
I don't know if she's concerned about that at all.

2029
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:32,880
Alright.

2030
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:38,800
Well, we are going to get into the mailbag segment here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2031
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:42,440
Um, every week you guys send us your emails.

2032
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:45,520
Emailbag at Orange Lounge Radio dot com and we read some of our favorites here on the

2033
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:46,520
air.

2034
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,840
DarkSakura, what's in the emailbag this week?

2035
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:49,840
Some crap.

2036
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:50,840
Delete.

2037
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:54,600
Um, sorry, that was just some spam.

2038
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:59,960
Uh, we have, uh, a few quickies through the website, um, so some of them are not letting

2039
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:00,960
us know who they are.

2040
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:02,440
This one's from NerdE1.

2041
01:49:02,440 --> 01:49:09,320
Um, though Sky might appreciate checking out a web show called the- oh, it's- he's asking

2042
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:11,560
about if you watch the Guild.

2043
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:13,640
I've talked about it on this show before.

2044
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:14,640
Yeah, I've seen the Guild.

2045
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:15,640
The Guild is cute.

2046
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:16,640
It's cute.

2047
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:17,640
It is cute.

2048
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:20,640
I- I don't see why they don't have, like, a real TV show like the Guild.

2049
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:26,120
It got a little weird in parts, but, um, it's- it's good enough.

2050
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:27,120
It's funny.

2051
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:32,400
We guys also got a message from a guy, it looks like he's going by Epic Ness.

2052
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:36,640
I wonder if our covers of old NES tunes might be interesting for your radio station.

2053
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:40,480
We remake the music from old games and make them into rock medleys.

2054
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:44,360
We have gotten quite good feedback so far, please visit our MySpace and tell me what

2055
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:45,360
you think about it.

2056
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:46,360
I'll go ahead and plug it.

2057
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:47,360
MySpace?

2058
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:48,880
MySpace dot com slash- I know, who's MySpace?

2059
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:52,560
First off- Epic Ness Band, NES.

2060
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:55,680
I actually listened to some of it, it wasn't that bad.

2061
01:49:55,680 --> 01:50:01,320
Usually when we get those spam emails, I'm kinda like, ugh, but, um, that was- you can

2062
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:05,120
tell the guy at least copy pasted from some form and knew what he was doing.

2063
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:08,480
And I listened to it and it wasn't bad, so, uh, plug away.

2064
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:10,600
And this last one is Shook.

2065
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:12,120
Hi, OLR.

2066
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:13,120
Hi.

2067
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:16,000
Sorry I haven't sent an email in a while because my internet's not working.

2068
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,080
Anyway, I was listening to an episode from a few weeks ago and noticed you guys talking

2069
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:21,320
about your youngest listener.

2070
01:50:21,320 --> 01:50:25,880
I don't know if there's anyone else my age that listens, but I'm 13, I've been listening

2071
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:26,880
since I was 12.

2072
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:27,880
Oh my god.

2073
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:28,880
On to the email.

2074
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:33,640
Is it just me or does it seem like last year's E3 seemed more exciting than this one?

2075
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:36,640
I don't feel excited at all even though I know I should be.

2076
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:37,640
Yours truly, Shook.

2077
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:40,120
By the way, very excellent grammar.

2078
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:41,120
I know.

2079
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:42,120
Except for a few missing commas.

2080
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:46,920
I think this year the only difference between last year and this year would be that this

2081
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:48,880
year we don't really know what's coming.

2082
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:53,400
I mean, we have an idea with some of the stuff that they've talked about already, but I think

2083
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:57,400
that this year they're keeping a lot of it kinda tight to the chest so that, you know,

2084
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:00,760
there's gonna be a lot more surprises, whereas last year's kinda like, yeah, we kinda know

2085
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:04,600
what you're gonna talk about and, you know, there's some things, but, I don't know, personally,

2086
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:09,600
I'm okay with not going to E3 this year because last year was just kinda, eh, this isn't what

2087
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:10,720
it used to be.

2088
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:12,000
I disagree.

2089
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:18,320
I think our emailer couldn't be more wronger, to use a term that our soccer will appreciate.

2090
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:22,920
I think that between actually getting to do some hands-on with Natal to see what it's

2091
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:28,120
really like besides just a concept, getting to get hands-on with Move, Final Fantasy XIV,

2092
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:33,000
Rock Band 3, Portal 2, I think there's a lot of big releases this year that are kind of

2093
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,920
exciting, whereas last year there wasn't, I mean, one of the bigger things there was

2094
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:40,800
Halo 3 ODST, which wasn't a game I was really that excited about.

2095
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:46,020
Also, one thing I haven't played is the Halo Reach beta, really at all, which I guess came

2096
01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:47,560
out this week.

2097
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:55,080
I kinda don't play Halo anymore, thanks to Halo 3 wasn't that great, so, alright, so,

2098
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:58,480
oh, thank you for that, Dark Soccer, I appreciate that.

2099
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:00,720
Dark Soccer's taking my picture over here while I'm trying to talk.

2100
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:03,480
I was poking your head with a 50 caliber bullet shell.

2101
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:04,480
Nice, thank you.

2102
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:08,600
No, I was gonna say, by the way, our youngest documented listener that I know of has actually

2103
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:09,600
just turned 3.

2104
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:12,960
He doesn't really pay attention to us, he just listens sometimes.

2105
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:16,560
BlackWolf in our chat room wants to point out, it's also still a month away, an E3 booth

2106
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:18,880
list come out about a week or two before.

2107
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:22,440
Who knows, Blizzard could be back this year, we don't know yet, of course Nintendo's got

2108
01:52:22,440 --> 01:52:29,080
the 3DS, I'm a little antsy about the 3DS, cause I don't know about how 3D's gonna go,

2109
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:32,680
but again, I'm not gonna knock it till I've tried it, I'm just a little nervous, that's

2110
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:33,680
all.

2111
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:36,400
Alright, so was that it for the emails?

2112
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:37,400
Um, no.

2113
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:38,400
No, alright.

2114
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:41,840
But I did put that picture up on the website.

2115
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:45,320
Grand, thank you.

2116
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:47,120
This is from Robabubba.

2117
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:52,040
I love the way Game Politics presents the story of Dave and Buster's new owners.

2118
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:53,680
There's a link there.

2119
01:52:53,680 --> 01:52:57,480
PS, one of them opened up in Roseville this week.

2120
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:59,800
Really, I drove by and I did not see it.

2121
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:00,800
But then I didn't drive that close.

2122
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:02,160
It's in the fountains, you gotta go, you know what?

2123
01:53:02,160 --> 01:53:03,160
I knew it was over there.

2124
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:04,520
It's in the fountains, over by, um.

2125
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:05,680
I know what you're talking about.

2126
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:06,680
Yeah, it's in the back.

2127
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:08,680
It's by like California Peach Kitchen and all that stuff in the back.

2128
01:53:08,680 --> 01:53:12,200
I was looking too, cause we were over at the Galleria this week and I was like, I wonder

2129
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:15,000
if it's over there, and I'm like, the fountains, where's this?

2130
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,160
Cause that's how long it's been since I've been over there, the fountains didn't exist

2131
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:19,640
when I went last.

2132
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:23,520
It's nice, it's a little bit too high class for me, but there's some nice stuff there.

2133
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:25,080
But uh, did you go to Dave and Buster's though?

2134
01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:28,400
No, not yet, maybe we'll have to plan that this week, we should plan an OLR night at

2135
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:29,400
Dave and Buster's.

2136
01:53:29,400 --> 01:53:30,400
We need to go there.

2137
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:31,400
Fun!

2138
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:32,400
That's awesome.

2139
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:33,400
Yay!

2140
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:38,160
Um, and, okay, so in the middle of the GP article it says, in a press release on its

2141
01:53:38,160 --> 01:53:43,160
site, Oak Hill called the deal, um, an investment in partnership with Dave and Buster's current

2142
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:44,160
management team.

2143
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:45,160
Joke.

2144
01:53:45,160 --> 01:53:48,240
They soon followed with an email, by the way, you're defired.

2145
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:49,240
All in lead.

2146
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:50,240
End joke.

2147
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:54,800
I believe this marks the beginning of a round of closing of some DMV sites because that's

2148
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:57,120
what the new company always does, isn't it?

2149
01:53:57,120 --> 01:54:02,300
It's an Arcadiapocalypse, the Arcadiapocalypse is nigh, Ra-ba-ba.

2150
01:54:02,300 --> 01:54:05,160
It's kind of funny because they just opened the one here and now they're already talking

2151
01:54:05,160 --> 01:54:07,080
about closing certain Dave and Buster's.

2152
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:11,520
I like that he signs his name now, Ra-ba-ba.

2153
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:12,520
That's how you say it.

2154
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:15,840
It is, if you think about it, it's surprising though that it is in such close proximity

2155
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:23,000
to, um, the Family Funds Center, you know, Golf Land, um, hopefully it makes them...

2156
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,160
And John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza is right around the corner.

2157
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:28,920
Well, their arcade's kind of crap, um, but I would say...

2158
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:30,680
They do have an afterburner climax.

2159
01:54:30,680 --> 01:54:32,840
Well, good for them, but I'm just saying...

2160
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:34,240
And an indoor rollercoaster.

2161
01:54:34,240 --> 01:54:35,880
They do?

2162
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:38,720
Yeah, it's for like little kids, but yeah.

2163
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:41,360
I thought that doesn't really count.

2164
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:46,240
Um, so, it's interesting to see, because, you know, Dave and Buster's has a pretty decent

2165
01:54:46,240 --> 01:54:48,800
arcade, granted there's a lot of ticket games.

2166
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:52,440
I'm glad though I'll be able to use my two power cards that I have from like five years

2167
01:54:52,440 --> 01:54:53,440
ago.

2168
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:57,360
Which is, uh, very exciting.

2169
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:59,080
Those things don't expire, do they?

2170
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:01,880
I don't think so, but you might have to get it transferred.

2171
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:02,880
Alright.

2172
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:03,880
Darsakha's...

2173
01:55:03,880 --> 01:55:06,920
Sorry, Darsakha's taking pictures over here, and she keeps pointing the camera at me, and

2174
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:07,920
I don't know why.

2175
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:10,360
Because I know you'll play along.

2176
01:55:10,360 --> 01:55:11,360
Alright.

2177
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:12,360
Uh, yeah, I...

2178
01:55:12,360 --> 01:55:13,360
I just...

2179
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:14,360
I can't be here than Loki.

2180
01:55:14,360 --> 01:55:18,000
I just, um, I'm putting up a picture of me poking Rob with the nose condom.

2181
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Thank you.

2182
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,500
The nose tampon, sorry.

2183
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:21,500
The nose pond.

2184
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:23,040
Uh, any other emails tonight?

2185
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:24,040
Or are we...

2186
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:25,040
No!

2187
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:26,040
We're done.

2188
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:29,640
We do have actually one last little email I do want to get to, and it's right here.

2189
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:32,800
So, Beavis and Butthead.

2190
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:36,400
I understand Mr. McVicker has made a little arrangement with you guys.

2191
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:38,120
Yeah, a little probation.

2192
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:45,320
You see, class, Beavis and Butthead here are not allowed to laugh for a whole week.

2193
01:55:45,320 --> 01:55:49,240
That's right, and if they do laugh, they'll be expelled, and they'll have to go to Hope

2194
01:55:49,240 --> 01:55:54,320
High School, where they'll get their asses kicked on a daily basis by all the other delinquents.

2195
01:55:54,320 --> 01:56:02,040
Well, I was real glad to hear that, because this is Sex Education Week.

2196
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:04,960
That's right, Sex Ed Week.

2197
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:07,900
We're gonna be talking about the penis.

2198
01:56:07,900 --> 01:56:10,440
We'll be talking about the vagina.

2199
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:12,520
Do you think that's funny, Butthead?

2200
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:16,200
Do you find it amusing that we'll be talking about the testicles?

2201
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:24,800
Yes, we're also gonna be talking about venereal disease, sexual intercourse, and we will definitely

2202
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:28,640
be spending a lot of time talking about masturbation!

2203
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:37,120
Well, now that that's out of the way, let's take roll.

2204
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:38,120
Butt kiss!

2205
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:39,120
Here.

2206
01:56:39,120 --> 01:56:40,120
Gaylord!

2207
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:41,120
Ivan!

2208
01:56:41,120 --> 01:56:49,440
Oh, we're so mature.

2209
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:53,600
I had to realize, especially after getting that email from the 13-year-old that listens

2210
01:56:53,600 --> 01:56:57,640
to the show, a lot of you didn't grow up with Beavis and Butthead, and that kind of makes

2211
01:56:57,640 --> 01:57:02,400
me sad for you, because Beavis and Butthead was pretty fucking amazing.

2212
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:05,320
Like it really was.

2213
01:57:05,320 --> 01:57:06,960
It really summed up a generation.

2214
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:07,960
It really did.

2215
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:12,600
Like if you want to know what life was like for us, just go watch an old episode of Beavis

2216
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:13,600
and Butthead.

2217
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:14,600
It's pretty summed up.

2218
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:18,800
Like back when MTV would actually play music videos and everything else.

2219
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:19,800
Good stuff.

2220
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:23,680
Alright, let's get into a little bit of angst, because you know, sometimes we get a little

2221
01:57:23,680 --> 01:57:26,220
angry here on Orange Lounge Radio, and we have to do this segment.

2222
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:28,560
It's just tradition for 366 weeks now.

2223
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:45,880
The FUs of the Week!

2224
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:49,960
Um, FU to the sudden fifth coughing that I have, and also for my finger for starting

2225
01:57:49,960 --> 01:57:54,680
to trigger again, even though I had it operated on last year.

2226
01:57:54,680 --> 01:58:01,800
FU to the people that drift in and out of lanes, especially people that try to hit me

2227
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:02,800
with their car.

2228
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:07,040
Also, those people that like to make, you know, left turns by kind of slightly going

2229
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:11,400
to the right portion of their lane or outside of their lane and then making a left turn.

2230
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:14,280
Same goes for people that make the right turns that way as well.

2231
01:58:14,280 --> 01:58:19,920
And to this old grandma that we saw today who decided that, you know, the cement in

2232
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:26,160
a parking space is okay to drive over, and it was hilarious to watch that as she figured

2233
01:58:26,160 --> 01:58:30,520
out, hey, my car's on the wrong side of the cement barrier.

2234
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:31,520
Hey!

2235
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:32,520
Oops.

2236
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:33,520
Is that it?

2237
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:34,520
That's it.

2238
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:35,520
Alright.

2239
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:45,800
Um, I wanted to say a quick FU to my teeth, because I went to a Mamma Mia sing-a-long

2240
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:48,480
this week, and don't judge me.

2241
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:50,040
It was a lot of fun.

2242
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:51,040
Shut up.

2243
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:52,040
It was great.

2244
01:58:52,040 --> 01:58:53,040
They did it all Rocky or Preacher Show style.

2245
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:55,720
But one of the things they did is that one of the songs is Honey Honey, and they actually

2246
01:58:55,720 --> 01:59:03,280
had Bitto Honey available as part of Honey Honey, and I actually ate the Bitto Honey

2247
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:08,820
during Honey Honey, and part of my tooth chipped off on the bit of honey, one of my back teeth.

2248
01:59:08,820 --> 01:59:12,360
But I had like tons of cavities when I was a kid, and I think like a lot of the fillings

2249
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:16,880
now that I'm like 30 are cracking out, and I think that's exactly what happened.

2250
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:19,760
I think the filling broke off and took the corner of my tooth with it.

2251
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:23,760
So I'm really hoping it doesn't start to hurt, because something else about me, I really

2252
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:24,760
hate going to the dentist.

2253
01:59:24,760 --> 01:59:28,000
Like, I really, really hate going to the dentist.

2254
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,240
You know it'll help though if it does start to hurt, Rocky.

2255
01:59:30,240 --> 01:59:31,240
Just a natural remedy.

2256
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:32,240
Chin!

2257
01:59:32,240 --> 01:59:36,480
Well, I'm just, you know, I can't let it, like if it starts to hurt, I'm gonna have

2258
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:37,480
to do something about it.

2259
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:40,560
You can't let it go, because it will never like stop hurting.

2260
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:44,080
So um, yeah, FU to my teeth.

2261
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:45,080
Boo.

2262
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:47,560
FU to fillings we got as kids too.

2263
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:49,560
I never had a filling as a kid.

2264
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:50,560
Well, lucky you.

2265
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:53,440
Then again, I didn't go to the dentist until I was an adult from the time I was in third

2266
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:54,440
grade.

2267
01:59:54,440 --> 01:59:55,440
Wow.

2268
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:56,440
Lucky you.

2269
01:59:56,440 --> 01:59:58,960
Alright, so that's it for the FUs of the Week.

2270
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:05,440
Let's get into some other stories, and then we'll get into the Skype line at 1-877-GAMO-LR.

2271
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:11,000
There's a new Bomani game that apparently came out back in February, and in Japan of

2272
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,760
course, because it's not over here.

2273
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:16,080
And unfortunately, didn't really know much about it.

2274
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:20,500
But it's a new game called Utachi, and it looks like popping music, but kind of like

2275
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:25,000
almost like a light version of popping music with only three buttons, because you use the,

2276
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:32,560
you play it in kind of like the book, book fashion, and you tap the touch screen.

2277
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:36,480
There's three different spots you tap or hold your stylus on.

2278
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:38,240
And it's kind of cool.

2279
02:00:38,240 --> 02:00:45,280
Apparently it says the game requires you to perform a certain action when the notes reach

2280
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:50,400
the bottom of the screen, you tap the buttons for red notes, tap and hold them for blue,

2281
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:54,960
and tap and tap and quickly slide for yellow.

2282
02:00:54,960 --> 02:01:01,080
The green notes sound a bit tricky, you have to tap once and hit its, tap once it hits

2283
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:06,120
the bottom, and then slide the stylus up and down until the note ends.

2284
02:01:06,120 --> 02:01:10,080
So it's like a new rhythm music game, and the characters definitely look like they're

2285
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:12,300
from popping music.

2286
02:01:12,300 --> 02:01:14,880
It's no beat and groovy though.

2287
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:21,120
Yeah, it looks like it'll be better than beat and groovy, but I don't know.

2288
02:01:21,120 --> 02:01:24,120
And I'm just not excited about these games anymore.

2289
02:01:24,120 --> 02:01:25,920
Oh, I agree.

2290
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:28,320
You know what's sad though?

2291
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:34,580
I think I showed you there was like a homebrew DS game that really kind of gave me an idea

2292
02:01:34,580 --> 02:01:39,000
of how they could do like a DDR type of game on the DS, and it was pretty awesome.

2293
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:46,240
It involved like kind of making gestures with the stylus, and just really cool the way it

2294
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:47,520
kind of worked.

2295
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:52,600
But it was with like a Para Para type of video or something that they did it with.

2296
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:57,040
Still would be really cool though, to implement.

2297
02:01:57,040 --> 02:02:02,000
All right, well, one more story for you guys tonight, and I don't think this guy will be

2298
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,040
making a Para Para game, but you never know.

2299
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:07,200
George Romero, you guys know who he is, right?

2300
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:11,840
He did zombie movies, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, all these awesome

2301
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:13,200
zombie movies.

2302
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:18,300
Actually, George Romero recently talked to the website Destructoid and said, I'd like

2303
02:02:18,300 --> 02:02:19,500
to do a game.

2304
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:23,920
I'd like to work with a gamer on it, but everyone who has ever approached me, it's always been

2305
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:25,720
sell us your name and go home.

2306
02:02:25,720 --> 02:02:28,360
I don't particularly want to do that.

2307
02:02:28,360 --> 02:02:32,360
So yeah, and then of course there's the whole dead rising thing, which was definitely influenced.

2308
02:02:32,360 --> 02:02:35,600
I think one of the companies he said he wanted to work with was Capcom, like, they already

2309
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:37,720
did it.

2310
02:02:37,720 --> 02:02:41,600
So he actually said, he admitted, I'm not a gamer, so I don't know what excites a gamer.

2311
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:42,600
I don't know.

2312
02:02:42,600 --> 02:02:44,400
I think I could come up with a good story.

2313
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:45,400
Zombies!

2314
02:02:45,400 --> 02:02:46,400
People like zombies!

2315
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:48,400
That's right.

2316
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:53,280
I'm sure you're not very familiar with the zombie phenomenon, but I'm sure if you do

2317
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:57,220
your research there, George Romero, that you'll be fine.

2318
02:02:57,220 --> 02:03:00,560
As long as he makes the right arrangement with the right game company, it'll be fine.

2319
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:04,280
As long as he doesn't, you know, partner up with, you know, the wrong game company, it'll

2320
02:03:04,280 --> 02:03:05,280
be great.

2321
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:09,880
All right, so that's it for our scripted stories tonight.

2322
02:03:09,880 --> 02:03:14,720
Let's go to the phones at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is ORANGE LOUNGE

2323
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:15,720
RADIO.

2324
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:17,080
We're going to take your calls.

2325
02:03:17,080 --> 02:03:19,880
The last few weeks have been a little dry, so I don't know what's going on, but we'll

2326
02:03:19,880 --> 02:03:21,920
see if we actually get some phone calls tonight.

2327
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:27,360
In the meantime, let's see if there's anyone that has last minute stories.

2328
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:32,960
Yeah, the small stuff.

2329
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:36,560
They're doing another Xbox 360 bundle instead of the elites with two free games.

2330
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:40,380
They're also going to have an Xbox 360 arcade system with two free games.

2331
02:03:40,380 --> 02:03:45,520
Those free games, of course, are Banjo-Kazooie and Viva Pinata, the first Viva Pinata game.

2332
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:48,840
But hey, two free games is better than none.

2333
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:49,840
Free games are free.

2334
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:51,400
All right, let's go to the phones.

2335
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:52,400
We have a call.

2336
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:53,400
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2337
02:03:53,400 --> 02:03:54,400
Who's this?

2338
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:57,960
It's a one-and-only run, how's everybody doing tonight?

2339
02:03:57,960 --> 02:03:58,960
Not bad.

2340
02:03:58,960 --> 02:03:59,960
How are you?

2341
02:03:59,960 --> 02:04:00,960
I'm pretty good.

2342
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:04,760
I just came back from a job interview, but that's not the reason why I called.

2343
02:04:04,760 --> 02:04:05,760
Well, good luck with that.

2344
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:06,760
Hope it works out.

2345
02:04:06,760 --> 02:04:08,320
What is the reason you called tonight?

2346
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:14,760
Well, before I get into it, to reiterate what was said in the chat room earlier, I'm surprised

2347
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:21,960
you wouldn't go around Zombie Killing to the theme of the Golden Girls extended remix.

2348
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:26,380
You know, I have to think, if push came to shove, the thing is about the Golden Girls,

2349
02:04:26,380 --> 02:04:30,240
there was really only that one song, and that's not enough to really fill up a whole CD.

2350
02:04:30,240 --> 02:04:33,400
But maybe if we could somehow get that song on the soundtrack to Lost Highway, then we'd

2351
02:04:33,400 --> 02:04:35,080
be good.

2352
02:04:35,080 --> 02:04:38,520
Or maybe audio clips from the show?

2353
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:40,600
I don't know if I'd want to hear that.

2354
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:42,720
Does that make sense?

2355
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:45,160
You know we're just busting your balls because we love you, right?

2356
02:04:45,160 --> 02:04:46,240
No, I know, I know.

2357
02:04:46,240 --> 02:04:48,240
You guys are weird.

2358
02:04:48,240 --> 02:04:50,720
All right, no.

2359
02:04:50,720 --> 02:04:56,240
You know, I guess I could always fill up the CD with other types of versions of the Golden

2360
02:04:56,240 --> 02:05:02,280
Girls theme song, like that 8-bit version we had earlier, but you know.

2361
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:03,480
That'll work.

2362
02:05:03,480 --> 02:05:07,200
Or the one that was on the Betty White thing last night.

2363
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:08,200
Good times.

2364
02:05:08,200 --> 02:05:11,600
All right, so what's the real reason you called in tonight?

2365
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:16,320
I actually sat down and watched the Mega Man fan film on Friday night.

2366
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:19,920
Not, yeah, Friday night.

2367
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:20,920
I liked it.

2368
02:05:20,920 --> 02:05:26,600
I was expecting something really half-assed rushed project, but it turned out to be much

2369
02:05:26,600 --> 02:05:28,380
better than I thought it would be.

2370
02:05:28,380 --> 02:05:35,440
Without spoiling it too bad, what in a nutshell happens in this movie?

2371
02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:42,000
It's sort of like a retelling of the first game with Elements of the Third.

2372
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,240
Interesting.

2373
02:05:43,240 --> 02:05:46,440
Elements of the Third, meaning like rushes in it?

2374
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:47,440
No.

2375
02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:52,400
I guess you could say Rock's big brother.

2376
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:53,400
Okay.

2377
02:05:53,400 --> 02:05:54,960
Okay, I gotcha.

2378
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:55,960
Interesting.

2379
02:05:55,960 --> 02:05:59,480
I'm surprised Capcom isn't trying to shut this shit down.

2380
02:05:59,480 --> 02:06:04,360
Did Capcom kind of endorse this, or are they just hoping?

2381
02:06:04,360 --> 02:06:08,000
I actually have no idea, but I don't think they would shut it down, because I don't know

2382
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:13,360
if you remember a few years back at, I think it was Dragon Con or some convention in the

2383
02:06:13,360 --> 02:06:14,360
South.

2384
02:06:14,360 --> 02:06:19,280
It might have been SEC, I don't know, but reps from Capcom was there to watch a, I think

2385
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:23,280
it was a Devil May Cry fan film or something like that.

2386
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:26,080
Oh, so this has kind of been done before.

2387
02:06:26,080 --> 02:06:29,480
And I guess the other movies talked about tonight, you know, Street Fighter movie, Capcom

2388
02:06:29,480 --> 02:06:35,880
is apparently just these grounds for making fan movies.

2389
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:36,880
I saw Legacy.

2390
02:06:36,880 --> 02:06:41,320
I thought that was great, but I didn't see the other one though.

2391
02:06:41,320 --> 02:06:44,480
Well I guess maybe I'll have to check out the movie too.

2392
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:45,480
I don't know.

2393
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:49,680
I'm not a big fan of that particular website that made it, but I guess I can try and just

2394
02:06:49,680 --> 02:06:50,680
sit down and watch it.

2395
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:51,680
They didn't make it.

2396
02:06:51,680 --> 02:06:52,680
They're hosting it.

2397
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:53,680
Oh, okay.

2398
02:06:53,680 --> 02:06:54,680
Yeah, they're hosting it.

2399
02:06:54,680 --> 02:06:55,920
Well then that's different.

2400
02:06:55,920 --> 02:07:00,960
And their official soundtrack to the fan film is also available.

2401
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:04,360
Is the soundtrack not clips from the game, or is it arranged stuff from the game, or

2402
02:07:04,360 --> 02:07:06,560
is it all original stuff?

2403
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:07,560
All original.

2404
02:07:07,560 --> 02:07:12,800
I guess one guy did original recordings for the whole movie, but there's a couple of tracks

2405
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:18,640
he did do remixes of, but it's more, but it's like dark themed.

2406
02:07:18,640 --> 02:07:23,000
Sort of like, it kind of reminds me of the music from Lord of the Rings in a way.

2407
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Interesting.

2408
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,000
Like Enya?

2409
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Something like that.

2410
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,920
The fan film itself isn't like comedy chop-socky.

2411
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:34,840
It's more like drama, it's more of a drama darkish theme.

2412
02:07:34,840 --> 02:07:40,560
Plus the fact that Desient, Wily, and Light are much younger than they're supposed to

2413
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:42,040
be.

2414
02:07:42,040 --> 02:07:47,240
Tigerclaw in chat says, Capcom did endorse the Street Fighter legacy, chat.orangelandtrader.com.

2415
02:07:47,240 --> 02:07:48,240
So yeah.

2416
02:07:48,240 --> 02:07:49,480
See, that I didn't know about.

2417
02:07:49,480 --> 02:07:51,600
Capcom's pretty good with their fan base, though.

2418
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:57,480
They got a blog that reaches out to fans, and they try not to be jerks about stuff.

2419
02:07:57,480 --> 02:08:00,960
But at the same time, when Nintendo pulled that Zelda film, I didn't really think they

2420
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:01,960
were being jerks.

2421
02:08:01,960 --> 02:08:04,180
I mean, they have a right to protect their IP.

2422
02:08:04,180 --> 02:08:07,680
So if Capcom wanted to be jerks, they have a right.

2423
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:08,680
You know what?

2424
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:14,360
If Nintendo's going to pull that fan film, at least let us know about the supposed Metroid

2425
02:08:14,360 --> 02:08:15,720
film that's supposed to be coming out.

2426
02:08:15,720 --> 02:08:17,360
We've been hearing about it for the last two, three years.

2427
02:08:17,360 --> 02:08:18,360
Oh yeah.

2428
02:08:18,360 --> 02:08:19,360
Good luck with that.

2429
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:20,360
No, ain't happening.

2430
02:08:20,360 --> 02:08:21,360
Ain't happening.

2431
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:22,360
Yeah, I know.

2432
02:08:22,360 --> 02:08:25,600
Which is too bad, because if it did happen, maybe they'd sell more copies of the game.

2433
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:26,600
Mm-hmm.

2434
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:27,600
Alright.

2435
02:08:27,600 --> 02:08:31,720
And SJ100Matt wants to point out that the Megas did the closing music.

2436
02:08:31,720 --> 02:08:35,320
So there is at least still some other Mega Man community tie-ins, so.

2437
02:08:35,320 --> 02:08:36,320
Oh yeah, definitely.

2438
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:38,040
Alright, well, Rama, we're going to let you go.

2439
02:08:38,040 --> 02:08:41,320
Do you have any other final thoughts before we let you go?

2440
02:08:41,320 --> 02:08:43,780
If you like Street Fighter stuff, check out Street Fighter High.

2441
02:08:43,780 --> 02:08:44,780
That's all I gotta say.

2442
02:08:44,780 --> 02:08:45,780
Alright, will do.

2443
02:08:45,780 --> 02:08:47,680
Dan was watching that the other day.

2444
02:08:47,680 --> 02:08:48,680
It's amusing.

2445
02:08:48,680 --> 02:08:49,680
Yes, it is.

2446
02:08:49,680 --> 02:08:51,200
Alright, we'll see you soon, Rama.

2447
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:53,080
You still coming out here, like in July?

2448
02:08:53,080 --> 02:08:56,760
Um, we gotta talk about that, yeah.

2449
02:08:56,760 --> 02:08:57,760
Mm, okay.

2450
02:08:57,760 --> 02:08:58,760
Sounds good.

2451
02:08:58,760 --> 02:08:59,760
Alright, alright.

2452
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:00,760
Take care.

2453
02:09:00,760 --> 02:09:01,760
Mm-hmm.

2454
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:02,760
Alright.

2455
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:07,400
877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2456
02:09:07,400 --> 02:09:11,320
While we wait for other calls, do we have any other last minute stories that came up?

2457
02:09:11,320 --> 02:09:13,080
Not particularly, I don't think.

2458
02:09:13,080 --> 02:09:15,240
Bejeweled 2 coming in the WiiWare.

2459
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:16,240
Woo!

2460
02:09:16,240 --> 02:09:17,240
Yay for that.

2461
02:09:17,240 --> 02:09:18,240
Alright, we got another call.

2462
02:09:18,240 --> 02:09:19,240
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

2463
02:09:19,240 --> 02:09:20,240
Who's this?

2464
02:09:20,240 --> 02:09:23,440
Uh, one and only Legend of Zaku.

2465
02:09:23,440 --> 02:09:24,440
Legend of Zaku.

2466
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:25,440
What's up?

2467
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:26,440
What's on your mind?

2468
02:09:26,440 --> 02:09:27,440
Uh, nothing much.

2469
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:30,120
Just recovering from, like, Mother's Day gorging of food.

2470
02:09:30,120 --> 02:09:31,120
I see.

2471
02:09:31,120 --> 02:09:34,000
Well, at least it's not a Mother's Day hangover, because, you know, I've definitely had those

2472
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:35,800
types of Mother's Days, too.

2473
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:38,920
Uh, so, uh, what, uh, what's on your mind?

2474
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:40,800
To what do we owe the phone call?

2475
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:47,240
Um, I guess the way I've been seeing it right now, is it just me or is Activision trying

2476
02:09:47,240 --> 02:09:51,640
to defend, just, just in general, ass rape?

2477
02:09:51,640 --> 02:09:56,040
In other words, when they try to sell the stimulus pack for Modern Warfare 2, their

2478
02:09:56,040 --> 02:09:59,600
exec has the gall to say it's the best deal.

2479
02:09:59,600 --> 02:10:04,400
It's the best value for your, for the amount you're paying.

2480
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:08,640
Which we all know, and let's be honest here, it's a crock of shit.

2481
02:10:08,640 --> 02:10:12,920
I think Activision, in general, is kinda having to band-aid a lot lately, like, you know,

2482
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:16,840
we had the news about the silver lining this week, you know, and certainly they've been

2483
02:10:16,840 --> 02:10:19,880
getting a lot of bad news back to back to back.

2484
02:10:19,880 --> 02:10:22,440
But then, you know, of course they also had some good news with the whole Bungie deal

2485
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:26,040
for the next, you know, ten years, the publishing of that, whatever series that is, it'll probably

2486
02:10:26,040 --> 02:10:30,120
be at E3, which by the way, going back to the earlier email, another reason that E3

2487
02:10:30,120 --> 02:10:34,080
is going to be interesting this year, um, you know, I think they definitely have some,

2488
02:10:34,080 --> 02:10:37,800
some damage control to be doing, so of course you're going to see comments like that.

2489
02:10:37,800 --> 02:10:43,200
The problem with, you know, like, the way I see it is that, you know, they have to,

2490
02:10:43,200 --> 02:10:47,240
they can't just do what they did to Infinity Ward with Bungie, but then again,

2491
02:10:47,240 --> 02:10:49,760
Hold, hold, hold, I'm going to stop you right there.

2492
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:50,760
They don't own Bungie.

2493
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:56,840
It's a big difference, but you'd be surprised at how, you know, the actual details of the

2494
02:10:56,840 --> 02:11:04,400
deal itself, like, you know, the, you know, the details that are pretty much confidential.

2495
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:10,680
I mean, in other words, what I'm trying to say is that the point is that perhaps Activision

2496
02:11:10,680 --> 02:11:17,120
is going to be inclined to pull their strings as much as possible, not to actually own them,

2497
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:23,320
not to make their life that miserable, in terms of just, like, being demanding and overworking

2498
02:11:23,320 --> 02:11:26,400
them if they were signed up for that type of deal.

2499
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:30,480
I have a feeling this agreement is probably going to favor Bungie a little more, because

2500
02:11:30,480 --> 02:11:32,480
Activision is not directly paying for it.

2501
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:37,280
As long as they actually negotiated with, you know, as long as Bungie managed to negotiate

2502
02:11:37,280 --> 02:11:41,800
that contract, you know, with terms that they would agree with.

2503
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:46,120
I'm sure, you know what, I'm sure Bungie got the better end of the deal, because once the

2504
02:11:46,120 --> 02:11:50,400
Microsoft news came down, I'm sure everybody was banging down Bungie's door, and I will,

2505
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:55,400
I would bet money, I would bet actual money EA was in talks with them, too.

2506
02:11:55,400 --> 02:11:56,400
I would bet money.

2507
02:11:56,400 --> 02:12:00,320
I'm pretty sure they were, but I'm just, you know, as I'm saying, I just want to be sure

2508
02:12:00,320 --> 02:12:05,760
that we just have to keep in mind that as long as Bungie doesn't get screwed over by

2509
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:11,080
Activision in terms of, like, you know, in terms of actually having to deliver on very

2510
02:12:11,080 --> 02:12:17,000
tight deadlines, the way Infinity Ward was, was put, you know, that much undue pressure.

2511
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:20,160
Remember though, Zach O'Bungee has survived a divorce with Microsoft.

2512
02:12:20,160 --> 02:12:21,160
That's pretty big.

2513
02:12:21,160 --> 02:12:25,080
I understand that, but there's this activation we're talking about.

2514
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:26,080
Yeah, well, I'm-

2515
02:12:26,080 --> 02:12:30,520
These guys have, you know, these guys have publicly stated that they, that they're helping

2516
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:34,560
on just, like, maximizing profit.

2517
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:38,320
Let me, let me take this kind of a different direction a little bit here, because, you

2518
02:12:38,320 --> 02:12:41,400
know, we could kind of, you know, talk about this without really knowing the details of

2519
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:46,400
it for a very long time, but come E3, hold on, come E3, we're actually going to see what

2520
02:12:46,400 --> 02:12:49,560
this game is, and, you know, what the big mystery project is.

2521
02:12:49,560 --> 02:12:52,800
At least that's the assumption, and, and, God, I hope it is the case.

2522
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:54,720
We'll actually get to see what this mystery game is.

2523
02:12:54,720 --> 02:12:56,160
The curtain will be revealed.

2524
02:12:56,160 --> 02:13:00,280
Do you think people are going to remember all this once the game can speak for itself

2525
02:13:00,280 --> 02:13:01,880
as opposed to being just an idea?

2526
02:13:01,880 --> 02:13:02,880
Right.

2527
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:08,400
I mean, in the end, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter that Activision and Bungie

2528
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:12,000
are, are basically, you know, are in a 10-year deal.

2529
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:15,800
The important thing is that the game will be the face of everything.

2530
02:13:15,800 --> 02:13:21,200
It'll be the face, and that will be the front, the things that, you know, that your average

2531
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:26,140
Joe gamer will see, you know, when, when talking about that particular game.

2532
02:13:26,140 --> 02:13:29,560
He would see whatever character is tied to that game and nothing else.

2533
02:13:29,560 --> 02:13:34,480
I bet most people don't really follow this stuff either.

2534
02:13:34,480 --> 02:13:38,740
Like how many people go, oh, I've got to go see this movie because 20th Century Fox is

2535
02:13:38,740 --> 02:13:39,740
doing it.

2536
02:13:39,740 --> 02:13:43,120
And like, you know, 20th Century Fox, I just love that little theme they play before all

2537
02:13:43,120 --> 02:13:44,120
the movies.

2538
02:13:44,120 --> 02:13:45,120
Right.

2539
02:13:45,120 --> 02:13:48,560
You know, most people don't really give a hoot at the end of the day.

2540
02:13:48,560 --> 02:13:49,560
Exactly.

2541
02:13:49,560 --> 02:13:50,560
So.

2542
02:13:50,560 --> 02:13:51,560
Exactly.

2543
02:13:51,560 --> 02:13:56,000
This is where the franchises sell themselves to the point where the people made them, you

2544
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:57,000
know, it doesn't matter.

2545
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:58,000
It's irrelevant to them.

2546
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,120
It's the same thing with Call of Duty right now.

2547
02:14:00,120 --> 02:14:01,120
But I should say this.

2548
02:14:01,120 --> 02:14:05,320
They don't care that Treyarch or Infinity Ward made it, it's just another Call of Duty

2549
02:14:05,320 --> 02:14:08,000
game to appease Joe gamer.

2550
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:09,120
I should say this though.

2551
02:14:09,120 --> 02:14:15,000
There are definitely people that will follow, if I'm going to continue this analogy, follow

2552
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:16,640
their favorite directors.

2553
02:14:16,640 --> 02:14:20,320
Like you know, oh, Kevin Smith has a new film out there, I've got to go see that.

2554
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:21,320
Those are niches.

2555
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:22,320
You have to realize.

2556
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:29,240
You have one aspect of really, you know, devoted fan base for that one particular person, but

2557
02:14:29,240 --> 02:14:34,800
then you have another one that's just so passive that takes, you know, every, it doesn't really

2558
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:36,860
take that into account.

2559
02:14:36,860 --> 02:14:40,280
So it's just, to them it's just another movie that they're seeing.

2560
02:14:40,280 --> 02:14:45,080
And in this case, it's just another first person shooter that this, you know, average

2561
02:14:45,080 --> 02:14:46,480
Joe gamer is playing.

2562
02:14:46,480 --> 02:14:47,480
Alright.

2563
02:14:47,480 --> 02:14:50,680
Well, Zaku, we've got to wrap up so we can get some more calls, but thank you so much

2564
02:14:50,680 --> 02:14:55,760
for your call and I'm sure we'll check in with you again after E3 when the curtain is

2565
02:14:55,760 --> 02:14:56,760
revealed.

2566
02:14:56,760 --> 02:14:57,760
Right.

2567
02:14:57,760 --> 02:14:58,760
Alright.

2568
02:14:58,760 --> 02:14:59,760
Take care, Zaku.

2569
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:01,760
Alright, have a good one.

2570
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:06,560
877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.

2571
02:15:06,560 --> 02:15:10,280
I did see some other calls coming through, so it looks like our audience wants to chat

2572
02:15:10,280 --> 02:15:11,280
tonight.

2573
02:15:11,280 --> 02:15:12,280
That's good.

2574
02:15:12,280 --> 02:15:13,800
Good change in the past couple weeks.

2575
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:15,800
Loki, any other last minute stories?

2576
02:15:15,800 --> 02:15:19,800
I don't know if I cut you off on what you were doing there.

2577
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:28,760
Just a few things, um, apparently Square Enix is trying to prohibit people from making pictures

2578
02:15:28,760 --> 02:15:32,640
and videos of their games, I guess, before they come out or something, I don't really

2579
02:15:32,640 --> 02:15:33,640
know.

2580
02:15:33,640 --> 02:15:34,640
I didn't realize that was a big problem.

2581
02:15:34,640 --> 02:15:39,160
But I know they've been really kind of anal about people taking pictures and stuff during

2582
02:15:39,160 --> 02:15:40,160
like E3.

2583
02:15:40,160 --> 02:15:41,600
Oh yeah, they do that all the time.

2584
02:15:41,600 --> 02:15:43,640
Let's get, the phone's ringing off the hook, I gotta get one of these calls.

2585
02:15:43,640 --> 02:15:45,040
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

2586
02:15:45,040 --> 02:15:46,400
Hey, this is X-Link.

2587
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:47,400
Hello, X-Link.

2588
02:15:47,400 --> 02:15:48,400
What's on your mind, buddy?

2589
02:15:48,400 --> 02:15:54,960
Hey, I was reading over some news and I was glad to see that Sega had detailed the DRM

2590
02:15:54,960 --> 02:15:59,480
for Alpha Protocol and that I don't have to have an internet connection 24-7 in order

2591
02:15:59,480 --> 02:16:00,960
to play it when I do play it.

2592
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:03,720
Well that's because it's Sega, not Ubisoft, but that's good.

2593
02:16:03,720 --> 02:16:07,560
Thank God, thank somebody for being DRM-friendly about it, so.

2594
02:16:07,560 --> 02:16:10,760
And then the fact that after about two years after the game comes out that they're gonna

2595
02:16:10,760 --> 02:16:15,760
put a patch where it's, you know, there'll be no other requirements, so.

2596
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:22,440
But it's good to know that somebody's at least looking at the consumer and saying, we don't

2597
02:16:22,440 --> 02:16:25,880
want to go down these same footsteps as some of these other companies have been.

2598
02:16:25,880 --> 02:16:31,400
So it's good to see that somebody's at least trying to appease the PC customer.

2599
02:16:31,400 --> 02:16:32,400
Hmm.

2600
02:16:32,400 --> 02:16:33,400
Well that's good.

2601
02:16:33,400 --> 02:16:38,000
And I don't usually think of Sega as a big PC publisher, but I guess, you know, they

2602
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,680
certainly have some of their stuff there, so.

2603
02:16:40,680 --> 02:16:41,680
That's pretty cool.

2604
02:16:41,680 --> 02:16:46,480
But even so, I'm glad somebody's taking the right steps towards it, so.

2605
02:16:46,480 --> 02:16:49,600
What else is on your mind this week, buddy?

2606
02:16:49,600 --> 02:16:50,600
Nothing much.

2607
02:16:50,600 --> 02:16:54,640
Just, I was working on my finals and stuff and of course playing WoW just like you, so.

2608
02:16:54,640 --> 02:16:55,640
How is Warcraft going?

2609
02:16:55,640 --> 02:16:57,960
Have you been reading the Cataclysm spoilers at all?

2610
02:16:57,960 --> 02:16:59,760
No, I have not, actually.

2611
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:01,580
Well, it's kind of hard not to.

2612
02:17:01,580 --> 02:17:02,580
I take that back.

2613
02:17:02,580 --> 02:17:06,640
It's kind of hard not to read anything with it, but at the same time, too, I try not to

2614
02:17:06,640 --> 02:17:11,640
read too much because I like the whole aspect of surprise and see what's gonna happen.

2615
02:17:11,640 --> 02:17:15,440
And, it's like I was telling other people in the guild and stuff, I'm looking forward

2616
02:17:15,440 --> 02:17:20,900
to seeing how these events actually unfold and how the event's gonna play out.

2617
02:17:20,900 --> 02:17:24,680
And hopefully they might have some kind of timely, worldly events where this all is gonna

2618
02:17:24,680 --> 02:17:27,560
come and unfold at one step at a time.

2619
02:17:27,560 --> 02:17:28,960
So it'd be kind of neat to see how it happens, so.

2620
02:17:28,960 --> 02:17:33,040
Yeah, they did some fun events when Lich King came out, so I'm sure they'll do some fun

2621
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:34,040
stuff here, too.

2622
02:17:34,040 --> 02:17:35,040
So that'll be cool.

2623
02:17:35,040 --> 02:17:36,040
But.

2624
02:17:36,040 --> 02:17:37,040
Yes.

2625
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:38,040
Oh, gosh.

2626
02:17:38,040 --> 02:17:39,040
There's something else I was gonna ask you.

2627
02:17:39,040 --> 02:17:41,760
You're trying to still do your Loremaster achievement, right?

2628
02:17:41,760 --> 02:17:43,000
You may not have a lot of time left.

2629
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Correct.

2630
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,000
You gotta get cracking on that.

2631
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Correct.

2632
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Well, yes, definitely.

2633
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:48,280
And I will definitely be doing that.

2634
02:17:48,280 --> 02:17:51,560
I just, like, a lot of my schoolwork had come up, unfortunately, where it had stopped me

2635
02:17:51,560 --> 02:17:54,360
and slowed down my process, which, of course, you guys can tell.

2636
02:17:54,360 --> 02:17:57,880
But then again, I started speeding up again as well, so.

2637
02:17:57,880 --> 02:18:00,920
Yeah, you finally decided, hey, maybe I should actually go to the new content.

2638
02:18:00,920 --> 02:18:02,240
I'll level a lot faster.

2639
02:18:02,240 --> 02:18:05,380
And then when you hit 80, it makes the old content super easy because you can start running

2640
02:18:05,380 --> 02:18:06,380
Dungeons by yourself.

2641
02:18:06,380 --> 02:18:07,380
It's great.

2642
02:18:07,380 --> 02:18:08,380
Yeah, precisely.

2643
02:18:08,380 --> 02:18:12,480
And I have a few surprises in store this next coming week, too, for some of us, so.

2644
02:18:12,480 --> 02:18:15,240
But I will talk about that later, so.

2645
02:18:15,240 --> 02:18:16,280
Alright.

2646
02:18:16,280 --> 02:18:19,520
But I got kind of a few interesting things, which was kind of cool, so.

2647
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:20,520
Alright.

2648
02:18:20,520 --> 02:18:22,300
Well, we're gonna let you go, buddy, so we can get some more calls.

2649
02:18:22,300 --> 02:18:24,560
But I'll see you in a while, I'm sure.

2650
02:18:24,560 --> 02:18:25,560
No problem.

2651
02:18:25,560 --> 02:18:26,560
Thank you.

2652
02:18:26,560 --> 02:18:27,560
Huh?

2653
02:18:27,560 --> 02:18:28,560
Later.

2654
02:18:28,560 --> 02:18:29,560
Bye-bye.

2655
02:18:29,560 --> 02:18:30,560
877-GAMOLR, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

2656
02:18:30,560 --> 02:18:31,560
Why not?

2657
02:18:31,560 --> 02:18:32,560
We'll do a couple more calls.

2658
02:18:32,560 --> 02:18:36,160
Maybe at least one more call since, you know, we were really thin on calls the past couple

2659
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:37,160
of weeks.

2660
02:18:37,160 --> 02:18:38,440
I mean, our phone's been ringing tonight.

2661
02:18:38,440 --> 02:18:39,920
I guess folks have things to say.

2662
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:44,140
Which is strange because this was not quite as busy of a news week as weeks past.

2663
02:18:44,140 --> 02:18:47,880
And I expect the next few shows leading up to mid-June are going to be a little bit of

2664
02:18:47,880 --> 02:18:51,360
the same thing because, you know, most companies are gonna try and keep it in their pants until

2665
02:18:51,360 --> 02:18:52,400
E3.

2666
02:18:52,400 --> 02:18:59,400
But you'll have little tidbits here and there just like, you know, you've got going with

2667
02:18:59,400 --> 02:19:01,000
A Little Big Planet 2 and everything.

2668
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:02,000
But let's get you another call.

2669
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2670
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Who's this?

2671
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Do this, act deft.

2672
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Hey, act deft.

2673
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:07,000
What's on your mind?

2674
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:08,000
Not much.

2675
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:12,720
I just want to talk about the Humble Indie Bundle.

2676
02:19:12,720 --> 02:19:13,720
What is this?

2677
02:19:13,720 --> 02:19:14,720
What?

2678
02:19:14,720 --> 02:19:17,680
The Humble Indie Bundle.

2679
02:19:17,680 --> 02:19:21,240
What is Humble Indie Bundle?

2680
02:19:21,240 --> 02:19:27,400
It's actually a six game pack you can download just by donating anything you want.

2681
02:19:27,400 --> 02:19:28,400
Oh!

2682
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:29,400
Any amount of cash.

2683
02:19:29,400 --> 02:19:31,040
Didn't this come up on last week?

2684
02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:32,560
No, maybe I just read a story on it.

2685
02:19:32,560 --> 02:19:34,240
Or was it maybe a last minute story last week?

2686
02:19:34,240 --> 02:19:35,240
I don't remember.

2687
02:19:35,240 --> 02:19:36,820
I now know what you're talking about.

2688
02:19:36,820 --> 02:19:40,440
One of the games that's in there, is DeBlob one of them?

2689
02:19:40,440 --> 02:19:44,520
No, it's actually World of Goo.

2690
02:19:44,520 --> 02:19:45,520
World of Goo.

2691
02:19:45,520 --> 02:19:46,520
That's it.

2692
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:47,520
I didn't get them confused.

2693
02:19:47,520 --> 02:19:49,160
They're both blobby slime games.

2694
02:19:49,160 --> 02:19:51,160
Alright, so there it is.

2695
02:19:51,160 --> 02:19:52,160
Okay, yes.

2696
02:19:52,160 --> 02:19:55,120
I did read about this, but go ahead.

2697
02:19:55,120 --> 02:20:00,980
It's World of Goo, Aquaria, Gish, Lugaru, and HD, and Pranumbra, Overture.

2698
02:20:00,980 --> 02:20:07,760
And also, they added a six game that is Samorost 2.

2699
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:11,040
Did you actually pick this up and download it?

2700
02:20:11,040 --> 02:20:13,160
Yes, I actually did.

2701
02:20:13,160 --> 02:20:15,320
And what did you pay for it?

2702
02:20:15,320 --> 02:20:19,520
Even though Bobby may think I parried it, but no, I did pay for it.

2703
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:22,040
You get to name your own price for this, right?

2704
02:20:22,040 --> 02:20:28,840
Yeah, that's the cool thing about it, that you can put your own price on it.

2705
02:20:28,840 --> 02:20:40,920
You can put just a cent, but if you don't want to look that cheap, you can donate a

2706
02:20:40,920 --> 02:20:48,400
dollar or six dollars, five dollars, ten dollars, or even, there's a donation here on the site

2707
02:20:48,400 --> 02:20:58,040
that says $1,000, so if you have a lot of cash to spend or donate, you can donate whatever

2708
02:20:58,040 --> 02:20:59,040
you want.

2709
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:00,040
Very generous.

2710
02:21:00,040 --> 02:21:01,360
You know, Orange Launch Radio would happily take $1,000.

2711
02:21:01,360 --> 02:21:04,480
Actually, I won't drill you on how much you actually pay, but I do want to know, were

2712
02:21:04,480 --> 02:21:08,640
you able to pay in pesos, because you're from Mexico, or did you have to actually pay like

2713
02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:11,000
a conversion fee to translate to dollars?

2714
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:14,280
Well, yeah, it's a conversion fee.

2715
02:21:14,280 --> 02:21:21,400
You can pay via PayPal, imasan.com checkout, or Google checkout also, if you got an account

2716
02:21:21,400 --> 02:21:22,400
of those sites.

2717
02:21:22,400 --> 02:21:23,400
I gotcha.

2718
02:21:23,400 --> 02:21:27,720
And plus, you live relatively close to the border of the US, so I don't know, do you

2719
02:21:27,720 --> 02:21:32,000
maybe have some bank accounts that deal in dollars?

2720
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:37,120
I actually have international credit cards, so I just use them.

2721
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:40,840
Usually people in border towns, you know, no matter where you are, have some type of

2722
02:21:40,840 --> 02:21:45,440
paths to kind of go between, so, alright, well, very cool.

2723
02:21:45,440 --> 02:21:50,520
So which, I'll quickly ask you this, which game was your favorite out of the bunch?

2724
02:21:50,520 --> 02:21:56,360
Well, I haven't tried any of them, because I got it today, though I have played World

2725
02:21:56,360 --> 02:21:58,120
of Goo, and that's a pretty good game.

2726
02:21:58,120 --> 02:22:00,120
Alright, well then you're gonna have to call us back, let us know.

2727
02:22:00,120 --> 02:22:02,680
I would recommend downloading this just for that game.

2728
02:22:02,680 --> 02:22:06,360
So you're donating money just based on that game, and like everything else, it's just

2729
02:22:06,360 --> 02:22:07,360
a bonus?

2730
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:08,360
Probably.

2731
02:22:08,360 --> 02:22:09,360
That's fair enough.

2732
02:22:09,360 --> 02:22:10,360
Fair enough.

2733
02:22:10,360 --> 02:22:11,360
I can go with that.

2734
02:22:11,360 --> 02:22:13,640
Alright, well, Act Def, thank you for the heads up.

2735
02:22:13,640 --> 02:22:18,280
We always like cheap games, or expensive games, whatever you think they're worth.

2736
02:22:18,280 --> 02:22:22,520
I think I read somewhere the average amount that people were paying were like $10 for

2737
02:22:22,520 --> 02:22:28,560
all the games, so, you know, for six games, it's not a lot of money, but at the same time,

2738
02:22:28,560 --> 02:22:31,920
it's an average of everything, and I guess, you know, some people just simply can't afford

2739
02:22:31,920 --> 02:22:32,920
more.

2740
02:22:32,920 --> 02:22:36,240
So, hopefully people are paying what they really truly believe it's worth.

2741
02:22:36,240 --> 02:22:42,960
Yeah, the average contribution here is $8.36, though they have raised over $600,000.

2742
02:22:42,960 --> 02:22:48,080
Well, I guess in the end, that's what really counts, is the amount they've raised as a

2743
02:22:48,080 --> 02:22:49,080
whole.

2744
02:22:49,080 --> 02:22:53,880
Alright, well, Act Def, we're going to let you go, but thank you so much for your call.

2745
02:22:53,880 --> 02:22:54,880
Thank you.

2746
02:22:54,880 --> 02:22:55,880
Have fun with the games.

2747
02:22:55,880 --> 02:22:57,400
Alright, I like that heads up.

2748
02:22:57,400 --> 02:23:02,000
See, I like that, because it was a good heads up, and it was like a sale on games, although

2749
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,520
I don't know if you really call that a sale or what.

2750
02:23:04,520 --> 02:23:06,480
There's been other games that have kind of done that lately.

2751
02:23:06,480 --> 02:23:11,240
877 Game O-L-R, username on Skype is OrangeLaungeo, we've got time to do at least one more call.

2752
02:23:11,240 --> 02:23:14,560
There's been a lot of kind of game things that have been doing this lately, like that

2753
02:23:14,560 --> 02:23:19,940
game, Alan and I were playing on Steam one day, and it's like you draw these crayon lines

2754
02:23:19,940 --> 02:23:24,520
with the mouse, and I can't remember the name of it, but that had a sale for a little while.

2755
02:23:24,520 --> 02:23:25,520
Crayon Physics?

2756
02:23:25,520 --> 02:23:26,520
Was that at Crayon Physics?

2757
02:23:26,520 --> 02:23:27,760
Yeah, I think it was.

2758
02:23:27,760 --> 02:23:31,640
You could pay whatever you want for that game, and there's been a few games that have done

2759
02:23:31,640 --> 02:23:32,640
that lately.

2760
02:23:32,640 --> 02:23:34,760
Didn't World of Goo just alone do that for a little while?

2761
02:23:34,760 --> 02:23:36,480
I think it did.

2762
02:23:36,480 --> 02:23:39,300
Could be wrong, though.

2763
02:23:39,300 --> 02:23:46,280
One day and 16 hours left, by the way, ActDeft is clarifying in chat, wolfire.com, W-O-L-F-I-R-E.com

2764
02:23:46,280 --> 02:23:47,280
slash humble.

2765
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:51,240
Let's get to at least one more call here on OrangeLaungeo tonight before we say goodnight.

2766
02:23:51,240 --> 02:23:52,240
Hi, you're on OrangeLaungeo.

2767
02:23:52,240 --> 02:23:54,240
Who's this?

2768
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:56,080
This is Amiga Triple Seven.

2769
02:23:56,080 --> 02:23:57,640
Amiga Triple Seven.

2770
02:23:57,640 --> 02:23:58,640
What's on your mind?

2771
02:23:58,640 --> 02:24:06,720
Well, first off, I'd like to give a Happy Mother's Day shout out to Dark Sakura.

2772
02:24:06,720 --> 02:24:10,080
Well, you're a mother to Shermy.

2773
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:11,080
I am.

2774
02:24:11,080 --> 02:24:12,080
Yeah.

2775
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:13,080
Well, yeah.

2776
02:24:13,080 --> 02:24:14,080
I have my cat.

2777
02:24:14,080 --> 02:24:17,840
I don't have actual children, but thank you.

2778
02:24:17,840 --> 02:24:19,840
Yeah.

2779
02:24:19,840 --> 02:24:28,440
And anyway, I was wondering, have you all heard about Angry Birds?

2780
02:24:28,440 --> 02:24:29,800
Like actual Angry Birds?

2781
02:24:29,800 --> 02:24:30,800
Wait a minute.

2782
02:24:30,800 --> 02:24:31,800
Is this a movie?

2783
02:24:31,800 --> 02:24:32,800
No.

2784
02:24:32,800 --> 02:24:33,800
Okay, never mind.

2785
02:24:33,800 --> 02:24:35,200
Then I'm thinking of something else.

2786
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:36,200
No, I'm thinking of-

2787
02:24:36,200 --> 02:24:37,200
That's what you're thinking.

2788
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:38,200
I'm thinking of Birdemic or whatever.

2789
02:24:38,200 --> 02:24:39,200
Why?

2790
02:24:39,200 --> 02:24:40,200
What is-

2791
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:42,200
There's a new one with slugs now.

2792
02:24:42,200 --> 02:24:43,200
I'm thinking of something.

2793
02:24:43,200 --> 02:24:45,360
I'm thinking of like a sci-fi movie or something.

2794
02:24:45,360 --> 02:24:46,960
Sorry about that.

2795
02:24:46,960 --> 02:24:47,960
Like the birds.

2796
02:24:47,960 --> 02:24:49,960
You're probably like Alfred Hitchcock's supposed to know.

2797
02:24:49,960 --> 02:24:50,960
Yes.

2798
02:24:50,960 --> 02:24:51,960
That's what I'm thinking of.

2799
02:24:51,960 --> 02:24:52,960
Okay.

2800
02:24:52,960 --> 02:24:53,960
What is Angry Birds, sir?

2801
02:24:53,960 --> 02:25:02,240
Angry Birds is typically a game that no iPhone slash iPod touch user should be without today.

2802
02:25:02,240 --> 02:25:04,740
It's a game.

2803
02:25:04,740 --> 02:25:06,880
I gotta ask, is this your game?

2804
02:25:06,880 --> 02:25:08,960
No, I didn't make it.

2805
02:25:08,960 --> 02:25:10,840
All right, all right.

2806
02:25:10,840 --> 02:25:12,640
Then plug away.

2807
02:25:12,640 --> 02:25:14,000
Okay.

2808
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:27,400
So basically, the story is you got these evil greenish pigs or whatever that stole the birds'

2809
02:25:27,400 --> 02:25:34,360
eggs and whatnot, and they're probably just doing God knows what with them.

2810
02:25:34,360 --> 02:25:47,680
And so what you have to do is unleash your vengeance with your birds by basically flinging

2811
02:25:47,680 --> 02:26:04,320
them, like across this little map, and destroying and eliminating all the pigs in the game.

2812
02:26:04,320 --> 02:26:09,660
Actually, I gotta tell you, real quick, Amigas77, I don't mean to cut you off, but we actually

2813
02:26:09,660 --> 02:26:12,980
just got delivered an exclusive commercial for the game.

2814
02:26:12,980 --> 02:26:13,980
You want to hear it?

2815
02:26:13,980 --> 02:26:14,980
Oh, yeah, sure.

2816
02:26:14,980 --> 02:26:17,200
Yeah, here it is, exclusive commercial for the game.

2817
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:18,200
Right.

2818
02:26:18,200 --> 02:26:21,820
Brian, could I see that paper for a sec?

2819
02:26:21,820 --> 02:26:22,820
Huh.

2820
02:26:22,820 --> 02:26:23,820
That's odd.

2821
02:26:23,820 --> 02:26:26,560
I thought that would be big news.

2822
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:27,820
You thought what would be big news?

2823
02:26:27,820 --> 02:26:31,900
Well, there seems to be an absence of a certain ornithological piece,

2824
02:26:32,940 --> 02:26:37,420
a headline regarding mass awareness of a certain avian variety.

2825
02:26:37,420 --> 02:26:38,460
What are you talking about?

2826
02:26:38,460 --> 02:26:39,340
Oh, have you not heard?

2827
02:26:39,900 --> 02:26:42,220
It was my understanding that everyone had heard.

2828
02:26:42,220 --> 02:26:42,780
Heard what?

2829
02:26:42,780 --> 02:26:43,420
Brian, don't!

2830
02:26:43,420 --> 02:26:47,820
A well-a-bird-bird-bird, a bird-a-well-a-bird-bird-bird.

2831
02:26:47,820 --> 02:26:49,100
Greatest episode ever.

2832
02:26:49,100 --> 02:26:52,300
A well-a-bird-bird-bird-bird, a bird-a-well-a-bird-bird-bird.

2833
02:26:52,300 --> 02:26:55,580
A bird's a word of Brian, don't you know about the bird?

2834
02:26:55,580 --> 02:26:59,580
Well, Peter's gonna tell you about the bird-a-well-a-bird-bird,

2835
02:26:59,580 --> 02:27:03,580
the bird's a word-a-well-a-bird-surfing bird.

2836
02:27:03,580 --> 02:27:14,940
Oh my god, Peter, are you all right?

2837
02:27:28,300 --> 02:27:31,820
This just in, Angry Birds just sold 10,000 copies right there.

2838
02:27:31,820 --> 02:27:32,700
Seriously?

2839
02:27:32,700 --> 02:27:36,220
No, I'm just fucking with you, come on.

2840
02:27:37,100 --> 02:27:39,180
This is Orange Lounge Radio, for heaven's sakes.

2841
02:27:39,180 --> 02:27:41,180
We love random tangents.

2842
02:27:41,180 --> 02:27:43,420
Sorry, I couldn't resist, I'm sorry.

2843
02:27:43,980 --> 02:27:45,340
Oh, that was awesome.

2844
02:27:45,340 --> 02:27:46,540
No, it's all good.

2845
02:27:46,540 --> 02:27:48,620
But seriously, it is selling a lot,

2846
02:27:48,620 --> 02:27:52,460
and the company claims it's in more countries than they can count.

2847
02:27:53,180 --> 02:27:54,460
It's become a big deal.

2848
02:27:56,700 --> 02:28:00,540
So, how much is this game going to sit you back?

2849
02:28:00,540 --> 02:28:03,420
Oh, it's just 99 cents.

2850
02:28:03,420 --> 02:28:05,420
Oh, well that's not bad at all.

2851
02:28:05,420 --> 02:28:08,700
Like, some people are saying it's so good, they think it's underpriced.

2852
02:28:09,420 --> 02:28:12,860
Well, now, I don't want them to go the route of that one guy

2853
02:28:12,860 --> 02:28:15,260
who, like, kept increasing the price of his game.

2854
02:28:15,260 --> 02:28:18,620
Like, what was that one game that went up to like $10,000 on the store

2855
02:28:18,620 --> 02:28:20,540
before Apple was like, what the fuck are you doing?

2856
02:28:20,540 --> 02:28:21,420
I don't know, he's a douchebag.

2857
02:28:21,420 --> 02:28:23,500
Get out, douchebag.

2858
02:28:23,500 --> 02:28:25,020
It was a social experiment.

2859
02:28:25,020 --> 02:28:27,100
Well, actually, you know what, though?

2860
02:28:27,100 --> 02:28:28,780
So what, he raised the price of his game.

2861
02:28:28,780 --> 02:28:30,220
People were dumb enough to buy it.

2862
02:28:30,220 --> 02:28:33,260
So, props to him for figuring out a way to make money.

2863
02:28:35,900 --> 02:28:36,380
Yeah.

2864
02:28:36,380 --> 02:28:36,860
All right.

2865
02:28:36,860 --> 02:28:43,500
Well, Amiga777, hopefully some folks will check out Angry Bird this week

2866
02:28:43,500 --> 02:28:46,860
and realize that the bird is indeed the word.

2867
02:28:46,860 --> 02:28:47,580
B-b-b-bird.

2868
02:28:47,580 --> 02:28:49,100
I need to get down.

2869
02:28:52,060 --> 02:28:54,220
Are you sure you didn't, are you sure you don't, like,

2870
02:28:54,220 --> 02:28:55,580
know the people that programmed it?

2871
02:28:55,580 --> 02:28:57,900
Or, you know, getting the cut for the profits?

2872
02:28:57,900 --> 02:29:02,540
Um, the name of the company?

2873
02:29:03,900 --> 02:29:05,900
No, do you know the people that made it?

2874
02:29:07,100 --> 02:29:11,100
Um, ClickGamer and Ravio.

2875
02:29:11,100 --> 02:29:11,500
Oh, OK.

2876
02:29:11,500 --> 02:29:12,620
You don't know them personally, though?

2877
02:29:12,620 --> 02:29:13,500
You don't have, like, their phone number?

2878
02:29:13,500 --> 02:29:15,100
No, I don't know the people.

2879
02:29:16,380 --> 02:29:16,860
All right.

2880
02:29:16,860 --> 02:29:18,940
Well, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show.

2881
02:29:18,940 --> 02:29:19,900
But thanks for the plug.

2882
02:29:19,900 --> 02:29:22,540
I'm sure the developers of the game really appreciate you right now.

2883
02:29:23,660 --> 02:29:24,140
Yeah.

2884
02:29:24,140 --> 02:29:25,100
And we appreciate you, too.

2885
02:29:25,100 --> 02:29:26,140
Take care, buddy.

2886
02:29:26,140 --> 02:29:26,620
Take care.

2887
02:29:26,620 --> 02:29:27,420
Take care.

2888
02:29:27,420 --> 02:29:27,900
All right.

2889
02:29:27,900 --> 02:29:29,820
That's going to do it for the Skypline tonight.

2890
02:29:31,500 --> 02:29:34,300
It's kind of funny because we don't really run commercials on this show.

2891
02:29:34,300 --> 02:29:35,100
But yet we do.

2892
02:29:36,620 --> 02:29:39,100
It's always somebody's podcast or game.

2893
02:29:39,100 --> 02:29:40,220
No, it's all good.

2894
02:29:40,220 --> 02:29:40,700
You know what?

2895
02:29:40,700 --> 02:29:42,060
We want to know what people are playing.

2896
02:29:42,060 --> 02:29:44,220
And I'm all for supporting indie developers.

2897
02:29:44,220 --> 02:29:44,780
It's all good.

2898
02:29:45,340 --> 02:29:45,740
All right.

2899
02:29:46,460 --> 02:29:46,940
That's it.

2900
02:29:46,940 --> 02:29:52,300
We're about ready to wrap up shop and be done here with the show tonight and be all over.

2901
02:29:52,300 --> 02:29:55,580
I don't know if you had any other last minute stories you want to get to before I close the show.

2902
02:29:55,580 --> 02:29:57,260
Not really a story at all.

2903
02:29:57,260 --> 02:30:01,660
But I think I mentioned on my Twitter, I got picked.

2904
02:30:01,660 --> 02:30:03,500
Not that I'm actually going to use the service.

2905
02:30:03,500 --> 02:30:09,420
I got picked to be a part of the Game Crush service, basically.

2906
02:30:09,420 --> 02:30:11,980
Because right now they have limited access to the website.

2907
02:30:11,980 --> 02:30:17,500
Is that the, like, almost prostitution but with video games?

2908
02:30:17,500 --> 02:30:17,740
Yes.

2909
02:30:17,740 --> 02:30:19,820
But now we get to view the actual website because I have...

2910
02:30:21,500 --> 02:30:22,300
It's funny.

2911
02:30:22,300 --> 02:30:26,860
I am all for tearing this thing up and looking at it on next week's show.

2912
02:30:26,860 --> 02:30:30,060
However, make sure there's no NDA or nothing because I don't want to get in no trouble.

2913
02:30:30,060 --> 02:30:30,780
Cease and desist.

2914
02:30:30,780 --> 02:30:31,500
Whatever.

2915
02:30:31,500 --> 02:30:33,260
Make sure we're good there.

2916
02:30:33,260 --> 02:30:33,580
All right.

2917
02:30:34,940 --> 02:30:35,260
All right.

2918
02:30:35,260 --> 02:30:36,620
Well, then we'll look at that in a few weeks.

2919
02:30:37,980 --> 02:30:38,460
That's it.

2920
02:30:38,460 --> 02:30:40,700
And I'm assuming our soccer doesn't have any last minute stories.

2921
02:30:40,700 --> 02:30:41,740
I think she said a moment ago.

2922
02:30:41,740 --> 02:30:42,700
Nope.

2923
02:30:42,700 --> 02:30:43,420
All right.

2924
02:30:43,420 --> 02:30:46,700
We're going to let her go back to playing Final Fantasy 2 and everybody go back to whatever

2925
02:30:46,700 --> 02:30:47,420
they're doing.

2926
02:30:47,420 --> 02:30:48,140
All right.

2927
02:30:48,140 --> 02:30:52,380
But first, we're going to wrap up the show by getting everybody's final thoughts.

2928
02:30:53,420 --> 02:30:54,460
My final thought first.

2929
02:30:54,460 --> 02:30:55,180
I'll start tonight.

2930
02:30:55,180 --> 02:30:56,700
I really don't want to go to the dentist.

2931
02:30:57,740 --> 02:30:58,700
Loki, your final thought.

2932
02:31:03,660 --> 02:31:05,100
Somebody leaked Sonic 4.

2933
02:31:06,460 --> 02:31:08,860
Dark Sakura, last but not least, your final thought tonight.

2934
02:31:09,660 --> 02:31:10,540
I want pie.

2935
02:31:11,900 --> 02:31:13,340
I had banana cream pie last night.

2936
02:31:13,340 --> 02:31:13,980
It was fabulous.

2937
02:31:13,980 --> 02:31:15,020
But I'm not eating pie.

2938
02:31:15,020 --> 02:31:17,740
I'll just make myself some chocolate something.

2939
02:31:17,740 --> 02:31:18,220
There you go.

2940
02:31:19,500 --> 02:31:21,900
Can't you have like spinach pie or something?

2941
02:31:22,860 --> 02:31:25,740
If I wasn't out of bananas, I'd just make myself some banana pudding.

2942
02:31:26,620 --> 02:31:29,580
Now, I know the whole thing is raw foods, but are you allowed to...

2943
02:31:30,220 --> 02:31:33,820
Like if you are putting it together and you put spinach and all this stuff in there,

2944
02:31:33,820 --> 02:31:35,660
are you allowed to put it in the oven and cook it?

2945
02:31:35,660 --> 02:31:37,260
Or no, you still have to stay away from that?

2946
02:31:37,820 --> 02:31:39,980
Allowing is such a strong word.

2947
02:31:41,260 --> 02:31:43,340
If I want it cooked, I'll have it cooked.

2948
02:31:43,340 --> 02:31:44,300
I mean, I'm not that.

2949
02:31:45,100 --> 02:31:45,980
As long as...

2950
02:31:45,980 --> 02:31:50,780
But the whole essence they say is not to heat it more than 117 degrees

2951
02:31:50,780 --> 02:31:52,540
because that's when the enzymes are destroyed.

2952
02:31:54,460 --> 02:31:55,500
Okay, that's why.

2953
02:31:55,500 --> 02:31:57,420
That being said, I hate cooked spinach.

2954
02:31:58,220 --> 02:31:59,180
Unless it's on a pizza.

2955
02:32:00,460 --> 02:32:02,620
Yeah, I like raw spinach much better.

2956
02:32:02,620 --> 02:32:04,300
Like spinach salad is the bomb.

2957
02:32:04,860 --> 02:32:08,380
I'm actually got stuff together to make myself a good spinach salad for lunch tomorrow.

2958
02:32:08,380 --> 02:32:08,880
Good times.

2959
02:32:09,660 --> 02:32:10,620
All right, anyhow.

2960
02:32:10,620 --> 02:32:13,660
See, it starts and ends with food here at Orange Launch Radio.

2961
02:32:13,660 --> 02:32:17,660
But if you like the show, please, please tell a friend about the show.

2962
02:32:17,660 --> 02:32:19,660
That's all we ask every week here at Orange Launch Radio.

2963
02:32:19,660 --> 02:32:22,940
We do this for free just because we love you guys and we love doing this show

2964
02:32:22,940 --> 02:32:24,540
and bringing the community together.

2965
02:32:24,540 --> 02:32:26,620
So all we ask, help add to our community.

2966
02:32:26,620 --> 02:32:28,220
Tell a friend or two about the show.

2967
02:32:28,220 --> 02:32:32,140
And if you're shy and don't want to do that or don't have friends you think would be into this,

2968
02:32:32,140 --> 02:32:33,980
then help us spread the word on the internets.

2969
02:32:33,980 --> 02:32:35,580
Leave us a 5-star review on iTunes.

2970
02:32:35,580 --> 02:32:37,100
It's like the best thing you could do.

2971
02:32:37,100 --> 02:32:39,580
Just search for Orange Launch Radio on iTunes and say,

2972
02:32:39,580 --> 02:32:41,980
I love OLR and leave a 5-star review.

2973
02:32:41,980 --> 02:32:44,060
I think there was actually a new one that was posted this week.

2974
02:32:44,060 --> 02:32:46,780
So thanks to, and I don't have it up in front of me right now,

2975
02:32:46,780 --> 02:32:48,380
but thanks to whoever posted that.

2976
02:32:48,380 --> 02:32:49,820
I'll try to credit you in a future week.

2977
02:32:50,860 --> 02:32:51,500
So that's it.

2978
02:32:52,860 --> 02:32:53,660
We're done.

2979
02:32:53,660 --> 02:32:54,380
We're out of here.

2980
02:32:55,100 --> 02:32:58,460
Until next week, we'll be back to do it all again.

2981
02:32:58,460 --> 02:32:59,180
Sound good, guys?

2982
02:32:59,820 --> 02:33:00,860
We'll be back next week.

2983
02:33:02,540 --> 02:33:04,300
Until then, I'm Rob.

2984
02:33:04,300 --> 02:33:05,100
She's Jamie.

2985
02:33:05,100 --> 02:33:05,900
He's Matt.

2986
02:33:05,900 --> 02:33:06,460
And we're done.

2987
02:33:08,060 --> 02:33:11,260
