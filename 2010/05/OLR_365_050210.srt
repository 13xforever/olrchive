1
00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:18,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, May 2nd, 2010, is a six-player 2D Castlevania game on the way?

2
00:00:19,366 --> 00:00:23,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Bungie signs a new publishing deal, and is yet another sequel to Red Steel on the way?

3
00:00:31,368 --> 00:00:34,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Enough arguing about the graphics card in our chat room.

4
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeez, it's like all these wars.

5
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:37,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't we all just get along?

6
00:00:37,192 --> 00:00:37,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hey!

7
00:00:37,992 --> 00:00:45,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, my friends, and welcome to episode number 365 of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:45,657 --> 00:00:54,924
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one, the only, the ultimate, the sometimes friendly, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:56,124 --> 00:00:56,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

10
00:00:56,865 --> 00:00:57,625
[SPEAKER_08]: My headache's gone.

11
00:00:58,046 --> 00:01:00,127
[SPEAKER_05]: But always ready to make guacamole.

12
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my guacamole was really good.

13
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:18,700
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

14
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:37,689
[SPEAKER_09]: It can't hurt.

15
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,230
[SPEAKER_05]: It can only help.

16
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,110
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say this.

17
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:45,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Years and years ago, probably about seven, eight years ago, I used to date someone who is vegan, allegedly.

18
00:01:45,995 --> 00:01:49,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to date someone who is vegan, and he really, really liked to cook.

19
00:01:50,437 --> 00:01:53,239
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will tell you, and I don't like to cook, so I would eat

20
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:54,700
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the food that he made.

21
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:24,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Between that and that was at the peak of me playing DDR and doing the tournaments and that was when the Orange Bat stuff happened when the show was born, etc.

22
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,431
[SPEAKER_05]: I was never thinner.

23
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:28,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm fat.

24
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:35,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and the whole thing of it is, you know, I really just stopped and looked at everything that I was consuming.

25
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:39,458
[SPEAKER_09]: I was having, you know, a couple of sugar-free Red Bulls a day and coffee.

26
00:02:40,218 --> 00:02:41,419
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was having trouble sleeping.

27
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Duh!

28
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:42,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Gee, I wonder why.

29
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,184
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was really stressed out from work and from, you know, my school projects and a lot of other stuff I have going on.

30
00:02:48,284 --> 00:02:52,367
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just decided that it's time that I stop putting this off.

31
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:53,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop putting this?

32
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:59,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, stop putting this off, and just start, you know, doing something for myself.

33
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:09,947
[SPEAKER_09]: And, yeah, and no, it's not like the crazy vegan type of people, like, oh, organic food is the only kind of food you can eat, and all these have drugs in them, and... Meat is water!

34
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:11,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, fuck PETA.

35
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, however, however...

36
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:21,743
[SPEAKER_09]: I do think that the belief would not be there if there hadn't been some basis for it.

37
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:25,166
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I'm doing this for me.

38
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:26,767
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not doing it for the bunnies.

39
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:29,089
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not doing it for the cows.

40
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I did find that corn fed cow makes me sick.

41
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:33,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Grass fed cow does not.

42
00:03:34,741 --> 00:03:35,882
[SPEAKER_05]: How strange.

43
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,703
[SPEAKER_05]: I just never would have thought there was a difference.

44
00:03:37,763 --> 00:03:42,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep in mind they feed cows antibiotics to make them digest corn, because cows are not meant to eat corn.

45
00:03:42,627 --> 00:03:43,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Neither are humans.

46
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Neither are humans.

47
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, I love corn.

48
00:03:48,452 --> 00:03:48,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me go.

49
00:03:49,132 --> 00:03:50,273
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got to introduce everybody here.

50
00:03:50,894 --> 00:03:56,458
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry for going off on it, but I have to say right now, my headache has finally gone away.

51
00:03:57,867 --> 00:04:02,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me also introduce the host, voted least likely to go vegetarian of all the OLR hosts.

52
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

53
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,751
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll never go vegetarian.

54
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:06,331
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

55
00:04:06,391 --> 00:04:07,791
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to give up your double downs.

56
00:04:08,412 --> 00:04:09,952
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't eat the double downs anymore.

57
00:04:09,972 --> 00:04:13,754
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not worth it, seriously.

58
00:04:13,774 --> 00:04:17,676
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just experiment to see if it was any good.

59
00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:22,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I see right through their scam of giving me two pieces of chicken for a lot of money.

60
00:04:22,423 --> 00:04:26,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, tonight I noticed you've gone back to the old standard personal size pizza.

61
00:04:27,146 --> 00:04:29,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Wrong, it was six parmesan twists.

62
00:04:29,648 --> 00:04:30,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

63
00:04:30,609 --> 00:04:32,170
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's because those are really delicious.

64
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,031
[SPEAKER_05]: They are delicious.

65
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:34,752
[SPEAKER_05]: But also vegetarian.

66
00:04:37,148 --> 00:04:43,175
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but not true vegetarian because it's cheese and all that stuff.

67
00:04:43,956 --> 00:04:45,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever the cheese and egg.

68
00:04:45,878 --> 00:04:46,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Labia?

69
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:46,659
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

70
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:50,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Octolavio or something like that.

71
00:04:50,263 --> 00:04:50,624
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

72
00:04:51,385 --> 00:04:53,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't researched my vegan terminology yet.

73
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:54,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

[SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have the fight stick, right?

00:06:14,303 --> 00:06:14,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are you giggling?

89
00:06:15,324 --> 00:06:15,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Because.

90
00:06:17,286 --> 00:06:17,726
[SPEAKER_05]: I know why.

91
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:18,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

92
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:20,468

00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:22,910
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys have the fight stick on 360, right?

94
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:23,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

95
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

96
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:27,293
[SPEAKER_09]: But we do have some news though about Game Crazy.

97
00:06:27,893 --> 00:06:28,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

98
00:06:28,694 --> 00:06:31,996
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was going to wait until later on in the show but I figured I'd go ahead and say it because I got an email.

99
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:37,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I didn't show roll it because I didn't know if you wanted to talk about it or not, but go ahead and take the floor.

100
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:40,461
[SPEAKER_09]: I said I was going to wait, but... GameCrazy's gone out of business.

101
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:49,947
[SPEAKER_09]: So, instead of my husband having three weeks of work, he's got 13 weeks of work, so that's good, but at the same time, bye-bye GameCrazy.

102
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:50,848
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

103
00:06:51,914 --> 00:06:57,236
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the rumors have been floating around the internet, and I think the stories we've seen on the internet were a rumor, but... It's true.

104
00:06:57,396 --> 00:06:57,736
[SPEAKER_05]: It's true.

105
00:06:58,776 --> 00:07:03,017
[SPEAKER_09]: We got confirmation a week ago, so... Well, I'm sorry to hear it.

106
00:07:03,037 --> 00:07:04,018
[SPEAKER_09]: More like a couple days ago.

107
00:07:04,678 --> 00:07:07,999
[SPEAKER_05]: But for every door that closes, another opens, blah, blah, blah, blah.

108
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:08,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Yada, yada, yada.

109
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:09,259
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be okay.

110
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,240
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not worried.

111
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,000
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll put it this way.

112
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,480
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not worried.

113
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:14,181
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it's all good.

114
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:14,601
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not worried.

115
00:07:15,003 --> 00:07:22,550
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a bummer, though, that an alternative to Baron Von GameStop is now closing.

116
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,472
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like they're just dropping like flies.

117
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:27,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you totally see the GameTrader store that's on Antelope?

118
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:28,275
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

119
00:07:28,335 --> 00:07:29,016
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's more local.

120
00:07:29,036 --> 00:07:34,121
[SPEAKER_06]: We sell them, yes, and I know they have their logo that's a blatant ripoff of GameStop.

121
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:35,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks identical to GameStop.

122
00:07:35,942 --> 00:07:39,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, the same freaking font.

123
00:07:40,147 --> 00:07:43,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mean to get local on you guys, but maybe there's like one or two.

124
00:07:44,492 --> 00:07:46,994
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the guy we met in the line at Target that listens to the show.

125
00:07:47,014 --> 00:07:48,836
[SPEAKER_05]: So somebody in Sacramento, if he's even still listening.

126
00:07:49,197 --> 00:07:50,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people in Sacramento are listening.

127
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:54,803
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also, have you seen that place on Sunrise, Smashburger?

128
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that too!

129
00:07:57,144 --> 00:08:01,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Same font, same white and red color and everything, but it's a burger joint.

130
00:08:01,486 --> 00:08:04,387
[SPEAKER_09]: The font is not a condensed font.

131
00:08:04,427 --> 00:08:05,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Close.

132
00:08:06,147 --> 00:08:10,889
[SPEAKER_05]: It's different enough that they can't... You're weird.

133
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,130
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I noticed this stuff.

134
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:17,892
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, I'm going to take a picture and put it on the site, but this is the newspaper that I did.

135
00:08:18,312 --> 00:08:20,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

136
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's all actually printed on paper.

137
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:22,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly, so I'm going to take a picture of it.

138
00:08:24,395 --> 00:08:25,676
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like I can get all my Jewish news.

139
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it was for a fundraiser.

140
00:08:28,037 --> 00:08:30,639
[SPEAKER_09]: The temple that I go to had a big fundraiser called All That Jazz.

141
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you were plugging in on the show a couple weeks ago.

142
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,661
[SPEAKER_05]: They wanted a newspaper to distribute.

143
00:08:33,701 --> 00:08:35,222
[SPEAKER_05]: No OLR fans at the show?

144
00:08:36,462 --> 00:08:36,963
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't go.

145
00:08:39,304 --> 00:08:40,705
[SPEAKER_09]: You know why I didn't go, Rob?

146
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:44,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Because guess who was sitting her happy butt here in this chair doing OLR?

147
00:08:44,728 --> 00:08:45,328
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

148
00:08:45,348 --> 00:08:45,828
[SPEAKER_09]: That was me.

149
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:46,369
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

150
00:08:48,405 --> 00:08:51,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, by the way, there are some alternatives.

151
00:08:51,468 --> 00:08:52,609
[SPEAKER_05]: There's what, the Game Trader?

152
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:53,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what they're called?

153
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Game Trader or Trater?

154
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:55,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Trader.

155
00:08:56,213 --> 00:08:58,535
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also that Fair Game.

156
00:08:58,595 --> 00:08:59,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I know the guys there.

157
00:08:59,676 --> 00:09:01,618
[SPEAKER_05]: The guys at Fair Game are rad.

158
00:09:01,838 --> 00:09:02,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Aren't they expanding?

159
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:06,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's the one over on Fair Oaks, and then there's one right by my house in Rosemont.

160
00:09:06,823 --> 00:09:07,443
[SPEAKER_05]: X-Box Repairs Quote

161
00:09:33,648 --> 00:09:35,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me go to chat, chat.orange.com.

162
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma says, with GameCrazy going out of business, we only have GameStop left.

163
00:09:39,114 --> 00:09:40,535
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lawsuit in there somewhere.

164
00:09:40,575 --> 00:09:40,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Monopoly?

165
00:09:41,336 --> 00:09:44,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Trust me, there's people that want to make game stores all the time.

166
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:50,946
[SPEAKER_06]: And just like how Blockbuster closing a bunch of stores and Hollywood closing a bunch of stores.

167
00:09:50,986 --> 00:09:54,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Hollywood's definitely going to be closing a lot of stores and same with movie gallery and stuff.

168
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,252
[SPEAKER_06]: How that has sparked the independent video growth.

169
00:10:00,412 --> 00:10:05,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you're going to see the independent game store growth go up a little bit.

170
00:10:06,095 --> 00:10:07,475
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, game crazies are out there.

171
00:10:07,515 --> 00:10:11,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely not out there as heavily as, say, GameStop right now.

172
00:10:12,037 --> 00:10:14,298
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's always alternatives.

173
00:10:14,338 --> 00:10:15,919
[SPEAKER_06]: You just have to kind of search them out.

174
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:20,721
[SPEAKER_05]: You're also forgetting GameStop's biggest competitor in some ways is Walmart.

175
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:24,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Target, Best Buy.

176
00:10:24,702 --> 00:10:26,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are all big, big game retailers.

177
00:10:26,443 --> 00:10:29,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, as far as the used game market goes, I don't know.

178
00:10:29,804 --> 00:10:32,165
[SPEAKER_05]: But you always hear rumors about those companies maybe wanting to get into it.

179
00:10:32,626 --> 00:10:33,046
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

180
00:10:33,426 --> 00:10:41,269
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just sad when more stores like this close, especially when it affects people we know very, very well and so forth.

181
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, I hope things go okay in that situation.

182
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:47,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Let us know if there's going to be any good sales at least, whatever it is.

183
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:50,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Silver lining we can find in this tragic news.

184
00:10:51,315 --> 00:10:52,756
[SPEAKER_09]: They are in the middle of liquidation.

185
00:10:52,776 --> 00:10:56,338
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what they say, when life hands you lemons... Throw them back?

186
00:10:56,939 --> 00:11:06,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Throw them against the wall, stomp on them, squish them, say I don't wanna... I like how Ron White puts it, to quote, When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.

187
00:11:07,487 --> 00:11:15,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Or, when life gives you lemons, find someone who gives potatoes and makes some lemon vodka or something.

188
00:11:15,774 --> 00:11:15,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Tom.

189
00:11:19,219 --> 00:11:19,820
[SPEAKER_09]: I said it wrong.

190
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Worst quote.

191
00:11:21,322 --> 00:11:22,042
[SPEAKER_09]: I said it wrong.

192
00:11:22,062 --> 00:11:27,068
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, no, when life gives you lemons, make lemonades and then go find someone whose life gave them vodka.

193
00:11:27,628 --> 00:11:27,969
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

194
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

195
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,576
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even remember if we were still talking about that or not.

196
00:11:34,596 --> 00:11:34,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

197
00:11:34,896 --> 00:11:38,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Once in a while we talk about video games amongst the guacamole and the vodka.

198
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:38,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

199
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,462
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ron White quotes gone horribly wrong.

200
00:11:40,482 --> 00:11:40,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

201
00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:44,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I played a few things this week.

202
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:49,112
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried out some of the upcoming Xbox Live Arcade games.

203
00:11:49,212 --> 00:11:55,935
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, not anything I was really impressed with because they're just like ports of old arcade games or semi-recent arcade games, I guess.

204
00:11:56,836 --> 00:11:59,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Racestorm HD, kind of cool.

205
00:12:00,077 --> 00:12:04,580
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have Racestorm on my arcade cabinet at home, so...

206
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, it's just slightly crisper graphics, and that's it.

207
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:12,005
[SPEAKER_06]: But otherwise, it plays pretty much exactly the same.

208
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:17,390
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, Neo Geo Battle Coliseum was okay.

209
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:26,937
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually never played that in the arcade, and it was kind of neat to be able to play as one of the characters from Metal Slug in a fighting game, because he uses his gun a lot.

210
00:12:27,518 --> 00:12:29,620
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was pretty cool.

211
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,281
[SPEAKER_06]: So that should be coming out hopefully soon.

212
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:32,362
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Raystorm, I think...

213
00:12:32,702 --> 00:12:34,523
[SPEAKER_06]: We have it in the show role, I think, later on.

214
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,664
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's also coming soon.

215
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:38,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Then other things.

216
00:12:40,646 --> 00:12:41,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Play more Grand Theft Auto.

217
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:43,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Still trying to dominate that.

218
00:12:44,488 --> 00:12:54,314
[SPEAKER_06]: And played against one guy today who thought... I love these people that I play against that think they're so good and going to teach me a lesson and stuff.

219
00:12:54,534 --> 00:12:56,575
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I get like a thousand... Did they tell you that?

220
00:12:56,595 --> 00:12:57,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

221
00:12:57,055 --> 00:12:58,316
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to teach you a lesson.

222
00:12:58,416 --> 00:12:59,116
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, seriously.

223
00:12:59,156 --> 00:12:59,617
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like...

224
00:13:00,457 --> 00:13:02,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you better remember that!

225
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:10,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you better remember that you got a lucky kill on me after I chased you down through the entire damn city trying to kill you, even though I was $1,500 ahead.

226
00:13:10,744 --> 00:13:13,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yes, you're so cool that you got one kill on me.

227
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,988
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that totally negates those other 15 I got on you.

228
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:20,431
[SPEAKER_05]: You will remember that as the one kill they got on you all day.

229
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:21,071
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he quit.

230
00:13:21,712 --> 00:13:21,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Loser.

231
00:13:23,312 --> 00:13:43,384
[SPEAKER_06]: and then I actually went back to playing a little bit more free mode because it is damn hard to get a ranked deathmatch game nowadays especially in the Battle of the Gay Tonys so free mode has actually been pretty fun we've been running across a bunch of strange people on there so definitely a good time waster

232
00:13:44,464 --> 00:13:57,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, other non-Grand Theft Auto related stuff, played some Marvel vs. Capcom 2 on my arcade cabinet, because, uh, you know, very excited about the sequel coming out, so, gotta get some of that in.

233
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:02,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully have the serve bot back, because that's an awesome character to play as.

234
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:10,560
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, um, I think, I think that's it for right now, because I know I've been playing a lot of stuff, but I just can't remember all of it.

235
00:14:11,331 --> 00:14:38,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well last week I didn't play a whole lot of games So you guys would be very proud of me that I made up for lost time this week I played Super Street Fighter 4 I bought it on PS3 because as I mentioned on the show a couple weeks ago I don't think I play enough Street Fighter to really justify the arcade stick purchase But I am a fan enough of Street Fighter where I want to buy the upgraded version of Street Fighter So I bought it on PS3 because I've decided I'm declaring war on that D-pad on the 360 And I'm not...

236
00:14:41,104 --> 00:14:49,330
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why it's taking them so long.

237
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,053
[SPEAKER_06]: So the PlayStation 3... Then what's frustrating is they did at one time.

238
00:14:54,153 --> 00:14:57,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember in Europe they had the green one and they fixed the D-pad apparently.

239
00:14:57,595 --> 00:14:57,835
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

240
00:14:58,676 --> 00:15:02,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would you... Maybe they're waiting for Natal or something.

241
00:15:02,178 --> 00:15:02,539
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

242
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:03,859
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they're not waiting for anything.

243
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would you fix the problem and go, oh!

244
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:07,777
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

245
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:27,679
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

246
00:15:54,702 --> 00:15:55,623
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

247
00:16:23,577 --> 00:16:26,280
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will tell you who I love is Guy.

248
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I love Guy.

249
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:29,083
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my favorite character to play.

250
00:16:29,503 --> 00:16:30,364
[SPEAKER_09]: He's just fun.

251
00:16:30,404 --> 00:16:33,928
[SPEAKER_09]: And I like how every parting shot of him is his butt.

252
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:37,211
[SPEAKER_09]: They have this thing with butts in Super Street Fighter 4.

253
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:37,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you noticed?

254
00:16:38,312 --> 00:16:40,014
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean, surprise, no.

255
00:16:40,194 --> 00:16:45,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I just really like playing as him because he can fly across the screen and do all these cheap kick moves that I love.

256
00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:46,120
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Guy.

257
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:46,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you play Cody?

258
00:16:47,681 --> 00:16:49,083
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com.

259
00:17:06,221 --> 00:17:06,841
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

260
00:17:25,513 --> 00:17:28,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to tell you, though, this is a huge accomplishment for me.

261
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:32,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I was playing matches online, ranked matches, and winning some.

262
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:36,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, that's huge for me, because I don't think I ever won a single one on 360.

263
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:41,229
[SPEAKER_05]: But I won my first match on PS3, and I'm not winning them all, but I'm winning some.

264
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:48,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta say, the skill match I'm getting is actually pretty good, because I will play a guy...

265
00:17:49,076 --> 00:18:05,582
[SPEAKER_05]: and go for like five rounds if the game is configured that way and you know win narrowly and there will be like another guy I was fighting back and forth we just kept coming up against each other in ranked matches and he won half and I won half like it's actually really matching me up pretty well so I gotta I gotta say that

266
00:18:06,863 --> 00:18:22,657
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw in chat says oh here's another thing guys if you play as Guy or Cody in the car smasher bonus stage you get the oh my car easter egg oh I thought that was normal cause the first time I ever played that bonus stage was with Guy and I just thought that was what was supposed to happen but that makes sense cause that happens in Final Fight too

267
00:18:23,397 --> 00:18:30,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of Final Fight, Alan and I decided just for the hell of it we would play through all of Final Fight Double Impact version, the Final Fight game.

268
00:18:31,383 --> 00:18:33,825
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we played through the whole game the other night.

269
00:18:33,845 --> 00:18:35,747
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't take that long, maybe an hour at most.

270
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:37,068
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was kind of fun to play.

271
00:18:37,668 --> 00:18:38,529
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we went through that.

272
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:46,715
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other big, big event in my world is that I finally said I can't take it anymore with my old graphics card anymore.

273
00:18:46,915 --> 00:18:47,155
[SPEAKER_05]: DRAGON AGE

274
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:15,374
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought Dragon Age during the Christmas sale when it was only like $30, but I was really having a hard time playing it because my old video card just couldn't handle it.

275
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:20,919
[SPEAKER_05]: And for those of you that are asking, I originally had an ATI Radeon 33.

276
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,863
[SPEAKER_05]: I got an ATI Radeon 5770 and there was a lot of drama trying to get the card installed because...

277
00:19:48,656 --> 00:19:49,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Bless Alan's heart.

278
00:19:49,517 --> 00:19:50,998
[SPEAKER_05]: He knows how to do all that stuff.

279
00:19:51,278 --> 00:19:59,344
[SPEAKER_05]: I could probably figure it out, but this thing would have confused the hell out of me because this graphic card takes up two slots.

280
00:19:59,504 --> 00:20:03,667
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so big and has this gigantic fan on it, and that would have confused me.

281
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:12,633
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we had to actually go upgrade the power supply because it needs its own power source, and it can't run on the old power supply I had.

282
00:20:12,973 --> 00:20:16,876
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, thank God he knew how to recognize all this stuff because I would have just been lost and cried.

283
00:20:17,176 --> 00:20:19,978
[SPEAKER_06]: You might have been able to get away with the old power supply if you had the converter for it.

284
00:20:21,378 --> 00:20:22,439
[SPEAKER_05]: We just got a new supply.

285
00:20:22,459 --> 00:20:25,701
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like $30, and now it's like 600 watts as opposed to 300.

286
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:26,762
[SPEAKER_05]: So it works great.

287
00:20:27,082 --> 00:20:27,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, 300, yeah.

288
00:20:28,002 --> 00:20:28,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

289
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,945
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, no, the card works great, and I was able to play Dragon Age.

290
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:33,165
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was playing that for a couple hours.

291
00:20:33,986 --> 00:20:37,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Did a little bit of the Warrior Human beginning because Alan wanted to show me some stuff there.

292
00:20:38,148 --> 00:20:42,971
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was playing the Mage opening a little bit earlier today, which played so much better.

293
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:44,212
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

294
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:25,637
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not a bad deal for Guild Wars because Guild Wars is one of those games you don't pay a monthly fee for it so I can buy it now and if I have the itch to play it in like six months I can just say oh I'll just fire up Guild Wars did you overclock your graphics card once you got it?

295
00:21:26,177 --> 00:21:31,200
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think he did that no oh you should it's simple and it's extra oomph

296
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,261
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

297
00:21:56,895 --> 00:21:58,476
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't really play it enough.

298
00:21:58,596 --> 00:22:01,678
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, both Dragon Age and Guild Wars I only spent a couple hours with.

299
00:22:02,198 --> 00:22:08,002
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's fun to be able to play PC games again and not have my computer crying out in pain from it.

300
00:22:08,362 --> 00:22:19,029
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's also exciting, and I just realized on the drive over here, is that between that new card, my quad core, my 8 gigs of RAM, I ain't going to have a problem playing Final Fantasy XIV on my PC.

301
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,571
[SPEAKER_05]: So, waiting for that beta test.

302
00:22:24,957 --> 00:22:31,979
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to upgrade my graphics cards because I have two of them running in SLI, but they're like 8800 Radeon GTS 512s.

303
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want my old card?

304
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:33,700
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

305
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,341
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a power supply and an old video card.

306
00:22:36,361 --> 00:22:37,882
[SPEAKER_05]: My card's way better than that.

307
00:22:39,142 --> 00:22:45,644
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a lot of stuff, like if I were to go back and do it again, a lot of these games don't run SLI and it's really disappointing.

308
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,245
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess you don't really get that much benefit from it nowadays.

309
00:22:48,805 --> 00:22:48,965
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

310
00:22:50,826 --> 00:22:51,126
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

311
00:22:51,146 --> 00:22:53,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got two slots to put graphics cards.

312
00:22:53,068 --> 00:22:55,049
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost feel obligated to get two more.

313
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Brad from PodCulture in chat says, Sky, I didn't know it was on sale.

314
00:23:00,032 --> 00:23:00,952
[SPEAKER_05]: You just sold me on it.

315
00:23:00,972 --> 00:23:01,372
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

316
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:04,814
[SPEAKER_05]: When you write NCSoft, put As Heard on OLR.

317
00:23:06,696 --> 00:23:07,236
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but that's great.

318
00:23:07,296 --> 00:23:12,139
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but I think the logic is fine because $20 for the three-game series and no monthly fee.

319
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:13,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's a pretty darn good deal.

320
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,281
[SPEAKER_05]: And Guild Wars isn't a bad game by any means.

321
00:23:16,382 --> 00:23:26,915
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you'll play it forever, but I think you'll kind of go, you know, it's one of those games that would be like, you know, I'm kind of bored of WoW and Star Trek and Final Fantasy and all the other MMOs I'm playing right now.

322
00:23:26,935 --> 00:23:28,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just fire up Guild Wars for the hell.

323
00:23:28,997 --> 00:23:30,579
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell's going on in Guild Wars these days?

324
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,342
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of how I've found it.

325
00:23:32,462 --> 00:23:34,064
[SPEAKER_05]: I've played it on and off for the past five years.

326
00:23:34,775 --> 00:23:36,276
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyhow, enough of our gaming weeks.

327
00:23:36,677 --> 00:23:39,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on and get into some housekeeping tonight.

328
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:42,842
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a lot except for I might not be here Memorial Day weekend.

329
00:23:43,343 --> 00:23:53,012
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like I might be taking a trip, so we might not have a show then, or I don't know if we'll do a pre-taped or something, but that's the first time I'm also telling Jamie and Loki because I didn't think of it earlier.

330
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:55,273
[SPEAKER_05]: When?

331
00:23:55,854 --> 00:23:56,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Memorial Day weekend.

332
00:23:57,115 --> 00:23:57,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's right.

333
00:23:57,675 --> 00:23:58,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Three-day weekend.

334
00:23:58,415 --> 00:24:01,778
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you guys want to get away, I'm planning a trip, it looks like.

335
00:24:01,878 --> 00:24:03,018
[SPEAKER_05]: So I probably won't be here.

336
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:04,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Have fun.

337
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:04,499
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

338
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:05,720
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

339
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,282
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to be an extravagant trip, but just a little getaway.

340
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:10,303
[SPEAKER_05]: A little getaway.

341
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:15,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, more to come on that in the upcoming weeks, though.

342
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:17,147
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll let you know for sure what's going to happen.

343
00:24:17,227 --> 00:24:22,149
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Memorial Day weekend, which I imagine a lot of our listeners, a lot of them are probably going out of town and what have you, too.

344
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:29,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, also our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and our Facebook, of course, is available, too, at Orange Lounge Radio.

345
00:24:29,672 --> 00:24:30,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Join us there.

346
00:24:30,313 --> 00:24:30,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Friend us.

347
00:24:31,433 --> 00:24:32,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Like our posts.

348
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:32,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Share us.

349
00:24:32,854 --> 00:24:35,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Help us spread the word because we don't really have advertising dollars.

350
00:24:35,615 --> 00:24:39,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Another place where we could really use help, iTunes and five-star reviews on iTunes are

351
00:24:39,677 --> 00:24:43,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Just look up Orange Lounge Radio in the iTunes store and say a couple nice words about Orange Lounge Radio.

352
00:24:43,861 --> 00:24:45,202
[SPEAKER_05]: We really appreciate it.

353
00:24:45,242 --> 00:24:51,968
[SPEAKER_05]: It really does go a long way because the more positive reviews you get, the higher you go up in the rankings and you get a little more visibility and it works.

354
00:24:52,228 --> 00:24:56,972
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why a lot of podcasts you listen to want to get the reviews in iTunes because sometimes it's hard to stand out amongst the crowd.

355
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,395
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll tell you what, it's tough when you have, you know,

356
00:24:59,935 --> 00:25:11,359
[SPEAKER_05]: and IG4 and IGN and GameSpot and all these companies with limitless amounts of dollars and budget to pour into advertising and get people and so forth.

357
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:15,680
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sometimes hard to stand out amongst that, so we rely on the OL Army to help us out.

358
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,281
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's actually get into some gaming news.

359
00:25:18,361 --> 00:25:23,702
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have to actually put down the guacamole for a little bit, step away from the vegetables and get into some actual gaming news.

360
00:25:24,263 --> 00:25:25,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, start us off tonight.

361
00:25:25,623 --> 00:25:26,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2

362
00:25:53,962 --> 00:25:54,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-oh.

363
00:25:54,102 --> 00:25:54,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-oh.

364
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,471
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

365
00:26:31,747 --> 00:26:37,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to Quick Launch and choose the trial game of choice to play it as a full version.

366
00:26:37,731 --> 00:26:46,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, this doesn't work on all games yet, and there's really just a small list that they have so far that it works with, but, I mean, hey, might as well try it on whatever.

367
00:26:47,118 --> 00:27:02,292
[SPEAKER_06]: some of the games that have been shown to work with it so far Fatal Fury Special, Metal Slug 3, Samurai Shodown 2 and Metal Slug 7 all those of course being published by SNK so maybe other SNK games might work as well

368
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:14,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, apparently also there might be the King of Fighters 98 Ultimate Match and Garou, Mark of Wolves might play on it.

369
00:27:14,844 --> 00:27:16,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, break this down for me.

370
00:27:16,406 --> 00:27:20,732
[SPEAKER_05]: How smart do I have to be with my hacking, cracking sense to get this to work?

371
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:22,393
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

372
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:53,600
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a huge flop.

373
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,701
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can earn achievements on those games as well.

374
00:27:56,582 --> 00:27:57,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh.

375
00:27:58,063 --> 00:28:02,045
[SPEAKER_06]: I would imagine it's going to get patched out at some point, but might as well enjoy it while it lasts.

376
00:28:02,065 --> 00:28:07,107
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to introduce something new here on Orange Lounge Radio called the Dup Factor.

377
00:28:07,248 --> 00:28:09,109
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, the Dup Factor.

378
00:28:13,308 --> 00:28:16,969
[SPEAKER_05]: and the Dup Factor would be Days Until the Patch.

379
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,750
[SPEAKER_05]: D-U-P, Days Until Patch.

380
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:22,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what do you believe is the Dup Factor?

381
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:29,694
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure because I don't think this is... This hasn't been published on major blog sites or anything like that.

382
00:28:30,014 --> 00:28:33,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually when it does hit those... Good thing no one listens to this show.

383
00:28:33,456 --> 00:28:34,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a good thing.

384
00:28:34,736 --> 00:29:02,923
[SPEAKER_06]: you know once that happens they'll be like because obviously Microsoft doesn't read every forum out there so it's hard to say but yeah so that's interesting and if you don't happen to have Mario Warfare 2 that's okay because there's other glitches that also involve the 9199 dashboard as well a couple of the games were also found to be working as full Xbox Live Arcade games as well

385
00:29:04,103 --> 00:29:05,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

386
00:29:31,175 --> 00:29:45,895
[SPEAKER_06]: and apparently Family Game Night has something else that works like that as well but I'm not sure what's involved with that one but it's just interesting to see that a lot of these glitches are out there

387
00:29:46,736 --> 00:29:48,598
[SPEAKER_05]: I put the DUP factor at seven days.

388
00:29:49,118 --> 00:29:50,960
[SPEAKER_05]: I say by this time next week, it's out.

389
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think the... Let me put it this way, okay?

390
00:29:54,303 --> 00:29:56,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Red alarms are going off at Microsoft as we speak.

391
00:29:56,865 --> 00:29:57,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me put it this way.

392
00:29:58,527 --> 00:30:00,088
[SPEAKER_06]: I just found out about it this week.

393
00:30:00,348 --> 00:30:06,394
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been posted for about three weeks now, so... Has anyone... What was the last posting date?

394
00:30:07,134 --> 00:30:07,815
[SPEAKER_06]: The 22nd.

395
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:09,757
[SPEAKER_09]: So it may already...

396
00:30:11,574 --> 00:30:13,216
[SPEAKER_05]: No, nothing's.

397
00:30:13,656 --> 00:30:16,698
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think somebody would have said something in that little thread he's looking at if that's the case.

398
00:30:17,379 --> 00:30:21,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Or we would have seen a patch on the dashboard or we would have seen a patch for Call of Duty.

399
00:30:21,683 --> 00:30:22,703
[SPEAKER_05]: But I see seven days.

400
00:30:24,245 --> 00:30:24,465
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

401
00:30:24,778 --> 00:30:25,358
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we'll see.

402
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:26,279
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

403
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:31,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, Loki, I'm sure you would not be taking advantage of a patch like this.

404
00:30:31,601 --> 00:30:33,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you have, it's only for journalistic purposes.

405
00:30:35,023 --> 00:30:35,804
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really care.

406
00:30:36,644 --> 00:30:40,006
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly... Yeah, it's just the SNK games, I mean.

407
00:30:40,226 --> 00:30:43,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and dude, I have a JTAG console.

408
00:30:43,747 --> 00:30:44,828
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need this crap.

409
00:30:45,088 --> 00:30:45,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously.

410
00:30:47,342 --> 00:30:48,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Red Steel 2 Not Doing So Hot

411
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:19,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they were saying it wasn't doing hot, but that's because they only have data from like, you know, what, 10 days?

412
00:31:19,971 --> 00:31:21,373
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, not that long.

413
00:31:21,761 --> 00:31:25,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, apparently the game is going to support the Wii Vitality Sensor.

414
00:31:26,183 --> 00:31:26,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.

415
00:31:27,003 --> 00:31:27,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Fail!

416
00:31:29,084 --> 00:31:29,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Right there.

417
00:31:30,004 --> 00:31:30,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Fail.

418
00:31:30,785 --> 00:31:31,325
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

419
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,426
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be awful.

420
00:31:33,806 --> 00:31:34,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely awful.

421
00:31:36,007 --> 00:31:36,927
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the point of that?

422
00:31:37,907 --> 00:31:39,508
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you going to control the game now?

423
00:31:39,568 --> 00:31:43,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you're going to have... Where are you going to plug the nunchuck into?

424
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:47,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless they're going to come up with some sort of splitter or something like that for the Wii Remote.

425
00:31:48,111 --> 00:31:49,752
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't see how this is going to work.

426
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:53,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know either.

427
00:31:53,635 --> 00:31:55,717
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't write the news, I just report it, just so you know.

428
00:31:56,358 --> 00:31:56,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Fail.

429
00:31:57,459 --> 00:31:58,320
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I gotta say.

430
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:04,306
[SPEAKER_05]: I was looking for a clip of the old school DDR failed noise to play behind that.

431
00:32:05,788 --> 00:32:07,269
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a couple other things I wanted to say about this.

432
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:10,192
[SPEAKER_05]: It's supposed to, I guess...

433
00:32:11,093 --> 00:32:15,455
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just part of, you know, if you think about it, Red Steel 2 supported the Motion Plus.

434
00:32:16,015 --> 00:32:18,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Red Steel was kind of a launch title for the Wii.

435
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:25,880
[SPEAKER_05]: It would not be a surprise if this supports the Vitality Sensor because it's just yet another add-on of Nintendo's that Ubisoft is supporting.

436
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:30,602
[SPEAKER_05]: The only one that Red Steel really didn't get on was the balance board, to be honest.

437
00:32:32,975 --> 00:32:34,296
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there you go.

438
00:32:34,376 --> 00:32:40,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though Loki's not a big fan of it, apparently Red Steel 3 with vitality sensors... The vitality sensor is retarded.

439
00:32:40,622 --> 00:32:41,202
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

440
00:32:41,362 --> 00:32:43,004
[SPEAKER_06]: It's absolutely retarded.

441
00:32:43,584 --> 00:32:51,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it'll be wonderful for the Wii Relax game that comes out and people will buy it because it's like, oh, look, you can relax now, now that Nintendo's helping you.

442
00:32:51,431 --> 00:32:52,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold up, hold on.

443
00:32:52,692 --> 00:32:54,354
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you really know yet, though?

444
00:32:54,554 --> 00:32:56,996
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, all you've really heard about this is a concept.

445
00:32:57,036 --> 00:32:58,658
[SPEAKER_05]: You haven't seen it in motion yet.

446
00:32:59,523 --> 00:33:00,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it'll be neat.

447
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:28,810
[SPEAKER_09]: This is someone who gets a blood test twice a year and has her blood pressure checked regularly.

448
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but is it fun?

449
00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:33,051
[SPEAKER_09]: If it keeps me alive.

450
00:33:34,072 --> 00:33:35,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I don't consider that fun.

451
00:33:37,132 --> 00:33:42,454
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to have four MRIs a couple years ago to keep me alive, but I wasn't exactly like, gosh, I wish I had one of these at home.

452
00:33:42,774 --> 00:33:43,294
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of fun.

453
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:44,574
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a colonoscopy.

454
00:33:44,754 --> 00:33:47,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, that helps you stay alive, but I don't think it's fun.

455
00:33:47,515 --> 00:33:48,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people get off on that.

456
00:33:48,795 --> 00:33:50,496
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii virtual colon sensor.

457
00:33:54,136 --> 00:33:56,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks God for when the Human Centipede video game comes out.

458
00:33:57,522 --> 00:34:06,359
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying though that fun aside, they'll be illegitimate.

459
00:34:07,802 --> 00:34:14,946
[SPEAKER_06]: And they did say there was like a subtitle at least on the human centipede that it makes it seem like it's going to be one of a series.

460
00:34:15,026 --> 00:34:21,989
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm like... That discussion on that movie has gotten far too much airtime on the All News Network.

461
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:25,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on to some more video game stories.

462
00:34:26,011 --> 00:34:28,012
[SPEAKER_09]: I was actually putting something up for you, Rob.

463
00:34:28,253 --> 00:34:28,633
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

464
00:34:29,193 --> 00:34:29,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Come and look at it.

465
00:34:30,033 --> 00:34:30,754
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't even see it.

466
00:34:30,814 --> 00:34:32,095
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to link it to the chat room too.

467
00:34:32,115 --> 00:34:32,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that Gaia?

468
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:39,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes it is, but so they put up an item called Starmony that's a little rainbow unicorn that says open your eyes.

469
00:34:40,638 --> 00:34:42,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's the rainbow unicorn fan, not me.

470
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:45,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's the one that always play in the rainbow unicorn game?

471
00:34:45,999 --> 00:34:46,580
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be Loki.

472
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,480
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be Loki.

473
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,100
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to put that on his wall.

474
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,521
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to post it on my Facebook later.

475
00:34:52,161 --> 00:34:53,222
[SPEAKER_09]: But I thought it was funny.

476
00:34:53,422 --> 00:34:53,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

477
00:34:55,057 --> 00:34:56,038
[SPEAKER_09]: So, how about a story?

478
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:58,241
[SPEAKER_09]: How about something about Guitar Hero?

479
00:35:12,797 --> 00:35:16,699
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess, but aren't most of their songs in, like, rock band or guitar here already?

480
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:20,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I think, isn't the whole Blood Sugar Sex Magic album on rock band, right?

481
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:27,864
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that it's supposed to also have an exclusive for their new album.

482
00:35:29,225 --> 00:35:29,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

483
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:37,647
[SPEAKER_09]: That's at least the speculation, but then again, you can get the whole thing of Blood Sugar Sex Magic on Rock Band.

484
00:35:39,068 --> 00:35:41,991
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were much more than one album.

485
00:35:42,031 --> 00:35:42,592
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they are...

486
00:35:45,069 --> 00:35:48,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been listening to their stuff since George Clinton produced them.

487
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:51,733
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, P-Funk, Parliament.

488
00:35:52,374 --> 00:35:53,674
[SPEAKER_09]: They gotta be like in their 50s by now, right?

489
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:54,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Multicolored Dreads.

490
00:35:55,055 --> 00:35:55,315
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

491
00:35:55,676 --> 00:35:56,376
[SPEAKER_05]: They're getting there.

492
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:57,837
[SPEAKER_05]: They gotta be older.

493
00:35:58,057 --> 00:35:59,778
[SPEAKER_09]: They gotta... I think the...

494
00:36:00,819 --> 00:36:03,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Red Hot Chili Peppers is far more expansive than Green Day.

495
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:37,025
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree to an extent, yeah.

496
00:36:37,045 --> 00:36:39,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a good choice for their own video game.

497
00:36:39,888 --> 00:36:41,149
[SPEAKER_05]: I would look at it.

498
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:48,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I'd pay $50 for it, but I'd look at it and I'd go, oh, neat, I like these songs.

499
00:36:49,297 --> 00:36:49,918
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see, though.

500
00:36:50,038 --> 00:36:50,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

501
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:54,482
[SPEAKER_05]: See, but then there's that part of me that goes, I don't know, Guitar Hero Van Halen was kind of poop.

502
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they're better off sticking with Rock Band.

503
00:36:59,562 --> 00:37:01,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Just putting out more content for Rock Band.

504
00:37:02,964 --> 00:37:03,344
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

505
00:37:04,885 --> 00:37:08,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm just like, because I thought they were supposed to be cutting back.

506
00:37:09,087 --> 00:37:13,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess they sort of have cut back on Guitar Hero a little bit because we haven't had a game in like six months.

507
00:37:13,589 --> 00:37:14,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not six months, four months.

508
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:15,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, six months.

509
00:37:16,711 --> 00:37:17,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that counting like DS versions and all that?

510
00:37:17,892 --> 00:37:18,372
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, I take them back.

511
00:37:18,452 --> 00:37:18,832
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

512
00:37:18,892 --> 00:37:20,053
[SPEAKER_06]: I take them back about four months.

513
00:37:21,744 --> 00:37:23,765
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, it does count DS versions and whatnot.

514
00:37:24,726 --> 00:37:30,129
[SPEAKER_06]: And nothing I've seen on the horizon yet until like fall, which is good.

515
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:34,291
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's a rumor that's kind of interesting.

516
00:37:35,332 --> 00:37:42,516
[SPEAKER_06]: We may have talked about it a little bit before when it was discovered as a trademark from Konami, Harmony of Despair.

517
00:37:42,936 --> 00:37:46,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, a trusted source, as Joystick puts it,

518
00:37:47,078 --> 00:37:53,780
[SPEAKER_06]: It says that Harmony of Despair is a 2D, 6-player, Xbox Live Arcade game.

519
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,661
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll get to play as some of the old characters, or I guess main characters from a bunch of different games.

520
00:37:59,081 --> 00:38:06,463
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's supposed to kind of appear like the Game Boy Advance or DS versions of the game.

521
00:38:06,483 --> 00:38:09,404
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess like, you know, Super NES type thing.

522
00:38:10,124 --> 00:38:18,468
[SPEAKER_06]: and you'll get to play with a bunch of people at the same time and they'll actually be able to zoom out to show where everyone's at and stuff like that.

523
00:38:18,508 --> 00:38:21,549
[SPEAKER_06]: So six player co-op Castlevania sounds kind of fun actually.

524
00:38:21,909 --> 00:38:24,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like God has finally listened to me.

525
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:26,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

526
00:38:26,491 --> 00:38:27,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you Jesus.

527
00:38:28,732 --> 00:38:31,974
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what I've been asking for for how long now on this program.

528
00:38:32,314 --> 00:38:43,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me a old school 2D New Castlevania game on my television and this sounds sweet that it's going to be like six players zooming in and out co-op stuff sounds kind of rad actually.

529
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds way better than Judgment.

530
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:52,145
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when you're done with this Nintendo give us a new Metroid like this and then when you're done with this Konami you can come back and give me a new Contra like this.

531
00:38:53,426 --> 00:38:54,246
[SPEAKER_06]: No Frogger.

532
00:38:54,606 --> 00:38:57,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not want Frogger with six people.

533
00:38:59,744 --> 00:39:01,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless it's an extreme frogger.

534
00:39:02,265 --> 00:39:04,426
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta admit though, this sounds very awesome.

535
00:39:04,446 --> 00:39:07,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you imagine being able to explore the castle with multiple people at the same time?

536
00:39:08,147 --> 00:39:08,868
[SPEAKER_05]: But how would that work?

537
00:39:08,908 --> 00:39:16,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's gonna have to be some type of random castle generator element to it or something or else it's always gonna be the same damn game.

538
00:39:18,612 --> 00:39:22,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, this is a very early type of story, and it's also rumor, right?

539
00:39:22,274 --> 00:39:22,815
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not confirmed.

540
00:39:22,835 --> 00:39:28,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's rumor right now, but maybe they're going to have multiple castles or something like that, or you'll be able to download extra castles later.

541
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:29,960
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I hope it's at E3.

542
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,081
[SPEAKER_05]: I really want more information on this soon.

543
00:39:32,642 --> 00:39:33,302
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds great.

544
00:39:34,883 --> 00:39:37,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe that partner net site will leak everything like it always does.

545
00:39:37,745 --> 00:39:38,566
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be wonderful, too.

546
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:39,852
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see you next time.

547
00:39:51,687 --> 00:39:54,028
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

548
00:40:16,212 --> 00:40:22,082
[SPEAKER_05]: AmazeSatsuma in our chatroom chat.orangehauntradio.com says, I'd be fine with a six-player Frogger if I could play as a truck.

549
00:40:23,724 --> 00:40:24,786
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be awesome.

550
00:40:24,826 --> 00:40:25,868
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to play as a gator.

551
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:27,350
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like Frogger versus.

552
00:40:28,352 --> 00:40:30,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember in Pac-Man versus you could be the ghost?

553
00:40:32,381 --> 00:40:34,163
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be amazingly fun.

554
00:40:34,804 --> 00:40:38,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Total side note, but it's not on our show roll, but I think this chat room comment is worth reading.

555
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:42,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Spyro in our chat says, is there no more game room games being released now?

556
00:40:43,014 --> 00:40:46,378
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they were supposed to put out like Pitfall and...

557
00:40:48,480 --> 00:41:15,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Breakout I think were some of the big games this week and it got halted the release just didn't end up happening and there was actually a tweet over on god I can't believe I'm using Twitter but the thing is Game Room did not have much of a good website behind it I mean I guess they have an official website but it kind of sucks they don't have the greatest web presence I don't know this thing was kind of set up to fail from the beginning but on their Twitter which is at Live Game Room they say

558
00:41:16,844 --> 00:41:21,371
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, they broke the news by retweeting Major Nelson.

559
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:25,681
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

560
00:41:27,242 --> 00:41:29,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Professional radio.

561
00:41:30,044 --> 00:41:37,169
[SPEAKER_05]: They broke the news by retweeting Major Nelson saying, We're working to bring you additional Game Room titles as soon as possible.

562
00:41:37,249 --> 00:41:39,510
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let you know the moment I have more details.

563
00:41:40,191 --> 00:41:45,995
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they sent an app message to somebody saying, There was a delay in the game pack release.

564
00:41:46,115 --> 00:41:47,696
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll update when we've got more details.

565
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:48,136
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

566
00:41:49,177 --> 00:41:50,638
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, fail.

567
00:41:50,898 --> 00:41:51,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Fail, fail, fail.

568
00:41:53,099 --> 00:42:11,670
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of regret a couple weeks ago when I was reviewing Game Room on the show I said hey this is going to be better than Virtual Console because at least you know although it has plenty of room for improvement it's more than just straight up ports of the games well I mean at least games are coming out for Virtual Console

569
00:42:13,075 --> 00:42:25,182
[SPEAKER_05]: It irritates me because there was so much potential here that they have just crashed and burned with.

570
00:42:25,722 --> 00:42:27,143
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so frustrating.

571
00:42:27,463 --> 00:42:29,624
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an awesome idea.

572
00:42:30,304 --> 00:42:42,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they should have integrated it with different Xbox Live Arcade games, so it wouldn't matter that they're not putting out any because you could still use your Xbox Live Arcade games and have them in your arcade and whatnot.

573
00:42:43,942 --> 00:42:44,964
[SPEAKER_05]: And then here's the thing.

574
00:42:45,404 --> 00:42:51,353
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Matt says, Seriously, Game Room was supposed to be Microsoft's answer to Home, but it's just as much of a failure as Home.

575
00:42:51,413 --> 00:42:52,275
[SPEAKER_05]: So far, that is.

576
00:42:54,157 --> 00:42:56,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I'm okay with the Game Room to Home comparisons.

577
00:42:57,422 --> 00:42:59,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people assumed...

578
00:43:00,046 --> 00:43:05,910
[SPEAKER_05]: It was going to be like home because you would be able to navigate around in the first person, which was, I don't think, ever the case.

579
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:10,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Microsoft's always kind of strung you along with the, well, maybe we'll implement that someday.

580
00:43:10,673 --> 00:43:14,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, you can't even fucking release a new pack for the game on time.

581
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:18,959
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not going to have the full first person movement around like home ever.

582
00:43:19,979 --> 00:43:20,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Ever.

583
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Prove me wrong, please.

584
00:43:23,931 --> 00:43:40,328
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just irritated because the problem is if this fails which it's starting to look more and more like it's going to and how fucking disappointing is that that we're never going to get any more packs for this game at the rate we're going you know whatever happened to like the thousand games if this thing fails we're not going to see anything like it

585
00:43:41,249 --> 00:43:42,950
[SPEAKER_05]: until maybe the next generation.

586
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:43,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

587
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:56,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe on Nintendo's Wii HD or whatever console they do after the Wii, maybe they will finally say, okay, you can play the old NES games over the internet after you re-buy them for five bucks a piece.

588
00:43:58,835 --> 00:43:59,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Just irritates me.

589
00:44:01,436 --> 00:44:01,976
[SPEAKER_05]: I am mad.

590
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:04,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

591
00:44:05,047 --> 00:44:05,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob?

592
00:44:05,687 --> 00:44:05,867
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

593
00:44:06,168 --> 00:44:06,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Deep breaths.

594
00:44:06,888 --> 00:44:08,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, it's just frustrating.

595
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:15,434
[SPEAKER_05]: As a retro game fan, you know, I was really excited about a lot that Game Room had to bring, and it didn't really suck.

596
00:44:15,494 --> 00:44:16,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there was a lot of promise with it.

597
00:44:17,015 --> 00:44:19,177
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, yeah, they could have had a little more, but...

598
00:44:21,761 --> 00:44:24,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully I'm just overreacting and this is all fixed in a week.

599
00:44:24,522 --> 00:44:26,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, maybe they had problems with the whole PC.

600
00:44:26,963 --> 00:44:32,705
[SPEAKER_05]: And I heard people were able to hack certain games in Game Room, like a lot of the high scores on Asteroids were faked.

601
00:44:33,105 --> 00:44:35,366
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe for quality purposes they pulled it back.

602
00:44:35,646 --> 00:44:43,749
[SPEAKER_05]: But when I hear about these layoffs, when I see crappy web support for this, my hope fades more and more.

603
00:44:44,369 --> 00:44:46,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a feeling that there's going to be all sorts of...

604
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:58,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Exploits with it because it's in file form and people have modded consoles and they're gonna hex edit crap so that they can cheat in the games and it's gonna screw up the leaderboards and

605
00:45:00,185 --> 00:45:01,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Prove me wrong, Microsoft, please.

606
00:45:01,906 --> 00:45:02,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.

607
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:04,207
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to get proven wrong on this.

608
00:45:04,307 --> 00:45:05,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, other news.

609
00:45:06,047 --> 00:45:09,208
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 3, and here's something else to rage about.

610
00:45:11,549 --> 00:45:16,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, we reported a couple weeks ago on the show, and I'm sure you read about it everywhere on the internet, or you saw this firsthand.

611
00:45:16,731 --> 00:45:19,992
[SPEAKER_05]: They took out the other OS feature on the PlayStation 3.

612
00:45:20,612 --> 00:45:21,173
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

613
00:45:36,009 --> 00:45:36,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody sued.

614
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:41,311
[SPEAKER_05]: A class action lawsuit for removing the PlayStation 3 support for other OSs.

615
00:45:41,992 --> 00:45:45,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Anthony Ventura is the lawsuit filer's name.

616
00:45:45,513 --> 00:45:46,234
[SPEAKER_05]: The plaintiff.

617
00:45:47,154 --> 00:45:47,914
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a plaintiff.

618
00:45:48,695 --> 00:45:56,358
[SPEAKER_05]: He filed a class action lawsuit against the company saying that it's a breach of contract, false advertising, and you know all this other big legal words.

619
00:45:56,698 --> 00:45:57,679
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

620
00:46:19,216 --> 00:46:23,257
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it'll work, but it's interesting that somebody's actually filed a lawsuit over this.

621
00:46:24,138 --> 00:46:27,799
[SPEAKER_05]: As I suspected somebody probably would in this too happy nation that we're in.

622
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:29,499
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

623
00:46:29,539 --> 00:46:31,160
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you guys think will happen with this lawsuit?

624
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:32,200
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

625
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:35,401
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be interesting to see how it plays out.

626
00:46:36,622 --> 00:46:42,564
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm interested because I have a system that hasn't been updated yet and I'm not planning on updating it because guess what?

627
00:46:42,584 --> 00:46:46,385
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't bought any new games for it since LittleBigPlanet.

628
00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:53,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the biggest kicker here is are they going to be able to prove that this was an advertised feature?

629
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,010
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be tough.

630
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:56,651
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think they're going to be able to get away with it.

631
00:46:56,711 --> 00:46:58,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe in other countries, but not here.

632
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember that being advertised.

633
00:46:59,612 --> 00:47:04,274
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not on a commercial or something, but they did advertise it coming out of E3 and that kind of stuff.

634
00:47:05,294 --> 00:47:08,415
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was a feature, and it's in the console.

635
00:47:08,455 --> 00:47:12,397
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like, you know, people didn't know it was there, but...

636
00:47:13,257 --> 00:47:15,258
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think it's kind of messed up.

637
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:20,522
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the whole kind of conspiracy part of it, or I guess paranoia part of it.

638
00:47:20,882 --> 00:47:29,929
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like if they're going to take this out because some hacker or whatever found a way around their copy protection and stuff, which didn't really happen.

639
00:47:30,029 --> 00:47:37,514
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think anyone's actually found a way around their copy protection yet, other than the fact that they're starting to mess around with Linux, but...

640
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:39,727
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised they haven't.

641
00:48:01,684 --> 00:48:02,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

642
00:48:02,424 --> 00:48:09,287
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's just say, for example, that they decide later on, hey, you know what, we're going to start selling PlayStation 2 games on the PlayStation Network.

643
00:48:09,787 --> 00:48:12,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we're going to remove your backwards compatibility so you can buy those games from us.

644
00:48:13,389 --> 00:48:13,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Again.

645
00:48:15,169 --> 00:48:15,950
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be kind of shady.

646
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:21,132
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you want to play your PlayStation 2 games, you can go buy one of our $99.99 PlayStation 2 Slim systems.

647
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:29,102
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, let me play devil's advocate for a minute here.

648
00:48:29,282 --> 00:48:32,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Ranma says, forget the lawsuit, people.

649
00:48:32,525 --> 00:48:34,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Just trade in your PS3s for something worthwhile.

650
00:48:35,507 --> 00:48:42,112
[SPEAKER_05]: That chat coming from chat.orange.radio.com Well, I mean, to play devil's advocate, you never could install Linux on a 360.

651
00:48:43,193 --> 00:48:44,394
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't even get the web on your 360.

652
00:48:44,434 --> 00:48:44,594
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

653
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:53,693
[SPEAKER_05]: You can now, but... Well, without... Legitimately, none of these features are possible.

654
00:48:53,753 --> 00:48:58,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can still get the other OS feature on your PlayStation 3, too, if you know where to look.

655
00:48:59,075 --> 00:48:59,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

656
00:49:02,756 --> 00:49:04,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's being worked on or something, something.

657
00:49:05,117 --> 00:49:05,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

658
00:49:07,497 --> 00:49:08,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I guess we'll see what develops with this.

659
00:49:09,018 --> 00:49:15,860
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be very interesting, though, because you know what happens is that if this guy wins, you'll all be able to get a check in the mail for like five whole dollars.

660
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's what happens with class action lawsuits.

661
00:49:19,221 --> 00:49:21,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe they'll have to give out a free game or something.

662
00:49:21,182 --> 00:49:21,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

663
00:49:21,722 --> 00:49:22,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, that'd be nice.

664
00:49:22,842 --> 00:49:26,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I mean, what if that free game is like Yaris 2 for the PS3 or something?

665
00:49:26,984 --> 00:49:29,184
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it doesn't have to be a good game.

666
00:49:30,185 --> 00:49:30,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Freeze free?

667
00:49:30,945 --> 00:49:31,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

668
00:49:31,746 --> 00:49:32,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

669
00:49:33,288 --> 00:49:36,113
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some things that you couldn't even pay me to play for free.

670
00:49:36,493 --> 00:49:37,495
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like bad.

671
00:49:37,855 --> 00:49:38,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's move on.

672
00:49:38,837 --> 00:49:39,678
[SPEAKER_05]: More gaming news, DarkSakura.

673
00:49:39,698 --> 00:49:40,560
[SPEAKER_04]: How about something happier?

674
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:40,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

675
00:49:41,201 --> 00:49:42,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy, happy, joy, joy.

676
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:42,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Cub Scouts!

677
00:49:43,445 --> 00:49:44,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you said happier.

678
00:49:44,631 --> 00:49:48,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, okay, I know, little Mormons in training.

679
00:49:48,954 --> 00:49:49,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I didn't say that.

680
00:49:50,355 --> 00:49:51,556
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in the Cub Scouts for a year.

681
00:49:52,136 --> 00:49:52,536
[SPEAKER_06]: One whole year.

682
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:56,859
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in the Cub Scouts and the Boy Scouts and I never became a Mormon.

683
00:49:57,639 --> 00:50:01,402
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I just learned how to set fire to things and tie knots.

684
00:50:02,182 --> 00:50:03,263
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot the knots part.

685
00:50:03,683 --> 00:50:06,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, if only they knew I was a gay in training.

686
00:50:06,445 --> 00:50:07,366
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so awesome though.

687
00:50:07,386 --> 00:50:14,529
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously, if you want to have fun in the Boy Scouts or something like that, just buy the damn manual, give it to your kid, have them read through it.

688
00:50:14,569 --> 00:50:15,850
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all the information you need.

689
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:18,891
[SPEAKER_06]: The rest is just camping trips and Pinewood Car Derby.

690
00:50:19,111 --> 00:50:20,092
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all it really is.

691
00:50:22,613 --> 00:50:24,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Although we built a catapult one time and that was awesome.

692
00:50:25,962 --> 00:50:29,184
[SPEAKER_05]: I love how DarkSakura's like, I swear to God, I have news to report.

693
00:50:29,204 --> 00:50:32,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Will you boys stop reminiscing about your stupid scout troops?

694
00:50:33,767 --> 00:50:35,308
[SPEAKER_05]: We build wooden cars, just so you know.

695
00:50:35,468 --> 00:50:35,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, hi.

696
00:50:36,749 --> 00:50:43,234
[SPEAKER_09]: So, for the Cub Scouts, there's a new badge available.

697
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:47,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, belt loop, or whatever the crap that means.

698
00:50:48,497 --> 00:50:53,120
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get a video game belt loop, I guess.

699
00:50:54,261 --> 00:50:55,202
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't get a belt loop.

700
00:50:55,962 --> 00:50:58,123
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember them having belt loops.

701
00:50:58,143 --> 00:50:59,004
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember the badges.

702
00:50:59,204 --> 00:51:00,124
[SPEAKER_05]: The badges I remember, yeah.

703
00:51:00,144 --> 00:51:02,606
[SPEAKER_05]: They usually get sewed on and then there was the little patches.

704
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:03,846
[SPEAKER_05]: There were patches and there were badges.

705
00:51:04,266 --> 00:51:05,867
[SPEAKER_05]: So now they have belt loops too, whatever.

706
00:51:06,147 --> 00:51:07,028
[SPEAKER_05]: They get more bling.

707
00:51:07,168 --> 00:51:08,609
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pins back in my day.

708
00:51:09,389 --> 00:51:10,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what I meant.

709
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:10,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Pins.

710
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:11,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

711
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:22,936
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember they would flip the kid upside down and put the pin on when the kid was upside down and then when you actually did whatever, your parents could turn it right side up as if you weren't capable of just doing it yourself.

712
00:51:23,976 --> 00:51:24,877
[SPEAKER_05]: If you did, you'd go to hell.

713
00:51:27,031 --> 00:51:27,752
[SPEAKER_06]: You make John Smith cry.

714
00:51:39,313 --> 00:51:41,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I'm going to... Can I tell you a true story?

715
00:51:41,195 --> 00:51:41,935
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, DarkSakura.

716
00:51:41,955 --> 00:51:43,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you have a legitimate gaming story here.

717
00:51:43,777 --> 00:51:44,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, guess what?

718
00:51:44,598 --> 00:51:44,818
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

719
00:51:45,178 --> 00:51:46,539
[SPEAKER_05]: My mother... Carrot.

720
00:51:47,019 --> 00:51:48,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Pulled me out of Cub Scout.

721
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,301
[SPEAKER_05]: She didn't want me going anymore.

722
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:50,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you know why?

723
00:51:50,522 --> 00:51:51,043
[SPEAKER_05]: True story.

724
00:51:51,903 --> 00:51:53,505
[SPEAKER_05]: She didn't like the other kids in my troop.

725
00:51:53,785 --> 00:51:58,849
[SPEAKER_05]: She thought all the other kids in my troop... And ten years later, she told me this.

726
00:51:59,189 --> 00:52:02,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Quote, all the other little kids in your troop were little assholes.

727
00:52:05,294 --> 00:52:05,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I love your mom.

728
00:52:08,228 --> 00:52:30,912
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't want you hanging out with those assholes I love your mom So, Rob No offense meant to any scouts who might be listening to the show I'm just saying that, you know, the Roseville troop was a bunch of assholes, allegedly So, the whole way to get this video game belt loop You have to complete three tasks And I think this is actually a really positive thing

729
00:52:32,236 --> 00:52:32,796
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

730
00:52:54,444 --> 00:53:03,336
[SPEAKER_09]: You earn a pin by completing five of nine tasks, which would be... With your parents, create a plan to buy a video game that is right for your age group.

731
00:53:03,716 --> 00:53:04,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, that's hard.

732
00:53:06,145 --> 00:53:23,820
[SPEAKER_09]: compare two game systems and explain the differences between the two and good purchase or use of a game system play a video game with family members in a family tournament teach an adult or friend how to play a video game list at least five tips that would help someone who was learning how to play your favorite video game

733
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:49,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Play an appropriate video game with a friend for one hour Play a video game that will help practice math, spelling, or other skills that help you in your schoolwork Choose a game you might like to purchase and compare the price at three different stores Decide which one's the best deal Include factors like return policy and warranty And with an adult supervision, install a gaming system

734
00:53:51,378 --> 00:54:03,068
[SPEAKER_09]: um okay I think it's good because it's encouraging you know family time it could be good for parents to demystify video games

735
00:54:03,536 --> 00:54:04,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's not a bad thing.

736
00:54:04,897 --> 00:54:10,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know we're sitting here and teeing about it, but yeah, it's encouraging what should be happening in the first place.

737
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:14,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Parents and kids to talk about the kid's hobby.

738
00:54:15,722 --> 00:54:16,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Who would have thought?

739
00:54:16,382 --> 00:54:21,725
[SPEAKER_09]: When I was a kid, my papa and I, my dad's father, we used to sit around playing Jackal.

740
00:54:24,048 --> 00:54:30,299
[SPEAKER_09]: On Nintendo, on the big screen TV, which is a war game where you shoot people and run over them in a tank.

741
00:54:31,581 --> 00:54:33,524
[SPEAKER_09]: And we played, get this, Abadox.

742
00:54:34,997 --> 00:54:38,079
[SPEAKER_09]: That was supposed to be the most disgusting game at the time.

743
00:54:38,399 --> 00:54:39,660
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Abydox, for the record.

744
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:48,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I could imagine coming home from a Cub Scout meeting and telling my mom, Hey, Mom, I want to get this video game badge that they're giving away.

745
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:52,607
[SPEAKER_05]: So would you sit for me for an hour while I install a video game system and show you how to do it?

746
00:54:52,647 --> 00:54:55,429
[SPEAKER_05]: She'd just be like, Where's the paper that I just signed?

747
00:54:58,571 --> 00:55:01,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, also, they're...

748
00:55:06,488 --> 00:55:13,893
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that kind of also, you know, sort of discounts the fact that a lot of these parents might have grown up with video games, too.

749
00:55:14,914 --> 00:55:17,576
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, my mom and I used to play Tetris together.

750
00:55:18,957 --> 00:55:21,418
[SPEAKER_09]: And we used to play Super Mario Brothers and all kinds of games.

751
00:55:21,438 --> 00:55:27,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, stop trying to smack the fly with your pizza box.

752
00:55:28,003 --> 00:55:29,564
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a fly on the loose in the studio.

753
00:55:29,584 --> 00:55:30,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep in mind.

754
00:55:30,525 --> 00:55:31,586
[SPEAKER_05]: It flew outside, it flew outside.

755
00:55:32,006 --> 00:55:32,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep in mind.

756
00:55:32,646 --> 00:55:33,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Stay out.

757
00:55:33,287 --> 00:55:34,928
[SPEAKER_09]: In two days, it will be dead.

758
00:55:34,948 --> 00:55:35,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Dead.

759
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:37,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Not if I can help it.

760
00:55:38,758 --> 00:55:39,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Won't take that long.

761
00:55:40,019 --> 00:55:41,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Flies really don't live longer than a few days.

762
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,761
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the comfort I take in that they're going to die soon.

763
00:55:45,061 --> 00:55:47,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Tangent Lounge Radio, back to the Cub Scouts, please.

764
00:55:47,442 --> 00:55:47,803
[SPEAKER_09]: I have carrots.

765
00:55:48,863 --> 00:55:49,824
[SPEAKER_09]: They're delicious and raw.

766
00:55:49,884 --> 00:55:50,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Cub Scouts!

767
00:55:51,224 --> 00:55:52,065
[SPEAKER_09]: I said my piece.

768
00:55:52,565 --> 00:55:52,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

769
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:56,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Now if they wanted them to really earn the damn badge, they should program a game.

770
00:55:57,393 --> 00:55:58,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very disappointed.

771
00:55:58,214 --> 00:55:59,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's a programming badge.

772
00:56:00,536 --> 00:56:09,843
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very disappointed, though, that not one of those little, I guess, achievements or requirements on that list is go to arcade.

773
00:56:11,603 --> 00:56:13,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, because there are no arcades anymore.

774
00:56:13,166 --> 00:56:14,107
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a myth!

775
00:56:14,908 --> 00:56:17,431
[SPEAKER_05]: In some parts of the states, there are no arcades.

776
00:56:17,451 --> 00:56:18,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then, you know what?

777
00:56:18,413 --> 00:56:20,475
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't really want that badge now, do you?

778
00:56:21,877 --> 00:56:22,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing.

779
00:56:22,298 --> 00:56:27,886
[SPEAKER_05]: The only problem... I don't know if I want to even open this door and go there, but I live there.

780
00:56:28,987 --> 00:56:51,649
[SPEAKER_05]: The only problem I have with this badge, like I think it's a good thing and it's encouraging the family to talk, yada yada yada, is that this badge could go right next to your queer-hating badge because, you know, the Boy Scouts won't, you know the whole thing about how, you know, they won't let gay guys be scoutmasters and so forth because apparently all gay guys know how to do is molest kids.

781
00:56:52,592 --> 00:56:54,614
[SPEAKER_09]: They won't let them be scouts at all.

782
00:56:54,674 --> 00:57:01,622
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just... I think at that age, you're kind of too young to know anyway, so I think that argument's irrelevant.

783
00:57:01,822 --> 00:57:02,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, honestly.

784
00:57:03,203 --> 00:57:04,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, how old are Boy Scouts?

785
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:06,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, 12 to, like, 15?

786
00:57:07,347 --> 00:57:10,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you just... Here, everything is...

787
00:57:11,412 --> 00:57:12,913
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not even an issue at that age.

788
00:57:13,434 --> 00:57:14,936
[SPEAKER_05]: If it is an issue, you're too young.

789
00:57:15,677 --> 00:57:16,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't even think about that stuff.

790
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:24,827
[SPEAKER_05]: It does kind of irritate me that they don't really have a good reason for justifying why

791
00:57:25,988 --> 00:57:32,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why homos would want to be involved with such an organization that hates them, but if they do, they should, you know, get to do it.

792
00:57:32,692 --> 00:57:35,313
[SPEAKER_06]: My problem is, why is this even a badge in the first place?

793
00:57:35,333 --> 00:57:55,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I thought the Boy Scouts and Cub Scouts and whatever were all about kind of like the whole outdoors, you know, the woodsman, you know, type mentality where it's like learning how to kind of, not really necessarily survive, but there are survival tools in there as well and, you know, kind of, you know, how to be good, you know,

794
00:57:55,524 --> 00:57:56,685
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

795
00:58:15,894 --> 00:58:16,255
[SPEAKER_06]: VCR, TiVo Badge

796
00:58:33,366 --> 00:58:34,827
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you just have to know how to be a priest Oh

797
00:59:00,827 --> 00:59:02,930
[SPEAKER_05]: And if that joke offended you, guess what?

798
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:09,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you know how offended I get when I hear the rationalization for why gays can't be in Boy Scouts.

799
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:10,442
[SPEAKER_05]: And there you have it.

800
00:59:12,385 --> 00:59:14,328
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I offended people, but to teach a lesson.

801
00:59:15,805 --> 00:59:16,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you know how I feel.

802
00:59:17,266 --> 00:59:17,586
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

803
00:59:18,547 --> 00:59:19,207
[SPEAKER_05]: It is offensive.

804
00:59:19,448 --> 00:59:19,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

805
00:59:20,048 --> 00:59:20,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Release dates.

806
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:23,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to the U.S.

807
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:24,892
[SPEAKER_05]: and see what games are going to be coming out soon.

808
00:59:25,012 --> 00:59:25,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

809
00:59:25,632 --> 00:59:26,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Not much.

810
00:59:26,353 --> 00:59:32,917
[SPEAKER_06]: This week is pretty light, and it's sad that one of the biggest games this week is actually Iron Man 2.

811
00:59:32,997 --> 00:59:37,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, coming out on Friday in theaters.

812
00:59:37,801 --> 00:59:40,002
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to have your typical movie-tying game.

813
00:59:40,383 --> 00:59:40,903
[SPEAKER_06]: But don't worry.

814
00:59:40,963 --> 00:59:43,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Sega says that this game isn't crap like the last one.

815
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:50,307
[SPEAKER_06]: That's famous last words from people that make crappy ported or movie tie-in games.

816
00:59:51,849 --> 00:59:53,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Other fun stuff coming out this week.

817
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:54,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Picross 3D.

818
00:59:55,332 --> 00:59:58,054
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Picross, but it's in 3D form.

819
00:59:58,654 --> 01:00:00,396
[SPEAKER_06]: And you make nice little cube animals.

820
01:00:02,638 --> 01:00:02,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

821
01:00:05,546 --> 01:00:09,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Total War Battle Pack Total War Battle Pack Total War Battle Pack Total War Battle Pack

[SPEAKER_06]: Dance Sensation, Dementium 2, Cup Scout Badge

823
01:00:45,469 --> 01:00:52,014
[SPEAKER_06]: and also this week the official Xbox 360 USB flash sticks.

824
01:00:52,834 --> 01:00:55,956
[SPEAKER_06]: These are hilarious and I'm laughing at the prices.

825
01:00:57,297 --> 01:01:05,743
[SPEAKER_06]: An 8GB USB flash drive will cost you $39.99 and a 16GB flash drive will run you $69.99.

826
01:01:06,744 --> 01:01:11,587
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just pricing these online because I'm planning on picking up an 8GB and guess what?

827
01:01:11,607 --> 01:01:12,708
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get them for about half the price.

828
01:01:12,928 --> 01:01:14,769
[SPEAKER_06]: So really, thank you Microsoft for

829
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:21,160
[SPEAKER_06]: still overcharging, it's not going to work as well with a USB stick and that's it for this week

830
01:01:22,475 --> 01:01:23,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Golden Week

831
01:01:46,983 --> 01:01:47,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it?

832
01:01:47,524 --> 01:01:47,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Golden Week.

833
01:01:48,045 --> 01:01:50,428
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a big... Like finals and school night?

834
01:01:50,508 --> 01:01:51,069
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, no.

835
01:01:51,189 --> 01:01:58,679
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, if I remember right, Golden Week is when families go back to their hometowns and visit with people.

836
01:01:58,699 --> 01:01:59,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, everything's closed.

837
01:01:59,921 --> 01:02:02,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I just know the 5th of May is Children's Day.

838
01:02:03,765 --> 01:02:05,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, maybe that explains where the holiday comes from in WoW.

839
01:02:06,087 --> 01:02:07,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Because this is Children's Week in WoW right now.

840
01:02:08,269 --> 01:02:10,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I totally just made a Warcraft reference.

841
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:12,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Nintendo Wii, also nothing this week.

842
01:02:12,772 --> 01:02:13,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

843
01:02:13,272 --> 01:02:14,773
[SPEAKER_05]: No releases until the 13th of May.

844
01:02:15,434 --> 01:02:16,795
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 2, nothing.

845
01:02:16,935 --> 01:02:18,116
[SPEAKER_05]: DS, nothing.

846
01:02:18,976 --> 01:02:20,137
[SPEAKER_05]: PSP, nothing.

847
01:02:20,277 --> 01:02:22,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing is coming out in Japan until the 13th.

848
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, by the way, I found it.

849
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:24,800
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

850
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:29,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Golden Week, it's paid time off on the work days.

851
01:02:30,102 --> 01:02:32,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Some companies completely close down and give their employees time off.

852
01:02:33,144 --> 01:02:36,105
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the longest vacation period of the year for many Japanese jobs.

853
01:02:36,605 --> 01:02:38,026
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah.

854
01:02:38,666 --> 01:02:39,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish we had that over here.

855
01:02:39,706 --> 01:02:40,927
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I want Golden Week.

856
01:02:40,967 --> 01:02:42,047
[SPEAKER_05]: How about Golden Arches Week?

857
01:02:43,007 --> 01:02:46,288
[SPEAKER_05]: We have FIFA World Cup Soccer to look forward to when Golden Week's over.

858
01:02:46,308 --> 01:02:54,731
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because there's... It's because there's... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 holidays during that period of time.

859
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:55,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

860
01:02:56,351 --> 01:02:58,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we get Cinco de Mayo over here.

861
01:02:59,195 --> 01:03:00,755
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't get it off, do we?

862
01:03:00,775 --> 01:03:05,877
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, really, I don't think Cinco de Mayo is really like actually an American holiday anyway.

863
01:03:05,917 --> 01:03:09,958
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just one we kind of borrowed from our neighbors to have an excuse to drink.

864
01:03:09,978 --> 01:03:11,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Mexican food potluck day.

865
01:03:11,758 --> 01:03:12,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

866
01:03:13,738 --> 01:03:16,259
[SPEAKER_05]: As if work needed another excuse to have a potluck.

867
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:19,400
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

868
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:20,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.

869
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:22,080
[SPEAKER_05]: How about the UK?

870
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:24,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any holidays in the UK stopping video games this week?

871
01:03:25,721 --> 01:03:25,821
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

872
01:03:26,501 --> 01:03:26,942
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think so.

873
01:03:27,122 --> 01:03:28,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't they celebrate Cinco de Mayo?

874
01:03:32,866 --> 01:03:42,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Runaway 3 for DS, Runaway A Twist of Fate for PC on the 7th by the way, Sin and Punishment 2 for Wii, and What Did I Do to Deserve This My Lord?

875
01:03:43,195 --> 01:03:47,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, that's awesome that they're getting Sin and Punishment 2 seeing as ours has been delayed.

876
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:47,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

877
01:03:49,181 --> 01:03:51,243
[SPEAKER_09]: But that last one's on PSP and that's really it.

878
01:03:53,140 --> 01:04:01,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, a few more gaming stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week where DarkSakura is going to dig through the vaults and believe me kids, she's digging this week.

879
01:04:01,586 --> 01:04:01,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

880
01:04:03,087 --> 01:04:22,299
[SPEAKER_06]: You may remember that Microsoft sued Datel over their unofficial max memory memory cards that they had out because they took little micro SD cards and allowed you to use them on the Xbox 360 which now that I think of it, it's kind of funny because

881
01:04:24,941 --> 01:04:29,465
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually... Now that they've opened that up, you don't really need these memory cards.

882
01:04:29,986 --> 01:04:32,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk about... Sucking.

883
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:44,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, so... To kind of respond to Datel's request, they filed an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft.

884
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:49,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Pissed off that they weren't kind of playing on even playing ground here.

885
01:04:50,223 --> 01:04:50,363
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

886
01:04:53,764 --> 01:04:55,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of remember this whole back and forth from a couple weeks ago.

887
01:04:56,607 --> 01:05:11,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're basically saying that the claims that by detail that they locked them out with a firmware update and Microsoft has used its status as a platform holder to unlawfully prevent competition.

888
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:14,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I can see that because there's a lot of

889
01:05:16,727 --> 01:05:25,333
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of first-party products out there, but there's a lot of stuff that you have to get approval from Microsoft to build the release items for those systems.

890
01:05:25,633 --> 01:05:40,742
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that pretty much goes with any other system, but seeing as the Wii and the PlayStation 3 use open storage formats, the SD memory cards and USB memory sticks and stuff like that, now Microsoft...

891
01:05:42,643 --> 01:05:55,992
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see how that would be a problem since they were, prior to the last firmware update, only allowed to use either the hard drive or a memory stick, memory unit from Microsoft.

892
01:05:57,353 --> 01:06:08,380
[SPEAKER_06]: They're saying in Microsoft's motion to dismiss, because they tried to dismiss it, it claimed that the language in the additional terms and conditions clause of the Xbox 360 product warranty, because everybody reads that,

893
01:06:09,201 --> 01:06:28,901
[SPEAKER_06]: um barred the use of unauthorized peripherals and the company backed up its case by citing Apple's I guess successful defense of its right to limit the use of OS X to its own hardware and the court rejected Microsoft's motion to have it dismissed so it will apparently go to trial

894
01:06:30,234 --> 01:06:42,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Although at this point it's like, well, that's great and all, but in the meantime, I'll just pop in my USB memory stick to save my games now.

895
01:06:42,163 --> 01:06:46,407
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's going to be kind of hard to make the case now.

896
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:49,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

897
01:06:50,961 --> 01:06:58,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, do you think this is going to be one of those cases that gets dragged out for years and years, or is it going to get settled pretty quickly?

898
01:06:59,005 --> 01:07:00,165
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?

899
01:07:00,426 --> 01:07:02,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Put on your legal expert hat.

900
01:07:04,168 --> 01:07:14,373
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it'll probably get settled because, you know, really, yeah, it sucks that they made these devices and they got pulled from the market really quick.

901
01:07:15,033 --> 01:07:16,034
[SPEAKER_06]: My thing is, though...

902
01:07:18,513 --> 01:07:18,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

903
01:07:35,928 --> 01:07:36,688
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

904
01:07:37,729 --> 01:07:38,169
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard.

905
01:07:38,309 --> 01:07:40,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're not making them.

906
01:07:40,551 --> 01:07:41,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, they're not making them now.

907
01:07:41,611 --> 01:07:49,996
[SPEAKER_06]: But if they were to, say, completely ignore the time when they had just the memory units, now that argument doesn't really hold.

908
01:07:50,937 --> 01:07:53,278
[SPEAKER_06]: But, of course, this took place before that update.

909
01:07:53,438 --> 01:07:57,640
[SPEAKER_06]: But it almost makes you wonder if that update was partially in response to this.

910
01:07:57,861 --> 01:07:58,841
[SPEAKER_06]: But who knows?

911
01:08:00,762 --> 01:08:01,562
[SPEAKER_06]: It just sucks for them.

912
01:08:01,762 --> 01:08:05,144
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an interesting thought because it did seem like that USB thing came out of nowhere, didn't it?

913
01:08:05,324 --> 01:08:25,930
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they were worried that there was going to be some sort of... Because with this, you'll be able to access your files on your memory cards or whatever, and you might be able to cheat or something, like edit your save games or something, which I can tell you right now that wouldn't have stopped them because it's very easy to do that if you have the right tools.

914
01:08:26,110 --> 01:08:28,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Even easier now that they have USB support.

915
01:08:28,131 --> 01:08:28,431
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like...

916
01:08:30,137 --> 01:08:51,105
[SPEAKER_05]: A program in hex editing Alright, we're gonna go ahead and move on We got one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week And that story has to do with something we sort of talked about last week Don't know if you heard, but apparently a leaked GameStop ad has revealed that a black Wii bundle is on its way Who would have thought?

917
01:08:51,425 --> 01:08:52,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I had never heard about this

918
01:08:53,686 --> 01:08:59,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, this black Wii will contain a Wii Mode and Motion Plus and Wii Sports, Wii Sports Resorts, all for $200.

919
01:08:59,511 --> 01:09:04,515
[SPEAKER_05]: However, it's supposed to be coming out May 4th, which differs from an earlier report.

920
01:09:04,796 --> 01:09:10,540
[SPEAKER_05]: But the interesting thing is that, I'm sorry, the ad is not supposed to go up until May 4th, but it got leaked.

921
01:09:10,961 --> 01:09:13,142
[SPEAKER_05]: The debut of the system, I'm sorry, is May 9th.

922
01:09:13,943 --> 01:09:40,482
[SPEAKER_05]: which differs from the earlier report Canada is supposed to get it on May 23rd which is interesting because May 23rd is the date that had originally been reported and my source was not Canadian thank you very much so don't know what happened there but could also be that more is to come because Nintendo has yet to make any official announcement you have to keep in mind all of this is still rumor it's just that now instead of you know some schmo on an internet radio show saying something now there's a picture to prove it it's coming

923
01:09:40,902 --> 01:09:42,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas everybody outside of the U.S.

924
01:09:42,484 --> 01:09:44,327
[SPEAKER_05]: is rolling their eyes and saying move on with it.

925
01:09:44,367 --> 01:09:45,688
[SPEAKER_05]: We already have the Black We here.

926
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:46,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's news here.

927
01:09:47,674 --> 01:09:50,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, Nintendo is pissed.

928
01:09:51,657 --> 01:09:54,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, they commented actually on what's going on here.

929
01:09:55,059 --> 01:09:56,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, they didn't comment.

930
01:09:56,219 --> 01:09:59,281
[SPEAKER_05]: They made threats which caused GameStop to comment.

931
01:09:59,742 --> 01:10:00,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is an email.

932
01:10:01,843 --> 01:10:07,326
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this because this whole email is about stop leaking stuff and then the email gets leaked.

933
01:10:07,546 --> 01:10:08,347
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my favorite.

934
01:10:08,667 --> 01:10:09,087
[SPEAKER_05]: So here it is.

935
01:10:09,127 --> 01:10:09,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the email.

936
01:10:10,088 --> 01:10:11,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me read the email that went out to all the stores.

937
01:10:13,226 --> 01:10:17,772
[SPEAKER_05]: As you know, there is a lot of rumor and speculation about various new products and titles launching this year.

938
01:10:18,333 --> 01:10:19,495
[SPEAKER_05]: One of these is the Black Wii.

939
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:23,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Various blogs and internet sites are raising awareness about this product.

940
01:10:24,001 --> 01:10:27,285
[SPEAKER_05]: GameStop stores and associates should not proliferate these rumors.

941
01:10:27,726 --> 01:10:29,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Today you received Pop, I guess that's what.

942
01:10:30,069 --> 01:10:30,549
[SPEAKER_06]: P.O.P.

943
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:31,470
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that?

944
01:10:33,371 --> 01:10:34,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of purchase advertising.

945
01:10:34,672 --> 01:10:35,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

946
01:10:35,512 --> 01:10:39,895
[SPEAKER_05]: For your windows regarding the Black Wii, somehow a picture of this appeared on the internet.

947
01:10:40,416 --> 01:10:41,997
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just somebody snapped it with their camera phone.

948
01:10:42,017 --> 01:10:42,997
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's not that hard to figure out.

949
01:10:43,317 --> 01:10:47,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hey, it may seem cool to be in the know and feel compelled to share something like this.

950
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:49,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing can be further from the truth.

951
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:55,282
[SPEAKER_05]: All activity like this does is hurt our reputation with publishers and manufacturers and potentially hurts our company.

952
01:10:55,702 --> 01:11:02,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Until Nintendo decides to announce their product, their was capitalized, that's why I shouted it, there should be no discussion of it with customers, period.

953
01:11:03,204 --> 01:11:07,725
[SPEAKER_05]: If they ask, it's not appropriate to comment on speculation and rumors should be the answer.

954
01:11:07,765 --> 01:11:08,345
[SPEAKER_05]: That's dumb.

955
01:11:08,365 --> 01:11:09,825
[SPEAKER_05]: So in other words, you should just confirm it.

956
01:11:09,845 --> 01:11:10,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Just say, I don't know.

957
01:11:13,487 --> 01:11:15,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's an excuse that people will believe.

958
01:11:15,608 --> 01:11:16,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I work at a game store.

959
01:11:17,069 --> 01:11:17,509
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

960
01:11:18,610 --> 01:11:19,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't believe that.

961
01:11:20,711 --> 01:11:20,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

962
01:11:20,952 --> 01:11:21,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Bitch, please!

963
01:11:42,148 --> 01:11:43,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's the funny thing about it.

964
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:43,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

965
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:44,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.

966
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:51,397
[SPEAKER_05]: If you didn't want news on this to get out until May 4th, then maybe you should have sent out the materials, I don't know, May 2nd?

967
01:11:51,838 --> 01:11:52,719
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, come on.

968
01:11:53,159 --> 01:11:59,906
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're going to pay these guys next to nothing, and let's face it, these employees at GameStop don't make enough money to shut up.

969
01:12:01,047 --> 01:12:01,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

970
01:12:02,769 --> 01:12:02,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

971
01:12:03,487 --> 01:12:08,351
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you shouldn't be telling the whole world that the Black Week's coming out if you don't want people to say things about it.

972
01:12:08,371 --> 01:12:11,793
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love how they put, oh, it hurts our relationship with Nintendo.

973
01:12:11,953 --> 01:12:17,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm sure Nintendo's going to go, oh, we're not going to ship product to our largest partner.

974
01:12:17,437 --> 01:12:19,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, Loki, actually, Loki, they did make that threat.

975
01:12:20,099 --> 01:12:21,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, that is the rumor going around.

976
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:25,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo did make the threat to pull all of its products from GameStop Stories.

977
01:12:25,543 --> 01:12:27,245
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I have to say to Nintendo over that?

978
01:12:27,285 --> 01:12:27,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

979
01:12:27,685 --> 01:12:35,945
[SPEAKER_05]: bitch please it would never happen bitch please never happen what other game stores are there?

980
01:12:39,645 --> 01:12:43,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you're gonna just rely on Walmart and Target and all that for your sales?

981
01:12:43,949 --> 01:12:44,649
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, come on.

982
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:48,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they'll actually send us an actual decent... I mean, that is an empty threat if I've ever heard one.

983
01:12:48,773 --> 01:13:02,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they'll send us a decent quantity of product then, because we service all the independent guys and they seem to fuck us over all the time, so... I would love to see the big gorilla in the corner GameStop get fucked over once.

984
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:03,945
Ha ha ha!

985
01:13:04,425 --> 01:13:04,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Or twice.

986
01:13:05,126 --> 01:13:07,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you're kind of sitting there going, leak more, leak more.

987
01:13:08,328 --> 01:13:09,389
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to do anything.

988
01:13:09,429 --> 01:13:10,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me put it this way.

989
01:13:10,450 --> 01:13:13,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Game stops leak information all the time.

990
01:13:13,392 --> 01:13:19,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only do you leak information all the time, I'm sure that they're the source of a lot of the leaked games that appear on the internet as well.

991
01:13:22,429 --> 01:13:22,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh well.

992
01:13:23,209 --> 01:13:25,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Things get leaked.

993
01:13:25,571 --> 01:13:27,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Trust no one.

994
01:13:27,232 --> 01:13:27,872
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what?

995
01:13:27,892 --> 01:13:29,493
[SPEAKER_05]: These people don't give a shit.

996
01:13:29,693 --> 01:13:31,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the music industry.

997
01:13:31,914 --> 01:13:36,957
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, CDs get leaked weeks before their release date on the internet.

998
01:13:37,437 --> 01:13:39,858
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what they say about when something hits the internet, it's done.

999
01:13:40,879 --> 01:13:42,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's got it now.

1000
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Once it's been put on the internet, it is not coming off.

1001
01:13:46,042 --> 01:13:46,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Period.

1002
01:13:48,709 --> 01:13:49,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

1003
01:13:50,071 --> 01:13:51,412
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, the Black Wii is coming.

1004
01:13:51,432 --> 01:13:52,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Big surprise!

1005
01:13:52,573 --> 01:13:54,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Five minutes of fame and an eternity on the internet.

1006
01:13:54,796 --> 01:13:55,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the thing.

1007
01:13:55,717 --> 01:14:01,603
[SPEAKER_06]: The only reason why they probably didn't want to leak, and this is a stupid reason anyways, is that's going to hurt the sales of the Wii right now.

1008
01:14:01,783 --> 01:14:07,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Because people are like, why the fuck am I going to pay $1.99 for the Wii when I can get the Wii with Wii Sports Resort?

1009
01:14:09,202 --> 01:14:10,883
[SPEAKER_05]: for the same price.

1010
01:14:11,023 --> 01:14:13,104
[SPEAKER_05]: But retailers are already doing that.

1011
01:14:13,365 --> 01:14:19,088
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a story a couple weeks ago about Walmart was already selling this as a bundle, and I believe other games... Yeah, they already have it.

1012
01:14:19,588 --> 01:14:21,029
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's Nintendo's problem?

1013
01:14:21,049 --> 01:14:21,869
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's black!

1014
01:14:21,909 --> 01:14:22,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Bitch, please!

1015
01:14:26,752 --> 01:14:27,132
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1016
01:14:27,252 --> 01:14:29,794
[SPEAKER_06]: All I can say is that my Wii's been gathering dust for...

1017
01:14:32,235 --> 01:14:33,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Five months?

1018
01:14:33,277 --> 01:14:36,943
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to see that meeting where somebody at GameStop says that to Reggie Fils-Aimé's face.

1019
01:14:37,003 --> 01:14:37,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Bitch, please!

1020
01:14:38,025 --> 01:14:39,408
[SPEAKER_09]: I still want to borrow your Wii Fit.

1021
01:14:40,730 --> 01:14:41,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I want to use it.

1022
01:14:42,914 --> 01:14:43,676
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're not using it.

1023
01:14:45,888 --> 01:14:46,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure.

1024
01:14:46,388 --> 01:14:46,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

1025
01:14:47,069 --> 01:14:47,309
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1026
01:14:47,669 --> 01:14:48,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, let's move on.

1027
01:14:50,130 --> 01:14:52,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Spyro in chat says, Wade, it's already here.

1028
01:14:52,631 --> 01:14:53,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's my other thing.

1029
01:14:53,491 --> 01:14:56,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it like in all the rest of the world, like the UK and what?

1030
01:14:57,173 --> 01:14:58,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't even Canada have the Black Week?

1031
01:14:58,593 --> 01:15:00,414
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, because it's supposed to come out May 23rd.

1032
01:15:00,854 --> 01:15:03,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much everywhere but the US and Canada has already had the Black Week.

1033
01:15:03,855 --> 01:15:05,796
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll announce it like tomorrow, okay?

1034
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:07,717
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're going to make the announcement soon.

1035
01:15:07,777 --> 01:15:08,997
[SPEAKER_06]: It's retarded that they're not.

1036
01:15:10,698 --> 01:15:11,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe on the 4th.

1037
01:15:11,818 --> 01:15:13,699
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why they wait until Tuesday.

1038
01:15:13,799 --> 01:15:15,619
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just going to be an announcement.

1039
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:17,940
[SPEAKER_06]: And whoop-dee-shit.

1040
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:19,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, seriously.

1041
01:15:20,021 --> 01:15:21,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, a color change?

1042
01:15:21,261 --> 01:15:24,742
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really going to get people to buy the Wii that didn't before?

1043
01:15:25,142 --> 01:15:27,163
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have bought it, but if only it were black.

1044
01:15:28,803 --> 01:15:33,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to comments from our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com Actdeft says, to Nintendo, you mad?

1045
01:15:35,829 --> 01:15:37,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma says, is that sky getting sassy?

1046
01:15:39,853 --> 01:15:54,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Frisbee says, Nintenlol And Tigerclaw says, a black Wii would be nice, but it's not going to hide all the dust it will collect turning it into a white Wii Should be more of like a grayish Wii, but I get your point, that's true It's going to be like the PS3's little dust magnets

1047
01:15:56,438 --> 01:15:57,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times, good times.

1048
01:15:57,939 --> 01:16:07,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it's that part of the show where we're going to, speaking of dusty things, we're going to jump into DarkSakura's vault and pull out a video game that's a classic.

1049
01:16:07,948 --> 01:16:16,475
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time to bring a game up from the vaults of history and deem it as a true classic that you kids need to respect and adore and play some of this week.

1050
01:16:16,796 --> 01:16:19,098
[SPEAKER_05]: It's DarkSakura's classic game of the week.

1051
01:16:19,758 --> 01:16:21,560
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what game did you pick for us this week?

1052
01:16:22,518 --> 01:16:24,580
[SPEAKER_09]: I picked a sequel, Rob.

1053
01:16:25,601 --> 01:16:26,923
[SPEAKER_09]: I picked Dodonpachi.

1054
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:29,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Dodonpachi.

1055
01:16:29,205 --> 01:16:30,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't say I've heard of this game.

1056
01:16:30,767 --> 01:16:31,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's check it out.

1057
01:16:31,388 --> 01:16:31,828
[SPEAKER_05]: What's Dodonpachi?

1058
01:16:31,848 --> 01:16:33,169
[SPEAKER_09]: You haven't heard of Dodonpachi?

1059
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:33,930
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think so.

1060
01:16:34,591 --> 01:16:36,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Like one of the classic cave shooters.

1061
01:16:36,793 --> 01:16:37,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Countdown begins.

1062
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:41,441
[SPEAKER_09]: As in the company that gave us Eskabaluga Whale.

1063
01:16:41,982 --> 01:16:43,042
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, Eskabaluda.

1064
01:16:43,462 --> 01:16:45,563
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I know Cave, but I didn't play all of their games.

1065
01:16:45,623 --> 01:16:48,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, was this actually released in the U.S.?

1066
01:16:48,344 --> 01:16:49,084
[SPEAKER_05]: What system was this on?

1067
01:16:49,285 --> 01:16:51,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I played Dodonpachi in the arcade.

1068
01:16:53,266 --> 01:16:54,807
[SPEAKER_09]: It was published by Atlus.

1069
01:16:57,508 --> 01:17:03,350
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, for systems it came out on... Let's see.

1070
01:17:04,051 --> 01:17:06,432
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to remember, because I think that there was... Wasn't there...

1071
01:17:08,672 --> 01:17:10,132
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember if it was arcade only.

1072
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:20,515
[SPEAKER_09]: It couldn't have been arcade only because I know that this... And I think that Dodonpachi came out in the arcade only.

1073
01:17:22,695 --> 01:17:24,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I really don't remember playing this at home.

1074
01:17:24,696 --> 01:17:26,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I've just had name wrongs.

1075
01:17:26,336 --> 01:17:27,196
[SPEAKER_06]: It was also on the Saturn.

1076
01:17:27,496 --> 01:17:28,697
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, it was on the Saturn.

1077
01:17:28,737 --> 01:17:29,777
[SPEAKER_06]: And the original PlayStation.

1078
01:17:31,485 --> 01:17:32,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

1079
01:17:48,288 --> 01:18:04,425
[SPEAKER_09]: and then there's another twist in this one but I'm not going to really go much into it but you have different fighters you have your type A which is a narrow stream of shots you have B which is a helicopter that has guns forward and side guns and then type C

1080
01:18:05,626 --> 01:18:08,268
[SPEAKER_09]: which is a wide three-way spread of shots.

1081
01:18:09,169 --> 01:18:12,911
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got different guns, lasers, bombs, all kinds of different stuff, different power-ups.

1082
01:18:13,351 --> 01:18:14,832
[SPEAKER_09]: You get shot mode and laser mode.

1083
01:18:15,373 --> 01:18:21,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Different collectible items where you can get power to increase your guns and lasers.

1084
01:18:21,837 --> 01:18:23,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Bombs where you get more bombs.

1085
01:18:24,018 --> 01:18:27,561
[SPEAKER_09]: MP appears when you've lost all your lives.

1086
01:18:27,781 --> 01:18:31,083
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you continue, you can pick that up and you start back at full strength.

1087
01:18:31,443 --> 01:18:33,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is also in Escaluda.

1088
01:18:34,765 --> 01:18:40,390
[SPEAKER_09]: and in another game that... Crap, it's supposed to be even harder than that.

1089
01:18:40,510 --> 01:18:45,113
[SPEAKER_09]: I had set a link aside to get the name of it, but anyway.

1090
01:18:47,715 --> 01:18:57,883
[SPEAKER_09]: You also... Now, this is something else that totally incorporated into Escaluda later on is that you can get stars for...

1091
01:18:59,915 --> 01:19:04,999
[SPEAKER_09]: for killing a boss, a mid-boss or an end-boss.

1092
01:19:05,659 --> 01:19:09,182
[SPEAKER_09]: And their bullets are converted into stars, and you get 100 points.

1093
01:19:09,282 --> 01:19:14,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you get a giant star when you get 10,000 points for a multi-part boss.

1094
01:19:15,867 --> 01:19:21,911
[SPEAKER_09]: And then a pentagon that gives you 300 points, but you only find them on the ground.

1095
01:19:22,411 --> 01:19:25,974
[SPEAKER_09]: And by the way, the other game that I am thinking of is...

1096
01:19:28,999 --> 01:19:29,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Mushahime-sama

1097
01:19:42,489 --> 01:19:54,987
[SPEAKER_09]: You've also got a maximum mode in this where if you trigger a bomb when all of your bomb slots are full and then your score increases by 220 points per 1 60th of a second.

1098
01:19:59,053 --> 01:19:59,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1099
01:20:00,334 --> 01:20:05,618
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you start off with a two multiplier and you increase by one for every successive bomb collected in maximum mode.

1100
01:20:06,098 --> 01:20:08,260
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's pretty crazy.

1101
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:18,608
[SPEAKER_09]: You also have a get point system where you have a combo gauge and you get increased number of points from enemies' larger hit counts.

1102
01:20:18,728 --> 01:20:20,289
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty complex.

1103
01:20:20,329 --> 01:20:20,950
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got other stuff.

1104
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:22,871
[SPEAKER_09]: So you've got different areas in the game.

1105
01:20:25,253 --> 01:20:40,580
[SPEAKER_09]: but area 7 you can only get to by entering the second loop which is done by completing the first six areas on one credit and doing any of these following requirements where you lose two lives

1106
01:20:41,901 --> 01:20:55,999
[SPEAKER_09]: or depending on which one you lose for type A you have to have a maximum hit count of 270 hits type B 300 and type C 330 or score at least 50 million points at the end of area 6 or collect all 13 B's in 4 of the 6 areas

1107
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:06,262
[SPEAKER_09]: And the second loop has the same areas, same bosses, but you have many, many, many more bullets.

1108
01:21:07,143 --> 01:21:08,543
[SPEAKER_09]: And giant mechanical bees.

1109
01:21:09,584 --> 01:21:13,525
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you get the actual real boss of the game.

1110
01:21:14,325 --> 01:21:21,628
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got different bonuses, so you get stuff for getting the pentagons, getting the stars, boss hits, no miss.

1111
01:21:22,588 --> 01:21:29,131
[SPEAKER_09]: And then in the second loop, you get 10 million points for each reserve fighter.

1112
01:21:29,471 --> 01:21:31,531
[SPEAKER_09]: So you've got different endings, too.

1113
01:21:32,852 --> 01:21:38,474
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't get the second loop access, then you're congratulated by the Donpachi Corps for being brave.

1114
01:21:39,275 --> 01:21:45,809
[SPEAKER_09]: if you get everything the mechanized aliens this is what I was talking about with the first one are your own comrades

1115
01:21:47,412 --> 01:22:16,387
[SPEAKER_09]: although the international release says it's a lost fleet but they're actually trying to stop you so once everything is done they're all ordered to kill you and that's when you start the second loop so going through it again the whole point of Dampachi is to annihilate all the human beings in the world awesome

1116
01:22:17,392 --> 01:22:19,333
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, pretty crazy, huh?

1117
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:58,888
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe SSJ100Matt actually linked that in our chatroom because our chatroom is very resourceful here it is, the hardest video game boss ever let me fast forward a little bit here this is nuts, you don't need to fast forward all that much it starts off hard isn't that gorgeous?

1118
01:22:59,828 --> 01:23:07,692
[SPEAKER_09]: this is ridiculous this is just retarded stupid there's a video up of a person missing on it not getting hit

1119
01:23:09,881 --> 01:23:17,122
[SPEAKER_09]: And keep in mind, the final boss in Espaluda on iPhone releases not quite as many bullets.

1120
01:23:17,182 --> 01:23:21,263
[SPEAKER_06]: See Rob, the way these games work, you can only get hit in that little glowing spot right there.

1121
01:23:21,403 --> 01:23:21,923
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1122
01:23:26,424 --> 01:23:27,184
[SPEAKER_09]: That's bullet hell.

1123
01:23:28,185 --> 01:23:28,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Ridiculous.

1124
01:23:29,205 --> 01:23:33,526
[SPEAKER_09]: And I like that it talks to you the whole time just like it does in Espaluda.

1125
01:23:35,206 --> 01:23:35,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1126
01:23:36,587 --> 01:23:38,669
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, Cave is evil.

1127
01:23:38,769 --> 01:23:41,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Cave is evil for throwing bullets up our noses.

1128
01:23:42,692 --> 01:23:56,523
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, there was a special version, the campaign version, or DDP Blue ROM, that has a very limited print of the game that was given to winners at a Dodonpachi contest that Cave had.

1129
01:23:57,684 --> 01:23:57,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

1130
01:23:59,025 --> 01:24:00,766
[SPEAKER_09]: It has the same game.

1131
01:24:00,846 --> 01:24:06,849
[SPEAKER_09]: It's harder and has a hyper mode in it, which actually shows up later in Dodonpachi Daiojo.

1132
01:24:08,069 --> 01:24:09,110
[SPEAKER_09]: A blue title screen.

1133
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:11,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Very, very hard to get.

1134
01:24:12,911 --> 01:24:13,592
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually...

1135
01:24:17,674 --> 01:24:19,476
[SPEAKER_09]: There's actually two that have confirmed to exist.

1136
01:24:19,556 --> 01:24:26,262
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them belongs to the current world holder for Dodonpachi.

1137
01:24:29,245 --> 01:24:36,491
[SPEAKER_09]: There were, of course, the other versions to the Saturn and PlayStation.

1138
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:40,915
[SPEAKER_09]: I was trying to remember if it was Dodonpachi or Dodonpachi, but I think it was Dodonpachi.

1139
01:24:41,736 --> 01:24:47,818
[SPEAKER_09]: And that game, I've only ever really played it in the arcade, although I think I have it on Saturn in one of my collections somewhere.

1140
01:24:48,418 --> 01:24:49,799
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, pretty crazy.

1141
01:24:49,979 --> 01:24:53,460
[SPEAKER_09]: And for the record, you want to play 2D games on the Saturn.

1142
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:54,060
[SPEAKER_09]: They look better.

1143
01:24:54,961 --> 01:24:58,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, there it is, your classic video game of the week, Dodonpachi.

1144
01:24:58,242 --> 01:25:05,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to comments from our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Shaoran says, Bullet Hell is all about patterns, beauty, thought.

1145
01:25:05,384 --> 01:25:10,146
[SPEAKER_05]: In Bullet Hell, only gorgeous patterns should be allowed as there are no things superior to beauty and thought.

1146
01:25:10,926 --> 01:25:14,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Kevin DDR says, Sky, 2-3 means it's the second loop.

1147
01:25:15,169 --> 01:25:17,831
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to beat the game with certain conditions to even get to that.

1148
01:25:17,871 --> 01:25:20,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that ain't happening, I'll tell you that.

1149
01:25:21,414 --> 01:25:26,097
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Shaoran follows up and says, yeah, once you get grazing down, bullet hell games aren't that hard.

1150
01:25:26,137 --> 01:25:30,180
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just about memorization, just like any other old Japanese game.

1151
01:25:31,041 --> 01:25:33,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Frisbee says, bullet hell is almost like a maze game.

1152
01:25:35,003 --> 01:25:35,804
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I could see that.

1153
01:25:36,184 --> 01:25:37,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Just interesting.

1154
01:25:38,185 --> 01:25:38,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1155
01:25:39,226 --> 01:25:40,587
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just not very good at those games.

1156
01:25:41,548 --> 01:25:48,293
[SPEAKER_05]: The last bullet hell game I played was the You Will Die, which was by one of the other All Games hosts making his own game on XNA.

1157
01:25:49,134 --> 01:25:49,914
[SPEAKER_05]: And I suck at it.

1158
01:25:51,155 --> 01:25:53,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's go do our break.

1159
01:25:53,356 --> 01:25:54,416
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take a quick break.

1160
01:25:54,436 --> 01:25:55,036
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be right back.

1161
01:25:55,056 --> 01:25:56,236
[SPEAKER_05]: There's plenty more to come tonight.

1162
01:25:56,336 --> 01:25:56,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Listless!

1163
01:25:57,077 --> 01:25:57,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

1164
01:25:57,797 --> 01:26:03,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of friends on all games, one of our podcasting buddies is going to join us for Listless later and Bungie news.

1165
01:26:04,259 --> 01:26:05,719
[SPEAKER_05]: There was huge news out of Bungie this week.

1166
01:26:05,739 --> 01:26:07,059
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk about that in the next segment.

1167
01:26:07,319 --> 01:26:09,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy VI remakes?

1168
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:10,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Possibly?

1169
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:10,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe?

1170
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:12,901
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see after a quick break.

1171
01:26:12,921 --> 01:26:13,541
[SPEAKER_05]: So stay tuned.

1172
01:26:13,561 --> 01:26:14,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't go anywhere.

1173
01:26:14,221 --> 01:26:16,782
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1174
01:26:22,751 --> 01:26:27,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everybody and welcome back to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1175
01:26:27,375 --> 01:26:33,201
[SPEAKER_05]: It's part B of our show, already in progress, episode number 365 on this May 2nd of 2010.

1176
01:26:33,341 --> 01:26:39,286
[SPEAKER_05]: We have plenty more gaming news to get to this hour and listless tonight.

1177
01:26:39,366 --> 01:26:41,909
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll tell you the topic right now, what we're going to be doing tonight.

1178
01:26:42,469 --> 01:26:42,709
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1179
01:26:43,650 --> 01:26:46,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Capcom vs. series, should they do next?

1180
01:26:46,671 --> 01:26:49,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe I should actually say versus Capcom would be correct.

1181
01:26:49,433 --> 01:26:55,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you know, you've had Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, Marvel vs. Capcom, what should they do next?

1182
01:26:55,175 --> 01:26:59,857
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to find out with the definitive list in a few more minutes here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1183
01:26:59,877 --> 01:27:01,498
[SPEAKER_05]: But first, we have some rapid, quick...

1184
01:27:02,598 --> 01:27:02,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey!

1185
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:28,380
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1186
01:27:29,181 --> 01:27:29,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, what?

1187
01:27:29,721 --> 01:27:31,602
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I did during the Live 365.

1188
01:27:31,742 --> 01:27:32,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

1189
01:27:32,243 --> 01:27:33,524
[SPEAKER_05]: When they... Oh, God.

1190
01:27:33,804 --> 01:27:35,865
[SPEAKER_05]: How could I forget when they forgot our name?

1191
01:27:35,885 --> 01:27:40,568
[SPEAKER_05]: When they were going over... Yeah, we got nominated one year for Live 365 Station of the Year.

1192
01:27:40,768 --> 01:27:44,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, that's a pretty big honor because it was, what, like 11,000 stations on Live 365?

1193
01:27:44,551 --> 01:27:46,833
[SPEAKER_05]: We were one of the five nominated for Station of the Year.

1194
01:27:47,213 --> 01:27:52,316
[SPEAKER_05]: And when What's Her Name, Betty whatever, was reading the nominees, she forgot OLR.

1195
01:27:52,776 --> 01:27:55,198
[SPEAKER_05]: And you just hear... And, God, I wish I could find that recording.

1196
01:27:55,238 --> 01:27:57,800
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's long gone in the recycle bin or whatever.

1197
01:27:58,340 --> 01:27:59,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1198
01:28:16,676 --> 01:28:17,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1199
01:28:41,429 --> 01:28:42,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so yeah, that was good times.

1200
01:28:43,132 --> 01:28:46,778
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really wish I had a recording of that with Loki in the background.

1201
01:28:46,858 --> 01:28:47,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey!

1202
01:28:47,298 --> 01:28:48,761
[SPEAKER_05]: And then she goes, oh, oh, yeah, yeah!

1203
01:28:48,881 --> 01:28:53,167
[SPEAKER_05]: And on Orange Launch, Orange Launch, we just gave each other that look of, well, we didn't win.

1204
01:28:55,631 --> 01:28:56,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm out of here.

1205
01:28:57,851 --> 01:28:58,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Drew all this way for this.

1206
01:28:59,132 --> 01:29:02,855
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they drove up their fees by like 300% and we got the fuck out.

1207
01:29:02,895 --> 01:29:03,775
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we're here at All Games.

1208
01:29:03,795 --> 01:29:04,096
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1209
01:29:04,116 --> 01:29:04,896
[SPEAKER_05]: It worked out for the better.

1210
01:29:04,996 --> 01:29:11,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Because coming over to All Games I think got us new listeners because we had kind of a cultish audience.

1211
01:29:12,121 --> 01:29:16,424
[SPEAKER_05]: And Scott Rubin and Bobby Blackwolf and all the people at All Games had a bit of a cultish audience.

1212
01:29:16,805 --> 01:29:20,107
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we married these cults together, it was a good thing.

1213
01:29:20,370 --> 01:29:21,531
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1214
01:29:40,321 --> 01:30:00,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you can actually play, they have a little game where you can fly around as Iron Man, and apparently it debuted earlier last week on Thursday, and apparently it was part of the out, I'm surprised that they actually have a space, but

1215
01:30:01,378 --> 01:30:05,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Audi, I guess, has a space there, and they're teaming up with Paramount for that.

1216
01:30:05,781 --> 01:30:08,102
[SPEAKER_06]: So, no actual Iron Man themed space.

1217
01:30:08,122 --> 01:30:11,304
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it sort of is, but it's part of Audi's thing.

1218
01:30:12,184 --> 01:30:12,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

1219
01:30:13,325 --> 01:30:16,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then I guess, oh, that's funny.

1220
01:30:17,347 --> 01:30:24,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, though, it is exclusive to the European PlayStation Network, so... That sucks for most of our listeners.

1221
01:30:25,272 --> 01:30:25,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1222
01:30:27,008 --> 01:30:28,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Link, Mega Man, Samus, Simon Belmont, and Bill from Contra

1223
01:30:56,478 --> 01:31:01,402
[SPEAKER_06]: And then finally, APP has been slated to be coming out now on June 29th.

1224
01:31:01,762 --> 01:31:06,605
[SPEAKER_06]: And they also kind of talked a little bit about how their pricing structure is going to go as well.

1225
01:31:06,945 --> 01:31:07,766
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really cool.

1226
01:31:08,126 --> 01:31:09,327
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the way that they're doing it.

1227
01:31:09,467 --> 01:31:10,668
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think it's going to be pretty sweet.

1228
01:31:11,748 --> 01:31:16,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of paying a monthly fee, as you would with most MMOs, you pay for time.

1229
01:31:16,612 --> 01:31:19,754
[SPEAKER_06]: So, for example, when you buy the game, you get 50 hours.

1230
01:31:20,474 --> 01:31:22,756
[SPEAKER_06]: And how you use that is up to you.

1231
01:31:22,796 --> 01:31:24,197
[SPEAKER_06]: If you play a lot, great.

1232
01:31:24,557 --> 01:31:25,438
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't play a lot,

1233
01:31:26,238 --> 01:31:26,678
[SPEAKER_06]: No big deal.

1234
01:31:27,478 --> 01:31:39,442
[SPEAKER_06]: And once those are up, you have the option to purchase 20 more hours for $7, or you can do 30 days of unlimited access for $10, or 90 days or 180-day passes as well, and they haven't given the prices on those.

1235
01:31:39,862 --> 01:31:46,604
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition to extra playtime... Oh, in addition, extra playtime can be earned through different accomplishments in the game.

1236
01:31:47,764 --> 01:31:48,924
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty awesome.

1237
01:31:49,084 --> 01:31:51,645
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have to say, you know, I don't really hop on the...

1238
01:31:52,546 --> 01:31:57,885
[SPEAKER_06]: MMO Bandwagon because I don't have time to play games, but if it's pain as I go...

1239
01:31:59,671 --> 01:32:04,653
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm interested, definitely, especially since the game looks like Grand Theft Auto, so I'm all over that.

1240
01:32:04,973 --> 01:32:07,253
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's real-time worlds, man.

1241
01:32:07,293 --> 01:32:10,574
[SPEAKER_06]: They did Crackdown, and I really am sad that they didn't do the second Crackdown.

1242
01:32:10,594 --> 01:32:12,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God WoW doesn't charge by the hour.

1243
01:32:13,996 --> 01:32:14,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be in debt.

1244
01:32:15,096 --> 01:32:22,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, they do have that option, though, where you can buy unlimited access for 30 days for $10, which is still cheaper than WoW.

1245
01:32:23,338 --> 01:32:24,539
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not bad.

1246
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:24,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Not bad.

1247
01:32:26,021 --> 01:32:28,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, here's a game that I think Loki might be interested in.

1248
01:32:28,722 --> 01:32:31,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I think DarkSakura, I don't know why, this seems like a DarkSakura kind of game, too.

1249
01:32:31,943 --> 01:32:36,524
[SPEAKER_05]: THQ and SyFy, the TV network, are getting together to make a new game.

1250
01:32:37,044 --> 01:32:40,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly, it's not a Caprica game, but what it is, it's a Ghost Hunters Academy game.

1251
01:32:41,246 --> 01:32:42,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the problem I have with that.

1252
01:32:42,426 --> 01:32:48,148
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Ghost Hunters Academy, and they've done so many spin-offs of the Ghost Hunters show, it's retarded.

1253
01:32:48,188 --> 01:32:49,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what Academy is about.

1254
01:32:49,949 --> 01:32:51,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Academy is what the game's about.

1255
01:32:51,930 --> 01:32:52,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Just sayin'.

1256
01:33:16,055 --> 01:33:18,058
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, no details about actual gameplay.

1257
01:33:18,378 --> 01:33:25,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully it plays like Ghostbusters, the old school game that was on Commodore and NES, Don't Cross the Streams, Marshmallow Man, etc.

1258
01:33:26,807 --> 01:33:30,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, apparently there's stuff afoot in the Mega Man universe.

1259
01:33:30,649 --> 01:33:35,351
[SPEAKER_05]: No surprise there, because obviously Mega Man's been having a little bit of a renaissance thanks to Mega Man 9 and Mega Man 10.

1260
01:33:36,051 --> 01:33:38,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently there is a Mega Man universe.

1261
01:33:38,132 --> 01:33:42,553
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about this before, you know, but now we might know what this is actually connected to.

1262
01:33:43,294 --> 01:33:51,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently there was a little tease dropped in another podcast called Bit Transmission, and Seth Killen was the guest from Capcom.

1263
01:33:51,497 --> 01:33:54,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Mega Man still has some surprises in store for everybody

1264
01:34:12,923 --> 01:34:16,006
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a six-player co-op Xbox Live RPG game.

1265
01:34:19,269 --> 01:34:22,232
[SPEAKER_05]: And this week they're going to be like, shit, someone beat us to it.

1266
01:34:22,492 --> 01:34:23,213
[SPEAKER_05]: God damn it.

1267
01:34:23,313 --> 01:34:23,553
[SPEAKER_05]: M.U.

1268
01:34:23,593 --> 01:34:24,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami.

1269
01:34:24,734 --> 01:34:25,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing.

1270
01:34:25,255 --> 01:34:25,675
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

1271
01:34:25,695 --> 01:34:27,737
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know it would be Konami copying them.

1272
01:34:28,418 --> 01:34:29,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I went there.

1273
01:34:29,439 --> 01:34:30,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, look, no.

1274
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:31,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, think about it.

1275
01:34:32,101 --> 01:34:34,143
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to say nobody has seen it coming.

1276
01:34:35,054 --> 01:34:35,914
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's my thought.

1277
01:34:36,734 --> 01:34:38,715
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially if the game is called Mega Man Universe.

1278
01:34:39,295 --> 01:34:41,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this finally that game?

1279
01:34:41,756 --> 01:34:49,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yes, that Mega Man game with all of the robot bosses in it at once.

1280
01:34:50,958 --> 01:34:51,479
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be awesome.

1281
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:52,879
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be so fucking awesome.

1282
01:34:54,099 --> 01:34:55,720
[SPEAKER_05]: That's more awesome than I think I can handle.

1283
01:34:58,118 --> 01:34:58,378
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya

1284
01:35:17,268 --> 01:35:17,528
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1285
01:35:18,729 --> 01:35:23,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, speaking of games that sound really awesome, it'll probably make me pass out from how awesome it is.

1286
01:35:23,252 --> 01:35:25,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Mod Nation Racers is on its way out.

1287
01:35:25,474 --> 01:35:27,635
[SPEAKER_05]: I never did play the beta, so I don't know if it's actually that good.

1288
01:35:27,855 --> 01:35:29,397
[SPEAKER_05]: I got in the beta and never played it.

1289
01:35:29,437 --> 01:35:30,417
[SPEAKER_05]: You dumbass.

1290
01:35:30,637 --> 01:35:31,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I do that a lot.

1291
01:35:31,598 --> 01:35:32,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have played it.

1292
01:35:32,339 --> 01:35:33,359
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't get in the beta.

1293
01:35:33,399 --> 01:35:34,240
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't try hard enough.

1294
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:35,861
[SPEAKER_05]: I meant to, but then it expired.

1295
01:35:35,881 --> 01:35:37,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I didn't realize the beta was coming out so soon.

1296
01:35:37,862 --> 01:35:39,563
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming out like the end of May.

1297
01:35:39,764 --> 01:35:41,345
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a commercial for it on TV the other day.

1298
01:35:41,765 --> 01:35:43,906
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm seeing more and more PlayStation commercials on TV.

1299
01:35:43,967 --> 01:35:44,487
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up with that?

1300
01:35:45,854 --> 01:35:46,714
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what you got for us?

1301
01:36:15,323 --> 01:36:17,045
[SPEAKER_09]: I have some stuff, Rob.

1302
01:36:17,425 --> 01:36:20,529
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet it's not as cool as every freaking Mega Man boss at once.

1303
01:36:21,209 --> 01:36:26,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Sims 3 is coming to PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS this fall.

1304
01:36:30,846 --> 01:36:39,434
[SPEAKER_09]: EA is working on console versions and should have different features like Karma Power depending on whether you can get lucky or have epic fail.

1305
01:36:40,374 --> 01:36:41,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1306
01:36:42,436 --> 01:36:46,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Which actually still reminds me that I need to completely uninstall all my Sims 3 stuff.

1307
01:36:47,601 --> 01:36:47,781
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1308
01:36:47,801 --> 01:36:50,003
[SPEAKER_09]: I spilled water all over myself.

1309
01:36:51,384 --> 01:36:52,845
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a big boy, Rob.

1310
01:36:53,245 --> 01:36:54,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I need a sippy cup.

1311
01:36:55,227 --> 01:36:55,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I could go get you one.

1312
01:36:56,428 --> 01:36:57,649
[SPEAKER_06]: He's getting wet over that news.

1313
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:03,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally, I just got wet over the Mega Man news I'll be right back, I need a towel

1314
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:11,223
[SPEAKER_09]: So also, though, coming up for Rock Band, we have new download content.

1315
01:37:11,263 --> 01:37:26,091
[SPEAKER_09]: We have No Doubt's Tragic Kingdom to download, which are basically all... We have the songs on there, including different people, and ended on this, Happy Now, See You Then, 16, The Climb, Tragic Kingdom, World Go Round, and You Can Do It.

1316
01:37:26,191 --> 01:37:32,454
[SPEAKER_09]: And then individual songs is Orianthe, According to You, and Picture Me Broken, Dearest, I'm So Sorry.

1317
01:37:34,205 --> 01:37:39,330
[SPEAKER_09]: and then we also have our UK download games.

1318
01:37:40,011 --> 01:37:43,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to mention what's coming out, it's Hamster Ball for PlayStation 3.

1319
01:37:45,636 --> 01:37:49,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Hamster Ball, which looks kind of Monkey Ball-like to me.

1320
01:37:52,213 --> 01:37:56,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Alpha Bounce for DSiWare 500 points The Will of Dr. Frankenstein for WiiWare Nintendo 64ish

1321
01:38:14,022 --> 01:38:42,731
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's actually a cut down version of The Island of Dr. Frankenstein and then we've got a few others there's Earthworm Jim for DSiWare 500 points which you know it's freaking Earthworm Jim so hey I loved Earthworm Jim it was cute I loved how the titles credits would burp sound like me earlier in the show tonight we have Lead and Gold Gangs of the Wild West which is for PlayStation Network and Steam that would do it

1322
01:38:44,253 --> 01:38:46,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get into some Twitter topics!

1323
01:38:48,597 --> 01:38:55,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week we solicit your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR and we like to pick some of our favorite tweets and read them here on the show.

1324
01:38:56,463 --> 01:38:57,564
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's get into the tweets.

1325
01:38:58,264 --> 01:39:02,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta admit, they're not always on topic, you guys, but whatever.

1326
01:39:03,368 --> 01:39:04,029
[SPEAKER_05]: We're flexible.

1327
01:39:05,301 --> 01:39:14,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, let's see, Sutur in Twitter says, uh, what I've been playing, Harvest Moon, Hero of Leaf Valley, fun, but frequent, though short loading screens.

1328
01:39:15,028 --> 01:39:16,168
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think of Harvest Moon?

1329
01:39:17,069 --> 01:39:24,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried to get into that series on the GameCube, I think there was a game on the GameCube, I couldn't really get into it, I don't know, like, I was just more into Animal Crossing, I wasn't...

1330
01:39:25,538 --> 01:39:26,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it was too much.

1331
01:39:26,119 --> 01:39:26,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Fun with cows!

1332
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:28,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it was too much micromanaging for me.

1333
01:39:28,902 --> 01:39:30,765
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's one of those games I really need to give another shot.

1334
01:39:30,845 --> 01:39:32,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't think I gave it a fair shot, to be honest.

1335
01:39:32,327 --> 01:39:33,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Fun with cows!

1336
01:39:33,548 --> 01:39:36,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you play, uh... No, you know, Jessica played it a whole bunch.

1337
01:39:36,693 --> 01:39:37,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's right!

1338
01:39:37,313 --> 01:39:38,755
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would hang over.

1339
01:39:38,855 --> 01:39:41,238
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was just like, look, my cow loves me!

1340
01:39:41,619 --> 01:39:41,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1341
01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:43,321
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are awesome.

1342
01:39:43,361 --> 01:39:43,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you agree?

1343
01:40:04,269 --> 01:40:04,429
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1344
01:40:04,810 --> 01:40:05,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Most days.

1345
01:40:06,213 --> 01:40:08,918
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm awesome every day, Rob.

1346
01:40:08,998 --> 01:40:11,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Knights of Blaze says, here's Twitter topic for tonight.

1347
01:40:11,723 --> 01:40:13,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Blur or split second?

1348
01:40:13,447 --> 01:40:14,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Which will be better?

1349
01:40:14,549 --> 01:40:15,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Split second.

1350
01:40:16,294 --> 01:40:17,335
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1351
01:40:38,769 --> 01:40:42,537
[SPEAKER_05]: They both look awesome to me, but I'm gonna say Blur just because it's the one Loki didn't pick.

1352
01:40:43,519 --> 01:40:44,762
[SPEAKER_05]: So now it's officially a tie.

1353
01:40:45,243 --> 01:40:48,170
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll let Dan get whatever he wants to and then I'll go, oh that's neat.

1354
01:40:48,562 --> 01:40:51,404
[SPEAKER_05]: One for Blur, one for Split Second, one for I don't give a fuck.

1355
01:40:52,124 --> 01:40:58,609
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you have a game that looks like Burnout with explosions, or you have Mario Kart meets Project Gotham.

1356
01:40:59,750 --> 01:41:00,150
[SPEAKER_06]: It's tough.

1357
01:41:00,790 --> 01:41:01,211
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tough.

1358
01:41:01,671 --> 01:41:02,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Both games look good, actually.

1359
01:41:03,272 --> 01:41:03,732
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll see.

1360
01:41:03,852 --> 01:41:05,994
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, a lot of it has to do with the controls, too.

1361
01:41:06,474 --> 01:41:07,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep that in mind.

1362
01:41:07,635 --> 01:41:08,395
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see how they control.

1363
01:41:08,455 --> 01:41:09,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Blur controls pretty good.

1364
01:41:09,416 --> 01:41:13,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll check out Split Second soon, but I remember playing it at E3 last year, and it was pretty cool.

1365
01:41:13,439 --> 01:41:15,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if they'll have the same damn demo this year.

1366
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:17,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, the game will be out by E3 this year, right?

1367
01:41:17,381 --> 01:41:18,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Game's out pretty soon.

1368
01:41:20,103 --> 01:41:22,846
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw sends us a couple stories.

1369
01:41:22,886 --> 01:41:25,888
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go ahead and read this one here because the other one I think Bobby got on his show.

1370
01:41:25,908 --> 01:41:26,969
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk about this one here.

1371
01:41:30,693 --> 01:41:31,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I love this.

1372
01:41:32,494 --> 01:41:34,216
[SPEAKER_05]: This is so appropriate what TigerClaw sent us.

1373
01:41:34,516 --> 01:41:44,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently a couple of game testers at Activision, as identified by one of the vending machines in the background, they had a speed eating competition of the KFC Double Down.

1374
01:41:45,405 --> 01:42:09,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Polishing it off in 57.97 seconds That's just under a minute Apparently it was sent in some type of video over to Kotaku Not yet verified by Twin Galaxies, lol So there it is, you can actually see the guys eating the Double Down And these little bastards are skinny That's what I don't like Like if I ate that Double Down in 60 seconds, I would gain weight These little bastards are still skinny

1375
01:42:11,323 --> 01:42:12,064
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys can go to hell.

1376
01:42:12,605 --> 01:42:12,885
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1377
01:42:14,627 --> 01:42:15,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just jealous.

1378
01:42:16,129 --> 01:42:16,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1379
01:42:17,851 --> 01:42:24,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Sponchtwang says, Can anyone make me anything OLR slash gamer related I can wear on my 5K race in a couple weeks?

1380
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:27,102
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm already going to wear a PokeWalker.

1381
01:42:28,383 --> 01:42:28,724
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1382
01:42:28,784 --> 01:42:31,447
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura is the seamstress of the bunch.

1383
01:42:32,626 --> 01:42:53,841
[SPEAKER_05]: I can make you a keychain I don't know if Misty is still in the business of making OLR like keychains and stuff but you might want to try talking to Misty because I know she used to have some of that stuff like you know beateries and necklaces and things like that as far as like official shirts yeah I've been talking about that for years nothing yet nothing yet maybe soon

1384
01:42:55,482 --> 01:42:56,123
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya

1385
01:43:20,342 --> 01:43:21,804
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1386
01:43:40,689 --> 01:43:42,371
[SPEAKER_05]: BlackWolf suggests rearview mirror.

1387
01:43:42,651 --> 01:43:43,352
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of like that.

1388
01:43:44,113 --> 01:43:44,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1389
01:43:45,394 --> 01:43:49,638
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya said he's not totally... I like that rose-colored rearview mirror.

1390
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:52,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's see.

1391
01:43:52,782 --> 01:43:59,769
[SPEAKER_05]: BlueSwim sends us a tweet saying, Rob, are you going to get behind the Bieber ruined Twitter trending topic?

1392
01:44:00,189 --> 01:44:01,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy that people are revolting.

1393
01:44:02,190 --> 01:44:12,913
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I'm just ahead of my time because I commented on that whole thing a couple weeks ago about how I don't want to use Twitter anymore because I really can't justify using a site that Justin Bieber is a trending topic on every single day.

1394
01:44:13,733 --> 01:44:15,613
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm glad that people are finally revolting.

1395
01:44:15,713 --> 01:44:20,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Take back Twitter from Justin Bieber and all his freaking mouthy fans.

1396
01:44:21,655 --> 01:44:22,495
[SPEAKER_05]: And there you have it.

1397
01:44:22,515 --> 01:44:23,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are Twitter topics for tonight.

1398
01:44:23,996 --> 01:44:25,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1399
01:44:25,976 --> 01:44:26,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Or just ignore it.

1400
01:44:28,504 --> 01:44:31,025
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1401
01:44:51,604 --> 01:44:54,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Bungie has entered in a 10 year partnership with Activision

1402
01:45:11,792 --> 01:45:18,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, apparently they're going to publish all games based on Bungie's next big action game universe.

1403
01:45:19,038 --> 01:45:25,503
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're looking to publish on multiple platforms, so it's no longer going to be Xbox exclusive anymore.

1404
01:45:26,343 --> 01:45:26,483
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

1405
01:45:28,447 --> 01:45:29,327
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of makes you wonder.

1406
01:45:29,747 --> 01:45:31,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Bungie, have you not been reading the news?

1407
01:45:32,108 --> 01:45:32,968
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously?

1408
01:45:32,988 --> 01:45:35,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but there's a huge difference, Loki.

1409
01:45:36,049 --> 01:45:37,969
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you made the mistake a lot of people are making.

1410
01:45:38,289 --> 01:45:40,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Activision did not buy Bungie.

1411
01:45:41,550 --> 01:45:43,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Activision has a publishing deal with Bungie.

1412
01:45:44,071 --> 01:45:46,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Activision is basically getting free money out of this deal.

1413
01:45:46,531 --> 01:45:52,333
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, all they're doing, they're putting out, you know, they'll do the marketing and they'll do everything outside the actual development of the game.

1414
01:45:52,353 --> 01:45:53,773
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what this agreement's all about.

1415
01:45:55,262 --> 01:45:57,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I honestly don't think this is a big deal.

1416
01:45:57,403 --> 01:45:59,884
[SPEAKER_05]: If Activision had bought Bungie, then yes.

1417
01:45:59,984 --> 01:46:02,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh, Doom and Gloom, Bungie, what are you smoking?

1418
01:46:02,205 --> 01:46:03,986
[SPEAKER_05]: You all are high.

1419
01:46:04,306 --> 01:46:06,327
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just a publishing deal.

1420
01:46:06,627 --> 01:46:08,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they had to sign with somebody.

1421
01:46:09,088 --> 01:46:10,308
[SPEAKER_05]: They weren't going to self-publish.

1422
01:46:10,609 --> 01:46:15,511
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's funny is Bungie's Harold Ryan looks like Brendan Fraser.

1423
01:46:15,631 --> 01:46:17,692
[SPEAKER_06]: He even has that really creepy smile.

1424
01:46:18,692 --> 01:46:20,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't realize Brendan Fraser had a creepy smile.

1425
01:46:21,193 --> 01:46:46,137
[SPEAKER_06]: and he's just creepy all around um so yeah so they're gonna be publishing their next game no word exactly on what the next game is actually gonna be but that will probably be coming up at E3 probably at E3 and then also probably gonna help uh with that void of people that hate on Activision right now although I can't imagine it's gonna really affect their sales that much including uh the Call of Duty franchise because people bitch but people still buy

1426
01:46:48,405 --> 01:46:53,731
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be interesting to know about this agreement if the Final Cut arrangement is still with Bungie.

1427
01:46:53,751 --> 01:46:55,072
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Final Cut, so to speak.

1428
01:46:55,452 --> 01:46:58,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if Activision gets to make changes to games they want to publish.

1429
01:46:58,235 --> 01:47:00,197
[SPEAKER_05]: I doubt that's in the agreement.

1430
01:47:00,237 --> 01:47:02,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of Bungie, I imagine, got to do whatever the hell they wanted with this.

1431
01:47:03,581 --> 01:47:05,523
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think this is going to be bad news at all.

1432
01:47:06,364 --> 01:47:06,844
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't.

1433
01:47:07,905 --> 01:47:27,025
[SPEAKER_05]: and I've been as critical of Activision as the next guy and so forth but I just think this is just Bungie had to sign with someone and Activision makes as good of a sense as anyone else if it had been EA people would have still been like oh my god I can't believe it it could have been Konami and it would have been oh my god doesn't matter

1434
01:47:29,181 --> 01:47:29,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Pick one.

1435
01:47:46,288 --> 01:47:49,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Square Enix Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy VI Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy VI

1436
01:48:15,646 --> 01:48:16,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1437
01:48:30,817 --> 01:48:58,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Shinji Hashimoto was quoted on Twitter saying that they are undecided about a downloadable port of Second Densetsu 3 and the mobile RPG Everheart Odyssey and then he also said for Final Fantasy 5 and 6 there are technical issues as well so at present these are also undecided not sure what those technical issues are I wonder if it's space because if you think about it 4 was a much shorter game than 5 and 6 and I wonder if they maybe have just maxed out those damn cartridges

1438
01:49:00,430 --> 01:49:00,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't think so.

1439
01:49:00,990 --> 01:49:01,471
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1440
01:49:01,611 --> 01:49:02,351
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

1441
01:49:04,953 --> 01:49:10,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Amiga777 in chat says, Square Enix, spare us the FMV theatrics and give us some awesome gameplay.

1442
01:49:11,178 --> 01:49:11,598
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.

1443
01:49:11,638 --> 01:49:17,302
[SPEAKER_05]: I would sacrifice the full motion theatrics for some Uber 3D-ness, but I don't know.

1444
01:49:18,183 --> 01:49:23,087
[SPEAKER_05]: At the same time, I'm okay if they spend the resources just developing something new, you know?

1445
01:49:24,127 --> 01:49:25,088
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1446
01:49:25,208 --> 01:49:30,350
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm torn because the 3 and 4 remakes were pretty hot, but at the same time, I'm not like, ah, they need to do 5 and 6.

1447
01:49:30,671 --> 01:49:41,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, you know, if you just want to, I don't know, port, say, for example, 4, 5, and 6 onto a DS cartridge and don't even worry about upgrading it, I'd be fine with that.

1448
01:49:41,936 --> 01:49:43,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's something they're going to do for the 3DS.

1449
01:49:44,258 --> 01:49:44,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm?

1450
01:49:46,439 --> 01:49:46,759
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1451
01:49:48,038 --> 01:49:53,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright guys, well we are going to get into a segment here on the show called Listless!

1452
01:49:55,145 --> 01:49:56,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay, Listless!

1453
01:49:59,090 --> 01:50:05,136
[SPEAKER_05]: And for tonight's Listless, we gotta get one of our friends here on the phone, so we're gonna make a little outbound call right now.

1454
01:50:05,543 --> 01:50:11,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight's listless topic, what Capcom vs. series should they do next?

1455
01:50:11,587 --> 01:50:15,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Does somebody want to explain listless, how listless works, while I give our guest a call tonight?

1456
01:50:16,369 --> 01:50:21,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the way that it works is that we go around, all of us, and we each pick a game.

1457
01:50:21,873 --> 01:50:27,396
[SPEAKER_09]: We pick three of them in order, or pick a subject, you know, something that we would like to be on the list.

1458
01:50:27,436 --> 01:50:29,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a game tonight, but something, yeah.

1459
01:50:29,677 --> 01:50:39,868
[SPEAKER_09]: and then what happens is we leave it to the chat room to pick well we each take one off of the list and then we leave it to the chat room to pick the winner

1460
01:50:40,393 --> 01:50:45,054
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, so if you want to help vote for the winner, and remember guys, this is the definitive list.

1461
01:50:45,754 --> 01:50:48,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Once this list is written, there's no arguing.

1462
01:50:48,334 --> 01:50:48,815
[SPEAKER_05]: It's done.

1463
01:50:49,735 --> 01:50:50,875
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the definitive list.

1464
01:50:51,155 --> 01:50:52,795
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a highly scientific process.

1465
01:50:53,155 --> 01:50:57,336
[SPEAKER_05]: But in order to play the game, we need four people, so we're going to call up a special guest right now.

1466
01:50:58,796 --> 01:51:01,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me down the music here while we give our guest a call here.

1467
01:51:01,537 --> 01:51:02,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully he's standing by.

1468
01:51:02,557 --> 01:51:03,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I told him it would be 8 o'clock.

1469
01:51:05,637 --> 01:51:08,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, we'll just open it up to somebody else on Skype, I suppose.

1470
01:51:10,914 --> 01:51:11,534
[SPEAKER_05]: One ringy dingy.

1471
01:51:12,415 --> 01:51:13,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Live radio, it's fun.

1472
01:51:13,415 --> 01:51:14,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Two ringy dingys.

1473
01:51:18,637 --> 01:51:19,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch, he's not going to pick up.

1474
01:51:26,059 --> 01:51:26,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

1475
01:51:26,699 --> 01:51:27,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi!

1476
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:28,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this John?

1477
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:29,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, who's this?

1478
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:31,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, it's Crazy Radio Guy.

1479
01:51:31,441 --> 01:51:32,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, John.

1480
01:51:32,721 --> 01:51:34,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hey, I totally forgot you were calling.

1481
01:51:34,762 --> 01:51:35,182
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on and off.

1482
01:51:36,738 --> 01:51:38,539
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1483
01:52:07,675 --> 01:52:12,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you know that one of your old co-hosts said that I sound like a straight version of you?

1484
01:52:14,541 --> 01:52:15,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Who is that?

1485
01:52:15,342 --> 01:52:15,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Jenna?

1486
01:52:15,702 --> 01:52:17,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Jessica?

1487
01:52:17,964 --> 01:52:18,905
[SPEAKER_05]: When was she on the show?

1488
01:52:18,925 --> 01:52:19,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Jessica.

1489
01:52:19,846 --> 01:52:22,548
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't talked to her in years.

1490
01:52:22,648 --> 01:52:25,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever I take off from USL, she's going to be hosting for me now.

1491
01:52:26,011 --> 01:52:26,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.

1492
01:52:27,692 --> 01:52:29,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, how come I wasn't invited to be a guest host?

1493
01:52:29,614 --> 01:52:30,235
[SPEAKER_05]: I see how it is.

1494
01:52:30,455 --> 01:52:31,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay.

1495
01:52:31,216 --> 01:52:31,617
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

1496
01:52:31,997 --> 01:52:33,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, you can bring that up with Travis.

1497
01:52:33,799 --> 01:52:34,460
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I will.

1498
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:34,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I will.

1499
01:52:35,221 --> 01:52:35,461
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1500
01:52:35,841 --> 01:52:39,125
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to make my Star Trek Online character just to find Travis and beat the shit out of him.

1501
01:52:39,345 --> 01:52:40,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Was Travis a human?

1502
01:52:40,566 --> 01:52:41,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to be a Klingon.

1503
01:52:41,968 --> 01:52:42,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1504
01:52:42,428 --> 01:52:43,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't play Star Trek Online.

1505
01:52:43,690 --> 01:52:44,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I play WoW.

1506
01:52:44,651 --> 01:52:44,931
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1507
01:52:45,271 --> 01:52:49,516
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know because certain somebody named Travis took me off of Facebook.

1508
01:52:51,300 --> 01:52:52,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Travis Donovan, you're a bitch.

1509
01:52:53,301 --> 01:52:54,121
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, punch him in the balls.

1510
01:52:54,141 --> 01:52:55,982
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always a good solution for Travis.

1511
01:52:56,122 --> 01:52:56,683
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, though?

1512
01:52:57,343 --> 01:52:58,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Facebook does weird things.

1513
01:52:59,084 --> 01:53:06,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I've lost friends mysteriously, so he may not have done it on purpose, but if he did, it's got some drama.

1514
01:53:06,428 --> 01:53:07,108
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, here we go.

1515
01:53:07,168 --> 01:53:08,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do this.

1516
01:53:08,909 --> 01:53:12,291
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so, Bressel, you know how... Hey, tell the people in the background to shut up.

1517
01:53:12,791 --> 01:53:14,011
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to do a radio show.

1518
01:53:14,031 --> 01:53:16,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, people in the background, please stop masturbating.

1519
01:53:16,973 --> 01:53:17,373
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1520
01:53:18,794 --> 01:53:20,115
[SPEAKER_05]: How was SakuraCon, by the way?

1521
01:53:20,255 --> 01:53:20,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have fun?

1522
01:53:22,835 --> 01:53:23,695
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot of fun.

1523
01:53:24,416 --> 01:53:25,757
[SPEAKER_02]: I've made a lot of friends.

1524
01:53:25,857 --> 01:53:27,959
[SPEAKER_02]: I've made a lot more friends, and it was just a great time.

1525
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:29,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, you have friends?

1526
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:30,881
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely look forward to 2011.

1527
01:53:31,001 --> 01:53:32,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut the fuck up, dude.

1528
01:53:35,645 --> 01:53:36,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, good times, good times.

1529
01:53:36,686 --> 01:53:37,026
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this?

1530
01:53:37,067 --> 01:53:39,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Aren't we supposed to be playing a game online soon or something?

1531
01:53:41,170 --> 01:53:41,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Was I what?

1532
01:53:42,271 --> 01:53:42,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind.

1533
01:53:43,192 --> 01:53:43,472
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1534
01:53:44,884 --> 01:53:46,785
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I was talking about something I'm not supposed to talk about yet.

1535
01:53:46,825 --> 01:53:47,085
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1536
01:53:48,866 --> 01:53:49,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into something else.

1537
01:53:50,267 --> 01:53:51,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Get into the list list.

1538
01:53:51,868 --> 01:53:57,591
[SPEAKER_05]: You know tonight's topic is what Capcom versus series, or should I say versus Capcom series, should they do next?

1539
01:53:59,853 --> 01:54:02,254
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to go around and get your top three answers.

1540
01:54:02,314 --> 01:54:03,715
[SPEAKER_05]: And Breslow, we'll start with you.

1541
01:54:03,755 --> 01:54:05,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Your number three answer.

1542
01:54:05,176 --> 01:54:08,518
[SPEAKER_05]: What Capcom versus series should they do next?

1543
01:54:09,614 --> 01:54:14,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm throwing the political card on here because I think this is the most important one since I get to go first.

1544
01:54:14,718 --> 01:54:15,999
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm surprised they haven't done this.

1545
01:54:16,060 --> 01:54:17,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Capcom versus Midway.

1546
01:54:20,461 --> 01:54:22,662
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what do you want to pick for your number three answer?

1547
01:54:51,631 --> 01:55:08,623
[SPEAKER_09]: McDonaldland vs. Capcom Mayor McCheese and the Grimace and the Fry Guys I fucking love it, the Grimace and Birdie the Early Bird

1548
01:55:10,663 --> 01:55:11,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

1549
01:55:11,223 --> 01:55:13,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever happened to the McDonaldland characters?

1550
01:55:13,584 --> 01:55:14,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut off, hello?

1551
01:55:14,465 --> 01:55:14,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

1552
01:55:14,925 --> 01:55:15,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

1553
01:55:15,325 --> 01:55:15,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Breslow?

1554
01:55:16,485 --> 01:55:16,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1555
01:55:17,086 --> 01:55:17,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1556
01:55:17,906 --> 01:55:21,567
[SPEAKER_05]: It's McDonaldland versus Capcom, is what it is.

1557
01:55:22,328 --> 01:55:23,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, our stream?

1558
01:55:23,448 --> 01:55:25,729
[SPEAKER_09]: I want Mayor McCheese as the boss.

1559
01:55:25,909 --> 01:55:32,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently our stream died, and our thing is trying to reconnect right now, so... But we're gonna keep recording for podcast's sake.

1560
01:55:33,132 --> 01:55:37,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit, but now our chatters can't hear to vote, so... We're gonna hope... Yeah.

1561
01:55:38,334 --> 01:55:39,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Midway vs. Capcom, McDonaldland vs. Capcom

1562
01:55:54,813 --> 01:56:16,421
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to be slightly serious here, so this is kind of obscure for people who don't remember him, but Paul Robertson versus Capcom, and to explain who Paul Robertson is, he's the guy that did the animation Pirate Babies Cabana Street Fight, and then also some... Yes, that animation was such an amazing thing.

1563
01:56:17,085 --> 01:56:23,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly, and like Devil Eyes and just like all sorts of crazy ass 8-bit animation stuff.

1564
01:56:23,170 --> 01:56:25,031
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that would be kind of cool.

1565
01:56:26,232 --> 01:56:27,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, fair enough.

1566
01:56:27,733 --> 01:56:29,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Paul Robertson vs. Capcom?

1567
01:56:30,075 --> 01:56:32,837
[SPEAKER_06]: It's better than Pirate Baby's Cabana Street Fight vs. Capcom.

1568
01:56:33,978 --> 01:56:38,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, my number three answer, I have picked Saturday Night Live vs. Capcom.

1569
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:41,360
[SPEAKER_05]: S.N.L.

1570
01:56:41,380 --> 01:56:42,601
[SPEAKER_05]: vs. Capcom S.N.L.

1571
01:56:42,641 --> 01:56:43,042
[SPEAKER_05]: vs. Capcom

1572
01:57:01,394 --> 01:57:01,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I did!

1573
01:57:02,135 --> 01:57:08,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I beat the crap out of all the crappy skits they've done from like 97 to 2003.

1574
01:57:08,738 --> 01:57:09,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, it'd be fun.

1575
01:57:10,219 --> 01:57:26,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, your number two answer, Breslow, and just to catch the folks up joining us because the feed was down, so far we have Midway vs. Capcom, McDonaldland vs. Capcom, Paul Robertson vs. Capcom, and Saturday Night Live vs. Capcom.

1576
01:57:27,389 --> 01:57:29,891
[SPEAKER_05]: What is your number two answer, Breslow?

1577
01:57:30,373 --> 01:57:31,254
[SPEAKER_05]: How bad are you?

1578
01:57:31,294 --> 01:57:35,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus vs. Capcom I will do Bible vs. Capcom God would be the end boss

1579
01:57:58,203 --> 01:57:59,865
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1580
01:58:22,687 --> 01:58:25,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to change one of my answers because of your SNL thing.

1581
01:58:25,509 --> 01:58:26,149
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta top that.

1582
01:58:49,895 --> 01:58:51,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Although that would be my number one answer.

1583
01:58:52,096 --> 01:58:53,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's going to be a semi-serious one.

1584
01:58:54,157 --> 01:58:55,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Konami vs. Capcom.

1585
01:58:55,657 --> 01:59:00,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they have a lot of good 8-bit characters that would be pretty awesome to bring over.

1586
01:59:01,159 --> 01:59:02,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Different Contra characters.

1587
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:05,761
[SPEAKER_06]: You can put Frogger in there if you want.

1588
01:59:07,342 --> 01:59:08,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Castlevania.

1589
01:59:08,542 --> 01:59:10,803
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be pretty awesome.

1590
01:59:10,863 --> 01:59:14,624
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also going to go with the super freaking obvious.

1591
01:59:14,704 --> 01:59:15,345
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to do...

1592
01:59:16,965 --> 01:59:17,866
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a jackass, Rob Roberts!

1593
01:59:38,587 --> 01:59:44,490
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, hello, Mario, Samus, Pit, all the Super Smash Bros.

1594
01:59:44,530 --> 01:59:46,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Melee characters versus Capcom.

1595
01:59:46,792 --> 01:59:48,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, why is this not happening?

1596
01:59:49,349 --> 01:59:49,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Duh!

1597
01:59:50,770 --> 01:59:51,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1598
01:59:51,971 --> 01:59:53,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like I took your answer, didn't I, Breslol?

1599
01:59:55,073 --> 01:59:55,294
[SPEAKER_02]: You did.

1600
01:59:55,534 --> 01:59:56,014
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad.

1601
01:59:56,034 --> 01:59:57,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, do you have a backup answer?

1602
01:59:57,195 --> 01:59:59,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we're ready for your number one answer.

1603
01:59:59,497 --> 02:00:01,458
[SPEAKER_05]: So far, let me recap while you think.

1604
02:00:01,879 --> 02:00:14,348
[SPEAKER_05]: So far, the list is Midway vs. Capcom, McDonaldland vs. Capcom, Paul Robertson vs. Capcom, SNL vs. Capcom, Bible vs. Capcom, Arc System Works vs. Capcom, Konami vs. Capcom, Nintendo vs. Capcom.

1605
02:00:15,349 --> 02:00:16,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Breslol, what is your number one answer?

1606
02:00:19,002 --> 02:00:26,644
[SPEAKER_05]: all games versus Capcom all games versus Capcom would you be one of the fighters in all games versus Capcom?

1607
02:00:27,804 --> 02:00:32,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I would and so would you and your special move would be to bitch slap people silly what would my special move be?

1608
02:00:34,586 --> 02:00:38,767
[SPEAKER_02]: it would be to bitch slap people silly what would DarkSakura's special move be?

1609
02:00:40,747 --> 02:00:45,408
[SPEAKER_02]: um throwing Guinness bombs at people and Loki?

1610
02:00:47,409 --> 02:00:47,509
[SPEAKER_02]: um

1611
02:00:49,062 --> 02:00:55,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Throwing his number 7 ranking of DPA, what's it called, at everybody.

1612
02:00:56,928 --> 02:00:57,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1613
02:00:59,170 --> 02:01:02,513
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, it's time for your number 1 answer.

1614
02:01:02,533 --> 02:01:04,355
[SPEAKER_05]: What is your number 1 answer, Blank vs. Capcom?

1615
02:01:05,115 --> 02:01:05,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Taito.

1616
02:01:07,457 --> 02:01:13,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Could you imagine Bob and Bob getting, like, Hadouken?

1617
02:01:14,343 --> 02:01:15,464
[SPEAKER_05]: What would their special move be?

1618
02:01:15,504 --> 02:01:16,845
[SPEAKER_05]: They just trap the opponent in a bubble?

1619
02:01:17,751 --> 02:01:18,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and Pop'Em.

1620
02:01:19,593 --> 02:01:20,333
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be fun.

1621
02:01:20,954 --> 02:01:26,058
[SPEAKER_09]: And they could have special attacks like the water bubble.

1622
02:01:29,241 --> 02:01:30,121
[SPEAKER_09]: We're recording this.

1623
02:01:30,162 --> 02:01:32,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, it's only porn if you tape it.

1624
02:01:32,123 --> 02:01:34,005
[SPEAKER_05]: John, blow your rape whistle.

1625
02:01:34,685 --> 02:01:35,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, back to the show.

1626
02:01:36,927 --> 02:01:38,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else you want to say about Tidal vs. Capcom?

1627
02:01:39,089 --> 02:01:39,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Rainbow Islands.

1628
02:01:40,370 --> 02:01:42,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, your number one answer, please.

1629
02:01:42,532 --> 02:01:47,776
[SPEAKER_06]: My number one answer is very obvious considering the SNL thing.

1630
02:01:48,456 --> 02:01:50,538
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Nick at Night versus Capcom.

1631
02:01:51,198 --> 02:01:55,422
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, it's awesome because you have a fighting game with Bill Cosby.

1632
02:01:55,902 --> 02:01:56,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll murder you.

1633
02:01:57,242 --> 02:01:59,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Will Smith from the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.

1634
02:01:59,783 --> 02:02:00,963
[SPEAKER_05]: John, shut the fuck up.

1635
02:02:01,643 --> 02:02:05,304
[SPEAKER_02]: You're interrupting a professionally done radio show by raping me.

1636
02:02:05,444 --> 02:02:06,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want you to know this.

1637
02:02:06,745 --> 02:02:07,565
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a bad idea.

1638
02:02:07,585 --> 02:02:09,645
[SPEAKER_09]: This is totally going in the best of later on.

1639
02:02:10,966 --> 02:02:17,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, do you think you could stop getting your asshole raped by a woman in time to do this show here?

1640
02:02:18,427 --> 02:02:21,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, the worst part is I'm getting my asshole raped by a man.

1641
02:02:21,548 --> 02:02:22,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, that's nothing new.

1642
02:02:23,129 --> 02:02:24,449
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Loki.

1643
02:02:26,065 --> 02:02:27,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Nick at Night vs. Capcom.

1644
02:02:27,806 --> 02:02:32,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and I think the Golden Girls was on there one time, so that would be pretty awesome.

1645
02:02:33,210 --> 02:02:35,652
[SPEAKER_09]: But the monkeys were on there, and could you imagine that fight?

1646
02:02:35,752 --> 02:02:36,893
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be pretty awesome.

1647
02:02:37,113 --> 02:02:39,115
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as Bea Arthur is a character, I'm fine.

1648
02:02:40,096 --> 02:02:41,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Would Bea Arthur be a character?

1649
02:02:41,937 --> 02:02:42,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1650
02:02:42,258 --> 02:02:42,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I'm fine.

1651
02:02:43,278 --> 02:02:43,619
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1652
02:02:44,379 --> 02:02:50,945
[SPEAKER_05]: My number one answer, I'm going to totally... Black Wolf says, Cosby's Ultra is serving Puddin' Pop.

1653
02:02:52,225 --> 02:02:52,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Jane vs. Capcom?

1654
02:02:52,746 --> 02:02:54,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Jane vs. Capcom, that would be funny.

1655
02:03:15,495 --> 02:03:17,957
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Joss Whedonverse versus Capcom.

1656
02:03:18,197 --> 02:03:21,220
[SPEAKER_09]: And when he comes out, the first thing he says is, you're damaging my calm.

1657
02:03:22,621 --> 02:03:23,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell me that would not sell.

1658
02:03:23,882 --> 02:03:26,824
[SPEAKER_05]: But we also need the blue... Like, I'll be in my bunk.

1659
02:03:27,505 --> 02:03:33,350
[SPEAKER_09]: But we also need, like, a mid-boss to be, like, the blue hand guys from, you know...

1660
02:03:35,322 --> 02:03:38,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want Elijah Dusku from Dollhouse to be a character because she's hot.

1661
02:03:38,743 --> 02:03:39,023
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1662
02:03:40,784 --> 02:03:41,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

1663
02:03:41,264 --> 02:03:43,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you are not booing me, chat room.

1664
02:03:43,605 --> 02:03:44,005
[SPEAKER_05]: F you.

1665
02:03:45,386 --> 02:03:45,726
[SPEAKER_05]: F you all.

1666
02:03:45,766 --> 02:03:46,026
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1667
02:03:46,826 --> 02:03:48,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Becky just said that you were made of wind.

1668
02:03:48,747 --> 02:03:49,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Becky.

1669
02:03:50,127 --> 02:03:50,408
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1670
02:03:50,428 --> 02:03:51,548
[SPEAKER_05]: See, somebody loves me.

1671
02:03:51,968 --> 02:03:52,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Ass.

1672
02:03:52,588 --> 02:03:52,869
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1673
02:03:53,049 --> 02:03:56,690
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of the suggestions from chat that didn't make the cut.

1674
02:03:58,190 --> 02:03:58,911
[SPEAKER_05]: What the fuck?

1675
02:03:58,971 --> 02:03:59,731
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1676
02:03:59,831 --> 02:04:01,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Doctor Who versus Capcom.

1677
02:04:01,672 --> 02:04:01,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Capcom.

1678
02:04:04,693 --> 02:04:20,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Disney vs. Capcom, Duck Island vs. Capcom, Power Rangers vs. Capcom, Cooking Mama vs. Capcom, Mavis Beacon vs. Capcom, Capcom vs. Capcom, Coco vs. Capcom

1679
02:04:23,077 --> 02:04:24,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, DC vs. Capcom.

1680
02:04:24,678 --> 02:04:24,978
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1681
02:04:26,039 --> 02:04:27,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, it's time now.

1682
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:28,240
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too late.

1683
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:30,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Your suggestions didn't make the cut.

1684
02:04:30,081 --> 02:04:30,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, chat room.

1685
02:04:31,042 --> 02:04:36,084
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of life's tough lessons is that sometimes your opinions don't count.

1686
02:04:36,485 --> 02:04:36,705
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1687
02:04:38,075 --> 02:04:46,061
[SPEAKER_05]: I said it sucks for those guys Midway vs. Capcom McDonaldland vs. Capcom Paul Robertson vs. Capcom SNL vs. Capcom Bible vs. Capcom Arc System Works vs. Capcom Konami vs. Capcom Nintendo vs. Capcom All Games vs. Capcom

1688
02:05:07,378 --> 02:05:15,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Taito vs. Capcom, Nick at Night vs. Capcom, and Whedon vs. Capcom, Brest Lol, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

1689
02:05:17,081 --> 02:05:18,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo vs. Capcom.

1690
02:05:19,001 --> 02:05:20,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you whore.

1691
02:05:20,101 --> 02:05:20,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

1692
02:05:21,742 --> 02:05:23,062
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be hard to go multi-platform.

1693
02:05:23,662 --> 02:05:29,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it would turn into the Capcom characters have to do button combinations, and then you could just spam Falcon Punch.

1694
02:05:31,887 --> 02:05:35,269
[SPEAKER_05]: I suppose I will accept that logic, but you're still an asshole.

1695
02:05:35,369 --> 02:05:37,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, DarkSakura, you're next.

1696
02:05:37,971 --> 02:05:40,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one of these is not worthy of the list?

1697
02:05:40,552 --> 02:05:41,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Bible vs. Capcom.

1698
02:05:43,154 --> 02:05:43,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you just...

1699
02:05:47,097 --> 02:05:49,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Not feeling Jesus is a playable character, huh?

1700
02:05:49,659 --> 02:05:53,942
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really give a crap about Jesus in the game.

1701
02:05:54,182 --> 02:05:55,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, fair enough.

1702
02:05:55,944 --> 02:05:58,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

1703
02:05:59,787 --> 02:06:02,109
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to go with Midway vs. Capcom.

1704
02:06:03,390 --> 02:06:09,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because I've seen the Mugen videos with the Mortal Kombat characters vs. Street Fighter.

1705
02:06:09,655 --> 02:06:11,457
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks weird, okay?

1706
02:06:12,718 --> 02:06:15,060
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they could reanimate him, but it would just be weird.

1707
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:18,725
[SPEAKER_06]: And besides, Midway is no longer around.

1708
02:06:19,927 --> 02:06:20,367
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

1709
02:06:20,387 --> 02:06:21,910
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be kind of hard to get the licensing, wouldn't it?

1710
02:06:22,287 --> 02:06:22,547
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1711
02:06:22,867 --> 02:06:25,888
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as me, which one of these is not worthy of the list?

1712
02:06:25,928 --> 02:06:28,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have to say Paul Robertson versus Capcom.

1713
02:06:28,088 --> 02:06:28,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Too obscure.

1714
02:06:29,049 --> 02:06:29,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Too obscure.

1715
02:06:29,629 --> 02:06:30,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, too obscure.

1716
02:06:31,189 --> 02:06:31,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Loki.

1717
02:06:32,669 --> 02:06:34,170
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it was funny, but too obscure.

1718
02:06:34,430 --> 02:06:35,510
[SPEAKER_05]: See, there's more coming in.

1719
02:06:35,830 --> 02:06:37,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob's mom versus Capcom.

1720
02:06:37,751 --> 02:06:38,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Atlas versus Capcom.

1721
02:06:39,011 --> 02:06:40,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Fallout 3 versus Capcom.

1722
02:06:40,451 --> 02:06:42,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Prop 8 versus Capcom.

1723
02:06:42,992 --> 02:06:45,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1724
02:06:45,693 --> 02:06:45,953
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1725
02:06:46,293 --> 02:06:46,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, wait.

1726
02:06:46,913 --> 02:06:49,173
[SPEAKER_05]: The Hall of Presidents versus Capcom.

1727
02:06:52,501 --> 02:07:14,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Animatronic Presidents vs. Capcom Alright guys, it is now your time to vote You are going to place a vote via private message to Sky With your number 1 and number 2 answers Please label them, number 1 and number 2 answers Here's the list McDonaldland vs. Capcom SNL vs. Capcom Arc System Works vs. Capcom Konami vs. Capcom All Games vs. Capcom Taito vs. Capcom

1728
02:07:14,844 --> 02:07:18,686
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, tune in to USL every Saturday night here on All Games at 8 o'clock Pacific, 11 o'clock Eastern.

1729
02:07:18,706 --> 02:07:21,607
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're not listening to Orange Lodge Radio Live, you're a terrible human being.

1730
02:07:43,908 --> 02:07:45,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you, Breslul.

1731
02:07:46,849 --> 02:07:50,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh, yeah?

1732
02:07:55,011 --> 02:07:55,591
[SPEAKER_05]: He just hung up.

1733
02:07:55,711 --> 02:07:57,411
[SPEAKER_05]: That was his last thing to say.

1734
02:07:57,931 --> 02:07:59,052
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet he thought that was funny.

1735
02:08:01,032 --> 02:08:03,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I hope you get your butthole torn open by that guy.

1736
02:08:04,033 --> 02:08:05,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on.

1737
02:08:08,308 --> 02:08:08,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1738
02:08:09,529 --> 02:08:13,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was the first on-air rape that we had going on during a fun, happy segment.

1739
02:08:13,290 --> 02:08:15,611
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that was the first on-air rape that we've had.

1740
02:08:16,251 --> 02:08:17,572
[SPEAKER_09]: This show is on-air rape.

1741
02:08:17,612 --> 02:08:18,172
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true.

1742
02:08:18,552 --> 02:08:20,413
[SPEAKER_06]: We do kind of rape gaming news every week.

1743
02:08:20,433 --> 02:08:25,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, back in the day when we used to broadcast live during some of those DDR parties.

1744
02:08:25,715 --> 02:08:31,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was on-air rape, and I think that's where Big Black Cock came into play.

1745
02:08:31,938 --> 02:08:32,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1746
02:08:35,617 --> 02:08:36,418
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe in them.

1747
02:08:37,058 --> 02:08:39,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, please, more gaming news.

1748
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:40,680
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, save us.

1749
02:08:41,301 --> 02:08:42,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Help.

1750
02:08:42,301 --> 02:08:48,225
[SPEAKER_09]: For Call of Duty fans, actually the next one coming out has been named.

1751
02:08:48,485 --> 02:08:53,188
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Call of Duty Black Ops coming out on the 9th of November 2010.

1752
02:08:53,248 --> 02:08:55,449
[SPEAKER_09]: That's at least the European date.

1753
02:08:56,950 --> 02:08:58,651
[SPEAKER_09]: And they've confirmed co-op for it.

1754
02:08:58,911 --> 02:09:03,694
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can play with your buddies together killing people.

1755
02:09:04,754 --> 02:09:10,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and that's actually one that I would be interested in, I think, checking out as a Black Ops game.

1756
02:09:10,919 --> 02:09:18,004
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, instead of, you know, full-on face-front combo, you know, combat, you have to be sneaky like Solid Snake.

1757
02:09:20,446 --> 02:09:20,666
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

1758
02:09:22,587 --> 02:09:29,152
[SPEAKER_06]: I, well, I'm sure the fans are just, no, all they're saying is, it's a triarch, Call of Duty, meh.

1759
02:09:31,042 --> 02:09:32,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Red Faction

1760
02:09:42,649 --> 02:09:44,510
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1761
02:10:03,737 --> 02:10:04,638
[SPEAKER_06]: That's scary.

1762
02:10:04,858 --> 02:10:06,800
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, how is this a problem?

1763
02:10:09,161 --> 02:10:10,943
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe you just called this a problem.

1764
02:10:11,143 --> 02:10:12,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's gonna suck.

1765
02:10:12,524 --> 02:10:18,429
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is the rumor I heard that SyFy is like picking up wrestling and stuff now and they're not gonna do those movies anymore.

1766
02:10:18,549 --> 02:10:19,450
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a problem.

1767
02:10:21,465 --> 02:10:22,886
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all just blending together.

1768
02:10:23,026 --> 02:10:25,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Every station does not need wrestling.

1769
02:10:26,407 --> 02:10:33,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless they're dressing up like space aliens or people from Battlestar Galactica, it does not need to be on sci-fi.

1770
02:10:33,310 --> 02:10:36,251
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing science fiction about wrestling except for the plot.

1771
02:10:41,593 --> 02:10:42,353
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell was that?

1772
02:10:47,984 --> 02:10:49,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch the shark through the plane.

1773
02:10:53,547 --> 02:10:54,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah yes.

1774
02:10:54,267 --> 02:10:57,889
[SPEAKER_05]: This looks so fake, I love it.

1775
02:10:58,009 --> 02:11:00,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Condor Airlines.

1776
02:11:03,932 --> 02:11:11,656
[SPEAKER_06]: And they had an image or whatever, a little picture that someone made that talked about what it would take physics-wise for the shark to do that.

1777
02:11:12,096 --> 02:11:13,096
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just retarded.

1778
02:11:16,622 --> 02:11:18,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah yes, high production value right there.

1779
02:11:20,087 --> 02:11:20,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy shit!

1780
02:11:29,099 --> 02:11:31,202
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the kind of stuff you make in like high school.

1781
02:11:31,242 --> 02:11:33,105
[SPEAKER_05]: How dare someone try to take this from me!

1782
02:11:35,396 --> 02:11:36,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Shark eating a plane.

1783
02:11:36,597 --> 02:11:38,478
[SPEAKER_05]: How dare you try to take that out of my life?

1784
02:11:39,179 --> 02:11:47,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, so they're going to be doing possibly an ongoing series as well, if the movie does well.

1785
02:11:47,464 --> 02:12:03,414
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's expected to be coming out early 2011, and we'll see how it turns out, because most movies that are based on video games kind of suck, and this one's done by SyFy, who puts out movies that pretty much always suck, so...

1786
02:12:06,405 --> 02:12:09,319
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it's like a convergence of suck

1787
02:12:13,320 --> 02:12:27,826
[SPEAKER_05]: A convergence of suck, really Yes Alright Well, we'll see what happens Good thing they're not making a movie out of this Because I think it would be kind of boring But apparently somebody has beat Bejeweled 2 Yes, who knew that Bejeweled 2 was beatable?

1788
02:12:27,926 --> 02:12:36,330
[SPEAKER_05]: I sure didn't But Bejeweled 2 got beaten this week after three years That's right, this guy Mike Lady

1789
02:12:37,010 --> 02:13:05,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Ladi, he probably gets called Lady, poor guy Mike Ladi, I'm going to say it's Ladi Apparently beat Bejeweled 2 He played the same game for 2,205 hours and 51 minutes That was a score of 2,147,000,000 points Apparently that's the point where the score display just went to black And there's actually a YouTube of it that's up And PopCap just said, hey, you beat it

1790
02:13:05,811 --> 02:13:06,211
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com

1791
02:13:26,869 --> 02:13:30,530
[SPEAKER_05]: or not because maybe PopCap didn't want to show their game breaking, I don't know.

1792
02:13:31,790 --> 02:13:33,610
[SPEAKER_05]: That was just like a little promotional video.

1793
02:13:33,630 --> 02:13:34,930
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all happy go lucky.

1794
02:13:34,970 --> 02:13:36,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, Bejeweled, we're awesome.

1795
02:13:37,111 --> 02:13:38,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Play us on Facebook.

1796
02:13:39,471 --> 02:13:40,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, somebody broke it.

1797
02:13:40,511 --> 02:13:44,132
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, a kill screen is achievable in Bejeweled 2, but three years?

1798
02:13:44,332 --> 02:13:44,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously?

1799
02:13:45,512 --> 02:13:45,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

1800
02:13:46,272 --> 02:13:46,712
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, right?

1801
02:13:46,872 --> 02:13:47,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

1802
02:13:48,093 --> 02:13:49,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Three years is a long time.

1803
02:13:50,293 --> 02:13:50,813
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, right?

1804
02:13:50,933 --> 02:13:52,753
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was all time when he was supposed to be working.

1805
02:13:55,754 --> 02:13:56,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag!

1806
02:14:00,143 --> 02:14:01,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week you send us emails.

1807
02:14:01,463 --> 02:14:04,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com DarkSakura might read them on air.

1808
02:14:05,284 --> 02:14:05,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1809
02:14:05,624 --> 02:14:08,565
[SPEAKER_05]: And she might decide to say, screw you guys, I'm not reading emails this week.

1810
02:14:08,825 --> 02:14:09,245
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm reading them.

1811
02:14:09,465 --> 02:14:10,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, yay, we caught her in a good mood.

1812
02:14:12,206 --> 02:14:13,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, Orange Lounge Radio.

1813
02:14:13,826 --> 02:14:15,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Haseo here to rant a bit.

1814
02:14:15,767 --> 02:14:20,908
[SPEAKER_09]: First, I'm sorry for spelling errors due to the use of Vicodin after surgery involving knee dislocation.

1815
02:14:21,108 --> 02:14:21,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, sorry.

1816
02:14:22,468 --> 02:14:23,329
[SPEAKER_09]: But you misspelled Vicodin.

1817
02:14:25,029 --> 02:14:25,531
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what though?

1818
02:14:25,611 --> 02:14:28,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say being on Vicodin is an acceptable excuse for bad grammar.

1819
02:14:28,760 --> 02:14:30,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, when you're on Vicodin, you don't care.

1820
02:14:31,875 --> 02:14:32,876
[SPEAKER_09]: We're gonna give them a pass.

1821
02:14:33,317 --> 02:14:34,658
[SPEAKER_09]: You get a pass.

1822
02:14:35,018 --> 02:14:36,640
[SPEAKER_09]: I was really just saying that to be a smartass.

1823
02:14:37,160 --> 02:14:41,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Second, the whole Activision bullshit starting with this whole Infinity Ward leaving the company.

1824
02:14:41,724 --> 02:14:47,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Infinity Ward left Activision and they, as we already know, are the creators of Call of Duty.

1825
02:14:48,351 --> 02:14:55,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, according to G4 and their The Feed service, they say that the next Call of Duty games will be called Call of Duty Black Ops comes out this fall.

1826
02:14:55,738 --> 02:14:56,939
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell is Activision thinking?

1827
02:14:57,339 --> 02:15:00,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially when the Infinity Ward founders left and 35 other team members quit.

1828
02:15:01,082 --> 02:15:07,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and did I mention they're suing Activision for up to $500 million for reasons untold to me.

1829
02:15:08,267 --> 02:15:15,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, Activision, as stupid as they are, they have Bungie, the creators of Halo, sign a 10-year contract.

1830
02:15:15,552 --> 02:15:16,033
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell?

1831
02:15:17,113 --> 02:15:18,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Lastly, three questions for Loki.

1832
02:15:19,535 --> 02:15:18,454
1.

1833
02:15:19,595 --> 02:15:22,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Would it be illegal to infect my aunt's computer with a virus to teach her a lesson? 2.

1834
02:15:23,998 --> 02:15:25,279
[SPEAKER_09]: How would I go about that?

1835
02:15:26,100 --> 02:15:28,022
[SPEAKER_05]: She's a bitch, I mean.

1836
02:15:28,062 --> 02:15:30,123
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not trying to cripple it, only trying to burst her.

1837
02:15:30,264 --> 02:15:33,666
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not to blame for the fucking it up bubble like a warning virus.

1838
02:15:36,809 --> 02:15:38,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Switch her default browser to Internet Explorer.

1839
02:15:38,831 --> 02:15:39,972
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that'll pretty much do it.

1840
02:15:42,173 --> 02:15:43,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Have her use Yahoo Mail.

1841
02:15:44,515 --> 02:15:46,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Just switch her homepage to Two Girls, One Cup.

1842
02:15:48,639 --> 02:15:49,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Lemon Party.

1843
02:15:50,926 --> 02:15:56,851
[SPEAKER_09]: 2.

1844
02:15:51,727 --> 02:15:56,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a way to hack a copy of Final Fantasy XII like you hacked XIII, or do you know of a cheat?

1845
02:15:56,891 --> 02:15:59,514
[SPEAKER_09]: I've beaten it over a year ago, and I want to replay for story.

1846
02:16:01,235 --> 02:16:04,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Loki's a big cheater at XIII, so can you cheat at XII?

1847
02:16:04,958 --> 02:16:08,101
[SPEAKER_06]: XII, I'm not sure if there's a way to hex edit the save.

1848
02:16:08,121 --> 02:16:08,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, maybe.

1849
02:16:08,602 --> 02:16:08,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

1850
02:16:10,541 --> 02:16:11,382
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure there is.

1851
02:16:12,262 --> 02:16:12,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Three.

1852
02:16:13,183 --> 02:16:13,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1853
02:16:14,084 --> 02:16:15,125
[SPEAKER_06]: You just need a game genie.

1854
02:16:15,625 --> 02:16:16,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, really.

1855
02:16:16,606 --> 02:16:19,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a way to hack an imported UMD and change the text to English?

1856
02:16:20,328 --> 02:16:20,509
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1857
02:16:21,009 --> 02:16:21,249
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1858
02:16:22,230 --> 02:16:30,496
[SPEAKER_06]: But, yeah, back to the Final Fantasy XII thing, because it was on PlayStation 2, you could probably just get, like, a GameShark or a Pro Action Replay or something like that if you don't want to cheat in the game.

1859
02:16:33,778 --> 02:16:37,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did Bobby Blackwolf in chat just say two girls, one cup versus Capcom?

1860
02:16:38,523 --> 02:16:40,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Because he's trying to mess with our brains.

1861
02:16:40,764 --> 02:16:41,744
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the cup wins.

1862
02:16:43,245 --> 02:16:45,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for reading my email, and if you don't, what the fuck, people?

1863
02:16:46,066 --> 02:16:50,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Your loyal listener, Haseo Sumiragawa.

1864
02:16:53,188 --> 02:16:53,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Made me.

1865
02:16:53,829 --> 02:16:55,829
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just thinking of the cup winning.

1866
02:16:56,309 --> 02:16:57,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoever wins, we all lose.

1867
02:16:58,351 --> 02:17:07,854
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Robert M. I don't mean to sound like one of those one-nit fanboys, but since it came out, I've been pretty obsessed with WarioWare DIY, even though I'm currently somewhat stagnant at creating new games in it.

1868
02:17:08,294 --> 02:17:16,897
[SPEAKER_09]: For some reason, I actually had a dream where one of my microgames set a record for in-game sales, which somehow made the Orange Challenge Radio show roll.

1869
02:17:17,417 --> 02:17:24,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember Loki saying he didn't get it, meaning the game, and all you did was tap and a character moves up slightly.

1870
02:17:25,880 --> 02:17:27,441
[SPEAKER_09]: This somehow leads to a kernel of thought.

1871
02:17:27,461 --> 02:17:30,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you like to see a series of OLR dream game microgames?

1872
02:17:30,862 --> 02:17:36,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Or would you, of course, prefer these concepts in a more substantial, more readily accessible, less handheld format?

1873
02:17:36,885 --> 02:17:45,469
[SPEAKER_09]: I imagine having Puzzle Sluts or What They Play Snap available in my warehouse might be confusing to other people in my in-game friends list.

1874
02:17:45,669 --> 02:17:46,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good show!

1875
02:18:07,112 --> 02:18:25,503
[SPEAKER_05]: it has to do with a poll that whattheyplay.com ran like a year ago about the most offensive game most offensive thing in video games and like I think homos in games was like more offensive than dismembered heads or something so we suggested that they should make a game about it called whattheyplay.com snap go read about it in the OLR wiki it's all there

1876
02:18:26,627 --> 02:18:28,788
[SPEAKER_09]: This next email just made me snort hard.

1877
02:18:30,429 --> 02:18:31,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yes please, oh my god, yes.

1878
02:18:46,056 --> 02:18:56,499
[SPEAKER_09]: After spending many hours sweating countless buckets and crumbling hundreds of pieces of paper before tossing them in the general direction of a wastebasket, I'm prepared to unveil the following concept, the Golden Girls Death Squad.

1879
02:18:58,080 --> 02:19:01,801
[SPEAKER_09]: The Golden Girls Death Squad will be a four-player cooperative twin-stick shooter.

1880
02:19:02,341 --> 02:19:11,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Each player will assume the likeness of either Dorothy, Rose, Blanche, or Sophia and battle an advancing army of terrorist robots and balding perverted old men in full 180p high definition.

1881
02:19:11,604 --> 02:19:14,065
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I'm about to explode from awesomeness.

1882
02:19:14,545 --> 02:19:15,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob needs to go change his mantis.

1883
02:19:16,346 --> 02:19:16,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

1884
02:19:18,087 --> 02:19:22,490
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll use the left stick to maneuver each girl's technologically advanced mechanical wheelchair.

1885
02:19:23,450 --> 02:19:31,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Each wheelchair is equipped with its own unique weaponry, just as each girl is equipped with wisecracks and quips taken straight from the popular TV show and voiced by the original actresses.

1886
02:19:32,355 --> 02:19:34,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Spoken dialogue varies with context.

1887
02:19:34,236 --> 02:19:36,878
[SPEAKER_09]: When you get close to an enemy, you'll hear Dorothy cry, Have you lost your head?

1888
02:19:37,338 --> 02:19:38,679
[SPEAKER_09]: as she chops off their head with an axe.

1889
02:19:40,254 --> 02:19:40,954
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm crying.

1890
02:19:41,014 --> 02:19:43,175
[SPEAKER_09]: This is so beautiful.

1891
02:19:43,335 --> 02:19:44,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob's red in the face.

1892
02:19:44,355 --> 02:19:45,076
[SPEAKER_09]: This is beautiful.

1893
02:19:46,536 --> 02:19:49,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Each of the seven levels are loosely based on the show's seven seasons.

1894
02:19:49,877 --> 02:19:57,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Boss enemies will include Dorothy's cheating husband, Stanley, evil palette swapped versions of the main characters, and the leader of a cult named High Cholesterol.

1895
02:19:58,760 --> 02:20:04,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Fortunately, you will have rocket launchers, nuclear bombs, exploding calcium supplements as part of your wheelchair arsenal.

1896
02:20:05,353 --> 02:20:21,479
[SPEAKER_09]: The game will feature 4 player simultaneous drop in drop out play over Xbox Live 60 frames per second animation simple and responsive controls motion captured versions of the show's actresses and a driving rock and electronic soundtrack featuring a hard drum and bass mix of the show's opening theme Thank you for being a friend

1897
02:20:22,339 --> 02:20:26,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Development of the game will commence immediately upon our receipt of the rights to the Golden Girls license.

1898
02:20:26,680 --> 02:20:28,020
[SPEAKER_09]: You can help me get that for free, right?

1899
02:20:28,660 --> 02:20:33,421
[SPEAKER_09]: The budget currently allocated for the development of this game consists of the $4 in my wallet.

1900
02:20:33,541 --> 02:20:36,222
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd hate to use it on licensing when I can pick up a sandwich instead.

1901
02:20:36,842 --> 02:20:37,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wait.

1902
02:20:37,442 --> 02:20:39,143
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I just sold a copy of Falling.

1903
02:20:39,423 --> 02:20:40,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Now my budget is $4.70.

1904
02:20:41,003 --> 02:20:41,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, what?

1905
02:20:41,523 --> 02:20:42,723
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to pay tax on sandwiches?

1906
02:20:42,903 --> 02:20:43,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Crap.

1907
02:20:44,144 --> 02:20:44,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well.

1908
02:20:44,464 --> 02:20:45,004
[SPEAKER_05]: You little bitch.

1909
02:20:45,444 --> 02:20:45,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well.

1910
02:20:45,724 --> 02:20:49,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Please look forward to the upcoming release of Sharpshooter, the announcement of future YYR game titles.

1911
02:20:49,825 --> 02:20:50,445
[SPEAKER_09]: All my love, Erin.

1912
02:20:51,584 --> 02:20:53,926
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the pinnacle of awesome email.

1913
02:20:53,966 --> 02:20:58,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, first off, you get a gold medal for awesome email.

1914
02:20:59,149 --> 02:21:01,171
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an official OLR gold star.

1915
02:21:01,211 --> 02:21:03,573
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't get handed out very often, but you just won one, sir.

1916
02:21:04,653 --> 02:21:07,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if that was the biggest tease I've ever heard in my life.

1917
02:21:07,355 --> 02:21:08,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, here it is.

1918
02:21:09,117 --> 02:21:10,818
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to get the licensing.

1919
02:21:11,358 --> 02:21:14,220
[SPEAKER_05]: You just call it Grandma's Got Guns.

1920
02:21:15,961 --> 02:21:17,543
[SPEAKER_05]: And it would sell billions.

1921
02:21:18,462 --> 02:21:22,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Quick poll in chat How many of you would play a game called Grandma's Got Guns?

1922
02:21:25,763 --> 02:21:27,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I want to throw this out here.

1923
02:21:27,945 --> 02:21:30,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody should buy Falling and what's his other game?

1924
02:21:30,888 --> 02:21:33,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Snake360 and the other one, Sharpshooter.

1925
02:21:33,610 --> 02:21:35,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Buy them all immediately when they come out.

1926
02:21:35,752 --> 02:21:36,633
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like a dollar.

1927
02:21:36,733 --> 02:21:37,734
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, what?

1928
02:21:37,774 --> 02:21:39,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Like $3, maybe $4.

1929
02:21:39,155 --> 02:21:39,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember how much.

1930
02:21:39,856 --> 02:21:40,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Snake360 is more.

1931
02:21:41,237 --> 02:21:41,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

1932
02:21:41,697 --> 02:21:44,079
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like less than $10 for all these games.

1933
02:21:44,580 --> 02:21:50,065
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you buy these games, then we will guilt him into making Grandma's Got Guns.

1934
02:21:52,196 --> 02:21:52,636
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1935
02:21:53,177 --> 02:21:56,559
[SPEAKER_05]: And just so you know, I just want Aaron to hear the quick results of our poll and chat.

1936
02:21:57,280 --> 02:22:04,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Me, yes, me, Grandma vs. Capcom, fuck yeah, yes, yes, me, fuck yeah, hi, yes.

1937
02:22:05,486 --> 02:22:06,447
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen a no yet.

1938
02:22:07,908 --> 02:22:13,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, if I made a game with zombies in it, can sell millions of copies, how about I made a game with Grandma in it?

1939
02:22:16,254 --> 02:22:17,055
[SPEAKER_05]: You know you want to do it.

1940
02:22:17,956 --> 02:22:18,236
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1941
02:22:21,334 --> 02:22:22,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I getting pathetic?

1942
02:22:22,375 --> 02:22:24,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this turning into a begging and groveling a bit too much?

1943
02:22:24,717 --> 02:22:25,037
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1944
02:22:25,077 --> 02:22:26,699
[SPEAKER_05]: I just really want to see my grandma game.

1945
02:22:28,520 --> 02:22:28,761
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1946
02:22:29,021 --> 02:22:29,702
[SPEAKER_09]: You're so funny.

1947
02:22:29,962 --> 02:22:30,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1948
02:22:31,303 --> 02:22:31,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1949
02:22:31,843 --> 02:22:36,528
[SPEAKER_09]: This one is from Rababa about Test Drive Unlimited 2.

1950
02:22:36,588 --> 02:22:42,093
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, I was a big fan of the original Test Drive Unlimited and we had an OL Army clubhouse.

1951
02:22:42,153 --> 02:22:43,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Joystick shows the demo reel here.

1952
02:22:45,336 --> 02:22:49,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, it doesn't look like Lost Islands Oahu setting, at least not from the video.

1953
02:22:49,661 --> 02:22:55,108
[SPEAKER_09]: It does look a lot more types of driving events, but the character models are The Sims 2-ish still.

1954
02:22:55,769 --> 02:22:58,572
[SPEAKER_09]: It releases in fall amongst the big titles, so I hope it does well.

1955
02:22:58,672 --> 02:23:00,895
[SPEAKER_09]: I never did get to play my 5,000 miles in the first one.

1956
02:23:01,718 --> 02:23:02,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember Test Drive.

1957
02:23:02,758 --> 02:23:03,818
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a pretty neat game.

1958
02:23:05,559 --> 02:23:08,220
[SPEAKER_05]: It's taken them long enough to kind of put out news of a sequel.

1959
02:23:08,660 --> 02:23:08,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1960
02:23:08,960 --> 02:23:09,840
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll play it if it's good.

1961
02:23:10,440 --> 02:23:14,161
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's going to be tough because there's so many racing games coming out that I'm so interested in, you know.

1962
02:23:14,221 --> 02:23:16,982
[SPEAKER_05]: But, well, that'll be a ways out.

1963
02:23:17,622 --> 02:23:17,962
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way.

1964
02:23:18,342 --> 02:23:18,742
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1965
02:23:19,382 --> 02:23:27,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Going back to the email from YYR, Actdeft says, you can call it Golden Age Grannies Killing Spree.

1966
02:23:28,324 --> 02:23:30,425
[SPEAKER_05]: The prize has to still be cheesecake.

1967
02:23:30,885 --> 02:23:31,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1968
02:23:32,891 --> 02:23:36,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Granny's with a Z. I made a game with Granny's in it.

1969
02:23:36,633 --> 02:23:38,094
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, there was our mailbag.

1970
02:23:38,134 --> 02:23:38,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's time.

1971
02:23:38,974 --> 02:23:39,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Imagine Granny's.

1972
02:23:43,256 --> 02:23:45,237
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this is a little outside of the box for you.

1973
02:23:45,337 --> 02:23:51,940
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this is not a retro game or inspired by other stuff, but I'm telling you, instant cash machine.

1974
02:23:52,340 --> 02:23:53,721
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's get into the FUs of the week.

1975
02:24:10,378 --> 02:24:15,621
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to, um, caffeine withdrawal headaches.

1976
02:24:16,602 --> 02:24:17,723
[SPEAKER_09]: They stink.

1977
02:24:19,544 --> 02:24:20,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1978
02:24:21,245 --> 02:24:21,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki?

1979
02:24:24,266 --> 02:24:32,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I guess F you to my neighbor's bushes for still being alive even after I dumped a half gallon of weed killer on him.

1980
02:24:34,832 --> 02:24:35,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn you, weeds!

1981
02:24:36,218 --> 02:24:39,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I will kill them.

1982
02:24:40,481 --> 02:24:42,022
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really have much of an FU of the week.

1983
02:24:42,102 --> 02:24:44,163
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm, again, in fairly good spirits.

1984
02:24:44,243 --> 02:24:48,986
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say FU to me being such a procrastinator because I procrastinated on something big time.

1985
02:24:49,006 --> 02:24:51,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I really should have gotten taken care of a lot sooner, but whatever.

1986
02:24:51,607 --> 02:24:52,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you know what?

1987
02:24:53,649 --> 02:24:54,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Life goes on.

1988
02:24:55,017 --> 02:24:57,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, there's worse things that could happen in the world.

1989
02:24:58,899 --> 02:24:59,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.

1990
02:25:00,300 --> 02:25:01,761
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a couple more stories for you guys.

1991
02:25:01,781 --> 02:25:03,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the listless results.

1992
02:25:03,802 --> 02:25:05,302
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the Skype line.

1993
02:25:05,943 --> 02:25:07,864
[SPEAKER_05]: And listless, by the way, I will say this about listless.

1994
02:25:08,164 --> 02:25:09,865
[SPEAKER_05]: This doesn't happen very often in listless.

1995
02:25:10,345 --> 02:25:13,706
[SPEAKER_05]: But every single answer tonight got at least one vote.

1996
02:25:14,066 --> 02:25:15,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Every single answer.

1997
02:25:15,146 --> 02:25:17,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually something gets shut out, but it's going to be a close one tonight.

1998
02:25:17,747 --> 02:25:19,207
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully you guys all voted.

1999
02:25:19,387 --> 02:25:21,627
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, you got like 30 seconds left.

2000
02:25:22,108 --> 02:25:24,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what do you got for us while we wrap things up?

2001
02:25:24,588 --> 02:25:25,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop playing that game.

2002
02:25:25,488 --> 02:25:26,268
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you playing now?

2003
02:25:26,308 --> 02:25:27,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing.

2004
02:25:27,969 --> 02:25:28,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you are.

2005
02:25:28,529 --> 02:25:32,910
[SPEAKER_05]: You're playing that freaking Contra in Castlevania meets Super Mario Brothers and...

2006
02:25:33,510 --> 02:25:34,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my crap.

2007
02:26:00,819 --> 02:26:09,185
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, I guess it has parodies of, uh, fighters from King of Fighters, Tekken, Virtua Fighter, Street Fighter, you name it.

2008
02:26:09,345 --> 02:26:13,448
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, um, each character has their own special abilities.

2009
02:26:13,989 --> 02:26:23,015
[SPEAKER_06]: These, for example, uh, Rana, who is covered in massage oil, which she uses to rub on herself on, uh, other fighters and, uh, slip past their punches.

2010
02:26:24,016 --> 02:26:26,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, or they have, um, some other people who...

2011
02:26:27,378 --> 02:26:38,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Throw vibrators and whatnot, but it's a game where they basically get their clothes ripped off as they're fighting.

2012
02:26:39,760 --> 02:26:40,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

2013
02:26:41,781 --> 02:26:43,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Only playable in Japan, I'm afraid.

2014
02:26:44,081 --> 02:26:45,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, what a big surprise.

2015
02:26:45,882 --> 02:26:47,542
[SPEAKER_05]: A game like that's never going to come out here?

2016
02:26:47,662 --> 02:26:48,322
[SPEAKER_05]: What a shock.

2017
02:26:49,622 --> 02:26:53,283
[SPEAKER_06]: They have some screenshots, and it's interesting, I guess.

2018
02:26:54,284 --> 02:26:58,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Amaze Satsuma in our chatroom says, Super Strip Fighter, isn't that called Dead or Alive?

2019
02:26:59,365 --> 02:27:02,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Ba-dum-bum, ba-dum-bum, everybody's a comedian here at OLR.

2020
02:27:03,806 --> 02:27:11,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Orange Lounge Radio, of course, as you know, started about a little game called DDR and the other types of music games that were out there in a series called Bomani.

2021
02:27:11,988 --> 02:27:12,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

2022
02:27:12,489 --> 02:27:17,610
[SPEAKER_05]: The Bomani series is still alive, so we want to take our last story tonight to show you guys...

2023
02:27:18,610 --> 02:27:19,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2024
02:27:43,557 --> 02:27:44,678
[SPEAKER_05]: It's made out of widescreen.

2025
02:28:06,846 --> 02:28:10,968
[SPEAKER_05]: If you hit it, then it changes to the color of the player and bounces right back to the opponent.

2026
02:28:11,669 --> 02:28:18,292
[SPEAKER_05]: The rate at which it will move will depend on the music, so if it's a slow BPM, then the note will move slowly, and so on and so on.

2027
02:28:18,572 --> 02:28:21,153
[SPEAKER_05]: There's hold notes, chain notes, and so forth.

2028
02:28:21,193 --> 02:28:28,056
[SPEAKER_05]: They say it's also a lot like Boom Boom Rocket, if you've ever played that on Xbox Live, with the whole bar and the exploding fireworks.

2029
02:28:28,477 --> 02:28:34,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the songs in the game, there's a remix of Star Mine, 777, a song called Juicy,

2030
02:28:35,740 --> 02:28:36,780
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll leave that to your imagination.

2031
02:28:36,841 --> 02:28:38,521
[SPEAKER_05]: And Silence, so on and so on.

2032
02:28:38,601 --> 02:28:41,903
[SPEAKER_05]: So Reflect Beat, a new game in the Bomani series.

2033
02:28:41,923 --> 02:28:46,385
[SPEAKER_05]: There's even some pictures that are posted around there on the internets so you can see what this game looks like.

2034
02:28:47,765 --> 02:28:50,686
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of looks like DJ Max Technica a little bit.

2035
02:28:50,746 --> 02:28:52,747
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I was totally thinking when I saw it.

2036
02:28:53,067 --> 02:28:57,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if they're stealing the idea a little bit there.

2037
02:28:57,209 --> 02:28:58,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it funny how that works out?

2038
02:28:58,970 --> 02:29:00,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami steal a music game idea?

2039
02:29:01,211 --> 02:29:02,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Rock Revolution?

2040
02:29:02,111 --> 02:29:02,531
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

2041
02:29:03,492 --> 02:29:03,752
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2042
02:29:05,089 --> 02:29:05,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

2043
02:29:06,569 --> 02:29:07,030
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.

2044
02:29:07,810 --> 02:29:08,950
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't write it, we just report it.

2045
02:29:09,010 --> 02:29:09,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Reflect Beat.

2046
02:29:10,431 --> 02:29:13,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably never coming to an arcade near you unless you live in Japan.

2047
02:29:13,832 --> 02:29:17,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get to the listless results.

2048
02:29:17,473 --> 02:29:21,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the listless results and who won tonight's listless.

2049
02:29:25,175 --> 02:29:30,017
[SPEAKER_05]: As you know, tonight was all about what versus Capcom game would you like to see next.

2050
02:29:30,637 --> 02:29:32,698
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had a lot of votes in our chat room.

2051
02:29:35,767 --> 02:29:37,248
[SPEAKER_05]: In the end, only one could win.

2052
02:29:39,808 --> 02:29:41,549
[SPEAKER_05]: But for fun, we'll read you the top three.

[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, All Games vs. Capcom.

[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what that means.

[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to all get to be our own little fighting game characters.

[SPEAKER_05]: The number one answer for what you wanted to see, the definitive versus Capcom game you want to see next, no surprise to this audience, Konami versus Capcom is the number one answer tonight.

2059
02:30:13,508 --> 02:30:14,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami versus Capcom.

2060
02:30:15,530 --> 02:30:16,811
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is, the definitive list.

2061
02:30:18,573 --> 02:30:43,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually had on my original list Silent Hill vs. Capcom But I took it off when somebody said Konami But I do think it would be pretty awesome To have Pyramid Head as a character Pyramid Head vs. Chun-Li Be awesome Alright, so there it is Your top three list tonight And that's it, no disputing, it's a done deal No more arguing, fanboys, sit down, shut up It's done, we've put it through the scientific process Alright

2062

[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Loki, you have any last minute stories or are you just going to play your little Capcom?

2065
02:31:02,515 --> 02:31:03,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Why was I playing this game?

2066
02:31:03,595 --> 02:31:07,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm sure there's stuff I could talk about here.

2067
02:31:07,276 --> 02:31:07,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

2068
02:31:07,876 --> 02:31:07,916

02:31:19,257 --> 02:31:19,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yes.

2070
02:31:20,097 --> 02:31:20,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

2071
02:31:21,717 --> 02:31:23,378
[SPEAKER_06]: The Record of Argus War.

2072
02:31:23,598 --> 02:31:25,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, it's too hot for GameStop.

2073
02:31:25,859 --> 02:31:28,519
[SPEAKER_06]: They have decided to put it behind the counter like porno.

2074
02:31:30,360 --> 02:31:40,123
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently, they said, and this was actually an email that went out to the stores, please place Record of Argus War Limited Edition behind the cash wrap.

2075
02:31:41,303 --> 02:31:45,125
[SPEAKER_06]: If a customer inquires about the game, let the customer know you have it in stock.

2076
02:31:45,425 --> 02:31:46,325
[SPEAKER_05]: What's so bad about it?

2077
02:31:46,878 --> 02:31:50,219
[SPEAKER_06]: It has, like, suggestive looking pictures on the outside.

2078
02:31:50,239 --> 02:31:51,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops, sorry, we picked up a call.

2079
02:31:51,640 --> 02:31:52,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:31:52,640 --> 02:31:53,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

02:31:54,460 --> 02:31:56,541
[SPEAKER_02]: This is DS Master 26.

2082
02:31:56,801 --> 02:32:01,343
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, DarkSakura yelled disconnect.

2083
02:32:04,103 --> 02:32:05,844
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura vetoed that call.

2084
02:32:11,287 --> 02:32:12,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry, sir.

2085
02:32:12,749 --> 02:32:13,090
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2086
02:32:13,811 --> 02:32:14,512
[SPEAKER_05]: You are not.

2087
02:32:15,013 --> 02:32:15,314
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right.

2088
02:32:15,354 --> 02:32:16,896
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not.

2089
02:32:16,916 --> 02:32:17,717
[SPEAKER_05]: 877-KMOLR.

2090
02:32:17,798 --> 02:32:19,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Use name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2091
02:32:19,500 --> 02:32:22,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you're DS Master, then you just don't want to call in.

2092
02:32:22,565 --> 02:32:22,866
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2093
02:32:26,164 --> 02:32:28,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, what other fun stuff can we talk about here?

2094
02:32:29,065 --> 02:32:29,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this is kind of neat.

2095
02:32:29,786 --> 02:32:32,807
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried this a little bit earlier this week, but it crashed my computer.

2096
02:32:33,327 --> 02:32:39,089
[SPEAKER_06]: But Instant Action, it's a game service that they sell a bunch of different PC games.

2097
02:32:39,469 --> 02:32:44,531
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually have a new thing now where you can embed game demos into webpages.

2098
02:32:44,971 --> 02:32:47,432
[SPEAKER_06]: So, say, for example, the example shown.

2099
02:32:48,112 --> 02:33:08,772
[SPEAKER_06]: The Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition You can embed a 20 minute free trial into a webpage and get tested out Fortunately when I did that on my work computer it crashed I don't blame the website, I blame my computer because it sucks It's too bad Um

2100
02:33:12,327 --> 02:33:15,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Some games that are going to be coming out later in the month.

2101
02:33:16,810 --> 02:33:21,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Raystorm HD is supposed to be making its way out on May 5th as well as Xenoclash.

2102
02:33:22,755 --> 02:33:25,416
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, those are both on Xbox Live Arcade.

2103
02:33:26,037 --> 02:33:35,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Rocket Knight, the remake there, is supposed to be making its way out on May 12th on Xbox Live Arcade and Steam and then May 18th on the PlayStation Network.

2104
02:33:35,303 --> 02:33:35,964
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of cool.

2105
02:33:40,578 --> 02:33:40,878
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2106
02:33:42,400 --> 02:33:45,182
[SPEAKER_06]: And, yeah, that's pretty much it.

2107
02:33:47,524 --> 02:33:48,765
[SPEAKER_05]: What is up with Skype?

2108
02:33:49,005 --> 02:33:51,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, last week, nobody wanted to call.

2109
02:33:51,907 --> 02:33:54,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, wow.

2110
02:33:54,530 --> 02:33:56,311
[SPEAKER_05]: They're too busy playing Super Mario.

2111
02:33:56,351 --> 02:33:57,032
[SPEAKER_05]: What is up?

2112
02:33:57,212 --> 02:34:01,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, a couple weeks ago, we were getting, like, seven calls at once.

2113
02:34:01,916 --> 02:34:02,756
[SPEAKER_05]: It was insane.

2114
02:34:03,097 --> 02:34:04,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Freaking call us, people.

2115
02:34:04,398 --> 02:34:05,258
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

2116
02:34:07,096 --> 02:34:08,396
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura's already mad.

2117
02:34:08,476 --> 02:34:08,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Now.

2118
02:34:09,137 --> 02:34:09,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

2119
02:34:09,897 --> 02:34:12,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they're afraid we're going to hang up on them too.

2120
02:34:12,358 --> 02:34:14,458
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to hang up on you unless you're DS Master.

2121
02:34:14,679 --> 02:34:18,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's see what's... You know what's so funny?

2122
02:34:18,560 --> 02:34:22,221
[SPEAKER_05]: A phone call was coming in and the minute DarkSakura said that, it disappeared.

2123
02:34:33,152 --> 02:34:33,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I don't know.

2124
02:34:34,613 --> 02:34:35,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we just going to sit here and wait?

2125
02:34:35,813 --> 02:34:40,395
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want people to call us, please.

2126
02:34:41,976 --> 02:34:43,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't make me use the little girl voice.

2127
02:34:45,518 --> 02:34:46,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody's offering to call in.

2128
02:34:46,678 --> 02:34:47,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it, call!

2129
02:34:47,959 --> 02:34:48,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hold on.

2130
02:34:48,419 --> 02:34:49,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we'll get a call here in a minute.

2131
02:34:49,559 --> 02:34:50,940
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just be nice and wait.

2132
02:34:50,980 --> 02:34:51,840
[SPEAKER_05]: See, now a phone number.

2133
02:34:52,301 --> 02:34:52,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Now a call's coming in.

2134
02:34:53,441 --> 02:34:54,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.

2135
02:34:54,482 --> 02:34:54,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2136
02:34:56,195 --> 02:34:57,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, this is SSJ100Matt.

2137
02:34:57,836 --> 02:34:59,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, SSJ100Matt.

2138
02:34:59,337 --> 02:35:02,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for... Hi.

2139
02:35:02,339 --> 02:35:03,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for not being DSMaster.

2140
02:35:03,960 --> 02:35:04,560
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

2141
02:35:07,042 --> 02:35:07,983
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing very good.

2142
02:35:08,483 --> 02:35:09,183
[SPEAKER_05]: So, tell us.

2143
02:35:09,464 --> 02:35:17,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, I know you're kind of buds with YYR, Aaron, you know, the guy behind Snake360, following all that fun stuff, and who sent us the gold star email tonight.

2144
02:35:18,550 --> 02:35:20,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Is he serious, or is he just fucking with us?

2145
02:35:24,515 --> 02:35:25,135
[SPEAKER_03]: I plead the fifth.

2146
02:35:27,176 --> 02:35:27,757
[SPEAKER_05]: You're killing me.

2147
02:35:27,797 --> 02:35:32,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, I'm just saying, go back to him and say, hey, you don't have to make it a Golden Girls game.

2148
02:35:32,959 --> 02:35:34,620
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Grandma's Got Guns.

2149
02:35:35,921 --> 02:35:37,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let me tell you something.

2150
02:35:37,081 --> 02:35:41,924
[SPEAKER_03]: When you were reading the email and with all the comments, I texted him saying, hey, people want this game.

2151
02:35:43,505 --> 02:35:44,565
[SPEAKER_03]: He hasn't texted me back.

2152
02:35:46,046 --> 02:35:47,627
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, fair enough.

2153
02:35:47,827 --> 02:35:48,307
[SPEAKER_05]: You tried.

2154
02:35:48,787 --> 02:35:49,728
[SPEAKER_05]: You get an A for effort.

2155
02:35:50,909 --> 02:35:51,169
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2156
02:35:52,443 --> 02:35:54,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what else is on your mind tonight?

2157
02:35:54,105 --> 02:35:55,446
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of video games have you been playing this week?

2158
02:35:57,167 --> 02:36:00,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I called in to do a giveaway right this very second.

2159
02:36:00,110 --> 02:36:01,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy crap!

2160
02:36:01,231 --> 02:36:01,652
[SPEAKER_05]: I want it!

2161
02:36:01,672 --> 02:36:02,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Gimme, gimme, gimme!

2162
02:36:04,654 --> 02:36:04,955
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it?

2163
02:36:04,975 --> 02:36:05,895
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you giving away tonight?

2164
02:36:06,056 --> 02:36:14,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, you know, what I'm giving away is... Back at PAX East, I was given an Avatar download code.

2165
02:36:15,784 --> 02:36:16,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, is it one of the...

2166
02:36:18,177 --> 02:36:19,017
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an Avatar hoodie.

2167
02:36:19,318 --> 02:36:20,818
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a PAX East Avatar hoodie.

2168
02:36:20,918 --> 02:36:22,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Even I didn't get one of those.

2169
02:36:22,419 --> 02:36:23,820
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're going to give it away to a listener?

2170
02:36:25,460 --> 02:36:26,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm going to give it away to a listener.

2171
02:36:26,861 --> 02:36:29,022
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I hope DS Master wins it, just to make you mad.

2172
02:36:29,202 --> 02:36:30,743
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, how are you going to give this away?

2173
02:36:32,163 --> 02:36:40,387
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do a quick trivia question on a game that just came out that me and Wawa are actually battling with after Burner Climax.

2174
02:36:40,807 --> 02:36:42,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, okay, fair enough.

2175
02:36:42,528 --> 02:36:46,970
[SPEAKER_05]: And if somebody knows the answer, I assume they're going to, what, send you a private message in chat or something?

2176
02:36:48,021 --> 02:36:49,862
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're just going to spam chat.

2177
02:36:50,022 --> 02:36:51,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, spam chat.

2178
02:36:51,422 --> 02:36:55,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, first to yell out in chat, and then we'll see who won, because you're watching chat right now.

2179
02:36:55,164 --> 02:36:57,705
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, what is the question?

2180
02:36:57,725 --> 02:37:03,307
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, the question is, Yu Suzuki is the creator of Afterburner.

2181
02:37:04,408 --> 02:37:08,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Afterburner made an appearance in another Yu Suzuki game.

2182
02:37:08,710 --> 02:37:09,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Which game is that?

2183
02:37:10,603 --> 02:37:10,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Go.

2184
02:37:11,444 --> 02:37:12,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeopardy?

2185
02:37:13,525 --> 02:37:14,806
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have Jeopardy.

2186
02:37:14,846 --> 02:37:17,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Chuck Norris is not the answer, Bobby Blackwolf.

2187
02:37:17,107 --> 02:37:17,388
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2188
02:37:17,848 --> 02:37:22,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't have the theme song to Jeopardy or anything like that, but I do have this for game show music.

2189
02:37:43,994 --> 02:37:45,955
[SPEAKER_03]: People need to be more specific.

2190
02:37:45,995 --> 02:37:47,556
[SPEAKER_03]: They almost have the answer.

2191
02:37:47,876 --> 02:37:53,540
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like four people shouted out Shenmue, Daytona USA, Bayonetta.

2192
02:37:53,560 --> 02:37:56,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Loki got it.

2193
02:37:56,242 --> 02:37:56,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki!

2194
02:37:56,582 --> 02:37:56,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki!

2195
02:37:56,982 --> 02:37:57,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki!

2196
02:38:03,675 --> 02:38:04,075
[SPEAKER_06]: I cheated.

2197
02:38:04,255 --> 02:38:04,856
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I didn't cheat.

2198
02:38:05,056 --> 02:38:06,236
[SPEAKER_06]: These will be more specific.

2199
02:38:06,696 --> 02:38:07,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Shenmue 2?

2200
02:38:07,357 --> 02:38:09,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you are not eligible.

2201
02:38:09,158 --> 02:38:10,758
[SPEAKER_05]: You are a host of this program.

2202
02:38:11,199 --> 02:38:11,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Do another question.

2203
02:38:12,379 --> 02:38:13,560
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to do another question.

2204
02:38:13,660 --> 02:38:15,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, keep your hands... Another question.

2205
02:38:15,761 --> 02:38:16,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Play your stupid game.

2206
02:38:18,122 --> 02:38:19,582
[SPEAKER_05]: New question, new question.

2207
02:38:19,602 --> 02:38:20,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, I'm going to put new question.

2208
02:38:23,384 --> 02:38:25,585
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you... What?

2209
02:38:25,985 --> 02:38:28,186
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I did not expect Loki to ruin it.

2210
02:38:28,407 --> 02:38:30,027
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, Loki ruins everything.

2211
02:38:30,127 --> 02:38:31,108
[SPEAKER_05]: God, Loki...

2212
02:38:33,257 --> 02:38:34,598
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll help you come up with a new question.

2213
02:38:34,779 --> 02:38:35,519
[SPEAKER_05]: You want a new question?

2214
02:38:36,921 --> 02:38:37,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know what?

2215
02:38:37,521 --> 02:38:38,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, come up with a new question.

2216
02:38:40,344 --> 02:38:40,604
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2217
02:38:41,425 --> 02:38:41,706
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2218
02:38:41,966 --> 02:38:42,426
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, Matt.

2219
02:38:42,466 --> 02:38:44,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Now look how much you've upset Matt.

2220
02:38:44,749 --> 02:38:45,730
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to apologize.

2221
02:38:45,770 --> 02:38:46,230
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

2222
02:38:46,270 --> 02:38:47,011
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't upset me.

2223
02:38:47,031 --> 02:38:50,895
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the thing was, it was my fault because I just saw the answer.

2224
02:38:51,474 --> 02:38:53,455
[SPEAKER_03]: I said Shenmue 2 when I saw Loki next to him.

2225
02:38:53,475 --> 02:38:54,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, shit.

2226
02:38:57,857 --> 02:38:58,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit.

2227
02:38:58,938 --> 02:38:59,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2228
02:39:00,599 --> 02:39:01,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you go.

2229
02:39:03,220 --> 02:39:12,025
[SPEAKER_05]: According to my source that I'm looking at right now, what type of airplane do you fly in Afterburner?

2230
02:39:13,286 --> 02:39:14,286
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good question, right?

2231
02:39:15,307 --> 02:39:15,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there you go.

2232
02:39:18,772 --> 02:39:22,276
[SPEAKER_05]: What type of plane do you fly in After Burner?

2233
02:39:27,462 --> 02:39:28,803
[SPEAKER_05]: A big plane will not work.

2234
02:39:28,823 --> 02:39:31,947
[SPEAKER_05]: A boat!

2235
02:39:32,607 --> 02:39:33,428
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not on a boat.

2236
02:39:34,449 --> 02:39:36,552
[SPEAKER_05]: What type of plane do you fly in After Burner?

2237
02:39:38,135 --> 02:39:40,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, oh, oh, oh, Dark Tetsuya got it.

2238
02:39:40,858 --> 02:39:42,540
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an F-14 Tomcat.

2239
02:39:42,880 --> 02:39:43,701
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

2240
02:39:43,721 --> 02:39:44,342
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

2241
02:39:44,362 --> 02:39:45,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Tetsuya got it.

2242
02:39:45,783 --> 02:39:46,584
[SPEAKER_05]: And there you go.

2243
02:39:46,664 --> 02:39:50,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though he's sort of on OLR staff, at least he's not one of the hosts of the freaking show.

2244
02:39:51,309 --> 02:39:51,870
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

2245
02:39:53,806 --> 02:39:54,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Tetsuya wins.

2246
02:39:55,507 --> 02:39:56,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Congrats, DT.

2247
02:39:56,467 --> 02:39:57,828
[SPEAKER_05]: You get the code.

2248
02:39:57,888 --> 02:39:58,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Applause for DT.

2249
02:39:58,929 --> 02:39:59,549
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a winner.

2250
02:40:00,069 --> 02:40:01,850
[SPEAKER_05]: The rest of you, I'm sorry, you lose.

2251
02:40:02,350 --> 02:40:02,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2252
02:40:04,392 --> 02:40:05,392
[SPEAKER_05]: We love giveaways.

2253
02:40:06,493 --> 02:40:06,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

2254
02:40:07,333 --> 02:40:11,375
[SPEAKER_05]: We love giveaways, so thank you so much, Matt, for calling in and giving stuff away.

2255
02:40:11,415 --> 02:40:12,156
[SPEAKER_05]: We really appreciate it.

2256
02:40:12,496 --> 02:40:14,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else on your mind you wanted to share tonight with us?

2257
02:40:16,458 --> 02:40:16,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

2258
02:40:18,059 --> 02:40:18,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Afterburner Climax.

2259
02:40:19,559 --> 02:40:20,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to beat my score.

2260
02:40:20,695 --> 02:40:21,375
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to get it.

2261
02:40:21,475 --> 02:40:22,736
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally forgot it came out.

2262
02:40:22,776 --> 02:40:30,939
[SPEAKER_05]: I was so busy having sand in my vagina over Game Room and then playing stuff on my new video card that I totally forgot about Afterburner, so I need to check it out.

2263
02:40:32,159 --> 02:40:32,379
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2264
02:40:32,799 --> 02:40:38,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, SJ100, Matt, you have a wonderful, wonderful week, and thanks so much for giving away free shit on our show.

[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

2267
02:40:40,922 --> 02:40:41,142
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2268
02:40:41,462 --> 02:40:41,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, buddy.

2269
02:40:43,043 --> 02:40:43,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

2270
02:40:43,303 --> 02:40:43,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care.

2271
02:40:44,463 --> 02:40:45,004
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

02:40:46,844 --> 02:40:47,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Free stuff.

2274
02:40:47,384 --> 02:40:48,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Speech, Dark Tetsuya.

2275
02:40:48,425 --> 02:40:48,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Speech.

2276
02:40:52,011 --> 02:40:52,271
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2277
02:40:56,272 --> 02:40:57,393
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll take more calls.

2278
02:40:57,413 --> 02:40:58,813
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2279
02:40:58,893 --> 02:41:00,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2280
02:41:00,674 --> 02:41:02,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we run out of last-minute stories, Loki?

2281
02:41:03,795 --> 02:41:05,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Ones that I wanted to talk about.

2282
02:41:05,055 --> 02:41:07,856
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just, you know... Well, how about the ones you didn't want to talk about?

2283
02:41:09,117 --> 02:41:10,017
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to talk about them.

2284
02:41:10,217 --> 02:41:10,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, fine.

2285
02:41:13,809 --> 02:41:14,509
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't paying attention.

2286
02:41:14,589 --> 02:41:16,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to the B-sides tonight.

2287
02:41:16,130 --> 02:41:19,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to the B-sides stories and see what's going on there.

2288
02:41:20,072 --> 02:41:20,912
[SPEAKER_05]: The B-sides?

2289
02:41:20,932 --> 02:41:22,433
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you got saved by a phone call.

2290
02:41:22,493 --> 02:41:23,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2291
02:41:23,414 --> 02:41:23,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2292
02:41:24,614 --> 02:41:27,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, O-U-O-N-R.

2293
02:41:27,896 --> 02:41:28,776
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

2294
02:41:29,276 --> 02:41:29,657
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?

2295
02:41:30,437 --> 02:41:30,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I don't know.

2296
02:41:33,530 --> 02:41:37,231
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when the fuck did I get a German accent?

2297
02:41:37,591 --> 02:41:39,052
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well.

2298
02:41:39,612 --> 02:41:39,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2299
02:41:40,372 --> 02:41:43,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, how are you and your German accent this fine week?

2300
02:41:45,214 --> 02:41:45,814
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just fine.

2301
02:41:46,054 --> 02:41:47,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, kind of.

2302
02:41:48,275 --> 02:41:48,975
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's on your mind?

2303
02:41:49,096 --> 02:41:50,176
[SPEAKER_05]: What do we owe the phone call to?

2304
02:41:51,897 --> 02:41:52,237
[SPEAKER_00]: Sims 3.

2305
02:41:53,677 --> 02:41:58,459
[SPEAKER_00]: That's annoying when it locks up.

2306
02:41:59,579 --> 02:42:01,540
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you feel about Sims 3 coming to consoles?

2307
02:42:02,715 --> 02:42:16,994
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, say almost, uh, yay and dem kinda, uh, well, oh, well, it's gonna be, it's gonna be get dumbed down and, which is boo-hoo.

2308
02:42:18,035 --> 02:42:37,118
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the other thing, though, is that, well, lucky us, for us hardcore Sims players, the new expansion set, Ambitions, will hit the PC before we get Sims 3 on the console.

2309
02:42:39,363 --> 02:42:39,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

2310
02:42:40,143 --> 02:42:43,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because Sims 3 on the console is going to probably be a ways out, especially if we're just hearing about it now.

2311
02:42:44,005 --> 02:42:46,666
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I haven't heard DarkSakura talk about Sims 3 in a long time.

2312
02:42:46,706 --> 02:42:48,766
[SPEAKER_09]: I've actually been sitting here uninstalling my Sims 3.

2313
02:42:49,166 --> 02:42:50,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, did all the talk about it tonight?

2314
02:42:51,107 --> 02:42:59,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, no, because what's been going on is because I have a lot of mods in my game, I have to completely reinstall and delete my registries.

2315
02:43:00,190 --> 02:43:02,311
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, and it decided to fart on me, so...

2316
02:43:04,074 --> 02:43:04,754
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question.

2317
02:43:04,854 --> 02:43:11,938
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, actually, how do you... Registry erasing?

2318
02:43:12,078 --> 02:43:12,878
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell?

2319
02:43:13,178 --> 02:43:13,819
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do that?

2320
02:43:14,479 --> 02:43:15,239
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do that?

2321
02:43:19,302 --> 02:43:25,585
[SPEAKER_00]: Because my current problem in Sim 3 is that my school building is borked.

2322
02:43:26,823 --> 02:43:34,868
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be in the school building for like two minutes, and then they just stop.

2323
02:43:35,449 --> 02:43:36,889
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, I have no idea.

2324
02:43:38,450 --> 02:43:41,532
[SPEAKER_09]: That's something that you're probably going to have to check on the Sims 3 forum for.

2325
02:43:44,454 --> 02:43:46,956
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never had that problem, so I don't know how to help with it.

2326
02:43:48,055 --> 02:43:50,616
[SPEAKER_05]: What's supposed to be coming in this next Sims 3 expansion?

2327
02:43:51,696 --> 02:43:53,777
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the big thing that they're going to do with this?

2328
02:43:56,078 --> 02:44:00,959
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, apparently they're going to make a move to make...

2329
02:44:03,963 --> 02:44:22,246
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a move on those players that never leave the sim creator or where they just build lots and never play the actual sims game.

2330
02:44:23,325 --> 02:44:24,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they're happy doing that.

2331
02:44:24,346 --> 02:44:26,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand why they're going to ruin that.

2332
02:44:27,069 --> 02:44:28,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Get out and play the game, dammit.

2333
02:44:29,291 --> 02:44:30,753
[SPEAKER_00]: What if I just want to build stuff?

2334
02:44:31,213 --> 02:44:33,555
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, never mind, really.

2335
02:44:34,737 --> 02:44:34,857
[SPEAKER_05]: It's...

2336
02:44:35,982 --> 02:44:36,782
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting, though.

2337
02:44:36,822 --> 02:44:42,025
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's a lot going on in... I don't want to compare The Sims 3 to WoW, but I will.

2338
02:44:43,125 --> 02:44:51,108
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot going on in WoW right now where they're really changing up the game, and they're changing it in some big, big ways, and it's kind of causing the player base to have some rabble rabble.

2339
02:44:51,469 --> 02:45:01,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Although Blizzard changes big shit with every patch, and everything works out just fine, but I guess the big, big thing that's causing rabble rabble is that now the 10-man and 25-man raids are going to share the same lockout.

2340
02:45:02,213 --> 02:45:02,814
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2341
02:45:17,310 --> 02:45:46,015
[SPEAKER_05]: so you know big changes to the game but sometimes it works out for the better so in a way and you know I'm relating this back to Sims 3 I promise you know if they're going to change some of the core elements of the game maybe it's just because they kind of see the habits of the players right now and they kind of want to course people into looking at this whole other part of the game that they've developed that nobody's looking at and also a thing that's apparently coming with the new expansion is that there's going to be apparently natural disasters

2342
02:45:47,599 --> 02:45:48,420
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be fun!

2343
02:45:48,820 --> 02:45:54,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there you go, that kind of... There we have something really interesting.

2344
02:45:54,643 --> 02:46:13,512
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that kind of reminds me... If that would happen, not that... Because, well, the optimal would be if they made a... Well, what's the... I think it's actually called the Sims... Well, the Seasons expansion that they made for Sims 2.

2345
02:46:14,133 --> 02:46:14,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Since...

2346
02:46:14,733 --> 02:46:21,797
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, since I'm like a snow person, I would love to have my Sims playing in snow.

2347
02:46:22,998 --> 02:46:25,359
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the problem.

2348
02:46:28,421 --> 02:46:32,644
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem that I would have with that is that my current Sims house

2349
02:46:33,904 --> 02:46:50,238
[SPEAKER_00]: is not is not exactly a winter house because they would free would freeze if so were the case if you have to have walls around everything since I'm like I'm having like one bed here one bed there all the all in the opening

2350
02:46:51,519 --> 02:46:54,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope the expansion works out okay for you.

2351
02:47:21,209 --> 02:47:21,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well.

2352
02:47:21,829 --> 02:47:22,189
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2353
02:47:22,349 --> 02:47:22,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, buddy.

2354
02:47:24,270 --> 02:47:24,590
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2355
02:47:25,751 --> 02:47:27,051
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll go ahead and wrap up there.

2356
02:47:27,091 --> 02:47:36,334
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be our last call tonight because we want to go and wrap stuff up and get to our afterbirth, the part of the show that's not podcast, you know, nothing to.

2357
02:47:36,635 --> 02:47:40,436
[SPEAKER_05]: You see, you got to join us for a live show to know what that's all about, but don't worry.

2358
02:47:40,956 --> 02:47:42,277
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not missing too much.

2359
02:47:42,317 --> 02:47:43,077
[SPEAKER_05]: We wouldn't do that to you.

2360
02:47:43,477 --> 02:47:45,938
[SPEAKER_05]: But we want to get to that and wrap things up and get out of here tonight.

2361
02:47:46,519 --> 02:47:48,419
[SPEAKER_05]: But first, we've got to thank all you guys for listening tonight.

2362
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:52,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Were there any other last-minute stories, though, before I get to that, Loki, real quick?

2363
02:47:52,741 --> 02:47:52,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

2364
02:47:53,121 --> 02:47:53,922
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, nothing?

2365
02:47:53,962 --> 02:47:54,222
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2366
02:47:54,742 --> 02:48:01,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Then let me take an opportunity to say thank you guys so much for downloading our show and tuning in to us or tuning in to us live, however you choose to listen to OLR.

2367
02:48:01,445 --> 02:48:02,206
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2368
02:48:23,038 --> 02:48:25,180
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is new video card.

2369
02:48:25,220 --> 02:48:26,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

2370
02:48:26,242 --> 02:48:26,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Dragon Age.

2371
02:48:26,862 --> 02:48:27,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

2372
02:48:27,403 --> 02:48:28,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, your final thought.

2373
02:48:30,346 --> 02:48:34,851
[SPEAKER_06]: With the power of hot swapping, I will once again be able to play my crazy Grand Theft Auto games.

2374
02:48:35,458 --> 02:48:36,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

2375
02:48:36,418 --> 02:48:36,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

2376
02:48:37,519 --> 02:48:39,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys so much for listening to our show.

2377
02:48:40,119 --> 02:48:42,000
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to be back next week to do it all again.

2378
02:48:42,140 --> 02:48:45,301
[SPEAKER_05]: More news, more chatters, more stuff, more antics.

2379
02:48:45,721 --> 02:48:46,481
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be a good time.

2380
02:48:46,521 --> 02:48:48,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys so much for downloading our show.

2381
02:48:48,982 --> 02:48:49,702
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it, right?

2382
02:48:49,962 --> 02:48:50,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing else?

2383
02:48:51,022 --> 02:48:52,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we'll see you next week.

2384
02:48:52,243 --> 02:48:52,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one, everybody.

2385
02:48:53,871 --> 02:48:54,391
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next week!

2386
02:49:24,882 --> 02:49:26,113
Thanks for watching!
