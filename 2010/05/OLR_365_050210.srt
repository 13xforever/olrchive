00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Who's the host?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Dark Sakura

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Sky and Loco

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tonight, May 2nd, 2010

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Is a 6 player 2D Castlevania game on the way

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Bungie signs a new publishing deal

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And is yet another sequel to Red Steel on the way

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Enough arguing about the graphics card in our chat room

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Jeez, it's like all these wars

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Can't we all just get along?

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh hey, hello my friends and welcome to episode number 365 of Orange Lounge Radio

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The video game talk show where every gamer has a voice

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The one, the only, the ultimate, the sometimes friendly

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hi

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But always

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
My headache's gone

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But always ready to make guacamole

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh my guacamole was really good

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh my guacamole

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Okay, I have to say something because

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You know how I said two weeks ago, two or three weeks ago

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That I was going to give up fast food altogether

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
While I decided to go semi-raw

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh my guac

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Not fully vegan because if I have an opportunity to have sashimi

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Then I'm going to eat sashimi

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But for the most part, the easiest way to do it

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Is to go kind of raw vegan

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And it's because I've had so many digestion problems

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And so many other health issues

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That I think this is the best way to see if it

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It can't hurt, it can only help

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I will say this, years and years ago

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Probably about seven, eight years ago

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The crazy psychic

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I used to date someone who was vegan

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Allegedly

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I used to date someone who was vegan

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And he really, really liked to cook

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And I will tell you, and I don't like to cook

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So I would eat whatever the vegan would make

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Well yeah, because I will eat anything a vegan makes

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Because you know, at worst case scenario

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's like tofu surprise

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
They're not going to go, surprise, it's brains of a cow

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Or you know, something in the dish

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Or Rocky Mountain oysters

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yeah, you always know, it's vegetables

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Chat room, ask me what it is if you don't know

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But I will say this

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Between that and that was at the peak

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Of me playing DDR during the tournaments

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And that was when the orange bat stuff happened

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
When the show was born, etc, etc

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I was never thinner

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Now I'm fat

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And the whole thing of it is

62
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I really just stopped and looked at everything

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That I was consuming

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I was having a couple of sugar free Red Bulls a day

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And coffee

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And I was having trouble sleeping, duh

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Gee, I wonder why

68
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And I was really stressed out from work

69
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And from my school projects

70
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That a lot of other stuff had going on

71
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So I just decided that it's time

72
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That I stop putting this off

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Stop putting this?

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah, stop putting this off

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And just start doing something for myself

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And yeah, and no

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's not like the crazy vegan type of people

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Like, oh, organic food is the only kind of food you can eat

79
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And all these have drugs in them

80
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Meat is murder

81
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah, fuck PETA

82
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
However

83
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I do think that

84
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The belief would not be there

85
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
If there hadn't been some basis for it

86
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So

87
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm doing this for me

88
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm not doing it for the bunnies

89
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm doing it for the cows

90
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Although I did find that corn fed cow

91
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Makes me sick

92
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Grass fed cow does not

93
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
How strange

94
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Keep in mind they feed cows antibiotics

95
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
To make them digest corn

96
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Because cows are not meant to eat corn

97
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Neither are humans

98
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Anyhow

99
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Let me go

100
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I gotta introduce everybody here

101
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry for going off on it

102
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But I have to say right now

103
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
My headache has finally gone away

104
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Let me also introduce the host

105
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Voted least likely to go vegetarian

106
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Of all the OLR hosts

107
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Say hello to the one and only tech master Loki

108
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'll never go vegetarian

109
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You'd have to give up your double downs

110
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't eat the double downs anymore

111
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's not worth it

112
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Seriously

113
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It was just experiment to see if it was any good

114
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And I see right through their scam

115
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Of giving me two pieces of chicken

116
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
For a lot of money

117
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Tonight I notice you've gone back to the old standard

118
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Personal sized pizza

119
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Wrong it was six parmesan twists

120
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Oh okay I'm sorry

121
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And it's because those are really delicious

122
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But also vegetarian

123
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
No

124
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Not true vegetarian

125
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Because it's cheese and all that stuff

126
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
La ba ba ba

127
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Whatever the cheese and egg

128
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Labia what?

129
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Octolavio or something

130
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't know

131
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I haven't researched my vegan terminology

132
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I did have eggs this morning though

133
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Because I went out to breakfast

134
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Maybe someone in our chat room knows the vegan terminology

135
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Chat.orangesolentrated.com

DarkSakura

I played more Babylonian Twins which is pretty fun

157
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Super Street Fighter 4

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Which Drury is mean and evil

159
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And bad ass

160
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000

And I played some pinball

162

Espagaluda 2

165
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That's just kind of fun to say

166
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Espagaluda

167
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000

Bought it this week too

170
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What console did you guys get it on?

171
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We have 360

172
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
At PS3 but you guys have the fight stick right?

173
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Why are you giggling?

174
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000

175
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's cool

176
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You guys have the fight stick on 360 right?

177
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah good times

178
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But we do have some news though about

179
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
GameCrazy

180
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And I was gonna wait until later on in the show

181
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
To say it cause I got an email

182
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Well I didn't show roll it because I didn't know if you wanted

183
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
To talk about it or not but go ahead and take the floor

184
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I said I was gonna wait but meh

185
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
GameCrazy's gone out of business

186
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So instead of my husband

187
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Having 3 weeks of work he's got 13

188
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Weeks of work so that's good

189
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But at the same time

190
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Bye bye GameCrazy

191
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I know the rumors have been floating

192
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Around the internet and I think the stories we've seen on the internet

193
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Were a rumor but

194
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's true

195
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
We got confirmation a week ago

196
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So

197
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm more like a couple days ago

198
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But for every door that closes another opens

199
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Blah blah blah blah blah

200
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It'll be okay

201
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
We're not worried I'll put it this way we're not worried

202
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So it's all good we're not worried

203
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's just a bummer though that

204
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
An alternative to

205
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You know Baron Von GameStop

206
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Is now closing you know

207
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It seems like they're just dropping like flies

208
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Did you totally see the game trader store that's on

209
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Antelope? And there's more local

210
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
We sell them yes and I know they have their

211
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Logo that's a blatant rip off

212
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Identical to GameStop

213
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Seriously the same

214
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The same freaking font

215
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't mean to get local

216
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
On you guys but maybe there's like

217
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
One or two sacri- here there's the guy

218
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We met in the line at Target that listens to the show

219
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So somebody in Sac- he's even still listening

220
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Some people in Sacramento are listening

221
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
There's also

222
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Have you seen that place on Sunrise? Smashburger

223
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes that too

224
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Same font, same white and red

225
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Color and everything but it's a burger joint

226
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The font

227
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Is not a condensed font

228
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Close, close

229
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's different enough that they can't

230
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You're weird

231
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I know I noticed this stuff

232
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
By the way, by the way I know

233
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm gonna take a picture and put it on the site

234
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But this is the newspaper that I did

235
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh it's all like

236
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Actually printed on paper

237
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's a very- it's like I can get all my

238
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Jewish news

239
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Well it was for a fundraiser

240
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The temple that I go to had a big fundraiser called All That Jazz

241
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You were plugging in on the show a couple weeks ago

242
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
They wanted a newspaper to distribute

243
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
No OLR fans at the show

244
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I didn't go

245
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You know why I didn't go Rob

246
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Cause guess who's sitting her happy butt

247
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Here in this chair doing OLR

248
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm sorry

249
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That was me

250
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Anyhow, by the way there are some alternatives

251
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
There's what, the game trader

252
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Is that what they're called? Game trader or traitor

253
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Traitor

254
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
There's also that fair game

255
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Now I know the guys there

256
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The guys at fair game are rad

257
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Aren't they expanding? Cause there's the one over on

258
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Fair Oaks and then there's one right by my house

259
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
In Rosemont

260
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Not that I should be plugging where I live

261
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The guys there though, I do think that they

262
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Kinda overcharge a little bit on some of their stuff

263
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But they have a friggin copy of Loom

264
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
For the turbo graphics

265
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's kind of hard to get stuff there

266
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And they also do

267
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Disc resurfacing

268
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And

269
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Xbox

270
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Repairs

271
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Quote

272
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Let me go to chat

273
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
chat.orangelandrarity.com

274
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Rama says with GameCrazy going out of business we only have GameStop left

275
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
There's a lawsuit in there somewhere

276
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Monopoly?

277
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Trust me there's people that want to make game stores all the time

278
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And just like

279
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Blockbuster closing a bunch of stores

280
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And Hollywood closing a bunch of stores

281
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Well Hollywood's definitely going to be closing a lot of stores

282
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And the same with movie galleries and stuff

283
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
How that has sparked the independent

284
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Video growth

285
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Now you're gonna see

286
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The independent

287
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Game store growth go up a little bit

288
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I mean GameCrazies are out there

289
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Definitely not out there as heavily

290
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
As say GameStop

291
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Right now but

292
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
There's always alternatives

293
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Search them out

294
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You're also forgetting GameStop's biggest competitor

295
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
In some ways is Walmart

296
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Target

297
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Best Buy

298
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You know those are all big big game retailers

299
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Now as far as the used game market goes

300
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I don't know

301
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But you always hear rumors about those companies maybe wanting to get into it

302
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't know

303
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But it's just sad when

304
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
More stores like this close

305
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Especially when it affects people we know

306
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Very very well and so forth

307
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I hope things go okay in that situation

308
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Let us know if there's gonna be any good sales at least

309
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Whatever silver lining

310
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
We can find in this tragic news

311
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
They are in the middle of liquidation

312
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You know what they say, when life hands you lemons

313
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Throw them back

314
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Throw them against the wall, stomp on them, squish them

315
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You know what, no no no

316
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I like how Ron White puts it

317
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
To quote

318
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
When life gives you lemons, make lemonade

319
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Or when life gives you lemons

320
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Find someone who

321
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Who gives potatoes and makes them

322
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Put lemon vodka

323
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Or something

324
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I

325
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I said it wrong

326
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I said it wrong

327
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
When life gives you lemons, make lemonade

328
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And then go find someone whose life gave them vodka

329
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Alright

330
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Loki

331
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
How was your gaming week?

332
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I don't even remember if we were still talking about that or not

333
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Once in a while we talk about video games

334
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Amongst the guacamole and the vodka

335
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Ron White quotes gone horribly wrong

336
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yeah

337
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I played a few things this week

338
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I tried out some of the

339
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Upcoming Xbox Live arcade games

340
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I mean not anything I was really impressed with

341
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Cause they're just like ports of old arcade games

342
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Or semi-recent arcade games I guess

343
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Racestorm HD

344
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Kinda cool

345
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I actually have Racestorm on my

346
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
My arcade cabinet at home

347
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So

348
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Honestly it's just slightly

349
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Crisper graphics

350
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And that's it but otherwise it plays

351
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Pretty much exactly the same

352
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And then Neo Geo Battle

353
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Coliseum

354
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It was okay I actually never played that in the arcade

355
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And it was kinda neat to be able to

356
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Play as one of the characters from

357
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Metal Slug in a fighting game

358
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Cause he uses his gun a lot

359
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
But

360
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It was pretty cool so that should be coming out hopefully

361
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Soon I know Racestorm I think we have it

362
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
In the show role I think later on

363
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So that's also coming soon

364
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Then other things

365
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Play more Grand Theft Auto

366
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Still trying to

367
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Dominate that and

368
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Played against one guy today who thought

369
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I love these people that

370
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I play against that

371
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Think they're so good and gonna

372
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Teach me a lesson and stuff

373
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Then I get like a thousand

374
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Oh yeah

375
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
No no seriously they're like

376
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You better remember that

377
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yes you better remember that you got a lucky kill

378
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
On me after I chased you down through the entire

379
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Damn city trying to kill you even though I

380
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Was $1500 dollars ahead

381
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Oh yes you're so cool that you got one kill on me

382
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I guess that totally negates

383
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Those other 15 I got on you

384
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So you will remember that as the

385
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
One kill they got on you all day

386
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And then you quit. Loser

387
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And then

388
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I actually went back to playing

389
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
A little bit more free mode because it is damn

390
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Hard to get a ranked deathmatch game

391
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Nowadays especially in

392
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The Battle of Gay Tony so

393
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Free mode's actually been pretty fun we've been running

394
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Across a bunch of strange

395
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
People on there so

396
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Definitely a good time

397
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Waster

398
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Other non Grand Theft Auto

399
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Related stuff played some Marvel vs. Capcom

400
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
2 on my arcade cabinet

401
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Because I'm very excited

402
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
About the sequel coming out so

403
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Gotta get some of that

404
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
In

405
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Hopefully the server bought back because that's

406
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Awesome character to play as

407
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And then

408
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I think

409
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I think that's it for right now because I know I've been

410
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Playing a lot of stuff but I just can't remember all of it

411
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Alright

412
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Well last week I didn't play a whole lot of games

413
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So you guys would be very proud of me that I made up for lost time

414
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
This week I played Super Street Fighter 4

415
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I bought it on PS3 because as I mentioned

416
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
On the show a couple weeks ago

417
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I don't think I play enough

418
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Street Fighter to really justify the

419
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Arcade stick purchase

420
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But I am a fan enough of Street Fighter where I

421
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Want to buy the upgraded version of

422
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Street Fighter so I bought it on PS3 because I've

423
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Decided I'm declaring war on that

424
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
D-pad on the 360 and I'm not

425
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Gonna buy games on the

426
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
360 that

427
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Rely on that D-pad so much because

428
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's just poop and they need to

429
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Release a new controller I don't know why it's taking them so long

430
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So the Playstation 3

431
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
What's frustrating is they did

432
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
At one time remember in Europe

433
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
They had the green one and they fixed the D-pad

434
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Apparently

435
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Why would you

436
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
They're waiting for Natal or something I don't know

437
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
No they're not waiting for anything why would you

438
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Fix the problem and go

439
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Well we're not gonna fix it forever we're just gonna

440
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Fix it for this one run

441
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I know there's people out there and especially

442
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Xbox and so forth

443
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Believe me I hate on all systems equally

444
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
That are gonna tell me that

445
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You're just hating on Xbox

446
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
No it really made a difference

447
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I noticed the difference in actually being able to pull off

448
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Combos and certain controls and maneuvers

449
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
On the PS3 way easier

450
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Than I was on the 360 so I'm just putting it

451
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Out there that's a personal preference I suppose

452
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And everybody has their own but I did notice

453
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The difference right away in playing on the PS3

454
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
On that controller

455
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But the game itself putting the console

456
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Wars and so forth aside going to

457
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
The game itself I liked

458
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It quite a lot I thought it was a very worthy

459
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Upgrade and a good purchase you know

460
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Street Fighter 4 as it was was a great

461
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Game but this upgrade having all the

462
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Characters unlocked from the start having

463
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The extra 10 characters and some of the characters

464
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Are awesome like Dark Soccer said

465
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I love Juri as well she's awesome

466
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I like playing her online she's a cheap

467
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Mofo she is

468
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And I love cheap Mofo as in Street Fighter

469
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I was drawn

470
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
To her because you know when I was playing the game

471
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Alan was saying like she doesn't look like she belongs

472
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
In Street Fighter what is this what is

473
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Her she doesn't she doesn't fit

474
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
So I had to play as her and sure enough

475
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
She really kind of doesn't look like she belongs

476
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
In Street Fighter but she's cool

477
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But I will tell you who I love

478
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Is Guy that is

479
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Oh I love Guy that's my favorite character to play

480
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
He's just fun and I like how

481
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Like every you know parting shot

482
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Of him is his butt

483
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
They have this thing with butts in Super Street Fighter 4

484
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Have you noticed? No I mean

485
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Surprise no I just

486
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Really like playing as him because he can fly across

487
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
The screen and do all these cheap kick moves that I love

488
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I love Guy did you play Cody?

489
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
No but I

490
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Alan did and kicked my ass

491
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
He was throwing rocks at me and it was pissing me off

492
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yeah and picking up the knife and everything

493
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I think Guy can use him too though

494
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I tried playing Hakan and I thought

495
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The Turkish oil wrestler

496
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I thought he was kind of hokey I didn't like playing as him

497
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
But then again I'm not a big fan of the Zangief

498
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
T-Hawk type of characters

499
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Well the whole point with him is that you're supposed to

500
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Build up his oil

501
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You know over and over and over and when he's really slick

502
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Then you can do like all of these crazy moves

503
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yeah I know but

504
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I don't have the patience

505
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And I have to say though that

506
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
If you've ever seen Turkish oil wrestling

507
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
He's really glorifying it way too much

508
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I have to tell you though

509
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
This is a huge accomplishment for me

510
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I was playing matches online

511
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Ranked matches and winning some

512
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Like that's huge for me because I don't think

513
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I ever won a single one on 360

514
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
But I won my first match on PS3

515
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm not winning them all but I'm winning some

516
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I gotta say

517
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The skill match I'm getting

518
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Is actually pretty good because

519
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Like I will play a guy

520
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And go for like five rounds if the game

521
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Is configured that way and you know

522
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Win narrowly and

523
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
There will be like another guy I was fighting back and forth

524
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
We just kept coming up against each other

525
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Ranked matches and he won half and I won half

526
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Like it's actually really matching me up pretty well

527
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So I gotta uh

528
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I gotta say that

529
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Tigerclaw in chat says oh here's another thing guys

530
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
If you play as Guy or Cody in the car smasher bonus

531
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Stage you get the oh my car

532
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Easter egg, oh I thought that was normal

533
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Because the first time I ever played that bonus stage

534
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Was with Guy and I just thought

535
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
That was what was supposed to happen

536
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
But that makes sense because that happens in Final Fight too

537
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Speaking of Final Fight

538
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Alan and I decided just for the hell of it we would

539
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Play through all of Final Fight

540
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Double Impact version, the Final Fight game

541
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And so we played through the whole game

542
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The other night, it doesn't take that long

543
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Maybe an hour at most so that was kind of fun to play

544
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And so we went through that and

545
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
The other big big event

546
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
In my world is that I

547
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Finally said I can't take it anymore

548
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
With my old graphics card

549
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And I upgraded to a new video card

550
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
In my computer so

551
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Finally WoW is running at top speed

552
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
60 frames a second is beautiful

553
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Gorgeous but more importantly

554
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm also able to play

555
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Games on my PC that I wasn't able to

556
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Play before because my graphics card

557
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Was kind of shoddy and one of those big ones

558
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Would be Dragon Age so I

559
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Finally, because I bought Dragon Age during the Christmas

560
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Sale when it was only like 30 bucks

561
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
But I was really having a hard time

562
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Playing it because my old video card just couldn't

563
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Handle it and for those of you that are asking

564
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It was a 8, I originally

565
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Had an ATI Radeon

566
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
3300

567
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I think in my computer

568
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And so I decided

569
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I don't want to restart the video card wars

570
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
That were starting at the beginning of the show but I thought

571
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It would just be easier since my

572
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Computer had come with an ATI card originally

573
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Just to get another ATI card

574
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Call that stupid logic if you want

575
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Whatever I don't care the card I got works

576
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I got an ATI Radeon

577
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
5770

578
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And there was a lot of drama trying to get the card

579
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Installed because

580
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Bless Alan's heart he knows how to do all that stuff

581
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I could probably

582
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Figure it out but this thing

583
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Would have confused the hell out of me because this

584
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Graphic card like takes up two slots

585
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's so big and has like

586
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
This gigantic fan on it and that would have

587
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Confused me and then we had to actually

588
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Go upgrade the power supply

589
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Because it needs its own power source

590
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And like it can't run on

591
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
The old power supply I had

592
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
So yeah thank god he knew how to recognize all this

593
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Stuff because I would have just been lost and cried

594
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You might have been able to get away with the old power supply

595
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
If you had the converter for it but

596
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
We just got a new supply it was like 30 bucks

597
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And now it's like 600 watts

598
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
As opposed to 300 so it works great

599
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Oh 300 yeah

600
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
So yeah no the card works great

601
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I was able to play Dragon Age so I was playing that for a couple hours

602
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Did a little bit of the

603
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Warrior human beginning because Alan wanted to show me

604
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Some stuff there and I was

605
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Playing the mage opening a little bit earlier today

606
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Which played so much better

607
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
But I understand this game is on

608
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Consoles but man I can't

609
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Imagine how it must control on consoles because on

610
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
The computer it's just so

611
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Fluid and just makes sense

612
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Especially for like somebody who's kind of been playing

613
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
WoW a long time like me so

614
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I am considering checking out

615
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Star Trek online just because Dark Soccer

616
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Always never shuts up about it and

617
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's fun I know but here's the thing

618
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
There was a big sale on the store

619
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Steam store this weekend I couldn't resist

620
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I bought Guild Wars trilogy for 20 bucks

621
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And you got to admit

622
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's not a bad deal for Guild Wars

623
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Because Guild Wars is one of those games

624
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You don't pay a monthly fee for it so I

625
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Can buy it now and if I have the itch to play it

626
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
In like six months I can just say oh just fire

627
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Up Guild Wars Did you overclock your graphics card

628
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Once you got it? I don't think he did that

629
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Oh he should it's simple

630
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And it's extra

631
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Oomph it runs beautifully

632
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'll tell you what Guild Wars looks gorgeous

633
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I started playing the Prophecies

634
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Campaign as a Paragon which you know

635
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I had only I'm sorry no no

636
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
No Prophecies is the original so I was

637
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Playing Nightfall whatever the newest one is

638
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I played that as a

639
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Paragon which is one of the new classes

640
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
They're kind of like Egyptian influenced it seems like

641
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And so I was playing through the openings that it's

642
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Gorgeous oh my gosh

643
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Gorgeous looking stuff

644
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So I didn't really play it enough

645
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I mean both Dragon Age and Guild Wars I only

646
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Spent a couple hours with so but I just

647
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It's fun to be able to play PC games

648
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Again and not have my computer crying out

649
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
In pain from it and what's also

650
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Exciting and I just realized on the drive over

651
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Here is that

652
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Between that new card my quad core

653
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
My 8 gigs of ram I ain't gonna have a

654
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Problem playing Final Fantasy 14 on my PC

655
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Woo woo

656
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So waiting for that baby test

657
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Help

658
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I need to upgrade my graphics cards because I have two of them

659
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Running in SLI but they're like

660
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
8800 Radeon GTS

661
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
512

662
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Do you want my old card? I don't know what's better

663
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I have a power supply and an old video card

664
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
My card's way better than that

665
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It's just a lot of stuff

666
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Like if I were to go back and do it again

667
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
A lot of these games don't run

668
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
SLI and it's really disappointing

669
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And I guess you don't really get that much benefit from it nowadays

670
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
But um

671
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I don't know I've got two slots

672
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
To put graphics cards I almost feel obligated

673
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
To get two more but

674
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Brad from Pod Culture

675
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
In chat says Sky didn't know it was on sale

676
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You just sold me on it there you go

677
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
When you write NCsoft put

678
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
As heard on OLR

679
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
No but that's great no but I think the logic

680
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Is fine because you know 20 bucks

681
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
For the three game series and no monthly fee

682
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I mean that's a pretty darn good deal

683
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Guild Wars isn't a bad game by any means

684
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I don't think you'll play it forever

685
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
But I think you'll kind of go

686
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It's one of those games you'll be like

687
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You know I'm kind of bored of WoW and Star Trek

688
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And Final Fantasy and all the other MMOs

689
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm playing right now

690
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Just fire up Guild Wars for the hell of it

691
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
What the hell is going on in Guild Wars these days

692
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
That's kind of how I've found it

693
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I've played on and off for the past five years

694
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Alright anyhow enough of our gaming weeks

695
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Let's move on and get into some housekeeping tonight

696
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I don't have a lot except for

697
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I might not be here Memorial Day weekend

698
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It looks like I might be taking a trip

699
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
So we might not have a show then

700
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Pre-taped or something something

701
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
But that's the first time I'm also telling Jamie and Loki

702
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Because I didn't think of it earlier

703
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
We'll see

704
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Memorial Day weekend

705
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Three day weekend so if you guys want to get away

706
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I'm planning a trip it looks like

707
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I probably won't be here

708
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
We'll see

709
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It's not going to be an extravagant trip

710
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Just a little getaway

711
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Anyhow

712
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
More to come on that in the upcoming weeks

713
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
We'll let you know for sure what's going to happen

714
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
That's Memorial Day weekend

715
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Which I imagine a lot of our listeners

716
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
A lot of them are probably going out of town

717
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Anyhow

718
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Also our Twitter

719
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Twitter.com slash OLR and our Facebook

720
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Of course is available too at Orange Lounge Radio

721
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Join us there, friend us

722
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Like our posts, share us, help us spread the word

723
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Because we don't really have advertising dollars

724
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Another place where we could really use help

725
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
iTunes and five star reviews on iTunes

726
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Just look up Orange Lounge Radio in the iTunes store

727
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And say a couple nice words about Orange Lounge Radio

728
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
We really appreciate

729
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It really does go a long way

730
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Because the more positive reviews you get

731
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
The higher you go up in the rankings

732
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And you get a little more visibility

733
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And it works

734
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
That's why a lot of podcasts you listen to

735
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Want to get the reviews on iTunes

736
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Because sometimes it's hard to stand out amongst the crowd

737
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And I'll tell you what, it's tough

738
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
When you have G4 and IGN

739
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And GameSpot and all these companies with

740
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Limitless amounts of dollars

741
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And budget to pour into advertising

742
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
It's hard to stand out amongst that

743
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So we rely on the OL Army to help us out

744
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Alright, let's actually get into some gaming news

745
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
We'll have to actually put down the guacamole

746
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
For a little bit, step away from the vegetables

747
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And get into some actual gaming news

748
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Loki, start us off tonight

749
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I like to call this kind of like

750
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I don't want to go on the same tangent

751
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
As we did last week, but

752
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Kind of like Idols gives back

753
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
This is Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2

754
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Gives back, I guess

755
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Apparently with the new

756
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Firmware or dashboard

757
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
That was out

758
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
At the beginning of April

759
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
On the Xbox 360

760
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Comes with it some glitches

761
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
For some reason that work with

762
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2

763
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Allowing certain arcade games

764
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
That you may have in trial form

765
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
To work as a full game

766
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Instead, without having to pay

767
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Any extra monies

768
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Uh oh, uh oh

769
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So here's how it works, and it couldn't be

770
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Any simpler

771
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Of course you have to have the latest dashboard

772
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
The 9199, the one that allows

773
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
You to have the USB support

774
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Pop in your Modern Warfare 2 disk

775
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Let the game load up to the main menu

776
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Once you get to the main menu, hit the wonderful

777
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Xbox guide button

778
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
That's on your controller

779
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And it will pull up of course the old

780
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Kind of blades

781
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
That you can select stuff

782
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Go to quick launch

783
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And choose the trial game of choice

784
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
To play it as a full version

785
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Now this doesn't work on all games yet

786
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And there's really just a small list that they have

787
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
So far that it works with

788
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
But I mean, hey, might as well try it on

789
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Whatever

790
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Some of the games that have been shown to work with it so far

791
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Fatal Fury Special

792
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Metal Slug 3

793
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Samurai Shodown 2

794
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And Metal Slug 7

795
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
All those of course being published by SNK

796
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
So maybe other SNK games

797
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Might work as well

798
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Let's see

799
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And apparently also there might be

800
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
The King of Fighters 98 Ultimate Match

801
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And Guru

802
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Mark of Wolves

803
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I might play on it as well

804
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Okay, break this down for me

805
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
How smart do I have to be with my hacking cracking sense

806
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
To get this to work?

807
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You don't have to hack anything

808
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It's just part of the dashboard

809
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It's basically, it's just a glitch

810
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
All you have to do is pop in your game

811
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Modern Warfare 2

812
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Put a button on your controller

813
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And then select quick launch to

814
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
How does that happen?

815
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I don't know

816
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I don't know how you would figure it out either

817
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
That is really bad

818
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
It's not that we necessarily enjoy

819
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Bringing these things to light

820
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
But I think it needs to be said

821
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Like, oops

822
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
This is a huge flaw

823
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And you can earn achievements on those games as well

824
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Oh my gosh

825
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I would imagine it's gonna get patched out at some point

826
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
But might as well enjoy it while it lasts

827
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
We need to introduce something new here on

828
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Orange Lounge Radio called

829
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
The Dup Factor

830
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
That's right, the Dup Factor

831
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And the Dup Factor would be

832
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Days until the patch

833
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
DUP, Days Until Patch

834
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Loki, what do you believe is the

835
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Dup Factor?

836
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I'm not sure because I don't think this is

837
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
This hasn't been published on like

838
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Major blog sites or anything like that

839
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Usually when it does hit those

840
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Good thing no one listens to this show

841
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Yeah it's a good thing

842
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Once that happens they'll be like

843
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Because

844
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Obviously Microsoft doesn't read every forum

845
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Out there so

846
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
It's hard to say

847
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Yeah, so that's interesting

848
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And if you don't happen to have

849
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Mario Warfare 2 that's okay

850
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Because there's other glitches that also involve

851
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
The 9199 dashboard

852
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
As well, a couple of the games

853
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Were also found to be working

854
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
As full Xbox Live arcade

855
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Games as well

856
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Apparently

857
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Some of them have to do

858
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
With

859
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Like for example Worms

860
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Is one of the games that actually works as a full

861
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Xbox Live arcade game if you

862
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Transfer it to a USB card

863
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Because originally they did have

864
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
A version of Worms that came on a memory

865
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Unit and it actually worked as a full game

866
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
As long as it was on a memory

867
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Unit so you can try that as well

868
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And that doesn't require any sort of game

869
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Purchasing whatsoever

870
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And apparently

871
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Family Game Night has something else that

872
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Works like that as well

873
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
But I'm not sure

874
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
What's involved with that one

875
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
But it's just interesting to see

876
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
That a lot of these glitches are out there

877
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I put the dump factor at

878
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
7 days. I say by this time

879
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Next week it's out

880
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I think the

881
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Red alarms are going off at

882
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Microsoft as we speak

883
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I just found out about it this week

884
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
This has been posted for about 3 weeks

885
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Now so

886
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Has anyone, what was the last posting

887
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Date? The 22nd

888
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
So it may already

889
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
No

890
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It nothings

891
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
No I think somebody would have said something in that little thread he's looking at

892
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
If that's the case

893
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
We would have seen a patch on the dashboard

894
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Or we would have seen a patch for Call of Duty

895
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I say 7 days

896
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
We'll see

897
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Alright

898
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Now Loki I'm sure you would not be taking

899
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Advantage of a patch like this

900
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Or if you have it's only for journalistic purposes

901
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I don't really care

902
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And honestly

903
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Yeah it's just the SNK games

904
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Well

905
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Dude I have a JTAG console

906
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I don't need this crap

907
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Alright

908
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Moving on to other stories

909
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
That aren't so shady

910
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
But more of a surprise I think in some ways

911
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Nintendo Magazine in France

912
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Apparently has confirmed the existence of

913
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Red Steel 3

914
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Apparently the series

915
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Which as you know is kind of like a first person hack and slash

916
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Type of thing

917
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
It's going to be a trilogy even though apparently the second game

918
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Did not sell that well which you were talking about last week

919
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
On the show right Loki?

920
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Red Steel 2 not doing so hot?

921
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Well they were saying it wasn't doing hot

922
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Because they only have data from like

923
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
You know what 10 days

924
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Not that long

925
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Well apparently the game is going to support

926
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
The Wii Vitality sensor

927
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Oh god fail

928
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Right there fail

929
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I'm sorry

930
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
That's going to be awful okay

931
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Absolutely awful because

932
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
What's the point at that

933
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So how are you going to control the game now

934
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Because you're going to have

935
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Where are you going to plug the nunchuck into

936
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And come up with some sort of splitter or something like that

937
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
For the Wii remote

938
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I can't see how this is going to work

939
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I don't know either

940
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I don't write the news I just report it just so you know

941
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Fail

942
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
That's all I got to say

943
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I was looking for a clip of the old school DDR failed boys

944
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
To play

945
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Behind that

946
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
There was a couple other things I wanted to say about this

947
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It's supposed to

948
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I guess this is just part of

949
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
If you think about it Red Steel 2

950
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Supported the motion plus

951
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Red Steel was kind of a launch

952
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Title for the Wii

953
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It would not be a surprise if this supports the Vitality sensor

954
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Because it's just yet another add on

955
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Of Nintendo's that Ubisoft is supporting

956
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
The only one that Red Steel really didn't

957
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Get on was the balance board

958
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
To be honest

959
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
So

960
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
There you go even though Loki is not a big fan of it

961
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Apparently Red Steel 3 with Vitality sensors

962
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
The Vitality sensor is retarded

963
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I'm sorry it's absolutely retarded

964
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Yeah it will be wonderful

965
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
For the Wii Relax game that comes out

966
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And people will buy it because it's like

967
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Oh look you can relax now

968
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Now that Nintendo is helping you

969
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
How do you really know yet though

970
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I mean all you've really heard about this

971
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Is a concept you haven't seen it in motion yet

972
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Maybe it will be neat

973
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
No it won't

974
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
That's like saying oh blood pressure

975
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
You know I get to take my blood pressure now

976
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
That's so exciting

977
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I mean old people are like that

978
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
You know they go to the drug store

979
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Take their blood pressure

980
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Well I beg to differ

981
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Who's buying the Wii

982
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I actually beg to differ

983
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Well they're not going to be playing Red Steel 3

984
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I

985
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Well this is someone who gets a blood test twice a year

986
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And has her blood pressure checked regularly

987
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So

988
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Yeah but is it fun

989
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
If it keeps me alive

990
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Yeah but I don't consider that fun

991
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I had to have four MRIs

992
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
A couple years ago to keep me alive

993
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
But I wasn't exactly like gosh I wish I had one of these at home

994
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
It's a lot of fun

995
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
It's like a colonoscopy

996
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Oh that helps you stay alive

997
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Some people get off on that

998
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
The Wii virtual colon sensor

999
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Thanks god

1000
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
For when the Human Centipede video game comes out

1001
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I'm just saying though

1002
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Fun aside

1003
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I do want to say

1004
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
They'll be illegitimate

1005
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And they did say there was like a subtitle

1006
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
At least on the Human Centipede

1007
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
That it makes it seem like it's going to be one of a series

1008
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
So I'm like

1009
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
That discussion on that movie

1010
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Has gotten far too much airtime

1011
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
On the all news network

1012
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Let's move on to some more

1013
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Video game stories

1014
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I was actually putting something up for you Rob

1015
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
What's that

1016
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Come and look at it

1017
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Is that Gaia?

1018
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Yes it is but so they put up an item called

1019
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Starmony

1020
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
That's a little rainbow unicorn that says open your eyes

1021
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Loki's the rainbow unicorn fan

1022
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Not me

1023
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Who's the one that's always playing the rainbow unicorn game

1024
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
That would be Loki

1025
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
You need to put that on his wall

1026
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm going to post it on my Facebook later

1027
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
But I thought it was funny

1028
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Anyway

1029
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
So how about a story

1030
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
How about something about Guitar Hero

1031
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I think

1032
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Is that

1033
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Activision is sending out the feelers

1034
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
To see if people would be interested

1035
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
In Red Hot Chili Peppers

1036
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Guitar Hero

1037
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I guess but aren't most of their songs

1038
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
In like Rock Band or Guitar Hero

1039
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Already?

1040
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Isn't the whole Blood Sugar Sex Magic album

1041
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
On Rock Band?

1042
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I think that it's

1043
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Supposed to also have an exclusive

1044
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
For their new album

1045
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Oh

1046
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
That's at least the speculation

1047
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
But then again

1048
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
You can get the whole thing of Blood Sugar Sex Magic

1049
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
On Rock Band

1050
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
But I mean

1051
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
The Red Hot Chili Peppers were much more than one album

1052
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I mean they are

1053
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
They're an important band

1054
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I've been listening to their stuff since George Clinton produced them

1055
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
You know

1056
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
P-Funk

1057
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Parliament

1058
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Multicolored dreads

1059
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
They gotta be older

1060
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I think

1061
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
40's at most

1062
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
They've been doing it a long time

1063
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I was listening

1064
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Blood Sugar Sex Magic came out

1065
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
When I was in high school

1066
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And I had already been listening to

1067
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Actually a song off of Mother's Milk

1068
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Was in Say Anything

1069
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
So that's late 80's

1070
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I think they started in

1071
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
84?

1072
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Well I mean if Green Day

1073
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Can have their own game

1074
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
But Red Hot Chili Peppers is far more

1075
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Expansive than Green Day

1076
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I agree to an extent

1077
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Yeah

1078
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
But

1079
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I think it's a good choice

1080
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
For their own video game

1081
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I would look at it

1082
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I don't know if I'd pay $50 for it

1083
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
But I'd look at it and I'd go oh neat I like these songs

1084
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
You know

1085
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
So

1086
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
We'll see though I don't know

1087
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
There's a part of me that goes I don't know Guitar Hero Van Halen

1088
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Was kind of poop

1089
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Yeah

1090
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
They're better off sticking with Rock Band

1091
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Just putting out more content for Rock Band

1092
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
We'll see

1093
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Well I'm just like

1094
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Cause I thought they were supposed to be

1095
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Cutting back

1096
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Well I guess they sort of have cut back on Guitar Hero a little bit

1097
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Cause we haven't had a game in like 6 months

1098
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Well not 6 months 4 months

1099
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Yeah 6 months

1100
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Is that counting DS versions and all that?

1101
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
And yes

1102
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It does count DS versions and whatnot

1103
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
And nothing I've seen

1104
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
On the horizon yet until like

1105
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Fall

1106
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Which is good

1107
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
So here's a rumor that's kind of interesting

1108
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
We may have talked about it

1109
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
A little bit before when it was

1110
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Discovered as a trademark

1111
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
From Konami, Harmony of Despair

1112
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Well the

1113
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
A trusted source as

1114
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Joisic puts it

1115
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Harmony of Despair

1116
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Is a 2D 6 player

1117
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Xbox Live arcade game

1118
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You'll get to play as some of the old

1119
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Characters or I guess main characters from a bunch

1120
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Of different games and it's supposed to kind of

1121
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Appear like

1122
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
The Game Boy Advance or DS

1123
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Versions

1124
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Of the game so I guess like you know

1125
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Super NES type of thing

1126
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And you'll get to play

1127
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
With a bunch of people at the same time

1128
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And they'll actually be able to zoom out

1129
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
To show where everyone's at

1130
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And stuff like that so 6 player co-op

1131
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Castlevania sounds kind of fun actually

1132
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I feel like God has finally

1133
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Listened to me, thank you

1134
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Thank you Jesus

1135
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
This is what I've been asking for

1136
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
For how long now on this program

1137
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Give me a old school

1138
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
2D new Castlevania

1139
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Game on my television

1140
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And this sounds sweet that it's gonna be like

1141
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
6 player zoomy in out co-op stuff

1142
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Sounds kind of rad actually

1143
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Sounds way better than Judgment

1144
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And then when you're done with this Nintendo give us a new Metroid like this

1145
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And then when you're done with this

1146
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Konami can come back and give me a new Contra like this

1147
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
No Frogger

1148
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Do not want Frogger

1149
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
With 6 people

1150
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Unless it's an

1151
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Extreme Frogger

1152
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I gotta admit though this sounds very awesome

1153
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Like can you imagine being able to explore

1154
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
The castle with multiple people at the same time

1155
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
But how would that work because

1156
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
There's gonna have to be some type of like

1157
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Random castle generator element

1158
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
To it or something or else it's always gonna be the

1159
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Same damn game

1160
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Obviously this is a very

1161
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Early type of story and it's also rumor right

1162
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
It's not confirmed

1163
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
But maybe they're gonna have multiple castles

1164
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Or something like that or you'll be able to download

1165
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Extra castles later on

1166
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I really want more information on this soon

1167
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
This sounds great

1168
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Or maybe that partner net site

1169
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Will leak everything like it always does

1170
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
That would be wonderful too

1171
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I know what do you think your

1172
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Castlevania fan Dark Soccer would like to see?

1173
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Oh I'd be all over that heck yeah

1174
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
We're gonna play 6 player heck yeah

1175
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Dude totally

1176
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
That's right I'll whip you

1177
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
But think about it I bet Dark Soccer

1178
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
If they're talking about multiple characters

1179
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
You'll get to be

1180
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
You'll get to be Alucard

1181
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
You'll get to be Maria

1182
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I bet hands down a lot of the famous Castlevania

1183
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I do remember they had

1184
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I would have to play

1185
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
They had Alucard on the list

1186
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
There was another site that covered it also

1187
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
They had some more information but

1188
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I remember Alucard being on the list

1189
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Amae Satsuma in our chatroom

1190
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
chat.orangelandstrategy.com says

1191
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I'd be fine with a 6 player Frogger

1192
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
If I could play as a truck

1193
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
That would be awesome

1194
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I want to play as a gator

1195
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
That's like Frogger versus

1196
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Remember in Pacman versus you could be the ghost

1197
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
That would be amazingly fun

1198
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Total side note

1199
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
It's not on our show roll but I think this chatroom

1200
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Comment is worth reading Spyro in our chat says

1201
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Is there no more game room games being

1202
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Released now? You know they were supposed

1203
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
To put out like Pitfall

1204
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
And Super

1205
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Breakout I think were some of the big

1206
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Games this week and it got halted

1207
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
The release just

1208
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Didn't end up happening

1209
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And there was actually a tweet

1210
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Over on god I can't believe I'm using

1211
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Twitter but the thing is

1212
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Game room did not have much of a good

1213
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Website behind it I mean I guess they have an official

1214
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Website but it kind of sucks

1215
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
They don't have the greatest web presence I don't know

1216
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
This thing was kind of set up to fail from the beginning

1217
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
But on their Twitter which is

1218
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
At live game room they say

1219
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
First off they

1220
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Broke the news by

1221
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Retweeting Major Nelson

1222
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Just shows you how

1223
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It's totally burped excuse me

1224
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
That's awesome

1225
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Professional radio

1226
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
They broke the news by retweeting

1227
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Major Nelson saying

1228
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
We're working to bring you additional game room titles

1229
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
As soon as possible I'll let you know

1230
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
The moment I have more details

1231
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
And then they

1232
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Sent an at message to somebody

1233
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Saying there was a delay in the game pack release

1234
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
We'll update when we've got more details

1235
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
That's it

1236
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
So I mean fail fail fail fail

1237
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I kind of regret

1238
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
A couple weeks ago when I was

1239
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Reviewing game room on the show I said

1240
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Hey this is going to be better than

1241
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Virtual Console because at least you know

1242
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Although it has plenty of room for improvement

1243
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It's more than just straight up ports of the games

1244
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Well I mean

1245
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
At least games are

1246
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Coming out for Virtual Console

1247
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
It just

1248
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Irritates me because there was so

1249
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Much potential

1250
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Here

1251
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Can you imagine if they had

1252
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I'm sorry they have just crashed

1253
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And burned with

1254
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It's so frustrating

1255
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
It's an awesome idea

1256
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Well they should have integrated it with

1257
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Like different Xbox Live

1258
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Arcade games so it wouldn't matter

1259
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
That they're not putting out any because you could

1260
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Still use your Xbox Live arcade games

1261
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
And have them in your arcade

1262
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And what not

1263
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And then here's the thing

1264
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
SHJ100Matt says Seriously game room was supposed to be

1265
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Microsoft's answer to home

1266
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
But it's just as much of a failure as home so far

1267
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
That is

1268
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I don't know if I'm okay with the game room

1269
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Home comparisons

1270
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I think people assumed

1271
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
It was going to be like home

1272
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Because you would be able to navigate around in the first person

1273
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Which was I don't think ever the case

1274
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I think Microsoft's always kind of strung you along

1275
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
With the well maybe we'll implement that someday

1276
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Dude you can't even fucking release

1277
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
A new pack for the game on time

1278
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
You're not going to have the full

1279
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
First person movement around like home

1280
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Ever

1281
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Ever

1282
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Prove me wrong please

1283
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I'm just irritated because the problem is

1284
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
If this fails

1285
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Which it's starting to look more and more like it's going to

1286
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And how fucking disappointing is that

1287
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
That we're never going to get any more packs for this game

1288
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
At the rate we're going

1289
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
You know whatever happened to like the 1000 games

1290
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
If this thing fails

1291
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
We're not going to see anything like it

1292
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Until maybe the next generation

1293
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Maybe

1294
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Maybe on Nintendo's Wii HD

1295
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Or whatever console they do after the Wii

1296
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Maybe they will finally say

1297
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Okay you can play the old NES games

1298
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Over the internet after you re-buy them

1299
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
For five bucks a piece

1300
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Just irritates me

1301
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I am mad

1302
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Anyway

1303
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Rob

1304
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Deep breaths

1305
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
As a retro game fan

1306
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
You know I was really excited about

1307
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
A lot that Game Room had to bring

1308
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And it didn't really suck

1309
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I mean there was a lot of promise with it

1310
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I mean yeah they could have had a little more

1311
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Hopefully

1312
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I'm just overreacting and this is all fixed

1313
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
In a week I mean maybe they had problems

1314
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
With the whole PC and I heard people

1315
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Were able to hack certain games in Game Room

1316
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Like a lot of the high scores on asteroids

1317
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Were faked so maybe for quality

1318
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Purposes they pulled it back

1319
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
But when I hear about these layoffs

1320
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
When I see crappy web support

1321
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
You know for this

1322
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
My hope fades more and more

1323
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I have a feeling that there's going to be all sorts of

1324
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Exploits

1325
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
With it because it's in file form

1326
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
And people have modded consoles

1327
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And they're going to hex edit crap

1328
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
So that they can cheat in the games

1329
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
It's going to script the leaderboards

1330
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Prove me wrong Microsoft please

1331
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Please I would love to get proven wrong on this

1332
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Meanwhile other news

1333
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
PlayStation 3 and here's something

1334
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Else to rage about

1335
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Of course

1336
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
We reported a couple weeks ago on the show

1337
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And I'm sure you read about it everywhere on the internet

1338
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
You saw this first hand

1339
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
They took out the other OS feature

1340
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
On the PlayStation 3

1341
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
They released a patch to do nothing

1342
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
But remove a feature on the PlayStation 3

1343
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
And I believe we said

1344
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Oh I wonder how long before somebody sues

1345
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Well days until suing

1346
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Would apparently be about two weeks

1347
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
That's right about 14 days

1348
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Somebody sued

1349
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
A class action lawsuit for removing

1350
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
The PlayStation 3 support for other OS's

1351
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Anthony Ventura is the

1352
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Class action lawsuit filers name

1353
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
The plaintiff

1354
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I'm a plaintiff

1355
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
He filed a class action lawsuit against the company

1356
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Saying that it's a breach of contract

1357
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
False advertising

1358
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And you know all this other big legal words

1359
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
He says that the other OS function is extremely

1360
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Valuable

1361
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Although players are not forced to download the update

1362
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
If you don't you can't access

1363
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
The other features on your PlayStation

1364
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
So you're either locked out over here

1365
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Or you're locked out over here

1366
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Apparently the amount is in excess

1367
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Of five million dollars

1368
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Is how much they're looking to get in damages

1369
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I don't know if it'll work

1370
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
But it's interesting that somebody's actually

1371
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Filed the lawsuit over this

1372
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
As I suspected somebody probably

1373
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Would in this too happy nation that we're in

1374
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I don't know what do you guys think

1375
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Will happen with this lawsuit

1376
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I don't know it'd be interesting to see

1377
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
How it plays out

1378
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I'm interested because I have a system

1379
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
That you know hasn't been updated yet

1380
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
And I'm not planning on updating it

1381
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Because guess what I haven't bought any new games

1382
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
For it since

1383
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
LittleBigPlanet

1384
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I think the biggest kicker here is

1385
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Are they gonna be able to prove that this was

1386
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
An advertised feature

1387
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
That's gonna be tough

1388
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And I don't think they're gonna be able to get away with it

1389
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Maybe in other countries but not here

1390
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I don't remember that being advertised

1391
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
It's not on a commercial or something

1392
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
But they did advertise it coming out of E3

1393
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
And that kind of stuff

1394
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
It's a console it's not like you know

1395
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
People didn't know it was there

1396
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
But I do think it's kind of

1397
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Messed up

1398
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
It's the whole kind of conspiracy part of it

1399
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Or I guess paranoia part of it

1400
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
It's like if they're gonna take this out

1401
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Because some hacker or whatever

1402
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Found a way around

1403
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
You know their copy protection

1404
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Which didn't really happen

1405
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I don't think anyone's actually found a way around

1406
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Their copy protection yet other than the fact that

1407
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
They're starting to mess around

1408
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
With Linux but

1409
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
You know if that's the case

1410
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Then what if someone finds a way with

1411
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
You know the Xbox or not Xbox

1412
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
PlayStation 1 emulation or something like that

1413
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Or are they gonna remove that too

1414
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Or you know

1415
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Even on older consoles

1416
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
That can play PlayStation 2 games what if they find a way with that

1417
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Are they gonna remove the PlayStation 2

1418
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
You know backwards compatibility

1419
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I'm surprised they haven't

1420
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
So I don't know

1421
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And yeah let's just say for example

1422
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
That they decide later on

1423
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Hey you know what we're gonna start selling PlayStation 2 games

1424
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
On the PlayStation Network

1425
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Now we're gonna remove your backwards compatibility

1426
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
So you have to buy those games from us

1427
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Again

1428
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
That would be kind of shady

1429
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
And if you want to play your PlayStation 2 games

1430
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
You can go buy one of our $99.99

1431
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
PlayStation 2 slim systems

1432
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
But at the same time

1433
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Let me play devil's advocate for a minute here

1434
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Because Rama says forget the lawsuit

1435
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
People just trade in your PS3's

1436
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
For something worthwhile

1437
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
That chat coming from chat.orangestonsrated.com

1438
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Well I mean to play devil's advocate

1439
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
You never could install Linux on a 360

1440
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
You can't even get the web on your 360

1441
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I mean

1442
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
You can now but

1443
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Well

1444
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Without legitimately

1445
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
None of these features are possible

1446
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I mean you can still get the other OS feature

1447
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
On your PlayStation 3 too if you know where to look

1448
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Right

1449
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Um

1450
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Not yet

1451
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Well it's being worked on or something

1452
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Anyway

1453
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Uh yeah I guess we'll see what develops with this

1454
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
It'll be very interesting though because you know what happens

1455
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Is that if this guy wins

1456
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
You'll all be able to get a check in the mail for like

1457
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Five whole dollars

1458
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Cause that's what happens with class action lawsuits

1459
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Or maybe they'll have to give out a free game or something

1460
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I don't know

1461
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Yeah but I mean what if that free game is like

1462
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Yaris 2 for the PS3 or something

1463
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
It doesn't have to be a good game

1464
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Freeze free?

1465
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I don't know

1466
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
There's some things that you couldn't even pay me to play for free

1467
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
It's like bad

1468
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Anyway let's move on more gaming news Darcy

1469
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
How about something happier? Yes happy happy joy joy

1470
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Cub Scouts!

1471
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I thought you said happier

1472
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Yeah okay I know little Mormons in training

1473
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Um sorry I didn't say that

1474
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I was in the Cub Scouts for a year

1475
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
One whole year

1476
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I was in the Cub Scouts and the Boy Scouts

1477
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Never became a Mormon

1478
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
In fact I

1479
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Just learned how to set fire to things and tie knots

1480
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I forgot the knots part

1481
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Oh if only they knew I was a gay in training

1482
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
It's so awesome though

1483
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I mean seriously if you want to have fun as

1484
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
You know in the Boy Scouts or something like that

1485
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Just buy the damn manual

1486
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Give it to your kid, have them read through it

1487
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
That's all the information you need

1488
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
The rest is just camping trips and pinewood car derby

1489
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
That's all it really is

1490
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
So about video games

1491
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
That was awesome

1492
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I love how Dark Soccer is like

1493
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I swear to god I have news to report

1494
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Will you boys stop reminiscing about your stupid scout troops?

1495
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
We build wooden cars

1496
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Just so you know

1497
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Anyway hi

1498
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
So for the Cub Scouts

1499
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
There's a new

1500
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
A new badge available

1501
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Or sorry belt loop

1502
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Or whatever the crap that means

1503
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
You can get a video game

1504
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Belt loop

1505
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I guess

1506
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I don't get a belt loop

1507
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I don't remember them having

1508
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I remember the badges

1509
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
They actually could sew on and then there was the little

1510
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Patches, there were patches and there were badges

1511
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
So now they have belt loops too whatever

1512
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
They get more bling

1513
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
It was pins back in my day

1514
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Yeah that's what I meant, pins

1515
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I remember they would flip the kid upside down

1516
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
And put the pin on when the kid was upside down

1517
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
And then like when you actually did

1518
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Whatever your parents could turn it right

1519
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Side up as if you weren't capable of just

1520
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Doing it yourself but

1521
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
If you did you'd go to hell

1522
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I remember that part

1523
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
You actually need to watch the episode

1524
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Of bullshit about scouting

1525
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
You make John Smith cry

1526
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
They took

1527
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Anyway I'm gonna

1528
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Can I tell you a true story? I'm sorry Dark Soccer

1529
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I know you have a legitimate gaming story here

1530
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Hey guess what? What? My mother

1531
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Carrot Pulled me out of Cub Scout

1532
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
She didn't want me going anymore

1533
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
You know why? True story

1534
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
She didn't like the other kids in my troop

1535
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
She thought all the other kids in my troop

1536
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
And 10 years later

1537
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
She told me this

1538
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
All the other little kids in your troop

1539
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Were little assholes

1540
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I love your mom

1541
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
And I didn't want you hanging out with those assholes

1542
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I love your mom

1543
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
So Rob

1544
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I'm not saying that you might be listening to the show

1545
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I'm just saying that

1546
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
The Roseville troop was a bunch of assholes

1547
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Allegedly

1548
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
So the whole way to get

1549
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
This video game belt loop

1550
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
You have to complete three tasks

1551
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
And I think this is actually a really positive thing

1552
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Explain why it's important to have a rating system

1553
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
For video games

1554
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
With an adult's help

1555
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Make a schedule to do things that include your

1556
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Chores, homework, video games

1557
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
And you have to stick to schedule

1558
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
And learn to play any video game that is approved

1559
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
By your parent, guardian, or teacher

1560
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
So I guess imagine babies might be on it or something

1561
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
After you get the belt loop

1562
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Um

1563
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
You earn a pin by

1564
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Completing five of nine tasks

1565
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Which would be

1566
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
With your parents create a plan to buy a video game

1567
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
That is right for your age group

1568
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
That's hard

1569
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Compare two game systems

1570
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Explain the differences between the two

1571
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
And good purchase

1572
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Or use of a game system

1573
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Play a video game with family members

1574
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
In a family tournament

1575
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Teach an adult or friend how to play a video game

1576
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
List at least five tips that would help someone

1577
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Who was learning how to play your favorite video game

1578
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Play an appropriate video game

1579
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
With a friend for one hour

1580
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
So no imagine babies

1581
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Play a video game that will help

1582
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Practice math, spelling, or other skills

1583
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
To help you in your school work

1584
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Choose a game you might like to purchase

1585
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
And compare the price at three different stores

1586
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
To decide which one is the best deal

1587
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Include

1588
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Factors like return policy and warranty

1589
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
And with an adult supervision

1590
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Install a gaming system

1591
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Um

1592
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Okay

1593
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I think it's good because it's encouraging

1594
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
You know, family time

1595
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
It could be good for parents

1596
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
To demystify

1597
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Video games

1598
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Yeah, it's not a bad thing

1599
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I know we're sitting here and tee-heeing about it

1600
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
But it's encouraging

1601
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
What should be happening in the first place

1602
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Parents and kids to talk about

1603
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
The kids hobby

1604
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Who would have thought

1605
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
When I was a kid, my papa and I

1606
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
My dad's father

1607
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
We used to sit around playing Jackal

1608
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
On Nintendo

1609
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
On the big screen TV

1610
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Which is a war game where you shoot people

1611
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
And run over them in a tank

1612
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
And we played, get this

1613
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Abadox

1614
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Disgusting game at the time

1615
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I love Abadox for the record

1616
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I could imagine coming home from a Cub Scout meeting

1617
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
And telling my mom

1618
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Hey mom, uh

1619
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I want to get this video game badge that they're giving away

1620
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
So would you sit for me for an hour

1621
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
While I install a video game system

1622
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
And show you how to do it? She'd just be like

1623
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Where's the paper that I just signed?

1624
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Hahahaha

1625
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Well also, um

1626
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,000
There, um

1627
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I think that that kind of also

1628
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
You know, sort of discounts

1629
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
The fact that a lot of these parents might have grown up

1630
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
With video games too

1631
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
You know, my mom and I used to play

1632
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Tetris together

1633
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
And we used to play Super Mario Brothers

1634
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
In all kinds of games and

1635
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Okay

1636
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Stop trying to smack the fly

1637
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
With your pizza box

1638
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
You're gonna fly on the loose in the studio

1639
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Keep in mind

1640
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
It flew outside, it flew outside

1641
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Stay out

1642
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
In two days it will be dead

1643
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Not if I can help it

1644
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I'll take that long

1645
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Flies really don't live longer than a few days

1646
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
That's the comfort I take in that

1647
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
They're going to die soon

1648
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Tangent Lounge Radio, back to the Cub Scouts please

1649
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I have carrots

1650
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
They're delicious and raw

1651
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Cub Scouts!

1652
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
They should program a game

1653
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I'm very disappointed, well that's a programming badge

1654
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Um, I'm very disappointed though

1655
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
That not one of those little

1656
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I guess, uh

1657
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Achievements or requirements on that list

1658
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Is go to arcade

1659
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Well, cause there are no arcades

1660
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
That's a myth

1661
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
In some parts of the

1662
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
States, there are no arcades

1663
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Well then, you know what, you don't really want that badge now

1664
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Do you?

1665
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Here's the thing, the only problem

1666
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I don't want to even like open this door

1667
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
And go there, but you know, I live there

1668
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Uh, the only problem I have

1669
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
With this badge, like I think it's a good thing

1670
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
And it's encouraging the family to talk, yada yada yada

1671
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Is that this badge could go right next to your

1672
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Queer hating badge, because

1673
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
You know, the Boy Scouts won't

1674
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
You know the whole thing about how, you know

1675
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
They won't let, um

1676
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Gay guys be Scout Masters and so forth

1677
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Because apparently

1678
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
All gay guys know how to do

1679
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Is molest kids

1680
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
They won't let them be Scouts

1681
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
At all

1682
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I think at that age, you're kind of too

1683
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Young to know anyway, so I think

1684
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
That arguments are relevant, like

1685
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Honestly, like, you know, how

1686
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Old are Boy Scouts, like 12 to like

1687
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
15, like you just

1688
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Here, everything

1689
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Is, it's not even

1690
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
An issue at that age, you know what I mean, if it is an issue

1691
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
You're too young, just don't even

1692
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Think about that stuff, but um

1693
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
You know, it does kind of

1694
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Irritate me that they don't really have

1695
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
A good reason for

1696
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Justifying why

1697
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I don't know why homos

1698
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Will want to be involved with such an organization

1699
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
That hates them, but if they do, they should

1700
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
You know, get to do it. My problem is, why is this

1701
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Even a badge in the first place, because I thought

1702
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
The Boy Scouts and Cub Scouts and whatever

1703
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Were all about, kind of like

1704
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
The whole outdoors, you know

1705
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
The Woodsmen, you know

1706
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Type mentality, where it's like learning

1707
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
How to kind of, not really necessarily

1708
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Survive, but there are survival

1709
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Tools in there as well, and

1710
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
You know, kind of, you know, how to be

1711
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Good, you know, participant

1712
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
In your, you know

1713
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Social circle or whatever

1714
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
You know, being a good community member, I thought that was

1715
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Really the values that they were

1716
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Trying to put forth, and this is kind of

1717
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Unnecessary, because like, I mean seriously

1718
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
They're gonna have a badge for learning how to use windows

1719
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
You know, or, look, I installed

1720
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
The Mac today, or you know, I've

1721
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I don't know

1722
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I learned how to program my VCR

1723
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
My TiVo badge, you know, and seriously

1724
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
It's not really necessary

1725
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
It's kind of just

1726
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Good that you know how to do that stuff

1727
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
And good that you're spending time with your family

1728
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
And that kind of thing, but

1729
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
It doesn't need to be a badge

1730
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I think it's just being

1731
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Used as a convenient tool

1732
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
To teach economics

1733
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Good shopping skills and family

1734
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
I think it's just Boy Scouts trying to be hip

1735
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I think you're right

1736
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Because maybe the

1737
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Memberships are down or something

1738
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
It's fine

1739
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Question, or I'm sorry, comment

1740
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
From the chatroom, chat.org.org.com

1741
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Sharan in chat says, you don't need to be gay

1742
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
To know how to molest children

1743
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
No, you just have to know how to be a priest

1744
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Ohhhhh, and if that joke offended

1745
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
You, guess what, now you know how

1746
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Offended I get when I hear

1747
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
The rationalization for why gays

1748
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Can't be in Boy Scouts, and there

1749
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
You have it

1750
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
See, I offended people but to teach a lesson

1751
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Now you know how I feel

1752
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Alright

1753
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
It is offensive, moving on

1754
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Release dates

1755
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Let's go to the US and see what games

1756
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Are gonna be coming out soon, Loki

1757
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Not much, this week is pretty light

1758
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
And it's sad that one of the biggest

1759
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Games this week is actually

1760
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Iron Man 2

1761
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Of course, coming out on

1762
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Friday in theaters

1763
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
You gotta have your typical movie tying game

1764
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
But don't worry, Sega says that this game

1765
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Isn't crap like the last one

1766
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
That's famous last

1767
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Words from people that make crappy ported

1768
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Or movie tying games

1769
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Other fun

1770
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Stuff coming out this week, Picross

1771
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
3D

1772
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Picross, but it's in 3D form

1773
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
And you make nice little cube animals

1774
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
The Total War

1775
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Battle Pack, kind of a

1776
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Pre-release of the Total War games

1777
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Coming out on PC this week

1778
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Fat Princess Fistful of Cake

1779
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Making its way out on UMD

1780
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
For the PSP, of course it's

1781
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I think already out on the PSP

1782
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
In the PlayStation Network

1783
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Dance Sensation

1784
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Kind of

1785
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Trying to take advantage of the adjust

1786
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Dance craze, but

1787
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Purely aimed at girls

1788
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
And Dementium 2

1789
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Out on DS, this would be the perfect

1790
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Game to purchase for that

1791
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Cup Scout badge

1792
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
And

1793
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Also this week, the official

1794
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Xbox 360

1795
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
USB Flash Sticks

1796
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
These are hilarious

1797
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
And I'm laughing at the prices

1798
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
An 8GB

1799
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
USB flash drive will cost you

1800
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
$39.99 and

1801
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
A 16GB flash drive

1802
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Will run you $69.99

1803
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
I was just pricing these online

1804
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Because I'm planning on picking up an 8GB

1805
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
And guess what, you can get them for about half the price

1806
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
So really, thank you Microsoft

1807
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
For still overcharging

1808
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
It's not gonna work as well with

1809
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
A USB stick

1810
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
And that's it for this week

1811
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Let's head on over to Japan

1812
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
And look at the Japanese releases

1813
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
What's coming out on the Xbox 360

1814
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
This week, really nothing, believe it or not

1815
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Not really anything coming out at all

1816
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
On the Xbox 360 this week

1817
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Again, these are Japanese releases

1818
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
And sometimes, you know, there's big variants

1819
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
On the Playstation 3

1820
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Also not a lot coming out this week

1821
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I don't know what, is there like a holiday or something

1822
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Going on in Japan right now?

1823
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Golden Week

1824
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
It's a big

1825
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
No, no, no

1826
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
If I remember right, Golden Week

1827
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Is when families go back to their hometowns

1828
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
And

1829
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
They visit with people, like everything's closed

1830
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
I just know the 5th of May is Children's Day

1831
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Oh, maybe that explains

1832
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Where the holiday comes from in WoW

1833
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Because it's Children's Week in WoW right now

1834
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Yeah, I totally just made a Warcraft reference

1835
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Hey, Nintendo Wii, also nothing

1836
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
This week, really, no releases till the 13th of May

1837
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Playstation 2

1838
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Nothing, DS, nothing

1839
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
PSP, nothing

1840
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Nothing is coming out in Japan until the 13th

1841
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Okay, by the way, I found it

1842
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
What's that?

1843
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
It's a paid time off

1844
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
On the work days

1845
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Some companies completely close down and give their employees

1846
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Time off, it's the longest vacation

1847
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Period of the year for many Japanese jobs

1848
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
So, yeah

1849
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Wish we had that over here

1850
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
I know, I want Golden Week, how about Golden Arches Week

1851
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
We have FIFA World Cup

1852
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Soccer to look forward to when Golden Week's

1853
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Over, that's going to be a big release on the 13th

1854
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
It's because there's

1855
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven

1856
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Holidays during

1857
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
That period of time

1858
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Well, we get Cinco de Mayo over here

1859
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
We don't get it off, do we?

1860
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Yay

1861
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Really, I don't think Cinco de Mayo is really

1862
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Actually an American holiday anyway

1863
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
It's just one we kind of borrowed

1864
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
From our neighbors to have an excuse to drink

1865
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Mexican food potluck day

1866
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Exactly

1867
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
As if work needed another excuse to have a potluck

1868
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Alright

1869
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Let's move on

1870
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Okay, is there any holidays in the UK

1871
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Stopping video games this week?

1872
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Uh, no. I don't think so

1873
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Why don't they celebrate Cinco de Mayo?

1874
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Runaway 3

1875
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
For DS

1876
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Runaway A Twisted Fate for PC

1877
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
On the 7th, by the way

1878
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Sin and Punishment 2 for Wii

1879
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
And What Did I Do to Deserve This, My Lord?

1880
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Dude, that's awesome that they're getting Sin and Punishment 2

1881
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Seeing as ours has been delayed

1882
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Yeah

1883
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
On PSP and that's really it

1884
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Alright

1885
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
A few more gaming stories for you guys

1886
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
And then the classic game of the week

1887
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Where Dark Soccer is gonna dig through the vaults

1888
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
And believe me, kids, she's diggin' this week

1889
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Loki

1890
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
You may remember that Microsoft

1891
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Sue Datel over their unofficial

1892
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Max memory

1893
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Memory cards that they had out

1894
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Because they took

1895
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Little micro SD cards and allowed you to use them

1896
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
On the

1897
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Xbox 360

1898
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Which now that I think of it, it's kind of funny

1899
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Because, um

1900
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
They actually

1901
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Now that they've opened that up

1902
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
You don't really need these memory cards

1903
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Talk about, uh

1904
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Sucking

1905
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Anyways, so

1906
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
To kind of respond to

1907
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Datel's request

1908
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
They filed an antitrust

1909
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Lawsuit against Microsoft

1910
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Pissed off that they weren't

1911
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Kind of playing on even

1912
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Playing ground here

1913
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
And, um

1914
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Yeah, I kind of remember this whole

1915
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Back and forth from a couple weeks ago, yeah

1916
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Yeah, they're basically saying, um

1917
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
That the

1918
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Claims that by

1919
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Datel

1920
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
That they locked them out with a firmware update

1921
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
And Microsoft has used its

1922
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Status as a platform holder to

1923
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Unlawfully prevent competition

1924
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Which, I can see that

1925
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Because there's a lot of

1926
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
You know, um

1927
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
A lot of first party, you know, products out there

1928
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
But there's a lot of stuff that, you know, you have to get

1929
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Approval from Microsoft to build the release

1930
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Items for those systems

1931
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
And I think that pretty much goes with any other system

1932
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
But, seeing as the Wii

1933
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
And, um, the

1934
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
PlayStation 3 used kind of open

1935
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Storage formats, you know

1936
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
The SD memory cards and USB

1937
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Memory sticks and stuff like that

1938
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Now Microsoft, um

1939
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
You can see how that would be a problem

1940
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Since they were

1941
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Prior to the last firmware update

1942
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Only allowed to use

1943
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Either the hard drive or a

1944
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
A memory stick

1945
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Memory unit from Microsoft

1946
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
They're saying

1947
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Microsoft's motion to dismiss

1948
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Because they tried to dismiss it, it claimed that

1949
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
The language in the additional terms and conditions

1950
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Clause of the Xbox 360

1951
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Product warranty, because everybody reads

1952
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
That, um, barred the

1953
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Use of unauthorized peripherals

1954
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
And the company, uh

1955
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Backed up its case by citing

1956
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Apple's, I guess, successful defense

1957
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Of its right to limit the use of

1958
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
OS X to its own hardware

1959
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
And the court rejected

1960
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Microsoft's motion to have

1961
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
It dismissed, so it will

1962
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Apparently go to trial

1963
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Although, at this point

1964
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
It's like, well

1965
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
That's great and all, but

1966
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
In the meantime, I'll just pop

1967
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
In my USB memory stick

1968
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
To, uh, save my games now

1969
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
So that's gonna be kinda hard

1970
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
To, uh, make the case

1971
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Now

1972
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Hmm

1973
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Well, I mean

1974
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Do you think there are, this is gonna be

1975
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
One of those cases that gets dragged out

1976
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
For years and years, or is it gonna get settled pretty

1977
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Quickly? What do you think?

1978
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Put on your legal expert

1979
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Hat

1980
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
I think it probably gets

1981
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Probably gets settled, because

1982
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
You know, really, yeah, it sucks that they

1983
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Made these devices, and

1984
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
They got pulled from the market really

1985
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Quick. My thing is, though

1986
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Uh

1987
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
It's gonna be difficult

1988
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Now to show any damages

1989
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Because

1990
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
They weren't out that long, and

1991
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Now there are other options

1992
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Other than the memory units. In fact, they're not even

1993
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Making the memory units anymore

1994
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Um

1995
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
So

1996
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I don't know, it's

1997
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
It's hard, like, if they were

1998
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Yeah, they're not making them, because

1999
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Yeah, well they're not making them now, but if

2000
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
If they were, like, to say, completely ignore

2001
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
The time when they had just the memory units

2002
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Now that argument doesn't really hold

2003
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Um, but of course, you know

2004
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
This took place before that update

2005
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
But it almost makes you wonder if that update was

2006
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Partially in response to this

2007
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
But, who knows

2008
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
It just sucks for them, but

2009
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
That's an interesting thought, because it did seem like that USB

2010
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Thing came out of nowhere, didn't it? I think they were

2011
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Worried that there was gonna be

2012
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Some sort of, uh, because

2013
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
With this, you'll be able to

2014
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Access your files on your memory

2015
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Cards or whatever

2016
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
And you might be able to cheat or something

2017
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Like, you know, edit your save games or something

2018
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Which, I can tell you right now, that wouldn't have

2019
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Stopped them, because it's very

2020
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Easy to do that if you have the right tools

2021
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Even easier now that they have USB support

2022
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
It's like

2023
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
A program in hex editing

2024
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Alright, we're gonna go ahead and move on

2025
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
We got one more story for you guys

2026
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Before we get to the classic game of the week

2027
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
And that story has to do with something

2028
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
We sort of talked about last week

2029
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Don't know if you heard, but apparently

2030
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
A leaked GameStop ad

2031
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Has revealed that a black Wii bundle

2032
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Is on its way

2033
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Who would have thought? I had never

2034
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Heard about this

2035
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Yes, this black Wii will contain a Wiimote

2036
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
And MotionPlus, and Wii Sports, Wii Sports

2037
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Resorts, all for $200

2038
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
However, it's supposed to be coming out

2039
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
May 4th, which differs from an earlier

2040
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Report, but the interesting thing is that

2041
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I'm sorry, the

2042
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Ad is not supposed to go up until May 4th

2043
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
But it got leaked, the debut of this system

2044
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I'm sorry, is May 9th

2045
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Which differs from the earlier report

2046
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Canada's supposed to get it on May 23rd

2047
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Which is interesting because May 23rd is the

2048
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Date that had originally been reported

2049
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
And my source was not Canadian, thank you very much

2050
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
So don't know what happened there

2051
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
But could also be that

2052
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
More is to come because Nintendo

2053
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Has yet to make any official announcement

2054
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
You have to keep in mind, all of this is

2055
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Still rumor, it's just that now instead of

2056
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Some schmo on an internet radio show saying something

2057
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Now there's a picture to prove it

2058
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
It's coming, whereas everybody outside of the

2059
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
US is rolling their eyes and saying move on

2060
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
With it, we already have the black Wii here

2061
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Well, it's news here

2062
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Anyhow, Nintendo is

2063
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Pissed

2064
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
They commented actually on what's

2065
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Going on here, well no, they didn't comment

2066
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
They made threats which caused

2067
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
GameStop to comment

2068
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Here's an email

2069
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I love this because this whole email

2070
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Is about stop leaking stuff

2071
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
And then the email gets leaked

2072
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
That's my favorite, so here it is, here's the email

2073
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Let me read the email that went out to all the stores

2074
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
As you know

2075
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
There is a lot of rumor and speculation about various

2076
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
New products and titles launching this year

2077
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
One of these is the black Wii

2078
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Various blogs and internet sites

2079
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Are raising awareness about this product

2080
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
GameStop stores and associates should not

2081
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Proliferate these rumors

2082
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Today you received pop, I guess that's what

2083
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
POP, what is that?

2084
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Point of purchase advertising

2085
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Whatever

2086
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
For your windows regarding the black Wii

2087
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Somehow a picture of this appeared on the internet

2088
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Somebody snapped it with her camera phone

2089
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
It's not that hard to figure out

2090
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
It may seem cool to be in the know

2091
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
And feel compelled to share something like this

2092
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Nothing can be further from the truth

2093
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
All activity like this does is hurt our reputation

2094
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
With publishers and manufacturers

2095
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
And potentially hurts our company

2096
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Until Nintendo decides to announce their product

2097
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
There was capitalized, that's why I shouted it

2098
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
There should be no discussion of it with customers

2099
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Period

2100
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
If they ask, it's not appropriate to comment on

2101
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Speculation and rumor should be the answer

2102
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
That's dumb

2103
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
So in other words you should just confirm it

2104
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Just say I don't know

2105
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Here's an excuse that people will believe

2106
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I work at a game store, I don't know

2107
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Don't believe that

2108
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Anyway, the POP should be secured

2109
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
In the back room and left there until further notice

2110
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Any violation of these will be treated

2111
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
With the most aggressive consequences

2112
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I believe strongly in the field organization

2113
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
But I am as disappointed as I have been

2114
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
In my tenure here and how we are handling this

2115
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I am trusting that your professionalism

2116
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Will result in no further issues

2117
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
I got two words for you, BITCH

2118
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
PLEASE

2119
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Well here's the funny thing about it

2120
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
If you didn't want news

2121
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
On this to get out until May 4th

2122
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Then maybe you should have sent out the materials

2123
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
I don't know, May 2nd?

2124
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I mean come on, if you're gonna pay these guys

2125
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Next to nothing

2126
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
And let's face it, these employees at GameStop

2127
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Don't make enough money to shut up

2128
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Right?

2129
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
I mean

2130
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
You shouldn't be telling the whole world

2131
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
That the Black Week is coming out if you don't want people to say

2132
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
And I love how they put, oh it hurts

2133
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Our relationship with Nintendo

2134
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Yeah I'm sure Nintendo's gonna go

2135
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Oh we're not gonna ship product to our largest

2136
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Partner

2137
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Actually Loki, they did make that threat

2138
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Apparently that is the rumor going around

2139
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Nintendo did make the threat to pull all of its

2140
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Products from GameStop stories

2141
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
You know what I have to say to Nintendo over that?

2142
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
BITCH PLEASE

2143
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
It would never happen

2144
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Never happen

2145
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
What other game stores are there?

2146
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
I mean

2147
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
I mean

2148
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
You're gonna just rely on Walmart

2149
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
And Target and all that for your sales

2150
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I mean come on

2151
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
That is an empty threat

2152
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
If I've ever heard one

2153
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Maybe they'll send us a decent quantity of product then

2154
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Cause we service all the independent guys

2155
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
And they seem to fuck us over all the time

2156
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
I would love to see

2157
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
The big gorilla in the corner

2158
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
GameStop get fucked over once

2159
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Or twice

2160
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Yeah you're kinda sitting there going

2161
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Leak more, leak more, hee hee hee

2162
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
It's not gonna do anything

2163
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
GameStops leak information all the time

2164
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Not only do you leak information all the time

2165
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
I'm sure that they're the source

2166
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Of a lot of the leaked games

2167
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
That appear on the internet as well

2168
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
So

2169
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Oh well

2170
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Things get leaked

2171
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Trust no one

2172
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
God look at the music industry

2173
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I mean stuff

2174
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
I mean CDs get leaked

2175
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Weeks before their release date on the internet

2176
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
And you know what they say about

2177
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
When something hits the internet, it's done

2178
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Everybody's got it now

2179
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Once it's been put on the internet

2180
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
It is not coming off

2181
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Period

2182
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Anyhow

2183
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
So yeah the black Wii is coming, big surprise

2184
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Five minutes of fame and an eternity on the internet

2185
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Well here's the thing, the only reason why

2186
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
They probably didn't want it leaked

2187
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
For the stupid reason anyways is

2188
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
That's gonna hurt the sales of the Wii right now

2189
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Because people are like why the fuck am I gonna

2190
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Pay $1.99 for the Wii

2191
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
When I can get the Wii with Wii Sports Resort

2192
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
You know for the same price

2193
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
But, but, but, but, but retailers

2194
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Are already doing that

2195
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
We had a story a couple weeks ago about Walmart

2196
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Was already selling this as a bundle and I believe

2197
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Yeah they already have it

2198
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
What's Nintendo's problem?

2199
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Bitch please

2200
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
I don't know

2201
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
All I can say is

2202
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
That my Wii's been gathering dust for

2203
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Five months

2204
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
I would love to see that meeting

2205
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Where somebody at GameStop says that to Reggie

2206
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Fils-Aime's face, bitch please

2207
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
I still wanna borrow your Wii Fit

2208
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Maybe I wanna use it

2209
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
If you're not using it

2210
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Yeah sure

2211
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Okay thank you

2212
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Anyhow let's move on

2213
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Spyro in chat says wait it's already here

2214
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Yeah that's my other thing is that like

2215
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
In all the rest of the world

2216
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Like the UK and what doesn't even Canada

2217
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Have the Black Wii at this no no

2218
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Cause it's supposed to come out May 23rd

2219
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Pretty much everywhere but the US and Canada

2220
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Has already had the Black Wii

2221
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
They'll announce it like tomorrow okay

2222
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
I mean they're gonna make the announcement soon

2223
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
It's retarded that they're not

2224
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Maybe on the 4th I don't know why they wait till Tuesday

2225
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
But it's just gonna be an announcement

2226
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
And whoopty shit

2227
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Okay seriously

2228
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Really a color change that's really

2229
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Gonna get people to buy the Wii

2230
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
That didn't before I would buy it

2231
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
But if only it were black

2232
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Going to comments from our chat room

2233
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com

2234
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
ActDeaf says to Nintendo, you mad?

2235
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Rama says

2236
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Is that sky getting sassy?

2237
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Mhmm

2238
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Frisbee says Nintendo

2239
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
And Tigerclaw says

2240
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
A Black Wii would be nice but it's not gonna

2241
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Hide all the dust it will collect turning it into a

2242
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
White Wii ha should be more of like a

2243
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Grayish Wii but I get your point that's true

2244
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
It's gonna be like the PS3's

2245
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Little dust magnets

2246
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Good times good times

2247
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Hey it's that part of the show where we're going

2248
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
To speaking of dusty things we're gonna jump

2249
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Into Dark Sakura's vault

2250
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
And pull out a video game

2251
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
It's a classic

2252
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
It's time to bring a game up from the

2253
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Vault of History and deem it as a

2254
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
True classic that you kids need

2255
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
To respect and adore and play some of

2256
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
This week it's Dark Sakura's classic

2257
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Game of the week

2258
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Dark Sakura what game did you pick for us this week?

2259
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
I picked a sequel

2260
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Rob

2261
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
I picked Dodonpachi

2262
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Dodonpachi can't say I've

2263
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Heard of this game let's check it out what's Dodonpachi

2264
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
You haven't heard of Dodonpachi?

2265
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
I don't think so

2266
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
We're like one of the classic cave shooters

2267
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
As in the company that gave us

2268
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Es-ba-ba-ba-ba-luga whale

2269
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
I'm sorry Es-ba-galuda

2270
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
But I didn't play all of their games

2271
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Was this released in the US?

2272
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
What system was this on?

2273
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
I played Dodonpachi in the arcade

2274
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
It was

2275
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Published by Atlas

2276
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
But yeah

2277
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
For systems it came out on

2278
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Let's see

2279
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
I'm trying to remember

2280
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
I think there was

2281
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Wasn't there

2282
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I don't remember if it was arcade only

2283
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
It couldn't have been arcade only

2284
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Because I know that this

2285
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
And I think that

2286
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Dodonpachi

2287
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Came out in the arcade

2288
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Only

2289
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Because I really don't remember

2290
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Playing this at home I've just had

2291
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Main ROMs

2292
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
It was also on the Saturn

2293
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
And the original Playstation

2294
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Now that I think about it

2295
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I think it's the Saturn version

2296
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
I've never heard the easy web

2297
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
I don't know what that is

2298
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Anyway

2299
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
The original Dodonpachi

2300
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Was sort of like an 8 year training mission

2301
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Where you shoot all your friends to death

2302
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
And then

2303
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
There's another twist in this one

2304
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
But I'm not going to really get much into it

2305
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
But you have different fighters

2306
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
You have your type A

2307
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Which is a narrow stream of shots

2308
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
You have B

2309
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Which is a helicopter that has

2310
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Guns forward and side guns

2311
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
And then type C

2312
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
You've got different guns

2313
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Lasers, bombs, all kinds of different stuff

2314
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Different power ups

2315
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
You get shot mode and laser mode

2316
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Different collectible items where you can get

2317
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Power to increase your

2318
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Guns and lasers

2319
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Bombs where you get more bombs

2320
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
MP

2321
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Appears when you've lost all your lives

2322
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
So when you continue you can pick that up

2323
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
And you start back at full strength

2324
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Which is also in Espegaluda

2325
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
And in

2326
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Another game

2327
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
That's supposed to be even harder

2328
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Than that

2329
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I set a link aside

2330
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
To get the name of it

2331
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
You also

2332
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Now this is something else that

2333
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Totally incorporated into

2334
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Espegaluda

2335
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Later on is that you can get

2336
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Stars

2337
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
For

2338
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Killing

2339
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
A boss

2340
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
An end boss

2341
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
And their bullets are converted into stars

2342
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
And you get 100 points

2343
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
And then you get a giant star when you get 10,000 points

2344
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
For a multi-part boss

2345
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
And then

2346
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
A pentagon

2347
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
That gives you 300 points

2348
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
But you only find them on the ground

2349
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
And by the way the other game

2350
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
That I am thinking of

2351
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Is

2352
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Mushihime Sama

2353
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Which is

2354
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Like bullet hell

2355
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Just watch the last boss

2356
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
For that if you want your brain to explode

2357
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
It's really freaking difficult

2358
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
But I like my brain

2359
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
You've also got a maximum

2360
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Mode in this

2361
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Where if you

2362
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Trigger a bomb when all of your bomb slots

2363
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Are full and then your

2364
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Score increases

2365
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
By 220 points

2366
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Per 1 60th of a second

2367
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Yeah

2368
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
And so you start off with a 2 multiplier

2369
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
And you increase by 1 for every successive

2370
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Bomb collected in maximum mode

2371
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
So it's pretty crazy

2372
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
And you also have a get point system

2373
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Where you have a combo gauge

2374
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
And you get

2375
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Increased number of points

2376
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
From enemies larger hit counts

2377
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
It's pretty complex

2378
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
It's got other stuff so you've got different

2379
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Areas in the game

2380
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
But area 7

2381
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
You can only get to

2382
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
By entering the second loop

2383
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Which is done by

2384
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Completing the first 6 areas on

2385
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
1 credit

2386
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
And doing any of these

2387
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Following requirements where you lose

2388
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
2 lives

2389
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Or depending on which one you lose

2390
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
For type A you have to have a maximum

2391
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Hit count of 270 hits

2392
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Type B 300 and type C 330

2393
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Or score at least 50 million points

2394
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
At the end of area 6

2395
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Or collect all 13 B's

2396
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
For 4 of the 6 areas

2397
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
And the second loop has

2398
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
The same areas

2399
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Same bosses

2400
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
But you have many many many more bullets

2401
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
And giant mechanical B's

2402
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Different

2403
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
And then you get the actual

2404
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Real boss of the game

2405
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
You've got different bonuses

2406
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
So you get stuff for

2407
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Pentagon's getting the stars

2408
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Boss hits

2409
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
No miss

2410
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
In the second loop you get

2411
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
10 million points for each

2412
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Reserve fighter

2413
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
So you've got different endings too

2414
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
If you don't get the

2415
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Second loop access

2416
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
You're congratulated by the DonPachi Corps

2417
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
For being brave

2418
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
If you get everything

2419
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
The mechanized aliens

2420
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Are your own comrades

2421
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Although

2422
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
The

2423
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
International release says it's a lost fleet

2424
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
But

2425
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
They're actually trying to stop

2426
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
You

2427
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
So

2428
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Once everything is done

2429
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
They're all ordered

2430
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
To kill you

2431
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
And that's when you start the second loop

2432
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
So going through it again

2433
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
The whole point of DonPachi

2434
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Is to annihilate all the human

2435
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Beings in the world

2436
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Awesome

2437
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Pretty pretty crazy huh?

2438
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Yeah I'm looking at the screens of this

2439
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
It's definitely bullet hell

2440
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
God there's so many of these games

2441
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
That's not even bad Rob

2442
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
That is not even bad

2443
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
It just goes to show I suck at these games

2444
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Because I would fail at this so miserably

2445
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
I've been bouncing from YouTube to YouTube

2446
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
This is like stage 2-3 I think

2447
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
And yeah I would not beat this

2448
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Rob you need to find

2449
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
The final boss

2450
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
I believe SSJ100Matt actually linked that

2451
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
In our chat room

2452
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
It's very resourceful

2453
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Here it is the hardest video game boss ever

2454
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Let me fast forward a little bit here

2455
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
This is nuts you don't need to fast forward all that much

2456
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
It starts off hard

2457
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Isn't that gorgeous?

2458
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
This is ridiculous

2459
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
This is just retarded stupid

2460
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
There's a video up of a person

2461
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
No missing on it not getting hit

2462
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
And keep in mind

2463
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
The final boss in Escaluda on iPhone

2464
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Releases

2465
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Not quite as many bullets

2466
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
The way these games work you can only get hit

2467
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
In that little glowing spot right there

2468
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
That's it

2469
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
That's bullet hell

2470
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Ridiculous

2471
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
And I like that it talks to you the whole time

2472
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Just like it does in Escaluda

2473
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Sorry

2474
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
But yeah

2475
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Cave is evil

2476
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
For throwing bullets up our noses

2477
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
So yeah there was

2478
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
A special version

2479
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
The campaign version or DDP Blue Rom

2480
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
That has

2481
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
A very limited print

2482
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Of the game that was given to winners

2483
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
At a Dodonpachi contest

2484
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
That Cave had

2485
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
It has

2486
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
The same game it's harder and has a hyper mode

2487
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
In it which

2488
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Actually shows up later in Dodonpachi

2489
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Dialjo

2490
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
A blue title screen

2491
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Very very hard to get

2492
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
And actually

2493
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
One

2494
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
There's actually two

2495
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
That have confirmed to exist

2496
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
That one of them belongs to

2497
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
The

2498
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Current world holder for Dodonpachi

2499
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
So

2500
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
But yeah

2501
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
There were of course

2502
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
The other versions too

2503
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Like the Saturn and

2504
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
PlayStation

2505
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
I was trying to remember if it was Dodonpachi or Dodonpachi

2506
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
And that game

2507
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
I've only ever really played it in the arcade

2508
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Although I think I have it on Saturn

2509
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
In one of my collections somewhere

2510
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
But yeah, pretty crazy

2511
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
And for the record

2512
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
You want to play 2D games on the Saturn

2513
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
They look better

2514
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Alright, there it is your classic video game of the week

2515
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Dodonpachi

2516
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Going to comments from our chat room

2517
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Shao Ran says

2518
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Bullet hell is all about patterns

2519
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Beauty, thought, and bullet hell

2520
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
As there are no things superior to beauty and thought

2521
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Kevin DDR says

2522
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Sky 2-3 means

2523
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
It's the second loop

2524
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
You have to beat the game with certain conditions to even get to that

2525
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Well, that ain't happening

2526
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
I'll tell you that

2527
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
And then Shao Ran follows up and says

2528
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Yeah, once you get grazing down, bullet hell games aren't that hard

2529
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
It's just about memorization

2530
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Just like any other old Japanese game

2531
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Frisbee says

2532
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Bullet hell is almost like a maze game

2533
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
I guess I can see that

2534
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Just interesting

2535
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Alright, I'm just not very good at those games

2536
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Like, the last bullet hell game I played

2537
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Was the You Will Die

2538
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Which was by one of the other all games hosts

2539
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Making his own game on XNA

2540
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
And I suck at it

2541
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Alright

2542
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Let's go do our break

2543
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
We're going to take a quick break, we'll be right back

2544
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
There's plenty more to come tonight

2545
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Listless, speaking of friends on all games

2546
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
One of our podcasting buddies is going to join us

2547
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
For Listless later

2548
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
There was huge news out of Bungie this week

2549
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
We're going to talk about that in the next segment

2550
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Final Fantasy 5 and Final Fantasy 6 remakes

2551
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Possibly, maybe

2552
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
We'll see after a quick break

2553
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
So stay tuned, don't go anywhere

2554
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

2555
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Hello everybody and welcome back to another episode

2556
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

2557
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
It's part B of our show

2558
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Already in progress

2559
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
On May 2nd of 2010

2560
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
We have plenty more gaming news

2561
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
To get to this hour

2562
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
And Listless tonight

2563
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
And I'll tell you the topic right now

2564
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
What we're going to be doing tonight

2565
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
What Capcom versus series should they do next

2566
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Or maybe I should actually say

2567
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Versus Capcom would be correct

2568
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Because you know, you've had Tatsunoko versus Capcom

2569
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Marvel versus Capcom

2570
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
What should they do next

2571
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
We're going to find out with the definitive list

2572
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
In a few more minutes here at Orange Lounge Radio

2573
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
But first we have some rapid quick

2574
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
News, there's so much to talk about this week

2575
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
We don't have time to talk about everything

2576
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
But we can at least give some shout outs

2577
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
To some other gaming news highlights this week

2578
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
And as somebody in chat points out

2579
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
I should say this real quick

2580
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
ActDeaf says it's episode live 365

2581
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Because this is episode 365 of our show

2582
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Do not speak that name ever again

2583
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Just kidding

2584
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Remember we went to the live 365 awards

2585
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Good times, good times

2586
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
We went twice

2587
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
What? Hey what?

2588
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
That's what I did during the live 365 awards

2589
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Oh yeah, when they, oh god

2590
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
How could I forget when they forgot our name

2591
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
When they were going over, yeah we got nominated

2592
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
One year for live 365 station

2593
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Of the year, like that's a pretty big honor

2594
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Because there was what, like 11,000 stations on live 365

2595
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
We were one of the five nominated

2596
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
For station of the year, and when what's-her-name

2597
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Betty whatever was reading the

2598
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Nominees, she forgot OLR

2599
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
And you just hear, and god

2600
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
I wish I could find that recording, I think it's long

2601
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Gone in the recycle bin or whatever

2602
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
But somebody actually had a recording

2603
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Because they played the award show live

2604
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
And a bunch of our listeners were listening

2605
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
And you could hear Loki in the background

2606
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
She goes, we have all, or she goes

2607
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
And the nominees are

2608
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Rockland, da da da, and whatever stations

2609
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
And she goes, and the winner is, and you hear in the background

2610
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Hey!

2611
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
No, it was funny, it was

2612
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Most unlikely to be on radio or something

2613
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Like that, and they had like an 80's station

2614
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Because you don't ever hear 80's

2615
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Stations on the radio

2616
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Ever. That's where we lost to the station that plays

2617
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Nothing but porn music all day long

2618
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Got nominated three

2619
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Years in a row for those fuckers, never won

2620
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
One, oh well, thanks for trying

2621
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I got speakers. That's right, you won some type of like

2622
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Playing bingo. Bingo thing or something stupid

2623
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Alright, so yeah

2624
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
That was good times, so

2625
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
I really wish I had a recording of that

2626
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
With Loki in the background, hey!

2627
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
And then she goes, oh, oh yeah, yeah, and on orange

2628
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Orange, orange, orange, and we just gave each other

2629
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
That look of, well, we didn't win

2630
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
I'm outta here

2631
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Drove all this way for this

2632
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
And then they drove up their fees

2633
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
By like 300% and we

2634
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Got the fuck out, and now we're here at All Games

2635
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
You know what, it worked out for the better, because coming over to

2636
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
All Games, I think got us new listeners

2637
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Because, you know, we had

2638
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Kind of a cultish audience

2639
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
And Scott Rubin and Bobby Blackwolf

2640
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
And all the people at All Games had a bit of a cultish

2641
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Audience, so when we married these

2642
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Cults together, it was a good thing

2643
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
It was a super cult

2644
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Yes, it was a super cult, uber cult

2645
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
So thanks to all you little cultists

2646
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
For sticking with us

2647
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Over the years, alright, back to some gaming news

2648
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Loki

2649
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Yes, so real quick, if you wanna be

2650
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Iron Man on Playstation

2651
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Home, it'll be a lot easier than having to

2652
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Steal a suit from Stark Enterprises

2653
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Yes, you can actually play, they have a little

2654
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Game where you can fly around

2655
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
As Iron Man

2656
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
And apparently it

2657
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Debuted earlier last week

2658
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
On Thursday

2659
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Apparently

2660
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
It was part of the Out

2661
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
I'm surprised that they actually have

2662
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
A space, but

2663
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Audi, I guess, has a space there

2664
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
And they're teaming up with Paramount for that

2665
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
No actual Iron Man themed space

2666
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I mean, it sort of is, but it's part of

2667
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Audi's

2668
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
And then I guess, oh

2669
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
That's funny

2670
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Unfortunately though, it is exclusive to the

2671
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
European Playstation Network, so

2672
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
That sucks for most of

2673
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Our listeners

2674
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
This is kind of cool

2675
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Someone made a Flash game

2676
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
That kind of crosses a bunch of

2677
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Different 8-bit game

2678
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Heroes with Super Mario Brothers

2679
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
And it's called Super Mario Crossover

2680
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
And it features such

2681
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Playable characters as, of course you can play as Mario

2682
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Why would you want to

2683
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Link, Mega Man, Samus,

2684
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Simon Belmont, and Bill from

2685
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Contra

2686
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
And that is awesome

2687
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
And I'll be playing that later instead of the

2688
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Unicorn game

2689
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
And then finally, APB

2690
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Has been slated to be coming out now

2691
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
On June 29th

2692
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
And they also kind of talked a little bit about

2693
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
How their pricing structure is going to go

2694
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
As well, it's really cool

2695
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
I like the way that they're doing it, I mean

2696
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
I think it's going to be pretty sweet

2697
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Instead of paying a monthly fee

2698
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
As you would with most MMOs, you pay for time

2699
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
So for example, when you buy the game

2700
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
You get 50 hours

2701
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
And how you use that

2702
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Is up to you, if you play a lot

2703
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Great, if you don't play a lot

2704
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
No big deal

2705
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
And once those are up, you have the option to purchase

2706
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
20 more hours for $7

2707
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Or you can do 30 days of unlimited access

2708
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
For $10, or

2709
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
90 days, or 180 day passes

2710
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
As well, and they haven't given the prices on those

2711
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
In addition to extra playtime

2712
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Oh, in addition, extra playtime

2713
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Can be earned through different accomplishments

2714
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
In the game

2715
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
So that's pretty awesome, and I have to say

2716
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
You know, I don't really hop on the

2717
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
MMO bandwagon

2718
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Because I don't have time to play games, but

2719
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
If it's as a pain as I go

2720
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
I'm interested

2721
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Definitely, especially since the game looks like

2722
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Grand Theft Auto, so

2723
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I'm all over that, and it's

2724
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
And it's real time worlds, man

2725
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
It's a crackdown, and I really am sad that they didn't

2726
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Do the second crackdown

2727
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Thank god, WoW doesn't charge by the hour

2728
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
I'd be in debt

2729
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Well, I mean, they do have that option

2730
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Though, where you can buy unlimited access

2731
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
For 30 days for $10

2732
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Which is still cheaper than WoW

2733
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
So, it's not bad

2734
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Alright, well, here's a game that I think

2735
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Loki might be interested in, I think Dark Soccer

2736
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
I don't know why, this seems like a Dark Soccer kind of game, too

2737
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
THQ and Syfy

2738
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
The TV network are getting together to make

2739
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
A new game

2740
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Sadly, it's not a Caprica game, but what it is

2741
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
It's a Ghost Hunters Academy game

2742
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Here's the problem I have with that

2743
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
It's Ghost Hunters Academy, and they've done so many spinoffs

2744
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Of the Ghost Hunters show

2745
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
It's retarded now

2746
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
And they've become, they've sold out

2747
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Okay, they've sold out

2748
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
And then jumped the shark

2749
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Bought a shark to jump over, I guess

2750
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Well, if you want to jump the shark with them

2751
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Ghost Hunters Academy is coming out for the iPhone and iPad, of course

2752
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
And the DS

2753
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Is the game you get to try out

2754
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
To be on the team

2755
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
If you want to be a ghost hunter

2756
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Who wants to be a ghost hunter?

2757
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
That's what the game's about

2758
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Just saying

2759
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
By the way, no details about actual gameplay

2760
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Hopefully it plays like Ghostbusters

2761
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
The old school game that was on

2762
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Commodore and NES

2763
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Don't cross the streams, Marshmallow Man, etc

2764
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Also, apparently

2765
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
There's stuff afoot in the Mega Man universe

2766
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
No surprise there

2767
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Mega Man's been having a little bit of a renaissance

2768
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Thanks to Mega Man 9 and Mega Man 10

2769
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Apparently there is a Mega Man universe

2770
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
We talked about this before

2771
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
But now we might know what this is actually connected to

2772
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Apparently

2773
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
There was a little tease dropped in another podcast

2774
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Called Bit Transmission

2775
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
And Seth Killen

2776
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Was the guest from Capcom

2777
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
He said that Mega Man still has some surprises in store

2778
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
For everybody

2779
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Quote, it's good, I don't want to say nobody has seen it coming

2780
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Somebody may have seen it coming

2781
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
But it excited me and when I heard about the project

2782
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
I was like, holy crap, that's rad

2783
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
I actually haven't seen anything that's going on with the project right now

2784
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
But the idea was exciting

2785
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
This is still kicking around as a concept

2786
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
But there are exciting ideas in the Mega Man space

2787
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
It's a six player co-op

2788
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Xbox Live

2789
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
2D game

2790
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
And this week they're gonna be like

2791
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Shit, someone beat us to it

2792
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Damn it

2793
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
MU Konami

2794
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
We all know it would be Konami copying them

2795
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Oh, I went there

2796
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Hey look, no seriously, think about it

2797
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I don't want to say nobody has seen it coming

2798
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
So here's my thought

2799
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
And especially if the game is called Mega Man Universe

2800
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Is this finally

2801
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
That game

2802
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Oh yes, that Mega Man game

2803
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
With all

2804
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Of the robot bosses in it

2805
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
At once

2806
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
That'd be awesome

2807
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
That would be so fucking awesome

2808
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:58,000
That's more awesome than I think I can handle

2809
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
I might just explode

2810
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
We'll see

2811
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Meanwhile, this is also awesome and I didn't realize that

2812
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
By the way, Dark Tetsuya

2813
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Oh, thanks to the lag

2814
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
I just beat him to it

2815
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
But he just said in chat

2816
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
I'm calling it now, Mega Man Battle Royale

2817
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
With all the bosses

2818
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
I called it 30 seconds ago

2819
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Anyway, speaking of games

2820
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
That sound really awesome

2821
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
I'm going to pass out from how awesome it is

2822
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
ModNation Racers is on its way out

2823
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
I never did play the beta, so I don't know if it's actually that good

2824
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
I got in the beta and never played it

2825
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
You dumbass

2826
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
I would have played it, I didn't get in the beta

2827
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
I didn't try hard enough

2828
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
I didn't realize the beta was coming out so soon

2829
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
It's coming out at the end of May

2830
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
There was a commercial for it on TV the other day

2831
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
I'm seeing more and more Playstation commercials on TV

2832
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
What's up with that?

2833
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Of course I've been watching more South Park

2834
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Maybe it's related, I don't know

2835
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Anyhow, in ModNation Racers

2836
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
You will be able to play as Sackboy

2837
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Will be one of the racers in ModNation Racers

2838
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
And if this surprises you

2839
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
I don't know what rock you've been living under

2840
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Because this series has been getting all of these

2841
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Transplants from other Sony franchises

2842
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
So this is kind of a duh

2843
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
We don't know if it's part of a pre-order bonus or what

2844
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
But probably it is

2845
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
So there you go, there's a little teaser out there featuring Sackboy

2846
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
And all that fun stuff

2847
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Dark Soccer, what you got for us?

2848
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
I have some stuff, Rob

2849
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Which is as cool as every freaking Mega Man boss at once

2850
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Sims 3

2851
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Is coming to Playstation 3, Xbox 360

2852
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Wii, and DS this fall

2853
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
EA is working on console versions

2854
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
And should have different features

2855
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Like karma power

2856
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Depending on whether you can get lucky

2857
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Or have Epic fail

2858
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Yeah

2859
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Which actually still reminds me that I need to completely

2860
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Uninstall all my Sims 3 stuff

2861
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
What?

2862
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
I just spilled water all over myself

2863
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
You're a big boy, Rob

2864
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
I need a sippy cup

2865
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
I could go get you one

2866
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
He's getting wet over that news

2867
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Literally, I just got wet over the Mega Man news

2868
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
I'll be right back, I need a towel

2869
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Okay

2870
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
So also though, coming up for Rock Band

2871
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
We have new download content

2872
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
We have No Doubt Tragic Kingdom

2873
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
To download

2874
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Which are

2875
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Basically all

2876
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
We have the songs on there

2877
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Including different people

2878
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
And ended on this

2879
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Happy now see you then 16

2880
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
The climb tragic kingdom world go round

2881
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
And you can do it

2882
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
And then individual songs is

2883
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Orient the according to you and picture me broken

2884
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Dearest I'm so sorry

2885
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
And then

2886
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
We also have our UK

2887
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Download games

2888
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Just to mention what's coming out

2889
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
We have Hamster Ball

2890
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
For Playstation 3

2891
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Yeah, Hamster Ball

2892
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Which looks kind of Monkey Ball

2893
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Like to me

2894
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
And then

2895
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Alpha Bounce

2896
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
For DSiWare

2897
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
500 points

2898
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Which just looks like a glorified

2899
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Arcanoid to me

2900
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
The Will of Dr. Frankenstein

2901
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
For WiiWare

2902
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
And

2903
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
It looks very Nintendo 64-ish

2904
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
And

2905
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
It's actually a cut down version

2906
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Of the island of Dr. Frankenstein

2907
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
And then

2908
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
We've got a few others

2909
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
There's Earthworm Jim for DSiWare

2910
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
500 points

2911
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Um, which you know

2912
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Freaking Earthworm Jim, so hey

2913
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I loved Earthworm Jim, it was cute

2914
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
I loved how the titles, credits would burp

2915
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Sound like me earlier in the show tonight

2916
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
We have Lead and Gold Gangs of the Wild

2917
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
West, which is for Playstation Network

2918
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
And Steam

2919
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
That would do it

2920
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Alright, let's get into some Twitter topics

2921
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Every week we solicit your tweets

2922
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000

01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
And we like to pick some of our favorite tweets

2924
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
And read them here on the show

2925
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
So let's get into the tweets

2926
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
I gotta admit, they're not always on topic

2927
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
You guys, but uh

2928
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Whatever, we're flexible

2929
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Uh, let's see

2930
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Souture in Twitter

2931
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Says, uh, what I've been playing

2932
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Harvest Moon, hero of Leaf Valley

2933
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Fun, but frequent, those short

2934
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Loading screens. What do you think of Harvest Moon?

2935
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
I tried to get into that series

2936
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
On the GameCube, I think there was a game on the GameCube

2937
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
I couldn't really get into it, I don't know

2938
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Like, I was just more into Animal Crossing

2939
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
I wasn't, maybe it was too much

2940
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Fun with Cows!

2941
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Maybe it was too much micromanaging for me

2942
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
I think it's one of those games I really need to give another shot

2943
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Like, I don't think I gave it a fair shot, to be honest

2944
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Fun with Cows!

2945
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
No, you know, Jessica played it a whole bunch

2946
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
When I would hangover

2947
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
And I was just like, look, my cow loves me!

2948
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Okay

2949
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
You know, Harvest Moon kind of strikes me as like a Facebook game

2950
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Like, I'm kind of surprised it's not on Facebook

2951
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Uh, I'm surprised

2952
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Especially with the success of what, uh, Farmville

2953
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Farmville? Like, seriously

2954
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Why are they not suing over this?

2955
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
I don't know

2956
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Uh, let's see, more tweets

2957
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
TheShadowSniper tweets us

2958
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
OLR, you guys are awesome!

2959
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Do you agree?

2960
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
No. Most days

2961
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
I'm awesome every day, Rob

2962
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Uh, KnightsOfBlaze says

2963
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Here's Twitter topic for tonight

2964
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Blur or SplitSecond, which will be better?

2965
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
SplitSecond

2966
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Tough. I haven't played the SplitSecond demo yet

2967
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
SplitSecond looks awesome

2968
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Blur, I think, would be fun

2969
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Because people like playing online

2970
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
But I don't really give a crap about online

2971
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
So I'm all about SplitSecond

2972
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Plus, they have that new survival mode now

2973
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Which looks all sorts of awesome

2974
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
So, that'd be the first game I'm gonna play

2975
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
They may check out Blur later on

2976
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
But both of them to me win the I don't care rating

2977
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
They both look awesome to me

2978
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
But I'm gonna say Blur just because it's the one

2979
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Loki didn't pick

2980
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
So now it's officially a tie

2981
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
I'll let Dan get whatever he wants to and then I'll go

2982
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Oh, that's neat

2983
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
One for Blur, one for SplitSecond, one for I don't give a fuck

2984
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
I mean, you have like

2985
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
You have a game that looks like Burnout with explosions

2986
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Or you have, you know, Mario Kart meets

2987
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Project Gotham

2988
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
It's tough

2989
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Both games look good actually

2990
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
But we'll see, you know, a lot of it has to do with the controls too

2991
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Keep that in mind

2992
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
So we'll see how they control

2993
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Blur controls pretty good, I'll check out SplitSecond soon

2994
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
But I remember playing it at E3 last year and it was pretty cool

2995
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
I wonder if they'll have the same damn demo this year

2996
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Oh no, the game will be out by E3 this year

2997
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Game's out pretty soon

2998
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Tigerclaw sends us a couple stories

2999
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
I'll go ahead and read this one here

3000
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Because the other one I think Bobby got on his show

3001
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
So let's talk about this one here

3002
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Um

3003
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Oh, I love this

3004
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
This is so appropriate what Tigerclaw sent us

3005
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Apparently a couple of game testers

3006
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
At Activision as identified

3007
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
By one of the vending machines in the background

3008
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
They had a speed eating competition

3009
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Of the KFC Double Down

3010
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Polishing it off in

3011
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
57.97 seconds

3012
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
That's just under a minute

3013
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Apparently it was sent

3014
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
In some type of video over to Kotaku

3015
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Not yet verified by Twin Galaxies

3016
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
LOL, so there it is

3017
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
You can actually see the guys eating the Double Down

3018
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
And um

3019
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
These little bastards are skinny

3020
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
That's what I don't like, like if I ate that Double Down

3021
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
In 60 seconds, I would gain weight

3022
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
These little bastards are still skinny

3023
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
You guys can go to hell

3024
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Alright, uh

3025
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
I'm just jealous

3026
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Let's see, um

3027
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Sponstwang says, can anyone make me

3028
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Anything OLR slash gamer

3029
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Related I can wear on my 5K race

3030
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
In a couple of weeks

3031
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
I'm already going to wear a Pokewalker

3032
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
I don't know, Dark Soccer is the

3033
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Seamstress of the bunch

3034
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
I can

3035
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Make you a keychain

3036
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
I don't know if Misty

3037
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Is still in the business of making

3038
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
OLR keychains and stuff

3039
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
But you might want to try talking to Misty

3040
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Because I know she used to have some of that stuff

3041
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Like, you know, beaderies and necklaces

3042
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
And things like that

3043
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Yeah, I've been talking about that for years

3044
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Nothing yet, nothing yet, maybe soon

3045
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Uh, let's see

3046
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
DarkTetsuya wanted to give a big fat plug

3047
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
To his new series on our website

3048
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
I, uh, love this

3049
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
New series that he came up with

3050
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
I think it's a great addition to our website

3051
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
It's called A Look Back

3052
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
We kind of need to give it a better name though

3053
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
A Look Back, I mean, don't get me wrong

3054
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
The name suffices for what it is, it is a look back

3055
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
But we need something a little more hardcore

3056
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Than a look back

3057
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
You can look back, bitches

3058
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Maybe not

3059
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
But anyway, regardless of what it's called

3060
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
The system is really good

3061
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
It's A Look Back, the MSX is the first in the series

3062
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
And he talks about what the MSX was all about

3063
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Because, um, it's, uh

3064
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Cool because the MSX is a

3065
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Console we didn't get here

3066
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
And so you can read a little more about it

3067
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
So, that's kind of nice

3068
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
BlackWolf suggests rear view mirror

3069
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
I kind of like that

3070
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Let's see

3071
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
I said he's not totally, um

3072
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
I like that rose colored rear view mirror

3073
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Anyway, uh

3074
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Let's see, Blue Swim sends us

3075
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
A tweet saying

3076
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Rob, are you going to get behind the

3077
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Bieber ruined Twitter trending topic

3078
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Happy that people are revolting

3079
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
See, I'm just ahead of my time

3080
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Because I commented on that whole thing a couple weeks ago

3081
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
About how I don't want to use Twitter anymore

3082
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Because I really can't justify using a site

3083
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
That Justin Bieber is a trending topic

3084
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
On every single day

3085
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
I'm glad that people are finally revolting

3086
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Take back Twitter!

3087
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
From Justin Bieber and all his frickin' mouthy fans

3088
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
And, uh, there you have it

3089
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Those are Twitter topics for tonight

3090
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R

3091
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Or just ignore it

3092
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
I can't ignore it

3093
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Because you got the Bieber fear

3094
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
It's not in my nature

3095
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
S2100Matt says the look back idea

3096
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Was actually his idea

3097
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Oh, my bad

3098
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Sorry, Matt

3099
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
I hate the series

3100
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
It just, you know, needs a more hardcore name

3101
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
That's right

3102
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
A look back to the extreme

3103
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
A look back extreme mix

3104
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Alright

3105
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Anyhow, let's go on to a couple more stories here

3106
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Listless coming up in just a little bit

3107
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
With a special guest, Loki

3108
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
As I'm sure a lot of people thought

3109
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Maybe hell froze over earlier this week

3110
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
But, um

3111
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Bungie has entered in a ten year partnership

3112
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
With Activision

3113
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Um

3114
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Yeah, apparently they're gonna publish the next

3115
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Or all games based on, um, Bungie's

3116
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Next big action game universe

3117
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
And, um

3118
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
They're looking to publish on multiple

3119
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Platforms, so it's no longer gonna be, you know

3120
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Xbox exclusive anymore

3121
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
And, um

3122
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
It kinda makes you wonder

3123
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Bungie, have you not been reading the news?

3124
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
I mean, seriously?

3125
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Yeah, but there's a huge difference, Loki

3126
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
I think you made the mistake a lot of people are making

3127
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Activision did not buy

3128
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Bungie

3129
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Activision has a publishing deal with Bungie

3130
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Activision is basically getting free money out of this deal

3131
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
I mean, all they're doing, they're putting out

3132
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
You know, they'll do the marketing

3133
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
They do everything outside the actual development of the game

3134
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Alright

3135
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
That's what this agreement's all about

3136
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
I honestly don't think this is a big deal

3137
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
If Activision had bought Bungie, then yes

3138
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Oh my gosh, doom and gloom, Bungie, what are you smoking?

3139
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
You all are high

3140
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
But, it's just a publishing deal

3141
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
I mean, they had to sign with somebody

3142
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
They weren't gonna self-publish

3143
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
And what's funny is, uh

3144
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Bungie's Harold Ryan looks like

3145
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Brendan Fraser, he even has that

3146
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Really creepy smile

3147
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
I didn't realize Brendan Fraser had a creepy smile

3148
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Yeah, he's just creepy all around

3149
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Um, so yeah

3150
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
So they're gonna be publishing their next game

3151
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
They'll work out exactly what the next game is actually

3152
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Gonna be

3153
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
But that will probably be coming up at E3

3154
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Probably at E3, and then

3155
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
It's also probably gonna help with that void

3156
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Of people that

3157
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Hate on Activision right now, although

3158
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
I can't imagine it's gonna really affect their sales that much

3159
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Including the Call of Duty franchise

3160
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Cause people bitch, but people still buy

3161
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
It would be interesting to know about this agreement

3162
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
If the Final Cut

3163
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Arrangement is still with Bungie

3164
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
You know Final Cut, so to speak

3165
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Or if Activision gets to make changes to games they want to publish

3166
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
I doubt that's in the agreement

3167
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Kinda Bungie, I imagine, got to do whatever the hell

3168
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
They wanted with this

3169
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
So I don't think this is gonna be bad news at all

3170
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
I really don't

3171
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
You know, and I've been as critical of Activision as the next guy

3172
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
And so forth, but I just think this is just

3173
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Bungie had to sign with someone

3174
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
And Activision makes as good of a sense as anyone else

3175
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
If it had been EA

3176
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
People would have still been like, oh my god

3177
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
I can't believe it

3178
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
It could have been Konami

3179
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Oh my god

3180
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Doesn't matter

3181
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
I think Bungie just wanted to

3182
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Sign with somebody

3183
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
You knew it was gonna be somebody here in the US

3184
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Cause they're a US development company

3185
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
So it wasn't gonna be Konami or any of those

3186
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
SNK or any of those overseas companies

3187
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
It was gonna be an American company

3188
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
And that pretty much leaves EA and Activision

3189
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Pick one

3190
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Alright, anyhow

3191
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Moving on, Square Enix

3192
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
And one of the games they get requested about a lot

3193
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Is Final Fantasy 5 and Final Fantasy 6

3194
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
On the DS

3195
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Cause you might remember they had an epic, epic remake

3196
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Of Final Fantasy 3

3197
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
That was followed by an epic remake of Final Fantasy 4

3198
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
When I say epic remake, they were done in the more 3D-ish

3199
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Style of the newer Final Fantasy games

3200
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Which is pretty awesome

3201
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
So the big question on everybody's mind is

3202
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Where the hell is Final Fantasy 5

3203
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
And really Final Fantasy 5 is just a stepping stone

3204
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
To Final Fantasy 6

3205
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Because we want our opera scene in fully rendered 3D

3206
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Thank you very much

3207
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
But apparently

3208
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
It's not in development just yet

3209
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
There was apparently a Twitter thing

3210
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Going on earlier this week

3211
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
And one of the producers of Square Enix

3212
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Shinji Hashimoto

3213
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Was quoted on Twitter saying that

3214
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
They are undecided about

3215
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
A downloadable port of Second Densetsu 3

3216
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
And the mobile RPG Everheart Odyssey

3217
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
And then he also said

3218
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
For Final Fantasy 5 and 6

3219
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
There are technical issues as well

3220
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
So at present these are also

3221
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Undecided

3222
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Not sure what those technical issues are

3223
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
I wonder if it's space

3224
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
It's a much shorter game than 5 and 6

3225
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
And I wonder if they maybe have just maxed out

3226
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Those damn cartridges

3227
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
I wouldn't think so

3228
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
I don't think so

3229
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Well Amiga777

3230
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
In chat says Square Enix spare us

3231
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
The FMV theatrics and give us some awesome gameplay

3232
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
I agree I would sacrifice

3233
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
The full motion theatrics

3234
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
For some uber 3D-ness

3235
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
But I don't know

3236
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
At the same time

3237
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
I'm okay if they spend the resources just developing

3238
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Something new you know

3239
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Although I don't know I'm torn

3240
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Because the 3 and 4 remakes were pretty hot

3241
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
But at the same time I'm not like

3242
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Ah they need to do 5 and 6

3243
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Or you know if you just want to I don't know

3244
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Port say for example 4, 5 and 6

3245
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Onto a DS cartridge

3246
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
And don't even worry about upgrading it

3247
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
I'd be fine with that

3248
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Maybe it's something they're going to do for the 3DS

3249
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Hmm?

3250
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
I don't know

3251
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Alright guys well we

3252
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Are going to get into a segment here on the show

3253
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Called Listless

3254
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Yay Listless

3255
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Weee

3256
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
And for tonight's Listless

3257
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
We got to get one of our friends here on the phone

3258
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
So we're going to make a little

3259
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Outbound call right now

3260
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Tonight's Listless topic what Capcom

3261
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Versus series should they do

3262
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Next

3263
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Does somebody want to explain Listless how Listless works

3264
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
While I give our guest a call tonight

3265
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Well the way that it works

3266
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Is that we go around all of us

3267
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
And we each pick a game

3268
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
We pick 3 of them in

3269
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Order or pick a subject

3270
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
You know something that we would like to be on the list

3271
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Not a game tonight but something

3272
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
And then what happens is we leave it

3273
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
To the chat room to pick

3274
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Um

3275
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Well we each take one off of the list

3276
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
And then we leave it to the chat room to pick the winner

3277
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
That's right so if you want to help

3278
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Vote for the winner and remember guys

3279
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
This is the definitive list

3280
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
If this list is written there's no arguing

3281
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
It's done

3282
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
It's the definitive list it's a highly scientific

3283
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Process but in order to play the game

3284
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
We need 4 people so we're going to

3285
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Call up a special guest right now

3286
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Let me down the music here

3287
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
While we give our guest a call here

3288
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Hopefully he's standing by I told him it would be 8 o'clock

3289
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Otherwise

3290
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
We'll just open it up to somebody else on Skype

3291
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
I suppose

3292
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
One ringy dingy

3293
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Live radio it's fun two ringy dingys

3294
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Watch he's not going to pick up

3295
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Hello? Hi! Is this Jon?

3296
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Hi who's this? Oh my god

3297
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
It's crazy radio guy hey Jon

3298
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Oh hey I totally forgot you were calling

3299
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Hi

3300
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
You ass

3301
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
What are you doing did I interrupt something?

3302
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Ladies and gentlemen

3303
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
I have a bunch of friends from Securicon over and we're

3304
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Playing Halo and drinking

3305
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
You might be a little pissy but I remembered the topic

3306
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
For listless tonight

3307
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Well folks let me introduce

3308
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Because I didn't say who was coming on the show tonight

3309
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
This is our good buddy Jon Breslull

3310
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
From Undersedation Live

3311
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Saturday nights here at All Games Radio

3312
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
What are you like 7 o'clock 8 o'clock

3313
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Midnight now?

3314
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
8 o'clock Pacific 11 o'clock

3315
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Eastern

3316
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Did you know that one of your old co-hosts

3317
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Said that I sound like a straight version of you

3318
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Who is that? Jenna?

3319
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Or Jessica?

3320
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
When was she on the show? Yeah Jessica

3321
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
I haven't talked to her in years

3322
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
She's actually, whenever I take off from

3323
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
U.S.L. she's going to be hosting for me now

3324
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Oh wow

3325
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
How come I wasn't invited to be a guest host?

3326
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I see how it is

3327
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Okay well you can bring that up with Travis

3328
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
I will I will

3329
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
I'm going to be my Star Trek Online character just to find Travis

3330
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
And beat the shit out of him

3331
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Was Travis a human? I have to be a Klingon

3332
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
I don't know I don't play Star Trek Online

3333
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
I play WoW

3334
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
I don't know because certain somebody named Travis

3335
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Took me off of Facebook

3336
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Travis Donovan you're a bitch

3337
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Punch him in the balls

3338
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
That's always a good solution for Travis

3339
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
You know what though?

3340
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Facebook does weird things

3341
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
I've lost friends mysteriously

3342
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
He may not have done that on purpose

3343
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
If he did he's got some drama

3344
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Alright here we go

3345
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Let's do this

3346
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Hey tell the people in the background to shut up

3347
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
We're trying to do a radio show

3348
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Hey people in the background please stop masturbating

3349
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Alright

3350
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
How was Securicon by the way?

3351
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Did you have fun?

3352
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
It was a lot of fun

3353
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
I made a lot of friends

3354
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
I made a lot more friends and it was just a great time

3355
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Wait you have friends?

3356
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Definitely look forward to 2011

3357
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Oh good times good times

3358
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Aren't we supposed to be playing a game online soon or something?

3359
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Was I what?

3360
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Never mind

3361
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
I think I was talking about something I'm not supposed to talk about yet

3362
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Alright

3363
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Let's get into something else

3364
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Get into the list list

3365
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
You know tonight's topic is

3366
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
What Capcom vs series or should I say vs Capcom series

3367
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Should they do next?

3368
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,000
We're going to go around and get your top 3 answers

3369
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Breslow we'll start with you

3370
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Your number 3 answer

3371
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
What Capcom vs series should they do next?

3372
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
I'm throwing the political card on here

3373
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Because I think this is the most important one

3374
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Since I get to go first

3375
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
And I'm surprised I haven't done this

3376
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Capcom vs Midway

3377
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
That would be fun

3378
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
So like Mortal Kombat characters

3379
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Yeah so you'd have a bunch of Mortal Kombat characters

3380
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Against the Street Fighter characters and such

3381
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
I think that would be awesome

3382
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:32,000
I'm actually rewording your answer to be Midway vs Capcom

3383
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Because it's always something vs Capcom

3384
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Just so you know

3385
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
That was attractive

3386
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:42,000
By the way, logical answer coming from Breslow

3387
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
I mean this episode is full of shockers tonight

3388
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Alright

3389
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Who wants to go next?

3390
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Dark Sakura what do you want to pick for your number 3 answer?

3391
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Um

3392
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
McDonaldland vs Capcom

3393
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Mayor McCheese

3394
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
And the Grimace

3395
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
And the Fry Guys

3396
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
I fucking love it

3397
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
The Grimace

3398
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
And

3399
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Birdie the Early Bird

3400
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Hello?

3401
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Whatever happened in the McDonaldland characters?

3402
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Hello?

3403
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Breslow?

3404
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
It's McDonaldland vs Capcom

3405
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Is what it is

3406
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Oh our stream

3407
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
I want Mayor McCheese as the boss

3408
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Apparently our stream died

3409
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
And our thing is trying to reconnect right now

3410
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
But we're going to keep recording for podcast sake

3411
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Shit but now our chatters

3412
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Can't hear to vote

3413
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
We're going to hope

3414
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
The chatters right now are saying

3415
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
The all games stream vs Capcom

3416
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Because apparently we shut down

3417
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Alright we're back up

3418
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Alright so far we have Midway vs Capcom

3419
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
And McDonaldland vs Capcom

3420
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Alright Loki

3421
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
What is your number 3 answer tonight?

3422
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
I was trying to be slightly serious here

3423
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
So this is kind of obscure

3424
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
For people who don't remember

3425
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
But Paul Robertson vs Capcom

3426
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
And to explain

3427
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Who Paul Robertson is

3428
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
He's the guy that did the animation

3429
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Pirate Baby's Cabana Street Fight

3430
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
And then also

3431
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Yes that one

3432
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
That animation was such an amazing thing

3433
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Exactly and like

3434
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Devil eyes and just like

3435
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
All sorts of crazy ass 8 bit

3436
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Animation stuff so

3437
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
That would be kind of cool

3438
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Okay fair enough

3439
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Paul Robertson vs Capcom

3440
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
It's better than Pirate Baby's Cabana Street Fight

3441
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
vs Capcom

3442
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Alright my number 3 answer

3443
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
I have picked Saturday Night Live

3444
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
vs Capcom

3445
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Because

3446
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
I just won an excuse to

3447
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Beat the shit out of any character Chris Kattan

3448
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Who I never played

3449
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
And you know I think some of it would be kind of cool

3450
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
You know your favorite SNL

3451
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Like the coneheads and the guys that

3452
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Bob their heads to what is love

3453
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Baby don't hurt me

3454
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
SNL vs Capcom is my number 3 answer

3455
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Did you like that answer Bresloh?

3456
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
I did

3457
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
I beat the crap out of all the crappy skits

3458
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
They've done from like 97 to 2003

3459
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
I know it would be fun

3460
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Alright

3461
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Anyhow your number 2 answer

3462
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Bresloh and just to catch the folks up joining us

3463
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Because the feed was down so far we have

3464
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Midway vs Capcom

3465
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
McDonaldland vs Capcom

3466
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Paul Robertson vs Capcom

3467
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
And Saturday Night Live vs Capcom

3468
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
What is your

3469
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Number 2 answer

3470
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Bresloh?

3471
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
How bad would you want?

3472
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Jesus vs Capcom

3473
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
So Jesus vs Capcom

3474
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
You're not going to make it just

3475
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
The Bible?

3476
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Bible vs Capcom

3477
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Bible vs Capcom

3478
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
So you can play like Moses

3479
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
And Jesus

3480
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
What character

3481
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
God would be the end boss

3482
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Who would be the end boss?

3483
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
God

3484
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
God would be the end boss

3485
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Bible vs Capcom

3486
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
I love some of these answers in chat

3487
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
I'm just cracking up

3488
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Sarah your number 2 pick

3489
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
It was actually something on the serious end

3490
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
I picked

3491
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Arc System Works vs Capcom

3492
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
As in Guilty Gear and Blaze Blue

3493
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Ah okay

3494
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
So you want your Blaze Blue and all that stuff vs Capcom

3495
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
And the fighting

3496
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
The fighting systems

3497
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Are pretty similar too

3498
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
So I think it would be fun

3499
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
I want to have Strider hear you

3500
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
vs the little bad guy

3501
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Alright

3502
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Let's see, Loki what is your number 2

3503
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
answer tonight?

3504
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
You know I had to change one of my answers

3505
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Because of your SNL thing

3506
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
I got to top that

3507
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Although that would be my number 1 answer

3508
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Now it's going to be a semi serious one

3509
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Konami vs Capcom

3510
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
Because they have a lot of good 8-bit characters

3511
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
That would be pretty awesome to bring over

3512
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
You have different Contra characters

3513
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Hell you can put

3514
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Frogger in there if you want

3515
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Castlevania

3516
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
I mean that would be pretty awesome

3517
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Alright

3518
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
I'm also going to go with the super freaking

3519
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Obviously I was going to do

3520
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
See I don't know if this would

3521
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Well I'm going to go with a different one

3522
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Because I already have a list just in case mine gets taken

3523
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Mine was kind of a Konami thing

3524
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
But I'll go ahead and go in a different direction

3525
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
I'm going to do the completely obvious and probably stealing someone else's answer

3526
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
And why hasn't anyone thought of this yet

3527
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Nintendo vs Capcom

3528
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Hello

3529
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
I'm a jackass Ronald Roberts

3530
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
I mean hello

3531
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Mario, Samus

3532
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Pit, all the like

3533
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Super Smash Brothers Melee characters vs Capcom

3534
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Hello why is this not happening

3535
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Duh

3536
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Alright

3537
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Sounds like I took your answer didn't I Breslull

3538
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
You did

3539
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
My bad, well do you have a backup answer

3540
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Because we're ready for your number 1 answer

3541
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
So far, let me recap what you think

3542
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000

All games vs Capcom

3552
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
All games vs Capcom

3553
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Would you be one of the fighters in

3554
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
All games vs Capcom

3555
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
I would and so would you

3556
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Bitch slap people silly

3557
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
What would my special move be

3558
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
It would be to bitch slap people silly

3559
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
What would Dark Sakura's

3560
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
special move be

3561
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Um

3562
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Throwing Guinness bombs at people

3563
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
And Loki

3564
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Um

3565
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000

02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
GTA um

3568
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
What's it called at everybody

3569
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Alright

3570
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Dark Sakura

3571
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
It's time for your number 1

3572
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
answer, what is your number 1 answer

3573
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Blank vs Capcom

3574
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Taito

3575
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Could you imagine Bud and Bob

3576
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Getting like

3577
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Hadoken

3578
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
What would their special move be

3579
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
They'd just trap the opponent in a bubble

3580
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Yeah and pop them

3581
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
That might be fun

3582
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
They'd have special attacks like the water

3583
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Bubble

3584
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Boom

3585
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
We're recording this

3586
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Remember it's only porn if you tape it

3587
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
John blow your rape whistle

3588
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
Alright back to the show

3589
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Anything else you want to say about Taito vs Capcom

3590
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Rainbow Islands

3591
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Loki your number 1 answer please

3592
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
My number 1 answer is

3593
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Very obvious considering the

3594
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
SNL thing

3595
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
It's Nick at Nite vs Capcom

3596
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
And of course

3597
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
It's awesome because you have a fighting

3598
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
game with Bill Cosby

3599
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Will Smith

3600
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
From the Fresh Prince of Bel Air

3601
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
John shut the fuck up

3602
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
You're interrupting a professionally done radio

3603
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
show by raping me

3604
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
I just want you to know this

3605
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
This is a bad idea

3606
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Hey

3607
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Do you think you could stop getting your

3608
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
asshole raped by a woman

3609
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
In time to do this show here

3610
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Actually the worst part is I'm getting my

3611
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
asshole raped by a man

3612
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
That's nothing new

3613
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Loki

3614
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
Nick at Nite vs Capcom

3615
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Yes and I think the golden

3616
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
girls was on there one time so that would be

3617
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
pretty awesome

3618
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
The monkeys were on there and could you imagine that fight

3619
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
That would be pretty awesome

3620
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
As long as Bea Arthur is a character I'm fine

3621
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Would Bea Arthur be a character?

3622
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Sure then I'm fine

3623
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
My number 1 answer

3624
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
I'm gonna totally

3625
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Black Wolf says Cosby's ultra

3626
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
servant puddin' pop

3627
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
I'm gonna go with a very obvious number

3628
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
one that I'm surprised nobody has said yet

3629
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
but I'm gonna win myself a lot of fans with this

3630
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
one and my number 1 answer

3631
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Whedonverse vs

3632
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Capcom thank you very much

3633
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Dr. Horrible, Buffy the Vampire Slayer

3634
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Firefly

3635
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
and Firefly

3636
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Jane vs Capcom

3637
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Jane vs Capcom that would be

3638
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
funny

3639
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Joss Whedonverse vs Capcom

3640
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
And when he comes out the first thing he says is

3641
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
you're damaging my calm

3642
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Tell me that would not sell

3643
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
But we also need the blue

3644
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Like I'll be in my bunk

3645
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
But we also need like a mid

3646
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
boss to be like the blue hand guys

3647
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
from you know

3648
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000

02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Anyhow it's time now it's too

3675
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
late your suggestions didn't make the cut

3676
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
I'm sorry chat room that's just it's the it's

3677
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
one of life's tough lessons is that

3678
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
sometimes your account

3679
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000

3680
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
I said it sucks for those guys I know sucks

3681
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
to be them alright well at least they're not getting

3682

3683
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
uh here it is for your recap

3684
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000

3685
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
list alright Bresl so listen carefully

3686
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
cause I'm not gonna read this a million times

3687
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Midway vs Capcom

3688
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
McDonaldland vs Capcom

3689
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Paul Robertson vs Capcom

3690
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
SNL vs Capcom

3691
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Bible vs Capcom

3692
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Arc System Works vs Capcom

3693
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Konami vs Capcom

3694
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Nintendo vs Capcom

3695
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
All Games vs Capcom

3696
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
and Whedon vs Capcom

3697
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Bresl which one of these

3698
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
is not worthy of the list?

3699
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Nintendo vs Capcom

3700
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Oh you whore

3701
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
why not

3702
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
it'd be hard to go multiplatform

3703
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
because it would turn into the Capcom characters

3704
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
have to do button combinations and then you could

3705
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
just stamp Falcon Punch

3706
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
with the Nintendo characters

3707
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
I suppose I will accept that logic

3708
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
but you're still an asshole alright

3709
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Dark Sakura you're next

3710
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
which one of these is not worthy of the list?

3711
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Bible vs Capcom

3712
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
oh you just

3713
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
just

3714
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
not feeling Jesus

3715
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
as a playable character huh?

3716
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
I don't really give a crap about

3717
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Jesus in the game

3718
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
alright fair enough

3719
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Loki which one of these is not worthy of the list?

3720
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
uh

3721
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
I'm gonna have to go with Midway vs Capcom

3722
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
just because

3723
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
you know I've seen the

3724
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Coogan videos with the

3725
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
Mortal Kombat characters vs Street Fighter

3726
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
it looks weird okay

3727
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
I guess they could reanimate them

3728
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
but it would just be weird

3729
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
and besides Midway

3730
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
is no longer around so

3731
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
that's true it would be kinda hard to get the licensing wouldn't it

3732
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
alright as far as me

3733
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
which one of these is not worthy of the list?

3734
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
I'm gonna have to say Paul Robertson vs Capcom

3735
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
too obscure

3736
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
too obscure sorry Loki

3737
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
I'm sure it was funny but too obscure

3738
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000

3784
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
I think that was the first on air rape that we had

3785
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
going on during a fun happy say

3786
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
I don't think that was the first on air rape

3787
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
this show is on air rape

3788
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
that's true we do kind of rape gaming news

3789
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
every week

3790
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
back in the day when we used to broadcast live

3791
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
during some of those DDR parties

3792
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
yeah that was

3793
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
on air rape and I think that's where

3794
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
big black cock came into play

3795
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
alright

3796
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
please more gaming news

3797
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
darksagras save us

3798
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
for call of duty fans

3799
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
actually the next one coming out

3800
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
has been named

3801
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
it's call of duty

3802
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
black ops coming out on

3803
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
the 9th of November 2010

3804
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
that's at least the European date

3805
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
and they've confirmed co-op

3806
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
for it so

3807
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
you can play with your buddies together

3808
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
killing people

3809
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
and that's actually one

3810
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
that I would be interested in I think

3811
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
checking out is a black ops

3812
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
game you know

3813
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
instead of you know full on face front combo

3814
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
you know combat you have

3815
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
to be sneaky like solid snake

3816
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
so

3817
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
I

3818
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
well I'm sure the fans

3819
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
are just

3820
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
all they're saying is it's a

3821
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Treyarch call of duty

3822
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
so

3823
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
um

3824
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
alright so apparently

3825
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
this is kind of interesting and scary at the same time

3826
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
red faction

3827
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
a wonderful

3828
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
you know kind of sci-fi

3829
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
action game from

3830
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Q and volition is being

3831
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
turned into a TV

3832
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
movie the problem is

3833
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
it's being produced by sci-fi

3834
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
the same folks that brought us

3835
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
what was it

3836
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
mega shark versus

3837
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
giant octopus or whatever the hell

3838
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
it was that's

3839
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
scary I'm sorry how is this

3840
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
a problem

3841
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
I believe you just called

3842
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
this a problem because it's gonna

3843
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
suck the problem is the rumor I

3844
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
heard that sci-fi is like picking up wrestling

3845
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
and stuff now and they're not gonna do those movies

3846
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
anymore that's a problem

3847
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
they're all just

3848
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
blending together every station does

3849
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
not need wrestling okay

3850
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
unless they're dressing up like space

3851
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
aliens or people from

3852
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
battle star galactica it does not

3853
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
need to be on sci-fi there is nothing

3854
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
science fiction about wrestling except for the plot

3855
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
um

3856
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
what the hell is that

3857
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
watch the shark

3858
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
through the plane

3859
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
ah yes

3860
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
it is so

3861
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
this looks so fake I love it

3862
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
condor airlines

3863
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
and they had a

3864
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
image or whatever a little picture

3865
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
that someone made that talked about what

3866
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
it would take physics wise for

3867
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
the shark to do that it was just

3868
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
retarded

3869
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
ah yes high production

3870
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
value right there

3871
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
holy shit

3872
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
that's the kind of stuff you make

3873
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
in like high school how dare someone

3874
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
try to take this from me

3875
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
shark eating a

3876
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
plane how dare you try to take that out of

3877
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
my life anyways

3878
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
so they're gonna be doing

3879
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
possibly um

3880
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
an ongoing series

3881
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
as well if the movie does well so it's

3882
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
expected to be um

3883
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
coming out early 2011

3884
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
and um

3885
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
we'll see how it turns out cause

3886
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
most movies that are based on video

3887
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
games kinda suck and this one's

3888
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
done by sci-fi who puts out movies that

3889
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
pretty much always suck so

3890
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
I don't know it's like um

3891
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
a convergence of suck

3892
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
a convergence of suck really

3893
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
yes alright uh

3894
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
well we'll see what happens uh good thing

3895
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
they're not making a movie out of this but uh

3896
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
cause I think it would be kinda boring but apparently

3897
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
somebody has beat Bejeweled 2

3898
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
yes who knew that Bejeweled 2

3899
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
was beatable I sure didn't but Bejeweled 2

3900
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
got beaten this week after

3901
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
three years

3902
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
that's right this guy Mike

3903
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:38,000
Lady? Ladi? Ladi?

3904
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
he probably gets called Lady poor guy

3905
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Mike Ladi I'm gonna say it's Ladi

3906
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
uh apparently uh beat

3907
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Bejeweled 2 he played the same game

3908
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
for 2205

3909
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
hours and 51 minutes that

3910
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
was a score of 2

3911
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
billion 147 million

3912
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
so on and so on points apparently

3913
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
that's the point where the score display

3914
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
just went to black and there's actually

3915
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
a YouTube of it that's up um

3916
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
and PopCap just said hey

3917
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
you beat it they didn't

3918
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
want to acknowledge that the game broke they were just like

3919
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
you beat it congrats

3920
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
it's the Bejeweled kill screen

3921
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
yeah it's basically what it is the Bejeweled kill screen and you can

3922
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
actually see

3923
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
PopCap actually put up the video themselves

3924
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
exactly what that took

3925
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
and I think they put the picture

3926
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
of the kill screen here

3927
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
or not cause maybe PopCap

3928
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
didn't want to show their game breaking

3929
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
I don't know

3930
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
that was just like a little promotional video

3931
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
it was all happy go lucky

3932
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
yay Bejeweled were awesome

3933
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
play us on Facebook

3934
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
well somebody broke it so yes a kill screen

3935
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
is achievable in Bejeweled 2 but 3 years

3936
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
seriously

3937
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
seriously

3938
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
3 years is a long time

3939
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
I know right

3940
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
and that was all time when he was supposed to be working

3941
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
mailbag

3942
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000

3943
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
mailbagatorangelaungeradio.com

3944
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
darksacra might read them on air

3945
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
and she might decide to say screw you guys I'm not reading emails this week

3946
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
I'm reading them

3947
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
alright yay we caught her in a good mood

3948
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
hello Orange Lounge Radio

3949
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Haseo here to rant a bit

3950
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
first I'm sorry for spelling errors due to the use of

3951
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Vicodin after surgery involving

3952
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
knee dislocation dude sorry

3953
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
but you misspelled Vicodin

3954
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
you know what though I would say

3955
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
being on Vicodin is an acceptable excuse

3956
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
for bad grammar dude when you're on Vicodin you don't

3957
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
care

3958
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
we're going to give them a pass

3959
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
second I was really just saying that to be

3960
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
a smartass second the whole Activision

3961
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
bullshit starting with this whole

3962
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
Infinity Ward leaving the company

3963
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Infinity Ward left Activision

3964
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
and they as we already

3965
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
know are the creators of Call of Duty

3966
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
now according to G4 and their

3967
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
the feed service

3968
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
they say that the next Call of Duty games will be called

3969
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
Call of Duty Black Ops comes out this fall

3970
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
what the hell is Activision thinking?

3971
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
especially when the Infinity Ward founders left and

3972
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
35 other team members quit oh and did I mention

3973
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
they are suing Activision for up to

3974
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
500 million

3975
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
for reasons untold to me

3976
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
now Activision as stupid as they are

3977
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
they have the Bungie

3978
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
they have Bungie the creators of Halo

3979
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
sign a 10 year contract what the hell

3980
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
lastly three questions

3981
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
one would it be illegal

3982
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
to infect my aunts computer with a virus

3983
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
to teach her a lesson?

3984
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
how would I go about that?

3985
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
well she's a bitch I mean

3986
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
no I'm not trying to cripple it only trying to

3987
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
burst her I'm not to blame for the

3988
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
fucking it up bubble like a warning virus

3989
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
switch her default browser

3990
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
to Internet Explorer I think that will pretty much do it

3991
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
I thought it would do it

3992
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
have her use yahoo mail

3993
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
just switch her homepage to

3994
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
two girls one cup

3995
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
or lemon party

3996
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
two

3997
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
is there a way to hack a copy of Final Fantasy 12

3998
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
like you hacked 13

3999
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
or do you know of a cheat I've beaten it over a year ago

4000
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
and I want to replay for story

4001
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
cause Loki's a big cheater

4002
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
at 13 so can you cheat at 12?

4003
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
12 I'm not sure

4004
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
if there's a way to hack set at the

4005
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
save I mean maybe

4006
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
I'm sure there is

4007
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
three

4008
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
you just need a game genie

4009
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
is there a way to hack an imported

4010
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
UMD and change the text to English?

4011
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
no

4012
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
but yeah back to the

4013
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Final Fantasy 12 thing because it's on Playstation 2

4014
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
you could probably just get like a game shark or

4015
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
approach and replay or something like that

4016
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
if you don't want to cheat in the game

4017
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
why did

4018
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat just say two girls

4019
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
one cup versus Capcom?

4020
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
because he's trying to mess with

4021
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
our brains I think the cup wins

4022
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
thanks for reading my email

4023
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
and if you don't what the fuck people

4024
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
your loyal listener Hasia Sumiragawa

4025
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Sumiragawa

4026
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Sumiragawa

4027
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
made me

4028
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
I was just thinking of the cup winning

4029
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
whoever wins we all lose

4030
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
this is Robert M. I don't mean

4031
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
to sound like one of those one-knit fanboys

4032
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
but since it came out I'm pretty obsessed with WarioWare

4033
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
DIY even though I'm currently somewhat

4034
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
stagnant at creating new games in it

4035
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
for some reason I actually had a dream

4036
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
where one of my micro games set

4037
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
a record for in-game sales

4038
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
which somehow made the Orange Knowledge

4039
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Radio show roll I remember

4040
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Loki saying he didn't get it meaning the game

4041
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
and all of you were

4042
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
as all you did was tap and a character

4043
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
moves up slightly

4044
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
this somehow leads to a kernel of thought would you like to

4045
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
see a series of OLR dream game micro

4046
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
games or would you of course

4047
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
prefer these concepts in a more substantial

4048
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
more readily accessible less handheld

4049
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
format I imagine having puzzle

4050
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
slots or what they play snap

4051
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
available in my warehouse might be

4052
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
confusing to other people

4053
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
in my in-game friends list have a good

4054
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
show I think we'll take it in whatever format

4055
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
we can get it yeah I know I'll take it wherever I can get it

4056
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
but I think what they play dot com snap would

4057
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
be very I mean because what was what

4058
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
they play dot com snap supposed to be was just like what

4059
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
two gay guys having sex holding

4060
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
a dismembered head shouting fuck wasn't that the whole

4061
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
and you take pictures of it like Pokemon

4062
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
snap yeah and if you if you're kind of

4063
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
like sitting at your radio right now in disgust

4064
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
um it has to do with a poll

4065
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
that what they play dot com ran like a

4066
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
year ago about the most offensive game

4067
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
most offensive thing in video games

4068
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
and like I think homos and games was like

4069
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
more offensive than dismembered heads or something

4070
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
um so we suggested that they

4071
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
should make a game about it called what they play dot com

4072
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
snap uh go read about it in

4073
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
the OLR wiki it's it's all there

4074
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
this next email just made me

4075
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
snort hard

4076
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
hi OLR as usual thank you for

4077
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
supporting yyr games OLR is awesome

4078
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
and so is everyone who listens to it

4079
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
as a show under mat

4080
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
relayed your game request discussed

4081
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
during the last weeks show apparently you have requested

4082
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
a game based on the golden girls yes

4083
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
yes please oh my god yes

4084
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
after spending many hours sweating countless

4085
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
buckets and crumbling hundreds of pieces

4086
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
of paper before tossing them in the general

4087
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
direction of a wastebasket I'm prepared to

4088
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
unveil the following concept the golden girls

4089
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
death squad

4090
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
the golden girls death squad will be a four player

4091
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
cooperative twin stick shooter

4092
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
each player will assume the likeness of either

4093
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Dorothy, Rose, Blanche or Sophia

4094
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
and battle an advancing army of terrorist robots

4095
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
and balding perverted old men in full

4096
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
180p high definition I'm sorry

4097
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
I'm about to explode from awesomeness

4098
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Rob needs to go change his mantis

4099
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
I do

4100
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
you'll use the left stick to maneuver each

4101
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
girl's technologically advanced mechanical

4102
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
wheelchair each wheelchair

4103
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
is equipped with its own unique weaponry

4104
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
just as each girl is equipped with wisecracks

4105
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
and quips taken straight from the popular TV

4106
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
show voiced by the original actresses

4107
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
spoken dialogue varies with context

4108
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
when you get close to an enemy you'll hear Dorothy cry

4109
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
have you lost your head? as she chops off their

4110
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
head with an axe

4111
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
each of the game's seven levels

4112
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Rob's red in the

4113
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
face this is beautiful

4114
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
each of the seven levels

4115
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
are loosely based on the show's seven seasons

4116
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
boss enemies will include Dorothy's cheating husband

4117
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Stanley evil palette swapped versions

4118
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
of the main characters and the

4119
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
leader of a cult named high cholesterol

4120
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
fortunately you will have rocket

4121
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
launchers nuclear bombs exploding calcium

4122
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
supplements as part of your wheelchair arsenal

4123
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
the game will feature

4124
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
four player simultaneous drop in drop out

4125
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
play over xbox live

4126
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
60 frames per second animation simple and

4127
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
responsive controls motion capture versions of the

4128
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
show's actresses and a driving

4129
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
rock and electronic soundtrack featuring

4130
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
a hard drum and bass mix of the show's

4131
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
opening theme thank you for being a friend

4132
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
development of the game will commence immediately upon

4133
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
our receipt of the rights to the golden girl's license

4134
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
um you can help me get that for free right

4135
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
the budget currently allocated for

4136
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
the development of this game consists of

4137
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
the four dollars in my wallet I'd hate to

4138
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
use it on licensing when I can pick up a sandwich

4139
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000

02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
unlimited 2 I was a big

4199
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
fan of the original test drive unlimited

4200
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
and we had an ol army clubhouse

4201
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
joystick shows the demo reel here

4202
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
um

4203
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
it doesn't look like lost islands oahu setting

4204
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
at least not for the video it does

4205
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
look a lot more types

4206
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
of driving events but the character models are

4207
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
sims 2 ish still it releases

4208
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
in fall amongst the big titles so I hope

4209
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
it does well I never did get to play my 5000

4210
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
miles in the first one I remember

4211
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
test drive that was a pretty neat game

4212
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
um it's

4213
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
taken him long enough to kind of put out news of a sequel

4214
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
I don't know I'll play it if it's good

4215
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
but it's going to be tough because there's so many racing

4216
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
games coming out that I'm so interested in

4217
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
you know but um well that'll be

4218
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
I'll be a ways out by the way

4219
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
that's it going back

4220
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
to the email

4221
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
from yyr act def says

4222
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
you can call it golden age

4223
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
grannies killing spree

4224
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
this is great the prize has to still be cheesecake

4225
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
yes

4226
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
grannies with a z

4227
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
I made a game with grannies in it

4228
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
alright there was our mail bag

4229
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
and now it's time

4230
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
imagine grannies

4231
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
I know this is a little

4232
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
outside of the box for you I know this is

4233
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
not a retro game or inspired

4234
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
by you know other stuff but I'm telling you

4235
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
instant cash machine

4236
02:23:52,000 --> 02:24:10,000
alright lets get into the fus of the week

4237
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:14,000
f u to um

4238
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
caffeine withdrawal headaches

4239
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
they stink

4240
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
yeah

4241
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
low key

4242
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
um

4243
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
I guess

4244
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
f u to my neighbors

4245
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
pushes for still being alive even after

4246
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
I dumped a half gallon of weed

4247
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
killer on them

4248
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
damn you weeds

4249
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
oh I will kill them

4250
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
um

4251
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
I don't really have much of an f u of the week

4252
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
I'm again in fairly good spirits

4253
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
I will say f u to me being such a procrastinator

4254
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
cause I procrastinated

4255
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
on something big time I really should have got taken

4256
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
care of a lot sooner but whatever

4257
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
hey you know what life goes on

4258
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
alright

4259
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
there's worse things that could happen in the world

4260
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
lets move on

4261
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
we got a couple more stories for you guys

4262
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
then the listless results

4263
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
and then the skype line

4264
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
and listless by the way I will say this about listless

4265
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
this doesn't happen very often in listless

4266
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
but every single answer

4267
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
tonight got at least one vote

4268
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
every single answer usually something gets shut out

4269
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
but it's going to be a close one tonight

4270
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
so hopefully you guys all voted if not

4271
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
you got like 30 seconds left

4272
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
loki what do you got for us

4273
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
while we wrap these up stop playing that game

4274
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
what are you playing now

4275
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
yes you are you're playing that freaking

4276
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
contra in castlevania meet

4277
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
super mario brothers and all that crap

4278
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
alright

4279
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
well this is appropriate I guess

4280
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
or not I don't know

4281
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
it's of course you know a parody game

4282
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
and only in

4283
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
japan of course created by

4284
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
joe jin circle studio

4285
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
s super strip

4286
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
fighter 4 is a

4287
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
18 and up parody fighting

4288
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
game with 15 brawlers

4289
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
and skimpy outfits and apparently

4290
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
there's also one big fat geek dude in there as well

4291
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
and um

4292
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
I guess it has parodies of

4293
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
fighters from king of fighters

4294
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
tekken virtual fighter

4295
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
street fighter you name it and of course

4296
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
um each character

4297
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
has their own special abilities

4298
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
for example rana

4299
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
who is covered in massage oil which she uses

4300
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
to rub on herself on the

4301
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
other fighters and uh

4302
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
slip past their punches

4303
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
um or they have um some other people

4304
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
who throw vibrators

4305
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
and what not but it's um

4306
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
a game where they basically get

4307
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
uh

4308
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
they get uh

4309
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
their clothes ripped off as they're fighting

4310
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
so awesome

4311
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
only playable

4312
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
in japan I'm afraid

4313
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
oh what a big surprise

4314
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
a game like that is never going to come out here

4315
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
what a shock

4316
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
but they have some screenshots and it's uh

4317
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
interesting I guess

4318
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
amaze satsuma in our chat room says

4319
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
super strip fighter isn't that called

4320
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
dead or alive

4321
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
ba dum bum ba dum bum merrimay is a comedian here at

4322
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
olr

4323
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
orange lounge radio of course as you know started

4324
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
about a little game called

4325
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
adr and the other types of music games that were out there

4326
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
in a series called bamani

4327
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
well guess what the bamani series is still alive

4328
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
so we want to take our last story

4329
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
tonight to show you guys

4330
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
one of the new bamani series

4331
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
that's coming out well we're not going to show you because it's a radio show

4332
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
but we're going to talk about it it's called reflect

4333
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
beat that's right a brand new game of the bamani

4334
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
series called reflect beat is apparently

4335
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
location testing

4336
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
what is going on here it's a

4337
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
multi touch space touch screen

4338
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
I guess up to five simultaneous

4339
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
touches will register on the screen it's a two player

4340
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
player game it's two machines

4341
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
linked together if there's no second player you can play

4342
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
against the CPU it's made

4343
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
at a wide screen and what happens is that

4344
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
player one has a red colored bar across the bottom

4345
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
of the screen and player two has a blue colored bar

4346
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
across the bottom of their screen and what happens

4347
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
is that at the start of the game the music begins

4348
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
and a ring shaped note appears at the center of the

4349
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
screen the note travels from the center to

4350
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
the player's bottom bar the

4351
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
player touches the bottom bar when

4352
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
and where ever the note

4353
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
meets the bar to the beat of the music

4354
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
if you hit it then it changes

4355
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
to the color of the player and bounces right

4356
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
back to the opponent the rate

4357
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
at which it will move will depend on the music

4358
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
so if it's a slow BPM then

4359
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
the note will move slowly and so on and so on

4360
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
there's hold notes, chain notes

4361
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
and so forth they say it's also

4362
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
a lot like boom boom rocket

4363
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
if you've ever played that on xbox live with the whole

4364
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
bar and the exploding fireworks

4365
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
some of the songs in the game there's

4366
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
a remix of star mine 7 7

4367
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
a song called

4368
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
juicy I'll leave that to

4369
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
your imagination and silence so on

4370
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
and so on so reflect beat a new

4371
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
game in the bamani series

4372
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
there's even some pictures that are posted around there

4373
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
on the internets so you can see what this game looks

4374
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
like it kinda

4375
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
looks like dj max technica

4376
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
a little bit that's what I was totally thinking

4377
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
when I saw it I was thinking I wonder if

4378
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000

well what's on your mind and what do we owe the phone call to

4748
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
uh

4749
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
sims 3 that's

4750
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
annoying that when it

4751
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
walks up

4752
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
are you how do you feel

4753
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
about sims 3 coming to consoles

4754
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
i uh say almost

4755
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
uh j and

4756
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
them kind

4757
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
uh well

4758
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
uh well it's gonna be

4759
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
it's gonna be get

4760
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
dumbed down and

4761
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
which is boo hoo

4762
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
but here's the other thing though

4763
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
is that well uh

4764
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
the uh well

4765
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
and lucky us for us hardcore

4766
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
sims players the new

4767
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
expansions expansion

4768
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
set ambitions

4769
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
will hit

4770
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
the pc before we get sims

4771
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
3 on the console

4772
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
hmm

4773
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
uh yeah because sims 3 on the console is gonna probably

4774
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
be a ways out especially if we're just hearing about it now

4775
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
you know i haven't heard dark soccer talk about sims 3

4776
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
in a long time i've actually been sitting here

4777
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
installing my sims 3 oh it did all the talk

4778
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
about it tonight well no um

4779
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
because what's been going on is because i have

4780
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
a lot of mods in my game

4781
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
i have to completely reinstall

4782
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
and delete my registries

4783
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
so yeah and it decided to fart on me

4784
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
so uh

4785
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
i have a question dark sakura actually

4786
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
how do you um

4787
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
the registry

4788
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
erasing

4789
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
what the hell how do you do that

4790
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
how do you do that

4791
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
since well um

4792
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
because my

4793
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
current problem in sim 3 is that

4794
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
well my school

4795
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
building is borked

4796
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
they can

4797
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
be in the school building for like

4798
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
2 minutes and then

4799
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
they uh

4800
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
it just stops i don't know

4801
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
i have no idea

4802
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
that's something that you're probably gonna have to

4803
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
check on the sims 3 forum for

4804
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
yeah

4805
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
i've never had that problem so i don't

4806
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
know how to help with it

4807
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
what's supposed to be coming in this next sims 3

4808
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
expansion what's the

4809
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
big thing that they're going to do with this

4810
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
uh

4811
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
like they were they are

4812
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
apparently they're gonna make

4813
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
a move that

4814
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
to make

4815
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
make a move on those

4816
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
those players that

4817
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
never leave the sims

4818
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
the sim creator

4819
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
or uh

4820
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
the or the uh

4821
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
like where they

4822
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
just build lots

4823
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
and never play the actual sims game

4824
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
well if they're happy doing

4825
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
that i don't understand why they're gonna ruin

4826
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
that get out and play the game

4827
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
dammit

4828
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
yeah well but

4829
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
it's like never mind really so

4830
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
it's

4831
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
it's interesting though you know there's a lot going on

4832
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
in um i don't wanna

4833
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
compare the sims 3 to wow but i will

4834
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
uh there's a lot going on

4835
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
in wow right now where they're really changing up the game

4836
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
and they're changing it in some big big ways

4837
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
and it's kind of causing the player base to

4838
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
have some rabble rabble although blizzard

4839
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
changes big shit with every patch

4840
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
and everything works out just fine but i guess the big

4841
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
thing that's causing rabble rabble is that

4842
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
now the 10 man and 25 man

4843
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
raids are gonna share the same lockout

4844
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
so if you're in one of those raiding guilds that does 10

4845
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
mans and 25 mans every week you're gonna have to pick

4846
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
one or the other not gonna be able

4847
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
not gonna be able to do both anymore

4848
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
we all have to do different raids or something like that

4849
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
same loot and everything

4850
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
it's gonna be very interesting they're saying oh it's gonna kill 25

4851
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
man raiding so you know

4852
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
big changes to the game but sometimes it works out for the better

4853
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
so in a way and you know i'm relating

4854
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
this back to sims 3 i promise

4855
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
you know if they're gonna change some of the core elements of the game

4856
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
maybe it's just because they kind of

4857
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
see the habits of the players right now and

4858
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
they kind of want to course people into

4859
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
looking at this whole other part of the game that they've

4860
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
developed that nobody's looking at

4861
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
and also

4862
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
a thing that's apparently

4863
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
coming with the new expansion is that

4864
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
there's gonna be apparently

4865
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
natural disasters

4866
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
coming

4867
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
now there you go

4868
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
there

4869
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
we have something really interesting

4870
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
now that kind of reminds me

4871
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
if that would happen

4872
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
because well the

4873
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
optimal would be if they

4874
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
made a

4875
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
well what's the

4876
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
season

4877
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
i think it's actually called

4878
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
the seasons

4879
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
expansion that they made for sims 2

4880
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
since well

4881
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
since i'm like a snow person i would

4882
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
love to have my sims

4883
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
playing in snow

4884
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
but here's the problem

4885
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
is that

4886
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
your cure

4887
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
even though the problem that i would have

4888
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
with that is that my current sims

4889
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
house is

4890
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
not is

4891
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
not exactly a winter

4892
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
house because they would

4893
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
would freeze if so

4894
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
were the case if you have to have walls around

4895
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
everything since i'm like

4896
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
i'm having like one bed here

4897
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
one bed there all the all in the opening

4898
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
i have to say

4899
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
though this expansion where they want to

4900
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
add like natural disasters

4901
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
kind of reminds me of the roots of the sim

4902
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
series which would be sim city

4903
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
which is kind of the game that started it all

4904
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
because remember you could have natural disasters in sim city

4905
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
like your nuclear power plant blowing up

4906
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
or godzilla attacks the city

4907
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
good times

4908
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
indeed good times

4909
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
