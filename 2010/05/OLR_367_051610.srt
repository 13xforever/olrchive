00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 367 of Orange Lounge Radio

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The video game talk show where every gamer has a voice

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
First on up, the one, the only, the fabulous, Dark Sakura

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Here's my impression of Rob earlier

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What?

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What episode number is this?

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Okay, no. Okay, before we went on air, because you know, I wanted to have the episode number down

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Because I lost count like three years ago, longer than that, where we were at with the show

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You know I have to give you a hard time

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So I said, what episode number are we on? Just kind of like a rhetorical question

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Like I'm actually going to look it up, like I don't expect Dark Sakura or Loki to know it

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And Jamie in the background, she's all, 69

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I said 50 million

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh did you? I thought you said 69

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You said 69

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I thought you said 69

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I totally thought she said 69 too

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I said 50 million

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Alright so it's episode number 69 of Orange

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Actually in two weeks, no three weeks, because there's not going to be a show in a couple weeks

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But the show after Labor Day will be episode number 369

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Brought to you by the multiples of three

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That's right

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh that is weird, 369

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Alright anyhow

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Also the other voice you hear over there, the one and only tech master Loki

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Hello

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Who's favorite game by the way, is that Rainbow Unicorn game

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It is not

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That's all you ever play on this program is Rainbow Unicorn

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's not what I play

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I played the werewolf ice cream man one not too long ago

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
How dare I

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And I played the, was it the Mario crossover game the other week

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I just didn't have the link for the Mario crossover game because I was going to play that

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That was actually pretty awesome with the Contra guys blowing up all the blocks

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I do have the link to the Unicorn game but that's about all I have right now

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Alright also joining us tonight, you guys in our chat room because we do tape live every week at All Games Radio

We're going to move into a little bit of how was your gaming week

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's how we always start off the show

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
First off Dark Sakura, I understand, school's out for summer

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yay

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Well I'm going to school in the summer

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Oh never mind then

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Well but I make it to skip pre-algebra

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Well who

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Because for some reason ARC's website just let me sign up for algebra in the fall

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And I was going to do like the self study thing in the summer because it's freaking pre-algebra so whatever

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So I may only be taking history this summer but that means I graduate

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Wow

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
In the fall

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Wow

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
With my AA

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
My AA

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
My AA

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Your alcoholics anonymous

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
AA

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Alright

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So you'll actually have time to actually play games again, it'll be great

72
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I've been playing games though

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Alright well tell us a little bit about your gaming week

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Even though I've had like my final projects and crap due

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I played, well I downloaded something for free that we'll be talking about later because everybody freaking downloaded it

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I was having a wait in the damn queue

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And then I played that stupid gay ass unicorn game

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Excuse you

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No that's what it's called

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Oh okay

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Well you have to have the ass to make your unicorn be extra gay or something I don't know

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Wait wait wait wait you're not talking about

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
No the one on Steam

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Oh you played the Pink Anus game

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Anus that was it

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I thought, I was thinking of the hand he called

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh gosh what was the name of it

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Magic Stone or Legend of Magic Stone or something

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay yes

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I got as far as looking in the stable and I was like this is crap and turned it off

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Just so those you know catching up with OLR

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's also very Engrishy

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Who haven't heard the past few episodes

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
There's a game on Steam and it was Alan that brought it to our attention

96
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Where in the, it's like something like about a mystical unicorn or whatever

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And you see in the screenshots like there's like a crafting screen or something

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And one of the materials you use is A-E-N-U-S it's anus but it's pink

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So it's the magical unicorn with pink anus game

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And Dark Sakura bought it cause she's a consumer whore

101
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And hell

102
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But no like I tried to, it's really like a click and drag type stuff to use things

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And I was like this is like a big bad flash game

104
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You can groom his hooves

105
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And he was a little cult when you first got him

106
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And now he's a golden unicorn with sparklies falling out of his butt

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
At least that's what it looked like

108
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I put up a screen capture somewhere I think on my Twitter or something

109
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You make everybody want to play this game very badly

110
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Here's my review

111
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Pink sparkles out of a unicorn's anus

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's anus

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
A-E-N-U-S

114
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Anus

115
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
My anus is bleeding

116
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Or would it be

117
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It would be emus cause the neod

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Anyway and then and then and then and then and then and then and then

119
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I know you can't have it cause you can't spell your

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Sorry

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Um

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Then um

123
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I played other stuff

124
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yeah I played more um

125
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Beluga whale

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm sorry S-B-G-B

127
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And um

128
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I played um well well we've been

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Well I was watching Dan play Alan Wake

130
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And here's our review of it

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Um

132
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Max Payne meets Silent Hill

133
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The end

134
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's actually not that bad

135
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And then um

136
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Oh god we played some other stuff too

137
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Oh yeah I went to Pinagogo

138
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So I played pinball

139
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Isn't that like a big convention type thing for pinball?

140
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's in Dixon

141
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Oh nevermind

142
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Well no it was a pretty big event for pinball folks

143
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Just to describe Dixon

144
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Like if you're driving between Sacramento which is OLR headquarters

145
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And you know the capital of California

146
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And if you're driving between Sacramento and San Francisco which is where all the fun things are

147
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Dixon is kind of like the pink anus of that drive

148
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's like

149
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Sorry the pink anus

150
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You look over and you see a gas station

151
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
A Mary's pizza shack and farms

152
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That's about it

153
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And fruit stand

154
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And fruit

155
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I went to the Yolo fruit stand yesterday but anyway

156
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So yeah um I got

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I also

158
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And I forget this every year because I've been to like four Pinagogos now

159
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm allergic to the town of Dixon

160
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No seriously

161
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
No I'm being absolutely serious

162
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay

163
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Every time I've been to Dixon

164
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I end up getting some type of weird heat stroke

165
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
My allergies get like

166
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You know how allergic I am to dogs

167
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It gets that bad

168
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I swear

169
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I took two doses of Benadryl Sudafed and Zyrtec

170
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And I was taking local honey

171
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And giving myself shots

172
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And you name it for allergies I was doing

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I was snorting crap

174
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I was still like super you know

175
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Eyedrops my eyeballs were floating

176
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And it was just like not

177
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It was not beautiful

178
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I felt like that my eyeballs were the size of like

179
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Double the size of my head

180
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And so I went and sat in the car

181
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Texted Dan I'm sick

182
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I kept hiding in the bathroom because it was in a place with air conditioning

183
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And um playing Final Fantasy 2

184
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Sitting on the floor of the bathroom at the Dixon Mayfair

185
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Sounds like fun

186
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Sounds like the sophistication being sucked right out of you

187
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And that's why you're having all those you know

188
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Complications and stuff

189
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Just like sorry you're too sophisticated for here

190
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And well I finally ended up going and sat out in the car

191
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So I could turn on the air conditioner

192
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And filter out the pollen

193
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Because you know we run the AC in my car

194
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
No pollen gets in you know

195
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And so I was doing that long enough to get everything settled down

196
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So I could take some more stuff

197
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And so finally I get to where I'm feeling better

198
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I drink some vitamin water I'm feeling good

199
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And then Dan texts me so do you want to go home?

200
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yes

201
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And not to not to not to say anything bad about the uh

202
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Pina Gogo

203
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Because it's a great event

204
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But if you have hay fever

205
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If you've got allergies to nature to grass

206
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Um don't go unless you bring your own plastic bubble

207
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And then it makes the plastic bubbles really can't play pinball very well in them

208
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So I just totally wouldn't you know

209
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I would say um a gas mask could work

210
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You could actually play the gas mask on that would work

211
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But as far as what I played um

212
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I played uh Back to the Future

213
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And I played Revenge from Mars

214
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Which is one of the pinball 2000

215
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And um I played F14 Tomcat

216
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I was going for mostly the mid 80s to early 90s era of pinball

217
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You know just kind of get into it

218
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And I played this 80s

219
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's like a mullet era of pinball

220
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Well I was going to say speaking of that

221
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I played a pinball machine called Punk

222
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And it had like the you know

223
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Looked like uh pictures from uh

224
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What was that movie with Nicolas Cage

225
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And Valley Girl

226
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You know and all the

227
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The guys on the on the play field

228
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Looked like Duran Duran

229
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And it was kind of funny

230
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Even though they weren't very punk they had that hair though

231
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But um and eyeliner

232
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Um and that one was actually pretty fun

233
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
For an old school you know

234
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Earlier era of pinball

235
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And there was a Beatles pinball there

236
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I took a picture to send to Tiara

237
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I didn't realize they made a Beatles pinball game

238
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Kind of random

239
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And um there was like a Spiderman

240
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And the Ted Nugent one

241
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I love the picture from the Ted Nugent one

242
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Because he's there with his hair

243
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And the guitar and the guitar's a gun

244
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And he's shooting out of his guitar gun

245
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And I was like rock on Ted

246
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Huge anyway

247
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And so uh I was

248
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And my other thing and I know I'm going off on this

249
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Is I was actually so caught up

250
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Because me being the big design

251
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Freaking nerd that I am

252
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I was going around taking pictures of

253
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Of interesting design

254
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Of like cool pictures and neat you know

255
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Early 80's late 70's style art

256
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And

257
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So I'll put some of the pictures up

258
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
They're on my phone

259
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yeah you're a nerd yeah

260
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But I did play other games

261
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Well I said I played Final Fantasy II didn't I?

262
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yes while you're on the bathroom floor

263
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Crying and sobbing because of your allergies

264
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I wasn't crying

265
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And um

266
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yeah I played some Star Trek Online

267
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Fun

268
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm sure I played something else

269
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Oh yeah I started playing Braid

270
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And then I

271
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Kind of remembered that I had to do other things like homework

272
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm done with my finals

273
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I love how you sum it up

274
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I started to play this game

275
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But then I was like oh god I have something better to do

276
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Bye

277
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
No it wasn't something better to do

278
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It was something responsible to do

279
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Rob

280
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Screw that growing up

281
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So you're Robba and our other one is Robba

282
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I know I know

283
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Alright Loki I don't know if you can top

284
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Dark Sakura's adventures in Dickson

285
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Pinball and Final Fantasy II on the bathroom floor

286
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
While she's trying to recover from allergies

287
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But you want to try?

288
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I didn't go to Dickson

289
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
That's already an improvement right there

290
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Let's see

291
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I played

292
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I played a lot of things that

293
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Have yet to come out

294
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Including APB

295
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I've been playing the beta of that and I love it

296
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Because it's just like

297
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
To me it's like crossing Saints Row with

298
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Free Mode and Grand Theft Auto 4

299
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You kind of

300
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Do what you need to do

301
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You have different missions

302
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I guess this would be the tutorial portion of the game

303
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
They have you go

304
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Spray graffiti

305
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And break

306
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Some stuff

307
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And then eventually at the seal stuff

308
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
In the course later on as it's going on

309
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You'll gain

310
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
More notoriety and

311
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
They'll have more enforcers

312
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Coming at you

313
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And the enforcers of course are played by

314
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
People online as well

315
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So you can play

316
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Both the villains and

317
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Kind of the heroes I guess in the game

318
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm playing of course as one of the gang bangers

319
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Because that's fun

320
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Lots of customization

321
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
In the character creator

322
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's just nuts

323
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
How much customization is in there

324
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The clothing though you don't really have a lot of options

325
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
At first you have to kind of buy that stuff

326
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Or unlock it later on

327
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
When you finish different missions

328
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Same with cars and what not

329
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But I'm really digging it

330
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I might go back to

331
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That as an MMO but we'll see

332
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I kind of like the fact though that

333
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The way they have their

334
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Pay scale for it

335
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Basically you pay it as you go

336
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So for someone like me that doesn't

337
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Necessarily get a lot of time

338
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
To dedicate to MMOs or stuff like that

339
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It wouldn't be so bad because

340
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You know the time I'm not playing it

341
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm not actually losing out on anything

342
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Because you pay for the hours that you

343
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Want to use

344
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It sounds good to me

345
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I may try it

346
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I have to upgrade my computer though too

347
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So it might be a little bit

348
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Other fun stuff

349
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I happened to get a copy of

350
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Red Dead Redemption a little early

351
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So I've been playing that

352
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And I love the game

353
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Not a big surprise because it's a little bit like Grand Theft Auto

354
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But for me

355
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
A lot of it's been like Oregon Trail

356
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Extreme

357
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Nice

358
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's a hunting portion of Oregon Trail

359
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Because in the game you make money

360
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You can hunt stuff and skin them

361
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And take the meat and the skins

362
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Or whatever

363
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
But you could only carry 100 pounds back to the wagon?

364
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Oh no I was able to kill a lot of things

365
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I don't know about 100 pounds worth of skins

366
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Did you know in that game you can skin a horse?

367
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I did not know that

368
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yes you can skin a horse

369
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Because I got through with this one mission

370
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Where I had to go

371
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Kill some gang members

372
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Kind of hiding in this house

373
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And so we killed them

374
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Captured them or whatever

375
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And all their horses were left around

376
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And I'm like I can't ride six horses

377
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
What am I going to do with this?

378
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So I killed them all and skinned them

379
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And sold their skins

380
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
For $2 each

381
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And then I saw Onward Dills running around

382
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Breaking news

383
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
PETA hates Red Dead Redemption

384
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Oh I'm sure they will

385
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You can kill all sorts of creatures out there

386
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I haven't found the bears yet though

387
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
But it's really cool

388
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And the fact that the game looks a lot better

389
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Than Grand Theft Auto

390
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Just a few years

391
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And the amount of improvements in the engine

392
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's just amazing

393
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Definitely worth picking up though

394
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Then another game I was quite excited to check out

395
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Was Split Second

396
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And really digging that

397
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I love how crazy the races are in the game

398
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And just

399
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I didn't play a whole lot of it

400
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So I got to play some of the one track

401
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That they had I think at E3

402
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
The airport

403
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
That's just the demo

404
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I didn't play a lot of it

405
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
But I love the game

406
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's awesome

407
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I was playing the demo

408
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm not cool like you

409
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You can get all these early games

410
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
In the know or whatever

411
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I was playing the split second demo myself

412
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It was as fun as I remember at E3

413
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It was still the same game

414
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
That was probably

415
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Funny enough probably my game of show

416
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Last E3

417
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Last E3 was not a huge year for me

418
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But that was probably the best thing I played at the show

419
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
So I'm excited that game is finally coming out

420
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Like Tuesday right?

421
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And I'm looking forward to

422
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm going to try some of the multiplayer in Red Dead

423
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
When it does come out

424
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Because they do have a lot of neat multiplayer options in there

425
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But at the same time I'm also working on

426
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Doing another edited

427
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Modded Grand Theft Auto game

428
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I have some maps now

429
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But there's specific rules you have to follow

430
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
As far as getting stuff to work

431
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And stuff that normally works on the PC version

432
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Doesn't work on the console version or whatnot

433
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But um

434
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Oh yeah

435
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I got to play some of the listeners

436
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
During this week's

437
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Grand Theft Auto games

438
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Oh finally some listeners took you up on the challenge

439
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
That was fun

440
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And then of course

441
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
More Grand Theft Auto

442
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I think that's really

443
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Did you school the listeners?

444
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Or did they school you?

445
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I school them, I school everybody I play

446
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And so humble

447
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Well the only times I lose

448
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It seems lately is when I get

449
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Cocky and just start messing around

450
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And then I get to the point where

451
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
They get too close and one of them gets lucky

452
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Killing and I'm unable

453
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
To make it across the map to kill somebody

454
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So I don't do that anymore

455
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But no

456
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm actually like ranked

457
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
67 now so I'm

458
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Going up there trying to

459
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Make as close to number one as possible

460
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Moving on up, moving on up

461
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Alright congratulations

462
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Hey this is episode 367

463
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Of OLR and you're number 67 on Grand Theft Auto

464
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Hey how about that

465
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And I did pick up 3D.GameHeroes

466
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
But I haven't played

467
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Then we'll move to my gaming week

468
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Because I did play 3D.GameHeroes

469
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I picked that up as well and you know I was kind of

470
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Motivated by the price point of just $40

471
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It kind of seemed like a bargain to me

472
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So I decided to pick up the game and I didn't know much about the game

473
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Okay here's how clueless I was about the game

474
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I thought it was kind of like a game editor

475
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Type of game where you would get to make your own little

476
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Adventure games

477
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
No that's not what it is so

478
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Let's take a step back and talk about what

479
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
3D.GameHeroes actually is

480
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's basically a gigantic rip off

481
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Of The Legend of Zelda

482
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
But that's cool you know like

483
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
The Legend of Zelda was a great game

484
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's kind of fascinating that they're getting

485
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Away with it but hey if Nintendo

486
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Is not going to do anything why not

487
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Now you know when I say rip off

488
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
There's some clear parity going on here

489
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
They've changed just enough

490
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So it's not really a rip off of Zelda like for example

491
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You don't have hearts

492
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You have apples

493
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What is he called? Kidneys

494
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That'd be funny

495
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
That's I guess maybe the core

496
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Part of the customization of 3D.GameHeroes

497
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Is that your hero can be anything you want

498
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You actually have a mode where you can

499
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Go in and edit

500
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
The default guy I guess you could say like

501
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
The person in slot number one in the character edit

502
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Mode looks like the dude from Dragon Warrior

503
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So I don't

504
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Know what you're supposed to like I'm 12

505
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So I give all my characters like 3 year old

506
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Names I name my character vulva

507
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
So I don't know what the normal

508
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Character name is shut up

509
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Alan and I picked

510
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Out a good name

511
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Save us vulva

512
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Save us from the evil empire

513
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So

514
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah I don't remember what his name is

515
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Usually

516
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Somebody in chat will probably yell it out

517
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But whatever it doesn't matter what his name is

518
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
The game

519
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
The game is like this giant love letter

520
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
From guys our age but in Japan

521
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Because I know it was developed over there

522
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Who kind of miss what gaming used to be

523
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I mean if you think about the concept

524
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Of this game

525
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
The story is that there's this

526
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Where everybody stopped visiting

527
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It and it got old because

528
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You know just people didn't care about

529
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It anymore so their big idea was

530
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
To go 3D to change

531
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
The world I mean that

532
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
There's kind of like this really

533
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Hidden bitter subtext there about how

534
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Everything is 3D in this day and age

535
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And why can't our games be 2D anymore

536
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So and it's just loaded

537
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
With references to old 8-bit games

538
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Mostly Zelda but there's other stuff

539
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
In there as well that's really funny

540
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Including more current games

541
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Because from software the developer

542
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
They made this other great Playstation 3

543
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Game that came out a little while ago

544
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Called Demon Souls and there's

545
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Actually this room in the game where

546
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
If you walk in the right spot

547
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It says there's a message on the ground

548
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Here something like that it says

549
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Do you want to recommend this message?

550
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Yes it says somewhere someone got healed

551
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
That's funny if you've played

552
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Demon Souls if you haven't

553
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It makes no fucking sense you're just like

554
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
What is this randomness but

555
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Whatever but then there's a chick right next

556
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
To it and you find white sticky stuff in front of her

557
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Which is also a Demon Souls reference

558
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But it sounds like

559
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Porno which is really funny

560
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Because there's a lot of parts in this game

561
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
That really push the envelope

562
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Of an E10 rating but it's funny

563
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Like there's a whore

564
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
In the game you pay her to

565
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Do the fruit fruit with you or whatever they call it

566
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And the fufu

567
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I don't know what it is and that's

568
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You do the fufu

569
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
But then you wake up and it's her dad

570
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I kid you not

571
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I kid you not spoiler

572
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So anyway

573
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You know what

574
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's 40 bucks

575
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
The game has flaws yes it has

576
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Flaws there's slow down

577
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
In some of the dungeons because the water

578
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Effect that they do in the game is so

579
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Over the top and there's a lot in this

580
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Game that's really over the top like

581
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I don't know the size of your sword

582
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
When you have a full health bar like takes up

583
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
The entire screen

584
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
As long as you don't get it

585
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I was making all kinds of inappropriate jokes

586
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Yeah

587
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's funny it's really over the top there's a lot

588
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
That's very over the top about this game

589
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And they decide for whatever reason

590
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
To do the water effects really over the top

591
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And it causes

592
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Slow down in one of the dungeons

593
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And it's like okay folks

594
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
This is the PlayStation

595
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
3

596
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
The government bought PlayStation 3

597
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Where's your cell processor now

598
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Exactly

599
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It's like this game

600
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And to be honest there's really nothing

601
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
About 3D Dot Game Heroes

602
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That deserves to be on the PlayStation 3

603
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
This game could have been on the PS2

604
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I mean yes it has trophies

605
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And yes it's widescreen but

606
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I think there were a handful of widescreen

607
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Games on the PS2 as well and

608
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
That's really it

609
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I mean graphically

610
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You're not getting that much more oomph

611
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
On the PS3

612
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
But I'm okay with it and they give it a pass

613
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Because again you're charging me

614
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
About the cost of a PS2 game

615
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You know 40 bucks

616
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And it's you know still a good time

617
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And at the end you just have to evaluate

618
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Did I have fun yes or no

619
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And I had fun playing the game

620
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Despite it's flaws

621
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
So I wouldn't give the game like an A++

622
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
But I'd give it a good like solid

623
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It's silly

624
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Especially if you're a gamer in that age bracket

625
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Late 20's early 30's

626
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Or even if you're a younger gamer

627
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
That knows your retro gaming history

628
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Then you're gonna get a kick out of this

629
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And get some lols

630
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And I don't think it made our

631
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Show roll but

632
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
They have some really cool custom characters

633
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You can download off of their

634
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
The 3D Dot Game Heroes Hall of Heroes

635
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Website

636
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Including they have a little arcade game you can play as

637
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Little girl Cthulhu

638
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Um

639
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Chickens

640
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Well yeah one of the default characters in the game

641
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Is Santa Claus so I mean that's funny

642
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You're Santa Claus going around with a giant sword

643
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Ha ha

644
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
The only kind of weak thing

645
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I guess is that that's where the

646
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Customization kind of ends

647
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And I guess maybe with LittleBigPlanet

648
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Being the big thing on PS3 I was hoping

649
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
For a little more

650
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I don't know maybe I'm just being greedy

651
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I thought there was gonna be a little more to customize here

652
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Maybe in the sequel

653
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And I hope there is a sequel

654
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You know what

655
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Something just occurred to me that I should do

656
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I need to get RPG Maker for PC

657
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You should

658
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And do Orange Dodge Radio

659
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
The RPG

660
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Is that gonna be your little project while you don't have school?

661
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You should do that it'd be fun

662
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Well I've got clients that I'm working for but

663
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You know what I'm gonna leave it now

664
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Whoever's in the chat room who wants to work with me on this

665
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Or three years ago or three maybe

666
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I know that Dark Dead 2 was working on something at one time

667
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
No somebody did like a text adventure

668
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Yeah we had a text adventure

669
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
It was really funny

670
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I don't even know where I can get a copy of that anymore

671
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I got it somewhere

672
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
If I can find it I'll share it

673
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Yeah I

674
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Again you know

675
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I'm nitpicking a little bit with 3D.GameHeroes

676
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Overall if you wanna play

677
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Like if you're sitting there going

678
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Gosh I wish they would make another 2D Zelda game

679
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
That I could like play on my TV

680
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Here you go

681
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
This game was like made for you

682
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Enjoy. Eat it up. Get a big spoon

683
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
They have like a little big

684
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Planet Sackboy type thing

685
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
In there called Ragdoll

686
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
It's one of the custom characters that someone made

687
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Looks just like a little pixelated

688
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It's just kind of a bummer that that's like

689
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
The hero is like the only thing you can change

690
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
You know what I mean?

691
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Weren't you kind of hoping there would be like a little more

692
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Just a little more customizability to this

693
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Oh well

694
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
But you know what? 40 bucks. Hard to complain

695
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
SirDuckTape. Yes someone made a roll of duct tape

696
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Alright look other games in my gaming week

697
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I don't wanna drag this out too long

698
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Cause we're already almost a half hour into the show

699
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And haven't even touched gaming news yet

700
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
But I just wanted to say really quick some of the stuff I've been playing

701
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
World of Warcraft of course cause I'm addicted

702
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And play some Game Room this week

703
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Cause you know they're back on the ball

704
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
With getting the releases out so hooray for that

705
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I think I talked on the show last week about Pitfall

706
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And nearly missing the top 20 right?

707
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I tried to do like a perfect run of the game

708
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And you know what gets me in Pitfall

709
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And why I can't do it?

710
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It's the scorpions and the hidden passage

711
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Like I have no problem

712
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
If I just run

713
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Straight from right to left or run to the left

714
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I can like get through 20 minutes

715
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Running straight and not die once

716
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
And that's how I got like a score of like 85,000

717
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
But the minute I have to go into the tunnels

718
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
The scorpions eat my face

719
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Like that's the problem I'm having on old school Pitfall

720
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
But there were also some new games this week

721
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And one of them was Oink and I bought that game

722
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And you've probably heard me talk about this game before

723
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Because it was out on the 2600

724
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And I don't think people really know this game

725
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
It was an Activision game kind of based on the story

726
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Of the three little pigs and I think the best

727
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Way I've heard it described anywhere

728
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It's a reverse breakout

729
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
There's a wolf that's trying to blast the bricks

730
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And you're trying to put the bricks back in place

731
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Before he can blast through them to get you

732
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And Oink is out on Game Room this week

733
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And so I was spending some time playing this

734
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And I just saw this before the show tonight

735
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Bobby, the gentleman who does the show before us

736
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
On all games, the Bobby Blackwell show

737
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Actually put a tweet out there on his tweeter

738
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And he put, why pay $3 for Sky's favorite 2600 game?

739
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Actually I wouldn't say it's my favorite 2600 game

740
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
But it's, I think maybe like Kaboom or Pitfall 2 would be my favorite 2600 game

741
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
But it's my most underrated

742
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And I think most underappreciated 2600 game

743
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
When I can get the cartridge for $1

744
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Buy it on Game Room, I'll probably buy it on Game Room anyway

745
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And sure enough he sends a picture of Oink

746
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Running on his TV with the Atari 2600 hooked up

747
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I think that's a lot of people's chief complaint

748
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
About Game Room and I get that

749
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I get that complaint

750
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Although do keep in mind it's pretty awesome

751
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
With Oink when you go like

752
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Gosh the best score I can get in this game is 1800

753
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And this game is really hard

754
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
How do these people get like scores of 5000 and stuff?

755
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Oh I can go up, fire up their replay and look at it

756
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I mean those are like features you can't get in a dollar

757
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Cartridge and leaderboards and challenges

758
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And some of this other stuff

759
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
You know, does it justify the increased cost?

760
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I don't know, it really depends on how much these games

761
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Mean to you and so forth

762
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
There's a lot, yeah and I already did my Game Room

763
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Tangent a couple weeks ago

764
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I'm trying very hard not to repeat it

765
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
There's a lot of potential with Microsoft Game Room

766
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And I really hope that potential is realized

767
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm hoping E3 is gonna drop a Whopper on us

768
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I really want them to come out at that press conference

769
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
At E3 and go

770
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
We're gonna release a Whopper of a game

771
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
On Game Room this week and it's out

772
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Right now, go get it

773
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And so I don't know what that game is

774
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
But hopefully something really cool

775
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Like something not from the early early 80s

776
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Like something

777
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I don't know, I don't know what game that could be

778
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Galaxian 3

779
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I don't know what it'll be

780
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
But hopefully something they'll kind of put out

781
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And it'll take Game Room to that next level

782
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Where it's not just Atari 2600

783
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And old old old old old stuff from the 80s

784
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
We'll see though

785
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
My gut tells me

786
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Here's my bet

787
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Quote unquote

788
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
It's gonna be a Capcom game

789
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
From their like

790
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Street Fighter 2-ish era

791
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
When they were using that hardware

792
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So I'm gonna play

793
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
The CPS 1 and 2

794
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I'm gonna just

795
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
guesstimate with no

796
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Nothing to back this up whatsoever

797
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Cause there's already the rumors

798
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
That Capcom games are gonna make their way

799
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Like the Mega Man fighting game

800
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And some of that stuff is gonna make their way

801
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
To the Rock Battle

802
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Cause Capcom supported Ultra K

803
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
In the past

804
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
So there's no reason why they wouldn't jump in on this

805
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm gonna just speculate

806
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Original Street Fighter 1

807
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Street Fighter 1 will be the big

808
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
E3 Game Room release

809
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I have nothing to base that off of

810
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
But half fanboyism

811
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Half, I've been doing this show for long enough

812
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
That I feel like I start to understand the patterns

813
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
In some companies

814
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Take it or leave it

815
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
And also in Game Room this week

816
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Keystone Capers was released

817
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And I played a crap ton of that

818
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Alright, I'll stop talking about my gaming week now

819
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
We are officially a half hour into the show and haven't talked about

820
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I've been playing a lot of Super Street Fighter 2

821
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I got my ass handed to me in Super Street Fighter 4

822
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
This weekend

823
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I was playing and I got schooled

824
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And it just reminded me what a terrible

825
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Street Fighter player I am

826
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I was playing Super Street Fighter 2 on my

827
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Arcade cabinet

828
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
It was fun

829
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Go into our chat room

830
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I think some folks are speculating what the game could be

831
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
That's released at Game Room

832
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Or released at E3 for Game Room

833
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
SSJ100Matt speculates

834
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Oonga Boonga will be the game

835
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Dear Lord no

836
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
BlackWolf

837
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Our good pal Bobby BlackWolf says

838
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Miss Nude World USA

839
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Oh I wish

840
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
And BlackWolf also says

841
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Remember no online multiplayer

842
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
In Game Room so it doesn't make much sense

843
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
To do a fighting game

844
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Well to be fair sir, it really didn't make much sense

845
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
To put combat or outlaw there

846
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Either then for those same reasons

847
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I mean combat is

848
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Is pointless

849
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
If you don't have someone to play it with

850
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And yet you're supposed to invite someone over

851
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
They get on the second controller

852
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
So you could basically cheat for the high score on that one

853
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Donovan speculates

854
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Custer's Revenge will be the big game that's released

855
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
You know I just

856
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I just don't think that's going to happen

857
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
A few people in the chat talking about Kangaroo

858
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
ActDeft in chat says if Game Room releases

859
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Kangaroo I'll buy it on release

860
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I do want to warn you though

861
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
If they release Kongo Bongo

862
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Which I don't know, for some reason Kangaroo makes me think

863
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Of Donkey Kong which makes me think of Kongo Bongo

864
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Because they were all kind of

865
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Trying to one up each other

866
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Kongo Bongo is on the Sega Genesis

867
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Uber collection

868
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Be careful if Sega games start showing up

869
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
On Game Room because a lot of them

870
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Are on that collection

871
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Don't get swindled

872
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Alright let's move on to some

873
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Actual gaming news for heaven's sakes

874
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Housekeeping, join us on Twitter

875
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Twitter.com slash o-l-r, join us on Facebook

876
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Orange Lawns Radio, yada yada

877
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Blah blah blah gaming news, Loki

878
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
So Activision

879
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Apparently is taking some

880
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Lessons that they

881
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Possibly have learned from

882
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Lawsuits and what not

883
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
They are dropping celebrities from the next Guitar Hero

884
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Game so you will not see any

885
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
You know

886
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Dead Kurt Cobain's or whatever

887
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Singing

888
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Well to be fair, Kurt Cobain was not

889
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Portrayed as dead in the game because I think

890
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
If he was that would have been a whole other issue

891
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
That would have been a whole other issue

892
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
You just got he's on the stage

893
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
No head

894
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Zombie Kurt Cobain

895
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
So yeah, so they're basically

896
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Their claim is

897
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
They're going back to the basics

898
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
This is coming from the latest issue of the official

899
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Xbox Magazine

900
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Some of the old Guitar Hero

901
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Characters, the ones that were actually unique to

902
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
The game are coming back and you'll

903
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Be able to recruit

904
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Characters by playing their song sets

905
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And once you do that you can also

906
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Unlock their alter egos

907
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
So for example Lars would become

908
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Like warrior Lars

909
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And that will allow you to

910
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Get a

911
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Times six multiplier

912
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Quick play

913
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I guess is being revamped

914
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Of course

915
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
The DLC from

916
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Guitar Hero 5 and before that

917
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
It will be compatible with Guitar Hero 6

918
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
They're doing

919
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I guess streaker's momentum

920
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Do or die are now available in

921
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Online competitive modes

922
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
New power challenges

923
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Queen, kiss

924
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Black Sabbath, they're confirmed to be

925
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
In the game, I guess quest mode will

926
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Feature Gene Simmons as a narrator

927
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Because he needs money

928
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Does he have a

929
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
TV show, does he get money from that

930
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Well, he's freaking Gene Simmons

931
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
All he has to do is go in a freak show and

932
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Stick out his tongue, you know what though, he was on the Celebrity

933
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Apprentice and that's, you know

934
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
If you're resorting to going, Joan Rivers

935
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Was on the Celebrity Apprentice

936
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And that's Joan Rivers, her career's kind

937
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Of not gone

938
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Now she's got a movie coming out and all this stuff

939
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
A couple years ago

940
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
They claim there's going to be a bigger focus on rock and roll

941
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Right

942
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Focus on rock and roll

943
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Well I'm glad they're making a bigger focus

944
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
On rock and roll and not, I don't know

945
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Making money

946
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Why do I just have this feeling, like I'm not trying to be negative

947
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Or be a fanboy or whatever, but why do I just have

948
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
This feeling that in E3

949
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
We're going to see Rock Band 3 and it's just going to

950
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Blow this shit out of the water

951
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Like it's just going to annihilate Guitar Hero

952
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Let me play this way

953
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Um

954
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I don't really

955
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Give a crap about, I mean look at

956
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Look at Guitar Hero 5, what exactly did

957
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Guitar Hero 5 do that was that

958
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Great over Guitar Hero World Tour

959
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Nothing really

960
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I mean it was pretty much, hey look

961
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
We have new songs

962
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Yeah? Yeah?

963
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
How about we throw in

964
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Or throw in Van Halen

965
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Eh, two games to press one

966
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Is that the first game with the whole

967
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
You can do four singers if you want

968
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And four guitarists and all that stuff

969
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Wow that's awesome, we're going to put

970
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Four drummers in my house, yeah cause

971
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
That makes sense

972
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Um

973
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I don't know, it sounds dumb

974
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And this one doesn't sound that great to me

975
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
But you know what, I'm kind of biased because

976
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I don't really care for the Guitar Hero series really

977
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Once I had Rock Band 2 it was just like

978
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I don't really care

979
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You know I've got all these download songs

980
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
That I need to buy another game

981
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Rock Band 3, I'm going to kind of consider it

982
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
The same thing unless I see them doing

983
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Something really unique with it

984
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Although I do have faith in harmonics that they're

985
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Going to actually put something out decent

986
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
That's going to be

987
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Different enough from the last game

988
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
So, props to them for that

989
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
But, I mean look at like the Guitar Hero

990
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Um, their song creator

991
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
And stuff that they had in game, that was supposed to be

992
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Like this huge feature and everyone's kind of like

993
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Eh, whatever

994
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
You know, so

995
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
We'll see, I mean

996
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
We don't know a lot about it yet

997
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
But, I'm not expecting much

998
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Just like with DJ Hero 2

999
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm not expecting much

1000
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
New songs, that's about it

1001
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Which could be a good thing, because if you set the expectation bar really low

1002
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Then, you know, they have the potential to really

1003
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Overcome that, whereas I think the

1004
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Expectation bar with Rock Band 3

1005
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Is really high, at least for me

1006
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Like, I'm expecting this game to really blow me

1007
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Out of the water, because they've had a couple years

1008
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
To kind of perfect it now

1009
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
They didn't do a Rock Band game last year, you know what I mean

1010
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Well, okay, yeah, they had the Beatles

1011
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
But you saw the progression from Rock Band 2

1012
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
To the Beatles interface, so you're kind of

1013
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Yeah, and like, was this

1014
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
You know, the Green Day Rock Band stuff, I mean that's basically

1015
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Just Beatles being reskinned

1016
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
With Green Day stuff, and it's

1017
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
You know, it's basically like a track pack

1018
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
But there is a lot of songs in the game

1019
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And, you know, just like

1020
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Guitar Hero Metallica or Aerosmith

1021
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Or something like that, I really don't give a crap about

1022
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Green Day Rock Band

1023
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I guess even the same could have been said about Lego Rock Band

1024
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Yet I purchased it anyway

1025
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Although Lego Rock Band had a really good setlist

1026
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
So I did like that, but

1027
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
You know, I basically dumped the songs in the game

1028
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And then sold it back, so

1029
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Whatever

1030
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I don't know, it'll be

1031
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Interesting to see what happens

1032
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Hopefully we'll, you know, obviously we're gonna know more

1033
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
After E3

1034
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Alright, well let's move on talking about some other

1035
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Big, big news that landed this week

1036
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I just had everybody talking, and this is one of those things

1037
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
That I don't think is gonna be news to you guys

1038
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
But I wanna take some time out

1039
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
To talk about it and get folks' thoughts here in studio

1040
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And those of you in chat room, and that is

1041
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
EA's big announcement this week

1042
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
At what exactly they mean

1043
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
When they're talking about Project

1044
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
$10, and the deal is

1045
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
That Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11

1046
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Which is gonna be the first game that has this

1047
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Enabled, it's coming out June 8th

1048
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
So just a couple weeks here

1049
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
The EA Sports games for PS3 and

1050
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Xbox 360 will include a title

1051
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Specific online pass

1052
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
This will enable you to do

1053
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Online services, features, and bonus

1054
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Content, however if your code

1055
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Has already been redeemed, meaning

1056
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
You bought the game used, you

1057
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Got it on Gamefly, or borrowed

1058
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It from a friend, then you

1059
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Can get an additional online pass

1060
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
For $10

1061
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Of course you get a 7 day free

1062
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Trial, so I guess if you rent it from

1063
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Gamefly, you'll at least get that

1064
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It's gonna depend

1065
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
What it is, depending on the game you have

1066
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
But EA has mentioned that

1067
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
It will be, it could include

1068
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Meaning it probably will include

1069
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Basic online multiplayer

1070
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
That could also include group and league features

1071
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Roster and playbook updates

1072
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Downloads, of like

1073
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
The user based stuff

1074
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Tournament support, and so forth

1075
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
So that's the direction

1076
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
They're going in, where now if you

1077
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Get this game used, you're gonna have to pay an extra

1078
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
$10 if you're gonna want to enable it online

1079
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Not the first time

1080
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
We've really seen something like this

1081
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Ever happen

1082
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Right? Because you know, there's been

1083
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Other games that have charged

1084
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
You know, the

1085
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Money for extra stuff, you know

1086
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
If you wanna redeem the code, but it's interesting now

1087
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
That you're talking about what I think a lot

1088
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Of people have come to take for granted online

1089
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And that is basic, head to head

1090
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Online matches. Dark

1091
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Sakura, what do you think?

1092
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
About the whole

1093
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Project $10 thing, where you know

1094
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Folks are now having to pay

1095
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
$10 if they wanna play their sports

1096
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Game online

1097
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
That's

1098
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I understand

1099
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
The logic behind it

1100
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
What I think

1101
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
It's not really gonna

1102
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I think

1103
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
People expect for online play

1104
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Just to be a given, you know?

1105
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Yeah

1106
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
So yeah, it kinda sucks

1107
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
You feel like to some extent you're getting nickel and dimed

1108
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
But it's tough because

1109
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Like

1110
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Well at least if you buy the game new

1111
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
It's included, whatever

1112
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
So if you're buying the game new, nothing really changes for you

1113
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I guess the difficult part for me

1114
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Is that

1115
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I see the logic behind it

1116
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And it's hard for me to argue with it

1117
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Because yeah, game developers kinda lose a little money

1118
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
On the used market, this is a way for them to make it back

1119
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Whatever

1120
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
So

1121
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Is that I already pay for Xbox Live

1122
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
That's what I was about to say

1123
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
You know, you pay for these services already

1124
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
If they really

1125
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Wanted it to be

1126
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Something they could make more money on

1127
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
They should just have like

1128
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I don't know

1129
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
More download packs

1130
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
They're not losing any money

1131
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Either off of used sales

1132
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
If you think about it

1133
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
If I sell my game used to somebody

1134
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Out there that's, you know, floating around

1135
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
You know, it's not like

1136
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I copied my copy

1137
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And now there's two people playing

1138
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
A game that you paid for once

1139
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
It's just still one person playing

1140
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
And so it is kind of

1141
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
A dick move to do this

1142
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And you know what, the fact that they haven't dropped the price of their game

1143
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
You know, it's still

1144
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Kinda messed up

1145
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
What's even dumber, the whole thing

1146
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Was that GameStop was actually quoted

1147
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
They were like, yeah we think this is a great idea

1148
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
The quote you're thinking of

1149
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
CEO Dan DeMatteo

1150
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I think says this

1151
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
GameStop is excited to partner with such a

1152
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Forward thinking publisher as Electronic Arts

1153
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
This relationship allows us to

1154
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Capitalize on our investments

1155
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
To market and sell downloadable content

1156
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Online as well as through our

1157
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Network of stores worldwide

1158
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Are you kissing or sucking over there?

1159
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Here's the thing I think

1160
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Is because they're probably

1161
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Getting other back end deals for this stuff

1162
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Like for example, if you look at Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11

1163
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
On GameStop's website

1164
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
You get a $10 off future order

1165
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
When you purchase Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11

1166
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
The $10 coupon code

1167
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Will be emailed

1168
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
When the order ships

1169
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So basically they're getting some sort of kickback money

1170
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
That they're passing out to their customers to make it more

1171
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Appealing to them to buy the new game

1172
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Well yeah

1173
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And I want to say this too

1174
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
DarkTetsuya in our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com says

1175
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
So then the game itself will only cost

1176
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
$59.99 new, right EA?

1177
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Right? No

1178
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It's still going to cost $59.99

1179
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Or let's just say $60

1180
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Because unless you live in Oregon or one of those other states with no sales tax

1181
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
You're going to pay $60 plus for it

1182
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
The thing to keep in mind though

1183
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
This won't affect you if you're buying your games new

1184
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Because you get your free code

1185
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
With the game and you know since it's new

1186
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
That no one's used it, etc, etc

1187
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
So you know that you're good

1188
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
That means

1189
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Isn't GameStop going to have to alter their policy now

1190
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
That they're not going to take returns on these games anymore?

1191
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
No they will take the returns on the games

1192
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
It's just like you know

1193
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Download content that would be coming with the game

1194
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
You know they do this a lot now

1195
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Where they're bundling in some DLC

1196
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Like a coupon or something like that for

1197
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
You know the first piece of DLC for free

1198
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Or like some in-game hat or something like that

1199
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
That you get for free

1200
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Just to entice people to buy new games

1201
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
But the thing for me

1202
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
And you know I don't know

1203
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Because I don't play sports games a lot

1204
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
You know I wouldn't care

1205
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
For me if I were to buy Tiger Woods

1206
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
You know I wouldn't care

1207
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
That I couldn't play online

1208
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I wouldn't buy Tiger Woods

1209
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Well that too yeah

1210
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
The only thing that bothers me about this

1211
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Yeah I don't play a lot of these sports games

1212
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Either so there's a lot of me that goes

1213
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Nah nah nah doesn't affect me

1214
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
But I do worry about the precedent

1215
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
This is going to set for the future

1216
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Because EA does make other games I do play

1217
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
And granted I buy most of my games

1218
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Used or I mean sorry new

1219
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
So a lot of this won't affect me anyway

1220
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I do use Gamefly a little bit

1221
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
But probably these are not the type of games

1222
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I would be getting

1223
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I worry about the precedent it sets

1224
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And the part that kind of irritates me

1225
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Is that I feel like I'm being double dipped

1226
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I'm paying for Xbox Live

1227
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And now you want me to pay for this as well

1228
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
If it's used that I have a problem with

1229
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
It's weird like I will admit

1230
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I am weird this is weird

1231
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I don't have a problem with it on PlayStation

1232
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
It's free there's not a lot for me to complain

1233
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
About there you can't say like

1234
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Oh well you know it's wrong for them

1235
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
To charge you to use their servers and all

1236
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
That stuff when

1237
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
You know you're not really paying anything for

1238
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
It in the first place and if you want to use these features

1239
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Then you know I get it but I thought

1240
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
That's what I was already paying for on Xbox Live

1241
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I understand that EA

1242
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Uses their own servers and I understand

1243
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
That it's kind of separate like that

1244
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
But then does that mean that the restriction

1245
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Will be removed where I no longer need an

1246
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Xbox Live Gold account to play these online

1247
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
If that's the case

1248
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Then okay I guess

1249
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
That it's the same as the PlayStation

1250
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
And I can't really argue but otherwise I feel

1251
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Like I'm being charged twice

1252
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Do you seriously think that Microsoft is gonna

1253
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Let an online service go without

1254
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Going through Xbox Live?

1255
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Yes Final Fantasy 11

1256
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
That is different I think

1257
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
When you're dealing with Square

1258
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Well this is EA

1259
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Okay well here's the thing

1260
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I don't think that EA is in

1261
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Squares

1262
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
They made the exception because Final Fantasy 11

1263
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Was built to be on the PS2

1264
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
And Microsoft wanted a piece of that

1265
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
They wanted it they thought it was gonna be

1266
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Probably the bigger thing than it really ended up being

1267
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
What have you so they made an exception

1268
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
But it just goes to show an exception

1269
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Can be made

1270
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
But I think that also

1271
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
It was the fact that

1272
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
They would be getting something that no one

1273
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Would have ever expected to be on one of their systems

1274
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
So

1275
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
That was I think to get

1276
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Really to get into the market share

1277
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
They're going to get EA games

1278
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Anyway

1279
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
EA would be completely

1280
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Just butt-tarded

1281
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
To not put out a game on

1282
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Xbox 360 I mean

1283
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
There's it They're doing a lot of stuff

1284
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
In this project $10 they have the way

1285
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
That they changed the DLC the way

1286
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
They kind of give it to you

1287
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
In Mass Effect 2

1288
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
You know this is not the first company

1289
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
To try this they did the same thing with

1290
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
SOCOM on the PSP to try to

1291
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
You know

1292
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Curtail people buying the used game

1293
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
But

1294
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
My problem is

1295
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Basically like GameStop

1296
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
You know their money is made and used product

1297
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And

1298
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
They've been ballsy enough

1299
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Before to make you know publishers

1300
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Pay for shelf space and stuff like that

1301
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Why can't they be ballsy now they go

1302
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
We think this is a stupid idea

1303
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
What's EA going to do

1304
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Oh we're going to stop selling our games to your stores

1305
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
They're not going to take a cut that big

1306
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I mean they may try to

1307
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Make that bluff

1308
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
But I mean if you call them on it they're not going to do anything

1309
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
And even if they did

1310
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
You know what I've seen Blockbuster

1311
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Blockbuster or Movie Gallery or somebody

1312
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
You know they stopped carrying

1313
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
A certain vendor's

1314
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Product for quite a while

1315
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And just basically saying

1316
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Well if you don't want to play by our rules

1317
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Then we're just going to stop carrying your product

1318
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And it hit them big time and they ended up

1319
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Kind of settling with them

1320
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Okay let me go check because there's lots and lots

1321
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And lots of chatty chat comments I want to read here

1322
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
And most of it's coming from Bobby

1323
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
He definitely has a lot to say on this

1324
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
BobbyBlackWolf in chat

1325
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
You're ripped off if you buy the game used for $55

1326
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Then you'd have to pay $65

1327
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
To get the game plus online

1328
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
But buying the game used for $40

1329
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And buying the $10 online is still

1330
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
More than buying the game new

1331
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
And EA still gets a tiny bit of money

1332
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
So you win, you got a cheaper game

1333
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
EA wins, they get money to pay their SysAdmins

1334
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
And GameStop wins because you bought a used game from them

1335
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Okay I want to stop there because

1336
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I get what you're saying

1337
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And I'm like 95% with you

1338
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
But the soccer moms

1339
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Buying the games for these kids

1340
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Lose because they don't understand

1341
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
That there's a hidden $10 fee that's going to come with this

1342
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And you know what else

1343
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Sucks too?

1344
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
EA, they shut down their servers after some time

1345
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
So you paid for the money

1346
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
You paid the extra money to play this game online

1347
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
And then it's not there

1348
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
If all of that is disclosed in the agreement

1349
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I'm borderline comfortable with it

1350
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
And then

1351
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
There's kind of like a little bit of back and forth

1352
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Between BlackWolf and ToaGak

1353
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
And some stuff here

1354
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
BlackWolf says Phantasy Star Online also doesn't

1355
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Require a gold subscription

1356
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Any game that has it's own monthly fee

1357
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Does not require the Xbox Live gold

1358
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
And ToaGak was trying to recall

1359
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
A game that required them both

1360
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Couldn't think of one and Bobby says

1361
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Oh you can't remember haha

1362
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Well this $10 is not a monthly fee though

1363
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
It's just a one time fee

1364
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
To do the game for the duration

1365
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
And you do get the 70 trials

1366
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
So you can try it out

1367
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
If the online is really not something that you care for

1368
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Then you don't have to do it

1369
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
The other thing I was thinking of

1370
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
And I'm sure that they've thought of this

1371
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
And they don't have SystemLink in the game anymore

1372
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
You can use tunneling services

1373
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
To actually play online with other people

1374
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
So you can use that

1375
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
It basically acts like

1376
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
It's a SystemLink game but you're playing it over

1377
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
The internet like you did with the GameCube

1378
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
And stuff like that with Mario Kart

1379
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Again, I don't know

1380
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I'm just a little worried like

1381
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
What happens next

1382
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Like if this ends up being acceptable

1383
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Then what happens next

1384
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
You know

1385
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
They get you for $10 here

1386
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
And you know, I don't know

1387
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
They're not losing money left and right either

1388
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I mean this kind of stuff

1389
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
And it's an experiment for them

1390
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
They're just saying, huh, what can we get away with

1391
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
It's just like the $15 map packs

1392
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
For Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2

1393
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
What can we get away with

1394
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
$15, let's see if people buy this

1395
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Oh, people are buying this like crazy

1396
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Let's release another map pack for $15

1397
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I mean it's just

1398
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
If people are going to buy this stuff left and right

1399
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And just not even think about it

1400
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
There's going to be a lot of people that decide

1401
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Hey, we're going to buy this game used

1402
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Better off if you really want to get this game cheaper

1403
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Don't buy it used

1404
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Just wait for the drop in price and buy it new

1405
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
And I guess

1406
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
The moral of the story, if you will

1407
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Is so we can kind of move on with some other news

1408
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
If you don't like it, don't buy it

1409
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Don't say you're going to

1410
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Don't be one of those left for dead

1411
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Two petitioners

1412
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
That sign the petition against the game

1413
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
And then are caught on Steam playing the game

1414
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
The day it comes out

1415
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
If you are really against this

1416
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Don't buy it and mean it

1417
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
How about

1418
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Something a little bit more

1419
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Possibly encouraging

1420
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Or maybe face palming

1421
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Maybe a little bit

1422
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Walmart

1423
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Actually is

1424
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Going to be back in the

1425
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Used game

1426
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Business

1427
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
They're going to be working with Game Trade

1428
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
A startup services provider

1429
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
With a lease to test

1430
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Their little game trade stores

1431
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
In different Walmart places

1432
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
There's only about five of them

1433
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
But it's going to be previously owned games

1434
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Movies

1435
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Hardware

1436
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Basically you get store credit or cash

1437
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
So yeah

1438
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
They're going to be

1439
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I guess what GameStop was

1440
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
For used games

1441
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Only Walmart

1442
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Well they didn't really get out of

1443
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
The used game market

1444
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
The company going under that was doing their kiosk

1445
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Kind of

1446
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
They didn't have a choice

1447
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
So they're kind of trying the same thing again

1448
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I don't think they launched it full

1449
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Steam

1450
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
While that company was working with them

1451
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
DVD Play

1452
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I don't remember ever seeing used games at Walmart

1453
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
They were in test locations

1454
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Test locations of a new company

1455
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
E-Play is what it was

1456
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
They were doing it with Best Buy

1457
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
And they went out of business

1458
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
So now this new company

1459
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Coming out trying to do the same thing

1460
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
We'll see what happens there

1461
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
It's a tough market to compete in

1462
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
But granted

1463
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Used games, there's not a lot of kiosks

1464
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Out there for that stuff

1465
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
It could catch on

1466
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
It might be neat

1467
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I just worry about those things

1468
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
There's too many ways to exploit them

1469
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I don't know

1470
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
With competitions dwindling

1471
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
It's nice to see

1472
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I guess GameStop is going to have a little competitor

1473
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Because competition is good

1474
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Especially when news like this comes out

1475
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
And there might be a $10 hidden surcharge

1476
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
On your used games

1477
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
It's nice that

1478
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
There's going to be a little competition there

1479
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
But I just don't think I like that

1480
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
That competition is Walmart

1481
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Well, I mean

1482
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Walmart does everything else

1483
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Do we really need them in this too?

1484
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
You know, money gets tight

1485
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And you need to buy dinner

1486
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
You can always trade in your game

1487
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
And buy dinner with the coupon

1488
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Or the store credit that you get

1489
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
That's always good

1490
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Hard to argue with that, okay

1491
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
At least there's that option

1492
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
But as far as

1493
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
As far as trading in stuff

1494
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I don't know

1495
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Really what they need

1496
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Out there is a website

1497
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
And this would be pretty impossible to get

1498
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
GameStop to be sharing what their trading prices are

1499
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
But if there was a website to

1500
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Compare trading prices based on

1501
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Title per these different places

1502
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
That would be kind of cool

1503
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
But once again, they're not going to give that information out

1504
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
No, I don't think they're going to give that out either

1505
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
You know, and

1506
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
The other kind of little worry I have

1507
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Is that there's going to be a lot of Walmart employees

1508
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
That are going to get taken advantage of

1509
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Because, you know, one thing about GameStop

1510
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Is that most, and it really depends on

1511
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Which one you're going to, but most of them

1512
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Are going to hire people that are at least somewhat game savvy

1513
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Again, depends on the store

1514
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
But I would worry that a place like Walmart

1515
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Isn't going to really care

1516
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
And there's going to be a lot of people to get taken advantage of

1517
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
And buy back games that are

1518
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
All scratchy

1519
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Yucky and codes are used

1520
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Here's the problem though, Rob, with that

1521
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
It's a kiosk

1522
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
It's a machine

1523
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
How does the machine know what games are in good condition and what aren't

1524
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
It tries to read them

1525
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
It reads this

1526
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
It checks them

1527
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
To see if they're able to be read

1528
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
The problem is, though

1529
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
You could trick the machine by using

1530
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Some sort of burn disk or something like that

1531
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
And it might help you

1532
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Tell the difference between it

1533
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Of course, then you have your credit card

1534
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
But, once again, it's also easy

1535
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
To buy a, you know

1536
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
A prepaid credit card

1537
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
And you can do the same thing

1538
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Put whatever, you know, person's name

1539
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Social on there that you want

1540
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
And do it and you can get away with the money

1541
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
You should be telling people how to do this on the show

1542
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I'm just saying, hey, I think, you know

1543
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I work out the flaws

1544
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
If you thought of it, somebody a little more shady

1545
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Has definitely already thought of it

1546
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
So, it, I mean, but

1547
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Then again, not everybody's thinking that way

1548
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
So, you could probably

1549
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Factor that in

1550
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
But, um

1551
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
It'll be interesting to see

1552
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Hey, who thought, you know, renting DVDs from a kiosk

1553
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Was going to take off

1554
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Not a lot of people did

1555
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Still not going to make me stop shopping at Target

1556
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Over Walmart

1557
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
But, hey, you know what, though

1558
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
If it takes off at Walmart, who says that Target's not going to do it

1559
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And, you know, if this company is anything like

1560
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
ePlay was, they could easily have

1561
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
The same damn kiosk

1562
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
It just, you know, branded with the Target stuff

1563
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
And it would be the same service right there

1564
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
And they could double dip, basically, in the market

1565
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And there's nothing really stopping them from doing that

1566
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Unless they sign some sort of weird contract for it

1567
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Which they very well might have

1568
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Very true

1569
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
We'll see what happens

1570
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Um, so there's some rumors now regarding

1571
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
When, uh, the PlayStation Move

1572
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
And Natal's going to be launched

1573
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Um, the rumor is that

1574
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
PlayStation Move is supposed to launch in September

1575
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
This is coming from Jason Bradbury

1576
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
The host of Britain's

1577
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
The Gadget Show

1578
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Apparently, he's proclaiming

1579
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
That the PlayStation Move controller

1580
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Will take, uh, be released

1581
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
In September

1582
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
On his Twitter account

1583
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Another thing I was meaning to say

1584
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
September for PlayStation Move, I'm sure of it

1585
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Can't say why, just September 2010

1586
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I

1587
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Well, I mean, if I was a betting man

1588
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
That's a pretty good bet

1589
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
It's gonna be this fall, okay

1590
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
You know it's fall

1591
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
And you know it's before Black Friday

1592
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
It must, must, must be before Black Friday

1593
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
So what does that really leave?

1594
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,000
October, November, and maybe September

1595
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Here's how you know when

1596
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Uh, the PlayStation Move is scheduled

1597
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
To come out, is you look at the titles that are

1598
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Supporting the PlayStation Move and where they're

1599
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Sitting as far as releases go

1600
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
And everything that I've seen so far is pointing

1601
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
To November, which makes sense because that's when

1602
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
They seem to launch new consoles and whatnot

1603
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Um, so I would be betting

1604
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
November

1605
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
So, we'll see

1606
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
So you are going to go against the British guy

1607
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
From Gadgets or whatever

1608
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I don't know who the fuck Jason Bradbury is

1609
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
From the Gadgets show

1610
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Good for you, you think something

1611
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I think you should challenge Jason Bradbury

1612
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
To a throwdown

1613
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
A throwdown?

1614
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
A hoedown throwdown

1615
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Whatever, I could be like Michael Patcher

1616
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
And say random shit, and if I'm right

1617
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I'm a genius, if I'm wrong, no one will remember

1618
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
So, whatever

1619
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I'm an analyst!

1620
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
We should just start calling you an analyst

1621
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
We need to have a segment on the show, analyst Loki

1622
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
No, but I'm serious

1623
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Wait

1624
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I'm serious though, like look at

1625
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Look at IPET

1626
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
IPET is supporting the Playstation move

1627
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
And that's supposed to be coming out in the fall

1628
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Lord of the Rings, Eragon's Quest

1629
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Whatever is supposed to be coming out in the fall

1630
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
As well, because that's now supporting

1631
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
The move on the Playstation 3

1632
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Um

1633
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
LittleBigPlanet 2 will probably be coming out

1634
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Like this fall, I'm guessing

1635
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
It's all going to be around the same time

1636
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Um

1637
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I just, I don't know about September

1638
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I guess it could be September

1639
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
If you think about it, because

1640
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
They are starting to support games now

1641
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
With the Playstation move stuff

1642
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
So, you know, publishers have access to it

1643
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And I guess they could do that

1644
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
But I would be more willing to bet it's going to be

1645
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Closer to Christmas

1646
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Just to catch in on that holiday buying madness

1647
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
You know, we'll see

1648
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Now see, where's that story going to be on all the

1649
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Game blogs tomorrow, that

1650
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
World renowned, years long

1651
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Running, game analist, Loki

1652
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Has predicted on

1653
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Some little

1654
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Crappy web show

1655
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Just like this other thing

1656
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
The gadget show or whatever

1657
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
That move is coming out in November

1658
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
He is sure of it, folks

1659
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
He is sure of it

1660
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Let me just put it this way, okay

1661
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
This goes, you know, both against me and against him

1662
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Just because we're hosts of a show

1663
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Doesn't mean we know what we're talking about

1664
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I mean, so, you know

1665
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Just because he hosts a TV show

1666
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Does not mean he knows exactly when

1667
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
The Playstation move is coming out

1668
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
It's a good guess, fourth quarter, duh

1669
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
It's going to be coming out fourth quarter, so

1670
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Whenever that is, if it's September, great

1671
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
It'll be nice and early

1672
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
But, you know, from what I've seen

1673
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Their major Sony releases

1674
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Have either been in November or October

1675
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
October like last year, for example

1676
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Because he had Uncharted 2

1677
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Um

1678
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
God, there was other Sony titles last year

1679
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
But LittleBigPlanet was also

1680
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
In October as well

1681
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Although Resistance 2, I believe

1682
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Was in

1683
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
November, so

1684
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
It's all around that same time

1685
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
They have release schedules

1686
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
What about Natal, then?

1687
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Okay, Project Natal

1688
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
What does our analysts think about Project Natal?

1689
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
They're saying that it's going to be releasing

1690
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
In October

1691
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
This is according to

1692
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Microsoft's

1693
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Saudi vendor

1694
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
He's not even really working for

1695
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Microsoft

1696
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Although they

1697
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Quote him as working with Microsoft

1698
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Apparently G4 has said that

1699
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Said Bilal

1700
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Tariq

1701
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
There's a source you can trust

1702
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Is not a Microsoft employee

1703
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
He is a vendor employed through a

1704
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Third party company on behalf of Microsoft

1705
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
A subsidiary in

1706
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Saudi Arabia

1707
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
And uh

1708
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Pardon me, pardon me. Can I do just a quick

1709
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
This is a very important poll

1710
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
We need to do in

1711
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Chat, okay? And I realize

1712
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Our audience is biased

1713
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
But I still think this is a question worth asking

1714
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
So quick poll in chat

1715
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Who do you trust more?

1716
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
G4

1717
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Or

1718
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Analist Loki

1719
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Or Loki

1720
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Ready go

1721
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Well I agree, I don't think he's an employee

1722
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
They're just saying

1723
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
That they're reporting that he's not an employee

1724
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Okay, but he was the one

1725
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Apparently that was saying that

1726
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
We will be in position to confirm the day after

1727
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
E3, which is in June

1728
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
But definitely it's going to be October 2010

1729
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
And we will have it in Saudi Arabia

1730
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
For sure

1731
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
I don't think it's going to be definitely in

1732
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
October

1733
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
And once again it's because all the major

1734
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Stuff that's been released

1735
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Is usually around that November time

1736
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Now granted they could do

1737
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
The fall update early, it's going to be

1738
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Timed with the fall update basically

1739
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
You're going to have the fall update slightly

1740
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Before

1741
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
This is launched, just like

1742
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
When they did the avatars, the new

1743
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Xbox experience, whatever

1744
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
They had

1745
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Their new scenic game come out slightly

1746
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Before

1747
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
This new update came out

1748
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
So you kind of look at what the games are

1749
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
What games are supporting Natal and stuff

1750
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
And what their release schedule is going to be like

1751
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
And you can kind of guess when

1752
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Natal is going to come out

1753
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
And if at E3

1754
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
They're going to be showing off Gears of War 3

1755
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Which obviously is not coming out until next year I guess

1756
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
But maybe another

1757
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Fourth quarter title is going to be really big

1758
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I'm guessing it's going to be

1759
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Around the November timeframe

1760
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
September would be too early

1761
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
I mean they're saying in October

1762
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
So the end of October would sound

1763
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Right

1764
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Let's go to the results of our quick poll chat

1765
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
And our chatroom, chat.ornsonshooter.com

1766
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Who do you trust more, G4 or Loki?

1767
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
We have Loki, Natalist Loki

1768
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I trust Bananaman, Loki for sure

1769
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Homer Simpson, Natalist Loki

1770
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Natalist Loki

1771
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I trust the bird because the bird is the word

1772
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Well everybody said

1773
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
About the bird

1774
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Yeah, stop it

1775
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Let's see

1776
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Loki

1777
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
At least he mentions games I work on

1778
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
We all trust Loki because we all love Secret Club

1779
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Natalist Loki over anything

1780
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Although anything is better than G4

1781
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
I don't know, G4 has hotness

1782
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
G4 has Ninja Challenge

1783
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
That is a good point

1784
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
G4 does have Ninja Challenge

1785
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Loki, not the OLR, the Norse god

1786
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
I've trusted Loki with my life before

1787
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Or budget at least

1788
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
And there you go

1789
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I'd be willing to bet that we'll find out

1790
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Probably before it's released

1791
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I mean, well

1792
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Obviously we're going to find out before it's released

1793
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
But we were going to find out before

1794
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
They announce it, let me put it that way

1795
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Alright

1796
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Well, do you think you know

1797
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
A catchphrase that ought to be

1798
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
In the next NBA Jam

1799
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
If you have the next Boomshakalaka

1800
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
If you know

1801
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Boomshakalaka, he's on fire

1802
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
If you have the next

1803
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Catchphrase for NBA Jam

1804
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
They want to know

1805
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
EA Sports has come out

1806
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Oh, this means you'll have to pay $10 to play it online

1807
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
EA Sports has come out and said

1808
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
That they're doing

1809
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
This whole little contest about

1810
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
The next catchphrase in NBA Jam

1811
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Of course it's taking place on Facebook

1812
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Go to facebook.com slash NBA Jam

1813
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
And you can submit your entries

1814
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Up until May 19th

1815
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
9am pacific time

1816
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
That doesn't give you much time

1817
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
On the top 64 entries

1818
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
And the one with the highest votes

1819
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Will be immortalized in

1820
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
The game

1821
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Now they say the entries must be

1822
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Associated with one of the following actions

1823
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
In the game

1824
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Dunks, assists, alley oops

1825
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Blocks, 3 point shots

1826
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
2 point field goal

1827
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
On fire shots, steals

1828
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Shot clock violations, rebounds

1829
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Miss shots

1830
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Catchphrases should avoid a reference to specific

1831
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
NBA players and they must not contain

1832
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Pornography, illicit content and must be

1833
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Appropriate for audiences 13 years of age

1834
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I listened to the

1835
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Ad for that

1836
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Dan played it the other day, I was like

1837
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Dude, it's the guy

1838
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
AlphaCananagram suggests

1839
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
And Boom Goes the Dynamite

1840
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
That's a great

1841
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
YouTube clip by the way, if you've never seen it

1842
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
I think that should be in the game

1843
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Boom Goes the Dynamite

1844
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I don't know, I'm thinking that maybe they could

1845
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
You know, do something with

1846
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
The bird

1847
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
No, no

1848
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
SSJ100Matt

1849
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Saying that we should have an OLR catchphrase

1850
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
In it, I don't know, what OLR catchphrase

1851
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Would lend itself to basketball

1852
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I don't know, like ferret

1853
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
That doesn't really work, exterminate

1854
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Can you really, I mean that's really a Doctor Who

1855
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Thing that we just kind of stole

1856
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
What other OLR catchphrases do we have?

1857
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
I don't know, do we have other catchphrases?

1858
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Your mom

1859
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
There's Rob Rob Rob Rob What

1860
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I don't know

1861
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I don't think that'll do it

1862
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Some other folks are saying

1863
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
That they should try to sneak in an

1864
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
OLR reference into the catchphrases

1865
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
I really don't know what that

1866
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
OLR catchphrase would be

1867
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Ferret

1868
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Duck Island, okay

1869
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Duck Island might work

1870
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
He made that shot all the way from

1871
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Duck Island

1872
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
They'd be like, what?

1873
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
He's not coming in from Duck Island

1874
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
No, how about no

1875
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
It's just J100 Matt

1876
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Says friend your butt

1877
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
He'll friend your butt

1878
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Dunk

1879
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
No, that won't work either

1880
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Cause that might not be appropriate for audiences

1881
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Under 13, alright

1882
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Maybe that'll be a future-less list, I don't know

1883
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Although the contest will be over by then, we'll see

1884
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Look at him

1885
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Paddle those balls

1886
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
No

1887
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
That ain't appropriate

1888
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
But it did make me laugh

1889
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
It did make me laugh

1890
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Alright

1891
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Let's move on with some more news

1892
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
And of course release dates coming up

1893
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
And the classic game of the week at some point tonight

1894
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Well how about something that isn't crappy

1895
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
There's a Castlevania

1896
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
game coming out on the iPhone, Rob

1897
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
OMG what?

1898
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Yeah

1899
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
It's a

1900
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Encore of the night

1901
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Which is really

1902
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
It's gonna be hard to control, right

1903
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Puzzle game

1904
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
It's like

1905
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
When I looked at it, I was like

1906
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Oh, it's Puzzle Fighter and Puzzle Quest

1907
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
So

1908
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Yeah, so basically the little screen capture on here

1909
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
is Alucard playing against one of the fish guys

1910
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Who hangs out in Dracula's basement

1911
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
But it could be fun

1912
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
I think I'm gonna try it out, you know

1913
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
But it also looks like it's timed

1914
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Each of your little matches is timed

1915
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Because there's an hourglass

1916
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
But why can't they just

1917
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Or maybe when the timer runs out

1918
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Something bad happens

1919
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Like the fish guy

1920
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Takes a big poop or something, I don't know

1921
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
And eats your face

1922
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
And poops your face

1923
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Yes

1924
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
It could be cool

1925
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I

1926
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
I guess

1927
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
I like puzzle games, I like Castlevania

1928
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
It's all in the price

1929
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
It's all in the price

1930
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
By the way, some more suggestions for the NBA Jam

1931
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Thing from our chat, and I gotta say this is my favorite

1932
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
So far from SSG100 Matt

1933
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
D-d-d-d-dongle

1934
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
That's a good one

1935
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
That's a good one

1936
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
I might be saying this wrong

1937
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Shez-ro

1938
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Shez-ro

1939
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Shez-ro says double down

1940
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
You know, like in reference to Loki's

1941
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Least favorite KFC food

1942
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Alright, let's move on to some release dates

1943
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
We're gonna travel around the world and look at some

1944
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Release dates, Loki

1945
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
We're gonna look at some release dates

1946
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
No, it doesn't really work for

1947
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
NBA Jam

1948
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
No, it doesn't

1949
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Yeah, actually some good stuff coming up this week

1950
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Kind of the

1951
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Big push for

1952
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Games until

1953
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Memorial Day, woo

1954
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
July, July is like that

1955
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
But this week though we have SplitSecond coming out on

1956
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

1957
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Highly recommend picking that up, it's actually pretty awesome

1958
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Oh, and also on PC apparently

1959
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Shrek Forever After

1960
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
for the little tykes, of course the new

1961
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Tie-in game with that movie that

1962
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Thankfully is done

1963
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
No more Shrek movies, thank you

1964
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
They'll be coming out on Playstation 3

1965
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Xbox 360

1966
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Wii, DS, and PSP

1967
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Prince of Persia

1968
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
The Forgotten Sands

1969
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Making its way out on Playstation 3, Xbox 360

1970
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Wii and DS and PSP

1971
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
The PSP version

1972
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Is supposed to be 2D and then they're also

1973
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Re-releasing Prince of Persia

1974
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Sands of Time on Playstation 2

1975
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
In case you haven't picked that up and feel

1976
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Festive with the movie coming out and everything

1977
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
The game I'm

1978
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Definitely gonna be playing

1979
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
A lot this week, Red Dead Redemption

1980
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Coming out on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

1981
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
This week

1982
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
City Builder

1983
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Coming out on the Wii until the Forgotten

1984
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
About game that no one will be picking up

1985
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Attack of the Movies

1986
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
3D, it's a parody

1987
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Of a bunch of movies including Terminator

1988
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
And you know

1989
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Alien, Mummy

1990
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
It's got 3D glasses and you can play

1991
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
It is an on-rails

1992
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Shooter game and what makes it

1993
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Even more bizarre is it's coming out on

1994
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
360 as well, how the fuck is that

1995
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Gonna work

1996
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
With the analog sticks I guess

1997
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Horrible decision

1998
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
And then of course Alan Wake making its way

1999
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Out on Xbox 360

2000
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
And they're also doing the limited edition

2001
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
For that this week as well

2002
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
And that's

2003
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Basically it

2004
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
It's just J100 Matt in our chat room

2005
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
That play was better than a DS

2006
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Master email

2007
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Oh I'm sorry, how did I miss this

2008
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I must have scrolled too quickly

2009
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Imagine Animal Doctor Care Center on DS

2010
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
And then a better game

2011
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Blue Dragon Awaken Shadows

2012
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Come out on DS as well

2013
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Blue Dragon

2014
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I got a good one

2015
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
He's on, FIRED

2016
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Rob

2017
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Rob

2018
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Rob

2019
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
That's the slow Rob

2020
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
And of course one week from today

2021
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Super Mario Galaxy 2

2022
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Going to Japan and looking at the release dates

2023
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
On the Xbox 360, Lost Planet 2

2024
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Senko no Ronde Duo

2025
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Comes out on the Xbox 360 as well

2026
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
That is

2027
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
An updated version of an old game

2028
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
That's now on the Xbox 360

2029
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
New graphics and everything

2030
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Tropico 3 also, again these are Japanese

2031
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Release dates and the Xbox 360 is getting

2032
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
A whole little bundle for Lost Planet 2

2033
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
There you go

2034
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Going over to the Playstation 3 and looking at

2035
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
What's coming out there

2036
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Another Lost Planet 2

2037
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
The port for the PS3 is coming out there

2038
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
World Soccer winning 11 2010

2039
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Aoki Samurai no Chosen

2040
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Comes out there as well

2041
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
There's also a brand new

2042
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Hori Pad if you want to check that out

2043
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
If you are into the Japanese peripherals

2044
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
You can look at that

2045
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
On the Nintendo Wii this week, not a lot

2046
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
World Soccer winning 11 2010 comes out this week

2047
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Next week, just so you know, is the Japanese

2048
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Release of Red Steel 2

2049
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
They don't have that game yet

2050
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
On the Playstation 2

2051
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Tier Nanog is getting a price reduction

2052
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Coming out, there's also a port of World Soccer

2053
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Winning 11 2010 and a few games

2054
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
In the Lucien Bees series

2055
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
There's Evil Violet and Justice Yellow

2056
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
So I'm guessing those are like Pokemon

2057
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
E types of games

2058
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
On the Nintendo DS, Captain Tsubasa

2059
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Gekitou no Kiseki

2060
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Comes out this week

2061
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
That is a soccer type of game

2062
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I guess with all the winning 11, the DS wants in on the action

2063
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
It's also a manga

2064
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Different game, oh is it, is it a soccer manga type of thing?

2065
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Yeah

2066
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
And then coming out on the PSP

2067
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Heganni no Rekinjutsushi

2068
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Full Metal Alchemist

2069
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Yakuzoku no Hiei

2070
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Yes, it's a Full Metal Alchemist game

2071
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
On the PSP

2072
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
As to what type of game it is

2073
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I think you actually kind of get to play

2074
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
As Ed and Al

2075
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
You get to

2076
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
I don't know if it's like a

2077
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Kind of like a little 3D adventure game

2078
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
With a lot of cut scenes and dialogue

2079
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
So it's a

2080
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
I think it'll do Full Metal Alchemist fans

2081
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Some justice there, so check that out

2082
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
On the PSP this week in Japan

2083
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Those are Japanese release dates

2084
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
In the UK

2085
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
We have on the 18th Dragon Age

2086
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Origins, Darkspawn Chronicles

2087
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
On the 21st

2088
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Mud Nation Racers, Morphex

2089
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Prince of Persia, The Forgotten Sands

2090
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
All Star Karate

2091
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Red Dead Redemption

2092
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
and Rooms the Main Building

2093
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Oh yeah, and Split Second Velocity

2094
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Busy week

2095
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Yep

2096
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Alright

2097
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
More gaming news and then the classic game of the week

2098
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Coming right up and

2099
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Dark Sakura, I'm not going to spoil what the game is

2100
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
This week, but she just picked a game where she's like

2101
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Yeah, pretty much everyone

2102
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Says this is a classic

2103
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
So we'll get to that in a little bit

2104
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
To put it a little bit more

2105
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
It's a game that

2106
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Dan and I played a lot of when we first

2107
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Got together

2108
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
It has sentimental value

2109
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Alright, we'll get to that in just a moment, Loki

2110
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Apparently, you know, we kind of alluded to this

2111
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
A little bit last week when we were talking about

2112
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Mega Man Universe

2113
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
The trademark that was filed by Capcom

2114
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Recently

2115
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Well, it's been announced that

2116
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Capcom is working on an MMO

2117
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Called Mega Man Online

2118
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
And according to

2119
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
GameSpot, they're saying it's being

2120
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
co-developed by Korea's

2121
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
NeoWiz Games

2122
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
They're responsible for EA Sports

2123
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
FIFA Online

2124
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
And

2125
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Possibly

2126
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Possibly might be related to the Mega Man

2127
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Universe game

2128
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Well, maybe it's

2129
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Could be different names, different regions

2130
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Yeah

2131
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
You never know

2132
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I don't know

2133
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
That's kind of neat

2134
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
I don't know what they're really going to do for a Mega Man Online game

2135
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
But it'll be pretty awesome, I'm sure

2136
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
I'm going to kind of approach this with a big

2137
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Huh

2138
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
It's just kind of like

2139
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
How would a Mega Man Online game

2140
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Work?

2141
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
But then I think about Mega Man Legends

2142
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
And I'm like, huh

2143
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
This could be interesting

2144
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I'm not sure how yet

2145
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Or imagine if you're not really playing as Mega Man

2146
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
But imagine if you got to be like your own

2147
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Robot Master boss

2148
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
That'd be kind of rad, actually

2149
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
I don't know, there's just

2150
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Things that make you go hmm

2151
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
There's definitely a big hmm factor with this

2152
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I don't know, I don't know what to think

2153
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
I'll need to see screenshots or something

2154
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Do you think you'll get to see more of this at E3?

2155
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
It might be a little early, but

2156
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
That'd be kind of neat if they announced something

2157
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Very cool

2158
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Alright, well we'll see what happens

2159
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
With Mega Man Online

2160
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
DarkSakura, do you like the idea

2161
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Of Mega Man going online, or is it

2162
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Enough of the freaking MMOs already?

2163
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
It's a good idea

2164
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Yay for whoever wants to play it

2165
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Good for them

2166
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Ask Star Trek Online, dude

2167
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Even if you got to be a Robot Master boss

2168
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
There's no Robot Master boss you'd want to be

2169
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Well

2170
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
No

2171
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Alright

2172
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
It's Sakura Woman

2173
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Loki could finally have Pizza Man

2174
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
For reals

2175
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
That reference is about 5 years old on this show

2176
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Pizza Man

2177
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
I think there's a clip of that

2178
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Let me tell you how old that reference is

2179
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
There's a clip of that on our

2180
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
MySpace

2181
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Oh, we were talking about the Mega Man 2

2182
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Sound effect thing

2183
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Yeah, there you go, you got it

2184
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Alright, one more story for you guys

2185
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
We were talking about music games a little bit earlier

2186
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
In the show, it's very interesting

2187
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Because apparently there are rumors

2188
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
If you want to believe this Swedish retailer

2189
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Webhallen

2190
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
They are believing that a Pearl Jam

2191
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Rock band is in the

2192
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Works

2193
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Apparently some box art has leaked out

2194
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Although this could be one of those mock ups

2195
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
To get you to pre-order things

2196
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
MTV is saying up and down

2197
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
They have not announced anything besides

2198
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Green Day Rock Band and Rock Band 3

2199
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
But they are quick to say

2200
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
We have a great relationship with Pearl Jam

2201
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
And hope to have many of their more awesome music in the game

2202
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
In the future

2203
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Hmm

2204
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Here's where I have a problem with this right now

2205
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
They've

2206
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Given it a Peggy rating on the box art

2207
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
This early

2208
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
The fact that they haven't even announced the game yet

2209
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
It would not have a rating

2210
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
It would be rating pending

2211
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Very good point

2212
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
It's fake

2213
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Wishful thinking basically

2214
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
I mean, I don't know

2215
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
I kind of go, okay, yeah, I could see Pearl Jam

2216
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Getting their own rock band

2217
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
We've talked about this on the show before

2218
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
There's only certain bands that can have a rock band

2219
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Not every band

2220
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Is worthy of having a rock band game

2221
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Dedicated to them, but Pearl Jam, okay

2222
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
There was a survey that came out

2223
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
That was asking people what dedicated rock band

2224
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Games would you like to see, which artists

2225
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Would you want to see have their game

2226
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
And Pearl Jam was on the list

2227
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
So I think it's a little bit wishful thinking

2228
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
It's kind of like how

2229
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
With, you know, even if you look at GameStop's

2230
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Website and stuff like that

2231
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
There's a bunch of listings for games

2232
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Like pilot wings for the Wii and stuff like that

2233
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Stuff that doesn't exist

2234
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
That they're taking pre-orders on

2235
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Just in case, you know

2236
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
That kind of stuff

2237
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
That rock band ABBA, that's the one I want

2238
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
By the way, apparently

2239
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Yeah, they are doing

2240
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
That little test right now

2241
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
But there's also some news about how well these games

2242
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Are selling

2243
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
The NPD group is saying that Guitar Hero Van Halen

2244
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Only sold 94,000 copies

2245
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Which kind of makes it a poop

2246
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
However, it's hard to say

2247
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Does that count the free ones that went out?

2248
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Because that sort of would

2249
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Kind of screw those numbers, wouldn't it?

2250
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
It's copies sold

2251
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
So I would imagine, yes it does

2252
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Well to put it in perspective, Guitar Hero Aerosmith

2253
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Sold 2.7 million copies

2254
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Guitar Hero Metallica

2255
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Sold 1 million copies

2256
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Beetle Rock Band, 1.2 million copies

2257
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Guitar Hero Aerosmith

2258
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Sold twice as many

2259
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
As Beetle's rock band

2260
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Well, think about it though, Guitar Hero Aerosmith

2261
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Was first, it was the first

2262
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Kind of, you know

2263
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
One group exclusive

2264
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Game that came out, and it seems like the numbers

2265
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Have slowly gone down since then

2266
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
And the Van Halen just kind of pooped

2267
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
You know, it didn't do much, but it's hard to say

2268
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Because again, they were given that away for free

2269
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Can you really trust that number? I don't know

2270
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
It'll be very interesting to see how the

2271
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Guitar Hero Green Day sells

2272
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
You know what's also not accounted for in here

2273
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
I'm sorry, did I say Guitar Hero Green Day?

2274
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
I meant Rock Band Green Day

2275
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
What's also not accounted for in here is the

2276
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
ACDC Rock Band game that came out

2277
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
I don't see that in here anywhere

2278
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
It was like a live ACDC game, it was exclusive to

2279
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Walmart for a little while, but then it wasn't

2280
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
I don't see numbers for that anywhere in here

2281
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Because there's no numbers for that

2282
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Probably, and just for reference

2283
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
On the Peggy website

2284
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
There is no listing for that new Rock Band game

2285
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
If it had a rating, it would be listed on there

2286
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
See? Analist Loki

2287
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Squelching the rumors

2288
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Right here at Orange Lounge Radio

2289
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Alright

2290
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Just out of curiosity though, if they did

2291
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Do a band based game

2292
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
A one band game, is there any band you'd want to see?

2293
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
No

2294
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
No

2295
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Dark Soccer, any bands you think are deserving of their full

2296
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Rock Band game?

2297
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Electric Light Orchestra!

2298
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Sorry, I've been on an ELO kick lately

2299
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
ABBA Rock Band, you think I'm kidding?

2300
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Radiohead Rock Band

2301
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
I would be down with a Radiohead Rock Band actually

2302
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
But I just don't see Radiohead as the type of band

2303
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
That would want to be a part of that

2304
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
And you know

2305
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
I know they said, oh well on the Rock Band Network

2306
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
It could happen

2307
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
I would like to see some drum based tracks

2308
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Come out on Rock Band

2309
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Like, you know, get some Pendulum in there

2310
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Something like that

2311
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
I mean that would be pretty cool

2312
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
With some guitar stuff in there

2313
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
I guess it would be really difficult to do on drums

2314
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
But it would be neat to see

2315
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room

2316
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
He's getting a lot of comments tonight

2317
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
But he's saying some good stuff

2318
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Well that was a track pack

2319
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
It wasn't actually a separate game

2320
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
It wasn't listed as a separate game, it was a track pack

2321
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Yes but Bobby, technically you can play it by itself

2322
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Therefore it is kind of a separate game

2323
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
I get what he's saying though

2324
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
It's in the vein of those country packs

2325
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
And the things they sold individually

2326
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
But yeah, I thought of it as a separate game

2327
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Could you buy the ACDC stuff?

2328
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
You can buy it and play it by itself

2329
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
I didn't think you could buy it from within Rock Band

2330
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
No, you can't buy it within Rock Band

2331
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
You can buy the track pack

2332
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
You can buy it by itself or dump it into your game

2333
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Donovan's suggesting Village People Rock Band

2334
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Blackwolf again says

2335
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I'd like to see Rush or U2

2336
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Funny T-Man says

2337
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Golden Girls Rock Band

2338
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
There you go

2339
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
It could be the Betty White version of

2340
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Thank You for Being a Friend from Saturday Night Live a couple weeks ago

2341
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Anyhow, let's get into

2342
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Speaking of old classics

2343
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Because when doesn't the Golden Girls seem to come up on this show lately?

2344
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Old classics!

2345
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Because I want to be Betty White when I grow up

2346
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Dark Soccer likes to dig through the gaming vault

2347
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
And find a game that she says

2348
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Hey, hey, listen

2349
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Hey, listen

2350
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
You kids ought to be playing this game

2351
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
It's the classic video game of the week

2352
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
And I think though this week

2353
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
She's managed to pick a game that

2354
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Most people have played

2355
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
But if you haven't

2356
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
What the hell? Seriously

2357
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Where the hell have you been?

2358
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Let's get to it

2359
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

2360
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Super Mario 64

2361
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Super Mario 64

2362
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Yeah, this

2363
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
I have to say

2364
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
This is one of my favorite ever

2365
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Nintendo 64 games

2366
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Probably one of my favorite

2367
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
It's up there in my list of favorites

2368
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
It was, you know

2369
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
The first real dive

2370
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Into 3D for Mario

2371
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
And it was one of those games

2372
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
That controller just seemed to be made for

2373
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
But I love the music

2374
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Can you turn it up for a minute?

2375
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I love the early level

2376
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
I also love that you can go up to

2377
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
A sleeping piranha plant

2378
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
And punch him in the face

2379
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Cause look, he's about to do it here too

2380
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
But that was like, there were just so many

2381
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Little fun things, you know, you could do the wall jump

2382
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
You could also glitch the game hardcore

2383
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
And just beat it right from the very get go

2384
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
If you were really good at the wall jump

2385
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
See, he punched the piranha plant in the face

2386
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Sure did, in the face

2387
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Mario's hardcore like that

2388
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
He's a thug

2389
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
At any rate

2390
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
The game starts off

2391
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
At Princess Peach's castle

2392
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
And she writes him a letter

2393
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
And says, I baked you a cake

2394
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Even though I'm a princess and have servants

2395
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
To do it for me

2396
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
I think it was also the first game in the US

2397
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Where we got her name as being Peach

2398
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
If you think about it though, she is a princess

2399
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
She could take credit for what her servants did

2400
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
And their, you know

2401
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
I baked this for you

2402
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
By me, I mean I own these servants that made it for you

2403
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
I want to say she was actually Peach

2404
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
In Mario 3

2405
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
I think, well I know Mario Kart

2406
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Was on Super Nintendo and that was before this

2407
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I'm pretty sure Mario 3 called her Peach

2408
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
At any rate

2409
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
You go through

2410
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
The entire game

2411
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
And it's kind of neat because

2412
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Not only is it

2413
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
The different levels you have to go through

2414
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
You have 8 different ways of going through

2415
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
A lot of these levels

2416
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
You have to beat them in different ways

2417
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
So it was very innovative

2418
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
And a good way to reuse

2419
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Levels in different means

2420
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
And that theme kept coming back in later

2421
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
3D Mario games

2422
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Like in Sunshine and I think in Galaxy

2423
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
You had different ways of beating the levels

2424
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
And that was pretty cool

2425
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
You could get different things like the Metal Cap

2426
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Where you turn like into

2427
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Shiney crue Mario

2428
01:23:51,000 --> 01:24:04,040
Like bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang

2429
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,000
Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang

2430
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
There. How's that

2431
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Yes

2432
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
And you can find a pink Bob-omb Buddy

2433
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Wooo. He's pink

2434
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:21,120
and there were you also had coins that you used for your life so and you know

2435
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:28,100
you could also you know there was like I said the wall jump you could do a triple

2436
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:34,040
jump you can flip you can do all kinds of extra stuff but it actually started

2437
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:41,960
off as Super Mario FX when Miyamoto is working on Star Fox so it was originally

2438
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:49,280
gonna be a Super FX game for the SNES but it couldn't quite reach what he

2439
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:54,480
wanted to do so basically he I think I think he pulled an avatar on this dusted

2440
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:57,560
it off out of a drawer decided oh technologists caught up let's do it and

2441
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:04,520
then I love the sliding levels too you just fell down a hole though and you

2442
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:10,600
you can move the camera around and it does have a fairly set path you can go

2443
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:16,200
but you can just run around and do stuff and explore and even if you're like

2444
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:19,360
trying to beat a certain way if like if you're doing a certain mission that has

2445
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:22,320
you beat the level a certain way you can actually do it the other way you know if

2446
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:32,760
you just decide to do that but it's it's really just you know pretty cool and

2447
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:37,400
also the music and it was done by Koji Kondo who is one of my personal heroes

2448
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:41,960
and it was one of the first ones that had Charles Martinet to do the voice

2449
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:51,080
he's so cool he's so cool he was cool to meet you know so yeah it's I think in

2450
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:57,760
that list of one of you know best games ever and dude punching a piranha plant

2451
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:03,360
in the face you know grabbing Koop you know Bowser by the tail and swinging

2452
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,680
them around and throwing them off a building you know Mario turned into a

2453
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:11,720
thug in this game and also if you want to see something incredibly fun go on

2454
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:21,000
YouTube and just watch speed runs but now the the really interesting thing

2455
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:30,920
with this game for me is that Dan and I we spent because he had a Nintendo 64

2456
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:34,080
we know we don't we didn't actually have nearly the collection that we do now

2457
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:38,680
when we first moved in together we had maybe about 20 video game systems then

2458
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:43,960
maybe 15 something like that and you know I moved out here with like my Super

2459
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:49,360
Nintendo and stuff but he had a Nintendo 64 and we just played the stew out of

2460
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:56,160
this game and you know we put the rumble pack and we had a lot of fun it was just

2461
01:26:56,160 --> 01:27:02,320
really really cool and I actually have the Nintendo DS one it's actually a

2462
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:07,360
little harder to play but you know you place Yoshi Luigi and Wario and it looks

2463
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:11,960
a little bit better and it's got minigames and multiplayer mode and it's

2464
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:20,000
pretty good there is there was a direct sequel plan for the Nintendo 64 double D

2465
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:28,800
and Miyamoto it started at 97 and it was gonna be released in 99 but because the

2466
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:36,880
64 double D didn't make it my husband just decided to pop his head in the door

2467
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:39,160
and said that the movie he was watching was awesome what movie were they

2468
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:45,480
watching kick-ass no kick-ass good times but because 64 double D pretty much

2469
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:54,840
flopped it we basically got Super Mario sunshine on the Gamecube and then we got

2470
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:58,960
Super Mario Galaxy of course we're getting into the Super Mario Galaxy so

2471
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:05,600
this game has a special place in my heart that and when you win the game

2472
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:14,800
peach makes you a cake like she promised good for her all right well there it is

2473
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:20,400
your classic game of the week Super Mario 64 now I want to give a quick

2474
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:24,480
counter opinion this is not my favorite Mario game in the series I did not like

2475
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:28,440
the transition to 3d very much I understand a lot of people are all

2476
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:31,920
excited about it but I don't know I I had a really hard time with this game

2477
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:36,840
after the awesomeness that were the Super Nintendo Mario games I don't know

2478
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:42,160
the switch to 3d never felt right for me but oddly enough I was okay with Mario

2479
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:48,400
Sunshine I know that makes me weird I'm all sorts of weird but whatever all

2480
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:53,520
right anyhow our weirdo Rob I am weird it's fine it's fine I'm ideal with it

2481
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:57,960
okay anyhow let's go ahead and take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio we got

mind tonight Loki ah yes apparently there is another dance game coming to

2500
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:20,680
the Wii and funny enough this actually has a tie back into one of the shows

2501
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:27,400
that I wasn't a part of but Rob had hosted while back and it's a kids bop

2502
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:32,280
dance party the video game you might ask how did that even you know the fuck did

2503
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:35,520
that come up on olr I don't even remember it wasn't on olr it was on

2504
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:40,840
vanilla sky because I wanted to spin off shows yeah oh oh god yes oh yeah we had

2505
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:45,440
the kids bop thing yes the kids bop trivia game where if you got the trivia

2506
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:49,920
question wrong the volume of this song that was my favorite games we ever did

2507
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:53,680
where if you got the trivia questions wrong the kids bop music got louder yes

2508
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:56,560
and it would distract you from getting future and see they should make a real

2509
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:00,640
game show out of that I'm a genius I invented that game all by myself the

2510
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:05,120
game will be launching September 21st will feature 24 contemporary hits as

2511
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:09,920
they put it in quotes there including and if you haven't heard of kids bop

2512
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:15,360
it's basically kids singing you know popular songs so imagine all your

2513
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:19,600
favorite and not so favorite songs and like from a top 40 radio station just

2514
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:25,040
kind of like thrown down the garbage disposal and that's like a kid's music

2515
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:31,120
yes the Benny Hill theme came up inadvertently oops the Benny Hill theme

2516
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:35,200
unfortunately not part of the kids bop dance party video game you know it's

2517
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:41,280
funny total mistake did intend for that music to play but somehow fitting yes

2518
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:46,720
such songs in this will be of course Lady Gaga's paparazzi Michael Jackson's

2519
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:52,920
thriller thanks get the party started and yeah it's gonna include a free play

2520
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:58,480
challenge dance-off shop and dress-up modes and it will feature two players

2521
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:04,560
that can dance cooperatively or go to head-to-head lame but not really my

2522
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:09,240
target demographic but then again just dance sold million copies so what do I

2523
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:15,960
know about games I guess apparently nothing if you are a collector of such

2524
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:21,600
odd game peripherals as I don't know the chainsaw controller for Resident Evil

2525
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:27,680
or I guess in this case Dragon Quest it's gonna be getting its own Dragon

2526
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:36,280
Quest monsters battle road victory it's a Wii game that was a port of an arcade

2527
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:40,680
game that's based on collectible cards but the actual controller like the

2528
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:45,560
arcade has two giant buttons and a giant sword that looks like it's basically the

2529
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:49,480
sword in the stone that you have to interact with as well the controller

2530
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:58,040
will cost the 12,800 yen of the equivalent of $137 US and will be out in

2531
01:32:58,040 --> 01:33:04,560
Japan this summer so if you're a big collector of odd peripherals this will

2532
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:09,280
be coming to you from Hori and then finally of course we've been hearing

2533
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:15,600
about a lot of cameos of characters in lost planet 2 including you know Dom

2534
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:21,400
from Gears of War well now of course you know Sony's got to have their characters

2535
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:26,240
in there as well not really making it in for the launch but there will be some

2536
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:30,880
free download content coming out soon that will include the Helghast

2537
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:35,200
characters from the Killzone series that you'll be able to play as in lost

2538
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:39,360
planet 2 and they have a few different versions of those that you get to play

2539
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:45,360
as so those will be available for free on the PlayStation Network in June can I

2540
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:48,840
pitch a dream game to you guys real quick and all our dream game possible I

2541
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:52,800
just want to pitch it to you guys and see what you guys think okay the crew

2542
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:55,960
from Kidz Bop meets Gwar

2543
01:33:55,960 --> 01:34:03,480
that'd be weird and I don't know like maybe could be like a point-and-click

2544
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:07,320
type of game like in the vein of you know Sam & Max and those types of games

2545
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:12,360
where like the you play as the the folks from Gwar and you're trying to find the

2546
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:16,720
people from Kidz Bop and like corrupt them and or murder them I will one-up

2547
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:21,960
that okay okay I'll one up that please we need to launch a new CD series called

2548
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:26,400
Gwar Bop they basically take score and have saying all these different

2549
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:34,120
temporary hits as they put it hey hey I I'd play that I would do good stuff

2550
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:37,560
alright and then we'll make it come full circle and put it out of the game alright

2551
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:43,440
so possibly coming to a PC near you alright moving on let's talk about some

2552
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:48,120
other quick news halo 2 yes there were still some holdouts playing halo 2

2553
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:51,560
online you might remember there were guys that were refusing to pull their

2554
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:56,800
neck connection and what's kind of weird is that Microsoft you would think would

2555
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:00,320
have just like like put the ban hammer down on them a long time ago but they

2556
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:04,200
kind of thought it was funny and they they let it go like as long as they

2557
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:07,680
could hold out their connections and so forth and the last man standing was

2558
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:15,240
Apache and for sir was the gamertag and he was finally removed he says he was

2559
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:18,480
kicked off but you know kicked off could mean that his Comcast connection sucks

2560
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:21,520
balls because that's what's been happening to me on World of Warcraft

2561
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:24,720
these past couple weeks tech came to my house and everything said he couldn't

2562
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:28,320
find anything wrong like yeah I guess I'm just fucking crazy yeah that's just

2563
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:33,880
our crappy service it's a feature so anyhow whatever I so he finally got

2564
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:37,840
booted whether it was by Microsoft or his cable provider who knows but it was

2565
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:43,520
at 11 o'clock or just before 11 o'clock pacific time may 10th 2010 he was out of

2566
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:48,400
halo 2 which means that's it for the original Xbox Live that was the official

2567
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:53,360
last connection on Xbox Live rest in pieces who that could be like the tag

2568
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:59,960
line for war versus kid Bob surezo in chat suggests I kids bought versus

2569
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:05,440
Capcom I remember that from a couple weeks ago yes you can now play Gameboy

2570
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:12,040
games on your nest yes your actual NES that's right not not talking about the

2571
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:15,560
Super Gameboy that was for the Super Nintendo no it's a device that was

2572
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:20,480
created by this guy on the Nintendo age forums who calls himself bunny boy it's

2573
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:24,840
called retro vision and you plug the car into the Nintendo put your Gameboy game

2574
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:29,240
in there and you're good to go this is even more awesome it has the

2575
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:33,480
expansion port on it too so you can use your Gameboy printer remember the

2576
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:39,040
Gameboy printer what a worthless piece of shit that thing was huh huh didn't

2577
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:45,000
they have like a hidden DJ game in that though the the printer software the what

2578
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,920
software the printer software that came with the actual printer does it I don't

2579
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:55,080
remember yeah there's a little like game in there or I don't know one I didn't

2580
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:58,760
pay for one all right I just remember seeing the features and I thought gee

2581
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:04,640
that was stupid can I put my own receipts on it oh that might be good I

2582
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:09,600
don't know I game room updates there's now we have to start covering these two

2583
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:12,720
we got rock band releases virtual console releases now we have game room

2584
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:17,520
releases as well this week you missed battle zone Canyon bomber Keystone

2585
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:21,400
capers for the 2600 Canyon bomber is also the 2600 version not the arcade

2586
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:26,240
version mega zone for the arcade night driver for the Atari 2600 oink for the

2587
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:30,320
2600 and soccer for the Intellivision interesting thing about game room the

2588
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:34,360
game packs that you're downloading are actually two weeks worth of games it's

2589
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:38,840
just that half of them stay locked for a week so if you downloaded you know

2590
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:42,320
something that was in last week's pack like pitfall you already had this week's

2591
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:45,560
pack waiting to go interesting huh although you would have should have been

2592
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:50,200
able to guess that because games pack one and two are like 15 games apiece so

2593
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:53,480
game pack three rolls around and it's you know another 50 megabytes it's

2594
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:57,280
actually 15 more games go figure well some of the games have been announced

2595
01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:00,640
for the next pack that is coming out and that is going to be coming out on May

2596
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:04,560
19th because it looks like what is that Wednesday is gonna be game room day yeah

2597
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:08,320
asteroids for the arcade you know we already have asteroids deluxe but you

2598
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:12,680
get original asteroids this time demons two diamonds was a 2600 game that's

2599
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:17,800
coming out this week as well Grand Prix from Activision shark shark space duel

2600
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:21,680
it was an arcade game it was kind of like a souped-up asteroids I guess you

2601
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:26,000
could say probably I think the biggest release this week stampede is coming out

2602
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:30,040
this week on the 2600 oh I have fond memories of stampede we went to the

2603
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:34,640
classic gaming Expo I participated in like the official stampede scoreboard

2604
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:38,360
that twin galaxies was doing I think I got like next to last place I'm that

2605
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:44,120
good at stampede time pilot is also coming out May 19th but time pilots

2606
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:47,660
already available on Xbox Live just so you know for five bucks and you get the

2607
01:38:47,660 --> 01:38:51,680
souped-up version so if you want to buy time pilot for game room that's on you

2608
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:56,360
but you'll get the opportunity this week to buy it all over again if you want

2609
01:38:56,360 --> 01:39:01,040
it's all about money that's right Monday Monday Monday and speaking of all about

2610
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:10,560
money how about our rock band releases for the week as yay what is wrong with

2611
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:14,900
my computer well where do I begin I'm just kidding

2612
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:19,240
seriously it frees up or something no it's opening 50,000 windows when I'm

2613
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:28,880
trying to yikes spam spam spam no lose weight increase your penis yes it's no

2614
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:32,040
because it's completely screwing up now so all right that's fine I'll go to some

2615
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:35,800
chat room comments chat that orange on trade calm salacious pop says demons and

2616
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:40,280
diamonds was a paddle game though with it was a big twisty knob paddle and

2617
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:44,720
trackball for game room please I somewhat agree although I don't think at

2618
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:48,080
the end of the day I would be able to justify buying a trackball for my Xbox

2619
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:51,600
because I know it costs like 30 to 40 bucks and what am I gonna play with it

2620
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:58,320
Crystal Castles whoo I don't know although you know in theory they do they

2621
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:01,360
do need to have better support for that so it's a prey hack that together playing

2622
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:06,920
Crystal Castles on the joystick or the little Xbox 360 controller just just it

2623
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:12,840
stinks it stinks all right so we have I've got everything pulled up now I had

2624
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:18,440
to basically reload it all our rock band download content actually is pretty cool

2625
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:22,120
we've got a Grateful Dead pack which includes beat it on down the line

2626
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:27,240
Cumberland blues scarlet begonias throwing stones touch of gray and US

2627
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:30,800
blues and then two songs by the smithereens and I like the smithereens

2628
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:34,840
is one of my groups I really liked when I was in high school is a girl like you

2629
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:42,120
and only a memory those are both really good songs for some project new town

2630
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:48,280
news their big event is going to have a Cirque du Soleil performance you Cirque

2631
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:56,880
du Soleil but it'll be on June 13th so look forward to feats of flexibility or

2632
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:05,440
as my friend calls it Cirque du Soguet I know right and then Bayonetta the

2633
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:11,000
director Kamiya Hideki he basically doesn't like that there's a Bayonetta

2634
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:20,160
doujinshi like hentai doujinshi about Bayonetta getting getting it on well I

2635
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:25,520
mean she's kind of sexy that means you've got a popular product hi the more

2636
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:31,100
you know I I have personally Sega should be fucking excited that they have like a

2637
01:41:31,100 --> 01:41:37,400
new franchise here you know what I mean well I mean trust me you go to cons and

2638
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:42,720
see how much Final Fantasy 7 doujin there were you know I've got a ton

2639
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:47,880
myself of other series that I won't need I actually have some Final Fantasy 7

2640
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:55,800
doujinshi doesn't everyone this interesting um but um and I have a few

2641
01:41:55,800 --> 01:42:00,960
roni kenshin ones too but anyway um he's basically quoted saying it seems

2642
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:04,320
there's pornographic doujinshi based off Bayonetta there are fans who will resent

2643
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:08,000
that and I hardly think those responsible hold any love for the game

2644
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:15,640
dude get get your head out your butt dude um there was though Chris is it

2645
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:19,840
dalen or dalen there's a quote from him and I actually like this and this is

2646
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:24,680
actually a point that I've had with you know some of these games that guys can

2647
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:29,520
go and get outfits for their female characters and you know I always laughed

2648
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:33,400
that WrestleMania was like dress-up for for boys you know because they could

2649
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:37,600
customize their wrestler and you know but um the quote saying guys tell

2650
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:40,080
themselves they shouldn't listen to fashion they're terrified if they spend

2651
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:43,040
enough time playing as Bayonetta being Bayonetta and witnessing the power of

2652
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:47,560
her high heels and endless tresses well at some point they'll stop objectifying

2653
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:51,760
her they want to be her she won't invite our gaze as much as grip it until she

2654
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:57,640
sucked us into a vortex of overpowering femininity I like that a vortex of

2655
01:42:57,640 --> 01:43:05,960
overpowering femininity that should be on the box can we get an iTunes review

2656
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:09,160
for our show that says that

2657
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:15,520
boo power a vortex of overpowering feminine is that what they're calling

2658
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:22,320
her bits now it's a vortex all right some other gaming news and of course

2659
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:25,800
we'll get to the skype line the mailbag and all that fun stuff in just a little

2660
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:32,120
bit but some other new stories first starting off with Loki yes you know it's

2661
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:37,040
like every week we hear about another game franchise being turned into a movie

2662
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:43,600
and each one you was perceived with more of a eye roll than the next well this

2663
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:48,720
shouldn't be a surprise rollercoaster tycoon is now becoming a movie thanks to

2664
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:55,280
Sony pictures what how does that even work it's just gonna be a movie about

2665
01:43:55,280 --> 01:44:01,200
people liking theme parks and building theme parks it'll be some stupid plot

2666
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:08,480

rollercoaster tycoon story but he also tweeted this one so I'll do this one

2679
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:27,840

2682
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:40,880
happened here I guess these guys got injured it was Call of Duty modern

2683
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:45,240
warfare 2 and he was playing against a few friends and his mother asked him to

2684
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:50,040
get his daughter's PJs wait so your mother had to tell you to get your

2685
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:53,960
daughter's boy all right so that he didn't realize that the Xbox Live

2686
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:58,280
headset was wrapped around his chairs arm so when he got up quickly BAM the

2687
01:45:58,280 --> 01:46:02,160
wire got caught and the head smashed right into my Mac which was sitting on a

2688
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:09,080
stereo a few feet off the ground ow so he got up quickly and BAM hit his head

2689
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:16,800
that looks hurtful so he went to the hospital and thanks to him I love this

2690
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:20,560
but a few hours later he was online fragging again thanks to a real-life

2691
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:24,760
painkiller perk prescribed by the doctor

2692

2704
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:29,080
would like to see a new one of except unfortunately I think if I really want

2705
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:32,600
to like a new f-zero game it's going to have to be on the Xbox or the

2706
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:38,080
PlayStation 3 and that's not gonna happen 30 tried it there and it sucked

2707

2709
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:54,320

01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:16,880
won't be buying Mario Galaxy 2 my Wii isn't even hooked up right now it is not

my lawn secret castle remember that game yeah good times did they ever do a sequel

2734
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:45,760
game all right hey entertainment also sends us this tweet call of duty has

2735
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:49,360
been making money off multiplayer practically since the launch of the 360

2736
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:57,880
but they sell products EAS P is a service sure why don't I link read this

2737
01:49:57,880 --> 01:50:04,280
one Tiger Claw 305 sends us another Twitter topic it's a link from MTV

2738
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:14,360
multiplayer blog apparently cliffy B has said that mass effect let me read this

2739
01:50:14,360 --> 01:50:18,200
quote quote the thing that was cool is that mass effect is kind of an RPG for

2740
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:21,040
me with the cover-based shooting I think there's a reason why it's been

2741
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:26,120
successful because gamers love gears God get your just take your ego and shove

2742
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:32,320
it up your ass here's something like that I would like to thank myself for

2743
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:36,680
making Mass Effect 2 such a great game because if I put my game out no one

2744
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:40,360
would know first-person shooters are in the window epic first-person shooters

2745
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:43,520
you know I I'm sorry with all due respect I'm awesome I'm not gonna read

2746
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:47,000
the rest of stories I don't give a shit what he thinks yes I'm also awesome

2747
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:50,720
thank you Tiger Claw for trying but I'll just tell you in a nutshell he says mass

2748
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:55,040
effect is the Star Wars for the new generation I'm the Dane Cook oh you know

2749
01:50:55,040 --> 01:51:02,980
what no no what you are like the episode 2 of this generation the Yoda fight was

2750
01:51:02,980 --> 01:51:09,400
cool but come on get over yourself all right although I gotta say with all due

2751
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:15,520
respect to Cliffy be the shadow complex on Xbox Live Arcade was pretty fucking

2752
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:20,880
rat I gotta say I gotta say shadow runner in chat says Cliffy needs to suck

2753
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:27,800
sucking to quit sucking his own dot dot dot you know what um let's see here and

2754
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:34,120
last tweet I'm gonna read here from Jay Jugo says scare so in chat that's how I

2755
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:39,120
say it scares oh I should have known that oh well whatever scares oh thanks

2756
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:44,600

01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:48,440
and also wants to send a quick thank you to Jamie for your pick for the classic

2758
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:53,960
game of the week oh well you're quite welcome woot there you go those are the

2759
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:57,160
Twitter topics I'm sorry for ignoring you for one whole story you know I just

2760
01:51:57,160 --> 01:52:00,760
remembered and this is totally random I don't even know why I just remember this

2761
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:03,620
but I saw earlier this weekend like huh that's not my should mention on the show

2762
01:52:03,620 --> 01:52:06,280
because we talked about it before and we kind of were hoping they would come to

2763
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:10,640
other platforms remember that game that I kind of hated because it was basically

2764
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:15,800
a ripoff of House of the Dead Rock of the Dead it was a game that you know it's

2765
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:20,960
like typing of the dead but you use your guitar controller to I remember that

2766
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:24,200
it's coming up this fall but it's actually not just coming out in the Wii

2767
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:27,960
this time it's actually gonna be coming on 360 and PlayStation 3 as well as the

2768
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:32,120
Wii well done is it please tell me it's a budget title please please uh I don't

2769
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:36,200
remember I don't remember that part but still called Rock of the Dead so called

2770
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:41,200
Rock of the Dead awesome look and I realize you guys are saying like you

2771
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:44,160
know I and I seem to remember when Rock of the Dead first came up on this show a

2772
01:52:44,160 --> 01:52:47,200
lot of people were saying lawsuit it's gonna be a lawsuit but like seriously

2773
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:51,680
after playing 3d game heroes it's a parody that's all they have to say it's

2774
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:57,240
a parody and we're like Loki when you play 3d game heroes and dark Sakura if

2775
01:52:57,240 --> 01:53:00,720
you do at some point you know you really should check it out because it'll tickle

2776
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:05,640
your retro funny bone tell me it's not just a complete effing ripoff oh I can

2777
01:53:05,640 --> 01:53:09,920
tell that without playing it but that's okay I'm fine that Zelda's a good game

2778
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:16,880
it needs to be ripped off more often hey there was already new topia all right

2779
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:22,040
huge news this week everybody's been talking about this and you know we got

2780
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:26,600
to say something about this to steam for the Mac came out this week it included

2781
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:31,360
57 games at launch including torchlight that's actually game I played a little

2782
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:35,520
bit of this week I like me some torchlight was out there for 10 bucks on

2783
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:42,680
steam for the Mac but the best deal of all free free game portal free zero

2784
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:49,080
dollars free nothing may tell May 24th and they didn't want the Mac users to

2785
01:53:49,080 --> 01:53:51,640
have all the fun there because if they only gave it away for free on the Mac

2786
01:53:51,640 --> 01:53:59,200
you'd have people like Loki that would be like that's my Loki impression that

2787
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:01,960
they didn't give it out for free on the PC although I'll bet Loki didn't

2788
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:06,600
download it nope but you really should it is really a great game but I you know

2789
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:12,560
we all know what the trick is here it's a it's an asshole game at this point

2790
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:16,360
it's a great game and you should do it if you've never played it you need to

2791
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:21,360
play it but the trick is it's kind of the Trojan horse to get steam on your

2792
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:25,840
computer because once steam is on your computer then you're gonna see these

2793
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:32,320
sales civilization three complete edition one dollar and 25 cents buy it

2794
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:36,200
that's what's been getting me well I said when when loom went down to four

2795
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:41,840
bucks you know I was on that yeah and you and dark soccer look dark soccer she

2796
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:46,680
even bought the pink anus game I did by the penis game and you know what it's

2797
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:51,760
crap but she bought it and that's all they care about at the end of the day

2798
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:58,240
yeah it's it's read ratings please people SSJ 100 Matt says can't get any

2799
01:54:58,240 --> 01:55:03,040
cheaper than free unless you're Yaris mmm true SAG in our term says they needed

2800
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:06,960
to demonstrate the steam play concept so it's free on both platforms absolutely

2801
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:13,040
it's kind of the Trojan horse but you know it it it's a win-win situation you

2802
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:16,760
win because you get a free game and you don't get like I in and to reference the

2803
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:22,400
other chat comment you don't get some crappy free game you get a great game of

2804
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:27,600
the year caliber game for free but the trade-off is they win because they just

2805
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:30,280
installed your thing on your computer so you're not tempted to go get you know

2806
01:55:30,280 --> 01:55:34,920
direct-to-drive or the windows gaming platform which granted I know is not on

2807
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:38,280
the Mac but you know you know what I mean same thing they get that on your

2808
01:55:38,280 --> 01:55:42,080
computer and then you're seeing all the sales and you're like oh shit I can get

2809
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:47,800
torchlight for $10 maybe I should get that so there you go all of that's

2810
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:50,080
available on the Mac some of the other games you might want to check out that

2811
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:56,280
are available on the Mac right now braid let's see is a big one some of the

2812
01:55:56,280 --> 01:56:01,600
Indiana Jones games loom you can play on the Mac now yes salmon max devil's

2813
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:07,360
playhouse tales monkey island season 1 torchlight which I definitely recommend

2814
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:11,400
if you liked if you even just like thought Diablo 2 was kind of cool you

2815
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:16,920
should get torchlight it's pretty much the same fucking game and have a better

2816
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:21,360
set for which of course you know I have a big boner for all things civilization

2817
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:26,680
so I'm excited that the Mac fans can play that on steam well I think that was

2818
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:30,640
I think sit for was already available on the Mac I could be wrong all right more

2819
01:56:30,640 --> 01:56:37,800
news mailbag coming up in a little bit to dark Sakura yes more stuff um this is

2820
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:48,280
about the rating system in Australia there is and actually so fairly I would

2821
01:56:48,280 --> 01:56:54,800
have to say a big percentage approves that there should be 98% actually said

2822
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:59,640
that there should be an r18 plus rating so we're thinking where things are

2823
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:06,160
restricted to 18 and over it's been proposed before but now it's like that

2824
01:57:06,160 --> 01:57:16,160
that's what the people want so who knows but that's there's actually though some

2825
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:22,000
from other special interest groups though that were saying that only 53%

2826
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:33,160
actually approve of it but numbers lie statistics can be budged it's funny you

2827
01:57:33,160 --> 01:57:36,520
talk about statistics because some of the interesting chat comments I'm

2828
01:57:36,520 --> 01:57:39,520
reading right now about the whole steam thing you know they're a little delayed

2829
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:44,320
so we get comments from the last story say is saying now we'll have stats for

2830
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:49,440
how many Mac users will buy games or to clarify publicly accessible stats for

2831
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:55,360
Mac users who will buy games interesting some other comments Robert M says I've

2832
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:58,840
been anticipating torchlight for quite some time but didn't want to invest in

2833
01:57:58,840 --> 01:58:03,600
Windows 7 and partitioning for boot camp donovan says he'll wait for Diablo 3

2834
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:08,800
yourself but I think torchlights pretty good deal with the one thing torchlight

2835
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:13,280
is missing is multiplayer but seriously it's like 10 bucks that's that's great

2836
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:19,040
it's a great deal for a single-player game really is anyhow alright so moving

2837
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:26,160
on with some more news stories looking yes so it's interesting because you

2838
01:58:26,160 --> 01:58:29,880
know there's already been screenshots people are not really screenshots but

2839
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:35,120
people taking pictures of you know Red Dead Redemption because it's been coming

2840
01:58:35,120 --> 01:58:38,920
in early to a few different stores and one of the screenshots or I should say

2841
01:58:38,920 --> 01:58:43,600
box shots that they got of the game on PlayStation 3 shows that there's some

2842
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:48,840
exclusive content included for the PlayStation 3 version now I mean not

2843
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:52,400
trying to sound biased or anything it doesn't sound all that wonderful but

2844
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:56,960
here's what you get you get Solomon's Solomon's folly gang hideout which is

2845
01:58:56,960 --> 01:59:02,160
basically kind of a safe house in the game and then you also get the Walton

2846
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:09,920
gang outfit the Walton gang is the kind of villain in the game and John boy yes

2847
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:14,880
this is exclusive for the PlayStation 3 not quite as wonderful as you know

2848
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:18,960
exclusive download content like that was on Grand Theft Auto episodes from Liberty

2849
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:23,360
City but you know maybe this stuff will come out later on as you know something

2850
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:27,440
paid for on the Xbox 360 I know there is some more free download content coming

2851
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:32,880
out later on so who knows but hey anything extra is kind of good so you

2852
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:35,780
know if you're getting on the ps3 there's a little bonus for you who know

2853
01:59:35,780 --> 01:59:39,760
that it might be enough to sway some people even if it's like a little you

2854
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:43,920
never know people that have both I know it's not that big a deal there's like

2855
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:49,040
other there's tons of outfits you can get in the game and lots of different

2856
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:51,960
things you can find safe houses and stuff I don't really know if this stuff

2857
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:58,080
is really gonna do it for you but whatever if that's me if you really want

2858
01:59:58,080 --> 02:00:02,840
to get into both systems you're not sure which one maybe that's way all right

2859
02:00:02,840 --> 02:00:06,080
some other news coming out this week how many of y'all have seen the movie cube

2860
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:12,960
there's a little in my love cube too but not the original cube no I like the

2861
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:18,800
first one but the second one I okay I'm just to go say a little bit about it

2862
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:23,080
it's it's an indie film and describe what cube is about but you gotta start

2863
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:28,040
with the first one with the first one these people basically wake up in

2864
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:33,080
different rooms that are all there's a hatch above a hatch below and a hatch on

2865
02:00:33,080 --> 02:00:38,800
each wall and it starts off with a pretty gory death because some of the

2866
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:44,360
rooms are trapped and so as it goes they they each run into each other as they go

2867
02:00:44,360 --> 02:00:49,120
through the cube and find out that each of them has a specific skill some people

2868
02:00:49,120 --> 02:00:52,200
have been left with their glasses some people have been left with you know

2869
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:57,000
something in their pocket there's a crazy lady and her skill is being crazy

2870
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:03,880
no she was a doctor right yeah the doctor but um but it's it's that you

2871
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:09,280
know these people are stuck in in the cube and their whole point is trying to

2872
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:13,320
figure out the way out and basically while they're moving from room to room

2873
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:18,000
they all know they had they didn't have what the cube 2 was one with crazy lady

2874
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:24,720
the first one had the autistic boy yes they they basically find out that the

2875
02:01:24,720 --> 02:01:30,600
rooms are moving mm-hmm and then G spoiler that's why it's all I just like

2876
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:35,080
it's like over 10 years old this point and that and that basically the autistic

2877
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:38,880
boy is some sort of savant with numbers and figures out that it's like prime

2878
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:42,920
numbers go into the right room and they figure out which way the rooms are going

2879
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:47,640
to be that lead to the exit right where the exit is so it's all and now cube 2 I

2880
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:51,960
love it because it's called hyper cube meaning a tesseract wait it's not

2881
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:59,800
electric boogaloo no I mean I like that one because I love theoretical physics I

2882
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:03,400
I don't have the brain for the math or anything I just love reading about it

2883
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:06,680
wait so the cube was like traveling through time and space as well exactly

2884
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:11,880
Wow the fourth dimension being time Wow so and it had like this really weird

2885
02:02:11,880 --> 02:02:19,760
ending and also the cube 2 inspired a whole mod for a half-life when they're

2886
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:22,840
a cube zero at some point you were a cute cute the third one was cube zero

2887
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:27,100
which is like a prequel and it was crap okay well how would you like to play a

2888
02:02:27,100 --> 02:02:31,720
video game based off cube she's raising her hand it might actually happen

2889
02:02:31,720 --> 02:02:37,780
believe it or not it's an interview that Vin Vincenzo is his name Vincenzo Natali

2890
02:02:37,780 --> 02:02:41,560
he was the director of the game and he was talking to MTV about the game the

2891
02:02:41,560 --> 02:02:45,920
film splice which is an upcoming movie that he did they for whatever reason

2892
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:49,660
asked him about cube if he ever wanted to revisit the universe he said I would

2893
02:02:49,660 --> 02:02:54,100
very much like to do a cube game I'd love to do a game when I was writing it

2894
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:57,560
with my writing partner we were saying to each other are we writing a film are

2895
02:02:57,560 --> 02:03:00,920
we writing a game it's always been amazing to me that no one has attempted

2896
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:04,420
to turn it into a game I would very much like to do that that's how I would like

2897
02:03:04,420 --> 02:03:06,600
to get back into the cube world I guess that's true because there was the mod

2898
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:11,500
right there's the mod based on hypercube he probably hasn't seen it and someone

2899
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:16,000
actually recreated the end of the movie in using Gary's mod it does have a real

2900
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:20,740
creepster ending to it actually the whole movie is kind of a downer and then

2901
02:03:20,740 --> 02:03:24,940
like like it really leaves you with more questions than you start the movie with

2902
02:03:24,940 --> 02:03:29,100
but it wasn't a bad movie it was just kind of like the fuck look that was my

2903
02:03:29,100 --> 02:03:32,700
reaction at the end was like the well it is what and it's it's a movie that I

2904
02:03:32,700 --> 02:03:36,660
think everyone needs to see at least once you know the movie that leaves you

2905
02:03:36,660 --> 02:03:43,220
talking and for a low-budget movie it was intelligently done I think it's

2906
02:03:43,220 --> 02:03:49,300
definitely one that's a thinker too so would it be a low-budget game well given

2907
02:03:49,300 --> 02:03:53,140
that you probably only need to make you know one environment over and over and

2908
02:03:53,140 --> 02:03:56,860
true well you know when they did when they did how they made the movie cheap

2909
02:03:56,860 --> 02:04:00,820
when they seriously is the same room and they turned them around and when they

2910
02:04:00,820 --> 02:04:05,420
did cube to they it was also relatively expensive they just had those white

2911
02:04:05,420 --> 02:04:11,780
walls of different lights behind them he's easy yeah it you don't nobody has

2912
02:04:11,780 --> 02:04:16,900
to bother by the way with the third movie it's SSJ 100 Matt is suggesting

2913
02:04:16,900 --> 02:04:20,020
Jamie if you like theoretical physics I would tell you to check out the movie

2914
02:04:20,020 --> 02:04:24,020
what the bleep do we know I've heard of that movie I don't want me to see it

2915
02:04:24,020 --> 02:04:27,220
actually you might have to like Netflix that or something all right in the

2916
02:04:27,220 --> 02:04:30,780
meantime though Jamie has no time to Netflix because she has to dive into the

2917
02:04:30,780 --> 02:04:36,220
mailbag and read your emails mailbag orange lounge radio.com every week you

2918
02:04:36,220 --> 02:04:40,140
guys send us emails to our mailbag and dark soccer will jump in read if you

2919
02:04:40,140 --> 02:04:43,500
possibly criticize their grammar and then we'll answer your questions here on

2920
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:47,500
the show again that's mailbag at orange lounge radio.com although more and more

2921
02:04:47,500 --> 02:04:49,980
people have been submitting them through the website recently I guess there's a

2922
02:04:49,980 --> 02:04:53,940
forum you can fill out deep man does deep man makes the magic happen on the

2923
02:04:53,940 --> 02:04:57,500
website and he made it magical where people send us bleeps through the

2924
02:04:57,500 --> 02:05:01,140
website now only in dragon boy is actually dragon boy 69 is actually

2925
02:05:01,140 --> 02:05:05,420
sending us a tech support question and I have to read this because I think I

2926
02:05:05,420 --> 02:05:09,820
don't know if look you'll laugh I'm not sure if you can assist me with my issue

2927
02:05:09,820 --> 02:05:14,780
I have an iMac and just attempted to sign up to your site however when trying

2928
02:05:14,780 --> 02:05:17,820
to log in it goes to white screen with the words invalid token is this because

2929
02:05:17,820 --> 02:05:22,340
I'm on an iMac thank you in advance for any help you can provide me this matter

2930
02:05:22,340 --> 02:05:26,420
um no I don't think it's because you're on an iMac just well we'll help you

2931
02:05:26,420 --> 02:05:30,100
later I've seen the website do that before and I think it's because a lot of

2932
02:05:30,100 --> 02:05:33,060
people hit it at once sometimes like believe it or not we're kind of popular

2933
02:05:33,060 --> 02:05:39,580
use Firefox not Safari also just reload or use your back button and try to log

2934
02:05:39,580 --> 02:05:43,420
in again usually it will kind of work itself out if it keeps doing it to you

2935
02:05:43,420 --> 02:05:47,660
come back after like an hour we honestly don't know what causes it unfortunately

2936
02:05:47,660 --> 02:05:51,420
our website is a popular target for spammers and when they clog up the pipes

2937
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:54,980
with their poop then it kind of prevents the rest of us from logging in but it

2938
02:05:54,980 --> 02:05:58,880
has nothing to do with the fact that you're on an iMac as far as we know the

2939
02:05:58,880 --> 02:06:03,380
websites worked on a Mac for me before it wasn't an iMac granted all right

2940
02:06:03,380 --> 02:06:07,740
hello olr I look forward to your show every week I do have a couple of

2941
02:06:07,740 --> 02:06:13,260
questions for olr what Sega model 1 or 2 or model 3 arcade games urgently needs

2942
02:06:13,260 --> 02:06:18,220
an Xbox Live conversion I'm really looking forward to Daytona USA or scud

2943
02:06:18,220 --> 02:06:23,500
race is it cut is it called super GT in the US I think so also I think super

2944
02:06:23,500 --> 02:06:27,300
hang-on needs a good update like Sega did to outrun I would agree with that

2945
02:06:27,300 --> 02:06:31,940
are you guys okay yeah that's the first one what do you think would make a good

2946
02:06:31,940 --> 02:06:36,980
release if they had some sort of gun control or any of the gun games would be

2947
02:06:36,980 --> 02:06:43,300
good like gun blade or even you know house of the dead or some that kind of

2948
02:06:43,300 --> 02:06:52,500
stuff planet Harrier that's Hikari that I don't care planet Harrier um can we

2949
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:57,740
get doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo no I'm kidding actually that wouldn't be

2950
02:06:57,740 --> 02:07:01,580
bad I mean you could even have steering wheel support maybe it wouldn't have

2951
02:07:01,580 --> 02:07:06,580
drawing that would be cool are you guys planning on a new show for foreign

2952
02:07:06,580 --> 02:07:11,180
listeners after the mishaps of your previous effort that's right wasn't the

2953
02:07:11,180 --> 02:07:15,420
the euro show when the last computer just finally died it exploded yeah that's

2954
02:07:15,420 --> 02:07:20,340
right let's pick a date we will have to do that but it's gonna have to be like

2955
02:07:20,340 --> 02:07:26,420
in June at least yeah it's gonna be something it'll have to be at least June

2956
02:07:26,420 --> 02:07:29,780
because next week I'm gonna literally be running in here at the last second

2957
02:07:29,780 --> 02:07:34,860
because I'm going on a trip but and the weekend after by the way we won't be

2958
02:07:34,860 --> 02:07:38,860
here Memorial Day weekend we will not be here at least I won't be here and I

2959
02:07:38,860 --> 02:07:45,620
think that that's gonna be getting some shush I'm going to Oregon on it on a

2960
02:07:45,620 --> 02:07:49,700
getaway so we're doing that and so I'm not gonna be here and I imagine a lot of

2961
02:07:49,700 --> 02:07:52,220
listeners are probably gonna be doing their vacations and stuff too so we'll

2962
02:07:52,220 --> 02:07:57,420
we'll not be here Memorial Day weekend but sometime either a June maybe July

2963
02:07:57,420 --> 02:08:01,020
maybe like 4th of July weekend or something cuz I'll be a long weekend too

2964
02:08:01,020 --> 02:08:04,820
we can do something we could do something or we should plan it around

2965
02:08:04,820 --> 02:08:09,260
a major holiday you know what we should do is the 4th of July weekend just start

2966
02:08:09,260 --> 02:08:12,660
at 8 in the morning and then finish late at night although Bobby will probably

2967
02:08:12,660 --> 02:08:18,020
want to do a show somewhere in there I figure something out we also need to do

2968
02:08:18,020 --> 02:08:22,400
another like roadshow good times roadshow and last question to dark

2969
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:25,820

2970
02:08:25,820 --> 02:08:37,820
don't know rubber rubber rubber rubber rubber rubber rubber rubber rubber

2971
02:08:37,820 --> 02:08:41,860
making a show nearly every week it's a real relief to listen to olr your

2972
02:08:41,860 --> 02:08:44,800
light-hearted view on things is very welcome in a world that's way too

2973
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:48,500
serious thank you very much for a breeze from Belgium PS was my spelling and

2974
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:54,380
grammar okay you didn't put a question mark at the end of okay other than that

2975
02:08:54,380 --> 02:08:58,460
spot on but he's from Belgium so he gets a little they have question marks in

2976
02:08:58,460 --> 02:09:06,860
Belgium alright funny I question a question from our chat room wetu in our

2977
02:09:06,860 --> 02:09:11,180
chat room asks what is Memorial Day for I don't know if maybe he's Canadian or

2978
02:09:11,180 --> 02:09:13,740
from a foreign country or maybe one of the Americans that doesn't know the

2979
02:09:13,740 --> 02:09:18,620
difference here it is quickly in the u.s. there's two holidays around the Armed

2980
02:09:18,620 --> 02:09:23,140
Services one is Memorial Day one is Veterans Day Memorial Day is a day to

2981
02:09:23,140 --> 02:09:27,620
honor those that have been lost serving the country in the Armed Forces and you

2982
02:09:27,620 --> 02:09:32,500
know most notably wars like Vietnam World War two etc memorial is for those

2983
02:09:32,500 --> 02:09:36,580
that have passed away veterans is to honor oh and what who wants to clarify

2984
02:09:36,580 --> 02:09:42,900
from New Zealand Veterans Day is the day that is that's in November and that's

2985
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:47,580
the day to honor those that are still serving or you know alive and used to

2986
02:09:47,580 --> 02:09:50,820
serve you know a veteran so one for those that have passed away one for

2987
02:09:50,820 --> 02:09:54,980
those that are still alive basically in other words Memorial Day would be like

2988
02:09:54,980 --> 02:10:00,540
for my papa mm-hmm and my grandfather and Veterans Day would be like for my

2989
02:10:00,540 --> 02:10:08,420
brother but both days great sales at Macy's tell me I'm wrong tell me I'm

2990
02:10:08,420 --> 02:10:16,380
wrong I just read back a message from Becky said I made her snort by saying

2991
02:10:16,380 --> 02:10:20,740
there's question marks in Belgium there are indeed question marks in Belgium

2992
02:10:20,740 --> 02:10:27,060
you're right okay um this one comes I'm just gonna say from Laco and cuz they

2993
02:10:27,060 --> 02:10:30,020
didn't put any other name it's been well since I've had a chance to email you

2994
02:10:30,020 --> 02:10:35,220
guys last time Loki had turned me under earth defense force on 360 what Oh still

2995
02:10:35,220 --> 02:10:38,220
playing by the way my question is in regards to the zombie talk from last

2996
02:10:38,220 --> 02:10:43,100
week you guys talked about what music would kill zombies to but where would

2997
02:10:43,100 --> 02:10:47,260
you set up HQ my roommate and I have argued between a super Walmart a mall

2998
02:10:47,260 --> 02:10:52,580
and a Costco PS sorry if the grammar is bad had a 14-hour work day and typing in

2999
02:10:52,580 --> 02:10:58,260
the dark so that I do not wake the wife good husband and and by the way I only

3000
02:10:58,260 --> 02:11:03,860
give people a hard time they're really really really crappy where would I set

3001
02:11:03,860 --> 02:11:09,500
up shop sorry I was flooding the chat room because they needed a they needed

3002
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:14,820
a spanking what was the question here it's we talked about what music we would

3003
02:11:14,820 --> 02:11:19,020
kill zombies to but where would we set up HQ my roommate and I wouldn't argued

3004
02:11:19,020 --> 02:11:26,380
as super Walmart a mall or Costco well dead rising was set in a mall and I

3005
02:11:26,380 --> 02:11:30,500
guess that did pretty well for Frank West say an amusement park like

3006
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:36,180
zombieland that would be fun or a museum might be fun too and especially scary

3007
02:11:36,180 --> 02:11:42,060
and who'd look for me in a museum it's the zoo Fort Knox

3008
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:52,580
oh good good guess area 51 or the equivalent of wherever it is video 54 so

3009
02:11:52,580 --> 02:11:58,180
you can get your club on and kill zombies my mom's house the space shuttle

3010
02:11:58,180 --> 02:12:05,820
try to get me up here zombies Rob Rob why are there zombies outside Rob Rob

3011
02:12:05,820 --> 02:12:10,580
get rid of the zombies do you know this neighborhood has already gone to hell

3012
02:12:10,580 --> 02:12:15,700
why are there zombies out front Rob she would annoy them away it would be great

3013
02:12:15,700 --> 02:12:21,140
here zombies would never make it in the south especially out in the rural south

3014
02:12:21,140 --> 02:12:26,020
just because of how many people have freaking guns probably be some good

3015
02:12:26,020 --> 02:12:32,380
eating the New Orleans anyway Oh Rob uh no not Rob above Rob above us send us an

3016
02:12:32,380 --> 02:12:35,840
email yeah okay here we go I listen to your conversation about the black we

3017
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:39,820
bundle leak in quotes the correspondence between an 10 on GameStop sounded

3018
02:12:39,820 --> 02:12:44,580
totally fake ie viral marketing Nintendo bad dog that leak totally advertised our

3019
02:12:44,580 --> 02:12:49,260
new bundle a very convenient week before release GameStop we fired the guy I

3020
02:12:49,260 --> 02:12:53,660
will never do it again unless you ask us to again and did okay but just this once

3021
02:12:53,660 --> 02:12:59,500
well played also Nintendo knows after all these years how to prevent this type

3022
02:12:59,500 --> 02:13:04,620
of leak sending the promo standees every week ahead of time sounded intentional

3023
02:13:04,620 --> 02:13:10,940
Rob above yep probably was and the more and more I hear about it the more and

3024
02:13:10,940 --> 02:13:14,500
more I think it was just kind of like one of those like leaks to actually get

3025
02:13:14,500 --> 02:13:17,740
people talking about the black we can I read some chat comments because these

3026
02:13:17,740 --> 02:13:22,060
are pretty funny do it all right Donovan suggested these are all about the

3027
02:13:22,060 --> 02:13:26,340
zombies and where would you set up shop one of my buddies from Alabama by the

3028
02:13:26,340 --> 02:13:30,580

Donovan from under station live but he wouldn't listen to his one of my mate

3030
02:13:34,900 --> 02:13:38,060
one of my major geek buddies and one of the people responsible for making me a

3031
02:13:38,060 --> 02:13:42,500
bigger nerd then I literally he's a geek if he's listening to this show well a

3032
02:13:42,500 --> 02:13:46,700
hearty hello heart as California as California kids have done a good job of

3042
02:14:32,940 --> 02:14:36,260
they're just like you random random random the zombies would have to be

3043
02:14:36,260 --> 02:14:40,340
carrying cocaine to get in basically yeah zombies don't need cocaine they're

3044
02:14:40,340 --> 02:14:44,540
already act like crackheads yeah you know what just popped in my head though

02:15:01,820 --> 02:15:05,380
carpenter but I have to tell you something I love Wednesdays and

3049

3058
02:15:57,020 --> 02:16:01,820
you and this you know my mom my mom this is what you know my mom probably would

3059
02:16:01,820 --> 02:16:06,940
have Rob you shouldn't say that rock she's like secretly laughing she was

3060
02:16:06,940 --> 02:16:11,900
thinking that my mom would probably try to stifle the giggles you know like you

3061
02:16:11,900 --> 02:16:14,960
do when you're at church exactly actually that was me at church

3062
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:20,660
tackling my giggles I'm sitting in your own pew no usually I was sneaking out

3063
02:16:20,660 --> 02:16:24,540
and going to hang out in the church library to read like the real stuff

3064
02:16:24,540 --> 02:16:29,500
anyway all I know you might might you know and I I don't want to get all

3065
02:16:29,500 --> 02:16:36,180
religious see on the show but I will see super book that was my show growing up

3066
02:16:36,180 --> 02:16:43,460
super book flying house that was it all right actually and for the record I did

3067
02:16:43,460 --> 02:16:48,180
used to sneak out of church and hang out in the church library reading like well

3068
02:16:48,180 --> 02:16:50,900
would you go to hell for that though I don't think you would because like

3069
02:16:50,900 --> 02:16:56,620
you're still like doing churchy things well because no at the tender age of 10

3070
02:16:56,620 --> 02:17:01,340
years old and and this you know I'm not making it any type of a secret I'm

3071
02:17:01,340 --> 02:17:08,840
converting to to Judaism eventually mm-hmm I I was sort of like these were

3072
02:17:08,840 --> 02:17:13,020
translated from Greek wasn't it written in Hebrew and then going out in the

3073
02:17:13,020 --> 02:17:38,460
library and look everything up so that was me anyway

3074
02:17:38,460 --> 02:17:48,180
on the 700 Club Rob I know I know and I was a kid it was totally old-school

3075
02:17:48,180 --> 02:17:51,600
anime you know if you think about it like you know it's some pretty badass

3076
02:17:51,600 --> 02:17:54,900
shit happens in that cartoon you know this guy's just like splitting the ocean

3077
02:17:54,900 --> 02:17:58,300
in half like you know transformers didn't do that shit it's totally

3078
02:17:58,300 --> 02:18:06,300
old-school anime all right anyway um I'm over it God everybody everybody gets too

3079
02:18:06,300 --> 02:18:12,940
too tense when it comes to religious topics have fun I just stopped just I

3083
02:18:27,340 --> 02:18:32,060
wanted to be a rabbi all right let's move on let's move on I couldn't be an

3084
02:18:32,060 --> 02:18:35,260
Orthodox rabbi but look two things you shouldn't talk about on a video game

3085
02:18:35,260 --> 02:18:39,100

watching a video and laughing at it oh this is the actual song the world's

3111
02:21:10,100 --> 02:21:21,700
combined harvester should be like the new email do we have more emails oh good

3112
02:21:21,700 --> 02:21:25,220
read the email to this song I'm gonna have to find that song now we need to

3113
02:21:25,220 --> 02:21:32,460
use that for we need to do that for our ridiculous news okay ever since I

3114
02:21:32,460 --> 02:21:35,020
started listening to internet radio almost ten years ago I have always

3115
02:21:35,020 --> 02:21:39,420
dreamed about listening to shoutcast net stations in my car when I found first

3116
02:21:39,420 --> 02:21:43,340
came out I was excited to learn that it can play streaming radio however I

3117
02:21:43,340 --> 02:21:46,820
didn't have the money to get one a couple months ago I finally decided that

3118
02:21:46,820 --> 02:21:52,220
I wanted to purchase one with some of my tax return money after I heard about the

3119
02:21:52,220 --> 02:21:55,860
supposed 4g version of the iPhone being found at a bar I was hesitant to buy

3120
02:21:55,860 --> 02:21:59,780
knowing that this version may be released very soon since I haven't heard

3121
02:21:59,780 --> 02:22:03,860
anything new about it in a while I don't know what I should do do you think this

3122
02:22:03,860 --> 02:22:07,140
leak is delaying the 4g version to come out or do you think was just a marketing

3123
02:22:07,140 --> 02:22:10,940
employed by Apple we're going to hear more about it very soon I just don't

3124
02:22:10,940 --> 02:22:14,460
want to buy the 3gs and then a couple months later see a 4g version release

3125
02:22:14,460 --> 02:22:20,780
and screw me over your fellow gamer girl Ziba well I bought a 3g a couple months

3126
02:22:20,780 --> 02:22:26,980
ago rumor is Job's was pissed and like called gizmodo himself that's one of the

3127
02:22:26,980 --> 02:22:30,340
latest rumors that was on the blogs this week but whatever believe it or not I

3128
02:22:30,340 --> 02:22:36,140
don't care the fact is fact Apple will release information about a new phone in

3129
02:22:36,140 --> 02:22:41,300
June so my suggestion if you think you can hold off until June the end of June

3130
02:22:41,300 --> 02:22:44,700
which is only about a month away at this point if you can hold off like one month

3131
02:22:44,700 --> 02:22:48,900
you're in good shape you'll be fine and then you'll you'll have a better idea

3132
02:22:48,900 --> 02:22:54,860
what to expect the only other suggestion I really have is that keep in mind that

3133
02:22:54,860 --> 02:22:59,060
iPhones not your only option you know they do have like two wraps I think for

3134
02:22:59,060 --> 02:23:06,020
blackberries and the droid I mean the other phones have them too I don't know

3135
02:23:06,020 --> 02:23:09,240
I wasn't feeling the song for mailbag music we're gonna have to we'll find a

3136
02:23:09,240 --> 02:23:12,780
purpose for it on the show though it's a good song okay and that's it we're gonna

3137
02:23:12,780 --> 02:23:16,980
find a use for that somewhere yeah by the way you know I was so distracted

3138
02:23:16,980 --> 02:23:20,900
earlier in part a hmm it's because I was reading a friend's live journal and she

3139
02:23:20,900 --> 02:23:28,580
had pictures up of what's it root root beat the the new Bimani game Oh you beat

3140
02:23:28,580 --> 02:23:35,420
you beat yeah and it looked very cubicle it looks oh oh yeah our friend Japan is

3141
02:23:35,420 --> 02:23:39,860
that that was um yeah you beat is kind of one of those games I'd like to play

3142
02:23:39,860 --> 02:23:42,940
at some point where they testing it in the US and then they just kind of stopped

3143
02:23:42,940 --> 02:23:50,980
I guess I don't know well she listed as do beat or maybe it's you as in like the

3144
02:23:50,980 --> 02:23:58,540
the Spanish J I don't know um I I would say that there might be a chance at e3

3145
02:23:58,540 --> 02:24:02,660
sometimes if Konami's got a lot of Bimani games they want to show they'll

3146
02:24:02,660 --> 02:24:06,980
roll out a lot of machines at e3 supernova they did they brought they

3147
02:24:06,980 --> 02:24:14,100
brought a beat me to DX machine in 2006 I think it was six sometimes they'll

3148
02:24:14,100 --> 02:24:19,100
bring them to e3 for awareness I don't know why it started show but the Japanese

3149
02:24:19,100 --> 02:24:25,500
games it was distorted yeah they brought to e3 one year and that was the new game

3150
02:24:25,500 --> 02:24:31,660
that was on Japan yeah so we'll see but you beat I don't think is and it's not

3151
02:24:31,660 --> 02:24:40,620
juby because I know but a lot of people because it's juby go juby I've seen

3152
02:24:40,620 --> 02:24:44,380
people spell it both ways and besides that I would I wouldn't have known if I

3153
02:24:44,380 --> 02:24:50,020
hadn't if I hadn't seen the Kana for it so but it's yeah yeah I'd like to check

3154
02:24:50,020 --> 02:24:55,100
it out at some point but probably never will oh yeah and they actually called it

3155
02:24:55,100 --> 02:24:57,900
in the limited location test they actually called it in dark to see it

3156
02:24:57,900 --> 02:25:02,180
clarifies in chat you beat with like a you and that's not a bad name for a game

3157
02:25:02,180 --> 02:25:10,100
but it could be taken many ways so you beat what we're 12 all right this is the

3158
02:25:10,100 --> 02:25:13,820
part of the show where we get a little bit angsty because I don't know we've

3159
02:25:13,820 --> 02:25:32,620
just been that way for eight years so deal with it it's the F use the week

3160
02:25:32,620 --> 02:25:39,260
if he goes to allergies and the city of Dixon namely they're pollen

3161
02:25:39,260 --> 02:25:45,980
locate after you too bad CD dumps

3162
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:53,260
I don't know like overall I've had a pretty good week but in the past couple

3163
02:25:53,260 --> 02:25:57,980
days like like mother nature or whoever has it out for me out there was just

3164
02:25:57,980 --> 02:26:03,460
kind of like I'm gonna kick you in the balls but actually you know what all

3165
02:26:03,460 --> 02:26:10,340
things considered things could be a lot worse and I don't have it so bad so I'm

3166
02:26:10,340 --> 02:26:15,100
not that angsty but I will say an F you know there was something that it ticked

3167
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:17,660
me off the other day and I was like that's gonna be my F you the week on oil

3168
02:26:17,660 --> 02:26:19,940
I ride now I can't remember what it was so I guess they didn't make me that

3169
02:26:19,940 --> 02:26:26,460
angsty F you to the fact that I still don't go out and buy a new car okay I've

3170
02:26:26,460 --> 02:26:29,420
been saying I'm gonna do it for like a year and I still have it if you to

3171
02:26:29,420 --> 02:26:35,620
myself all right let's get into a couple more stories and then oh god your calls

3172
02:26:35,620 --> 02:26:40,620
1877 game olr after a couple more stories here the skype line will be open

3173
02:26:40,620 --> 02:26:45,660
at orange lounge radio on skype or 1877 game olr but at first a couple more

3174
02:26:45,660 --> 02:26:51,180
stories looking I'm sure with infinity war going there not really going there

3175
02:26:51,180 --> 02:26:55,740
separate ways but they're kind of dissolving if you know what I mean I'm

3176
02:26:55,740 --> 02:26:59,140
sure they're going to treat the call of duty franchise with the utmost respect

3177
02:26:59,140 --> 02:27:04,060
although you kind of wonder with all these different domain names that

3178
02:27:04,060 --> 02:27:07,380
they're registering and I'm sure a lot of it's just to kind of make sure that

3179
02:27:07,380 --> 02:27:13,100
people aren't squatting on the moon the domains but a little bit kind of weird

3180
02:27:13,100 --> 02:27:17,740
okay like for example they have registered different variations for

3181
02:27:17,740 --> 02:27:23,180
quality including Call of Duty future warfare advanced warfare secret warfare

3182
02:27:23,180 --> 02:27:29,340
and space warfare as well as those same names with two and three appended to the

3183
02:27:29,340 --> 02:27:37,220
end space warfare really every weird

3184
02:27:38,340 --> 02:27:47,980
space warfare huh space warfare Call of Duty in space well that's got to be

3185
02:27:47,980 --> 02:27:52,300
better than vagina warfare no I'm being completely serious right now there's a

3186
02:27:52,300 --> 02:28:00,020
new game out and it's about vagina it's a game called privates it's on the PC

3187
02:28:00,020 --> 02:28:05,300
and apparently it's coming to the Xbox 360 I don't know how the hell this is

3188
02:28:05,300 --> 02:28:08,700
happening but apparently it's coming to 360 or at least that's what the

3189
02:28:08,700 --> 02:28:16,980
developers would tell you it's zombie cow studios it is quote you lead a teeny

3190
02:28:16,980 --> 02:28:21,940
tiny gang of condom-hatted Marines as they delve into people's vaginas and

3191
02:28:21,940 --> 02:28:26,900
bottoms oh I see it's equal opportunity and blast away at all manner of oozy

3192
02:28:26,900 --> 02:28:37,380
shouty monsters so you will be able to shoot the monsters that live inside the

3193
02:28:37,380 --> 02:28:45,460
vagina take this yeast infection yeah actually you will be able to blast all

3194
02:28:45,460 --> 02:28:49,620
manners of grody infections this looks like it looks like a sperm looks fucking

3195
02:28:49,620 --> 02:28:55,060
gross like an evil sperm I'm all for like you know pushing the envelope and

3196
02:28:55,060 --> 02:29:05,060
everything of good taste but this is just stupid like really really stupid

3197
02:29:05,060 --> 02:29:08,860
but you know I'll have to play it at least once you're shooting sperm you're

3198
02:29:08,860 --> 02:29:13,980
shooting evil spur look at that they're evil sperm yes they are they are evil

3199
02:29:13,980 --> 02:29:17,940
sperm I should make how the hell is this coming out on Xbox I'm gonna make a

3200
02:29:17,940 --> 02:29:21,340
live journal icon out of one of these evil sperm this is not coming out on the

3201
02:29:21,340 --> 02:29:25,140
360 I don't know who the hell they think they're kidding but there's no way this

3202
02:29:25,140 --> 02:29:30,340
game would not get an M or like a o rating and Microsoft has it in their

3203
02:29:30,340 --> 02:29:33,700
thing that a o games will not be released and even if they try to do it

3204
02:29:33,700 --> 02:29:36,980
as an indie game it will not get past the review board who the hell do they

3205
02:29:36,980 --> 02:29:42,500
think they're kidding it's kind of funny though in a 12 year old sort of way I

3206
02:29:42,500 --> 02:29:47,160
mean that's that's the that's the whole point right all right let's open up the

talking a little bit about a movie coming for a game franchise well this

3214
02:30:21,420 --> 02:30:26,060
isn't necessarily a game franchise that's getting in a movie but it has

3215
02:30:26,060 --> 02:30:31,580
game stuff in it and that would be that wonderful short film pixels hold on

3216
02:30:31,580 --> 02:30:35,660
collar we'll get to you in just a moment pixels which featured Donkey Kong

Frogger space invaders and different stuff from Arkanoid that's being

3218
02:30:39,100 --> 02:30:43,380
actually made into a full-length movie now yeah I was reading about that the

3219
02:30:43,380 --> 02:30:47,220
other day that's pretty cool yeah happy mess and actually picked it up all right

3220
02:30:47,220 --> 02:30:49,940
let me go to the phone call are you there hi hello you're on orange launch

3221
02:30:49,940 --> 02:30:57,180
radio who's this this is Rob Rob hey I like your name what's up Rob I am

3222
02:30:57,180 --> 02:31:01,780
getting feedback I'm gonna have to hang up oh no okay with that with I have echo

3223
02:31:01,780 --> 02:31:05,820
one two three give echo one two three a call and hopefully that will work and

3224
02:31:05,820 --> 02:31:09,920
that's a good good reference for anybody who's thinking about calling the show

3225
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:14,380
call echo one two three on skype before you call and hopefully that'll fix

3226
02:31:14,380 --> 02:31:18,260
whatever problem you're getting sometimes folks will get a little bit of

3227
02:31:18,260 --> 02:31:22,180
echo because just you know a little bit of background as to way we do it here at

3228
02:31:22,180 --> 02:31:26,820
orange andreo we have speakers in studio we do not wear headsets because we

3229
02:31:26,820 --> 02:31:30,380
there's too many of us to have headsets especially if we have a guest so we do

3230
02:31:30,380 --> 02:31:34,540
have in-house speakers so sometimes you will like hear yourself over the speaker

3231
02:31:34,540 --> 02:31:38,900
and it's a little crazy so do be aware of that if you call in and kind of hear

3232
02:31:38,900 --> 02:31:42,820
yourself all right let's try again hi you're on

3233
02:31:42,820 --> 02:31:49,540
orange on its radio who's this hey this is Rob again oh it's Rob above yeah the

3234
02:31:49,540 --> 02:31:55,620
right I the Rob above are you still getting feedback no I I was listening to

3235
02:31:55,620 --> 02:31:59,940
the show I had to turn off the feed so I could hear you ah yes that's a good

3236
02:31:59,940 --> 02:32:03,260
thing just like when you call real radio you have to turn off your speakers so

3237
02:32:03,260 --> 02:32:07,280
that will happen well hey I'm glad you're calling in Rob above what's on

3238
02:32:07,280 --> 02:32:12,780
your mind okay well first of all I saw you and Bobby playing 3d game heroes to

3239
02:32:12,780 --> 02:32:20,020
this afternoon yeah and have you gotten to Ortego town it's the second town is

3240
02:32:20,020 --> 02:32:25,700
that the one in the desert yes is that the one with the um foo foo sequence or

3241
02:32:25,700 --> 02:32:30,540
whatever it was called poof poof poof poof poof that's it it was the poof poof

3242
02:32:30,540 --> 02:32:36,300
sequence is is that what you might have been inquiring about yeah I thought that

3243
02:32:36,300 --> 02:32:41,660
was hilarious and also really dirty it was very dirty okay in mine like I don't

3244
02:32:41,660 --> 02:32:45,740
know if it was just the way I was playing but when he woke up from poof

3245
02:32:45,740 --> 02:32:50,860
poof it was the chicks dad was there and saying doesn't he give really good

3246
02:32:50,860 --> 02:32:57,820
massages like I was like this game is filthy absolutely filthy yeah that's what

3247
02:32:57,820 --> 02:33:02,340
I thought too and in fact they used massages the same way that incredible

3248
02:33:02,340 --> 02:33:08,220
crisis used massages to mean something else mm-hmm exactly well what do you

3249
02:33:08,220 --> 02:33:11,340
think of 3d game heroes obviously you've played a little bit if you've made it to

3250
02:33:11,340 --> 02:33:17,660
poof poof um I'm enjoying it at a Zelda level but it doesn't seem to to go much

3251
02:33:17,660 --> 02:33:23,380
beyond Zelda weren't you a little bit like just slightly disappointed at the

3252
02:33:23,380 --> 02:33:27,100
customization features in it like maybe I'm just being a greedy bastard but I

3253
02:33:27,100 --> 02:33:30,720
was kind of like you know again we live in an era of little big planet and I was

3254
02:33:30,720 --> 02:33:34,440
kind of disappointed that the only thing you get to change is the way the hero

3255
02:33:34,440 --> 02:33:38,760
looks like I was kind of thinking like maybe I'm crazy but that there would

3256
02:33:38,760 --> 02:33:43,580
have been more customizability to it yeah I was a little disappointed in that

3257
02:33:43,580 --> 02:33:48,360
too I knew it wasn't there but I was still disappointed right well at least

3258
02:33:48,360 --> 02:33:52,020
it was only $40 you know it was a budget game I still like yeah I think you're

3259
02:33:52,020 --> 02:33:55,200
right on a Zelda level though I mean if you want a great Zelda clone this is

3260
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:59,380
definitely I'm one of the best Zelda clones I've ever played Agdeft in our

3261
02:33:59,380 --> 02:34:05,380
chat room says death by poof poof well I have one more thing to say and I'm gonna

3262
02:34:05,380 --> 02:34:11,540
post a link in the chat yes there was some story on digital times about or

3263
02:34:11,540 --> 02:34:20,380
digi times about 10 million iPhones being ordered by Apple of course and

3264
02:34:20,380 --> 02:34:28,580
that they they work on the Verizon type network wait a minute way wait a minute

3265
02:34:28,580 --> 02:34:32,420
I thought and I could have sworn I read this earlier this week and I'm looking

3266
02:34:32,420 --> 02:34:35,300
at I'm looking at your story right now I'm pulling it up but I thought that the

3267
02:34:35,300 --> 02:34:39,380
AT&T came out and like laid it on the table and said you know what bitches

3268
02:34:39,380 --> 02:34:43,700
we're under contract till 2012 so you needed to stfu when it comes to this

3269
02:34:43,700 --> 02:34:52,180
whole Verizon talk yeah but not if they call it an iPad mini that's but anyway

3270
02:34:52,180 --> 02:34:57,740
but funny yeah I don't think 10 million I think it's fake because 10 million is

3271
02:34:57,740 --> 02:35:04,020
a really bad number to order at startup it would be more like two two to five I

3272
02:35:04,020 --> 02:35:08,900
agree didn't the iPad didn't even have that many I mean it was far less like

3273
02:35:08,900 --> 02:35:13,780
not even a million iPads did they order right away I just yeah something strikes

3274
02:35:13,780 --> 02:35:17,620
me as fishy about this too but I just thought about it because you talked

3275
02:35:17,620 --> 02:35:21,740
about it earlier no it's it's you know and and like it or not iPhone is a

3276
02:35:21,740 --> 02:35:26,140
gaming platform and needs to be recognized especially we're seeing ports

3277
02:35:26,140 --> 02:35:29,540
of so many not just classic but new I mean there's it you can get Street

3278
02:35:29,540 --> 02:35:33,700
Fighter 4 on the friggin iPhone it's if you if you don't consider the iPhone a

3279
02:35:33,700 --> 02:35:38,620
gaming platform at this point you are behind the times yes sir

username on skype is orange launch radio we can take a few more calls here

3286
02:36:05,540 --> 02:36:11,660
Loki see I gave him a pass on some of the Skype etiquette and so forth cuz a I

3287
02:36:11,660 --> 02:36:16,100
know he's listening to the show forever and be you know if it's your first time

3288
02:36:16,100 --> 02:36:21,300
calling in I'll give you a pass on some of that stuff so all is forgiven hi

3289
02:36:21,300 --> 02:36:25,900
you're on orange launch radio who's this hey what's up guys this is cut judo hey

3290
02:36:25,900 --> 02:36:30,260
what's up what's on your mind not much first of all I just want to say that

3291
02:36:30,260 --> 02:36:37,940
what was the game you're just talking about the Zelda 3d heroes yeah I call

3292
02:36:37,940 --> 02:36:44,620
that basically Lego Zelda it's a confusing game I I mean I I understand

3293
02:36:44,620 --> 02:36:47,860
that they it was kind of like a love letter to Zelda and all the other games

3294
02:36:47,860 --> 02:36:52,660
from back in the day so I you know I'm not you know I'm not knocking them for

3295
02:36:52,660 --> 02:36:56,820
making what everyone's calling the Zelda clone but just the look of it just it

3296
02:36:56,820 --> 02:37:01,980
looks really shitty man I mean it looks like our RPG maker for PlayStation 2 you

3297
02:37:01,980 --> 02:37:04,780
know any bad looking games and I don't know if you heard my review earlier in

3298
02:37:04,780 --> 02:37:08,020
the show but that's kind of one thing you know I do like the game and I do

3299
02:37:08,020 --> 02:37:11,140
recommend the game but one of its you know it's not a perfect game and one of

3300
02:37:11,140 --> 02:37:15,140
its imperfections is you know it still just kind of looks like a PlayStation 2

3301
02:37:15,140 --> 02:37:21,060
game and you know to some extent there's you know when you're doing retro I get

3302
02:37:21,060 --> 02:37:23,420
there's probably that the the audience that's sitting there listen to this

3303
02:37:23,420 --> 02:37:28,220
right now going well shit Rob if you're doing a retro style game what the hell

3304
02:37:28,220 --> 02:37:33,080
do you expect them to do and I don't know one thing might be like a free

3305
02:37:33,080 --> 02:37:37,660
roaming camera as opposed to four fixed cameras you get to pick from and yes I

3306
02:37:37,660 --> 02:37:40,620
understand you get to do them in screenshots but I don't know it seems

3307
02:37:40,620 --> 02:37:44,760
like they did have some optimization problems because again frame skip in a

3308
02:37:44,760 --> 02:37:49,820
dungeon that's not okay you know just tone down the water effects they didn't

3309
02:37:49,820 --> 02:37:54,420
need to be that awesome you know yeah I mean yeah that that game I'm pretty sure

3310
02:37:54,420 --> 02:37:58,920
is giving a lot of people seizures with the water I mean I can't even make out

3311
02:37:58,920 --> 02:38:02,020
what I'm looking at half the time you know it's I don't know it's just a

3312
02:38:02,020 --> 02:38:06,180
really weird creepy looking game to me I mean I was never into the Zelda games

3313
02:38:06,180 --> 02:38:11,140
to begin with so I would never pick it up but um it's just strange I don't

3314
02:38:11,140 --> 02:38:15,260
something off with it yeah I mean right on that's part if you weren't into Zelda

3315
02:38:15,260 --> 02:38:19,820
there ain't nothing here for you 3d I mean just just walk right on by there

3316
02:38:19,820 --> 02:38:24,580
ain't nothing here for you yeah and that and that sword is maybe the worst weapon

3317
02:38:24,580 --> 02:38:28,380
I've ever seen in a video game just just the look of it it's just over the time

3318
02:38:28,380 --> 02:38:31,740
yeah I mean I can't knock it too much because I haven't played it maybe

3319
02:38:31,740 --> 02:38:34,860
playing it you actually get some enjoyment out of it but looking at it I

3320
02:38:34,860 --> 02:38:40,620
literally wanted to puke on the television screen the best looking game

3321
02:38:40,620 --> 02:38:44,060
the best thing I could compare that sword to is just this more it's just

3322
02:38:44,060 --> 02:38:48,140
another low moment you know you did in that game is a lot of lol moments and

3323
02:38:48,140 --> 02:38:51,740
this that the ridiculous sword is just another one of them you just kind of

3324
02:38:51,740 --> 02:38:55,460
sit there and doesn't the sword doesn't the sword get bigger as you level up or

3325
02:38:55,460 --> 02:38:58,600
something like that you can go to a blacksmith and get your sword you can

3326
02:38:58,600 --> 02:39:02,300
alter the length and width of your sword and I was just waiting for earth I was

3327
02:39:02,300 --> 02:39:07,580
waiting for girth to be an option too but no way you can modify the beam that

3328
02:39:07,580 --> 02:39:12,700
it fires but um you can go to a blacksmith and get some of that altered

3329
02:39:12,700 --> 02:39:17,980
all right and my last comment is uh are you guys getting uh what is it red

3330
02:39:17,980 --> 02:39:21,460
dimension something uh I'm getting I can't remember the name but I'm

3331
02:39:21,460 --> 02:39:25,000
definitely getting it I know how sorry it's always yeah I'm absolutely good at

3332
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:28,460
all again you already have it right I already have it yeah my boss is getting

3333
02:39:28,460 --> 02:39:32,420
another copy too because I think I've got one free for my work nice look it

3334
02:39:32,420 --> 02:39:36,620
must be nice is it like is it GPA in the wild west because that's basically what

3335
02:39:36,620 --> 02:39:40,100
I want that's all it needs to be for me um yeah it pretty much I mean it doesn't

3336
02:39:40,100 --> 02:39:43,820
play exactly like deep GTA but I mean there's a lot of similarities and I mean

3337
02:39:43,820 --> 02:39:50,260
it's not as like intense as GTA I mean there's a lot of me it's more open world

3338
02:39:50,260 --> 02:39:53,180
but there's not as much in the open world because obviously it's the Wild

3339
02:39:53,180 --> 02:39:57,940
West not like a bustling city but it's awesome and it looks like graphics wise

3340
02:39:57,940 --> 02:40:02,780
it's way better than GTA so it's pretty amazing I've ever GTA I was like wow

3341
02:40:02,780 --> 02:40:06,660
look at that I can look across the you know the river and see all these

3342
02:40:06,660 --> 02:40:10,380
different monuments and stuff like that and it just looks amazing so it'll be

3343
02:40:10,380 --> 02:40:13,820
awesome yeah yeah GP I live in New York and I

3344
02:40:13,820 --> 02:40:16,980
remember there was playing one multiplayer game and actually ran

3345
02:40:16,980 --> 02:40:20,740
through a little section that actually used to hang out when I you know I used

3346
02:40:20,740 --> 02:40:24,380
to hang out in that area when I was a kid and actually knew where to sneak

3347
02:40:24,380 --> 02:40:28,220
around and avoid people and you know avoid getting shot that's kind of a

3348
02:40:28,220 --> 02:40:36,140
creepy like I'm in a good way but that's Wow games are too realistic yeah I've

3349
02:40:36,140 --> 02:40:41,620
taken up enough of your time no I love the show we love the call have a good

3350
02:40:41,620 --> 02:40:45,940
one have a good night buddy all right all right some good calls tonight one

3351
02:40:45,940 --> 02:40:50,460
eight seven seven game olr username on skype orange lounge radio act deaf in

3352
02:40:50,460 --> 02:40:55,140
our chat room says I want a free copy of 3d dog game heroes I liked by the way I

3353
02:40:55,140 --> 02:40:59,460
like that last caller's comparison to Lego Zelda I think was a great

3354
02:40:59,460 --> 02:41:03,260
comparison that was funny and Donovan in chat says actually Lego Zelda sounds

3355
02:41:03,260 --> 02:41:07,620
like it could be fun especially with the Lego game sense of humor I that comment

3356
02:41:07,620 --> 02:41:11,140
actually kind of I think hits the nail on the head it's it's pretty pretty

3357
02:41:11,140 --> 02:41:17,540
accurate let's see Donovan says hmm Lego Wow just as fun of a joke game says the

3358
02:41:17,540 --> 02:41:23,340
guy who's all tabbing out of Wow to type in here addict Jamie you make friends

3359
02:41:23,340 --> 02:41:27,260
with a lot of Wow addicts I gotta say I know what's up with that more people

3360
02:41:27,260 --> 02:41:30,780
playing Star Trek online with me I still have the card I'm gonna use it at some

3361
02:41:30,780 --> 02:41:34,620
point but probably after Memorial Day because if I use it now I've got too

3362
02:41:34,620 --> 02:41:38,500
many trips coming up I'm going on two weekend trips back to back so I've got

3363
02:41:38,500 --> 02:41:43,500
to calm down and actually spend time playing the game and then I got a three

3364
02:41:43,500 --> 02:41:46,700
coming up to I got to worry about that I'm gonna be gone a week for that good

3365
02:41:46,700 --> 02:41:51,180
times oil are at e3 we don't know what we're doing yet but we'll have the

3366
02:41:51,180 --> 02:41:55,860
unfortunately it won't be Loki and Dark Sakura so we won't unfortunately be able

3367
02:41:55,860 --> 02:41:59,940
to bring you something collectively unless maybe there's like some type of

3368
02:41:59,940 --> 02:42:03,700
I don't know maybe we'll do something over Skype because you know Loki Dark

3369
02:42:03,700 --> 02:42:07,560
Sakura will probably be able to follow the news almost better online than I

3370
02:42:07,560 --> 02:42:10,140
will be being at the show but we are gonna hopefully bring you some cool

3371
02:42:10,140 --> 02:42:14,220
interviews at the show at least that is the idea Loki do you have any other last

3372
02:42:14,220 --> 02:42:21,260
minute stories over there that we can get to all we wait for some more calls

3373
02:42:21,260 --> 02:42:24,940
this is kind of actually ties in a little bit with the last order talking

3374
02:42:24,940 --> 02:42:29,700
about inappropriate games and of course you know leading the market of

3375
02:42:29,700 --> 02:42:35,740
inappropriate games would be Japan and developer tea time is bringing new

3376
02:42:35,740 --> 02:42:44,460
technology into the adult anime game franchise including they have the face

3377
02:42:44,460 --> 02:42:50,020
tracking T cam technology will now they're working on hand tracking as well

3378
02:42:50,020 --> 02:42:56,700
so you will be able to use the tall like accuracy to lift skirts and rip off

3379
02:42:56,700 --> 02:43:02,980
shirts of anime women and they have some demo videos displaying such

3380
02:43:02,980 --> 02:43:11,620
inappropriate but funny funny yes good stuff anything else for us tonight

3381
02:43:11,620 --> 02:43:18,060
if escapes come in the ps3 that's kind of neat and this is kind of

3382
02:43:18,060 --> 02:43:23,020
disappointing I guess but you know nowadays we have the internet the

3383
02:43:23,020 --> 02:43:28,060
Nintendo power line is gonna be disconnected on June 1st fuck that was

3384
02:43:28,060 --> 02:43:35,060
still open yeah is that the game counselors I think it is holy shit sorry

3385
02:43:35,060 --> 02:43:38,340
to hear though that they'll be out of jobs I mean that kind of sucks but yeah

3386
02:43:38,340 --> 02:43:43,980
I actually to be honest I didn't know you still existed sorry it was probably

3387
02:43:43,980 --> 02:43:48,660
just one guy with his feet up on the desk not getting cut it's like Loki

3388
02:43:48,660 --> 02:43:54,020
eating the sandwich I do that waiting for the call to come in I do that at

3389
02:43:54,020 --> 02:43:59,020
work hey if I eat the sandwich at my desk before I go to lunch that's more

3390
02:43:59,020 --> 02:44:05,220
time to play grant the thought of that's right anything else for us tonight Loki

3391
02:44:05,220 --> 02:44:11,860
or dark Sakura I don't know yeah I'm debating doing something really addict

3392
02:44:11,860 --> 02:44:18,100
II as long as it's not reactivating your Wow account no I'm considering finding

3393
02:44:18,100 --> 02:44:20,980
a cheap digital download key for Star Trek online so that I can play a joint

3394
02:44:20,980 --> 02:44:25,980
drill that is pretty uh but I get another 30 free days all right let's get

3395
02:44:25,980 --> 02:44:28,940
to another call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey this is

3396
02:44:28,940 --> 02:44:33,700
excellent x-link what's on your mind buddy never much I was just talking

3397
02:44:33,700 --> 02:44:37,940
about the EA about the charging the extra 10 bucks for the sports games yes

3398
02:44:37,940 --> 02:44:40,380
I'm surprised more people didn't want to talk about this what are your thoughts

3399
02:44:40,380 --> 02:44:44,660
on this actually I do because I love playing the sports games from EA in fact

3400
02:44:44,660 --> 02:44:49,460
I like playing all of them from time to time because it's a good way to calm

3401
02:44:49,460 --> 02:44:53,100
down after having a bad day at work especially something like Tiger Woods or

3402
02:44:53,100 --> 02:45:00,380
something though I don't condone what Tiger Woods did but whenever I think of

3403
02:45:00,380 --> 02:45:05,540
the Tiger Woods game by EA I think of the way South Park portrayed it and I

3404
02:45:05,540 --> 02:45:08,700
don't know if you saw that episode where they were like press X to slap him

3405
02:45:08,700 --> 02:45:13,380
president actually they have a game out like that where somebody made one that

3406
02:45:13,380 --> 02:45:17,820
was put basically Tiger Woods with Grand Theft Auto of course they do of course

3407
02:45:17,820 --> 02:45:24,020
it okay obviously shit tons of people and yes that's a metric measure shit

3408
02:45:24,020 --> 02:45:28,820
tons of people play these sports games even you know I I may kind of joke I

3409
02:45:28,820 --> 02:45:31,620
don't know a lot about them but it's not like I've never played a sports game in

3410
02:45:31,620 --> 02:45:35,260
my life I actually rather liked blades of steel thank you very much that was my

3411
02:45:35,260 --> 02:45:40,860
jam back in the day double dribble double drip double dribble was badass I

3412
02:45:40,860 --> 02:45:45,980
will totally buy NBA Jam when it comes out to well I will too that's gonna be a

3413
02:45:45,980 --> 02:45:50,460
great game anyway so so yes so the sports games so what do you think are you

3414
02:45:50,460 --> 02:45:57,140
pissed or you know seriously I don't go online that much to play online if I did

3415
02:45:57,140 --> 02:46:01,380
I could see maybe paying the ten bucks but personally I could give to you know

3416
02:46:01,380 --> 02:46:04,820
two shits about it because I don't really play it online that much if I did

3417
02:46:04,820 --> 02:46:09,060
I played it once in a blue moon so I mean I'm more playing it just for like

3418
02:46:09,060 --> 02:46:12,380
the season stuff for myself and see how well I can do at the team on on the

3419
02:46:12,380 --> 02:46:16,220
teams then I do didn't play in online guess other people that I mostly

3420
02:46:16,220 --> 02:46:20,900
probably end up cheating anyway so but um at ten bucks and they've really seen

3421
02:46:20,900 --> 02:46:25,380
them much compared to so so like um somebody said earlier about you know so

3422
02:46:25,380 --> 02:46:31,940
calm and it'd be in 20 bucks I mean you know it could be a lot worse I mean you

3423
02:46:31,940 --> 02:46:37,060
know so I guess my worry is that if this works it's only gonna get worse that's

3424
02:46:37,060 --> 02:46:40,980
my well it's gonna get worse no matter what I mean we got to think about a long

3425
02:46:40,980 --> 02:46:44,540
run they're gonna nickel-dime us no matter what rather it be downloadable

3426
02:46:44,540 --> 02:46:51,020
content where there be online play whether it be flying unicorns you know

3427
02:46:51,020 --> 02:46:57,660
it it's going to always be something so but I I look at is it if I give them 10

3428
02:46:57,660 --> 02:47:00,860
bucks they better have the servers running they better do it good and they

3429
02:47:00,860 --> 02:47:04,540
better have it so I can connect to people without any lag or anything like

3430
02:47:04,540 --> 02:47:08,140
that so I mean as long as they can do that kind of stuff I really don't see

3431
02:47:08,140 --> 02:47:12,540
any kind of problems so they probably won't I mean they're not gonna change

3432
02:47:12,540 --> 02:47:15,820
their service just because they're charging extra 10 bucks they think see

3433
02:47:15,820 --> 02:47:18,580
the problem is they have all this download content that was out there in

3434
02:47:18,580 --> 02:47:21,960
all these different ways that they were offering extra add-ons whether it be

3435
02:47:21,960 --> 02:47:25,860
buying cheats or buying you know extra crap that you probably don't need for

3436
02:47:25,860 --> 02:47:29,660
your sports games well that maybe wasn't working so well so now they're making

3437
02:47:29,660 --> 02:47:35,660
you buy 10 you know download or I guess multiplayer online if you you know

3438
02:47:35,660 --> 02:47:39,580
purchase the game used so that way they're getting you know some money for

3439
02:47:39,580 --> 02:47:43,720
that you know used purchase versus no money but I really don't think they

3440
02:47:43,720 --> 02:47:48,220
should be getting money for use purchase nowhere else in the industry any

3441
02:47:48,220 --> 02:47:53,540
industry do people get money for a used purchase if I buy a used car don't to

3442
02:47:53,540 --> 02:47:57,300
pay money to the manufacturer because they didn't sell me a new car too fucking

3443
02:47:57,300 --> 02:48:02,060
bad yeah I totally agree on that and that's gonna give other people in our

3444
02:48:02,060 --> 02:48:05,500
companies reason to do other stuff too and that could get out of control big

3445
02:48:05,500 --> 02:48:10,060
time but you know if I wanted to coach and play online real bad too I might

3446
02:48:10,060 --> 02:48:12,980
even look on eBay or something try to find a code on there to somebody's

3447
02:48:12,980 --> 02:48:15,540
willing to sell somebody goes you know buy at the game going you know what I'm

3448
02:48:15,540 --> 02:48:18,580
not gonna use their online I'm going to sell it I mean I don't see why they

3449
02:48:18,580 --> 02:48:21,540
couldn't do that I mean I see that all the time with other downloadable stuff

3450
02:48:21,540 --> 02:48:24,280
so that's a good point I mean maybe somebody doesn't really want to play

3451
02:48:24,280 --> 02:48:27,500
online or doesn't really have the whole hookup to be able to play online so

3452
02:48:27,500 --> 02:48:30,580
there's like hey I'm just gonna sell this code make a quick 10 bucks or 7

3453
02:48:30,580 --> 02:48:33,940
bucks recoup some of the money and then between that and selling the game used

3454
02:48:33,940 --> 02:48:37,580
in the first place make a little more money hey yeah precisely all right

3455
02:48:37,580 --> 02:48:40,460
actually we gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show but thanks so much for

3456
02:48:40,460 --> 02:48:46,060
your call anytime and good luck on hitting 80 this week I'm almost at 79

3457
02:48:46,060 --> 02:48:49,900
right now as we speak so all right thanks from what I from one addict to

3458
02:48:49,900 --> 02:48:54,260
another good luck yeah thank you you're welcome I feel kind of bad I think I

3459
02:48:54,260 --> 02:48:58,260
kind of got excellent cooked on that game like I feel like thank God I don't

3460
02:48:58,260 --> 02:49:04,060
have to pay like ripper like you know like what pay like alimony or something

3461
02:49:04,060 --> 02:49:07,860
like when I I ruin people's lives because of Warcraft I don't know all

3462
02:49:07,860 --> 02:49:12,780
right anyhow we're gonna wrap it up and get to the post show and all the fun

3463
02:49:12,780 --> 02:49:17,140
stuff so we got to go around though and get everybody's final thoughts before we

3464
02:49:17,140 --> 02:49:20,660
close up shop and we'll start with dark Sakura this week dark soccer do you have

3465
02:49:20,660 --> 02:49:28,340
any final thoughts boo don't be sad there'll be another all our next week ah

3466
02:49:28,340 --> 02:49:32,140
actually I'm kind of thought for you up what brother brother brother brother

3467
02:49:32,140 --> 02:49:34,380
brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother I have a

3468
02:49:34,380 --> 02:49:37,060
final thought for you

3469
02:49:40,780 --> 02:49:45,660
Loki do you have a final thought I have to see what animals or other animals I

3470
02:49:45,660 --> 02:49:49,220
can skin in Red Dead Redemption it's too bad that you can't skin a human

3471
02:49:49,220 --> 02:49:54,660
apparently human skin does not sell for much that would be Mortal Kombat right

3472
02:49:54,660 --> 02:50:00,660
and my final thought is it is getting hot in here and I have to run errands on

3473
02:50:00,660 --> 02:50:04,860
my way home tonight from the show here I just should be there I turn on the air
