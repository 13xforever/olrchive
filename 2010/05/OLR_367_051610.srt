00:00:13,936 --> 00:00:24,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight, May 16th, 2010, EA gets set to sell a controversial new online pass, more details are forming on Mega Man Online, and Steam gives away a game totally free.

2
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:41,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, my friends, and welcome to episode number 367 of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:41,982 --> 00:00:45,802
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

4
00:00:46,303 --> 00:00:50,104
[SPEAKER_02]: First on up, the one, the only, the fabulous DarkSakura.

5
00:00:50,364 --> 00:00:52,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's my impression of Rob earlier.

6
00:00:52,184 --> 00:00:52,384
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

7
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,144
[SPEAKER_05]: What episode number is this?

8
00:00:57,465 --> 00:00:58,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, no.

9
00:00:58,746 --> 00:01:02,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, before we went on air, because, you know, I wanted to have the episode number down.

10
00:01:02,888 --> 00:01:05,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I lost count, like, three years ago.

11
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:06,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Longer than that.

12
00:01:06,669 --> 00:01:08,070
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I have to give you a hard time.

13
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,010
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said, what episode number are we on?

14
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of like a rhetorical question.

15
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:12,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm actually going to look it up.

16
00:01:12,611 --> 00:01:14,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't expect DarkSakura or Loki to know it.

17
00:01:15,212 --> 00:01:16,573
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jamie in the background, she's all, 69.

18
00:01:16,973 --> 00:01:19,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I said 50 million.

19
00:01:19,214 --> 00:01:19,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, did you?

20
00:01:19,554 --> 00:01:19,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you said 69.

21
00:01:19,974 --> 00:01:20,955
[SPEAKER_02]: You said 69.

22
00:01:21,035 --> 00:01:21,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you said 69.

23
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally thought she said 69, too.

24
00:01:24,776 --> 00:01:25,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it 50 million?

25
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so it's episode number 69 of Orange.

26
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, in two weeks.

27
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,261
[SPEAKER_02]: No, three weeks, because there's not going to be a show in a couple weeks.

28
00:01:33,701 --> 00:01:37,143
[SPEAKER_02]: But the show after Labor Day will be episode number 369.

29
00:01:37,584 --> 00:01:39,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Brought to you by the multiples of three.

30
00:01:39,164 --> 00:01:39,705
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

31
00:01:40,365 --> 00:01:41,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that is weird.

32
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Three, six, nine.

33
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:44,226
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyhow.

34
00:01:45,267 --> 00:01:48,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the other voice you hear over there, the one and only Techmaster Loki.

35
00:01:48,948 --> 00:01:49,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

36
00:01:49,388 --> 00:01:52,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Whose favorite game, by the way, is that Rainbow Unicorn game.

37
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,749
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not.

38
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:57,030
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all you ever play on this program is Rainbow Unicorn.

39
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,111
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not what I play.

40
00:01:59,331 --> 00:02:08,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I played the Werewolf Ice Cream Man one not too long ago, and I played the Mario Crossover game the other week.

41
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:12,257
[SPEAKER_03]: I just didn't have the link for the Mario Crossover game because I was going to play that.

42
00:02:12,457 --> 00:02:16,499
[SPEAKER_02]: That was actually pretty awesome with the Contra guys blowing up all the blocks, I've got to say.

43
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:22,042
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have the link to the Unicorn game, but that's about all I have right now.

44
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:33,731
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, also joining us tonight, you guys in our chat room, because we do tape live every week at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com at 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

45
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:40,955
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are listening to us live, please pull up a chair and join us in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

46
00:02:41,435 --> 00:02:44,197
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to move into a little bit of how was your gaming week.

47
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:45,598
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we always start off the show.

48
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:47,979
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, Dark Sakura, I understand.

49
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:49,620
[SPEAKER_02]: School's out for summer.

50
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

51
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:53,542
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to school in the summer.

52
00:02:53,822 --> 00:02:54,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, never mind then.

53
00:02:54,763 --> 00:02:56,724
[SPEAKER_05]: But I may get to skip pre-algebra.

54
00:02:57,825 --> 00:03:02,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Because for some reason, ARC's website just let me sign up for algebra in the fall.

55
00:03:03,228 --> 00:03:06,310
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was going to do the self-study thing in the summer.

56
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's freaking pre-algebra.

57
00:03:08,732 --> 00:03:09,432
[SPEAKER_05]: So whatever.

58
00:03:10,553 --> 00:03:12,314
[SPEAKER_05]: So I may only be taking history this summer.

59
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:17,437
[SPEAKER_05]: But that means I graduate in the fall with my...

60
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:19,858
[SPEAKER_04]: My AA.

61
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:20,879
[SPEAKER_02]: My eh.

62
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:22,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Your Alcoholics Anonymous.

63
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:22,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.

64
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:22,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh.

65
00:03:23,181 --> 00:03:24,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, eh.

66
00:03:24,442 --> 00:03:26,863
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you'll actually have time to actually play games again.

67
00:03:26,903 --> 00:03:27,384
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be great.

68
00:03:27,764 --> 00:03:28,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing games though.

69
00:03:28,724 --> 00:03:29,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well tell us a little bit about you.

70
00:03:30,005 --> 00:03:41,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though I've had like my final projects and crap due, I played, well I downloaded something for free that we'll be talking about later because everybody freaking downloaded it.

71
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:44,515
[SPEAKER_05]: I was having to wait in the damn queue.

72
00:03:45,195 --> 00:03:50,117
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I played that stupid gay ass unicorn game.

73
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:51,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse you.

74
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:53,779
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's what it's called.

75
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:54,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

76
00:03:54,499 --> 00:03:59,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you have to have the ass to make your unicorn be extra gay or something.

77
00:03:59,721 --> 00:04:00,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

78
00:04:00,802 --> 00:04:01,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

79
00:04:01,882 --> 00:04:04,043
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not talking about... No, the one on Steam.

80
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you played the pink anus game.

81
00:04:06,624 --> 00:04:08,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Anus, that was it.

82
00:04:08,445 --> 00:04:14,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking of the candy called Magic Stone or Legend of Magic Stone or something.

83
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:19,810
[SPEAKER_05]: I got as far as looking in the stable and I was like, this is crap and turned it off.

84
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,471
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also very Ingress-y.

85
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:28,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Who haven't heard the past few episodes, there's a game on Steam, and it was Alan that brought it to our attention.

86
00:04:30,234 --> 00:04:40,697
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something about a mystical unicorn or whatever, and you see in the screenshots, there's a crafting screen or something, and one of the materials you use is A-E-N-U-S.

87
00:04:40,777 --> 00:04:42,458
[SPEAKER_02]: It's anus, but it's pink.

88
00:04:42,838 --> 00:04:45,859
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the magical unicorn with pink anus game.

89
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:50,340
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura bought it because she's a consumer whore.

90
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,060
[SPEAKER_05]: And how.

91
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:58,661
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, like, I tried to, it's really like a click and drag type stuff to use things and I was like, this is like a big bad flash game.

92
00:05:00,142 --> 00:05:01,662
[SPEAKER_05]: You can groom his hooves.

93
00:05:02,822 --> 00:05:08,143
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was a little cult when you first got him and now he's a golden unicorn with sparklies falling out of his butt.

94
00:05:09,724 --> 00:05:10,564
[SPEAKER_05]: At least that's what it looked like.

95
00:05:10,604 --> 00:05:13,184
[SPEAKER_05]: I put up a screen capture somewhere, I think, on my Twitter or something.

96
00:05:13,224 --> 00:05:15,465
[SPEAKER_02]: You make everybody want to play this game very badly.

97
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:16,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's my review.

98
00:05:17,346 --> 00:05:20,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Pink sparkles out of a unicorn's anus.

99
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:21,910
[SPEAKER_05]: It's anus.

100
00:05:23,371 --> 00:05:24,291
[SPEAKER_05]: A-E-N-U-S.

101
00:05:24,652 --> 00:05:25,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Anus.

102
00:05:25,572 --> 00:05:27,334
[SPEAKER_05]: My anus is bleeding.

103
00:05:28,755 --> 00:05:41,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Or would it be... It would be emus, because then you... Anyway, and then... No, you can't have it, because you can't spell your...

104
00:05:41,946 --> 00:05:46,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Max Payne meets Silent Hill The End

105
00:06:08,756 --> 00:06:09,677
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually not that bad.

106
00:06:10,897 --> 00:06:14,839
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, um... Oh god, we played some other stuff too.

107
00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:16,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I went to Pentagogo!

108
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,781
[SPEAKER_05]: So I played pinball.

109
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:20,876
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

110
00:06:46,497 --> 00:06:48,219
[SPEAKER_02]: The Pink Honest I'm allergic to the town of Dixon

111
00:07:08,624 --> 00:07:09,404
[SPEAKER_05]: No, seriously.

112
00:07:10,425 --> 00:07:12,626
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm being absolutely serious.

113
00:07:13,286 --> 00:07:18,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time I've been to Dixon, I end up getting some type of weird heat stroke.

114
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:22,010
[SPEAKER_05]: My allergies get, like, you know how allergic I am to dogs?

115
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,690
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets that bad.

116
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:24,391
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear.

117
00:07:25,151 --> 00:07:36,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I took two doses of Benadryl, Sudafed, and Zyrtec, and I was taking local honey and giving myself shots, and you name it for allergies I was doing.

118
00:07:36,095 --> 00:07:36,996
[SPEAKER_05]: I was snorting crap.

119
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:46,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I was still like super, you know, eye drops, my eyeballs were floating and it was just like not, it was not beautiful.

120
00:07:46,224 --> 00:07:52,409
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt like that my eyeballs were the size of like double the size of my head.

121
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,172
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I went and sat in the car, texted Dan.

122
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:56,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sick.

123
00:07:56,973 --> 00:07:59,375
[SPEAKER_05]: I kept hiding in the bathroom because it was in a place with air conditioning.

124
00:08:00,496 --> 00:08:06,700
[SPEAKER_05]: and playing Final Fantasy 2 sitting on the floor of the bathroom at the Dixon Mayfair.

125
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like fun.

126
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:15,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like the sophistication being sucked right out of you and that's why you're having all those complications and stuff.

127
00:08:15,926 --> 00:08:17,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, you're too sophisticated for here.

128
00:08:19,426 --> 00:08:21,007
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you want to go home?

129
00:08:42,677 --> 00:08:44,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

130
00:08:45,318 --> 00:08:52,662
[SPEAKER_05]: And not to say anything bad about the Pentagogo, because it's a great event.

131
00:08:53,463 --> 00:09:00,447
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you have hay fever, if you've got allergies to nature, to grass, don't go unless you bring your own plastic bubble.

132
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:05,689
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it makes the plastic bubbles, you really can't play pinball very well in them, so I just totally wouldn't, you know.

133
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:11,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say a gas mask could work, you could actually play with a gas mask on, that would work.

134
00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:19,156
[SPEAKER_05]: But as far as what I played, I played Back to the Future, and I played Revenge for Mars, which was one of the Pinball 2000.

135
00:09:19,196 --> 00:09:20,957
[SPEAKER_05]: And I played F14 Tomcat.

136
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,669
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going for mostly the mid-80s to early 90s era of pinball.

137
00:09:31,789 --> 00:09:33,292
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, just kind of get into it.

138
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:34,474
[SPEAKER_05]: And I played this 80s...

139
00:09:36,912 --> 00:09:40,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was going to say, speaking of that, I played a pinball machine called Punk.

140
00:09:41,656 --> 00:09:48,140
[SPEAKER_05]: And it had like the, you know, looked like pictures from, what was that movie with Nicolas Cage and Valley Girl.

141
00:09:49,181 --> 00:09:55,266
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and all the guys on the play field looked like Duran Duran.

142
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:56,266
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was kind of funny.

143
00:09:56,987 --> 00:09:58,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though they weren't very punk, they had that hair though.

144
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:00,429
[SPEAKER_05]: And eyeliner.

145
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:04,973
[SPEAKER_05]: And that one was actually pretty fun for an old school, you know,

146
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:07,988
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

147
00:10:34,827 --> 00:10:46,451
[SPEAKER_05]: My other thing, and I know I'm going off on this, is I was actually so caught up, because me being the big design freaking nerd that I am, I was going around taking pictures of interesting design.

148
00:10:47,091 --> 00:10:51,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Of cool pictures and neat early 80s, late 70s style art.

149
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,474
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll put some of the pictures up, they're on my phone.

150
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:57,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you're a nerd, yeah.

151
00:10:57,734 --> 00:10:59,835
[SPEAKER_10]: But I did play other games.

152
00:11:00,255 --> 00:11:01,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

153
00:11:01,675 --> 00:11:03,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I said I played Final Fantasy II, didn't I?

154
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:06,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, while you're on the bathroom floor crying and sobbing because of your allergies.

155
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:07,996
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't crying.

156
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:12,257
[SPEAKER_05]: And, yeah, I played some Star Trek Online.

157
00:11:12,997 --> 00:11:13,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Fun.

158
00:11:13,997 --> 00:11:15,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's... No, I'm sure I played something else.

159
00:11:16,798 --> 00:11:23,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, I started playing Braid, and then I kind of remembered that I had to do other things like homework.

160
00:11:24,753 --> 00:11:26,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done with my finals.

161
00:11:26,354 --> 00:11:27,194
[SPEAKER_02]: I love how you sum it up.

162
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:30,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I started to play this game, but then I was like, oh, God, I have something better to do.

163
00:11:31,175 --> 00:11:31,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

164
00:11:32,096 --> 00:11:33,836
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it wasn't I have something better to do.

165
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,077
[SPEAKER_05]: It was something responsible to do.

166
00:11:36,097 --> 00:11:36,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

167
00:11:36,917 --> 00:11:37,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

168
00:11:37,377 --> 00:11:38,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Screw that growing up.

169
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:39,358
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

170
00:11:39,378 --> 00:11:41,659
[SPEAKER_05]: See, you're Rob-ba, and our other one is Rob-ba-ba.

171
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:41,979
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

172
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:42,399
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

173
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:43,059
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

174
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:53,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, I don't know if you can top Dark Sakura's adventures in Dixon, Pinball, and Final Fantasy II on the bathroom floor while she's trying to recover from allergies, but you want to try it?

175
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:55,864
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't go to Dixon.

176
00:11:56,464 --> 00:11:57,884
[SPEAKER_03]: That's already an improvement right there.

177
00:11:59,645 --> 00:12:00,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

178
00:12:00,465 --> 00:12:07,127
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a lot of things that have yet to come out, including APB.

179
00:12:07,487 --> 00:12:10,368
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing the beta of that, and I love it because it's just like...

180
00:12:11,508 --> 00:12:16,670
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it's like crossing Saints Row with Free Mode and Grand Theft Auto 4.

181
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:19,272
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of do what you need to do.

182
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:20,332
[SPEAKER_03]: You have different missions.

183
00:12:20,352 --> 00:12:26,455
[SPEAKER_03]: The first few missions in the tutorial portion of the game, they have you go...

184
00:12:27,555 --> 00:12:30,798
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

185
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:49,795
[SPEAKER_03]: and people online as well.

186
00:12:50,235 --> 00:12:55,179
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can play both the villains and kind of the heroes, I guess, in the game.

187
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:58,821
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm playing, of course, as one of the gangbangers because that's fun.

188
00:13:00,442 --> 00:13:03,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of customization in the character creator.

189
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:06,406
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just nuts how much customization is in there.

190
00:13:07,227 --> 00:13:09,288
[SPEAKER_03]: The clothing, though, you don't really have a lot of options.

191
00:13:09,348 --> 00:13:14,372
[SPEAKER_03]: At first you have to kind of buy that stuff or unlock it later on when you finish different missions.

192
00:13:14,412 --> 00:13:15,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Same with cars and whatnot.

193
00:13:17,074 --> 00:13:18,175
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm really digging it.

194
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:22,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of thinking I might go back to that as an MMO, but we'll see.

195
00:13:23,358 --> 00:13:30,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of like the fact, though, that the way they have their pay scale for it, it's basically you pay as you go.

196
00:13:30,783 --> 00:13:45,773
[SPEAKER_03]: So for someone like me that doesn't necessarily get a lot of time to dedicate to MMOs or stuff like that, it wouldn't be so bad because the time I'm not playing it, I'm not actually losing out on anything because you pay for the hours that you want to use.

197
00:13:46,514 --> 00:13:47,755
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it sounds good to me.

198
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:50,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I may try it.

199
00:13:50,378 --> 00:13:53,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to upgrade my computer, though, too.

200
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:54,762
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be a little bit.

201
00:13:55,963 --> 00:13:56,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Other fun stuff.

202
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:03,311
[SPEAKER_03]: I happened to get a copy of Red Dead Redemption a little early, so I've been playing that, and I love the game.

203
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:06,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a big surprise, because it's a little bit like Grand Theft Auto, but...

204
00:14:08,376 --> 00:14:11,397
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, a lot of it's been like Oregon Trail Extreme.

205
00:14:11,757 --> 00:14:12,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

206
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Specifically, the hunting portion of Oregon Trail.

207
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Because in the game, you make money by it.

208
00:14:19,322 --> 00:14:23,784
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hunt stuff and skin them and take the meat and the skins or whatever.

209
00:14:24,004 --> 00:14:25,945
[SPEAKER_03]: But you could only carry 100 pounds back to the wagon?

210
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:26,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

211
00:14:26,786 --> 00:14:28,106
[SPEAKER_03]: I was able to kill a lot of things.

212
00:14:28,426 --> 00:14:32,729
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about 100 pounds worth of skins, but did you know in that game you can skin a horse?

213
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:35,315
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not know that.

214
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:01,657
[SPEAKER_03]: and then I saw Onward Ills running around and I shot them.

215
00:15:01,677 --> 00:15:05,420
[SPEAKER_02]: This just in, breaking news, this just in, PETA hates Red Dead Redemption.

216
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sure they will.

217
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,683
[SPEAKER_03]: You can kill all sorts of creatures out there.

218
00:15:10,923 --> 00:15:14,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Haven't found the bears yet though, but it's really cool.

219
00:15:14,186 --> 00:15:24,373
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that the game looks a lot better than Grand Theft Auto, I mean, just a few years and the amount of improvements in the engine, it's just, it's amazing.

220
00:15:24,973 --> 00:15:26,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely worth picking up though.

221
00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:27,314
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the game.

222
00:15:27,354 --> 00:15:27,694
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.

223
00:15:52,423 --> 00:15:53,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was playing the demo.

224
00:15:53,763 --> 00:16:00,085
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm not cool like you and can get all these early games because you're like in the know or whatever.

225
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:06,527
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was playing the split-second demo myself, and yeah, it was as fun as I remember at E3.

226
00:16:06,607 --> 00:16:11,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it was still the same game that was probably, funny enough, probably my game of show last E3.

227
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:17,110
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, last E3 was not a huge year for me, but that was probably the best thing I played at the show.

228
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,771
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm excited that game is finally coming out, like, Tuesday, right?

229
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:19,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

230
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:28,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I'm looking forward to actually being able to... I'm going to try some of the multiplayer in Red Dead when it does come out because they do have a lot of neat multiplayer options in there.

231
00:16:28,718 --> 00:16:33,982
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, I'm also working on doing another edited modded Grand Theft Auto game.

232
00:16:34,282 --> 00:16:44,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to edit the maps now, but there's specific rules you have to follow as far as getting stuff to work and stuff that normally works on the PC version doesn't work in the console version and whatnot.

233
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:44,690
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

234
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:46,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

235
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

236
00:16:48,434 --> 00:16:52,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to play some of the listeners during this week's Grand Theft Auto games.

237
00:16:53,017 --> 00:16:53,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, finally.

238
00:16:54,137 --> 00:16:55,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Some listeners took you up on the challenge, hey?

239
00:16:55,678 --> 00:16:55,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

240
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:56,879
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fun.

241
00:16:57,379 --> 00:16:58,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

242
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:01,401
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, just more Grand Theft Auto.

243
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing a lot of that.

244
00:17:04,803 --> 00:17:07,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's really... Did you school the listeners, or did they school you?

245
00:17:08,605 --> 00:17:09,166
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I schooled them.

246
00:17:09,286 --> 00:17:10,426
[SPEAKER_03]: I school everybody I play.

247
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:10,927
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

248
00:17:12,216 --> 00:17:12,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

249
00:17:31,307 --> 00:17:39,413
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, I'm actually ranked 67 now, so I'm going up there, trying to make as close to number one as possible.

250
00:17:39,473 --> 00:17:41,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on up, moving on up.

251
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:42,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, congratulations.

252
00:17:42,816 --> 00:17:48,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, this is episode 367 of OLR, and you're number 67 on Grand Theft Auto.

253
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, how about that?

254
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:53,562
[SPEAKER_03]: I did pick up 3D.GameHeroes, but I haven't played it yet.

255
00:17:53,682 --> 00:17:56,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we'll move to my gaming week, because I did play 3D.GameHeroes.

256
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:57,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked that up as well.

257
00:17:57,983 --> 00:18:01,043
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of motivated by the price point of just $40.

258
00:18:01,103 --> 00:18:02,064
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of seemed like a bargain to me.

259
00:18:02,484 --> 00:18:05,424
[SPEAKER_02]: So I decided to pick up the game, and I didn't know much about the game.

260
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's how clueless I was about the game.

261
00:18:07,165 --> 00:18:11,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was kind of like a game editor type of game where you would get to make your own little adventure games.

262
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,386
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's not what it is.

263
00:18:14,486 --> 00:18:18,107
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's take a step back and talk about what 3D.GameHeroes actually is.

264
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:21,988
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically a gigantic ripoff of The Legend of Zelda.

265
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,048
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's cool, you know?

266
00:18:24,148 --> 00:18:26,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, The Legend of Zelda was a great game.

267
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:32,251
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of fascinating that they're getting away with it, but hey, if Nintendo's not going to do anything, why not?

268
00:18:32,851 --> 00:18:40,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you know, when I say ripoff, you know, there's some clear parody going on here, and they've changed just enough so it's not really a ripoff of Zelda.

269
00:18:40,413 --> 00:18:42,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, you don't have hearts.

270
00:18:43,073 --> 00:18:44,254
[SPEAKER_02]: You have apples.

271
00:18:44,274 --> 00:18:45,394
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

272
00:18:45,914 --> 00:18:47,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Kidneys, that'd be funny.

273
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:55,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's I guess maybe the core part of the customization of 3D.GameHeroes is that your hero can be anything you want.

274
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,238
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually have a mode where you can go in and edit.

275
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:06,601
[SPEAKER_02]: The default guy, I guess you could say the person in slot number one in the character edit mode looks like the dude from Dragon Warrior.

276
00:19:06,941 --> 00:19:11,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what you're supposed to... I'm 12, so I give all my characters three-year-old names.

277
00:19:11,503 --> 00:19:14,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I name my character Vulva, so I don't know what the normal...

278
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,806
[SPEAKER_02]: The character name is... Shut up.

279
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan and I picked out a good name.

280
00:19:21,671 --> 00:19:22,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Save us, Vulva.

281
00:19:22,652 --> 00:19:23,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Save us.

282
00:19:23,774 --> 00:19:24,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Evil Empire.

283
00:19:26,777 --> 00:19:29,800
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I don't remember what his name is, usually.

284
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:33,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody in chat will probably yell it out, but whatever.

285
00:19:33,103 --> 00:19:34,325
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter what his name is.

286
00:19:34,405 --> 00:19:34,825
[SPEAKER_02]: The game...

287
00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:44,096
[SPEAKER_02]: The game is like this giant love letter from guys our age, but in Japan, because I know it was developed over there, who kind of miss what gaming used to be.

288
00:19:44,176 --> 00:19:57,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you think about the concept of this game, this story, is that there's this 2D world where everybody stopped visiting it, and it got old because, you know, just people didn't care about it anymore.

289
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:01,762
[SPEAKER_02]: So their big idea was to go 3D to change the world.

290
00:20:01,822 --> 00:20:02,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that...

291
00:20:02,822 --> 00:20:10,926
[SPEAKER_02]: There's kind of like this really hidden bitter subtext there about how everything is 3D in this day and age and why can't our games be 2D anymore.

292
00:20:11,887 --> 00:20:14,968
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just loaded with references to old 8-bit games.

293
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:18,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly Zelda, but there's other stuff in there as well that's really funny.

294
00:20:19,111 --> 00:20:28,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Including more current games because from Software, the developer, they made this other great PlayStation 3 game that came out a little while ago called Demon's Souls.

295
00:20:28,736 --> 00:20:30,877
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's actually this room in the game where...

296
00:20:31,437 --> 00:20:35,260
[SPEAKER_02]: If you walk in the right spot, it says, there's a message on the ground here.

297
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:36,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.

298
00:20:36,521 --> 00:20:38,242
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, do you want to recommend this message?

299
00:20:38,262 --> 00:20:41,004
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you hit yes, it says, somewhere someone got healed.

300
00:20:41,485 --> 00:20:44,027
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny if you've played Demon's Souls.

301
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:46,489
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't, it makes no fucking sense.

302
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:48,490
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just like, what is this randomness?

303
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,751
[SPEAKER_02]: But whatever.

304
00:20:49,851 --> 00:20:55,155
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there's a chick right next to it and you find white sticky stuff in front of her, which is also a Demon's Souls reference.

305
00:20:55,476 --> 00:21:00,940
[SPEAKER_02]: But it sounds like porno, which is really funny because there's a lot of parts in this game

306
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,200
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

307
00:21:31,155 --> 00:21:32,296
[SPEAKER_02]: The game has flaws.

308
00:21:32,496 --> 00:21:33,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it has flaws.

309
00:21:33,758 --> 00:21:39,863
[SPEAKER_02]: There's slowdown in some of the dungeons because the water effect that they do in the game is so over the top.

310
00:21:40,184 --> 00:21:42,426
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot in this game that's really over the top.

311
00:21:42,506 --> 00:21:48,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh, I don't know, the size of your sword when you have a full health bar takes up the entire screen.

312
00:21:48,531 --> 00:21:49,632
[SPEAKER_02]: So as long as you don't get it.

313
00:21:49,652 --> 00:21:53,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Listening to Bobby talking about it, I was making all kinds of inappropriate jokes.

314
00:21:54,236 --> 00:21:55,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's funny.

315
00:21:55,337 --> 00:21:56,317
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really over the top.

316
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,218
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot that's very over the top about this game.

317
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:03,300
[SPEAKER_02]: And they decide, for whatever reason, to do the water effects really over the top.

318
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,002
[SPEAKER_02]: And it causes slowdown in one of the dungeons.

319
00:22:07,122 --> 00:22:10,923
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, okay, folks, this is the PlayStation 3.

320
00:22:12,704 --> 00:22:15,705
[SPEAKER_02]: The government bought PlayStation 3s to use their cell processing.

321
00:22:15,745 --> 00:22:17,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's your cell processor now?

322
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:18,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

323
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:19,867
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, this game...

324
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:43,269
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest, there's really nothing about 3D.GameHeroes that deserves to be on the PlayStation 3 This game could have been on the PS2 I mean, yes, it has trophies and yes, it's widescreen But I think there were a handful of widescreen games on the PS2 as well And that's really it I mean, graphically, you're not getting that much more oomph on the PS3

325
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:52,031
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm okay with it, and they give it a pass, because again, you're charging me about the cost of a PS2 game, you know, 40 bucks.

326
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:54,032
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, you know, still a good time.

327
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:57,833
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end, you just have to evaluate, did I have fun, yes or no?

328
00:22:57,933 --> 00:23:00,173
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had fun playing the game, despite its flaws.

329
00:23:00,553 --> 00:23:01,674
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wouldn't give the game like an A++.

330
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:05,596
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd give it a good solid A- or B+.

331
00:23:05,816 --> 00:23:20,147
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun, it's silly, especially if you're a gamer in that age bracket, late 20s, early 30s, or even if you're a younger gamer that knows your retro gaming history, then you're going to get a kick out of this and get some lols.

332
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:39,234
[SPEAKER_03]: and I don't think it made our show role but they have some really cool custom characters you can download off of their 3D.gameheroes hall of heroes website including they have a little arcade game you can play as a little girl Cthulhu chickens

333
00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:42,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Santa Claus Santa Claus Santa Claus

334
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:09,271
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

335
00:24:10,634 --> 00:24:16,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Something just occurred to me that I should do I need to get RPG Maker for PC You should

336
00:24:17,598 --> 00:24:19,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lodge Radio, The RPG

337
00:24:48,441 --> 00:24:53,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I... Again, you know, don't... I'm nitpicking a little bit with 3D.GameHeroes.

338
00:24:53,803 --> 00:25:01,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Overall, if you want to play... Like, if you're sitting there going, gosh, I wish they would make another 2D Zelda game that I could, like, play on my TV, here you go.

339
00:25:03,326 --> 00:25:04,806
[SPEAKER_02]: This game was, like, made for you.

340
00:25:05,026 --> 00:25:05,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy.

341
00:25:05,787 --> 00:25:06,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Eat it up.

342
00:25:06,427 --> 00:25:07,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a big spoon.

343
00:25:07,307 --> 00:25:07,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Eat it up.

344
00:25:07,527 --> 00:25:12,389
[SPEAKER_03]: They have, like, a little Big Planet Sackboy-type thing in there called Ragdoll.

345
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:14,289
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the custom characters that someone made.

346
00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:16,170
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks just like a little pixelated...

347
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:33,776
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just kind of a bummer that that's like the hero is like the only thing you can change you know what I mean like didn't you weren't you kind of hoping Loki there'd be like a little more just a little more customizability to this I don't know oh well but you know what 40 bucks hard to complain sir duct tape yes someone made a roll duct tape

348
00:25:34,062 --> 00:25:35,562
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, look, other games in my gaming week.

349
00:25:35,942 --> 00:25:40,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to drag this out too long because we're already almost a half hour into the show and haven't even touched gaming news yet.

350
00:25:40,443 --> 00:25:42,683
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just wanted to say really quick some of the stuff I've been playing.

351
00:25:42,944 --> 00:25:44,704
[SPEAKER_02]: World of Warcraft, of course, because I'm addicted.

352
00:25:45,304 --> 00:25:50,225
[SPEAKER_02]: And play some Game Room this week because, you know, they're back on the ball with getting the releases out.

353
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:50,965
[SPEAKER_02]: So hooray for that.

354
00:25:51,265 --> 00:25:54,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I talked on the show last week about Pitfall and nearly missing the top 20, right?

355
00:25:55,326 --> 00:26:00,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to do like a perfect run of the game and you know what gets me in Pitfall and why I can't do it?

356
00:26:00,687 --> 00:26:02,567
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the scorpions in the Hidden Passage.

357
00:26:03,948 --> 00:26:09,455
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no problem if I just run straight from right to left or run to the left.

358
00:26:09,996 --> 00:26:13,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get through 20 minutes running straight and not die once.

359
00:26:13,481 --> 00:26:15,163
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how I got a score of 85,000.

360
00:26:15,764 --> 00:26:18,708
[SPEAKER_02]: But the minute I have to go into the tunnels, the scorpions eat my face.

361
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:21,071
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem I'm having on Old School Pitfall.

362
00:26:21,311 --> 00:26:21,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Oink, Reverse Breakout

363
00:26:38,689 --> 00:26:40,249
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

364
00:27:04,335 --> 00:27:11,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I wouldn't say it's my favorite 2600 game, but I think maybe Kaboom or Pitfall 2 would be my favorite 2600 game.

365
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,683
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's my most underrated, and I think most underappreciated 2600 game.

366
00:27:17,063 --> 00:27:22,206
[SPEAKER_02]: When I can get the cartridge for $1, I'll probably buy it on Game Room anyway.

367
00:27:22,246 --> 00:27:25,508
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, he sends a picture of Oink running on his TV with the Atari 2600 hooked up.

368
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:28,190
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

369
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,022
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, does it justify the increased costs?

370
00:27:55,182 --> 00:27:55,522
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

371
00:27:55,682 --> 00:27:58,024
[SPEAKER_02]: It really depends on how much these games mean to you and so forth.

372
00:27:58,624 --> 00:28:02,006
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot, and I already did my Game Room tangent a couple weeks ago.

373
00:28:02,026 --> 00:28:03,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying very hard not to repeat it.

374
00:28:03,788 --> 00:28:08,891
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of potential with Microsoft Game Room, and I really hope that potential is realized.

375
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,793
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping E3 is going to drop a whopper on us.

376
00:28:12,193 --> 00:28:19,718
[SPEAKER_02]: I really want them to come out at that press conference at E3 and go, we're going to release a whopper of a game on Game Room this week, and it's out right now.

377
00:28:19,918 --> 00:28:20,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get it.

378
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:22,140
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't know what that game is.

379
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:50,013
[SPEAKER_02]: but hopefully something really cool like something not from the early early 80s like something I don't know I don't know what game that could be the Galaxian 3 I don't I don't know what it'll be but hopefully something they'll kind of put out and it'll take game room to that next level where it's not just Atari 2600 and old old old old old stuff from the 80s we'll see though I my gut tells me here's here's my bet quote-unquote

380
00:28:51,235 --> 00:28:57,981
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a Capcom game from their Street Fighter 2-ish era when they were using that hardware.

381
00:28:58,441 --> 00:29:01,664
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to play... The CPS 1 and 2?

382
00:29:01,964 --> 00:29:07,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm going to just guesstimate with nothing to back this up whatsoever because there's already the...

383
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumors that Capcom games are going to make their way.

384
00:29:11,171 --> 00:29:15,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the Mega Man fighting game and some of that stuff is going to make their way to the Rock Battle.

385
00:29:15,873 --> 00:29:19,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Capcom supported Ultra K in the past.

386
00:29:19,934 --> 00:29:21,675
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no reason why they wouldn't jump in on this.

387
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:26,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to just speculate original Street Fighter 1.

388
00:29:26,657 --> 00:29:29,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Street Fighter 1 will be the big E3 game room release.

389
00:29:30,738 --> 00:29:39,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I have nothing to base that off of, but half fanboyism, half I've been doing this show for long enough that I feel like I start to understand the patterns of gaming companies.

390
00:29:40,783 --> 00:29:41,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Take it or leave it.

391
00:29:43,205 --> 00:29:47,667
[SPEAKER_02]: And also in Game Room this week, Keystone Capers was released and I played a crap ton of that.

392
00:29:48,327 --> 00:29:50,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I'll stop talking about my gaming week now.

393
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:53,030
[SPEAKER_02]: We are officially a half hour into the show and haven't talked about any gaming news.

394
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,650
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing a lot of Super Street Fighter 2.

395
00:29:56,155 --> 00:30:11,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my ass handed to me in Super Street Fighter 4 this weekend I was playing and I got schooled and it just reminded me what a terrible Street Fighter player I am I was playing Super Street Fighter 2 on my arcade cabinet it was fun

396
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:20,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com I think some folks are speculating what the game could be that's released at E3 for Game Room.

397
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:23,630
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt speculates Oonga Boonga will be the game.

398
00:30:25,092 --> 00:30:26,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear Lord, no.

399
00:30:27,073 --> 00:30:31,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Blackwolf, our good pal Bobby Blackwolf says Miss Nude World USA.

400
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:35,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I wish.

401
00:30:36,963 --> 00:30:42,472
[SPEAKER_02]: And BlackWolf also says, remember, no online multiplayer in Game Room, so it doesn't make much sense to do a fighting game.

402
00:30:42,812 --> 00:30:49,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, to be fair, sir, it really didn't make much sense to put Combat or Outlaw there either then for those same reasons.

403
00:30:49,783 --> 00:30:51,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Combat is...

404
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:54,990
[SPEAKER_02]: is pointless if you don't have someone to play it with.

405
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,611
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet you're supposed to invite someone over, they get on the second controller.

406
00:30:58,671 --> 00:31:01,052
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could basically cheat for the high score on that one.

407
00:31:02,332 --> 00:31:05,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Donovan speculates Custer's Revenge will be the big game that's released.

408
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:08,695
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I just don't think that's going to happen.

409
00:31:08,735 --> 00:31:11,075
[SPEAKER_02]: A few people in a chat talking about Kangaroo.

410
00:31:11,235 --> 00:31:15,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft in chat says, if Game Room releases Kangaroo, I'll buy it on release.

411
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:25,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to warn you though, if they release Kongo Bongo, which I don't know, for some reason Kangaroo makes me think of Donkey Kong, which makes me think of Kongo Bongo, because they were all kind of, you know, trying to one-up each other.

412
00:31:26,367 --> 00:31:29,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Kongo Bongo is on the Sega Genesis Uber collection.

413
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:36,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Be very careful if Sega games start showing up on Game Room, because a lot of them are on that collection.

414
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:38,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get swindled.

415
00:31:40,222 --> 00:31:42,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's move on to some actual gaming news for heaven's sakes.

416
00:31:43,163 --> 00:31:46,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Housekeeping, join us on Twitter, twitter.com.com.

417
00:31:46,283 --> 00:31:50,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Join us on Facebook, Orange Launch Radio, yadda yadda, blah blah blah, gaming news.

418
00:31:50,264 --> 00:31:50,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

419
00:31:52,545 --> 00:31:59,946
[SPEAKER_03]: So Activision apparently is taking some lessons that they possibly have learned from lawsuits and whatnot.

420
00:32:00,326 --> 00:32:03,307
[SPEAKER_03]: They are dropping celebrities from the next Guitar Hero game.

421
00:32:03,927 --> 00:32:09,348
[SPEAKER_03]: So you will not see any, you know, dead Kurt Cobain's or whatever singing

422
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:16,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, to be fair, Kurt Cobain was not portrayed as dead in the game because I think if he was, that would have been a whole other issue.

423
00:32:16,449 --> 00:32:17,170
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have been cool.

424
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,591
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have been a whole other issue.

425
00:32:18,951 --> 00:32:20,352
[SPEAKER_05]: You just got, he's on the stage.

426
00:32:22,153 --> 00:32:22,594
[SPEAKER_05]: No head.

427
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:23,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Zombie Kurt Cobain.

428
00:32:25,196 --> 00:32:33,942
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, so they're basically, their claim is they're going back to the basics and this is coming from the latest issue of the official Xbox magazine.

429
00:32:35,463 --> 00:32:39,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the old Guitar Hero characters, the ones that were actually unique to the game are coming back.

430
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:48,630
[SPEAKER_03]: and you'll be able to recruit characters by playing their song sets and once you do that you can also unlock their alter egos.

431
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:58,273
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example Lars would become like Warrior Lars and that will allow you to get a x6 multiplier.

432
00:33:00,474 --> 00:33:03,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick Play, I guess, is being revamped.

433
00:33:04,718 --> 00:33:11,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the DLC from Guitar Hero 5 and before that will be compatible with Guitar Hero 6.

434
00:33:13,126 --> 00:33:18,191
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing, I guess, Streaker's Momentum, Do or Die are now available in online competitive modes.

435
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:25,678
[SPEAKER_03]: New Power Challenges, Queen, Kiss, Black Sabbath, they're confirmed to be in the game.

436
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:30,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess Quest Mode will feature Gene Simmons as a narrator because he needs money.

437
00:33:32,722 --> 00:33:33,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Does he have a TV show?

438
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:35,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Does he get money from that?

439
00:33:35,644 --> 00:33:36,805
[SPEAKER_05]: He's freaking Gene Simmons.

440
00:33:37,426 --> 00:33:39,707
[SPEAKER_05]: All he has to do is go to a freak show and stick out his tongue.

441
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:40,187
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what though?

442
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:47,973
[SPEAKER_02]: He was on The Celebrity Apprentice and that's, you know, if you're resorting to going to try to... Joan Rivers was on The Celebrity Apprentice and that's Joan Rivers.

443
00:33:48,013 --> 00:33:49,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Her career's kind of...

444
00:33:50,274 --> 00:33:52,437
[SPEAKER_02]: They claim there's going to be a bigger focus on rock and roll.

445
00:33:58,795 --> 00:33:59,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

446
00:33:59,896 --> 00:34:00,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Focus on rock and roll.

447
00:34:01,518 --> 00:34:05,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm glad they're making a bigger focus on rock and roll and not, I don't know, making money.

448
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:07,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do I just have this feeling?

449
00:34:07,723 --> 00:34:16,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm not trying to be negative or be a fanboy or whatever, but why do I just have this feeling that E3, we're going to see Rock Band 3, and it's just going to blow this shit out of the water?

450
00:34:16,551 --> 00:34:19,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's just going to annihilate Guitar Hero.

451
00:34:19,734 --> 00:34:21,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put it this way.

452
00:34:21,696 --> 00:34:21,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

453
00:34:24,073 --> 00:34:26,293
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really give a crap about it.

454
00:34:26,313 --> 00:34:27,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, look at Guitar Hero 5.

455
00:34:28,114 --> 00:34:32,775
[SPEAKER_03]: What exactly did Guitar Hero 5 do that was that great over Guitar Hero World Tour?

456
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:34,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing, really.

457
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:37,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was pretty much, hey, look, we have new songs.

458
00:34:39,396 --> 00:34:39,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

459
00:34:40,636 --> 00:34:40,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

460
00:34:42,437 --> 00:34:44,877
[SPEAKER_03]: How about we throw in Van Halen?

461
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:46,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Two games for the price of one.

462
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:52,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't that the first game with the whole you can do four singers if you want and four guitarists and all that stuff?

463
00:34:52,864 --> 00:34:53,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that's awesome.

464
00:34:53,947 --> 00:34:55,972
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to put four drummers in my house.

465
00:34:55,992 --> 00:34:58,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because that makes sense.

466
00:34:59,562 --> 00:34:59,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

467
00:35:02,037 --> 00:35:02,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it sounds dumb.

468
00:35:02,998 --> 00:35:04,459
[SPEAKER_03]: And this one doesn't sound that great to me.

469
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:05,199
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

470
00:35:05,379 --> 00:35:08,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of biased because I don't really care for the Guitar Hero series, really.

471
00:35:09,302 --> 00:35:12,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Once I had Rock Band 2, it was just like, I don't really care.

472
00:35:12,584 --> 00:35:14,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got all these download songs.

473
00:35:14,146 --> 00:35:16,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really need to buy another game.

474
00:35:16,607 --> 00:35:22,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Rock Band 3, I'm going to kind of consider it the same thing unless I see them doing something really unique with it.

475
00:35:22,451 --> 00:35:30,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I do have faith in Harmonix that they're going to actually put something out decent that's going to be different enough from the last game.

476
00:35:30,937 --> 00:35:37,986
[SPEAKER_03]: So, props to them for that, but, I mean, look at, like, the Guitar Hero, their song creator and stuff that they had in-game.

477
00:35:38,006 --> 00:35:43,412
[SPEAKER_03]: That was supposed to be, like, this huge feature, and everyone's kind of like, eh, whatever, you know.

478
00:35:44,213 --> 00:35:45,434
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we'll see.

479
00:35:45,595 --> 00:35:50,460
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we don't know a lot about it yet, but I'm not expecting much.

480
00:35:51,201 --> 00:35:53,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like with DJ Hero 2, I'm not expecting much.

481
00:35:53,924 --> 00:35:54,825
[SPEAKER_03]: New songs, that's about it.

482
00:35:54,845 --> 00:36:01,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Which could be a good thing, because if you set the expectation bar really low, then they have the potential to really overcome that.

483
00:36:01,713 --> 00:36:06,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas I think the expectation bar with Rock Band 3 is really high, at least for me.

484
00:36:07,279 --> 00:36:09,001
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

485
00:36:28,317 --> 00:36:54,418
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's it you know it's basically like a track pack but there is a lot of songs in the game and you know just like you know Guitar Hero Metallica or Aerosmith or something like that I really don't give a crap about Green Day Rock Band um I guess even the same could have been said about Lego Rock Band yet I purchased anyways although Lego Rock Band had a really good set list so I I did like that but you know I basically dumped the songs in the game and then sold it back so whatever um

486
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:56,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Project TenDollar

487
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:27,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11 EA Sports Games for PS3 and Xbox 360 Title Specific Online Pass

488
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:40,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

489
00:37:57,455 --> 00:38:24,686
[SPEAKER_02]: of course you get a 7 day free trial so I guess if you rent it from Gamefly you'll at least get that it's going to depend what it is depending on the game you have but EA has mentioned that it will be it could include meaning it probably will include basic online multiplayer that could also include group and league features roster and playbook updates downloads of like the user based stuff tournament support and so forth

490
00:38:25,726 --> 00:38:33,311
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the direction they're going in where now if you get this game used, you're going to have to pay an extra $10 if you're going to want to enable it online.

491
00:38:34,052 --> 00:38:39,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the first time we've really seen something like this ever happen, right?

492
00:38:39,955 --> 00:38:48,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's been other games that have charged the money for extra stuff if you want to redeem the code.

493
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:49,962
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's interesting now that you're talking about

494
00:38:50,422 --> 00:38:55,743
[SPEAKER_02]: What I think a lot of people have come to take for granted online and that is basic head-to-head online matches.

495
00:38:56,643 --> 00:38:57,784
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what do you think?

496
00:38:59,864 --> 00:39:07,926
[SPEAKER_02]: About the whole Project $10 thing where, you know, folks are now having to pay $10 if they want to play their sports game online.

497
00:39:08,706 --> 00:39:13,747
[SPEAKER_05]: That's... I understand the logic behind it.

498
00:39:15,047 --> 00:39:18,728
[SPEAKER_05]: What I think, though, is that it's not really going to

499
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:21,774
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

500
00:39:41,617 --> 00:39:51,124
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the difficult part for me is that I see the logic behind it and it's hard for me to argue with it because, yeah, game developers kind of lose a little money on the used market.

501
00:39:51,145 --> 00:39:52,926
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a way for them to make it back, whatever.

502
00:39:53,747 --> 00:39:58,590
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of irritates me, though, is that I already pay for Xbox Live.

503
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,352
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I was about to say.

504
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:02,853
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you pay for these services already.

505
00:40:03,614 --> 00:40:10,760
[SPEAKER_05]: If they really wanted it to be something they could make more money on, they should just have like a...

506
00:40:12,674 --> 00:40:15,335
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, more download packs and things like that.

507
00:40:15,355 --> 00:40:19,157
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not losing any money either off of used sales.

508
00:40:19,337 --> 00:40:25,580
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think about it, if I sell my game used to somebody, there's still one copy out there that's floating around.

509
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:32,143
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like I copied my copy and now they're still playing a game that you paid for once.

510
00:40:33,124 --> 00:40:34,764
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just still one person playing.

511
00:40:35,325 --> 00:40:37,846
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it is kind of a dick move to do this.

512
00:40:38,486 --> 00:40:39,106
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

513
00:40:39,146 --> 00:40:43,527
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that they haven't dropped the price of their game, you know, it's still kind of messed up.

514
00:40:43,867 --> 00:40:48,969
[SPEAKER_03]: What's even dumber, the whole thing, was that GameStop was actually quoted.

515
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:50,749
[SPEAKER_03]: They were like, yeah, we think this is a great idea.

516
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:56,431
[SPEAKER_02]: The quote you're thinking of, CEO Dan DeMatteo, I think, says this.

517
00:40:56,751 --> 00:41:00,892
[SPEAKER_02]: GameStop is excited to partner with such a forward-thinking publisher as Electronic Arts.

518
00:41:01,312 --> 00:41:10,580
[SPEAKER_02]: This relationship allows us to capitalize on our investments to market and sell downloadable content online as well as through our network of stores worldwide.

519
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you kissing or sucking over there?

520
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing I think.

521
00:41:14,903 --> 00:41:16,545
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because they're probably...

522
00:41:17,345 --> 00:41:17,645
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

523
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, and I want to say this too.

524
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:49,085
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTetsuya in our chat room at chat.orangehauntryday.com says, so then the game itself will only cost $29.99 new, right EA, right?

525
00:41:50,106 --> 00:41:53,688
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's still going to cost $59.99 or let's just say $60, okay?

526
00:41:54,069 --> 00:41:58,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Because unless you live in Oregon or one of those other states with no sales tax, you're going to pay $60 plus for it.

527
00:42:00,493 --> 00:42:08,498
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing to keep in mind though, this won't affect you if you're buying your games new because you get your free code with the game and you know since it's new that no one's used it, etc., etc.

528
00:42:08,878 --> 00:42:10,039
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know that you're good.

529
00:42:11,948 --> 00:42:17,151
[SPEAKER_02]: That means... Isn't GameStop going to have to alter their policy now where they're not going to take returns on these games anymore?

530
00:42:17,251 --> 00:42:19,092
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they will take the returns on the games.

531
00:42:19,112 --> 00:42:22,514
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, you know, download content that would be coming with the game.

532
00:42:22,934 --> 00:42:34,041
[SPEAKER_03]: They do this a lot now where they're bundling in some DLC, like a coupon or something like that for the first piece of DLC for free or some in-game hat or something like that that you get for free.

533
00:42:34,461 --> 00:42:36,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to entice people to buy new games.

534
00:42:37,342 --> 00:42:39,203
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing for me...

535
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:43,125
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I don't know because I don't play sports games a lot.

536
00:42:43,325 --> 00:42:45,286
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I wouldn't care.

537
00:42:46,187 --> 00:42:50,169
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, if I were to buy Tiger Woods, you know, I wouldn't care that I couldn't play online.

538
00:42:51,317 --> 00:42:52,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't buy Tiger Woods

539
00:43:21,677 --> 00:43:26,960
[SPEAKER_02]: I worry about the precedent it sets, and the part that kind of irritates me is that I feel like I'm being double-dipped.

540
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm paying for Xbox Live, and now you want me to pay for this as well if it's used.

541
00:43:32,022 --> 00:43:33,323
[SPEAKER_02]: That, I have a problem with.

542
00:43:33,363 --> 00:43:33,823
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.

543
00:43:33,963 --> 00:43:35,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I will admit, I am weird.

544
00:43:35,564 --> 00:43:36,104
[SPEAKER_02]: This is weird.

545
00:43:36,784 --> 00:43:39,546
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a problem with it on PlayStation, because PlayStation's free.

546
00:43:39,626 --> 00:43:41,607
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot for me to complain about there.

547
00:43:42,127 --> 00:43:47,889
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't say, like, oh, well, you know, it's wrong for them to charge you to use their servers and all that stuff when...

548
00:43:49,470 --> 00:44:18,290
[SPEAKER_02]: you know you're not really paying anything for it in the first place and if you want to use these features then you know I get it but I thought that's what I was already paying for on Xbox Live I understand that EA uses their own servers and I understand that it's kind of separate like that but then does that mean that the restriction will be removed where I no longer need an Xbox Live Gold account to play these online if that's the case then okay I guess that it's the same as the PlayStation and I can't really argue but otherwise I feel like I'm being charged twice

549
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:19,031
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

550
00:44:32,248 --> 00:44:34,490
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that EA is in Square's...

551
00:44:54,225 --> 00:45:03,087
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that also it was the fact that they would be getting something that no one would have ever expected to be on one of their systems.

552
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:08,849
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was, I think, to get really to get into the market share.

553
00:45:09,189 --> 00:45:12,170
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to get EA games anyway.

554
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:20,075
[SPEAKER_05]: EA would be completely just butt-tarded to not put out a game on Xbox 360.

555
00:45:20,315 --> 00:45:21,976
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's it.

556
00:45:22,116 --> 00:45:23,737
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing a lot of stuff in this Project $10.

557
00:45:23,777 --> 00:45:30,642
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the way that they changed the DLC, the way they kind of give it to you in Mass Effect 2.

558
00:45:32,303 --> 00:45:33,784
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not the first company to try this.

559
00:45:33,824 --> 00:45:40,608
[SPEAKER_03]: They did the same thing with SOCOM on the PSP to try to curtail people buying the used game.

560
00:45:44,191 --> 00:45:56,621
[SPEAKER_03]: My problem is basically GameStop, their money is made and used product, and they've been ballsy enough before to make publishers pay for shell space and stuff like that.

561
00:45:57,222 --> 00:46:02,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't they be ballsy now to go, we think this is a stupid idea, and what's EA going to do?

562
00:46:02,867 --> 00:46:04,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we're going to stop selling our games to your stores?

563
00:46:05,409 --> 00:46:07,030
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to take a cut that big.

564
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:08,491
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they may try to...

565
00:46:09,792 --> 00:46:13,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Make that bluff, but if you call them on it, they're not going to do anything.

566
00:46:13,793 --> 00:46:15,393
[SPEAKER_03]: And even if they did, you know what?

567
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:24,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen Blockbuster or Movie Gallery or somebody, they stopped carrying a certain vendor's product for quite a while.

568
00:46:25,235 --> 00:46:30,076
[SPEAKER_03]: And just basically saying, well, if you don't want to play by our rules, then we're just going to stop carrying your product.

569
00:46:30,396 --> 00:46:32,657
[SPEAKER_03]: And it hit them big time, and they ended up...

570
00:46:33,837 --> 00:46:34,318
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

571
00:46:50,598 --> 00:46:56,101
[SPEAKER_02]: But buying the game used for $40 and buying the $10 online is still cheaper than buying the game new.

572
00:46:56,622 --> 00:46:58,183
[SPEAKER_02]: And EA still gets a tiny bit of money.

573
00:46:58,503 --> 00:47:00,024
[SPEAKER_02]: So you win, you got a cheaper game.

574
00:47:00,424 --> 00:47:03,246
[SPEAKER_02]: EA wins, they get money to pay their sysadmins.

575
00:47:03,566 --> 00:47:05,807
[SPEAKER_02]: And GameStop wins because you bought a used game from them.

576
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:11,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I want to stop there because I get what you're saying and I'm like 95% with you.

577
00:47:12,251 --> 00:47:15,413
[SPEAKER_02]: But the soccer moms buying the games for these kids lose.

578
00:47:15,853 --> 00:47:19,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they don't understand that there's a hidden $10 fee that's going to come with us.

579
00:47:19,514 --> 00:47:22,395
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what else sucks too?

580
00:47:22,655 --> 00:47:22,835
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

581
00:47:23,015 --> 00:47:25,376
[SPEAKER_03]: EA, they shut down their servers after some time.

582
00:47:25,516 --> 00:47:30,378
[SPEAKER_03]: So you paid the extra money to play this game online and then it's not there.

583
00:47:30,558 --> 00:47:35,440
[SPEAKER_02]: If all of that is disclosed in the agreement, I'm borderline comfortable with it.

584
00:47:36,439 --> 00:47:42,243
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's kind of like a little bit of back and forth here between BlackWolf and Toagak and some stuff here.

585
00:47:42,823 --> 00:47:45,645
[SPEAKER_02]: BlackWolf says, And Toagak was trying to recall a game that required them both.

586
00:47:45,665 --> 00:47:46,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't think of one.

587
00:47:46,946 --> 00:47:48,367
[SPEAKER_02]: And Bobby says, Oh, you can't remember.

588
00:47:48,387 --> 00:47:48,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha ha.

589
00:47:56,852 --> 00:48:00,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this $10 is not a monthly fee, though, either, right?

590
00:48:00,634 --> 00:48:05,356
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a one-time fee to do the game for the duration.

591
00:48:05,396 --> 00:48:07,617
[SPEAKER_03]: And you do get the 70 trials, so you can try it out.

592
00:48:07,657 --> 00:48:12,139
[SPEAKER_03]: If the online's really not something that you care for, then you don't have to do it.

593
00:48:12,439 --> 00:48:23,485
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing I was thinking of, and I'm sure that they've thought of this and they don't have System Link in the game anymore, is System Link games, you can use tunneling services to actually play online with other people.

594
00:48:24,145 --> 00:48:25,426
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can use that.

595
00:48:25,946 --> 00:48:32,191
[SPEAKER_03]: It basically acts like it's a system-linked game, but you're playing it over the internet like you did with the GameCube and stuff like that with Mario Kart.

596
00:48:34,192 --> 00:48:35,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I don't know.

597
00:48:35,293 --> 00:48:38,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just a little worried, like, what happens next?

598
00:48:38,776 --> 00:48:43,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if this ends up being acceptable, then what happens next?

599
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:44,059
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?

600
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:48,623
[SPEAKER_02]: They get you for $10 here, and, you know, I don't know.

601
00:48:48,643 --> 00:48:50,464
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not losing money left and right, either.

602
00:48:50,544 --> 00:48:51,965
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this kind of stuff will get...

603
00:48:52,165 --> 00:48:54,026
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an experiment for them.

604
00:48:54,066 --> 00:48:56,507
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just seeing, huh, what can we get away with?

605
00:48:56,607 --> 00:49:00,869
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like the $15 map packs for Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.

606
00:49:01,589 --> 00:49:02,589
[SPEAKER_03]: What can we get away with?

607
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:02,589
$15?

608
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:04,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if people buy this.

609
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:06,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, people are buying this like crazy?

610
00:49:06,051 --> 00:49:08,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's release another map pack for $15.

611
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:13,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just... If people are going to buy this stuff left and right and just not even think about it...

612
00:49:14,654 --> 00:49:17,236
[SPEAKER_03]: There may be a lot of people that decide, hey, we're going to buy this game used.

613
00:49:17,877 --> 00:49:22,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Better off, if you really want to get this game cheaper, don't buy it used.

614
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wait for the drop in price and buy it new.

615
00:49:25,783 --> 00:49:30,667
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess the moral of the story, if you will, is so we can kind of move on with some other news.

616
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:33,048
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't like it, don't buy it.

617
00:49:33,889 --> 00:49:43,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be one of those Left 4 Dead 2 petitioners that sign the petition against the game and then are caught on Steam playing the game the day it comes out.

618
00:49:44,176 --> 00:49:47,858
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are really against this, don't buy it and mean it.

619
00:49:49,994 --> 00:49:54,477
[SPEAKER_05]: How about something a little bit more possibly encouraging?

620
00:49:54,898 --> 00:49:55,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

621
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:57,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe facepalming, maybe a little bit.

622
00:50:00,482 --> 00:50:07,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Walmart actually is going to be back in the used game business.

623
00:50:08,207 --> 00:50:18,375
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be working with Game Trade, which is a startup services provider with the lease to test their little Game Trade stores in different Walmart places.

624
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:23,019
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only about five of them, but it's going to be previously owned games.

625
00:50:24,741 --> 00:50:28,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Movies, hardware, basically you get store credit or cash.

626
00:50:30,967 --> 00:50:38,174
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, they're going to be like, I guess, what GameStop was for used games, only Walmart.

627
00:50:39,065 --> 00:50:56,888
[SPEAKER_03]: well they didn't really get out of the used game market I mean the company going under that was doing their kiosk kind of they didn't have a choice so they're kind of trying the same thing again since they didn't really I don't think they launched it full steam while that company was working with them dvd play

628
00:50:57,168 --> 00:50:59,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember ever seeing used games at Walmart.

629
00:50:59,110 --> 00:50:59,991
[SPEAKER_03]: That was just being tested.

630
00:51:00,011 --> 00:51:01,031
[SPEAKER_03]: They were in test locations.

631
00:51:01,051 --> 00:51:10,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, test locations of a new company, or ePlay is what it was, and they were doing it with Best Buy and stuff like that, and they went out of business.

632
00:51:10,279 --> 00:51:14,723
[SPEAKER_03]: So now this new company, new kiosk vendor, is coming out trying to do the same thing.

633
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:17,405
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens there, because...

634
00:51:18,226 --> 00:51:26,400
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a tough market to compete in, but granted, used games, there's not a lot of kiosks out there for that stuff, so it could catch on.

635
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:27,181
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be neat.

636
00:51:27,862 --> 00:51:31,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I just worry about those things that there's too many ways to exploit them, but

637
00:51:33,453 --> 00:51:33,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

638
00:51:51,773 --> 00:51:55,676
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just don't think I like that that competition is Walmart, you know?

639
00:51:56,236 --> 00:52:00,259
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of... Well, I mean... Walmart does everything else.

640
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we really need them in this, too?

641
00:52:01,741 --> 00:52:15,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, at least if, you know, money gets tight and you need to buy dinner, you know, you can always trade in your game and buy dinner with the coupon or the store credit that you get, so... That's always good instead of... Hard to argue with that, okay.

642
00:52:15,611 --> 00:52:17,032
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, at least there's that option.

643
00:52:18,973 --> 00:52:20,054
[SPEAKER_03]: But, like, as far as...

644
00:52:22,018 --> 00:52:23,920
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as trading in stuff, I don't know.

645
00:52:24,061 --> 00:52:33,090
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really what they need out there is a website, and this would be pretty impossible to get considering I don't think GameStop would be sharing what their trading prices are.

646
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:40,377
[SPEAKER_03]: But if there was a website to compare trading prices based on title per these different places, that would be kind of cool.

647
00:52:40,817 --> 00:52:43,180
[SPEAKER_03]: But once again, they're not going to give that information out.

648
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:45,122
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think they're going to give that out either.

649
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:47,420
[SPEAKER_02]: GameStop GameStop GameStop

650
00:53:03,579 --> 00:53:06,860
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would worry that a place like Walmart isn't going to really care.

651
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,600
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's going to be a lot of people to get taken advantage of.

652
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:14,761
[SPEAKER_02]: And buy back games that are all scratchy, yucky, and codes are used.

653
00:53:14,781 --> 00:53:16,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the problem though, Rob, with that.

654
00:53:16,281 --> 00:53:17,061
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a kiosk.

655
00:53:17,221 --> 00:53:19,582
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not... It's a machine.

656
00:53:19,602 --> 00:53:20,662
[SPEAKER_02]: God, that's even worse.

657
00:53:20,722 --> 00:53:23,362
[SPEAKER_02]: How does the machine know what games are in good condition and what aren't?

658
00:53:23,582 --> 00:53:24,323
[SPEAKER_02]: It tries to read them.

659
00:53:24,523 --> 00:53:25,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, weird.

660
00:53:25,283 --> 00:53:26,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it reads this.

661
00:53:27,323 --> 00:53:27,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Weird.

662
00:53:27,683 --> 00:53:30,664
[SPEAKER_03]: It checks them to see if they're able to be read.

663
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,144
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is though is...

664
00:53:33,004 --> 00:53:40,109
[SPEAKER_03]: You could trick the machine by using some sort of burn disc or something like that and it might not be able to tell the difference between it.

665
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:49,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, then you have your credit card, but once again, it's also easy to buy a prepaid credit card and you can do the same thing.

666
00:53:50,077 --> 00:53:56,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Put whatever person's name, social on there that you want and do it and you can get away with the money.

667
00:53:56,481 --> 00:53:58,343
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be telling people how to do this on the show, Loki.

668
00:53:58,363 --> 00:53:59,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying, hey, I think it...

669
00:54:01,365 --> 00:54:02,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I work out the flaws.

670
00:54:02,687 --> 00:54:07,052
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've thought of it, somebody a little more shady has definitely already thought of it.

671
00:54:08,313 --> 00:54:10,656
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, not everybody's thinking that way.

672
00:54:10,756 --> 00:54:14,560
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could probably factor that in.

673
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:15,702
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

674
00:54:17,103 --> 00:54:17,924
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be interesting to see.

675
00:54:17,944 --> 00:54:22,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because, hey, who thought renting DVDs from a kiosk was going to take off?

676
00:54:23,311 --> 00:54:24,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a lot of people did.

677
00:54:24,593 --> 00:54:28,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Still not going to make me stop shopping at Target over Walmart.

678
00:54:28,638 --> 00:54:30,000
[SPEAKER_02]: But, hey, you know what, though?

679
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:33,023
[SPEAKER_03]: If it takes off at Walmart, who says that Target's not going to do it?

680
00:54:33,163 --> 00:54:35,767
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, if this company is anything like E-Play was...

681
00:54:36,107 --> 00:54:53,792
[SPEAKER_03]: they could easily have the same damn kiosk it's just branded with the Target stuff and it would be the same service right there and they could double dip basically in the market and there's nothing really stopping them from doing that unless they sign some sort of weird contract for it which they very well might have so you never know very true we'll see what happens

682
00:54:55,253 --> 00:55:00,777
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's some rumors now regarding when the PlayStation Move and Natal is going to be launched.

683
00:55:01,958 --> 00:55:04,981
[SPEAKER_03]: The rumor is that PlayStation Move is supposed to launch in September.

684
00:55:05,361 --> 00:55:10,285
[SPEAKER_03]: This is coming from Jason Bradbury, the host of Britain's The Gadget Show.

685
00:55:10,965 --> 00:55:17,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, he's proclaiming that the PlayStation Move controller will be released in September.

686
00:55:18,591 --> 00:55:19,832
[SPEAKER_03]: I put on his Twitter account.

687
00:55:20,193 --> 00:55:23,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing I was meaning to say, September for PlayStation Move.

688
00:55:23,715 --> 00:55:24,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure of it.

689
00:55:24,636 --> 00:55:25,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't say why.

690
00:55:25,557 --> 00:55:26,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Just September 2010.

691
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, if I was a betting man, that's a pretty good bet.

692
00:55:32,502 --> 00:55:34,264
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be this fall, okay?

693
00:55:34,284 --> 00:55:36,125
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it's fall.

694
00:55:36,706 --> 00:55:38,467
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know it's before Black Friday.

695
00:55:38,807 --> 00:55:41,109
[SPEAKER_02]: It must, must, must be before Black Friday.

696
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:43,151
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does that really leave?

697
00:55:44,172 --> 00:55:46,834
[SPEAKER_02]: October, November, and maybe September.

698
00:55:47,728 --> 00:55:51,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's how you know when the PlayStation Move is scheduled to come out.

699
00:55:51,871 --> 00:55:56,675
[SPEAKER_03]: You look at the titles that are supporting the PlayStation Move and where they're sitting as far as releases go.

700
00:55:57,355 --> 00:56:04,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything that I've seen so far is pointing to November, which makes sense because that's when they seem to launch new consoles and whatnot.

701
00:56:04,521 --> 00:56:05,702
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be betting November.

702
00:56:07,426 --> 00:56:08,307
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

703
00:56:08,708 --> 00:56:12,693
[SPEAKER_02]: So you are going to go against the British guy from Gadgets or whatever?

704
00:56:12,713 --> 00:56:14,295
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know who the fuck Jason Bradbury is.

705
00:56:14,736 --> 00:56:15,817
[SPEAKER_03]: The Gadget Show.

706
00:56:16,278 --> 00:56:16,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Good for you.

707
00:56:17,019 --> 00:56:17,920
[SPEAKER_03]: You think something.

708
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:21,204
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you should challenge Jason Bradbury to a throwdown.

709
00:56:21,665 --> 00:56:22,466
[SPEAKER_02]: A throwdown?

710
00:56:23,667 --> 00:56:34,717
[SPEAKER_03]: A hoedown throwdown Whatever, I could be like Michael Patcher and say random shit And if I'm right, I'm a genius If I'm wrong, no one will remember So, whatever I'm an analyst!

711
00:56:34,777 --> 00:56:42,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we should just start calling you an analyst We need to have a segment on the show Analyst Loki No, but I'm serious How about analist?

712
00:56:42,823 --> 00:56:43,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay

713
00:56:45,069 --> 00:57:10,133
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm serious though, like, look at, um, look at iPad, iPad is supporting the PlayStation Move, and that's supposed to be coming out in the fall, um, Lord of the Rings, Eragon's Quest, whatever's supposed to be coming out, um, in the fall as well, because that's now supporting the move on the PlayStation 3, um, LittleBigPlanet 2 will probably be coming out, like, this fall, I'm guessing, it, it's all gonna be around the same time, um,

714
00:57:12,017 --> 00:57:32,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about September I guess it could be September if you think about it because they are starting to support games now with the PlayStation Move stuff so publishers have access to it and I guess they could do that but I would be more willing to bet it's going to be closer to Christmas just to catch in on that holiday buying madness we'll see

715
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:36,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Now see, where's that story going to be on all the game blogs tomorrow?

716
00:57:36,187 --> 00:57:53,207
[SPEAKER_02]: That world-renowned, years-long-running game analyst Loki has predicted on some little crappy web show, just like this other thing, the gadget show or whatever, that Move is coming out in November.

717
00:57:53,487 --> 00:57:55,469
[SPEAKER_02]: He is sure of it, folks.

718
00:57:55,669 --> 00:57:56,790
[SPEAKER_02]: He is sure of it.

719
00:57:57,031 --> 00:57:58,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just put it this way, okay?

720
00:57:58,352 --> 00:58:01,355
[SPEAKER_03]: And this goes both against me and against him.

721
00:58:02,056 --> 00:58:04,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because we're hosts of a show doesn't mean we know what we're talking about.

722
00:58:06,861 --> 00:58:12,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because he hosts a TV show does not mean he knows exactly when the PlayStation move's coming out.

723
00:58:13,087 --> 00:58:13,668
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good guess.

724
00:58:14,008 --> 00:58:14,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Fourth quarter, duh.

725
00:58:15,209 --> 00:58:16,811
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be coming out fourth quarter, so...

726
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:19,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever that is.

727
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:21,181
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's September, great.

728
00:58:21,241 --> 00:58:22,321
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be nice and early.

729
00:58:22,902 --> 00:58:29,326
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, from what I've seen, their major Sony releases have either been in November or October.

730
00:58:29,927 --> 00:58:32,469
[SPEAKER_03]: October, like last year, for example, because he had Uncharted 2.

731
00:58:35,271 --> 00:58:36,892
[SPEAKER_03]: God, there was other Sony titles last year.

732
00:58:37,192 --> 00:58:40,534
[SPEAKER_03]: But LittleBigPlanet was also in October as well.

733
00:58:40,874 --> 00:58:45,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Although Resistance 2, I believe, was in November.

734
00:58:46,238 --> 00:58:48,300
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's all around that same time.

735
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,801
[SPEAKER_03]: They have released schedules.

736
00:58:50,941 --> 00:58:52,222
[SPEAKER_03]: What about Natal, then?

737
00:58:52,823 --> 00:58:57,005
[SPEAKER_03]: What does our analyst think about Project Natal?

738
00:58:57,365 --> 00:59:00,327
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying that it's going to be releasing in October.

739
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:06,791
[SPEAKER_03]: This is according to Microsoft's Saudi vendor.

740
00:59:06,851 --> 00:59:10,654
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not even really working for Microsoft yet.

741
00:59:10,994 --> 00:59:24,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Although they quote him as working with Microsoft, apparently G4 has said that Saeed Bilal is not a Microsoft employee.

742
00:59:24,145 --> 00:59:31,891
[SPEAKER_03]: He is a vendor employed through a third-party company on behalf of a Microsoft subsidiary in Saudi Arabia.

743
00:59:34,813 --> 00:59:35,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Pardon me, pardon me.

744
00:59:35,754 --> 00:59:37,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Who do you trust more, G4 or Analyst Loki?

745
00:59:56,212 --> 00:59:58,334
[SPEAKER_02]: G4 or Loki?

746
00:59:58,834 --> 00:59:59,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Ready?

747
00:59:59,074 --> 00:59:59,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Go.

748
01:00:21,091 --> 01:00:24,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's gonna be definitely in October.

749
01:00:25,034 --> 01:00:30,998
[SPEAKER_03]: And once again, it's because all the major stuff that's been released is usually around that November time.

750
01:00:31,078 --> 01:00:34,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, granted, they could do the fall update early.

751
01:00:34,581 --> 01:00:36,843
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be timed with the fall update, basically.

752
01:00:37,043 --> 01:00:38,064
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna have the fall update...

753
01:00:38,704 --> 01:00:55,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Slightly before this is launched, just like when they did the Avatars, the new Xbox experience, whatever, they had their new Scenic game come out slightly before this new update came out.

754
01:00:55,428 --> 01:01:01,810
[SPEAKER_03]: So you kind of look at what the games are, what games are supporting Natal and stuff, and what their release schedule is going to be like, and you can kind of guess...

755
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:03,491
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com.

756
01:01:26,926 --> 01:01:32,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the results of our quick poll chat in our chatroom, chat.orange.com Who do you trust more, G4 or Loki?

757
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:39,554
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Loki, Analyst Loki, I trust Banana Man, Loki for sure, Homer Simpson, Analyst Loki, Analyst Loki.

758
01:01:40,534 --> 01:01:43,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I trust the bird because the bird is the word.

759
01:01:43,496 --> 01:01:44,237
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop it!

760
01:01:50,500 --> 01:02:14,652
[SPEAKER_02]: um let's see uh Loki at least he mentions games I work on we all trust Loki because we all love Secret Club analist Loki over anything although anything is better than G4 I don't know G4 has hotness G4 has ninja challenge that is a good point G4 does have ninja challenge Loki not the OLR the Norse god I've trusted Loki with my life before or budget at least and there you go

761
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:21,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be willing to bet that we'll find out probably before it's released.

762
01:02:22,448 --> 01:02:27,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, well, obviously we're going to find out before it's released, but we were going to find out before they announce it.

763
01:02:27,635 --> 01:02:28,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put it that way.

764
01:02:30,223 --> 01:02:36,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, do you think you know a catchphrase that ought to be in the next NBA Jam?

765
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:48,583
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you have the next Boom Shakalaka, if you know Boom Shakalaka, he's on fire, you know, if you have the next catchphrase for NBA Jam, they want to know.

766
01:02:49,364 --> 01:03:00,358
[SPEAKER_02]: EA Sports has come out and said that they're doing this whole little contest about the next catchphrase in NBA Jam.

767
01:03:00,399 --> 01:03:02,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, it's taking place on Facebook.

768
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:07,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to facebook.com slash NBA Jam and you can submit your entries up until...

769
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:09,329
[SPEAKER_02]: May 19th, 9 a.m.

770
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:10,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Pacific Time.

771
01:03:10,209 --> 01:03:11,130
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't give you much time.

772
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:19,893
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be fan voting on the top 64 entries and the one with the highest votes will be immortalized in the game.

773
01:03:21,014 --> 01:03:25,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they say the entries must be associated with one of the following actions in the game.

774
01:03:25,936 --> 01:03:37,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Dunks, assist, alley-oops, blocks, three-point shots, two-point field goal, on-fire shots, steals, shot clock violations, rebounds, missed shots.

775
01:03:38,146 --> 01:03:47,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Catchphrases should avoid a reference to specific NBA players, and they must not contain pornography, illicit content, and must be appropriate for audiences 13 years of age.

776
01:03:47,493 --> 01:03:50,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I listened to the ad for that.

777
01:03:51,116 --> 01:03:52,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan played it the other day.

778
01:03:52,116 --> 01:03:53,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, dude, it's the guy.

779
01:03:55,479 --> 01:03:57,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Alpha Cananogram suggests, and boom goes the dynamite.

780
01:04:00,646 --> 01:04:02,508
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great YouTube clip, by the way, if you've never seen it.

781
01:04:02,548 --> 01:04:03,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom goes the dynamite.

782
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:04,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that should be in the game.

783
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:05,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom goes the dynamite.

784
01:04:06,973 --> 01:04:07,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

785
01:04:07,714 --> 01:04:11,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking that maybe they could do something with the bird.

786
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:13,120
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

787
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:19,499
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ 100 Matt saying that we should have an OLR catchphrase in it.

788
01:04:19,579 --> 01:04:20,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

789
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:22,940
[SPEAKER_02]: What OLR catchphrase would lend itself to basketball?

790
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:23,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

791
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:24,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Like ferret?

792
01:04:24,821 --> 01:04:25,701
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't really work.

793
01:04:26,241 --> 01:04:27,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Exterminate?

794
01:04:27,201 --> 01:04:27,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you really?

795
01:04:27,762 --> 01:04:30,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's really a Doctor Who thing that we just kind of stole.

796
01:04:31,063 --> 01:04:32,943
[SPEAKER_02]: What other OLR catchphrases do we have?

797
01:04:32,983 --> 01:04:33,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

798
01:04:33,943 --> 01:04:34,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have other catchphrases?

799
01:04:34,924 --> 01:04:36,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Your mom.

800
01:04:36,724 --> 01:04:38,925
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, what?

801
01:04:39,545 --> 01:04:40,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

802
01:04:40,605 --> 01:04:42,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that'll do it.

803
01:04:43,753 --> 01:04:48,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other folks are saying that they should try to sneak in an OLR reference into the catchphrases.

804
01:04:49,315 --> 01:04:51,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't know what that OLR catchphrase would be.

805
01:04:53,717 --> 01:04:54,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Ferret!

806
01:04:55,617 --> 01:04:56,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Duck Island?

807
01:04:56,638 --> 01:04:56,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

808
01:04:57,578 --> 01:04:58,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Duck Island might work.

809
01:04:59,439 --> 01:05:01,579
[SPEAKER_02]: He made that shot all the way from Duck Island!

810
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:03,860
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like, what?

811
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:06,261
[SPEAKER_02]: That shot coming in from Duck Island!

812
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:10,371
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

813
01:05:10,831 --> 01:05:11,651
[SPEAKER_05]: How about no?

814
01:05:12,272 --> 01:05:14,313
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just J100 Matt says friend your butt.

815
01:05:16,014 --> 01:05:18,155
[SPEAKER_05]: He'll friend your butt, dunk!

816
01:05:21,303 --> 01:05:25,645
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that won't work either because that might not be appropriate for audiences under 13.

817
01:05:25,705 --> 01:05:25,986
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

818
01:05:26,646 --> 01:05:28,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there will be a future list list.

819
01:05:28,347 --> 01:05:28,927
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

820
01:05:28,947 --> 01:05:30,008
[SPEAKER_02]: The contest will be over by then.

821
01:05:30,028 --> 01:05:30,828
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

822
01:05:32,449 --> 01:05:32,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at him.

823
01:05:32,969 --> 01:05:34,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Handle those balls.

824
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:34,570
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

825
01:05:34,590 --> 01:05:37,752
[SPEAKER_03]: That ain't appropriate.

826
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:41,534
[SPEAKER_05]: But it did make me laugh.

827
01:05:41,954 --> 01:05:42,695
[SPEAKER_05]: It did make me laugh.

828
01:05:43,475 --> 01:05:43,755
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

829
01:05:44,336 --> 01:05:50,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on with some more news and, of course, release dates coming up and the classic game of the week at some point tonight.

830
01:05:50,733 --> 01:05:52,319
[SPEAKER_05]: How about something that isn't crappy?

831
01:05:53,864 --> 01:05:56,595
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a Castlevania game coming out on the iPhone, Rob.

832
01:05:58,177 --> 01:05:58,797
[SPEAKER_02]: OMG What?

833
01:05:59,338 --> 01:05:59,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

834
01:05:59,798 --> 01:06:00,018
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

835
01:06:00,678 --> 01:06:05,440
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Encore of the Night, which is really a puzzle game.

836
01:06:06,461 --> 01:06:10,822
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be hard to control, right?

837
01:06:11,963 --> 01:06:16,485
[SPEAKER_05]: When I looked at it, I was like, oh, it's Puzzle Fighter and Puzzle Quest.

838
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:26,429
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically the little screen capture on here is Alucard playing against one of the fish guys who hangs out in Dracula's basement.

839
01:06:27,919 --> 01:06:29,040
[SPEAKER_05]: But it could be fun.

840
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:33,103
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm going to try it out, you know, but it also looks like it's timed.

841
01:06:34,685 --> 01:06:37,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Each of your little matches is timed because there's an hourglass.

842
01:06:38,368 --> 01:06:42,551
[SPEAKER_02]: But why can't they just... Or maybe when the timer runs out, something bad happens.

843
01:06:43,752 --> 01:06:46,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the fish guy takes a big poop or something, I don't know.

844
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:48,777
[SPEAKER_02]: And eats your face.

845
01:06:48,857 --> 01:06:49,737
[SPEAKER_02]: And poops your face.

846
01:06:50,058 --> 01:06:50,838
[SPEAKER_05]: He friends your butt.

847
01:06:50,858 --> 01:06:51,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

848
01:06:54,521 --> 01:06:55,142
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be cool.

849
01:06:57,771 --> 01:06:58,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.

850
01:06:58,712 --> 01:06:59,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I like puzzle games.

851
01:06:59,693 --> 01:07:00,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Castlevania.

852
01:07:01,635 --> 01:07:02,436
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all in the price.

853
01:07:03,437 --> 01:07:03,997
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all in the price.

854
01:07:04,297 --> 01:07:07,621
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, some more suggestions for the NBA Jam thing from our chat.

855
01:07:07,641 --> 01:07:09,623
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gotta say, this is my favorite so far from SSJ100 Matt.

856
01:07:09,643 --> 01:07:09,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Dongle!

857
01:07:14,738 --> 01:07:15,219
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good one.

858
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:15,799
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good one.

859
01:07:18,182 --> 01:07:19,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I might be saying this wrong.

860
01:07:20,164 --> 01:07:20,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Shesro?

861
01:07:21,145 --> 01:07:22,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Shurzo.

862
01:07:22,466 --> 01:07:22,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Shurzo.

863
01:07:23,187 --> 01:07:24,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Shurzo says double down.

864
01:07:25,429 --> 01:07:27,831
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like in reference to Loki's least favorite KFC food.

865
01:07:28,732 --> 01:07:29,012
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

866
01:07:29,833 --> 01:07:30,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on to some release dates.

867
01:07:31,014 --> 01:07:34,358
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to travel around the world and look at some release dates, Loki.

868
01:07:34,858 --> 01:07:36,820
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to look at some release dates.

869
01:07:37,001 --> 01:07:38,062
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't really work for...

870
01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:40,151
[SPEAKER_03]: NBA Jam.

871
01:07:40,171 --> 01:07:42,336
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it doesn't.

872
01:07:43,258 --> 01:07:44,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, actually some good stuff coming up this week.

873
01:07:47,791 --> 01:07:51,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Big push for games until Memorial Day.

874
01:07:51,613 --> 01:07:53,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, until July.

875
01:07:55,055 --> 01:07:58,657
[SPEAKER_03]: But this week, though, we have Split Second coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

876
01:07:58,717 --> 01:07:59,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Highly recommend picking that up.

877
01:07:59,858 --> 01:08:00,718
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually pretty awesome.

878
01:08:00,879 --> 01:08:02,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and also on PC, apparently.

879
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Shrek Forever After for the little tykes.

880
01:08:06,022 --> 01:08:09,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the new tie-in game with that movie that thankfully is...

881
01:08:10,524 --> 01:08:10,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Done.

882
01:08:11,245 --> 01:08:12,266
[SPEAKER_03]: No more Shrek movies.

883
01:08:12,646 --> 01:08:13,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

884
01:08:13,827 --> 01:08:18,070
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PSP.

885
01:08:20,152 --> 01:08:27,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Prince of Persia, The Forgotten Sands, making its way out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS, and PSP.

886
01:08:28,619 --> 01:08:38,747
[SPEAKER_03]: The PSP version is supposed to be 2D, and then they're also re-releasing Prince of Persia, The Sands of Time on PlayStation 2, in case you haven't picked that up and feel festive with the movie coming out and everything.

887
01:08:40,289 --> 01:08:46,920
[SPEAKER_03]: The game I'm definitely going to be playing a lot this week Red Dead Redemption coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week

888
01:08:49,674 --> 01:09:15,596
[SPEAKER_03]: City Builder coming out on the Wii until the forgotten about game that no one will be picking up Attack of the Movies 3D it's a parody of a bunch of movies including Terminator and you know Alien Mummy it's got 3D glasses and you can play in 3D it is a on-rails shooter game and what makes it even more bizarre is it's coming out in 360 as well how the fuck is that gonna work

889
01:09:16,892 --> 01:09:18,193
[SPEAKER_03]: with the analog sticks, I guess.

890
01:09:18,934 --> 01:09:19,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Horrible decision.

891
01:09:20,975 --> 01:09:28,281
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, Alan Wake making its way out on Xbox 360, and they're also doing a limited edition for that this week as well.

892
01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:32,062
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's basically it.

893
01:09:33,223 --> 01:09:34,824
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just J100 Matt in our chat room.

894
01:09:35,405 --> 01:09:38,107
[SPEAKER_02]: That play was better than a DS Master email.

895
01:09:38,968 --> 01:09:39,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

896
01:09:39,949 --> 01:09:40,889
[SPEAKER_03]: How did I miss this?

897
01:09:40,969 --> 01:09:41,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I must have scrolled too quickly.

898
01:09:42,671 --> 01:09:50,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine Animal Doctor Care Center on DS and then a better game, Blue Dragon Awakens Shadows come out on DS as well.

899
01:09:50,938 --> 01:09:53,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, ooh, I got a good one.

906
01:10:16,995 --> 01:10:22,360
[SPEAKER_02]: That is an updated version of an old game that's now on the Xbox 360.

907
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:23,801

01:11:03,783 --> 01:11:08,626
[SPEAKER_02]: On the PlayStation 2, Tier Nanog is getting a price reduction.

918
01:11:17,752 --> 01:11:20,054

919
01:11:20,474 --> 01:11:22,976
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Nintendo DS, Captain Tsubasa.

920

[SPEAKER_02]: and Gekituo no Kiseki comes out this week.

921
01:11:26,717 --> 01:11:29,558
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a soccer type of game, I guess, with all the winning 11.

922
01:11:29,858 --> 01:11:31,439
[SPEAKER_02]: The DS wants in on the action as well.

923
01:11:31,459 --> 01:11:32,219
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also a manga.

924
01:11:32,519 --> 01:11:32,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Different game.

930
01:11:46,264 --> 01:12:12,360
[SPEAKER_02]: yes it's a Fullmetal Alchemist game on the PSP as to what type of game it is I think you actually kind of get to play as Ed and Al you get to I don't know if it's like a kind of like a little like 3D adventure game with a lot of like cut scenes and dialogue so it's a I think it'll do Fullmetal Alchemist fans some justice there so check that out on the PSP this week in Japan those are Japanese release dates

931
01:12:13,782 --> 01:12:18,867
[SPEAKER_05]: In the UK, we have on the 18th, Dragon Age Origins, Darkspawn Chronicles.

01:12:34,142 --> 01:12:34,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Busy week.

936
01:12:37,592 --> 01:12:38,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, alright.

937
01:12:39,074 --> 01:12:41,977
[SPEAKER_02]: More gaming news than the classic game of the week coming right up.

938
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:50,166
[SPEAKER_02]: And DarkSakura, I'm not going to spoil what the game is this week, but she just picked a game where she's like, yeah, pretty much everyone says this is a classic.

939
01:12:52,348 --> 01:12:53,349
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll get to that in a little bit.

940
01:12:53,650 --> 01:12:59,516
[SPEAKER_05]: To put it a little bit more, it's a game that Dan and I played a lot of when we first got together.

941
01:13:00,097 --> 01:13:01,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Capcom is working on an MMO

942
01:13:19,898 --> 01:13:20,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Call it Mega Man Online.

943
01:13:21,459 --> 01:13:28,263
[SPEAKER_03]: And according to GameSpot, they're saying it's being co-developed by Korea's NeoWiz Games.

944
01:13:28,783 --> 01:13:31,605
[SPEAKER_03]: They're responsible for EA Sports FIFA Online.

945
01:13:32,585 --> 01:13:39,609
[SPEAKER_03]: And possibly might be related to the Mega Man Universe game.

946
01:13:40,189 --> 01:13:45,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe it's... Could be different names, different regions, too.

947
01:13:45,992 --> 01:13:46,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

948
01:13:46,773 --> 01:13:47,313
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know.

949
01:13:47,333 --> 01:13:47,493
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

950
01:13:50,737 --> 01:13:51,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

951
01:13:51,117 --> 01:13:52,018
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of neat.

952
01:13:52,158 --> 01:13:55,779
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what they're really going to do for a Mega Man online game, but it'll be pretty awesome, I'm sure.

953
01:13:56,259 --> 01:14:00,641
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to admit, I kind of approach this with a big, huh.

954
01:14:01,181 --> 01:14:05,123
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just kind of like, how would a Mega Man online game work?

955
01:14:05,563 --> 01:14:09,704
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I think about Mega Man Legends, and I'm like, huh.

956
01:14:10,164 --> 01:14:11,765
[SPEAKER_02]: This could be interesting.

957
01:14:12,465 --> 01:14:13,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how yet.

958
01:14:13,546 --> 01:14:18,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Or imagine if you're not really playing as Mega Man, but imagine if you got to be your own robot master boss.

959
01:14:19,708 --> 01:14:21,049
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be kind of rad, actually.

960
01:14:21,450 --> 01:14:25,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, there's just, there's just, there's just something, things that make you go, hmm.

961
01:14:26,734 --> 01:14:28,496
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely a big hmm factor with this.

962
01:14:29,177 --> 01:14:30,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I don't know what to think.

963
01:14:30,538 --> 01:14:31,979
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll need to see screenshots or something.

964
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:34,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think you'll get to see more of this at E3?

965
01:14:35,142 --> 01:14:37,704
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be a little early, but that'd be kind of neat if they announced something.

966
01:14:39,406 --> 01:14:39,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

967
01:14:42,068 --> 01:14:44,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well we'll see what happens with Mega Man Online.

968
01:14:44,309 --> 01:14:50,590
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, do you like the idea of Mega Man going online or is it enough of the freaking MMOs already?

969
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:52,731
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good idea.

970
01:14:53,571 --> 01:14:54,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay for whoever wants to play it.

971
01:14:54,851 --> 01:14:55,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Good for them.

972
01:14:55,911 --> 01:14:56,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you play it?

973
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:57,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask Star Trek Online, dude.

974
01:14:59,052 --> 01:15:02,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you got to be a robot master boss, there's no robot master boss you'd want to be?

975
01:15:03,093 --> 01:15:05,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no.

976
01:15:06,474 --> 01:15:06,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

977
01:15:08,248 --> 01:15:09,269
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Sakura Woman.

978
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:13,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki could finally have Pizza Man for reals.

979
01:15:14,871 --> 01:15:16,792
[SPEAKER_02]: That reference is about five years old on this show.

980
01:15:16,833 --> 01:15:17,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Pizza Man.

981
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:19,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

982
01:15:20,274 --> 01:15:21,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a clip of that.

983
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me tell you how old that reference is.

984
01:15:23,656 --> 01:15:25,857
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a clip of that on our MySpace.

985
01:15:26,317 --> 01:15:26,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even remember.

986
01:15:27,738 --> 01:15:29,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we were talking about the Mega Man 2 sound effect thing.

987
01:15:56,318 --> 01:16:09,049
[SPEAKER_02]: who knows MTV is saying up and down they have not announced anything besides Green Day Rock Band and Rock Band 3 but they are quick to say we have a great relationship with Pearl Jam and hope to have many of their more awesome music in the game in the future

988
01:16:09,775 --> 01:16:10,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

989
01:16:11,636 --> 01:16:12,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

990
01:16:13,197 --> 01:16:15,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's where I have a problem with this right now.

991
01:16:16,379 --> 01:16:24,663
[SPEAKER_03]: They've given it a Peggy rating on the box art this early that the fact that they haven't even announced the game yet, it would not have a rating.

992
01:16:24,944 --> 01:16:26,324
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be rating pending.

993
01:16:26,344 --> 01:16:27,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good point.

994
01:16:28,186 --> 01:16:30,747
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fake.

995
01:16:30,927 --> 01:16:32,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Wishful thinking, basically.

996
01:16:32,822 --> 01:16:37,947
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know, like I kind of go, okay, yeah, I could see Pearl Jam getting their own rock band.

997
01:16:38,087 --> 01:16:42,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, and we've talked about this on the show before, there's only certain bands that can have a rock band.

998
01:16:43,552 --> 01:16:48,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, not every band is worthy of having a rock band game dedicated to them, but Pearl Jam, okay.

999
01:16:49,458 --> 01:16:54,121
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a survey that came out that was asking people what dedicated rock band games would you like to see?

1000
01:16:54,181 --> 01:16:57,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Which artists would you want to see have their game?

1001
01:16:57,483 --> 01:16:58,784
[SPEAKER_03]: And Pearl Jam was on the list.

1002
01:16:59,124 --> 01:17:00,765
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's a little bit of wishful thinking.

1003
01:17:00,805 --> 01:17:10,632
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like how with... Even if you look at GameStop's website and stuff like that, there's a bunch of listings for games like Pilotwings for the Wii and stuff like that.

1004
01:17:10,712 --> 01:17:14,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff that doesn't exist but that they're taking pre-orders on.

1005
01:17:15,275 --> 01:17:17,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in case, you know, that kind of stuff.

1006
01:17:17,596 --> 01:17:18,916
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Rock Band ABBA?

1007
01:17:19,097 --> 01:17:19,937
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one I want.

1008
01:17:21,477 --> 01:17:29,360
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, apparently, yeah, they are doing that little test right now, but there's also some news about how well these games are selling.

1009
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:36,623
[SPEAKER_02]: The NPD group is saying that Guitar Hero Van Halen only sold 94,000 copies, which kind of makes it a poop.

1010
01:17:37,383 --> 01:17:38,964
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it's hard to say.

1011
01:17:39,004 --> 01:17:41,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that count the free ones that went out?

1012
01:17:41,384 --> 01:17:45,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that sort of would kind of screw those numbers, wouldn't it?

1013
01:17:46,286 --> 01:17:48,647
[SPEAKER_03]: It's copies sold, so I would imagine, yes, it does.

1014
01:17:48,687 --> 01:17:53,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, to put it in perspective, Guitar Hero Aerosmith sold 2.7 million copies.

1015
01:17:53,988 --> 01:17:56,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero Metallica sold 1 million copies.

1016
01:17:56,789 --> 01:18:00,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Beatle Rock Band, 1.2 million copies.

1017
01:18:00,431 --> 01:18:04,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero Aerosmith sold twice as many as Beatle's Rock Band.

1018
01:18:05,052 --> 01:18:24,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, think about it though, Guitar Hero Aerosmith was first It was the first kind of, you know, one group exclusive game that came out And it seems like the numbers have slowly gone down since then And then Van Halen just kind of pooped, you know, didn't do much But it's hard to say, because again, they were giving that away for free Can you really trust that number?

1019
01:18:24,406 --> 01:18:30,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know It'll be very interesting to see how the Guitar Hero Green Day sells You know what's also not accounted for in here?

1020
01:18:31,330 --> 01:18:32,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I say Guitar Hero Green Day?

1021
01:18:32,491 --> 01:18:33,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I meant Rock Band Green Day

1022
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:38,713
[SPEAKER_02]: What's also not accounted for in here is the, like, wasn't there an ACDC rock band game that came out?

1023
01:18:39,253 --> 01:18:40,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see that in here anywhere.

1024
01:18:40,613 --> 01:18:42,114
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a live ACDC game.

1025
01:18:42,154 --> 01:18:44,174
[SPEAKER_02]: It was exclusive to Walmart for a little while, but then it wasn't.

1026
01:18:44,974 --> 01:18:46,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see numbers for that anywhere in here.

1027
01:18:47,335 --> 01:18:48,575
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no numbers for that.

1028
01:18:48,975 --> 01:18:49,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

1029
01:18:49,895 --> 01:18:55,036
[SPEAKER_03]: And just for the reference, on the Peggy website, there is no listing for that new rock band game.

1030
01:18:55,416 --> 01:18:57,197
[SPEAKER_03]: If it had a rating, it would be listed on there.

1031
01:18:57,517 --> 01:18:57,697
[SPEAKER_03]: See?

1032
01:18:57,957 --> 01:18:58,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Analyst Loki.

1033
01:19:00,268 --> 01:19:02,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Squelch and the Rumors right here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1034
01:19:03,951 --> 01:19:04,251
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1035
01:19:05,392 --> 01:19:11,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Just out of curiosity, though, if they did do a band-based game, a one-band game, is there any bands you'd want to see?

1036
01:19:11,596 --> 01:19:11,716
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1037
01:19:12,136 --> 01:19:12,276
[SPEAKER_11]: No?

1038
01:19:13,097 --> 01:19:13,217
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1039
01:19:13,437 --> 01:19:13,537
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1040
01:19:14,218 --> 01:19:17,440
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, any bands you think are deserving of their full rock band game?

1041
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:24,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Electric Light Orchestra Sorry, I've been on an ELO kick lately ABBA Rock Band, you think I'm kidding?

1042
01:19:25,092 --> 01:19:45,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Radiohead Rock Band I would be down with a Radiohead Rock Band actually but I just don't see Radiohead as the type of band that would want to be a part of that I would love to see I know they said on the Rock Band Network it could happen I would like to see some drum and bass tracks come out on Rock Band get some Pendulum in there something like that

1043
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:47,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that would be pretty cool.

1044
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:49,120
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like some guitar stuff in there.

1045
01:19:49,661 --> 01:19:53,482
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it'd be really difficult to do on drums, but it would be neat to see.

1046
01:19:55,263 --> 01:19:56,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room.

1047
01:19:56,684 --> 01:19:59,185
[SPEAKER_02]: He's getting a lot of comments tonight, but he's saying some good stuff.

1048
01:19:59,465 --> 01:20:01,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Wants to clarify the ACDC deal.

1049
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:02,146
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a track pack.

1050
01:20:02,787 --> 01:20:03,967
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't actually a separate game.

1051
01:20:04,007 --> 01:20:05,048
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't listed as a separate game.

1052
01:20:05,068 --> 01:20:05,708
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a track pack.

1053
01:20:05,970 --> 01:20:09,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but Bobby, technically you can play it by itself, therefore it is kind of a separate game.

1054
01:20:10,294 --> 01:20:11,575
[SPEAKER_02]: I get what he's saying, though.

1055
01:20:11,635 --> 01:20:16,479
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the vein of those country packs and the things they sold individually.

1056
01:20:16,539 --> 01:20:19,382
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I thought of it as a separate game because could you buy the ACDC stuff?

1057
01:20:19,402 --> 01:20:21,123
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy it and play it by itself.

1058
01:20:23,225 --> 01:20:25,547
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't think you could buy it from within Rock Band.

1059
01:20:25,607 --> 01:20:27,069
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you can't buy it within Rock Band.

1060
01:20:27,109 --> 01:20:30,512
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy the track pack, play it by itself, or dump it into your game.

1061
01:20:30,792 --> 01:20:32,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Donovan's suggesting Village People Rock Band.

1062
01:20:34,186 --> 01:20:36,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Wolf again says, I'd like to see Rush or U2.

1063
01:20:38,389 --> 01:20:40,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny T-Man says, Golden Girls rock band.

1064
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:41,091
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1065
01:20:43,812 --> 01:20:47,314
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be the Betty White version of Thank You for Being a Friend from Saturday Night Live a couple weeks ago.

1066
01:20:48,395 --> 01:20:49,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, let's get into it.

1067
01:20:49,436 --> 01:20:50,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of old classics.

1068
01:20:51,657 --> 01:20:53,618
[SPEAKER_02]: When doesn't the Golden Girls seem to come up on this show lately?

1069
01:20:54,079 --> 01:20:54,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Old classics.

1070
01:20:54,839 --> 01:20:56,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I want to be Betty White when I grow up.

1071
01:20:57,201 --> 01:21:00,663
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura likes to dig through the gaming vault and find a game that she says, Hey!

1072
01:21:01,465 --> 01:21:03,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, listen.

1073
01:21:03,225 --> 01:21:04,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, listen.

1074
01:21:04,966 --> 01:21:07,867
[SPEAKER_02]: You kids ought to be playing this game.

1075
01:21:08,347 --> 01:21:09,987
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the classic video game of the week.

1076
01:21:10,247 --> 01:21:14,588
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, though, this week she's managed to pick a game that most people have played.

1077
01:21:14,848 --> 01:21:17,669
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you haven't, what the hell?

1078
01:21:18,129 --> 01:21:19,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, where the hell have you been?

1079
01:21:20,089 --> 01:21:21,630
[SPEAKER_04]: What planet have you been hanging out on?

1080
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:22,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get to it.

1081
01:21:22,330 --> 01:21:24,270
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1082
01:21:24,331 --> 01:21:25,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Mario 64.

1083
01:21:28,484 --> 01:21:29,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Mario 64!

1084
01:21:30,306 --> 01:21:38,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this... I have to say, this is one of my favorite ever Nintendo 64 games.

1085
01:21:38,332 --> 01:21:39,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably one of my favorite.

1086
01:21:39,673 --> 01:21:41,595
[SPEAKER_05]: It's up there in my list of favorites.

1087
01:21:43,696 --> 01:21:53,284
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, you know, the first real dive into 3D for Mario, and it was one of those games that that controller just seemed to be made for.

1088
01:21:53,324 --> 01:21:54,065
[SPEAKER_05]: But I love the music.

1089
01:21:54,806 --> 01:21:55,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you turn up Rob for a minute?

1090
01:21:56,327 --> 01:21:56,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1091
01:22:03,286 --> 01:22:32,886
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the early level I also love that you can go up to a sleeping piranha plant and punch him in the face cause look he's about to do it here too but that was like there were just so many little fun things you know you could do the wall jump you could also glitch the game hardcore and just beat it right from the very get go if you were really good at the wall jump see he punched the piranha plant in the face shoot it in the face in the face Mario's hardcore like that he's a thug um

1092
01:22:34,993 --> 01:22:45,824
[SPEAKER_05]: At any rate, the game starts off at Princess Peach's castle and she writes him a letter and says, I baked you a cake, even though I'm a princess and have servants to do it for me.

1093
01:22:47,266 --> 01:22:50,249
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was also the first game in the US that we got her name as being Peach.

1094
01:22:50,589 --> 01:22:52,351
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think about it, though, she is a princess.

1095
01:22:52,391 --> 01:22:55,173
[SPEAKER_03]: She could take credit for what her servants did.

1096
01:22:57,255 --> 01:22:58,196
[SPEAKER_03]: I baked this for you.

1097
01:22:58,576 --> 01:23:01,519
[SPEAKER_03]: By me, I mean I own these servants that made it for you.

1098
01:23:01,539 --> 01:23:03,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say she was actually Peach in Mario 3.

1099
01:23:05,623 --> 01:23:08,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know Mario Kart was on Super Nintendo.

1100
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:09,206
[SPEAKER_02]: That was before this.

1101
01:23:09,546 --> 01:23:10,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure Mario 3 called her Peach.

1102
01:23:11,408 --> 01:23:13,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1103
01:23:31,662 --> 01:23:32,543
[SPEAKER_05]: levels in different means.

1104
01:23:32,963 --> 01:23:39,227
[SPEAKER_05]: That theme kept coming back in later 3D Mario games like in Sunshine and I think in Galaxy.

1105
01:23:40,068 --> 01:23:42,950
[SPEAKER_05]: You had different ways of beating the levels and that was pretty cool.

1106
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:44,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Fairly innovative.

1107
01:23:45,291 --> 01:23:53,277
[SPEAKER_05]: You could get different things like the metal cap where you turned into shiny chrome Mario and went bang, bang, bang, every time you ran.

1108
01:23:53,717 --> 01:23:57,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is always what I thought of knights in armor trying to run.

1109
01:23:58,840 --> 01:23:59,841
[SPEAKER_05]: You got a wing cap.

1110
01:24:00,281 --> 01:24:01,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you do that one more time?

1111
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:05,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you say that one more time?

1112
01:24:06,186 --> 01:24:06,827
[SPEAKER_05]: There, how's that?

1113
01:24:07,308 --> 01:24:07,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1114
01:24:08,509 --> 01:24:10,430
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can find a pink Bob-omb buddy.

1115
01:24:10,711 --> 01:24:11,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, he's pink.

1116
01:24:13,073 --> 01:24:19,839
[SPEAKER_05]: And there were... You also had coins that you used for your life.

1117
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:21,861
[SPEAKER_05]: And you could also...

1118
01:24:24,308 --> 01:24:25,289
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1119
01:24:40,844 --> 01:24:57,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so it was originally gonna be, um, a Super FX game for the SNES, but, um, it couldn't quite reach what he wanted to do, so basically he, I think, I think he pulled an avatar on this, dusted it off out of a drawer, decided, oh, technology's caught up, let's do it.

1120
01:24:58,318 --> 01:25:01,000
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, um, I love the sliding levels, too.

1121
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:02,341
[SPEAKER_05]: He just fell down a hole, though.

1122
01:25:04,373 --> 01:25:27,831
[SPEAKER_05]: and you can move the camera around and it does have a fairly set path you can go but you can just run around and do stuff and explore and even if you're like trying to beat a certain way if like if you're doing a certain mission that has you beat the level a certain way you can actually do it the other way you know if you just decide to do that but it's

1123
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:32,643
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really just, you know, pretty cool.

1124
01:25:32,663 --> 01:25:37,568
[SPEAKER_05]: And also the music in it was done by Koji Kondo, who is one of my personal heroes.

1125
01:25:38,530 --> 01:25:41,613
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was one of the first ones that had Charles Martinet to do the voice.

1126
01:25:42,915 --> 01:25:43,656
[SPEAKER_05]: He's so cool.

1127
01:25:44,016 --> 01:25:44,817
[SPEAKER_05]: He's so cool.

1128
01:25:46,039 --> 01:25:48,281
[SPEAKER_05]: He was cool to meet, you know.

1129
01:25:49,242 --> 01:25:54,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so yeah, it's, I think, in that list of one of, you know, best games ever.

1130
01:25:55,444 --> 01:25:58,425
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, dude, punching a piranha plant in the face.

1131
01:25:59,286 --> 01:26:04,988
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, grabbing Koop, you know, Bowser by the tail and swinging him around and throwing him off a building.

1132
01:26:05,768 --> 01:26:07,769
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Mario turned into a thug in this game.

1133
01:26:09,269 --> 01:26:13,131
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, if you want to see something incredibly fun, go on YouTube and just watch speedruns.

1134
01:26:13,911 --> 01:26:16,892
[SPEAKER_05]: But now, the, um...

1135
01:26:19,179 --> 01:26:34,253
[SPEAKER_05]: The really interesting thing with this game for me is that Dan and I, we spent, because he had a Nintendo 64, we didn't actually have nearly the collection that we do now.

1136
01:26:34,894 --> 01:26:40,739
[SPEAKER_05]: When we first moved in together, we had maybe about 20 video game systems then, maybe 15, something like that.

1137
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I moved out here with my Super Nintendo and stuff.

1138
01:26:45,281 --> 01:26:49,963
[SPEAKER_05]: But he had a Nintendo 64, and we just played the stew out of this game.

1139
01:26:50,883 --> 01:26:55,744
[SPEAKER_05]: And we played the Rumble Pak, and we had a lot of fun.

1140
01:26:55,824 --> 01:26:57,745
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just really, really cool.

1141
01:26:58,565 --> 01:27:12,781
[SPEAKER_05]: and I actually have the Nintendo DS one and it's actually a little harder to play but, you know, you play as Yoshi, Luigi and Wario and it looks a little bit better and it's got mini games and multiplayer mode and it's pretty good.

1142
01:27:14,003 --> 01:27:31,520
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a direct sequel planned for the Nintendo 64DD, and Miyamoto had started it in 97, and it was going to be released in 99, but because the 64DD didn't make it...

1143
01:27:34,192 --> 01:27:38,655
[SPEAKER_05]: My husband just decided to pop his head in the door and said that the movie he was watching was awesome.

1144
01:27:38,675 --> 01:27:39,496
[SPEAKER_02]: What movie were they watching?

1145
01:27:39,616 --> 01:27:40,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Kick-Ass.

1146
01:27:40,076 --> 01:27:40,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Kick-Ass.

1147
01:27:41,718 --> 01:27:42,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

1148
01:27:43,159 --> 01:27:57,869
[SPEAKER_05]: But because 64DD pretty much flopped, we basically got Super Mario Sunshine on GameCube, and then we got Super Mario Galaxy, and of course we're getting another Super Mario Galaxy.

1149
01:27:58,408 --> 01:28:00,049
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

1150
01:28:00,249 --> 01:28:03,210
[SPEAKER_05]: This game has a special place in my heart.

1151
01:28:04,491 --> 01:28:07,212
[SPEAKER_05]: That, and when you win the game, Peach makes you a cake.

1152
01:28:08,273 --> 01:28:09,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Like she promised.

1153
01:28:09,433 --> 01:28:09,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1154
01:28:10,154 --> 01:28:10,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for her.

1155
01:28:12,541 --> 01:28:12,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1156
01:28:13,842 --> 01:28:14,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there it is.

1157
01:28:15,023 --> 01:28:16,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Your classic game of the week.

1158
01:28:17,384 --> 01:28:18,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Mario 64.

1159
01:28:19,766 --> 01:28:21,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I want to give a quick counter opinion.

1160
01:28:21,927 --> 01:28:23,708
[SPEAKER_02]: This was not my favorite Mario game in the series.

1161
01:28:23,888 --> 01:28:26,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not like the transition to 3D very much.

1162
01:28:26,210 --> 01:28:29,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand a lot of people are all excited about it.

1163
01:28:29,572 --> 01:28:30,052
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

1164
01:28:30,392 --> 01:28:36,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a really hard time with this game after the awesomeness that were the Super Nintendo Mario games.

1165
01:28:36,536 --> 01:28:36,856
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1166
01:28:36,977 --> 01:28:38,698
[SPEAKER_02]: The switch to 3D never felt right for me.

1167
01:28:39,158 --> 01:28:40,099
[SPEAKER_02]: But oddly enough...

1168
01:28:41,079 --> 01:28:42,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I was okay with Mario Sunshine.

1169
01:28:44,105 --> 01:28:45,227
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that makes me weird.

1170
01:28:45,267 --> 01:28:47,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all sorts of weird, but whatever.

1171
01:28:49,113 --> 01:28:50,275
[SPEAKER_02]: You are weirdo, Rob.

1172
01:28:50,896 --> 01:28:51,357
[SPEAKER_02]: I am weird.

1173
01:28:51,397 --> 01:28:51,758
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine.

1174
01:28:51,838 --> 01:28:52,519
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine.

1175
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:53,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I deal with it.

1176
01:28:53,891 --> 01:28:57,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, anyhow, let's go ahead and take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1177
01:28:57,733 --> 01:29:00,074
[SPEAKER_02]: We got more gaming news we want to get to in Part B tonight.

1178
01:29:00,735 --> 01:29:01,515
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't gotten to yet.

1179
01:29:01,575 --> 01:29:05,697
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, you know, huge news about a free game that's available we're going to get to.

1180
01:29:05,857 --> 01:29:09,259
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sure everybody's already downloaded it, but if you haven't, we'll tell you more about it in a minute.

1181
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:11,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus movie news.

1182
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:12,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Movies turning into games.

1183
01:29:12,601 --> 01:29:13,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Games turning into movies.

1184
01:29:13,922 --> 01:29:14,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of news like that.

1185
01:29:15,343 --> 01:29:17,924
[SPEAKER_02]: And a little more Red Dead Redemption and Rapid Fire news.

1186
01:29:18,084 --> 01:29:23,027
[SPEAKER_02]: And your calls when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1187
01:29:23,837 --> 01:29:30,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday, May the 16th of 2010 where we are taping the 357th episode.

1188
01:29:30,284 --> 01:29:30,384
[SPEAKER_02]: No, 67th.

1189
01:29:33,766 --> 01:29:34,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I lost count.

1190
01:29:34,406 --> 01:29:35,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking about that earlier in the show.

1191
01:29:35,987 --> 01:29:45,154
[SPEAKER_02]: 367th episode of our show, as we do every week at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, live here on Sunday nights.

1192
01:29:45,334 --> 01:29:55,581
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about a lot of different news in Part A tonight, talking about EA's controversial new $10 thing, talking about used games at Walmart, and our gaming weeks were quite long tonight.

1193
01:29:55,621 --> 01:29:56,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's doing something.

1194
01:29:56,581 --> 01:30:02,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Sakura went to Pinnagogo when I was playing 3D.GameHeroes, and Loki's still playing Grand Theft Auto.

1195
01:30:02,365 --> 01:30:02,845
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

1196
01:30:02,885 --> 01:30:03,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

1197
01:30:04,488 --> 01:30:09,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Loki, he's going to start off with some quick news topics before we get back into some longer discussion.

1198
01:30:09,201 --> 01:30:10,725
[SPEAKER_02]: So quick, quick, what's on your mind tonight, Loki?

1199
01:30:12,144 --> 01:30:16,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, apparently there's another dance game coming to the Wii.

1200
01:30:17,588 --> 01:30:25,594
[SPEAKER_03]: And funny enough, this actually has a tie back into one of the shows that I wasn't a part of, but Rob had hosted a while back.

1201
01:30:26,174 --> 01:30:28,916
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's Kids Bop Dance Party the Video Game.

1202
01:30:28,976 --> 01:30:33,360
[SPEAKER_03]: You might ask, how did that even, you know... How the fuck did that come up on OLR?

1203
01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:34,160
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even remember that.

1204
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:35,221
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't on OLR.

1205
01:30:35,261 --> 01:30:36,122
[SPEAKER_03]: It was on Vanilla Sky.

1206
01:30:36,142 --> 01:30:36,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I wanted to spin on that.

1207
01:30:37,503 --> 01:30:40,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a genius, I invented that game all by myself

1208
01:31:28,488 --> 01:31:29,850
[SPEAKER_03]: They came up inadvertently.

1209
01:31:29,950 --> 01:31:30,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoops.

1210
01:31:30,351 --> 01:31:34,797
[SPEAKER_03]: The Benny Hill theme, unfortunately not part of the Kidz Bop dance party video game.

1211
01:31:34,898 --> 01:31:35,498
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's funny?

1212
01:31:35,579 --> 01:31:36,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Total mistake.

1213
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:38,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't intend for that music to play, but somehow fitting.

1214
01:31:39,944 --> 01:32:01,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, such songs in this will be of course Lady Gaga's Paparazzi, Michael Jackson's Thriller, Pink's Get the Party Started, and yeah, it's going to include a free play challenge, dance off, shop and dress up modes, and it will feature two players that can dance cooperatively, or go head to head.

1215
01:32:02,930 --> 01:32:05,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Lame, but not really my target demographic.

1216
01:32:05,472 --> 01:32:10,277
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, Just Dance sold a million copies, so what do I know about games, I guess?

1217
01:32:10,577 --> 01:32:11,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently nothing.

1218
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:17,924
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are a collector of such odd game peripherals as...

1219
01:32:19,205 --> 01:32:25,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, the chainsaw controller for Resident Evil, or I guess in this case, Dragon Quest.

1220
01:32:25,688 --> 01:32:30,970
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be getting its own Dragon Quest Monsters Battle Road Victory.

1221
01:32:33,031 --> 01:32:42,795
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Wii game that was a port of an arcade game that's based on collectible cards, but the actual controller, like the arcade, has two giant buttons and

1222
01:32:43,135 --> 01:32:48,681
[SPEAKER_03]: and a giant sword that looks like it's basically the sword in the stone that you have to interact with as well.

1223
01:32:49,021 --> 01:32:59,331
[SPEAKER_03]: The controller will cost the 12,800 yen the equivalent of $137 US and will be out in Japan this summer.

1224
01:32:59,732 --> 01:33:05,918
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're a big collector of odd peripherals this will be coming to you from Hori.

1225
01:33:07,459 --> 01:33:17,106
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, of course, we've been hearing about a lot of cameos of characters in Lost Planet 2, including Dom from Gears of War.

1226
01:33:18,087 --> 01:33:22,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now, of course, Sony's got to have their characters in there as well.

1227
01:33:22,530 --> 01:33:32,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really making it in for the launch, but there will be some free download content coming out soon that will include the Helghast characters from the Killzone series.

1228
01:33:33,217 --> 01:33:34,278
[SPEAKER_03]: The crew from Kidz Bop meets Gwar.

1229
01:33:34,298 --> 01:33:35,298
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be weird.

1230
01:34:00,895 --> 01:34:28,237
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't know like maybe it could be like a point and click type of game like in the vein of you know Sam and Max and those types of games where like the you play as the folks from GWAR and you're trying to find the people from Kidz Bop and like corrupt them and or murder them I will one up that okay I will one up that please we need to launch a new CD series called GWAR Bop that basically takes GWAR and has them sing all these different contemporary hits as they put it

1231
01:34:32,121 --> 01:34:32,661
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd play that.

1232
01:34:32,861 --> 01:34:33,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I would too.

1233
01:34:33,682 --> 01:34:34,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Good stuff.

1234
01:34:34,522 --> 01:34:34,823
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1235
01:34:35,083 --> 01:34:37,105
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll make it come full circle and put it out of the game.

1236
01:34:37,305 --> 01:34:37,625
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1237
01:34:37,685 --> 01:34:40,807
[SPEAKER_02]: So possibly coming to a PC near you.

1238
01:34:41,168 --> 01:34:41,448
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1239
01:34:41,828 --> 01:34:42,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

1240
01:34:42,309 --> 01:34:44,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about some other quick news.

1241
01:34:44,991 --> 01:34:45,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo 2.

1242
01:34:46,172 --> 01:34:48,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there were still some holdouts playing Halo 2 online.

1243
01:34:48,694 --> 01:34:52,517
[SPEAKER_02]: You might remember there were guys that were refusing to pull their net connection.

1244
01:34:53,197 --> 01:34:54,538
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's kind of weird is that...

1245
01:34:55,439 --> 01:35:00,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft, you would think, would have just put the banhammer down on them a long time ago.

1246
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:01,420
[SPEAKER_02]: But they kind of thought it was funny.

1247
01:35:01,540 --> 01:35:05,981
[SPEAKER_02]: And they let it go as long as they could hold out their connections and so forth.

1248
01:35:06,361 --> 01:35:10,062
[SPEAKER_02]: And the last man standing was ApacheN4Sir.

1249
01:35:10,942 --> 01:35:12,002
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the gamer tag.

1250
01:35:12,582 --> 01:35:14,703
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was finally removed.

1251
01:35:14,743 --> 01:35:15,863
[SPEAKER_02]: He says he was kicked off.

1252
01:35:15,943 --> 01:35:18,983
[SPEAKER_02]: But kicked off could mean that his Comcast connection sucks balls.

1253
01:35:19,283 --> 01:35:22,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's what's been happening to me on World of Warcraft these past couple weeks.

1254
01:35:22,924 --> 01:35:25,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Tech came to my house and everything, said he couldn't find anything wrong.

1255
01:35:25,506 --> 01:35:27,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, yeah, I guess I'm just fucking crazy, huh?

1256
01:35:27,988 --> 01:35:29,169
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just our crappy service.

1257
01:35:29,189 --> 01:35:29,629
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1258
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:30,810
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a feature.

1259
01:35:31,011 --> 01:35:32,211
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyhow, whatever.

1260
01:35:32,972 --> 01:35:41,038
[SPEAKER_02]: So he finally got booted, whether it was by Microsoft or his cable provider, who knows, but it was at 11 o'clock or just before 11 o'clock Pacific time, May 10th, 2010.

1261
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:47,644
[SPEAKER_02]: He was out of Halo 2, which means that's it for the original Xbox Live.

1262
01:35:47,664 --> 01:35:49,986
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the official last connection on Xbox Live.

1263
01:35:50,786 --> 01:36:01,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Rest in pieces Rest in pieces Rest in pieces Rest in pieces Rest in pieces Rest in pieces Rest in pieces Rest in pieces Rest in pieces Rest in pieces

1264
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:21,821
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called RetroVision.

1265
01:36:22,222 --> 01:36:25,984
[SPEAKER_02]: And you plug the car into the Nintendo, put your Game Boy game in there, and you're good to go.

1266
01:36:26,525 --> 01:36:28,326
[SPEAKER_02]: This is even more awesome.

1267
01:36:28,806 --> 01:36:32,749
[SPEAKER_02]: It has the expansion port on it too, so you can use your Game Boy printer.

1268
01:36:33,189 --> 01:36:34,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the Game Boy printer?

1269
01:36:34,650 --> 01:36:36,952
[SPEAKER_02]: What a worthless piece of shit that thing was, huh?

1270
01:36:36,972 --> 01:36:37,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

1271
01:36:38,833 --> 01:36:41,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't they have like a hidden DJ game in that though?

1272
01:36:42,535 --> 01:36:43,895
[SPEAKER_03]: The printer software?

1273
01:36:44,716 --> 01:36:45,656
[SPEAKER_03]: The what software?

1274
01:36:45,796 --> 01:36:48,057
[SPEAKER_03]: The printer software that came with the actual printer.

1275
01:36:48,137 --> 01:36:48,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it?

1276
01:36:48,698 --> 01:36:49,298
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

1277
01:36:49,578 --> 01:36:49,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1278
01:36:50,118 --> 01:36:52,319
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a little like game in there.

1279
01:36:53,580 --> 01:36:54,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

1280
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:54,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't own one.

1281
01:36:54,860 --> 01:36:55,601
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't pay for one.

1282
01:36:56,041 --> 01:36:56,241
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1283
01:36:56,841 --> 01:37:00,283
[SPEAKER_02]: I just remember seeing the features and I thought, gee, that was stupid.

1284
01:37:00,683 --> 01:37:02,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I print my own receipts on it?

1285
01:37:04,004 --> 01:37:04,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, that might be good.

1286
01:37:04,685 --> 01:37:04,965
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1287
01:37:06,071 --> 01:37:07,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Room updates.

1288
01:37:08,394 --> 01:37:09,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we have to start covering these too.

1289
01:37:09,695 --> 01:37:12,038
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Rock Band releases, Virtual Console releases.

1290
01:37:12,078 --> 01:37:13,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we have Game Room releases as well.

1291
01:37:14,381 --> 01:37:18,466
[SPEAKER_02]: This week you missed Battlezone, Canyon Bomber, Keystone Capers for the 2600.

1292
01:37:19,147 --> 01:37:21,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Canyon Bomber is also the 2600 version, not the arcade version.

1293
01:37:22,350 --> 01:37:23,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Megazone for the arcade.

1294
01:37:24,012 --> 01:37:28,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Night Driver for the Atari 2600, Oink for the 2600, and Soccer for the Intellivision.

1295
01:37:28,553 --> 01:37:34,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting thing about Game Room, the game packs that you're downloading are actually two weeks worth of games.

1296
01:37:34,355 --> 01:37:36,655
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that half of them stay locked for a week.

1297
01:37:37,135 --> 01:37:43,157
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you downloaded something that was in last week's pack, like Pitfall, you already had this week's pack waiting to go.

1298
01:37:45,838 --> 01:37:53,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Pack 1 and 2 are like 15 games apiece, so Game Pack 3 rolls around and it's another 50 megabytes.

1299
01:37:53,402 --> 01:37:54,563
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually 15 more games.

1300
01:37:54,863 --> 01:37:55,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Go figure.

1301
01:37:55,783 --> 01:38:04,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, some of the games have been announced for the next pack that is coming out, and that is going to be coming out on May 19th, because it looks like, what, is that Wednesday is going to be Game Room Day?

1302
01:38:05,128 --> 01:38:06,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Asteroids for the arcade.

1303
01:38:06,889 --> 01:38:09,711
[SPEAKER_02]: We already have Asteroids Deluxe, but you get original Asteroids this time.

1304
01:38:10,211 --> 01:38:39,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Demons to Diamonds was a 2600 game that's coming out this week as well Grand Prix from Activision Shark Shark Space Duel it was an arcade game it was kind of like a souped up Asteroids I guess you could say probably I think the biggest release this week Stampede is coming out this week on the 2600 oh I have fond memories of Stampede when we went to the Classic Gaming Expo I participated in like the official Stampede scoreboard that Twin Galaxies was doing I think I got like next to last place I'm that good at Stampede

1305
01:38:40,291 --> 01:38:56,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Time Pilot is also coming out May 19th but Time Pilot's already available on Xbox Live just so you know for five bucks and you get the souped up version so if you want to buy Time Pilot for Game Room that's on you but you'll get the opportunity this week to buy it all over again if you want.

1306
01:38:57,035 --> 01:38:57,815
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about money.

1307
01:38:58,015 --> 01:38:58,435
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1308
01:38:58,495 --> 01:38:59,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Money, money, money.

1309
01:38:59,955 --> 01:39:07,717
[SPEAKER_05]: And speaking of all about money how about our Rock Band releases for the week as

1310
01:39:09,981 --> 01:39:11,142
[SPEAKER_05]: What is wrong with my computer?

1311
01:39:13,162 --> 01:39:13,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, where do I begin?

1312
01:39:14,283 --> 01:39:14,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

1313
01:39:15,043 --> 01:39:16,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, seriously.

1314
01:39:16,164 --> 01:39:17,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it freeze up or something?

1315
01:39:17,184 --> 01:39:20,585
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's opening 50,000 windows when I'm trying to... Yikes.

1316
01:39:21,446 --> 01:39:22,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Spam, spam, spam.

1317
01:39:22,866 --> 01:39:23,166
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1318
01:39:23,607 --> 01:39:24,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Lose weight.

1319
01:39:24,187 --> 01:39:25,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Increase your penis size.

1320
01:39:25,527 --> 01:39:26,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Et cetera, et cetera.

1321
01:39:26,748 --> 01:39:27,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

1322
01:39:28,028 --> 01:39:28,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1323
01:39:28,809 --> 01:39:31,630
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because it's completely screwing up now, so... All right, that's fine.

1324
01:39:31,670 --> 01:39:32,730
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go to some chat room comments.

1325
01:39:32,790 --> 01:39:37,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat.OrangeSoundsRadio.com Salacious Pop says, Demons and Diamonds was a paddle game, though.

1326
01:39:37,572 --> 01:39:39,113
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a big twisty knob.

1327
01:39:39,833 --> 01:39:42,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Paddle and trackball for Game Room, please.

1328
01:39:42,595 --> 01:39:49,801
[SPEAKER_02]: I somewhat agree, although I don't think at the end of the day I would be able to justify buying a trackball for my Xbox because I know it would cost like $30 to $40.

1329
01:39:50,462 --> 01:39:51,483
[SPEAKER_02]: And what am I going to play with it?

1330
01:39:52,163 --> 01:39:53,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Crystal Castles.

1331
01:39:53,685 --> 01:39:54,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo!

1332
01:39:55,426 --> 01:39:55,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1333
01:39:56,847 --> 01:39:59,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, you know, in theory, they do need to have better support for that stuff.

1334
01:39:59,689 --> 01:40:01,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody could probably hack that together.

1335
01:40:01,211 --> 01:40:07,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Playing Crystal Castles on the joystick or the little Xbox 360 controller just stinks.

1336
01:40:08,257 --> 01:40:08,657
[SPEAKER_02]: It stinks.

1337
01:40:09,232 --> 01:40:12,074
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so we have... I've got everything pulled up now.

1338
01:40:12,694 --> 01:40:14,095
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to basically reload it all.

1339
01:40:15,116 --> 01:40:18,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Our rock band download content actually is pretty cool.

1340
01:40:18,619 --> 01:40:27,325
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a Grateful Dead pack, which includes Beat It On Down The Line, Cumberland Blues, Scarlet Begonias, Throwing Stones, Touch Of Grey, and U.S.

1341
01:40:27,405 --> 01:40:27,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Blues.

1342
01:40:27,905 --> 01:40:29,426
[SPEAKER_05]: And then two songs by The Smithereens.

1343
01:40:29,826 --> 01:40:30,887
[SPEAKER_05]: I like The Smithereens.

1344
01:40:30,947 --> 01:40:32,989
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of my groups I really liked when I was in high school.

1345
01:40:33,649 --> 01:40:35,830
[SPEAKER_05]: It's A Girl Like You and Only A Memory.

1346
01:40:36,711 --> 01:40:37,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are both really good songs.

1347
01:40:40,372 --> 01:40:46,055
[SPEAKER_05]: For some Project Natal news, their big event is going to have a Cirque du Soleil performance.

1348
01:40:47,637 --> 01:40:49,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, Cirque du Soleil.

1349
01:40:50,098 --> 01:40:56,583
[SPEAKER_05]: But it'll be on June 13th, so look forward to feats of flexibility.

1350
01:40:56,883 --> 01:40:58,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Or as my friend calls it, Cirque du Sogay.

1351
01:40:59,525 --> 01:41:00,065
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, right?

1352
01:41:01,746 --> 01:41:02,106
[SPEAKER_05]: And then...

1353
01:41:03,922 --> 01:41:04,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Bayonetta!

1354
01:41:05,363 --> 01:41:11,668
[SPEAKER_05]: The director, Kamiya Hideki, he basically doesn't like that there's Bayonetta doujinshi.

1355
01:41:12,408 --> 01:41:19,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, hentai doujinshi about Bayonetta getting it on.

1356
01:41:19,994 --> 01:41:21,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, she's kind of sexy.

1357
01:41:21,895 --> 01:41:24,637
[SPEAKER_05]: That means that you've got a popular product, hi.

1358
01:41:25,298 --> 01:41:33,004
[SPEAKER_02]: The more, you know, I have personally... Sega should be fucking excited that they have like a new franchise here, you know what I mean?

1359
01:41:34,935 --> 01:41:35,335
[SPEAKER_05]: He, he, he

1360
01:41:50,535 --> 01:42:02,884
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems there's pornographic doujinshi based off Bayonetta.

1361
01:42:02,944 --> 01:42:08,168
[SPEAKER_05]: There are fans who will resent that, and I hardly think those responsible hold any love for the game.

1362
01:42:08,648 --> 01:42:10,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, get your head out your butt, dude.

1363
01:42:11,330 --> 01:42:16,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, there was though, um, Chris, is it Dallin or Dalen?

1364
01:42:17,111 --> 01:42:18,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, there's a quote from him and I actually like this.

1365
01:42:19,532 --> 01:42:27,454
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is actually a point that I've had with, you know, some of these games that guys can go and get outfits for their female characters.

1366
01:42:27,774 --> 01:42:35,016
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I always laughed that WrestleMania was like dress up for, for boys, you know, cause they could customize their wrestler and, you know, um,

1367
01:42:36,056 --> 01:43:00,556
[SPEAKER_05]: but the quote is saying guys tell themselves they shouldn't listen to fashion they're terrified if they spend enough time playing as Bayonetta being Bayonetta and witnessing the power of her high heels and endless tresses well at some point they'll stop objectifying her they'll want to be her she won't invite our gaze as much as grip it until she sucked us into a vortex of overpowering femininity I like that a vortex of overpowering femininity that should be on the box

1368
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:07,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we get an iTunes review for our show that says that?

1369
01:43:10,362 --> 01:43:11,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Boo power!

1370
01:43:12,523 --> 01:43:14,824
[SPEAKER_02]: A vortex of overpowering femininity.

1371
01:43:14,864 --> 01:43:16,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what they're calling her bits now?

1372
01:43:17,986 --> 01:43:18,886
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a vortex.

1373
01:43:19,847 --> 01:43:21,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, some other gaming news.

1374
01:43:21,988 --> 01:43:26,090
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course we'll get to the Skype line, the mailbag, and all that fun stuff in just a little bit.

1375
01:43:26,550 --> 01:43:29,532
[SPEAKER_02]: But some other news stories first, starting off with Loki.

1376
01:43:30,312 --> 01:43:30,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1377
01:43:31,673 --> 01:43:34,134
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like every week we hear about another...

1378
01:43:35,154 --> 01:43:42,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Game franchise being turned into a movie and each one was perceived with more of an eye roll than the next.

1379
01:43:43,278 --> 01:43:44,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this shouldn't be a surprise.

1380
01:43:45,159 --> 01:43:49,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Rollercoaster Tycoon is now becoming a movie thanks to Sony Pictures.

1381
01:43:51,082 --> 01:43:51,262
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1382
01:43:52,574 --> 01:43:53,395
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that even work?

1383
01:43:54,316 --> 01:43:58,419
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going to be a movie about people liking theme parks and building theme parks.

1384
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:07,207
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be some stupid plot like, you know, roller coaster park A versus B, like some scandal.

1385
01:44:08,287 --> 01:44:12,191
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to be like Wall Street, but cute and about theme parks.

1386
01:44:14,273 --> 01:44:14,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

1387
01:44:15,374 --> 01:44:16,154
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be awful.

1388
01:44:17,195 --> 01:44:17,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Awful.

1389
01:44:18,817 --> 01:44:19,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1390
01:44:19,972 --> 01:44:22,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Would anybody really want to watch Roller Coaster Tycoon?

1391
01:44:22,833 --> 01:44:23,213
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1392
01:44:23,673 --> 01:44:29,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's being developed as a live-action CGI hybrid at Sony Pictures Animation.

1393
01:44:29,814 --> 01:44:30,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

1394
01:44:30,874 --> 01:44:32,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to be in 3D?

1395
01:44:33,074 --> 01:44:33,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, probably.

1396
01:44:36,375 --> 01:44:44,776
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess it's being worked on by Harold Zwart, the director of the upcoming Karate Kid remake.

1397
01:44:45,837 --> 01:44:47,897
[SPEAKER_03]: He will be taking an executive producer role.

1398
01:44:49,727 --> 01:44:55,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, before we get to more news, I completely forgot to do a segment that we usually do on the show.

1399
01:44:56,152 --> 01:44:56,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter topics.

1400
01:44:58,314 --> 01:44:58,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.

1401
01:44:59,015 --> 01:44:59,675
[SPEAKER_02]: We should do those now.

1402
01:44:59,735 --> 01:45:00,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter topics!

1403
01:45:01,276 --> 01:45:09,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Every week you send us your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR and we read some of our favorite tweets live on air here.

1404
01:45:10,344 --> 01:45:11,465
[SPEAKER_02]: If I remember to do them.

1405
01:45:13,171 --> 01:45:13,772
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1406
01:45:36,950 --> 01:45:38,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess these guys got injured.

1407
01:45:39,631 --> 01:45:46,994
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, and he was playing against a few friends, and his mother asked him to get his daughter's PJs.

1408
01:45:48,355 --> 01:45:50,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, so your mother had to tell you to get your daughter's PJs?

1409
01:45:50,876 --> 01:45:51,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh boy.

1410
01:45:51,816 --> 01:46:03,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so he didn't realize that the Xbox Live headset was wrapped around his chair's arm, so when he got up quickly, bam, the wire got caught and the head smashed right into my Mac, which was sitting on a stereo a few feet off the ground.

1411
01:46:03,821 --> 01:46:03,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Ow!

1412
01:46:04,281 --> 01:46:04,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Ow!

1413
01:46:06,238 --> 01:46:09,180
[SPEAKER_02]: So he got up quickly and bam, hit his head.

1414
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:10,880
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks hurtful.

1415
01:46:12,641 --> 01:46:16,924
[SPEAKER_02]: So he went to the hospital and thanks to... I love this.

1416
01:46:17,184 --> 01:46:22,827
[SPEAKER_02]: But a few hours later he was online fragging again thanks to a real life painkiller perk prescribed by the doctor.

1417
01:46:25,666 --> 01:46:26,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, BikeItIn!

1418
01:46:27,747 --> 01:46:29,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, there you go.

1419
01:46:29,107 --> 01:46:33,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, TigerClaw305 on Twitter for sending us that link.

1420
01:46:33,909 --> 01:46:36,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Tweets from BlueSwim here.

1421
01:46:36,689 --> 01:46:44,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter question, what franchise that hasn't had a game yet during the current generation would you like to see get a modern game?

1422
01:46:46,552 --> 01:46:51,634
[SPEAKER_02]: What game that hasn't gotten a modern game yet during this generation would you like to see get a game?

1423
01:46:51,974 --> 01:46:54,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's always the good old standby, the Guardian Legend.

1424
01:46:54,535 --> 01:46:55,055
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, hello.

1425
01:46:56,236 --> 01:46:56,957
[SPEAKER_02]: or Kid Icarus.

1426
01:46:57,078 --> 01:46:59,601
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always a lot of people clamoring to get a new Kid Icarus game.

1427
01:46:59,621 --> 01:47:00,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a new Fantasy Zone.

1428
01:47:01,163 --> 01:47:02,045
[SPEAKER_02]: A new Fantasy Zone?

1429
01:47:02,325 --> 01:47:02,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1430
01:47:02,766 --> 01:47:03,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's fair.

1431
01:47:03,927 --> 01:47:05,249
[SPEAKER_04]: The Adventures of Opa Opa!

1432
01:47:05,369 --> 01:47:06,270
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Afterburner.

1433
01:47:06,411 --> 01:47:09,575
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like a new Afterburner with a climb and a lot of the old stuff is new again.

1434
01:47:10,556 --> 01:47:12,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe for them to finally release Planet Harrier?

1435
01:47:13,913 --> 01:47:16,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my number one answer though, in all honesty, Blue Swim.

1436
01:47:16,897 --> 01:47:20,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if you want to go just to the last generation of something we haven't seen yet.

1437
01:47:21,461 --> 01:47:22,763
[SPEAKER_02]: F-Zero.

1438
01:47:23,363 --> 01:47:23,984
[SPEAKER_02]: K-Thanks.

1439
01:47:24,264 --> 01:47:26,467
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one game I really would like to see a new one of.

1440
01:47:26,847 --> 01:47:33,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Except, unfortunately, I think if I really want to like a new F-Zero game, it's going to have to be on the Xbox or the PlayStation 3.

1441
01:47:33,254 --> 01:47:33,474
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh...

1442
01:47:35,516 --> 01:47:36,538
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not going to happen.

1443
01:47:36,618 --> 01:47:38,302
[SPEAKER_03]: They already tried it there and it sucked.

1444
01:47:38,662 --> 01:47:39,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they?

1445
01:47:39,484 --> 01:47:41,949
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember it was at a game from Koei?

1446
01:47:42,870 --> 01:47:43,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Wipeout.

1447
01:47:43,712 --> 01:47:44,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Wipeout HD is kind of fun.

1448
01:47:45,055 --> 01:47:45,355
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.

1449
01:47:47,249 --> 01:48:15,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Sagan our chatroom says Star Fox that's a good one too but it has to be actual Star Fox not the adventures or what the hell was that on the gate what the hell what the hell fuck adventures yeah star fucking adventures all right let's see also blue swim wants to give an FYI hey did you know that Amazon is giving a $20 gaming credit on your next order when you buy Super Mario Galaxy 2 from them no I did not know that but I probably won't be buying Mario Galaxy 2 my Wii isn't even hooked up right now

1450
01:48:16,619 --> 01:48:19,544
[SPEAKER_02]: is not going to get hooked up again until Metroid Other M comes out.

1451
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:20,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you right now.

1452
01:48:20,746 --> 01:48:25,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless Mario Galaxy 2, like I play it at someone else's house and I'm like, oh my god, I'm missing out.

1453
01:48:25,775 --> 01:48:27,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, oh my god.

1454
01:48:27,847 --> 01:48:35,571
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's just so many other games coming out right now between Blur and Split Second and all these other racing games that I'm just like, you know what?

1455
01:48:36,191 --> 01:48:36,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1456
01:48:37,532 --> 01:48:41,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Rababa's in chat and suggests The Adventures of Lolo.

1457
01:48:41,134 --> 01:48:42,134
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, I'm serious.

1458
01:48:42,174 --> 01:48:47,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Lolo was actually a pretty freaking rad NES game that never really got a new version.

1459
01:48:47,617 --> 01:48:51,521
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what else was on the old school NES that I don't remember ever seeing later?

1460
01:48:52,922 --> 01:48:55,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet Jamie would know more about this, but she left the room real quick.

1461
01:48:55,425 --> 01:48:56,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Mylon Secret Castle.

1462
01:48:56,906 --> 01:48:57,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that game?

1463
01:48:58,067 --> 01:48:58,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

1464
01:48:59,549 --> 01:49:00,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they ever do a sequel?

1465
01:49:00,410 --> 01:49:01,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they did do one sequel.

1466
01:49:01,711 --> 01:49:02,091
[SPEAKER_02]: A little one.

1467
01:49:03,272 --> 01:49:09,436
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTest Studio wants to plug the latest retro rear view all about the X68000.

1468
01:49:09,857 --> 01:49:11,738
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on our website at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1469
01:49:11,758 --> 01:49:12,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out.

1470
01:49:12,218 --> 01:49:13,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Retro rear view.

1471
01:49:13,239 --> 01:49:14,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Actual content on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1472
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:16,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw an actual game review on there, too.

1473
01:49:16,901 --> 01:49:17,382
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

1474
01:49:17,462 --> 01:49:18,302
[SPEAKER_03]: What's this about?

1475
01:49:18,322 --> 01:49:20,244
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, wait, this is in our site?

1476
01:49:20,264 --> 01:49:22,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Our community is awesome.

1477
01:49:22,325 --> 01:49:23,466
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have to do anything.

1478
01:49:23,566 --> 01:49:23,866
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1479
01:49:24,526 --> 01:49:28,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd put reviews on there, but by the time I get around to putting a review up there, it's too late.

1480
01:49:28,429 --> 01:49:28,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shit.

1481
01:49:29,150 --> 01:49:30,150
[SPEAKER_02]: X-Link in chat room.

1482
01:49:30,490 --> 01:49:31,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent choice.

1483
01:49:31,271 --> 01:49:32,051
[SPEAKER_02]: StarTropics 3.

1484
01:49:33,613 --> 01:49:34,133
[SPEAKER_02]: EASP is a service

1485
01:49:55,373 --> 01:50:11,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, sure, why don't I link, uh, read this one, TigerClaw305 sends us another, uh, uh, Twitter topic, uh, it's a link from MTV Multiplayer blog, apparently, uh, Cliffy B, uh, has said that...

1486
01:50:12,563 --> 01:50:14,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Mass Effect, let me read this quote here.

1487
01:50:14,763 --> 01:50:19,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Quote, the thing that was cool was that Mass Effect is kind of an RPG for me with the cover-based shooting.

1488
01:50:19,864 --> 01:50:23,065
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a reason why it's been successful, because gamers love Gears.

1489
01:50:23,485 --> 01:50:23,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

1490
01:50:24,965 --> 01:50:26,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Just take your ego and shove it up your ass.

1491
01:50:27,186 --> 01:50:28,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's something like that.

1492
01:50:28,646 --> 01:50:34,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to thank myself and our series, Gears of War, for making Mass Effect 2 such a great game.

1493
01:50:34,767 --> 01:50:38,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if I hadn't put my game out, no one would know what first-person shooters are.

1494
01:50:38,208 --> 01:50:38,728
[SPEAKER_03]: And they wouldn't know...

1495
01:50:39,148 --> 01:51:03,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Epic first person shooters can be You know what, with all due respect I'm awesome I'm not going to read the rest of the story because I don't give a shit what he thinks Yes, I'm also awesome Thank you TigerClaw for trying I'll just tell you in a nutshell He says Mass Effect is the Star Wars for the new generation I'm the dang cook of the game programming industry You are like the episode 2 of this generation The Yoda fight was cool

1496
01:51:05,290 --> 01:51:07,191
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1497
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:26,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

1498
01:51:27,121 --> 01:51:33,804
[SPEAKER_02]: And last tweet I'm going to read here from Jay Jugo says, Scarezo in chat.

1499
01:51:33,844 --> 01:51:34,524
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I say it.

1500
01:51:34,624 --> 01:51:35,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Scarezo.

1501
01:51:36,265 --> 01:51:37,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have known that.

1502
01:51:37,306 --> 01:51:38,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, whatever.

1503
01:51:38,366 --> 01:51:40,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Scarezo, thanks you for mentioning the double down.

1504
01:51:41,027 --> 01:51:42,848
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my first live OLR show.

1505
01:51:43,248 --> 01:51:44,609
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, so epic.

1506
01:51:44,649 --> 01:51:48,871
[SPEAKER_02]: And also wants to send a quick thank you to Jamie for your pick for the classic game of the week.

1507
01:51:49,271 --> 01:51:50,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, you're quite welcome.

1508
01:51:50,152 --> 01:51:50,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Woot.

1509
01:51:52,964 --> 01:51:53,964
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember, whatever happened to that?

1510
01:52:21,357 --> 01:52:24,659
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out this fall, but it's actually not just coming out on the Wii this time.

1511
01:52:24,719 --> 01:52:28,161
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually going to be coming out on 360 and PlayStation 3 as well as the Wii.

1512
01:52:28,241 --> 01:52:28,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Well done.

1513
01:52:29,382 --> 01:52:30,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Please tell me it's a budget title.

1514
01:52:31,903 --> 01:52:32,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

1515
01:52:33,424 --> 01:52:34,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember that part.

1516
01:52:34,604 --> 01:52:35,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it still called Rock of the Dead?

1517
01:52:35,705 --> 01:52:36,786
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still called Rock of the Dead.

1518
01:52:36,966 --> 01:52:37,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

1519
01:52:38,976 --> 01:52:49,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, and I realize you guys are saying, like, you know, and I seem to remember when Rock of the Dead first came up on this show, a lot of people were saying, lawsuit, it's gonna be a lawsuit, but, like, seriously, after playing 3D.GameHeroes, it's a parody!

1520
01:52:50,626 --> 01:52:52,168
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all they have to say, it's a parody!

1521
01:52:53,709 --> 01:53:01,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Loki, when you play 3D.GameHeroes and DarkSakura, if you do at some point, you know, you really should check it out, because it'll tickle your retro funny bone.

1522
01:53:02,277 --> 01:53:02,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh...

1523
01:53:02,757 --> 01:53:05,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me it's not just a complete effing rip-off of Zelda.

1524
01:53:05,258 --> 01:53:06,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I could tell that without playing it.

1525
01:53:07,039 --> 01:53:07,839
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's okay.

1526
01:53:08,260 --> 01:53:08,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fine with that.

1527
01:53:09,020 --> 01:53:10,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Zelda's a good game.

1528
01:53:10,341 --> 01:53:12,221
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to be ripped off more often.

1529
01:53:14,082 --> 01:53:15,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, there was already Newtopia.

1530
01:53:16,380 --> 01:53:19,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, huge news this week.

1531
01:53:19,282 --> 01:53:23,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's been talking about this and we gotta say something about this too.

1532
01:53:23,265 --> 01:53:25,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Steam for the Mac came out this week.

1533
01:53:26,067 --> 01:53:30,129
[SPEAKER_02]: It included 57 games at launch, including Torchlight.

1534
01:53:30,269 --> 01:53:32,031
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually a game I played a little bit of this week.

1535
01:53:32,311 --> 01:53:33,211
[SPEAKER_02]: I like me some Torchlight.

1536
01:53:33,632 --> 01:53:38,035
[SPEAKER_02]: It was out there for $10 on Steam for the Mac, but the best deal of all...

1537
01:53:38,988 --> 01:53:39,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Free.

1538
01:53:40,129 --> 01:53:40,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Free game.

1539
01:53:41,010 --> 01:53:41,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Portal.

1540
01:53:41,731 --> 01:53:42,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Free.

1541
01:53:42,451 --> 01:53:43,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero dollars.

1542
01:53:44,273 --> 01:53:44,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Free.

1543
01:53:45,074 --> 01:53:45,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.

1544
01:53:46,255 --> 01:53:47,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Till May 24th.

1545
01:53:47,717 --> 01:53:54,924
[SPEAKER_02]: And they didn't want the Mac users to have all the fun there because if they only gave it away for free on the Mac, you'd have people like Loki that would be like, meh, meh, meh, meh.

1546
01:53:55,885 --> 01:53:56,846
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my Loki impression.

1547
01:53:56,906 --> 01:53:57,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Meh, meh, meh.

1548
01:53:59,068 --> 01:53:59,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I downloaded it.

1549
01:54:17,850 --> 01:54:20,172
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, she even bought the Pink Anus game.

1550
01:54:43,598 --> 01:54:44,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I did buy the Pink Anus game.

1551
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:46,421
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what?

1552
01:54:46,641 --> 01:54:47,281
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crap.

1553
01:54:49,263 --> 01:54:51,845
[SPEAKER_02]: But she bought it, and that's all they care about at the end of the day.

1554
01:54:52,546 --> 01:54:54,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1555
01:54:54,328 --> 01:54:56,310
[SPEAKER_05]: It's... Read ratings, please, people.

1556
01:54:56,710 --> 01:54:59,793
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, Can't get any cheaper than free unless you're Yaris.

1557
01:55:00,613 --> 01:55:00,874
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

1558
01:55:01,514 --> 01:55:06,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Seg in our chatroom says, They needed to demonstrate the Steam Play concept, so it's free on both platforms.

1559
01:55:06,499 --> 01:55:07,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

1560
01:55:07,059 --> 01:55:08,180
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of the Trojan horse.

1561
01:55:08,240 --> 01:55:09,642
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it...

1562
01:55:11,204 --> 01:55:12,746
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a win-win situation.

1563
01:55:12,966 --> 01:55:14,449
[SPEAKER_02]: You win because you get a free game.

1564
01:55:14,469 --> 01:55:20,017
[SPEAKER_02]: And to reference the other chat comment, you don't get some crappy free game.

1565
01:55:20,077 --> 01:55:24,905
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a great game of the year caliber game for free.

1566
01:55:25,766 --> 01:55:36,157
[SPEAKER_02]: but the trade-off is they win because they just installed your thing on your computer so you're not tempted to go get, you know, Direct to Drive or the Windows gaming platform which, granted, I know is not on the Mac but, you know, you know what I mean.

1567
01:55:36,918 --> 01:55:37,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing.

1568
01:55:37,379 --> 01:55:42,704
[SPEAKER_02]: They get that on your computer and then you're seeing all the sales and you're like, oh shit, I can get Torchlight for $10.

1569
01:55:43,365 --> 01:55:44,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I should get that.

1570
01:55:46,115 --> 01:55:46,715
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

1571
01:55:47,476 --> 01:55:48,536
[SPEAKER_02]: All of that's available on the Mac.

1572
01:55:48,576 --> 01:55:51,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the other games you might want to check out that are available on the Mac right now.

1573
01:55:51,377 --> 01:55:56,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Braid, let's see, is a big one.

1574
01:55:56,059 --> 01:55:57,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the Indiana Jones games.

1575
01:55:57,439 --> 01:55:58,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Loom, you can play on the Mac now.

1576
01:55:59,600 --> 01:55:59,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1577
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:07,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam & Max Devil's Playhouse, Tales of Monkey Island Season 1, Torchlight, which I definitely recommend.

1578
01:56:08,223 --> 01:56:12,265
[SPEAKER_02]: If you even just thought Diablo 2 was kind of cool, you should get Torchlight.

1579
01:56:13,125 --> 01:56:14,846
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because it's pretty much the same fucking game.

1580
01:56:16,066 --> 01:56:32,039
[SPEAKER_02]: and uh but better Civ 4 which of course you know I have a big boner for all things Civilization so I'm excited uh that the Mac fans can play that on Steam although I think that was I think Civ 4 was already available on the Mac I could be wrong all right more news mailbag coming up in a

1581
01:56:40,931 --> 01:56:44,534
[SPEAKER_05]: about the rating system in Australia.

1582
01:56:45,295 --> 01:57:01,349
[SPEAKER_05]: There is, and actually it's a fairly, I would have to say, a big percentage of proofs that there should be, 98% actually said that there should be an R18 plus rating, so where things are restricted to 18 and over.

1583
01:57:03,591 --> 01:57:07,755
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been proposed before, but now it's like, that's what the people want, so...

1584
01:57:10,074 --> 01:57:10,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

1585
01:57:10,614 --> 01:57:24,783
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's actually, though, some from other special interest groups, though, that were saying that only 53% actually approve of it.

1586
01:57:24,884 --> 01:57:26,985
[SPEAKER_05]: But, eh, numbers lie.

1587
01:57:29,309 --> 01:57:32,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Statistics can be budged.

1588
01:57:32,752 --> 01:57:41,681
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny you talk about statistics because some of the interesting chats, comments I'm reading right now about the whole Steam thing, they're a little delayed, so we get comments from the last story.

1589
01:57:42,442 --> 01:57:51,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Seg is saying, now we'll have stats for how many Mac users will buy games, or to clarify, publicly accessible stats for Mac users who will buy games.

1590
01:57:52,251 --> 01:57:52,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1591
01:57:53,572 --> 01:58:20,952
[SPEAKER_02]: uh some other comments Robert M says I've been anticipating Torchlight for quite some time but didn't want to invest in Windows 7 and partitioning for boot camp uh Donovan says he'll wait for Diablo 3 okay so yourself but I think Torchlight's uh pretty good the one thing Torchlight's missing is multiplayer but seriously it's like 10 bucks that's that's great it's a great deal for a single player game it really is anyhow uh all right so uh moving on with some more news stories Loki

1592
01:58:21,789 --> 01:58:36,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so it's interesting because there's already been screenshots of people, or not really screenshots, but people taking pictures of Red Dead Redemption because it's been coming in early to a few different stores.

1593
01:58:36,775 --> 01:58:46,719
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the screenshots, or I should say box shots that they got of the game on PlayStation 3 shows that there's some exclusive content included for the PlayStation 3 version.

1594
01:58:47,180 --> 01:58:47,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Now...

1595
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:48,580
[SPEAKER_03]: JonBoy!

1596
01:58:48,600 --> 01:58:48,801
[SPEAKER_03]: JonBoy!

1597
01:59:09,819 --> 01:59:11,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, this is exclusive for the PlayStation 3.

1598
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:25,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Not quite as wonderful as exclusive download content like that was on Grand Theft Auto episodes from Liberty City, but maybe this stuff will come out later on as something paid for on the Xbox 360.

1599
01:59:25,305 --> 01:59:28,986
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there is some more free download content coming out later on, so who knows.

1600
01:59:29,287 --> 01:59:31,367
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, anything extra is kind of good.

1601
01:59:31,487 --> 01:59:35,369
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're getting on the PS3, there's a little bonus for you.

1602
01:59:35,549 --> 01:59:35,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

1603
01:59:36,130 --> 01:59:39,613
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be enough to sway some people, even if it's like a little thing.

1604
01:59:39,693 --> 01:59:40,373
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.

1605
01:59:40,574 --> 01:59:41,434
[SPEAKER_02]: People that have both.

1606
01:59:42,696 --> 01:59:43,997
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that big a deal.

1607
01:59:44,337 --> 01:59:50,923
[SPEAKER_03]: There's tons of outfits you can get in the game and lots of different things you can find, safe houses and stuff.

1608
01:59:50,963 --> 01:59:56,748
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know if this stuff is really going to do it for you, but whatever.

1609
01:59:57,329 --> 02:00:00,952
[SPEAKER_03]: If you really want to get into both systems, you're not sure which one, maybe that'll sway you.

1610
02:00:02,714 --> 02:00:04,215
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, some other news coming out this week.

1611
02:00:04,255 --> 02:00:06,256
[SPEAKER_02]: How many of y'all have seen the movie Cube?

1612
02:00:06,276 --> 02:00:07,737
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little indie film.

1613
02:00:07,757 --> 02:00:09,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Cube 2.

1614
02:00:11,278 --> 02:00:12,279
[SPEAKER_02]: But not the original Cube.

1615
02:00:12,359 --> 02:00:18,822
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I like the first one, but the second one... Okay, just to go say a little bit about it.

1616
02:00:19,263 --> 02:00:22,584
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an indie film, and describe what Cube is about.

1617
02:00:22,604 --> 02:00:23,685
[SPEAKER_02]: But you've got to start with the first one.

1618
02:00:24,025 --> 02:00:25,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1619
02:00:40,940 --> 02:00:55,136
[SPEAKER_05]: and so as it goes they they each run into each other as they go through the cube and find out that each of them has a specific skill some people have been left with their glasses some people have been left with you know something in their pocket there's a crazy lady um

1620
02:00:55,877 --> 02:00:57,139
[SPEAKER_02]: And her skill is being crazy.

1621
02:00:57,499 --> 02:00:58,461
[SPEAKER_02]: No, she was the doctor, right?

1622
02:00:58,801 --> 02:00:59,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the doctor.

1623
02:00:59,903 --> 02:01:07,693
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's that these people are stuck in the cube.

1624
02:01:08,273 --> 02:01:10,056
[SPEAKER_05]: And their whole point is trying to figure out the way out.

1625
02:01:10,196 --> 02:01:13,380
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically, while they're moving from room to room...

1626
02:01:14,421 --> 02:01:18,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, they didn't have... Cube 2 was the one with Crazy Lady.

1627
02:01:18,427 --> 02:01:19,769
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one had the autistic boy.

1628
02:01:19,989 --> 02:01:20,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1629
02:01:22,453 --> 02:01:25,877
[SPEAKER_05]: They basically find out that the rooms are moving.

1630
02:01:27,179 --> 02:01:27,840
[SPEAKER_02]: OMG, spoiler.

1631
02:01:28,261 --> 02:01:28,641
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

1632
02:01:30,183 --> 02:01:32,284
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like over 10 years old at this point.

1633
02:01:32,364 --> 02:01:44,208
[SPEAKER_05]: And that basically the autistic boy is some sort of savant with numbers and figures out that it's like prime numbers go into the right room and they figure out which way the rooms are going to be that lead to the exit.

1634
02:01:44,388 --> 02:01:44,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1635
02:01:44,628 --> 02:01:45,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Where the exit is.

1636
02:01:45,328 --> 02:01:51,430
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's all... And now Cube 2, I love it because it's called Hypercube, meaning a tesseract.

1637
02:01:51,550 --> 02:01:53,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, it's not Electric Boogaloo?

1638
02:01:53,763 --> 02:01:53,963
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1639
02:01:53,983 --> 02:01:59,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I like that one because I love theoretical physics.

1640
02:02:01,153 --> 02:02:02,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have the brain for math or anything.

1641
02:02:02,454 --> 02:02:03,395
[SPEAKER_05]: I just love reading about it.

1642
02:02:03,656 --> 02:02:05,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, so the cube was like traveling through time and space as well?

1643
02:02:06,299 --> 02:02:06,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1644
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:07,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1645
02:02:07,140 --> 02:02:08,542
[SPEAKER_05]: The fourth dimension being time.

1646
02:02:08,922 --> 02:02:09,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1647
02:02:09,523 --> 02:02:18,868
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and it had like this really weird ending, and also the Cube 2 inspired a whole mod for Half-Life.

1648
02:02:19,489 --> 02:02:21,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't there a Cube 0 at some point too, or a Cube 3?

1649
02:02:21,810 --> 02:02:24,972
[SPEAKER_05]: The third one was Cube 0, which was like a prequel, and it was crap.

1650
02:02:25,332 --> 02:02:25,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1651
02:02:26,072 --> 02:02:28,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how would you like to play a video game based off Cube?

1652
02:02:29,395 --> 02:02:30,036
[SPEAKER_02]: She's raising her hand.

1653
02:02:30,396 --> 02:02:32,458
[SPEAKER_02]: It might actually happen, believe it or not.

1654
02:02:32,578 --> 02:02:37,963
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an interview that Vincenzo is his name, Vincenzo Natale.

1655
02:02:38,464 --> 02:02:44,049
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the director of the game, and he was talking to MTV about the film Splice, which is an upcoming movie that he did.

1656
02:02:44,930 --> 02:02:48,613
[SPEAKER_02]: They, for whatever reason, asked him about Cube if he ever wanted to revisit the universe.

1657
02:02:48,933 --> 02:02:51,756
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, I would very much like to do a Cube game.

1658
02:02:52,176 --> 02:02:53,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to do a game.

1659
02:02:53,397 --> 02:02:58,582
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was writing it with my writing partner, we were saying to each other, are we writing a film or are we writing a game?

1660
02:02:58,942 --> 02:03:01,965
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always been amazing to me that no one has attempted to turn it into a game.

1661
02:03:02,085 --> 02:03:03,246
[SPEAKER_02]: I would very much like to do that.

1662
02:03:03,787 --> 02:03:05,548
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I would like to get back into the Cube world.

1663
02:03:05,588 --> 02:03:06,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's true because there was the mod, right?

1664
02:03:06,989 --> 02:03:07,490
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm saying.

1665
02:03:07,510 --> 02:03:08,791
[SPEAKER_05]: There was the mod based on Hypercube.

1666
02:03:08,891 --> 02:03:10,072
[SPEAKER_02]: He probably hasn't seen it.

1667
02:03:11,061 --> 02:03:14,523
[SPEAKER_05]: And someone actually recreated the end of the movie using Gary's mod.

1668
02:03:15,224 --> 02:03:18,185
[SPEAKER_02]: It does have a real creepster ending to it, actually.

1669
02:03:18,446 --> 02:03:19,867
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole movie's kind of a downer.

1670
02:03:20,547 --> 02:03:25,030
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it really leaves you with more questions than you start the movie with.

1671
02:03:25,050 --> 02:03:25,990
[SPEAKER_02]: But it wasn't a bad movie.

1672
02:03:26,010 --> 02:03:28,032
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just kind of like, the fuck?

1673
02:03:28,712 --> 02:03:29,973
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my reaction at the end.

1674
02:03:29,993 --> 02:03:31,774
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, the fuck?

1675
02:03:31,994 --> 02:03:34,936
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a movie that I think everyone needs to see at least once.

1676
02:03:35,356 --> 02:03:35,676
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1677
02:03:35,756 --> 02:03:42,542
[SPEAKER_05]: In a movie that leaves you talking... And for a low-budget movie, it was intelligently done, I think.

1678
02:03:43,183 --> 02:03:45,244
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely one that's a thinker, too.

1679
02:03:45,384 --> 02:03:46,505
[SPEAKER_02]: So would it be a low-budget game?

1680
02:03:47,446 --> 02:03:47,987
Perhaps.

1681
02:03:48,627 --> 02:03:52,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, given that you probably only need to make one environment over and over.

1682
02:03:53,891 --> 02:03:54,192
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

1683
02:03:54,212 --> 02:03:56,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, when they did... That's how they made the movie cheap.

1684
02:03:57,414 --> 02:03:59,976
[SPEAKER_05]: They seriously used the same room and they turned them around.

1685
02:04:00,077 --> 02:04:04,580
[SPEAKER_05]: And when they did Cube 2, it was also relatively inexpensive.

1686
02:04:04,620 --> 02:04:07,423
[SPEAKER_05]: They just had those white walls with different lights behind them.

1687
02:04:07,683 --> 02:04:08,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Easy, easy.

1688
02:04:11,398 --> 02:04:13,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody has to bother, by the way, with the third movie.

1689
02:04:13,999 --> 02:04:21,121
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt is suggesting, Jamie, if you like theoretical physics, I would tell you to check out the movie What the Bleep Do We Know?

1690
02:04:21,441 --> 02:04:22,261
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard of that movie.

1691
02:04:22,541 --> 02:04:24,402
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been wanting to see it, actually.

1692
02:04:24,802 --> 02:04:26,402
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have to Netflix that or something.

1693
02:04:27,163 --> 02:04:31,404
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime, though, Jamie has no time to Netflix because she has to dive into the mailbag.

1694
02:04:32,364 --> 02:04:43,889
[SPEAKER_02]: and read your emails at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Every week you guys send us emails to our Mailbag and DarkSakura will jump in, read a few, possibly criticize their grammar and then we'll answer your questions here on the show.

1695
02:04:44,009 --> 02:04:49,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, that's Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Although more and more people have been submitting them through the website recently.

1696
02:04:49,632 --> 02:04:50,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess there's a form you can fill out.

1697
02:04:50,973 --> 02:04:58,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Deekman makes the magic happen on the website and he made it magical where people send us bleeps through the website now.

1698
02:04:58,867 --> 02:05:02,490
[SPEAKER_05]: And Dragonboy69 is actually sending us a tech support question.

1699
02:05:03,631 --> 02:05:07,353
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have to read this because I don't know if Loki will laugh.

1700
02:05:08,394 --> 02:05:10,015
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if you can assist me with my issue.

1701
02:05:10,055 --> 02:05:13,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I have an iMac and just attempted to sign up to your site.

1702
02:05:13,978 --> 02:05:17,060
[SPEAKER_05]: However, when trying to log in, it goes to white screen with the words invalid token.

1703
02:05:17,380 --> 02:05:18,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this because I'm on an iMac?

1704
02:05:19,662 --> 02:05:22,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you in advance for any help you can provide me with this matter.

1705
02:05:22,723 --> 02:05:24,704
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't think it's because you're on an iMac.

1706
02:05:26,044 --> 02:05:26,684
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll help you later.

1707
02:05:26,844 --> 02:05:31,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen the website do that before and I think it's because a lot of people hit it at once sometimes.

1708
02:05:32,006 --> 02:05:33,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe it or not, we're kind of popular.

1709
02:05:33,326 --> 02:05:34,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Use Firefox, not Safari.

1710
02:05:36,343 --> 02:05:40,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, just reload, or use your back button and try to log in again.

1711
02:05:40,606 --> 02:05:42,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually it will kind of work itself out.

1712
02:05:42,307 --> 02:05:45,089
[SPEAKER_02]: If it keeps doing it to you, come back after like an hour.

1713
02:05:45,169 --> 02:05:46,790
[SPEAKER_02]: We honestly don't know what causes it.

1714
02:05:47,170 --> 02:05:58,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, our website is a popular target for spammers, and when they clog up the pipes with their poop, then it kind of prevents the rest of us from logging in, but it has nothing to do with the fact that you're on an iMac, as far as we know.

1715
02:05:58,838 --> 02:06:00,579
[SPEAKER_02]: The website's worked on a Mac for me before.

1716
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:02,161
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't an iMac, granted, but...

1717
02:06:02,981 --> 02:06:03,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1718
02:06:04,002 --> 02:06:04,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, OLR.

1719
02:06:05,503 --> 02:06:06,904
[SPEAKER_05]: I look forward to your show every week.

1720
02:06:07,064 --> 02:06:08,745
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have a couple of questions for OLR.

1721
02:06:09,266 --> 02:06:14,710
[SPEAKER_05]: What Sega Model 1 or 2 or Model 3 arcade games urgently needs an Xbox Live conversion?

1722
02:06:15,150 --> 02:06:15,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, heavens.

1723
02:06:16,071 --> 02:06:18,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really looking forward to Daytona USA or Scud Race.

1724
02:06:18,733 --> 02:06:21,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it called Super GT in the US?

1725
02:06:21,755 --> 02:06:22,235
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

1726
02:06:22,776 --> 02:06:26,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I think Super Hang-On needs a good update like Sega did to OutRun.

1727
02:06:26,779 --> 02:06:27,499
[SPEAKER_05]: I would agree with that.

1728
02:06:28,140 --> 02:06:29,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you guys... Okay, yeah.

1729
02:06:29,381 --> 02:06:30,001
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the first one.

1730
02:06:30,021 --> 02:06:31,202
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think would make a good...

1731
02:06:32,683 --> 02:06:33,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Release.

1732
02:06:34,544 --> 02:06:43,609
[SPEAKER_03]: If they had some sort of gun controller, any of the gun games would be good, like Gunblade or even, you know, House of the Dead or that kind of stuff.

1733
02:06:43,729 --> 02:06:45,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Planet Harrier.

1734
02:06:46,190 --> 02:06:47,291
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Hikari, though.

1735
02:06:47,311 --> 02:06:47,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

1736
02:06:47,891 --> 02:06:48,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Planet Harrier.

1737
02:06:52,334 --> 02:06:56,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we get... No, I'm kidding.

1738
02:06:56,916 --> 02:06:58,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, that wouldn't be bad.

1739
02:06:58,117 --> 02:07:00,258
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you could even have steering wheel support.

1740
02:07:00,438 --> 02:07:01,979
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe it wouldn't have draw-in.

1741
02:07:03,536 --> 02:07:04,237
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be cool.

1742
02:07:04,837 --> 02:07:09,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you guys planning on a new show for foreign listeners after the mishaps of your previous effort?

1743
02:07:09,841 --> 02:07:10,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, that's right.

1744
02:07:10,802 --> 02:07:14,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't the Euro show when the last computer just finally died?

1745
02:07:14,505 --> 02:07:15,266
[SPEAKER_05]: It exploded, yeah.

1746
02:07:15,286 --> 02:07:15,826
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1747
02:07:17,167 --> 02:07:17,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's pick a date.

1748
02:07:18,108 --> 02:07:21,771
[SPEAKER_02]: We will have to do that, but it's going to have to be like in June at least.

1749
02:07:23,072 --> 02:07:23,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1750
02:07:24,413 --> 02:07:30,638
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be sometime... It'll have to be at least June because next week I'm going to literally be running in here at the last second because I'm going on a trip.

1751
02:07:31,539 --> 02:07:31,779
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

1752
02:07:33,380 --> 02:08:01,723
[SPEAKER_02]: and the weekend after by the way we won't be here Memorial Day weekend we will not be here at least I won't be here and I think that Rob's gonna be getting some shush I'm going to Oregon on a getaway so we're doing that and so I'm not gonna be here and I imagine a lot of listeners are probably gonna be doing their vacations and stuff too so we'll not be here Memorial Day weekend but sometime either June maybe July maybe like 4th of July weekend or something cause that'll be a long weekend too we can do something

1753
02:08:01,883 --> 02:08:02,564
[SPEAKER_05]: We could do something.

1754
02:08:02,864 --> 02:08:05,666
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think that we should plan it around a major holiday.

1755
02:08:06,226 --> 02:08:07,087
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what we should do?

1756
02:08:07,527 --> 02:08:11,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the 4th of July weekend just start at 8 in the morning and then finish late at night.

1757
02:08:11,790 --> 02:08:13,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Although Bobby will probably want to do a show somewhere in there.

1758
02:08:15,113 --> 02:08:15,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Figure something out.

1759
02:08:15,874 --> 02:08:17,315
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have to figure something out.

1760
02:08:17,435 --> 02:08:19,276
[SPEAKER_05]: We also need to do another road show.

1761
02:08:20,397 --> 02:08:20,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

1762
02:08:21,057 --> 02:08:21,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Road show.

1763
02:08:21,478 --> 02:08:22,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And last question to DarkSakura.

1764
02:08:22,919 --> 02:08:24,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are there no more Rob floods?

1765
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:24,940
[SPEAKER_05]: I really miss them.

1766
02:08:25,421 --> 02:08:26,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you asked for it.

1767
02:08:26,141 --> 02:08:26,902
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1768
02:08:27,622 --> 02:08:30,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub.

1769
02:08:31,690 --> 02:08:32,110
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1770
02:08:33,330 --> 02:08:33,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

1771
02:08:34,331 --> 02:08:34,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Die!

1772
02:08:36,211 --> 02:08:36,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's it.

1773
02:08:37,191 --> 02:08:39,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for making a show nearly every week.

1774
02:08:39,892 --> 02:08:41,753
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a real relief to listen to OLR.

1775
02:08:41,773 --> 02:08:45,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Your lighthearted view on things is very welcome in a world that's way too serious.

1776
02:08:45,453 --> 02:08:47,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much, Fabrice from Belgium.

1777
02:08:47,594 --> 02:08:47,854
[SPEAKER_05]: P.S.

1778
02:08:47,894 --> 02:08:50,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Was my spelling and grammar okay?

1779
02:08:50,955 --> 02:08:52,595
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't put a question mark at the end of okay.

1780
02:08:53,815 --> 02:08:55,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than that, spot on.

1781
02:08:55,696 --> 02:08:58,837
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's from Belgium, so he gets a little... They have question marks in Belgium!

1782
02:09:02,258 --> 02:09:04,681
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.

1783
02:09:04,701 --> 02:09:06,123
[SPEAKER_02]: A question from our chat room.

1784
02:09:06,203 --> 02:09:08,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Wetu in our chat room asks, what is Memorial Day for?

1785
02:09:09,288 --> 02:09:14,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if maybe he's Canadian or from a foreign country or maybe one of the Americans that doesn't know the difference.

1786
02:09:14,395 --> 02:09:15,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is, quickly.

1787
02:09:15,577 --> 02:09:16,939
[SPEAKER_02]: In the US, there's two...

1788
02:09:17,239 --> 02:09:18,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1789
02:09:38,264 --> 02:09:48,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Veterans Day is the day that's in November, and that's the day to honor those that are still serving or alive and used to serve a veteran.

1790
02:09:48,907 --> 02:09:52,048
[SPEAKER_02]: So one for those that have passed away, one for those that are still alive, basically.

1791
02:09:52,909 --> 02:10:00,931
[SPEAKER_05]: In other words, Memorial Day would be like for my papa, my grandfather, and Veterans Day would be like for my brother.

1792
02:10:01,231 --> 02:10:04,012
[SPEAKER_02]: But both days, great sales at Macy's.

1793
02:10:06,773 --> 02:10:07,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me I'm wrong.

1794
02:10:07,995 --> 02:10:08,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me I'm wrong.

1795
02:10:10,738 --> 02:10:10,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1796
02:10:12,080 --> 02:10:14,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I just read a message from Becky.

1797
02:10:14,683 --> 02:10:17,747
[SPEAKER_05]: She said I made her snort by saying there's question marks in Belgium.

1798
02:10:17,767 --> 02:10:20,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there are indeed question marks in Belgium.

1799
02:10:20,770 --> 02:10:21,151
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.

1800
02:10:23,830 --> 02:10:30,393
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a while since I've had a chance to email you guys.

1801
02:10:30,693 --> 02:10:33,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Last time Loki had turned me under Earth Defense Force on 360.

1802
02:10:35,075 --> 02:10:35,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Still playing, by the way.

1803
02:10:36,095 --> 02:10:38,577
[SPEAKER_05]: My question is in regards to the zombie talk from last week.

1804
02:10:39,017 --> 02:10:44,519
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys talked about what music you would kill zombies to, but where would you set up HQ?

1805
02:10:44,799 --> 02:10:47,961
[SPEAKER_05]: My roommate and I have argued between a Super Walmart, a mall, and a Costco.

1806
02:10:48,641 --> 02:10:50,623
[SPEAKER_05]: PS, sorry if the grammar is bad.

1807
02:10:50,983 --> 02:10:54,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Had a 14 hour work day and I'm typing in the dark so that I do not wake the wife.

1808
02:10:54,887 --> 02:10:55,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Good husband.

1809
02:10:56,069 --> 02:11:01,013
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, I only give people a hard time if they're really, really, really crappy.

1810
02:11:03,256 --> 02:11:04,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Where would I set up shop?

1811
02:11:06,659 --> 02:11:10,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I was flooding the chat room because they needed a spanking.

1812
02:11:10,223 --> 02:11:11,084
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the question here?

1813
02:11:11,997 --> 02:11:16,944
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, um, we talked about what music we would kill zombies to, but where would we set up HQ?

1814
02:11:17,384 --> 02:11:21,390
[SPEAKER_05]: My roommate and I would argue, is Super Walmart a mall or Costco?

1815
02:11:24,468 --> 02:11:28,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Dead Rising was set in a mall and I guess that did pretty well for Frank West.

1816
02:11:28,990 --> 02:11:31,091
[SPEAKER_05]: We could say an amusement park like Zombieland.

1817
02:11:31,151 --> 02:11:31,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, that would be fun.

1818
02:11:33,012 --> 02:11:33,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a museum.

1819
02:11:34,652 --> 02:11:36,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Might be fun too and especially scary.

1820
02:11:36,313 --> 02:11:37,653
[SPEAKER_02]: And who'd look for me in a museum?

1821
02:11:39,234 --> 02:11:39,894
[SPEAKER_02]: The zoo.

1822
02:11:41,435 --> 02:11:41,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Fort Knox.

1823
02:11:42,916 --> 02:11:44,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, good guess.

1824
02:11:45,077 --> 02:11:45,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Area 51.

1825
02:11:47,634 --> 02:11:58,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Studio 54 So you can get your club on and kill zombies My mom's house The Space Shuttle

1826
02:11:59,079 --> 02:12:00,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to get me up here, zombies.

1827
02:12:01,060 --> 02:12:04,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, Rob, why are there zombies outside?

1828
02:12:04,581 --> 02:12:07,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob, Rob, get rid of the zombies.

1829
02:12:08,282 --> 02:12:10,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know, this neighborhood has already gone to hell.

1830
02:12:11,203 --> 02:12:12,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are there zombies out front?

1831
02:12:12,823 --> 02:12:13,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

1832
02:12:14,284 --> 02:12:15,224
[SPEAKER_02]: She would annoy them away.

1833
02:12:15,244 --> 02:12:15,824
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be great.

1834
02:12:15,984 --> 02:12:18,005
[SPEAKER_05]: You know zombies would never make it in the south?

1835
02:12:19,426 --> 02:12:23,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially out in the rural south, just because of how many people have freaking guns.

1836
02:12:24,907 --> 02:12:26,868
[SPEAKER_05]: There'd probably be some good eating in New Orleans.

1837
02:12:27,273 --> 02:12:27,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1838
02:12:29,074 --> 02:12:29,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Robaba.

1839
02:12:30,755 --> 02:12:31,516
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not Robaba.

1840
02:12:31,596 --> 02:12:32,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Robaba sent us an email.

1841
02:12:32,877 --> 02:12:33,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay, here we go.

1842
02:12:34,058 --> 02:12:37,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I listened to your conversation about the Black Wii bundle leak, in quotes.

1843
02:12:37,900 --> 02:12:40,822
[SPEAKER_05]: The correspondence between Nintendo and GameStop sounded totally fake, i.e.

1844
02:12:40,883 --> 02:12:41,603
[SPEAKER_05]: viral marketing.

1845
02:12:41,783 --> 02:12:43,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo, bad dog.

1846
02:12:43,144 --> 02:12:47,427
[SPEAKER_05]: That leak totally advertised our new bundle a very convenient week before release.

1847
02:12:47,727 --> 02:12:51,870
[SPEAKER_05]: GameStop, we fired the guy and we'll never do it again unless you ask us to again.

1848
02:12:52,250 --> 02:12:53,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo, okay, but just this once.

1849
02:12:54,152 --> 02:12:54,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Well played.

1850
02:12:55,152 --> 02:12:55,453
Okay.

1851
02:12:56,394 --> 02:13:00,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Nintendo knows after all these years how to prevent this type of leak.

1852
02:13:01,140 --> 02:13:04,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Sending the promo standees every week ahead of time sounded intentional.

1853
02:13:05,905 --> 02:13:07,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, probably was.

1854
02:13:09,569 --> 02:13:15,977
[SPEAKER_02]: The more and more I hear about it, the more and more I think it was just kind of like one of those leaks to actually get people talking about the Black We.

1855
02:13:16,397 --> 02:13:17,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I read some chat comments?

1856
02:13:17,498 --> 02:13:18,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Because these are pretty funny.

1857
02:13:18,459 --> 02:13:18,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it.

1858
02:13:19,080 --> 02:13:19,340
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1859
02:13:20,282 --> 02:13:22,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Donovan suggests... These are all about the zombies.

1860
02:13:23,045 --> 02:13:24,006
[SPEAKER_02]: And where would you set up shop?

1861
02:13:24,046 --> 02:13:26,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Donovan's one of my buddies from Alabama, by the way.

1862
02:13:26,789 --> 02:13:27,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Donovan!

1863
02:13:27,729 --> 02:13:28,850
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my old school buddies.

1864
02:13:28,890 --> 02:13:34,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep thinking it's Travis Donovan from Under Station Live, but he wouldn't listen to this show.

1865
02:13:34,052 --> 02:13:39,794
[SPEAKER_05]: He's one of my major geek buddies and one of the people responsible for making me a bigger nerd than I was then.

1866
02:13:39,814 --> 02:13:41,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Clearly he's a geek if he's listening to this show.

1867
02:13:42,335 --> 02:13:44,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a hearty hello from us California kids.

1868
02:13:45,177 --> 02:13:48,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Us California kids have done a good job of corrupting Jamie, just so you know.

1869
02:13:49,179 --> 02:13:50,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, some comments about my mother's house.

1870
02:13:52,223 --> 02:13:53,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Ziba says, they're gross, Rob.

1871
02:13:54,006 --> 02:13:59,574
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tigerclaw follows that up with, yeah, Skye, and if your mom sees you shoot a zombie, she'd be like, Rob, that's gross.

1872
02:14:01,276 --> 02:14:04,220
[SPEAKER_02]: You go outside right now and clean that up, Rob.

1873
02:14:07,310 --> 02:14:08,071
[SPEAKER_05]: I like your mom.

1874
02:14:09,171 --> 02:14:10,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob Roberts.

1875
02:14:10,312 --> 02:14:10,752
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

1876
02:14:10,812 --> 02:14:11,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Although that's not really my name.

1877
02:14:12,774 --> 02:14:17,016
[SPEAKER_05]: We should call my mom next week and ask her what she would do if zombies showed up at her house.

1878
02:14:19,438 --> 02:14:26,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Salacious Pop says, LOL, the notoriously violent elitist bouncers of Studio 54 are a great anti-zombie tool.

1879
02:14:26,722 --> 02:14:27,583
[SPEAKER_02]: You look like shit.

1880
02:14:27,623 --> 02:14:28,303
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't get in.

1881
02:14:28,363 --> 02:14:28,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1882
02:14:28,824 --> 02:14:30,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Come back with some hot girls and try again.

1883
02:14:31,567 --> 02:14:32,328
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll see you next time.

1884
02:14:49,192 --> 02:14:50,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby!

1885
02:14:51,274 --> 02:14:52,035
Bobby!

1886
02:14:53,076 --> 02:14:54,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so the next email.

1887
02:14:54,357 --> 02:14:56,279
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually got a decent number of emails, by the way.

1888
02:14:57,240 --> 02:15:04,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear OLR, I know I probably don't fit your average demographic being a 31-year-old male carpenter, but I have to tell you something.

1889
02:15:04,506 --> 02:15:05,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Wednesdays and Thursdays.

1890
02:15:06,088 --> 02:15:06,688
[SPEAKER_05]: You know why?

1891
02:15:07,329 --> 02:15:11,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's usually the time you release your current podcast and I get to fix someone's house while listening to you guys.

1892
02:15:12,674 --> 02:15:13,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1893
02:15:13,875 --> 02:15:18,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Please, please, please keep on doing this show another seven years or at least until Loki is number one in GTA.

1894
02:15:19,119 --> 02:15:20,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for all you do, Serious Turtle.

1895
02:15:20,901 --> 02:15:26,125
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, dude, you're totally our... Okay, I'm 34.

1896
02:15:26,225 --> 02:15:26,385
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm 31.

1897
02:15:26,865 --> 02:15:30,828
[SPEAKER_05]: In college, working at hell on earth.

1898
02:15:30,908 --> 02:15:31,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, a job.

1899
02:15:32,429 --> 02:15:33,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus was a carpenter.

1900
02:15:33,991 --> 02:15:35,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you could totally be our Jesus.

1901
02:15:35,912 --> 02:15:36,412
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1902
02:15:36,833 --> 02:15:37,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you Jewish?

1903
02:15:37,373 --> 02:15:38,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, Jesus email.

1904
02:15:41,977 --> 02:15:43,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus listens to OLR.

1905
02:15:44,118 --> 02:15:44,379
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1906
02:15:45,399 --> 02:15:46,520
[SPEAKER_05]: That's horrible.

1907
02:15:46,840 --> 02:15:47,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob!

1908
02:15:48,661 --> 02:15:50,963
[SPEAKER_05]: You should be ashamed of yourself.

1909
02:15:50,983 --> 02:15:51,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you kidding?

1910
02:15:51,623 --> 02:15:52,964
[SPEAKER_02]: My mother would have told that joke.

1911
02:15:54,265 --> 02:15:54,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

1912
02:15:55,986 --> 02:15:57,207
[SPEAKER_05]: My mother would be ashamed of you.

1913
02:15:58,708 --> 02:16:00,269
[SPEAKER_02]: No, my mom.

1914
02:16:00,289 --> 02:16:01,910
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom.

1915
02:16:01,990 --> 02:16:03,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, you shouldn't say that.

1916
02:16:05,333 --> 02:16:06,753
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like secretly laughing.

1917
02:16:07,194 --> 02:16:12,697
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking that my mom would probably try to stifle the giggles like you do when you're at church.

1918
02:16:13,778 --> 02:16:14,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Superbook

1919
02:16:34,264 --> 02:16:36,286
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my show growing up.

1920
02:16:36,327 --> 02:16:37,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Superbook was the bomb.

1921
02:16:37,768 --> 02:16:38,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Superbook and Flying House.

1922
02:16:40,071 --> 02:16:40,572
[SPEAKER_05]: That was it.

1923
02:16:40,732 --> 02:16:41,052
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1924
02:16:41,773 --> 02:16:49,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, and for the record, I did used to sneak out of church and hang out in the church library reading, like... Well, would you go to hell for that, though?

1925
02:16:49,562 --> 02:16:53,187
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you would because, like, you're still, like, doing churchy things.

1926
02:16:53,939 --> 02:17:04,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, because, no, at the tender age of ten years old, and this, you know, I'm not making it any type of a secret, I'm converting to Judaism, eventually.

1927
02:17:06,171 --> 02:17:09,954
[SPEAKER_05]: I was sort of like, these were translated from Greek?

1928
02:17:10,575 --> 02:17:11,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't it written in Hebrew?

1929
02:17:12,316 --> 02:17:13,998
[SPEAKER_05]: And then go hang out in the library and look everything up.

1930
02:17:14,598 --> 02:17:15,359
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that was me.

1931
02:17:15,399 --> 02:17:16,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1932
02:17:16,260 --> 02:17:16,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1933
02:17:18,232 --> 02:17:18,893
[SPEAKER_06]: On the 700 Club, Rob.

1934
02:17:18,933 --> 02:17:20,454
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I know.

1935
02:17:45,024 --> 02:17:45,944
[SPEAKER_10]: I was a kid!

1936
02:17:47,225 --> 02:17:48,725
[SPEAKER_10]: It was totally old school anime.

1937
02:17:48,745 --> 02:17:53,387
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you think about it, some pretty badass shit happens in that cartoon.

1938
02:17:53,427 --> 02:17:56,227
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy's just splitting the ocean in half.

1939
02:17:56,267 --> 02:17:57,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Transformers didn't do that shit.

1940
02:17:57,868 --> 02:17:59,028
[SPEAKER_04]: It's totally old school anime.

1941
02:17:59,748 --> 02:18:00,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1942
02:18:00,309 --> 02:18:00,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1943
02:18:02,828 --> 02:18:03,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm over it.

1944
02:18:03,729 --> 02:18:04,249
[SPEAKER_02]: God.

1945
02:18:04,930 --> 02:18:09,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody gets too tense when it comes to religious topics.

1946
02:18:09,613 --> 02:18:12,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Have fun with it.

1947
02:18:13,656 --> 02:18:21,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to be in boy drag and I can... Salacious Pop, I need DarkSakura to dress in boy drag so she can sneak into the rabbi school and read the Torah.

1948
02:18:21,481 --> 02:18:22,242
[SPEAKER_02]: This needs to happen.

1949
02:18:22,302 --> 02:18:23,723
[SPEAKER_02]: And Singfather, can you hear me?

1950
02:18:24,043 --> 02:18:24,784
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1951
02:18:26,125 --> 02:18:28,346
[SPEAKER_05]: I could do that anyway if I wanted to be a rabbi.

1952
02:18:28,366 --> 02:18:30,007
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's move on.

1953
02:18:30,047 --> 02:18:30,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

1954
02:18:31,283 --> 02:18:31,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob What?

1955
02:18:44,717 --> 02:18:46,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi guys!

1956
02:18:47,699 --> 02:18:52,942
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just a quick note to thank you for sending out Mother's Day wishes to WeGaming moms.

1957
02:18:53,442 --> 02:18:56,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Your show is a welcome distraction from corporate tedium every week.

1958
02:18:57,384 --> 02:19:01,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to mention, and the mention of Mother's Day made it all the sweeter.

1959
02:19:01,867 --> 02:19:08,731
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm one of those that grew up on video games, still plays today, and believes that parents should be gaming with their children rather than shaking their heads over it.

1960
02:19:09,131 --> 02:19:10,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep up the good work, VeggieWolf!

1961
02:19:11,924 --> 02:19:12,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

1962
02:19:12,725 --> 02:19:14,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Parents, yay!

1963
02:19:14,405 --> 02:19:15,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Parenting your children.

1964
02:19:15,726 --> 02:19:17,087
[SPEAKER_02]: An extra special Mother's Day.

1965
02:19:17,367 --> 02:19:19,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Mother's Day is every day for you, lady.

1966
02:19:19,228 --> 02:19:20,929
[SPEAKER_02]: You deserve props.

1967
02:19:20,949 --> 02:19:21,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for you.

1968
02:19:21,489 --> 02:19:22,169
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good attitude.

1969
02:19:22,469 --> 02:19:26,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, I'm going to link this to you so that we can play it.

1970
02:19:26,651 --> 02:19:27,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1971
02:19:27,592 --> 02:19:34,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Because she sends another email that says, of course, right after I sent the last message, I heard the question about a good song for zombie killing.

1972
02:19:35,636 --> 02:19:36,996
[SPEAKER_05]: So I am going to...

1973
02:19:40,079 --> 02:19:55,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Copy this link location And by the way, while DarkSakura is sending that over to me SalaciousPop is clarifying That was the plot to Yentl That he was trying to get you a Barbra Streisand I know, I haven't seen Yentl Which I know I'm supposed to see Yentl Neither have I, bad gay You know what?

1974
02:19:56,251 --> 02:19:58,713
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're not having a Barbra Streisand night, vetoed

1975
02:19:59,093 --> 02:20:05,318
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm talking about watching... If we're going to watch things that involve cross-dressing, Rob, let's watch Yentl and Victor Victoria.

1976
02:20:05,459 --> 02:20:07,580
[SPEAKER_02]: No, let's watch Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.

1977
02:20:08,261 --> 02:20:09,162
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to see Yentl.

1978
02:20:10,543 --> 02:20:11,184
[SPEAKER_02]: You really don't.

1979
02:20:11,864 --> 02:20:13,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, here's the video that your emailer sent.

1980
02:20:15,047 --> 02:20:16,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, it contains content of an adult nature.

1981
02:20:16,989 --> 02:20:17,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray.

1982
02:20:17,349 --> 02:20:20,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, I can't believe... Oh, is this zombie killing music?

1983
02:20:20,452 --> 02:20:20,572
Yeah.

1984
02:20:27,745 --> 02:20:29,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we need to skip ahead a little bit.

1985
02:20:29,326 --> 02:20:30,967
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually sent the song, so let me send you the other link.

1986
02:20:31,568 --> 02:20:36,211
This is funny, because he's running over people with a lawnmower.

1987
02:20:36,291 --> 02:20:37,592
I sent you the actual song.

1988
02:20:55,305 --> 02:20:57,047
[SPEAKER_07]: This is funny.

1989
02:20:57,527 --> 02:20:58,508
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great radio.

1990
02:20:58,588 --> 02:21:00,230
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm watching a video and laughing at it.

1991
02:21:00,911 --> 02:21:01,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here's the other one.

1992
02:21:01,812 --> 02:21:03,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is the actual song.

1993
02:21:04,014 --> 02:21:05,596
[SPEAKER_06]: The Wurzels, Combined Harvester.

1994
02:21:16,258 --> 02:21:17,540
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to do that for our ridiculous news.

1995
02:21:31,239 --> 02:21:38,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, ever since I started listening to internet radio almost 10 years ago, I have always dreamed about listening to shoutcast.net stations in my car.

1996
02:21:38,745 --> 02:21:42,609
[SPEAKER_05]: When iPhone first came out, I was excited to learn that it can play streaming radio.

1997
02:21:43,009 --> 02:21:44,911
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I didn't have the money to get one.

1998
02:21:45,411 --> 02:21:58,602
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple months ago, I finally decided that I wanted to purchase one with some of my tax return money after I heard about the supposed 4G version of the iPhone being found at a bar I was hesitant to buy, knowing that this version may be released very soon.

1999
02:21:59,142 --> 02:22:02,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Since I haven't heard anything new about it in a while, I don't know what I should do.

2000
02:22:03,445 --> 02:22:10,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think this leak is delaying the 4G version to come out, or do you think it was just a marketing ploy by Apple and we're going to hear more about it very soon?

2001
02:22:10,551 --> 02:22:15,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't want to buy the 3GS and then a couple months later see a 4G version released and scream me over.

2002
02:22:15,474 --> 02:22:16,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Your fellow gamer girl, Ziba.

2003
02:22:17,476 --> 02:22:20,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I bought a 3G a couple months ago.

2004
02:22:22,253 --> 02:22:26,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumor is Jobes was pissed and called Gizmodo himself.

2005
02:22:26,476 --> 02:22:29,378
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the latest rumors that was on the blogs this week, but whatever.

2006
02:22:29,618 --> 02:22:30,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe it or not, I don't care.

2007
02:22:31,799 --> 02:22:36,502
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact is, fact, Apple will release information about a new phone in June.

2008
02:22:36,802 --> 02:22:45,908
[SPEAKER_02]: So my suggestion, if you think you can hold off until June, the end of June, which is only about a month away at this point, if you can hold off like one month, you're in good shape.

2009
02:22:46,349 --> 02:22:46,829
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be fine.

2010
02:22:47,809 --> 02:22:49,691
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'll have a better idea what to expect.

2011
02:22:50,511 --> 02:22:50,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

2012
02:22:51,852 --> 02:22:57,017
[SPEAKER_02]: The only other suggestion I really have is that keep in mind that iPhone's not your only option.

2013
02:22:57,298 --> 02:23:02,323
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they do have like tuner apps, I think, for BlackBerrys and the Droid.

2014
02:23:02,423 --> 02:23:03,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the other phones have them too.

2015
02:23:05,826 --> 02:23:06,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2016
02:23:06,107 --> 02:23:08,009
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't feeling the song for Mailbag Music.

2017
02:23:08,829 --> 02:23:10,251
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll find a purpose for it on the show, though.

2018
02:23:10,271 --> 02:23:10,852
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good song.

2019
02:23:11,192 --> 02:23:11,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2020
02:23:12,033 --> 02:23:12,373
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

2021
02:23:12,613 --> 02:23:14,155
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to find a use for that somewhere.

2022
02:23:15,471 --> 02:23:17,772
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, you know why I was so distracted earlier in Part A?

2023
02:23:17,792 --> 02:23:25,376
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because I was reading a friend's live journal and she had pictures up of, what's it, Root Root Beat?

2024
02:23:27,277 --> 02:23:28,118
[SPEAKER_05]: The new Bimani game?

2025
02:23:28,178 --> 02:23:28,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, U-Beat!

2026
02:23:28,778 --> 02:23:29,439
[SPEAKER_05]: U-Beat, yeah.

2027
02:23:30,179 --> 02:23:31,800
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looked very cubical.

2028
02:23:32,940 --> 02:23:35,282
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks, oh, our friend in Japan.

2029
02:23:35,402 --> 02:23:36,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that who that was?

2030
02:23:37,223 --> 02:23:40,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, U-Beat is kind of one of those games I'd like to play at some point.

2031
02:23:40,364 --> 02:23:41,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Weren't they testing it in the U.S.

2032
02:23:41,665 --> 02:23:43,546
[SPEAKER_02]: and then they just kind of stopped, I guess?

2033
02:23:44,395 --> 02:23:44,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2034
02:23:45,836 --> 02:23:48,657
[SPEAKER_05]: She listed it as Jewbeat.

2035
02:23:48,937 --> 02:23:55,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe it's you as in the Spanish J. I don't know.

2036
02:23:56,120 --> 02:23:58,641
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say there might be a chance at E3.

2037
02:23:58,761 --> 02:24:04,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes if Konami's got a lot of Bomani games they want to show, they'll roll out a lot of machines at E3.

2038
02:24:04,563 --> 02:24:05,584
[SPEAKER_04]: They had Supernova.

2039
02:24:06,084 --> 02:24:06,344
[SPEAKER_02]: They did.

2040
02:24:06,364 --> 02:24:08,025
[SPEAKER_02]: They brought a Beatmania 2DX machine in 2006, I think it was.

2041
02:24:08,045 --> 02:24:08,345
[SPEAKER_02]: They brought a...

2042
02:24:13,638 --> 02:24:15,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they'll bring them to E3 for awareness.

2043
02:24:15,679 --> 02:24:17,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why I mentioned that on the show.

2044
02:24:17,260 --> 02:24:18,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't it distorted?

2045
02:24:18,060 --> 02:24:19,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they're the Japanese games.

2046
02:24:20,101 --> 02:24:21,061
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't distorted.

2047
02:24:21,101 --> 02:24:21,582
[SPEAKER_02]: It was distorted.

2048
02:24:22,122 --> 02:24:22,742
[SPEAKER_02]: It was distorted.

2049
02:24:22,862 --> 02:24:23,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2050
02:24:23,663 --> 02:24:24,623
[SPEAKER_02]: They brought it to E3 one year.

2051
02:24:24,943 --> 02:24:26,144
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the new game that was out in Japan.

2052
02:24:26,404 --> 02:24:26,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2053
02:24:27,044 --> 02:24:28,425
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we'll see.

2054
02:24:28,745 --> 02:24:32,447
[SPEAKER_02]: But U-Beat, I don't think is... And it's not Jew-Beat.

2055
02:24:33,667 --> 02:24:40,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's why I didn't know because I had seen... I know, but a lot of people... Because it's J-U-B.

2056
02:24:40,354 --> 02:24:41,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen people spell it both ways.

2057
02:24:41,776 --> 02:24:48,402
[SPEAKER_05]: And besides that, I wouldn't have known if I hadn't seen the kana for it.

2058
02:24:49,463 --> 02:24:52,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to check it out at some point, but probably never will.

2059
02:24:53,840 --> 02:25:05,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, and they actually called it in the limited location test They actually called it, and DarkTest Studio clarifies in chat You beat, with like a U And that's not a bad name for a game But it could be taken many ways You beat what?

2060
02:25:07,913 --> 02:25:16,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're 12 Alright, this is the part of the show where we get a little bit angsty Because, I don't know, we've just been that way for 8 years So deal with it, it's CFU's of the week

2061
02:25:33,152 --> 02:25:37,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Effie goes to allergies and the city of Dixon, namely their pollen.

2062
02:25:41,054 --> 02:25:41,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki!

2063
02:25:42,094 --> 02:25:44,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Effie to bad CD dumps.

2064
02:25:47,155 --> 02:25:47,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it sucks.

2065
02:25:49,715 --> 02:26:01,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know, like overall I've had a pretty good week, but then the past couple days, like Mother Nature or whoever has it out for me out there was just kind of like, I'm gonna kick you, brr brr brr, repeatedly, brr brr, in the balls, brr brr.

2066
02:26:02,486 --> 02:26:29,830
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually, you know what, all things considered Things could be a lot worse And I don't have it so bad So I'm not that angsty But I will say an FU Oh, there was something that ticked me off the other day And I was like, that's going to be my FU of the week on OLR Now I can't remember what it was, so I guess it didn't make me that angsty FU to the fact that I still don't go out and buy a new car I've been saying I'm going to do it for like a year and I still haven't FU to myself

2067
02:26:31,058 --> 02:26:36,901
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's get into a couple more stories and then... Oh, God, your calls.

2068
02:26:36,921 --> 02:26:38,121
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2069
02:26:38,241 --> 02:26:44,324
[SPEAKER_02]: After a couple more stories here, the Skype line will be open at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2070
02:26:44,804 --> 02:26:46,125
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, a couple more stories.

2071
02:26:46,225 --> 02:26:46,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki?

2072
02:26:46,905 --> 02:26:49,527
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure with Infinity War going...

2073
02:26:50,487 --> 02:26:53,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really going their separate ways, but they're kind of dissolving, if you know what I mean.

2074
02:26:55,791 --> 02:26:59,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure they're going to treat the Call of Duty franchise with the utmost respect.

2075
02:27:00,214 --> 02:27:09,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, you kind of wonder with all these different domain names that they're registering, and I'm sure a lot of it's just to kind of make sure that people aren't squatting in the domains.

2076
02:27:10,441 --> 02:27:13,223
[SPEAKER_03]: But, a little bit's kind of weird.

2077
02:27:13,243 --> 02:27:14,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, like for example...

2078
02:27:14,844 --> 02:27:23,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Call of Duty Future Warfare, Advanced Warfare, Secret Warfare, and Space Warfare Space Warfare, huh?

2079
02:27:23,790 --> 02:27:25,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Space Warfare

2080
02:27:43,106 --> 02:27:49,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Call of Duty in space Well, that's gotta be better than vagina warfare

2081
02:27:50,037 --> 02:27:52,038
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm being completely serious right now.

2082
02:27:52,098 --> 02:27:54,600
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a new game out, and it's about Vagina.

2083
02:27:55,520 --> 02:27:57,301
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a game called Privates.

2084
02:27:59,282 --> 02:28:03,445
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the PC, and apparently it's coming to the Xbox 360.

2085
02:28:03,845 --> 02:28:10,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how the hell this is happening, but apparently it's coming to 360, or at least that's what the developers would tell you.

2086
02:28:10,069 --> 02:28:11,790
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Zombie Cow Studios.

2087
02:28:12,870 --> 02:28:13,131
[SPEAKER_02]: It is...

2088
02:28:16,052 --> 02:28:28,294
[SPEAKER_02]: You lead a teeny tiny gang of condom-hatted marines as they delve into people's vaginas and bottoms and blast away at all manner of oozy, shouty monsters.

2089
02:28:34,456 --> 02:28:37,856
[SPEAKER_02]: So you will be able to shoot the monsters that live inside the vagina.

2090
02:28:39,457 --> 02:28:40,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Take this, yeast infection!

2091
02:28:43,382 --> 02:28:47,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, actually, you will be able to blast all manners of grody infections.

2092
02:28:47,563 --> 02:28:48,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, this looks like a sperm.

2093
02:28:48,824 --> 02:28:49,984
[SPEAKER_05]: This looks fucking gross.

2094
02:28:50,004 --> 02:28:51,305
[SPEAKER_05]: This looks like an evil sperm.

2095
02:28:51,565 --> 02:28:56,306
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all for, like, you know, pushing the envelope and everything of good taste.

2096
02:28:56,786 --> 02:28:59,587
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is just stupid.

2097
02:29:00,247 --> 02:29:03,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, really, really stupid.

2098
02:29:05,969 --> 02:29:07,610
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I'll have to play it at least once.

2099
02:29:07,670 --> 02:29:08,730
[SPEAKER_05]: You're shooting sperm.

2100
02:29:08,750 --> 02:29:09,751
[SPEAKER_05]: You're shooting evil sperm.

2101
02:29:09,771 --> 02:29:10,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that.

2102
02:29:10,391 --> 02:29:11,111
[SPEAKER_05]: They're evil sperm.

2103
02:29:12,876 --> 02:29:13,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they are.

2104
02:29:13,437 --> 02:29:14,357
[SPEAKER_02]: They are evil sperm.

2105
02:29:15,218 --> 02:29:17,460
[SPEAKER_02]: How in the hell is this coming out on Xbox 360?

2106
02:29:17,500 --> 02:29:19,862
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to make a live journal icon out of one of these evil sperms.

2107
02:29:19,882 --> 02:29:21,324
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not coming out on the 360.

2108
02:29:22,084 --> 02:29:23,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who the hell they think they're kidding.

2109
02:29:24,226 --> 02:29:28,510
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's no way this game would not get an AO rating.

2110
02:29:29,010 --> 02:29:32,653
[SPEAKER_02]: And Microsoft has it in their thing that AO games will not be released.

2111
02:29:32,693 --> 02:29:35,836
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if they try to do it as an indie game, it will not get past the review board.

2112
02:29:36,136 --> 02:29:37,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Who the hell do they think they're kidding?

2113
02:29:40,458 --> 02:29:42,499
[SPEAKER_02]: It is kind of funny, though, in a 12-year-old sort of way.

2114
02:29:42,539 --> 02:29:44,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's the whole point, right?

2115
02:29:46,160 --> 02:29:53,743
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's open up the Skype line right now at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2116
02:29:53,863 --> 02:29:55,564
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to give us a call, you can right now.

2117
02:29:55,584 --> 02:30:00,426
[SPEAKER_02]: To give us your thoughts on tonight's show or anything else maybe you wanted to hear us talk about that we didn't do.

2118
02:30:00,946 --> 02:30:01,606
[SPEAKER_02]: How rude.

2119
02:30:02,106 --> 02:30:03,787
[SPEAKER_02]: You can give us a call and set us straight at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2120
02:30:07,070 --> 02:30:10,684
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime, we'll go try to get some last minute stories.

2121
02:30:11,165 --> 02:30:12,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

2122
02:30:13,584 --> 02:30:21,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, something that we were talking a little bit about, a movie coming for a game franchise.

2123
02:30:21,150 --> 02:30:31,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this isn't necessarily a game franchise that's getting a movie, but it has game stuff in it, and that would be that wonderful short film, Pixels.

2124
02:30:31,337 --> 02:30:32,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, caller, we'll get to you in just a moment.

2125
02:30:33,659 --> 02:30:41,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Pixels, which featured Donkey Kong, Frogger, Space Invaders, and different stuff from Arkanoid, that's being actually made into a full-length movie now.

2126
02:30:42,136 --> 02:30:43,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was reading about that the other day.

2127
02:30:43,697 --> 02:30:44,217
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

2128
02:30:44,257 --> 02:30:46,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Happy Madison actually picked it up.

2129
02:30:47,038 --> 02:30:48,118
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let me go to the phone.

2130
02:30:48,198 --> 02:30:48,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Caller, are you there?

2131
02:30:48,918 --> 02:30:50,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2132
02:30:50,299 --> 02:30:50,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2133
02:30:52,240 --> 02:30:52,860
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Rob.

2134
02:30:53,720 --> 02:30:55,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, hey, I like your name.

2135
02:30:55,121 --> 02:30:55,721
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Rob?

2136
02:30:57,046 --> 02:30:58,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I am getting feedback.

2137
02:30:58,206 --> 02:30:59,387
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to have to hang up.

2138
02:31:15,931 --> 02:31:22,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes folks will get a little bit of echo because just a little bit of background as to the way we do it here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2139
02:31:23,653 --> 02:31:25,193
[SPEAKER_02]: We have speakers in studio.

2140
02:31:25,233 --> 02:31:29,754
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not wear headsets because there's too many of us to have headsets, especially if we have a guest.

2141
02:31:30,135 --> 02:31:31,435
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have in-house speakers.

2142
02:31:31,815 --> 02:31:35,636
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes you will hear yourself over the speaker, and it's a little crazy.

2143
02:31:36,036 --> 02:31:39,357
[SPEAKER_02]: So do be aware of that if you call in and kind of hear yourself.

2144
02:31:39,937 --> 02:31:40,197
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2145
02:31:41,317 --> 02:31:42,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try again.

2146
02:31:42,438 --> 02:31:43,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2147
02:31:43,398 --> 02:31:43,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2148
02:31:44,773 --> 02:31:46,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, this is Rob-a-ba again.

2149
02:31:46,815 --> 02:31:47,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's Rob-a-ba.

2150
02:31:48,877 --> 02:31:50,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2151
02:31:50,719 --> 02:31:51,460
[SPEAKER_02]: The Rob-a-ba.

2152
02:31:51,500 --> 02:31:52,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you still getting feedback?

2153
02:31:53,802 --> 02:31:56,064
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I was listening to the show.

2154
02:31:56,124 --> 02:31:58,627
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to turn off the feed so I could hear you.

2155
02:31:59,067 --> 02:32:00,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yes, that's a good thing.

2156
02:32:00,269 --> 02:32:03,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like when you call real radio, you have to turn off your speakers, so that will happen.

2157
02:32:04,252 --> 02:32:07,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hey, I'm glad you're calling in, Rob-a-ba.

2158
02:32:07,075 --> 02:32:07,576
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

2159
02:32:08,590 --> 02:32:13,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well, first of all, I saw you and Bobby playing 3D.GameHeroes this afternoon.

2160
02:32:13,993 --> 02:32:14,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2161
02:32:14,393 --> 02:32:18,015
[SPEAKER_08]: And have you gotten to Ortego Town?

2162
02:32:18,155 --> 02:32:19,036
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the second town.

2163
02:32:20,036 --> 02:32:21,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that the one in the desert?

2164
02:32:22,037 --> 02:32:22,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2165
02:32:22,678 --> 02:32:26,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the one with the foo-foo sequence or whatever it was called?

2166
02:32:27,580 --> 02:32:28,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Poof-poof.

2167
02:32:28,341 --> 02:32:29,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Poof-poof, that's it.

2168
02:32:29,701 --> 02:32:31,042
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the poof-poof sequence.

2169
02:32:32,223 --> 02:32:34,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you might have been inquiring about?

2170
02:32:35,731 --> 02:32:38,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I thought that was hilarious and also really dirty.

2171
02:32:38,893 --> 02:32:39,633
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very dirty.

2172
02:32:39,913 --> 02:32:51,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, in mine, like, I don't know if it was just the way I was playing, but when he woke up from Poof Poof, it was the chick's dad was there and saying, doesn't he give really good massages?

2173
02:32:52,060 --> 02:32:54,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I was like, this game is filthy.

2174
02:32:54,601 --> 02:32:55,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely filthy.

2175
02:32:57,256 --> 02:32:58,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's what I thought too.

2176
02:32:58,917 --> 02:33:04,680
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, they used massages the same way that Incredible Crisis used massages to mean something else.

2177
02:33:06,581 --> 02:33:07,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

2178
02:33:07,822 --> 02:33:09,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what do you think of 3D.GameHeroes?

2179
02:33:09,563 --> 02:33:11,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, you've played a little bit if you've made it to Poof Poof.

2180
02:33:13,745 --> 02:33:18,568
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm enjoying it at a Zelda level, but it doesn't seem to go much beyond Zelda.

2181
02:33:20,276 --> 02:33:24,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Weren't you a little bit, like, just slightly disappointed at the customization features in it?

2182
02:33:24,960 --> 02:33:35,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, maybe I'm just being a greedy bastard, but I was kind of like, you know, again, we live in an era of LittleBigPlanet, and I was kind of disappointed that the only thing you get to change is the way the hero looks.

2183
02:33:35,088 --> 02:33:40,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I was kind of thinking, like, maybe I'm crazy, but that there would have been more customizability to it.

2184
02:33:41,789 --> 02:33:42,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Death by Poof Poof

2185
02:34:03,698 --> 02:34:07,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I have one more thing to say, and I'm going to post a link in the chat.

2186
02:34:07,682 --> 02:34:24,680
[SPEAKER_08]: There was some story on Digital Times about 10 million iPhones being ordered by Apple, of course, and that they work on the Verizon-type network.

2187
02:34:25,959 --> 02:34:28,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

2188
02:34:28,741 --> 02:34:39,509
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought, and I could have sworn I read this earlier this week, and I'm looking at your story right now, I'm pulling it up, but I thought that the AT&T came out and laid it on the table and said, you know what, bitches?

2189
02:34:39,630 --> 02:34:44,733
[SPEAKER_02]: We're under contract until 2012, so you need to STFU when it comes to this whole Verizon talk.

2190
02:34:45,714 --> 02:34:47,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but not if they call it an iPad Mini.

2191
02:34:48,817 --> 02:34:50,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying.

2192
02:34:51,259 --> 02:34:52,760
[SPEAKER_02]: That's shady, but funny.

2193
02:34:54,198 --> 02:34:55,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't think 10 million.

2194
02:34:55,499 --> 02:35:00,281
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's fake because 10 million is a really bad number to order at startup.

2195
02:35:00,801 --> 02:35:03,622
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be more like two, two to five.

2196
02:35:04,622 --> 02:35:05,183
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

2197
02:35:05,603 --> 02:35:07,224
[SPEAKER_02]: The iPad didn't even have that many.

2198
02:35:07,384 --> 02:35:11,846
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was far less, like not even a million iPads did they order right away.

2199
02:35:12,946 --> 02:35:15,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, something strikes me as fishy about this too.

2200
02:35:16,325 --> 02:35:18,366
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just thought I'd add it because you talked about it earlier.

2201
02:35:20,067 --> 02:35:24,129
[SPEAKER_02]: And like it or not, iPhone is a gaming platform and needs to be recognized.

2202
02:35:24,209 --> 02:35:28,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially, we're seeing ports of so many, not just classic, but new.

2203
02:35:28,891 --> 02:35:31,172
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get Street Fighter 4 on the friggin' iPhone.

2204
02:35:31,852 --> 02:35:36,995
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't consider the iPhone a gaming platform at this point, you are behind the times.

2205
02:35:37,935 --> 02:35:38,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, sir.

2206
02:35:39,156 --> 02:35:39,417
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2207
02:35:39,657 --> 02:35:44,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Robaba, it's nice to hear from you, like actual here as opposed to emails.

2208
02:35:44,160 --> 02:35:44,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, don't get us wrong.

2209
02:35:45,021 --> 02:35:48,283
[SPEAKER_02]: We love the emails too, but always good to hear from new callers.

2210
02:35:48,343 --> 02:35:51,206
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything else quickly you want to get out there before we let you go?

2211
02:35:52,186 --> 02:35:52,787
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's it.

2212
02:35:53,207 --> 02:35:53,908
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Robaba.

2213
02:35:53,948 --> 02:35:54,728
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a great night.

2214
02:35:56,049 --> 02:35:56,310
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2215
02:35:56,450 --> 02:35:56,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye-bye.

2216
02:35:58,091 --> 02:35:58,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get it?

2217
02:35:58,551 --> 02:35:58,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye-bye?

2218
02:36:00,092 --> 02:36:00,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget it.

2219
02:36:00,393 --> 02:36:02,334
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2220
02:36:02,434 --> 02:36:03,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

2221
02:36:03,895 --> 02:36:05,096
[SPEAKER_02]: We can take a few more calls here.

2222
02:36:06,297 --> 02:36:06,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

2223
02:36:07,398 --> 02:36:18,501
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I gave him a pass on some of the Skype etiquette and so forth because A, I know he's listened to the show forever, and B, you know, if it's your first time calling in, I'll give you a pass on some of that stuff.

2224
02:36:18,781 --> 02:36:20,382
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all is forgiven.

2225
02:36:21,302 --> 02:36:22,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2226
02:36:22,442 --> 02:36:22,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2227
02:36:24,143 --> 02:36:24,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's up, guys?

2228
02:36:24,823 --> 02:36:25,503
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Kaijudo.

2229
02:36:25,843 --> 02:36:26,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's up?

2230
02:36:26,603 --> 02:36:27,103
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

2231
02:36:28,524 --> 02:36:28,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much.

2232
02:36:29,004 --> 02:36:34,125
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I just want to say that, what was the game you were just talking about?

2233
02:36:34,205 --> 02:36:34,946
[SPEAKER_01]: The Zelda?

2234
02:36:34,966 --> 02:36:35,886
[SPEAKER_02]: 3D.gameheroes.

2235
02:36:37,741 --> 02:36:39,282
[SPEAKER_01]: I call that basically Lego Zelda.

2236
02:36:39,442 --> 02:36:40,342
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a confusing game.

2237
02:36:41,223 --> 02:36:49,066
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that it was kind of like a love letter to Zelda and all the other games from back in the day.

2238
02:36:50,146 --> 02:36:56,149
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not knocking them for making what everyone's calling a Zelda clone, but just the look of it.

2239
02:36:56,349 --> 02:36:58,530
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks really shitty, man.

2240
02:36:58,870 --> 02:37:00,931
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like RPG Maker for PlayStation 2.

2241
02:37:01,934 --> 02:37:02,955
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really bad looking game.

2242
02:37:17,845 --> 02:37:29,596
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, you know, when you're doing retro, I get there's probably that the audience is sitting there listening to this right now going, well, shit, Rob, if you're doing a retro style game, what the hell do you expect them to do?

2243
02:37:30,237 --> 02:37:36,603
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, one thing might be like a free roaming camera as opposed to four fixed cameras you could pick from.

2244
02:37:37,263 --> 02:38:02,807
[SPEAKER_02]: and yes I understand you get to do them in screenshots but I don't know it seems like they did have some optimization problems because again frame skip in a dungeon that's not okay you know just tone down the water effects they didn't need to be that awesome you know yeah I mean yeah that that game I'm pretty sure is giving a lot of people seizures with the water and I mean I can't even make out what I'm looking at half the time you know it's I don't know it's just a really weird

2245
02:38:03,507 --> 02:38:04,467
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a creepy looking game to me.

2246
02:38:04,567 --> 02:38:10,368
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was never into the Zelda games to begin with, so I would never pick it up, but it's just strange.

2247
02:38:10,388 --> 02:38:12,009
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, something off with it.

2248
02:38:12,269 --> 02:38:17,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, if you weren't into Zelda, there ain't nothing here for you.

2249
02:38:17,950 --> 02:38:20,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just walk right on by, there ain't nothing here for you.

2250
02:38:21,851 --> 02:38:27,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that sword is maybe the worst weapon I've ever seen in a video game, just the look of it.

2251
02:38:27,272 --> 02:38:28,452
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just over the top, man.

2252
02:38:29,301 --> 02:38:31,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I can't knock it too much because I haven't played it.

2253
02:38:31,623 --> 02:38:33,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe playing it, you actually get some enjoyment out of it.

2254
02:38:33,964 --> 02:38:39,508
[SPEAKER_01]: But looking at it, I literally wanted to puke on the television screen.

2255
02:38:39,528 --> 02:38:40,689
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a horrible looking game.

2256
02:38:40,789 --> 02:38:45,292
[SPEAKER_02]: The best thing I could compare that sword to is just another LOL moment.

2257
02:38:45,452 --> 02:38:47,893
[SPEAKER_02]: And that game has a lot of LOL moments.

2258
02:38:48,053 --> 02:38:50,855
[SPEAKER_02]: And that ridiculous sword is just another one of them.

2259
02:38:51,276 --> 02:38:52,236
[SPEAKER_02]: You just kind of sit there.

2260
02:38:52,256 --> 02:38:54,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't the sword get bigger as you level up?

2261
02:38:56,137 --> 02:38:58,319
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go to a blacksmith and get your sword.

2262
02:38:58,359 --> 02:39:00,581
[SPEAKER_02]: You can alter the length and width of your sword.

2263
02:39:00,621 --> 02:39:01,942
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just waiting for girth.

2264
02:39:02,102 --> 02:39:03,844
[SPEAKER_02]: I was waiting for girth to be an option too.

2265
02:39:04,665 --> 02:39:08,028
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, you can modify the beam that it fires.

2266
02:39:08,989 --> 02:39:11,871
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can go to a blacksmith and get some of that altered.

2267
02:39:13,673 --> 02:39:19,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, and my last comment is, are you guys getting, what is it, Redemption something?

2268
02:39:20,041 --> 02:39:20,461
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting it.

2269
02:39:20,481 --> 02:39:22,223
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember the name, but I'm definitely getting it.

2270
02:39:22,443 --> 02:39:23,303
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Loki.

2271
02:39:23,604 --> 02:39:25,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm absolutely getting it.

2272
02:39:25,606 --> 02:39:26,546
[SPEAKER_01]: You already have it, right?

2273
02:39:26,566 --> 02:39:27,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I already have it.

2274
02:39:27,667 --> 02:39:30,810
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm actually getting another copy, too, because I think I'm getting one free for my work.

2275
02:39:31,111 --> 02:39:31,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

2276
02:39:32,472 --> 02:39:33,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Must be nice.

2277
02:39:33,112 --> 02:39:35,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it GTA in the Wild West?

2278
02:39:35,675 --> 02:39:36,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's basically what I want.

2279
02:39:36,936 --> 02:39:37,957
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all it needs to be for me.

2280
02:39:38,391 --> 02:40:04,137
[SPEAKER_03]: um yeah it pretty much I mean it doesn't play exactly like the GTA but I mean there's a lot of similarities and I mean it's not as um like intense as GTA I mean there's a lot I mean it's more open world but there's not as much in the open world because obviously it's the wild west not like a bustling city but it's awesome and it looks like graphics wise it's way better than GTA so it's pretty amazing I remember GTA was like wow look at that I can look across the the

2281
02:40:04,757 --> 02:40:05,197
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of creepy.

2282
02:40:05,217 --> 02:40:07,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I mean, in a good way, but that's... Wow, games are too realistic.

2283
02:40:35,772 --> 02:40:37,573
[SPEAKER_01]: I've taken up enough of your time.

2284
02:40:37,793 --> 02:40:38,814
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have a good night.

2285
02:40:38,994 --> 02:40:39,555
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the show.

2286
02:40:39,775 --> 02:40:40,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Great show.

2287
02:40:40,195 --> 02:40:40,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it up.

2288
02:40:40,615 --> 02:40:41,276
[SPEAKER_02]: We love the call.

2289
02:40:41,336 --> 02:40:41,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one.

2290
02:40:41,836 --> 02:40:42,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good night, buddy.

2291
02:40:43,759 --> 02:40:45,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, some good calls tonight.

2292
02:40:46,662 --> 02:40:49,445
[SPEAKER_02]: 1877gameOLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2293
02:40:50,006 --> 02:40:54,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft in our chatroom says, I want a free copy of 3D.gameheroes.

2294
02:40:54,871 --> 02:40:58,815
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I like that last caller's comparison to LEGO Zelda.

2295
02:40:58,975 --> 02:41:00,116
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was a great comparison.

2296
02:41:00,156 --> 02:41:00,657
[SPEAKER_02]: That was funny.

2297
02:41:01,097 --> 02:41:05,582
[SPEAKER_02]: And Donovan in chat says, actually, LEGO Zelda sounds like it could be fun, especially with the LEGO game sense of humor.

2298
02:41:06,222 --> 02:41:06,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I...

2299
02:41:06,943 --> 02:41:28,429
[SPEAKER_02]: that comment actually kind of I think hits the nail on the head it's it's pretty pretty accurate let's see Donovan says hmm Lego wow just as fun of a joke game says the guy who's all tabbing out of wow to type in here addict Jamie you make friends with a lot of wow addicts I gotta say I know what's up with that more people playing Star Trek online with me

2300
02:41:29,201 --> 02:41:29,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have the card.

2301
02:41:29,943 --> 02:41:35,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to use it at some point, but probably after Memorial Day, because if I use it now, I've got too many trips coming up.

2302
02:41:35,436 --> 02:41:39,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going on two weekend trips back to back, so I've got to calm down.

2303
02:41:40,751 --> 02:42:02,200
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually spend time playing the game And then I got E3 coming up too I gotta worry about that I'm gonna be gone a week for that Good times OLR at E3 We don't know what we're doing yet But we'll have Unfortunately it won't be Loki and DarkSakura So we won't unfortunately be able to bring you something collectively Unless maybe there's like some type of I don't know Maybe we'll do something over Skype

2304
02:42:02,620 --> 02:42:08,586
[SPEAKER_02]: because, you know, Loki and DarkSakura will probably be able to follow the news almost better online than I will be being at the show.

2305
02:42:08,646 --> 02:42:10,989
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are going to hopefully bring you some cool interviews at the show.

2306
02:42:11,029 --> 02:42:12,770
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that is the idea.

2307
02:42:13,431 --> 02:42:17,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, do you have any other last-minute stories over there that we can get to while we wait for some more calls?

2308
02:42:19,669 --> 02:42:41,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, this kind of actually ties in a little bit with the last story we were talking about, Inappropriate Games, and of course, you know, leading the market of Inappropriate Games would be Japan, and developer T-Time is bringing new technology into the adult anime game franchise.

2309
02:42:42,685 --> 02:43:04,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Including, they have the face tracking TCAM technology Well now, they're working on hand tracking as well So you'll be able to use Natal-like accuracy to lift skirts and rip off shirts of anime women And they have some demo videos displaying such Unappropriate!

2310
02:43:06,098 --> 02:43:07,599
[SPEAKER_02]: But funny Funny, yes

2311
02:43:10,117 --> 02:43:10,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Good stuff.

2312
02:43:10,557 --> 02:43:11,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else for us tonight?

2313
02:43:12,138 --> 02:43:13,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Ape Escape's coming to the PS3.

2314
02:43:14,060 --> 02:43:14,560
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of neat.

2315
02:43:16,902 --> 02:43:22,105
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is kind of disappointing, I guess, but, you know, nowadays we have the internet.

2316
02:43:22,966 --> 02:43:27,329
[SPEAKER_03]: The Nintendo PowerLine is going to be disconnected on June 1st.

2317
02:43:27,469 --> 02:43:28,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck, that was still open?

2318
02:43:29,670 --> 02:43:30,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2319
02:43:30,211 --> 02:43:31,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the game counselors?

2320
02:43:31,612 --> 02:43:32,232
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is.

2321
02:43:32,312 --> 02:43:33,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit.

2322
02:43:34,887 --> 02:43:36,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to hear, though, that they'll be out of jobs.

2323
02:43:36,749 --> 02:43:37,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that kind of sucks.

2324
02:43:37,970 --> 02:43:41,633
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest, I didn't know you still existed.

2325
02:43:41,733 --> 02:43:42,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

2326
02:43:43,615 --> 02:43:47,218
[SPEAKER_02]: It was probably just one guy with his feet up on the desk not getting called.

2327
02:43:47,238 --> 02:43:50,260
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Loki eating his sandwich.

2328
02:43:51,421 --> 02:43:52,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I do that.

2329
02:43:52,102 --> 02:43:53,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Waiting for the call to come in.

2330
02:43:53,463 --> 02:43:54,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I do that at work.

2331
02:43:55,585 --> 02:43:59,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, if I eat the sandwich at my desk before I go to lunch, that's more time to play Grand Theft Auto.

2332
02:44:00,049 --> 02:44:00,509
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

2333
02:44:03,832 --> 02:44:05,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else for us tonight, Loki?

2334
02:44:05,954 --> 02:44:07,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Or DarkSakura, I don't know.

2335
02:44:08,096 --> 02:44:09,797
[SPEAKER_02]: You got anything?

2336
02:44:10,338 --> 02:44:12,059
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm debating doing something really addict-y.

2337
02:44:13,480 --> 02:44:15,402
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as it's not reactivating your WoW account?

2338
02:44:15,722 --> 02:44:21,287
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm considering finding a cheap digital download key for Star Trek Online so that I can play a joint drill.

2339
02:44:22,528 --> 02:44:24,129
[SPEAKER_02]: That is pretty addict-y.

2340
02:44:24,149 --> 02:44:25,150
[SPEAKER_05]: But I get another 30 free days.

2341
02:44:25,591 --> 02:44:26,511
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's get to another call.

2342
02:44:26,551 --> 02:44:27,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2343
02:44:27,472 --> 02:44:27,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2344
02:44:28,550 --> 02:44:29,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this is X-Link.

2345
02:44:29,911 --> 02:44:31,332
[SPEAKER_02]: X-Link, what's on your mind, buddy?

2346
02:44:32,653 --> 02:44:37,656
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing much, I was just talking about the EA, about charging the extra 10 bucks for the sports games.

2347
02:44:37,817 --> 02:44:39,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm surprised more people didn't want to talk about this.

2348
02:44:39,898 --> 02:44:40,839
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts on this?

2349
02:44:41,079 --> 02:44:44,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I do, because I love playing the sports games from EA.

2350
02:44:44,421 --> 02:44:51,146
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I like playing all of them from time to time, because it's a good way to calm down after having a bad day at work.

2351
02:44:51,646 --> 02:44:53,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially with something like Tiger Woods or something.

2352
02:44:53,728 --> 02:44:55,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Though I don't condone what Tiger Woods did, but...

2353
02:44:57,090 --> 02:44:59,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiger Woods with Grand Theft Auto

2354
02:45:16,809 --> 02:45:19,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Double Dribble I will totally buy NBA Jam when it comes out too

2355
02:45:43,809 --> 02:45:44,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom Shakalaka!

2356
02:45:44,810 --> 02:45:45,291
[SPEAKER_02]: I will too.

2357
02:45:45,511 --> 02:45:46,633
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be a great game.

2358
02:45:46,673 --> 02:45:49,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so yes, so the sports games.

2359
02:45:49,697 --> 02:45:50,298
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think?

2360
02:45:50,338 --> 02:45:51,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you pissed?

2361
02:45:51,119 --> 02:45:52,020
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't play a bucket.

2362
02:45:52,320 --> 02:45:52,821
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it justified?

2363
02:45:52,841 --> 02:45:56,506
[SPEAKER_00]: No, seriously, I don't go online that much and play online.

2364
02:45:56,726 --> 02:46:00,111
[SPEAKER_00]: If I did, I could see maybe paying the $10, but personally I could give $2.

2365
02:46:01,226 --> 02:46:30,695
[SPEAKER_00]: you know two shits about it because I don't really play it online that much if I did I'd play it once in a blue moon so I mean I'm more playing it just for like the season stuff for myself and see how well I can do on the teams than I do playing online against other people that I mostly probably end up cheating anyway so but 10 bucks doesn't really seem that much compared to so like somebody said earlier about you know SOCOM and it being 20 bucks I mean you know it could be a lot worse I mean

2366
02:46:32,773 --> 02:46:36,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess my worry is that if this works, it's only going to get worse.

2367
02:46:36,955 --> 02:46:37,655
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my worry.

2368
02:46:37,695 --> 02:46:39,616
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get worse no matter what.

2369
02:46:39,977 --> 02:46:41,317
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to think about it in the long run.

2370
02:46:41,377 --> 02:46:43,398
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to nickel-dime us no matter what.

2371
02:46:43,418 --> 02:46:53,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it be downloadable content, whether it be online play, whether it be flying unicorns, it's going to always be something.

2372
02:46:54,044 --> 02:46:54,265
[SPEAKER_00]: So...

2373
02:46:55,305 --> 02:47:04,850
[SPEAKER_00]: But I look at it as if I give them $10, they better have the servers running, they better do it good, and they better have it so I can connect to people without any lag or anything like that.

2374
02:47:04,970 --> 02:47:09,013
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, as long as they can do that kind of stuff, I really don't see any kind of problems.

2375
02:47:09,133 --> 02:47:10,774
[SPEAKER_03]: But they probably won't.

2376
02:47:11,554 --> 02:47:14,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're not going to change their service just because they're charging an extra $10.

2377
02:47:14,375 --> 02:47:27,059
[SPEAKER_03]: See, the problem is they have all this download content that was out there in all these different ways that they were offering extra add-ons, whether it be buying cheats or buying extra crap that you probably don't need for your sports games.

2378
02:47:27,379 --> 02:47:32,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that maybe wasn't working so well, so now they're making you buy multiplayer online if you...

2379
02:47:35,761 --> 02:47:42,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Purchase the game used so that way they're getting some money for that used purchase versus no money.

2380
02:47:42,685 --> 02:47:45,326
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really don't think they should be getting money for used purchase.

2381
02:47:45,786 --> 02:47:51,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Nowhere else in the industry, any industry, do people get money for a used purchase.

2382
02:47:52,249 --> 02:47:56,491
[SPEAKER_03]: If I buy a used car, I don't have to pay money to the manufacturer because they didn't sell me a new car.

2383
02:47:56,791 --> 02:47:57,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Too fucking bad.

2384
02:47:59,096 --> 02:48:00,457
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I totally agree on that.

2385
02:48:00,617 --> 02:48:04,158
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to give other people in our companies reason to do other stuff, too.

2386
02:48:04,198 --> 02:48:05,839
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could get out of control big time.

2387
02:48:05,879 --> 02:48:13,542
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if I wanted to coach and play online real bad, too, I might even look on eBay or something, try to find a code on there that somebody's willing to sell.

2388
02:48:13,602 --> 02:48:16,603
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody goes, you know, buys the game going, you know what, I'm not going to use it online.

2389
02:48:16,743 --> 02:48:17,523
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to sell it.

2390
02:48:17,643 --> 02:48:19,284
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't see why they couldn't do that.

2391
02:48:19,444 --> 02:48:21,825
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I see that all the time with other downloadable stuff, so.

2392
02:48:22,065 --> 02:48:22,785
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good point.

2393
02:48:22,846 --> 02:48:27,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, maybe somebody doesn't really want to play online or doesn't really have the whole hookup to be able to play online.

2394
02:48:27,448 --> 02:48:35,473
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're just like, hey, I'm just going to sell this code, make a quick $10 or $7, recoup some of the money, and then between that and selling the game used in the first place, make a little more money.

2395
02:48:35,553 --> 02:48:36,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, why not?

2396
02:48:36,494 --> 02:48:37,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, precisely.

2397
02:48:37,355 --> 02:48:37,635
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2398
02:48:37,995 --> 02:48:40,877
[SPEAKER_02]: XLeague, we've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for your call.

2399
02:48:41,677 --> 02:48:41,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime.

2400
02:48:42,057 --> 02:48:42,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2401
02:48:42,658 --> 02:48:44,179
[SPEAKER_02]: And good luck on hitting 80 this week.

2402
02:48:45,023 --> 02:48:47,106
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm almost at 79 right now as we speak, so.

2403
02:48:47,547 --> 02:48:47,887
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

2404
02:48:48,067 --> 02:48:48,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

2405
02:48:48,428 --> 02:48:50,631
[SPEAKER_02]: From one addict to another, good luck.

2406
02:48:51,352 --> 02:48:51,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you.

2407
02:48:51,973 --> 02:48:52,373
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

2408
02:48:53,395 --> 02:48:53,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel kind of bad.

2409
02:48:54,015 --> 02:48:56,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I kind of got X-Link hooked on that game.

2410
02:48:56,258 --> 02:48:59,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I feel like, thank God I don't have to pay like, you know, pay like...

2411
02:49:03,149 --> 02:49:03,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Boo Boo

2412
02:49:25,151 --> 02:49:25,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be sad.

2413
02:49:26,252 --> 02:49:28,154
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be another OLR next week.

2414
02:49:28,454 --> 02:49:29,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I've got a final thought for you, Rob.

2415
02:49:30,015 --> 02:49:30,175
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

2416
02:49:30,435 --> 02:49:35,139
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a final thought for you.

2417
02:49:41,445 --> 02:49:42,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, do you have a final thought?

2418
02:49:43,607 --> 02:49:47,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to see what animals or other animals I can skin in Red Dead Redemption.

2419
02:49:47,650 --> 02:49:49,291
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too bad that you can't skin a human.

2420
02:49:49,311 --> 02:49:51,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, human skin does not sell for much.

2421
02:49:51,874 --> 02:49:52,814
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be Mortal Kombat.

2422
02:49:55,163 --> 02:49:57,524
[SPEAKER_02]: And my final thought is, it is getting hot in here.

2423
02:49:58,445 --> 02:50:02,288
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to run errands on my way home tonight from the show.

2424
02:50:03,069 --> 02:50:06,372
[SPEAKER_05]: I just shut the door because I turned on the air again, but Dan's playing something loud.

2425
02:50:06,392 --> 02:50:06,952
[SPEAKER_02]: It's alright.

2426
02:50:07,052 --> 02:50:07,512
[SPEAKER_02]: We're almost done.

2427
02:50:07,532 --> 02:50:07,813
[SPEAKER_02]: We're done.

2428
02:50:07,833 --> 02:50:08,333
[SPEAKER_02]: We're out of here.

2429
02:50:08,373 --> 02:50:09,074
[SPEAKER_02]: He can play loud games.

2430
02:50:09,374 --> 02:50:09,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's it.

2431
02:50:10,075 --> 02:50:14,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting Independent Radio, whether it be you're listening live or you're listening on the podcast.

2432
02:50:15,159 --> 02:50:18,081
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are awesome, and we really appreciate the support.

2433
02:50:18,121 --> 02:50:18,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know what?

2434
02:50:18,782 --> 02:50:19,522
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not the G4...

2435
02:50:20,683 --> 02:50:21,023
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

2436
02:50:43,792 --> 02:50:45,414
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole planet will be listening.

2437
02:50:45,494 --> 02:50:46,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Mwahaha, world domination.

2438
02:50:46,876 --> 02:50:48,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, then again, it's been eight years and hasn't worked yet.

2439
02:50:48,998 --> 02:50:50,640
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, we're getting a step closer every week.

2440
02:50:51,020 --> 02:50:54,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys so much and we'll be back to do it all again next week.

2441
02:50:54,665 --> 02:50:55,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Sound good?

2442
02:50:55,986 --> 02:50:56,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2443
02:50:56,306 --> 02:50:56,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

2444
02:50:56,747 --> 02:50:59,630
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you next week with more Orange Lounge Radio.

2445
02:50:59,730 --> 02:51:00,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night.

2446
02:51:01,252 --> 02:51:01,792
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next week!

2447
02:51:32,527 --> 02:51:33,570
Thanks for watching!
