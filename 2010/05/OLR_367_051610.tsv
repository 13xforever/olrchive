13936	24222	Tonight, May 16th, 2010, EA gets set to sell a controversial new online pass, more details are forming on Mega Man Online, and Steam gives away a game totally free.
31519	41561	Hello, my friends, and welcome to episode number 367 of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.
41982	45802	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.
46303	50104	First on up, the one, the only, the fabulous DarkSakura.
50364	52044	Here's my impression of Rob earlier.
52184	52384	What?
52844	54144	What episode number is this?
57465	58026	Okay, no.
58746	62868	Okay, before we went on air, because, you know, I wanted to have the episode number down.
62888	65068	Because I lost count, like, three years ago.
66109	66629	Longer than that.
66669	68070	You know I have to give you a hard time.
68310	70010	So I said, what episode number are we on?
70050	71291	Just kind of like a rhetorical question.
71311	72571	Like, I'm actually going to look it up.
72611	74492	Like, I don't expect DarkSakura or Loki to know it.
75212	76573	And Jamie in the background, she's all, 69.
76973	79074	I said 50 million.
79214	79534	Oh, did you?
79554	79914	I thought you said 69.
79974	80955	You said 69.
81035	81595	I thought you said 69.
81715	83476	I totally thought she said 69, too.
84776	85737	Is it 50 million?
87378	89259	Alright, so it's episode number 69 of Orange.
89339	90680	Actually, in two weeks.
91160	93261	No, three weeks, because there's not going to be a show in a couple weeks.
93701	97143	But the show after Labor Day will be episode number 369.
97584	99084	Brought to you by the multiples of three.
99164	99705	That's right.
100365	101565	Oh, that is weird.
101685	103686	Three, six, nine.
103746	104226	All right, anyhow.
105267	108708	Also, the other voice you hear over there, the one and only Techmaster Loki.
108948	109308	Hello.
109388	112589	Whose favorite game, by the way, is that Rainbow Unicorn game.
113029	114749	It is not.
114789	117030	That's all you ever play on this program is Rainbow Unicorn.
117370	119111	That's not what I play.
119331	128175	I played the Werewolf Ice Cream Man one not too long ago, and I played the Mario Crossover game the other week.
129196	132257	I just didn't have the link for the Mario Crossover game because I was going to play that.
132457	136499	That was actually pretty awesome with the Contra guys blowing up all the blocks, I've got to say.
136519	142042	I do have the link to the Unicorn game, but that's about all I have right now.
142625	153731	All right, also joining us tonight, you guys in our chat room, because we do tape live every week at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com at 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
153931	160955	If you are listening to us live, please pull up a chair and join us in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
161435	164197	We're going to move into a little bit of how was your gaming week.
164237	165598	That's how we always start off the show.
165998	167979	First off, Dark Sakura, I understand.
168699	169620	School's out for summer.
170100	171901	Yay!
172001	173542	I'm going to school in the summer.
173822	174683	Oh, never mind then.
174763	176724	But I may get to skip pre-algebra.
177825	182208	Because for some reason, ARC's website just let me sign up for algebra in the fall.
183228	186310	And I was going to do the self-study thing in the summer.
186750	188712	Because it's freaking pre-algebra.
188732	189432	So whatever.
190553	192314	So I may only be taking history this summer.
192334	197437	But that means I graduate in the fall with my...
199378	199858	My AA.
200279	200879	My eh.
201259	202280	Your Alcoholics Anonymous.
202320	202820	Good job.
202840	202880	Eh.
203181	204281	Alright, eh.
204442	206863	So now you'll actually have time to actually play games again.
206903	207384	It'll be great.
207764	208704	I've been playing games though.
208724	209945	Alright, well tell us a little bit about you.
210005	221773	Even though I've had like my final projects and crap due, I played, well I downloaded something for free that we'll be talking about later because everybody freaking downloaded it.
222834	224515	I was having to wait in the damn queue.
225195	230117	And then I played that stupid gay ass unicorn game.
230797	231838	Excuse you.
232718	233779	No, that's what it's called.
233919	234199	Oh, okay.
234499	239621	Well, you have to have the ass to make your unicorn be extra gay or something.
239721	240321	I don't know.
240802	241862	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
241882	244043	You're not talking about... No, the one on Steam.
244143	246404	Oh, you played the pink anus game.
246624	248425	Anus, that was it.
248445	254388	I was thinking of the candy called Magic Stone or Legend of Magic Stone or something.
254988	259810	I got as far as looking in the stable and I was like, this is crap and turned it off.
260370	261471	It's also very Ingress-y.
263792	268834	Who haven't heard the past few episodes, there's a game on Steam, and it was Alan that brought it to our attention.
270234	280697	It's something about a mystical unicorn or whatever, and you see in the screenshots, there's a crafting screen or something, and one of the materials you use is A-E-N-U-S.
280777	282458	It's anus, but it's pink.
282838	285859	So it's the magical unicorn with pink anus game.
287339	290340	and DarkSakura bought it because she's a consumer whore.
290620	291060	And how.
291520	298661	But no, like, I tried to, it's really like a click and drag type stuff to use things and I was like, this is like a big bad flash game.
300142	301662	You can groom his hooves.
302822	308143	And he was a little cult when you first got him and now he's a golden unicorn with sparklies falling out of his butt.
309724	310564	At least that's what it looked like.
310604	313184	I put up a screen capture somewhere, I think, on my Twitter or something.
313224	315465	You make everybody want to play this game very badly.
315925	316806	Here's my review.
317346	320228	Pink sparkles out of a unicorn's anus.
320589	321910	It's anus.
323371	324291	A-E-N-U-S.
324652	325012	Anus.
325572	327334	My anus is bleeding.
328755	341164	Or would it be... It would be emus, because then you... Anyway, and then... No, you can't have it, because you can't spell your...
341946	346608	Max Payne meets Silent Hill The End
368756	369677	It's actually not that bad.
370897	374839	And then, um... Oh god, we played some other stuff too.
375179	376500	Oh yeah, I went to Pentagogo!
377780	378781	So I played pinball.
379855	380876	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
406497	408219	The Pink Honest I'm allergic to the town of Dixon
428624	429404	No, seriously.
430425	432626	No, I'm being absolutely serious.
433286	438048	Every time I've been to Dixon, I end up getting some type of weird heat stroke.
438468	442010	My allergies get, like, you know how allergic I am to dogs?
442670	443690	It gets that bad.
443890	444391	I swear.
445151	456055	I took two doses of Benadryl, Sudafed, and Zyrtec, and I was taking local honey and giving myself shots, and you name it for allergies I was doing.
456095	456996	I was snorting crap.
458417	466003	I was still like super, you know, eye drops, my eyeballs were floating and it was just like not, it was not beautiful.
466224	472409	I felt like that my eyeballs were the size of like double the size of my head.
472990	476172	And so I went and sat in the car, texted Dan.
476393	476933	I'm sick.
476973	479375	I kept hiding in the bathroom because it was in a place with air conditioning.
480496	486700	and playing Final Fantasy 2 sitting on the floor of the bathroom at the Dixon Mayfair.
486880	487761	Sounds like fun.
488381	495125	Sounds like the sophistication being sucked right out of you and that's why you're having all those complications and stuff.
495926	497347	Sorry, you're too sophisticated for here.
499426	501007	So do you want to go home?
522677	524638	Yes.
525318	532662	And not to say anything bad about the Pentagogo, because it's a great event.
533463	540447	But if you have hay fever, if you've got allergies to nature, to grass, don't go unless you bring your own plastic bubble.
541107	545689	And then it makes the plastic bubbles, you really can't play pinball very well in them, so I just totally wouldn't, you know.
546330	551132	I would say a gas mask could work, you could actually play with a gas mask on, that would work.
551692	559156	But as far as what I played, I played Back to the Future, and I played Revenge for Mars, which was one of the Pinball 2000.
559196	560957	And I played F14 Tomcat.
566520	571669	I was going for mostly the mid-80s to early 90s era of pinball.
571789	573292	You know, just kind of get into it.
573673	574474	And I played this 80s...
576912	580615	Well, I was going to say, speaking of that, I played a pinball machine called Punk.
581656	588140	And it had like the, you know, looked like pictures from, what was that movie with Nicolas Cage and Valley Girl.
589181	595266	You know, and all the guys on the play field looked like Duran Duran.
595466	596266	And it was kind of funny.
596987	598808	Even though they weren't very punk, they had that hair though.
599829	600429	And eyeliner.
602151	604973	And that one was actually pretty fun for an old school, you know,
607307	607988	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
634827	646451	My other thing, and I know I'm going off on this, is I was actually so caught up, because me being the big design freaking nerd that I am, I was going around taking pictures of interesting design.
647091	651573	Of cool pictures and neat early 80s, late 70s style art.
653153	655474	So I'll put some of the pictures up, they're on my phone.
655934	657334	Yeah, you're a nerd, yeah.
657734	659835	But I did play other games.
660255	661195	Hmm.
661675	663395	Well, I said I played Final Fantasy II, didn't I?
663735	666516	Yes, while you're on the bathroom floor crying and sobbing because of your allergies.
667056	667996	I wasn't crying.
669937	672257	And, yeah, I played some Star Trek Online.
672997	673217	Fun.
673997	675878	I think that's... No, I'm sure I played something else.
676798	683079	Oh, yeah, I started playing Braid, and then I kind of remembered that I had to do other things like homework.
684753	686334	I'm done with my finals.
686354	687194	I love how you sum it up.
687734	690835	I started to play this game, but then I was like, oh, God, I have something better to do.
691175	691555	Bye.
692096	693836	No, it wasn't I have something better to do.
694276	696077	It was something responsible to do.
696097	696477	Oh, sorry.
696917	697337	Rob.
697377	698438	Screw that growing up.
699098	699358	All right.
699378	701659	See, you're Rob-ba, and our other one is Rob-ba-ba.
701739	701979	I know.
702199	702399	I know.
702779	703059	All right.
703379	713583	Loki, I don't know if you can top Dark Sakura's adventures in Dixon, Pinball, and Final Fantasy II on the bathroom floor while she's trying to recover from allergies, but you want to try it?
714923	715864	I didn't go to Dixon.
716464	717884	That's already an improvement right there.
719645	720225	Let's see.
720465	727127	I played a lot of things that have yet to come out, including APB.
727487	730368	I've been playing the beta of that, and I love it because it's just like...
731508	736670	To me, it's like crossing Saints Row with Free Mode and Grand Theft Auto 4.
737171	739272	You kind of do what you need to do.
739312	740332	You have different missions.
740352	746455	The first few missions in the tutorial portion of the game, they have you go...
747555	750798	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
768734	769795	and people online as well.
770235	775179	So you can play both the villains and kind of the heroes, I guess, in the game.
775479	778821	I'm playing, of course, as one of the gangbangers because that's fun.
780442	783264	Lots of customization in the character creator.
783304	786406	It's just nuts how much customization is in there.
787227	789288	The clothing, though, you don't really have a lot of options.
789348	794372	At first you have to kind of buy that stuff or unlock it later on when you finish different missions.
794412	795613	Same with cars and whatnot.
797074	798175	But I'm really digging it.
798215	802878	I'm kind of thinking I might go back to that as an MMO, but we'll see.
803358	810223	I kind of like the fact, though, that the way they have their pay scale for it, it's basically you pay as you go.
810783	825773	So for someone like me that doesn't necessarily get a lot of time to dedicate to MMOs or stuff like that, it wouldn't be so bad because the time I'm not playing it, I'm not actually losing out on anything because you pay for the hours that you want to use.
826514	827755	So, it sounds good to me.
828095	830318	I may try it.
830378	833020	I have to upgrade my computer, though, too.
834161	834762	It might be a little bit.
835963	836724	Other fun stuff.
837044	843311	I happened to get a copy of Red Dead Redemption a little early, so I've been playing that, and I love the game.
844092	846734	Not a big surprise, because it's a little bit like Grand Theft Auto, but...
848376	851397	For me, a lot of it's been like Oregon Trail Extreme.
851757	852258	Nice.
854079	856620	Specifically, the hunting portion of Oregon Trail.
857000	859181	Because in the game, you make money by it.
859322	863784	You can hunt stuff and skin them and take the meat and the skins or whatever.
864004	865945	But you could only carry 100 pounds back to the wagon?
866025	866365	Oh, no.
866786	868106	I was able to kill a lot of things.
868426	872729	I don't know about 100 pounds worth of skins, but did you know in that game you can skin a horse?
874494	875315	I did not know that.
899135	901657	and then I saw Onward Ills running around and I shot them.
901677	905420	This just in, breaking news, this just in, PETA hates Red Dead Redemption.
905500	906320	Oh, I'm sure they will.
906340	910683	You can kill all sorts of creatures out there.
910923	914086	Haven't found the bears yet though, but it's really cool.
914186	924373	And the fact that the game looks a lot better than Grand Theft Auto, I mean, just a few years and the amount of improvements in the engine, it's just, it's amazing.
924973	926094	Definitely worth picking up though.
926534	927314	I love the game.
927354	927694	It's awesome.
952423	953743	Yeah, I was playing the demo.
953763	960085	I mean, I'm not cool like you and can get all these early games because you're like in the know or whatever.
960585	966527	But I was playing the split-second demo myself, and yeah, it was as fun as I remember at E3.
966607	971849	Like, it was still the same game that was probably, funny enough, probably my game of show last E3.
971949	977110	I mean, last E3 was not a huge year for me, but that was probably the best thing I played at the show.
977270	979771	So I'm excited that game is finally coming out, like, Tuesday, right?
979791	979871	Yeah.
980391	988277	Yeah, and I'm looking forward to actually being able to... I'm going to try some of the multiplayer in Red Dead when it does come out because they do have a lot of neat multiplayer options in there.
988718	993982	But at the same time, I'm also working on doing another edited modded Grand Theft Auto game.
994282	1004009	I'm trying to edit the maps now, but there's specific rules you have to follow as far as getting stuff to work and stuff that normally works on the PC version doesn't work in the console version and whatnot.
1004549	1004690	But...
1006573	1006813	Yeah.
1006973	1008274	Oh, yeah.
1008434	1012997	I got to play some of the listeners during this week's Grand Theft Auto games.
1013017	1013617	Oh, finally.
1014137	1015618	Some listeners took you up on the challenge, hey?
1015678	1015878	Yes.
1016359	1016879	That was fun.
1017379	1018700	Good times.
1020101	1021401	And then, of course, just more Grand Theft Auto.
1021421	1023342	I've been playing a lot of that.
1024803	1027885	I think that's really... Did you school the listeners, or did they school you?
1028605	1029166	No, I schooled them.
1029286	1030426	I school everybody I play.
1030546	1030927	All right.
1032216	1032936	Thanks for watching!
1051307	1059413	But no, I'm actually ranked 67 now, so I'm going up there, trying to make as close to number one as possible.
1059473	1061034	Moving on up, moving on up.
1061495	1062756	Alright, congratulations.
1062816	1068460	Hey, this is episode 367 of OLR, and you're number 67 on Grand Theft Auto.
1068480	1069261	Hey, how about that?
1070041	1073562	I did pick up 3D.GameHeroes, but I haven't played it yet.
1073682	1076622	Then we'll move to my gaming week, because I did play 3D.GameHeroes.
1076702	1077603	I picked that up as well.
1077983	1081043	I was kind of motivated by the price point of just $40.
1081103	1082064	It kind of seemed like a bargain to me.
1082484	1085424	So I decided to pick up the game, and I didn't know much about the game.
1085584	1087045	Here's how clueless I was about the game.
1087165	1091706	I thought it was kind of like a game editor type of game where you would get to make your own little adventure games.
1092926	1094386	No, that's not what it is.
1094486	1098107	So let's take a step back and talk about what 3D.GameHeroes actually is.
1098647	1101988	It's basically a gigantic ripoff of The Legend of Zelda.
1102708	1104048	But that's cool, you know?
1104148	1106409	Like, The Legend of Zelda was a great game.
1107349	1112251	It's kind of fascinating that they're getting away with it, but hey, if Nintendo's not going to do anything, why not?
1112851	1120373	Now, you know, when I say ripoff, you know, there's some clear parody going on here, and they've changed just enough so it's not really a ripoff of Zelda.
1120413	1122573	Like, for example, you don't have hearts.
1123073	1124254	You have apples.
1124274	1125394	What?
1125914	1127775	Kidneys, that'd be funny.
1127935	1135357	Well, that's I guess maybe the core part of the customization of 3D.GameHeroes is that your hero can be anything you want.
1135717	1138238	You actually have a mode where you can go in and edit.
1139039	1146601	The default guy, I guess you could say the person in slot number one in the character edit mode looks like the dude from Dragon Warrior.
1146941	1151363	I don't know what you're supposed to... I'm 12, so I give all my characters three-year-old names.
1151503	1154444	I name my character Vulva, so I don't know what the normal...
1154904	1156806	The character name is... Shut up.
1158448	1159669	Alan and I picked out a good name.
1161671	1162572	Save us, Vulva.
1162652	1163133	Save us.
1163774	1164434	Evil Empire.
1166777	1169800	So, yeah, I don't remember what his name is, usually.
1170461	1173063	Somebody in chat will probably yell it out, but whatever.
1173103	1174325	It doesn't matter what his name is.
1174405	1174825	The game...
1175834	1184096	The game is like this giant love letter from guys our age, but in Japan, because I know it was developed over there, who kind of miss what gaming used to be.
1184176	1197681	I mean, if you think about the concept of this game, this story, is that there's this 2D world where everybody stopped visiting it, and it got old because, you know, just people didn't care about it anymore.
1197781	1201762	So their big idea was to go 3D to change the world.
1201822	1202242	I mean, that...
1202822	1210926	There's kind of like this really hidden bitter subtext there about how everything is 3D in this day and age and why can't our games be 2D anymore.
1211887	1214968	And it's just loaded with references to old 8-bit games.
1215089	1218390	Mostly Zelda, but there's other stuff in there as well that's really funny.
1219111	1228215	Including more current games because from Software, the developer, they made this other great PlayStation 3 game that came out a little while ago called Demon's Souls.
1228736	1230877	And there's actually this room in the game where...
1231437	1235260	If you walk in the right spot, it says, there's a message on the ground here.
1235981	1236481	Something like that.
1236521	1238242	It says, do you want to recommend this message?
1238262	1241004	And if you hit yes, it says, somewhere someone got healed.
1241485	1244027	That's funny if you've played Demon's Souls.
1244167	1246489	If you haven't, it makes no fucking sense.
1246529	1248490	You're just like, what is this randomness?
1248630	1249751	But whatever.
1249851	1255155	But then there's a chick right next to it and you find white sticky stuff in front of her, which is also a Demon's Souls reference.
1255476	1260940	But it sounds like porno, which is really funny because there's a lot of parts in this game
1261320	1262200	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1291155	1292296	The game has flaws.
1292496	1293457	Yes, it has flaws.
1293758	1299863	There's slowdown in some of the dungeons because the water effect that they do in the game is so over the top.
1300184	1302426	And there's a lot in this game that's really over the top.
1302506	1308151	Like, oh, I don't know, the size of your sword when you have a full health bar takes up the entire screen.
1308531	1309632	So as long as you don't get it.
1309652	1313296	Listening to Bobby talking about it, I was making all kinds of inappropriate jokes.
1314236	1315277	Oh, it's funny.
1315337	1316317	It's really over the top.
1316357	1318218	There's a lot that's very over the top about this game.
1319579	1323300	And they decide, for whatever reason, to do the water effects really over the top.
1323980	1327002	And it causes slowdown in one of the dungeons.
1327122	1330923	And it's like, okay, folks, this is the PlayStation 3.
1332704	1335705	The government bought PlayStation 3s to use their cell processing.
1335745	1337326	Where's your cell processor now?
1337486	1338266	Exactly.
1338766	1339867	It's like, this game...
1341184	1363269	And to be honest, there's really nothing about 3D.GameHeroes that deserves to be on the PlayStation 3 This game could have been on the PS2 I mean, yes, it has trophies and yes, it's widescreen But I think there were a handful of widescreen games on the PS2 as well And that's really it I mean, graphically, you're not getting that much more oomph on the PS3
1364329	1372031	But I'm okay with it, and they give it a pass, because again, you're charging me about the cost of a PS2 game, you know, 40 bucks.
1372451	1374032	And it's, you know, still a good time.
1374072	1377833	And at the end, you just have to evaluate, did I have fun, yes or no?
1377933	1380173	And I had fun playing the game, despite its flaws.
1380553	1381674	So I wouldn't give the game like an A++.
1382814	1385596	But I'd give it a good solid A- or B+.
1385816	1400147	It's fun, it's silly, especially if you're a gamer in that age bracket, late 20s, early 30s, or even if you're a younger gamer that knows your retro gaming history, then you're going to get a kick out of this and get some lols.
1400467	1419234	and I don't think it made our show role but they have some really cool custom characters you can download off of their 3D.gameheroes hall of heroes website including they have a little arcade game you can play as a little girl Cthulhu chickens
1420987	1422048	Santa Claus Santa Claus Santa Claus
1448789	1449271	You know what?
1450634	1456652	Something just occurred to me that I should do I need to get RPG Maker for PC You should
1457598	1459059	Orange Lodge Radio, The RPG
1488441	1493623	Yeah, I... Again, you know, don't... I'm nitpicking a little bit with 3D.GameHeroes.
1493803	1501865	Overall, if you want to play... Like, if you're sitting there going, gosh, I wish they would make another 2D Zelda game that I could, like, play on my TV, here you go.
1503326	1504806	This game was, like, made for you.
1505026	1505406	Enjoy.
1505787	1506167	Eat it up.
1506427	1507287	Get a big spoon.
1507307	1507507	Eat it up.
1507527	1512389	They have, like, a little Big Planet Sackboy-type thing in there called Ragdoll.
1512409	1514289	It's one of the custom characters that someone made.
1514649	1516170	It looks just like a little pixelated...
1517270	1533776	it's just kind of a bummer that that's like the hero is like the only thing you can change you know what I mean like didn't you weren't you kind of hoping Loki there'd be like a little more just a little more customizability to this I don't know oh well but you know what 40 bucks hard to complain sir duct tape yes someone made a roll duct tape
1534062	1535562	All right, look, other games in my gaming week.
1535942	1540143	I don't want to drag this out too long because we're already almost a half hour into the show and haven't even touched gaming news yet.
1540443	1542683	But I just wanted to say really quick some of the stuff I've been playing.
1542944	1544704	World of Warcraft, of course, because I'm addicted.
1545304	1550225	And play some Game Room this week because, you know, they're back on the ball with getting the releases out.
1550265	1550965	So hooray for that.
1551265	1554766	I think I talked on the show last week about Pitfall and nearly missing the top 20, right?
1555326	1560567	I tried to do like a perfect run of the game and you know what gets me in Pitfall and why I can't do it?
1560687	1562567	It's the scorpions in the Hidden Passage.
1563948	1569455	I have no problem if I just run straight from right to left or run to the left.
1569996	1573380	I can get through 20 minutes running straight and not die once.
1573481	1575163	And that's how I got a score of 85,000.
1575764	1578708	But the minute I have to go into the tunnels, the scorpions eat my face.
1579509	1581071	That's the problem I'm having on Old School Pitfall.
1581311	1581952	Oink, Reverse Breakout
1598689	1600249	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1624335	1631239	Actually, I wouldn't say it's my favorite 2600 game, but I think maybe Kaboom or Pitfall 2 would be my favorite 2600 game.
1631800	1636683	But it's my most underrated, and I think most underappreciated 2600 game.
1637063	1642206	When I can get the cartridge for $1, I'll probably buy it on Game Room anyway.
1642246	1645508	And sure enough, he sends a picture of Oink running on his TV with the Atari 2600 hooked up.
1647689	1648190	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1672540	1675022	You know, does it justify the increased costs?
1675182	1675522	I don't know.
1675682	1678024	It really depends on how much these games mean to you and so forth.
1678624	1682006	There's a lot, and I already did my Game Room tangent a couple weeks ago.
1682026	1683447	I'm trying very hard not to repeat it.
1683788	1688891	There's a lot of potential with Microsoft Game Room, and I really hope that potential is realized.
1689271	1691793	I'm hoping E3 is going to drop a whopper on us.
1692193	1699718	I really want them to come out at that press conference at E3 and go, we're going to release a whopper of a game on Game Room this week, and it's out right now.
1699918	1700339	Go get it.
1700919	1702140	And so I don't know what that game is.
1702900	1730013	but hopefully something really cool like something not from the early early 80s like something I don't know I don't know what game that could be the Galaxian 3 I don't I don't know what it'll be but hopefully something they'll kind of put out and it'll take game room to that next level where it's not just Atari 2600 and old old old old old stuff from the 80s we'll see though I my gut tells me here's here's my bet quote-unquote
1731235	1737981	It's going to be a Capcom game from their Street Fighter 2-ish era when they were using that hardware.
1738441	1741664	So I'm going to play... The CPS 1 and 2?
1741964	1747950	Yeah, I'm going to just guesstimate with nothing to back this up whatsoever because there's already the...
1748630	1750991	Rumors that Capcom games are going to make their way.
1751171	1755132	Like the Mega Man fighting game and some of that stuff is going to make their way to the Rock Battle.
1755873	1759614	Because Capcom supported Ultra K in the past.
1759934	1761675	So there's no reason why they wouldn't jump in on this.
1762195	1766076	I'm going to just speculate original Street Fighter 1.
1766657	1769798	Street Fighter 1 will be the big E3 game room release.
1770738	1779222	I have nothing to base that off of, but half fanboyism, half I've been doing this show for long enough that I feel like I start to understand the patterns of gaming companies.
1780783	1781404	Take it or leave it.
1783205	1787667	And also in Game Room this week, Keystone Capers was released and I played a crap ton of that.
1788327	1790448	Alright, I'll stop talking about my gaming week now.
1790488	1793030	We are officially a half hour into the show and haven't talked about any gaming news.
1793050	1794650	I've been playing a lot of Super Street Fighter 2.
1796155	1811324	I got my ass handed to me in Super Street Fighter 4 this weekend I was playing and I got schooled and it just reminded me what a terrible Street Fighter player I am I was playing Super Street Fighter 2 on my arcade cabinet it was fun
1812062	1820068	Going to our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com I think some folks are speculating what the game could be that's released at E3 for Game Room.
1821049	1823630	SSJ100Matt speculates Oonga Boonga will be the game.
1825092	1826232	Dear Lord, no.
1827073	1831016	Blackwolf, our good pal Bobby Blackwolf says Miss Nude World USA.
1834398	1835019	Oh, I wish.
1836963	1842472	And BlackWolf also says, remember, no online multiplayer in Game Room, so it doesn't make much sense to do a fighting game.
1842812	1849382	Well, to be fair, sir, it really didn't make much sense to put Combat or Outlaw there either then for those same reasons.
1849783	1851325	I mean, Combat is...
1852589	1854990	is pointless if you don't have someone to play it with.
1855050	1857611	And yet you're supposed to invite someone over, they get on the second controller.
1858671	1861052	So you could basically cheat for the high score on that one.
1862332	1865574	Donovan speculates Custer's Revenge will be the big game that's released.
1865614	1868695	You know, I just don't think that's going to happen.
1868735	1871075	A few people in a chat talking about Kangaroo.
1871235	1875137	Actdeft in chat says, if Game Room releases Kangaroo, I'll buy it on release.
1876417	1885727	I do want to warn you though, if they release Kongo Bongo, which I don't know, for some reason Kangaroo makes me think of Donkey Kong, which makes me think of Kongo Bongo, because they were all kind of, you know, trying to one-up each other.
1886367	1889971	Kongo Bongo is on the Sega Genesis Uber collection.
1890371	1896177	Be very careful if Sega games start showing up on Game Room, because a lot of them are on that collection.
1897979	1898600	Don't get swindled.
1900222	1902502	Alright, let's move on to some actual gaming news for heaven's sakes.
1903163	1906243	Housekeeping, join us on Twitter, twitter.com.com.
1906283	1910144	Join us on Facebook, Orange Launch Radio, yadda yadda, blah blah blah, gaming news.
1910264	1910524	Loki.
1912545	1919946	So Activision apparently is taking some lessons that they possibly have learned from lawsuits and whatnot.
1920326	1923307	They are dropping celebrities from the next Guitar Hero game.
1923927	1929348	So you will not see any, you know, dead Kurt Cobain's or whatever singing
1931305	1936429	Well, to be fair, Kurt Cobain was not portrayed as dead in the game because I think if he was, that would have been a whole other issue.
1936449	1937170	That would have been cool.
1937290	1938591	That would have been a whole other issue.
1938951	1940352	You just got, he's on the stage.
1942153	1942594	No head.
1942874	1943755	Zombie Kurt Cobain.
1945196	1953942	So, yeah, so they're basically, their claim is they're going back to the basics and this is coming from the latest issue of the official Xbox magazine.
1955463	1959967	Some of the old Guitar Hero characters, the ones that were actually unique to the game are coming back.
1960667	1968630	and you'll be able to recruit characters by playing their song sets and once you do that you can also unlock their alter egos.
1969550	1978273	So for example Lars would become like Warrior Lars and that will allow you to get a x6 multiplier.
1980474	1983277	Quick Play, I guess, is being revamped.
1984718	1991164	Of course, the DLC from Guitar Hero 5 and before that will be compatible with Guitar Hero 6.
1993126	1998191	They're doing, I guess, Streaker's Momentum, Do or Die are now available in online competitive modes.
1998831	2005678	New Power Challenges, Queen, Kiss, Black Sabbath, they're confirmed to be in the game.
2006178	2010441	I guess Quest Mode will feature Gene Simmons as a narrator because he needs money.
2012722	2013623	Does he have a TV show?
2014304	2015444	Does he get money from that?
2015644	2016805	He's freaking Gene Simmons.
2017426	2019707	All he has to do is go to a freak show and stick out his tongue.
2019727	2020187	You know what though?
2020227	2027973	He was on The Celebrity Apprentice and that's, you know, if you're resorting to going to try to... Joan Rivers was on The Celebrity Apprentice and that's Joan Rivers.
2028013	2029294	Her career's kind of...
2030274	2032437	They claim there's going to be a bigger focus on rock and roll.
2038795	2039095	Right.
2039896	2040857	Focus on rock and roll.
2041518	2045681	Well, I'm glad they're making a bigger focus on rock and roll and not, I don't know, making money.
2046522	2047703	Why do I just have this feeling?
2047723	2056351	Like, I'm not trying to be negative or be a fanboy or whatever, but why do I just have this feeling that E3, we're going to see Rock Band 3, and it's just going to blow this shit out of the water?
2056551	2059013	Like, it's just going to annihilate Guitar Hero.
2059734	2061175	Let me put it this way.
2061696	2061816	Um...
2064073	2066293	I don't really give a crap about it.
2066313	2067754	I mean, look at Guitar Hero 5.
2068114	2072775	What exactly did Guitar Hero 5 do that was that great over Guitar Hero World Tour?
2074115	2074715	Nothing, really.
2075375	2077896	I mean, it was pretty much, hey, look, we have new songs.
2079396	2079756	Yeah?
2080636	2080977	Yeah?
2082437	2084877	How about we throw in Van Halen?
2085417	2086478	Two games for the price of one.
2086518	2092499	Wasn't that the first game with the whole you can do four singers if you want and four guitarists and all that stuff?
2092864	2093726	Wow, that's awesome.
2093947	2095972	We're going to put four drummers in my house.
2095992	2098740	Yeah, because that makes sense.
2099562	2099642	Um...
2102037	2102898	I don't know, it sounds dumb.
2102998	2104459	And this one doesn't sound that great to me.
2104559	2105199	But you know what?
2105379	2108582	I'm kind of biased because I don't really care for the Guitar Hero series, really.
2109302	2112564	Once I had Rock Band 2, it was just like, I don't really care.
2112584	2114025	I've got all these download songs.
2114146	2116047	I don't really need to buy another game.
2116607	2122111	Rock Band 3, I'm going to kind of consider it the same thing unless I see them doing something really unique with it.
2122451	2130417	Although I do have faith in Harmonix that they're going to actually put something out decent that's going to be different enough from the last game.
2130937	2137986	So, props to them for that, but, I mean, look at, like, the Guitar Hero, their song creator and stuff that they had in-game.
2138006	2143412	That was supposed to be, like, this huge feature, and everyone's kind of like, eh, whatever, you know.
2144213	2145434	So, we'll see.
2145595	2150460	I mean, we don't know a lot about it yet, but I'm not expecting much.
2151201	2153704	Just like with DJ Hero 2, I'm not expecting much.
2153924	2154825	New songs, that's about it.
2154845	2161693	Which could be a good thing, because if you set the expectation bar really low, then they have the potential to really overcome that.
2161713	2166438	Whereas I think the expectation bar with Rock Band 3 is really high, at least for me.
2167279	2169001	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2188317	2214418	and it's it you know it's basically like a track pack but there is a lot of songs in the game and you know just like you know Guitar Hero Metallica or Aerosmith or something like that I really don't give a crap about Green Day Rock Band um I guess even the same could have been said about Lego Rock Band yet I purchased anyways although Lego Rock Band had a really good set list so I I did like that but you know I basically dumped the songs in the game and then sold it back so whatever um
2216448	2216968	Project TenDollar
2244175	2247758	Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11 EA Sports Games for PS3 and Xbox 360 Title Specific Online Pass
2259850	2260410	Thank you for watching!
2277455	2304686	of course you get a 7 day free trial so I guess if you rent it from Gamefly you'll at least get that it's going to depend what it is depending on the game you have but EA has mentioned that it will be it could include meaning it probably will include basic online multiplayer that could also include group and league features roster and playbook updates downloads of like the user based stuff tournament support and so forth
2305726	2313311	So that's the direction they're going in where now if you get this game used, you're going to have to pay an extra $10 if you're going to want to enable it online.
2314052	2319855	Not the first time we've really seen something like this ever happen, right?
2319955	2328001	Because there's been other games that have charged the money for extra stuff if you want to redeem the code.
2328041	2329962	But it's interesting now that you're talking about
2330422	2335743	What I think a lot of people have come to take for granted online and that is basic head-to-head online matches.
2336643	2337784	DarkSakura, what do you think?
2339864	2347926	About the whole Project $10 thing where, you know, folks are now having to pay $10 if they want to play their sports game online.
2348706	2353747	That's... I understand the logic behind it.
2355047	2358728	What I think, though, is that it's not really going to
2360834	2361774	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2381617	2391124	I guess the difficult part for me is that I see the logic behind it and it's hard for me to argue with it because, yeah, game developers kind of lose a little money on the used market.
2391145	2392926	This is a way for them to make it back, whatever.
2393747	2398590	What kind of irritates me, though, is that I already pay for Xbox Live.
2398810	2400352	That's what I was about to say.
2400932	2402853	You know, you pay for these services already.
2403614	2410760	If they really wanted it to be something they could make more money on, they should just have like a...
2412674	2415335	I don't know, more download packs and things like that.
2415355	2419157	They're not losing any money either off of used sales.
2419337	2425580	If you think about it, if I sell my game used to somebody, there's still one copy out there that's floating around.
2425720	2432143	It's not like I copied my copy and now they're still playing a game that you paid for once.
2433124	2434764	It's just still one person playing.
2435325	2437846	And so it is kind of a dick move to do this.
2438486	2439106	And you know what?
2439146	2443527	The fact that they haven't dropped the price of their game, you know, it's still kind of messed up.
2443867	2448969	What's even dumber, the whole thing, was that GameStop was actually quoted.
2448989	2450749	They were like, yeah, we think this is a great idea.
2451570	2456431	The quote you're thinking of, CEO Dan DeMatteo, I think, says this.
2456751	2460892	GameStop is excited to partner with such a forward-thinking publisher as Electronic Arts.
2461312	2470580	This relationship allows us to capitalize on our investments to market and sell downloadable content online as well as through our network of stores worldwide.
2470620	2472321	Are you kissing or sucking over there?
2473262	2474743	Here's the thing I think.
2474903	2476545	It's because they're probably...
2477345	2477645	and so on.
2500600	2502001	Well, yeah, and I want to say this too.
2502041	2509085	DarkTetsuya in our chat room at chat.orangehauntryday.com says, so then the game itself will only cost $29.99 new, right EA, right?
2510106	2513688	No, it's still going to cost $59.99 or let's just say $60, okay?
2514069	2518732	Because unless you live in Oregon or one of those other states with no sales tax, you're going to pay $60 plus for it.
2520493	2528498	The thing to keep in mind though, this won't affect you if you're buying your games new because you get your free code with the game and you know since it's new that no one's used it, etc., etc.
2528878	2530039	So you know that you're good.
2531948	2537151	That means... Isn't GameStop going to have to alter their policy now where they're not going to take returns on these games anymore?
2537251	2539092	No, they will take the returns on the games.
2539112	2542514	It's just like, you know, download content that would be coming with the game.
2542934	2554041	They do this a lot now where they're bundling in some DLC, like a coupon or something like that for the first piece of DLC for free or some in-game hat or something like that that you get for free.
2554461	2556942	Just to entice people to buy new games.
2557342	2559203	But the thing for me...
2560624	2563125	And, you know, I don't know because I don't play sports games a lot.
2563325	2565286	You know, I wouldn't care.
2566187	2570169	For me, if I were to buy Tiger Woods, you know, I wouldn't care that I couldn't play online.
2571317	2572338	I wouldn't buy Tiger Woods
2601677	2606960	I worry about the precedent it sets, and the part that kind of irritates me is that I feel like I'm being double-dipped.
2607320	2611422	I'm paying for Xbox Live, and now you want me to pay for this as well if it's used.
2612022	2613323	That, I have a problem with.
2613363	2613823	It's weird.
2613963	2615524	Like, I will admit, I am weird.
2615564	2616104	This is weird.
2616784	2619546	I don't have a problem with it on PlayStation, because PlayStation's free.
2619626	2621607	There's not a lot for me to complain about there.
2622127	2627889	You can't say, like, oh, well, you know, it's wrong for them to charge you to use their servers and all that stuff when...
2629470	2658290	you know you're not really paying anything for it in the first place and if you want to use these features then you know I get it but I thought that's what I was already paying for on Xbox Live I understand that EA uses their own servers and I understand that it's kind of separate like that but then does that mean that the restriction will be removed where I no longer need an Xbox Live Gold account to play these online if that's the case then okay I guess that it's the same as the PlayStation and I can't really argue but otherwise I feel like I'm being charged twice
2658370	2659031	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2672248	2674490	I don't think that EA is in Square's...
2694225	2703087	But I think that also it was the fact that they would be getting something that no one would have ever expected to be on one of their systems.
2704368	2708849	So that was, I think, to get really to get into the market share.
2709189	2712170	They're going to get EA games anyway.
2713090	2720075	EA would be completely just butt-tarded to not put out a game on Xbox 360.
2720315	2721976	I mean, there's it.
2722116	2723737	They're doing a lot of stuff in this Project $10.
2723777	2730642	They have the way that they changed the DLC, the way they kind of give it to you in Mass Effect 2.
2732303	2733784	This is not the first company to try this.
2733824	2740608	They did the same thing with SOCOM on the PSP to try to curtail people buying the used game.
2744191	2756621	My problem is basically GameStop, their money is made and used product, and they've been ballsy enough before to make publishers pay for shell space and stuff like that.
2757222	2762486	Why can't they be ballsy now to go, we think this is a stupid idea, and what's EA going to do?
2762867	2764788	Oh, we're going to stop selling our games to your stores?
2765409	2767030	They're not going to take a cut that big.
2767270	2768491	I mean, they may try to...
2769792	2773333	Make that bluff, but if you call them on it, they're not going to do anything.
2773793	2775393	And even if they did, you know what?
2775473	2784575	I've seen Blockbuster or Movie Gallery or somebody, they stopped carrying a certain vendor's product for quite a while.
2785235	2790076	And just basically saying, well, if you don't want to play by our rules, then we're just going to stop carrying your product.
2790396	2792657	And it hit them big time, and they ended up...
2793837	2794318	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2810598	2816101	But buying the game used for $40 and buying the $10 online is still cheaper than buying the game new.
2816622	2818183	And EA still gets a tiny bit of money.
2818503	2820024	So you win, you got a cheaper game.
2820424	2823246	EA wins, they get money to pay their sysadmins.
2823566	2825807	And GameStop wins because you bought a used game from them.
2825907	2831651	Okay, I want to stop there because I get what you're saying and I'm like 95% with you.
2832251	2835413	But the soccer moms buying the games for these kids lose.
2835853	2839135	Because they don't understand that there's a hidden $10 fee that's going to come with us.
2839514	2842395	And you know what else sucks too?
2842655	2842835	What?
2843015	2845376	EA, they shut down their servers after some time.
2845516	2850378	So you paid the extra money to play this game online and then it's not there.
2850558	2855440	If all of that is disclosed in the agreement, I'm borderline comfortable with it.
2856439	2862243	And then there's kind of like a little bit of back and forth here between BlackWolf and Toagak and some stuff here.
2862823	2865645	BlackWolf says, And Toagak was trying to recall a game that required them both.
2865665	2866786	Couldn't think of one.
2866946	2868367	And Bobby says, Oh, you can't remember.
2868387	2868547	Ha ha.
2876852	2880374	Well, this $10 is not a monthly fee, though, either, right?
2880634	2885356	It's just a one-time fee to do the game for the duration.
2885396	2887617	And you do get the 70 trials, so you can try it out.
2887657	2892139	If the online's really not something that you care for, then you don't have to do it.
2892439	2903485	The other thing I was thinking of, and I'm sure that they've thought of this and they don't have System Link in the game anymore, is System Link games, you can use tunneling services to actually play online with other people.
2904145	2905426	So you can use that.
2905946	2912191	It basically acts like it's a system-linked game, but you're playing it over the internet like you did with the GameCube and stuff like that with Mario Kart.
2914192	2915093	Again, I don't know.
2915293	2918435	I'm just a little worried, like, what happens next?
2918776	2923419	Like, if this ends up being acceptable, then what happens next?
2923599	2924059	You know?
2925340	2928623	They get you for $10 here, and, you know, I don't know.
2928643	2930464	They're not losing money left and right, either.
2930544	2931965	I mean, this kind of stuff will get...
2932165	2934026	It's an experiment for them.
2934066	2936507	They're just seeing, huh, what can we get away with?
2936607	2940869	It's just like the $15 map packs for Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.
2941589	2942589	What can we get away with?
2943390	2942589	$15?
2943570	2944610	Let's see if people buy this.
2944730	2946031	Oh, people are buying this like crazy?
2946051	2948832	Well, let's release another map pack for $15.
2948912	2953794	I mean, it's just... If people are going to buy this stuff left and right and just not even think about it...
2954654	2957236	There may be a lot of people that decide, hey, we're going to buy this game used.
2957877	2962660	Better off, if you really want to get this game cheaper, don't buy it used.
2962700	2964342	Just wait for the drop in price and buy it new.
2965783	2970667	And I guess the moral of the story, if you will, is so we can kind of move on with some other news.
2970867	2973048	If you don't like it, don't buy it.
2973889	2983795	Don't be one of those Left 4 Dead 2 petitioners that sign the petition against the game and then are caught on Steam playing the game the day it comes out.
2984176	2987858	If you are really against this, don't buy it and mean it.
2989994	2994477	How about something a little bit more possibly encouraging?
2994898	2995158	Sure.
2995258	2997780	Or maybe facepalming, maybe a little bit.
3000482	3007507	Walmart actually is going to be back in the used game business.
3008207	3018375	They're going to be working with Game Trade, which is a startup services provider with the lease to test their little Game Trade stores in different Walmart places.
3018915	3023019	There's only about five of them, but it's going to be previously owned games.
3024741	3028745	Movies, hardware, basically you get store credit or cash.
3030967	3038174	So yeah, they're going to be like, I guess, what GameStop was for used games, only Walmart.
3039065	3056888	well they didn't really get out of the used game market I mean the company going under that was doing their kiosk kind of they didn't have a choice so they're kind of trying the same thing again since they didn't really I don't think they launched it full steam while that company was working with them dvd play
3057168	3059090	I don't remember ever seeing used games at Walmart.
3059110	3059991	That was just being tested.
3060011	3061031	They were in test locations.
3061051	3070179	Yeah, test locations of a new company, or ePlay is what it was, and they were doing it with Best Buy and stuff like that, and they went out of business.
3070279	3074723	So now this new company, new kiosk vendor, is coming out trying to do the same thing.
3075864	3077405	We'll see what happens there, because...
3078226	3086400	It's a tough market to compete in, but granted, used games, there's not a lot of kiosks out there for that stuff, so it could catch on.
3086620	3087181	It might be neat.
3087862	3091288	I just worry about those things that there's too many ways to exploit them, but
3093453	3093934	I don't know.
3111773	3115676	But I just don't think I like that that competition is Walmart, you know?
3116236	3120259	It kind of... Well, I mean... Walmart does everything else.
3120340	3121661	Do we really need them in this, too?
3121741	3135511	Hey, at least if, you know, money gets tight and you need to buy dinner, you know, you can always trade in your game and buy dinner with the coupon or the store credit that you get, so... That's always good instead of... Hard to argue with that, okay.
3135611	3137032	You know, at least there's that option.
3138973	3140054	But, like, as far as...
3142018	3143920	As far as trading in stuff, I don't know.
3144061	3153090	It's really what they need out there is a website, and this would be pretty impossible to get considering I don't think GameStop would be sharing what their trading prices are.
3153550	3160377	But if there was a website to compare trading prices based on title per these different places, that would be kind of cool.
3160817	3163180	But once again, they're not going to give that information out.
3163620	3165122	No, I don't think they're going to give that out either.
3166539	3167420	GameStop GameStop GameStop
3183579	3186860	But I would worry that a place like Walmart isn't going to really care.
3187300	3189600	And there's going to be a lot of people to get taken advantage of.
3189780	3194761	And buy back games that are all scratchy, yucky, and codes are used.
3194781	3196081	Here's the problem though, Rob, with that.
3196281	3197061	It's a kiosk.
3197221	3199582	It's not... It's a machine.
3199602	3200662	God, that's even worse.
3200722	3203362	How does the machine know what games are in good condition and what aren't?
3203582	3204323	It tries to read them.
3204523	3205003	Oh, weird.
3205283	3206763	Yeah, it reads this.
3207323	3207543	Weird.
3207683	3210664	It checks them to see if they're able to be read.
3211124	3212144	The problem is though is...
3213004	3220109	You could trick the machine by using some sort of burn disc or something like that and it might not be able to tell the difference between it.
3221330	3229716	Of course, then you have your credit card, but once again, it's also easy to buy a prepaid credit card and you can do the same thing.
3230077	3236321	Put whatever person's name, social on there that you want and do it and you can get away with the money.
3236481	3238343	You should be telling people how to do this on the show, Loki.
3238363	3239483	I'm just saying, hey, I think it...
3241365	3242346	I work out the flaws.
3242687	3247052	If you've thought of it, somebody a little more shady has definitely already thought of it.
3248313	3250656	But then again, not everybody's thinking that way.
3250756	3254560	So you could probably factor that in.
3255541	3255702	But...
3257103	3257924	It'll be interesting to see.
3257944	3262210	I mean, because, hey, who thought renting DVDs from a kiosk was going to take off?
3263311	3264172	Not a lot of people did.
3264593	3268618	Still not going to make me stop shopping at Target over Walmart.
3268638	3270000	But, hey, you know what, though?
3270420	3273023	If it takes off at Walmart, who says that Target's not going to do it?
3273163	3275767	And, you know, if this company is anything like E-Play was...
3276107	3293792	they could easily have the same damn kiosk it's just branded with the Target stuff and it would be the same service right there and they could double dip basically in the market and there's nothing really stopping them from doing that unless they sign some sort of weird contract for it which they very well might have so you never know very true we'll see what happens
3295253	3300777	So there's some rumors now regarding when the PlayStation Move and Natal is going to be launched.
3301958	3304981	The rumor is that PlayStation Move is supposed to launch in September.
3305361	3310285	This is coming from Jason Bradbury, the host of Britain's The Gadget Show.
3310965	3317771	Apparently, he's proclaiming that the PlayStation Move controller will be released in September.
3318591	3319832	I put on his Twitter account.
3320193	3323635	Another thing I was meaning to say, September for PlayStation Move.
3323715	3324336	I'm sure of it.
3324636	3325437	Can't say why.
3325557	3326237	Just September 2010.
3329040	3332482	Well, I mean, if I was a betting man, that's a pretty good bet.
3332502	3334264	It's going to be this fall, okay?
3334284	3336125	You know it's fall.
3336706	3338467	And you know it's before Black Friday.
3338807	3341109	It must, must, must be before Black Friday.
3341850	3343151	So what does that really leave?
3344172	3346834	October, November, and maybe September.
3347728	3351851	Here's how you know when the PlayStation Move is scheduled to come out.
3351871	3356675	You look at the titles that are supporting the PlayStation Move and where they're sitting as far as releases go.
3357355	3364401	Everything that I've seen so far is pointing to November, which makes sense because that's when they seem to launch new consoles and whatnot.
3364521	3365702	I would be betting November.
3367426	3368307	So we'll see.
3368708	3372693	So you are going to go against the British guy from Gadgets or whatever?
3372713	3374295	I don't know who the fuck Jason Bradbury is.
3374736	3375817	The Gadget Show.
3376278	3376918	Good for you.
3377019	3377920	You think something.
3378320	3381204	I think you should challenge Jason Bradbury to a throwdown.
3381665	3382466	A throwdown?
3383667	3394717	A hoedown throwdown Whatever, I could be like Michael Patcher and say random shit And if I'm right, I'm a genius If I'm wrong, no one will remember So, whatever I'm an analyst!
3394777	3402723	Yeah, we should just start calling you an analyst We need to have a segment on the show Analyst Loki No, but I'm serious How about analist?
3402823	3403064	Okay
3405069	3430133	I'm serious though, like, look at, um, look at iPad, iPad is supporting the PlayStation Move, and that's supposed to be coming out in the fall, um, Lord of the Rings, Eragon's Quest, whatever's supposed to be coming out, um, in the fall as well, because that's now supporting the move on the PlayStation 3, um, LittleBigPlanet 2 will probably be coming out, like, this fall, I'm guessing, it, it's all gonna be around the same time, um,
3432017	3452923	I don't know about September I guess it could be September if you think about it because they are starting to support games now with the PlayStation Move stuff so publishers have access to it and I guess they could do that but I would be more willing to bet it's going to be closer to Christmas just to catch in on that holiday buying madness we'll see
3453183	3456127	Now see, where's that story going to be on all the game blogs tomorrow?
3456187	3473207	That world-renowned, years-long-running game analyst Loki has predicted on some little crappy web show, just like this other thing, the gadget show or whatever, that Move is coming out in November.
3473487	3475469	He is sure of it, folks.
3475669	3476790	He is sure of it.
3477031	3478272	Let me just put it this way, okay?
3478352	3481355	And this goes both against me and against him.
3482056	3484759	Just because we're hosts of a show doesn't mean we know what we're talking about.
3486861	3492346	Just because he hosts a TV show does not mean he knows exactly when the PlayStation move's coming out.
3493087	3493668	It's a good guess.
3494008	3494989	Fourth quarter, duh.
3495209	3496811	It's going to be coming out fourth quarter, so...
3499079	3499820	Whenever that is.
3499940	3501181	If it's September, great.
3501241	3502321	It'll be nice and early.
3502902	3509326	But, you know, from what I've seen, their major Sony releases have either been in November or October.
3509927	3512469	October, like last year, for example, because he had Uncharted 2.
3515271	3516892	God, there was other Sony titles last year.
3517192	3520534	But LittleBigPlanet was also in October as well.
3520874	3525658	Although Resistance 2, I believe, was in November.
3526238	3528300	So it's all around that same time.
3529380	3530801	They have released schedules.
3530941	3532222	What about Natal, then?
3532823	3537005	What does our analyst think about Project Natal?
3537365	3540327	They're saying that it's going to be releasing in October.
3541788	3546791	This is according to Microsoft's Saudi vendor.
3546851	3550654	He's not even really working for Microsoft yet.
3550994	3564105	Although they quote him as working with Microsoft, apparently G4 has said that Saeed Bilal is not a Microsoft employee.
3564145	3571891	He is a vendor employed through a third-party company on behalf of a Microsoft subsidiary in Saudi Arabia.
3574813	3575494	Pardon me, pardon me.
3575754	3577937	Who do you trust more, G4 or Analyst Loki?
3596212	3598334	G4 or Loki?
3598834	3599034	Ready?
3599074	3599234	Go.
3621091	3624414	I don't think it's gonna be definitely in October.
3625034	3630998	And once again, it's because all the major stuff that's been released is usually around that November time.
3631078	3634361	Now, granted, they could do the fall update early.
3634581	3636843	It's gonna be timed with the fall update, basically.
3637043	3638064	You're gonna have the fall update...
3638704	3655368	Slightly before this is launched, just like when they did the Avatars, the new Xbox experience, whatever, they had their new Scenic game come out slightly before this new update came out.
3655428	3661810	So you kind of look at what the games are, what games are supporting Natal and stuff, and what their release schedule is going to be like, and you can kind of guess...
3662790	3663491	and DarkSakura.com.
3686926	3692850	Let's go to the results of our quick poll chat in our chatroom, chat.orange.com Who do you trust more, G4 or Loki?
3693270	3699554	We have Loki, Analyst Loki, I trust Banana Man, Loki for sure, Homer Simpson, Analyst Loki, Analyst Loki.
3700534	3703476	I mean, I trust the bird because the bird is the word.
3703496	3704237	Stop it!
3710500	3734652	um let's see uh Loki at least he mentions games I work on we all trust Loki because we all love Secret Club analist Loki over anything although anything is better than G4 I don't know G4 has hotness G4 has ninja challenge that is a good point G4 does have ninja challenge Loki not the OLR the Norse god I've trusted Loki with my life before or budget at least and there you go
3736599	3741006	I would be willing to bet that we'll find out probably before it's released.
3742448	3747595	I mean, well, obviously we're going to find out before it's released, but we were going to find out before they announce it.
3747635	3748216	Let me put it that way.
3750223	3756390	Alright, well, do you think you know a catchphrase that ought to be in the next NBA Jam?
3756410	3768583	You know, if you have the next Boom Shakalaka, if you know Boom Shakalaka, he's on fire, you know, if you have the next catchphrase for NBA Jam, they want to know.
3769364	3780358	EA Sports has come out and said that they're doing this whole little contest about the next catchphrase in NBA Jam.
3780399	3782061	Of course, it's taking place on Facebook.
3782361	3787308	Go to facebook.com slash NBA Jam and you can submit your entries up until...
3787868	3789329	May 19th, 9 a.m.
3789369	3790129	Pacific Time.
3790209	3791130	That doesn't give you much time.
3791730	3799893	There will be fan voting on the top 64 entries and the one with the highest votes will be immortalized in the game.
3801014	3805456	Now they say the entries must be associated with one of the following actions in the game.
3805936	3817745	Dunks, assist, alley-oops, blocks, three-point shots, two-point field goal, on-fire shots, steals, shot clock violations, rebounds, missed shots.
3818146	3827233	Catchphrases should avoid a reference to specific NBA players, and they must not contain pornography, illicit content, and must be appropriate for audiences 13 years of age.
3827493	3830275	I listened to the ad for that.
3831116	3832096	Dan played it the other day.
3832116	3833858	I was like, dude, it's the guy.
3835479	3837982	Alpha Cananogram suggests, and boom goes the dynamite.
3840646	3842508	That's a great YouTube clip, by the way, if you've never seen it.
3842548	3843269	Boom goes the dynamite.
3843589	3844570	I think that should be in the game.
3844610	3845331	Boom goes the dynamite.
3846973	3847333	I don't know.
3847714	3851679	I'm thinking that maybe they could do something with the bird.
3852700	3853120	No.
3856118	3859499	SSJ 100 Matt saying that we should have an OLR catchphrase in it.
3859579	3860059	I don't know.
3860079	3862940	What OLR catchphrase would lend itself to basketball?
3863100	3863600	I don't know.
3864180	3864781	Like ferret?
3864821	3865701	That doesn't really work.
3866241	3867041	Exterminate?
3867201	3867742	Can you really?
3867762	3870202	I mean, that's really a Doctor Who thing that we just kind of stole.
3871063	3872943	What other OLR catchphrases do we have?
3872983	3873363	I don't know.
3873943	3874864	Do we have other catchphrases?
3874924	3876704	Your mom.
3876724	3878925	There's Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, what?
3879545	3880005	I don't know.
3880605	3882286	I don't think that'll do it.
3883753	3888835	Some other folks are saying that they should try to sneak in an OLR reference into the catchphrases.
3889315	3891996	I really don't know what that OLR catchphrase would be.
3893717	3894137	Ferret!
3895617	3896217	Duck Island?
3896638	3896938	Okay.
3897578	3898478	Duck Island might work.
3899439	3901579	He made that shot all the way from Duck Island!
3901599	3903860	I'd be like, what?
3904620	3906261	That shot coming in from Duck Island!
3909990	3910371	No.
3910831	3911651	How about no?
3912272	3914313	It's just J100 Matt says friend your butt.
3916014	3918155	He'll friend your butt, dunk!
3921303	3925645	No, that won't work either because that might not be appropriate for audiences under 13.
3925705	3925986	All right.
3926646	3928267	Maybe there will be a future list list.
3928347	3928927	I don't know.
3928947	3930008	The contest will be over by then.
3930028	3930828	We'll see.
3932449	3932909	Look at him.
3932969	3934290	Handle those balls.
3934450	3934570	No.
3934590	3937752	That ain't appropriate.
3938833	3941534	But it did make me laugh.
3941954	3942695	It did make me laugh.
3943475	3943755	All right.
3944336	3950059	Let's move on with some more news and, of course, release dates coming up and the classic game of the week at some point tonight.
3950733	3952319	How about something that isn't crappy?
3953864	3956595	There's a Castlevania game coming out on the iPhone, Rob.
3958177	3958797	OMG What?
3959338	3959718	Yeah.
3959798	3960018	What?
3960678	3965440	It's Encore of the Night, which is really a puzzle game.
3966461	3970822	It's going to be hard to control, right?
3971963	3976485	When I looked at it, I was like, oh, it's Puzzle Fighter and Puzzle Quest.
3976605	3986429	So basically the little screen capture on here is Alucard playing against one of the fish guys who hangs out in Dracula's basement.
3987919	3989040	But it could be fun.
3989140	3993103	I think I'm going to try it out, you know, but it also looks like it's timed.
3994685	3997387	Each of your little matches is timed because there's an hourglass.
3998368	4002551	But why can't they just... Or maybe when the timer runs out, something bad happens.
4003752	4006635	Like the fish guy takes a big poop or something, I don't know.
4006655	4008777	And eats your face.
4008857	4009737	And poops your face.
4010058	4010838	He friends your butt.
4010858	4011078	Yes.
4014521	4015142	It could be cool.
4017771	4018131	I guess.
4018712	4019633	I like puzzle games.
4019693	4020714	I like Castlevania.
4021635	4022436	It's all in the price.
4023437	4023997	It's all in the price.
4024297	4027621	By the way, some more suggestions for the NBA Jam thing from our chat.
4027641	4029623	And I gotta say, this is my favorite so far from SSJ100 Matt.
4029643	4029803	Dongle!
4034738	4035219	That's a good one.
4035359	4035799	That's a good one.
4038182	4039323	I might be saying this wrong.
4040164	4040884	Shesro?
4041145	4042346	Shurzo.
4042466	4042886	Shurzo.
4043187	4044688	Shurzo says double down.
4045429	4047831	You know, like in reference to Loki's least favorite KFC food.
4048732	4049012	All right.
4049833	4050994	Let's move on to some release dates.
4051014	4054358	We're going to travel around the world and look at some release dates, Loki.
4054858	4056820	We're going to look at some release dates.
4057001	4058062	That doesn't really work for...
4059770	4060151	NBA Jam.
4060171	4062336	No, it doesn't.
4063258	4064701	Yeah, actually some good stuff coming up this week.
4067791	4071173	Big push for games until Memorial Day.
4071613	4073154	Yeah, well, until July.
4075055	4078657	But this week, though, we have Split Second coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4078717	4079758	Highly recommend picking that up.
4079858	4080718	It's actually pretty awesome.
4080879	4082119	Oh, and also on PC, apparently.
4083920	4085881	Shrek Forever After for the little tykes.
4086022	4089624	Of course, the new tie-in game with that movie that thankfully is...
4090524	4090904	Done.
4091245	4092266	No more Shrek movies.
4092646	4093206	Thank you.
4093827	4098070	They'll be coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PSP.
4100152	4107878	Prince of Persia, The Forgotten Sands, making its way out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS, and PSP.
4108619	4118747	The PSP version is supposed to be 2D, and then they're also re-releasing Prince of Persia, The Sands of Time on PlayStation 2, in case you haven't picked that up and feel festive with the movie coming out and everything.
4120289	4126920	The game I'm definitely going to be playing a lot this week Red Dead Redemption coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week
4129674	4155596	City Builder coming out on the Wii until the forgotten about game that no one will be picking up Attack of the Movies 3D it's a parody of a bunch of movies including Terminator and you know Alien Mummy it's got 3D glasses and you can play in 3D it is a on-rails shooter game and what makes it even more bizarre is it's coming out in 360 as well how the fuck is that gonna work
4156892	4158193	with the analog sticks, I guess.
4158934	4159734	Horrible decision.
4160975	4168281	And then, of course, Alan Wake making its way out on Xbox 360, and they're also doing a limited edition for that this week as well.
4170180	4172062	and that's basically it.
4173223	4174824	It's just J100 Matt in our chat room.
4175405	4178107	That play was better than a DS Master email.
4178968	4179929	Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
4179949	4180889	How did I miss this?
4180969	4181970	I must have scrolled too quickly.
4182671	4190658	Imagine Animal Doctor Care Center on DS and then a better game, Blue Dragon Awakens Shadows come out on DS as well.
4190938	4193660	Ooh, ooh, I got a good one.
4193740	4194181	I got a good one.
4194561	4194721	Ready?
4195622	4196583	He's on FIRED!
4198280	4203524	Rob, Rob, Rob, that's the slow Rob.
4203805	4206607	And of course, one week from today, Super Mario Galaxy 2.
4207868	4216915	Going to Japan and looking at the release dates in Japan on the Xbox 360, Lost Planet 2, Senko no Rande Duo comes out on the Xbox 360 as well.
4216995	4222360	That is an updated version of an old game that's now on the Xbox 360.
4222420	4223801	New graphics and everything, woohoo!
4224501	4253136	Tropico 3 also again these are Japanese release dates and the Xbox 360 is getting a whole little bundle for Lost Planet 2 there you go going over to the PlayStation 3 and looking at what's coming out there another Lost Planet 2 the port for the PS3 is coming out there as well as World Soccer winning 11 2010 Aoki Samurai no Chosen comes out there as well there's also a brand new Horipad if you want to check that out if you are into the Japanese peripherals you can look at that

4255798	4258499	World Soccer Winning 11 2010 comes out this week.
4258599	4261001	Next week, just so you know, is the Japanese release of Red Steel 2.
4261681	4262682	They don't have that game yet.
4263783	4268626	On the PlayStation 2, Tier Nanog is getting a price reduction.
4268666	4269487	That's a game coming out.
4269807	4271328	There's also a port of World Soccer Winning 11 2010.
4272549	4274990	And a few games in the Lucy and Bees series.
4275050	4277132	There's Evil Violet and Justice Yellow.
4277752	4280054	I'm guessing those are like Pokemon-y types of games.
4280474	4282976	On the Nintendo DS, Captain Tsubasa.
4283516	4286597	and Gekituo no Kiseki comes out this week.
4286717	4289558	That is a soccer type of game, I guess, with all the winning 11.
4289858	4291439	The DS wants in on the action as well.
4291459	4292219	It's also a manga.
4292519	4292999	Different game.
4293259	4293560	Oh, is it?
4293600	4294820	Is it a soccer manga type of thing?
4294880	4295160	Yeah.
4295620	4296201	Oh, good times.
4296861	4305184	And then coming out on the PSP, Higani no Rekken Jutsushi, Full Metal Alchemist, Yakusoku no Hai'i.
4306264	4332360	yes it's a Fullmetal Alchemist game on the PSP as to what type of game it is I think you actually kind of get to play as Ed and Al you get to I don't know if it's like a kind of like a little like 3D adventure game with a lot of like cut scenes and dialogue so it's a I think it'll do Fullmetal Alchemist fans some justice there so check that out on the PSP this week in Japan those are Japanese release dates
4333782	4338867	In the UK, we have on the 18th, Dragon Age Origins, Darkspawn Chronicles.
4339528	4350158	On the 21st, Mod Nation Racers, MorphX, Prince of Persia, The Forgotten Sands, All-Star Karate, Red Dead Redemption, and Rooms the Main Building.

4357592	4358733	Alright, alright.
4359074	4361977	More gaming news than the classic game of the week coming right up.
4362057	4370166	And DarkSakura, I'm not going to spoil what the game is this week, but she just picked a game where she's like, yeah, pretty much everyone says this is a classic.
4372348	4373349	So we'll get to that in a little bit.
4373650	4379516	To put it a little bit more, it's a game that Dan and I played a lot of when we first got together.
4380097	4381318	Capcom is working on an MMO
4399898	4400859	Call it Mega Man Online.
4401459	4408263	And according to GameSpot, they're saying it's being co-developed by Korea's NeoWiz Games.
4408783	4411605	They're responsible for EA Sports FIFA Online.
4412585	4419609	And possibly might be related to the Mega Man Universe game.
4420189	4425412	Well, maybe it's... Could be different names, different regions, too.
4425992	4426193	Yeah.
4426773	4427313	You never know.
4427333	4427493	So...
4430737	4431037	I don't know.
4431117	4432018	That's kind of neat.
4432158	4435779	I don't know what they're really going to do for a Mega Man online game, but it'll be pretty awesome, I'm sure.
4436259	4440641	I've got to admit, I kind of approach this with a big, huh.
4441181	4445123	It's just kind of like, how would a Mega Man online game work?
4445563	4449704	But then I think about Mega Man Legends, and I'm like, huh.
4450164	4451765	This could be interesting.
4452465	4453486	I'm not sure how yet.
4453546	4458728	Or imagine if you're not really playing as Mega Man, but imagine if you got to be your own robot master boss.
4459708	4461049	That would be kind of rad, actually.
4461450	4465934	I don't know, there's just, there's just, there's just something, things that make you go, hmm.
4466734	4468496	There's definitely a big hmm factor with this.
4469177	4470358	I don't know, I don't know what to think.
4470538	4471979	I'll need to see screenshots or something.
4472259	4474141	Do you think you'll get to see more of this at E3?
4475142	4477704	It might be a little early, but that'd be kind of neat if they announced something.
4479406	4479806	Very cool.
4482068	4484008	Alright, well we'll see what happens with Mega Man Online.
4484309	4490590	DarkSakura, do you like the idea of Mega Man going online or is it enough of the freaking MMOs already?
4492070	4492731	It's a good idea.
4493571	4494751	Yay for whoever wants to play it.
4494851	4495271	Good for them.
4495911	4496451	Would you play it?
4496692	4497732	Ask Star Trek Online, dude.
4499052	4502473	Even if you got to be a robot master boss, there's no robot master boss you'd want to be?
4503093	4505114	Well, no.
4506474	4506754	Alright.
4508248	4509269	It's Sakura Woman.
4512090	4513971	Loki could finally have Pizza Man for reals.
4514871	4516792	That reference is about five years old on this show.
4516833	4517333	Pizza Man.
4517613	4519974	Yeah.
4520274	4521175	I think there's a clip of that.
4521215	4523336	Let me tell you how old that reference is.
4523656	4525857	There's a clip of that on our MySpace.
4526317	4526898	I don't even remember.
4527738	4529960	Oh, we were talking about the Mega Man 2 sound effect thing.
4556318	4569049	who knows MTV is saying up and down they have not announced anything besides Green Day Rock Band and Rock Band 3 but they are quick to say we have a great relationship with Pearl Jam and hope to have many of their more awesome music in the game in the future
4569775	4570636	Hmm.
4571636	4572156	Hmm.
4573197	4575158	Here's where I have a problem with this right now.
4576379	4584663	They've given it a Peggy rating on the box art this early that the fact that they haven't even announced the game yet, it would not have a rating.
4584944	4586324	It would be rating pending.
4586344	4587325	Very good point.
4588186	4590747	It's fake.
4590927	4592188	Wishful thinking, basically.
4592822	4597947	I mean, I don't know, like I kind of go, okay, yeah, I could see Pearl Jam getting their own rock band.
4598087	4602872	Like, you know, and we've talked about this on the show before, there's only certain bands that can have a rock band.
4603552	4608677	Like, not every band is worthy of having a rock band game dedicated to them, but Pearl Jam, okay.
4609458	4614121	There was a survey that came out that was asking people what dedicated rock band games would you like to see?
4614181	4617063	Which artists would you want to see have their game?
4617483	4618784	And Pearl Jam was on the list.
4619124	4620765	So I think it's a little bit of wishful thinking.
4620805	4630632	It's kind of like how with... Even if you look at GameStop's website and stuff like that, there's a bunch of listings for games like Pilotwings for the Wii and stuff like that.
4630712	4634114	Stuff that doesn't exist but that they're taking pre-orders on.
4635275	4637576	Just in case, you know, that kind of stuff.
4637596	4638916	How about Rock Band ABBA?
4639097	4639937	That's the one I want.
4641477	4649360	By the way, apparently, yeah, they are doing that little test right now, but there's also some news about how well these games are selling.
4649980	4656623	The NPD group is saying that Guitar Hero Van Halen only sold 94,000 copies, which kind of makes it a poop.
4657383	4658964	However, it's hard to say.
4659004	4661224	Does that count the free ones that went out?
4661384	4665026	Because that sort of would kind of screw those numbers, wouldn't it?
4666286	4668647	It's copies sold, so I would imagine, yes, it does.
4668687	4673308	Well, to put it in perspective, Guitar Hero Aerosmith sold 2.7 million copies.
4673988	4676349	Guitar Hero Metallica sold 1 million copies.
4676789	4680251	Beatle Rock Band, 1.2 million copies.
4680431	4684212	Guitar Hero Aerosmith sold twice as many as Beatle's Rock Band.
4685052	4704245	Well, think about it though, Guitar Hero Aerosmith was first It was the first kind of, you know, one group exclusive game that came out And it seems like the numbers have slowly gone down since then And then Van Halen just kind of pooped, you know, didn't do much But it's hard to say, because again, they were giving that away for free Can you really trust that number?
4704406	4710790	I don't know It'll be very interesting to see how the Guitar Hero Green Day sells You know what's also not accounted for in here?
4711330	4712451	Did I say Guitar Hero Green Day?
4712491	4713352	I meant Rock Band Green Day
4713792	4718713	What's also not accounted for in here is the, like, wasn't there an ACDC rock band game that came out?
4719253	4720573	I don't see that in here anywhere.
4720613	4722114	It was like a live ACDC game.
4722154	4724174	It was exclusive to Walmart for a little while, but then it wasn't.
4724974	4726555	I don't see numbers for that anywhere in here.
4727335	4728575	There's no numbers for that.
4728975	4729375	Probably.
4729895	4735036	And just for the reference, on the Peggy website, there is no listing for that new rock band game.
4735416	4737197	If it had a rating, it would be listed on there.
4737517	4737697	See?
4737957	4738637	Analyst Loki.
4740268	4742550	Squelch and the Rumors right here at Orange Lounge Radio.
4743951	4744251	All right.
4745392	4751276	Just out of curiosity, though, if they did do a band-based game, a one-band game, is there any bands you'd want to see?
4751596	4751716	No.
4752136	4752276	No?
4753097	4753217	No.
4753437	4753537	No.
4754218	4757440	DarkSakura, any bands you think are deserving of their full rock band game?
4757990	4764732	Electric Light Orchestra Sorry, I've been on an ELO kick lately ABBA Rock Band, you think I'm kidding?
4765092	4785639	Radiohead Rock Band I would be down with a Radiohead Rock Band actually but I just don't see Radiohead as the type of band that would want to be a part of that I would love to see I know they said on the Rock Band Network it could happen I would like to see some drum and bass tracks come out on Rock Band get some Pendulum in there something like that
4786079	4787500	I mean, that would be pretty cool.
4787560	4789120	It's like some guitar stuff in there.
4789661	4793482	I guess it'd be really difficult to do on drums, but it would be neat to see.
4795263	4796644	Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room.
4796684	4799185	He's getting a lot of comments tonight, but he's saying some good stuff.
4799465	4801006	Wants to clarify the ACDC deal.
4801046	4802146	That was a track pack.
4802787	4803967	It wasn't actually a separate game.
4804007	4805048	It wasn't listed as a separate game.
4805068	4805708	It was a track pack.
4805970	4809773	Yes, but Bobby, technically you can play it by itself, therefore it is kind of a separate game.
4810294	4811575	I get what he's saying, though.
4811635	4816479	It's in the vein of those country packs and the things they sold individually.
4816539	4819382	But yeah, I thought of it as a separate game because could you buy the ACDC stuff?
4819402	4821123	You can buy it and play it by itself.
4823225	4825547	I didn't think you could buy it from within Rock Band.
4825607	4827069	No, you can't buy it within Rock Band.
4827109	4830512	You can buy the track pack, play it by itself, or dump it into your game.
4830792	4832714	Donovan's suggesting Village People Rock Band.
4834186	4836688	Black Wolf again says, I'd like to see Rush or U2.
4838389	4840530	Funny T-Man says, Golden Girls rock band.
4840610	4841091	There you go.
4843812	4847314	It could be the Betty White version of Thank You for Being a Friend from Saturday Night Live a couple weeks ago.
4848395	4849416	Anyhow, let's get into it.
4849436	4850917	Speaking of old classics.
4851657	4853618	When doesn't the Golden Girls seem to come up on this show lately?
4854079	4854799	Old classics.
4854839	4856320	Because I want to be Betty White when I grow up.
4857201	4860663	DarkSakura likes to dig through the gaming vault and find a game that she says, Hey!
4861465	4863025	Hey, listen.
4863225	4864066	Hey, listen.
4864966	4867867	You kids ought to be playing this game.
4868347	4869987	It's the classic video game of the week.
4870247	4874588	And I think, though, this week she's managed to pick a game that most people have played.
4874848	4877669	But if you haven't, what the hell?
4878129	4879989	Seriously, where the hell have you been?
4880089	4881630	What planet have you been hanging out on?
4881790	4882290	Let's get to it.
4882330	4884270	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
4884331	4885211	Super Mario 64.
4888484	4889685	Super Mario 64!
4890306	4898292	Yeah, this... I have to say, this is one of my favorite ever Nintendo 64 games.
4898332	4899233	Probably one of my favorite.
4899673	4901595	It's up there in my list of favorites.
4903696	4913284	It was, you know, the first real dive into 3D for Mario, and it was one of those games that that controller just seemed to be made for.
4913324	4914065	But I love the music.
4914806	4915846	Can you turn up Rob for a minute?
4916327	4916547	Okay.
4923286	4952886	I love the early level I also love that you can go up to a sleeping piranha plant and punch him in the face cause look he's about to do it here too but that was like there were just so many little fun things you know you could do the wall jump you could also glitch the game hardcore and just beat it right from the very get go if you were really good at the wall jump see he punched the piranha plant in the face shoot it in the face in the face Mario's hardcore like that he's a thug um
4954993	4965824	At any rate, the game starts off at Princess Peach's castle and she writes him a letter and says, I baked you a cake, even though I'm a princess and have servants to do it for me.
4967266	4970249	I think it was also the first game in the US that we got her name as being Peach.
4970589	4972351	If you think about it, though, she is a princess.
4972391	4975173	She could take credit for what her servants did.
4977255	4978196	I baked this for you.
4978576	4981519	By me, I mean I own these servants that made it for you.
4981539	4983981	I want to say she was actually Peach in Mario 3.
4985623	4988485	Well, I know Mario Kart was on Super Nintendo.
4988525	4989206	That was before this.
4989546	4990988	I'm pretty sure Mario 3 called her Peach.
4991408	4993409	Thank you for watching!
5011662	5012543	levels in different means.
5012963	5019227	That theme kept coming back in later 3D Mario games like in Sunshine and I think in Galaxy.
5020068	5022950	You had different ways of beating the levels and that was pretty cool.
5023030	5024651	Fairly innovative.
5025291	5033277	You could get different things like the metal cap where you turned into shiny chrome Mario and went bang, bang, bang, every time you ran.
5033717	5037299	Which is always what I thought of knights in armor trying to run.
5038840	5039841	You got a wing cap.
5040281	5041222	Can you do that one more time?
5042663	5045286	Can you say that one more time?
5046186	5046827	There, how's that?
5047308	5047528	Yes.
5048509	5050430	And you can find a pink Bob-omb buddy.
5050711	5051952	Ooh, he's pink.
5053073	5059839	And there were... You also had coins that you used for your life.
5060860	5061861	And you could also...
5064308	5065289	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5080844	5097157	Um, so it was originally gonna be, um, a Super FX game for the SNES, but, um, it couldn't quite reach what he wanted to do, so basically he, I think, I think he pulled an avatar on this, dusted it off out of a drawer, decided, oh, technology's caught up, let's do it.
5098318	5101000	And then, um, I love the sliding levels, too.
5101280	5102341	He just fell down a hole, though.
5104373	5127831	and you can move the camera around and it does have a fairly set path you can go but you can just run around and do stuff and explore and even if you're like trying to beat a certain way if like if you're doing a certain mission that has you beat the level a certain way you can actually do it the other way you know if you just decide to do that but it's
5130620	5132643	It's really just, you know, pretty cool.
5132663	5137568	And also the music in it was done by Koji Kondo, who is one of my personal heroes.
5138530	5141613	And it was one of the first ones that had Charles Martinet to do the voice.
5142915	5143656	He's so cool.
5144016	5144817	He's so cool.
5146039	5148281	He was cool to meet, you know.
5149242	5154404	Um, so yeah, it's, I think, in that list of one of, you know, best games ever.
5155444	5158425	And, um, dude, punching a piranha plant in the face.
5159286	5164988	You know, grabbing Koop, you know, Bowser by the tail and swinging him around and throwing him off a building.
5165768	5167769	You know, Mario turned into a thug in this game.
5169269	5173131	And also, if you want to see something incredibly fun, go on YouTube and just watch speedruns.
5173911	5176892	But now, the, um...
5179179	5194253	The really interesting thing with this game for me is that Dan and I, we spent, because he had a Nintendo 64, we didn't actually have nearly the collection that we do now.
5194894	5200739	When we first moved in together, we had maybe about 20 video game systems then, maybe 15, something like that.
5201760	5204941	I moved out here with my Super Nintendo and stuff.
5205281	5209963	But he had a Nintendo 64, and we just played the stew out of this game.
5210883	5215744	And we played the Rumble Pak, and we had a lot of fun.
5215824	5217745	It was just really, really cool.
5218565	5232781	and I actually have the Nintendo DS one and it's actually a little harder to play but, you know, you play as Yoshi, Luigi and Wario and it looks a little bit better and it's got mini games and multiplayer mode and it's pretty good.
5234003	5251520	There was a direct sequel planned for the Nintendo 64DD, and Miyamoto had started it in 97, and it was going to be released in 99, but because the 64DD didn't make it...
5254192	5258655	My husband just decided to pop his head in the door and said that the movie he was watching was awesome.
5258675	5259496	What movie were they watching?
5259616	5260036	Kick-Ass.
5260076	5260637	Oh, Kick-Ass.
5261718	5262118	Good times.
5263159	5277869	But because 64DD pretty much flopped, we basically got Super Mario Sunshine on GameCube, and then we got Super Mario Galaxy, and of course we're getting another Super Mario Galaxy.
5278408	5280049	So, yeah.
5280249	5283210	This game has a special place in my heart.
5284491	5287212	That, and when you win the game, Peach makes you a cake.
5288273	5289193	Like she promised.
5289433	5289693	Yep.
5290154	5290554	Good for her.
5292541	5292901	Alright.
5293842	5294963	Well, there it is.
5295023	5296764	Your classic game of the week.
5297384	5298845	Super Mario 64.
5299766	5301307	Now I want to give a quick counter opinion.
5301927	5303708	This was not my favorite Mario game in the series.
5303888	5306150	I did not like the transition to 3D very much.
5306210	5309192	I understand a lot of people are all excited about it.
5309572	5310052	But I don't know.
5310392	5316216	I had a really hard time with this game after the awesomeness that were the Super Nintendo Mario games.
5316536	5316856	I don't know.
5316977	5318698	The switch to 3D never felt right for me.
5319158	5320099	But oddly enough...
5321079	5322742	I was okay with Mario Sunshine.
5324105	5325227	I know that makes me weird.
5325267	5327410	I'm all sorts of weird, but whatever.
5329113	5330275	You are weirdo, Rob.
5330896	5331357	I am weird.
5331397	5331758	It's fine.
5331838	5332519	It's fine.
5332740	5333461	I deal with it.
5333891	5337713	Okay, anyhow, let's go ahead and take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio.
5337733	5340074	We got more gaming news we want to get to in Part B tonight.
5340735	5341515	We haven't gotten to yet.
5341575	5345697	In fact, you know, huge news about a free game that's available we're going to get to.
5345857	5349259	I mean, I'm sure everybody's already downloaded it, but if you haven't, we'll tell you more about it in a minute.
5350200	5351140	Plus movie news.
5351280	5352521	Movies turning into games.
5352601	5353562	Games turning into movies.
5353922	5354782	Lots of news like that.
5355343	5357924	And a little more Red Dead Redemption and Rapid Fire news.
5358084	5363027	And your calls when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5363837	5370264	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday, May the 16th of 2010 where we are taping the 357th episode.
5370284	5370384	No, 67th.
5373766	5374386	Yeah, I lost count.
5374406	5375667	I was talking about that earlier in the show.
5375987	5385154	367th episode of our show, as we do every week at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, live here on Sunday nights.
5385334	5395581	We've talked about a lot of different news in Part A tonight, talking about EA's controversial new $10 thing, talking about used games at Walmart, and our gaming weeks were quite long tonight.
5395621	5396541	Everybody's doing something.
5396581	5402225	Dark Sakura went to Pinnagogo when I was playing 3D.GameHeroes, and Loki's still playing Grand Theft Auto.
5402365	5402845	That's all right.
5402885	5403266	Good times.
5404488	5409181	Speaking of Loki, he's going to start off with some quick news topics before we get back into some longer discussion.
5409201	5410725	So quick, quick, what's on your mind tonight, Loki?
5412144	5416567	Yes, apparently there's another dance game coming to the Wii.
5417588	5425594	And funny enough, this actually has a tie back into one of the shows that I wasn't a part of, but Rob had hosted a while back.
5426174	5428916	And it's Kids Bop Dance Party the Video Game.
5428976	5433360	You might ask, how did that even, you know... How the fuck did that come up on OLR?
5433380	5434160	I don't even remember that.
5434180	5435221	It wasn't on OLR.
5435261	5436122	It was on Vanilla Sky.
5436142	5436983	Oh, I wanted to spin on that.
5437503	5440646	I'm a genius, I invented that game all by myself
5488488	5489850	They came up inadvertently.
5489950	5490191	Whoops.
5490351	5494797	The Benny Hill theme, unfortunately not part of the Kidz Bop dance party video game.
5494898	5495498	You know what's funny?
5495579	5496280	Total mistake.
5496360	5498403	Didn't intend for that music to play, but somehow fitting.
5499944	5521171	Yes, such songs in this will be of course Lady Gaga's Paparazzi, Michael Jackson's Thriller, Pink's Get the Party Started, and yeah, it's going to include a free play challenge, dance off, shop and dress up modes, and it will feature two players that can dance cooperatively, or go head to head.
5522930	5525432	Lame, but not really my target demographic.
5525472	5530277	But then again, Just Dance sold a million copies, so what do I know about games, I guess?
5530577	5531258	Apparently nothing.
5533740	5537924	If you are a collector of such odd game peripherals as...
5539205	5545468	I don't know, the chainsaw controller for Resident Evil, or I guess in this case, Dragon Quest.
5545688	5550970	It's going to be getting its own Dragon Quest Monsters Battle Road Victory.
5553031	5562795	It's a Wii game that was a port of an arcade game that's based on collectible cards, but the actual controller, like the arcade, has two giant buttons and
5563135	5568681	and a giant sword that looks like it's basically the sword in the stone that you have to interact with as well.
5569021	5579331	The controller will cost the 12,800 yen the equivalent of $137 US and will be out in Japan this summer.
5579732	5585918	So if you're a big collector of odd peripherals this will be coming to you from Hori.
5587459	5597106	And then finally, of course, we've been hearing about a lot of cameos of characters in Lost Planet 2, including Dom from Gears of War.
5598087	5602089	Well, now, of course, Sony's got to have their characters in there as well.
5602530	5612917	Not really making it in for the launch, but there will be some free download content coming out soon that will include the Helghast characters from the Killzone series.
5613217	5614278	The crew from Kidz Bop meets Gwar.
5614298	5615298	That'd be weird.
5640895	5668237	and I don't know like maybe it could be like a point and click type of game like in the vein of you know Sam and Max and those types of games where like the you play as the folks from GWAR and you're trying to find the people from Kidz Bop and like corrupt them and or murder them I will one up that okay I will one up that please we need to launch a new CD series called GWAR Bop that basically takes GWAR and has them sing all these different contemporary hits as they put it
5672121	5672661	I'd play that.
5672861	5673382	I would too.
5673682	5674222	Good stuff.
5674522	5674823	All right.
5675083	5677105	And then we'll make it come full circle and put it out of the game.
5677305	5677625	All right.
5677685	5680807	So possibly coming to a PC near you.
5681168	5681448	All right.
5681828	5682269	Moving on.
5682309	5684270	Let's talk about some other quick news.
5684991	5685551	Halo 2.
5686172	5688674	Yes, there were still some holdouts playing Halo 2 online.
5688694	5692517	You might remember there were guys that were refusing to pull their net connection.
5693197	5694538	And what's kind of weird is that...
5695439	5700060	Microsoft, you would think, would have just put the banhammer down on them a long time ago.
5700120	5701420	But they kind of thought it was funny.
5701540	5705981	And they let it go as long as they could hold out their connections and so forth.
5706361	5710062	And the last man standing was ApacheN4Sir.
5710942	5712002	It was the gamer tag.
5712582	5714703	And he was finally removed.
5714743	5715863	He says he was kicked off.
5715943	5718983	But kicked off could mean that his Comcast connection sucks balls.
5719283	5722584	Because that's what's been happening to me on World of Warcraft these past couple weeks.
5722924	5725486	Tech came to my house and everything, said he couldn't find anything wrong.
5725506	5727968	I'm like, yeah, I guess I'm just fucking crazy, huh?
5727988	5729169	That's just our crappy service.
5729189	5729629	That's right.
5730230	5730810	It's a feature.
5731011	5732211	So anyhow, whatever.
5732972	5741038	So he finally got booted, whether it was by Microsoft or his cable provider, who knows, but it was at 11 o'clock or just before 11 o'clock Pacific time, May 10th, 2010.
5742640	5747644	He was out of Halo 2, which means that's it for the original Xbox Live.
5747664	5749986	That was the official last connection on Xbox Live.
5750786	5761491	Rest in pieces Rest in pieces Rest in pieces Rest in pieces Rest in pieces Rest in pieces Rest in pieces Rest in pieces Rest in pieces Rest in pieces
5780440	5781821	It's called RetroVision.
5782222	5785984	And you plug the car into the Nintendo, put your Game Boy game in there, and you're good to go.
5786525	5788326	This is even more awesome.
5788806	5792749	It has the expansion port on it too, so you can use your Game Boy printer.
5793189	5794270	Remember the Game Boy printer?
5794650	5796952	What a worthless piece of shit that thing was, huh?
5796972	5797392	Huh?
5798833	5801594	Didn't they have like a hidden DJ game in that though?
5802535	5803895	The printer software?
5804716	5805656	The what software?
5805796	5808057	The printer software that came with the actual printer.
5808137	5808538	Does it?
5808698	5809298	I don't remember.
5809578	5809798	Yeah.
5810118	5812319	There's a little like game in there.
5813580	5814060	I don't remember.
5814120	5814820	I didn't own one.
5814860	5815601	I didn't pay for one.
5816041	5816241	All right.
5816841	5820283	I just remember seeing the features and I thought, gee, that was stupid.
5820683	5822224	Can I print my own receipts on it?
5824004	5824645	Ooh, that might be good.
5824685	5824965	I don't know.
5826071	5827773	Game Room updates.
5828394	5829675	Now we have to start covering these too.
5829695	5832038	We got Rock Band releases, Virtual Console releases.
5832078	5833600	Now we have Game Room releases as well.
5834381	5838466	This week you missed Battlezone, Canyon Bomber, Keystone Capers for the 2600.
5839147	5841710	Canyon Bomber is also the 2600 version, not the arcade version.
5842350	5843612	Megazone for the arcade.
5844012	5848193	Night Driver for the Atari 2600, Oink for the 2600, and Soccer for the Intellivision.
5848553	5854155	Interesting thing about Game Room, the game packs that you're downloading are actually two weeks worth of games.
5854355	5856655	It's just that half of them stay locked for a week.
5857135	5863157	So if you downloaded something that was in last week's pack, like Pitfall, you already had this week's pack waiting to go.
5865838	5873342	Game Pack 1 and 2 are like 15 games apiece, so Game Pack 3 rolls around and it's another 50 megabytes.
5873402	5874563	It's actually 15 more games.
5874863	5875223	Go figure.
5875783	5884088	Well, some of the games have been announced for the next pack that is coming out, and that is going to be coming out on May 19th, because it looks like, what, is that Wednesday is going to be Game Room Day?
5885128	5886849	Asteroids for the arcade.
5886889	5889711	We already have Asteroids Deluxe, but you get original Asteroids this time.
5890211	5919230	Demons to Diamonds was a 2600 game that's coming out this week as well Grand Prix from Activision Shark Shark Space Duel it was an arcade game it was kind of like a souped up Asteroids I guess you could say probably I think the biggest release this week Stampede is coming out this week on the 2600 oh I have fond memories of Stampede when we went to the Classic Gaming Expo I participated in like the official Stampede scoreboard that Twin Galaxies was doing I think I got like next to last place I'm that good at Stampede
5920291	5936414	Time Pilot is also coming out May 19th but Time Pilot's already available on Xbox Live just so you know for five bucks and you get the souped up version so if you want to buy Time Pilot for Game Room that's on you but you'll get the opportunity this week to buy it all over again if you want.
5937035	5937815	It's all about money.
5938015	5938435	That's right.
5938495	5939455	Money, money, money.
5939955	5947717	And speaking of all about money how about our Rock Band releases for the week as
5949981	5951142	What is wrong with my computer?
5953162	5953983	Well, where do I begin?
5954283	5954743	I'm just kidding.
5955043	5956144	Rob, seriously.
5956164	5957024	Did it freeze up or something?
5957184	5960585	No, it's opening 50,000 windows when I'm trying to... Yikes.
5961446	5962526	Spam, spam, spam.
5962866	5963166	No.
5963607	5964127	Lose weight.
5964187	5965507	Increase your penis size.
5965527	5966648	Et cetera, et cetera.
5966748	5967228	Hold on.
5968028	5968268	Yes.
5968809	5971630	No, because it's completely screwing up now, so... All right, that's fine.
5971670	5972730	I'll go to some chat room comments.
5972790	5977472	Chat.OrangeSoundsRadio.com Salacious Pop says, Demons and Diamonds was a paddle game, though.
5977572	5979113	It was a big twisty knob.
5979833	5982215	Paddle and trackball for Game Room, please.
5982595	5989801	I somewhat agree, although I don't think at the end of the day I would be able to justify buying a trackball for my Xbox because I know it would cost like $30 to $40.
5990462	5991483	And what am I going to play with it?
5992163	5993024	Crystal Castles.
5993685	5994305	Woo!
5995426	5995746	I don't know.
5996847	5999669	Although, you know, in theory, they do need to have better support for that stuff.
5999689	6001191	Somebody could probably hack that together.
6001211	6007436	Playing Crystal Castles on the joystick or the little Xbox 360 controller just stinks.
6008257	6008657	It stinks.
6009232	6012074	All right, so we have... I've got everything pulled up now.
6012694	6014095	I had to basically reload it all.
6015116	6018579	Our rock band download content actually is pretty cool.
6018619	6027325	We've got a Grateful Dead pack, which includes Beat It On Down The Line, Cumberland Blues, Scarlet Begonias, Throwing Stones, Touch Of Grey, and U.S.
6027405	6027725	Blues.
6027905	6029426	And then two songs by The Smithereens.
6029826	6030887	I like The Smithereens.
6030947	6032989	It's one of my groups I really liked when I was in high school.
6033649	6035830	It's A Girl Like You and Only A Memory.
6036711	6037872	Those are both really good songs.
6040372	6046055	For some Project Natal news, their big event is going to have a Cirque du Soleil performance.
6047637	6049478	Ooh, Cirque du Soleil.
6050098	6056583	But it'll be on June 13th, so look forward to feats of flexibility.
6056883	6058944	Or as my friend calls it, Cirque du Sogay.
6059525	6060065	I know, right?
6061746	6062106	And then...
6063922	6064442	Bayonetta!
6065363	6071668	The director, Kamiya Hideki, he basically doesn't like that there's Bayonetta doujinshi.
6072408	6079574	Like, hentai doujinshi about Bayonetta getting it on.
6079994	6081855	Well, I mean, she's kind of sexy.
6081895	6084637	That means that you've got a popular product, hi.
6085298	6093004	The more, you know, I have personally... Sega should be fucking excited that they have like a new franchise here, you know what I mean?
6094935	6095335	He, he, he
6110535	6122884	It seems there's pornographic doujinshi based off Bayonetta.
6122944	6128168	There are fans who will resent that, and I hardly think those responsible hold any love for the game.
6128648	6130390	Dude, get your head out your butt, dude.
6131330	6136731	Um, there was though, um, Chris, is it Dallin or Dalen?
6137111	6138952	Um, there's a quote from him and I actually like this.
6139532	6147454	And this is actually a point that I've had with, you know, some of these games that guys can go and get outfits for their female characters.
6147774	6155016	And, you know, I always laughed that WrestleMania was like dress up for, for boys, you know, cause they could customize their wrestler and, you know, um,
6156056	6180556	but the quote is saying guys tell themselves they shouldn't listen to fashion they're terrified if they spend enough time playing as Bayonetta being Bayonetta and witnessing the power of her high heels and endless tresses well at some point they'll stop objectifying her they'll want to be her she won't invite our gaze as much as grip it until she sucked us into a vortex of overpowering femininity I like that a vortex of overpowering femininity that should be on the box
6184719	6187220	Can we get an iTunes review for our show that says that?
6190362	6191142	Boo power!
6192523	6194824	A vortex of overpowering femininity.
6194864	6196285	Is that what they're calling her bits now?
6197986	6198886	It's a vortex.
6199847	6201908	Alright, some other gaming news.
6201988	6206090	And of course we'll get to the Skype line, the mailbag, and all that fun stuff in just a little bit.
6206550	6209532	But some other news stories first, starting off with Loki.
6210312	6210552	Yes.
6211673	6214134	You know, it's like every week we hear about another...
6215154	6222818	Game franchise being turned into a movie and each one was perceived with more of an eye roll than the next.
6223278	6224459	Well, this shouldn't be a surprise.
6225159	6229821	Rollercoaster Tycoon is now becoming a movie thanks to Sony Pictures.
6231082	6231262	What?
6232574	6233395	How's that even work?
6234316	6238419	It's just going to be a movie about people liking theme parks and building theme parks.
6239420	6247207	It'll be some stupid plot like, you know, roller coaster park A versus B, like some scandal.
6248287	6252191	It's just going to be like Wall Street, but cute and about theme parks.
6254273	6254513	Right?
6255374	6256154	It's going to be awful.
6257195	6257435	Awful.
6258817	6259137	I don't know.
6259972	6262793	Would anybody really want to watch Roller Coaster Tycoon?
6262833	6263213	I don't know.
6263673	6269754	Well, it's being developed as a live-action CGI hybrid at Sony Pictures Animation.
6269814	6270754	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
6270874	6272274	Is it going to be in 3D?
6273074	6273734	Oh, probably.
6276375	6284776	And I guess it's being worked on by Harold Zwart, the director of the upcoming Karate Kid remake.
6285837	6287897	He will be taking an executive producer role.
6289727	6295252	Alright, before we get to more news, I completely forgot to do a segment that we usually do on the show.
6296152	6296933	Twitter topics.
6298314	6298574	Oops.
6299015	6299675	We should do those now.
6299735	6300376	Twitter topics!
6301276	6309063	Every week you send us your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR and we read some of our favorite tweets live on air here.
6310344	6311465	If I remember to do them.
6313171	6313772	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6336950	6338391	I guess these guys got injured.
6339631	6346994	It was Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, and he was playing against a few friends, and his mother asked him to get his daughter's PJs.
6348355	6350756	Wait, so your mother had to tell you to get your daughter's PJs?
6350876	6351316	Oh boy.
6351816	6363801	Alright, so he didn't realize that the Xbox Live headset was wrapped around his chair's arm, so when he got up quickly, bam, the wire got caught and the head smashed right into my Mac, which was sitting on a stereo a few feet off the ground.
6363821	6363861	Ow!
6364281	6364321	Ow!
6366238	6369180	So he got up quickly and bam, hit his head.
6369240	6370880	That looks hurtful.
6372641	6376924	So he went to the hospital and thanks to... I love this.
6377184	6382827	But a few hours later he was online fragging again thanks to a real life painkiller perk prescribed by the doctor.
6385666	6386786	Thank you, BikeItIn!
6387747	6389067	Alright, there you go.
6389107	6393808	Thank you, TigerClaw305 on Twitter for sending us that link.
6393909	6396349	Tweets from BlueSwim here.
6396689	6404072	Twitter question, what franchise that hasn't had a game yet during the current generation would you like to see get a modern game?
6406552	6411634	What game that hasn't gotten a modern game yet during this generation would you like to see get a game?
6411974	6414315	Well, there's always the good old standby, the Guardian Legend.
6414535	6415055	I mean, hello.
6416236	6416957	or Kid Icarus.
6417078	6419601	There's always a lot of people clamoring to get a new Kid Icarus game.
6419621	6420623	I want a new Fantasy Zone.
6421163	6422045	A new Fantasy Zone?
6422325	6422565	Yeah.
6422766	6423727	Okay, that's fair.
6423927	6425249	The Adventures of Opa Opa!
6425369	6426270	We got Afterburner.
6426411	6429575	There's like a new Afterburner with a climb and a lot of the old stuff is new again.
6430556	6432900	Maybe for them to finally release Planet Harrier?
6433913	6436857	Here's my number one answer though, in all honesty, Blue Swim.
6436897	6440480	Especially if you want to go just to the last generation of something we haven't seen yet.
6441461	6442763	F-Zero.
6443363	6443984	K-Thanks.
6444264	6446467	That's the one game I really would like to see a new one of.
6446847	6453214	Except, unfortunately, I think if I really want to like a new F-Zero game, it's going to have to be on the Xbox or the PlayStation 3.
6453254	6453474	And, uh...
6455516	6456538	That's not going to happen.
6456618	6458302	They already tried it there and it sucked.
6458662	6459003	Did they?
6459484	6461949	You remember it was at a game from Koei?
6462870	6463672	I played Wipeout.
6463712	6464914	Wipeout HD is kind of fun.
6465055	6465355	It's cool.
6467249	6495478	Sagan our chatroom says Star Fox that's a good one too but it has to be actual Star Fox not the adventures or what the hell was that on the gate what the hell what the hell fuck adventures yeah star fucking adventures all right let's see also blue swim wants to give an FYI hey did you know that Amazon is giving a $20 gaming credit on your next order when you buy Super Mario Galaxy 2 from them no I did not know that but I probably won't be buying Mario Galaxy 2 my Wii isn't even hooked up right now
6496619	6499544	is not going to get hooked up again until Metroid Other M comes out.
6499584	6500286	I'm telling you right now.
6500746	6505655	Unless Mario Galaxy 2, like I play it at someone else's house and I'm like, oh my god, I'm missing out.
6505775	6507058	Oh my god, oh my god.
6507847	6515571	But there's just so many other games coming out right now between Blur and Split Second and all these other racing games that I'm just like, you know what?
6516191	6516371	Yeah.
6517532	6521014	Hey, Rababa's in chat and suggests The Adventures of Lolo.
6521134	6522134	And yes, I'm serious.
6522174	6527297	Hey, Lolo was actually a pretty freaking rad NES game that never really got a new version.
6527617	6531521	You know what else was on the old school NES that I don't remember ever seeing later?
6532922	6535325	I bet Jamie would know more about this, but she left the room real quick.
6535425	6536806	Mylon Secret Castle.
6536906	6537587	Remember that game?
6538067	6538728	Good times.
6539549	6540390	Did they ever do a sequel?
6540410	6541691	I think they did do one sequel.
6541711	6542091	A little one.
6543272	6549436	DarkTest Studio wants to plug the latest retro rear view all about the X68000.
6549857	6551738	It's on our website at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6551758	6552138	Check it out.
6552218	6553079	Retro rear view.
6553239	6554980	Actual content on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6555120	6556801	I saw an actual game review on there, too.
6556901	6557382	I know.
6557462	6558302	What's this about?
6558322	6560244	I was like, wait, this is in our site?
6560264	6562005	Our community is awesome.
6562325	6563466	We don't have to do anything.
6563566	6563866	All right.
6564526	6568309	I'd put reviews on there, but by the time I get around to putting a review up there, it's too late.
6568429	6568969	Oh, shit.
6569150	6570150	X-Link in chat room.
6570490	6571191	Excellent choice.
6571271	6572051	StarTropics 3.
6573613	6574133	EASP is a service
6595373	6611282	Um, sure, why don't I link, uh, read this one, TigerClaw305 sends us another, uh, uh, Twitter topic, uh, it's a link from MTV Multiplayer blog, apparently, uh, Cliffy B, uh, has said that...
6612563	6614703	Mass Effect, let me read this quote here.
6614763	6619524	Quote, the thing that was cool was that Mass Effect is kind of an RPG for me with the cover-based shooting.
6619864	6623065	I think there's a reason why it's been successful, because gamers love Gears.
6623485	6623965	Oh, God.
6624965	6626586	Just take your ego and shove it up your ass.
6627186	6628366	Here's something like that.
6628646	6634587	I would like to thank myself and our series, Gears of War, for making Mass Effect 2 such a great game.
6634767	6638168	Because if I hadn't put my game out, no one would know what first-person shooters are.
6638208	6638728	And they wouldn't know...
6639148	6663423	Epic first person shooters can be You know what, with all due respect I'm awesome I'm not going to read the rest of the story because I don't give a shit what he thinks Yes, I'm also awesome Thank you TigerClaw for trying I'll just tell you in a nutshell He says Mass Effect is the Star Wars for the new generation I'm the dang cook of the game programming industry You are like the episode 2 of this generation The Yoda fight was cool
6665290	6667191	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6686360	6686901	Let's see here.
6687121	6693804	And last tweet I'm going to read here from Jay Jugo says, Scarezo in chat.
6693844	6694524	That's how I say it.
6694624	6695305	Scarezo.
6696265	6697286	I should have known that.
6697306	6698326	Oh, well, whatever.
6698366	6700727	Scarezo, thanks you for mentioning the double down.
6701027	6702848	This is my first live OLR show.
6703248	6704609	So far, so epic.
6704649	6708871	And also wants to send a quick thank you to Jamie for your pick for the classic game of the week.
6709271	6710112	Oh, well, you're quite welcome.
6710152	6710372	Woot.
6712964	6713964	I remember, whatever happened to that?
6741357	6744659	It's coming out this fall, but it's actually not just coming out on the Wii this time.
6744719	6748161	It's actually going to be coming out on 360 and PlayStation 3 as well as the Wii.
6748241	6748901	Well done.
6749382	6750942	Please tell me it's a budget title.
6751903	6752543	I don't remember.
6753424	6754304	I don't remember that part.
6754604	6755685	Is it still called Rock of the Dead?
6755705	6756786	It's still called Rock of the Dead.
6756966	6757246	Awesome.
6758976	6769926	Look, and I realize you guys are saying, like, you know, and I seem to remember when Rock of the Dead first came up on this show, a lot of people were saying, lawsuit, it's gonna be a lawsuit, but, like, seriously, after playing 3D.GameHeroes, it's a parody!
6770626	6772168	That's all they have to say, it's a parody!
6773709	6781696	Like, Loki, when you play 3D.GameHeroes and DarkSakura, if you do at some point, you know, you really should check it out, because it'll tickle your retro funny bone.
6782277	6782337	Uh...
6782757	6785238	Tell me it's not just a complete effing rip-off of Zelda.
6785258	6786859	Oh, I could tell that without playing it.
6787039	6787839	But that's okay.
6788260	6788920	I'm fine with that.
6789020	6790060	Zelda's a good game.
6790341	6792221	It needs to be ripped off more often.
6794082	6795343	Hey, there was already Newtopia.
6796380	6799122	Alright, huge news this week.
6799282	6803165	Everybody's been talking about this and we gotta say something about this too.
6803265	6805966	Steam for the Mac came out this week.
6806067	6810129	It included 57 games at launch, including Torchlight.
6810269	6812031	That's actually a game I played a little bit of this week.
6812311	6813211	I like me some Torchlight.
6813632	6818035	It was out there for $10 on Steam for the Mac, but the best deal of all...
6818988	6819408	Free.
6820129	6820850	Free game.
6821010	6821491	Portal.
6821731	6822171	Free.
6822451	6823352	Zero dollars.
6824273	6824734	Free.
6825074	6825535	Nothing.
6826255	6827296	Till May 24th.
6827717	6834924	And they didn't want the Mac users to have all the fun there because if they only gave it away for free on the Mac, you'd have people like Loki that would be like, meh, meh, meh, meh.
6835885	6836846	That's my Loki impression.
6836906	6837807	Meh, meh, meh.
6839068	6839428	I downloaded it.
6857850	6860172	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, she even bought the Pink Anus game.
6883598	6884819	I did buy the Pink Anus game.
6885840	6886421	And you know what?
6886641	6887281	It's crap.
6889263	6891845	But she bought it, and that's all they care about at the end of the day.
6892546	6894148	Yeah.
6894328	6896310	It's... Read ratings, please, people.
6896710	6899793	SSJ100Matt says, Can't get any cheaper than free unless you're Yaris.
6900613	6900874	True.
6901514	6906299	Seg in our chatroom says, They needed to demonstrate the Steam Play concept, so it's free on both platforms.
6906499	6907019	Absolutely.
6907059	6908180	It's kind of the Trojan horse.
6908240	6909642	But, you know, it...
6911204	6912746	It's a win-win situation.
6912966	6914449	You win because you get a free game.
6914469	6920017	And to reference the other chat comment, you don't get some crappy free game.
6920077	6924905	You get a great game of the year caliber game for free.
6925766	6936157	but the trade-off is they win because they just installed your thing on your computer so you're not tempted to go get, you know, Direct to Drive or the Windows gaming platform which, granted, I know is not on the Mac but, you know, you know what I mean.
6936918	6937319	Same thing.
6937379	6942704	They get that on your computer and then you're seeing all the sales and you're like, oh shit, I can get Torchlight for $10.
6943365	6944126	Maybe I should get that.
6946115	6946715	So there you go.
6947476	6948536	All of that's available on the Mac.
6948576	6951297	Some of the other games you might want to check out that are available on the Mac right now.
6951377	6956019	Braid, let's see, is a big one.
6956059	6957259	Some of the Indiana Jones games.
6957439	6958880	Loom, you can play on the Mac now.
6959600	6959900	Yes.
6960660	6967983	Sam & Max Devil's Playhouse, Tales of Monkey Island Season 1, Torchlight, which I definitely recommend.
6968223	6972265	If you even just thought Diablo 2 was kind of cool, you should get Torchlight.
6973125	6974846	It's because it's pretty much the same fucking game.
6976066	6992039	and uh but better Civ 4 which of course you know I have a big boner for all things Civilization so I'm excited uh that the Mac fans can play that on Steam although I think that was I think Civ 4 was already available on the Mac I could be wrong all right more news mailbag coming up in a
7000931	7004534	about the rating system in Australia.
7005295	7021349	There is, and actually it's a fairly, I would have to say, a big percentage of proofs that there should be, 98% actually said that there should be an R18 plus rating, so where things are restricted to 18 and over.
7023591	7027755	It's been proposed before, but now it's like, that's what the people want, so...
7030074	7030494	Who knows?
7030614	7044783	But there's actually, though, some from other special interest groups, though, that were saying that only 53% actually approve of it.
7044884	7046985	But, eh, numbers lie.
7049309	7052112	Statistics can be budged.
7052752	7061681	It's funny you talk about statistics because some of the interesting chats, comments I'm reading right now about the whole Steam thing, they're a little delayed, so we get comments from the last story.
7062442	7071270	Seg is saying, now we'll have stats for how many Mac users will buy games, or to clarify, publicly accessible stats for Mac users who will buy games.
7072251	7072652	Interesting.
7073572	7100952	uh some other comments Robert M says I've been anticipating Torchlight for quite some time but didn't want to invest in Windows 7 and partitioning for boot camp uh Donovan says he'll wait for Diablo 3 okay so yourself but I think Torchlight's uh pretty good the one thing Torchlight's missing is multiplayer but seriously it's like 10 bucks that's that's great it's a great deal for a single player game it really is anyhow uh all right so uh moving on with some more news stories Loki
7101789	7116655	Yes, so it's interesting because there's already been screenshots of people, or not really screenshots, but people taking pictures of Red Dead Redemption because it's been coming in early to a few different stores.
7116775	7126719	And one of the screenshots, or I should say box shots that they got of the game on PlayStation 3 shows that there's some exclusive content included for the PlayStation 3 version.
7127180	7127340	Now...
7128320	7128580	JonBoy!
7128600	7128801	JonBoy!
7149819	7151760	Yes, this is exclusive for the PlayStation 3.
7153360	7165005	Not quite as wonderful as exclusive download content like that was on Grand Theft Auto episodes from Liberty City, but maybe this stuff will come out later on as something paid for on the Xbox 360.
7165305	7168986	I know there is some more free download content coming out later on, so who knows.
7169287	7171367	But hey, anything extra is kind of good.
7171487	7175369	So if you're getting on the PS3, there's a little bonus for you.
7175549	7175949	Who knows?
7176130	7179613	It might be enough to sway some people, even if it's like a little thing.
7179693	7180373	You never know.
7180574	7181434	People that have both.
7182696	7183997	It's not that big a deal.
7184337	7190923	There's tons of outfits you can get in the game and lots of different things you can find, safe houses and stuff.
7190963	7196748	I don't really know if this stuff is really going to do it for you, but whatever.
7197329	7200952	If you really want to get into both systems, you're not sure which one, maybe that'll sway you.
7202714	7204215	All right, some other news coming out this week.
7204255	7206256	How many of y'all have seen the movie Cube?
7206276	7207737	It was a little indie film.
7207757	7209698	I love Cube 2.
7211278	7212279	But not the original Cube.
7212359	7218822	No, I like the first one, but the second one... Okay, just to go say a little bit about it.
7219263	7222584	It's an indie film, and describe what Cube is about.
7222604	7223685	But you've got to start with the first one.
7224025	7225607	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7240940	7255136	and so as it goes they they each run into each other as they go through the cube and find out that each of them has a specific skill some people have been left with their glasses some people have been left with you know something in their pocket there's a crazy lady um
7255877	7257139	And her skill is being crazy.
7257499	7258461	No, she was the doctor, right?
7258801	7259742	Yeah, the doctor.
7259903	7267693	But it's that these people are stuck in the cube.
7268273	7270056	And their whole point is trying to figure out the way out.
7270196	7273380	And basically, while they're moving from room to room...
7274421	7278107	Oh, no, they didn't have... Cube 2 was the one with Crazy Lady.
7278427	7279769	The first one had the autistic boy.
7279989	7280209	Yes.
7282453	7285877	They basically find out that the rooms are moving.
7287179	7287840	OMG, spoiler.
7288261	7288641	That's fine.
7290183	7292284	It's like over 10 years old at this point.
7292364	7304208	And that basically the autistic boy is some sort of savant with numbers and figures out that it's like prime numbers go into the right room and they figure out which way the rooms are going to be that lead to the exit.
7304388	7304548	Right.
7304628	7305308	Where the exit is.
7305328	7311430	So it's all... And now Cube 2, I love it because it's called Hypercube, meaning a tesseract.
7311550	7313051	Wait, it's not Electric Boogaloo?
7313763	7313963	No.
7313983	7319651	I mean, I like that one because I love theoretical physics.
7321153	7322434	I don't have the brain for math or anything.
7322454	7323395	I just love reading about it.
7323656	7325999	Wait, so the cube was like traveling through time and space as well?
7326299	7326740	Exactly.
7326900	7327120	Wow.
7327140	7328542	The fourth dimension being time.
7328922	7329123	Wow.
7329523	7338868	So, and it had like this really weird ending, and also the Cube 2 inspired a whole mod for Half-Life.
7339489	7341510	Wasn't there a Cube 0 at some point too, or a Cube 3?
7341810	7344972	The third one was Cube 0, which was like a prequel, and it was crap.
7345332	7345612	Okay.
7346072	7348274	Well, how would you like to play a video game based off Cube?
7349395	7350036	She's raising her hand.
7350396	7352458	It might actually happen, believe it or not.
7352578	7357963	It's an interview that Vincenzo is his name, Vincenzo Natale.
7358464	7364049	He was the director of the game, and he was talking to MTV about the film Splice, which is an upcoming movie that he did.
7364930	7368613	They, for whatever reason, asked him about Cube if he ever wanted to revisit the universe.
7368933	7371756	He said, I would very much like to do a Cube game.
7372176	7373097	I'd love to do a game.
7373397	7378582	When I was writing it with my writing partner, we were saying to each other, are we writing a film or are we writing a game?
7378942	7381965	It's always been amazing to me that no one has attempted to turn it into a game.
7382085	7383246	I would very much like to do that.
7383787	7385548	That's how I would like to get back into the Cube world.
7385588	7386969	I guess that's true because there was the mod, right?
7386989	7387490	That's what I'm saying.
7387510	7388791	There was the mod based on Hypercube.
7388891	7390072	He probably hasn't seen it.
7391061	7394523	And someone actually recreated the end of the movie using Gary's mod.
7395224	7398185	It does have a real creepster ending to it, actually.
7398446	7399867	The whole movie's kind of a downer.
7400547	7405030	And then it really leaves you with more questions than you start the movie with.
7405050	7405990	But it wasn't a bad movie.
7406010	7408032	It was just kind of like, the fuck?
7408712	7409973	That was my reaction at the end.
7409993	7411774	It was like, the fuck?
7411994	7414936	It's a movie that I think everyone needs to see at least once.
7415356	7415676	You know what?
7415756	7422542	In a movie that leaves you talking... And for a low-budget movie, it was intelligently done, I think.
7423183	7425244	It's definitely one that's a thinker, too.
7425384	7426505	So would it be a low-budget game?
7427446	7427987	Perhaps.
7428627	7432250	Well, given that you probably only need to make one environment over and over.
7433891	7434192	True.
7434212	7436874	Well, you know, when they did... That's how they made the movie cheap.
7437414	7439976	They seriously used the same room and they turned them around.
7440077	7444580	And when they did Cube 2, it was also relatively inexpensive.
7444620	7447423	They just had those white walls with different lights behind them.
7447683	7448063	Easy, easy.
7451398	7453839	Nobody has to bother, by the way, with the third movie.
7453999	7461121	SSJ100Matt is suggesting, Jamie, if you like theoretical physics, I would tell you to check out the movie What the Bleep Do We Know?
7461441	7462261	I've heard of that movie.
7462541	7464402	I've been wanting to see it, actually.
7464802	7466402	You might have to Netflix that or something.
7467163	7471404	In the meantime, though, Jamie has no time to Netflix because she has to dive into the mailbag.
7472364	7483889	and read your emails at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Every week you guys send us emails to our Mailbag and DarkSakura will jump in, read a few, possibly criticize their grammar and then we'll answer your questions here on the show.
7484009	7489592	Again, that's Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Although more and more people have been submitting them through the website recently.
7489632	7490933	I guess there's a form you can fill out.
7490973	7498136	Deekman makes the magic happen on the website and he made it magical where people send us bleeps through the website now.
7498867	7502490	And Dragonboy69 is actually sending us a tech support question.
7503631	7507353	But I have to read this because I don't know if Loki will laugh.
7508394	7510015	I'm not sure if you can assist me with my issue.
7510055	7513718	I have an iMac and just attempted to sign up to your site.
7513978	7517060	However, when trying to log in, it goes to white screen with the words invalid token.
7517380	7518601	Is this because I'm on an iMac?
7519662	7522403	Thank you in advance for any help you can provide me with this matter.
7522723	7524704	No, I don't think it's because you're on an iMac.
7526044	7526684	We'll help you later.
7526844	7531966	I've seen the website do that before and I think it's because a lot of people hit it at once sometimes.
7532006	7533266	Believe it or not, we're kind of popular.
7533326	7534647	Use Firefox, not Safari.
7536343	7540126	Also, just reload, or use your back button and try to log in again.
7540606	7542207	Usually it will kind of work itself out.
7542307	7545089	If it keeps doing it to you, come back after like an hour.
7545169	7546790	We honestly don't know what causes it.
7547170	7558398	Unfortunately, our website is a popular target for spammers, and when they clog up the pipes with their poop, then it kind of prevents the rest of us from logging in, but it has nothing to do with the fact that you're on an iMac, as far as we know.
7558838	7560579	The website's worked on a Mac for me before.
7561000	7562161	It wasn't an iMac, granted, but...
7562981	7563221	Alright.
7564002	7564863	Hello, OLR.
7565503	7566904	I look forward to your show every week.
7567064	7568745	I do have a couple of questions for OLR.
7569266	7574710	What Sega Model 1 or 2 or Model 3 arcade games urgently needs an Xbox Live conversion?
7575150	7575590	Oh, heavens.
7576071	7578613	I'm really looking forward to Daytona USA or Scud Race.
7578733	7581475	Is it called Super GT in the US?
7581755	7582235	I think so.
7582776	7586018	Also, I think Super Hang-On needs a good update like Sega did to OutRun.
7586779	7587499	I would agree with that.
7588140	7589301	Are you guys... Okay, yeah.
7589381	7590001	That's the first one.
7590021	7591202	What do you think would make a good...
7592683	7593023	Release.
7594544	7603609	If they had some sort of gun controller, any of the gun games would be good, like Gunblade or even, you know, House of the Dead or that kind of stuff.
7603729	7605490	Planet Harrier.
7606190	7607291	That's Hikari, though.
7607311	7607771	I don't care.
7607891	7608612	Planet Harrier.
7612334	7616676	Can we get... No, I'm kidding.
7616916	7618097	Actually, that wouldn't be bad.
7618117	7620258	I mean, you could even have steering wheel support.
7620438	7621979	And maybe it wouldn't have draw-in.
7623536	7624237	That would be cool.
7624837	7629081	Are you guys planning on a new show for foreign listeners after the mishaps of your previous effort?
7629841	7630422	Ooh, that's right.
7630802	7634325	Wasn't the Euro show when the last computer just finally died?
7634505	7635266	It exploded, yeah.
7635286	7635826	That's right.
7637167	7637868	Let's pick a date.
7638108	7641771	We will have to do that, but it's going to have to be like in June at least.
7643072	7643232	Yeah.
7644413	7650638	It's going to be sometime... It'll have to be at least June because next week I'm going to literally be running in here at the last second because I'm going on a trip.
7651539	7651779	But...
7653380	7681723	and the weekend after by the way we won't be here Memorial Day weekend we will not be here at least I won't be here and I think that Rob's gonna be getting some shush I'm going to Oregon on a getaway so we're doing that and so I'm not gonna be here and I imagine a lot of listeners are probably gonna be doing their vacations and stuff too so we'll not be here Memorial Day weekend but sometime either June maybe July maybe like 4th of July weekend or something cause that'll be a long weekend too we can do something
7681883	7682564	We could do something.
7682864	7685666	But I don't think that we should plan it around a major holiday.
7686226	7687087	You know what we should do?
7687527	7691710	Is the 4th of July weekend just start at 8 in the morning and then finish late at night.
7691790	7693772	Although Bobby will probably want to do a show somewhere in there.
7695113	7695673	Figure something out.
7695874	7697315	We'll have to figure something out.
7697435	7699276	We also need to do another road show.
7700397	7700877	Good times.
7701057	7701378	Road show.
7701478	7702899	And last question to DarkSakura.
7702919	7704180	Why are there no more Rob floods?
7704280	7704940	I really miss them.
7705421	7706121	Okay, you asked for it.
7706141	7706902	I don't know.
7707622	7710665	Rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub, rub.
7711690	7712110	What?
7713330	7713610	Hi.
7714331	7714791	Die!
7716211	7716751	Well, that's it.
7717191	7719792	Thanks for making a show nearly every week.
7719892	7721753	It's a real relief to listen to OLR.
7721773	7725393	Your lighthearted view on things is very welcome in a world that's way too serious.
7725453	7727274	Thank you very much, Fabrice from Belgium.
7727594	7727854	P.S.
7727894	7730915	Was my spelling and grammar okay?
7730955	7732595	You didn't put a question mark at the end of okay.
7733815	7735656	Other than that, spot on.
7735696	7738837	But he's from Belgium, so he gets a little... They have question marks in Belgium!
7742258	7744681	That's funny.
7744701	7746123	A question from our chat room.
7746203	7748907	Wetu in our chat room asks, what is Memorial Day for?
7749288	7754035	I don't know if maybe he's Canadian or from a foreign country or maybe one of the Americans that doesn't know the difference.
7754395	7755096	Here it is, quickly.
7755577	7756939	In the US, there's two...
7757239	7758219	Thanks for watching!
7778264	7788827	Veterans Day is the day that's in November, and that's the day to honor those that are still serving or alive and used to serve a veteran.
7788907	7792048	So one for those that have passed away, one for those that are still alive, basically.
7792909	7800931	In other words, Memorial Day would be like for my papa, my grandfather, and Veterans Day would be like for my brother.
7801231	7804012	But both days, great sales at Macy's.
7806773	7807554	Tell me I'm wrong.
7807995	7808656	Tell me I'm wrong.
7810738	7810978	Sorry.
7812080	7814383	I just read a message from Becky.
7814683	7817747	She said I made her snort by saying there's question marks in Belgium.
7817767	7820750	Well, there are indeed question marks in Belgium.
7820770	7821151	You're right.
7823830	7830393	It's been a while since I've had a chance to email you guys.
7830693	7833034	Last time Loki had turned me under Earth Defense Force on 360.
7835075	7835955	Still playing, by the way.
7836095	7838577	My question is in regards to the zombie talk from last week.
7839017	7844519	You guys talked about what music you would kill zombies to, but where would you set up HQ?
7844799	7847961	My roommate and I have argued between a Super Walmart, a mall, and a Costco.
7848641	7850623	PS, sorry if the grammar is bad.
7850983	7854347	Had a 14 hour work day and I'm typing in the dark so that I do not wake the wife.
7854887	7855448	Good husband.
7856069	7861013	And by the way, I only give people a hard time if they're really, really, really crappy.
7863256	7864497	Where would I set up shop?
7866659	7870143	Sorry, I was flooding the chat room because they needed a spanking.
7870223	7871084	What was the question here?
7871997	7876944	It's, um, we talked about what music we would kill zombies to, but where would we set up HQ?
7877384	7881390	My roommate and I would argue, is Super Walmart a mall or Costco?
7884468	7888970	Well, Dead Rising was set in a mall and I guess that did pretty well for Frank West.
7888990	7891091	We could say an amusement park like Zombieland.
7891151	7891951	Ooh, that would be fun.
7893012	7893772	Or a museum.
7894652	7896293	Might be fun too and especially scary.
7896313	7897653	And who'd look for me in a museum?
7899234	7899894	The zoo.
7901435	7901915	Fort Knox.
7902916	7904696	Ooh, good guess.
7905077	7905297	Area 51.
7907634	7918168	Or Studio 54 So you can get your club on and kill zombies My mom's house The Space Shuttle
7919079	7920539	Try to get me up here, zombies.
7921060	7924401	Rob, Rob, why are there zombies outside?
7924581	7927642	Rob, Rob, get rid of the zombies.
7928282	7930743	Do you know, this neighborhood has already gone to hell.
7931203	7932643	Why are there zombies out front?
7932823	7933144	Rob.
7934284	7935224	She would annoy them away.
7935244	7935824	It would be great.
7935984	7938005	You know zombies would never make it in the south?
7939426	7943307	Especially out in the rural south, just because of how many people have freaking guns.
7944907	7946868	There'd probably be some good eating in New Orleans.
7947273	7947513	Anyway.
7949074	7949995	Oh, Robaba.
7950755	7951516	No, not Robaba.
7951596	7952717	Robaba sent us an email.
7952877	7953577	Yeah, okay, here we go.
7954058	7957440	I listened to your conversation about the Black Wii bundle leak, in quotes.
7957900	7960822	The correspondence between Nintendo and GameStop sounded totally fake, i.e.
7960883	7961603	viral marketing.
7961783	7963104	Nintendo, bad dog.
7963144	7967427	That leak totally advertised our new bundle a very convenient week before release.
7967727	7971870	GameStop, we fired the guy and we'll never do it again unless you ask us to again.
7972250	7973872	Nintendo, okay, but just this once.
7974152	7974792	Well played.
7975152	7975453	Okay.
7976394	7980459	Also, Nintendo knows after all these years how to prevent this type of leak.
7981140	7984645	Sending the promo standees every week ahead of time sounded intentional.
7985905	7987066	Yep, probably was.
7989569	7995977	The more and more I hear about it, the more and more I think it was just kind of like one of those leaks to actually get people talking about the Black We.
7996397	7997478	Can I read some chat comments?
7997498	7998359	Because these are pretty funny.
7998459	7998820	Do it.
7999080	7999340	All right.
8000282	8002544	Donovan suggests... These are all about the zombies.
8003045	8004006	And where would you set up shop?
8004046	8006629	Donovan's one of my buddies from Alabama, by the way.
8006789	8007689	Hi, Donovan!
8007729	8008850	One of my old school buddies.
8008890	8014032	I keep thinking it's Travis Donovan from Under Station Live, but he wouldn't listen to this show.
8014052	8019794	He's one of my major geek buddies and one of the people responsible for making me a bigger nerd than I was then.
8019814	8021755	Clearly he's a geek if he's listening to this show.
8022335	8024636	Well, a hearty hello from us California kids.
8025177	8028478	Us California kids have done a good job of corrupting Jamie, just so you know.
8029179	8030981	Also, some comments about my mother's house.
8032223	8033886	Ziba says, they're gross, Rob.
8034006	8039574	And Tigerclaw follows that up with, yeah, Skye, and if your mom sees you shoot a zombie, she'd be like, Rob, that's gross.
8041276	8044220	You go outside right now and clean that up, Rob.
8047310	8048071	I like your mom.
8049171	8050012	Rob Roberts.
8050312	8050752	What do you think?
8050812	8051953	Although that's not really my name.
8052774	8057016	We should call my mom next week and ask her what she would do if zombies showed up at her house.
8059438	8066302	Salacious Pop says, LOL, the notoriously violent elitist bouncers of Studio 54 are a great anti-zombie tool.
8066722	8067583	You look like shit.
8067623	8068303	You can't get in.
8068363	8068744	Sorry.
8068824	8070305	Come back with some hot girls and try again.
8071567	8072328	And I'll see you next time.
8089192	8090273	Bobby!
8091274	8092035	Bobby!
8093076	8094337	Okay, so the next email.
8094357	8096279	We actually got a decent number of emails, by the way.
8097240	8104026	Dear OLR, I know I probably don't fit your average demographic being a 31-year-old male carpenter, but I have to tell you something.
8104506	8105928	I love Wednesdays and Thursdays.
8106088	8106688	You know why?
8107329	8111793	Because that's usually the time you release your current podcast and I get to fix someone's house while listening to you guys.
8112674	8113054	Wow.
8113875	8118639	Please, please, please keep on doing this show another seven years or at least until Loki is number one in GTA.
8119119	8120820	Thanks for all you do, Serious Turtle.
8120901	8126125	And by the way, dude, you're totally our... Okay, I'm 34.
8126225	8126385	I'm 31.
8126865	8130828	In college, working at hell on earth.
8130908	8131749	I mean, a job.
8132429	8133390	Jesus was a carpenter.
8133991	8135712	Yeah, you could totally be our Jesus.
8135912	8136412	There you go.
8136833	8137253	Are you Jewish?
8137373	8138554	Yay, Jesus email.
8141977	8143258	Jesus listens to OLR.
8144118	8144379	No.
8145399	8146520	That's horrible.
8146840	8147280	Rob!
8148661	8150963	You should be ashamed of yourself.
8150983	8151603	Are you kidding?
8151623	8152964	My mother would have told that joke.
8154265	8154785	Probably.
8155986	8157207	My mother would be ashamed of you.
8158708	8160269	No, my mom.
8160289	8161910	My mom.
8161990	8163691	Rob, you shouldn't say that.
8165333	8166753	She's like secretly laughing.
8167194	8172697	I was thinking that my mom would probably try to stifle the giggles like you do when you're at church.
8173778	8174018	Superbook
8194264	8196286	That was my show growing up.
8196327	8197748	Superbook was the bomb.
8197768	8198809	Superbook and Flying House.
8200071	8200572	That was it.
8200732	8201052	All right.
8201773	8209522	Actually, and for the record, I did used to sneak out of church and hang out in the church library reading, like... Well, would you go to hell for that, though?
8209562	8213187	I don't think you would because, like, you're still, like, doing churchy things.
8213939	8224849	Well, because, no, at the tender age of ten years old, and this, you know, I'm not making it any type of a secret, I'm converting to Judaism, eventually.
8226171	8229954	I was sort of like, these were translated from Greek?
8230575	8231636	Wasn't it written in Hebrew?
8232316	8233998	And then go hang out in the library and look everything up.
8234598	8235359	So, that was me.
8235399	8236180	Anyway.
8236260	8236500	Anyway.
8238232	8238893	On the 700 Club, Rob.
8238933	8240454	I know, I know.
8265024	8265944	I was a kid!
8267225	8268725	It was totally old school anime.
8268745	8273387	And if you think about it, some pretty badass shit happens in that cartoon.
8273427	8276227	This guy's just splitting the ocean in half.
8276267	8277588	Transformers didn't do that shit.
8277868	8279028	It's totally old school anime.
8279748	8280008	Alright.
8280309	8280629	Anyway.
8282828	8283669	I'm over it.
8283729	8284249	God.
8284930	8289573	Everybody gets too tense when it comes to religious topics.
8289613	8292795	Have fun with it.
8293656	8301421	I have to be in boy drag and I can... Salacious Pop, I need DarkSakura to dress in boy drag so she can sneak into the rabbi school and read the Torah.
8301481	8302242	This needs to happen.
8302302	8303723	And Singfather, can you hear me?
8304043	8304784	What?
8306125	8308346	I could do that anyway if I wanted to be a rabbi.
8308366	8310007	All right, let's move on.
8310047	8310528	Let's move on.
8311283	8311483	Rob What?
8324717	8326098	Hi guys!
8327699	8332942	This is just a quick note to thank you for sending out Mother's Day wishes to WeGaming moms.
8333442	8336484	Your show is a welcome distraction from corporate tedium every week.
8337384	8341427	Not to mention, and the mention of Mother's Day made it all the sweeter.
8341867	8348731	I'm one of those that grew up on video games, still plays today, and believes that parents should be gaming with their children rather than shaking their heads over it.
8349131	8350712	Keep up the good work, VeggieWolf!
8351924	8352644	Yay!
8352725	8354385	Parents, yay!
8354405	8355646	Parenting your children.
8355726	8357087	An extra special Mother's Day.
8357367	8359088	Mother's Day is every day for you, lady.
8359228	8360929	You deserve props.
8360949	8361409	Good for you.
8361489	8362169	That's a good attitude.
8362469	8366391	Rob, I'm going to link this to you so that we can play it.
8366651	8367572	Okay.
8367592	8374655	Because she sends another email that says, of course, right after I sent the last message, I heard the question about a good song for zombie killing.
8375636	8376996	So I am going to...
8380079	8395811	Copy this link location And by the way, while DarkSakura is sending that over to me SalaciousPop is clarifying That was the plot to Yentl That he was trying to get you a Barbra Streisand I know, I haven't seen Yentl Which I know I'm supposed to see Yentl Neither have I, bad gay You know what?
8396251	8398713	No, we're not having a Barbra Streisand night, vetoed
8399093	8405318	No, I'm talking about watching... If we're going to watch things that involve cross-dressing, Rob, let's watch Yentl and Victor Victoria.
8405459	8407580	No, let's watch Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.
8408261	8409162	I need to see Yentl.
8410543	8411184	You really don't.
8411864	8413726	Alright, here's the video that your emailer sent.
8415047	8416888	Ooh, it contains content of an adult nature.
8416989	8417309	Hooray.
8417349	8420432	Ooh, I can't believe... Oh, is this zombie killing music?
8420452	8420572	Yeah.
8427745	8429306	Maybe we need to skip ahead a little bit.
8429326	8430967	I actually sent the song, so let me send you the other link.
8431568	8436211	This is funny, because he's running over people with a lawnmower.
8436291	8437592	I sent you the actual song.
8455305	8457047	This is funny.
8457527	8458508	This is great radio.
8458588	8460230	I'm watching a video and laughing at it.
8460911	8461732	Okay, here's the other one.
8461812	8463994	Oh, this is the actual song.
8464014	8465596	The Wurzels, Combined Harvester.
8476258	8477540	We need to do that for our ridiculous news.
8491239	8498085	Okay, ever since I started listening to internet radio almost 10 years ago, I have always dreamed about listening to shoutcast.net stations in my car.
8498745	8502609	When iPhone first came out, I was excited to learn that it can play streaming radio.
8503009	8504911	However, I didn't have the money to get one.
8505411	8518602	A couple months ago, I finally decided that I wanted to purchase one with some of my tax return money after I heard about the supposed 4G version of the iPhone being found at a bar I was hesitant to buy, knowing that this version may be released very soon.
8519142	8522945	Since I haven't heard anything new about it in a while, I don't know what I should do.
8523445	8530030	Do you think this leak is delaying the 4G version to come out, or do you think it was just a marketing ploy by Apple and we're going to hear more about it very soon?
8530551	8535174	I just don't want to buy the 3GS and then a couple months later see a 4G version released and scream me over.
8535474	8536896	Your fellow gamer girl, Ziba.
8537476	8540979	Well, I bought a 3G a couple months ago.
8542253	8546436	Rumor is Jobes was pissed and called Gizmodo himself.
8546476	8549378	That's one of the latest rumors that was on the blogs this week, but whatever.
8549618	8550679	Believe it or not, I don't care.
8551799	8556502	The fact is, fact, Apple will release information about a new phone in June.
8556802	8565908	So my suggestion, if you think you can hold off until June, the end of June, which is only about a month away at this point, if you can hold off like one month, you're in good shape.
8566349	8566829	You'll be fine.
8567809	8569691	And then you'll have a better idea what to expect.
8570511	8570671	Um...
8571852	8577017	The only other suggestion I really have is that keep in mind that iPhone's not your only option.
8577298	8582323	You know, they do have like tuner apps, I think, for BlackBerrys and the Droid.
8582423	8583704	I mean, the other phones have them too.
8585826	8586087	I don't know.
8586107	8588009	I wasn't feeling the song for Mailbag Music.
8588829	8590251	We'll find a purpose for it on the show, though.
8590271	8590852	It's a good song.
8591192	8591452	Okay.
8592033	8592373	That's it.
8592613	8594155	We're going to find a use for that somewhere.
8595471	8597772	By the way, you know why I was so distracted earlier in Part A?
8597792	8605376	It's because I was reading a friend's live journal and she had pictures up of, what's it, Root Root Beat?
8607277	8608118	The new Bimani game?
8608178	8608618	Oh, U-Beat!
8608778	8609439	U-Beat, yeah.
8610179	8611800	And it looked very cubical.
8612940	8615282	It looks, oh, our friend in Japan.
8615402	8616022	Is that who that was?
8617223	8620344	Yeah, U-Beat is kind of one of those games I'd like to play at some point.
8620364	8621585	Weren't they testing it in the U.S.
8621665	8623546	and then they just kind of stopped, I guess?
8624395	8624975	I don't know.
8625836	8628657	She listed it as Jewbeat.
8628937	8635620	Or maybe it's you as in the Spanish J. I don't know.
8636120	8638641	I would say there might be a chance at E3.
8638761	8644543	Sometimes if Konami's got a lot of Bomani games they want to show, they'll roll out a lot of machines at E3.
8644563	8645584	They had Supernova.
8646084	8646344	They did.
8646364	8648025	They brought a Beatmania 2DX machine in 2006, I think it was.
8648045	8648345	They brought a...
8653638	8655599	Sometimes they'll bring them to E3 for awareness.
8655679	8657240	I don't know why I mentioned that on the show.
8657260	8658040	Wasn't it distorted?
8658060	8659421	Sometimes they're the Japanese games.
8660101	8661061	It wasn't distorted.
8661101	8661582	It was distorted.
8662122	8662742	It was distorted.
8662862	8663102	Yeah.
8663663	8664623	They brought it to E3 one year.
8664943	8666144	That was the new game that was out in Japan.
8666404	8666624	Yeah.
8667044	8668425	So, we'll see.
8668745	8672447	But U-Beat, I don't think is... And it's not Jew-Beat.
8673667	8680154	Well, that's why I didn't know because I had seen... I know, but a lot of people... Because it's J-U-B.
8680354	8681696	I've seen people spell it both ways.
8681776	8688402	And besides that, I wouldn't have known if I hadn't seen the kana for it.
8689463	8692547	I'd like to check it out at some point, but probably never will.
8693840	8705171	Oh yeah, and they actually called it in the limited location test They actually called it, and DarkTest Studio clarifies in chat You beat, with like a U And that's not a bad name for a game But it could be taken many ways You beat what?
8707913	8716982	Oh, we're 12 Alright, this is the part of the show where we get a little bit angsty Because, I don't know, we've just been that way for 8 years So deal with it, it's CFU's of the week
8733152	8737353	Effie goes to allergies and the city of Dixon, namely their pollen.
8741054	8741374	Loki!
8742094	8744214	Effie to bad CD dumps.
8747155	8747955	Because it sucks.
8749715	8761958	Um, I don't know, like overall I've had a pretty good week, but then the past couple days, like Mother Nature or whoever has it out for me out there was just kind of like, I'm gonna kick you, brr brr brr, repeatedly, brr brr, in the balls, brr brr.
8762486	8789830	But actually, you know what, all things considered Things could be a lot worse And I don't have it so bad So I'm not that angsty But I will say an FU Oh, there was something that ticked me off the other day And I was like, that's going to be my FU of the week on OLR Now I can't remember what it was, so I guess it didn't make me that angsty FU to the fact that I still don't go out and buy a new car I've been saying I'm going to do it for like a year and I still haven't FU to myself
8791058	8796901	All right, let's get into a couple more stories and then... Oh, God, your calls.
8796921	8798121	1-877-GAME-OLR.
8798241	8804324	After a couple more stories here, the Skype line will be open at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8804804	8806125	But first, a couple more stories.
8806225	8806445	Loki?
8806905	8809527	I'm sure with Infinity War going...
8810487	8813950	I'm not really going their separate ways, but they're kind of dissolving, if you know what I mean.
8815791	8819654	I'm sure they're going to treat the Call of Duty franchise with the utmost respect.
8820214	8829981	Although, you kind of wonder with all these different domain names that they're registering, and I'm sure a lot of it's just to kind of make sure that people aren't squatting in the domains.
8830441	8833223	But, a little bit's kind of weird.
8833243	8834164	Okay, like for example...
8834844	8843570	Call of Duty Future Warfare, Advanced Warfare, Secret Warfare, and Space Warfare Space Warfare, huh?
8843790	8845191	Space Warfare
8863106	8869413	Call of Duty in space Well, that's gotta be better than vagina warfare
8870037	8872038	No, I'm being completely serious right now.
8872098	8874600	There's a new game out, and it's about Vagina.
8875520	8877301	It's a game called Privates.
8879282	8883445	It's on the PC, and apparently it's coming to the Xbox 360.
8883845	8890029	I don't know how the hell this is happening, but apparently it's coming to 360, or at least that's what the developers would tell you.
8890069	8891790	It's Zombie Cow Studios.
8892870	8893131	It is...
8896052	8908294	You lead a teeny tiny gang of condom-hatted marines as they delve into people's vaginas and bottoms and blast away at all manner of oozy, shouty monsters.
8914456	8917856	So you will be able to shoot the monsters that live inside the vagina.
8919457	8920877	Take this, yeast infection!
8923382	8927083	Yeah, actually, you will be able to blast all manners of grody infections.
8927563	8928764	Dude, this looks like a sperm.
8928824	8929984	This looks fucking gross.
8930004	8931305	This looks like an evil sperm.
8931565	8936306	I'm all for, like, you know, pushing the envelope and everything of good taste.
8936786	8939587	But this is just stupid.
8940247	8943749	Like, really, really stupid.
8945969	8947610	But, you know, I'll have to play it at least once.
8947670	8948730	You're shooting sperm.
8948750	8949751	You're shooting evil sperm.
8949771	8950111	Look at that.
8950391	8951111	They're evil sperm.
8952876	8953377	Yes, they are.
8953437	8954357	They are evil sperm.
8955218	8957460	How in the hell is this coming out on Xbox 360?
8957500	8959862	I'm going to make a live journal icon out of one of these evil sperms.
8959882	8961324	This is not coming out on the 360.
8962084	8963786	I don't know who the hell they think they're kidding.
8964226	8968510	But there's no way this game would not get an AO rating.
8969010	8972653	And Microsoft has it in their thing that AO games will not be released.
8972693	8975836	And even if they try to do it as an indie game, it will not get past the review board.
8976136	8977718	Who the hell do they think they're kidding?
8980458	8982499	It is kind of funny, though, in a 12-year-old sort of way.
8982539	8984480	I mean, that's the whole point, right?
8986160	8993743	All right, let's open up the Skype line right now at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8993863	8995564	So if you want to give us a call, you can right now.
8995584	9000426	To give us your thoughts on tonight's show or anything else maybe you wanted to hear us talk about that we didn't do.
9000946	9001606	How rude.
9002106	9003787	You can give us a call and set us straight at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9007070	9010684	In the meantime, we'll go try to get some last minute stories.
9011165	9012571	Loki, do you have any last minute stories?
9013584	9021130	Yeah, something that we were talking a little bit about, a movie coming for a game franchise.
9021150	9031217	Well, this isn't necessarily a game franchise that's getting a movie, but it has game stuff in it, and that would be that wonderful short film, Pixels.
9031337	9032678	Hold on, caller, we'll get to you in just a moment.
9033659	9041264	Pixels, which featured Donkey Kong, Frogger, Space Invaders, and different stuff from Arkanoid, that's being actually made into a full-length movie now.
9042136	9043677	Yeah, I was reading about that the other day.
9043697	9044217	That's pretty cool.
9044257	9046177	Yeah, Happy Madison actually picked it up.
9047038	9048118	All right, let me go to the phone.
9048198	9048878	Caller, are you there?
9048918	9050279	Hi, hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9050299	9050659	Who's this?
9052240	9052860	This is Rob.
9053720	9055061	Rob, hey, I like your name.
9055121	9055721	What's up, Rob?
9057046	9058086	I am getting feedback.
9058206	9059387	I'm going to have to hang up.
9075931	9082813	Sometimes folks will get a little bit of echo because just a little bit of background as to the way we do it here at Orange Lounge Radio.
9083653	9085193	We have speakers in studio.
9085233	9089754	We do not wear headsets because there's too many of us to have headsets, especially if we have a guest.
9090135	9091435	So we do have in-house speakers.
9091815	9095636	So sometimes you will hear yourself over the speaker, and it's a little crazy.
9096036	9099357	So do be aware of that if you call in and kind of hear yourself.
9099937	9100197	All right.
9101317	9102178	Let's try again.
9102438	9103378	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9103398	9103718	Who's this?
9104773	9106475	Hey, this is Rob-a-ba again.
9106815	9107756	Oh, it's Rob-a-ba.
9108877	9110078	Yeah.
9110719	9111460	The Rob-a-ba.
9111500	9112381	Are you still getting feedback?
9113802	9116064	No, I was listening to the show.
9116124	9118627	I had to turn off the feed so I could hear you.
9119067	9120228	Ah, yes, that's a good thing.
9120269	9123912	Just like when you call real radio, you have to turn off your speakers, so that will happen.
9124252	9127015	Well, hey, I'm glad you're calling in, Rob-a-ba.
9127075	9127576	What's on your mind?
9128590	9133833	Okay, well, first of all, I saw you and Bobby playing 3D.GameHeroes this afternoon.
9133993	9134153	Yes.
9134393	9138015	And have you gotten to Ortego Town?
9138155	9139036	It's the second town.
9140036	9141137	Is that the one in the desert?
9142037	9142277	Yes.
9142678	9146500	Is that the one with the foo-foo sequence or whatever it was called?
9147580	9148080	Poof-poof.
9148341	9149441	Poof-poof, that's it.
9149701	9151042	It was the poof-poof sequence.
9152223	9154404	Is that what you might have been inquiring about?
9155731	9158292	Yeah, I thought that was hilarious and also really dirty.
9158893	9159633	It was very dirty.
9159913	9171660	Okay, in mine, like, I don't know if it was just the way I was playing, but when he woke up from Poof Poof, it was the chick's dad was there and saying, doesn't he give really good massages?
9172060	9174181	Like, I was like, this game is filthy.
9174601	9175562	Absolutely filthy.
9177256	9178437	Yeah, that's what I thought too.
9178917	9184680	In fact, they used massages the same way that Incredible Crisis used massages to mean something else.
9186581	9187342	Exactly.
9187822	9189503	Well, what do you think of 3D.GameHeroes?
9189563	9191844	Obviously, you've played a little bit if you've made it to Poof Poof.
9193745	9198568	I'm enjoying it at a Zelda level, but it doesn't seem to go much beyond Zelda.
9200276	9204920	Weren't you a little bit, like, just slightly disappointed at the customization features in it?
9204960	9215028	Like, maybe I'm just being a greedy bastard, but I was kind of like, you know, again, we live in an era of LittleBigPlanet, and I was kind of disappointed that the only thing you get to change is the way the hero looks.
9215088	9220272	Like, I was kind of thinking, like, maybe I'm crazy, but that there would have been more customizability to it.
9221789	9222529	Death by Poof Poof
9243698	9247142	Well, I have one more thing to say, and I'm going to post a link in the chat.
9247682	9264680	There was some story on Digital Times about 10 million iPhones being ordered by Apple, of course, and that they work on the Verizon-type network.
9265959	9268601	Wait a minute, wait a minute.
9268741	9279509	I thought, and I could have sworn I read this earlier this week, and I'm looking at your story right now, I'm pulling it up, but I thought that the AT&T came out and laid it on the table and said, you know what, bitches?
9279630	9284733	We're under contract until 2012, so you need to STFU when it comes to this whole Verizon talk.
9285714	9287736	Yeah, but not if they call it an iPad Mini.
9288817	9290258	I'm just saying.
9291259	9292760	That's shady, but funny.
9294198	9295439	Yeah, I don't think 10 million.
9295499	9300281	I think it's fake because 10 million is a really bad number to order at startup.
9300801	9303622	It would be more like two, two to five.
9304622	9305183	I agree.
9305603	9307224	The iPad didn't even have that many.
9307384	9311846	I mean, it was far less, like not even a million iPads did they order right away.
9312946	9315147	Yeah, something strikes me as fishy about this too.
9316325	9318366	But I just thought I'd add it because you talked about it earlier.
9320067	9324129	And like it or not, iPhone is a gaming platform and needs to be recognized.
9324209	9328571	Especially, we're seeing ports of so many, not just classic, but new.
9328891	9331172	You can get Street Fighter 4 on the friggin' iPhone.
9331852	9336995	If you don't consider the iPhone a gaming platform at this point, you are behind the times.
9337935	9338456	Yes, sir.
9339156	9339417	All right.
9339657	9344100	Well, Robaba, it's nice to hear from you, like actual here as opposed to emails.
9344160	9344981	I mean, don't get us wrong.
9345021	9348283	We love the emails too, but always good to hear from new callers.
9348343	9351206	So anything else quickly you want to get out there before we let you go?
9352186	9352787	No, that's it.
9353207	9353908	All right, Robaba.
9353948	9354728	You have a great night.
9356049	9356310	All right.
9356450	9356810	Bye-bye.
9358091	9358431	Did you get it?
9358551	9358932	Bye-bye?
9360092	9360373	Forget it.
9360393	9362334	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9362434	9363875	Username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
9363895	9365096	We can take a few more calls here.
9366297	9366597	Loki.
9367398	9378501	See, I gave him a pass on some of the Skype etiquette and so forth because A, I know he's listened to the show forever, and B, you know, if it's your first time calling in, I'll give you a pass on some of that stuff.
9378781	9380382	So, all is forgiven.
9381302	9382422	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9382442	9382802	Who's this?
9384143	9384803	Hey, what's up, guys?
9384823	9385503	This is Kaijudo.
9385843	9386483	Hey, what's up?
9386603	9387103	What's on your mind?
9388524	9388784	Not much.
9389004	9394125	First of all, I just want to say that, what was the game you were just talking about?
9394205	9394946	The Zelda?
9394966	9395886	3D.gameheroes.
9397741	9399282	I call that basically Lego Zelda.
9399442	9400342	It's a confusing game.
9401223	9409066	I understand that it was kind of like a love letter to Zelda and all the other games from back in the day.
9410146	9416149	I'm not knocking them for making what everyone's calling a Zelda clone, but just the look of it.
9416349	9418530	It looks really shitty, man.
9418870	9420931	It looks like RPG Maker for PlayStation 2.
9421934	9422955	It's a really bad looking game.
9437845	9449596	There's, you know, when you're doing retro, I get there's probably that the audience is sitting there listening to this right now going, well, shit, Rob, if you're doing a retro style game, what the hell do you expect them to do?
9450237	9456603	And I don't know, one thing might be like a free roaming camera as opposed to four fixed cameras you could pick from.
9457263	9482807	and yes I understand you get to do them in screenshots but I don't know it seems like they did have some optimization problems because again frame skip in a dungeon that's not okay you know just tone down the water effects they didn't need to be that awesome you know yeah I mean yeah that that game I'm pretty sure is giving a lot of people seizures with the water and I mean I can't even make out what I'm looking at half the time you know it's I don't know it's just a really weird
9483507	9484467	It's just a creepy looking game to me.
9484567	9490368	I mean, I was never into the Zelda games to begin with, so I would never pick it up, but it's just strange.
9490388	9492009	I don't know, something off with it.
9492269	9497050	Yeah, I mean, if you weren't into Zelda, there ain't nothing here for you.
9497950	9500930	I mean, just walk right on by, there ain't nothing here for you.
9501851	9507052	Yeah, and that sword is maybe the worst weapon I've ever seen in a video game, just the look of it.
9507272	9508452	It's just over the top, man.
9509301	9511603	Yeah, I mean, I can't knock it too much because I haven't played it.
9511623	9513904	Maybe playing it, you actually get some enjoyment out of it.
9513964	9519508	But looking at it, I literally wanted to puke on the television screen.
9519528	9520689	It's a horrible looking game.
9520789	9525292	The best thing I could compare that sword to is just another LOL moment.
9525452	9527893	And that game has a lot of LOL moments.
9528053	9530855	And that ridiculous sword is just another one of them.
9531276	9532236	You just kind of sit there.
9532256	9534698	Doesn't the sword get bigger as you level up?
9536137	9538319	You can go to a blacksmith and get your sword.
9538359	9540581	You can alter the length and width of your sword.
9540621	9541942	And I was just waiting for girth.
9542102	9543844	I was waiting for girth to be an option too.
9544665	9548028	But no, you can modify the beam that it fires.
9548989	9551871	But you can go to a blacksmith and get some of that altered.
9553673	9559058	Alright, and my last comment is, are you guys getting, what is it, Redemption something?
9560041	9560461	I'm getting it.
9560481	9562223	I can't remember the name, but I'm definitely getting it.
9562443	9563303	I know Loki.
9563604	9565385	Yeah, I'm absolutely getting it.
9565606	9566546	You already have it, right?
9566566	9567147	Yeah, I already have it.
9567667	9570810	But I'm actually getting another copy, too, because I think I'm getting one free for my work.
9571111	9571411	Nice.
9572472	9573092	Must be nice.
9573112	9575655	Is it GTA in the Wild West?
9575675	9576896	Because that's basically what I want.
9576936	9577957	That's all it needs to be for me.
9578391	9604137	um yeah it pretty much I mean it doesn't play exactly like the GTA but I mean there's a lot of similarities and I mean it's not as um like intense as GTA I mean there's a lot I mean it's more open world but there's not as much in the open world because obviously it's the wild west not like a bustling city but it's awesome and it looks like graphics wise it's way better than GTA so it's pretty amazing I remember GTA was like wow look at that I can look across the the
9604757	9605197	That's kind of creepy.
9605217	9607598	Like, I mean, in a good way, but that's... Wow, games are too realistic.
9635772	9637573	I've taken up enough of your time.
9637793	9638814	You guys have a good night.
9638994	9639555	I love the show.
9639775	9640175	Great show.
9640195	9640475	Keep it up.
9640615	9641276	We love the call.
9641336	9641816	Have a good one.
9641836	9642377	Have a good night, buddy.
9643759	9645822	Alright, some good calls tonight.
9646662	9649445	1877gameOLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9650006	9654751	Actdeft in our chatroom says, I want a free copy of 3D.gameheroes.
9654871	9658815	By the way, I like that last caller's comparison to LEGO Zelda.
9658975	9660116	I think it was a great comparison.
9660156	9660657	That was funny.
9661097	9665582	And Donovan in chat says, actually, LEGO Zelda sounds like it could be fun, especially with the LEGO game sense of humor.
9666222	9666242	I...
9666943	9688429	that comment actually kind of I think hits the nail on the head it's it's pretty pretty accurate let's see Donovan says hmm Lego wow just as fun of a joke game says the guy who's all tabbing out of wow to type in here addict Jamie you make friends with a lot of wow addicts I gotta say I know what's up with that more people playing Star Trek online with me
9689201	9689923	I still have the card.
9689943	9695395	I'm going to use it at some point, but probably after Memorial Day, because if I use it now, I've got too many trips coming up.
9695436	9699344	I'm going on two weekend trips back to back, so I've got to calm down.
9700751	9722200	And actually spend time playing the game And then I got E3 coming up too I gotta worry about that I'm gonna be gone a week for that Good times OLR at E3 We don't know what we're doing yet But we'll have Unfortunately it won't be Loki and DarkSakura So we won't unfortunately be able to bring you something collectively Unless maybe there's like some type of I don't know Maybe we'll do something over Skype
9722620	9728586	because, you know, Loki and DarkSakura will probably be able to follow the news almost better online than I will be being at the show.
9728646	9730989	But we are going to hopefully bring you some cool interviews at the show.
9731029	9732770	At least that is the idea.
9733431	9737255	Loki, do you have any other last-minute stories over there that we can get to while we wait for some more calls?
9739669	9761765	Um, yeah, this kind of actually ties in a little bit with the last story we were talking about, Inappropriate Games, and of course, you know, leading the market of Inappropriate Games would be Japan, and developer T-Time is bringing new technology into the adult anime game franchise.
9762685	9784157	Including, they have the face tracking TCAM technology Well now, they're working on hand tracking as well So you'll be able to use Natal-like accuracy to lift skirts and rip off shirts of anime women And they have some demo videos displaying such Unappropriate!
9786098	9787599	But funny Funny, yes
9790117	9790517	Good stuff.
9790557	9791538	Anything else for us tonight?
9792138	9793399	Ape Escape's coming to the PS3.
9794060	9794560	That's kind of neat.
9796902	9802105	And this is kind of disappointing, I guess, but, you know, nowadays we have the internet.
9802966	9807329	The Nintendo PowerLine is going to be disconnected on June 1st.
9807469	9808810	Fuck, that was still open?
9809670	9810011	Yes.
9810211	9811472	Is that the game counselors?
9811612	9812232	I think it is.
9812312	9813153	Holy shit.
9814887	9816689	Sorry to hear, though, that they'll be out of jobs.
9816749	9817689	I mean, that kind of sucks.
9817970	9821633	To be honest, I didn't know you still existed.
9821733	9822133	Sorry.
9823615	9827218	It was probably just one guy with his feet up on the desk not getting called.
9827238	9830260	It's like Loki eating his sandwich.
9831421	9832062	I do that.
9832102	9833283	Waiting for the call to come in.
9833463	9834344	I do that at work.
9835585	9839988	Hey, if I eat the sandwich at my desk before I go to lunch, that's more time to play Grand Theft Auto.
9840049	9840509	That's right.
9843832	9845233	Anything else for us tonight, Loki?
9845954	9847075	Or DarkSakura, I don't know.
9848096	9849797	You got anything?
9850338	9852059	I'm debating doing something really addict-y.
9853480	9855402	As long as it's not reactivating your WoW account?
9855722	9861287	No, I'm considering finding a cheap digital download key for Star Trek Online so that I can play a joint drill.
9862528	9864129	That is pretty addict-y.
9864149	9865150	But I get another 30 free days.
9865591	9866511	All right, let's get to another call.
9866551	9867452	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9867472	9867793	Who's this?
9868550	9869451	Hey, this is X-Link.
9869911	9871332	X-Link, what's on your mind, buddy?
9872653	9877656	Nothing much, I was just talking about the EA, about charging the extra 10 bucks for the sports games.
9877817	9879858	Yes, I'm surprised more people didn't want to talk about this.
9879898	9880839	What are your thoughts on this?
9881079	9884381	Actually, I do, because I love playing the sports games from EA.
9884421	9891146	In fact, I like playing all of them from time to time, because it's a good way to calm down after having a bad day at work.
9891646	9893487	Especially with something like Tiger Woods or something.
9893728	9895889	Though I don't condone what Tiger Woods did, but...
9897090	9899953	Tiger Woods with Grand Theft Auto
9916809	9919911	Double Dribble I will totally buy NBA Jam when it comes out too
9943809	9944750	Boom Shakalaka!
9944810	9945291	I will too.
9945511	9946633	That's going to be a great game.
9946673	9949597	Anyway, so yes, so the sports games.
9949697	9950298	So what do you think?
9950338	9951079	Are you pissed?
9951119	9952020	I didn't play a bucket.
9952320	9952821	Is it justified?
9952841	9956506	No, seriously, I don't go online that much and play online.
9956726	9960111	If I did, I could see maybe paying the $10, but personally I could give $2.
9961226	9990695	you know two shits about it because I don't really play it online that much if I did I'd play it once in a blue moon so I mean I'm more playing it just for like the season stuff for myself and see how well I can do on the teams than I do playing online against other people that I mostly probably end up cheating anyway so but 10 bucks doesn't really seem that much compared to so like somebody said earlier about you know SOCOM and it being 20 bucks I mean you know it could be a lot worse I mean
9992773	9996555	I guess my worry is that if this works, it's only going to get worse.
9996955	9997655	That's my worry.
9997695	9999616	It's going to get worse no matter what.
9999977	10001317	We've got to think about it in the long run.
10001377	10003398	They're going to nickel-dime us no matter what.
10003418	10013524	Whether it be downloadable content, whether it be online play, whether it be flying unicorns, it's going to always be something.
10014044	10014265	So...
10015305	10024850	But I look at it as if I give them $10, they better have the servers running, they better do it good, and they better have it so I can connect to people without any lag or anything like that.
10024970	10029013	So, I mean, as long as they can do that kind of stuff, I really don't see any kind of problems.
10029133	10030774	But they probably won't.
10031554	10034335	I mean, they're not going to change their service just because they're charging an extra $10.
10034375	10047059	See, the problem is they have all this download content that was out there in all these different ways that they were offering extra add-ons, whether it be buying cheats or buying extra crap that you probably don't need for your sports games.
10047379	10052080	Well, that maybe wasn't working so well, so now they're making you buy multiplayer online if you...
10055761	10062024	Purchase the game used so that way they're getting some money for that used purchase versus no money.
10062685	10065326	But I really don't think they should be getting money for used purchase.
10065786	10071689	Nowhere else in the industry, any industry, do people get money for a used purchase.
10072249	10076491	If I buy a used car, I don't have to pay money to the manufacturer because they didn't sell me a new car.
10076791	10077672	Too fucking bad.
10079096	10080457	Yeah, I totally agree on that.
10080617	10084158	And that's going to give other people in our companies reason to do other stuff, too.
10084198	10085839	And that could get out of control big time.
10085879	10093542	But, you know, if I wanted to coach and play online real bad, too, I might even look on eBay or something, try to find a code on there that somebody's willing to sell.
10093602	10096603	Somebody goes, you know, buys the game going, you know what, I'm not going to use it online.
10096743	10097523	I'm going to sell it.
10097643	10099284	I mean, I don't see why they couldn't do that.
10099444	10101825	I mean, I see that all the time with other downloadable stuff, so.
10102065	10102785	That's a good point.
10102846	10107428	I mean, maybe somebody doesn't really want to play online or doesn't really have the whole hookup to be able to play online.
10107448	10115473	So they're just like, hey, I'm just going to sell this code, make a quick $10 or $7, recoup some of the money, and then between that and selling the game used in the first place, make a little more money.
10115553	10116474	Hey, why not?
10116494	10117034	Yeah, precisely.
10117355	10117635	All right.
10117995	10120877	XLeague, we've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for your call.
10121677	10121997	Anytime.
10122057	10122498	Thank you.
10122658	10124179	And good luck on hitting 80 this week.
10125023	10127106	I'm almost at 79 right now as we speak, so.
10127547	10127887	All right.
10128067	10128288	Thanks.
10128428	10130631	From one addict to another, good luck.
10131352	10131832	Yeah, thank you.
10131973	10132373	You're welcome.
10133395	10133995	I feel kind of bad.
10134015	10136138	I think I kind of got X-Link hooked on that game.
10136258	10139683	Like, I feel like, thank God I don't have to pay like, you know, pay like...
10143149	10143449	Boo Boo
10165151	10165651	Don't be sad.
10166252	10168154	There'll be another OLR next week.
10168454	10169915	Actually, I've got a final thought for you, Rob.
10170015	10170175	What?
10170435	10175139	I have a final thought for you.
10181445	10182766	Loki, do you have a final thought?
10183607	10187530	I have to see what animals or other animals I can skin in Red Dead Redemption.
10187650	10189291	It's too bad that you can't skin a human.
