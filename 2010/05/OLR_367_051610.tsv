25000	29000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	38000	Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 367 of Orange Lounge Radio
38000	41000	The video game talk show where every gamer has a voice
41000	46000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts
46000	50000	First on up, the one, the only, the fabulous, Dark Sakura
50000	52000	Here's my impression of Rob earlier
52000	53000	What?
53000	55000	What episode number is this?
57000	63000	Okay, no. Okay, before we went on air, because you know, I wanted to have the episode number down
63000	67000	Because I lost count like three years ago, longer than that, where we were at with the show
67000	68000	You know I have to give you a hard time
68000	71000	So I said, what episode number are we on? Just kind of like a rhetorical question
71000	75000	Like I'm actually going to look it up, like I don't expect Dark Sakura or Loki to know it
75000	78000	And Jamie in the background, she's all, 69
78000	79000	I said 50 million
79000	80000	Oh did you? I thought you said 69
80000	81000	You said 69
81000	82000	I thought you said 69
82000	84000	I totally thought she said 69 too
84000	86000	I said 50 million
87000	89000	Alright so it's episode number 69 of Orange
89000	93000	Actually in two weeks, no three weeks, because there's not going to be a show in a couple weeks
93000	97000	But the show after Labor Day will be episode number 369
97000	99000	Brought to you by the multiples of three
99000	100000	That's right
100000	103000	Oh that is weird, 369
103000	104000	Alright anyhow
104000	108000	Also the other voice you hear over there, the one and only tech master Loki
108000	109000	Hello
109000	112000	Who's favorite game by the way, is that Rainbow Unicorn game
112000	113000	It is not
113000	117000	That's all you ever play on this program is Rainbow Unicorn
117000	119000	That's not what I play
119000	123000	I played the werewolf ice cream man one not too long ago
123000	124000	How dare I
124000	128000	And I played the, was it the Mario crossover game the other week
128000	132000	I just didn't have the link for the Mario crossover game because I was going to play that
132000	136000	That was actually pretty awesome with the Contra guys blowing up all the blocks
136000	142000	I do have the link to the Unicorn game but that's about all I have right now
142000	148000	Alright also joining us tonight, you guys in our chat room because we do tape live every week at All Games Radio

166000	170000	First off Dark Sakura, I understand, school's out for summer
170000	172000	Yay
172000	174000	Well I'm going to school in the summer
174000	175000	Oh never mind then
175000	177000	Well but I make it to skip pre-algebra
177000	178000	Well who
178000	183000	Because for some reason ARC's website just let me sign up for algebra in the fall
183000	190000	And I was going to do like the self study thing in the summer because it's freaking pre-algebra so whatever
190000	194000	So I may only be taking history this summer but that means I graduate
194000	195000	Wow
195000	196000	In the fall
196000	197000	Wow
197000	199000	With my AA
199000	200000	My AA

202000	203000	AA
203000	204000	Alright
204000	207000	So you'll actually have time to actually play games again, it'll be great
207000	209000	I've been playing games though
209000	210000	Alright well tell us a little bit about your gaming week
210000	214000	Even though I've had like my final projects and crap due
214000	222000	I played, well I downloaded something for free that we'll be talking about later because everybody freaking downloaded it
222000	225000	I was having a wait in the damn queue
225000	230000	And then I played that stupid gay ass unicorn game
230000	232000	Excuse you
232000	234000	No that's what it's called
234000	235000	Oh okay
235000	240000	Well you have to have the ass to make your unicorn be extra gay or something I don't know
240000	242000	Wait wait wait wait you're not talking about
242000	244000	No the one on Steam
244000	246000	Oh you played the Pink Anus game
246000	247000	Anus that was it
247000	248000	Yes
248000	250000	I thought, I was thinking of the hand he called
250000	251000	Oh gosh what was the name of it
251000	254000	Magic Stone or Legend of Magic Stone or something
254000	255000	Okay yes
255000	260000	I got as far as looking in the stable and I was like this is crap and turned it off
260000	262000	Just so those you know catching up with OLR
262000	263000	It's also very Engrishy
263000	265000	Who haven't heard the past few episodes
265000	269000	There's a game on Steam and it was Alan that brought it to our attention
269000	273000	Where in the, it's like something like about a mystical unicorn or whatever
273000	277000	And you see in the screenshots like there's like a crafting screen or something
277000	282000	And one of the materials you use is A-E-N-U-S it's anus but it's pink
282000	286000	So it's the magical unicorn with pink anus game
286000	290000	And Dark Sakura bought it cause she's a consumer whore
290000	291000	And hell
291000	296000	But no like I tried to, it's really like a click and drag type stuff to use things
296000	299000	And I was like this is like a big bad flash game
299000	302000	You can groom his hooves
302000	305000	And he was a little cult when you first got him
305000	309000	And now he's a golden unicorn with sparklies falling out of his butt
309000	310000	At least that's what it looked like
310000	313000	I put up a screen capture somewhere I think on my Twitter or something
313000	315000	You make everybody want to play this game very badly
315000	317000	Here's my review
317000	320000	Pink sparkles out of a unicorn's anus
320000	322000	It's anus
322000	324000	A-E-N-U-S
324000	325000	Anus
325000	328000	My anus is bleeding
328000	330000	Or would it be
330000	333000	It would be emus cause the neod
333000	338000	Anyway and then and then and then and then and then and then and then
338000	342000	I know you can't have it cause you can't spell your
342000	344000	Sorry
344000	346000	Um
346000	347000	Then um
347000	348000	I played other stuff
348000	350000	Yeah I played more um
350000	352000	Beluga whale
352000	355000	I'm sorry S-B-G-B
355000	357000	And um
357000	360000	I played um well well we've been
360000	362000	Well I was watching Dan play Alan Wake
362000	364000	And here's our review of it
364000	365000	Um
365000	367000	Max Payne meets Silent Hill
367000	368000	The end
368000	370000	It's actually not that bad
370000	373000	And then um
373000	375000	Oh god we played some other stuff too
375000	377000	Oh yeah I went to Pinagogo
377000	379000	So I played pinball
379000	383000	Isn't that like a big convention type thing for pinball?
383000	385000	It's in Dixon
385000	387000	Oh nevermind
387000	391000	Well no it was a pretty big event for pinball folks
391000	393000	Just to describe Dixon
393000	396000	Like if you're driving between Sacramento which is OLR headquarters
396000	398000	And you know the capital of California
398000	402000	And if you're driving between Sacramento and San Francisco which is where all the fun things are
402000	406000	Dixon is kind of like the pink anus of that drive
406000	407000	It's like
407000	408000	Sorry the pink anus
408000	411000	You look over and you see a gas station
411000	413000	A Mary's pizza shack and farms
413000	414000	That's about it
414000	415000	And fruit stand
415000	416000	And fruit
416000	418000	I went to the Yolo fruit stand yesterday but anyway
418000	420000	So yeah um I got
420000	421000	I also
421000	424000	And I forget this every year because I've been to like four Pinagogos now
424000	426000	I'm allergic to the town of Dixon
426000	429000	No seriously
429000	432000	No I'm being absolutely serious
432000	433000	Okay
433000	435000	Every time I've been to Dixon
435000	438000	I end up getting some type of weird heat stroke
438000	440000	My allergies get like
440000	442000	You know how allergic I am to dogs
442000	444000	It gets that bad
444000	445000	I swear
445000	449000	I took two doses of Benadryl Sudafed and Zyrtec
449000	452000	And I was taking local honey
452000	454000	And giving myself shots
454000	456000	And you name it for allergies I was doing
456000	458000	I was snorting crap
458000	460000	I was still like super you know
460000	462000	Eyedrops my eyeballs were floating
462000	465000	And it was just like not
465000	466000	It was not beautiful
466000	471000	I felt like that my eyeballs were the size of like
471000	473000	Double the size of my head
473000	475000	And so I went and sat in the car
475000	477000	Texted Dan I'm sick
477000	480000	I kept hiding in the bathroom because it was in a place with air conditioning
480000	483000	And um playing Final Fantasy 2
483000	487000	Sitting on the floor of the bathroom at the Dixon Mayfair
487000	488000	Sounds like fun
488000	491000	Sounds like the sophistication being sucked right out of you
491000	493000	And that's why you're having all those you know
493000	495000	Complications and stuff
495000	499000	Just like sorry you're too sophisticated for here
499000	503000	And well I finally ended up going and sat out in the car
503000	505000	So I could turn on the air conditioner
505000	507000	And filter out the pollen
507000	509000	Because you know we run the AC in my car
509000	511000	No pollen gets in you know
511000	513000	And so I was doing that long enough to get everything settled down
513000	515000	So I could take some more stuff
515000	517000	And so finally I get to where I'm feeling better
517000	519000	I drink some vitamin water I'm feeling good
519000	521000	And then Dan texts me so do you want to go home?
521000	523000	Yes
523000	529000	And not to not to not to say anything bad about the uh
529000	531000	Pina Gogo
531000	533000	Because it's a great event
533000	535000	But if you have hay fever
535000	537000	If you've got allergies to nature to grass
537000	540000	Um don't go unless you bring your own plastic bubble
540000	544000	And then it makes the plastic bubbles really can't play pinball very well in them
544000	546000	So I just totally wouldn't you know
546000	549000	I would say um a gas mask could work
549000	551000	You could actually play the gas mask on that would work
551000	553000	But as far as what I played um
553000	556000	I played uh Back to the Future
556000	558000	And I played Revenge from Mars
558000	560000	Which is one of the pinball 2000
560000	565000	And um I played F14 Tomcat
565000	571000	I was going for mostly the mid 80s to early 90s era of pinball
571000	573000	You know just kind of get into it
573000	575000	And I played this 80s
575000	577000	It's like a mullet era of pinball
577000	579000	Well I was going to say speaking of that
579000	581000	I played a pinball machine called Punk
581000	583000	And it had like the you know
583000	585000	Looked like uh pictures from uh
585000	587000	What was that movie with Nicolas Cage
587000	589000	And Valley Girl
589000	591000	You know and all the
591000	593000	The guys on the on the play field
593000	595000	Looked like Duran Duran
595000	597000	And it was kind of funny
597000	599000	Even though they weren't very punk they had that hair though
599000	601000	But um and eyeliner
601000	603000	Um and that one was actually pretty fun
603000	605000	For an old school you know
607000	609000	Earlier era of pinball
609000	611000	And there was a Beatles pinball there
611000	613000	I took a picture to send to Tiara
613000	615000	I didn't realize they made a Beatles pinball game
615000	617000	Kind of random
617000	619000	And um there was like a Spiderman
619000	621000	And the Ted Nugent one
621000	623000	I love the picture from the Ted Nugent one
623000	625000	Because he's there with his hair
625000	627000	And the guitar and the guitar's a gun
627000	629000	And he's shooting out of his guitar gun
629000	631000	And I was like rock on Ted
631000	633000	Huge anyway
633000	635000	And so uh I was
635000	637000	And my other thing and I know I'm going off on this
637000	639000	Is I was actually so caught up
639000	641000	Because me being the big design
641000	643000	Freaking nerd that I am
643000	645000	I was going around taking pictures of
645000	647000	Of interesting design
647000	649000	Of like cool pictures and neat you know
649000	651000	Early 80's late 70's style art
651000	653000	And
653000	655000	So I'll put some of the pictures up
655000	657000	They're on my phone
657000	659000	Yeah you're a nerd yeah
659000	661000	But I did play other games
661000	663000	Well I said I played Final Fantasy II didn't I?
663000	665000	Yes while you're on the bathroom floor
665000	667000	Crying and sobbing because of your allergies
667000	669000	I wasn't crying
669000	671000	And um
671000	673000	Yeah I played some Star Trek Online
673000	675000	Fun
675000	677000	I'm sure I played something else
677000	679000	Oh yeah I started playing Braid
679000	681000	And then I
681000	683000	Kind of remembered that I had to do other things like homework
683000	685000	I'm done with my finals
685000	687000	I love how you sum it up
687000	689000	I started to play this game
689000	691000	But then I was like oh god I have something better to do
691000	693000	Bye
693000	695000	No it wasn't something better to do
695000	697000	It was something responsible to do
697000	699000	Rob
699000	701000	Screw that growing up
701000	703000	So you're Robba and our other one is Robba
703000	705000	I know I know
705000	707000	Alright Loki I don't know if you can top
707000	709000	Dark Sakura's adventures in Dickson
709000	711000	Pinball and Final Fantasy II on the bathroom floor
711000	713000	While she's trying to recover from allergies
713000	715000	But you want to try?
715000	717000	I didn't go to Dickson
717000	719000	That's already an improvement right there
719000	721000	Let's see
721000	723000	I played
723000	725000	I played a lot of things that
725000	727000	Have yet to come out
727000	729000	Including APB
729000	731000	I've been playing the beta of that and I love it
731000	733000	Because it's just like
733000	735000	To me it's like crossing Saints Row with
735000	737000	Free Mode and Grand Theft Auto 4
737000	739000	You kind of
739000	741000	Do what you need to do
741000	743000	You have different missions
743000	745000	I guess this would be the tutorial portion of the game
745000	747000	They have you go
747000	749000	Spray graffiti
749000	751000	And break
751000	753000	Some stuff
753000	755000	And then eventually at the seal stuff
755000	757000	In the course later on as it's going on
757000	759000	You'll gain
759000	761000	More notoriety and
761000	763000	They'll have more enforcers
763000	765000	Coming at you
765000	767000	And the enforcers of course are played by
767000	769000	People online as well
769000	771000	So you can play
771000	773000	Both the villains and
773000	775000	Kind of the heroes I guess in the game
775000	777000	I'm playing of course as one of the gang bangers
777000	779000	Because that's fun
779000	781000	Lots of customization
781000	783000	In the character creator
783000	785000	It's just nuts
785000	787000	How much customization is in there
787000	789000	The clothing though you don't really have a lot of options
789000	791000	At first you have to kind of buy that stuff
791000	793000	Or unlock it later on
793000	795000	When you finish different missions
795000	797000	Same with cars and what not
797000	799000	But I'm really digging it
799000	801000	I might go back to
801000	803000	That as an MMO but we'll see
803000	805000	I kind of like the fact though that
805000	807000	The way they have their
807000	809000	Pay scale for it
809000	811000	Basically you pay it as you go
811000	813000	So for someone like me that doesn't
813000	815000	Necessarily get a lot of time
815000	817000	To dedicate to MMOs or stuff like that
817000	819000	It wouldn't be so bad because
819000	821000	You know the time I'm not playing it
821000	823000	I'm not actually losing out on anything
823000	825000	Because you pay for the hours that you
825000	827000	Want to use
827000	829000	It sounds good to me
829000	831000	I may try it
831000	833000	I have to upgrade my computer though too
833000	835000	So it might be a little bit
835000	837000	Other fun stuff
837000	839000	I happened to get a copy of
839000	841000	Red Dead Redemption a little early
841000	843000	So I've been playing that
843000	845000	And I love the game
845000	847000	Not a big surprise because it's a little bit like Grand Theft Auto
847000	849000	But for me
849000	851000	A lot of it's been like Oregon Trail
851000	853000	Extreme
853000	855000	Nice
855000	857000	It's a hunting portion of Oregon Trail
857000	859000	Because in the game you make money
859000	861000	You can hunt stuff and skin them
861000	863000	And take the meat and the skins
863000	865000	Or whatever
865000	867000	But you could only carry 100 pounds back to the wagon?
867000	869000	Oh no I was able to kill a lot of things
869000	871000	I don't know about 100 pounds worth of skins
871000	873000	Did you know in that game you can skin a horse?
873000	875000	I did not know that
875000	877000	Yes you can skin a horse
877000	879000	Because I got through with this one mission
879000	881000	Where I had to go
881000	883000	Kill some gang members
883000	885000	Kind of hiding in this house
885000	887000	And so we killed them
887000	889000	Captured them or whatever
889000	891000	And all their horses were left around
891000	893000	And I'm like I can't ride six horses
893000	895000	What am I going to do with this?
895000	897000	So I killed them all and skinned them
897000	899000	And sold their skins
899000	901000	For $2 each
901000	903000	And then I saw Onward Dills running around
903000	905000	Breaking news
905000	907000	PETA hates Red Dead Redemption
907000	909000	Oh I'm sure they will
909000	911000	You can kill all sorts of creatures out there
911000	913000	I haven't found the bears yet though
913000	915000	But it's really cool
915000	917000	And the fact that the game looks a lot better
917000	919000	Than Grand Theft Auto
919000	921000	Just a few years
921000	923000	And the amount of improvements in the engine
923000	925000	It's just amazing
925000	927000	Definitely worth picking up though
927000	929000	Then another game I was quite excited to check out
929000	931000	Was Split Second
931000	933000	And really digging that
933000	935000	I love how crazy the races are in the game
935000	937000	And just
937000	939000	I didn't play a whole lot of it
939000	941000	So I got to play some of the one track
941000	943000	That they had I think at E3
943000	945000	The airport
945000	947000	That's just the demo
947000	949000	I didn't play a lot of it
949000	951000	But I love the game
951000	953000	It's awesome
953000	955000	I was playing the demo
955000	957000	I'm not cool like you
957000	959000	You can get all these early games
959000	961000	In the know or whatever
961000	963000	I was playing the split second demo myself
963000	965000	It was as fun as I remember at E3
965000	967000	It was still the same game
967000	969000	That was probably
969000	971000	Funny enough probably my game of show
971000	973000	Last E3
973000	975000	Last E3 was not a huge year for me
975000	977000	But that was probably the best thing I played at the show
977000	979000	So I'm excited that game is finally coming out
979000	981000	Like Tuesday right?
981000	983000	And I'm looking forward to
983000	985000	I'm going to try some of the multiplayer in Red Dead
985000	987000	When it does come out
987000	989000	Because they do have a lot of neat multiplayer options in there
989000	991000	But at the same time I'm also working on
991000	993000	Doing another edited
993000	995000	Modded Grand Theft Auto game
995000	997000	I have some maps now
997000	999000	But there's specific rules you have to follow
999000	1001000	As far as getting stuff to work
1001000	1003000	And stuff that normally works on the PC version
1003000	1005000	Doesn't work on the console version or whatnot
1005000	1007000	But um
1007000	1009000	Oh yeah
1009000	1011000	I got to play some of the listeners
1011000	1013000	During this week's
1013000	1015000	Grand Theft Auto games
1015000	1017000	Oh finally some listeners took you up on the challenge
1017000	1019000	That was fun
1019000	1021000	And then of course
1021000	1023000	More Grand Theft Auto
1023000	1025000	I think that's really
1025000	1027000	Did you school the listeners?
1027000	1029000	Or did they school you?
1029000	1031000	I school them, I school everybody I play
1031000	1033000	And so humble
1033000	1035000	Well the only times I lose
1035000	1037000	It seems lately is when I get
1037000	1039000	Cocky and just start messing around
1039000	1041000	And then I get to the point where
1041000	1043000	They get too close and one of them gets lucky
1043000	1045000	Killing and I'm unable
1045000	1047000	To make it across the map to kill somebody
1047000	1049000	So I don't do that anymore
1049000	1051000	But no
1051000	1053000	I'm actually like ranked
1053000	1055000	67 now so I'm
1055000	1057000	Going up there trying to
1057000	1059000	Make as close to number one as possible
1059000	1061000	Moving on up, moving on up
1061000	1063000	Alright congratulations
1063000	1065000	Hey this is episode 367
1065000	1067000	Of OLR and you're number 67 on Grand Theft Auto
1067000	1069000	Hey how about that
1069000	1071000	And I did pick up 3D.GameHeroes
1071000	1073000	But I haven't played
1073000	1075000	Then we'll move to my gaming week
1075000	1077000	Because I did play 3D.GameHeroes
1077000	1079000	I picked that up as well and you know I was kind of
1079000	1081000	Motivated by the price point of just $40
1081000	1083000	It kind of seemed like a bargain to me
1083000	1085000	So I decided to pick up the game and I didn't know much about the game
1085000	1087000	Okay here's how clueless I was about the game
1087000	1089000	I thought it was kind of like a game editor
1089000	1091000	Type of game where you would get to make your own little
1091000	1093000	Adventure games
1093000	1095000	No that's not what it is so
1095000	1097000	Let's take a step back and talk about what
1097000	1099000	3D.GameHeroes actually is
1099000	1101000	It's basically a gigantic rip off
1101000	1103000	Of The Legend of Zelda
1103000	1105000	But that's cool you know like
1105000	1107000	The Legend of Zelda was a great game
1107000	1109000	It's kind of fascinating that they're getting
1109000	1111000	Away with it but hey if Nintendo
1111000	1113000	Is not going to do anything why not
1113000	1115000	Now you know when I say rip off
1115000	1117000	There's some clear parity going on here
1117000	1119000	They've changed just enough
1119000	1121000	So it's not really a rip off of Zelda like for example
1121000	1123000	You don't have hearts
1123000	1125000	You have apples
1125000	1127000	What is he called? Kidneys
1127000	1129000	That'd be funny
1129000	1131000	That's I guess maybe the core
1131000	1133000	Part of the customization of 3D.GameHeroes
1133000	1135000	Is that your hero can be anything you want
1135000	1137000	You actually have a mode where you can
1137000	1139000	Go in and edit
1139000	1141000	The default guy I guess you could say like
1141000	1143000	The person in slot number one in the character edit
1143000	1145000	Mode looks like the dude from Dragon Warrior
1145000	1147000	So I don't
1147000	1149000	Know what you're supposed to like I'm 12
1149000	1151000	So I give all my characters like 3 year old
1151000	1153000	Names I name my character vulva
1153000	1155000	So I don't know what the normal
1155000	1157000	Character name is shut up
1157000	1159000	Alan and I picked
1159000	1161000	Out a good name
1161000	1163000	Save us vulva
1163000	1165000	Save us from the evil empire
1165000	1167000	So
1167000	1169000	Yeah I don't remember what his name is
1169000	1171000	Usually
1171000	1173000	Somebody in chat will probably yell it out
1173000	1175000	But whatever it doesn't matter what his name is
1175000	1177000	The game
1177000	1179000	The game is like this giant love letter
1179000	1181000	From guys our age but in Japan
1181000	1183000	Because I know it was developed over there
1183000	1185000	Who kind of miss what gaming used to be
1185000	1187000	I mean if you think about the concept
1187000	1189000	Of this game
1189000	1191000	The story is that there's this
1191000	1193000	Where everybody stopped visiting
1193000	1195000	It and it got old because
1195000	1197000	You know just people didn't care about
1197000	1199000	It anymore so their big idea was
1199000	1201000	To go 3D to change
1201000	1203000	The world I mean that
1203000	1205000	There's kind of like this really
1205000	1207000	Hidden bitter subtext there about how
1207000	1209000	Everything is 3D in this day and age
1209000	1211000	And why can't our games be 2D anymore
1211000	1213000	So and it's just loaded
1213000	1215000	With references to old 8-bit games
1215000	1217000	Mostly Zelda but there's other stuff
1217000	1219000	In there as well that's really funny
1219000	1221000	Including more current games
1221000	1223000	Because from software the developer
1223000	1225000	They made this other great Playstation 3
1225000	1227000	Game that came out a little while ago
1227000	1229000	Called Demon Souls and there's
1229000	1231000	Actually this room in the game where
1231000	1233000	If you walk in the right spot
1233000	1235000	It says there's a message on the ground
1235000	1237000	Here something like that it says
1237000	1239000	Do you want to recommend this message?
1239000	1241000	Yes it says somewhere someone got healed
1241000	1243000	That's funny if you've played
1243000	1245000	Demon Souls if you haven't
1245000	1247000	It makes no fucking sense you're just like
1247000	1249000	What is this randomness but
1249000	1251000	Whatever but then there's a chick right next
1251000	1253000	To it and you find white sticky stuff in front of her
1253000	1255000	Which is also a Demon Souls reference
1255000	1257000	But it sounds like
1257000	1259000	Porno which is really funny
1259000	1261000	Because there's a lot of parts in this game
1261000	1263000	That really push the envelope
1263000	1265000	Of an E10 rating but it's funny
1265000	1267000	Like there's a whore
1267000	1269000	In the game you pay her to
1269000	1271000	Do the fruit fruit with you or whatever they call it
1271000	1273000	And the fufu
1273000	1275000	I don't know what it is and that's
1275000	1277000	You do the fufu
1277000	1279000	But then you wake up and it's her dad
1279000	1281000	I kid you not
1281000	1283000	I kid you not spoiler
1285000	1287000	So anyway
1287000	1289000	You know what
1289000	1291000	It's 40 bucks
1291000	1293000	The game has flaws yes it has
1293000	1295000	Flaws there's slow down
1295000	1297000	In some of the dungeons because the water
1297000	1299000	Effect that they do in the game is so
1299000	1301000	Over the top and there's a lot in this
1301000	1303000	Game that's really over the top like
1303000	1305000	I don't know the size of your sword
1305000	1307000	When you have a full health bar like takes up
1307000	1309000	The entire screen
1309000	1311000	As long as you don't get it
1311000	1313000	I was making all kinds of inappropriate jokes
1313000	1315000	Yeah
1315000	1317000	It's funny it's really over the top there's a lot
1317000	1319000	That's very over the top about this game
1319000	1321000	And they decide for whatever reason
1321000	1323000	To do the water effects really over the top
1323000	1325000	And it causes
1325000	1327000	Slow down in one of the dungeons
1327000	1329000	And it's like okay folks
1329000	1331000	This is the PlayStation
1331000	1333000	3
1333000	1335000	The government bought PlayStation 3
1335000	1337000	Where's your cell processor now
1337000	1339000	Exactly
1339000	1341000	It's like this game
1341000	1343000	And to be honest there's really nothing
1343000	1345000	About 3D Dot Game Heroes
1345000	1347000	That deserves to be on the PlayStation 3
1347000	1349000	This game could have been on the PS2
1349000	1351000	I mean yes it has trophies
1351000	1353000	And yes it's widescreen but
1353000	1355000	I think there were a handful of widescreen
1355000	1357000	Games on the PS2 as well and
1357000	1359000	That's really it
1359000	1361000	I mean graphically
1361000	1363000	You're not getting that much more oomph
1363000	1365000	On the PS3
1365000	1367000	But I'm okay with it and they give it a pass
1367000	1369000	Because again you're charging me
1369000	1371000	About the cost of a PS2 game
1371000	1373000	You know 40 bucks
1373000	1375000	And it's you know still a good time
1375000	1377000	And at the end you just have to evaluate
1377000	1379000	Did I have fun yes or no
1379000	1381000	And I had fun playing the game
1381000	1383000	Despite it's flaws
1383000	1385000	So I wouldn't give the game like an A++
1385000	1387000	But I'd give it a good like solid
1387000	1389000	It's silly
1389000	1391000	Especially if you're a gamer in that age bracket
1391000	1393000	Late 20's early 30's
1393000	1395000	Or even if you're a younger gamer
1395000	1397000	That knows your retro gaming history
1397000	1399000	Then you're gonna get a kick out of this
1399000	1401000	And get some lols
1401000	1403000	And I don't think it made our
1403000	1405000	Show roll but
1405000	1407000	They have some really cool custom characters
1407000	1409000	You can download off of their
1409000	1411000	The 3D Dot Game Heroes Hall of Heroes
1411000	1413000	Website
1413000	1415000	Including they have a little arcade game you can play as
1415000	1417000	Little girl Cthulhu
1417000	1419000	Um
1419000	1421000	Chickens
1421000	1423000	Well yeah one of the default characters in the game
1423000	1425000	Is Santa Claus so I mean that's funny
1425000	1427000	You're Santa Claus going around with a giant sword
1427000	1429000	Ha ha
1429000	1431000	The only kind of weak thing
1431000	1433000	I guess is that that's where the
1433000	1435000	Customization kind of ends
1435000	1437000	And I guess maybe with LittleBigPlanet
1437000	1439000	Being the big thing on PS3 I was hoping
1439000	1441000	For a little more
1441000	1443000	I don't know maybe I'm just being greedy
1443000	1445000	I thought there was gonna be a little more to customize here
1445000	1447000	Maybe in the sequel
1447000	1449000	And I hope there is a sequel
1449000	1451000	You know what
1451000	1453000	Something just occurred to me that I should do
1453000	1455000	I need to get RPG Maker for PC
1455000	1457000	You should
1457000	1459000	And do Orange Dodge Radio
1459000	1461000	The RPG
1461000	1463000	Is that gonna be your little project while you don't have school?
1463000	1465000	You should do that it'd be fun
1465000	1467000	Well I've got clients that I'm working for but
1467000	1469000	You know what I'm gonna leave it now
1469000	1471000	Whoever's in the chat room who wants to work with me on this
1471000	1473000	Or three years ago or three maybe
1473000	1475000	I know that Dark Dead 2 was working on something at one time
1475000	1477000	No somebody did like a text adventure
1477000	1479000	Yeah we had a text adventure
1479000	1481000	It was really funny
1481000	1483000	I don't even know where I can get a copy of that anymore
1483000	1485000	I got it somewhere
1485000	1487000	If I can find it I'll share it
1487000	1489000	Yeah I
1489000	1491000	Again you know
1491000	1493000	I'm nitpicking a little bit with 3D.GameHeroes
1493000	1495000	Overall if you wanna play
1495000	1497000	Like if you're sitting there going
1497000	1499000	Gosh I wish they would make another 2D Zelda game
1499000	1501000	That I could like play on my TV
1501000	1503000	Here you go
1503000	1505000	This game was like made for you
1505000	1507000	Enjoy. Eat it up. Get a big spoon
1507000	1509000	They have like a little big
1509000	1511000	Planet Sackboy type thing
1511000	1513000	In there called Ragdoll
1513000	1515000	It's one of the custom characters that someone made
1515000	1517000	Looks just like a little pixelated
1517000	1519000	It's just kind of a bummer that that's like
1519000	1521000	The hero is like the only thing you can change
1521000	1523000	You know what I mean?
1523000	1525000	Weren't you kind of hoping there would be like a little more
1525000	1527000	Just a little more customizability to this
1527000	1529000	Oh well
1529000	1531000	But you know what? 40 bucks. Hard to complain
1531000	1533000	SirDuckTape. Yes someone made a roll of duct tape
1533000	1535000	Alright look other games in my gaming week
1535000	1537000	I don't wanna drag this out too long
1537000	1539000	Cause we're already almost a half hour into the show
1539000	1541000	And haven't even touched gaming news yet
1541000	1543000	But I just wanted to say really quick some of the stuff I've been playing
1543000	1545000	World of Warcraft of course cause I'm addicted
1545000	1547000	And play some Game Room this week
1547000	1549000	Cause you know they're back on the ball
1549000	1551000	With getting the releases out so hooray for that
1551000	1553000	I think I talked on the show last week about Pitfall
1553000	1555000	And nearly missing the top 20 right?
1555000	1557000	I tried to do like a perfect run of the game
1557000	1559000	And you know what gets me in Pitfall
1559000	1561000	And why I can't do it?
1561000	1563000	It's the scorpions and the hidden passage
1563000	1565000	Like I have no problem
1565000	1567000	If I just run
1567000	1569000	Straight from right to left or run to the left
1569000	1571000	I can like get through 20 minutes
1571000	1573000	Running straight and not die once
1573000	1575000	And that's how I got like a score of like 85,000
1575000	1577000	But the minute I have to go into the tunnels
1577000	1579000	The scorpions eat my face
1579000	1581000	Like that's the problem I'm having on old school Pitfall
1581000	1583000	But there were also some new games this week
1583000	1585000	And one of them was Oink and I bought that game
1585000	1587000	And you've probably heard me talk about this game before
1587000	1589000	Because it was out on the 2600
1589000	1591000	And I don't think people really know this game
1591000	1593000	It was an Activision game kind of based on the story
1593000	1595000	Of the three little pigs and I think the best
1595000	1597000	Way I've heard it described anywhere
1597000	1599000	It's a reverse breakout
1599000	1601000	There's a wolf that's trying to blast the bricks
1601000	1603000	And you're trying to put the bricks back in place
1603000	1605000	Before he can blast through them to get you
1605000	1607000	And Oink is out on Game Room this week
1607000	1609000	And so I was spending some time playing this
1609000	1611000	And I just saw this before the show tonight
1611000	1615000	Bobby, the gentleman who does the show before us
1615000	1617000	On all games, the Bobby Blackwell show
1617000	1619000	Actually put a tweet out there on his tweeter
1619000	1623000	And he put, why pay $3 for Sky's favorite 2600 game?
1623000	1627000	Actually I wouldn't say it's my favorite 2600 game
1627000	1631000	But it's, I think maybe like Kaboom or Pitfall 2 would be my favorite 2600 game
1631000	1635000	But it's my most underrated
1635000	1637000	And I think most underappreciated 2600 game
1637000	1639000	When I can get the cartridge for $1
1639000	1641000	Buy it on Game Room, I'll probably buy it on Game Room anyway
1641000	1643000	And sure enough he sends a picture of Oink
1643000	1647000	Running on his TV with the Atari 2600 hooked up
1647000	1649000	I think that's a lot of people's chief complaint
1649000	1651000	About Game Room and I get that
1651000	1653000	I get that complaint
1653000	1655000	Although do keep in mind it's pretty awesome
1655000	1657000	With Oink when you go like
1657000	1659000	Gosh the best score I can get in this game is 1800
1659000	1661000	And this game is really hard
1661000	1663000	How do these people get like scores of 5000 and stuff?
1663000	1665000	Oh I can go up, fire up their replay and look at it
1665000	1667000	I mean those are like features you can't get in a dollar
1667000	1669000	Cartridge and leaderboards and challenges
1669000	1671000	And some of this other stuff
1671000	1673000	You know, does it justify the increased cost?
1673000	1675000	I don't know, it really depends on how much these games
1675000	1677000	Mean to you and so forth
1677000	1679000	There's a lot, yeah and I already did my Game Room
1679000	1681000	Tangent a couple weeks ago
1681000	1683000	I'm trying very hard not to repeat it
1683000	1685000	There's a lot of potential with Microsoft Game Room
1685000	1687000	And I really hope that potential is realized
1687000	1689000	I'm hoping E3 is gonna drop a Whopper on us
1689000	1691000	I really want them to come out at that press conference
1691000	1693000	At E3 and go
1693000	1695000	We're gonna release a Whopper of a game
1695000	1697000	On Game Room this week and it's out
1697000	1699000	Right now, go get it
1699000	1701000	And so I don't know what that game is
1701000	1703000	But hopefully something really cool
1703000	1705000	Like something not from the early early 80s
1705000	1707000	Like something
1707000	1709000	I don't know, I don't know what game that could be
1709000	1711000	Galaxian 3
1711000	1713000	I don't know what it'll be
1713000	1715000	But hopefully something they'll kind of put out
1715000	1717000	And it'll take Game Room to that next level
1717000	1719000	Where it's not just Atari 2600
1719000	1721000	And old old old old old stuff from the 80s
1721000	1723000	We'll see though
1723000	1725000	My gut tells me
1725000	1727000	Here's my bet
1727000	1729000	Quote unquote
1729000	1731000	It's gonna be a Capcom game
1731000	1733000	From their like
1733000	1735000	Street Fighter 2-ish era
1735000	1737000	When they were using that hardware
1737000	1739000	So I'm gonna play
1739000	1741000	The CPS 1 and 2
1741000	1743000	I'm gonna just
1743000	1745000	guesstimate with no
1745000	1747000	Nothing to back this up whatsoever
1747000	1749000	Cause there's already the rumors
1749000	1751000	That Capcom games are gonna make their way
1751000	1753000	Like the Mega Man fighting game
1753000	1755000	And some of that stuff is gonna make their way
1755000	1757000	To the Rock Battle
1757000	1759000	Cause Capcom supported Ultra K
1759000	1761000	In the past
1761000	1763000	So there's no reason why they wouldn't jump in on this
1763000	1765000	I'm gonna just speculate
1765000	1767000	Original Street Fighter 1
1767000	1769000	Street Fighter 1 will be the big
1769000	1771000	E3 Game Room release
1771000	1773000	I have nothing to base that off of
1773000	1775000	But half fanboyism
1775000	1777000	Half, I've been doing this show for long enough
1777000	1779000	That I feel like I start to understand the patterns
1779000	1781000	In some companies
1781000	1783000	Take it or leave it
1783000	1785000	And also in Game Room this week
1785000	1787000	Keystone Capers was released
1787000	1789000	And I played a crap ton of that
1789000	1791000	Alright, I'll stop talking about my gaming week now
1791000	1793000	We are officially a half hour into the show and haven't talked about
1793000	1795000	I've been playing a lot of Super Street Fighter 2
1795000	1799000	I got my ass handed to me in Super Street Fighter 4
1799000	1801000	This weekend
1801000	1803000	I was playing and I got schooled
1803000	1805000	And it just reminded me what a terrible
1805000	1807000	Street Fighter player I am
1807000	1809000	I was playing Super Street Fighter 2 on my
1809000	1811000	Arcade cabinet
1811000	1813000	It was fun
1813000	1815000	Go into our chat room
1815000	1817000	I think some folks are speculating what the game could be
1817000	1819000	That's released at Game Room
1819000	1821000	Or released at E3 for Game Room
1821000	1823000	SSJ100Matt speculates
1823000	1825000	Oonga Boonga will be the game
1825000	1827000	Dear Lord no
1827000	1829000	BlackWolf
1829000	1831000	Our good pal Bobby BlackWolf says
1831000	1833000	Miss Nude World USA
1833000	1835000	Oh I wish
1835000	1837000	And BlackWolf also says
1837000	1839000	Remember no online multiplayer
1839000	1841000	In Game Room so it doesn't make much sense
1841000	1843000	To do a fighting game
1843000	1845000	Well to be fair sir, it really didn't make much sense
1845000	1847000	To put combat or outlaw there
1847000	1849000	Either then for those same reasons
1849000	1851000	I mean combat is
1851000	1853000	Is pointless
1853000	1855000	If you don't have someone to play it with
1855000	1857000	And yet you're supposed to invite someone over
1857000	1859000	They get on the second controller
1859000	1861000	So you could basically cheat for the high score on that one
1861000	1863000	Donovan speculates
1863000	1865000	Custer's Revenge will be the big game that's released
1865000	1867000	You know I just
1867000	1869000	I just don't think that's going to happen
1869000	1871000	A few people in the chat talking about Kangaroo
1871000	1873000	ActDeft in chat says if Game Room releases
1873000	1875000	Kangaroo I'll buy it on release
1875000	1877000	I do want to warn you though
1877000	1879000	If they release Kongo Bongo
1879000	1881000	Which I don't know, for some reason Kangaroo makes me think
1881000	1883000	Of Donkey Kong which makes me think of Kongo Bongo
1883000	1885000	Because they were all kind of
1885000	1887000	Trying to one up each other
1887000	1889000	Kongo Bongo is on the Sega Genesis
1889000	1891000	Uber collection
1891000	1893000	Be careful if Sega games start showing up
1893000	1895000	On Game Room because a lot of them
1895000	1897000	Are on that collection
1897000	1899000	Don't get swindled
1899000	1901000	Alright let's move on to some
1901000	1903000	Actual gaming news for heaven's sakes
1903000	1905000	Housekeeping, join us on Twitter
1905000	1907000	Twitter.com slash o-l-r, join us on Facebook
1907000	1909000	Orange Lawns Radio, yada yada
1909000	1911000	Blah blah blah gaming news, Loki
1911000	1913000	So Activision
1913000	1915000	Apparently is taking some
1915000	1917000	Lessons that they
1917000	1919000	Possibly have learned from
1919000	1921000	Lawsuits and what not
1921000	1923000	They are dropping celebrities from the next Guitar Hero
1923000	1925000	Game so you will not see any
1925000	1927000	You know
1927000	1929000	Dead Kurt Cobain's or whatever
1929000	1931000	Singing
1931000	1933000	Well to be fair, Kurt Cobain was not
1933000	1935000	Portrayed as dead in the game because I think
1935000	1937000	If he was that would have been a whole other issue
1937000	1939000	That would have been a whole other issue
1939000	1941000	You just got he's on the stage
1941000	1943000	No head
1943000	1945000	Zombie Kurt Cobain
1945000	1947000	So yeah, so they're basically
1947000	1949000	Their claim is
1949000	1951000	They're going back to the basics
1951000	1953000	This is coming from the latest issue of the official
1953000	1955000	Xbox Magazine
1955000	1957000	Some of the old Guitar Hero
1957000	1959000	Characters, the ones that were actually unique to
1959000	1961000	The game are coming back and you'll
1961000	1963000	Be able to recruit
1963000	1965000	Characters by playing their song sets
1965000	1967000	And once you do that you can also
1967000	1969000	Unlock their alter egos
1969000	1971000	So for example Lars would become
1971000	1973000	Like warrior Lars
1973000	1975000	And that will allow you to
1975000	1977000	Get a
1977000	1979000	Times six multiplier
1979000	1981000	Quick play
1981000	1983000	I guess is being revamped
1983000	1985000	Of course
1985000	1987000	The DLC from
1987000	1989000	Guitar Hero 5 and before that
1989000	1991000	It will be compatible with Guitar Hero 6
1991000	1993000	They're doing
1993000	1995000	I guess streaker's momentum
1995000	1997000	Do or die are now available in
1997000	1999000	Online competitive modes
1999000	2001000	New power challenges
2001000	2003000	Queen, kiss
2003000	2005000	Black Sabbath, they're confirmed to be
2005000	2007000	In the game, I guess quest mode will
2007000	2009000	Feature Gene Simmons as a narrator
2009000	2011000	Because he needs money
2011000	2013000	Does he have a
2013000	2015000	TV show, does he get money from that
2015000	2017000	Well, he's freaking Gene Simmons
2017000	2019000	All he has to do is go in a freak show and
2019000	2021000	Stick out his tongue, you know what though, he was on the Celebrity
2021000	2023000	Apprentice and that's, you know
2023000	2025000	If you're resorting to going, Joan Rivers
2025000	2027000	Was on the Celebrity Apprentice
2027000	2029000	And that's Joan Rivers, her career's kind
2029000	2031000	Of not gone
2031000	2033000	Now she's got a movie coming out and all this stuff
2033000	2035000	A couple years ago
2035000	2037000	They claim there's going to be a bigger focus on rock and roll
2037000	2039000	Right
2039000	2041000	Focus on rock and roll
2041000	2043000	Well I'm glad they're making a bigger focus
2043000	2045000	On rock and roll and not, I don't know
2045000	2047000	Making money
2047000	2049000	Why do I just have this feeling, like I'm not trying to be negative
2049000	2051000	Or be a fanboy or whatever, but why do I just have
2051000	2053000	This feeling that in E3
2053000	2055000	We're going to see Rock Band 3 and it's just going to
2055000	2057000	Blow this shit out of the water
2057000	2059000	Like it's just going to annihilate Guitar Hero
2059000	2061000	Let me play this way
2061000	2063000	Um
2063000	2065000	I don't really
2065000	2067000	Give a crap about, I mean look at
2067000	2069000	Look at Guitar Hero 5, what exactly did
2069000	2071000	Guitar Hero 5 do that was that
2071000	2073000	Great over Guitar Hero World Tour
2073000	2075000	Nothing really
2075000	2077000	I mean it was pretty much, hey look
2077000	2079000	We have new songs
2079000	2081000	Yeah? Yeah?
2081000	2083000	How about we throw in
2083000	2085000	Or throw in Van Halen
2085000	2087000	Eh, two games to press one
2087000	2089000	Is that the first game with the whole
2089000	2091000	You can do four singers if you want
2091000	2093000	And four guitarists and all that stuff
2093000	2095000	Wow that's awesome, we're going to put
2095000	2097000	Four drummers in my house, yeah cause
2097000	2099000	That makes sense
2099000	2101000	Um
2101000	2103000	I don't know, it sounds dumb
2103000	2105000	And this one doesn't sound that great to me
2105000	2107000	But you know what, I'm kind of biased because
2107000	2109000	I don't really care for the Guitar Hero series really
2109000	2111000	Once I had Rock Band 2 it was just like
2111000	2113000	I don't really care
2113000	2115000	You know I've got all these download songs
2115000	2117000	That I need to buy another game
2117000	2119000	Rock Band 3, I'm going to kind of consider it
2119000	2121000	The same thing unless I see them doing
2121000	2123000	Something really unique with it
2123000	2125000	Although I do have faith in harmonics that they're
2125000	2127000	Going to actually put something out decent
2127000	2129000	That's going to be
2129000	2131000	Different enough from the last game
2131000	2133000	So, props to them for that
2133000	2135000	But, I mean look at like the Guitar Hero
2135000	2137000	Um, their song creator
2137000	2139000	And stuff that they had in game, that was supposed to be
2139000	2141000	Like this huge feature and everyone's kind of like
2141000	2143000	Eh, whatever
2143000	2145000	You know, so
2145000	2147000	We'll see, I mean
2147000	2149000	We don't know a lot about it yet
2149000	2151000	But, I'm not expecting much
2151000	2153000	Just like with DJ Hero 2
2153000	2155000	I'm not expecting much
2155000	2157000	New songs, that's about it
2157000	2159000	Which could be a good thing, because if you set the expectation bar really low
2159000	2161000	Then, you know, they have the potential to really
2161000	2163000	Overcome that, whereas I think the
2163000	2165000	Expectation bar with Rock Band 3
2165000	2167000	Is really high, at least for me
2167000	2169000	Like, I'm expecting this game to really blow me
2169000	2171000	Out of the water, because they've had a couple years
2171000	2173000	To kind of perfect it now
2173000	2175000	They didn't do a Rock Band game last year, you know what I mean
2175000	2177000	Well, okay, yeah, they had the Beatles
2177000	2179000	But you saw the progression from Rock Band 2
2179000	2181000	To the Beatles interface, so you're kind of
2181000	2183000	Yeah, and like, was this
2183000	2185000	You know, the Green Day Rock Band stuff, I mean that's basically
2185000	2187000	Just Beatles being reskinned
2187000	2189000	With Green Day stuff, and it's
2189000	2191000	You know, it's basically like a track pack
2191000	2193000	But there is a lot of songs in the game
2193000	2195000	And, you know, just like
2195000	2197000	Guitar Hero Metallica or Aerosmith
2197000	2199000	Or something like that, I really don't give a crap about
2199000	2201000	Green Day Rock Band
2201000	2203000	I guess even the same could have been said about Lego Rock Band
2203000	2205000	Yet I purchased it anyway
2205000	2207000	Although Lego Rock Band had a really good setlist
2207000	2209000	So I did like that, but
2209000	2211000	You know, I basically dumped the songs in the game
2211000	2213000	And then sold it back, so
2213000	2215000	Whatever
2215000	2217000	I don't know, it'll be
2217000	2219000	Interesting to see what happens
2219000	2221000	Hopefully we'll, you know, obviously we're gonna know more
2221000	2223000	After E3
2223000	2225000	Alright, well let's move on talking about some other
2225000	2227000	Big, big news that landed this week
2227000	2229000	I just had everybody talking, and this is one of those things
2229000	2231000	That I don't think is gonna be news to you guys
2231000	2233000	But I wanna take some time out
2233000	2235000	To talk about it and get folks' thoughts here in studio
2235000	2237000	And those of you in chat room, and that is
2237000	2239000	EA's big announcement this week
2239000	2241000	At what exactly they mean
2241000	2243000	When they're talking about Project
2243000	2245000	$10, and the deal is
2245000	2247000	That Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11
2247000	2249000	Which is gonna be the first game that has this
2249000	2251000	Enabled, it's coming out June 8th
2251000	2253000	So just a couple weeks here
2253000	2255000	The EA Sports games for PS3 and
2255000	2257000	Xbox 360 will include a title
2257000	2259000	Specific online pass
2259000	2261000	This will enable you to do
2261000	2263000	Online services, features, and bonus
2263000	2265000	Content, however if your code
2265000	2267000	Has already been redeemed, meaning
2267000	2269000	You bought the game used, you
2269000	2271000	Got it on Gamefly, or borrowed
2271000	2273000	It from a friend, then you
2273000	2275000	Can get an additional online pass
2275000	2277000	For $10
2277000	2279000	Of course you get a 7 day free
2279000	2281000	Trial, so I guess if you rent it from
2281000	2283000	Gamefly, you'll at least get that
2283000	2285000	It's gonna depend
2285000	2287000	What it is, depending on the game you have
2287000	2289000	But EA has mentioned that
2289000	2291000	It will be, it could include
2291000	2293000	Meaning it probably will include
2293000	2295000	Basic online multiplayer
2295000	2297000	That could also include group and league features
2297000	2299000	Roster and playbook updates
2299000	2301000	Downloads, of like
2301000	2303000	The user based stuff
2303000	2305000	Tournament support, and so forth
2305000	2307000	So that's the direction
2307000	2309000	They're going in, where now if you
2309000	2311000	Get this game used, you're gonna have to pay an extra
2311000	2313000	$10 if you're gonna want to enable it online
2313000	2315000	Not the first time
2315000	2317000	We've really seen something like this
2317000	2319000	Ever happen
2319000	2321000	Right? Because you know, there's been
2321000	2323000	Other games that have charged
2323000	2325000	You know, the
2325000	2327000	Money for extra stuff, you know
2327000	2329000	If you wanna redeem the code, but it's interesting now
2329000	2331000	That you're talking about what I think a lot
2331000	2333000	Of people have come to take for granted online
2333000	2335000	And that is basic, head to head
2335000	2337000	Online matches. Dark
2337000	2339000	Sakura, what do you think?
2339000	2341000	About the whole
2341000	2343000	Project $10 thing, where you know
2343000	2345000	Folks are now having to pay
2345000	2347000	$10 if they wanna play their sports
2347000	2349000	Game online
2349000	2351000	That's
2351000	2353000	I understand
2353000	2355000	The logic behind it
2355000	2357000	What I think
2357000	2359000	It's not really gonna
2359000	2361000	I think
2361000	2363000	People expect for online play
2363000	2365000	Just to be a given, you know?
2365000	2367000	Yeah
2367000	2369000	So yeah, it kinda sucks
2369000	2371000	You feel like to some extent you're getting nickel and dimed
2371000	2373000	But it's tough because
2373000	2375000	Like
2375000	2377000	Well at least if you buy the game new
2377000	2379000	It's included, whatever
2379000	2381000	So if you're buying the game new, nothing really changes for you
2381000	2383000	I guess the difficult part for me
2383000	2385000	Is that
2385000	2387000	I see the logic behind it
2387000	2389000	And it's hard for me to argue with it
2389000	2391000	Because yeah, game developers kinda lose a little money
2391000	2393000	On the used market, this is a way for them to make it back
2393000	2395000	Whatever
2395000	2397000	So
2397000	2399000	Is that I already pay for Xbox Live
2399000	2401000	That's what I was about to say
2401000	2403000	You know, you pay for these services already
2403000	2405000	If they really
2405000	2407000	Wanted it to be
2407000	2409000	Something they could make more money on
2409000	2411000	They should just have like
2411000	2413000	I don't know
2413000	2415000	More download packs
2415000	2417000	They're not losing any money
2417000	2419000	Either off of used sales
2419000	2421000	If you think about it
2421000	2423000	If I sell my game used to somebody
2423000	2425000	Out there that's, you know, floating around
2425000	2427000	You know, it's not like
2427000	2429000	I copied my copy
2429000	2431000	And now there's two people playing
2431000	2433000	A game that you paid for once
2433000	2435000	It's just still one person playing
2435000	2437000	And so it is kind of
2437000	2439000	A dick move to do this
2439000	2441000	And you know what, the fact that they haven't dropped the price of their game
2441000	2443000	You know, it's still
2443000	2445000	Kinda messed up
2445000	2447000	What's even dumber, the whole thing
2447000	2449000	Was that GameStop was actually quoted
2449000	2451000	They were like, yeah we think this is a great idea
2451000	2453000	The quote you're thinking of
2453000	2455000	CEO Dan DeMatteo
2455000	2457000	I think says this
2457000	2459000	GameStop is excited to partner with such a
2459000	2461000	Forward thinking publisher as Electronic Arts
2461000	2463000	This relationship allows us to
2463000	2465000	Capitalize on our investments
2465000	2467000	To market and sell downloadable content
2467000	2469000	Online as well as through our
2469000	2471000	Network of stores worldwide
2471000	2473000	Are you kissing or sucking over there?
2473000	2475000	Here's the thing I think
2475000	2477000	Is because they're probably
2477000	2479000	Getting other back end deals for this stuff
2479000	2481000	Like for example, if you look at Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11
2481000	2483000	On GameStop's website
2483000	2485000	You get a $10 off future order
2485000	2487000	When you purchase Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11
2487000	2489000	The $10 coupon code
2489000	2491000	Will be emailed
2491000	2493000	When the order ships
2493000	2495000	So basically they're getting some sort of kickback money
2495000	2497000	That they're passing out to their customers to make it more
2497000	2499000	Appealing to them to buy the new game
2499000	2501000	Well yeah
2501000	2503000	And I want to say this too
2503000	2505000	DarkTetsuya in our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com says
2505000	2507000	So then the game itself will only cost
2507000	2509000	$59.99 new, right EA?
2509000	2511000	Right? No
2511000	2513000	It's still going to cost $59.99
2513000	2515000	Or let's just say $60
2515000	2517000	Because unless you live in Oregon or one of those other states with no sales tax
2517000	2519000	You're going to pay $60 plus for it
2519000	2521000	The thing to keep in mind though
2521000	2523000	This won't affect you if you're buying your games new
2523000	2525000	Because you get your free code
2525000	2527000	With the game and you know since it's new
2527000	2529000	That no one's used it, etc, etc
2529000	2531000	So you know that you're good
2531000	2533000	That means
2533000	2535000	Isn't GameStop going to have to alter their policy now
2535000	2537000	That they're not going to take returns on these games anymore?
2537000	2539000	No they will take the returns on the games
2539000	2541000	It's just like you know
2541000	2543000	Download content that would be coming with the game
2543000	2545000	You know they do this a lot now
2545000	2547000	Where they're bundling in some DLC
2547000	2549000	Like a coupon or something like that for
2549000	2551000	You know the first piece of DLC for free
2551000	2553000	Or like some in-game hat or something like that
2553000	2555000	That you get for free
2555000	2557000	Just to entice people to buy new games
2557000	2559000	But the thing for me
2559000	2561000	And you know I don't know
2561000	2563000	Because I don't play sports games a lot
2563000	2565000	You know I wouldn't care
2565000	2567000	For me if I were to buy Tiger Woods
2567000	2569000	You know I wouldn't care
2569000	2571000	That I couldn't play online
2571000	2573000	I wouldn't buy Tiger Woods
2573000	2575000	Well that too yeah
2575000	2577000	The only thing that bothers me about this
2577000	2579000	Yeah I don't play a lot of these sports games
2579000	2581000	Either so there's a lot of me that goes
2581000	2583000	Nah nah nah doesn't affect me
2583000	2585000	But I do worry about the precedent
2585000	2587000	This is going to set for the future
2587000	2589000	Because EA does make other games I do play
2589000	2591000	And granted I buy most of my games
2591000	2593000	Used or I mean sorry new
2593000	2595000	So a lot of this won't affect me anyway
2595000	2597000	I do use Gamefly a little bit
2597000	2599000	But probably these are not the type of games
2599000	2601000	I would be getting
2601000	2603000	I worry about the precedent it sets
2603000	2605000	And the part that kind of irritates me
2605000	2607000	Is that I feel like I'm being double dipped
2607000	2609000	I'm paying for Xbox Live
2609000	2611000	And now you want me to pay for this as well
2611000	2613000	If it's used that I have a problem with
2613000	2615000	It's weird like I will admit
2615000	2617000	I am weird this is weird
2617000	2619000	I don't have a problem with it on PlayStation
2619000	2621000	It's free there's not a lot for me to complain
2621000	2623000	About there you can't say like
2623000	2625000	Oh well you know it's wrong for them
2625000	2627000	To charge you to use their servers and all
2627000	2629000	That stuff when
2629000	2631000	You know you're not really paying anything for
2631000	2633000	It in the first place and if you want to use these features
2633000	2635000	Then you know I get it but I thought
2635000	2637000	That's what I was already paying for on Xbox Live
2637000	2639000	I understand that EA
2639000	2641000	Uses their own servers and I understand
2641000	2643000	That it's kind of separate like that
2643000	2645000	But then does that mean that the restriction
2645000	2647000	Will be removed where I no longer need an
2647000	2649000	Xbox Live Gold account to play these online
2649000	2651000	If that's the case
2651000	2653000	Then okay I guess
2653000	2655000	That it's the same as the PlayStation
2655000	2657000	And I can't really argue but otherwise I feel
2657000	2659000	Like I'm being charged twice
2659000	2661000	Do you seriously think that Microsoft is gonna
2661000	2663000	Let an online service go without
2663000	2665000	Going through Xbox Live?
2665000	2667000	Yes Final Fantasy 11
2667000	2669000	That is different I think
2669000	2671000	When you're dealing with Square
2671000	2673000	Well this is EA
2673000	2675000	Okay well here's the thing
2675000	2677000	I don't think that EA is in
2677000	2679000	Squares
2679000	2681000	They made the exception because Final Fantasy 11
2681000	2683000	Was built to be on the PS2
2683000	2685000	And Microsoft wanted a piece of that
2685000	2687000	They wanted it they thought it was gonna be
2687000	2689000	Probably the bigger thing than it really ended up being
2689000	2691000	What have you so they made an exception
2691000	2693000	But it just goes to show an exception
2693000	2695000	Can be made
2695000	2697000	But I think that also
2697000	2699000	It was the fact that
2699000	2701000	They would be getting something that no one
2701000	2703000	Would have ever expected to be on one of their systems
2703000	2705000	So
2705000	2707000	That was I think to get
2707000	2709000	Really to get into the market share
2709000	2711000	They're going to get EA games
2711000	2713000	Anyway
2713000	2715000	EA would be completely
2715000	2717000	Just butt-tarded
2717000	2719000	To not put out a game on
2719000	2721000	Xbox 360 I mean
2721000	2723000	There's it They're doing a lot of stuff
2723000	2725000	In this project $10 they have the way
2725000	2727000	That they changed the DLC the way
2727000	2729000	They kind of give it to you
2729000	2731000	In Mass Effect 2
2731000	2733000	You know this is not the first company
2733000	2735000	To try this they did the same thing with
2735000	2737000	SOCOM on the PSP to try to
2737000	2739000	You know
2739000	2741000	Curtail people buying the used game
2741000	2743000	But
2743000	2745000	My problem is
2745000	2747000	Basically like GameStop
2747000	2749000	You know their money is made and used product
2749000	2751000	And
2751000	2753000	They've been ballsy enough
2753000	2755000	Before to make you know publishers
2755000	2757000	Pay for shelf space and stuff like that
2757000	2759000	Why can't they be ballsy now they go
2759000	2761000	We think this is a stupid idea
2761000	2763000	What's EA going to do
2763000	2765000	Oh we're going to stop selling our games to your stores
2765000	2767000	They're not going to take a cut that big
2767000	2769000	I mean they may try to
2769000	2771000	Make that bluff
2771000	2773000	But I mean if you call them on it they're not going to do anything
2773000	2775000	And even if they did
2775000	2777000	You know what I've seen Blockbuster
2777000	2779000	Blockbuster or Movie Gallery or somebody
2779000	2781000	You know they stopped carrying
2781000	2783000	A certain vendor's
2783000	2785000	Product for quite a while
2785000	2787000	And just basically saying
2787000	2789000	Well if you don't want to play by our rules
2789000	2791000	Then we're just going to stop carrying your product
2791000	2793000	And it hit them big time and they ended up
2793000	2795000	Kind of settling with them
2795000	2797000	Okay let me go check because there's lots and lots
2797000	2799000	And lots of chatty chat comments I want to read here
2799000	2801000	And most of it's coming from Bobby
2801000	2803000	He definitely has a lot to say on this
2803000	2805000	BobbyBlackWolf in chat
2805000	2807000	You're ripped off if you buy the game used for $55
2807000	2809000	Then you'd have to pay $65
2809000	2811000	To get the game plus online
2811000	2813000	But buying the game used for $40
2813000	2815000	And buying the $10 online is still
2815000	2817000	More than buying the game new
2817000	2819000	And EA still gets a tiny bit of money
2819000	2821000	So you win, you got a cheaper game
2821000	2823000	EA wins, they get money to pay their SysAdmins
2823000	2825000	And GameStop wins because you bought a used game from them
2825000	2827000	Okay I want to stop there because
2827000	2829000	I get what you're saying
2829000	2831000	And I'm like 95% with you
2831000	2833000	But the soccer moms
2833000	2835000	Buying the games for these kids
2835000	2837000	Lose because they don't understand
2837000	2839000	That there's a hidden $10 fee that's going to come with this
2839000	2841000	And you know what else
2841000	2843000	Sucks too?
2843000	2845000	EA, they shut down their servers after some time
2845000	2847000	So you paid for the money
2847000	2849000	You paid the extra money to play this game online
2849000	2851000	And then it's not there
2851000	2853000	If all of that is disclosed in the agreement
2853000	2855000	I'm borderline comfortable with it
2855000	2857000	And then
2857000	2859000	There's kind of like a little bit of back and forth
2859000	2861000	Between BlackWolf and ToaGak
2861000	2863000	And some stuff here
2863000	2865000	BlackWolf says Phantasy Star Online also doesn't
2865000	2867000	Require a gold subscription
2867000	2869000	Any game that has it's own monthly fee
2869000	2871000	Does not require the Xbox Live gold
2871000	2873000	And ToaGak was trying to recall
2873000	2875000	A game that required them both
2875000	2877000	Couldn't think of one and Bobby says
2877000	2879000	Oh you can't remember haha
2879000	2881000	Well this $10 is not a monthly fee though
2881000	2883000	It's just a one time fee
2883000	2885000	To do the game for the duration
2885000	2887000	And you do get the 70 trials
2887000	2889000	So you can try it out
2889000	2891000	If the online is really not something that you care for
2891000	2893000	Then you don't have to do it
2893000	2895000	The other thing I was thinking of
2895000	2897000	And I'm sure that they've thought of this
2897000	2899000	And they don't have SystemLink in the game anymore
2899000	2901000	You can use tunneling services
2901000	2903000	To actually play online with other people
2903000	2905000	So you can use that
2905000	2907000	It basically acts like
2907000	2909000	It's a SystemLink game but you're playing it over
2909000	2911000	The internet like you did with the GameCube
2911000	2913000	And stuff like that with Mario Kart
2913000	2915000	Again, I don't know
2915000	2917000	I'm just a little worried like
2917000	2919000	What happens next
2919000	2921000	Like if this ends up being acceptable
2921000	2923000	Then what happens next
2923000	2925000	You know
2925000	2927000	They get you for $10 here
2927000	2929000	And you know, I don't know
2929000	2931000	They're not losing money left and right either
2931000	2933000	I mean this kind of stuff
2933000	2935000	And it's an experiment for them
2935000	2937000	They're just saying, huh, what can we get away with
2937000	2939000	It's just like the $15 map packs
2939000	2941000	For Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2
2941000	2943000	What can we get away with
2943000	2945000	$15, let's see if people buy this
2945000	2947000	Oh, people are buying this like crazy
2947000	2949000	Let's release another map pack for $15
2949000	2951000	I mean it's just
2951000	2953000	If people are going to buy this stuff left and right
2953000	2955000	And just not even think about it
2955000	2957000	There's going to be a lot of people that decide
2957000	2959000	Hey, we're going to buy this game used
2959000	2961000	Better off if you really want to get this game cheaper
2961000	2963000	Don't buy it used
2963000	2965000	Just wait for the drop in price and buy it new
2965000	2967000	And I guess
2967000	2969000	The moral of the story, if you will
2969000	2971000	Is so we can kind of move on with some other news
2971000	2973000	If you don't like it, don't buy it
2973000	2975000	Don't say you're going to
2975000	2977000	Don't be one of those left for dead
2977000	2979000	Two petitioners
2979000	2981000	That sign the petition against the game
2981000	2983000	And then are caught on Steam playing the game
2983000	2985000	The day it comes out
2985000	2987000	If you are really against this
2987000	2989000	Don't buy it and mean it
2989000	2991000	How about
2991000	2993000	Something a little bit more
2993000	2995000	Possibly encouraging
2995000	2997000	Or maybe face palming
2997000	2999000	Maybe a little bit
2999000	3001000	Walmart
3001000	3003000	Actually is
3003000	3005000	Going to be back in the
3005000	3007000	Used game
3007000	3009000	Business
3009000	3011000	They're going to be working with Game Trade
3011000	3013000	A startup services provider
3013000	3015000	With a lease to test
3015000	3017000	Their little game trade stores
3017000	3019000	In different Walmart places
3019000	3021000	There's only about five of them
3021000	3023000	But it's going to be previously owned games
3023000	3025000	Movies
3025000	3027000	Hardware
3027000	3029000	Basically you get store credit or cash
3029000	3031000	So yeah
3031000	3033000	They're going to be
3033000	3035000	I guess what GameStop was
3035000	3037000	For used games
3037000	3039000	Only Walmart
3039000	3041000	Well they didn't really get out of
3041000	3043000	The used game market
3043000	3045000	The company going under that was doing their kiosk
3045000	3047000	Kind of
3047000	3049000	They didn't have a choice
3049000	3051000	So they're kind of trying the same thing again
3051000	3053000	I don't think they launched it full
3053000	3055000	Steam
3055000	3057000	While that company was working with them
3057000	3059000	DVD Play
3059000	3061000	I don't remember ever seeing used games at Walmart
3061000	3063000	They were in test locations
3063000	3065000	Test locations of a new company
3065000	3067000	E-Play is what it was
3067000	3069000	They were doing it with Best Buy
3069000	3071000	And they went out of business
3071000	3073000	So now this new company
3073000	3075000	Coming out trying to do the same thing
3075000	3077000	We'll see what happens there
3077000	3079000	It's a tough market to compete in
3079000	3081000	But granted
3081000	3083000	Used games, there's not a lot of kiosks
3083000	3085000	Out there for that stuff
3085000	3087000	It could catch on
3087000	3089000	It might be neat
3089000	3091000	I just worry about those things
3091000	3093000	There's too many ways to exploit them
3093000	3095000	I don't know
3095000	3097000	With competitions dwindling
3097000	3099000	It's nice to see
3099000	3101000	I guess GameStop is going to have a little competitor
3101000	3103000	Because competition is good
3103000	3105000	Especially when news like this comes out
3105000	3107000	And there might be a $10 hidden surcharge
3107000	3109000	On your used games
3109000	3111000	It's nice that
3111000	3113000	There's going to be a little competition there
3113000	3115000	But I just don't think I like that
3115000	3117000	That competition is Walmart
3117000	3119000	Well, I mean
3119000	3121000	Walmart does everything else
3121000	3123000	Do we really need them in this too?
3123000	3125000	You know, money gets tight
3125000	3127000	And you need to buy dinner
3127000	3129000	You can always trade in your game
3129000	3131000	And buy dinner with the coupon
3131000	3133000	Or the store credit that you get
3133000	3135000	That's always good
3135000	3137000	Hard to argue with that, okay
3137000	3139000	At least there's that option
3139000	3141000	But as far as
3141000	3143000	As far as trading in stuff
3143000	3145000	I don't know
3145000	3147000	Really what they need
3147000	3149000	Out there is a website
3149000	3151000	And this would be pretty impossible to get
3151000	3153000	GameStop to be sharing what their trading prices are
3153000	3155000	But if there was a website to
3155000	3157000	Compare trading prices based on
3157000	3159000	Title per these different places
3159000	3161000	That would be kind of cool
3161000	3163000	But once again, they're not going to give that information out
3163000	3165000	No, I don't think they're going to give that out either
3165000	3167000	You know, and
3167000	3169000	The other kind of little worry I have
3169000	3171000	Is that there's going to be a lot of Walmart employees
3171000	3173000	That are going to get taken advantage of
3173000	3175000	Because, you know, one thing about GameStop
3175000	3177000	Is that most, and it really depends on
3177000	3179000	Which one you're going to, but most of them
3179000	3181000	Are going to hire people that are at least somewhat game savvy
3181000	3183000	Again, depends on the store
3183000	3185000	But I would worry that a place like Walmart
3185000	3187000	Isn't going to really care
3187000	3189000	And there's going to be a lot of people to get taken advantage of
3189000	3191000	And buy back games that are
3191000	3193000	All scratchy
3193000	3195000	Yucky and codes are used
3195000	3197000	Here's the problem though, Rob, with that
3197000	3199000	It's a kiosk
3199000	3201000	It's a machine
3201000	3203000	How does the machine know what games are in good condition and what aren't
3203000	3205000	It tries to read them
3205000	3207000	It reads this
3207000	3209000	It checks them
3209000	3211000	To see if they're able to be read
3211000	3213000	The problem is, though
3213000	3215000	You could trick the machine by using
3215000	3217000	Some sort of burn disk or something like that
3217000	3219000	And it might help you
3219000	3221000	Tell the difference between it
3221000	3223000	Of course, then you have your credit card
3223000	3225000	But, once again, it's also easy
3225000	3227000	To buy a, you know
3227000	3229000	A prepaid credit card
3229000	3231000	And you can do the same thing
3231000	3233000	Put whatever, you know, person's name
3233000	3235000	Social on there that you want
3235000	3237000	And do it and you can get away with the money
3237000	3239000	You should be telling people how to do this on the show
3239000	3241000	I'm just saying, hey, I think, you know
3241000	3243000	I work out the flaws
3243000	3245000	If you thought of it, somebody a little more shady
3245000	3247000	Has definitely already thought of it
3247000	3249000	So, it, I mean, but
3249000	3251000	Then again, not everybody's thinking that way
3251000	3253000	So, you could probably
3253000	3255000	Factor that in
3255000	3257000	But, um
3257000	3259000	It'll be interesting to see
3259000	3261000	Hey, who thought, you know, renting DVDs from a kiosk
3261000	3263000	Was going to take off
3263000	3265000	Not a lot of people did
3265000	3267000	Still not going to make me stop shopping at Target
3267000	3269000	Over Walmart
3269000	3271000	But, hey, you know what, though
3271000	3273000	If it takes off at Walmart, who says that Target's not going to do it
3273000	3275000	And, you know, if this company is anything like
3275000	3277000	ePlay was, they could easily have
3277000	3279000	The same damn kiosk
3279000	3281000	It just, you know, branded with the Target stuff
3281000	3283000	And it would be the same service right there
3283000	3285000	And they could double dip, basically, in the market
3285000	3287000	And there's nothing really stopping them from doing that
3287000	3289000	Unless they sign some sort of weird contract for it
3289000	3291000	Which they very well might have
3291000	3293000	Very true
3293000	3295000	We'll see what happens
3295000	3297000	Um, so there's some rumors now regarding
3297000	3299000	When, uh, the PlayStation Move
3299000	3301000	And Natal's going to be launched
3301000	3303000	Um, the rumor is that
3303000	3305000	PlayStation Move is supposed to launch in September
3305000	3307000	This is coming from Jason Bradbury
3307000	3309000	The host of Britain's
3309000	3311000	The Gadget Show
3311000	3313000	Apparently, he's proclaiming
3313000	3315000	That the PlayStation Move controller
3315000	3317000	Will take, uh, be released
3317000	3319000	In September
3319000	3321000	On his Twitter account
3321000	3323000	Another thing I was meaning to say
3323000	3325000	September for PlayStation Move, I'm sure of it
3325000	3327000	Can't say why, just September 2010
3327000	3329000	I
3329000	3331000	Well, I mean, if I was a betting man
3331000	3333000	That's a pretty good bet
3333000	3335000	It's gonna be this fall, okay
3335000	3337000	You know it's fall
3337000	3339000	And you know it's before Black Friday
3339000	3341000	It must, must, must be before Black Friday
3341000	3343000	So what does that really leave?
3343000	3347000	October, November, and maybe September
3347000	3349000	Here's how you know when
3349000	3351000	Uh, the PlayStation Move is scheduled
3351000	3353000	To come out, is you look at the titles that are
3353000	3355000	Supporting the PlayStation Move and where they're
3355000	3357000	Sitting as far as releases go
3357000	3359000	And everything that I've seen so far is pointing
3359000	3361000	To November, which makes sense because that's when
3361000	3363000	They seem to launch new consoles and whatnot
3363000	3365000	Um, so I would be betting
3365000	3367000	November
3367000	3369000	So, we'll see
3369000	3371000	So you are going to go against the British guy
3371000	3373000	From Gadgets or whatever
3373000	3375000	I don't know who the fuck Jason Bradbury is
3375000	3377000	From the Gadgets show
3377000	3379000	Good for you, you think something
3379000	3381000	I think you should challenge Jason Bradbury
3381000	3383000	To a throwdown
3383000	3385000	A throwdown?
3385000	3387000	A hoedown throwdown
3387000	3389000	Whatever, I could be like Michael Patcher
3389000	3391000	And say random shit, and if I'm right
3391000	3393000	I'm a genius, if I'm wrong, no one will remember
3393000	3395000	So, whatever
3395000	3397000	I'm an analyst!
3397000	3399000	We should just start calling you an analyst
3399000	3401000	We need to have a segment on the show, analyst Loki
3401000	3403000	No, but I'm serious
3403000	3405000	Wait
3405000	3407000	I'm serious though, like look at
3407000	3409000	Look at IPET
3409000	3411000	IPET is supporting the Playstation move
3411000	3413000	And that's supposed to be coming out in the fall
3413000	3415000	Lord of the Rings, Eragon's Quest
3415000	3417000	Whatever is supposed to be coming out in the fall
3417000	3419000	As well, because that's now supporting
3419000	3421000	The move on the Playstation 3
3421000	3423000	Um
3423000	3425000	LittleBigPlanet 2 will probably be coming out
3425000	3427000	Like this fall, I'm guessing
3427000	3429000	It's all going to be around the same time
3429000	3431000	Um
3431000	3433000	I just, I don't know about September
3433000	3435000	I guess it could be September
3435000	3437000	If you think about it, because
3437000	3439000	They are starting to support games now
3439000	3441000	With the Playstation move stuff
3441000	3443000	So, you know, publishers have access to it
3443000	3445000	And I guess they could do that
3445000	3447000	But I would be more willing to bet it's going to be
3447000	3449000	Closer to Christmas
3449000	3451000	Just to catch in on that holiday buying madness
3451000	3453000	You know, we'll see
3453000	3455000	Now see, where's that story going to be on all the
3455000	3457000	Game blogs tomorrow, that
3457000	3459000	World renowned, years long
3459000	3461000	Running, game analist, Loki
3461000	3463000	Has predicted on
3463000	3465000	Some little
3465000	3467000	Crappy web show
3467000	3469000	Just like this other thing
3469000	3471000	The gadget show or whatever
3471000	3473000	That move is coming out in November
3473000	3475000	He is sure of it, folks
3475000	3477000	He is sure of it
3477000	3479000	Let me just put it this way, okay
3479000	3481000	This goes, you know, both against me and against him
3481000	3483000	Just because we're hosts of a show
3483000	3485000	Doesn't mean we know what we're talking about
3485000	3487000	I mean, so, you know
3487000	3489000	Just because he hosts a TV show
3489000	3491000	Does not mean he knows exactly when
3491000	3493000	The Playstation move is coming out
3493000	3495000	It's a good guess, fourth quarter, duh
3495000	3497000	It's going to be coming out fourth quarter, so
3499000	3501000	Whenever that is, if it's September, great
3501000	3503000	It'll be nice and early
3503000	3505000	But, you know, from what I've seen
3505000	3507000	Their major Sony releases
3507000	3509000	Have either been in November or October
3509000	3511000	October like last year, for example
3511000	3513000	Because he had Uncharted 2
3513000	3515000	Um
3515000	3517000	God, there was other Sony titles last year
3517000	3519000	But LittleBigPlanet was also
3519000	3521000	In October as well
3521000	3523000	Although Resistance 2, I believe
3523000	3525000	Was in
3525000	3527000	November, so
3527000	3529000	It's all around that same time
3529000	3531000	They have release schedules
3531000	3533000	What about Natal, then?
3533000	3535000	Okay, Project Natal
3535000	3537000	What does our analysts think about Project Natal?
3537000	3539000	They're saying that it's going to be releasing
3539000	3541000	In October
3541000	3543000	This is according to
3543000	3545000	Microsoft's
3545000	3547000	Saudi vendor
3547000	3549000	He's not even really working for
3549000	3551000	Microsoft
3551000	3553000	Although they
3553000	3555000	Quote him as working with Microsoft
3555000	3557000	Apparently G4 has said that
3557000	3559000	Said Bilal
3559000	3561000	Tariq
3561000	3563000	There's a source you can trust
3563000	3565000	Is not a Microsoft employee
3565000	3567000	He is a vendor employed through a
3567000	3569000	Third party company on behalf of Microsoft
3569000	3571000	A subsidiary in
3571000	3573000	Saudi Arabia
3573000	3575000	And uh
3575000	3577000	Pardon me, pardon me. Can I do just a quick
3577000	3579000	This is a very important poll
3579000	3581000	We need to do in
3581000	3583000	Chat, okay? And I realize
3583000	3585000	Our audience is biased
3585000	3587000	But I still think this is a question worth asking
3587000	3589000	So quick poll in chat
3589000	3591000	Who do you trust more?
3591000	3593000	G4
3593000	3595000	Or
3595000	3597000	Analist Loki
3597000	3599000	Or Loki
3599000	3601000	Ready go
3601000	3603000	Well I agree, I don't think he's an employee
3603000	3605000	They're just saying
3605000	3607000	That they're reporting that he's not an employee
3607000	3609000	Okay, but he was the one
3609000	3611000	Apparently that was saying that
3611000	3613000	We will be in position to confirm the day after
3613000	3615000	E3, which is in June
3615000	3617000	But definitely it's going to be October 2010
3617000	3619000	And we will have it in Saudi Arabia
3619000	3621000	For sure
3621000	3623000	I don't think it's going to be definitely in
3623000	3625000	October
3625000	3627000	And once again it's because all the major
3627000	3629000	Stuff that's been released
3629000	3631000	Is usually around that November time
3631000	3633000	Now granted they could do
3633000	3635000	The fall update early, it's going to be
3635000	3637000	Timed with the fall update basically
3637000	3639000	You're going to have the fall update slightly
3639000	3641000	Before
3641000	3643000	This is launched, just like
3643000	3645000	When they did the avatars, the new
3645000	3647000	Xbox experience, whatever
3647000	3649000	They had
3649000	3651000	Their new scenic game come out slightly
3651000	3653000	Before
3653000	3655000	This new update came out
3655000	3657000	So you kind of look at what the games are
3657000	3659000	What games are supporting Natal and stuff
3659000	3661000	And what their release schedule is going to be like
3661000	3663000	And you can kind of guess when
3663000	3665000	Natal is going to come out
3665000	3667000	And if at E3
3667000	3669000	They're going to be showing off Gears of War 3
3669000	3671000	Which obviously is not coming out until next year I guess
3671000	3673000	But maybe another
3673000	3675000	Fourth quarter title is going to be really big
3675000	3677000	I'm guessing it's going to be
3677000	3679000	Around the November timeframe
3679000	3681000	September would be too early
3681000	3683000	I mean they're saying in October
3683000	3685000	So the end of October would sound
3685000	3687000	Right
3687000	3689000	Let's go to the results of our quick poll chat
3689000	3691000	And our chatroom, chat.ornsonshooter.com
3691000	3693000	Who do you trust more, G4 or Loki?
3693000	3695000	We have Loki, Natalist Loki
3695000	3697000	I trust Bananaman, Loki for sure
3697000	3699000	Homer Simpson, Natalist Loki
3699000	3701000	Natalist Loki
3701000	3703000	I trust the bird because the bird is the word
3703000	3705000	Well everybody said
3705000	3707000	About the bird
3707000	3709000	Yeah, stop it
3709000	3711000	Let's see
3711000	3713000	Loki
3713000	3715000	At least he mentions games I work on
3715000	3717000	We all trust Loki because we all love Secret Club
3717000	3719000	Natalist Loki over anything
3719000	3721000	Although anything is better than G4
3721000	3723000	I don't know, G4 has hotness
3723000	3725000	G4 has Ninja Challenge
3725000	3727000	That is a good point
3727000	3729000	G4 does have Ninja Challenge
3729000	3731000	Loki, not the OLR, the Norse god
3731000	3733000	I've trusted Loki with my life before
3733000	3735000	Or budget at least
3735000	3737000	And there you go
3737000	3739000	I'd be willing to bet that we'll find out
3739000	3741000	Probably before it's released
3741000	3743000	I mean, well
3743000	3745000	Obviously we're going to find out before it's released
3745000	3747000	But we were going to find out before
3747000	3749000	They announce it, let me put it that way
3749000	3751000	Alright
3751000	3753000	Well, do you think you know
3753000	3755000	A catchphrase that ought to be
3755000	3757000	In the next NBA Jam
3757000	3759000	If you have the next Boomshakalaka
3759000	3761000	If you know
3761000	3763000	Boomshakalaka, he's on fire
3763000	3765000	If you have the next
3765000	3767000	Catchphrase for NBA Jam
3767000	3769000	They want to know
3769000	3771000	EA Sports has come out
3771000	3773000	Oh, this means you'll have to pay $10 to play it online
3773000	3775000	EA Sports has come out and said
3775000	3777000	That they're doing
3777000	3779000	This whole little contest about
3779000	3781000	The next catchphrase in NBA Jam
3781000	3783000	Of course it's taking place on Facebook
3783000	3785000	Go to facebook.com slash NBA Jam
3785000	3787000	And you can submit your entries
3787000	3789000	Up until May 19th
3789000	3791000	9am pacific time
3791000	3793000	That doesn't give you much time
3793000	3795000	On the top 64 entries
3795000	3797000	And the one with the highest votes
3797000	3799000	Will be immortalized in
3799000	3801000	The game
3801000	3803000	Now they say the entries must be
3803000	3805000	Associated with one of the following actions
3805000	3807000	In the game
3807000	3809000	Dunks, assists, alley oops
3809000	3811000	Blocks, 3 point shots
3811000	3813000	2 point field goal
3813000	3815000	On fire shots, steals
3815000	3817000	Shot clock violations, rebounds
3817000	3819000	Miss shots
3819000	3821000	Catchphrases should avoid a reference to specific
3821000	3823000	NBA players and they must not contain
3823000	3825000	Pornography, illicit content and must be
3825000	3827000	Appropriate for audiences 13 years of age
3827000	3829000	I listened to the
3829000	3831000	Ad for that
3831000	3833000	Dan played it the other day, I was like
3833000	3835000	Dude, it's the guy
3835000	3837000	AlphaCananagram suggests
3837000	3839000	And Boom Goes the Dynamite
3839000	3841000	That's a great
3841000	3843000	YouTube clip by the way, if you've never seen it
3843000	3845000	I think that should be in the game
3845000	3847000	Boom Goes the Dynamite
3847000	3849000	I don't know, I'm thinking that maybe they could
3849000	3851000	You know, do something with
3851000	3853000	The bird
3853000	3855000	No, no
3855000	3857000	SSJ100Matt
3857000	3859000	Saying that we should have an OLR catchphrase
3859000	3861000	In it, I don't know, what OLR catchphrase
3861000	3863000	Would lend itself to basketball
3863000	3865000	I don't know, like ferret
3865000	3867000	That doesn't really work, exterminate
3867000	3869000	Can you really, I mean that's really a Doctor Who
3869000	3871000	Thing that we just kind of stole
3871000	3873000	What other OLR catchphrases do we have?
3873000	3875000	I don't know, do we have other catchphrases?
3875000	3877000	Your mom
3877000	3879000	There's Rob Rob Rob Rob What
3879000	3881000	I don't know
3881000	3883000	I don't think that'll do it
3883000	3885000	Some other folks are saying
3885000	3887000	That they should try to sneak in an
3887000	3889000	OLR reference into the catchphrases
3889000	3891000	I really don't know what that
3891000	3893000	OLR catchphrase would be
3893000	3895000	Ferret
3895000	3897000	Duck Island, okay
3897000	3899000	Duck Island might work
3899000	3901000	He made that shot all the way from
3901000	3903000	Duck Island
3903000	3905000	They'd be like, what?
3905000	3907000	He's not coming in from Duck Island
3909000	3911000	No, how about no
3911000	3913000	It's just J100 Matt
3913000	3915000	Says friend your butt
3915000	3917000	He'll friend your butt
3917000	3919000	Dunk
3921000	3923000	No, that won't work either
3923000	3925000	Cause that might not be appropriate for audiences
3925000	3927000	Under 13, alright
3927000	3929000	Maybe that'll be a future-less list, I don't know
3929000	3931000	Although the contest will be over by then, we'll see
3931000	3933000	Look at him
3933000	3935000	Paddle those balls
3935000	3937000	No
3937000	3939000	That ain't appropriate
3939000	3941000	But it did make me laugh
3941000	3943000	It did make me laugh
3943000	3945000	Alright
3945000	3947000	Let's move on with some more news
3947000	3949000	And of course release dates coming up
3949000	3951000	And the classic game of the week at some point tonight
3951000	3953000	Well how about something that isn't crappy
3953000	3955000	There's a Castlevania
3955000	3957000	game coming out on the iPhone, Rob
3957000	3959000	OMG what?
3959000	3961000	Yeah
3961000	3963000	It's a
3963000	3965000	Encore of the night
3965000	3967000	Which is really
3967000	3969000	It's gonna be hard to control, right
3969000	3971000	Puzzle game
3971000	3973000	It's like
3973000	3975000	When I looked at it, I was like
3975000	3977000	Oh, it's Puzzle Fighter and Puzzle Quest
3977000	3979000	So
3979000	3981000	Yeah, so basically the little screen capture on here
3981000	3983000	is Alucard playing against one of the fish guys
3985000	3987000	Who hangs out in Dracula's basement
3987000	3989000	But it could be fun
3989000	3991000	I think I'm gonna try it out, you know
3991000	3993000	But it also looks like it's timed
3993000	3995000	Each of your little matches is timed
3995000	3997000	Because there's an hourglass
3997000	3999000	But why can't they just
3999000	4001000	Or maybe when the timer runs out
4001000	4003000	Something bad happens
4003000	4005000	Like the fish guy
4005000	4007000	Takes a big poop or something, I don't know
4007000	4009000	And eats your face
4009000	4011000	And poops your face
4011000	4013000	Yes
4013000	4015000	It could be cool
4015000	4017000	I
4017000	4019000	I guess
4019000	4021000	I like puzzle games, I like Castlevania
4021000	4023000	It's all in the price
4023000	4025000	It's all in the price
4025000	4027000	By the way, some more suggestions for the NBA Jam
4027000	4029000	Thing from our chat, and I gotta say this is my favorite
4029000	4031000	So far from SSG100 Matt
4031000	4033000	D-d-d-d-dongle
4033000	4035000	That's a good one
4035000	4037000	That's a good one
4037000	4039000	I might be saying this wrong
4039000	4041000	Shez-ro
4041000	4043000	Shez-ro
4043000	4045000	Shez-ro says double down
4045000	4047000	You know, like in reference to Loki's
4047000	4049000	Least favorite KFC food
4049000	4051000	Alright, let's move on to some release dates
4051000	4053000	We're gonna travel around the world and look at some
4053000	4055000	Release dates, Loki
4055000	4057000	We're gonna look at some release dates
4057000	4059000	No, it doesn't really work for
4059000	4061000	NBA Jam
4061000	4063000	No, it doesn't
4063000	4065000	Yeah, actually some good stuff coming up this week
4065000	4067000	Kind of the
4067000	4069000	Big push for
4069000	4071000	Games until
4071000	4073000	Memorial Day, woo
4073000	4075000	July, July is like that
4075000	4077000	But this week though we have SplitSecond coming out on
4077000	4079000	Playstation 3 and Xbox 360
4079000	4081000	Highly recommend picking that up, it's actually pretty awesome
4081000	4083000	Oh, and also on PC apparently
4083000	4085000	Shrek Forever After
4085000	4087000	for the little tykes, of course the new
4087000	4089000	Tie-in game with that movie that
4089000	4091000	Thankfully is done
4091000	4093000	No more Shrek movies, thank you
4093000	4095000	They'll be coming out on Playstation 3
4095000	4097000	Xbox 360
4097000	4099000	Wii, DS, and PSP
4099000	4101000	Prince of Persia
4101000	4103000	The Forgotten Sands
4103000	4105000	Making its way out on Playstation 3, Xbox 360
4105000	4107000	Wii and DS and PSP
4107000	4109000	The PSP version
4109000	4111000	Is supposed to be 2D and then they're also
4111000	4113000	Re-releasing Prince of Persia
4113000	4115000	Sands of Time on Playstation 2
4115000	4117000	In case you haven't picked that up and feel
4117000	4119000	Festive with the movie coming out and everything
4119000	4121000	The game I'm
4121000	4123000	Definitely gonna be playing
4123000	4125000	A lot this week, Red Dead Redemption
4125000	4127000	Coming out on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360
4127000	4129000	This week
4129000	4131000	City Builder
4131000	4133000	Coming out on the Wii until the Forgotten
4133000	4135000	About game that no one will be picking up
4135000	4137000	Attack of the Movies
4137000	4139000	3D, it's a parody
4139000	4141000	Of a bunch of movies including Terminator
4141000	4143000	And you know
4143000	4145000	Alien, Mummy
4145000	4147000	It's got 3D glasses and you can play
4147000	4149000	It is an on-rails
4149000	4151000	Shooter game and what makes it
4151000	4153000	Even more bizarre is it's coming out on
4153000	4155000	360 as well, how the fuck is that
4155000	4157000	Gonna work
4157000	4159000	With the analog sticks I guess
4159000	4161000	Horrible decision
4161000	4163000	And then of course Alan Wake making its way
4163000	4165000	Out on Xbox 360
4165000	4167000	And they're also doing the limited edition
4167000	4169000	For that this week as well
4169000	4171000	And that's
4171000	4173000	Basically it
4173000	4175000	It's just J100 Matt in our chat room
4175000	4177000	That play was better than a DS
4177000	4179000	Master email
4179000	4181000	Oh I'm sorry, how did I miss this
4181000	4183000	I must have scrolled too quickly
4183000	4185000	Imagine Animal Doctor Care Center on DS
4185000	4187000	And then a better game
4187000	4189000	Blue Dragon Awaken Shadows
4189000	4191000	Come out on DS as well
4191000	4193000	Blue Dragon
4193000	4195000	I got a good one
4195000	4197000	He's on, FIRED
4197000	4199000	Rob
4199000	4201000	Rob
4201000	4203000	Rob
4203000	4205000	That's the slow Rob
4205000	4207000	And of course one week from today
4207000	4209000	Super Mario Galaxy 2
4209000	4211000	Going to Japan and looking at the release dates
4211000	4213000	On the Xbox 360, Lost Planet 2
4213000	4215000	Senko no Ronde Duo
4215000	4217000	Comes out on the Xbox 360 as well
4217000	4219000	That is
4219000	4221000	An updated version of an old game
4221000	4223000	That's now on the Xbox 360
4223000	4225000	New graphics and everything
4225000	4227000	Tropico 3 also, again these are Japanese
4227000	4229000	Release dates and the Xbox 360 is getting
4229000	4231000	A whole little bundle for Lost Planet 2
4231000	4233000	There you go
4233000	4235000	Going over to the Playstation 3 and looking at
4235000	4237000	What's coming out there
4237000	4239000	Another Lost Planet 2
4239000	4241000	The port for the PS3 is coming out there
4241000	4243000	World Soccer winning 11 2010
4243000	4245000	Aoki Samurai no Chosen
4245000	4247000	Comes out there as well
4247000	4249000	There's also a brand new
4249000	4251000	Hori Pad if you want to check that out
4251000	4253000	If you are into the Japanese peripherals
4253000	4255000	You can look at that
4255000	4257000	On the Nintendo Wii this week, not a lot
4257000	4259000	World Soccer winning 11 2010 comes out this week
4259000	4261000	Next week, just so you know, is the Japanese
4261000	4263000	Release of Red Steel 2
4263000	4265000	They don't have that game yet
4265000	4267000	On the Playstation 2
4267000	4269000	Tier Nanog is getting a price reduction
4269000	4271000	Coming out, there's also a port of World Soccer
4271000	4273000	Winning 11 2010 and a few games
4273000	4275000	In the Lucien Bees series
4275000	4277000	There's Evil Violet and Justice Yellow
4277000	4279000	So I'm guessing those are like Pokemon
4279000	4281000	E types of games
4281000	4283000	On the Nintendo DS, Captain Tsubasa
4283000	4285000	Gekitou no Kiseki
4285000	4287000	Comes out this week
4287000	4289000	That is a soccer type of game
4289000	4291000	I guess with all the winning 11, the DS wants in on the action
4291000	4293000	It's also a manga
4293000	4295000	Different game, oh is it, is it a soccer manga type of thing?
4295000	4297000	Yeah
4297000	4299000	And then coming out on the PSP
4299000	4301000	Heganni no Rekinjutsushi
4301000	4303000	Full Metal Alchemist
4303000	4305000	Yakuzoku no Hiei
4305000	4307000	Yes, it's a Full Metal Alchemist game
4307000	4309000	On the PSP
4309000	4311000	As to what type of game it is
4311000	4313000	I think you actually kind of get to play
4313000	4315000	As Ed and Al
4315000	4317000	You get to
4317000	4319000	I don't know if it's like a
4319000	4321000	Kind of like a little 3D adventure game
4321000	4323000	With a lot of cut scenes and dialogue
4323000	4325000	So it's a
4325000	4327000	I think it'll do Full Metal Alchemist fans
4327000	4329000	Some justice there, so check that out
4329000	4331000	On the PSP this week in Japan
4331000	4333000	Those are Japanese release dates
4333000	4335000	In the UK
4335000	4337000	We have on the 18th Dragon Age
4337000	4339000	Origins, Darkspawn Chronicles
4339000	4341000	On the 21st
4341000	4343000	Mud Nation Racers, Morphex
4343000	4345000	Prince of Persia, The Forgotten Sands
4345000	4347000	All Star Karate
4347000	4349000	Red Dead Redemption
4349000	4351000	and Rooms the Main Building
4351000	4353000	Oh yeah, and Split Second Velocity
4353000	4355000	Busy week
4355000	4357000	Yep
4357000	4359000	Alright
4359000	4361000	More gaming news and then the classic game of the week
4361000	4363000	Coming right up and
4363000	4365000	Dark Sakura, I'm not going to spoil what the game is
4365000	4367000	This week, but she just picked a game where she's like
4367000	4369000	Yeah, pretty much everyone
4369000	4371000	Says this is a classic
4371000	4373000	So we'll get to that in a little bit
4373000	4375000	To put it a little bit more
4375000	4377000	It's a game that
4377000	4379000	Dan and I played a lot of when we first
4379000	4381000	Got together
4381000	4383000	It has sentimental value
4383000	4385000	Alright, we'll get to that in just a moment, Loki
4385000	4387000	Apparently, you know, we kind of alluded to this
4387000	4389000	A little bit last week when we were talking about
4389000	4391000	Mega Man Universe
4391000	4393000	The trademark that was filed by Capcom
4393000	4395000	Recently
4395000	4397000	Well, it's been announced that
4397000	4399000	Capcom is working on an MMO
4399000	4401000	Called Mega Man Online
4401000	4403000	And according to
4403000	4405000	GameSpot, they're saying it's being
4405000	4407000	co-developed by Korea's
4407000	4409000	NeoWiz Games
4409000	4411000	They're responsible for EA Sports
4411000	4413000	FIFA Online
4413000	4415000	And
4415000	4417000	Possibly
4417000	4419000	Possibly might be related to the Mega Man
4419000	4421000	Universe game
4421000	4423000	Well, maybe it's
4423000	4425000	Could be different names, different regions
4425000	4427000	Yeah
4427000	4429000	You never know
4429000	4431000	I don't know
4431000	4433000	That's kind of neat
4433000	4435000	I don't know what they're really going to do for a Mega Man Online game
4435000	4437000	But it'll be pretty awesome, I'm sure
4437000	4439000	I'm going to kind of approach this with a big
4439000	4441000	Huh
4441000	4443000	It's just kind of like
4443000	4445000	How would a Mega Man Online game
4445000	4447000	Work?
4447000	4449000	But then I think about Mega Man Legends
4449000	4451000	And I'm like, huh
4451000	4453000	This could be interesting
4453000	4455000	I'm not sure how yet
4455000	4457000	Or imagine if you're not really playing as Mega Man
4457000	4459000	But imagine if you got to be like your own
4459000	4461000	Robot Master boss
4461000	4463000	That'd be kind of rad, actually
4463000	4465000	I don't know, there's just
4465000	4467000	Things that make you go hmm
4467000	4469000	There's definitely a big hmm factor with this
4469000	4471000	I don't know, I don't know what to think
4471000	4473000	I'll need to see screenshots or something
4473000	4475000	Do you think you'll get to see more of this at E3?
4475000	4477000	It might be a little early, but
4477000	4479000	That'd be kind of neat if they announced something
4479000	4481000	Very cool
4481000	4483000	Alright, well we'll see what happens
4483000	4485000	With Mega Man Online
4485000	4487000	DarkSakura, do you like the idea
4487000	4489000	Of Mega Man going online, or is it
4489000	4491000	Enough of the freaking MMOs already?
4491000	4493000	It's a good idea
4493000	4495000	Yay for whoever wants to play it
4495000	4497000	Good for them
4497000	4499000	Ask Star Trek Online, dude
4499000	4501000	Even if you got to be a Robot Master boss
4501000	4503000	There's no Robot Master boss you'd want to be
4503000	4505000	Well
4505000	4507000	No
4507000	4509000	Alright
4509000	4511000	It's Sakura Woman
4511000	4513000	Loki could finally have Pizza Man
4513000	4515000	For reals
4515000	4517000	That reference is about 5 years old on this show
4517000	4519000	Pizza Man
4519000	4521000	I think there's a clip of that
4521000	4523000	Let me tell you how old that reference is
4523000	4525000	There's a clip of that on our
4525000	4527000	MySpace
4527000	4529000	Oh, we were talking about the Mega Man 2
4529000	4531000	Sound effect thing
4531000	4533000	Yeah, there you go, you got it
4533000	4535000	Alright, one more story for you guys
4535000	4537000	We were talking about music games a little bit earlier
4537000	4539000	In the show, it's very interesting
4539000	4541000	Because apparently there are rumors
4541000	4543000	If you want to believe this Swedish retailer
4543000	4545000	Webhallen
4545000	4547000	They are believing that a Pearl Jam
4547000	4549000	Rock band is in the
4549000	4551000	Works
4551000	4553000	Apparently some box art has leaked out
4553000	4555000	Although this could be one of those mock ups
4555000	4557000	To get you to pre-order things
4557000	4559000	MTV is saying up and down
4559000	4561000	They have not announced anything besides
4561000	4563000	Green Day Rock Band and Rock Band 3
4563000	4565000	But they are quick to say
4565000	4567000	We have a great relationship with Pearl Jam
4567000	4569000	And hope to have many of their more awesome music in the game
4569000	4571000	In the future
4571000	4573000	Hmm
4573000	4575000	Here's where I have a problem with this right now
4575000	4577000	They've
4577000	4579000	Given it a Peggy rating on the box art
4579000	4581000	This early
4581000	4583000	The fact that they haven't even announced the game yet
4583000	4585000	It would not have a rating
4585000	4587000	It would be rating pending
4587000	4589000	Very good point
4589000	4591000	It's fake
4591000	4593000	Wishful thinking basically
4593000	4595000	I mean, I don't know
4595000	4597000	I kind of go, okay, yeah, I could see Pearl Jam
4597000	4599000	Getting their own rock band
4599000	4601000	We've talked about this on the show before
4601000	4603000	There's only certain bands that can have a rock band
4603000	4605000	Not every band
4605000	4607000	Is worthy of having a rock band game
4607000	4609000	Dedicated to them, but Pearl Jam, okay
4609000	4611000	There was a survey that came out
4611000	4613000	That was asking people what dedicated rock band
4613000	4615000	Games would you like to see, which artists
4615000	4617000	Would you want to see have their game
4617000	4619000	And Pearl Jam was on the list
4619000	4621000	So I think it's a little bit wishful thinking
4621000	4623000	It's kind of like how
4623000	4625000	With, you know, even if you look at GameStop's
4625000	4627000	Website and stuff like that
4627000	4629000	There's a bunch of listings for games
4629000	4631000	Like pilot wings for the Wii and stuff like that
4631000	4633000	Stuff that doesn't exist
4633000	4635000	That they're taking pre-orders on
4635000	4637000	Just in case, you know
4637000	4639000	That kind of stuff
4639000	4641000	That rock band ABBA, that's the one I want
4641000	4643000	By the way, apparently
4643000	4645000	Yeah, they are doing
4645000	4647000	That little test right now
4647000	4649000	But there's also some news about how well these games
4649000	4651000	Are selling
4651000	4653000	The NPD group is saying that Guitar Hero Van Halen
4653000	4655000	Only sold 94,000 copies
4655000	4657000	Which kind of makes it a poop
4657000	4659000	However, it's hard to say
4659000	4661000	Does that count the free ones that went out?
4661000	4663000	Because that sort of would
4663000	4665000	Kind of screw those numbers, wouldn't it?
4665000	4667000	It's copies sold
4667000	4669000	So I would imagine, yes it does
4669000	4671000	Well to put it in perspective, Guitar Hero Aerosmith
4671000	4673000	Sold 2.7 million copies
4673000	4675000	Guitar Hero Metallica
4675000	4677000	Sold 1 million copies
4677000	4679000	Beetle Rock Band, 1.2 million copies
4679000	4681000	Guitar Hero Aerosmith
4681000	4683000	Sold twice as many
4683000	4685000	As Beetle's rock band
4685000	4687000	Well, think about it though, Guitar Hero Aerosmith
4687000	4689000	Was first, it was the first
4689000	4691000	Kind of, you know
4691000	4693000	One group exclusive
4693000	4695000	Game that came out, and it seems like the numbers
4695000	4697000	Have slowly gone down since then
4697000	4699000	And the Van Halen just kind of pooped
4699000	4701000	You know, it didn't do much, but it's hard to say
4701000	4703000	Because again, they were given that away for free
4703000	4705000	Can you really trust that number? I don't know
4705000	4707000	It'll be very interesting to see how the
4707000	4709000	Guitar Hero Green Day sells
4709000	4711000	You know what's also not accounted for in here
4711000	4713000	I'm sorry, did I say Guitar Hero Green Day?
4713000	4715000	I meant Rock Band Green Day
4715000	4717000	What's also not accounted for in here is the
4717000	4719000	ACDC Rock Band game that came out
4719000	4721000	I don't see that in here anywhere
4721000	4723000	It was like a live ACDC game, it was exclusive to
4723000	4725000	Walmart for a little while, but then it wasn't
4725000	4727000	I don't see numbers for that anywhere in here
4727000	4729000	Because there's no numbers for that
4729000	4731000	Probably, and just for reference
4731000	4733000	On the Peggy website
4733000	4735000	There is no listing for that new Rock Band game
4735000	4737000	If it had a rating, it would be listed on there
4737000	4739000	See? Analist Loki
4739000	4741000	Squelching the rumors
4741000	4743000	Right here at Orange Lounge Radio
4743000	4745000	Alright
4745000	4747000	Just out of curiosity though, if they did
4747000	4749000	Do a band based game
4749000	4751000	A one band game, is there any band you'd want to see?
4751000	4753000	No
4753000	4755000	No
4755000	4757000	Dark Soccer, any bands you think are deserving of their full
4757000	4759000	Rock Band game?
4759000	4761000	Electric Light Orchestra!
4761000	4763000	Sorry, I've been on an ELO kick lately
4763000	4765000	ABBA Rock Band, you think I'm kidding?
4765000	4767000	Radiohead Rock Band
4767000	4769000	I would be down with a Radiohead Rock Band actually
4769000	4771000	But I just don't see Radiohead as the type of band
4771000	4773000	That would want to be a part of that
4773000	4775000	And you know
4775000	4777000	I know they said, oh well on the Rock Band Network
4777000	4779000	It could happen
4779000	4781000	I would like to see some drum based tracks
4781000	4783000	Come out on Rock Band
4783000	4785000	Like, you know, get some Pendulum in there
4785000	4787000	Something like that
4787000	4789000	I mean that would be pretty cool
4789000	4791000	With some guitar stuff in there
4791000	4793000	I guess it would be really difficult to do on drums
4793000	4795000	But it would be neat to see
4795000	4797000	Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room
4797000	4799000	He's getting a lot of comments tonight
4799000	4801000	But he's saying some good stuff
4801000	4803000	Well that was a track pack
4803000	4805000	It wasn't actually a separate game
4805000	4807000	It wasn't listed as a separate game, it was a track pack
4807000	4809000	Yes but Bobby, technically you can play it by itself
4809000	4811000	Therefore it is kind of a separate game
4811000	4813000	I get what he's saying though
4813000	4815000	It's in the vein of those country packs
4815000	4817000	And the things they sold individually
4817000	4819000	But yeah, I thought of it as a separate game
4819000	4821000	Could you buy the ACDC stuff?
4821000	4823000	You can buy it and play it by itself
4823000	4825000	I didn't think you could buy it from within Rock Band
4825000	4827000	No, you can't buy it within Rock Band
4827000	4829000	You can buy the track pack
4829000	4831000	You can buy it by itself or dump it into your game
4831000	4833000	Donovan's suggesting Village People Rock Band
4833000	4835000	Blackwolf again says
4835000	4837000	I'd like to see Rush or U2
4837000	4839000	Funny T-Man says
4839000	4841000	Golden Girls Rock Band
4841000	4843000	There you go
4843000	4845000	It could be the Betty White version of
4845000	4847000	Thank You for Being a Friend from Saturday Night Live a couple weeks ago
4847000	4849000	Anyhow, let's get into
4849000	4851000	Speaking of old classics
4851000	4853000	Because when doesn't the Golden Girls seem to come up on this show lately?
4853000	4855000	Old classics!
4855000	4857000	Because I want to be Betty White when I grow up
4857000	4859000	Dark Soccer likes to dig through the gaming vault
4859000	4861000	And find a game that she says
4861000	4863000	Hey, hey, listen
4863000	4865000	Hey, listen
4865000	4867000	You kids ought to be playing this game
4867000	4869000	It's the classic video game of the week
4869000	4871000	And I think though this week
4871000	4873000	She's managed to pick a game that
4873000	4875000	Most people have played
4875000	4877000	But if you haven't
4877000	4879000	What the hell? Seriously
4879000	4881000	Where the hell have you been?
4881000	4883000	Let's get to it
4883000	4885000	Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
4885000	4887000	Super Mario 64
4887000	4891000	Super Mario 64
4891000	4893000	Yeah, this
4893000	4895000	I have to say
4895000	4897000	This is one of my favorite ever
4897000	4899000	Nintendo 64 games
4899000	4901000	Probably one of my favorite
4901000	4903000	It's up there in my list of favorites
4903000	4905000	It was, you know
4905000	4907000	The first real dive
4907000	4909000	Into 3D for Mario
4909000	4911000	And it was one of those games
4911000	4913000	That controller just seemed to be made for
4913000	4915000	But I love the music
4915000	4917000	Can you turn it up for a minute?
4923000	4925000	I love the early level
4927000	4929000	I also love that you can go up to
4929000	4931000	A sleeping piranha plant
4931000	4933000	And punch him in the face
4933000	4935000	Cause look, he's about to do it here too
4935000	4937000	But that was like, there were just so many
4937000	4939000	Little fun things, you know, you could do the wall jump
4939000	4941000	You could also glitch the game hardcore
4941000	4943000	And just beat it right from the very get go
4943000	4945000	If you were really good at the wall jump
4945000	4947000	See, he punched the piranha plant in the face
4947000	4949000	Sure did, in the face
4949000	4951000	Mario's hardcore like that
4951000	4953000	He's a thug
4953000	4955000	At any rate
4955000	4957000	The game starts off
4957000	4959000	At Princess Peach's castle
4959000	4961000	And she writes him a letter
4961000	4963000	And says, I baked you a cake
4963000	4965000	Even though I'm a princess and have servants
4965000	4967000	To do it for me
4967000	4969000	I think it was also the first game in the US
4969000	4971000	Where we got her name as being Peach
4971000	4973000	If you think about it though, she is a princess
4973000	4975000	She could take credit for what her servants did
4975000	4977000	And their, you know
4977000	4979000	I baked this for you
4979000	4981000	By me, I mean I own these servants that made it for you
4981000	4983000	I want to say she was actually Peach
4983000	4985000	In Mario 3
4985000	4987000	I think, well I know Mario Kart
4987000	4989000	Was on Super Nintendo and that was before this
4989000	4991000	I'm pretty sure Mario 3 called her Peach
4991000	4993000	At any rate
4993000	4995000	You go through
4995000	4997000	The entire game
4997000	4999000	And it's kind of neat because
4999000	5001000	Not only is it
5001000	5003000	The different levels you have to go through
5003000	5005000	You have 8 different ways of going through
5005000	5007000	A lot of these levels
5007000	5009000	You have to beat them in different ways
5009000	5011000	So it was very innovative
5011000	5013000	And a good way to reuse
5013000	5015000	Levels in different means
5015000	5017000	And that theme kept coming back in later
5017000	5019000	3D Mario games
5019000	5021000	Like in Sunshine and I think in Galaxy
5021000	5023000	You had different ways of beating the levels
5023000	5025000	And that was pretty cool
5025000	5027000	You could get different things like the Metal Cap
5027000	5029000	Where you turn like into
5029000	5031000	Shiney crue Mario
5031000	5044040	Like bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang
5044040	5046000	Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang
5046000	5047000	There. How's that
5047000	5048000	Yes
5048000	5050000	And you can find a pink Bob-omb Buddy
5050000	5052000	Wooo. He's pink
5052000	5061120	and there were you also had coins that you used for your life so and you know
5061120	5068100	you could also you know there was like I said the wall jump you could do a triple
5068100	5074040	jump you can flip you can do all kinds of extra stuff but it actually started
5074040	5081960	off as Super Mario FX when Miyamoto is working on Star Fox so it was originally
5081960	5089280	gonna be a Super FX game for the SNES but it couldn't quite reach what he
5089280	5094480	wanted to do so basically he I think I think he pulled an avatar on this dusted
5094480	5097560	it off out of a drawer decided oh technologists caught up let's do it and
5097560	5104520	then I love the sliding levels too you just fell down a hole though and you
5104520	5110600	you can move the camera around and it does have a fairly set path you can go
5110600	5116200	but you can just run around and do stuff and explore and even if you're like
5116200	5119360	trying to beat a certain way if like if you're doing a certain mission that has
5119360	5122320	you beat the level a certain way you can actually do it the other way you know if
5122320	5132760	you just decide to do that but it's it's really just you know pretty cool and
5132760	5137400	also the music and it was done by Koji Kondo who is one of my personal heroes
5137400	5141960	and it was one of the first ones that had Charles Martinet to do the voice
5141960	5151080	he's so cool he's so cool he was cool to meet you know so yeah it's I think in
5151080	5157760	that list of one of you know best games ever and dude punching a piranha plant
5157760	5163360	in the face you know grabbing Koop you know Bowser by the tail and swinging
5163360	5166680	them around and throwing them off a building you know Mario turned into a
5166680	5171720	thug in this game and also if you want to see something incredibly fun go on
5171720	5181000	YouTube and just watch speed runs but now the the really interesting thing
5181000	5190920	with this game for me is that Dan and I we spent because he had a Nintendo 64
5190920	5194080	we know we don't we didn't actually have nearly the collection that we do now
5194080	5198680	when we first moved in together we had maybe about 20 video game systems then
5198680	5203960	maybe 15 something like that and you know I moved out here with like my Super
5203960	5209360	Nintendo and stuff but he had a Nintendo 64 and we just played the stew out of
5209360	5216160	this game and you know we put the rumble pack and we had a lot of fun it was just
5216160	5222320	really really cool and I actually have the Nintendo DS one it's actually a
5222320	5227360	little harder to play but you know you place Yoshi Luigi and Wario and it looks
5227360	5231960	a little bit better and it's got minigames and multiplayer mode and it's
5231960	5240000	pretty good there is there was a direct sequel plan for the Nintendo 64 double D
5240000	5248800	and Miyamoto it started at 97 and it was gonna be released in 99 but because the
5248800	5256880	64 double D didn't make it my husband just decided to pop his head in the door
5256880	5259160	and said that the movie he was watching was awesome what movie were they
5259160	5265480	watching kick-ass no kick-ass good times but because 64 double D pretty much
5265480	5274840	flopped it we basically got Super Mario sunshine on the Gamecube and then we got
5274840	5278960	Super Mario Galaxy of course we're getting into the Super Mario Galaxy so
5278960	5285600	this game has a special place in my heart that and when you win the game
5285600	5294800	peach makes you a cake like she promised good for her all right well there it is
5294800	5300400	your classic game of the week Super Mario 64 now I want to give a quick
5300400	5304480	counter opinion this is not my favorite Mario game in the series I did not like
5304480	5308440	the transition to 3d very much I understand a lot of people are all
5308440	5311920	excited about it but I don't know I I had a really hard time with this game
5311920	5316840	after the awesomeness that were the Super Nintendo Mario games I don't know
5316840	5322160	the switch to 3d never felt right for me but oddly enough I was okay with Mario
5322160	5328400	Sunshine I know that makes me weird I'm all sorts of weird but whatever all
5328400	5333520	right anyhow our weirdo Rob I am weird it's fine it's fine I'm ideal with it

5373920	5378000	lost count I was talking about that earlier in the show 367th episode of our
5378000	5384280	show as we do every week at all games radio www.allgames.com live here on
5384280	5388320	Sunday nights we've talked about a lot of different news in part 8 tonight
5388320	5392200	talking about you know EA's controversial new $10 thing talking
5392200	5395440	about used games at Walmart and our gaming weeks were quite long tonight
5395440	5399440	everybody's doing something Dark Sakura went to Pinagogo and I was playing 3d
5399440	5402960	game heroes and look you still playing Grand Theft Auto that's all right good
5402960	5407280	times all right speaking of Loki he's gonna start off some quick news topics
5407280	5410160	before we get back into some longer discussion so quick quick what's on your
5410160	5415840	mind tonight Loki ah yes apparently there is another dance game coming to
5415840	5420680	the Wii and funny enough this actually has a tie back into one of the shows
5420680	5427400	that I wasn't a part of but Rob had hosted while back and it's a kids bop
5427400	5432280	dance party the video game you might ask how did that even you know the fuck did
5432280	5435520	that come up on olr I don't even remember it wasn't on olr it was on
5435520	5440840	vanilla sky because I wanted to spin off shows yeah oh oh god yes oh yeah we had
5440840	5445440	the kids bop thing yes the kids bop trivia game where if you got the trivia
5445440	5449920	question wrong the volume of this song that was my favorite games we ever did
5449920	5453680	where if you got the trivia questions wrong the kids bop music got louder yes
5453680	5456560	and it would distract you from getting future and see they should make a real
5456560	5460640	game show out of that I'm a genius I invented that game all by myself the
5460640	5465120	game will be launching September 21st will feature 24 contemporary hits as
5465120	5469920	they put it in quotes there including and if you haven't heard of kids bop
5469920	5475360	it's basically kids singing you know popular songs so imagine all your
5475360	5479600	favorite and not so favorite songs and like from a top 40 radio station just
5479600	5485040	kind of like thrown down the garbage disposal and that's like a kid's music
5485040	5491120	yes the Benny Hill theme came up inadvertently oops the Benny Hill theme
5491120	5495200	unfortunately not part of the kids bop dance party video game you know it's
5495200	5501280	funny total mistake did intend for that music to play but somehow fitting yes
5501280	5506720	such songs in this will be of course Lady Gaga's paparazzi Michael Jackson's
5506720	5512920	thriller thanks get the party started and yeah it's gonna include a free play
5512920	5518480	challenge dance-off shop and dress-up modes and it will feature two players
5518480	5524560	that can dance cooperatively or go to head-to-head lame but not really my
5524560	5529240	target demographic but then again just dance sold million copies so what do I
5529240	5535960	know about games I guess apparently nothing if you are a collector of such
5535960	5541600	odd game peripherals as I don't know the chainsaw controller for Resident Evil
5541600	5547680	or I guess in this case Dragon Quest it's gonna be getting its own Dragon
5547680	5556280	Quest monsters battle road victory it's a Wii game that was a port of an arcade
5556280	5560680	game that's based on collectible cards but the actual controller like the
5560680	5565560	arcade has two giant buttons and a giant sword that looks like it's basically the
5565560	5569480	sword in the stone that you have to interact with as well the controller
5569480	5578040	will cost the 12,800 yen of the equivalent of $137 US and will be out in
5578040	5584560	Japan this summer so if you're a big collector of odd peripherals this will
5584560	5589280	be coming to you from Hori and then finally of course we've been hearing
5589280	5595600	about a lot of cameos of characters in lost planet 2 including you know Dom
5595600	5601400	from Gears of War well now of course you know Sony's got to have their characters
5601400	5606240	in there as well not really making it in for the launch but there will be some
5606240	5610880	free download content coming out soon that will include the Helghast
5610880	5615200	characters from the Killzone series that you'll be able to play as in lost
5615200	5619360	planet 2 and they have a few different versions of those that you get to play
5619360	5625360	as so those will be available for free on the PlayStation Network in June can I
5625360	5628840	pitch a dream game to you guys real quick and all our dream game possible I
5628840	5632800	just want to pitch it to you guys and see what you guys think okay the crew
5632800	5635960	from Kidz Bop meets Gwar
5635960	5643480	that'd be weird and I don't know like maybe could be like a point-and-click
5643480	5647320	type of game like in the vein of you know Sam & Max and those types of games
5647320	5652360	where like the you play as the the folks from Gwar and you're trying to find the
5652360	5656720	people from Kidz Bop and like corrupt them and or murder them I will one-up
5656720	5661960	that okay okay I'll one up that please we need to launch a new CD series called
5661960	5666400	Gwar Bop they basically take score and have saying all these different
5666400	5674120	temporary hits as they put it hey hey I I'd play that I would do good stuff
5674120	5677560	alright and then we'll make it come full circle and put it out of the game alright
5677560	5683440	so possibly coming to a PC near you alright moving on let's talk about some
5683440	5688120	other quick news halo 2 yes there were still some holdouts playing halo 2
5688120	5691560	online you might remember there were guys that were refusing to pull their
5691560	5696800	neck connection and what's kind of weird is that Microsoft you would think would
5696800	5700320	have just like like put the ban hammer down on them a long time ago but they
5700320	5704200	kind of thought it was funny and they they let it go like as long as they
5704200	5707680	could hold out their connections and so forth and the last man standing was
5707680	5715240	Apache and for sir was the gamertag and he was finally removed he says he was
5715240	5718480	kicked off but you know kicked off could mean that his Comcast connection sucks
5718480	5721520	balls because that's what's been happening to me on World of Warcraft
5721520	5724720	these past couple weeks tech came to my house and everything said he couldn't
5724720	5728320	find anything wrong like yeah I guess I'm just fucking crazy yeah that's just
5728320	5733880	our crappy service it's a feature so anyhow whatever I so he finally got
5733880	5737840	booted whether it was by Microsoft or his cable provider who knows but it was
5737840	5743520	at 11 o'clock or just before 11 o'clock pacific time may 10th 2010 he was out of
5743520	5748400	halo 2 which means that's it for the original Xbox Live that was the official
5748400	5753360	last connection on Xbox Live rest in pieces who that could be like the tag
5753360	5759960	line for war versus kid Bob surezo in chat suggests I kids bought versus
5759960	5765440	Capcom I remember that from a couple weeks ago yes you can now play Gameboy
5765440	5772040	games on your nest yes your actual NES that's right not not talking about the
5772040	5775560	Super Gameboy that was for the Super Nintendo no it's a device that was
5775560	5780480	created by this guy on the Nintendo age forums who calls himself bunny boy it's
5780480	5784840	called retro vision and you plug the car into the Nintendo put your Gameboy game
5784840	5789240	in there and you're good to go this is even more awesome it has the
5789240	5793480	expansion port on it too so you can use your Gameboy printer remember the
5793480	5799040	Gameboy printer what a worthless piece of shit that thing was huh huh didn't
5799040	5805000	they have like a hidden DJ game in that though the the printer software the what
5805000	5808920	software the printer software that came with the actual printer does it I don't
5808920	5815080	remember yeah there's a little like game in there or I don't know one I didn't
5815080	5818760	pay for one all right I just remember seeing the features and I thought gee
5818760	5824640	that was stupid can I put my own receipts on it oh that might be good I
5824640	5829600	don't know I game room updates there's now we have to start covering these two
5829600	5832720	we got rock band releases virtual console releases now we have game room
5832720	5837520	releases as well this week you missed battle zone Canyon bomber Keystone
5837520	5841400	capers for the 2600 Canyon bomber is also the 2600 version not the arcade
5841400	5846240	version mega zone for the arcade night driver for the Atari 2600 oink for the
5846240	5850320	2600 and soccer for the Intellivision interesting thing about game room the
5850320	5854360	game packs that you're downloading are actually two weeks worth of games it's
5854360	5858840	just that half of them stay locked for a week so if you downloaded you know
5858840	5862320	something that was in last week's pack like pitfall you already had this week's
5862320	5865560	pack waiting to go interesting huh although you would have should have been
5865560	5870200	able to guess that because games pack one and two are like 15 games apiece so
5870200	5873480	game pack three rolls around and it's you know another 50 megabytes it's
5873480	5877280	actually 15 more games go figure well some of the games have been announced
5877280	5880640	for the next pack that is coming out and that is going to be coming out on May
5880640	5884560	19th because it looks like what is that Wednesday is gonna be game room day yeah

5892680	5897800	coming out this week as well Grand Prix from Activision shark shark space duel
5897800	5901680	it was an arcade game it was kind of like a souped-up asteroids I guess you
5901680	5906000	could say probably I think the biggest release this week stampede is coming out
5906000	5910040	this week on the 2600 oh I have fond memories of stampede we went to the
5910040	5914640	classic gaming Expo I participated in like the official stampede scoreboard
5914640	5918360	that twin galaxies was doing I think I got like next to last place I'm that
5918360	5924120	good at stampede time pilot is also coming out May 19th but time pilots
5924120	5927660	already available on Xbox Live just so you know for five bucks and you get the
5927660	5931680	souped-up version so if you want to buy time pilot for game room that's on you
5931680	5936360	but you'll get the opportunity this week to buy it all over again if you want
5936360	5941040	it's all about money that's right Monday Monday Monday and speaking of all about
5941040	5950560	money how about our rock band releases for the week as yay what is wrong with
5950560	5954900	my computer well where do I begin I'm just kidding
5954900	5959240	seriously it frees up or something no it's opening 50,000 windows when I'm
5959240	5968880	trying to yikes spam spam spam no lose weight increase your penis yes it's no
5968880	5972040	because it's completely screwing up now so all right that's fine I'll go to some
5972040	5975800	chat room comments chat that orange on trade calm salacious pop says demons and
5975800	5980280	diamonds was a paddle game though with it was a big twisty knob paddle and
5980280	5984720	trackball for game room please I somewhat agree although I don't think at
5984720	5988080	the end of the day I would be able to justify buying a trackball for my Xbox
5988080	5991600	because I know it costs like 30 to 40 bucks and what am I gonna play with it
5991600	5998320	Crystal Castles whoo I don't know although you know in theory they do they
5998320	6001360	do need to have better support for that so it's a prey hack that together playing
6001360	6006920	Crystal Castles on the joystick or the little Xbox 360 controller just just it
6006920	6012840	stinks it stinks all right so we have I've got everything pulled up now I had
6012840	6018440	to basically reload it all our rock band download content actually is pretty cool
6018440	6022120	we've got a Grateful Dead pack which includes beat it on down the line
6022120	6027240	Cumberland blues scarlet begonias throwing stones touch of gray and US
6027240	6030800	blues and then two songs by the smithereens and I like the smithereens
6030800	6034840	is one of my groups I really liked when I was in high school is a girl like you
6034840	6042120	and only a memory those are both really good songs for some project new town
6042120	6048280	news their big event is going to have a Cirque du Soleil performance you Cirque
6048280	6056880	du Soleil but it'll be on June 13th so look forward to feats of flexibility or
6056880	6065440	as my friend calls it Cirque du Soguet I know right and then Bayonetta the
6065440	6071000	director Kamiya Hideki he basically doesn't like that there's a Bayonetta
6071000	6080160	doujinshi like hentai doujinshi about Bayonetta getting getting it on well I
6080160	6085520	mean she's kind of sexy that means you've got a popular product hi the more
6085520	6091100	you know I I have personally Sega should be fucking excited that they have like a
6091100	6097400	new franchise here you know what I mean well I mean trust me you go to cons and
6097400	6102720	see how much Final Fantasy 7 doujin there were you know I've got a ton
6102720	6107880	myself of other series that I won't need I actually have some Final Fantasy 7
6107880	6115800	doujinshi doesn't everyone this interesting um but um and I have a few
6115800	6120960	roni kenshin ones too but anyway um he's basically quoted saying it seems
6120960	6124320	there's pornographic doujinshi based off Bayonetta there are fans who will resent
6124320	6128000	that and I hardly think those responsible hold any love for the game
6128000	6135640	dude get get your head out your butt dude um there was though Chris is it
6135640	6139840	dalen or dalen there's a quote from him and I actually like this and this is
6139840	6144680	actually a point that I've had with you know some of these games that guys can
6144680	6149520	go and get outfits for their female characters and you know I always laughed
6149520	6153400	that WrestleMania was like dress-up for for boys you know because they could
6153400	6157600	customize their wrestler and you know but um the quote saying guys tell
6157600	6160080	themselves they shouldn't listen to fashion they're terrified if they spend
6160080	6163040	enough time playing as Bayonetta being Bayonetta and witnessing the power of
6163040	6167560	her high heels and endless tresses well at some point they'll stop objectifying
6167560	6171760	her they want to be her she won't invite our gaze as much as grip it until she
6171760	6177640	sucked us into a vortex of overpowering femininity I like that a vortex of
6177640	6185960	overpowering femininity that should be on the box can we get an iTunes review
6185960	6189160	for our show that says that
6189480	6195520	boo power a vortex of overpowering feminine is that what they're calling
6195520	6202320	her bits now it's a vortex all right some other gaming news and of course

6205800	6212120	bit but some other new stories first starting off with Loki yes you know it's
6212120	6217040	like every week we hear about another game franchise being turned into a movie

6353960	6358280	headset was wrapped around his chairs arm so when he got up quickly BAM the
6358280	6362160	wire got caught and the head smashed right into my Mac which was sitting on a
6362160	6369080	stereo a few feet off the ground ow so he got up quickly and BAM hit his head

6597880	6604280	one Tiger Claw 305 sends us another Twitter topic it's a link from MTV
6604280	6614360	multiplayer blog apparently cliffy B has said that mass effect let me read this
6614360	6618200	quote quote the thing that was cool is that mass effect is kind of an RPG for
6618200	6621040	me with the cover-based shooting I think there's a reason why it's been
6621040	6626120	successful because gamers love gears God get your just take your ego and shove
6626120	6632320	it up your ass here's something like that I would like to thank myself for
6632320	6636680	making Mass Effect 2 such a great game because if I put my game out no one
6636680	6640360	would know first-person shooters are in the window epic first-person shooters

6708440	6713960	game of the week oh well you're quite welcome woot there you go those are the
6713960	6717160	Twitter topics I'm sorry for ignoring you for one whole story you know I just
6717160	6720760	remembered and this is totally random I don't even know why I just remember this
6720760	6723620	but I saw earlier this weekend like huh that's not my should mention on the show
6723620	6726280	because we talked about it before and we kind of were hoping they would come to
6726280	6730640	other platforms remember that game that I kind of hated because it was basically
6730640	6735800	a ripoff of House of the Dead Rock of the Dead it was a game that you know it's
6735800	6740960	like typing of the dead but you use your guitar controller to I remember that
6740960	6744200	it's coming up this fall but it's actually not just coming out in the Wii
6744200	6747960	this time it's actually gonna be coming on 360 and PlayStation 3 as well as the
6747960	6752120	Wii well done is it please tell me it's a budget title please please uh I don't
6752120	6756200	remember I don't remember that part but still called Rock of the Dead so called
6756200	6761200	Rock of the Dead awesome look and I realize you guys are saying like you
6761200	6764160	know I and I seem to remember when Rock of the Dead first came up on this show a
6764160	6767200	lot of people were saying lawsuit it's gonna be a lawsuit but like seriously
6767200	6771680	after playing 3d game heroes it's a parody that's all they have to say it's
6771680	6777240	a parody and we're like Loki when you play 3d game heroes and dark Sakura if
6777240	6780720	you do at some point you know you really should check it out because it'll tickle
6780720	6785640	your retro funny bone tell me it's not just a complete effing ripoff oh I can
6785640	6789920	tell that without playing it but that's okay I'm fine that Zelda's a good game
6789920	6796880	it needs to be ripped off more often hey there was already new topia all right
6796880	6802040	huge news this week everybody's been talking about this and you know we got
6802040	6806600	to say something about this to steam for the Mac came out this week it included
6806600	6811360	57 games at launch including torchlight that's actually game I played a little
6811360	6815520	bit of this week I like me some torchlight was out there for 10 bucks on
6815520	6822680	steam for the Mac but the best deal of all free free game portal free zero
6822680	6829080	dollars free nothing may tell May 24th and they didn't want the Mac users to
6829080	6831640	have all the fun there because if they only gave it away for free on the Mac
6831640	6839200	you'd have people like Loki that would be like that's my Loki impression that
6839200	6841960	they didn't give it out for free on the PC although I'll bet Loki didn't
6841960	6846600	download it nope but you really should it is really a great game but I you know
6846600	6852560	we all know what the trick is here it's a it's an asshole game at this point
6852560	6856360	it's a great game and you should do it if you've never played it you need to
6856360	6861360	play it but the trick is it's kind of the Trojan horse to get steam on your
6861360	6865840	computer because once steam is on your computer then you're gonna see these
6865840	6872320	sales civilization three complete edition one dollar and 25 cents buy it
6872320	6876200	that's what's been getting me well I said when when loom went down to four
6876200	6881840	bucks you know I was on that yeah and you and dark soccer look dark soccer she
6881840	6886680	even bought the pink anus game I did by the penis game and you know what it's
6886680	6891760	crap but she bought it and that's all they care about at the end of the day
6891760	6898240	yeah it's it's read ratings please people SSJ 100 Matt says can't get any
6898240	6903040	cheaper than free unless you're Yaris mmm true SAG in our term says they needed
6903040	6906960	to demonstrate the steam play concept so it's free on both platforms absolutely
6906960	6913040	it's kind of the Trojan horse but you know it it it's a win-win situation you
6913040	6916760	win because you get a free game and you don't get like I in and to reference the
6916760	6922400	other chat comment you don't get some crappy free game you get a great game of
6922400	6927600	the year caliber game for free but the trade-off is they win because they just
6927600	6930280	installed your thing on your computer so you're not tempted to go get you know
6930280	6934920	direct-to-drive or the windows gaming platform which granted I know is not on
6934920	6938280	the Mac but you know you know what I mean same thing they get that on your
6938280	6942080	computer and then you're seeing all the sales and you're like oh shit I can get
6942080	6947800	torchlight for $10 maybe I should get that so there you go all of that's
6947800	6950080	available on the Mac some of the other games you might want to check out that
6950080	6956280	are available on the Mac right now braid let's see is a big one some of the
6956280	6961600	Indiana Jones games loom you can play on the Mac now yes salmon max devil's
6961600	6967360	playhouse tales monkey island season 1 torchlight which I definitely recommend
6967360	6971400	if you liked if you even just like thought Diablo 2 was kind of cool you
6971400	6976920	should get torchlight it's pretty much the same fucking game and have a better
6976920	6981360	set for which of course you know I have a big boner for all things civilization
6981360	6986680	so I'm excited that the Mac fans can play that on steam well I think that was
6986680	6990640	I think sit for was already available on the Mac I could be wrong all right more
6990640	6997800	news mailbag coming up in a little bit to dark Sakura yes more stuff um this is
6997800	7008280	about the rating system in Australia there is and actually so fairly I would
7008280	7014800	have to say a big percentage approves that there should be 98% actually said
7014800	7019640	that there should be an r18 plus rating so we're thinking where things are
7019640	7026160	restricted to 18 and over it's been proposed before but now it's like that
7026160	7036160	that's what the people want so who knows but that's there's actually though some
7036160	7042000	from other special interest groups though that were saying that only 53%
7042000	7053160	actually approve of it but numbers lie statistics can be budged it's funny you
7053160	7056520	talk about statistics because some of the interesting chat comments I'm
7056520	7059520	reading right now about the whole steam thing you know they're a little delayed
7059520	7064320	so we get comments from the last story say is saying now we'll have stats for
7064320	7069440	how many Mac users will buy games or to clarify publicly accessible stats for
7069440	7075360	Mac users who will buy games interesting some other comments Robert M says I've
7075360	7078840	been anticipating torchlight for quite some time but didn't want to invest in
7078840	7083600	Windows 7 and partitioning for boot camp donovan says he'll wait for Diablo 3
7083600	7088800	yourself but I think torchlights pretty good deal with the one thing torchlight
7088800	7093280	is missing is multiplayer but seriously it's like 10 bucks that's that's great
7093280	7099040	it's a great deal for a single-player game really is anyhow alright so moving
7099040	7106160	on with some more news stories looking yes so it's interesting because you
7106160	7109880	know there's already been screenshots people are not really screenshots but
7109880	7115120	people taking pictures of you know Red Dead Redemption because it's been coming
7115120	7118920	in early to a few different stores and one of the screenshots or I should say
7118920	7123600	box shots that they got of the game on PlayStation 3 shows that there's some
7123600	7128840	exclusive content included for the PlayStation 3 version now I mean not
7128840	7132400	trying to sound biased or anything it doesn't sound all that wonderful but
7132400	7136960	here's what you get you get Solomon's Solomon's folly gang hideout which is
7136960	7142160	basically kind of a safe house in the game and then you also get the Walton
7142160	7149920	gang outfit the Walton gang is the kind of villain in the game and John boy yes
7149920	7154880	this is exclusive for the PlayStation 3 not quite as wonderful as you know
7154880	7158960	exclusive download content like that was on Grand Theft Auto episodes from Liberty
7158960	7163360	City but you know maybe this stuff will come out later on as you know something
7163360	7167440	paid for on the Xbox 360 I know there is some more free download content coming
7167440	7172880	out later on so who knows but hey anything extra is kind of good so you
7172880	7175780	know if you're getting on the ps3 there's a little bonus for you who know
7175780	7179760	that it might be enough to sway some people even if it's like a little you
7179760	7183920	never know people that have both I know it's not that big a deal there's like
7183920	7189040	other there's tons of outfits you can get in the game and lots of different
7189040	7191960	things you can find safe houses and stuff I don't really know if this stuff
7191960	7198080	is really gonna do it for you but whatever if that's me if you really want
7198080	7202840	to get into both systems you're not sure which one maybe that's way all right
7202840	7206080	some other news coming out this week how many of y'all have seen the movie cube
7206080	7212960	there's a little in my love cube too but not the original cube no I like the
7212960	7218800	first one but the second one I okay I'm just to go say a little bit about it
7218800	7223080	it's it's an indie film and describe what cube is about but you gotta start
7223080	7228040	with the first one with the first one these people basically wake up in
7228040	7233080	different rooms that are all there's a hatch above a hatch below and a hatch on
7233080	7238800	each wall and it starts off with a pretty gory death because some of the
7238800	7244360	rooms are trapped and so as it goes they they each run into each other as they go
7244360	7249120	through the cube and find out that each of them has a specific skill some people
7249120	7252200	have been left with their glasses some people have been left with you know
7252200	7257000	something in their pocket there's a crazy lady and her skill is being crazy
7257000	7263880	no she was a doctor right yeah the doctor but um but it's it's that you
7263880	7269280	know these people are stuck in in the cube and their whole point is trying to
7269280	7273320	figure out the way out and basically while they're moving from room to room
7273320	7278000	they all know they had they didn't have what the cube 2 was one with crazy lady
7278000	7284720	the first one had the autistic boy yes they they basically find out that the
7284720	7290600	rooms are moving mm-hmm and then G spoiler that's why it's all I just like
7290600	7295080	it's like over 10 years old this point and that and that basically the autistic
7295080	7298880	boy is some sort of savant with numbers and figures out that it's like prime
7298880	7302920	numbers go into the right room and they figure out which way the rooms are going
7302920	7307640	to be that lead to the exit right where the exit is so it's all and now cube 2 I
7307640	7311960	love it because it's called hyper cube meaning a tesseract wait it's not
7311960	7319800	electric boogaloo no I mean I like that one because I love theoretical physics I
7319800	7323400	I don't have the brain for the math or anything I just love reading about it
7323400	7326680	wait so the cube was like traveling through time and space as well exactly
7326680	7331880	Wow the fourth dimension being time Wow so and it had like this really weird
7331880	7339760	ending and also the cube 2 inspired a whole mod for a half-life when they're
7339760	7342840	a cube zero at some point you were a cute cute the third one was cube zero
7342840	7347100	which is like a prequel and it was crap okay well how would you like to play a
7347100	7351720	video game based off cube she's raising her hand it might actually happen
7351720	7357780	believe it or not it's an interview that Vin Vincenzo is his name Vincenzo Natali
7357780	7361560	he was the director of the game and he was talking to MTV about the game the
7361560	7365920	film splice which is an upcoming movie that he did they for whatever reason
7365920	7369660	asked him about cube if he ever wanted to revisit the universe he said I would
7369660	7374100	very much like to do a cube game I'd love to do a game when I was writing it
7374100	7377560	with my writing partner we were saying to each other are we writing a film are
7377560	7380920	we writing a game it's always been amazing to me that no one has attempted
7380920	7384420	to turn it into a game I would very much like to do that that's how I would like
7384420	7386600	to get back into the cube world I guess that's true because there was the mod
7386600	7391500	right there's the mod based on hypercube he probably hasn't seen it and someone
7391500	7396000	actually recreated the end of the movie in using Gary's mod it does have a real
7396000	7400740	creepster ending to it actually the whole movie is kind of a downer and then
7400740	7404940	like like it really leaves you with more questions than you start the movie with
7404940	7409100	but it wasn't a bad movie it was just kind of like the fuck look that was my
7409100	7412700	reaction at the end was like the well it is what and it's it's a movie that I
7412700	7416660	think everyone needs to see at least once you know the movie that leaves you
7416660	7423220	talking and for a low-budget movie it was intelligently done I think it's
7423220	7429300	definitely one that's a thinker too so would it be a low-budget game well given
7429300	7433140	that you probably only need to make you know one environment over and over and
7433140	7436860	true well you know when they did when they did how they made the movie cheap
7436860	7440820	when they seriously is the same room and they turned them around and when they
7440820	7445420	did cube to they it was also relatively expensive they just had those white
7445420	7451780	walls of different lights behind them he's easy yeah it you don't nobody has
7451780	7456900	to bother by the way with the third movie it's SSJ 100 Matt is suggesting
7456900	7460020	Jamie if you like theoretical physics I would tell you to check out the movie
7460020	7464020	what the bleep do we know I've heard of that movie I don't want me to see it
7464020	7467220	actually you might have to like Netflix that or something all right in the
7467220	7470780	meantime though Jamie has no time to Netflix because she has to dive into the
7470780	7476220	mailbag and read your emails mailbag orange lounge radio.com every week you
7476220	7480140	guys send us emails to our mailbag and dark soccer will jump in read if you
7480140	7483500	possibly criticize their grammar and then we'll answer your questions here on
7483500	7487500	the show again that's mailbag at orange lounge radio.com although more and more
7487500	7489980	people have been submitting them through the website recently I guess there's a
7489980	7493940	forum you can fill out deep man does deep man makes the magic happen on the
7493940	7497500	website and he made it magical where people send us bleeps through the
7497500	7501140	website now only in dragon boy is actually dragon boy 69 is actually
7501140	7505420	sending us a tech support question and I have to read this because I think I
7505420	7509820	don't know if look you'll laugh I'm not sure if you can assist me with my issue
7509820	7514780	I have an iMac and just attempted to sign up to your site however when trying
7514780	7517820	to log in it goes to white screen with the words invalid token is this because
7517820	7522340	I'm on an iMac thank you in advance for any help you can provide me this matter
7522340	7526420	um no I don't think it's because you're on an iMac just well we'll help you
7526420	7530100	later I've seen the website do that before and I think it's because a lot of
7530100	7533060	people hit it at once sometimes like believe it or not we're kind of popular
7533060	7539580	use Firefox not Safari also just reload or use your back button and try to log
7539580	7543420	in again usually it will kind of work itself out if it keeps doing it to you
7543420	7547660	come back after like an hour we honestly don't know what causes it unfortunately
7547660	7551420	our website is a popular target for spammers and when they clog up the pipes
7551420	7554980	with their poop then it kind of prevents the rest of us from logging in but it
7554980	7558880	has nothing to do with the fact that you're on an iMac as far as we know the
7558880	7563380	websites worked on a Mac for me before it wasn't an iMac granted all right
7563380	7567740	hello olr I look forward to your show every week I do have a couple of
7567740	7573260	questions for olr what Sega model 1 or 2 or model 3 arcade games urgently needs
7573260	7578220	an Xbox Live conversion I'm really looking forward to Daytona USA or scud
7578220	7583500	race is it cut is it called super GT in the US I think so also I think super
7583500	7587300	hang-on needs a good update like Sega did to outrun I would agree with that
7587300	7591940	are you guys okay yeah that's the first one what do you think would make a good
7591940	7596980	release if they had some sort of gun control or any of the gun games would be
7596980	7603300	good like gun blade or even you know house of the dead or some that kind of
7603300	7612500	stuff planet Harrier that's Hikari that I don't care planet Harrier um can we
7612500	7617740	get doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo no I'm kidding actually that wouldn't be
7617740	7621580	bad I mean you could even have steering wheel support maybe it wouldn't have
7621580	7626580	drawing that would be cool are you guys planning on a new show for foreign
7626580	7631180	listeners after the mishaps of your previous effort that's right wasn't the
7631180	7635420	the euro show when the last computer just finally died it exploded yeah that's
7635420	7640340	right let's pick a date we will have to do that but it's gonna have to be like
7640340	7646420	in June at least yeah it's gonna be something it'll have to be at least June
7646420	7649780	because next week I'm gonna literally be running in here at the last second
7649780	7654860	because I'm going on a trip but and the weekend after by the way we won't be
7654860	7658860	here Memorial Day weekend we will not be here at least I won't be here and I
7658860	7665620	think that that's gonna be getting some shush I'm going to Oregon on it on a
7665620	7669700	getaway so we're doing that and so I'm not gonna be here and I imagine a lot of
7669700	7672220	listeners are probably gonna be doing their vacations and stuff too so we'll
7672220	7677420	we'll not be here Memorial Day weekend but sometime either a June maybe July
7677420	7681020	maybe like 4th of July weekend or something cuz I'll be a long weekend too
7681020	7684820	we can do something we could do something or we should plan it around
7684820	7689260	a major holiday you know what we should do is the 4th of July weekend just start
7689260	7692660	at 8 in the morning and then finish late at night although Bobby will probably
7692660	7698020	want to do a show somewhere in there I figure something out we also need to do
7698020	7702400	another like roadshow good times roadshow and last question to dark
7702400	7705820	Sakura why are there no more robbed floods I really miss them okay you I
7705820	7717820	don't know rubber rubber rubber rubber rubber rubber rubber rubber rubber
7717820	7721860	making a show nearly every week it's a real relief to listen to olr your
7721860	7724800	light-hearted view on things is very welcome in a world that's way too
7724800	7728500	serious thank you very much for a breeze from Belgium PS was my spelling and
7728500	7734380	grammar okay you didn't put a question mark at the end of okay other than that
7734380	7738460	spot on but he's from Belgium so he gets a little they have question marks in
7738460	7746860	Belgium alright funny I question a question from our chat room wetu in our
7746860	7751180	chat room asks what is Memorial Day for I don't know if maybe he's Canadian or
7751180	7753740	from a foreign country or maybe one of the Americans that doesn't know the
7753740	7758620	difference here it is quickly in the u.s. there's two holidays around the Armed
7758620	7763140	Services one is Memorial Day one is Veterans Day Memorial Day is a day to
7763140	7767620	honor those that have been lost serving the country in the Armed Forces and you
7767620	7772500	know most notably wars like Vietnam World War two etc memorial is for those
7772500	7776580	that have passed away veterans is to honor oh and what who wants to clarify
7776580	7782900	from New Zealand Veterans Day is the day that is that's in November and that's
7782900	7787580	the day to honor those that are still serving or you know alive and used to
7787580	7790820	serve you know a veteran so one for those that have passed away one for
7790820	7794980	those that are still alive basically in other words Memorial Day would be like
7794980	7800540	for my papa mm-hmm and my grandfather and Veterans Day would be like for my
7800540	7808420	brother but both days great sales at Macy's tell me I'm wrong tell me I'm
7808420	7816380	wrong I just read back a message from Becky said I made her snort by saying
7816380	7820740	there's question marks in Belgium there are indeed question marks in Belgium
7820740	7827060	you're right okay um this one comes I'm just gonna say from Laco and cuz they
7827060	7830020	didn't put any other name it's been well since I've had a chance to email you
7830020	7835220	guys last time Loki had turned me under earth defense force on 360 what Oh still
7835220	7838220	playing by the way my question is in regards to the zombie talk from last
7838220	7843100	week you guys talked about what music would kill zombies to but where would
7843100	7847260	you set up HQ my roommate and I have argued between a super Walmart a mall
7847260	7852580	and a Costco PS sorry if the grammar is bad had a 14-hour work day and typing in
7852580	7858260	the dark so that I do not wake the wife good husband and and by the way I only
7858260	7863860	give people a hard time they're really really really crappy where would I set
7863860	7869500	up shop sorry I was flooding the chat room because they needed a they needed
7869500	7874820	a spanking what was the question here it's we talked about what music we would
7874820	7879020	kill zombies to but where would we set up HQ my roommate and I wouldn't argued
7879020	7886380	as super Walmart a mall or Costco well dead rising was set in a mall and I
7886380	7890500	guess that did pretty well for Frank West say an amusement park like
7890500	7896180	zombieland that would be fun or a museum might be fun too and especially scary
7896180	7902060	and who'd look for me in a museum it's the zoo Fort Knox
7902060	7912580	oh good good guess area 51 or the equivalent of wherever it is video 54 so
7912580	7918180	you can get your club on and kill zombies my mom's house the space shuttle
7918180	7925820	try to get me up here zombies Rob Rob why are there zombies outside Rob Rob
7925820	7930580	get rid of the zombies do you know this neighborhood has already gone to hell
7930580	7935700	why are there zombies out front Rob she would annoy them away it would be great
7935700	7941140	here zombies would never make it in the south especially out in the rural south
7941140	7946020	just because of how many people have freaking guns probably be some good
7946020	7952380	eating the New Orleans anyway Oh Rob uh no not Rob above Rob above us send us an
7952380	7955840	email yeah okay here we go I listen to your conversation about the black we
7955840	7959820	bundle leak in quotes the correspondence between an 10 on GameStop sounded
7959820	7964580	totally fake ie viral marketing Nintendo bad dog that leak totally advertised our
7964580	7969260	new bundle a very convenient week before release GameStop we fired the guy I
7969260	7973660	will never do it again unless you ask us to again and did okay but just this once
7973660	7979500	well played also Nintendo knows after all these years how to prevent this type
7979500	7984620	of leak sending the promo standees every week ahead of time sounded intentional
7984620	7990940	Rob above yep probably was and the more and more I hear about it the more and
7990940	7994500	more I think it was just kind of like one of those like leaks to actually get
7994500	7997740	people talking about the black we can I read some chat comments because these
7997740	8002060	are pretty funny do it all right Donovan suggested these are all about the
8002060	8006340	zombies and where would you set up shop one of my buddies from Alabama by the
8006340	8010580	way hi Donovan my old school buddy I keep thinking it's Travis Donovan
8010580	8014900	Donovan from under station live but he wouldn't listen to his one of my mate
8014900	8018060	one of my major geek buddies and one of the people responsible for making me a
8018060	8022500	bigger nerd then I literally he's a geek if he's listening to this show well a
8022500	8026700	hearty hello heart as California as California kids have done a good job of
8026700	8032460	corrupting Jamie just you know also some comments about my mother's house zeba
8032460	8036220	says they're gross Rob and Tigerclaw follows that up with yes guy and if your
8036220	8041700	mom sees you shoot a zombie she'd be like Rob that's gross rock you go outside

8065220	8069260	anti-zombie tool you look like shit you can't get in sorry come back with some
8069260	8072940	hot girls and try again well they wouldn't even let the hot people in
8072940	8076260	they're just like you random random random the zombies would have to be
8076260	8080340	carrying cocaine to get in basically yeah zombies don't need cocaine they're
8080340	8084540	already act like crackheads yeah you know what just popped in my head though
8084540	8093940	with the word crackhead and zombie mmm zombie Whitney Houston okay so the next
8093940	8098140	email we actually got a decent number of emails by the way yeah you're all our I
8098140	8101820	know I probably don't think your average demographic being a 31 year old male
8101820	8105380	carpenter but I have to tell you something I love Wednesdays and
8105380	8108860	Thursdays you know why because that's usually the time you release your

8161820	8166940	have Rob you shouldn't say that rock she's like secretly laughing she was
8166940	8171900	thinking that my mom would probably try to stifle the giggles you know like you
8171900	8174960	do when you're at church exactly actually that was me at church
8174960	8180660	tackling my giggles I'm sitting in your own pew no usually I was sneaking out

8228840	8233020	translated from Greek wasn't it written in Hebrew and then going out in the

8312060	8315260	Orthodox rabbi but look two things you shouldn't talk about on a video game

8334380	8339940	distraction from corporate tedium every week not to mention no and the mention
8339940	8343960	of Mother's Day made it all the sweeter I'm one of those they grew up on video
8343960	8346740	games still place today and believes that parents should be gaming with their

8365860	8370340	play it okay because she sends another email that says of course right after I
8370340	8374140	sent the last message I heard the question about a good song for zombie
8374140	8382740	killing so I am going to copy this link location and by the way while Dark
8382740	8385920	Sakura sending that over to me a salacious pop is clarifying that was the
8385920	8390500	plot to Yentl that he was trying to get you a Barbra Streisand I know I haven't
8390500	8395660	seen Yentl which I know I'm supposed to see either have I bad gay you know what
8395660	8399900	we know we're not having a Barbra Streisand night vetoed no I'm talking
8399900	8403020	about watching if we're gonna watch like things that involve cross-dressing Rob
8403020	8407020	let's watch Yentl and Victor Victoria no let's watch Priscilla Queen of the
8407020	8412860	desert I need to see Yentl you really don't all right here's the video that
8412860	8418140	your email or sent who it contains content of an adult nature hooray oh I
8418140	8420460	can't believe
8420460	8430540	oh is the zombie killing music she's actually sent the songs let me see me
8430540	8432940	get the link
8432940	8458700	this is funny cuz he's running over people with a lock or great radio I'm
8458700	8470100	watching a video and laughing at it oh this is the actual song the world's
8470100	8481700	combined harvester should be like the new email do we have more emails oh good
8481700	8485220	read the email to this song I'm gonna have to find that song now we need to
8485220	8492460	use that for we need to do that for our ridiculous news okay ever since I
8492460	8495020	started listening to internet radio almost ten years ago I have always
8495020	8499420	dreamed about listening to shoutcast net stations in my car when I found first
8499420	8503340	came out I was excited to learn that it can play streaming radio however I
8503340	8506820	didn't have the money to get one a couple months ago I finally decided that
8506820	8512220	I wanted to purchase one with some of my tax return money after I heard about the
8512220	8515860	supposed 4g version of the iPhone being found at a bar I was hesitant to buy
8515860	8519780	knowing that this version may be released very soon since I haven't heard
8519780	8523860	anything new about it in a while I don't know what I should do do you think this
8523860	8527140	leak is delaying the 4g version to come out or do you think was just a marketing
8527140	8530940	employed by Apple we're going to hear more about it very soon I just don't
8530940	8534460	want to buy the 3gs and then a couple months later see a 4g version release
8534460	8540780	and screw me over your fellow gamer girl Ziba well I bought a 3g a couple months
8540780	8546980	ago rumor is Job's was pissed and like called gizmodo himself that's one of the
8546980	8550340	latest rumors that was on the blogs this week but whatever believe it or not I
8550340	8556140	don't care the fact is fact Apple will release information about a new phone in
8556140	8561300	June so my suggestion if you think you can hold off until June the end of June
8561300	8564700	which is only about a month away at this point if you can hold off like one month
8564700	8568900	you're in good shape you'll be fine and then you'll you'll have a better idea
8568900	8574860	what to expect the only other suggestion I really have is that keep in mind that
8574860	8579060	iPhones not your only option you know they do have like two wraps I think for
8579060	8586020	blackberries and the droid I mean the other phones have them too I don't know
8586020	8589240	I wasn't feeling the song for mailbag music we're gonna have to we'll find a
8589240	8592780	purpose for it on the show though it's a good song okay and that's it we're gonna
8592780	8596980	find a use for that somewhere yeah by the way you know I was so distracted
8596980	8600900	earlier in part a hmm it's because I was reading a friend's live journal and she
8600900	8608580	had pictures up of what's it root root beat the the new Bimani game Oh you beat
8608580	8615420	you beat yeah and it looked very cubicle it looks oh oh yeah our friend Japan is
8615420	8619860	that that was um yeah you beat is kind of one of those games I'd like to play
8619860	8622940	at some point where they testing it in the US and then they just kind of stopped
8622940	8630980	I guess I don't know well she listed as do beat or maybe it's you as in like the
8630980	8638540	the Spanish J I don't know um I I would say that there might be a chance at e3
8638540	8642660	sometimes if Konami's got a lot of Bimani games they want to show they'll
8642660	8646980	roll out a lot of machines at e3 supernova they did they brought they
8646980	8654100	brought a beat me to DX machine in 2006 I think it was six sometimes they'll
8654100	8659100	bring them to e3 for awareness I don't know why it started show but the Japanese
8659100	8665500	games it was distorted yeah they brought to e3 one year and that was the new game
8665500	8671660	that was on Japan yeah so we'll see but you beat I don't think is and it's not
8671660	8680620	juby because I know but a lot of people because it's juby go juby I've seen
8680620	8684380	people spell it both ways and besides that I would I wouldn't have known if I
8684380	8690020	hadn't if I hadn't seen the Kana for it so but it's yeah yeah I'd like to check
8690020	8695100	it out at some point but probably never will oh yeah and they actually called it
8695100	8697900	in the limited location test they actually called it in dark to see it
8697900	8702180	clarifies in chat you beat with like a you and that's not a bad name for a game
8702180	8710100	but it could be taken many ways so you beat what we're 12 all right this is the
8710100	8713820	part of the show where we get a little bit angsty because I don't know we've
8713820	8732620	just been that way for eight years so deal with it it's the F use the week
8732620	8739260	if he goes to allergies and the city of Dixon namely they're pollen
8739260	8745980	locate after you too bad CD dumps
8748940	8753260	I don't know like overall I've had a pretty good week but in the past couple
8753260	8757980	days like like mother nature or whoever has it out for me out there was just
8757980	8763460	kind of like I'm gonna kick you in the balls but actually you know what all
8763460	8770340	things considered things could be a lot worse and I don't have it so bad so I'm
8770340	8775100	not that angsty but I will say an F you know there was something that it ticked
8775100	8777660	me off the other day and I was like that's gonna be my F you the week on oil
8777660	8779940	I ride now I can't remember what it was so I guess they didn't make me that
8779940	8786460	angsty F you to the fact that I still don't go out and buy a new car okay I've
8786460	8789420	been saying I'm gonna do it for like a year and I still have it if you to
8789420	8795620	myself all right let's get into a couple more stories and then oh god your calls
8795620	8800620	1877 game olr after a couple more stories here the skype line will be open
8800620	8805660	at orange lounge radio on skype or 1877 game olr but at first a couple more
8805660	8811180	stories looking I'm sure with infinity war going there not really going there
8811180	8815740	separate ways but they're kind of dissolving if you know what I mean I'm
8815740	8819140	sure they're going to treat the call of duty franchise with the utmost respect
8819140	8824060	although you kind of wonder with all these different domain names that
8824060	8827380	they're registering and I'm sure a lot of it's just to kind of make sure that
8827380	8833100	people aren't squatting on the moon the domains but a little bit kind of weird
8833100	8837740	okay like for example they have registered different variations for
8837740	8843180	quality including Call of Duty future warfare advanced warfare secret warfare
8843180	8849340	and space warfare as well as those same names with two and three appended to the
8849340	8857220	end space warfare really every weird
8858340	8867980	space warfare huh space warfare Call of Duty in space well that's got to be
8867980	8872300	better than vagina warfare no I'm being completely serious right now there's a
8872300	8880020	new game out and it's about vagina it's a game called privates it's on the PC
8880020	8885300	and apparently it's coming to the Xbox 360 I don't know how the hell this is
8885300	8888700	happening but apparently it's coming to 360 or at least that's what the
8888700	8896980	developers would tell you it's zombie cow studios it is quote you lead a teeny
8896980	8901940	tiny gang of condom-hatted Marines as they delve into people's vaginas and
8901940	8906900	bottoms oh I see it's equal opportunity and blast away at all manner of oozy
8906900	8917380	shouty monsters so you will be able to shoot the monsters that live inside the
8917380	8925460	vagina take this yeast infection yeah actually you will be able to blast all
8925460	8929620	manners of grody infections this looks like it looks like a sperm looks fucking
8929620	8935060	gross like an evil sperm I'm all for like you know pushing the envelope and
8935060	8945060	everything of good taste but this is just stupid like really really stupid
8945060	8948860	but you know I'll have to play it at least once you're shooting sperm you're
8948860	8953980	shooting evil spur look at that they're evil sperm yes they are they are evil
8953980	8957940	sperm I should make how the hell is this coming out on Xbox I'm gonna make a
8957940	8961340	live journal icon out of one of these evil sperm this is not coming out on the
8961340	8965140	360 I don't know who the hell they think they're kidding but there's no way this
8965140	8970340	game would not get an M or like a o rating and Microsoft has it in their
8970340	8973700	thing that a o games will not be released and even if they try to do it
8973700	8976980	as an indie game it will not get past the review board who the hell do they
8976980	8982500	think they're kidding it's kind of funny though in a 12 year old sort of way I
8982500	8987160	mean that's that's the that's the whole point right all right let's open up the
8987160	8991980	Skype line right now at one eight seven seven game olr or our username on Skype
8991980	8995820	is orange lounge radio so if you want to give us a call you can right now to give

9003260	9009580	straight at one eight seven seven game olr in the meantime we'll go try to get
9009580	9015100	some last-minute stories Loki do you have any last-minute stories yeah we're
9015100	9021420	talking a little bit about a movie coming for a game franchise well this
9021420	9026060	isn't necessarily a game franchise that's getting in a movie but it has
9026060	9031580	game stuff in it and that would be that wonderful short film pixels hold on
9031580	9035660	collar we'll get to you in just a moment pixels which featured Donkey Kong
9035660	9039100	Frogger space invaders and different stuff from Arkanoid that's being
9039100	9043380	actually made into a full-length movie now yeah I was reading about that the
9043380	9047220	other day that's pretty cool yeah happy mess and actually picked it up all right
9047220	9049940	let me go to the phone call are you there hi hello you're on orange launch
9049940	9057180	radio who's this this is Rob Rob hey I like your name what's up Rob I am
9057180	9061780	getting feedback I'm gonna have to hang up oh no okay with that with I have echo
9061780	9065820	one two three give echo one two three a call and hopefully that will work and
9065820	9069920	that's a good good reference for anybody who's thinking about calling the show
9069920	9074380	call echo one two three on skype before you call and hopefully that'll fix
9074380	9078260	whatever problem you're getting sometimes folks will get a little bit of
9078260	9082180	echo because just you know a little bit of background as to way we do it here at
9082180	9086820	orange andreo we have speakers in studio we do not wear headsets because we
9086820	9090380	there's too many of us to have headsets especially if we have a guest so we do
9090380	9094540	have in-house speakers so sometimes you will like hear yourself over the speaker
9094540	9098900	and it's a little crazy so do be aware of that if you call in and kind of hear
9098900	9102820	yourself all right let's try again hi you're on
9102820	9109540	orange on its radio who's this hey this is Rob again oh it's Rob above yeah the
9109540	9115620	right I the Rob above are you still getting feedback no I I was listening to
9115620	9119940	the show I had to turn off the feed so I could hear you ah yes that's a good
9119940	9123260	thing just like when you call real radio you have to turn off your speakers so
9123260	9127280	that will happen well hey I'm glad you're calling in Rob above what's on
9127280	9132780	your mind okay well first of all I saw you and Bobby playing 3d game heroes to
9132780	9140020	this afternoon yeah and have you gotten to Ortego town it's the second town is
9140020	9145700	that the one in the desert yes is that the one with the um foo foo sequence or
9145700	9150540	whatever it was called poof poof poof poof poof that's it it was the poof poof
9150540	9156300	sequence is is that what you might have been inquiring about yeah I thought that
9156300	9161660	was hilarious and also really dirty it was very dirty okay in mine like I don't
9161660	9165740	know if it was just the way I was playing but when he woke up from poof
9165740	9170860	poof it was the chicks dad was there and saying doesn't he give really good
9170860	9177820	massages like I was like this game is filthy absolutely filthy yeah that's what
9177820	9182340	I thought too and in fact they used massages the same way that incredible
9182340	9188220	crisis used massages to mean something else mm-hmm exactly well what do you
9188220	9191340	think of 3d game heroes obviously you've played a little bit if you've made it to
9191340	9197660	poof poof um I'm enjoying it at a Zelda level but it doesn't seem to to go much
9197660	9203380	beyond Zelda weren't you a little bit like just slightly disappointed at the
9203380	9207100	customization features in it like maybe I'm just being a greedy bastard but I
9207100	9210720	was kind of like you know again we live in an era of little big planet and I was
9210720	9214440	kind of disappointed that the only thing you get to change is the way the hero
9214440	9218760	looks like I was kind of thinking like maybe I'm crazy but that there would
9218760	9223580	have been more customizability to it yeah I was a little disappointed in that
9223580	9228360	too I knew it wasn't there but I was still disappointed right well at least
9228360	9232020	it was only $40 you know it was a budget game I still like yeah I think you're
9232020	9235200	right on a Zelda level though I mean if you want a great Zelda clone this is
9235200	9239380	definitely I'm one of the best Zelda clones I've ever played Agdeft in our
9239380	9245380	chat room says death by poof poof well I have one more thing to say and I'm gonna
9245380	9251540	post a link in the chat yes there was some story on digital times about or
9251540	9260380	digi times about 10 million iPhones being ordered by Apple of course and
9260380	9268580	that they they work on the Verizon type network wait a minute way wait a minute
9268580	9272420	I thought and I could have sworn I read this earlier this week and I'm looking
9272420	9275300	at I'm looking at your story right now I'm pulling it up but I thought that the
9275300	9279380	AT&T came out and like laid it on the table and said you know what bitches
9279380	9283700	we're under contract till 2012 so you needed to stfu when it comes to this
9283700	9292180	whole Verizon talk yeah but not if they call it an iPad mini that's but anyway
9292180	9297740	but funny yeah I don't think 10 million I think it's fake because 10 million is
9297740	9304020	a really bad number to order at startup it would be more like two two to five I
9304020	9308900	agree didn't the iPad didn't even have that many I mean it was far less like
9308900	9313780	not even a million iPads did they order right away I just yeah something strikes
9313780	9317620	me as fishy about this too but I just thought about it because you talked
9317620	9321740	about it earlier no it's it's you know and and like it or not iPhone is a
9321740	9326140	gaming platform and needs to be recognized especially we're seeing ports
9326140	9329540	of so many not just classic but new I mean there's it you can get Street
9329540	9333700	Fighter 4 on the friggin iPhone it's if you if you don't consider the iPhone a
9333700	9338620	gaming platform at this point you are behind the times yes sir
9338620	9343260	all right well Robin but it's nice to hear from you like actual here as
9343260	9346780	opposed to emails I mean don't get us wrong we love the emails too but always
9346780	9350340	good I'm here from new callers so uh anything else quickly you want to get
9350340	9354540	out there for let you go no that's it all right Robin you have a great night
9354540	9362180	night all right bye-bye did you get it bye-bye but forget it 1a77 game olr
9362180	9365540	username on skype is orange launch radio we can take a few more calls here
9365540	9371660	Loki see I gave him a pass on some of the Skype etiquette and so forth cuz a I
9371660	9376100	know he's listening to the show forever and be you know if it's your first time
9376100	9381300	calling in I'll give you a pass on some of that stuff so all is forgiven hi
9381300	9385900	you're on orange launch radio who's this hey what's up guys this is cut judo hey
9385900	9390260	what's up what's on your mind not much first of all I just want to say that
9390260	9397940	what was the game you're just talking about the Zelda 3d heroes yeah I call
9397940	9404620	that basically Lego Zelda it's a confusing game I I mean I I understand
9404620	9407860	that they it was kind of like a love letter to Zelda and all the other games
9407860	9412660	from back in the day so I you know I'm not you know I'm not knocking them for
9412660	9416820	making what everyone's calling the Zelda clone but just the look of it just it
9416820	9421980	looks really shitty man I mean it looks like our RPG maker for PlayStation 2 you
9421980	9424780	know any bad looking games and I don't know if you heard my review earlier in
9424780	9428020	the show but that's kind of one thing you know I do like the game and I do
9428020	9431140	recommend the game but one of its you know it's not a perfect game and one of
9431140	9435140	its imperfections is you know it still just kind of looks like a PlayStation 2
9435140	9441060	game and you know to some extent there's you know when you're doing retro I get
9441060	9443420	there's probably that the the audience that's sitting there listen to this
9443420	9448220	right now going well shit Rob if you're doing a retro style game what the hell
9448220	9453080	do you expect them to do and I don't know one thing might be like a free
9453080	9457660	roaming camera as opposed to four fixed cameras you get to pick from and yes I
9457660	9460620	understand you get to do them in screenshots but I don't know it seems
9460620	9464760	like they did have some optimization problems because again frame skip in a
9464760	9469820	dungeon that's not okay you know just tone down the water effects they didn't
9469820	9474420	need to be that awesome you know yeah I mean yeah that that game I'm pretty sure
9474420	9478920	is giving a lot of people seizures with the water I mean I can't even make out
9478920	9482020	what I'm looking at half the time you know it's I don't know it's just a
9482020	9486180	really weird creepy looking game to me I mean I was never into the Zelda games
9486180	9491140	to begin with so I would never pick it up but um it's just strange I don't
9491140	9495260	something off with it yeah I mean right on that's part if you weren't into Zelda
9495260	9499820	there ain't nothing here for you 3d I mean just just walk right on by there
9499820	9504580	ain't nothing here for you yeah and that and that sword is maybe the worst weapon
9504580	9508380	I've ever seen in a video game just just the look of it it's just over the time
9508380	9511740	yeah I mean I can't knock it too much because I haven't played it maybe
9511740	9514860	playing it you actually get some enjoyment out of it but looking at it I
9514860	9520620	literally wanted to puke on the television screen the best looking game
9520620	9524060	the best thing I could compare that sword to is just this more it's just
9524060	9528140	another low moment you know you did in that game is a lot of lol moments and
9528140	9531740	this that the ridiculous sword is just another one of them you just kind of
9531740	9535460	sit there and doesn't the sword doesn't the sword get bigger as you level up or
9535460	9538600	something like that you can go to a blacksmith and get your sword you can
9538600	9542300	alter the length and width of your sword and I was just waiting for earth I was
9542300	9547580	waiting for girth to be an option too but no way you can modify the beam that
9547580	9552700	it fires but um you can go to a blacksmith and get some of that altered
9552700	9557980	all right and my last comment is uh are you guys getting uh what is it red
9557980	9561460	dimension something uh I'm getting I can't remember the name but I'm
9561460	9565000	definitely getting it I know how sorry it's always yeah I'm absolutely good at
9565000	9568460	all again you already have it right I already have it yeah my boss is getting
9568460	9572420	another copy too because I think I've got one free for my work nice look it
9572420	9576620	must be nice is it like is it GPA in the wild west because that's basically what
9576620	9580100	I want that's all it needs to be for me um yeah it pretty much I mean it doesn't
9580100	9583820	play exactly like deep GTA but I mean there's a lot of similarities and I mean
9583820	9590260	it's not as like intense as GTA I mean there's a lot of me it's more open world
9590260	9593180	but there's not as much in the open world because obviously it's the Wild
9593180	9597940	West not like a bustling city but it's awesome and it looks like graphics wise
9597940	9602780	it's way better than GTA so it's pretty amazing I've ever GTA I was like wow
9602780	9606660	look at that I can look across the you know the river and see all these
9606660	9610380	different monuments and stuff like that and it just looks amazing so it'll be
9610380	9613820	awesome yeah yeah GP I live in New York and I
9613820	9616980	remember there was playing one multiplayer game and actually ran
9616980	9620740	through a little section that actually used to hang out when I you know I used
9620740	9624380	to hang out in that area when I was a kid and actually knew where to sneak
9624380	9628220	around and avoid people and you know avoid getting shot that's kind of a
9628220	9636140	creepy like I'm in a good way but that's Wow games are too realistic yeah I've
9636140	9641620	taken up enough of your time no I love the show we love the call have a good
9641620	9645940	one have a good night buddy all right all right some good calls tonight one
9645940	9650460	eight seven seven game olr username on skype orange lounge radio act deaf in
9650460	9655140	our chat room says I want a free copy of 3d dog game heroes I liked by the way I
9655140	9659460	like that last caller's comparison to Lego Zelda I think was a great
9659460	9663260	comparison that was funny and Donovan in chat says actually Lego Zelda sounds
9663260	9667620	like it could be fun especially with the Lego game sense of humor I that comment
9667620	9671140	actually kind of I think hits the nail on the head it's it's pretty pretty
9671140	9677540	accurate let's see Donovan says hmm Lego Wow just as fun of a joke game says the
9677540	9683340	guy who's all tabbing out of Wow to type in here addict Jamie you make friends
9683340	9687260	with a lot of Wow addicts I gotta say I know what's up with that more people
9687260	9690780	playing Star Trek online with me I still have the card I'm gonna use it at some
9690780	9694620	point but probably after Memorial Day because if I use it now I've got too
9694620	9698500	many trips coming up I'm going on two weekend trips back to back so I've got
9698500	9703500	to calm down and actually spend time playing the game and then I got a three
9703500	9706700	coming up to I got to worry about that I'm gonna be gone a week for that good
9706700	9711180	times oil are at e3 we don't know what we're doing yet but we'll have the
9711180	9715860	unfortunately it won't be Loki and Dark Sakura so we won't unfortunately be able
9715860	9719940	to bring you something collectively unless maybe there's like some type of
9719940	9723700	I don't know maybe we'll do something over Skype because you know Loki Dark
9723700	9727560	Sakura will probably be able to follow the news almost better online than I
9727560	9730140	will be being at the show but we are gonna hopefully bring you some cool
9730140	9734220	interviews at the show at least that is the idea Loki do you have any other last
9734220	9741260	minute stories over there that we can get to all we wait for some more calls
9741260	9744940	this is kind of actually ties in a little bit with the last order talking
9744940	9749700	about inappropriate games and of course you know leading the market of
9749700	9755740	inappropriate games would be Japan and developer tea time is bringing new
9755740	9764460	technology into the adult anime game franchise including they have the face
9764460	9770020	tracking T cam technology will now they're working on hand tracking as well
9770020	9776700	so you will be able to use the tall like accuracy to lift skirts and rip off
9776700	9782980	shirts of anime women and they have some demo videos displaying such
9782980	9791620	inappropriate but funny funny yes good stuff anything else for us tonight
9791620	9798060	if escapes come in the ps3 that's kind of neat and this is kind of
9798060	9803020	disappointing I guess but you know nowadays we have the internet the
9803020	9808060	Nintendo power line is gonna be disconnected on June 1st fuck that was
9808060	9815060	still open yeah is that the game counselors I think it is holy shit sorry
9815060	9818340	to hear though that they'll be out of jobs I mean that kind of sucks but yeah
9818340	9823980	I actually to be honest I didn't know you still existed sorry it was probably
9823980	9828660	just one guy with his feet up on the desk not getting cut it's like Loki
9828660	9834020	eating the sandwich I do that waiting for the call to come in I do that at
9834020	9839020	work hey if I eat the sandwich at my desk before I go to lunch that's more
9839020	9845220	time to play grant the thought of that's right anything else for us tonight Loki
9845220	9851860	or dark Sakura I don't know yeah I'm debating doing something really addict
9851860	9858100	II as long as it's not reactivating your Wow account no I'm considering finding
9858100	9860980	a cheap digital download key for Star Trek online so that I can play a joint
9860980	9865980	drill that is pretty uh but I get another 30 free days all right let's get
9865980	9868940	to another call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey this is
9868940	9873700	excellent x-link what's on your mind buddy never much I was just talking
9873700	9877940	about the EA about the charging the extra 10 bucks for the sports games yes
9877940	9880380	I'm surprised more people didn't want to talk about this what are your thoughts
9880380	9884660	on this actually I do because I love playing the sports games from EA in fact
9884660	9889460	I like playing all of them from time to time because it's a good way to calm
9889460	9893100	down after having a bad day at work especially something like Tiger Woods or
9893100	9900380	something though I don't condone what Tiger Woods did but whenever I think of
9900380	9905540	the Tiger Woods game by EA I think of the way South Park portrayed it and I
9905540	9908700	don't know if you saw that episode where they were like press X to slap him
9908700	9913380	president actually they have a game out like that where somebody made one that
9913380	9917820	was put basically Tiger Woods with Grand Theft Auto of course they do of course
9917820	9924020	it okay obviously shit tons of people and yes that's a metric measure shit
9924020	9928820	tons of people play these sports games even you know I I may kind of joke I
9928820	9931620	don't know a lot about them but it's not like I've never played a sports game in
9931620	9935260	my life I actually rather liked blades of steel thank you very much that was my
9935260	9940860	jam back in the day double dribble double drip double dribble was badass I
9940860	9945980	will totally buy NBA Jam when it comes out to well I will too that's gonna be a
9945980	9950460	great game anyway so so yes so the sports games so what do you think are you
9950460	9957140	pissed or you know seriously I don't go online that much to play online if I did
9957140	9961380	I could see maybe paying the ten bucks but personally I could give to you know
9961380	9964820	two shits about it because I don't really play it online that much if I did
9964820	9969060	I played it once in a blue moon so I mean I'm more playing it just for like
9969060	9972380	the season stuff for myself and see how well I can do at the team on on the
9972380	9976220	teams then I do didn't play in online guess other people that I mostly
9976220	9980900	probably end up cheating anyway so but um at ten bucks and they've really seen
9980900	9985380	them much compared to so so like um somebody said earlier about you know so
9985380	9991940	calm and it'd be in 20 bucks I mean you know it could be a lot worse I mean you
9991940	9997060	know so I guess my worry is that if this works it's only gonna get worse that's
9997060	10000980	my well it's gonna get worse no matter what I mean we got to think about a long
10000980	10004540	run they're gonna nickel-dime us no matter what rather it be downloadable
10004540	10011020	content where there be online play whether it be flying unicorns you know
10011020	10017660	it it's going to always be something so but I I look at is it if I give them 10
10017660	10020860	bucks they better have the servers running they better do it good and they
10020860	10024540	better have it so I can connect to people without any lag or anything like
10024540	10028140	that so I mean as long as they can do that kind of stuff I really don't see
10028140	10032540	any kind of problems so they probably won't I mean they're not gonna change
10032540	10035820	their service just because they're charging extra 10 bucks they think see
10035820	10038580	the problem is they have all this download content that was out there in
10038580	10041960	all these different ways that they were offering extra add-ons whether it be
10041960	10045860	buying cheats or buying you know extra crap that you probably don't need for
10045860	10049660	your sports games well that maybe wasn't working so well so now they're making
10049660	10055660	you buy 10 you know download or I guess multiplayer online if you you know
10055660	10059580	purchase the game used so that way they're getting you know some money for
10059580	10063720	that you know used purchase versus no money but I really don't think they
10063720	10068220	should be getting money for use purchase nowhere else in the industry any
10068220	10073540	industry do people get money for a used purchase if I buy a used car don't to
10073540	10077300	pay money to the manufacturer because they didn't sell me a new car too fucking
10077300	10082060	bad yeah I totally agree on that and that's gonna give other people in our
10082060	10085500	companies reason to do other stuff too and that could get out of control big
10085500	10090060	time but you know if I wanted to coach and play online real bad too I might
10090060	10092980	even look on eBay or something try to find a code on there to somebody's
10092980	10095540	willing to sell somebody goes you know buy at the game going you know what I'm
10095540	10098580	not gonna use their online I'm going to sell it I mean I don't see why they
10098580	10101540	couldn't do that I mean I see that all the time with other downloadable stuff
10101540	10104280	so that's a good point I mean maybe somebody doesn't really want to play
10104280	10107500	online or doesn't really have the whole hookup to be able to play online so
10107500	10110580	there's like hey I'm just gonna sell this code make a quick 10 bucks or 7
10110580	10113940	bucks recoup some of the money and then between that and selling the game used
10113940	10117580	in the first place make a little more money hey yeah precisely all right
10117580	10120460	actually we gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show but thanks so much for
10120460	10126060	your call anytime and good luck on hitting 80 this week I'm almost at 79
10126060	10129900	right now as we speak so all right thanks from what I from one addict to
10129900	10134260	another good luck yeah thank you you're welcome I feel kind of bad I think I
10134260	10138260	kind of got excellent cooked on that game like I feel like thank God I don't
10138260	10144060	have to pay like ripper like you know like what pay like alimony or something
10144060	10147860	like when I I ruin people's lives because of Warcraft I don't know all
10147860	10152780	right anyhow we're gonna wrap it up and get to the post show and all the fun

10174380	10177060	final thought for you

10185660	10189220	can skin in Red Dead Redemption it's too bad that you can't skin a human
10189220	10194660	apparently human skin does not sell for much that would be Mortal Kombat right
10194660	10200660	and my final thought is it is getting hot in here and I have to run errands on
