Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Who's the host?

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Dark Sakura

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
Sky and Loco

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, May 2nd, 2010

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Is a 6 player 2D Castlevania game on the way

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Bungie signs a new publishing deal

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
And is yet another sequel to Red Steel on the way

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Enough arguing about the graphics card in our chat room

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Jeez, it's like all these wars

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Can't we all just get along?

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
Oh hey, hello my friends and welcome to episode number 365 of Orange Lounge Radio

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
The video game talk show where every gamer has a voice

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
The one, the only, the ultimate, the sometimes friendly

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Hi

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
But always

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
My headache's gone

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
But always ready to make guacamole

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Oh my guacamole was really good

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Oh my guacamole

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Okay, I have to say something because

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
You know how I said two weeks ago, two or three weeks ago

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
That I was going to give up fast food altogether

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
While I decided to go semi-raw

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Oh my guac

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Not fully vegan because if I have an opportunity to have sashimi

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Then I'm going to eat sashimi

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
But for the most part, the easiest way to do it

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Is to go kind of raw vegan

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
And it's because I've had so many digestion problems

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
And so many other health issues

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
That I think this is the best way to see if it

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
It can't hurt, it can only help

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
I will say this, years and years ago

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Probably about seven, eight years ago

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
The crazy psychic

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
I used to date someone who was vegan

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Allegedly

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
I used to date someone who was vegan

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
And he really, really liked to cook

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
And I will tell you, and I don't like to cook

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
So I would eat whatever the vegan would make

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Well yeah, because I will eat anything a vegan makes

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Because you know, at worst case scenario

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
It's like tofu surprise

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
They're not going to go, surprise, it's brains of a cow

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Or you know, something in the dish

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Or Rocky Mountain oysters

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Yeah, you always know, it's vegetables

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Chat room, ask me what it is if you don't know

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
But I will say this

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Between that and that was at the peak

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Of me playing DDR during the tournaments

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
And that was when the orange bat stuff happened

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
When the show was born, etc, etc

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
I was never thinner

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Now I'm fat

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
And the whole thing of it is

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
I really just stopped and looked at everything

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
That I was consuming

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
I was having a couple of sugar free Red Bulls a day

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
And coffee

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
And I was having trouble sleeping, duh

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Gee, I wonder why

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
And I was really stressed out from work

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
And from my school projects

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
That a lot of other stuff had going on

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
So I just decided that it's time

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
That I stop putting this off

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Stop putting this?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Yeah, stop putting this off

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
And just start doing something for myself

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
And yeah, and no

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
It's not like the crazy vegan type of people

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Like, oh, organic food is the only kind of food you can eat

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
And all these have drugs in them

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Meat is murder

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Yeah, fuck PETA

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
However

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
I do think that

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
The belief would not be there

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
If there hadn't been some basis for it

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
So

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
I'm doing this for me

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
I'm not doing it for the bunnies

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
I'm doing it for the cows

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Although I did find that corn fed cow

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Makes me sick

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Grass fed cow does not

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
How strange

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Keep in mind they feed cows antibiotics

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
To make them digest corn

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Because cows are not meant to eat corn

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Neither are humans

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Anyhow

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Let me go

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
I gotta introduce everybody here

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
I'm sorry for going off on it

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
But I have to say right now

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
My headache has finally gone away

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Let me also introduce the host

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Voted least likely to go vegetarian

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Of all the OLR hosts

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Say hello to the one and only tech master Loki

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
I'll never go vegetarian

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
You'd have to give up your double downs

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
I don't eat the double downs anymore

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
It's not worth it

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Seriously

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
It was just experiment to see if it was any good

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
And I see right through their scam

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Of giving me two pieces of chicken

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
For a lot of money

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Tonight I notice you've gone back to the old standard

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Personal sized pizza

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Wrong it was six parmesan twists

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Oh okay I'm sorry

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
And it's because those are really delicious

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
But also vegetarian

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
No

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Not true vegetarian

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Because it's cheese and all that stuff

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
La ba ba ba

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Whatever the cheese and egg

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Labia what?

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Octolavio or something

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
I don't know

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
I haven't researched my vegan terminology

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
I did have eggs this morning though

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Because I went out to breakfast

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Maybe someone in our chat room knows the vegan terminology

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Chat.orangesolentrated.com

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
We'll tell you the topic in a little while but first

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
How was your gaming week?

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
DarkSakura

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
I played more Babylonian Twins which is pretty fun

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Super Street Fighter 4

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Which Drury is mean and evil

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
And bad ass

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Totally

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
And I played some pinball

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
And more

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Espagaluda

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Espagaluda 2

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
That's just kind of fun to say

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Espagaluda

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Espagaluda

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Let's talk more Super Street Fighter 4 cause I

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Bought it this week too

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
What console did you guys get it on?

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
We have 360

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
At PS3 but you guys have the fight stick right?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Why are you giggling?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Cause

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
That's cool

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
You guys have the fight stick on 360 right?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Yeah good times

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
But we do have some news though about

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
GameCrazy

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
And I was gonna wait until later on in the show

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
To say it cause I got an email

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Well I didn't show roll it because I didn't know if you wanted

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
To talk about it or not but go ahead and take the floor

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
I said I was gonna wait but meh

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
GameCrazy's gone out of business

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
So instead of my husband

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Having 3 weeks of work he's got 13

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Weeks of work so that's good

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
But at the same time

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Bye bye GameCrazy

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
I know the rumors have been floating

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Around the internet and I think the stories we've seen on the internet

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Were a rumor but

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
It's true

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
We got confirmation a week ago

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
So

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I'm more like a couple days ago

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
But for every door that closes another opens

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Blah blah blah blah blah

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
It'll be okay

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
We're not worried I'll put it this way we're not worried

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
So it's all good we're not worried

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
It's just a bummer though that

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
An alternative to

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
You know Baron Von GameStop

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Is now closing you know

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
It seems like they're just dropping like flies

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Did you totally see the game trader store that's on

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Antelope? And there's more local

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
We sell them yes and I know they have their

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Logo that's a blatant rip off

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Identical to GameStop

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Seriously the same

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
The same freaking font

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
I don't mean to get local

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
On you guys but maybe there's like

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
One or two sacri- here there's the guy

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
We met in the line at Target that listens to the show

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
So somebody in Sac- he's even still listening

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Some people in Sacramento are listening

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
There's also

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Have you seen that place on Sunrise? Smashburger

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Yes that too

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Same font, same white and red

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Color and everything but it's a burger joint

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
The font

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Is not a condensed font

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Close, close

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
It's different enough that they can't

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
You're weird

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
I know I noticed this stuff

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
By the way, by the way I know

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
I'm gonna take a picture and put it on the site

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
But this is the newspaper that I did

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Oh it's all like

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Actually printed on paper

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
It's a very- it's like I can get all my

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Jewish news

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Well it was for a fundraiser

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
The temple that I go to had a big fundraiser called All That Jazz

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
You were plugging in on the show a couple weeks ago

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
They wanted a newspaper to distribute

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
No OLR fans at the show

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
I didn't go

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
You know why I didn't go Rob

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Cause guess who's sitting her happy butt

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Here in this chair doing OLR

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
I'm sorry

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
That was me

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Anyhow, by the way there are some alternatives

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
There's what, the game trader

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Is that what they're called? Game trader or traitor

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Traitor

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
There's also that fair game

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Now I know the guys there

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
The guys at fair game are rad

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Aren't they expanding? Cause there's the one over on

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Fair Oaks and then there's one right by my house

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
In Rosemont

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Not that I should be plugging where I live

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
The guys there though, I do think that they

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Kinda overcharge a little bit on some of their stuff

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
But they have a friggin copy of Loom

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
For the turbo graphics

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
It's kind of hard to get stuff there

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
And they also do

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Disc resurfacing

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
And

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Xbox

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Repairs

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Quote

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Let me go to chat

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
chat.orangelandrarity.com

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Rama says with GameCrazy going out of business we only have GameStop left

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
There's a lawsuit in there somewhere

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Monopoly?

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Trust me there's people that want to make game stores all the time

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
And just like

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Blockbuster closing a bunch of stores

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
And Hollywood closing a bunch of stores

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Well Hollywood's definitely going to be closing a lot of stores

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
And the same with movie galleries and stuff

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
How that has sparked the independent

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Video growth

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Now you're gonna see

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
The independent

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Game store growth go up a little bit

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I mean GameCrazies are out there

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Definitely not out there as heavily

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
As say GameStop

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Right now but

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
There's always alternatives

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Search them out

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
You're also forgetting GameStop's biggest competitor

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
In some ways is Walmart

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Target

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Best Buy

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
You know those are all big big game retailers

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Now as far as the used game market goes

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I don't know

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
But you always hear rumors about those companies maybe wanting to get into it

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
I don't know

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
But it's just sad when

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
More stores like this close

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Especially when it affects people we know

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Very very well and so forth

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
I hope things go okay in that situation

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Let us know if there's gonna be any good sales at least

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Whatever silver lining

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
We can find in this tragic news

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
They are in the middle of liquidation

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
You know what they say, when life hands you lemons

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Throw them back

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Throw them against the wall, stomp on them, squish them

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
You know what, no no no

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
I like how Ron White puts it

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
To quote

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
When life gives you lemons, make lemonade

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Or when life gives you lemons

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Find someone who

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Who gives potatoes and makes them

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Put lemon vodka

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Or something

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
I

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
I said it wrong

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
I said it wrong

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
When life gives you lemons, make lemonade

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
And then go find someone whose life gave them vodka

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Alright

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Loki

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
How was your gaming week?

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
I don't even remember if we were still talking about that or not

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Once in a while we talk about video games

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Amongst the guacamole and the vodka

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Ron White quotes gone horribly wrong

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Yeah

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I played a few things this week

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
I tried out some of the

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Upcoming Xbox Live arcade games

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
I mean not anything I was really impressed with

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Cause they're just like ports of old arcade games

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Or semi-recent arcade games I guess

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Racestorm HD

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Kinda cool

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
I actually have Racestorm on my

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
My arcade cabinet at home

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
So

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Honestly it's just slightly

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Crisper graphics

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
And that's it but otherwise it plays

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Pretty much exactly the same

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
And then Neo Geo Battle

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Coliseum

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
It was okay I actually never played that in the arcade

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
And it was kinda neat to be able to

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Play as one of the characters from

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Metal Slug in a fighting game

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Cause he uses his gun a lot

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
But

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
It was pretty cool so that should be coming out hopefully

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Soon I know Racestorm I think we have it

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
In the show role I think later on

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
So that's also coming soon

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Then other things

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Play more Grand Theft Auto

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Still trying to

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Dominate that and

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Played against one guy today who thought

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
I love these people that

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
I play against that

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Think they're so good and gonna

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Teach me a lesson and stuff

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Then I get like a thousand

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Oh yeah

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
No no seriously they're like

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
You better remember that

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Yes you better remember that you got a lucky kill

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
On me after I chased you down through the entire

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Damn city trying to kill you even though I

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Was $1500 dollars ahead

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Oh yes you're so cool that you got one kill on me

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
I guess that totally negates

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Those other 15 I got on you

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
So you will remember that as the

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
One kill they got on you all day

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
And then you quit. Loser

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
And then

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
I actually went back to playing

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
A little bit more free mode because it is damn

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Hard to get a ranked deathmatch game

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Nowadays especially in

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
The Battle of Gay Tony so

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Free mode's actually been pretty fun we've been running

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Across a bunch of strange

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
People on there so

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Definitely a good time

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Waster

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Other non Grand Theft Auto

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Related stuff played some Marvel vs. Capcom

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
2 on my arcade cabinet

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Because I'm very excited

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
About the sequel coming out so

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Gotta get some of that

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
In

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Hopefully the server bought back because that's

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Awesome character to play as

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
And then

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
I think

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
I think that's it for right now because I know I've been

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Playing a lot of stuff but I just can't remember all of it

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Alright

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Well last week I didn't play a whole lot of games

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
So you guys would be very proud of me that I made up for lost time

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
This week I played Super Street Fighter 4

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
I bought it on PS3 because as I mentioned

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
On the show a couple weeks ago

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
I don't think I play enough

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Street Fighter to really justify the

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Arcade stick purchase

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
But I am a fan enough of Street Fighter where I

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Want to buy the upgraded version of

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Street Fighter so I bought it on PS3 because I've

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Decided I'm declaring war on that

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
D-pad on the 360 and I'm not

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Gonna buy games on the

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
360 that

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Rely on that D-pad so much because

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
It's just poop and they need to

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Release a new controller I don't know why it's taking them so long

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
So the Playstation 3

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
What's frustrating is they did

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
At one time remember in Europe

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
They had the green one and they fixed the D-pad

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Apparently

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Why would you

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
They're waiting for Natal or something I don't know

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
No they're not waiting for anything why would you

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Fix the problem and go

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Well we're not gonna fix it forever we're just gonna

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Fix it for this one run

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
I know there's people out there and especially

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Xbox and so forth

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Believe me I hate on all systems equally

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
That are gonna tell me that

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
You're just hating on Xbox

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
No it really made a difference

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
I noticed the difference in actually being able to pull off

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Combos and certain controls and maneuvers

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
On the PS3 way easier

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Than I was on the 360 so I'm just putting it

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Out there that's a personal preference I suppose

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
And everybody has their own but I did notice

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
The difference right away in playing on the PS3

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
On that controller

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
But the game itself putting the console

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Wars and so forth aside going to

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
The game itself I liked

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
It quite a lot I thought it was a very worthy

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Upgrade and a good purchase you know

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Street Fighter 4 as it was was a great

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Game but this upgrade having all the

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Characters unlocked from the start having

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
The extra 10 characters and some of the characters

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Are awesome like Dark Soccer said

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
I love Juri as well she's awesome

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
I like playing her online she's a cheap

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Mofo she is

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
And I love cheap Mofo as in Street Fighter

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
I was drawn

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
To her because you know when I was playing the game

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Alan was saying like she doesn't look like she belongs

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
In Street Fighter what is this what is

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Her she doesn't she doesn't fit

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
So I had to play as her and sure enough

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
She really kind of doesn't look like she belongs

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
In Street Fighter but she's cool

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
But I will tell you who I love

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Is Guy that is

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Oh I love Guy that's my favorite character to play

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
He's just fun and I like how

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Like every you know parting shot

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Of him is his butt

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
They have this thing with butts in Super Street Fighter 4

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Have you noticed? No I mean

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Surprise no I just

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Really like playing as him because he can fly across

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
The screen and do all these cheap kick moves that I love

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
I love Guy did you play Cody?

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
No but I

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Alan did and kicked my ass

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
He was throwing rocks at me and it was pissing me off

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Yeah and picking up the knife and everything

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
I think Guy can use him too though

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
I tried playing Hakan and I thought

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
The Turkish oil wrestler

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
I thought he was kind of hokey I didn't like playing as him

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
But then again I'm not a big fan of the Zangief

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
T-Hawk type of characters

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Well the whole point with him is that you're supposed to

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Build up his oil

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
You know over and over and over and when he's really slick

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Then you can do like all of these crazy moves

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Yeah I know but

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
I don't have the patience

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
And I have to say though that

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
If you've ever seen Turkish oil wrestling

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
He's really glorifying it way too much

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I have to tell you though

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
This is a huge accomplishment for me

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
I was playing matches online

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Ranked matches and winning some

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Like that's huge for me because I don't think

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
I ever won a single one on 360

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
But I won my first match on PS3

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
I'm not winning them all but I'm winning some

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
I gotta say

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
The skill match I'm getting

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Is actually pretty good because

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Like I will play a guy

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
And go for like five rounds if the game

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Is configured that way and you know

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Win narrowly and

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
There will be like another guy I was fighting back and forth

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
We just kept coming up against each other

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Ranked matches and he won half and I won half

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Like it's actually really matching me up pretty well

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
So I gotta uh

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
I gotta say that

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Tigerclaw in chat says oh here's another thing guys

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
If you play as Guy or Cody in the car smasher bonus

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Stage you get the oh my car

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Easter egg, oh I thought that was normal

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Because the first time I ever played that bonus stage

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Was with Guy and I just thought

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
That was what was supposed to happen

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
But that makes sense because that happens in Final Fight too

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Speaking of Final Fight

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Alan and I decided just for the hell of it we would

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Play through all of Final Fight

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Double Impact version, the Final Fight game

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
And so we played through the whole game

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
The other night, it doesn't take that long

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Maybe an hour at most so that was kind of fun to play

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
And so we went through that and

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
The other big big event

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
In my world is that I

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Finally said I can't take it anymore

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
With my old graphics card

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
And I upgraded to a new video card

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
In my computer so

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Finally WoW is running at top speed

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
60 frames a second is beautiful

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Gorgeous but more importantly

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
I'm also able to play

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Games on my PC that I wasn't able to

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Play before because my graphics card

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Was kind of shoddy and one of those big ones

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Would be Dragon Age so I

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Finally, because I bought Dragon Age during the Christmas

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Sale when it was only like 30 bucks

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
But I was really having a hard time

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Playing it because my old video card just couldn't

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Handle it and for those of you that are asking

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
It was a 8, I originally

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Had an ATI Radeon

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
3300

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
I think in my computer

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
And so I decided

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
I don't want to restart the video card wars

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
That were starting at the beginning of the show but I thought

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
It would just be easier since my

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Computer had come with an ATI card originally

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Just to get another ATI card

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Call that stupid logic if you want

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Whatever I don't care the card I got works

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
I got an ATI Radeon

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
5770

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
And there was a lot of drama trying to get the card

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Installed because

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Bless Alan's heart he knows how to do all that stuff

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
I could probably

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Figure it out but this thing

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Would have confused the hell out of me because this

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Graphic card like takes up two slots

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
It's so big and has like

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
This gigantic fan on it and that would have

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Confused me and then we had to actually

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Go upgrade the power supply

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Because it needs its own power source

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
And like it can't run on

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
The old power supply I had

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
So yeah thank god he knew how to recognize all this

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Stuff because I would have just been lost and cried

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
You might have been able to get away with the old power supply

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
If you had the converter for it but

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
We just got a new supply it was like 30 bucks

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
And now it's like 600 watts

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
As opposed to 300 so it works great

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Oh 300 yeah

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
So yeah no the card works great

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I was able to play Dragon Age so I was playing that for a couple hours

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Did a little bit of the

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Warrior human beginning because Alan wanted to show me

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Some stuff there and I was

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Playing the mage opening a little bit earlier today

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Which played so much better

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
But I understand this game is on

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Consoles but man I can't

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Imagine how it must control on consoles because on

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
The computer it's just so

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Fluid and just makes sense

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Especially for like somebody who's kind of been playing

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
WoW a long time like me so

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
I am considering checking out

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Star Trek online just because Dark Soccer

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Always never shuts up about it and

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
It's fun I know but here's the thing

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
There was a big sale on the store

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Steam store this weekend I couldn't resist

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I bought Guild Wars trilogy for 20 bucks

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
And you got to admit

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
It's not a bad deal for Guild Wars

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Because Guild Wars is one of those games

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
You don't pay a monthly fee for it so I

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Can buy it now and if I have the itch to play it

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
In like six months I can just say oh just fire

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Up Guild Wars Did you overclock your graphics card

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Once you got it? I don't think he did that

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Oh he should it's simple

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
And it's extra

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Oomph it runs beautifully

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
I'll tell you what Guild Wars looks gorgeous

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
I started playing the Prophecies

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Campaign as a Paragon which you know

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
I had only I'm sorry no no

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
No Prophecies is the original so I was

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Playing Nightfall whatever the newest one is

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
I played that as a

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Paragon which is one of the new classes

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
They're kind of like Egyptian influenced it seems like

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
And so I was playing through the openings that it's

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Gorgeous oh my gosh

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Gorgeous looking stuff

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
So I didn't really play it enough

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
I mean both Dragon Age and Guild Wars I only

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Spent a couple hours with so but I just

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
It's fun to be able to play PC games

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Again and not have my computer crying out

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
In pain from it and what's also

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Exciting and I just realized on the drive over

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Here is that

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Between that new card my quad core

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
My 8 gigs of ram I ain't gonna have a

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Problem playing Final Fantasy 14 on my PC

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Woo woo

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
So waiting for that baby test

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Help

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
I need to upgrade my graphics cards because I have two of them

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Running in SLI but they're like

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
8800 Radeon GTS

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
512

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Do you want my old card? I don't know what's better

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
I have a power supply and an old video card

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
My card's way better than that

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
It's just a lot of stuff

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Like if I were to go back and do it again

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
A lot of these games don't run

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
SLI and it's really disappointing

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
And I guess you don't really get that much benefit from it nowadays

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
But um

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
I don't know I've got two slots

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
To put graphics cards I almost feel obligated

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
To get two more but

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Brad from Pod Culture

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
In chat says Sky didn't know it was on sale

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
You just sold me on it there you go

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
When you write NCsoft put

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
As heard on OLR

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
No but that's great no but I think the logic

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Is fine because you know 20 bucks

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
For the three game series and no monthly fee

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
I mean that's a pretty darn good deal

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Guild Wars isn't a bad game by any means

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
I don't think you'll play it forever

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
But I think you'll kind of go

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
It's one of those games you'll be like

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
You know I'm kind of bored of WoW and Star Trek

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
And Final Fantasy and all the other MMOs

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
I'm playing right now

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Just fire up Guild Wars for the hell of it

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
What the hell is going on in Guild Wars these days

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
That's kind of how I've found it

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
I've played on and off for the past five years

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Alright anyhow enough of our gaming weeks

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Let's move on and get into some housekeeping tonight

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
I don't have a lot except for

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
I might not be here Memorial Day weekend

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
It looks like I might be taking a trip

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
So we might not have a show then

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Pre-taped or something something

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
But that's the first time I'm also telling Jamie and Loki

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Because I didn't think of it earlier

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
We'll see

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Memorial Day weekend

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Three day weekend so if you guys want to get away

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
I'm planning a trip it looks like

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
I probably won't be here

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
We'll see

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
It's not going to be an extravagant trip

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Just a little getaway

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Anyhow

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
More to come on that in the upcoming weeks

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
We'll let you know for sure what's going to happen

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
That's Memorial Day weekend

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Which I imagine a lot of our listeners

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
A lot of them are probably going out of town

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Anyhow

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Also our Twitter

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Twitter.com slash OLR and our Facebook

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Of course is available too at Orange Lounge Radio

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Join us there, friend us

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Like our posts, share us, help us spread the word

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Because we don't really have advertising dollars

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Another place where we could really use help

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
iTunes and five star reviews on iTunes

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Just look up Orange Lounge Radio in the iTunes store

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
And say a couple nice words about Orange Lounge Radio

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
We really appreciate

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
It really does go a long way

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Because the more positive reviews you get

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
The higher you go up in the rankings

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
And you get a little more visibility

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
And it works

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
That's why a lot of podcasts you listen to

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Want to get the reviews on iTunes

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Because sometimes it's hard to stand out amongst the crowd

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
And I'll tell you what, it's tough

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
When you have G4 and IGN

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
And GameSpot and all these companies with

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Limitless amounts of dollars

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
And budget to pour into advertising

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
It's hard to stand out amongst that

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
So we rely on the OL Army to help us out

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Alright, let's actually get into some gaming news

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
We'll have to actually put down the guacamole

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
For a little bit, step away from the vegetables

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
And get into some actual gaming news

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Loki, start us off tonight

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
I like to call this kind of like

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
I don't want to go on the same tangent

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
As we did last week, but

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Kind of like Idols gives back

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
This is Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Gives back, I guess

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Apparently with the new

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Firmware or dashboard

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
That was out

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
At the beginning of April

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
On the Xbox 360

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Comes with it some glitches

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
For some reason that work with

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Allowing certain arcade games

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
That you may have in trial form

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
To work as a full game

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Instead, without having to pay

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Any extra monies

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Uh oh, uh oh

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
So here's how it works, and it couldn't be

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Any simpler

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Of course you have to have the latest dashboard

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
The 9199, the one that allows

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
You to have the USB support

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Pop in your Modern Warfare 2 disk

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Let the game load up to the main menu

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Once you get to the main menu, hit the wonderful

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Xbox guide button

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
That's on your controller

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
And it will pull up of course the old

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Kind of blades

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
That you can select stuff

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Go to quick launch

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
And choose the trial game of choice

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
To play it as a full version

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Now this doesn't work on all games yet

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
And there's really just a small list that they have

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
So far that it works with

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
But I mean, hey, might as well try it on

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Whatever

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Some of the games that have been shown to work with it so far

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Fatal Fury Special

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Metal Slug 3

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Samurai Shodown 2

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
And Metal Slug 7

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
All those of course being published by SNK

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
So maybe other SNK games

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Might work as well

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Let's see

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
And apparently also there might be

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
The King of Fighters 98 Ultimate Match

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
And Guru

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Mark of Wolves

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
I might play on it as well

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Okay, break this down for me

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
How smart do I have to be with my hacking cracking sense

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
To get this to work?

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
You don't have to hack anything

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
It's just part of the dashboard

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
It's basically, it's just a glitch

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
All you have to do is pop in your game

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Modern Warfare 2

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Put a button on your controller

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
And then select quick launch to

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
How does that happen?

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
I don't know

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
I don't know how you would figure it out either

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
That is really bad

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
It's not that we necessarily enjoy

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Bringing these things to light

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
But I think it needs to be said

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Like, oops

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
This is a huge flaw

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
And you can earn achievements on those games as well

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Oh my gosh

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
I would imagine it's gonna get patched out at some point

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
But might as well enjoy it while it lasts

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
We need to introduce something new here on

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Orange Lounge Radio called

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
The Dup Factor

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
That's right, the Dup Factor

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
And the Dup Factor would be

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Days until the patch

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
DUP, Days Until Patch

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Loki, what do you believe is the

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Dup Factor?

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
I'm not sure because I don't think this is

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
This hasn't been published on like

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Major blog sites or anything like that

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Usually when it does hit those

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Good thing no one listens to this show

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Yeah it's a good thing

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Once that happens they'll be like

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Because

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Obviously Microsoft doesn't read every forum

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Out there so

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
It's hard to say

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Yeah, so that's interesting

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
And if you don't happen to have

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Mario Warfare 2 that's okay

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Because there's other glitches that also involve

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
The 9199 dashboard

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
As well, a couple of the games

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Were also found to be working

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
As full Xbox Live arcade

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Games as well

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Apparently

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Some of them have to do

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
With

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Like for example Worms

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Is one of the games that actually works as a full

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Xbox Live arcade game if you

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Transfer it to a USB card

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Because originally they did have

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
A version of Worms that came on a memory

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Unit and it actually worked as a full game

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
As long as it was on a memory

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Unit so you can try that as well

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
And that doesn't require any sort of game

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Purchasing whatsoever

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
And apparently

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Family Game Night has something else that

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Works like that as well

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
But I'm not sure

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
What's involved with that one

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
But it's just interesting to see

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
That a lot of these glitches are out there

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
I put the dump factor at

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
7 days. I say by this time

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Next week it's out

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
I think the

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Red alarms are going off at

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Microsoft as we speak

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
I just found out about it this week

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
This has been posted for about 3 weeks

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Now so

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Has anyone, what was the last posting

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Date? The 22nd

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
So it may already

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
No

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
It nothings

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
No I think somebody would have said something in that little thread he's looking at

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
If that's the case

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
We would have seen a patch on the dashboard

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Or we would have seen a patch for Call of Duty

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
I say 7 days

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
We'll see

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Alright

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Now Loki I'm sure you would not be taking

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Advantage of a patch like this

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Or if you have it's only for journalistic purposes

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
I don't really care

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
And honestly

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Yeah it's just the SNK games

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Well

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Dude I have a JTAG console

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
I don't need this crap

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Alright

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Moving on to other stories

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
That aren't so shady

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
But more of a surprise I think in some ways

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Nintendo Magazine in France

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Apparently has confirmed the existence of

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Red Steel 3

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Apparently the series

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Which as you know is kind of like a first person hack and slash

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Type of thing

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
It's going to be a trilogy even though apparently the second game

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Did not sell that well which you were talking about last week

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
On the show right Loki?

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Red Steel 2 not doing so hot?

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Well they were saying it wasn't doing hot

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Because they only have data from like

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
You know what 10 days

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Not that long

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Well apparently the game is going to support

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
The Wii Vitality sensor

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Oh god fail

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Right there fail

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
I'm sorry

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
That's going to be awful okay

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Absolutely awful because

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
What's the point at that

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
So how are you going to control the game now

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Because you're going to have

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Where are you going to plug the nunchuck into

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
And come up with some sort of splitter or something like that

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
For the Wii remote

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
I can't see how this is going to work

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
I don't know either

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
I don't write the news I just report it just so you know

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Fail

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
That's all I got to say

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
I was looking for a clip of the old school DDR failed boys

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
To play

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Behind that

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
There was a couple other things I wanted to say about this

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
It's supposed to

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
I guess this is just part of

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
If you think about it Red Steel 2

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Supported the motion plus

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Red Steel was kind of a launch

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Title for the Wii

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
It would not be a surprise if this supports the Vitality sensor

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Because it's just yet another add on

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Of Nintendo's that Ubisoft is supporting

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
The only one that Red Steel really didn't

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Get on was the balance board

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
To be honest

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
So

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
There you go even though Loki is not a big fan of it

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Apparently Red Steel 3 with Vitality sensors

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
The Vitality sensor is retarded

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
I'm sorry it's absolutely retarded

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Yeah it will be wonderful

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
For the Wii Relax game that comes out

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
And people will buy it because it's like

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Oh look you can relax now

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Now that Nintendo is helping you

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
How do you really know yet though

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
I mean all you've really heard about this

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Is a concept you haven't seen it in motion yet

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Maybe it will be neat

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
No it won't

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
That's like saying oh blood pressure

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
You know I get to take my blood pressure now

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
That's so exciting

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
I mean old people are like that

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
You know they go to the drug store

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Take their blood pressure

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Well I beg to differ

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Who's buying the Wii

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
I actually beg to differ

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Well they're not going to be playing Red Steel 3

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
I

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Well this is someone who gets a blood test twice a year

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
And has her blood pressure checked regularly

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
So

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Yeah but is it fun

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
If it keeps me alive

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Yeah but I don't consider that fun

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
I had to have four MRIs

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
A couple years ago to keep me alive

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
But I wasn't exactly like gosh I wish I had one of these at home

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
It's a lot of fun

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
It's like a colonoscopy

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Oh that helps you stay alive

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Some people get off on that

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
The Wii virtual colon sensor

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Thanks god

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
For when the Human Centipede video game comes out

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
I'm just saying though

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Fun aside

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
I do want to say

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
They'll be illegitimate

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
And they did say there was like a subtitle

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
At least on the Human Centipede

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
That it makes it seem like it's going to be one of a series

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
So I'm like

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
That discussion on that movie

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Has gotten far too much airtime

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
On the all news network

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Let's move on to some more

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Video game stories

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
I was actually putting something up for you Rob

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
What's that

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Come and look at it

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Is that Gaia?

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Yes it is but so they put up an item called

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Starmony

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
That's a little rainbow unicorn that says open your eyes

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Loki's the rainbow unicorn fan

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Not me

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Who's the one that's always playing the rainbow unicorn game

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
That would be Loki

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
You need to put that on his wall

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
I'm going to post it on my Facebook later

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
But I thought it was funny

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Anyway

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
So how about a story

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
How about something about Guitar Hero

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
I think

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Is that

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Activision is sending out the feelers

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
To see if people would be interested

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
In Red Hot Chili Peppers

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Guitar Hero

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
I guess but aren't most of their songs

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
In like Rock Band or Guitar Hero

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Already?

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Isn't the whole Blood Sugar Sex Magic album

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
On Rock Band?

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
I think that it's

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Supposed to also have an exclusive

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
For their new album

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Oh

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
That's at least the speculation

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
But then again

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
You can get the whole thing of Blood Sugar Sex Magic

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
On Rock Band

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
But I mean

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
The Red Hot Chili Peppers were much more than one album

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
I mean they are

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
They're an important band

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
I've been listening to their stuff since George Clinton produced them

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
You know

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
P-Funk

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Parliament

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Multicolored dreads

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
They gotta be older

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
I think

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
40's at most

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
They've been doing it a long time

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
I was listening

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Blood Sugar Sex Magic came out

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
When I was in high school

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
And I had already been listening to

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Actually a song off of Mother's Milk

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Was in Say Anything

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
So that's late 80's

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
I think they started in

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
84?

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Well I mean if Green Day

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Can have their own game

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
But Red Hot Chili Peppers is far more

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Expansive than Green Day

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
I agree to an extent

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Yeah

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
But

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
I think it's a good choice

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
For their own video game

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I would look at it

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
I don't know if I'd pay $50 for it

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
But I'd look at it and I'd go oh neat I like these songs

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
You know

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
So

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
We'll see though I don't know

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
There's a part of me that goes I don't know Guitar Hero Van Halen

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Was kind of poop

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Yeah

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
They're better off sticking with Rock Band

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Just putting out more content for Rock Band

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
We'll see

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Well I'm just like

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Cause I thought they were supposed to be

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Cutting back

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Well I guess they sort of have cut back on Guitar Hero a little bit

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Cause we haven't had a game in like 6 months

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Well not 6 months 4 months

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Yeah 6 months

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Is that counting DS versions and all that?

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
And yes

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
It does count DS versions and whatnot

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
And nothing I've seen

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
On the horizon yet until like

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Fall

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Which is good

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
So here's a rumor that's kind of interesting

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
We may have talked about it

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
A little bit before when it was

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Discovered as a trademark

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
From Konami, Harmony of Despair

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Well the

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
A trusted source as

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Joisic puts it

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Harmony of Despair

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Is a 2D 6 player

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Xbox Live arcade game

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
You'll get to play as some of the old

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Characters or I guess main characters from a bunch

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Of different games and it's supposed to kind of

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Appear like

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
The Game Boy Advance or DS

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Versions

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Of the game so I guess like you know

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Super NES type of thing

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
And you'll get to play

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
With a bunch of people at the same time

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
And they'll actually be able to zoom out

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
To show where everyone's at

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
And stuff like that so 6 player co-op

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Castlevania sounds kind of fun actually

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
I feel like God has finally

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Listened to me, thank you

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Thank you Jesus

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
This is what I've been asking for

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
For how long now on this program

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Give me a old school

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
2D new Castlevania

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Game on my television

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
And this sounds sweet that it's gonna be like

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
6 player zoomy in out co-op stuff

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Sounds kind of rad actually

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Sounds way better than Judgment

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
And then when you're done with this Nintendo give us a new Metroid like this

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
And then when you're done with this

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Konami can come back and give me a new Contra like this

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
No Frogger

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Do not want Frogger

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
With 6 people

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Unless it's an

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Extreme Frogger

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
I gotta admit though this sounds very awesome

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Like can you imagine being able to explore

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
The castle with multiple people at the same time

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
But how would that work because

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
There's gonna have to be some type of like

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Random castle generator element

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
To it or something or else it's always gonna be the

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Same damn game

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Obviously this is a very

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Early type of story and it's also rumor right

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
It's not confirmed

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
But maybe they're gonna have multiple castles

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Or something like that or you'll be able to download

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Extra castles later on

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
I really want more information on this soon

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
This sounds great

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Or maybe that partner net site

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Will leak everything like it always does

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
That would be wonderful too

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
I know what do you think your

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Castlevania fan Dark Soccer would like to see?

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Oh I'd be all over that heck yeah

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
We're gonna play 6 player heck yeah

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Dude totally

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
That's right I'll whip you

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
But think about it I bet Dark Soccer

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
If they're talking about multiple characters

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
You'll get to be

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
You'll get to be Alucard

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
You'll get to be Maria

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
I bet hands down a lot of the famous Castlevania

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
I do remember they had

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
I would have to play

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
They had Alucard on the list

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
There was another site that covered it also

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
They had some more information but

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
I remember Alucard being on the list

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Amae Satsuma in our chatroom

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
chat.orangelandstrategy.com says

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
I'd be fine with a 6 player Frogger

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
If I could play as a truck

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
That would be awesome

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
I want to play as a gator

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
That's like Frogger versus

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Remember in Pacman versus you could be the ghost

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
That would be amazingly fun

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Total side note

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
It's not on our show roll but I think this chatroom

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Comment is worth reading Spyro in our chat says

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Is there no more game room games being

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Released now? You know they were supposed

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
To put out like Pitfall

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
And Super

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Breakout I think were some of the big

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Games this week and it got halted

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
The release just

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Didn't end up happening

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
And there was actually a tweet

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Over on god I can't believe I'm using

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Twitter but the thing is

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Game room did not have much of a good

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Website behind it I mean I guess they have an official

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Website but it kind of sucks

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
They don't have the greatest web presence I don't know

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
This thing was kind of set up to fail from the beginning

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
But on their Twitter which is

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
At live game room they say

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
First off they

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Broke the news by

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Retweeting Major Nelson

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Just shows you how

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
It's totally burped excuse me

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
That's awesome

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Professional radio

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
They broke the news by retweeting

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Major Nelson saying

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
We're working to bring you additional game room titles

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
As soon as possible I'll let you know

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
The moment I have more details

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
And then they

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Sent an at message to somebody

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Saying there was a delay in the game pack release

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
We'll update when we've got more details

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
That's it

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
So I mean fail fail fail fail

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
I kind of regret

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
A couple weeks ago when I was

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Reviewing game room on the show I said

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Hey this is going to be better than

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Virtual Console because at least you know

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Although it has plenty of room for improvement

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
It's more than just straight up ports of the games

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Well I mean

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
At least games are

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Coming out for Virtual Console

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
It just

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Irritates me because there was so

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Much potential

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Here

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Can you imagine if they had

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
I'm sorry they have just crashed

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
And burned with

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
It's so frustrating

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
It's an awesome idea

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Well they should have integrated it with

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Like different Xbox Live

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Arcade games so it wouldn't matter

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
That they're not putting out any because you could

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Still use your Xbox Live arcade games

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
And have them in your arcade

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
And what not

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
And then here's the thing

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
SHJ100Matt says Seriously game room was supposed to be

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Microsoft's answer to home

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
But it's just as much of a failure as home so far

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
That is

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
I don't know if I'm okay with the game room

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Home comparisons

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
I think people assumed

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
It was going to be like home

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Because you would be able to navigate around in the first person

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Which was I don't think ever the case

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
I think Microsoft's always kind of strung you along

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
With the well maybe we'll implement that someday

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Dude you can't even fucking release

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
A new pack for the game on time

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
You're not going to have the full

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
First person movement around like home

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Ever

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Ever

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Prove me wrong please

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
I'm just irritated because the problem is

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
If this fails

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Which it's starting to look more and more like it's going to

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
And how fucking disappointing is that

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
That we're never going to get any more packs for this game

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
At the rate we're going

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
You know whatever happened to like the 1000 games

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
If this thing fails

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
We're not going to see anything like it

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Until maybe the next generation

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Maybe

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Maybe on Nintendo's Wii HD

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Or whatever console they do after the Wii

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Maybe they will finally say

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Okay you can play the old NES games

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Over the internet after you re-buy them

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
For five bucks a piece

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Just irritates me

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
I am mad

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Anyway

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Rob

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Deep breaths

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
As a retro game fan

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
You know I was really excited about

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
A lot that Game Room had to bring

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
And it didn't really suck

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
I mean there was a lot of promise with it

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
I mean yeah they could have had a little more

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
Hopefully

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
I'm just overreacting and this is all fixed

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
In a week I mean maybe they had problems

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
With the whole PC and I heard people

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Were able to hack certain games in Game Room

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Like a lot of the high scores on asteroids

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Were faked so maybe for quality

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Purposes they pulled it back

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
But when I hear about these layoffs

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
When I see crappy web support

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
You know for this

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
My hope fades more and more

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
I have a feeling that there's going to be all sorts of

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Exploits

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
With it because it's in file form

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
And people have modded consoles

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
And they're going to hex edit crap

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
So that they can cheat in the games

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
It's going to script the leaderboards

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Prove me wrong Microsoft please

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Please I would love to get proven wrong on this

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Meanwhile other news

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
PlayStation 3 and here's something

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Else to rage about

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Of course

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
We reported a couple weeks ago on the show

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
And I'm sure you read about it everywhere on the internet

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
You saw this first hand

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
They took out the other OS feature

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
On the PlayStation 3

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
They released a patch to do nothing

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
But remove a feature on the PlayStation 3

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
And I believe we said

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Oh I wonder how long before somebody sues

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Well days until suing

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Would apparently be about two weeks

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
That's right about 14 days

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Somebody sued

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
A class action lawsuit for removing

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
The PlayStation 3 support for other OS's

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Anthony Ventura is the

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Class action lawsuit filers name

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
The plaintiff

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
I'm a plaintiff

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
He filed a class action lawsuit against the company

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Saying that it's a breach of contract

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
False advertising

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
And you know all this other big legal words

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
He says that the other OS function is extremely

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Valuable

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Although players are not forced to download the update

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
If you don't you can't access

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
The other features on your PlayStation

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
So you're either locked out over here

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Or you're locked out over here

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Apparently the amount is in excess

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Of five million dollars

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Is how much they're looking to get in damages

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
I don't know if it'll work

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
But it's interesting that somebody's actually

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Filed the lawsuit over this

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
As I suspected somebody probably

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Would in this too happy nation that we're in

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
I don't know what do you guys think

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Will happen with this lawsuit

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
I don't know it'd be interesting to see

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
How it plays out

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
I'm interested because I have a system

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
That you know hasn't been updated yet

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
And I'm not planning on updating it

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Because guess what I haven't bought any new games

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
For it since

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
LittleBigPlanet

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
I think the biggest kicker here is

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Are they gonna be able to prove that this was

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
An advertised feature

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
That's gonna be tough

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
And I don't think they're gonna be able to get away with it

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Maybe in other countries but not here

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
I don't remember that being advertised

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
It's not on a commercial or something

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
But they did advertise it coming out of E3

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
And that kind of stuff

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
It's a console it's not like you know

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
People didn't know it was there

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
But I do think it's kind of

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Messed up

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
It's the whole kind of conspiracy part of it

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Or I guess paranoia part of it

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
It's like if they're gonna take this out

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Because some hacker or whatever

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Found a way around

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
You know their copy protection

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Which didn't really happen

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
I don't think anyone's actually found a way around

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Their copy protection yet other than the fact that

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
They're starting to mess around

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
With Linux but

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
You know if that's the case

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Then what if someone finds a way with

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
You know the Xbox or not Xbox

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
PlayStation 1 emulation or something like that

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Or are they gonna remove that too

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Or you know

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Even on older consoles

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
That can play PlayStation 2 games what if they find a way with that

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Are they gonna remove the PlayStation 2

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
You know backwards compatibility

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
I'm surprised they haven't

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
So I don't know

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
And yeah let's just say for example

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
That they decide later on

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Hey you know what we're gonna start selling PlayStation 2 games

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
On the PlayStation Network

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Now we're gonna remove your backwards compatibility

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
So you have to buy those games from us

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Again

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
That would be kind of shady

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
And if you want to play your PlayStation 2 games

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
You can go buy one of our $99.99

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
PlayStation 2 slim systems

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
But at the same time

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Let me play devil's advocate for a minute here

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Because Rama says forget the lawsuit

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
People just trade in your PS3's

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
For something worthwhile

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
That chat coming from chat.orangestonsrated.com

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Well I mean to play devil's advocate

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
You never could install Linux on a 360

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
You can't even get the web on your 360

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
I mean

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
You can now but

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Well

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Without legitimately

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
None of these features are possible

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
I mean you can still get the other OS feature

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
On your PlayStation 3 too if you know where to look

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Right

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Um

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Not yet

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Well it's being worked on or something

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Anyway

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Uh yeah I guess we'll see what develops with this

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
It'll be very interesting though because you know what happens

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Is that if this guy wins

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
You'll all be able to get a check in the mail for like

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Five whole dollars

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Cause that's what happens with class action lawsuits

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Or maybe they'll have to give out a free game or something

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
I don't know

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Yeah but I mean what if that free game is like

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Yaris 2 for the PS3 or something

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
It doesn't have to be a good game

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Freeze free?

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
I don't know

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
There's some things that you couldn't even pay me to play for free

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
It's like bad

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Anyway let's move on more gaming news Darcy

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
How about something happier? Yes happy happy joy joy

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Cub Scouts!

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
I thought you said happier

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Yeah okay I know little Mormons in training

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Um sorry I didn't say that

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
I was in the Cub Scouts for a year

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
One whole year

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
I was in the Cub Scouts and the Boy Scouts

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Never became a Mormon

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
In fact I

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Just learned how to set fire to things and tie knots

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
I forgot the knots part

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Oh if only they knew I was a gay in training

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
It's so awesome though

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
I mean seriously if you want to have fun as

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
You know in the Boy Scouts or something like that

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Just buy the damn manual

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Give it to your kid, have them read through it

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
That's all the information you need

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
The rest is just camping trips and pinewood car derby

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
That's all it really is

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
So about video games

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
That was awesome

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
I love how Dark Soccer is like

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
I swear to god I have news to report

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Will you boys stop reminiscing about your stupid scout troops?

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
We build wooden cars

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Just so you know

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Anyway hi

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
So for the Cub Scouts

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
There's a new

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
A new badge available

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Or sorry belt loop

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Or whatever the crap that means

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
You can get a video game

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Belt loop

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
I guess

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
I don't get a belt loop

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
I don't remember them having

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
I remember the badges

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
They actually could sew on and then there was the little

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Patches, there were patches and there were badges

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
So now they have belt loops too whatever

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
They get more bling

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
It was pins back in my day

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Yeah that's what I meant, pins

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
I remember they would flip the kid upside down

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
And put the pin on when the kid was upside down

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
And then like when you actually did

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Whatever your parents could turn it right

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Side up as if you weren't capable of just

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Doing it yourself but

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
If you did you'd go to hell

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
I remember that part

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
You actually need to watch the episode

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Of bullshit about scouting

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
You make John Smith cry

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
They took

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Anyway I'm gonna

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Can I tell you a true story? I'm sorry Dark Soccer

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
I know you have a legitimate gaming story here

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Hey guess what? What? My mother

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Carrot Pulled me out of Cub Scout

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
She didn't want me going anymore

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
You know why? True story

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
She didn't like the other kids in my troop

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
She thought all the other kids in my troop

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
And 10 years later

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
She told me this

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
All the other little kids in your troop

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Were little assholes

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
I love your mom

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
And I didn't want you hanging out with those assholes

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
I love your mom

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
So Rob

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
I'm not saying that you might be listening to the show

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
I'm just saying that

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
The Roseville troop was a bunch of assholes

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Allegedly

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
So the whole way to get

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
This video game belt loop

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
You have to complete three tasks

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
And I think this is actually a really positive thing

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Explain why it's important to have a rating system

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
For video games

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
With an adult's help

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Make a schedule to do things that include your

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
Chores, homework, video games

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
And you have to stick to schedule

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
And learn to play any video game that is approved

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
By your parent, guardian, or teacher

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
So I guess imagine babies might be on it or something

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
After you get the belt loop

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Um

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
You earn a pin by

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Completing five of nine tasks

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Which would be

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
With your parents create a plan to buy a video game

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
That is right for your age group

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
That's hard

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
Compare two game systems

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Explain the differences between the two

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
And good purchase

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Or use of a game system

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Play a video game with family members

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
In a family tournament

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Teach an adult or friend how to play a video game

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
List at least five tips that would help someone

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Who was learning how to play your favorite video game

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Play an appropriate video game

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
With a friend for one hour

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
So no imagine babies

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Play a video game that will help

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Practice math, spelling, or other skills

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
To help you in your school work

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Choose a game you might like to purchase

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
And compare the price at three different stores

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
To decide which one is the best deal

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Include

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Factors like return policy and warranty

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
And with an adult supervision

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Install a gaming system

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Um

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Okay

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
I think it's good because it's encouraging

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
You know, family time

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
It could be good for parents

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
To demystify

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Video games

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Yeah, it's not a bad thing

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
I know we're sitting here and tee-heeing about it

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
But it's encouraging

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
What should be happening in the first place

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Parents and kids to talk about

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
The kids hobby

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Who would have thought

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
When I was a kid, my papa and I

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
My dad's father

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
We used to sit around playing Jackal

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
On Nintendo

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
On the big screen TV

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Which is a war game where you shoot people

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
And run over them in a tank

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
And we played, get this

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Abadox

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Disgusting game at the time

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
I love Abadox for the record

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
I could imagine coming home from a Cub Scout meeting

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
And telling my mom

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Hey mom, uh

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
I want to get this video game badge that they're giving away

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
So would you sit for me for an hour

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
While I install a video game system

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
And show you how to do it? She'd just be like

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Where's the paper that I just signed?

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Hahahaha

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Well also, um

55:00.000 --> 55:06.000
There, um

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
I think that that kind of also

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
You know, sort of discounts

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
The fact that a lot of these parents might have grown up

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
With video games too

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
You know, my mom and I used to play

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Tetris together

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
And we used to play Super Mario Brothers

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
In all kinds of games and

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Okay

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Stop trying to smack the fly

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
With your pizza box

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
You're gonna fly on the loose in the studio

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Keep in mind

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
It flew outside, it flew outside

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Stay out

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
In two days it will be dead

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Not if I can help it

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
I'll take that long

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Flies really don't live longer than a few days

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
That's the comfort I take in that

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
They're going to die soon

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Tangent Lounge Radio, back to the Cub Scouts please

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
I have carrots

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
They're delicious and raw

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Cub Scouts!

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
They should program a game

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
I'm very disappointed, well that's a programming badge

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Um, I'm very disappointed though

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
That not one of those little

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
I guess, uh

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Achievements or requirements on that list

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Is go to arcade

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Well, cause there are no arcades

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
That's a myth

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
In some parts of the

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
States, there are no arcades

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Well then, you know what, you don't really want that badge now

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Do you?

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Here's the thing, the only problem

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
I don't want to even like open this door

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
And go there, but you know, I live there

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Uh, the only problem I have

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
With this badge, like I think it's a good thing

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
And it's encouraging the family to talk, yada yada yada

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Is that this badge could go right next to your

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Queer hating badge, because

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
You know, the Boy Scouts won't

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
You know the whole thing about how, you know

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
They won't let, um

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Gay guys be Scout Masters and so forth

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Because apparently

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
All gay guys know how to do

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Is molest kids

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
They won't let them be Scouts

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
At all

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
I think at that age, you're kind of too

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Young to know anyway, so I think

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
That arguments are relevant, like

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Honestly, like, you know, how

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Old are Boy Scouts, like 12 to like

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
15, like you just

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Here, everything

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Is, it's not even

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
An issue at that age, you know what I mean, if it is an issue

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
You're too young, just don't even

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Think about that stuff, but um

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
You know, it does kind of

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Irritate me that they don't really have

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
A good reason for

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Justifying why

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
I don't know why homos

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Will want to be involved with such an organization

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
That hates them, but if they do, they should

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
You know, get to do it. My problem is, why is this

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Even a badge in the first place, because I thought

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
The Boy Scouts and Cub Scouts and whatever

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Were all about, kind of like

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
The whole outdoors, you know

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
The Woodsmen, you know

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Type mentality, where it's like learning

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
How to kind of, not really necessarily

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Survive, but there are survival

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Tools in there as well, and

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
You know, kind of, you know, how to be

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Good, you know, participant

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
In your, you know

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Social circle or whatever

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
You know, being a good community member, I thought that was

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Really the values that they were

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
Trying to put forth, and this is kind of

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Unnecessary, because like, I mean seriously

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
They're gonna have a badge for learning how to use windows

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
You know, or, look, I installed

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
The Mac today, or you know, I've

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
I don't know

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
I learned how to program my VCR

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
My TiVo badge, you know, and seriously

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
It's not really necessary

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
It's kind of just

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Good that you know how to do that stuff

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
And good that you're spending time with your family

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
And that kind of thing, but

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
It doesn't need to be a badge

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
I think it's just being

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Used as a convenient tool

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
To teach economics

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Good shopping skills and family

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
I think it's just Boy Scouts trying to be hip

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
I think you're right

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Because maybe the

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Memberships are down or something

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
It's fine

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Question, or I'm sorry, comment

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
From the chatroom, chat.org.org.com

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Sharan in chat says, you don't need to be gay

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
To know how to molest children

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
No, you just have to know how to be a priest

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Ohhhhh, and if that joke offended

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
You, guess what, now you know how

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Offended I get when I hear

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
The rationalization for why gays

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Can't be in Boy Scouts, and there

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
You have it

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
See, I offended people but to teach a lesson

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Now you know how I feel

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Alright

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
It is offensive, moving on

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Release dates

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Let's go to the US and see what games

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Are gonna be coming out soon, Loki

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Not much, this week is pretty light

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
And it's sad that one of the biggest

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Games this week is actually

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Iron Man 2

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Of course, coming out on

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Friday in theaters

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
You gotta have your typical movie tying game

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
But don't worry, Sega says that this game

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Isn't crap like the last one

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
That's famous last

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Words from people that make crappy ported

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Or movie tying games

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Other fun

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Stuff coming out this week, Picross

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
3D

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Picross, but it's in 3D form

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
And you make nice little cube animals

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
The Total War

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Battle Pack, kind of a

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Pre-release of the Total War games

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Coming out on PC this week

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Fat Princess Fistful of Cake

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Making its way out on UMD

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
For the PSP, of course it's

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
I think already out on the PSP

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
In the PlayStation Network

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Dance Sensation

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Kind of

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Trying to take advantage of the adjust

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Dance craze, but

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Purely aimed at girls

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000
And Dementium 2

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Out on DS, this would be the perfect

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Game to purchase for that

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Cup Scout badge

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
And

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Also this week, the official

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Xbox 360

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
USB Flash Sticks

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
These are hilarious

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
And I'm laughing at the prices

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
An 8GB

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
USB flash drive will cost you

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
$39.99 and

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
A 16GB flash drive

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Will run you $69.99

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
I was just pricing these online

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Because I'm planning on picking up an 8GB

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
And guess what, you can get them for about half the price

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
So really, thank you Microsoft

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
For still overcharging

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
It's not gonna work as well with

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
A USB stick

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
And that's it for this week

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Let's head on over to Japan

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
And look at the Japanese releases

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
What's coming out on the Xbox 360

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
This week, really nothing, believe it or not

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Not really anything coming out at all

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
On the Xbox 360 this week

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Again, these are Japanese releases

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
And sometimes, you know, there's big variants

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
On the Playstation 3

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Also not a lot coming out this week

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
I don't know what, is there like a holiday or something

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Going on in Japan right now?

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Golden Week

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
It's a big

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
No, no, no

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
If I remember right, Golden Week

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Is when families go back to their hometowns

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
And

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
They visit with people, like everything's closed

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
I just know the 5th of May is Children's Day

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Oh, maybe that explains

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Where the holiday comes from in WoW

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Because it's Children's Week in WoW right now

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Yeah, I totally just made a Warcraft reference

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Hey, Nintendo Wii, also nothing

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
This week, really, no releases till the 13th of May

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Playstation 2

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Nothing, DS, nothing

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
PSP, nothing

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Nothing is coming out in Japan until the 13th

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Okay, by the way, I found it

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
What's that?

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
It's a paid time off

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
On the work days

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Some companies completely close down and give their employees

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Time off, it's the longest vacation

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Period of the year for many Japanese jobs

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
So, yeah

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Wish we had that over here

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
I know, I want Golden Week, how about Golden Arches Week

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
We have FIFA World Cup

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Soccer to look forward to when Golden Week's

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Over, that's going to be a big release on the 13th

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
It's because there's

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Holidays during

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
That period of time

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Well, we get Cinco de Mayo over here

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
We don't get it off, do we?

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Yay

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Really, I don't think Cinco de Mayo is really

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Actually an American holiday anyway

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
It's just one we kind of borrowed

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
From our neighbors to have an excuse to drink

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Mexican food potluck day

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Exactly

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
As if work needed another excuse to have a potluck

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Alright

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Let's move on

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Okay, is there any holidays in the UK

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Stopping video games this week?

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Uh, no. I don't think so

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Why don't they celebrate Cinco de Mayo?

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Runaway 3

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
For DS

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Runaway A Twisted Fate for PC

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
On the 7th, by the way

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Sin and Punishment 2 for Wii

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
And What Did I Do to Deserve This, My Lord?

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Dude, that's awesome that they're getting Sin and Punishment 2

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Seeing as ours has been delayed

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Yeah

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
On PSP and that's really it

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Alright

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
A few more gaming stories for you guys

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
And then the classic game of the week

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Where Dark Soccer is gonna dig through the vaults

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
And believe me, kids, she's diggin' this week

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Loki

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
You may remember that Microsoft

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Sue Datel over their unofficial

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Max memory

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Memory cards that they had out

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Because they took

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Little micro SD cards and allowed you to use them

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
On the

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Xbox 360

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Which now that I think of it, it's kind of funny

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Because, um

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
They actually

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Now that they've opened that up

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
You don't really need these memory cards

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Talk about, uh

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Sucking

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Anyways, so

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
To kind of respond to

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Datel's request

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
They filed an antitrust

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Lawsuit against Microsoft

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Pissed off that they weren't

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Kind of playing on even

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Playing ground here

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
And, um

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Yeah, I kind of remember this whole

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Back and forth from a couple weeks ago, yeah

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Yeah, they're basically saying, um

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
That the

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Claims that by

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Datel

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
That they locked them out with a firmware update

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
And Microsoft has used its

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Status as a platform holder to

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Unlawfully prevent competition

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Which, I can see that

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Because there's a lot of

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
You know, um

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
A lot of first party, you know, products out there

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
But there's a lot of stuff that, you know, you have to get

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Approval from Microsoft to build the release

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Items for those systems

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
And I think that pretty much goes with any other system

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
But, seeing as the Wii

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
And, um, the

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
PlayStation 3 used kind of open

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Storage formats, you know

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
The SD memory cards and USB

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Memory sticks and stuff like that

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Now Microsoft, um

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
You can see how that would be a problem

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Since they were

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Prior to the last firmware update

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Only allowed to use

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Either the hard drive or a

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
A memory stick

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Memory unit from Microsoft

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
They're saying

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Microsoft's motion to dismiss

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Because they tried to dismiss it, it claimed that

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
The language in the additional terms and conditions

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Clause of the Xbox 360

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Product warranty, because everybody reads

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
That, um, barred the

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Use of unauthorized peripherals

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
And the company, uh

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Backed up its case by citing

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Apple's, I guess, successful defense

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Of its right to limit the use of

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
OS X to its own hardware

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
And the court rejected

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Microsoft's motion to have

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
It dismissed, so it will

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Apparently go to trial

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Although, at this point

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
It's like, well

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
That's great and all, but

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
In the meantime, I'll just pop

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
In my USB memory stick

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
To, uh, save my games now

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
So that's gonna be kinda hard

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
To, uh, make the case

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Now

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Hmm

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Well, I mean

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Do you think there are, this is gonna be

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
One of those cases that gets dragged out

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
For years and years, or is it gonna get settled pretty

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Quickly? What do you think?

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Put on your legal expert

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Hat

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I think it probably gets

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Probably gets settled, because

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
You know, really, yeah, it sucks that they

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Made these devices, and

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
They got pulled from the market really

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Quick. My thing is, though

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Uh

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
It's gonna be difficult

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Now to show any damages

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Because

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
They weren't out that long, and

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Now there are other options

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Other than the memory units. In fact, they're not even

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Making the memory units anymore

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Um

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
So

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
I don't know, it's

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
It's hard, like, if they were

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Yeah, they're not making them, because

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Yeah, well they're not making them now, but if

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
If they were, like, to say, completely ignore

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
The time when they had just the memory units

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Now that argument doesn't really hold

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Um, but of course, you know

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
This took place before that update

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
But it almost makes you wonder if that update was

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Partially in response to this

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
But, who knows

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
It just sucks for them, but

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
That's an interesting thought, because it did seem like that USB

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Thing came out of nowhere, didn't it? I think they were

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Worried that there was gonna be

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Some sort of, uh, because

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
With this, you'll be able to

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Access your files on your memory

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Cards or whatever

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
And you might be able to cheat or something

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Like, you know, edit your save games or something

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Which, I can tell you right now, that wouldn't have

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Stopped them, because it's very

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Easy to do that if you have the right tools

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Even easier now that they have USB support

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
It's like

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
A program in hex editing

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Alright, we're gonna go ahead and move on

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
We got one more story for you guys

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Before we get to the classic game of the week

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
And that story has to do with something

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
We sort of talked about last week

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Don't know if you heard, but apparently

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
A leaked GameStop ad

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Has revealed that a black Wii bundle

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Is on its way

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Who would have thought? I had never

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Heard about this

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Yes, this black Wii will contain a Wiimote

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
And MotionPlus, and Wii Sports, Wii Sports

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Resorts, all for $200

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
However, it's supposed to be coming out

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
May 4th, which differs from an earlier

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Report, but the interesting thing is that

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
I'm sorry, the

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Ad is not supposed to go up until May 4th

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
But it got leaked, the debut of this system

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
I'm sorry, is May 9th

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Which differs from the earlier report

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Canada's supposed to get it on May 23rd

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Which is interesting because May 23rd is the

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Date that had originally been reported

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
And my source was not Canadian, thank you very much

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
So don't know what happened there

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
But could also be that

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
More is to come because Nintendo

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Has yet to make any official announcement

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
You have to keep in mind, all of this is

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Still rumor, it's just that now instead of

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Some schmo on an internet radio show saying something

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Now there's a picture to prove it

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
It's coming, whereas everybody outside of the

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
US is rolling their eyes and saying move on

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
With it, we already have the black Wii here

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Well, it's news here

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Anyhow, Nintendo is

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Pissed

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
They commented actually on what's

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Going on here, well no, they didn't comment

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
They made threats which caused

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
GameStop to comment

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Here's an email

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
I love this because this whole email

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Is about stop leaking stuff

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
And then the email gets leaked

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
That's my favorite, so here it is, here's the email

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Let me read the email that went out to all the stores

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
As you know

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
There is a lot of rumor and speculation about various

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
New products and titles launching this year

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
One of these is the black Wii

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Various blogs and internet sites

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Are raising awareness about this product

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
GameStop stores and associates should not

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Proliferate these rumors

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Today you received pop, I guess that's what

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
POP, what is that?

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Point of purchase advertising

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Whatever

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
For your windows regarding the black Wii

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Somehow a picture of this appeared on the internet

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Somebody snapped it with her camera phone

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
It's not that hard to figure out

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
It may seem cool to be in the know

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
And feel compelled to share something like this

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Nothing can be further from the truth

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
All activity like this does is hurt our reputation

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
With publishers and manufacturers

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
And potentially hurts our company

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Until Nintendo decides to announce their product

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
There was capitalized, that's why I shouted it

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
There should be no discussion of it with customers

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Period

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
If they ask, it's not appropriate to comment on

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Speculation and rumor should be the answer

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
That's dumb

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
So in other words you should just confirm it

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Just say I don't know

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Here's an excuse that people will believe

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
I work at a game store, I don't know

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Don't believe that

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Anyway, the POP should be secured

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
In the back room and left there until further notice

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Any violation of these will be treated

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
With the most aggressive consequences

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
I believe strongly in the field organization

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
But I am as disappointed as I have been

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
In my tenure here and how we are handling this

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
I am trusting that your professionalism

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Will result in no further issues

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
I got two words for you, BITCH

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
PLEASE

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Well here's the funny thing about it

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
If you didn't want news

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
On this to get out until May 4th

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Then maybe you should have sent out the materials

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
I don't know, May 2nd?

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
I mean come on, if you're gonna pay these guys

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Next to nothing

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
And let's face it, these employees at GameStop

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Don't make enough money to shut up

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Right?

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
I mean

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
You shouldn't be telling the whole world

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
That the Black Week is coming out if you don't want people to say

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
And I love how they put, oh it hurts

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Our relationship with Nintendo

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Yeah I'm sure Nintendo's gonna go

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Oh we're not gonna ship product to our largest

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Partner

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Actually Loki, they did make that threat

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Apparently that is the rumor going around

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Nintendo did make the threat to pull all of its

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Products from GameStop stories

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
You know what I have to say to Nintendo over that?

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
BITCH PLEASE

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
It would never happen

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Never happen

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
What other game stores are there?

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
I mean

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
I mean

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
You're gonna just rely on Walmart

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
And Target and all that for your sales

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
I mean come on

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
That is an empty threat

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
If I've ever heard one

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Maybe they'll send us a decent quantity of product then

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Cause we service all the independent guys

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
And they seem to fuck us over all the time

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
I would love to see

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
The big gorilla in the corner

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
GameStop get fucked over once

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Or twice

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Yeah you're kinda sitting there going

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Leak more, leak more, hee hee hee

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
It's not gonna do anything

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
GameStops leak information all the time

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Not only do you leak information all the time

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
I'm sure that they're the source

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Of a lot of the leaked games

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
That appear on the internet as well

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
So

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Oh well

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Things get leaked

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Trust no one

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
God look at the music industry

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
I mean stuff

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
I mean CDs get leaked

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Weeks before their release date on the internet

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
And you know what they say about

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
When something hits the internet, it's done

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Everybody's got it now

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Once it's been put on the internet

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
It is not coming off

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Period

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Anyhow

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
So yeah the black Wii is coming, big surprise

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Five minutes of fame and an eternity on the internet

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Well here's the thing, the only reason why

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
They probably didn't want it leaked

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
For the stupid reason anyways is

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
That's gonna hurt the sales of the Wii right now

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Because people are like why the fuck am I gonna

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Pay $1.99 for the Wii

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
When I can get the Wii with Wii Sports Resort

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
You know for the same price

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
But, but, but, but, but retailers

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Are already doing that

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
We had a story a couple weeks ago about Walmart

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Was already selling this as a bundle and I believe

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Yeah they already have it

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
What's Nintendo's problem?

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Bitch please

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
I don't know

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
All I can say is

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
That my Wii's been gathering dust for

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Five months

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
I would love to see that meeting

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Where somebody at GameStop says that to Reggie

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Fils-Aime's face, bitch please

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
I still wanna borrow your Wii Fit

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Maybe I wanna use it

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
If you're not using it

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Yeah sure

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Okay thank you

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Anyhow let's move on

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Spyro in chat says wait it's already here

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Yeah that's my other thing is that like

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
In all the rest of the world

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Like the UK and what doesn't even Canada

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Have the Black Wii at this no no

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Cause it's supposed to come out May 23rd

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Pretty much everywhere but the US and Canada

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Has already had the Black Wii

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
They'll announce it like tomorrow okay

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
I mean they're gonna make the announcement soon

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
It's retarded that they're not

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Maybe on the 4th I don't know why they wait till Tuesday

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
But it's just gonna be an announcement

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
And whoopty shit

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Okay seriously

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Really a color change that's really

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Gonna get people to buy the Wii

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
That didn't before I would buy it

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
But if only it were black

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Going to comments from our chat room

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
ActDeaf says to Nintendo, you mad?

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Rama says

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Is that sky getting sassy?

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Mhmm

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Frisbee says Nintendo

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
And Tigerclaw says

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
A Black Wii would be nice but it's not gonna

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Hide all the dust it will collect turning it into a

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
White Wii ha should be more of like a

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Grayish Wii but I get your point that's true

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
It's gonna be like the PS3's

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Little dust magnets

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Good times good times

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Hey it's that part of the show where we're going

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
To speaking of dusty things we're gonna jump

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Into Dark Sakura's vault

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
And pull out a video game

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
It's a classic

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
It's time to bring a game up from the

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Vault of History and deem it as a

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
True classic that you kids need

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
To respect and adore and play some of

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
This week it's Dark Sakura's classic

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Game of the week

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Dark Sakura what game did you pick for us this week?

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
I picked a sequel

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Rob

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
I picked Dodonpachi

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Dodonpachi can't say I've

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Heard of this game let's check it out what's Dodonpachi

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
You haven't heard of Dodonpachi?

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
I don't think so

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
We're like one of the classic cave shooters

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
As in the company that gave us

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Es-ba-ba-ba-ba-luga whale

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
I'm sorry Es-ba-galuda

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
But I didn't play all of their games

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Was this released in the US?

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
What system was this on?

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
I played Dodonpachi in the arcade

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
It was

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Published by Atlas

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
But yeah

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
For systems it came out on

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Let's see

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
I'm trying to remember

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
I think there was

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Wasn't there

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
I don't remember if it was arcade only

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
It couldn't have been arcade only

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Because I know that this

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
And I think that

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Dodonpachi

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Came out in the arcade

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Only

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Because I really don't remember

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Playing this at home I've just had

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Main ROMs

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
It was also on the Saturn

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
And the original Playstation

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Now that I think about it

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
I think it's the Saturn version

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
I've never heard the easy web

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
I don't know what that is

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Anyway

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
The original Dodonpachi

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Was sort of like an 8 year training mission

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Where you shoot all your friends to death

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
And then

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
There's another twist in this one

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
But I'm not going to really get much into it

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
But you have different fighters

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
You have your type A

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Which is a narrow stream of shots

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
You have B

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Which is a helicopter that has

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Guns forward and side guns

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
And then type C

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
You've got different guns

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Lasers, bombs, all kinds of different stuff

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Different power ups

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
You get shot mode and laser mode

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Different collectible items where you can get

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Power to increase your

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Guns and lasers

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Bombs where you get more bombs

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
MP

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Appears when you've lost all your lives

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
So when you continue you can pick that up

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
And you start back at full strength

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Which is also in Espegaluda

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
And in

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Another game

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
That's supposed to be even harder

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Than that

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
I set a link aside

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
To get the name of it

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
You also

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Now this is something else that

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Totally incorporated into

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Espegaluda

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Later on is that you can get

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Stars

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
For

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Killing

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
A boss

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
An end boss

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
And their bullets are converted into stars

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
And you get 100 points

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
And then you get a giant star when you get 10,000 points

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
For a multi-part boss

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
And then

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
A pentagon

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
That gives you 300 points

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
But you only find them on the ground

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
And by the way the other game

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
That I am thinking of

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Is

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Mushihime Sama

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Which is

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Like bullet hell

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Just watch the last boss

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
For that if you want your brain to explode

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
It's really freaking difficult

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
But I like my brain

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
You've also got a maximum

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Mode in this

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Where if you

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Trigger a bomb when all of your bomb slots

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Are full and then your

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Score increases

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
By 220 points

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Per 1 60th of a second

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Yeah

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
And so you start off with a 2 multiplier

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
And you increase by 1 for every successive

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Bomb collected in maximum mode

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
So it's pretty crazy

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
And you also have a get point system

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Where you have a combo gauge

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
And you get

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Increased number of points

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
From enemies larger hit counts

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
It's pretty complex

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
It's got other stuff so you've got different

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Areas in the game

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
But area 7

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
You can only get to

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
By entering the second loop

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Which is done by

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Completing the first 6 areas on

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
1 credit

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
And doing any of these

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Following requirements where you lose

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
2 lives

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Or depending on which one you lose

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
For type A you have to have a maximum

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Hit count of 270 hits

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Type B 300 and type C 330

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Or score at least 50 million points

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
At the end of area 6

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Or collect all 13 B's

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
For 4 of the 6 areas

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
And the second loop has

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
The same areas

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Same bosses

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
But you have many many many more bullets

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
And giant mechanical B's

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Different

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
And then you get the actual

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Real boss of the game

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
You've got different bonuses

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
So you get stuff for

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Pentagon's getting the stars

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Boss hits

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
No miss

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
In the second loop you get

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
10 million points for each

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Reserve fighter

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
So you've got different endings too

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
If you don't get the

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Second loop access

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
You're congratulated by the DonPachi Corps

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
For being brave

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
If you get everything

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
The mechanized aliens

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Are your own comrades

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Although

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
The

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
International release says it's a lost fleet

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
But

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
They're actually trying to stop

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
You

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
So

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Once everything is done

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
They're all ordered

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
To kill you

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
And that's when you start the second loop

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
So going through it again

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
The whole point of DonPachi

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Is to annihilate all the human

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Beings in the world

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Awesome

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Pretty pretty crazy huh?

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Yeah I'm looking at the screens of this

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
It's definitely bullet hell

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
God there's so many of these games

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
That's not even bad Rob

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
That is not even bad

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
It just goes to show I suck at these games

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Because I would fail at this so miserably

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
I've been bouncing from YouTube to YouTube

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
This is like stage 2-3 I think

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
And yeah I would not beat this

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Rob you need to find

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
The final boss

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
I believe SSJ100Matt actually linked that

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
In our chat room

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
It's very resourceful

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Here it is the hardest video game boss ever

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Let me fast forward a little bit here

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
This is nuts you don't need to fast forward all that much

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
It starts off hard

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Isn't that gorgeous?

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
This is ridiculous

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
This is just retarded stupid

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
There's a video up of a person

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
No missing on it not getting hit

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
And keep in mind

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
The final boss in Escaluda on iPhone

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Releases

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Not quite as many bullets

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
The way these games work you can only get hit

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
In that little glowing spot right there

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
That's it

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
That's bullet hell

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Ridiculous

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
And I like that it talks to you the whole time

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Just like it does in Escaluda

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Sorry

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
But yeah

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Cave is evil

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
For throwing bullets up our noses

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
So yeah there was

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
A special version

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
The campaign version or DDP Blue Rom

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
That has

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
A very limited print

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Of the game that was given to winners

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
At a Dodonpachi contest

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
That Cave had

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
It has

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
The same game it's harder and has a hyper mode

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
In it which

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Actually shows up later in Dodonpachi

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Dialjo

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
A blue title screen

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Very very hard to get

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
And actually

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
One

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
There's actually two

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
That have confirmed to exist

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
That one of them belongs to

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
The

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Current world holder for Dodonpachi

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
So

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
But yeah

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
There were of course

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
The other versions too

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Like the Saturn and

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
PlayStation

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
I was trying to remember if it was Dodonpachi or Dodonpachi

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
And that game

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
I've only ever really played it in the arcade

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Although I think I have it on Saturn

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
In one of my collections somewhere

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
But yeah, pretty crazy

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
And for the record

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
You want to play 2D games on the Saturn

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
They look better

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Alright, there it is your classic video game of the week

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Dodonpachi

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Going to comments from our chat room

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Shao Ran says

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Bullet hell is all about patterns

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Beauty, thought, and bullet hell

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
As there are no things superior to beauty and thought

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Kevin DDR says

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Sky 2-3 means

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
It's the second loop

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
You have to beat the game with certain conditions to even get to that

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Well, that ain't happening

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
I'll tell you that

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
And then Shao Ran follows up and says

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Yeah, once you get grazing down, bullet hell games aren't that hard

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
It's just about memorization

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Just like any other old Japanese game

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Frisbee says

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Bullet hell is almost like a maze game

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
I guess I can see that

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Just interesting

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Alright, I'm just not very good at those games

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Like, the last bullet hell game I played

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Was the You Will Die

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Which was by one of the other all games hosts

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Making his own game on XNA

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
And I suck at it

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Alright

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Let's go do our break

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
We're going to take a quick break, we'll be right back

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
There's plenty more to come tonight

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Listless, speaking of friends on all games

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
One of our podcasting buddies is going to join us

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
For Listless later

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
There was huge news out of Bungie this week

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
We're going to talk about that in the next segment

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Final Fantasy 5 and Final Fantasy 6 remakes

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Possibly, maybe

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
We'll see after a quick break

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
So stay tuned, don't go anywhere

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Hello everybody and welcome back to another episode

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
It's part B of our show

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Already in progress

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
On May 2nd of 2010

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
We have plenty more gaming news

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
To get to this hour

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
And Listless tonight

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
And I'll tell you the topic right now

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
What we're going to be doing tonight

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
What Capcom versus series should they do next

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Or maybe I should actually say

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Versus Capcom would be correct

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Because you know, you've had Tatsunoko versus Capcom

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Marvel versus Capcom

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
What should they do next

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
We're going to find out with the definitive list

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
In a few more minutes here at Orange Lounge Radio

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
But first we have some rapid quick

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
News, there's so much to talk about this week

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
We don't have time to talk about everything

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
But we can at least give some shout outs

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
To some other gaming news highlights this week

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
And as somebody in chat points out

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
I should say this real quick

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
ActDeaf says it's episode live 365

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Because this is episode 365 of our show

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Do not speak that name ever again

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Just kidding

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Remember we went to the live 365 awards

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Good times, good times

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
We went twice

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
What? Hey what?

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
That's what I did during the live 365 awards

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Oh yeah, when they, oh god

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
How could I forget when they forgot our name

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
When they were going over, yeah we got nominated

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
One year for live 365 station

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Of the year, like that's a pretty big honor

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Because there was what, like 11,000 stations on live 365

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
We were one of the five nominated

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
For station of the year, and when what's-her-name

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Betty whatever was reading the

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Nominees, she forgot OLR

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
And you just hear, and god

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
I wish I could find that recording, I think it's long

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Gone in the recycle bin or whatever

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
But somebody actually had a recording

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Because they played the award show live

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
And a bunch of our listeners were listening

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
And you could hear Loki in the background

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
She goes, we have all, or she goes

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
And the nominees are

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Rockland, da da da, and whatever stations

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
And she goes, and the winner is, and you hear in the background

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Hey!

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
No, it was funny, it was

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Most unlikely to be on radio or something

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Like that, and they had like an 80's station

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Because you don't ever hear 80's

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Stations on the radio

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Ever. That's where we lost to the station that plays

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Nothing but porn music all day long

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Got nominated three

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Years in a row for those fuckers, never won

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
One, oh well, thanks for trying

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
I got speakers. That's right, you won some type of like

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Playing bingo. Bingo thing or something stupid

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Alright, so yeah

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
That was good times, so

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
I really wish I had a recording of that

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
With Loki in the background, hey!

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
And then she goes, oh, oh yeah, yeah, and on orange

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Orange, orange, orange, and we just gave each other

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
That look of, well, we didn't win

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
I'm outta here

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Drove all this way for this

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
And then they drove up their fees

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
By like 300% and we

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Got the fuck out, and now we're here at All Games

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
You know what, it worked out for the better, because coming over to

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
All Games, I think got us new listeners

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Because, you know, we had

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Kind of a cultish audience

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
And Scott Rubin and Bobby Blackwolf

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
And all the people at All Games had a bit of a cultish

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Audience, so when we married these

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Cults together, it was a good thing

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
It was a super cult

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Yes, it was a super cult, uber cult

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
So thanks to all you little cultists

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
For sticking with us

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Over the years, alright, back to some gaming news

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Loki

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Yes, so real quick, if you wanna be

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Iron Man on Playstation

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Home, it'll be a lot easier than having to

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Steal a suit from Stark Enterprises

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Yes, you can actually play, they have a little

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Game where you can fly around

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
As Iron Man

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
And apparently it

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Debuted earlier last week

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
On Thursday

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Apparently

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
It was part of the Out

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
I'm surprised that they actually have

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
A space, but

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Audi, I guess, has a space there

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
And they're teaming up with Paramount for that

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
No actual Iron Man themed space

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
I mean, it sort of is, but it's part of

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Audi's

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
And then I guess, oh

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
That's funny

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Unfortunately though, it is exclusive to the

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
European Playstation Network, so

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
That sucks for most of

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Our listeners

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
This is kind of cool

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Someone made a Flash game

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
That kind of crosses a bunch of

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Different 8-bit game

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Heroes with Super Mario Brothers

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
And it's called Super Mario Crossover

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
And it features such

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Playable characters as, of course you can play as Mario

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Why would you want to

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Link, Mega Man, Samus,

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Simon Belmont, and Bill from

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Contra

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
And that is awesome

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
And I'll be playing that later instead of the

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Unicorn game

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
And then finally, APB

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Has been slated to be coming out now

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
On June 29th

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
And they also kind of talked a little bit about

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
How their pricing structure is going to go

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
As well, it's really cool

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
I like the way that they're doing it, I mean

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
I think it's going to be pretty sweet

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Instead of paying a monthly fee

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
As you would with most MMOs, you pay for time

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
So for example, when you buy the game

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
You get 50 hours

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
And how you use that

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Is up to you, if you play a lot

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Great, if you don't play a lot

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
No big deal

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
And once those are up, you have the option to purchase

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
20 more hours for $7

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Or you can do 30 days of unlimited access

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
For $10, or

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
90 days, or 180 day passes

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
As well, and they haven't given the prices on those

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
In addition to extra playtime

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Oh, in addition, extra playtime

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Can be earned through different accomplishments

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
In the game

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
So that's pretty awesome, and I have to say

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
You know, I don't really hop on the

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
MMO bandwagon

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Because I don't have time to play games, but

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
If it's as a pain as I go

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
I'm interested

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Definitely, especially since the game looks like

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Grand Theft Auto, so

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
I'm all over that, and it's

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
And it's real time worlds, man

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
It's a crackdown, and I really am sad that they didn't

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Do the second crackdown

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Thank god, WoW doesn't charge by the hour

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
I'd be in debt

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Well, I mean, they do have that option

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Though, where you can buy unlimited access

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
For 30 days for $10

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Which is still cheaper than WoW

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
So, it's not bad

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Alright, well, here's a game that I think

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Loki might be interested in, I think Dark Soccer

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
I don't know why, this seems like a Dark Soccer kind of game, too

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
THQ and Syfy

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
The TV network are getting together to make

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
A new game

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Sadly, it's not a Caprica game, but what it is

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
It's a Ghost Hunters Academy game

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Here's the problem I have with that

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
It's Ghost Hunters Academy, and they've done so many spinoffs

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Of the Ghost Hunters show

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
It's retarded now

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
And they've become, they've sold out

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Okay, they've sold out

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
And then jumped the shark

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Bought a shark to jump over, I guess

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Well, if you want to jump the shark with them

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Ghost Hunters Academy is coming out for the iPhone and iPad, of course

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
And the DS

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Is the game you get to try out

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
To be on the team

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
If you want to be a ghost hunter

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Who wants to be a ghost hunter?

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
That's what the game's about

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Just saying

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
By the way, no details about actual gameplay

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Hopefully it plays like Ghostbusters

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
The old school game that was on

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Commodore and NES

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Don't cross the streams, Marshmallow Man, etc

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Also, apparently

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
There's stuff afoot in the Mega Man universe

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
No surprise there

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Mega Man's been having a little bit of a renaissance

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Thanks to Mega Man 9 and Mega Man 10

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Apparently there is a Mega Man universe

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
We talked about this before

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
But now we might know what this is actually connected to

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Apparently

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
There was a little tease dropped in another podcast

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Called Bit Transmission

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
And Seth Killen

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Was the guest from Capcom

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
He said that Mega Man still has some surprises in store

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
For everybody

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Quote, it's good, I don't want to say nobody has seen it coming

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Somebody may have seen it coming

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
But it excited me and when I heard about the project

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
I was like, holy crap, that's rad

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
I actually haven't seen anything that's going on with the project right now

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
But the idea was exciting

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
This is still kicking around as a concept

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
But there are exciting ideas in the Mega Man space

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
It's a six player co-op

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Xbox Live

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
2D game

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
And this week they're gonna be like

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Shit, someone beat us to it

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Damn it

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
MU Konami

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
We all know it would be Konami copying them

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Oh, I went there

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Hey look, no seriously, think about it

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
I don't want to say nobody has seen it coming

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
So here's my thought

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
And especially if the game is called Mega Man Universe

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Is this finally

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
That game

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Oh yes, that Mega Man game

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
With all

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Of the robot bosses in it

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
At once

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
That'd be awesome

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
That would be so fucking awesome

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.000
That's more awesome than I think I can handle

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
I might just explode

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
We'll see

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Meanwhile, this is also awesome and I didn't realize that

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
By the way, Dark Tetsuya

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Oh, thanks to the lag

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
I just beat him to it

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
But he just said in chat

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
I'm calling it now, Mega Man Battle Royale

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
With all the bosses

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
I called it 30 seconds ago

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Anyway, speaking of games

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
That sound really awesome

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
I'm going to pass out from how awesome it is

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
ModNation Racers is on its way out

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
I never did play the beta, so I don't know if it's actually that good

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
I got in the beta and never played it

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
You dumbass

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
I would have played it, I didn't get in the beta

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
I didn't try hard enough

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
I didn't realize the beta was coming out so soon

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
It's coming out at the end of May

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
There was a commercial for it on TV the other day

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
I'm seeing more and more Playstation commercials on TV

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
What's up with that?

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Of course I've been watching more South Park

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Maybe it's related, I don't know

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Anyhow, in ModNation Racers

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
You will be able to play as Sackboy

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Will be one of the racers in ModNation Racers

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
And if this surprises you

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
I don't know what rock you've been living under

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Because this series has been getting all of these

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Transplants from other Sony franchises

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
So this is kind of a duh

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
We don't know if it's part of a pre-order bonus or what

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
But probably it is

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
So there you go, there's a little teaser out there featuring Sackboy

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
And all that fun stuff

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Dark Soccer, what you got for us?

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
I have some stuff, Rob

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Which is as cool as every freaking Mega Man boss at once

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Sims 3

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Is coming to Playstation 3, Xbox 360

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Wii, and DS this fall

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
EA is working on console versions

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
And should have different features

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Like karma power

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Depending on whether you can get lucky

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Or have Epic fail

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Yeah

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Which actually still reminds me that I need to completely

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Uninstall all my Sims 3 stuff

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
What?

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
I just spilled water all over myself

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
You're a big boy, Rob

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
I need a sippy cup

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
I could go get you one

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
He's getting wet over that news

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Literally, I just got wet over the Mega Man news

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
I'll be right back, I need a towel

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Okay

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
So also though, coming up for Rock Band

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
We have new download content

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
We have No Doubt Tragic Kingdom

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
To download

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Which are

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Basically all

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
We have the songs on there

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Including different people

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
And ended on this

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Happy now see you then 16

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
The climb tragic kingdom world go round

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
And you can do it

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
And then individual songs is

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Orient the according to you and picture me broken

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Dearest I'm so sorry

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
And then

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
We also have our UK

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Download games

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Just to mention what's coming out

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
We have Hamster Ball

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
For Playstation 3

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Yeah, Hamster Ball

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Which looks kind of Monkey Ball

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Like to me

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
And then

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Alpha Bounce

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
For DSiWare

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
500 points

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Which just looks like a glorified

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Arcanoid to me

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
The Will of Dr. Frankenstein

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
For WiiWare

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
And

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
It looks very Nintendo 64-ish

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
And

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
It's actually a cut down version

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Of the island of Dr. Frankenstein

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
And then

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
We've got a few others

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
There's Earthworm Jim for DSiWare

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
500 points

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Um, which you know

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Freaking Earthworm Jim, so hey

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
I loved Earthworm Jim, it was cute

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
I loved how the titles, credits would burp

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Sound like me earlier in the show tonight

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
We have Lead and Gold Gangs of the Wild

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
West, which is for Playstation Network

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
And Steam

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
That would do it

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Alright, let's get into some Twitter topics

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Every week we solicit your tweets

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
At Twitter.com slash OLR

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
And we like to pick some of our favorite tweets

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
And read them here on the show

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
So let's get into the tweets

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
I gotta admit, they're not always on topic

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
You guys, but uh

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Whatever, we're flexible

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Uh, let's see

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Souture in Twitter

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Says, uh, what I've been playing

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Harvest Moon, hero of Leaf Valley

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Fun, but frequent, those short

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Loading screens. What do you think of Harvest Moon?

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
I tried to get into that series

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
On the GameCube, I think there was a game on the GameCube

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
I couldn't really get into it, I don't know

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Like, I was just more into Animal Crossing

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
I wasn't, maybe it was too much

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Fun with Cows!

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Maybe it was too much micromanaging for me

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
I think it's one of those games I really need to give another shot

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Like, I don't think I gave it a fair shot, to be honest

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Fun with Cows!

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
No, you know, Jessica played it a whole bunch

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
When I would hangover

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
And I was just like, look, my cow loves me!

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Okay

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
You know, Harvest Moon kind of strikes me as like a Facebook game

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Like, I'm kind of surprised it's not on Facebook

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Uh, I'm surprised

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Especially with the success of what, uh, Farmville

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Farmville? Like, seriously

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Why are they not suing over this?

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
I don't know

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Uh, let's see, more tweets

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
TheShadowSniper tweets us

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
OLR, you guys are awesome!

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Do you agree?

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
No. Most days

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
I'm awesome every day, Rob

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Uh, KnightsOfBlaze says

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Here's Twitter topic for tonight

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Blur or SplitSecond, which will be better?

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
SplitSecond

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Tough. I haven't played the SplitSecond demo yet

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
SplitSecond looks awesome

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Blur, I think, would be fun

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Because people like playing online

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
But I don't really give a crap about online

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
So I'm all about SplitSecond

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Plus, they have that new survival mode now

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Which looks all sorts of awesome

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
So, that'd be the first game I'm gonna play

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
They may check out Blur later on

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
But both of them to me win the I don't care rating

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
They both look awesome to me

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
But I'm gonna say Blur just because it's the one

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Loki didn't pick

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
So now it's officially a tie

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
I'll let Dan get whatever he wants to and then I'll go

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Oh, that's neat

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
One for Blur, one for SplitSecond, one for I don't give a fuck

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
I mean, you have like

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
You have a game that looks like Burnout with explosions

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Or you have, you know, Mario Kart meets

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Project Gotham

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
It's tough

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Both games look good actually

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
But we'll see, you know, a lot of it has to do with the controls too

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Keep that in mind

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
So we'll see how they control

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Blur controls pretty good, I'll check out SplitSecond soon

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
But I remember playing it at E3 last year and it was pretty cool

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
I wonder if they'll have the same damn demo this year

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Oh no, the game will be out by E3 this year

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Game's out pretty soon

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Tigerclaw sends us a couple stories

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
I'll go ahead and read this one here

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Because the other one I think Bobby got on his show

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
So let's talk about this one here

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Um

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Oh, I love this

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
This is so appropriate what Tigerclaw sent us

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Apparently a couple of game testers

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
At Activision as identified

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
By one of the vending machines in the background

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
They had a speed eating competition

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Of the KFC Double Down

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Polishing it off in

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
57.97 seconds

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
That's just under a minute

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Apparently it was sent

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
In some type of video over to Kotaku

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Not yet verified by Twin Galaxies

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
LOL, so there it is

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
You can actually see the guys eating the Double Down

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
And um

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
These little bastards are skinny

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
That's what I don't like, like if I ate that Double Down

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
In 60 seconds, I would gain weight

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
These little bastards are still skinny

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
You guys can go to hell

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Alright, uh

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
I'm just jealous

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Let's see, um

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Sponstwang says, can anyone make me

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Anything OLR slash gamer

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Related I can wear on my 5K race

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
In a couple of weeks

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
I'm already going to wear a Pokewalker

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
I don't know, Dark Soccer is the

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Seamstress of the bunch

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
I can

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Make you a keychain

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
I don't know if Misty

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Is still in the business of making

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
OLR keychains and stuff

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
But you might want to try talking to Misty

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
Because I know she used to have some of that stuff

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Like, you know, beaderies and necklaces

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
And things like that

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Yeah, I've been talking about that for years

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Nothing yet, nothing yet, maybe soon

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Uh, let's see

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
DarkTetsuya wanted to give a big fat plug

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
To his new series on our website

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
I, uh, love this

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
New series that he came up with

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
I think it's a great addition to our website

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
It's called A Look Back

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
We kind of need to give it a better name though

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
A Look Back, I mean, don't get me wrong

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
The name suffices for what it is, it is a look back

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
But we need something a little more hardcore

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Than a look back

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
You can look back, bitches

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Maybe not

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
But anyway, regardless of what it's called

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
The system is really good

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
It's A Look Back, the MSX is the first in the series

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
And he talks about what the MSX was all about

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Because, um, it's, uh

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Cool because the MSX is a

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Console we didn't get here

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
And so you can read a little more about it

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
So, that's kind of nice

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
BlackWolf suggests rear view mirror

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
I kind of like that

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Let's see

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
I said he's not totally, um

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
I like that rose colored rear view mirror

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Anyway, uh

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Let's see, Blue Swim sends us

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
A tweet saying

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Rob, are you going to get behind the

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Bieber ruined Twitter trending topic

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Happy that people are revolting

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
See, I'm just ahead of my time

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Because I commented on that whole thing a couple weeks ago

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
About how I don't want to use Twitter anymore

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
Because I really can't justify using a site

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
That Justin Bieber is a trending topic

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
On every single day

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
I'm glad that people are finally revolting

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Take back Twitter!

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
From Justin Bieber and all his frickin' mouthy fans

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
And, uh, there you have it

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Those are Twitter topics for tonight

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Or just ignore it

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
I can't ignore it

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Because you got the Bieber fear

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
It's not in my nature

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
S2100Matt says the look back idea

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Was actually his idea

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Oh, my bad

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Sorry, Matt

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
I hate the series

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
It just, you know, needs a more hardcore name

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
That's right

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
A look back to the extreme

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
A look back extreme mix

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Alright

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Anyhow, let's go on to a couple more stories here

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Listless coming up in just a little bit

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
With a special guest, Loki

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
As I'm sure a lot of people thought

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Maybe hell froze over earlier this week

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
But, um

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Bungie has entered in a ten year partnership

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
With Activision

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Um

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Yeah, apparently they're gonna publish the next

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Or all games based on, um, Bungie's

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Next big action game universe

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
And, um

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
They're looking to publish on multiple

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Platforms, so it's no longer gonna be, you know

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Xbox exclusive anymore

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
And, um

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
It kinda makes you wonder

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Bungie, have you not been reading the news?

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
I mean, seriously?

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Yeah, but there's a huge difference, Loki

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
I think you made the mistake a lot of people are making

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Activision did not buy

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Bungie

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Activision has a publishing deal with Bungie

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Activision is basically getting free money out of this deal

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
I mean, all they're doing, they're putting out

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
You know, they'll do the marketing

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
They do everything outside the actual development of the game

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Alright

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
That's what this agreement's all about

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
I honestly don't think this is a big deal

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
If Activision had bought Bungie, then yes

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Oh my gosh, doom and gloom, Bungie, what are you smoking?

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
You all are high

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
But, it's just a publishing deal

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
I mean, they had to sign with somebody

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
They weren't gonna self-publish

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
And what's funny is, uh

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Bungie's Harold Ryan looks like

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Brendan Fraser, he even has that

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Really creepy smile

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
I didn't realize Brendan Fraser had a creepy smile

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Yeah, he's just creepy all around

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Um, so yeah

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
So they're gonna be publishing their next game

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
They'll work out exactly what the next game is actually

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Gonna be

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
But that will probably be coming up at E3

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Probably at E3, and then

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
It's also probably gonna help with that void

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Of people that

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Hate on Activision right now, although

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
I can't imagine it's gonna really affect their sales that much

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Including the Call of Duty franchise

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Cause people bitch, but people still buy

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
It would be interesting to know about this agreement

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
If the Final Cut

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Arrangement is still with Bungie

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
You know Final Cut, so to speak

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Or if Activision gets to make changes to games they want to publish

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
I doubt that's in the agreement

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Kinda Bungie, I imagine, got to do whatever the hell

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
They wanted with this

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
So I don't think this is gonna be bad news at all

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
I really don't

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
You know, and I've been as critical of Activision as the next guy

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
And so forth, but I just think this is just

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Bungie had to sign with someone

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
And Activision makes as good of a sense as anyone else

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
If it had been EA

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
People would have still been like, oh my god

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
I can't believe it

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
It could have been Konami

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Oh my god

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Doesn't matter

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
I think Bungie just wanted to

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Sign with somebody

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
You knew it was gonna be somebody here in the US

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Cause they're a US development company

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
So it wasn't gonna be Konami or any of those

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
SNK or any of those overseas companies

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
It was gonna be an American company

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
And that pretty much leaves EA and Activision

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Pick one

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Alright, anyhow

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Moving on, Square Enix

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
And one of the games they get requested about a lot

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Is Final Fantasy 5 and Final Fantasy 6

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
On the DS

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Cause you might remember they had an epic, epic remake

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Of Final Fantasy 3

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
That was followed by an epic remake of Final Fantasy 4

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
When I say epic remake, they were done in the more 3D-ish

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Style of the newer Final Fantasy games

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Which is pretty awesome

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
So the big question on everybody's mind is

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Where the hell is Final Fantasy 5

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
And really Final Fantasy 5 is just a stepping stone

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
To Final Fantasy 6

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Because we want our opera scene in fully rendered 3D

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Thank you very much

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
But apparently

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
It's not in development just yet

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
There was apparently a Twitter thing

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Going on earlier this week

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
And one of the producers of Square Enix

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Shinji Hashimoto

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Was quoted on Twitter saying that

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
They are undecided about

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
A downloadable port of Second Densetsu 3

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
And the mobile RPG Everheart Odyssey

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
And then he also said

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
For Final Fantasy 5 and 6

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
There are technical issues as well

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
So at present these are also

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Undecided

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Not sure what those technical issues are

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
I wonder if it's space

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
It's a much shorter game than 5 and 6

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
And I wonder if they maybe have just maxed out

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Those damn cartridges

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
I wouldn't think so

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
I don't think so

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Well Amiga777

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
In chat says Square Enix spare us

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
The FMV theatrics and give us some awesome gameplay

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
I agree I would sacrifice

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
The full motion theatrics

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
For some uber 3D-ness

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
But I don't know

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
At the same time

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
I'm okay if they spend the resources just developing

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Something new you know

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Although I don't know I'm torn

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Because the 3 and 4 remakes were pretty hot

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
But at the same time I'm not like

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Ah they need to do 5 and 6

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Or you know if you just want to I don't know

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Port say for example 4, 5 and 6

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Onto a DS cartridge

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
And don't even worry about upgrading it

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
I'd be fine with that

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Maybe it's something they're going to do for the 3DS

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Hmm?

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
I don't know

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Alright guys well we

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Are going to get into a segment here on the show

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Called Listless

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Yay Listless

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Weee

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
And for tonight's Listless

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
We got to get one of our friends here on the phone

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
So we're going to make a little

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Outbound call right now

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Tonight's Listless topic what Capcom

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Versus series should they do

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Next

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Does somebody want to explain Listless how Listless works

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
While I give our guest a call tonight

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Well the way that it works

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Is that we go around all of us

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
And we each pick a game

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
We pick 3 of them in

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Order or pick a subject

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
You know something that we would like to be on the list

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Not a game tonight but something

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
And then what happens is we leave it

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
To the chat room to pick

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Um

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Well we each take one off of the list

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
And then we leave it to the chat room to pick the winner

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
That's right so if you want to help

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Vote for the winner and remember guys

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
This is the definitive list

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
If this list is written there's no arguing

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
It's done

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
It's the definitive list it's a highly scientific

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Process but in order to play the game

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
We need 4 people so we're going to

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Call up a special guest right now

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Let me down the music here

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
While we give our guest a call here

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Hopefully he's standing by I told him it would be 8 o'clock

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Otherwise

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
We'll just open it up to somebody else on Skype

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
I suppose

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
One ringy dingy

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Live radio it's fun two ringy dingys

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Watch he's not going to pick up

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Hello? Hi! Is this Jon?

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Hi who's this? Oh my god

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
It's crazy radio guy hey Jon

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Oh hey I totally forgot you were calling

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Hi

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
You ass

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
What are you doing did I interrupt something?

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Ladies and gentlemen

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
I have a bunch of friends from Securicon over and we're

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Playing Halo and drinking

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
You might be a little pissy but I remembered the topic

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
For listless tonight

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Well folks let me introduce

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Because I didn't say who was coming on the show tonight

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
This is our good buddy Jon Breslull

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
From Undersedation Live

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Saturday nights here at All Games Radio

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
What are you like 7 o'clock 8 o'clock

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Midnight now?

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
8 o'clock Pacific 11 o'clock

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Eastern

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Did you know that one of your old co-hosts

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Said that I sound like a straight version of you

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Who is that? Jenna?

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Or Jessica?

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
When was she on the show? Yeah Jessica

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
I haven't talked to her in years

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
She's actually, whenever I take off from

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
U.S.L. she's going to be hosting for me now

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Oh wow

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
How come I wasn't invited to be a guest host?

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
I see how it is

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Okay well you can bring that up with Travis

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
I will I will

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
I'm going to be my Star Trek Online character just to find Travis

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
And beat the shit out of him

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Was Travis a human? I have to be a Klingon

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
I don't know I don't play Star Trek Online

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
I play WoW

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
I don't know because certain somebody named Travis

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Took me off of Facebook

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Travis Donovan you're a bitch

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Punch him in the balls

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
That's always a good solution for Travis

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
You know what though?

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Facebook does weird things

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
I've lost friends mysteriously

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
He may not have done that on purpose

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
If he did he's got some drama

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Alright here we go

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Let's do this

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Hey tell the people in the background to shut up

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
We're trying to do a radio show

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Hey people in the background please stop masturbating

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
Alright

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
How was Securicon by the way?

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Did you have fun?

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
It was a lot of fun

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
I made a lot of friends

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
I made a lot more friends and it was just a great time

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Wait you have friends?

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Definitely look forward to 2011

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Oh good times good times

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Aren't we supposed to be playing a game online soon or something?

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Was I what?

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Never mind

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
I think I was talking about something I'm not supposed to talk about yet

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Alright

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Let's get into something else

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Get into the list list

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
You know tonight's topic is

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
What Capcom vs series or should I say vs Capcom series

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Should they do next?

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:02.000
We're going to go around and get your top 3 answers

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Breslow we'll start with you

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Your number 3 answer

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
What Capcom vs series should they do next?

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
I'm throwing the political card on here

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Because I think this is the most important one

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Since I get to go first

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
And I'm surprised I haven't done this

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Capcom vs Midway

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
That would be fun

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
So like Mortal Kombat characters

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Yeah so you'd have a bunch of Mortal Kombat characters

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Against the Street Fighter characters and such

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
I think that would be awesome

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:32.000
I'm actually rewording your answer to be Midway vs Capcom

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Because it's always something vs Capcom

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Just so you know

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
That was attractive

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:42.000
By the way, logical answer coming from Breslow

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
I mean this episode is full of shockers tonight

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Alright

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Who wants to go next?

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Dark Sakura what do you want to pick for your number 3 answer?

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Um

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
McDonaldland vs Capcom

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Mayor McCheese

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
And the Grimace

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
And the Fry Guys

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
I fucking love it

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
The Grimace

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
And

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Birdie the Early Bird

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Hello?

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
Whatever happened in the McDonaldland characters?

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Hello?

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Breslow?

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
It's McDonaldland vs Capcom

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Is what it is

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Oh our stream

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
I want Mayor McCheese as the boss

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Apparently our stream died

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
And our thing is trying to reconnect right now

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
But we're going to keep recording for podcast sake

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Shit but now our chatters

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Can't hear to vote

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
We're going to hope

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
The chatters right now are saying

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
The all games stream vs Capcom

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Because apparently we shut down

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Alright we're back up

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Alright so far we have Midway vs Capcom

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
And McDonaldland vs Capcom

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Alright Loki

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
What is your number 3 answer tonight?

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
I was trying to be slightly serious here

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
So this is kind of obscure

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
For people who don't remember

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
But Paul Robertson vs Capcom

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
And to explain

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Who Paul Robertson is

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
He's the guy that did the animation

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Pirate Baby's Cabana Street Fight

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
And then also

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Yes that one

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
That animation was such an amazing thing

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Exactly and like

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
Devil eyes and just like

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
All sorts of crazy ass 8 bit

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Animation stuff so

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
That would be kind of cool

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Okay fair enough

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Paul Robertson vs Capcom

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
It's better than Pirate Baby's Cabana Street Fight

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
vs Capcom

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Alright my number 3 answer

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
I have picked Saturday Night Live

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
vs Capcom

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Because

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
I just won an excuse to

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Beat the shit out of any character Chris Kattan

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Who I never played

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
And you know I think some of it would be kind of cool

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
You know your favorite SNL

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Like the coneheads and the guys that

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Bob their heads to what is love

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Baby don't hurt me

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
SNL vs Capcom is my number 3 answer

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Did you like that answer Bresloh?

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
I did

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
I beat the crap out of all the crappy skits

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
They've done from like 97 to 2003

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
I know it would be fun

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Alright

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Anyhow your number 2 answer

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Bresloh and just to catch the folks up joining us

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Because the feed was down so far we have

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Midway vs Capcom

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
McDonaldland vs Capcom

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Paul Robertson vs Capcom

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
And Saturday Night Live vs Capcom

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
What is your

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Number 2 answer

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
Bresloh?

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
How bad would you want?

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Jesus vs Capcom

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
So Jesus vs Capcom

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
You're not going to make it just

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
The Bible?

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Bible vs Capcom

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Bible vs Capcom

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
So you can play like Moses

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
And Jesus

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
What character

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
God would be the end boss

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Who would be the end boss?

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
God

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
God would be the end boss

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Bible vs Capcom

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
I love some of these answers in chat

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
I'm just cracking up

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Sarah your number 2 pick

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
It was actually something on the serious end

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
I picked

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Arc System Works vs Capcom

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
As in Guilty Gear and Blaze Blue

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Ah okay

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
So you want your Blaze Blue and all that stuff vs Capcom

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
And the fighting

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
The fighting systems

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Are pretty similar too

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
So I think it would be fun

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
I want to have Strider hear you

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
vs the little bad guy

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
Alright

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Let's see, Loki what is your number 2

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
answer tonight?

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
You know I had to change one of my answers

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Because of your SNL thing

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
I got to top that

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Although that would be my number 1 answer

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
Now it's going to be a semi serious one

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Konami vs Capcom

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Because they have a lot of good 8-bit characters

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
That would be pretty awesome to bring over

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
You have different Contra characters

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Hell you can put

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Frogger in there if you want

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Castlevania

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
I mean that would be pretty awesome

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Alright

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
I'm also going to go with the super freaking

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Obviously I was going to do

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
See I don't know if this would

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
Well I'm going to go with a different one

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
Because I already have a list just in case mine gets taken

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Mine was kind of a Konami thing

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
But I'll go ahead and go in a different direction

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
I'm going to do the completely obvious and probably stealing someone else's answer

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
And why hasn't anyone thought of this yet

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Nintendo vs Capcom

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Hello

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
I'm a jackass Ronald Roberts

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
I mean hello

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Mario, Samus

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Pit, all the like

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
Super Smash Brothers Melee characters vs Capcom

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Hello why is this not happening

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Duh

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
Alright

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Sounds like I took your answer didn't I Breslull

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
You did

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
My bad, well do you have a backup answer

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Because we're ready for your number 1 answer

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
So far, let me recap what you think

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
So far the list is Midway vs Capcom

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Paul Robertson vs Capcom

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
SNL vs Capcom

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
All games vs Capcom

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
All games vs Capcom

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Would you be one of the fighters in

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
All games vs Capcom

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
I would and so would you

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000

What would my special move be

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
It would be to bitch slap people silly

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
What would Dark Sakura's

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
special move be

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Um

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Throwing Guinness bombs at people

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
And Loki

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Um

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000

Alright

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Dark Sakura

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
Blank vs Capcom

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Taito

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Could you imagine Bud and Bob

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Getting like

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
Hadoken

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
What would their special move be

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
They'd just trap the opponent in a bubble

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Yeah and pop them

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
That might be fun

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
They'd have special attacks like the water

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Bubble

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Boom

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
We're recording this

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
Remember it's only porn if you tape it

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
John blow your rape whistle

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
Alright back to the show

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Anything else you want to say about Taito vs Capcom

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Rainbow Islands

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
Loki your number 1 answer please

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
My number 1 answer is

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Very obvious considering the

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
SNL thing

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
It's Nick at Nite vs Capcom

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
And of course

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
It's awesome because you have a fighting

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
game with Bill Cosby

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Will Smith

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
From the Fresh Prince of Bel Air

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
John shut the fuck up

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
You're interrupting a professionally done radio

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
show by raping me

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
I just want you to know this

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
This is a bad idea

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
Hey

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Do you think you could stop getting your

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
asshole raped by a woman

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
In time to do this show here

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Actually the worst part is I'm getting my

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
asshole raped by a man

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
That's nothing new

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Loki

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
Nick at Nite vs Capcom

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Yes and I think the golden

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
girls was on there one time so that would be

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
pretty awesome

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
The monkeys were on there and could you imagine that fight

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
That would be pretty awesome

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
As long as Bea Arthur is a character I'm fine

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Would Bea Arthur be a character?

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
Sure then I'm fine

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
My number 1 answer

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
I'm gonna totally

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Black Wolf says Cosby's ultra

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
servant puddin' pop

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
I'm gonna go with a very obvious number

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
one that I'm surprised nobody has said yet

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
but I'm gonna win myself a lot of fans with this

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
one and my number 1 answer

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Whedonverse vs

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Capcom thank you very much

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Dr. Horrible, Buffy the Vampire Slayer

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Firefly

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Jane vs Capcom

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
Jane vs Capcom that would be

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
funny

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Joss Whedonverse vs Capcom

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
And when he comes out the first thing he says is

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
you're damaging my calm

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Tell me that would not sell

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
But we also need like a mid

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
boss to be like the blue hand guys

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
from you know

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
I just want Elijah

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
What the fuck alright

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Doctor Who vs Capcom

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000

Cooking Mama vs Capcom

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Capcom vs Capcom

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Mavis Beacon vs Capcom

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Capcom vs Capcom

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Coco vs

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Capcom

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
I'm sorry chat room that's just it's the it's

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
one of life's tough lessons is that

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
sometimes your account

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
What?

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
I said it sucks for those guys I know sucks

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
to be them alright well at least they're not getting

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
raped alright uh Bresl

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
uh here it is for your recap

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
we're gonna go around and take one off the

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
list alright Bresl so listen carefully

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
cause I'm not gonna read this a million times

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
Midway vs Capcom

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
McDonaldland vs Capcom

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
Paul Robertson vs Capcom

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
SNL vs Capcom

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Bible vs Capcom

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Arc System Works vs Capcom

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Konami vs Capcom

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
Nintendo vs Capcom

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
All Games vs Capcom

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
and Whedon vs Capcom

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
Bresl which one of these

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
is not worthy of the list?

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Nintendo vs Capcom

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
Oh you whore

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
why not

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
it'd be hard to go multiplatform

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
because it would turn into the Capcom characters

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
have to do button combinations and then you could

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
just stamp Falcon Punch

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
with the Nintendo characters

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
I suppose I will accept that logic

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
but you're still an asshole alright

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Dark Sakura you're next

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
which one of these is not worthy of the list?

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
Bible vs Capcom

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
oh you just

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
just

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
not feeling Jesus

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
as a playable character huh?

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
I don't really give a crap about

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
Jesus in the game

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
alright fair enough

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Loki which one of these is not worthy of the list?

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
uh

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
I'm gonna have to go with Midway vs Capcom

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
just because

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
you know I've seen the

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Coogan videos with the

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
Mortal Kombat characters vs Street Fighter

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
it looks weird okay

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
I guess they could reanimate them

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
but it would just be weird

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
and besides Midway

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
is no longer around so

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
that's true it would be kinda hard to get the licensing wouldn't it

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
alright as far as me

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
which one of these is not worthy of the list?

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
I'm gonna have to say Paul Robertson vs Capcom

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
too obscure sorry Loki

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
wow

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
I think that was the first on air rape that we had

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
going on during a fun happy say

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
I don't think that was the first on air rape

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
this show is on air rape

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
that's true we do kind of rape gaming news

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
every week

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
back in the day when we used to broadcast live

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
during some of those DDR parties

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
yeah that was

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
on air rape and I think that's where

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
big black cock came into play

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
alright

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
please more gaming news

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
darksagras save us

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
for call of duty fans

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
actually the next one coming out

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
has been named

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
it's call of duty

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
black ops coming out on

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
the 9th of November 2010

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
that's at least the European date

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
and they've confirmed co-op

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
for it so

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
you can play with your buddies together

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
killing people

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
and that's actually one

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
that I would be interested in I think

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
checking out is a black ops

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
game you know

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
instead of you know full on face front combo

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
you know combat you have

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
to be sneaky like solid snake

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
so

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
I

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
well I'm sure the fans

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
are just

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
all they're saying is it's a

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
Treyarch call of duty

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
so

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
um

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
alright so apparently

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
this is kind of interesting and scary at the same time

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
red faction

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
a wonderful

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
you know kind of sci-fi

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
action game from

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Q and volition is being

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
turned into a TV

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
movie the problem is

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
it's being produced by sci-fi

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
the same folks that brought us

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
what was it

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
mega shark versus

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
giant octopus or whatever the hell

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
it was that's

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
scary I'm sorry how is this

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
a problem

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
I believe you just called

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
this a problem because it's gonna

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
suck the problem is the rumor I

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
heard that sci-fi is like picking up wrestling

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
and stuff now and they're not gonna do those movies

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
anymore that's a problem

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
they're all just

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
blending together every station does

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
not need wrestling okay

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
unless they're dressing up like space

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
aliens or people from

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
battle star galactica it does not

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
need to be on sci-fi there is nothing

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
science fiction about wrestling except for the plot

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
um

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
what the hell is that

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
watch the shark

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
through the plane

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
ah yes

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
it is so

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
this looks so fake I love it

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
condor airlines

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
and they had a

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
image or whatever a little picture

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
that someone made that talked about what

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
it would take physics wise for

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
the shark to do that it was just

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
retarded

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
ah yes high production

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
value right there

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
holy shit

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
that's the kind of stuff you make

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
in like high school how dare someone

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
try to take this from me

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
shark eating a

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
plane how dare you try to take that out of

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
my life anyways

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
so they're gonna be doing

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
possibly um

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
an ongoing series

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
as well if the movie does well so it's

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
expected to be um

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
coming out early 2011

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
and um

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
we'll see how it turns out cause

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
most movies that are based on video

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
games kinda suck and this one's

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
done by sci-fi who puts out movies that

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
pretty much always suck so

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
I don't know it's like um

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
a convergence of suck

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
a convergence of suck really

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
yes alright uh

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
well we'll see what happens uh good thing

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
they're not making a movie out of this but uh

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
cause I think it would be kinda boring but apparently

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
somebody has beat Bejeweled 2

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
yes who knew that Bejeweled 2

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
was beatable I sure didn't but Bejeweled 2

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
got beaten this week after

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
three years

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
that's right this guy Mike

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Lady? Ladi? Ladi?

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
he probably gets called Lady poor guy

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Mike Ladi I'm gonna say it's Ladi

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
uh apparently uh beat

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Bejeweled 2 he played the same game

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
for 2205

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
hours and 51 minutes that

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
was a score of 2

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
billion 147 million

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
so on and so on points apparently

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
that's the point where the score display

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
just went to black and there's actually

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
a YouTube of it that's up um

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
and PopCap just said hey

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
you beat it they didn't

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
want to acknowledge that the game broke they were just like

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
you beat it congrats

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
it's the Bejeweled kill screen

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
yeah it's basically what it is the Bejeweled kill screen and you can

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
actually see

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
PopCap actually put up the video themselves

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
exactly what that took

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
and I think they put the picture

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
of the kill screen here

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
or not cause maybe PopCap

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
didn't want to show their game breaking

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
I don't know

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
that was just like a little promotional video

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
it was all happy go lucky

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
yay Bejeweled were awesome

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
play us on Facebook

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
well somebody broke it so yes a kill screen

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
is achievable in Bejeweled 2 but 3 years

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
seriously

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
seriously

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
3 years is a long time

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
I know right

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
and that was all time when he was supposed to be working

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
mailbag

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
every week you send us emails

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
mailbagatorangelaungeradio.com

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
darksacra might read them on air

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
and she might decide to say screw you guys I'm not reading emails this week

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
I'm reading them

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
alright yay we caught her in a good mood

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
hello Orange Lounge Radio

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Haseo here to rant a bit

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
first I'm sorry for spelling errors due to the use of

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Vicodin after surgery involving

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
knee dislocation dude sorry

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
but you misspelled Vicodin

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
you know what though I would say

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
being on Vicodin is an acceptable excuse

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
for bad grammar dude when you're on Vicodin you don't

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
care

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
we're going to give them a pass

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
second I was really just saying that to be

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
a smartass second the whole Activision

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
bullshit starting with this whole

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
Infinity Ward leaving the company

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
Infinity Ward left Activision

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
and they as we already

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
know are the creators of Call of Duty

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
now according to G4 and their

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
the feed service

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
they say that the next Call of Duty games will be called

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
Call of Duty Black Ops comes out this fall

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
what the hell is Activision thinking?

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
especially when the Infinity Ward founders left and

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
35 other team members quit oh and did I mention

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
they are suing Activision for up to

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
500 million

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
for reasons untold to me

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
now Activision as stupid as they are

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
they have the Bungie

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
they have Bungie the creators of Halo

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
sign a 10 year contract what the hell

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
lastly three questions

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
one would it be illegal

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
to infect my aunts computer with a virus

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
to teach her a lesson?

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
how would I go about that?

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
well she's a bitch I mean

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
no I'm not trying to cripple it only trying to

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
burst her I'm not to blame for the

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
fucking it up bubble like a warning virus

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
switch her default browser

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
to Internet Explorer I think that will pretty much do it

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
I thought it would do it

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
have her use yahoo mail

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
just switch her homepage to

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
two girls one cup

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
or lemon party

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
two

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
is there a way to hack a copy of Final Fantasy 12

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
like you hacked 13

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
or do you know of a cheat I've beaten it over a year ago

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
and I want to replay for story

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
cause Loki's a big cheater

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
at 13 so can you cheat at 12?

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
12 I'm not sure

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
if there's a way to hack set at the

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
save I mean maybe

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
I'm sure there is

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
three

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
you just need a game genie

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
is there a way to hack an imported

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
UMD and change the text to English?

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
no

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
but yeah back to the

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Final Fantasy 12 thing because it's on Playstation 2

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
you could probably just get like a game shark or

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
approach and replay or something like that

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
if you don't want to cheat in the game

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
why did

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat just say two girls

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
one cup versus Capcom?

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
because he's trying to mess with

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
our brains I think the cup wins

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
thanks for reading my email

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
and if you don't what the fuck people

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
your loyal listener Hasia Sumiragawa

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Sumiragawa

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Sumiragawa

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
made me

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
I was just thinking of the cup winning

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
whoever wins we all lose

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
this is Robert M. I don't mean

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
to sound like one of those one-knit fanboys

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
but since it came out I'm pretty obsessed with WarioWare

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
DIY even though I'm currently somewhat

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
stagnant at creating new games in it

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
for some reason I actually had a dream

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
where one of my micro games set

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
a record for in-game sales

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
which somehow made the Orange Knowledge

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Radio show roll I remember

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Loki saying he didn't get it meaning the game

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
and all of you were

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
as all you did was tap and a character

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
moves up slightly

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
this somehow leads to a kernel of thought would you like to

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
see a series of OLR dream game micro

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
games or would you of course

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
prefer these concepts in a more substantial

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
more readily accessible less handheld

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
format I imagine having puzzle

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
slots or what they play snap

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
available in my warehouse might be

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
confusing to other people

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
in my in-game friends list have a good

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
show I think we'll take it in whatever format

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
we can get it yeah I know I'll take it wherever I can get it

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
but I think what they play dot com snap would

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
be very I mean because what was what

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
they play dot com snap supposed to be was just like what

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
two gay guys having sex holding

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
a dismembered head shouting fuck wasn't that the whole

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
and you take pictures of it like Pokemon

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
snap yeah and if you if you're kind of

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
like sitting at your radio right now in disgust

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
um it has to do with a poll

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
that what they play dot com ran like a

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
year ago about the most offensive game

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
most offensive thing in video games

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
and like I think homos and games was like

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
more offensive than dismembered heads or something

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
um so we suggested that they

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
should make a game about it called what they play dot com

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
snap uh go read about it in

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
the OLR wiki it's it's all there

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
this next email just made me

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
snort hard

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
hi OLR as usual thank you for

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
supporting yyr games OLR is awesome

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
and so is everyone who listens to it

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
as a show under mat

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
relayed your game request discussed

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
during the last weeks show apparently you have requested

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
a game based on the golden girls yes

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
yes please oh my god yes

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
after spending many hours sweating countless

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
buckets and crumbling hundreds of pieces

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
of paper before tossing them in the general

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
direction of a wastebasket I'm prepared to

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
unveil the following concept the golden girls

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
death squad

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
the golden girls death squad will be a four player

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
cooperative twin stick shooter

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
each player will assume the likeness of either

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
Dorothy, Rose, Blanche or Sophia

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
and battle an advancing army of terrorist robots

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
and balding perverted old men in full

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
180p high definition I'm sorry

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
I'm about to explode from awesomeness

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
Rob needs to go change his mantis

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
I do

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
you'll use the left stick to maneuver each

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
girl's technologically advanced mechanical

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
wheelchair each wheelchair

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
is equipped with its own unique weaponry

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
just as each girl is equipped with wisecracks

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
and quips taken straight from the popular TV

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
show voiced by the original actresses

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
spoken dialogue varies with context

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
when you get close to an enemy you'll hear Dorothy cry

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
have you lost your head? as she chops off their

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
head with an axe

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
each of the game's seven levels

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Rob's red in the

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
face this is beautiful

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
each of the seven levels

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
are loosely based on the show's seven seasons

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
boss enemies will include Dorothy's cheating husband

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Stanley evil palette swapped versions

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
of the main characters and the

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
leader of a cult named high cholesterol

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
fortunately you will have rocket

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
launchers nuclear bombs exploding calcium

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
supplements as part of your wheelchair arsenal

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
the game will feature

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
four player simultaneous drop in drop out

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
play over xbox live

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
60 frames per second animation simple and

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
responsive controls motion capture versions of the

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
show's actresses and a driving

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
rock and electronic soundtrack featuring

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
a hard drum and bass mix of the show's

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
opening theme thank you for being a friend

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
development of the game will commence immediately upon

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
our receipt of the rights to the golden girl's license

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
um you can help me get that for free right

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
the budget currently allocated for

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
the development of this game consists of

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
the four dollars in my wallet I'd hate to

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
use it on licensing when I can pick up a sandwich

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
instead oh wait I think I just

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
sold a copy of falling now my budget

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
is 470 wait what you have to pay

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
you

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
am I getting pathetic

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
is this turning into a baking and groveling

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
a bit too much I don't know I just really want to see

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
my grandma game

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
I know okay

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
this one is from Robaba

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
about test drive

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
unlimited 2 I was a big

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
fan of the original test drive unlimited

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
and we had an ol army clubhouse

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
joystick shows the demo reel here

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
um

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
it doesn't look like lost islands oahu setting

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
at least not for the video it does

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
look a lot more types

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
of driving events but the character models are

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
sims 2 ish still it releases

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
in fall amongst the big titles so I hope

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
it does well I never did get to play my 5000

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
miles in the first one I remember

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
test drive that was a pretty neat game

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
um it's

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
taken him long enough to kind of put out news of a sequel

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
I don't know I'll play it if it's good

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
but it's going to be tough because there's so many racing

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
games coming out that I'm so interested in

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
you know but um well that'll be

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
I'll be a ways out by the way

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
that's it going back

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
to the email

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
from yyr act def says

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
you can call it golden age

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
grannies killing spree

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
this is great the prize has to still be cheesecake

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
yes

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
grannies with a z

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
I made a game with grannies in it

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
alright there was our mail bag

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
and now it's time

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
imagine grannies

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
I know this is a little

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
outside of the box for you I know this is

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
not a retro game or inspired

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
by you know other stuff but I'm telling you

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
instant cash machine

02:23:52.000 --> 02:24:10.000
alright lets get into the fus of the week

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:14.000
f u to um

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
caffeine withdrawal headaches

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
they stink

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
yeah

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
low key

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
um

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
I guess

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
f u to my neighbors

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
pushes for still being alive even after

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
I dumped a half gallon of weed

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
killer on them

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
damn you weeds

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
oh I will kill them

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
um

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
I don't really have much of an f u of the week

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
I'm again in fairly good spirits

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
I will say f u to me being such a procrastinator

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
cause I procrastinated

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
on something big time I really should have got taken

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
care of a lot sooner but whatever

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
hey you know what life goes on

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
alright

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
there's worse things that could happen in the world

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
lets move on

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
we got a couple more stories for you guys

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
then the listless results

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
and then the skype line

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
and listless by the way I will say this about listless

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
this doesn't happen very often in listless

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
but every single answer

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
tonight got at least one vote

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
every single answer usually something gets shut out

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
but it's going to be a close one tonight

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
so hopefully you guys all voted if not

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
you got like 30 seconds left

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
loki what do you got for us

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
while we wrap these up stop playing that game

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
what are you playing now

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
yes you are you're playing that freaking

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
contra in castlevania meet

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
super mario brothers and all that crap

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
alright

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
well this is appropriate I guess

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
or not I don't know

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
it's of course you know a parody game

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
and only in

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
japan of course created by

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
joe jin circle studio

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
s super strip

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
fighter 4 is a

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
18 and up parody fighting

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
game with 15 brawlers

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
and skimpy outfits and apparently

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
there's also one big fat geek dude in there as well

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
and um

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
I guess it has parodies of

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
fighters from king of fighters

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
tekken virtual fighter

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
street fighter you name it and of course

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
um each character

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
has their own special abilities

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
for example rana

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
who is covered in massage oil which she uses

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
to rub on herself on the

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
other fighters and uh

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
slip past their punches

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
um or they have um some other people

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
who throw vibrators

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
and what not but it's um

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
a game where they basically get

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
uh

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
they get uh

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
their clothes ripped off as they're fighting

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
so awesome

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
only playable

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
in japan I'm afraid

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
oh what a big surprise

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
a game like that is never going to come out here

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
what a shock

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
but they have some screenshots and it's uh

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
interesting I guess

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
amaze satsuma in our chat room says

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
super strip fighter isn't that called

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
dead or alive

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
ba dum bum ba dum bum merrimay is a comedian here at

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
olr

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
orange lounge radio of course as you know started

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
about a little game called

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
adr and the other types of music games that were out there

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
in a series called bamani

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
well guess what the bamani series is still alive

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
so we want to take our last story

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
tonight to show you guys

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
one of the new bamani series

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
that's coming out well we're not going to show you because it's a radio show

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
but we're going to talk about it it's called reflect

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
beat that's right a brand new game of the bamani

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
series called reflect beat is apparently

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
location testing

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
what is going on here it's a

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
multi touch space touch screen

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
I guess up to five simultaneous

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
touches will register on the screen it's a two player

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
player game it's two machines

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
linked together if there's no second player you can play

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
against the CPU it's made

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
at a wide screen and what happens is that

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
player one has a red colored bar across the bottom

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
of the screen and player two has a blue colored bar

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
across the bottom of their screen and what happens

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
is that at the start of the game the music begins

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
and a ring shaped note appears at the center of the

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
screen the note travels from the center to

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
the player's bottom bar the

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
player touches the bottom bar when

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
and where ever the note

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
meets the bar to the beat of the music

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
if you hit it then it changes

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
to the color of the player and bounces right

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
back to the opponent the rate

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
at which it will move will depend on the music

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
so if it's a slow BPM then

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
the note will move slowly and so on and so on

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
there's hold notes, chain notes

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
and so forth they say it's also

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
a lot like boom boom rocket

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
if you've ever played that on xbox live with the whole

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
bar and the exploding fireworks

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
some of the songs in the game there's

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
a remix of star mine 7 7

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
a song called

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
there's even some pictures that are posted around there

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
like it kinda

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
a little bit that's what I was totally thinking

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000

i uh say almost

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
uh j and

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
it's gonna be get

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
dumbed down and

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
which is boo hoo

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
but here's the other thing though

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
is that well uh

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
hmm

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
building is borked

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
they can

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
be in the school building for like

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
2 minutes and then

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
they uh

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
it just stops i don't know

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
i have no idea

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
that's something that you're probably gonna have to

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
check on the sims 3 forum for

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
yeah

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
i've never had that problem so i don't

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
know how to help with it

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
what's supposed to be coming in this next sims 3

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
expansion what's the

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
big thing that they're going to do with this

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
uh

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
like they were they are

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
apparently they're gonna make

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
a move that

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
to make

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
make a move on those

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
those players that

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
never leave the sims

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
the sim creator

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
or uh

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
the or the uh

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
like where they

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
just build lots

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
and never play the actual sims game

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
well if they're happy doing

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
that i don't understand why they're gonna ruin

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
that get out and play the game

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
dammit

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
yeah well but

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
it's like never mind really so

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
it's

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
it's interesting though you know there's a lot going on

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
in um i don't wanna

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
compare the sims 3 to wow but i will

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
uh there's a lot going on

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
in wow right now where they're really changing up the game

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
and they're changing it in some big big ways

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
and it's kind of causing the player base to

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
have some rabble rabble although blizzard

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
changes big shit with every patch

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
and everything works out just fine but i guess the big

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
thing that's causing rabble rabble is that

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
now the 10 man and 25 man

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
raids are gonna share the same lockout

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
so if you're in one of those raiding guilds that does 10

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
mans and 25 mans every week you're gonna have to pick

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
one or the other not gonna be able

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
not gonna be able to do both anymore

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
we all have to do different raids or something like that

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
same loot and everything

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
it's gonna be very interesting they're saying oh it's gonna kill 25

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
man raiding so you know

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
big changes to the game but sometimes it works out for the better

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
so in a way and you know i'm relating

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
this back to sims 3 i promise

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
you know if they're gonna change some of the core elements of the game

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
maybe it's just because they kind of

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
see the habits of the players right now and

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
they kind of want to course people into

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
looking at this whole other part of the game that they've

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
developed that nobody's looking at

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
and also

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
a thing that's apparently

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
coming with the new expansion is that

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
there's gonna be apparently

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
natural disasters

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
coming

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
now there you go

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
there

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
we have something really interesting

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
now that kind of reminds me

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
if that would happen

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
because well the

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
optimal would be if they

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
made a

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
well what's the

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
season

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
i think it's actually called

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
the seasons

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
expansion that they made for sims 2

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
since well

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
since i'm like a snow person i would

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
love to have my sims

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
playing in snow

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
but here's the problem

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
is that

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
your cure

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
even though the problem that i would have

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
with that is that my current sims

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
house is

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
not is

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
not exactly a winter

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
house because they would

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
would freeze if so

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
were the case if you have to have walls around

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
everything since i'm like

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
i'm having like one bed here

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
one bed there all the all in the opening

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
i have to say

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
though this expansion where they want to

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
add like natural disasters

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
kind of reminds me of the roots of the sim

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
series which would be sim city

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
which is kind of the game that started it all

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
because remember you could have natural disasters in sim city

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
like your nuclear power plant blowing up

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
or godzilla attacks the city

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
good times

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000
indeed good times

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
