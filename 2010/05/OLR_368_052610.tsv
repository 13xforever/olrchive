28000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 368 of Orange Lounge Radio
36000	40000	The video game talk show where every gamer has a voice
40000	43000	But not tonight apparently, tonight's going to be a little bit different
43000	47000	And I will get to that in just a moment, but my name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours
47000	50000	Maybe hour, I don't know, we'll see how long we go tonight
50000	53000	With my co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
53000	55000	It better not be hours
55000	61000	Well yeah, it's already a little late, just to put it, well let me introduce everyone and then we'll get into what's going on tonight
61000	63000	Also the one and only tech master, Lowkey
63000	64000	Hello
64000	65000	How you doing Lowkey?
65000	66000	I'm doing good
66000	70000	Alright so here's the deal, we're not live, it's not Sunday, we're cheating a little bit
70000	75000	You know usually we do this little program of ours live and we have a chat room full of people
75000	79000	And you know live callers and all that stuff, but we are not live tonight
79000	86000	We were supposed to be live last Sunday, the 20 something, 22nd, I don't know
86000	89000	But we weren't live because it was kind of my fault
89000	93000	I was out of town and while I was out of town my car was parked at a friend's house
93000	97000	And somehow a nail ended up on my tire while it was parked at a friend's house
97000	102000	So unfortunately instead of coming right home, picking up my car and driving right here to the show
102000	105000	Which was the original plan, I had to go fix a tire
105000	107000	So unfortunately the live show didn't happen
107000	112000	So apologies to you kids and of course Lowkey and Dark Sakura who clear their schedules every Sunday night
112000	114000	And I wasn't even here, I'm a bad person
114000	115000	Damn nail
115000	118000	That's okay, I had more Red Dead Redemption in the play
118000	121000	I was gonna say, you guys probably figured out something to do to kill time
121000	123000	Because I knew pretty early in the day it wasn't gonna happen
123000	125000	I hung out with Becky
125000	128000	Well awesome, you got girl time, ew girl stuff
128000	132000	And we went to Fresh Choice and ate salad
132000	133000	Ew
133000	135000	I can't condone that kind of behavior
135000	136000	I know, gross
136000	139000	Alright I'm glad I wasn't here, I'm glad I was 100 miles away from you
139000	140000	Alright just kidding
140000	141000	Hey
141000	143000	Alright well so here's the deal
143000	147000	We already knew we weren't gonna be here Memorial Day weekend because it's Memorial Day weekend
147000	151000	I know I for one am gonna be in Oregon and just you know the long weekend
151000	153000	I think we wanna all do other stuff
153000	156000	So if Dark Sakura wants to eat Fresh Choice three days in a row, she can go do that
156000	160000	So we wanted to do like a show though at least for the podcastees
160000	163000	So that way we're not going two weeks without a show
163000	166000	So a lot of the podcast folks that don't usually tune in live
166000	169000	This show's kind of actually for you because this way
169000	172000	A lot of the show's been kind of hitting the feed Wednesday, Thursday anyway
172000	178000	So you guys will probably not even notice except for the fact that we don't have a live audience tonight
178000	179000	That we're really missing anything
179000	181000	So just kind of setting the stage there
181000	185000	We're offline tonight, it's Wednesday so we're actually midweek
185000	187000	And you know that's where we're at
187000	192000	We're kind of taping this as a bridge to fill two weeks of no live shows
192000	195000	I do want to point out though, we will be off Memorial Day
195000	204000	Our next live show will be at allgames.com at 6pm Pacific time on Sunday, June 6th
204000	207000	It'll be the next live show and that's right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
207000	209000	At 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
209000	213000	And of course we always have our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com
213000	216000	So Robby says 6pm specific time
216000	217000	Specific
217000	218000	At a specific time
218000	221000	It's 6! Specifically it's 6!
221000	222000	I'm sorry
222000	224000	I meant to say 6 Pacific but I kind of
224000	227000	Really did that you started, I have to give you a hard time
227000	230000	See right now you've got me in the middle of the week on hump day
230000	233000	When my spirit hasn't quite been broken
233000	241000	You know and I'm not doing the what's tomorrow
241000	244000	So wait we might get good mood Jamie tonight
244000	245000	I'm just teasing
245000	248000	And you're full of salad, you ought to be in a great mood
248000	251000	Actually I'm not full of salad right now, I'm full of taco
251000	252000	Okay, ooh tacos
252000	254000	I had, because we have to do food
254000	255000	Yes
255000	262000	I had refried black beans and brown Spanish rice
262000	264000	On a sprouted green tortilla
264000	266000	Yum
266000	269000	I haven't eaten dinner yet and I'm smelling Loki's chicken so
269000	275000	That's why I ate cause he brings his chicken in and I'm like yum wait I can't eat that
275000	277000	I just didn't want burgers tonight, it's all good
277000	279000	Rob do you want me to make you some dinner?
279000	283000	No no I gotta stop by and get some stuff for the big road trip
283000	286000	Cause I am driving 10 hours to Portland Oregon
286000	288000	And I've never taken a road trip that long
288000	289000	I've never been to Oregon
289000	291000	You should get some raw nuts
291000	293000	For the trip
293000	294000	Raw nuts and dried fruit
294000	295000	Good times
295000	299000	Alright here's the other interesting thing about tonight's show
299000	302000	And what might make this show a little special
302000	306000	We don't have a script tonight, usually we have you know not that the show is scripted
306000	309000	Or even fun but we usually have like an outline, we call it a show roll
309000	311000	And you've probably heard us refer to it before
311000	313000	A little behind the scenes there
313000	315000	We do have like a list of who's gonna cover what topic
315000	317000	That way we're not stepping on each other's toes
317000	319000	And we kinda know who's gonna talk about what
319000	321000	And you know we have a general flow to the show
321000	323000	Not tonight, we're winging it tonight
323000	325000	This is gonna be like the old days
325000	326000	Remember the old days?
326000	331000	Except I don't have the headset on and I won't have a migraine hopefully
331000	333000	So yeah so I
333000	335000	I know I might get high on chicken fumes
335000	337000	We'll see what happens, we don't know
337000	340000	But we do always start off the show with how was your gaming week
340000	341000	And we don't plan to change that
341000	343000	So DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
343000	345000	I gamed Rob, I gamed
345000	348000	I played Portal
348000	350000	Because it was free
350000	353000	And it's really hard to get used to the controls on
353000	357000	You know from going from playing on a controller to playing on
357000	360000	My PC but it's pretty cool
360000	362000	And I of course played a lot of Star Trek online
362000	364000	Because I've got the week off, you know I'm out of school
364000	366000	And it's like I've got all this stuff I have to focus on
366000	368000	But I so haven't been able to
368000	372000	And I played some Babylonian Twins today
372000	373000	For a little bit
373000	376000	And Dan's playing more Grand Theft Horse
376000	380000	He killed his horse by accident
380000	382000	Except he died too so he got his horse back
382000	385000	He keeps complaining about not having his original horse
385000	386000	Because he liked his horse
386000	388000	I was like what was good about the horse?
388000	390000	It was a bay horse and I liked it, it was pretty
390000	391000	Oh whatever
391000	394000	So yeah and he was picking his you know gristled cowboys
394000	396000	Out picking flowers for this old guy
396000	402000	And then Pac-Man, Google Pac-Man
402000	407000	Because Namco had their 25th anniversary
407000	408000	I think it's 30th
408000	410000	30th anniversary
410000	415000	30th anniversary and so the Google splash thing was a playable version of Pac-Man
415000	417000	And if you go to Google.com slash Pac-Man
417000	419000	You can actually go back and play it
419000	421000	What's impressive about that if I recall
421000	422000	I was reading up on it
422000	424000	It's not like Flash
424000	426000	It's not Java
426000	430000	It's using some pretty basic web technology to bring it to you
430000	431000	Which is really impressive
431000	432000	The programming
432000	434000	And actually I was checking out the Twitter earlier
434000	437000	Somebody on Twitter is going to have us talk about that a little more
437000	442000	It looks like it actually resulted in a lot of lost productivity at work
442000	443000	Fascinating
443000	449000	Was it Cnet or one of those news sites posted about how much had been lost
449000	455000	And then it went on saying that that's really nothing compared to the little five minutes at a time
455000	458000	People sneak on reading Wikipedia from their desk
458000	459000	Right
459000	465000	So they're using it as a scapegoat and as an excuse to ban Google
465000	466000	You know what
466000	467000	From work sites
467000	468000	We're free form tonight
468000	470000	Let me jump over to Twitter real quick
470000	472000	I'm going to jump over to Twitter real quick
472000	475000	And read one of the tweets we got earlier
475000	478000	Even though we're not live and we don't have the chatters tonight
478000	479000	We did post on Twitter
479000	480000	Hey give us stories
480000	482000	We'll still try to interact with you the best we can
482000	484000	Because you know we can't just go to all games and say
484000	485000	We want to be live right now
485000	487000	Because I think there's another show on right now
487000	491000	It was from Dr. Noire
491000	492000	Dr. N-O-I-R
492000	493000	Dr. Noire
493000	496000	Here's the fallout from Google's Pac-Man tribute
496000	498000	Sending us a tweet from BBC News
498000	502000	The playable version of the classic video game was put on Google's front page on 21st of May
502000	506000	To celebrate 30 years since the launch of Pac-Man in Japan
506000	511000	Now there were statistics gathered by the software firm Rescue Time
511000	513000	About how much this damn thing was actually played
513000	518000	On a typical day it suggests that most people will do about 22 searches on the Google page
518000	520000	Each one lasts about 11 seconds
520000	522000	But putting Pac-Man on the front page
522000	526000	It boosted that time by an average of about 36 seconds
526000	531000	And that would be based on the browsing habits of 11,000 Rescue Time users
531000	534000	I guess it's the software that companies install on their computers
534000	537000	To know who's being naughty on the internet when they're not supposed to be
537000	540000	And so let's see they did all the math
540000	543000	And they figured that with 504 million unique users
543000	545000	Who visit the main Google page per day
545000	551000	That means 4.8 million hours, 549 years were wasted on Pac-Man
551000	555000	Assuming that people are paid on average $25 an hour
555000	557000	Really?
557000	560000	I know I was like I want to know what that is so I can work there
560000	563000	Or $17.50 if you want to convert it to pounds an hour
563000	569000	This equates to about $120 million in lost productivity
569000	573000	I think that's some fuzzy math there if you ask me but
573000	576000	Well yeah $25 an hour I mean come on
576000	581000	Bottom line people will still waste time on Pac-Man even if it's just 36 seconds
581000	583000	Got Pac-Man fever
583000	586000	Alright so we'll go back to the other tweets later
586000	588000	But I thought that was topical and worth mentioning
588000	590000	So yeah I checked out the Google Pac-Man it was cool
590000	592000	It's topical like hydrocortisone
592000	596000	And it emulated the original Pac-Man pretty well
596000	599000	It was pretty fun except there's this one part where there's the grid a little bit off
599000	604000	Where the last E is because the little place you enter in on the E
604000	608000	Is actually sort of just off center from where the escape door is
608000	610000	Yes and then the G is just weird
610000	613000	Because you have like this dead end tunnel you don't really have on a Pac-Man board usually
613000	616000	I mean it was a great concept
616000	618000	You know what I hope for for the 35th?
618000	620000	Super Pac-Man Google
620000	621000	Lordy
621000	624000	Because Ms. Pac-Man already made a cameo in the other one if you clicked insert coin
624000	625000	Anyway
625000	626000	This is true Rob
626000	628000	Anything else in your gaming week you want to report for us?
628000	631000	I got my Sims 3 working again so I've been playing more Sims
631000	635000	As you can see here I'm back to my hunt for
635000	636000	That's a Sims site?
636000	641000	I thought you were like shopping for like IKEA or something over there
641000	643000	There's people who've actually tried to
643000	647000	Well IKEA and EA had this deal going on for a while
647000	655000	Where they had some of their standard stuff available for Sims 2
655000	658000	Now did your Sims have to actually build it and get frustrated as hell
658000	661000	When they couldn't understand the instructions because they're nothing but pictures?
661000	662000	No
662000	668000	But um there's people who missed the IKEA stuff
668000	670000	And have really gone
670000	673000	Like you know I'm looking at some of the furniture on here
673000	675000	And this is actually some
675000	677000	As a design major Rob
677000	679000	This is actually pretty impressive stuff
679000	683000	If anyone wants to know the sites that I go to for my Sims stuff
683000	685000	I go to The Sims Resource
685000	687000	I actually have a subscription to The Sims Resource
687000	690000	Mod The Sims is good but Stylist Sims
690000	692000	Has got some really
692000	695000	It's got donation stuff and I don't really advocate donation items
695000	697000	You know because you have to pay for them
697000	700000	But at the same time people did put work into this stuff
700000	703000	But there's some absolutely gorgeous design stuff
703000	705000	I would really have in my actual house
705000	708000	Should I be able to afford it ever
708000	711000	I'm surprised Sims doesn't have something like that
711000	714000	I mean in World of Warcraft you can go through certain websites
714000	718000	And you can get an actual figure of your WoW character
718000	720000	From the data it pulls down from the armory
720000	722000	I mean
722000	725000	It's crazy like how interactive some of this stuff is now
725000	727000	I'm surprised you can't buy some of your
727000	730000	Like a fake Sims house that's your actual Sims house
730000	732000	If that makes any sense at all
732000	734000	I know what you mean
734000	737000	You know how like in the fifth grade we used to have to build houses out of balsa wood
737000	739000	For like a school project
739000	740000	I never had to do that
740000	743000	Really? In the fourth grade we had to make missions out of sugar cubes
743000	745000	You were in Alabama
745000	747000	See we had the missions here in California
747000	749000	Did you have to do this in school?
749000	750000	Yeah I had to make a mission
750000	753000	You had to build the missions out of sugar cubes
753000	755000	I think mine had a pasta roof
755000	757000	Cause you know how the roofs of the missions
757000	759000	You know you've seen the California missions on the coast right
759000	762000	They kind of have that very clay wavy look
762000	765000	Well you use like lasagna and you paint it
765000	767000	I made mine out of Legos
767000	770000	Yeah I never had to do that
770000	772000	We would instead
772000	776000	Every so often head down to the museum downtown
776000	778000	Cause keep in mind where I'm from
778000	785000	You just sneeze and you'll hit something that's been around since the 18th century
785000	790000	I was actually showing Loki before you got here some of the old Victorian homes
790000	793000	If you look up Victorian homes, Mobile Alabama
793000	795000	You will see some absolutely gorgeous places
795000	800000	But the museum downtown recreated a lot of these in doll size
800000	802000	Well there's some stuff from the 18th century around here
802000	805000	It's called gold
805000	807000	Did you hear about this big rock
807000	809000	Apparently somebody dug up
809000	811000	Up in Cameron Park or something
811000	813000	Big old gold nugget just hiding in the backyard
813000	815000	My mom keeps telling me that I should go out panning
815000	818000	And I'm like okay you come out to California
818000	820000	In 113 degree weather and you pan
820000	822000	That was another stupid thing we did as kids
822000	826000	We used to go take the bus up to Sutter's Fort or whatever and do gold panning
826000	827000	Sutter's Mill
827000	829000	Or Sutter's Mill sorry Sutter's Fort is the place downtown
829000	831000	We used to actually go out to reservations
831000	832000	Really
832000	833000	I've been to a couple pallets
833000	835000	I go to reservations now but I go gambling
835000	840000	I've actually been to about 5 pallets
840000	845000	We never really had to do anything
845000	851000	I don't want to say stupid but time wasting like that I guess
851000	855000	Because first of all with some of the stupid children
855000	858000	You know parents hated that shit because they had to do half of it
858000	864000	But we did have to do, we had a lot of focus on doing actual full science projects
864000	867000	And experiments and real lab time
867000	870000	The worst was when I got to high school
870000	873000	Because I've talked about this on the show before in my high school
873000	877000	The Whitey McWhite High that I went to that was two thirds Mormon kids
877000	880000	And it was all these rich kids that lived out by the lake
880000	884000	And then like you know I lived in the poor part of town where I came from
884000	889000	So we went to this school I kid you not it was the most undiverse place on the planet
889000	892000	I mean it was tragic
892000	893000	Right from a John Hughes movie
893000	896000	But you know you had all these spoiled ass little rich kids
896000	899000	Like I'm sure they were like hiring people to do their school projects
899000	902000	It was pretty like you know we had to build the houses and stuff
902000	906000	They would be made from like actual stone and all this stuff
906000	908000	And it's just like you spoiled bitch
908000	911000	Mine's made out of popsicle sticks
911000	914000	Where I actually had to eat all the popsicles over the course of like three months
914000	915000	That's the fun part
915000	916000	That's true
916000	919000	Now you can just go to Michael's and get a bag of popsicle sticks
919000	920000	I know
920000	923000	And I'm like god damn ungrateful kids
923000	928000	Who didn't have to realize the value of the popsicles that come with two sticks
928000	930000	Because they're just two popsicles glued together
930000	932000	I don't even remember what they're called
932000	933000	You can get fudgesicles like that
933000	935000	What the hell tangent is this show on right now?
935000	936000	You know what I miss? Pudding pops
936000	938000	They're still around aren't they?
938000	939000	They came back
939000	941000	I miss pudding pop commercials
941000	942000	Those are the best
942000	945000	Dude cause it's all about Bill Cosby
945000	949000	But you know you remember one of my favorite comics ever is Bloom County
949000	952000	And I always liked that um
952000	954000	What was the guy's name?
954000	960000	But his dad Bill Cosby lived in his anxiety closet with pudding pops
960000	964000	Cosby here with a special report from Jello Brand Pudding Pops
964000	966000	Mothers do your kids talk like this?
966000	967000	Chocolate
967000	968000	vanilla
968000	969000	Swirl
969000	973000	Don't worry they're just asking for Jello Pudding Pops Swirls
973000	975000	Good news for your mom and you mom
975000	978000	That wasn't one of the better commercials
978000	979000	Sounds delicious
979000	980000	That was like a fake newscast
980000	981000	I know now you got me fucking hungry
981000	982000	Pudding pops
982000	983000	Rude
983000	985000	Alright um I want to go back a little bit
985000	986000	Something you were mentioning earlier
986000	988000	They even make pudding pops anymore?
988000	990000	I just said they brought them back
990000	992000	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio
992000	993000	Hello Loki
993000	994000	Hey I'm working on the show
994000	995000	Alright fine
995000	999000	Yeah he wants to do this thing called news
999000	1001000	Like we're trying to fucking talk about pudding pops
1001000	1003000	And Loki's concerned with gaming news
1003000	1005000	As if we are a video game talk show
1005000	1007000	When we're done though with the gaming week though
1007000	1009000	I do need to make a plug
1009000	1010000	Or do you want me to do it now?
1010000	1013000	Uh you can do it now but I want to say one other thing about your gaming week
1013000	1015000	Because you said earlier that Portal is a bitch to control on the computer
1015000	1016000	Yes
1016000	1018000	I want to give you a pro tip awesome and a lot of people forget about this
1018000	1019000	Controller?
1019000	1020000	Xbox 360 controllers
1020000	1022000	They're USB you can plug them right in
1022000	1024000	If you have a wired one
1024000	1028000	I honestly think the wired 360 controllers are almost a better purchase
1028000	1029000	Than the wireless ones
1029000	1031000	At least have one you know
1031000	1032000	I think I've got one
1032000	1035000	Yeah I have one I think I have like three controllers and one of them is wired
1035000	1038000	And it's great because I can go to the computer and use it there
1038000	1040000	And it's pretty awesome
1040000	1042000	But I have kind of gotten the hang of doing some of the puzzles
1042000	1045000	Just I keep forgetting that I look
1045000	1048000	Well see I've got a thumb track ball on my mouse
1048000	1052000	So looking around with the track ball is kind of difficult for me
1052000	1054000	And then remembering that you know
1054000	1057000	I wish it's just that I could have my action button
1057000	1059000	Like in Resident Evil back in the day
1059000	1061000	And hold my action button and turn around and walk
1061000	1063000	You know but meh
1063000	1064000	Okay you want to plug something
1064000	1066000	I think I know what you want to plug
1066000	1068000	And if it is what I think it is then cool
1068000	1070000	I was wondering when we could say something about this
1070000	1075000	Well there is a new website that is currently being worked on
1075000	1079000	By our dear Tiara as we know on the show
1079000	1081000	You know as Mar and Marvel
1081000	1085000	It's geek-life.com
1085000	1088000	And the site launches on the 1st
1088000	1093000	And I do an article on there one called Geek Cube
1093000	1098000	Where it's you know about being a geek working in a cubicle
1098000	1101000	And you know but we're
1101000	1106000	Instead of being game specific or you know
1106000	1108000	Anime specific or something
1108000	1110000	We're geek total geek
1110000	1112000	Just nerdy geeky dorky fun
1112000	1114000	Nerdy geeky dorky fun that's right
1114000	1116000	I wonder if that domain name is taken
1116000	1117000	Nerdy geeky dorky fun
1117000	1118000	No competition please
1118000	1120000	But we are looking for people to contribute
1120000	1122000	So if you have something that you want to share
1122000	1124000	If you want to write an article
1124000	1127000	We do however ask that you use a spell checker
1127000	1129000	Someone to proofread it
1129000	1132000	Because if you don't then we're going to be brutal
1132000	1134000	I'll try to contribute once in a while
1134000	1136000	If you lovely ladies will have me
1136000	1138000	Of course we'll have you for dinner
1138000	1141000	Or something related because that's what I know
1141000	1144000	I'll do a wow column
1144000	1147000	Well I'm going to have other side projects too
1147000	1149000	Coming up and I know you and I have been talking about one
1149000	1152000	Hopefully E3 this year will have a press conference of our own
1152000	1153000	It'll be fun
1153000	1154000	Good stuff in the future
1154000	1158000	Well the other thing too is that I'm planning on doing a DIY
1158000	1161000	Segment you know maybe once a week
1161000	1164000	On there too about doing little do it yourself projects
1164000	1166000	You know how to decoupage
1166000	1167000	Oh god geek decoupage
1167000	1168000	It's geek decoupage
1168000	1170000	Dude I've got my bathhouse picture back there
1170000	1171000	That's pretty cool
1171000	1172000	That's art geek decoupage
1172000	1175000	But yeah but I mean that's the general thing so
1175000	1176000	Alright let's move on with gaming weeks
1176000	1179000	Also anyone out there looking for designer
1179000	1180000	Hire me
1180000	1182000	Low key how was your gaming week
1182000	1185000	It was good I didn't play a whole lot though
1185000	1188000	I played basically well two things
1188000	1191000	But one whatever anyways
1191000	1194000	Red Dead Redemption playing a lot of that
1194000	1195000	Grand Theft Tours
1195000	1200000	Been playing mostly System Link multiplayer
1200000	1202000	Because we were playing it at work
1202000	1205000	And it's been pretty fun
1205000	1208000	You can do little gang missions and stuff
1208000	1211000	And join a posse and kill people
1211000	1215000	And you get experience which unlocks more characters you can play as
1215000	1219000	And more mounts and more weapons
1219000	1220000	So that's all kind of fun
1220000	1224000	The first kind of real day that we decided to go play that
1224000	1227000	We were running around fighting bears with knives
1227000	1231000	Which is funny because the willing critters seem to team up against you
1231000	1234000	In fact there was one point where I had a coyote
1234000	1237000	A boar and a bear chasing after me
1237000	1240000	Coyote didn't really do much but the boar was really quick
1240000	1244000	And knocked me over and then left me to get eaten by the bear
1244000	1245000	So that sucked
1245000	1247000	And then the cougars are little fuckers
1247000	1251000	They chase after you really fast and keep killing me
1251000	1254000	Is Courtney Cox one of the cougars?
1254000	1255000	Maybe
1257000	1261000	I didn't name any of them so I guess one of them could be Courtney Cox
1263000	1266000	Then of course other than that I've played more Grand Theft Auto
1266000	1269000	And that's been pretty fun
1269000	1272000	The major part I've been working on stuff with Grand Theft Auto
1272000	1276000	Like I mentioned before is I'm working on creating another modded game
1276000	1278000	For us to play at work
1278000	1281000	And the major achievement that I was able to accomplish this week
1281000	1284000	Is that I figured out how to edit the map
1284000	1287000	In Grand Theft Auto on the console
1287000	1291000	Which as far as I'm aware now has never been done before
1291000	1293000	So that's been pretty awesome
1293000	1298000	And I ran into some roadblocks before with stuff being rotated weird
1298000	1300000	But I actually figured that all out last night
1300000	1303000	So I'm ready to create all sorts of crazy stuff
1303000	1306000	Including giant loop-de-loops and stuff like that
1306000	1308000	Lots of ramps
1309000	1311000	But yeah, back to Red Dead Redemption though
1311000	1313000	That game is so glitchy
1313000	1315000	It's just hilarious
1315000	1317000	I was playing today, called my horse over
1317000	1321000	And the horse came galloping at me at full speed
1321000	1324000	Off a cliff to its death
1324000	1326000	Bounced in front of me
1326000	1329000	And then bounced off another cliff
1329000	1331000	I'm like what the hell
1331000	1333000	I've seen some angry tweets about
1333000	1336000	I think I saw a tweet earlier this week that was like
1336000	1338000	Did anybody QA test this game?
1338000	1340000	Well there was some other ones
1340000	1342000	Like there was one of the missions that we were doing
1342000	1344000	The first posse mission that we did
1344000	1346000	We were going after this one gang
1346000	1349000	We had to destroy their ammo caches
1349000	1352000	And so after you destroy the second one
1352000	1354000	There's reinforcements that are sent after you
1354000	1358000	Well for whatever reason they decided to spawn up on the hill
1358000	1360000	And they jumped to their death
1360000	1362000	And it was awesome
1362000	1364000	It has problems with cliffs
1364000	1366000	It just doesn't understand them sometimes
1366000	1368000	And so it was just like kept hearing this
1368000	1370000	Ahhhhhh
1370000	1372000	See people die
1372000	1374000	It's like Toons is the driving horse
1374000	1376000	It's awesome
1376000	1378000	And then there's been other videos I've seen that have problems
1378000	1380000	Where different objects are spawning on different characters
1380000	1382000	So for example
1382000	1384000	Instead of your mount that's a donkey
1384000	1386000	You have a woman
1386000	1388000	So you're riding around on a woman that sounds like a donkey
1388000	1390000	And has a horse face
1390000	1392000	I think I saw something like that on the internet once
1392000	1394000	Yes
1394000	1396000	And then some other
1396000	1398000	Crows that are actually people
1398000	1400000	So they're like flying around
1400000	1402000	And flapping their arms and stuff
1402000	1404000	And that's pretty funny
1404000	1406000	And I think the funniest one I saw
1406000	1408000	Other than the cougar man
1408000	1410000	Was the dog
1410000	1412000	Bounty hunter
1412000	1414000	Like a real dog
1414000	1416000	Like a coyote
1416000	1418000	So it was this coyote running around carrying a rifle
1418000	1420000	That's pretty funny
1420000	1422000	Oh and there's a wonderful glitch where you can
1422000	1424000	Crouch against a wall and get shot up into space
1424000	1426000	So should I buy it?
1426000	1428000	There's great reviews and everything
1428000	1430000	It's a lot of fun
1430000	1432000	There's tons of people on there to play with
1432000	1434000	Grand Theft Tourist Rob
1434000	1436000	And if you don't want to play with those people
1436000	1438000	You can always start a private game
1438000	1440000	And just mess around or go on missions
1440000	1442000	I don't like to play with strangers
1442000	1444000	I'll play with people on my friends list
1444000	1446000	And you guys and the listeners
1446000	1448000	What if the strangers want to play with you?
1448000	1450000	No
1450000	1452000	No means no
1452000	1454000	Alright
1454000	1456000	Kind of piggybacking on that and going into my gaming week
1456000	1458000	As part of this whole Oregon thing
1458000	1460000	You know they don't have sales tax in Oregon
1460000	1462000	I'm making a list of games
1462000	1464000	I want to buy while I'm up in Oregon
1464000	1466000	I'm going to buy that
1466000	1468000	I think
1468000	1470000	That's kind of like on the bubble so to speak
1470000	1472000	But I definitely want to get Blur
1472000	1474000	I want to get Split Second
1474000	1476000	Is Split Second cool?
1476000	1478000	Yeah, Dan loves it
1478000	1480000	Alan Wake I hear is pretty awesome
1480000	1482000	Somebody described it as like a Twin Peaks
1482000	1484000	Type video game
1484000	1486000	I realized all you all were
1486000	1488000	All big on, well not you guys specifically
1488000	1490000	Just the general, if Twitter is any indication
1490000	1492000	Of where the world's at
1492000	1494000	Everybody went nucking futs over the Lost finale
1494000	1496000	This weekend, which ironically was on Sunday night
1496000	1498000	I think there was actually a tweet out there
1498000	1500000	That said, you guys cancelled the show
1500000	1502000	To go watch the Lost finale
1502000	1504000	I don't watch Lost
1504000	1506000	I watch good shows
1506000	1508000	I'm not hating on Lost
1508000	1510000	Any show that gets people talking as much as that show did
1510000	1512000	Is doing something right
1512000	1514000	But I didn't watch the first few episodes
1514000	1516000	And it's one of those shows where if you don't watch the first few episodes
1516000	1518000	You're fucked, it's not going to make any sense
1518000	1520000	So I never watched it
1520000	1522000	If I can interject, back to Alan Wake
1522000	1524000	Dan described it as
1526000	1528000	Oh great, what's that game?
1528000	1530000	Silent Hill meets Max Payne
1530000	1532000	Interesting
1532000	1534000	Sounds good, no, well I was going to say
1534000	1536000	Before Lost, way back when
1536000	1538000	In the 90's there was a little show called Twin Peaks
1538000	1540000	It was awesome
1540000	1542000	And it was a total like WTF
1542000	1544000	Mind trip as well, it didn't last very long sadly
1544000	1546000	They really screwed with it
1546000	1548000	On the time slots and they answered
1548000	1550000	The show's biggest question
1550000	1552000	Who killed Laura Palmer way too soon
1552000	1554000	And so that kind of killed the show when that happened
1554000	1556000	But I say that because
1556000	1558000	I love that show and if there's any video game
1558000	1560000	Being remotely compared to that show
1560000	1562000	I'm all about it, so I'll check it out
1562000	1564000	Yeah, so I'm making this list
1564000	1566000	And then my goal is to just go hit up a GameStop
1566000	1568000	Or Fry's or whatever they have up there
1568000	1570000	And just go to town
1570000	1572000	What's the big thing they have up there?
1572000	1574000	Fred Meyer
1574000	1576000	Those ginormous stores
1576000	1578000	That they have I guess
1578000	1580000	Go check out one of those
1580000	1582000	So that's the plan
1582000	1584000	As far as my actual gaming week in games I've been playing
1584000	1586000	Not a whole lot this week, of course more
1586000	1588000	But I want to say something on that in a minute
1588000	1590000	Alan hit 80 this week
1590000	1592000	So I'm very happy and proud for him
1592000	1594000	But now that he has hit 80
1594000	1596000	I think I'm going to, believe it or not
1596000	1598000	Scale back on WoW a little bit
1598000	1600000	And I am making it my summer goal
1600000	1602000	Before Labor Day
1602000	1604000	To actually beat
1604000	1606000	And this is a big deal for me
1606000	1608000	I mean actually beat from start to finish
1608000	1610000	Three games
1610000	1612000	And I realize that might sound like nothing
1612000	1614000	But this is me we're talking about
1614000	1616000	For me to actually complete
1616000	1618000	A role playing game or an adventure game
1618000	1620000	Or something like that is a BFD
1620000	1622000	Because I have the worst gamer ADD
1622000	1624000	I will start a game and play it for an hour and go somewhere else
1624000	1626000	No I have not
1626000	1628000	See!
1628000	1630000	That's the problem
1630000	1632000	You know you gotta let me borrow it
1632000	1634000	So WoW will be
1634000	1636000	Scaled back
1636000	1638000	I'll still do the raids with the guild
1638000	1640000	And play with Alan for at least an hour
1640000	1642000	Several times a week and so forth
1642000	1644000	And actually beat three games
1644000	1646000	And I don't mean like beating
1646000	1648000	What's something like really easy
1648000	1650000	That takes like five seconds to beat
1650000	1652000	You know like
1652000	1654000	Well no I don't think that would be one of the games anyway
1654000	1656000	But uh
1656000	1658000	Like Final Fight
1658000	1660000	I played in an hour
1660000	1662000	I beat Final Fight that doesn't count
1662000	1664000	That takes like an hour
1664000	1666000	I'm going to beat three adventure RPG
1666000	1668000	Something games
1668000	1670000	So I don't know what yet
1670000	1672000	But I want you guys
1672000	1674000	As my gamer nerd buddies
1674000	1676000	Here in studio to hold me to it
1676000	1678000	And if I'm lagging
1678000	1680000	I need verbal lashings
1680000	1682000	Do you think you can do that Dark Sakura?
1682000	1684000	Verbal lashings?
1684000	1686000	I'll point at you and laugh
1686000	1688000	Well I'm down for that
1688000	1690000	I'm going to try Alan Wake
1690000	1692000	And if I like it that will probably be one of the three
1692000	1694000	But I'll let you know
1694000	1696000	Because I might not like it I don't know
1696000	1698000	And I might say no I legitimately do not want to play this to completion
1698000	1700000	But a game like Final Fantasy 13
1700000	1702000	Really ought to be one of the three
1702000	1704000	Well beat it and then lend it to me
1704000	1706000	Get his copy
1706000	1708000	Whoever beats it first let me borrow it
1708000	1710000	Sure
1710000	1712000	I'll tell you right now
1712000	1714000	I want to play it on PS3
1714000	1716000	I'm out
1716000	1718000	Oh I have the PS3 version so I'll have to beat it and then let you borrow it
1718000	1720000	Alright I'm going to beat it yet
1720000	1722000	You beat it yet Rob
1722000	1724000	Fair enough
1724000	1726000	Someone else needs to get me to Cydia
1726000	1728000	Other stuff in my gaming week
1728000	1730000	Game Room I'm still playing the crap out of that
1730000	1732000	And River Raid came out today
1732000	1734000	It's rare that we have the show mid-week
1734000	1736000	Where I can talk about releases as they happen
1736000	1738000	River Raid was a classic classic Atari 2600 game made by Activision
1738000	1740000	My Activision room has like six Activision games in it right now
1740000	1742000	It's crazy
1742000	1744000	I've literally bought like ten games in Game Room
1744000	1746000	I've spent
1746000	1748000	If you say like three to five dollars a game
1748000	1750000	Most of them I only paid three
1750000	1752000	Four but there's a few that I also play on the PC
1752000	1754000	So I bought the upgrade
1754000	1756000	That means I've spent like thirty five bucks on this game so far
1756000	1758000	Which you might want to point and laugh at me
1758000	1760000	Fine ha ha go ahead
1760000	1762000	But I'm getting my money's worth
1762000	1764000	I'm playing the games quite a bit
1764000	1766000	They are cheaper than virtual console games
1766000	1768000	They are
1768000	1770000	And I'm having fun with it
1770000	1772000	You know like Bobby and I have had these friendly little competitions on some games
1772000	1774000	And you guys know Bradley
1774000	1776000	Arcadian
1776000	1778000	Dude did you know he was in the top twenty for Time Pilot earlier this week
1778000	1780000	Really?
1780000	1782000	Yeah he's pretty good at that stuff
1782000	1784000	He wiped my score on Mega Maniac
1784000	1786000	But I'm still number one
1786000	1788000	On Pitfall and Crystal Castles
1788000	1790000	So anyhow
1790000	1792000	I made it up to rank sixty eight
1792000	1794000	In Grand Theft Auto
1794000	1796000	Did you? Well I thought you were sixty seven a couple weeks ago
1796000	1798000	Yeah I keep losing the game here
1798000	1800000	It sucks because it takes me like twenty games
1800000	1802000	To get up a few ranks
1802000	1804000	And like all I have to do is lose to one person
1804000	1806000	Not even lose the game
1806000	1808000	Come in second, buy like a few bucks
1808000	1810000	And it drops me down a bunch
1810000	1812000	It's really unfair
1812000	1814000	But I'm doing pretty good
1814000	1816000	I haven't lost a game in a while
1816000	1818000	Alright let's get to housekeeping tonight
1818000	1820000	Of course our Twitter
1820000	1822000	Twitter.com slash olr
1822000	1824000	We're going to get to the Twitter topics in a little bit
1824000	1826000	And then also our Facebook
1826000	1828000	Please add us there
1828000	1830000	Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio
1830000	1832000	Apparently we have a MySpace still too
1832000	1834000	But if I haven't added you to MySpace
1834000	1836000	I check it like maybe once every three months
1836000	1838000	So don't be sad
1838000	1840000	Just send us a friend request there
1840000	1842000	Although I ought to just delete it
1842000	1844000	But any promotion is good promotion I suppose
1844000	1846000	Okay
1846000	1848000	So how about gaming news
1848000	1850000	We'll get into that a little bit
1850000	1852000	Okay there's like
1852000	1854000	I don't know if you have anything you want to talk about Jamie
1854000	1856000	I know Loki's got a bunch
1856000	1858000	He was a good guy earlier and went through the show
1858000	1860000	There's like two things I want to talk about tonight
1860000	1862000	I'll start with the one that has been big today
1862000	1864000	And I think yesterday was when the buzz started
1864000	1866000	Let's talk Rock Band 3
1866000	1868000	Alright so here's what happened
1868000	1870000	The Green Day Rock Band demo
1870000	1872000	Came out on Xbox Live and PlayStation
1872000	1874000	And you know it's got a couple songs
1874000	1876000	You can play and check out what Green Day Rock Band's all about
1876000	1878000	But the biggest splash of this
1878000	1880000	Was that there is a teaser page
1880000	1882000	I guess at the very end of the demo
1882000	1884000	That shows you know how in
1884000	1886000	Rock Band you have little icons
1886000	1888000	You have like a little guitar icon
1888000	1890000	A little bass icon, a little microphone for the singer
1890000	1892000	And little drums
1892000	1894000	Well guess what next to all these icons
1894000	1896000	And the number three
1896000	1898000	Is a little keyboard
1898000	1900000	And it looks like at first glance
1900000	1902000	They are going to add keyboards
1902000	1904000	To Rock Band 3
1904000	1906000	And when I first heard this news
1906000	1908000	I got really excited because
1908000	1910000	You know Orange Lawns Radio
1910000	1912000	We started as a music game based show
1912000	1914000	And we used to play games like
1914000	1916000	Drummania, Guitar Freaks
1916000	1918000	And some of the games that inspired
1918000	1920000	You could say Rock Band in some ways
1920000	1922000	Well the one I always loved
1922000	1924000	That I thought was really under appreciated
1924000	1926000	Because they killed it off way too quick
1926000	1928000	After only three versions
1928000	1930000	Which I know sounds like a lot but when you consider
1930000	1932000	2DX is on
1932000	1934000	19 or 19 is being tested right now
1934000	1936000	And then Guitar Freaks
1936000	1938000	Is on like
1938000	1940000	16 or 17 I mean there is a crap ton of these games
1940000	1942000	Keyboard Mania
1942000	1944000	Which I was actually good at
1944000	1946000	I could beat the hardest song in the game
1946000	1948000	I couldn't do it on doubles
1948000	1950000	I guess that would really be the hardest mode in the game
1950000	1952000	We have a friend who is really good in doubles
1952000	1954000	Oh yeah
1954000	1956000	I would like to think I was one of the better Keyboard Mania players
1956000	1958000	I could do it
1958000	1960000	I was good at it
1960000	1962000	I had to pick it up so I could play with you
1962000	1964000	And I was pissed when they discontinued it
1964000	1966000	Because it was like the one Bomani game
1966000	1968000	I was actually pretty good at
1968000	1970000	So I heard this news about Rock Band 3
1970000	1972000	And I was like oh my god
1972000	1974000	They are actually going to do it
1974000	1976000	They are going to put out a keyboard
1976000	1978000	Oh my god I'm like whoa this is going to be great
1978000	1980000	They are going to be great for this
1980000	1982000	I'm all excited right
1982000	1984000	Well today I guess a news story came out that says
1984000	1986000	Well
1986000	1988000	It might not actually be a keyboard
1988000	1990000	It might be a key-tar
1992000	1994000	Meaning the guitar
1994000	1996000	And the keyboard mixed together
1996000	1998000	Meaning like
1998000	2000000	If you see one of those old ass pictures
2000000	2002000	Of like I don't know Journey
2002000	2004000	From the 80's with a big
2004000	2006000	Hair
2006000	2008000	Playing a keyboard on a guitar
2008000	2010000	They really needed to make it just a keyboard
2010000	2012000	I realize a lot of you think that's cool
2012000	2014000	This is how you freeze pop the game
2014000	2016000	Or just any 80's
2016000	2018000	Band practically had that
2018000	2020000	And I realize a lot of you think it's cool
2020000	2022000	But boy did that feel like
2022000	2024000	A punch in the stomach
2024000	2026000	Like oh we are going to do this really cool thing
2026000	2028000	And then we are going to make it so stupid
2028000	2030000	By making it a key-tar
2030000	2032000	Whatever I'll play it anyway
2032000	2034000	It's one of those things where
2034000	2036000	I could always just like put the key-tar
2036000	2038000	On the ground and do it that way
2038000	2040000	And just pretend I don't see the stem
2040000	2042000	But I don't know if that'll work
2042000	2044000	I'm thinking it's just screen real estate
2044000	2046000	How the hell are you going to do keyboards
2046000	2048000	With three other
2048000	2050000	How are you going to do a five person band
2050000	2052000	Or even an eight person band
2052000	2054000	Well let's see three singers
2054000	2056000	Guitar
2056000	2058000	Bass
2058000	2060000	Drums and a keyboard
2060000	2062000	So you'd have a band of like
2062000	2064000	I have a feeling
2064000	2066000	Call it a gut
2066000	2068000	But if they do key-tar I think it'll scroll
2068000	2070000	Sideways
2070000	2072000	I think that's how they'll do it
2072000	2074000	They'll have vocals at top and key-tar on the bottom
2074000	2076000	And then the normal tracks in the middle
2076000	2078000	I have nothing to base that off of
2078000	2080000	Obviously this is going to be at E3
2080000	2082000	Obviously
2082000	2084000	And we'll know more then
2084000	2086000	But until then it's all speculation really
2086000	2088000	Except for the fact that you know what
2088000	2090000	Putting that little symbol of a keyboard in the game
2090000	2092000	Is a question accomplished
2092000	2094000	People are talking rock band and oh what could this be
2094000	2096000	Most importantly
2096000	2098000	Something that Guitar Hero is not doing
2098000	2100000	That was good of them to keep this a secret
2100000	2102000	For a while because that way
2102000	2104000	Now it's something to differentiate it from its biggest competitor
2104000	2106000	Pretty smart
2106000	2108000	But you know
2108000	2110000	We shall see when we shall see
2110000	2112000	Apparently there's something else in this too
2112000	2114000	About like there's going to be a mode
2114000	2116000	That's super difficult
2116000	2118000	But it's just to emulate like actual guitar
2118000	2120000	In drum playing or something
2120000	2122000	I'd heard something about that
2122000	2124000	So that could be interesting
2124000	2126000	What I would really most like to see
2130000	2132000	Is them keep, especially for rock band
2132000	2136000	Is them keep in the harmony
2136000	2138000	The three part harmony
2138000	2140000	That they had in Beatles rock band
2140000	2142000	I think they confirmed that
2142000	2144000	And one of the dudes slipped up at PAX East
2144000	2146000	I remember this happening because
2146000	2148000	My friends were there at that panel
2148000	2150000	He was there when the guy said
2150000	2152000	Oh well rock band 3 has harmonies
2152000	2154000	And then they were all like shut up
2154000	2156000	It doesn't matter
2156000	2158000	It's confirmed because also
2158000	2160000	It's in Green Day rock band
2160000	2162000	Oh because it's got the mic
2162000	2164000	And it's got three mics
2164000	2166000	I really really hope all the songs
2166000	2168000	Are still backwards compatible
2168000	2170000	I don't expect them to go back
2170000	2172000	And add harmonies and keytar
2172000	2174000	Or whatever they do to all of them
2174000	2176000	I would still be thrilled if at least
2176000	2178000	I could just have one massive library
2178000	2180000	It's gonna be one massive library
2180000	2182000	Obviously the newer songs
2182000	2184000	Will support newer things
2184000	2186000	It'll be interesting to see
2186000	2188000	What they do with the Green Day rock band
2188000	2190000	Because those do support three part harmonies
2190000	2192000	I believe
2192000	2194000	I think it would be cool if they just went back
2194000	2196000	And maybe take the top
2196000	2198000	20 download songs
2198000	2200000	Cause they know
2200000	2202000	What 20 songs have sold more
2202000	2204000	Than any other
2204000	2206000	Take the top 20 and add support
2206000	2208000	Or maybe not all of them
2208000	2210000	Would lend themselves very well to keytar
2210000	2212000	Or harmony
2212000	2214000	So take the top 20 songs that would
2214000	2216000	And just go back and touch those up
2216000	2218000	That's gonna be enough to get people excited
2218000	2220000	People were speculating
2220000	2222000	Because now that you have the three part harmonies
2222000	2224000	And keyboard
2224000	2226000	Bohemian Rhapsody
2226000	2228000	That is hot
2228000	2230000	That is hot
2230000	2232000	Just the fact that Queen could be in the game
2232000	2234000	At all, well actually I think there's a few songs
2234000	2236000	But just Bohemian Rhapsody would be amazing
2236000	2238000	I would really like to see
2238000	2240000	At least some of the Beatles rock band stuff carry over
2240000	2242000	Is the Van Halen Guitar Hero thing exclusive
2242000	2244000	Because you know if there's
2244000	2246000	Guitar, you know if keyboards are in this
2246000	2248000	At all in any way shape
2248000	2250000	Or form
2250000	2252000	It has to have jump
2252000	2254000	It has to have
2254000	2256000	Do do do do do
2256000	2258000	Like how can you have one of those plastic
2258000	2260000	Keyboards sitting in your house and not want to play that
2262000	2264000	It's gonna be awesome
2264000	2266000	I'm definitely gonna be picking this up
2266000	2268000	One of the local stores here in Sacramento Guitar Center
2268000	2270000	I think that's a nationwide store
2270000	2272000	They actually had a sign up at one of their stores
2272000	2274000	By the keyboard display
2274000	2276000	That says, the following songs are
2276000	2278000	Banned, if you play this song
2278000	2280000	You will be kicked out of the store
2280000	2282000	Chopsticks
2282000	2284000	Fur Elise
2284000	2286000	And jump
2286000	2288000	I'm surprised they don't have the axle fully themed
2288000	2290000	No stairway denied
2290000	2292000	It's that whole scene exactly
2292000	2294000	But for real
2294000	2296000	Anyhow
2296000	2298000	I'm excited, I'm glad to see they're shaking it up
2298000	2300000	Beyond just making it prettier
2300000	2302000	For Rock Band 3, that's gonna be pretty cool
2302000	2304000	Another piece of plastic crap
2304000	2306000	To have in my house
2306000	2308000	I saw my instruments at work
2308000	2310000	In our game room
2310000	2312000	I don't have room in my little apartment
2312000	2314000	I already had to downsize for my house
2314000	2316000	I have bullshit everywhere
2316000	2318000	Another plastic instrument is the last fucking thing
2318000	2320000	I need right now
2320000	2322000	The thing I love
2322000	2324000	And it's an awesome investment
2324000	2326000	Was my drum bag
2326000	2328000	Cause I can keep my drums and all the other stuff in there
2328000	2330000	Except for the guitars, the guitars are separate
2330000	2332000	I have two guitars
2332000	2334000	Or a guitar and a bass
2334000	2336000	I do need to get a new guitar though
2336000	2338000	Cause it's crapping out
2338000	2340000	Funny enough though
2340000	2342000	Speaking of quality
2342000	2344000	The guitar 2 guitar that I still have
2344000	2346000	Is fucking awesome
2346000	2348000	It still works great
2348000	2350000	The guitar 2 guitar I have works
2350000	2352000	And I did upgrade to a guitar hero 3
2352000	2354000	Because a while back I was having enough friends
2354000	2356000	Over where we needed to have a bass
2356000	2358000	So I just bought a guitar hero 3 guitar
2358000	2360000	Cause they were really cheap
2360000	2362000	And now it's wireless, it works awesome
2362000	2364000	They're fine
2364000	2366000	Hopefully now with mad cats
2366000	2368000	Working on the actual instruments
2368000	2370000	I'm hoping that they'll be a little bit better
2370000	2372000	It's by mad cats
2372000	2374000	And I loved it
2374000	2376000	It's working really well
2376000	2378000	And please tell me my logic makes sense
2378000	2380000	That there will be a
2380000	2382000	Game plus keyboard only pack
2382000	2384000	They're seeing that there's gonna be all sorts of
2384000	2386000	Configurations
2386000	2388000	If you have like one thing then you can get this
2388000	2390000	And they're gonna do all sorts of different bundles
2390000	2392000	Which will make it wonderfully confusing
2392000	2394000	Then I'm happy
2394000	2396000	Alright
2396000	2398000	The other big story I wanted to talk about
2398000	2400000	The armory
2400000	2402000	For World of Warcraft
2402000	2404000	Is now available on the iPhone
2404000	2406000	I'm sorry not just the armory
2406000	2408000	But the auction house
2408000	2410000	Oh cause I was gonna say I had the armory when I was playing
2410000	2412000	Sorry I mean the auction house is now built into the armory
2412000	2414000	It's a beta test thing going on
2414000	2416000	That they just opened up to all realms a couple days ago
2416000	2418000	And you can now
2418000	2420000	Manage basic auctions
2420000	2422000	From your iPhone
2422000	2424000	But it's a beta test because the plan is
2424000	2426000	This is going to be a pay feature
2426000	2428000	They're gonna charge I think they were saying
2428000	2430000	3, 4 bucks a month
2430000	2432000	I think it was 3 bucks a month
2432000	2434000	For this feature after the beta
2434000	2436000	Test period is over which you guess is gonna be
2436000	2438000	What about 4 to 6 weeks
2438000	2440000	And I have to
2440000	2442000	Admit I go back and forth on this
2442000	2444000	Because when I first downloaded it and played with it
2444000	2446000	I was like this is clunky
2446000	2448000	This is kind of stupid
2448000	2450000	By the way it's not just I should say this
2450000	2452000	It's not just your iPhone
2452000	2454000	But you can do it on the web now if you go to the armory
2454000	2456000	Website and I imagine if there's an armory
2456000	2458000	App for crack berries and androids
2458000	2460000	Or whatever other smart phones there are
2460000	2462000	This feature is going to be built into this too
2462000	2464000	It's just a matter of time
2464000	2466000	But when I was playing with this on my iPhone
2466000	2468000	Of course the day it came out I had to download it check it out
2468000	2470000	But when I was playing with the feature I have to admit I was like
2470000	2472000	This is kind of clunky
2472000	2474000	This is not that great
2474000	2476000	I can't have auctioneer
2476000	2478000	The add on I use to be able to undercut
2478000	2480000	Everybody else this way
2480000	2482000	It's just not that great and I just kind of
2482000	2484000	Wrote it off and said I'm not really going to use this
2484000	2486000	This is stupid whatever
2486000	2488000	If this is how Blizzard wants to waste their time then so be it
2488000	2490000	They'll be somebody that wants to use this
2490000	2492000	But then
2492000	2494000	Damn it I found myself at work the other day
2494000	2496000	On lunch thank you very much
2496000	2498000	And I like to get away from my desk
2498000	2500000	At lunch because you know the last thing you want to do
2500000	2502000	During your free time is be at your desk
2502000	2504000	Staring at your big pile of work to do
2504000	2506000	So I was in a little break room during lunch
2506000	2508000	Eating my lunch and you know I'll kind of sit there
2508000	2510000	And play on my phone maybe look at a game
2510000	2512000	Sure enough I go on the armory
2512000	2514000	And I start looking around
2516000	2518000	I managed to clear out my mailbox
2518000	2520000	That was full of sold auctions
2520000	2522000	Relist some of the things that didn't sell
2522000	2524000	And just kind of manage all that
2524000	2526000	And clear out my inbox full of crap
2526000	2528000	On my lunch and I was just like
2528000	2530000	Oh my god what am I doing
2530000	2532000	What am I doing
2532000	2534000	I'm like playing World of Warcraft
2534000	2536000	Without being at home
2536000	2538000	This is terrible
2538000	2540000	That's bad it's bad
2540000	2542000	Anyhow
2542000	2544000	It's not something
2544000	2546000	Extra that I can't already
2546000	2548000	Get in the game and therefore
2548000	2550000	I don't see worth paying three dollars
2550000	2552000	A month is really something I want to
2552000	2554000	Do I mean I guess there's people
2554000	2556000	That are more into the economics that want to do
2556000	2558000	This stuff and if they want to pay for it then so
2558000	2560000	Be it whatever it's a feature I
2560000	2562000	Just will not be one of them because I don't think I
2562000	2564000	Should have that on my phone to be honest
2564000	2566000	I just don't think I should have that
2566000	2568000	It's not a good thing to have
2568000	2570000	Now thankfully
2570000	2572000	And I say it's kind of a double-edged sword
2572000	2574000	Because you know it's well
2574000	2576000	I'm glad
2576000	2578000	There's not any additional
2578000	2580000	Game features like something extra
2580000	2582000	Because then I'd feel a little bit jilted
2582000	2584000	Because I still held to what I said
2584000	2586000	A couple weeks ago on this show
2586000	2588000	The minute Blizzard starts selling
2588000	2590000	Epics for money I'm out
2590000	2592000	I quit I'm deleting my account well
2592000	2594000	Resigning whatever that day
2594000	2596000	Notice how I can't say I'll delete my account
2596000	2598000	Because it's too much work but I will resign my
2598000	2600000	Warcraft membership that day it's done
2600000	2602000	Um
2602000	2604000	I just can't justify
2604000	2606000	That and I really
2606000	2608000	Hope that's not where they're going I'm a little worried
2608000	2610000	Did you notice how all this started I mean maybe
2610000	2612000	It's just me maybe I can I'm a conspiracy
2612000	2614000	Theorist and what have you call me whatever
2614000	2616000	Names you want but
2616000	2618000	Is it just me or did all this nickel and dime stuff
2618000	2620000	Start happening once Activision bought them
2620000	2622000	I don't think it's just you Rob
2622000	2624000	This all kind of like
2624000	2626000	The sparkle pony
2626000	2628000	The money for faction transfers
2628000	2630000	And all these things
2630000	2632000	And changing your genders and appearance and all this
2632000	2634000	This all started happening when the
2634000	2636000	Activision guys came in they swear
2636000	2638000	Up and down they're not going to sell epics for money
2638000	2640000	I really really hope
2640000	2642000	That's the case because it's
2642000	2644000	It's like starting to push the boundaries a little bit
2644000	2646000	You know what I mean but whatever
2646000	2648000	If you want to pay the money and this is a good feature
2648000	2650000	For you have fun but
2650000	2652000	I just you know I can't install auctioneer on my phone
2652000	2654000	So whatever
2654000	2656000	And that was really it those
2656000	2658000	Are the two big stories I have some other little things
2658000	2660000	I can get to but low key I don't
2660000	2662000	Know what big news stories jumped out at you the past
2662000	2664000	Few days if there's anything you want to jump in at
2664000	2666000	Uh yeah one thing I want to
2666000	2668000	Talk about and it's absolutely
2668000	2670000	Annoying because I have to deal with this on a daily
2670000	2672000	Basis now is
2672000	2674000	The what people are calling
2674000	2676000	Because I guess EA coined
2676000	2678000	The phrase for their stuff
2678000	2680000	Project ten dollar
2680000	2682000	And project ten dollar is different ways
2682000	2684000	That EA can make money off of you basically
2684000	2686000	And the one that's really
2686000	2688000	I guess the most recent way
2688000	2690000	They've decided is that they're
2690000	2692000	Going to have one time
2692000	2694000	Codes with their um
2694000	2696000	Sports games starting off
2696000	2698000	That allow you to play online
2698000	2700000	If you buy the game used
2700000	2702000	You have to pay ten dollars
2702000	2704000	To be able to play
2704000	2706000	The game we talked about this last week
2706000	2708000	I understand that but I'm getting into more stuff
2708000	2710000	Oh dear oh god alright
2710000	2712000	Okay so I'm sitting here going
2712000	2714000	Deja vu no no no
2714000	2716000	There's more stuff we're gonna talk about here
2716000	2718000	Alright um so
2718000	2720000	Yeah thankfully they have the seven
2720000	2722000	Day trial and that's peachy
2722000	2724000	And stuff for video rentals or game
2724000	2726000	Rental stores or whatever well that is cool
2726000	2728000	Um something that's cool
2728000	2730000	And they're the only ones doing that
2730000	2732000	Uh THQ on the other hand
2732000	2734000	Is now they by the way
2734000	2736000	Weren't gonna mention anything until the day
2736000	2738000	Of release for UFC
2738000	2740000	Um but it UFC
2740000	2742000	Had leaked out so unfortunately
2742000	2744000	People found out of it or found out about it
2744000	2746000	They're doing something similar except they're
2746000	2748000	Charging five dollars there is no trial
2748000	2750000	So if you buy the game used you ought to play
2750000	2752000	You know five dollars
2752000	2754000	In order to be able to play online
2754000	2756000	Then there was another one
2756000	2758000	I found out about today
2758000	2760000	Another company which
2760000	2762000	I'm just shocked that they're
2762000	2764000	Jumping on board with this but
2764000	2766000	Um apparently Microsoft
2766000	2768000	With Crackdown 2
2768000	2770000	Will be jumping aboard this um
2770000	2772000	New trend and they will be having a
2772000	2774000	One time fee wait wait wait
2774000	2776000	Wait wait why
2776000	2778000	Am I paying for Xbox Live?
2778000	2780000	Why?
2780000	2782000	If this is if every publisher
2782000	2784000	Is gonna think because you know
2784000	2786000	Now this is just the little
2786000	2788000	Leak in the dam and it's all gonna come crumbling
2788000	2790000	Down after this why am I paying for
2790000	2792000	Xbox Live and another story that
2792000	2794000	You know sorry if you're gonna get to this later but I know this is big
2794000	2796000	Playstation Network
2796000	2798000	Is just everybody's waiting for them to say
2798000	2800000	Something at E3 this year
2800000	2802000	That there's going to be a Playstation Network Plus
2802000	2804000	Or what have you
2804000	2806000	Why am I paying for these services now?
2806000	2808000	If this is the new way I'm gonna have to pay to play online
2808000	2810000	Please do not tell me I need both
2810000	2812000	Xbox Live and the code to play Crackdown
2812000	2814000	Cause that seems ridiculous
2814000	2816000	You do um
2816000	2818000	Oh my god
2818000	2820000	But it's only gonna affect you if you buy
2820000	2822000	Used but I still think it's fucked up
2822000	2824000	That they're double dipping with them
2824000	2826000	You know this stuff they think that they're entitled
2826000	2828000	To a part of the used sales I'm sorry
2828000	2830000	Any other industry you're not
2830000	2832000	Entitled to used sales if I buy
2832000	2834000	A used car I don't have to pay a hundred dollars
2834000	2836000	To like Ford or something for buying
2836000	2838000	My used car you've already made your fucking
2838000	2840000	Money and there's like
2840000	2842000	You know EAs excuses
2842000	2844000	Oh well we're improving our online
2844000	2846000	Services and we're able to offer you
2846000	2848000	More you know download
2848000	2850000	Content and stuff like that yeah more paid
2850000	2852000	Download content that I have to buy from you
2852000	2854000	It's just
2854000	2856000	It's awful
2856000	2858000	You know to sit here and say I'm not
2858000	2860000	Gonna pay for online play would be hypocritical
2860000	2862000	Because I pay twelve dollars or no fourteen dollars
2862000	2864000	Whatever it is I don't even know
2864000	2866000	To play wow you know
2866000	2868000	That's fine I don't have a problem
2868000	2870000	Paying to play online I have a
2870000	2872000	Problem paying twice and I
2872000	2874000	Have a problem paying like all
2874000	2876000	These different uncontrolled amounts now
2876000	2878000	Which okay maybe is a little bit
2878000	2880000	Hypocritical because of the MMOs
2880000	2882000	But generally you know an MMO is gonna cost you
2882000	2884000	And between ten and fifteen
2884000	2886000	But it's just now there's no
2886000	2888000	Fucking control anywhere with this
2888000	2890000	And it really bothers me
2890000	2892000	I need to hear from Microsoft
2892000	2894000	At E3 why I should renew my
2894000	2896000	Xbox Live membership because at this point
2896000	2898000	I'm not going to
2898000	2900000	And I've been a member for like six years now
2900000	2902000	And I'm hoping that there's some sort of misunderstanding
2902000	2904000	But here's how it came about
2904000	2906000	We had a head of a company
2906000	2908000	Might have been Blockbuster Chain
2908000	2910000	Or something like that
2910000	2912000	They were asking about Crackdown 2
2912000	2914000	They were saying well the first Crackdown game was
2914000	2916000	Online only and you know
2916000	2918000	I just wanted to make sure there's a single player aspect
2918000	2920000	To this one and you know of course I was like
2920000	2922000	Well no the first game actually wasn't online only
2922000	2924000	And you know
2924000	2926000	There will be multiplayer and that kind of stuff
2926000	2928000	I highly doubt that
2928000	2930000	Microsoft would jump on board with
2930000	2932000	What they're doing with EA and stuff
2932000	2934000	Because they're already making money off Live
2934000	2936000	Our buyer checked with Microsoft
2936000	2938000	And they're like that's correct
2938000	2940000	There is going to be
2940000	2942000	There's a single player and online
2942000	2944000	And there will be a one time code
2944000	2946000	Wait is this the internet or are you like
2946000	2948000	Breaking news here? No I'm breaking news
2948000	2950000	Oh shit
2950000	2952000	Huh
2952000	2954000	So casually too
2954000	2956000	I know right like
2956000	2958000	He didn't say secret club or nothing this is just out there
2958000	2960000	Alright so I mean I'm hoping
2960000	2962000	That there's a misunderstanding
2962000	2964000	Ok so yeah take with a grain of salt because
2964000	2966000	We're not talking about hardcore
2966000	2968000	Game players with this right
2968000	2970000	We're talking about business people who might be
2970000	2972000	Oopsie doopsieing the facts right
2972000	2974000	Yes and I'm thinking I'm hoping
2974000	2976000	That the one time code thing is similar
2976000	2978000	To what we've seen with some of the other games
2978000	2980000	Like Alan Wake and
2980000	2982000	You know Gears of War 2
2982000	2984000	And stuff like that where the one time code is
2984000	2986000	Download content it's free download content
2986000	2988000	At launch something like that
2988000	2990000	I'm retracting my clause
2990000	2992000	I'm retracting my clause
2992000	2994000	And hoping one of your coworkers is
2994000	2996000	Fucking up big time
2996000	2998000	But if it isn't then that's basically
2998000	3000000	Going to open floodgates because
3000000	3002000	If Microsoft's doing it then everybody's
3002000	3004000	Going to do it because they've basically
3004000	3006000	Been given permission to
3006000	3008000	So I hope
3008000	3010000	That's not the case but you know once again
3010000	3012000	You know I blame a lot of these people
3012000	3014000	That just don't stand up and
3014000	3016000	Complain about this stuff you know
3016000	3018000	They're like oh that's no big deal because you know
3018000	3020000	I'm getting the game used or whatever
3020000	3022000	And you know it's just a few extra dollars
3022000	3024000	Well you know what it's stuff like this
3024000	3026000	See you feel it's okay
3026000	3028000	With different things and now they're going to all
3028000	3030000	Start doing it and pretty soon it's just
3030000	3032000	Going to be something else what else are they going to take out
3032000	3034000	Of their game that they're going to charge you five dollars for
3034000	3036000	You know
3036000	3038000	It's just it's stupid
3038000	3040000	And they're not lowering the price of the game by five dollars
3040000	3042000	Of course not
3042000	3044000	I don't know
3044000	3046000	Yeah I worry about
3046000	3048000	The precedent this might set
3048000	3050000	I understand why EA's
3050000	3052000	Doing this ten dollar thing and I think we talked about
3052000	3054000	This last week and of course other companies
3054000	3056000	Are going to follow but you know my two biggest
3056000	3058000	Issues are A
3058000	3060000	It's not going to stop there
3060000	3062000	Like Loki's saying and B
3062000	3064000	I don't want to have to pay for it twice
3064000	3066000	They need to work it out where
3066000	3068000	The one source is am I paying Microsoft
3068000	3070000	Or am I paying the publishers for this
3070000	3072000	Who's really hosting the servers
3072000	3074000	And it's absolutely bullshit that they're saying that
3074000	3076000	You know oh well it's because
3076000	3078000	We're devl- like THQ's
3078000	3080000	Wonderful official
3080000	3082000	Statement about it THQ is delivering
3082000	3084000	A truly unmatched online gaming
3084000	3086000	Experience for fans of UFC and across all
3086000	3088000	Oh shut up
3088000	3090000	Bullshit uh the main enhancement
3090000	3092000	Of UFC and disputed 2010's
3092000	3094000	Premium online content is a new
3094000	3096000	Fight camp mode in which players can assemble
3096000	3098000	Ranks up to forty people and train
3098000	3100000	Together the significant value add
3100000	3102000	Um value
3102000	3104000	Add to the game as uh
3104000	3106000	Players can uh continually
3106000	3108000	Improve their skills by training
3108000	3110000	With friends and bringing teams from
3110000	3112000	MMA specialists together you know what
3112000	3114000	Though you could have done that and included
3114000	3116000	That with the game as it is so now you're
3116000	3118000	Just basically making an excuse because
3118000	3120000	EA's doing it fuck you EA
3120000	3122000	You know I you were on a good streak for
3122000	3124000	A while there Activision was really making
3124000	3126000	You know themselves look like shit
3126000	3128000	We're all gonna do it but here
3128000	3130000	Here you go you know might as well
3130000	3132000	I'm sure Bobby Kotick's
3132000	3134000	Eyes are lighting up
3134000	3136000	Hey we can charge money for that
3136000	3138000	Uh do you have the story up on PSN Plus
3138000	3140000	Out of curiosity?
3140000	3142000	Uh yeah I do
3142000	3144000	Can you talk about that a little bit?
3144000	3146000	Yes so people are basically um
3146000	3148000	Saying that in fact actually the
3148000	3150000	Sony Computer Entertainment Europe
3150000	3152000	President has been alluding that they're gonna
3152000	3154000	Be doing um upcoming paid
3154000	3156000	Uh Playstation Network subscriptions
3156000	3158000	And uh
3158000	3160000	Of course they won't officially comment on it
3160000	3162000	It says will Playstation Network
3162000	3164000	Become a paying service
3164000	3166000	Um Kazrai stated
3166000	3168000	A few months ago that we were looking at
3168000	3170000	Premium services sit alongside the current
3170000	3172000	Free service
3172000	3174000	And that um objective has not
3174000	3176000	Changed you'll learn more about it very soon
3176000	3178000	So yes they are doing that
3178000	3180000	And uh if I'm hearing it right
3180000	3182000	They're saying we're not gonna charge you to play
3182000	3184000	Games online
3184000	3186000	I'm just trying
3186000	3188000	To think what could this possibly be
3188000	3190000	Besides like core you know what I mean
3190000	3192000	Like I thought core was kind of their
3192000	3194000	Plus thing with the demos and the
3194000	3196000	Little things that come with that
3196000	3198000	Is that just an enhancement of that?
3198000	3200000	Um from what I remember the rumors
3200000	3202000	Have been saying that it's supposed to have
3202000	3204000	Exclusive access to
3204000	3206000	Cross game voice chat which
3206000	3208000	You can do for free in Microsoft service
3208000	3210000	Um it's also
3210000	3212000	They're gonna say that they're gonna be um
3212000	3214000	Including I guess some sort of
3214000	3216000	Cloud based saving system
3216000	3218000	Um I was reading
3218000	3220000	That they're also supposed to be I think offering
3220000	3222000	Uh the ability to
3222000	3224000	Uh purchase
3224000	3226000	A full title of a game first
3226000	3228000	Also they'll be able to play the first hour of download
3228000	3230000	Games for free Yeah that's interesting
3230000	3232000	I'd heard that one something about you can download
3232000	3234000	The whole stinking game and play
3234000	3236000	Like an like every Blu-ray
3236000	3238000	Game will basically have a demo for an hour
3238000	3240000	Like I don't even know how that works
3240000	3242000	I don't know if that's wishful thinking or what
3242000	3244000	Am I I think I'd seen something
3244000	3246000	This is probably another rumor fanboy
3246000	3248000	Wank or whatever but I'd seen something about
3248000	3250000	Playstation 1 games are just gonna be
3250000	3252000	Fucking play whatever you want
3252000	3254000	They're gonna have a rotating
3254000	3256000	A rotating list of PSP minis
3256000	3258000	And Playstation 1 classics, exclusive
3258000	3260000	In game download content, discounts
3260000	3262000	To the Playstation store
3262000	3264000	Um
3264000	3266000	So stuff like that
3266000	3268000	Maybe, maybe, I definitely
3268000	3270000	Want to hear more about it, I mean I
3270000	3272000	We need to separate the fanboy wank from the reality
3272000	3274000	But there's some interesting features in there
3274000	3276000	I can tell you right now when you pay him for this, I don't play on the Playstation
3276000	3278000	Never good enough But now, well now
3278000	3280000	I'm paying for Xbox Live
3280000	3282000	And if this, if, if, if, if, big if
3282000	3284000	Capital I, capital F, if
3284000	3286000	It is true that
3286000	3288000	Crackdown is gonna do the double dip thing
3288000	3290000	And I don't hear
3290000	3292000	From Microsoft what the hell I'm paying for anymore
3292000	3294000	Are you buying Crackdown
3294000	3296000	Used, that's the thing, if you're buying it
3296000	3298000	Used, then yeah it's double dipping
3298000	3300000	If you're buying it new, you get the code
3300000	3302000	You can play the thing
3302000	3304000	So, I don't know
3304000	3306000	Still why am I paying for Xbox Live
3306000	3308000	You know
3308000	3310000	It's still, it's really
3310000	3312000	Kind of a lame thing to be doing because
3312000	3314000	They're like saying, oh we deserve a portion of
3314000	3316000	Your used sales, and fuck you GameStop
3316000	3318000	For being okay with this shit
3318000	3320000	I mean why, you're the biggest fucking
3320000	3322000	Company out there as far as retail
3322000	3324000	You know they're not
3324000	3326000	They're just, they have no choice
3326000	3328000	Nah, I'll get into more of that
3328000	3330000	Why I think they're doing
3330000	3332000	What they're doing and why they're so gung ho
3332000	3334000	About it anyway
3334000	3336000	Please, I want to hear that next, next time
3336000	3338000	Okay, so fuck them
3338000	3340000	Freeform tonight, I get what I want
3340000	3342000	Fuck them for being just okay about this
3342000	3344000	Wait, wait, wait, surely you have an opinion
3344000	3346000	What do you think about this whole like
3346000	3348000	PlayStation Network Plus
3348000	3350000	And the Crackdown rumor
3350000	3352000	Do you have any thoughts
3352000	3354000	Not yet
3354000	3356000	Would you pay for a service where you could
3356000	3358000	Just go in and play any PlayStation 1 game
3358000	3360000	You wanted
3360000	3362000	Depends
3362000	3364000	Depends on, I mean, if it was
3364000	3366000	Any game, any at all
3366000	3368000	Ever
3368000	3370000	Maybe
3370000	3372000	But I don't need to because I have
3372000	3374000	The vault
3374000	3376000	Okay
3376000	3378000	So fuck them for going along with this and basically
3378000	3380000	Saying, oh yeah, we think it's a great idea
3380000	3382000	Yeah, you know why you think it's a great idea?
3382000	3384000	Because you're going to start selling download content soon
3384000	3386000	And you're cashing in on that
3386000	3388000	And basically Microsoft is
3388000	3390000	Saying, hey, you know what
3390000	3392000	We're going to give you some back end
3392000	3394000	Rebates from this stuff
3398000	3400000	I don't know
3400000	3402000	They may be changing their tune too
3402000	3404000	When you look at some of these games
3404000	3406000	That you basically sell them for 30 bucks
3406000	3408000	They turn around and sell it for 55 dollars
3408000	3410000	And then they're going to charge me 10 dollars
3410000	3412000	On top of that to, you know
3412000	3414000	Say, for example, buy
3416000	3418000	You know, multiplayer online
3418000	3420000	You know, I'm paying basically 5 dollars
3420000	3422000	More than the price of a new game
3422000	3424000	So I'm going to be buying a new game
3424000	3426000	Obviously, if I'm really interested in that
3426000	3428000	Or I just won't play online
3428000	3430000	Thankfully
3430000	3432000	A lot of the games, if I were to ever buy them used
3432000	3434000	I probably wouldn't be playing them online
3434000	3436000	I don't play a lot of stuff online
3436000	3438000	I don't know
3438000	3440000	It's really awful
3440000	3442000	Alright, get to the other thing
3442000	3444000	About GameStop
3444000	3446000	That's why I already went to that
3446000	3448000	Because they're going to be selling download content
3448000	3450000	That was it
3450000	3452000	Sorry, I don't know if that's alright
3452000	3454000	No, I had heard that
3454000	3456000	I had heard that rumor a little bit before
3456000	3458000	I just can't see
3458000	3460000	Walking into GameStop to get
3460000	3462000	The download content
3462000	3464000	Being able to
3464000	3466000	Sample it in the store or whatever
3466000	3468000	On their little kiosks
3468000	3470000	It's just like Amazon
3470000	3472000	How you can buy stuff off Amazon
3472000	3474000	And get the codes and stuff like that
3474000	3476000	But sometimes you want to go to the mall
3476000	3478000	I get that, but I don't know
3478000	3480000	It's weird
3480000	3482000	Alright, what else
3482000	3484000	How about another story
3484000	3486000	Then maybe we'll do release dates
3486000	3488000	Scratch the Ultimate DJ
3488000	3490000	Coming to iPhone, iPad
3490000	3492000	And the PC
3492000	3494000	They're still working on I guess the console versions
3494000	3496000	As well according to Newmark
3496000	3498000	But they are going to be out
3498000	3500000	On those three platforms later this year
3500000	3502000	It looks kind of weird though
3502000	3504000	I can't imagine playing this game on an iPad
3504000	3506000	Or something, very awkward
3506000	3508000	They have turntables in the
3508000	3510000	Upper corners and then the five keys
3510000	3512000	On the bottom and a crossfader
3512000	3514000	Just above those keys
3514000	3516000	Little complex
3516000	3518000	The PC version though will actually have a controller for it
3518000	3520000	So that will be interesting to see
3520000	3522000	Um
3522000	3524000	But apparently
3524000	3526000	You know, I guess
3526000	3528000	It kind of sucks that the whole game was held up
3528000	3530000	Because of the whole lawsuit with
3530000	3532000	Activision and stuff
3532000	3534000	Which we never really heard what happened with that
3534000	3536000	Have they settled or what
3536000	3538000	Uh, whatever um
3538000	3540000	Happened to the console release
3540000	3542000	Is that still tied up in the lawsuit?
3542000	3544000	It says the console versions
3544000	3546000	Are still in development
3546000	3548000	And the PC version will use a special controller
3548000	3550000	Interesting
3550000	3552000	Yeah
3552000	3554000	Alright
3554000	3556000	Um, how about release dates?
3556000	3558000	Do you want to do some release dates?
3558000	3560000	That sounds like fun. Sure. Alright
3560000	3562000	Do you have Europe ones? I do.
3562000	3564000	Jamie, why don't we start with you?
3564000	3566000	We haven't heard your lovely voice in a few minutes
3566000	3568000	Okay
3568000	3570000	Yeah, go for it. Why not?
3570000	3572000	Alright, well then um
3572000	3574000	It's really just a few things
3574000	3576000	On the uh
3576000	3578000	Well, today, the 26th
3578000	3580000	Doom 2 for Xbox 360

3592000	3594000	Project Runway
3594000	3596000	Project One Way, or as I was saying
3596000	3598000	Pure Football
3598000	3600000	I thought it was called Project Catwalk over there
3600000	3602000	Make it work
3602000	3604000	Critical Blur UFC
3604000	3606000	Undisputed 2010
3606000	3608000	Basit
3608000	3610000	Loki?
3610000	3612000	Um, well, there's a few things
3612000	3614000	coming out this week
3614000	3616000	Witch's Witch from Natsume
3616000	3618000	That's on the DS

3622000	3624000	for the PC
3624000	3626000	Mind Over Matter, another
3626000	3628000	Bane training
3628000	3630000	Brain training puzzle game
3630000	3632000	coming out on DS as well
3632000	3634000	Backbreaker coming out on
3634000	3636000	Xbox 360 and Playstation 3
3636000	3638000	That's one of those independent football games
3638000	3640000	Alpha Protocol on
3640000	3642000	Xbox 360
3642000	3644000	PC and Playstation 3
3644000	3646000	Pure Football

3652000	3654000	on DS and
3654000	3656000	on the Wii
3656000	3658000	That's exciting
3658000	3660000	Hope Crazy Tyra's in it
3660000	3662000	Diamond Trust
3662000	3664000	of London
3664000	3666000	It's a strategy game on the DS

3668000	3670000	Bass Pro Shops
3670000	3672000	The Hunt, yet another
3672000	3674000	deer hunting game
3674000	3676000	That's on the Wii and Xbox 360
3676000	3678000	and the Wii, of course, getting a gun bundle
3678000	3680000	because those people that own Wiis
3680000	3682000	love guns
3682000	3684000	And, um
3684000	3686000	What else do we have here?
3686000	3688000	Call of Duty The War Collection
3688000	3690000	is a re-release of three Call of Duty
3690000	3692000	World War II games on
3692000	3694000	Xbox 360, I believe two, three in World at War
3694000	3696000	Uh
3696000	3698000	Let's see here, Prince of Persia The Forgotten
3698000	3700000	Sands on PC, I guess it was a few weeks late
3700000	3702000	And that's
3702000	3704000	that's basically it
3704000	3706000	Alright
3706000	3708000	Oh, Syphon Filter is Logan's
3708000	3710000	Shadow on Playstation 2
3710000	3712000	Yes, they're still making Playstation 2 games
3712000	3714000	Yes, they're still ports of
3714000	3716000	PSP game, right?
3716000	3718000	Uh, going to Japan
3718000	3720000	These releases are for June 3rd, we're not gonna be live again
3720000	3722000	until June 6th, and I didn't see a lot for May
3722000	3724000	So let's go to June 3rd releases for Japan, okay?
3724000	3726000	Some price reductions on Gears of War 2
3726000	3728000	on the 360, Gundam Musou 2
3728000	3730000	and Tales of Vesperia
3730000	3732000	Again, these are June 3rd releases I'm doing today
3732000	3734000	Uh, going to the
3734000	3736000	Playstation 3
3736000	3738000	Also, some more price reductions
3738000	3740000	Gundam Musou 2 and Katamari Damacy Tribute
3740000	3742000	which I believe is, uh, Katamari
3742000	3744000	What do they call it, Forever here?
3744000	3746000	I don't know that game and I can't remember
3746000	3748000	Uh, nothing really notable on the Wii
3748000	3750000	This is kind of a dry period over there
3750000	3752000	I don't know if there's, you know, just not the season
3752000	3754000	but it's mostly price reductions going on in Japan right now
3754000	3756000	Uh, same thing when you look at the PS2
3756000	3758000	Gundam Musou 2, Mobile Suit Gundam
3758000	3760000	games going on sale
3760000	3762000	Uh, Nintendo DS
3762000	3764000	another Pachinko game comes out
3764000	3766000	Kaiden Restaurant Ura menu, 100-sen
3766000	3768000	I don't know if that's like 100 different things
3768000	3770000	on the menu or what, but that is coming out on the DS
3770000	3772000	and then on the PSP
3772000	3774000	100-sen
3774000	3776000	Is that the 100 classic books thing or?
3776000	3778000	From Nintendo?
3778000	3780000	No, because it's Kaiden Restaurant
3780000	3782000	I don't think that's it
3782000	3784000	No, there's like a little happy ghost on the cover
3784000	3786000	It's a horror buffet
3786000	3788000	with chilling blood curdling
3788000	3790000	and creepy stories as dishes
3790000	3792000	Maybe it is, 100 tales for you to order
3792000	3794000	Choose the one that suits your mood
3794000	3796000	Vampires, ghosts, psychopath killers
3796000	3798000	These characters fill the cartridge and all you have to do
3798000	3800000	is order them to come out
3800000	3802000	That sounds creepy
3802000	3804000	It's like Silent Hill, but you read it
3804000	3806000	Uh, and then lastly
3806000	3808000	on the PSP
3808000	3810000	Bleach, Heat the Soul 6
3810000	3812000	gets a price reduction
3812000	3814000	and probably the only new game I'm seeing on this whole list
3814000	3816000	Fairy Tale, Portable Guild
3816000	3818000	is coming out this week from Konami
3818000	3820000	on June 3rd, next week
3820000	3822000	There you go, Japanese releases, there you have it
3822000	3824000	Uh, let's do a
3824000	3826000	couple stories and then we'll get into
3826000	3828000	other topics
3828000	3830000	and we'll do the mailbag and all that other fun stuff too
3830000	3832000	Um, let me
3832000	3834000	I'll tackle a couple things here
3834000	3836000	that I wanted to touch on
3836000	3838000	that rolled over from what we were going to do on Sunday
3838000	3840000	Uh, Facebook and Zynga
3840000	3842000	Kiss... Zynga? Zynga?
3842000	3844000	Farmville, people
3844000	3846000	They kissed and made up
3846000	3848000	They had make-up sex
3848000	3850000	and everything's better. Remember how they were threatened
3850000	3852000	Remember how Zynga, Zynga, Zynga
3852000	3854000	was threatening to leave and like, we're going to take Farmville
3854000	3856000	to their own damn website and I said, it'll never work
3856000	3858000	It'll never work
3858000	3860000	Well, they came to their senses and they kissed and made up
3860000	3862000	and they have committed to their
3862000	3864000	long-term relationship
3864000	3866000	and, um, meaning that I guess
3866000	3868000	for years and years, they're going to
3868000	3870000	basically, Zynga got a deal on that
3870000	3872000	Facebook credit thing, you know that's how it works out
3872000	3874000	Did you hear something else about them too?
3874000	3876000	What's that? They're teaming up with Yahoo
3876000	3878000	and they're going to have all their games on Yahoo as well
3878000	3880000	Um, they're going to be integrated into
3880000	3882000	all their different web pages and stuff
3882000	3884000	It's not the same. Yahoo already has
3884000	3886000	a gaming portal
3886000	3888000	A lot of the PopCap stuff and all that's on
3888000	3890000	What were the games?
3890000	3892000	I actually used to play some games on there
3892000	3894000	There's like a Scrabble-type game on there
3894000	3896000	and the freaking whiteboard game
3896000	3898000	It was like Pictionary
3898000	3900000	and everybody drew dirty fucking pictures in that game
3900000	3902000	I can't remember the name of it
3902000	3904000	Yeah, I even played some of those games before
3904000	3906000	Whatever
3906000	3908000	It's not Facebook
3908000	3910000	If you can't collect the things and post
3910000	3912000	them to your wall so you can prove
3912000	3914000	that you have the biggest E-peen farm
3914000	3916000	that you're farming all the E-peen in the land
3916000	3918000	then
3918000	3920000	The part where I
3920000	3922000	banged my head against the wall
3922000	3924000	was when I saw the Farmville cards for sale
3924000	3926000	at like 7-11
3926000	3928000	There was like little $10 Farmville cards, I was like
3928000	3930000	Oh my god. Did you see the Farmville ice cream?
3930000	3932000	Oh god, yeah, I heard something
3932000	3934000	about that, like there's Farmville ice cream
3934000	3936000	and Farmville...
3936000	3938000	Slurpees or something? Oh god
3938000	3940000	No, do not want
3940000	3942000	It's all fattening anyway
3942000	3944000	Ice cream is bad for you
3944000	3946000	It makes you fat
3946000	3948000	This is why you're fat
3948000	3950000	Alright, the website
3950000	3952000	I wasn't saying that to you, Loki
3954000	3956000	I thought this was an interesting story too
3956000	3958000	that had to do with Epic
3958000	3960000	and a comment they made this
3960000	3962000	week, or this past week
3962000	3964000	about piracy
3964000	3966000	And they basically said that
3966000	3968000	6 years ago, Epic was a PC
3968000	3970000	company, but because
3970000	3972000	of piracy, they went to
3972000	3974000	consoles. We did one
3974000	3976000	PS2 launch title and everything else was PC
3976000	3978000	and now people are saying, why do you
3978000	3980000	hate the PC? You're a console only company
3980000	3982000	It's because the money's on
3982000	3984000	consoles. That's from President
3984000	3986000	Mike Capps
3986000	3988000	We still do PC, we still love
3988000	3990000	the PC, but we already saw the impact of
3990000	3992000	piracy. It killed a lot of great
3992000	3994000	independent developers and completely
3994000	3996000	changed our business model
3998000	4000000	And then it goes on to talk a little bit about Steam
4000000	4002000	and how Steam is essentially single-handedly
4002000	4004000	really helping
4004000	4006000	breathe life into PC gaming
4006000	4008000	because piracy is just driving it bankrupt
4010000	4012000	Any thoughts on that, Loki?
4012000	4014000	Not that I'm insinuating that you're a pirate or anything
4014000	4016000	but I know you usually have strong feelings about
4016000	4018000	these types of topics
4018000	4020000	There's piracy on any
4020000	4022000	platform, regardless of PC
4022000	4024000	Xbox 360
4024000	4026000	handhelds
4026000	4028000	other consoles
4028000	4030000	It's easier to do on PC
4030000	4032000	so I guess that's
4032000	4034000	true, but
4034000	4036000	they're facing piracy everywhere
4038000	4040000	Is that really an excuse?
4040000	4042000	I think it's because they can charge more for their
4042000	4044000	games, but
4044000	4046000	whatever
4046000	4048000	Good for you
4048000	4050000	You're a console developer
4050000	4052000	now
4052000	4054000	Do you want me to pat you on the back or something?
4054000	4056000	Really?
4056000	4058000	Alright, one other story and then I'll let Loki take over
4058000	4060000	for a little bit. BlizzCon tickets
4060000	4062000	on sale
4062000	4064000	June 2nd and June 5th
4064000	4066000	$150 if you want to go
4066000	4068000	and the con is in October
4068000	4070000	October 22nd and 23rd
4070000	4072000	You know what, DarkSakura? I think you and I
4072000	4074000	should go down to Anaheim on October 22nd
4074000	4076000	and 23rd and go to Disneyland
4076000	4078000	Fuck BlizzCon
4078000	4080000	$150?
4080000	4082000	No thank you. The 22nd and 23rd
4082000	4084000	October
4084000	4086000	Except I'll be going to Alabama right after
4086000	4088000	No, I'll be going to Alabama in November
4088000	4090000	I haven't done Disney with Jamie in a while
4090000	4092000	I've done Disney with other people, not Jamie
4092000	4094000	It's been a little while
4094000	4096000	Here's my thing
4096000	4098000	You might be thinking, what the hell, Rob?
4098000	4100000	You're like the biggest wow addict on that show
4100000	4102000	and why are you all hating on BlizzCon?
4102000	4104000	A, they want
4104000	4106000	$150
4106000	4108000	What am I getting?
4108000	4110000	Cataclysm ought to be out by then
4110000	4112000	I mean, and if it's not
4112000	4114000	Damn, they're moving slow
4114000	4116000	When is it again? October 22nd and 23rd
4116000	4118000	Well, they did release the last expansion
4118000	4120000	I want to say, or there was one of expansions
4120000	4122000	that was released in November, so
4122000	4124000	Yeah, but Burning Crusade
4124000	4126000	was out in like January
4126000	4128000	Well, then that's both after October
4128000	4130000	Look, it's World of Warcraft
4130000	4132000	Blizzard can release it
4132000	4134000	whenever the fuck they want
4134000	4136000	They could release it on Christmas Eve
4136000	4138000	and nerds would be out in force to get there
4138000	4140000	and be the first
4140000	4142000	It doesn't matter, it's Blizzard
4142000	4144000	They can do what they want
4144000	4146000	Look, I understand
4146000	4148000	They got to recoup their costs
4148000	4150000	They do some big stuff for this
4150000	4152000	Whatever, it's a pretty big effing deal
4152000	4154000	Am I going to get to be the first to play
4154000	4156000	their new MMO?
4156000	4158000	Which is the rumor that they have a type of
4158000	4160000	action-ish MMO that's in the works
4160000	4162000	I think the last rumor I heard
4162000	4164000	was like a spy, espionage-y type of game
4164000	4166000	might be their next MMO
4166000	4168000	So, the agency?
4168000	4170000	I don't know, I don't know
4170000	4172000	Rumor, huge fan wank rumor, don't quote me
4172000	4174000	And I imagine Diablo 3
4174000	4176000	is going to be playable
4176000	4178000	but $150?
4178000	4180000	I'd rather ride Space Mountain
4180000	4182000	three times in a row, what?
4182000	4184000	Dude, I'd just rather ride Space Mountain
4184000	4186000	period, instead of like
4186000	4188000	almost anything
4188000	4190000	Yep, so maybe
4190000	4192000	we'll walk out front of the convention center
4192000	4194000	like when we
4194000	4196000	when we get bored
4196000	4198000	we'll go walk over to the convention center
4198000	4200000	I don't know how we're going to get bored at Disneyland
4200000	4202000	but let's just hypothesize that every ride we want to go on
4202000	4204000	is broken
4204000	4206000	We'll go walk outside the convention center
4206000	4208000	and look at the people and go
4208000	4210000	So, how's it going?
4210000	4212000	Be like, hey y'all
4212000	4214000	we're going to go on
4214000	4216000	on the Matterhorn
4216000	4218000	have fun waiting in line
4218000	4220000	You might be able to get in as a press
4220000	4222000	maybe
4222000	4224000	Is it bad to say
4224000	4226000	that again, I would just
4226000	4228000	the convention center
4228000	4230000	let me put this in perspective, if you've never been to Anaheim
4230000	4232000	the convention center is literally
4232000	4234000	two blocks from Disneyland
4234000	4236000	You can walk there, it's not that bad
4236000	4238000	I mean, with all the walking you do at Disneyland in a day
4238000	4240000	I don't get why you drive anyway
4240000	4242000	You can
4242000	4244000	especially California Adventure is like right there
4244000	4246000	it's the first park you hit moving that direction
4246000	4248000	I know that
4248000	4250000	You could
4250000	4252000	literally walk to Disneyland
4252000	4254000	and if I'm going to be that close, I've got to go
4254000	4256000	Maybe I should be doing a Disney podcast
4256000	4258000	I don't know
4258000	4260000	I might feel a little more
4260000	4262000	excited if I knew
4262000	4264000	what games I was going to get to see
4264000	4266000	but Starcraft 2 is out in July
4266000	4268000	so maybe one of the future expansions
4268000	4270000	but I'm not a Starcraft person anyway
4270000	4272000	I'm assuming it's all about Diablo 3
4272000	4274000	and I guess
4274000	4276000	Cataclysm if it's still not out
4276000	4278000	but it's got to be in beta by that point
4278000	4280000	so people are already playing it
4280000	4282000	maybe they'll announce another
4282000	4284000	Warcraft expansion
4284000	4286000	I mean, I don't know
4286000	4288000	I could go off on a tangent about this
4288000	4290000	maybe this isn't the right forum
4290000	4292000	but I kind of think Cataclysm
4292000	4294000	is less of an expansion
4294000	4296000	I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm very excited for Cataclysm
4296000	4298000	it sounds like an exciting expansion
4298000	4300000	but I think this is the
4300000	4302000	closest you're going to get
4302000	4304000	to WoW 2.0
4304000	4306000	like, they're literally going back
4306000	4308000	and upgrading the old game
4308000	4310000	and they're using the Cataclysm as the retcon to do it
4312000	4314000	so it's kind of like
4314000	4316000	you're getting a little less of an upgrade
4316000	4318000	with all this new stuff
4318000	4320000	as you're just getting your old stuff enhanced
4320000	4322000	to be competitive with newer releases
4322000	4324000	does that make sense?
4324000	4326000	so I wouldn't be surprised at all if another expansion
4326000	4328000	comes pretty quickly afterwards
4328000	4330000	the actual expansion
4330000	4332000	where you go out to a new area
4332000	4334000	and all this stuff
4334000	4336000	and the additional five levels you didn't see in this first expansion
4336000	4338000	but that's just
4338000	4340000	you know, again
4340000	4342000	fanboy wank
4342000	4344000	are they raising it in level cap again?
4344000	4346000	to 85, but not to 90
4346000	4348000	which is, you know, fine, whatever
4348000	4350000	but it just kind of makes me think
4350000	4352000	that they already have another expansion
4352000	4354000	planned that will take it to 90
4354000	4356000	I ultimately think WoW will stop at 100
4356000	4358000	level 100 seems to be a nice
4358000	4360000	even round number, but we'll see
4360000	4362000	again
4362000	4364000	fanboy wank, nothing more
4364000	4366000	Loki, what do you got for us?
4366000	4368000	apparently
4368000	4370000	Edge is reporting
4370000	4372000	that Project Natal
4372000	4374000	will
4374000	4376000	be out for
4376000	4378000	$150
4378000	4380000	and October 26
4380000	4382000	give or take a few weeks
4382000	4384000	didn't they say 100 bucks?
4384000	4386000	oh no, that was a Playstation move
4386000	4388000	I
4388000	4390000	I don't think
4390000	4392000	I would hope that they're smart enough
4392000	4394000	not to put it out for that price
4394000	4396000	that's how much a week costs, isn't it?
4396000	4398000	yeah, and they're also
4398000	4400000	basically
4400000	4402000	the Xbox, well we know that
4402000	4404000	a slim Xbox is coming out
4404000	4406000	so perhaps
4406000	4408000	they're going to be bundling with that
4408000	4410000	and they're saying that they're going to be bundling
4410000	4412000	with the new Xbox 360
4412000	4414000	for $300
4414000	4416000	I don't know
4416000	4418000	it seems awfully high
4418000	4420000	I know the technology is probably great
4420000	4422000	and all, but
4422000	4424000	they've got to have learned
4424000	4426000	something from Sony, if you put it out
4426000	4428000	at that kind of price point
4428000	4430000	no one's going to pick it up
4430000	4432000	you've got a few people picking it up, but no one's
4432000	4434000	going to really jump on board with it because
4434000	4436000	I can get a Wii for that price
4436000	4438000	but, if there's some
4438000	4440000	kick my ass amazing, blow
4440000	4442000	my hair back game
4442000	4444000	I might pay it
4444000	4446000	a system is only as good as the games that are on it
4446000	4448000	and the advantage of this
4448000	4450000	over the Playstation Move
4450000	4452000	is that you have to buy this
4452000	4454000	and you're done
4454000	4456000	there's no additional controllers you have to buy
4456000	4458000	because you're basically the controller
4458000	4460000	so it works up to
4460000	4462000	do you think maybe that's their leverage?
4462000	4464000	they're going to come out and say yes, it's $150
4464000	4466000	but maybe they're going to do a price comparison
4466000	4468000	and they'll say, if you want to buy
4468000	4470000	the Wii for the whole family to play
4470000	4472000	that actually costs you
4472000	4474000	$150 plus what?
4474000	4476000	$40 plus $40 plus $40, right?
4476000	4478000	it's $40 plus
4478000	4480000	actually because you're going to need nunchucks probably
4480000	4482000	so $40 plus $20
4482000	4484000	so $60, so a lot
4484000	4486000	another $180 on top of that
4486000	4488000	alright, so a lot, but they're going to say
4488000	4490000	that's going to be their leverage, they're going to come out and say
4490000	4492000	to buy the Xbox 360
4492000	4494000	Natal for the whole family
4494000	4496000	$300 and it plays DVDs
4496000	4498000	and it does Netflix out of the box
4498000	4500000	and...
4500000	4502000	all this stuff
4502000	4504000	I can see it
4504000	4506000	again, if they have
4506000	4508000	the game to justify it
4508000	4510000	then
4510000	4512000	they'll get away with it
4512000	4514000	I think it needs to be sub $100
4514000	4516000	but that's just me
4516000	4518000	I would say they should
4518000	4520000	put it out for $99.99
4520000	4522000	you know what they should do?
4522000	4524000	here's how they would sell a million copies
4524000	4526000	you ready?
4526000	4528000	no joke, you guys are going to hate me
4528000	4530000	for this, all the people listening
4530000	4532000	are going to cringe, but I'll tell you what
4532000	4534000	they would sell a million copies of this
4534000	4536000	you ready?
4536000	4538000	the biggest loser video game
4538000	4540000	the whole family can play
4540000	4542000	Project Natal
4542000	4544000	so it's like
4544000	4546000	a competitor to Wii Fit based off that
4546000	4548000	TV show
4548000	4550000	it would sell like crazy
4550000	4552000	number one
4552000	4554000	they put it out on the Wii
4554000	4556000	pretty successful, because it came out last October
4556000	4558000	and it sold pretty well
4558000	4560000	it's already out
4560000	4562000	and it was okay
4562000	4564000	but it's not a system seller
4564000	4566000	and yeah, I understand there's going to be
4566000	4568000	all those kind of party games
4568000	4570000	and fitness games and stuff like that
4570000	4572000	and it's going to suck
4572000	4574000	because there's going to be a ton of these crappy games
4574000	4576000	coming up, but that doesn't really affect me
4576000	4578000	too much because you don't have to buy them, obviously
4580000	4582000	it's just really how much is the hardware going to cost
4582000	4584000	that's really the thing I'm interested to find out
4584000	4586000	but
4586000	4588000	I will find out in a few weeks
4588000	4590000	I'm sure they're going to say a price point
4590000	4592000	they better say a price point
4592000	4594000	E3 is kind of the time you lay it all out on the table
4594000	4596000	for the holidays
4596000	4598000	I would expect
4598000	4600000	you may not get specific dates
4600000	4602000	but you're going to get
4602000	4604000	I think you'll get prices and you're going to get a pretty good
4604000	4606000	understanding of what that blow your hair back game is
4606000	4608000	that they're putting behind
4608000	4610000	whether it be Fable 3, the Milo thing
4610000	4612000	and I said that
4612000	4614000	a long time ago, it's going to be Gears 3
4614000	4616000	I did, remember?
4616000	4618000	I said, because they were hiding
4618000	4620000	that game for the longest time
4620000	4622000	Gears is a pretty successful franchise
4622000	4624000	and they just recently announced Gears 3
4624000	4626000	and I think it's gotten a top support
4626000	4628000	Here's the other thing I'm thinking
4628000	4630000	though, is that
4630000	4632000	one of the
4632000	4634000	I guess conspiracy theories about it was
4634000	4636000	that they were saying that they originally
4636000	4638000	were remembering that it was going to be like 50 bucks
4638000	4640000	for the game, for the actual thing
4640000	4642000	and that now they're
4642000	4644000	putting out this rumor that it's going to be $150
4644000	4646000	so they can come back and put it out
4646000	4648000	for $99, so those people are hoping
4648000	4650000	that it was $50 aren't as
4650000	4652000	disappointed, you know, whereas the people
4652000	4654000	that thought it was going to be $150 are like, hey!
4654000	4656000	Now it's only $99, that's awesome!
4656000	4658000	I don't know
4658000	4660000	If they do come out with Natal support for Gears of War 3
4660000	4662000	at E3, I want to be called
4662000	4664000	from here on out, games analyst
4664000	4666000	Rob Roberts, games analyst
4666000	4668000	If I'm wrong
4668000	4670000	then I'm just some dickhead with a podcast
4670000	4672000	which is what I've always been, nothing new
4672000	4674000	You could be Robert Patrick, stupid Michael Patrick
4674000	4676000	I want to go on record saying
4676000	4678000	Michael Patrick's a fucking douchebag
4678000	4680000	and the reason why, because he just throws out guesses
4680000	4682000	and yet people come
4682000	4684000	That's what we do!
4684000	4686000	I understand that, but people fucking run
4686000	4688000	It's like if he comes out on his balcony
4688000	4690000	to the game of press
4690000	4692000	He's like the pope
4692000	4694000	Pretty much, he walks out
4694000	4696000	writes his declaration
4696000	4698000	and then goes back to
4698000	4700000	I think this holiday season
4700000	4702000	game consoles will do well
4702000	4704000	and everybody reports it like
4704000	4706000	Oh my god, he said something!
4706000	4708000	Game consoles do well! Michael Patrick says so!
4708000	4710000	Oh my god!
4710000	4712000	Women fainting
4712000	4714000	I just don't understand
4714000	4716000	why people have
4716000	4718000	This is why, other than complaining about him
4718000	4720000	I will never mention any analyst
4720000	4722000	I don't give a shit what an analyst
4722000	4724000	thinks
4724000	4726000	Who cares? If that's your job, great
4726000	4728000	I don't go asking meteorologists
4728000	4730000	what the weather is going to be like
4730000	4732000	Because they're not always right
4732000	4734000	Would it be wrong for us to put
4734000	4736000	in the description of our podcast
4736000	4738000	three games analysts
4738000	4740000	conquer the video game news
4740000	4742000	every week
4742000	4744000	You don't really have to have a degree to call yourself an analyst
4744000	4746000	You just have to analyze the market
4746000	4748000	We've been doing that for eight years
4748000	4750000	That's on the job
4750000	4752000	experience, right?
4752000	4754000	Dark Soccer, you know this
4754000	4756000	legal stuff better than I do
4756000	4758000	Can I call myself a games analyst?
4758000	4760000	You can call yourself whatever you want
4760000	4762000	There you go
4762000	4764000	Orange Lounge Radio brought to you by three expert
4764000	4766000	games analysts
4766000	4768000	every week
4768000	4770000	We've been analyzing the industry for eight years
4770000	4772000	I will go as far as saying I'm the most
4772000	4774000	expert analyst of them all
4774000	4776000	That's my opinion
4776000	4778000	I am the most expert analyst ever
4778000	4780000	We are the most smartest
4780000	4782000	games analysts out there
4784000	4786000	The most expertest
4786000	4788000	I'm the smartest of them all
4790000	4792000	Another news story
4792000	4794000	please, before our egos
4794000	4796000	inflate anymore
4796000	4798000	Michael Patrick's coming out on the balcony again
4798000	4800000	Oh my god!
4800000	4802000	What's he saying?
4802000	4804000	Madden 11 will sell a lot
4804000	4806000	Oh my god!
4806000	4808000	Oh my god!
4808000	4810000	It's the holy word
4810000	4812000	God's awful
4812000	4814000	I just don't understand
4814000	4816000	I hate me because it's true
4816000	4818000	I hate you because it's true
4818000	4820000	Mama, what have you done now?
4820000	4822000	That's right
4822000	4824000	Babysitting mama
4824000	4826000	including your very own plush baby
4826000	4828000	which you shove a remote down its throat
4828000	4830000	in order to play
4830000	4832000	I kid you not
4832000	4834000	Really?
4834000	4836000	Yes, really, that's right
4836000	4838000	It uses a plush baby in which you have
4838000	4840000	tucked a Wii remote inside
4840000	4842000	also using the nunchuck that is somehow hanging out
4842000	4844000	of the plush baby somehow
4844000	4846000	You play 40 mini games
4846000	4848000	and the usual cookie mama style
4848000	4850000	and representing feeding
4850000	4852000	changing the baby, rocking it to sleep
4852000	4854000	and six different
4854000	4856000	virtual babies, each with their unique personalities
4856000	4858000	So if the baby shits
4858000	4860000	everywhere, then don't worry, mama will
4860000	4862000	fix it
4862000	4864000	I don't know
4864000	4866000	Oh, you wanted a girl? Don't worry, mama
4866000	4868000	will fix it
4870000	4872000	Don't worry, Dr. 90210
4872000	4874000	will fix it I don't know
4874000	4876000	It's weird, they did have a game
4876000	4878000	come out like this
4878000	4880000	I think it's called
4880000	4882000	My Baby There was a story
4882000	4884000	It was on an Australian blog
4884000	4886000	It was a Twitter topic one week
4886000	4888000	I remember that Yes
4888000	4890000	The character of the baby doll
4890000	4892000	Oh my gosh
4892000	4894000	And it's also like that Wiiwa thing, remember the doll?
4894000	4896000	Yeah, I remember Wiiwa, did the Wiiwa ever come out?
4896000	4898000	Not yet
4898000	4900000	Oh, it's interesting
4900000	4902000	But that's going to be weird that you have to have a baby doll
4902000	4904000	Not a damn person
4904000	4906000	listening to this show is ever going to play that game
4906000	4908000	It is cooking mama
4908000	4910000	Dark Sakura is the biggest
4910000	4912000	fan of cooking mama, I know
4912000	4914000	Dark Sakura, babysitting mama, yes or no?
4914000	4916000	I have a great idea No
4916000	4918000	No, no, no, I have the greatest idea
4918000	4920000	She's lip the baby, high heat
4920000	4922000	She's a games analyst
4922000	4924000	Loki, and she says
4924000	4926000	it's just not interesting
4928000	4930000	We should have a contest with this game
4930000	4932000	I'm telling you
4932000	4934000	The contest is, and this is great, you're going to love this
4934000	4936000	The contest is
4936000	4938000	to photograph your best
4938000	4940000	baby mama
4940000	4942000	not baby mama, yeah
4942000	4944000	Baby mama? They should have done it
4944000	4946000	Is that the babysitting mama? Baby mama
4946000	4948000	Anyways, um
4948000	4950000	No, the best babysitting mama
4950000	4952000	baby analog you could create
4952000	4954000	So, I mean, because basically
4954000	4956000	the Wii remote has to go into something
4956000	4958000	It doesn't necessarily have to be this
4958000	4960000	doll, unless the doll is actually going to have
4960000	4962000	a cord or something that's coming out of it
4962000	4964000	that you can plug into your Wii remote
4964000	4966000	and actually going to be its own controller
4966000	4968000	but assuming that it's not, it's just going to be some stuff thing
4968000	4970000	We should have people, like, take
4970000	4972000	other stuff things or
4972000	4974000	take your own baby out of whatever you have lying around your house
4974000	4976000	and that might be funny
4976000	4978000	and take pictures
4978000	4980000	playing the game with it
4980000	4982000	That's, that's
4982000	4984000	the game that we need to have
4984000	4986000	instead of, uh, uh
4986000	4988000	Cookie Mama or whatever, we need to have
4988000	4990000	this one
4990000	4992000	Not who that is
4992000	4994000	Not who that is
4994000	4996000	Not who that is
4996000	4998000	Not who she is
4998000	5000000	Why is it always the same old thing?
5000000	5002000	Y'all knew that
5002000	5004000	joke was coming, come on
5004000	5006000	You knew it, you knew it, don't sigh
5006000	5008000	Don't sigh at me
5008000	5010000	It's grown, Rob, it's grown because I knew
5010000	5012000	I got a quickie story of something you might hear
5012000	5014000	at E3, or you might not, I don't know
5014000	5016000	but apparently there are rumors going around
5016000	5018000	rumors abounding that Final Fantasy 13
5018000	5020000	versus may actually
5020000	5022000	release on the Xbox 360
5022000	5024000	Apparently that's something Squeenix is looking
5024000	5026000	into
5026000	5028000	Yeah, because Final Fantasy 13 did pretty well
5028000	5030000	so where the money is, they will follow
5030000	5032000	The answer will be at E3
5032000	5034000	Just dropping that little tidbit out there
5034000	5036000	Also one other little tidbit I wanted to drop
5036000	5038000	just because I thought this was cool
5038000	5040000	Top Gun apparently is coming to Playstation Network
5040000	5042000	There's, not, not the movie
5042000	5044000	It's an actual Playstation 3
5044000	5046000	game, and it'll be out on Mac and PC
5046000	5048000	as well. It's gonna be an air combat game
5048000	5050000	My hope is it's
5050000	5052000	pretty much the 8-bit game, but with
5052000	5054000	better graphics and new stuff, right?
5054000	5056000	That's what we want, right? I had Top Gun on the NES
5056000	5058000	That was a badass game
5058000	5060000	Good times
5060000	5062000	Loki, maybe one or two other stories, then we'll get
5062000	5064000	to the, like, we need to do the tweets and the mailbag
5064000	5066000	and all that other fun stuff
5066000	5068000	GameStop, remember they were talking about
5068000	5070000	throwing around the idea of some sort of
5070000	5072000	new rewards program
5072000	5074000	Well, now it's being
5074000	5076000	launched, I guess, their Power Up Rewards
5076000	5078000	program, and there's
5078000	5080000	two different things. You can get a card for free
5080000	5082000	Wait, first off, is this something that they
5082000	5084000	will try to force on me with every purchase?
5084000	5086000	It's basically the same thing
5086000	5088000	You'll see it's not very different
5088000	5090000	than what they're offering right now
5090000	5092000	So they have a card that you
5092000	5094000	can get for free, that, you know
5094000	5096000	you don't really do anything for
5096000	5098000	Or a card that's the
5098000	5100000	Platinum card, I guess, for
5100000	5102000	$14.99
5102000	5104000	Now, here's what you get
5104000	5106000	with the different cards
5106000	5108000	The standard black card
5108000	5110000	for each dollar that you spend
5110000	5112000	on new games and consoles
5112000	5114000	you get 10 points
5114000	5116000	Points that you earn on pre-owned games
5116000	5118000	you earn 20 points
5118000	5120000	For your trades
5120000	5122000	you get 20 points
5122000	5124000	per dollar
5124000	5126000	There's different birthday bonuses
5126000	5128000	exclusive member offers
5128000	5130000	and you get entered in
5130000	5132000	each time you buy something
5132000	5134000	to the Epic Rewards Giveaway
5134000	5136000	and then online activation
5136000	5138000	I guess
5138000	5142000	250 points
5142000	5144000	and if you establish a game library
5144000	5146000	with them you get 250 points
5146000	5148000	Now, with the Platinum card
5148000	5150000	you get basically all that
5150000	5152000	plus
5152000	5154000	in the Epic Rewards Giveaway thing
5154000	5156000	you get two entries
5156000	5158000	If you upgrade
5158000	5160000	to the Pro tier you get
5160000	5162000	an extra 250 points
5162000	5164000	you get a
5164000	5166000	one time buy two get one free
5166000	5168000	offer for pre-owned games
5168000	5170000	you get 10% off
5170000	5172000	10% bonuses on points
5172000	5174000	for your purchases
5174000	5176000	10% on pre-owned purchase
5176000	5178000	discount, I guess
5178000	5180000	and 10% trade bonus
5180000	5182000	and of course 12 issues of
5182000	5184000	Game Informer. So basically
5184000	5186000	you get the same shit that you
5186000	5188000	get now, except there's this point system
5188000	5190000	that you can trade in for different things
5190000	5192000	including
5192000	5194000	like, I guess you can
5194000	5196000	get
5196000	5198000	gift cards
5198000	5200000	free
5200000	5202000	controllers, but the prices on them
5202000	5204000	are just absolutely
5204000	5206000	ridiculous
5206000	5208000	like you have to basically spend
5208000	5210000	$4,000 to get it
5210000	5212000	My God, well the way
5212000	5214000	and the sad thing is the extra $5
5214000	5216000	I have to pay online to play it online
5216000	5218000	now, it will not count towards this
5218000	5220000	Yeah, basically it says the rewards range from
5220000	5222000	coupons for $5 to $10 off
5222000	5224000	purchases, and that ranges from
5224000	5226000	$4,000 to $8,000 points
5226000	5228000	You can even get a free
5228000	5230000	Xbox 360 controller or eternal beach
5230000	5232000	X11 headset for
5232000	5234000	40,000 points
5234000	5236000	40,000 points
5236000	5238000	of course would equal about
5238000	5240000	$4,000 spent on new games
5240000	5242000	The eternal beach headset, it's like $100
5242000	5244000	I think, and the controllers are like
5244000	5246000	$40, but
5246000	5248000	$4,000, really?
5248000	5250000	I mean, is that
5250000	5252000	what you're expecting? Oh, you're gonna give me something for
5252000	5254000	$40 after I spend $4,000?
5254000	5256000	Yeah, no
5256000	5258000	Yeah, no thanks. Do not want
5258000	5260000	But hey, I mean if you're really dead
5260000	5262000	set on spending your money at GameStop
5262000	5264000	anyways, you might as well get the card because at least you're earning
5264000	5266000	some points towards something, but I
5266000	5268000	mean, I don't know
5268000	5270000	Just like I have this thing at Petco where I
5270000	5272000	like buy cat food and stuff
5272000	5274000	I'm supposed to like buy ten bags of cat food
5274000	5276000	and I get one free, but it's within a certain
5276000	5278000	time limit, and that never happens
5278000	5280000	You might as well, because you're buying cat food
5280000	5282000	No, it never happens
5282000	5284000	It never happens, because I don't go through that much cat food
5284000	5286000	You don't have enough cat food, you need more cats
5286000	5288000	You need more cats
5288000	5290000	Alright, how about a quick story, then we'll go to Twitter
5290000	5292000	Alright
5292000	5294000	UFC Undisputed
5294000	5296000	2010 just was released
5296000	5298000	yesterday, and
5298000	5300000	unlockable is
5300000	5302000	Shaq
5302000	5304000	That's right, you can play a little Shaq-Fu
5304000	5306000	with Shaquille O'Neal
5306000	5308000	And there's actually an easy code to
5308000	5310000	do that
5310000	5312000	On the Xbox 360, at the main menu
5312000	5314000	you would hit down, up, left
5314000	5316000	down, down, left, up, down, down
5316000	5318000	left, X
5318000	5320000	Y, Y, X
5320000	5322000	And then start
5322000	5324000	On Playstation 3, it would be
5324000	5326000	down, up, left, down, down
5326000	5328000	left, up, down, down
5328000	5330000	left, square, triangle, triangle, square
5330000	5332000	start
5332000	5334000	So, there you go
5334000	5336000	There's your pro tip for the day
5336000	5338000	Right
5338000	5340000	Because I know everybody's just
5340000	5342000	running out to put that code in
5342000	5344000	right now
5344000	5346000	Let's do some Twitter topics, huh?
5346000	5348000	We may not have a chat room tonight
5348000	5350000	but we still have all you kids on Twitter
5350000	5352000	The nice thing about doing this mid-week is
5352000	5354000	we kind of get some different people, we catch different people
5354000	5356000	because a lot of folks that don't listen to us live
5356000	5358000	don't because they have other things going on
5358000	5360000	Sunday night, but we, looks like we got a little bit of a
5360000	5362000	different crowd tonight
5362000	5364000	Uh, let's see
5364000	5366000	Rockman Rock
5366000	5368000	sent us a tweet that says
5368000	5370000	You thought the movie, The Human Centipede
5370000	5372000	was a bad idea, just wait until
5372000	5374000	you play the game
5374000	5376000	That's right, there's a Human Centipede
5376000	5378000	game that I got
5378000	5380000	linked to here at Newgrounds
5380000	5382000	that I could play, but
5382000	5384000	I don't know if I want to
5384000	5386000	because the Human Centipede
5386000	5388000	is fucking gross
5388000	5390000	Yeah, but it's just Centipede
5390000	5392000	Let me just do this
5392000	5394000	You are doctor, wait let me make this full screen here
5394000	5396000	Wait, let me turn off the Twitter music, we already heard the Twitter music tonight
5396000	5398000	Shut up, Santa
5398000	5400000	Alright, let's see, you are Dr. Heider, a brilliant German
5400000	5402000	surgeon who's gone mad and surgically attached people
5402000	5404000	ass to mouth to create the Human Centipede
5404000	5406000	Your parents are not pleased
5406000	5408000	You must take your trusty rifle
5408000	5410000	and put down these Human Centipedes
5410000	5412000	with the bad dogs they are, whatever
5412000	5414000	Oh look, there's some
5414000	5416000	little people with their mouths on their butts
5416000	5418000	and there were ten points
5418000	5420000	Oh, that's not very gross, it's just digital
5420000	5422000	It's like little, let's see, we can do mouse
5422000	5424000	controls, mouse to move and left click
5424000	5426000	to fire, oh this is just
5426000	5428000	Centipede
5428000	5430000	Ha, but the Centipede
5430000	5432000	I get it, it's
5432000	5434000	the Human Centipede
5436000	5438000	The sounds are right
5438000	5440000	This is totally a hacked version
5440000	5442000	Oh, there's a police officer
5442000	5444000	Oh, and I just shot him to bits, woohoo
5446000	5448000	Yay, I beat the first stage
5448000	5450000	They change colors really stupidly
5450000	5452000	Yeah, that's a little dumb
5452000	5454000	Thanks anyway
5454000	5456000	A little dumb
5456000	5458000	Uh, let's see
5458000	5460000	Blade 3, or Blade III
5460000	5462000	How about
5462000	5464000	It says Blade E!
5464000	5466000	Blade E!
5466000	5468000	How about new Facebook privacy
5468000	5470000	Finally fixes games, annoying achievements
5470000	5472000	being posted everywhere, did you hear about this?
5472000	5474000	Facebook's been in the news a lot and I guess they
5474000	5476000	came out today, well they came out a couple days ago
5476000	5478000	and I love
5478000	5480000	the Facebook CEO because he's such
5480000	5482000	a bro, like you know
5482000	5484000	he's just, he looks like that total
5484000	5486000	douchebag frat guy
5486000	5488000	and like he's running this multi
5488000	5490000	like what, billion dollar company
5490000	5492000	and like he came out a couple days
5492000	5494000	ago and literally said the corporate
5494000	5496000	equivalent of, oh yeah my bad
5496000	5498000	My bad on that one
5498000	5500000	guys, sorry guys, my bad
5500000	5502000	I forgot
5502000	5504000	the keg, my bad
5504000	5506000	That's pretty much what happened a couple days ago
5506000	5508000	Well they came out today and talked about the base
5508000	5510000	so they're going to have to dumb down the privacy because
5510000	5512000	too many people are
5512000	5514000	you know, getting information used
5514000	5516000	that they don't want to be used, the biggest problem
5516000	5518000	is that
5518000	5520000	Facebook sets a lot of things to public by
5520000	5522000	default without really giving you enough warning
5522000	5524000	that's the biggest problem I always had
5524000	5526000	with it, but it sounds like they're getting rid of that
5526000	5528000	they're going to make it really easy to block applications
5528000	5530000	which includes games
5530000	5532000	so if you want to just block
5532000	5534000	all the fucking Facebook apps
5534000	5536000	and all the games, one click, done
5536000	5538000	how about that Dark Soccer, you won't have to read any of that
5538000	5540000	crap ever again, sweet
5540000	5542000	at least that's what it's
5542000	5544000	sounding like, we'll see, I guess we won't
5544000	5546000	really know until later tonight when it's implemented
5546000	5548000	maybe it's on there now, I don't know
5548000	5550000	Let's see, Sponge Twang wants to tell us
5550000	5552000	that he is going to a medium sized
5552000	5554000	Anime Con, not a big one, not as small
5554000	5556000	it's a medium sized
5556000	5558000	Anime Con in Boise, Idaho
5558000	5560000	Anime Oasis
5560000	5562000	Are there Oases in
5562000	5564000	Boise? I don't know
5564000	5566000	Oasis? Oasis
5566000	5568000	Are they in Boise?
5568000	5570000	Boise Oasis?
5570000	5572000	Anyway, saying
5572000	5574000	check out the game room, Sponge Twang is going to check out
5574000	5576000	the game room at Anime Oasis 2010
5576000	5578000	Yes, please, let us know
5578000	5580000	We like the Anime Cons, but we like the gaming room
5580000	5582000	reports, especially
5582000	5584000	Popo
5584000	5586000	and Jer
5586000	5588000	I know this guy, this is my buddy
5588000	5590000	Jer, not on Facebook, he's probably
5590000	5592000	on Facebook too, but LiveJournal
5592000	5594000	Popo and Jer says, or it's Pop
5594000	5596000	on Jer, I like Popo and Jer better
5596000	5598000	although it might be Pop on Jer
5598000	5600000	says Rob's Giggle sounds like
5600000	5602000	the Riddler from the old Batman series
5602000	5604000	just saying
5604000	5606000	Woo hoo hoo hoo!
5606000	5608000	I don't know
5608000	5610000	This is like Winnie the Pooh
5610000	5612000	That's what he did, the old Riddler guy
5612000	5614000	had this hoo hoo hoo thing he did
5614000	5616000	Yeah, it does sound like the Doughboy, shut up
5616000	5618000	I hate you, stop judging me
5620000	5622000	But I love the old Batman series
5622000	5624000	That's, that's Batman
5624000	5626000	Screw this
5626000	5628000	Batman, that's right, that was
5628000	5630000	Batman was awesome
5630000	5632000	GGBeat wants us to talk about
5632000	5634000	how Jet Set Radio should go to
5634000	5636000	Xbox Live Arcade, it would be awesome
5636000	5638000	I agree, it should go to Xbox Live
5638000	5640000	Arcade, it would be awesome, there should just be
5640000	5642000	a new Jet Set game, period
5642000	5644000	I thought it was coming to Xbox Live Arcade
5644000	5646000	Was that something that was
5646000	5648000	spoiled on the partner net or whatever?
5648000	5650000	I think it was one of the ones spoiled on the partner net
5650000	5652000	I can't remember, there is a lot
5652000	5654000	of Dreamcast stuff coming to Xbox Live
5654000	5656000	Arcade at some point
5656000	5658000	GGBeat, you need to cross your fingers, cross your toes
5658000	5660000	hold your breath and hope for a miracle at E3
5660000	5662000	I wonder if it'll be, yeah, it'll probably show it at E3
5662000	5664000	Maybe that'll be the game, you know how sometimes
5664000	5666000	at E3 there's like a game that they go
5666000	5668000	and it's out right now
5668000	5670000	Like I think, wasn't that Doom a couple years ago?
5670000	5672000	They came out and said Doom will be available tonight
5672000	5674000	Right?
5674000	5676000	Ironically Doom 2, maybe, maybe
5676000	5678000	GGBeat
5678000	5680000	Do it, do it, say a prayer
5680000	5682000	Light a candle
5682000	5684000	A satanic chant, whatever it is you want to do
5684000	5686000	I would guess Sonic Adventure over
5686000	5688000	that, cause that's actually
5688000	5690000	leaked out already
5690000	5692000	MNZeba
5692000	5694000	wants us to talk about
5694000	5696000	this game Ryzom
5696000	5698000	that is going open source
5698000	5700000	pretty interesting when an MMO goes open source
5700000	5702000	Ooh, this is cute
5702000	5704000	I've never seen this, is this
5704000	5706000	I don't know if that's the same game or if that's the
5706000	5708000	website, but there's this
5708000	5710000	cute little background with like a little raccoon
5710000	5712000	with a hard hat on and it's a cute little character
5712000	5714000	Well, whatever, anyhow Winchgate
5714000	5716000	who is developing and publishing Ryzom
5716000	5718000	they have announced that the Science Fantasy
5718000	5720000	MMO Ryzom, it's open source
5720000	5722000	That's kind of neat, an MMO going open source
5722000	5724000	And you install Linux on
5724000	5726000	the MMO
5726000	5728000	Probably, you can now use the
5728000	5730000	Ryzom core toolkit to make mods
5730000	5732000	or enhancements to the existing code
5732000	5734000	and even develop your own virtual world
5734000	5736000	Wow, that's pretty crazy
5736000	5738000	Who knows what might come of that, well thanks for the
5738000	5740000	heads up, if we have any programmers
5740000	5742000	that want to make the OLR MMO, go for it
5742000	5744000	The SEG
5744000	5746000	wants us to mention, how about the
5746000	5748000	Supreme Court hearings in October about the
5748000	5750000	California video games law
5750000	5752000	Oh yeah, that's going to be a big deal
5752000	5754000	Whatever happens because of that, I mean it will be
5754000	5756000	you know, the Supreme Court is
5756000	5758000	supposed to be the end of the line, the highest court in the land
5758000	5760000	Hopefully it will be the last we hear on it
5760000	5762000	I just feel like
5762000	5764000	I just don't know enough about the law
5764000	5766000	I might be a games analyst
5766000	5768000	But I don't really know enough to really
5768000	5770000	say what's going to happen with this
5770000	5772000	Of course I want it to be struck down, of course
5772000	5774000	I think the whole thing is a little silly
5774000	5776000	But I have no legal
5776000	5778000	basis to say it will or it won't
5778000	5780000	Do you guys have any thoughts?
5780000	5782000	The California video games law that
5782000	5784000	will, the California law will
5784000	5786000	make it illegal to sell the game, right?
5786000	5788000	I don't remember
5788000	5790000	I don't remember the specifics
5790000	5792000	about it, I have to look that
5792000	5794000	up real quick, hold on
5794000	5796000	What's the problem with doing a free form show?
5796000	5798000	You haven't really researched your topics
5798000	5800000	I think we're going to see
5800000	5802000	I really
5802000	5804000	I really don't see that it would
5804000	5806000	fly
5806000	5808000	I mean
5808000	5810000	Haven't they tried before?
5810000	5812000	Let's see, the California
5812000	5814000	law imposes restrictions on and a
5814000	5816000	labeling requirement with respect to
5816000	5818000	the sale or rental of violent video
5818000	5820000	games to minors. Several other states
5820000	5822000	have passed similar laws and others may well be
5822000	5824000	watching the case, the stakes
5824000	5826000	extend beyond California. I remember
5826000	5828000	this now because the verbiage
5828000	5830000	in the law was very vague
5830000	5832000	I remember this, it didn't really state
5832000	5834000	how a game was
5834000	5836000	It was a very
5836000	5838000	gray area
5838000	5840000	type of thing on what constituted a violent
5840000	5842000	game and hopefully that's going to be the same thing
5842000	5844000	that does the law in
5844000	5846000	But we'll see
5846000	5848000	I don't know
5848000	5850000	We'll see what happens
5850000	5852000	Butch Kawa says
5852000	5854000	Might be a late one, no you got in just under the wire
5854000	5856000	But the topic of heavy rain rights might
5856000	5858000	go to a movie deal, trivializing
5858000	5860000	the game or just trying to cash in
5860000	5862000	Heavy Rain movie, also
5862000	5864000	I'll piggyback on this, I wanted to say I read
5864000	5866000	this week a Mass Effect movie
5866000	5868000	was sold to Legendary Pictures too
5868000	5870000	What do you think? These games are pretty epic
5870000	5872000	to begin with, I mean they're a little different
5872000	5874000	than what we've seen before
5874000	5876000	Mass Effect would be kind of hard to condense down in the movie
5876000	5878000	Heavy Rain I could see it because it pretty much played out like a movie
5878000	5880000	so why not?
5880000	5882000	As long as the Jason scenes in it
5882000	5884000	Jason! Jason! Jason!
5884000	5886000	Jason!
5886000	5888000	Did you see the Press X
5888000	5890000	Jason music video today? I did actually
5890000	5892000	That was awesome
5892000	5894000	Good stuff
5894000	5896000	As long as they have the Jason scene in it, Bochi Kawa
5896000	5898000	I'm cool
5898000	5900000	But of course it's kind of
5900000	5902000	I don't necessarily think it's trivializing
5902000	5904000	the game, it's trying to cash in
5904000	5906000	They realize that the game is done pretty
5906000	5908000	well and will have a built in audience
5908000	5910000	to go see it and they can probably make
5910000	5912000	the movie relatively cheap
5912000	5914000	Speaking of which, I'm kind of curious to see how Prince of Persia
5914000	5916000	does because we might actually have a
5916000	5918000	mainstream video game movie
5918000	5920000	that does well With no Persians in it
5920000	5922000	Imagine that I know
5922000	5924000	It's so whitewashed
5924000	5926000	I think I saw something on Yahoo where the headline
5926000	5928000	was Prince of Persia called
5928000	5930000	Offensive
5930000	5932000	They're talking the movie, not the game
5932000	5934000	But it had to do, it was a story about that
5934000	5936000	and the movie
5936000	5938000	they can't call Avatar
5938000	5940000	The Last Airbender because they're all whitewashed
5940000	5942000	Well if they can't find
5942000	5944000	Persian actors that are
5944000	5946000	good enough for those parts
5946000	5948000	I think that's a little silly
5948000	5950000	Jake Gyllenhaal of course
5950000	5952000	is an A-list actor
5952000	5954000	There's going to be lots of people
5954000	5956000	Maybe myself included
5956000	5958000	who will want to see the movie
5958000	5960000	Don't mind me while I sound really racist here
5960000	5962000	Who would they get to play
5962000	5964000	these Persian roles?
5964000	5966000	Would they have Kal Penn or something?
5966000	5968000	Playing the major lead in this?
5968000	5970000	Well I think
5970000	5972000	you only need
5972000	5974000	one or two A-list actors
5974000	5976000	To take a step back
5976000	5978000	I think that
5978000	5980000	says something about our society in general
5980000	5982000	where you've only got one or two guys
5982000	5984000	to pick from
5984000	5986000	Was Aladdin Persian? I don't remember him being very
5986000	5988000	Persian in the cartoon
5988000	5990000	He was pretty white
5990000	5992000	I think that says something about society
5992000	5994000	A much larger
5994000	5996000	problem of society
5996000	5998000	What? The Disney one?
5998000	6000000	He looked
6000000	6002000	Middle Eastern?
6002000	6004000	Let me say this
6004000	6006000	There's an Aladdin stage show at California
6006000	6008000	Now you are making me do a Disney podcast
6008000	6010000	There's an Aladdin stage show at California
6010000	6012000	Adventure
6012000	6014000	The last time I saw it
6014000	6016000	the Jafar they had playing it
6016000	6018000	was a black guy
6018000	6020000	He's the best one I've ever seen
6020000	6022000	He was great
6022000	6024000	He was just enough camp
6024000	6026000	that the little kids want to boo him
6026000	6028000	but he was still really campy
6028000	6030000	He was by far the best Jafar
6030000	6032000	He happened to be a black guy
6032000	6034000	I didn't get offended that he wasn't
6034000	6036000	actually looked like the Sultan in the movie
6036000	6038000	or was Persian
6038000	6040000	He played the part well
6040000	6042000	The problem is people complain about everything
6042000	6044000	and that's really what it comes down to
6044000	6046000	If you don't like it
6046000	6048000	If that really gets your butt hurt
6048000	6050000	don't go see the movie
6050000	6052000	Also
6052000	6054000	Can I just say this real quick
6054000	6056000	They had a girl in the ensemble
6056000	6058000	in a wheelchair
6058000	6060000	A power wheelchair in the ensemble
6060000	6062000	She was actually pretty fierce
6062000	6064000	I got to say
6064000	6066000	They were kind of smart with how they integrated her into all the dance numbers
6066000	6068000	and everything
6068000	6070000	During a whole new world where the ensemble will come out
6070000	6072000	and they're carrying famous buildings
6072000	6074000	I shit you not
6074000	6076000	She had pyramids tied to the back of her wheelchair
6076000	6078000	and she'd ride along with everybody else
6078000	6080000	She's singing
6080000	6082000	It was great to see
6082000	6084000	You know why I like to see that?
6084000	6086000	Because there's a lot of handicapped kids that go to Disneyland
6086000	6088000	and for them to be able to see that
6088000	6090000	that if they want to do that, they can
6090000	6092000	I think that's great, personally
6096000	6098000	Boy, we're getting into too...
6098000	6100000	These topics are too deep
6100000	6102000	We need dick and fart jokes, help
6102000	6104000	We're done with Twitter, twitter.com
6104000	6106000	I burped, did I help?
6106000	6108000	Well, there's a game coming out
6108000	6110000	called Warriors of Alaysia
6110000	6112000	and it's basically
6112000	6114000	bikini-clad women fighting each other
6114000	6116000	Mortal Kombat style
6116000	6118000	And they have a lot of bikini-clad women that are
6118000	6120000	promoting it as well
6120000	6122000	So that's kind of interesting
6122000	6124000	Boobs!
6124000	6126000	Exactly. Speaking of boobs
6126000	6128000	If we have any listeners that are
6128000	6130000	going to Phantom this weekend
6130000	6132000	There's actually one of my friends
6132000	6134000	from high school
6134000	6136000	She's an amazing artist, worked for EA
6136000	6138000	Did a lot of the artwork for My Sims
6138000	6140000	That franchise
6140000	6142000	And draws chicks with big boobs
6142000	6144000	Very, very big boobs
6144000	6146000	She does, and she has
6146000	6148000	a comic that she works on
6148000	6150000	Her name is Genevieve, by the way
6150000	6152000	She works on, and I believe
6152000	6154000	her
6154000	6156000	I'm trying to remember who
6156000	6158000	her other artist is that she works with
6158000	6160000	I want to say his name is Robert
6160000	6162000	Forgive me if I got that wrong
6162000	6164000	Anyways, they have a comic that they work on
6164000	6166000	Called Islands in the Sky
6166000	6168000	And it's basically this big boob chick
6168000	6170000	That goes around stealing people's food
6170000	6172000	In these different islands in the sky
6172000	6174000	And putting them in her boobs, apparently
6174000	6176000	Pretty much, but
6176000	6178000	As kind of an exclusive thing at Phantom
6178000	6180000	They're going to be selling
6180000	6182000	And I don't know how the hell they got these made
6182000	6184000	But it's just awesome
6184000	6186000	They're going to be selling boob
6186000	6188000	Mouse pads
6188000	6190000	And they have one that's semi-tame
6190000	6192000	But still, she's got big boobs
6192000	6194000	But you can actually purchase those
6194000	6196000	She'll be on Artist Row
6196000	6198000	I believe booth 300 and 301
6198000	6200000	They're going to be doing
6200000	6202000	So, unrealistically proportioned women
6202000	6204000	Is your thing, then Islands in the Sky
6204000	6206000	Exactly, so say hi to Genevieve
6206000	6208000	She's awesome
6208000	6210000	Tell them OLR sent you!
6210000	6212000	And recommended the boobies
6212000	6214000	That's right
6214000	6216000	Not much has changed
6216000	6218000	No, but she's cool
6218000	6220000	These boobs were endorsed by Loki
6220000	6222000	Yes
6222000	6224000	How about, um, I don't know
6224000	6226000	Do we want to do, like, Mailbag?
6226000	6228000	Do we have Mailbag ready to go? Do we have some emails we can read tonight?
6228000	6230000	I didn't pull up Mailbag
6230000	6232000	Can we, well, let's
6232000	6234000	On a quick story, if you want to pull up Mailbag
6234000	6236000	Yeah, pull up Mailbag while we do another quick story
6236000	6238000	So, that game, Super Mario Crossover
6238000	6240000	Was pretty awesome, the Flash game where you can play
6240000	6242000	Super Mario Brothers with a bunch of different characters
6242000	6244000	Well, one of the characters that they talked about
6244000	6246000	Adding in there that they never really
6246000	6248000	Got a chance to do that was
6248000	6250000	Hayabasa, or Hayabusa
6250000	6252000	And, um, they have now
6252000	6254000	Added him in there, or at least they're going to very soon
6254000	6256000	They have a video teasing it
6256000	6258000	And he has, of course, his
6258000	6260000	Wall climb moves and he throws ninja stars
6260000	6262000	And whatnot, so, that's awesome
6262000	6264000	Can't wait to play that
6264000	6266000	Version of it
6266000	6268000	And that's that game you really love to play that has, like, the Contra characters
6268000	6270000	Oh yeah
6270000	6272000	Sweet
6272000	6274000	Alright, Dark Sakura is prepared to dive into the Mailbag
6274000	6276000	Headfirst, our Mailbag, of course
6276000	6278000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
6278000	6280000	And she's going to dive in headfirst
6280000	6282000	And pick out an email to read
6282000	6284000	Or two, or three, or fifteen, depending on how many people
6284000	6286000	Three, email us this week
6286000	6288000	Dark Sakura, go to it, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
6288000	6290000	If you would like to participate, please do
6290000	6292000	Hey guys, Sturlock here
6292000	6294000	I've tried calling about this a couple of times
6294000	6296000	That I've been unable to get through
6296000	6298000	I was surprised that Loki actually brought the closure
6298000	6300000	Of Nintendo Powerline up as
6300000	6302000	As I've known this for a while
6302000	6304000	Excuse me, I wanted to clarify
6304000	6306000	What the Powerline actually is
6306000	6308000	It's a line you can call to get walkthroughs and tips for games
6308000	6310000	Instead of talking to live individuals
6310000	6312000	The walkthroughs are automated with a menu interface
6312000	6314000	Which makes it quite easy to find the specific information
6314000	6316000	You're looking for on a particular game
6316000	6318000	I have very fond memories of running up
6318000	6320000	My parents' phone bill back in the day
6320000	6322000	Although this is only a regular
6322000	6324000	Long distance call, not even a 900 number
6324000	6326000	The thing I always liked about the Powerline
6326000	6328000	Is that they will frequently have music from the games in question
6328000	6330000	In the background over the person giving the information
6330000	6332000	That's cute
6332000	6334000	By the way, I do want to point out
6334000	6336000	That may be how it is around these days
6336000	6338000	When I was in high school
6338000	6340000	You talked to a person
6340000	6342000	Yeah, go watch The Wizard
6342000	6344000	There's actually a scene where they call
6344000	6346000	The game counselor, it's pretty epic
6346000	6348000	Yeah, I just sat in, you know
6348000	6350000	And jawed with some guy one day about like
6350000	6352000	Weird Zelda stuff and
6352000	6354000	Prototype games one time
6354000	6356000	Because I was bored, I ran up the phone bill
6356000	6358000	I get what he's saying though, he's telling us that it's different
6358000	6360000	Because I think we were reminiscing about that on last week's show
6360000	6362000	Trying to tell us it's a little bit different now than it was then
6362000	6364000	Since I have a lot of memories of this line
6364000	6366000	I've actually been working to record every last game
6366000	6368000	From it I can
6368000	6370000	I know I'm probably the only person on the faceless planet
6370000	6372000	Who actually gives a fuck about this
6372000	6374000	But it's something I'm passionate about
6374000	6376000	I see it as part of my childhood in a way
6376000	6378000	And I don't want to see it go away entirely
6378000	6380000	It's a neat little artifact of the 90s
6380000	6382000	And if nothing else, I'm sorry, if nothing else
6382000	6384000	Sorry for the rambling nature of this message
6384000	6386000	But this is something I feel quite strongly about
6386000	6388000	You might actually be able to petition Nintendo
6388000	6390000	To actually put out DVDs of their
6390000	6392000	Ivor or something
6392000	6394000	If you feel strongly about it, go for it
6394000	6396000	I think that's actually kind of cool
6396000	6398000	If he's recording stuff
6398000	6400000	I don't even know if you have this ability at all
6400000	6402000	But if you've been recording it and you can make MP3s of it
6402000	6404000	Send us one, I'll play one on the show
6404000	6406000	I think it'll be kind of fun to listen to
6406000	6408000	Send us one that you think is really cool
6408000	6410000	This one is from Doug
6410000	6412000	Or Dragonboy
6412000	6414000	Hi Doug Dragonboy
6414000	6416000	I was wondering if any of you were playing any PS1 games
6416000	6418000	On the PSPs
6418000	6420000	I have 23 PS1 games now on my
6420000	6422000	He wrote no, it's supposed to be now
6422000	6424000	On my PSP Go
6424000	6426000	And I love playing them
6426000	6428000	As many PS1 games are far better than PSP games
6428000	6430000	That are available
6430000	6432000	Keep up the great work on the podcast
6432000	6434000	I'm a loyal listener and your podcast is without a doubt
6434000	6436000	My favorite Dragonboy
6436000	6438000	Aw, thank you
6438000	6440000	PS1 games on the PSP?
6440000	6442000	Did they ever do Jumping Flash?
6442000	6444000	Yes they did
6444000	6446000	What about Jumping Flash if you don't have it?
6446000	6448000	Um Jammalammy is a great music game
6448000	6450000	A lot of fun
6450000	6452000	And of course that's one I play personally
6452000	6454000	Suikoden, I have the original
6454000	6456000	And I've played that on the PSP before, that's fun
6456000	6458000	And Final Fantasy 7
6458000	6460000	You might as well go, you know what
6460000	6462000	All the fanboy wank is there for a reason
6462000	6464000	Final Fantasy 7 is pretty good
6464000	6466000	Not the best Final Fantasy game they ever made
6466000	6468000	But pretty darn good
6468000	6470000	Okay, this last one
6470000	6472000	From Rababa
6472000	6474000	Oh, never mind
6474000	6476000	I think it's sort of a continuation from an old email
6476000	6478000	The subject line is iPad mini
6478000	6480000	Maybe iPad nano
6480000	6482000	I only suggested that on the last OLR episode
6482000	6484000	Because the leaked iPhone images
6484000	6486000	Are designed to match the iPad
6486000	6488000	If it played iPad apps
6488000	6490000	It would be a way around the contract
6490000	6492000	With AT&T, the iPad itself
6492000	6494000	Seems like it would qualify
6494000	6496000	As a non-phone since it has
6496000	6498000	No phone capability
6498000	6500000	Well isn't that what the iPod touches for?
6500000	6502000	I'm pretty sure the AT&T network
6502000	6504000	Is used for the iPad for access to the app store
6504000	6506000	By the way, I have an iPad
6506000	6508000	And a netbook and the iPad is just better
6508000	6510000	Let's keep an eye out for an Apple branded
6510000	6512000	Phone for Verizon
6512000	6514000	I still want an iPad
6514000	6516000	I love my netbook though
6516000	6518000	Now the rumor is Apple is going to team up with Sprint
6518000	6520000	Let's hope not
6520000	6522000	Well that's done
6522000	6524000	Alright, if you really want to do that
6524000	6526000	Alright
6526000	6528000	Well thanks for the emails guys
6528000	6530000	You can go to our website
6530000	6532000	If you want to send us some more
6532000	6534000	Couple more news stories
6534000	6536000	Do we have any more? We done?
6536000	6538000	We still have the classic game of the week
6538000	6540000	We'll get to that in a minute
6540000	6542000	Any more news stories for us, Loki?
6542000	6544000	Not really, don't have anything
6544000	6546000	I got one
6546000	6548000	I'll do a couple quick ones
6548000	6550000	I have a couple here that I can do
6550000	6552000	Classic game of the week
6552000	6554000	Dragon Quest 9, Sentinels of the Starry Skies
6554000	6556000	July 11th, finally
6556000	6558000	Ready for US consumption
6558000	6560000	4.2 million sold in Japan
6560000	6562000	And it's finally making its way over here
6562000	6564000	Dragon Quest 9, Sentinels of the Starry Skies
6564000	6566000	And the Nintendo DS
6566000	6568000	That's too bad I knew about that weeks ago
6568000	6570000	I should have mentioned something
6570000	6572000	I always see this stuff and I'm like
6572000	6574000	Damn you, Loki
6574000	6576000	It's like not news for me
6576000	6578000	The crackdown thing is really interesting
6578000	6580000	But again, I hope they're wrong
6580000	6582000	I really do hope they're wrong
6582000	6584000	Other one, I think this is really interesting
6584000	6586000	The NPD report
6586000	6588000	The top selling accessory
6588000	6590000	On the Microsoft Xbox 360
6590000	6592000	You know what the best selling accessory is for the 360?
6592000	6594000	The 1600 point Microsoft
6594000	6596000	Xbox Live card
6596000	6598000	Even though you can buy them with the touch of a button
6598000	6600000	The 1600 point card was the best selling accessory
6600000	6602000	I'm surprised live subscriptions aren't
6602000	6604000	And you know why?
6604000	6606000	Because if you've ever tried to buy a live subscription
6606000	6608000	With a credit card on
6608000	6610000	Their service
6610000	6612000	You're stuck in the stupid auto
6612000	6614000	Renewing shit
6614000	6616000	And it sucks
6616000	6618000	Getting out of it is near impossible
6618000	6620000	So I tell you
6620000	6622000	Man, if you
6622000	6624000	Really are limited on money
6624000	6626000	Spend the time to go out and buy
6626000	6628000	One of those memberships
6628000	6630000	It's a lot better to buy it at the store
6630000	6632000	And have it dumped down
6632000	6634000	To silver again
6634000	6636000	Than having it auto renew all the time
6636000	6638000	And you can't get rid of it
6638000	6640000	It's awful
6640000	6642000	Alright, let's go to the
6642000	6644000	Classic game of the week
6644000	6646000	You ready for this Dark Sakura?
6646000	6648000	May as well be
6648000	6650000	Alright, every week on the program
6650000	6652000	Oh my gosh, you know it's free form tonight
6652000	6654000	Because everything's broken, I don't have the
6654000	6656000	I don't have the song, where's the song?
6656000	6658000	There it is
6658000	6660000	Classic game of the week, every week Dark Sakura
6660000	6662000	Goes into the vault and picks out a classic game
6662000	6664000	She says, hey, you kids
6664000	6666000	Get off my lawn
6666000	6668000	And go play this game
6668000	6670000	A classic game that we all
6670000	6672000	Grew up on
6672000	6674000	I don't know, what constitutes a classic game?
6674000	6676000	Um, it's old
6676000	6678000	What is this week's classic game of the week Dark Sakura?
6678000	6680000	Keyboard Mania
6680000	6682000	How appropriate
6682000	6684000	I know a lot of listeners of the show will be big on this one
6684000	6686000	Keyboard Mania is your classic game of the week
6686000	6688000	Want to hear someone butcher a song on Keyboard Mania?
6688000	6690000	Yeah, let's do that first
6692000	6694000	This is a song called Pink Rose
6694000	6696000	That originated in Keyboard Mania
6696000	6698000	I'm gonna butcher it here a little bit
6712000	6714000	It's not terrible
6714000	6716000	It's a B-
6718000	6720000	And it's not
6720000	6722000	It's not an easy song to play
6722000	6724000	No
6724000	6726000	This person's doing doubles
6726000	6728000	Let's go to the real song here
6728000	6730000	Which, by the way, this is one of my favorite songs
6730000	6732000	Totally in this game
6732000	6734000	Um
6734000	6736000	But actually I really like it better in pop music
6736000	6738000	But, anyway
6738000	6740000	So, um, Keyboard Mania
6740000	6742000	Is one of the Bimani games
6742000	6744000	It has two, um, 24 key keyboards
6744000	6746000	And, um
6746000	6748000	The different notes that come down
6748000	6750000	Correspond
6750000	6752000	To a different key on the keyboard
6752000	6754000	Um
6754000	6756000	And, um
6756000	6758000	Also there's a- you know how BeatMania
6758000	6760000	Had, uh, the BM-98 simulator?
6760000	6762000	Um, there's one called
6762000	6764000	Doremi
6764000	6766000	For a Keyboard Mania simulator for me
6766000	6768000	I get it, doe, a deer, a female deer
6768000	6770000	Yeah
6770000	6772000	Anyway, um, so we got out Keyboard Mania
6772000	6774000	Then, uh, Keyboard Heaven
6774000	6776000	Which is the Korean version
6776000	6778000	Of Keyboard Mania
6778000	6780000	And then Keyboard Mania 2nd Mix
6780000	6782000	Um, 3rd Mix
6782000	6784000	Uh, actually, uh, linked
6784000	6786000	To Drum Mania 4th, Guitar Freaks 5th
6786000	6788000	Um, and
6788000	6790000	Drum Mania 5th, Guitar Freaks
6790000	6792000	6th for certain songs
6792000	6794000	Cause we used to have- Those were epic days
6794000	6796000	At Roseville Golf Land. One of the few arcades
6796000	6798000	Anywhere that had that. There's pictures of all of us
6798000	6800000	Amazing. Playing
6800000	6802000	Like, Jamie would do drums, I would do
6802000	6804000	Keyboard, and, you know, like
6804000	6806000	Bradley would do guitar
6806000	6808000	I don't know if Loki was playing with us then, but
6808000	6810000	I was playing guitar with the other side of the keyboard
6810000	6812000	Good times. You'd always pick keyboard
6812000	6814000	Can I play one of my favorite songs in Keyboard Mania?
6814000	6816000	This kinda sounds like a song
6816000	6818000	This is not Henry Henry
6818000	6820000	No, it's not. This is like a song that would be like an act-raiser or something
6820000	6822000	This is Kyu No Tame No Sonata
6822000	6826000	This-
6826000	6828000	This sounds like the overworld music
6828000	6830000	An act-raiser to me
6830000	6832000	I think it is
6832000	6834000	Like, remember when you were managing your people?
6834000	6836000	This is one of my favorite songs
6836000	6838000	In Keyboard Mania
6838000	6840000	We'll play a little bit of this, then I'll do the
6840000	6842000	Castle Baby song
6842000	6844000	Yeah, the Akumajou
6844000	6846000	Uh, medley
6846000	6848000	Okay, but anyway, um, well
6848000	6850000	There's actually, um
6850000	6852000	Three songs, though, that were big
6852000	6854000	Carryover songs into other Bimani
6854000	6856000	Games. Um, that was
6856000	6858000	Frozen Ray
6858000	6860000	Pink Rose, which we played earlier, and the least
6860000	6862000	Hundred Seconds, which we should actually
6862000	6864000	Play that too, Rob
6864000	6866000	I love Frozen Ray, though
6866000	6868000	Um, but, uh
6868000	6870000	Keyboard Mania, um, had two home versions
6870000	6872000	There was Keyboard Mania, and then
6872000	6874000	Keyboard Mania 2, which was the second and third
6874000	6876000	Mix
6876000	6878000	Um, and it had, uh
6878000	6880000	You know, basically the arcade-style
6880000	6882000	Controller. I don't see
6882000	6884000	Any other way that you could've
6884000	6886000	Had, like, the full arcade-style
6886000	6888000	Controller, like, you know, they brought out for
6888000	6890000	2DX and
6890000	6892000	DDR and all that
6892000	6894000	But the other way is that if you had, um
6894000	6896000	The Windows PC version
6896000	6898000	You get a Yamaha EZ250i
6898000	6900000	Keyboard, um, to play it
6900000	6902000	Which one you've got there?
6902000	6904000	Oh, yeah
6918000	6920000	Someone's butchering it a little bit
6920000	6922000	They're doing pretty good. This is about as good as
6922000	6924000	I would do, probably
6928000	6930000	And I love how, on the interface
6930000	6932000	When it has the little
6932000	6934000	Background music up, you know, screen up there
6934000	6936000	From the arcade
6936000	6938000	The wheel thing always weirded me out, though
6938000	6940000	Like, what the hell was that? It's your scratch!
6940000	6942000	Yeah, but it was a little dumb
6942000	6944000	It was a little dumb
6944000	6946000	I'm kinda glad that, hopefully, uh
6946000	6948000	If we get this keyboard thing in, um
6948000	6950000	Rock Bandit probably won't have that
6950000	6952000	But, I mean, really, there's not much else to say
6952000	6954000	About it other than what I've said, you know
6954000	6956000	It was fairly short-lived
6956000	6958000	For the Bimani series, and, you know
6958000	6960000	It's sad
6960000	6962000	That it didn't do better, you know
6962000	6964000	It was really difficult, though
6970000	6972000	This is one of the few songs
6972000	6974000	Cause, like, when you did that multi-session
6974000	6976000	There was probably, like, six songs you could play
6976000	6978000	This is one of them, at least 100 seconds
6978000	6980000	I love this game
6980000	6982000	This was my favorite Bimani game
6982000	6984000	Oh, okay
6984000	6986000	Because you could also do, um
6986000	6988000	I think there was also a version of Ride on Time
6988000	6990000	I'm pretty sure there was
6990000	6992000	Good stuff
6992000	6994000	Yeah, but
6994000	6996000	The other big song, though, of course, was Frozen Ray
6996000	6998000	Which we got for other versions, too
6998000	7000000	Um, but yeah
7000000	7002000	This
7002000	7004000	I don't remember, though
7004000	7006000	And I want to say
7006000	7008000	It didn't have it
7008000	7010000	Cause keep in mind, I've got
7010000	7012000	Drum Mania IV, Guitar Freaks V
7012000	7014000	For home
7014000	7016000	And Keyboard Mania
7016000	7018000	And I don't think it had Super Session mode
7018000	7020000	For the three
7020000	7022000	No, not on the home version
7022000	7024000	So, which made me very sad
7024000	7026000	Because I was all like
7026000	7028000	Yeah, Super Session, and no
7028000	7030000	The 2-3 mix came out
7030000	7032000	Way later, too
7032000	7034000	And people were pretty convinced
7034000	7036000	The others were never coming out
7036000	7038000	I think I had the first time, and then I borrowed yours
7038000	7040000	For the longest time
7040000	7042000	We basically, I think for a while, had Communal Bimani
7042000	7044000	Yeah, pretty much
7044000	7046000	Because one of us would make sure that we bought a version that no one else had
7046000	7048000	And then we would play the hell out of it
7048000	7050000	And then switch it out with somebody else
7050000	7052000	So we had our Communal Bimani
7052000	7054000	Going on, and we always made sure we knew
7054000	7056000	Who we had our damn game
7056000	7058000	Good times
7058000	7060000	A good Bimani classic
7060000	7062000	Find me a Frozen Ray, Rob
7062000	7064000	You want Frozen Ray?
7064000	7066000	We'll close out with a little bit of Frozen Ray here
7066000	7068000	For the Classic Game of the Week
7068000	7070000	And, uh, let's see
7070000	7072000	Here we go
7072000	7074000	Here's from the PS2
7074000	7076000	Somebody's selecting on the mini list
7076000	7078000	There we go
7080000	7082000	Intruder, good job
7084000	7086000	Jinx
7086000	7090000	That part's really easy to mess up on
7090000	7092000	What I really liked about this game
7092000	7094000	Is that if you, like, could memorize
7094000	7096000	The note patterns
7096000	7098000	You could play the song on a real piano
7098000	7100000	It was the one Bimani game
7100000	7102000	It was closest to a real simulator
7102000	7104000	Was the closest thing to the actual
7104000	7106000	Instrument than anything else
7106000	7108000	It really was, you know
7108000	7110000	I'll tell you one thing that had to help me
7110000	7112000	When learning how to play it
7112000	7114000	Is that, um, it was easier to play it in the arcade
7114000	7116000	Than it was at home
7116000	7118000	Because your keyboard lined up
7118000	7120000	With the keys and didn't move
7120000	7122000	Um, but
7122000	7124000	I would always have to find something
7124000	7126000	To hold my, um, controller stationary
7126000	7128000	And put it right the hell in front of my
7128000	7130000	Of the TV for me to be able to really get it
7130000	7132000	You know, cause otherwise
7132000	7134000	It was, it was
7134000	7136000	Way, it was way too much coordination
7136000	7138000	I think, I mean, 2DX is definitely
7138000	7140000	Easier in terms of building your
7140000	7142000	Hand-eye coordination, and I was never a keyboard player
7142000	7144000	So
7144000	7146000	See, when I was like 5 years old
7146000	7148000	I started taking organ lessons
7148000	7150000	Yeah, the double decker
7150000	7152000	Church organ, you know
7152000	7154000	Completely off topic
7154000	7156000	I found an accordion at the thrift store today
7156000	7158000	Good stuff, did you buy it?
7158000	7160000	I wanted to, it's 85 bucks
7160000	7162000	I bought a Fendi purse for 6 bucks though
7162000	7164000	Anyway, um, that's my thing lately
7164000	7166000	Y'all, by the way, is going to thrift stores
7166000	7168000	And buying designer stuff
7168000	7170000	You get good stuff there, no lie, no joke
7170000	7172000	Anyway, um, so the game of the week
7172000	7174000	Is keyboard mania
7174000	7176000	If none of you have played it, you poor deprived people
7176000	7178000	Go check it out
7178000	7180000	If you can, good luck
7180000	7182000	I'm sure the keytar thing will be pretty cool
7182000	7184000	But it's never going to be as cool as keyboard mania
7184000	7186000	Keytar freaks?
7186000	7188000	Uh, keyboard mania, still I think at Milpitas Golfland
7188000	7190000	At least, I think, last time I was there
7190000	7192000	Might still be there, I don't know
7192000	7194000	It's been a little while
7194000	7196000	Ours has been gone, for ages
7196000	7198000	Alright, uh, one more segment
7198000	7200000	That we have to do on this show every week
7200000	7202000	It's just mandatory for no other reason
7202000	7204000	And sometimes we have to vent a little bit
7218000	7220000	GRRR, FUs of the week, Darcy
7220000	7224000	GRRR, FU to, um, the place which shall not be named
7224000	7228000	Loki?
7228000	7232000	Um, FU to the fact that, uh, this weather changing
7232000	7236000	That's like rain, sun, rain, sun, rain, sun
7236000	7238000	Is really fucking with my allergies
7238000	7240000	Is this really giving you a headache?
7240000	7242000	Uh, yeah, I've been getting headaches the last few days
7242000	7244000	I just took some time a little bit before I came over here
7244000	7246000	My throat now is really dry and scratchy
7246000	7248000	But I think that's from yelling a lot during the show
7248000	7250000	You know, imitating Michael Patrick really
7250000	7252000	Takes a toll on you
7252000	7254000	Oh, the holy name, ah
7254000	7256000	Alright, uh, my FU goes to myself
7256000	7258000	Actually, most things in life are pretty good right now
7258000	7260000	I can't complain
7260000	7262000	Uh, FU to myself, though, because, like, every time I start
7262000	7264000	Like a pattern of good eating habits
7264000	7266000	Like, I guess you could say a diet, if you will
7266000	7268000	I break it within, like, a week and a half
7268000	7270000	There's always something that breaks me
7270000	7272000	And this time it was vacation
7272000	7274000	You should go off
7274000	7276000	Oh god, no
7276000	7278000	Like, I know my limits
7278000	7280000	Props to you for having that sort of discipline
7280000	7282000	For a fact, I could do it
7282000	7284000	By the way, I'm not 100% raw, you know
7284000	7286000	And I had a beer the other day, and it totally
7286000	7288000	Oh my god
7288000	7290000	And it totally made my face break out
7290000	7292000	So, I have no more beer
7292000	7294000	I've lost 16 pounds, Rob
7294000	7296000	For you? Good for you, that's great
7296000	7298000	Wish I could lose 16 pounds, bitch
7298000	7300000	Alright
7300000	7302000	Hey!
7302000	7304000	You were on your, uh, involuntary toast diet
7304000	7306000	Yeah, that was bad
7306000	7308000	That was bad
7308000	7310000	That was bad. You know things are bad
7310000	7312000	When you kinda almost wish you would get sick again
7312000	7314000	So you could be that thin again
7314000	7316000	Remember when I had pneumonia?
7316000	7318000	I really don't want that, I really don't
7318000	7320000	I do not recommend anybody lose weight by pneumonia
7320000	7322000	It's not fun
7322000	7324000	Well, no, I got, I lost
7324000	7326000	Actually, I shouldn't joke, like, that can't kill people
7326000	7328000	I lost 35 pounds when I had pneumonia
7328000	7330000	I was sick for three months, they thought I had whooping cough
7330000	7332000	But it turned out that they were just
7332000	7334000	Not paying attention
7334000	7338000	Yay, unnamed healthcare company that Jamie has
7338000	7340000	I called it the plague
7340000	7342000	Alright, let's wrap up
7342000	7344000	We're done, we don't have any other game stories
7344000	7346000	Right, Loki, you burned through them all, we're good
7346000	7348000	Yeah, we're done. Dark Sakura, alright
7348000	7350000	Loki's ready to go
7350000	7352000	It's hot in here
7352000	7354000	I thought we'd only be going an hour, we gave you two
7354000	7356000	What the hell are you thinking, Rob?
7356000	7358000	Hey, you were here too, lady
7358000	7360000	It's my house
7360000	7362000	It's my house
7362000	7364000	You're gonna fuck out
7364000	7366000	Then I am, goodnight
7366000	7368000	Bye, goodbye
7368000	7370000	You've been listening
7370000	7372000	No, we have to do final thoughts, we can't do that yet
7372000	7374000	Final thoughts, Dark Sakura
7374000	7376000	Hey, my final thought list, this is my house
7376000	7378000	If you don't like it, you get the fuck out
7378000	7380000	Loki, your final thought
7380000	7382000	Uh, I can't wait to edit some more
7382000	7384000	Granted, I thought it was gonna be awesome
7384000	7386000	Hire me
7386000	7388000	My final thought is I'm stopping getting fast food on the way home
7388000	7390000	And ruining my diet some more, yay
7390000	7392000	I did that today because I bought
7392000	7394000	the wrong kind of bread, you know, I buy this like
7394000	7396000	you know, whole wheat bread or whatever
7396000	7398000	And I bought the wrong brand, so it was really
7398000	7400000	it just had the wrong texture and just
7400000	7402000	tasted weird, so I'm like
7402000	7404000	McDonald's
7404000	7406000	But I've been pretty good, I haven't been going to fast food
7406000	7408000	except for today
7408000	7410000	My other final thought, my mom's gonna be
7410000	7412000	pissed when she finds out who won American Idol
7412000	7414000	Who did?
7414000	7416000	Dweiss, or whatever
7416000	7418000	He sucked last night
7418000	7420000	I don't want shit any of this season
7420000	7422000	I know, I barely do, I did like that Crystal Bowers socks
7422000	7424000	I thought she was good because somebody showed me her
7424000	7426000	And apparently Alanis came out to duet with her tonight
7426000	7428000	Okay, I have to see
7428000	7430000	That I have to see
7430000	7432000	Doesn't go with the dreads, right?
7432000	7434000	He sucked last night
7434000	7436000	That was the chick with the dreads, right?
7436000	7438000	She's cool
7438000	7440000	No, she lost, just like Adam and I lost last year
7440000	7442000	You know what, I did actually
7442000	7444000	My mom's gonna be pissed, you know what?
7444000	7446000	You wanna call my mom and tell her?
7446000	7448000	About the week, Rob
7448000	7450000	I have to tell you, I did
7450000	7452000	actually buy
7452000	7454000	some of the stuff off of Alison Irajeda's album
7454000	7456000	Okay, clearly the game
7456000	7458000	part of the show is over
7458000	7460000	So, if you were here for the video games
7460000	7462000	then goodnight
7462000	7464000	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio
7464000	7466000	Orange Lounge Radio
7466000	7468000	is an Orange Lounge
7468000	7470000	production
7470000	7472000	To join us for a live show, visit
7472000	7474000	www.allgames.com
7474000	7476000	No, I talked over to this gamer
7476000	7478000	Blah, blah, blah
7478000	7480000	All games, listen to them, they rule
7480000	7482000	Yes, they do
7482000	7484000	Yes, they do
7484000	7486000	Shh, no they don't
7486000	7488000	But they do have my competitor
7494000	7496000	No, we won't
7496000	7498000	We'll see you in two weeks
7498000	7500000	Let's go on
7500000	7502000	She's watching it right now, too
7502000	7504000	Your mom's so funny
7504000	7506000	Oh, don't ruin it for her
7510000	7512000	Oh, then we're calling right now
7512000	7514000	Hello
7514000	7516000	Hi mom
7516000	7518000	Who is this?
7518000	7520000	It's Rob, your kid
7520000	7522000	I already know who won
7522000	7524000	Damn it
7524000	7526000	I was calling
7526000	7528000	Why are you laughing?
7528000	7530000	Why are you laughing?
7530000	7532000	Why are you laughing?
7532000	7534000	We're on the radio right now
7534000	7536000	and I was calling because I read it on the internet
7536000	7538000	and I wanted to spoil it for you
7538000	7540000	I got on the internet at
7540000	7542000	7 o'clock, I'm not stupid
7542000	7544000	She was Rob
7544000	7546000	This is weird, my mother
7546000	7548000	Now admit it, mom
7548000	7550000	a year ago, you made me
7550000	7552000	go online and look it up
7552000	7554000	You didn't know how to do this
7554000	7556000	Yeah, but I don't need your help anymore
7556000	7558000	Is this why you decided to
7558000	7560000	Did you hear that?
7560000	7562000	You got served
7562000	7564000	I'm not on the radio, am I?
7564000	7566000	Yeah, you are, it's okay
7566000	7568000	You don't mind, do you?
7568000	7570000	My mom said that I had to text her
7570000	7572000	and warn her before we call
7572000	7574000	Mom, this is the part after the credits
7574000	7576000	so no one's listening, it's cool
7576000	7580000	Are you watching the finale anyway?
7580000	7582000	I didn't watch the first half
7582000	7584000	I said I'm not gonna watch it
7584000	7586000	because I'm too mad
7586000	7588000	I couldn't stand it, so I turned it on
7588000	7590000	Now, did you or did you not tell me last year
7590000	7592000	First off, who should have won last year?
7592000	7594000	Adam
7594000	7596000	I know, right?
7596000	7598000	And why should Adam have won last year?
7598000	7600000	Because he was by far the best
7600000	7602000	And what made him the best?
7602000	7604000	He just was, he was more of a showman
7604000	7606000	He was the best
7606000	7608000	That's why that Chris guy is selling
7608000	7610000	his stuff on QVC
7610000	7612000	and Adam's touring
7612000	7616000	I did like Alison
7616000	7618000	Explain why you...
7618000	7620000	Yes, I like Alison too
7620000	7622000	and she's doing okay because I saw her on
7622000	7624000	I bought her album
7624000	7626000	It's actually really good
7626000	7628000	Hold on, you guys are talking last year's news
7628000	7630000	I wanna talk this year again
7630000	7632000	I'm still reeling over David Cook, pardon me
7632000	7634000	Well, okay, last night
7634000	7636000	Lee stunk
7636000	7638000	His first single's gonna be a beautiful day
7638000	7640000	and it was awful
7640000	7642000	It was terrible
7642000	7644000	The one that she did was really good
7644000	7646000	and I was hoping that would come out on
7646000	7648000	a CD because I'd like to buy it
7648000	7650000	I think maybe she's gonna be more
7650000	7652000	Don't you think the runner-ups
7652000	7654000	often fare better unless you're the beatboxing guy?
7654000	7656000	In the last few years
7656000	7658000	they have, and the reason they have
7658000	7660000	is because, and I've told you this before
7660000	7662000	it becomes a popularity contest
7662000	7664000	in the end and the little girls
7664000	7666000	all vote for the cute guys
7666000	7668000	Except for David Cook because I thought
7668000	7670000	David Cook did not have nearly the talent
7670000	7672000	that David Cook had
7672000	7674000	Well, I
7674000	7676000	And David Cook is
7676000	7678000	I think it wasn't so much that he didn't have
7678000	7680000	the talent that he was really young
7680000	7682000	That was my mother respectfully disagreeing with you
7682000	7684000	Did you hear that? Did you hear that?
7684000	7686000	I know the tone
7686000	7688000	I honestly, personally
7688000	7690000	I think that David Cook had better stage presence
7690000	7692000	but that's me
7692000	7694000	Well, he probably did, but he was older
7694000	7696000	and more mature
7696000	7698000	same way as this year with Aaron
7698000	7700000	cause I thought Aaron was really a good singer
7700000	7702000	but he was only 17
7702000	7704000	and he didn't have the
7704000	7706000	you know, he didn't have the charisma and stuff
7706000	7708000	I had him in my third place spot
7708000	7710000	I was picking, well originally when we had
7710000	7712000	cause we had a work pool for this
7712000	7714000	I had Crystal, Casey, and Aaron
7714000	7716000	cause Lee, at the time, I mean
7716000	7718000	it was like a good, you know
7718000	7720000	before, I think it was at the top ten
7720000	7722000	Well he didn't start out to be one of the better ones
7722000	7724000	he started out, really
7724000	7726000	he just sounded like
7726000	7728000	a bunch of mainstream artists now
7728000	7730000	Okay, I have to
7730000	7732000	I like Big Mike too
7732000	7734000	I have to ask you this, because I just
7734000	7736000	you know, you said last year, when Adam lost last year
7736000	7738000	you said, and I quote,
7738000	7740000	I am never watching that show again
7740000	7742000	because the person that should win never does
7742000	7744000	and yet, you watched this year
7744000	7746000	No, they used to, but
7746000	7748000	lately it hasn't been that way
7748000	7750000	Well, did Reuben deserve to beat Clay?
7750000	7752000	No, Clay deserved it by far
7752000	7754000	Okay, actually if
7754000	7756000	you don't mind me asking, because
7756000	7758000	I'm of two minds about this too
7758000	7760000	Did you prefer Carrie Underwood
7760000	7762000	or Bo Bice?
7762000	7764000	Oh, I preferred Carrie Underwood
7764000	7766000	Most of the time I've been for the person that's won
7766000	7768000	there's been a few times
7768000	7770000	so that I thought the second place one should've won
7770000	7772000	See, I'm from Alabama
7772000	7774000	so Bo Bice automatically got my vote
7774000	7776000	And you're biased, that's fine
7776000	7778000	And he sang with Lynyrd Skynyrd, how could you go wrong with that?
7778000	7780000	Okay, I have to ask my mother though
7780000	7782000	Are you gonna make the threat that you're not watching next year?
7782000	7784000	I don't think
7784000	7786000	with Simon gone, I don't think it's gonna be
7786000	7788000	nearly as popular
7788000	7790000	Are divas leaving?
7790000	7792000	Who do you think should replace Simon?
7792000	7794000	I don't think there's anybody
7794000	7796000	that can replace him
7796000	7798000	It's just like when they
7798000	7800000	took Paula off, the show lost something
7800000	7802000	What are the names they're throwing around?
7802000	7804000	Elton John, could Elton John replace Simon?
7804000	7806000	No
7806000	7808000	You know who I want to replace Simon?
7808000	7810000	Graham Norton
7810000	7812000	Who?
7812000	7814000	Graham Norton, he's a talk show host
7814000	7816000	He's funny
7816000	7818000	What about Perez Hilton?
7818000	7820000	Well some people have suggested
7820000	7822000	Howard Stern too
7822000	7824000	He wants to do it
7824000	7826000	Howard Stern
7826000	7828000	it's like a big joke gone out of control
7828000	7830000	and Perez Hilton is just a bitch
7830000	7832000	And it would turn into a
7832000	7834000	dirty show if Howard Stern got on
7834000	7836000	What else
7836000	7838000	was I gonna say?
7838000	7840000	The X Factor, Simon's new
7840000	7842000	show that Paula is rumored to be a judge
7842000	7844000	Suddenly it's the reality TV podcast
7844000	7846000	No, no, she got a dance show
7846000	7848000	She's gonna do a dance show
7848000	7850000	Where have you been? Are you into rock or something?
7850000	7852000	Sorry, I'm doing a show on video games
7852000	7854000	It makes sense for me
7854000	7856000	I'm a games analyst, did you hear?
7856000	7858000	No
7858000	7860000	How'd you get to be a games analyst?
7860000	7862000	I told Robbie I was
7862000	7864000	Yeah, Jamie told me I was
7864000	7866000	In other words
7866000	7868000	you're a games analyst
7868000	7870000	in your own mind
7870000	7872000	That's not what my business card says
7872000	7874000	but sure
7874000	7876000	I'm an authority on Idol in my
7876000	7878000	own mind too
7878000	7880000	Well then she's the official
7880000	7882000	Rob's mom, the official
7882000	7884000	American Idol
7884000	7886000	analyst for Orange Lounge Radio
7886000	7888000	I just used my
7888000	7890000	female powers of always being right to make
7890000	7892000	Rob an analyst
7892000	7894000	Alright, X Factor
7894000	7896000	Yes or no? Are you gonna watch it?
7896000	7898000	Probably because I think it will be a much better show
7898000	7900000	because it won't be
7900000	7902000	relying on the public
7902000	7904000	to pick the winner
7904000	7906000	Ok, one more then I promise I'm wrapping this up
7906000	7908000	That little 11 year old kid that Ellen DeGeneres
7908000	7910000	I know you watch her show everyday, right?
7910000	7912000	Absolutely great
7912000	7914000	He's got that Bieber kid beat to it
7914000	7916000	He's so much better
7916000	7918000	This is why I love my mother
7918000	7920000	His name is
7920000	7922000	Chance
7922000	7924000	His first name is Grayson
7924000	7926000	Grayson Chance
7926000	7928000	He's absolutely great
7928000	7930000	Did you watch Glee last night?
7930000	7932000	They did Gaga
7932000	7934000	Where were you?
7934000	7936000	I have to ask my mother
7936000	7938000	this
7938000	7940000	About this whole thing
7940000	7942000	Rob I adore your mom
7942000	7944000	I know, she's pretty cool
7944000	7946000	Now I forgot what I was gonna ask
7946000	7948000	Glee
7948000	7950000	Grayson Chance and the
7950000	7952000	Bieber
7952000	7954000	Since you're hooked up to the internet now
7954000	7956000	You know how to use Google?
7956000	7958000	Yeah, absolutely
7958000	7960000	I want you to Google this website
7960000	7962000	Lesbians that look like Justin Bieber
7962000	7964000	There's
7964000	7966000	probably a lot of them with that haircut he's got
7966000	7968000	There is
7968000	7970000	There's a whole blog dedicated
7970000	7972000	to lesbians that look like Justin Bieber
7972000	7974000	You should see Rob right now, he's all red in the face
7974000	7976000	This is my mother
7976000	7978000	My mom likes Lady Gaga
7978000	7980000	Do you like Lady Gaga?
7980000	7982000	Yeah
7982000	7984000	She didn't use to
7984000	7986000	She thought Lady Gaga was disgusting
7986000	7988000	But then when I said Lady Gaga is cool
7988000	7990000	My mom came around
7990000	7992000	I'm still not coming around
7992000	7994000	I never said she was disgusting, I never really paid that much attention
7994000	7996000	You said when she did that performance
7996000	7998000	When she set the piano on fire
7998000	8000000	Whiskey bottles and stuff
8000000	8002000	You were like, oh no
8002000	8004000	You were mad because Adam Lambert
8004000	8006000	Got in trouble over kissing a guy
8006000	8008000	And everybody else
8008000	8010000	had grabbed their crotch
8010000	8012000	And everything, right?
8012000	8014000	And worse things were done by other people
8014000	8016000	And they didn't pay attention to it, that's what made me mad
8016000	8018000	That's what he said himself
8018000	8020000	He's like, well if all these other people can get away with it
8020000	8022000	Why shouldn't I be able to?
8022000	8024000	Exactly, on the same show
8024000	8026000	I can't remember, was it Janet Jackson?
8026000	8028000	I don't remember, somebody
8028000	8030000	Did something worse
8030000	8032000	Alright
8032000	8034000	They didn't even say anything
8034000	8036000	But I think he's getting past that now
8036000	8038000	And I'm glad
8038000	8040000	Because I don't think people
8040000	8042000	Um
8042000	8044000	You know, they're not being that judgemental
8044000	8046000	About him anymore
8046000	8048000	We have to wrap up this extremely random
8048000	8050000	Epilogue that's had nothing to do with
8050000	8052000	Video games whatsoever, is there any video games you're excited
8052000	8054000	There's an American Idol video game
8054000	8056000	Are there any video games you're excited about, mom?
8056000	8058000	I don't do video games
8058000	8060000	Are you going to play Farmville?
8060000	8064000	I absolutely know nothing about video games
8064000	8066000	You don't know Farmville?
8066000	8068000	Is that the one that
8068000	8070000	My friend was playing on the internet
8070000	8072000	Where you own a farm and you try to make money
8072000	8074000	She knows Farmville
8074000	8076000	There you go, see, she's a bigger gamer
8076000	8078000	Well she was playing that on the internet, she got hooked on it
8078000	8080000	Alright
8080000	8082000	You officially know more about the internet
8082000	8084000	Than my grandmother does
8084000	8086000	Congratulations
8086000	8088000	I don't know, I don't know a lot
8088000	8090000	She's come a long way in a year
8090000	8092000	No, I remember
8092000	8094000	I don't want to give out my mom's email on the show
8094000	8096000	But it's really funny
8096000	8098000	Absolutely not
8098000	8100000	I'm not, but it's really funny
8100000	8102000	Like if you know her email, it's really funny
8102000	8104000	But I actually remember a couple years ago
8104000	8106000	Actually we gave you a call a few years ago
8106000	8108000	And tried to ask you about something and you didn't
8108000	8110000	Know because it was online
8110000	8112000	My mom's on the internet
8112000	8114000	My grandmother's on the internet now
8114000	8116000	My dad is on Facebook
8116000	8118000	I think that the apocalypse is happening
8118000	8120000	Well I won't do Facebook
8120000	8122000	Why do you not want to go on Facebook?
8122000	8124000	Because I don't want to put my face on
8124000	8126000	There for a day, see
8126000	8128000	Alright
8128000	8130000	Mom, we gotta wrap up and put the nail in the coffin
8130000	8132000	At the show, but thanks for being a good sport

8144000	8146000	She's hung up on me

8148000	8150000	Okay, so Rob, next show that we do, we're calling my mother
