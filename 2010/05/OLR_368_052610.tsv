11418	11924	and Loki.
31638	39964	Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 368 of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.
40225	41346	But not tonight, apparently.
41426	44608	Tonight's going to be a little bit different and I will get to that in just a moment.
44728	48871	But my name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours, maybe hour, I don't know.
48931	53355	We'll see how long we go tonight with my co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
53857	55918	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
79395	81936	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
104162	105183	I had to go fix a tire.
105543	107224	So, unfortunately, the live show didn't happen.
107305	108846	So, apologies to you kids.
108886	113489	And, of course, Loki and DarkSakura who clear their schedules every Sunday night and I wasn't even here.
113709	114610	I'm a bad person.
114790	115391	That's okay.
115431	118073	I had more Red Dead Redemption to play.
118093	123697	I was going to say, you guys probably figured out something to do to kill time because I knew pretty early in the day it wasn't going to happen.
123977	125118	I hung out with Becky.
125298	125879	Well, awesome.
126079	127000	You got girl time.
127340	128361	Ew, girl stuff.
128401	131423	And we went to Fresh Choice and ate salad.
131483	132163	Ew, salad.
134104	135225	I can't condemn the kind of behavior.
156852	160674	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
183206	187347	It's Wednesday, so we're actually midweek, and that's where we're at.
187387	192168	We're kind of taping this as a bridge to fill two weeks of no live shows.
192448	195009	I do want to point out, though, we will be off Memorial Day.
195389	199290	Our next live show will be at allgames.com at 6 p.m.
199570	205071	Pacific time on Sunday, June 6th will be the next live show.
205131	209052	And that's right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
209072	211973	And, of course, we always have our chat room at chat.orangelounge.com.
212793	215634	So Rob, you said 6pm specific time.
215894	216474	Specific.
216554	217855	At a specific time.
218195	218335	It's 6!
219475	220495	Specifically at 6!
221076	221496	I'm sorry.
221796	226417	I meant to say 6 Pacific, but I kind of... You actually did, but you started... I have to give you a hard time.
226737	231819	See, right now, you've got me in the middle of the week on hump day, when my spirit hasn't quite been broken.
233239	239021	You know, and I'm, you know, I'm not doing the... What's tomorrow?
239201	242342	So wait, we might get good mood Jamie tonight.
243943	244604	I'm just teasing.
245465	246746	And you're full of salad.
246786	247727	You ought to be in a great mood.
248208	249709	Actually, I'm not full of salad right now.
249749	250490	I'm full of taco.
250750	251010	Okay.
251090	251731	Ooh, tacos.
252091	264123	I had, because we have to do food, I had refried black beans and brown Spanish rice on a sprouted green tortilla.
265324	265645	Yum.
265665	265725	Yum.
266030	274136	I haven't eaten dinner yet, and I'm smelling Loki's chicken, so... That's why I ate, because he brings his chicken in, and I'm like, yum.
274236	275116	Wait, I can't eat that.
275136	276677	I just didn't want burgers tonight.
276978	277418	It's all good.
277478	278559	Rob, do you want me to make you some dinner?
278779	279319	No, no, no.
280100	287425	I gotta stop by and get some stuff for the big road trip, because I am driving 10 hours to Portland, Oregon, and I've never taken a road trip that long.
288165	289106	I've never been to Oregon.
289126	290267	You should get some raw nuts.
292248	292748	For the trip?
293049	294289	Raw nuts and dried fruit.
294429	294850	Good times.
295410	295670	All right.
296690	301071	Here's the other interesting thing about tonight's show and what might make this show a little special.
302411	303472	We don't have a script tonight.
303592	305572	Usually we have – not that the show is scripted.
305612	306372	It's live and fun.
306412	307933	But we usually have like an outline.
307953	311893	We call it a show role and you've probably heard us refer to it before, a little behind the scenes there.
312874	315114	We do have like a list of who's going to cover what topic.
315154	320355	That way we're not stepping on each other's toes and we kind of know who's going to talk about what and we have a general flow to the show.
320795	321515	Not tonight.
322075	323236	We're winging it tonight.
323256	324556	This is going to be like the old days.
325256	326417	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
342941	344382	I gamed, Rob, I gamed.
345823	359695	I played Portal, because it was free, and it's really hard to get used to the controls on, you know, from going from playing on a controller to playing on my PC, but it's pretty cool.
360035	364379	And I, of course, played a lot of Star Trek Online, because I've got a week off, you know, I'm out of school.
364819	368622	And it's like, I've got all this stuff I have to focus on, but I so haven't been able to, so...
369864	375729	Dan's Playing More Grand Theft Horse Dan's Playing More Grand Theft Horse
388422	390003	It was a bay horse and I liked it.
390023	390904	It was pretty.
390924	391284	Whatever.
391864	392264	So yeah.
392304	396187	And he was picking his, you know, gristled cowboys out picking flowers for this old guy.
397067	400990	And then Pac-Man.
401050	401690	Google Pac-Man.
402771	405392	Because Namco had their 25th?
411581	418852	30th Anniversary and so the Google Splash thing was a playable version of Pac-Man and if you go to google.com slash Pac-Man you can actually go back and play it.
420080	424541	What's impressive about that, if I recall, I was reading up on it, it's not like Flash.
425122	426502	It's not Java.
426782	432423	It's using some pretty basic web technology to bring it to you, which is really impressive, the programming.
432683	434984	And actually, I was checking out the Twitter earlier.
435024	437225	Somebody on Twitter is going to have us talk about that a little more.
438305	441986	It looks like it actually resulted in a lot of lost productivity at work.
442626	465010	fascinating was it CNET or one of those news sites posted about how much had been lost and then it went on saying that that's really nothing compared to the little five minutes at a time people sneak on reading Wikipedia from their desk right so they're using it as a scapegoat and as an excuse to ban Google
465550	465871	You know what?
465911	466832	From work sites?
467092	468433	We're free form tonight.
468453	469735	Let me jump over to Twitter real quick.
469755	474880	I'm going to jump over to Twitter real quick and read one of the tweets we got earlier.
475521	479946	Even though we're not live and we don't have the chatter tonight, we did post on Twitter, hey, give us stories.
479986	487194	We'll still try to interact with you best we can because, you know, we can't just go to all games and say, we want to be live right now because I think there's another show on right now, so...
488270	490534	Um, it was from Dr. Noir.
491214	492296	Dr. N-O-I-R.
492356	492957	Dr. Noir.
493337	497523	Here's the fallout from Google's Pac-Man tribute sending us a tweet from BBC News.
498683	506108	The playable version of the classic video game was put on Google's front page on 21st of May to celebrate 30 years since the launch of Pac-Man in Japan.
507048	513472	Now, there were statistics gathered by the software firm Rescue Time about how much this damn thing was actually played.
513912	518475	On a typical day, it suggests that most people will do about 22 searches on the Google page.
518875	520476	Each one lasts about 11 seconds.
520896	525599	But putting Pac-Man on the front page, it boosted that time by an average of about 36 seconds.
527040	531383	and that would be based on the browsing habits of 11,000 rescue time users.
531443	536647	I guess it's the software that companies install on their computers to know who's being naughty on the internet when they're not supposed to be.
537887	551717	And so, let's see, they did all the math and they figured that with 504 million unique users who visit the main Google page per day, that means 4.8 million hours, 549 years were wasted on Pac-Man.
551757	554058	Assuming that people are paid on average $25 an hour, really?
557160	559942	I know, I was like, I want to know where that is so I can work there.
560162	563064	Or $17.50 if you want to convert it to pounds an hour.
563404	565205	This equates to about $120 million in lost productivity.
569696	570997	It's topical like hydrocortisone.
592250	595793	It was, it emulated the original Pac-Man pretty well.
595813	596394	It was pretty fun.
596754	600698	Except there's this one part where there's the grid a little bit off where the last E is.
601238	608025	Because the little place you enter in on the E is actually sort of just off center from where the escape door is.
608045	608525	Yes, yes.
608665	613209	And then the G is just weird because you have like this dead end tunnel you don't really have on a Pac-Man board usually.
613770	615892	I mean, it was a great concept.
616468	618129	You know what I hope for for the 35th?
618650	619711	Super Pac-Man Google.
620551	620891	Lordy.
621092	621472	Because Ms.
621512	624314	Pac-Man already made a cameo in the other one if you clicked insert coin.
624454	624694	Anyway.
624895	625715	This is true, Rob.
626276	627957	Anything else in your gaming week you want to report for us?
628817	631179	I got my Sims 3 working again, so I've been playing more Sims.
631299	636565	As you can see here, I'm back to my hunt for... That's a Sims site?
636825	641510	I thought you were shopping for Ikea or something over there.
641550	641851	That's crazy.
641871	647577	There's people who've actually tried to... Ikea and EA had this deal going on for a while where...
651657	655643	They had some of their standard stuff available for Sims 2.
655723	661411	Now did your Sims have to actually build it and get frustrated as hell when they couldn't understand the instructions because they're nothing but pictures?
661711	661931	No.
663550	679233	But there's people, though, who miss the Ikea stuff and have really gone... I'm looking at some of the furniture on here, and this is actually some... As a design major, Rob, this is actually pretty impressive stuff.
680274	684375	If anyone wants to know the sites that I go to for my Sims stuff, I go to the Sims Resource.
685555	687375	I actually have a subscription to the Sims Resource.
687835	690076	Mod the Sims is good, but Stylist Sims...
691016	697000	is has got some really it's got donation stuff and I don't really advocate donation items, you know, because you have to pay for them.
697100	699481	But at the same time, people did put work into this stuff.
700722	705144	But there's some absolutely gorgeous design stuff I would really have in my actual house.
705725	707626	What should I be able to afford it ever?
708546	711027	I'm surprised Sims doesn't have something like that.
711107	720731	In World of Warcraft, you can go through certain websites and you can get an actual figure of your WoW character from the data it pulls down from the armory.
722131	725033	It's crazy how interactive some of this stuff is now.
725073	731735	I'm surprised you can't buy a fake Sims house that's your actual Sims house, if that makes any sense at all.
732535	733636	I know what you mean.
734116	734757	Yeah, I had to make a mission.
749730	750090	Outro Music
768137	770158	Yeah, I never had to do that.
770739	775822	We would instead, every so often, head down to the museum downtown.
776142	782966	Because keep in mind, where I'm from, you just sneeze and you'll hit something that's been around since the 18th century.
785087	799487	and there's I was actually showing Loki before you got here some of the old Victorian homes if you look up Victorian homes Mobile, Alabama you will see some absolutely gorgeous places but the museum downtown recreated a lot of these in doll size
800558	801158	We had it there too.
816388	820791	and I'm like, okay, you come out to California in 113 degree weather and you pan.
820811	822452	That was another stupid thing we did as kids.
822552	826774	We used to go take the bus up to Sutter's Fort or whatever and do gold panning.
826814	827295	Sutter's Mill.
827695	828335	Or Sutter's Mill.
828415	829676	Sorry, Sutter's Fort is a place downtown.
829716	831617	We also used to actually go out to reservations.
832157	832398	Really?
833038	833839	I've been to a couple pal-outs.
833859	835499	I go to reservations now, but I go gambling.
837210	840494	I've actually been out to, I've actually been to about five powwows.
841775	851566	But I mean, there's, it's, we never really had to do anything, you know, not really, I don't want to say stupid, but time wasting like that, I guess.
852447	858193	Because, first of all, with some of the stupid children You know parents hated that shit because they had to do half of it.
859591	867536	But we did have to do, we had a lot of focus on doing actual full science projects and experiments and real lab time.
868676	870717	The worst was when I got to high school.
870918	872939	Have I talked about this on the show before in my high school?
873199	875180	The Whitey McWhite High?
875580	876120	DarkSakura.com
891785	893227	Right from a John Hughes movie.
893447	895809	But, you know, you had all these spoiled-ass little rich kids.
895950	898912	Like, I'm sure they were, like, hiring people to do their school projects.
898952	902276	It was pretty, like, you know, we had to build the houses and stuff.
902296	905979	They would be made from, like, actual stone and all this stuff.
906019	907501	And it's just like, you spoiled bitch.
909242	911044	Mine's made out of popsicle sticks.
911585	914628	Where I actually had to eat all the popsicles over the course of, like, three months.
914668	915008	That's true.
915188	915488	That's true.
916349	918770	Now you can just go to Michael's and get a bag of popsicle sticks.
919230	919450	I know.
920591	930355	And I'm like, goddamn ungrateful kids who didn't have to realize the value of the popsicles that come with two sticks because they're just two popsicles glued together.
930375	931375	I don't even remember what they're called.
931895	932936	You can get fudgesicles like that.
932956	934436	What the hell tangent is this show on right now?
934456	934896	You know what I miss?
935336	936037	Pudding Pops.
936417	937577	They're still around, aren't they?
937997	938598	They came back.
938718	940719	I miss Pudding Pop commercials.
940819	941519	Those were the best.
942619	944280	Dude, because it's all about Bill Cosby.
946064	949226	But, you know, you remember one of my favorite comics ever is Bloom County.
949707	953730	And I always liked that, um, what was the guy's name?
954510	958714	But his dad, Bill Cosby, lived in his anxiety closet with Pudding Pops.
960495	963577	Cosby here with a special report from Jell-O brand Pudding Pops.
963938	966099	Mothers, do your kids talk like this?
966540	969002	Chocolate, Jell-O, swirl.
969542	972784	Don't worry, they're just asking for Jell-O Pudding Pops swirls.
972804	974606	Good news for your mom and you, mom.
977010	978371	That wasn't one of the better commercials.
978391	979392	Sounds delicious.
979533	980193	Fake newscast.
980233	980413	I know.
980433	981434	Now you got me fucking hungry.
981454	981875	Pudding Pops.
982175	982435	Rude.
982836	983076	All right.
983797	985599	I want to go back a little bit.
985679	986620	Something you were mentioning earlier.
986640	987961	Do they even make Pudding Pops anymore?
988121	989723	I just said they brought them back.
990604	992065	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
992105	992846	Hello, Loki.
993266	994308	I'm working on the show.
994488	994848	All right.
994888	995349	Fine.
996049	997951	He wants to do this thing called news.
999052	1004516	We're trying to fucking talk about pudding pops and Loki's concerned with gaming news as if we are a video game talk show.
1005277	1008239	When we're done though with the gaming week though, I do need to make a plug.
1009249	1010490	or do you want me to do it now?
1010570	1018535	you can do it now but I want to say one other thing about your gaming week because you said earlier that Portal is a bitch to control on the computer yes so I want to give you a pro tip awesome and a lot of people forget about this controller?
1018915	1031003	Xbox 360 controllers they're USB you can plug them right in if you have a wired one I honestly think the wired 360 controllers are almost a better purchase than the wireless ones at least have one you know
1031223	1032083	I think I've got one.
1032183	1033304	Yeah, I have one.
1033344	1035224	I think I have like three controllers and one of them is wired.
1035244	1039825	And it's great because I can go to the computer and use it there and it's pretty awesome.
1039845	1042326	But I have kind of gotten the hang of doing some of the puzzles.
1042346	1047647	It's just I keep forgetting that I look... Well, see, I've got a thumb trackball on my mouse.
1048187	1051688	So looking around with the trackball is kind of difficult for me.
1052268	1059230	And then remembering that, you know, I wish it's just that I could have my action button like in Resident Evil back in the day.
1059770	1070033	And hold my action button and turn around and walk You know, but Okay, you want to plug something I think I know what you want to plug And if it is what I think it is, then cool I was wondering when we could say something about this
1070706	1072988	Geek Cube Geek Cube Geek Cube Geek Cube
1099148	1109753	and, but we're, instead of being game specific or, you know, anime specific or something, we're geek, total geek.
1109813	1111534	It's just nerdy, geeky, dorky fun.
1111974	1112974	Nerdy, geeky, dorky fun.
1113094	1113795	That's right.
1113815	1115275	I wonder if that domain name's taken.
1115375	1116416	Nerdy, geeky, dorky fun.
1116736	1117998	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1132273	1135056	I'll try to contribute once in a while if you lovely ladies will have me.
1135376	1136117	Of course we'll have you.
1136637	1137098	For dinner.
1137218	1140501	But it'll have to be game or something related because that's what I know.
1141081	1142202	I'll do a wow column.
1142783	1144224	Oh, God.
1144865	1148769	Well, I'm going to have other side projects too coming up and I know you and I have been talking about one.
1148809	1152212	Hopefully E3 this year we'll have a press conference of our own and it'll be fun.
1153572	1154293	Good stuff in the future.
1154313	1165516	Well, the other thing, too, is that I'm planning on doing a DIY segment, you know, maybe once a week on there, too, about little do-it-yourself projects, you know, how to decoupage.
1166136	1167497	Oh, God, geek decoupage?
1167797	1170798	Dude, I've got my Bauhaus picture back there.
1170818	1171378	That's pretty cool.
1171398	1172478	That's art geek decoupage.
1172898	1174699	But, yeah, I mean, that's the general thing.
1175299	1176679	All right, let's move on with gaming weeks.
1177219	1179800	Also, anyone out there looking for a designer, hire me.
1180881	1182221	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1183128	1183669	It was good.
1183729	1184830	I didn't play a whole lot, though.
1185070	1190635	I played basically, well, two things, but one, whatever, anyways.
1191976	1193957	Red Dead Redemption, playing a lot of that.
1194157	1194918	Red Dead Tours?
1195318	1201844	Been playing mostly System Link multiplayer, because we were playing it at work.
1202524	1220101	and it's been pretty fun you can do little gang missions and stuff and join a posse and kill people and you get experience which unlocks more characters you can play as and more mounts and more weapons so that's all kind of fun
1220621	1222083	Thanks for watching!
1244543	1245204	So that sucked.
1245284	1246846	And then the Cougars are little fuckers.
1247287	1250892	They chase after you really fast and keep killing me.
1251953	1253275	Is Courtney Cox one of the Cougars?
1254577	1254897	Maybe.
1257160	1260264	I didn't name any of them, so I guess one of them could be Courtney Cox.
1261926	1263528	Thank you for watching!
1278368	1287395	And the major achievement that I was able to accomplish this week is that I figured out how to edit the map in Grand Theft Auto on the console.
1287455	1291037	Which, as far as I'm aware now, has never been done before.
1291297	1292979	So that's been pretty awesome.
1293699	1299904	And I ran into some roadblocks before with stuff being rotated weird, but I actually figured that all out last night.
1300604	1305768	So I'm ready to create all sorts of crazy stuff, including giant loop-de-loops and stuff like that.
1306388	1307029	Lots of ramps.
1308875	1337663	um but yeah back to Red Dead Redemption though that game is so glitchy it's just hilarious um I was playing today called my horse over and the horse came galloping at me at like full speed off a cliff to it's death bounced in front of me and then bounced off another cliff and it was just I'm like what the hell I've seen some angry tweets about I think I saw a tweet earlier this week that was like did anybody QA test this game
1338570	1339851	Well, there was some other ones.
1340011	1343273	Like, there was one of the missions that we were doing, the first posse mission that we did.
1344054	1345775	We were going after this one gang.
1345795	1348477	We had to destroy their ammo caches.
1348737	1353560	And so, after you destroy the second one, there's reinforcements that are sent after you.
1354020	1359444	Well, for whatever reason, they decided to spawn up on the hill, and they jumped to their death.
1360024	1362986	It was awesome, because I think the AI has problems with cliffs.
1363327	1365028	It just doesn't understand them sometimes.
1365408	1367209	And so, it was just like,
1369590	1370450	See people die.
1370491	1372411	It's like Toontz is the driving horse.
1372691	1373311	It's awesome.
1373411	1379933	And then there's been other videos I've seen that had problems where different objects are spawning on different characters.
1380033	1385214	So for example, instead of your mouth that's a donkey, you have a woman.
1385834	1389135	So you're riding around on a woman that sounds like a donkey and has a horse face.
1390825	1391946	I think I saw something like that
1412257	1414237	Like, you know, a real dog, like a coyote.
1414878	1418478	So it's this coyote running around carrying a rifle, which is pretty funny.
1418938	1423119	Oh, and there's a wonderful glitch where you can crouch against a wall and get shot up into space.
1423459	1424259	So should I buy it?
1424379	1425819	I've been hearing a lot of good things about it.
1425859	1428200	Like, there's great reviews and everything.
1428380	1429160	It's a lot of fun.
1429220	1430680	There's tons of people on there to play with.
1431280	1432421	Grand Theft Tour, Swap!
1432581	1439102	And if you don't want to play with those people, you can always start a private game and just mess around or go on missions.
1439122	1440682	Yeah, I don't like to play with strangers.
1441002	1445572	I'll play with people on my friends list and you guys What if the strangers want to play with you?
1445592	1445672	No!
1445693	1445933	No means no!
1452611	1459133	All right, kind of piggybacking on that and going into my gaming week, as part of this whole Oregon thing, you know they don't have sales tax in Oregon.
1459553	1463834	So I'm making a list of games I want to buy while I'm up in Oregon.
1464834	1466595	I'm going to buy that, I think.
1467335	1469215	That's kind of like on the bubble, so to speak.
1469536	1473537	But I definitely want to get Blur, I want to get Split Second, and I want to get – and now Alan Wake.
1473677	1474657	Oh, yeah, we have Split Second.
1475402	1476122	Is Ballistic and cool?
1476303	1476503	Yeah.
1476743	1477203	Dad loves it.
1477243	1477763	That's what I hear.
1478183	1479724	And Alan Wake I hear is pretty awesome.
1479744	1479864	It is.
1479884	1483025	Because somebody described it as like a Twin Peaks type video game.
1483646	1496391	And, like, I realize y'all were all big on, well, not you guys specifically, but just the general, like, if Twitter is any indication of where the world's at, everybody went nuck and futz over the Lost finale this weekend, which ironically was on Sunday night.
1496451	1501554	And, like, I think there was actually a tweet out there that said, you guys canceled the show to go watch the Lost finale, huh?
1501934	1502254	I'm like...
1502854	1503715	I don't watch Lost.
1504056	1505618	I watch good shows.
1506559	1507460	I'm not hating on Lost.
1507480	1510844	Look, any show that gets people talking as much as that show did is doing something right.
1511524	1516290	But I didn't watch the first few episodes and it's one of those shows where if you don't watch the first few episodes, you're fucked.
1516730	1517591	It's not going to make any sense.
1517972	1518873	So I never watched it.
1519306	1521688	If I can interject, back to Alan Wake.
1522268	1527531	Dan described it as... Oh great, what's that game?
1527551	1528892	Silent Hill meets Max Payne.
1528912	1529292	That's it.
1529753	1531354	Silent Hill meets Max Payne.
1531474	1531934	Interesting.
1532294	1532614	Sounds good.
1532674	1534916	Well, I was going to say, before Lost...
1535356	1538297	Way back when, in the 90s, there was a little show called Twin Peaks.
1538997	1539858	It was awesome.
1540238	1542979	And it was a total WTF mind trip as well.
1542999	1544339	It didn't last very long, sadly.
1544379	1546680	They really screwed with it on the time slots.
1546720	1551842	And they answered the show's biggest question, who killed Laura Palmer, way too soon.
1552382	1554283	And so that kind of killed the show when that happened.
1554743	1556764	But I say that because I love that show.
1556804	1560285	And if there's any video game that's even being remotely compared to that show, I'm all about it.
1560365	1561186	So I'll check it out.
1562366	1569169	Yeah, so I'm making this list and then my goal is to just go hit up a GameStop or Fry's or whatever they have up there and just go to town.
1569750	1571250	Or what's the big thing they have up there?
1573071	1573672	Fred Meyer.
1573972	1576933	Those ginormous stores that they have, I guess.
1577393	1578214	Go check out one of those.
1578914	1579454	So that's the plan.
1580175	1583897	As far as my actual gaming weekend games I've been playing, not a whole lot this week.
1583957	1586179	Of course, more WoW because I'm addicted to WoW.
1586519	1587680	But I want to say something on that in a minute.
1588600	1591802	Alan hit 80 this week, so I'm very happy and proud for him.
1592263	1596886	But now that he has hit 80, I think I'm going to, believe it or not, scale back on WoW a little bit.
1596966	1602129	And I am making it my summer goal before Labor Day to actually beat.
1602949	1604751	And this is a big deal for me.
1604991	1607873	I mean actually beat from start to finish.
1608613	1609293	Three games.
1610194	1614315	And I realize that might sound like nothing, but this is me we're talking about, okay?
1614416	1620158	Like, for me to actually complete a role-playing game or an adventure game or something like that is a BFD.
1620438	1622019	Because I have the worst gamer ADD.
1622059	1624120	I will start a game, play it for an hour, go somewhere else.
1624180	1624820	No, I have not.
1625000	1627161	Neither have I. I got to the end, I'm like, see?
1627221	1627781	See?
1628121	1628842	That's the problem.
1628902	1631823	Yeah, well, when one of you finishes it, you know you gotta let me borrow it.
1632003	1649138	so WoW will be scaled back I mean I'll still do the raids with the guild and play with Alan for at least like an hour you know several times a week and so forth but I want to actually beat three games and I don't mean like beating what's something like really easy that takes like five seconds to beat
1649338	1650619	Bayonetta Final Fight Final Fight
1667074	1669535	So I don't know what yet, but that's my goal before Labor Day.
1669555	1675497	And I need you guys as my gamer nerd buddies here in studio to hold me to it.
1675897	1678758	And if I'm lagging, I need verbal lashings.
1678778	1680639	Should we find games that we can play together, Rob?
1680659	1682439	You think you can do that, DarkSakura, verbal lashings?
1683079	1684020	I'll point at you and laugh.
1684240	1684880	Okay, that'll work.
1686667	1687408	I'm down for that.
1687888	1692111	I'm going to try Alan Wake and if I like it, that'll probably be one of the three.
1692291	1692911	But I'll let you know.
1693352	1694472	Because I might not like it, I don't know.
1694853	1697714	And I might say, no, I legitimately do not want to play this to completion.
1698255	1701057	But a game like Final Fantasy XIII really ought to be one of the three.
1701237	1702517	Well, beat it and then lend it to me.
1703738	1704359	Get his copy.
1705840	1707881	Whoever beats it first, let me borrow it.
1709102	1712003	I'll tell you right now, I want to play it on PS3.
1712023	1712344	I'm out.
1715450	1717852	Oh, I have a PS3 version, so I'll have to beat it and then let you borrow it.
1717912	1718652	Alright, alright, alright.
1718752	1720073	I'm gonna be... You beat it yet, Rob?
1720173	1720753	You beat it yet, Rob?
1720813	1721474	You beat it yet, Rob?
1721514	1721954	You beat it yet, Rob?
1721974	1722915	Okay, fair enough, fair enough.
1722995	1724236	Someone else needs to get me to Cydia.
1724396	1724636	Alright.
1725797	1733021	And then, other stuff in my gaming week, Game Room, I'm still playing the crap out of that, and River Raid came out today.
1733681	1736503	It's rare that we have the show mid-week where I can talk about releases as they happen.
1736823	1740205	River Raid was a classic, classic Atari 2600 game made by Activision.
1740606	1743547	My Activision room has like six Activision games in it right now.
1743587	1744148	It's crazy.
1744168	1744368	It's crazy.
1744668	1746709	I've literally bought like 10 games in Game Room.
1746769	1754733	I've spent, and if you say like $3 to $5 a game, most of them I only paid $3, $4, but there's a few that I also play on the PC, so I bought the upgrade.
1755713	1762877	That means I've spent like $35 on this game so far, which you might want to point and laugh at me, fine, haha, go ahead, but I'm getting my money's worth.
1762897	1765398	I'm playing the games quite a bit.
1765458	1767399	They are cheaper than virtual console games.
1767839	1768199	They are.
1768479	1769980	And I'm having fun with it.
1770281	1775464	You know, like Bobby and I have had these friendly little competitions on some games and you guys know Bradley, Arcadian.
1775884	1779246	Dude, did you know he was in the top 20 for Time Pilot earlier this week?
1779386	1779686	Really?
1779887	1781427	Yeah, he's pretty good at that stuff.
1781868	1787932	He wiped my score on Mega Maniac, but I'm still number one on Pitfall and Crystal Castles.
1787992	1788232	Woohoo!
1790013	1792896	I made it up to rank 68 in Grand Theft Auto.
1792916	1793316	Did you?
1794037	1795899	I thought you were 67 a couple weeks ago.
1796419	1797820	I keep losing the game here.
1798281	1804546	It sucks because it takes me like 20 games to get up a few ranks and all I have to do is lose to one person.
1804727	1809591	Not even lose the game, come in second by like a few bucks and it drops you down a bunch.
1810512	1811232	It's really unfair.
1811473	1813214	But I'm doing pretty good.
1813234	1814195	I haven't lost a game in a while.
1815396	1815616	All right.
1816217	1817438	Let's get to housekeeping tonight.
1818118	1820540	Of course, our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
1820560	1822502	We're going to get to the Twitter topics in a little bit.
1822942	1824584	And then also our Facebook.
1824624	1827266	Please add us there, facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
1827846	1829488	Apparently, we have a MySpace still, too.
1829588	1832510	But if I haven't added you to MySpace, don't be mean.
1833411	1835332	I check it like maybe once every three months.
1835612	1836413	So don't be sad.
1836693	1838995	I'll add you eventually if you actually send us a friend request there.
1839656	1840877	Although I ought to just delete it.
1841858	1844400	But any promotion is good promotion, I suppose.
1845120	1848142	Okay, so, how about gaming news?
1848283	1849483	We'll get into that a little bit.
1850524	1853366	Okay, there's, like, I don't know if you have anything you want to talk about, Jamie.
1853466	1854687	I know Loki's got a bunch.
1854747	1856909	He was a good guy earlier and went through the show.
1857209	1859251	There's like two things I want to talk about tonight, okay?
1859951	1864455	I'll start with the one that has been big today and I think yesterday was when the buzz started.
1864895	1866496	Let's talk Rock Band 3, alright?
1867217	1868058	So here's what happened.
1868658	1872339	The Green Day Rock Band demo came out on Xbox Live and PlayStation.
1872859	1876421	And, you know, it's got a couple songs you can play and check out what Green Day Rock Band's all about.
1876501	1883063	But the biggest splash of this was that there is a teaser page, I guess at the very end of the demo, that shows, you know how...
1883883	1885905	In Rock Band, you have little icons.
1885985	1891551	You have like a little guitar icon, a little bass icon, a little microphone for the singer, and little drums.
1891911	1892592	Well, guess what?
1893212	1897397	Next to all these icons in the number three is a little keyboard.
1897957	1902822	And it looks like, at first glance, they are going to add keyboards to Rock Band 3.
1903723	1907286	And when I first heard this news, I got really excited because...
1908007	1911389	You know, Orange Lounge Radio, we started as a music game based show.
1912110	1919495	And we used to play games like Drum Mania, Guitar Freaks, and some of the games that inspired, you could say, rock band in some ways.
1919855	1929181	Well, the one I always loved, that I thought was really underappreciated because they killed it off way too quick after only three versions, which I know sounds like a lot when you consider...
1930522	1934705	2DX is on like 18 or 19 is being tested right now.
1935185	1938447	And then Guitar Freaks is on like 16 or 17.
1939087	1940548	I mean, there's a crap ton of these games.
1940568	1941109	Yeah, I don't know.
1941169	1944310	Keyboard Mania, which I was actually good at.
1944451	1946192	I could beat the hardest song in the game.
1946212	1947012	I couldn't do it on doubles.
1947152	1948793	I guess that would really be the hardest mode in the game.
1949073	1949614	But I could beat...
1950675	1954700	We have a friend who was really good in doubles Better than me I had to pick it up so I could play with you
1967598	1972361	So I heard this news about Rock Band 3 and I was like, oh my god, they're actually going to do it?
1972541	1973742	They're going to put out a keyboard?
1973922	1976343	Oh my god, I'm like, woo, this is going to be great.
1976443	1978865	I don't know if all the songs are going to be great for this.
1979265	1980586	Woo, I'm all excited, right?
1981266	1987830	Well today, I guess a news story came out that says, well, it might not actually be a keyboard.
1988671	1990232	It might be a keytar.
1992697	1993718	FreesePopTheGame.com
2014301	2033062	or just any 80s band practically had that and I realize a lot of you think it's cool but boy did that feel like a punch in the stomach like oh we're gonna do this really cool thing and then we're gonna make it so stupid by making it a keytar ah whatever I'll play it anyway and it's one of those things where
2033562	2039907	I guess I could always just like put the guitar on the ground and do it that way and just pretend I don't see the stem.
2040228	2041008	But I don't know if that'll work.
2041028	2042690	I'm thinking it's just screen real estate.
2042730	2052938	I mean, because how the hell are you going to do keyboards with, you know, three other... How are you going to do a five-person band or even an eight-person band in... Well, let's see.
2052978	2059543	Three singers, guitar, bass, drums, and a keyboard.
2059803	2061945	So you'd have a band of like, you know...
2063246	2068367	I have a feeling, call it a gut, but if they do keytar, I think it'll scroll sideways.
2069168	2070188	I think that's how they'll do it.
2070228	2074329	They'll have vocals at top and keytar on the bottom, and then the normal tracks in the middle.
2074869	2077090	I just... I have nothing to base that off of.
2077590	2079090	Obviously, this is going to be at E3.
2079710	2080171	Obviously.
2080911	2084532	And we'll know more then, but until then, it's all speculation, really.
2084812	2089073	Except for the fact that, you know what, putting that little symbol of a keyboard in the game...
2089793	2090735	Mission accomplished.
2090755	2093159	People are talking rock band and, ah, what could this be?
2093259	2097626	And most importantly, something that Guitar Hero's not doing.
2098905	2104448	That was good of them to keep this a secret for a while because that way, now it's something to differentiate it from its biggest competitor, eh?
2105929	2109952	Pretty smart, but you know, we shall see when we shall see.
2110552	2119238	Apparently there's something else in this too about like, there's gonna be a mode that's super difficult, but it's just to emulate like actual guitar and drum playing or something?
2119418	2119678	Yeah.
2120218	2121519	Hmm, I'd heard something about that.
2122319	2123600	So that could be interesting.
2124181	2127763	What I would really most like to see is, um...
2130157	2138961	is them keep, especially for Rock Band, is them keep in the harmony, the three-part harmony that they had in Beatles Rock Band.
2139021	2139241	There.
2139281	2140121	I think they confirmed that.
2140201	2141942	Because it's in the icon, even.
2142082	2144343	And one of the dudes slipped up at PAX East.
2144583	2147585	I remember this happening because my friends were there at that panel.
2147605	2148105	You know, Seg.
2148405	2151927	He was there when the guy said, oh, well, Rock Band 3 has harmonies.
2151967	2152667	And then they were all like...
2152927	2154449	Shut up, you're not supposed to say that yet.
2154509	2155210	It doesn't matter.
2156471	2159935	It's confirmed because also it's in Green Day Rock Band.
2159975	2161617	Oh, because it's got the mic.
2161877	2163519	And it's got three mics.
2163759	2167503	I really, really hope all the songs are still backwards compatible.
2168204	2173370	I don't expect them to go back and add harmonies and guitar or whatever they do to all of them.
2174071	2177754	I would still be thrilled if I could have one massive library of songs
2191400	2198462	I still, I think it would be cool if they just went back and like maybe take the top 20 download songs.
2199022	2202624	Like take the, you know, because they know what 20 songs have sold more than any other.
2202984	2205424	Take like the top 20 and add support.
2206105	2210286	Or, you know, maybe not all of them would lend themselves very well to keytar or harmony.
2210606	2214527	So take, you know, the top 20 songs that would and just go back and touch those up.
2214607	2216408	That's going to be enough to get people excited.
2216508	2226317	They were saying that, you know, or people were speculating because now that you have the three-part harmonies and keyboard, Bohemian Rhapsody is almost like a given.
2227478	2228399	That is hot.
2229300	2229700	That is hot.
2229720	2232363	Just the fact that Queen could be in the game at all.
2232623	2233704	Well, actually, I think there's a few songs.
2233724	2234385	Yeah, there's a few songs.
2234405	2236246	But just Bohemian Rhapsody would be amazing.
2236346	2240090	I would really like to see at least some of the Beatles rock band stuff carry over, but
2240376	2259854	is the Van Halen Guitar Hero thing exclusive because you know if there's a guitar you know if keyboards are in this at all in any way shape or form it has to have jump it has to have do do do do do like how can you have one of those plastic keyboards sitting in your house and not want to play that
2263035	2263636	It's gonna be awesome.
2263676	2265237	I'm definitely gonna be picking this up.
2266098	2268220	One of the local stores here in Sacramento, Guitar Center.
2268541	2270042	Actually, I think that's a nationwide store.
2270322	2276669	They actually had a sign up at one of their stores by the keyboard display that says, The following songs are banned.
2276889	2279292	If you play this song, you will be kicked out of the store.
2280173	2283856	Chopsticks, Fur Elise, and Jump.
2286508	2288889	I'm surprised they don't have the Axel Foley theme.
2289069	2290550	No stairway, denied.
2290810	2292171	It's that whole scene, exactly.
2292651	2293232	But for real.
2294632	2294952	Anyhow.
2295533	2296613	So I'm excited.
2296653	2300956	I'm glad to see they're shaking it up beyond just making it prettier for Rock Band 3.
2300996	2302076	That's going to be pretty cool.
2302857	2305078	Another piece of plastic crap to have in my house.
2305518	2305918	I'm so excited.
2305938	2307279	I store my instruments at work.
2309163	2309904	in our game room.
2309924	2312266	I don't have room in my little apartment.
2312286	2313787	I already had a downsize from a house.
2314067	2315388	I have bullshit everywhere.
2315869	2318611	Another plastic instrument is the last fucking thing I need right now.
2319152	2327679	The thing I love and it's an awesome investment was my drum bag because I can keep my drums and all the other stuff in there except for the guitars.
2327699	2330161	The guitars are separate.
2330201	2333263	I have two guitars or a guitar and a bass.
2334204	2336506	I do need to get a new guitar though because it's crapping out.
2337226	2344769	Funny enough though, and speaking of quality, the Guitar Hero 2 guitar that I still have is fucking awesome.
2344849	2347190	It still works great.
2347270	2355113	The Guitar Hero 2 guitar I have works, and I did upgrade to a Guitar Hero 3 because a while back I was having enough friends over where we needed to have a bass.
2355133	2357134	So I just bought a Guitar Hero 3 guitar because they were really cheap.
2357174	2358095	And now it's wireless.
2358115	2358735	It works awesome.
2359415	2359995	They're fine.
2360895	2368177	Hopefully, now with Mad Catz working on the actual instruments, I'm hoping that they'd be a little bit better.
2368617	2372238	Actually, the bass, it's by Mad Catz and I loved it.
2372438	2374038	It's working really well.
2374498	2381240	Please tell me my logic makes sense that there will be a game plus keyboard only pack.
2381400	2384301	They're saying there's going to be all sorts of configurations.
2384381	2391125	If you have one thing, then you can get this, and they're going to do all sorts of different bundles, which will make it wonderfully confusing.
2391885	2392385	Then I'm happy.
2393426	2393666	All right.
2394566	2403650	The other big story I wanted to talk about is I want to talk about the armory for World of Warcraft is now available on the iPhone.
2404291	2406632	I'm sorry, not just the armory, but the auction house.
2407159	2409361	Oh, because I was going to say I had the armory when I was playing.
2409441	2409741	Sorry.
2409801	2412302	I mean, the auction house is now built into the armory.
2412362	2416485	It's a beta test thing going on that they just opened up to all realms a couple days ago.
2417086	2421709	And you can now manage basic auctions from your iPhone.
2422449	2426671	But it's a beta test because the plan is this is going to be a pay feature.
2427212	2430274	They're going to charge, I think they were saying three, four bucks a month.
2430294	2437798	I think it was three bucks a month for this feature after the beta test period is over, which you guess is going to be what, about four to six weeks.
2439673	2440954	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2463672	2464372	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2490228	2494230	But then, damn it, I found myself at work the other day.
2495070	2496171	On lunch, thank you very much.
2496731	2503454	And I like to get away from my desk at lunch because, you know, the last thing you want to do during your free time is be at your desk staring at your big pile of work to do.
2504054	2510457	So I was in a little break room during lunch, eating my lunch, and, you know, I'll kind of sit there and play on my phone, maybe look at a game and da-da-da.
2510977	2513618	Sure enough, I go on the armory and I start looking around.
2513638	2514799	Sigh.
2515879	2516479	Addict, Addict, Addict
2541113	2567534	anyhow but it's not it's not something extra that I can't already get in the game and therefore I don't see worth paying three dollars a month is really something I want to do I mean I guess there's people that are more into the economics that want to do this stuff and if they want to pay for it then so be it whatever it's a feature I just will not be one of them because I don't think I should have that on my phone to be honest I just don't think I should have that it's not a good thing to have
2569116	2573795	Now, thankfully, it's kind of... And I say it's kind of a double-edged sword because, you know, it's well...
2575559	2599365	I'm glad there's not any additional game features like something extra because then I'd feel a little bit jilted because I still held to what I said a couple weeks ago on this show the minute Blizzard starts selling epics for money I'm out I quit I'm I'm deleting my account well resigning whatever that day notice how I can't say I'll delete my account because it's too much work but I will resign my Warcraft membership that day it's done
2601378	2621546	I just can't justify that and I really hope that's not where they're going I'm a little worried did you notice how all this started I mean maybe it's just me maybe I'm a conspiracy theorist and what have you call me whatever names you want but is it just me or did all this nickel and dime stuff start happening once Activision bought them I don't think it's just you Rob
2622250	2644466	this all kind of like the sparkle pony the money for faction transfers and all these things and changing your genders and appearance and all this this all started happening when the Activision guys came in they swear up and down they're not going to sell epics for money I really really hope that's the case because it's like starting to push the boundaries a little bit you know what I mean
2645487	2648969	But whatever, if you want to pay the money and this is a good feature for you, have fun.
2649350	2652712	But I can't install Auctioneer on my phone, so whatever.
2654853	2655514	And that was really it.
2655914	2656955	Those are the two big stories.
2656995	2663799	I have some other little things I can get to, but Loki, I don't know what big news stories jumped out at you the past few days, if there's anything you want to jump in at.
2664620	2665261	Project $10
2680130	2686334	Project $10 is different ways that EA can make money off of you, basically.
2687055	2697942	The most recent way they've decided is that they're going to have one-time codes with their sports games starting off that allow you to play online.
2698683	2704667	If you buy the game used, you have to pay $10 to be able to play the game.
2704847	2705988	We talked about this last week.
2706248	2708469	I understand that, but I'm getting into more stuff about it, though.
2708489	2708849	Oh, dear.
2709049	2709549	Oh, God.
2709609	2709950	All right.
2710110	2710370	Okay.
2710390	2712431	Because I'm sitting here going, deja vu.
2712931	2713431	No, no, no.
2713571	2714332	Loki was here, right?
2714372	2716153	There's more stuff we're going to talk about here.
2716373	2717213	All right.
2717674	2718394	So, yeah.
2718734	2725417	Thankfully, they have the seven-day trial, and that's peachy and stuff for video rentals or game rental stores or whatever.
2725437	2726058	Well, that is cool.
2727398	2730059	That's cool, and they're the only ones doing that.
2730479	2743882	THQ, on the other hand, is now... They, by the way, weren't going to mention anything until the day of release for UFC, but UFC had leaked out, so unfortunately people found out about it.
2744182	2746242	They're doing something similar, except they're charging $5.
2747042	2748063	There is no trial.
2748383	2752063	So if you buy the game used, you ought to pay $5 in order to be able to play online.
2755024	2778396	then there was another one I found out about today another company which I'm just shocked that they're jumping on board with this but apparently Microsoft with Crackdown 2 will be jumping aboard this new trend and they will be having a one time fee wait wait wait wait wait why am I paying for Xbox Live?
2778777	2779077	why?
2780583	2788526	If every publisher is going to think, because you know now this is just the little leak in the dam and it's all going to come crumbling down after this.
2789046	2790147	Why am I paying for Xbox Live?
2790487	2794249	And another story that, sorry if you're going to get to this later, but I know this is big.
2794869	2802332	PlayStation Network is just, everybody's waiting for them to say something at E3 this year that there's going to be a PlayStation Network Plus or what have you.
2803400	2807787	Why am I paying for these services now if this is the new way I'm going to have to pay to play online?
2808067	2813435	Please do not tell me I need both Xbox Live and the code to play Crackdown because that seems ridiculous.
2813615	2814116	You do.
2814557	2815358	Oh my god.
2817304	2818926	Thanks for watching!
2839088	2842132	and there's like, you know, EA's excuses.
2842332	2848980	Oh, well, we're improving our online services and we're able to offer you more, you know, download content and stuff like that.
2849140	2852004	Yeah, more paid download content that I have to buy from you.
2853833	2856275	It's just awful.
2856676	2862702	To sit here and say I'm not going to pay for online play would be hypocritical because I pay $12 or $14, whatever it is.
2863162	2866025	I don't even know to play WoW.
2866425	2867006	That's fine.
2867386	2869488	I don't have a problem paying to play online.
2869629	2875875	I have a problem paying twice, and I have a problem paying all these different uncontrolled amounts now.
2876255	2903283	Which, okay, maybe is a little bit hypocritical because of the MMOs But generally you know an MMO is going to cost you between $10 and $15 But it's just, now there's no fucking control anywhere with this And it really bothers me I need to hear from Microsoft at E3 why I should renew my Xbox Live membership Because at this point, I'm not going to And I've been a member for like six years now And I'm hoping that there's some sort of misunderstanding But here's how it came about
2903883	2911310	We had a head of a company, might have been Blockbuster Chain or something like that, they were asking about Crackdown 2.
2912071	2918517	They're saying, well, the first Crackdown game was online only, and I just want to make sure there's a single player aspect to this one.
2918577	2926165	And of course, I was like, well, no, the first game actually wasn't online only, and there will be multiplayer and that kind of stuff.
2926445	2934251	I highly doubt that Microsoft would jump on board with what they're doing with EA and stuff because they're already making money off live.
2934792	2944139	Our buyer checked with Microsoft and they're like, that's correct, there's a single player and online and there will be a one-time code.
2944440	2946862	Wait, is this the internet or are you breaking news here?
2946882	2947582	Yeah, I'm breaking news.
2947942	2948443	Oh shit.
2951466	2953647	So casually too.
2953987	2954667	I know, right?
2954687	2957168	He didn't say secret club or nothing.
2957188	2959389	This is just out there.
2959569	2962671	I'm hoping that there's a misunderstanding.
2962711	2967593	Take with a grain of salt because we're not talking about hardcore game players with this.
2967973	2971935	We're talking about business people who might be oopsie-doopsie-ing the facts.
2972995	2979478	I'm hoping that the one-time code thing is similar to what we've seen with some of the other games like Alan Wake
2980158	2984501	and, you know, Gears of War 2 and stuff like that where the one-time code is download content.
2984641	2986582	It's free download content at launch.
2986982	2987483	Something like that.
2988343	2990004	I'm retracting my clause there.
2990024	2994907	I'm retracting my clause and hoping one of your coworkers is fucking up big time.
2994987	3005374	But if it isn't, then that's basically going to open floodgates because if Microsoft's doing it, then everybody's going to do it because they've basically been given permission to.
3006034	3006234	So...
3007575	3015041	I hope that's not the case, but once again, I blame a lot of these people that just don't stand up and complain about this stuff.
3015862	3022127	They're like, oh, that's no big deal because I'm getting the game used or whatever, and it's just a few extra dollars.
3022367	3023008	Well, you know what?
3023428	3024269	It's stuff like this.
3025069	3030714	You feel it's okay with different things, and now they're going to all start doing it, and pretty soon it's just going to be something else.
3030994	3033396	What else are they going to take out of their game that they're going to charge you $5 for?
3033416	3033636	You know...
3037211	3037993	It's just stupid.
3038213	3039676	And they're not lowering the price of the game by $5.
3039716	3040076	Of course not.
3044148	3044489	I don't know.
3044509	3047971	Yeah, I worry about the precedent this might set.
3048452	3052936	I understand why EA is doing this $10 thing, and I think we talked about this last week.
3052996	3054857	And, of course, other companies are going to follow.
3054937	3064065	But, you know, my two biggest issues are, A, it's not going to stop there, like Loki's saying, and, B, I don't want to have to pay for it twice.
3064565	3069650	They need to work it out where the one source – am I paying Microsoft or am I paying the publishers for this?
3069730	3070110	Right.
3070690	3080799	And it's absolutely bullshit that they're saying that, you know, oh, well, it's because we're like THQ's wonderful official statement about it.
3081059	3086384	THQ is delivering a truly unmatched online gaming experience for fans of UFC and across all.
3086724	3087585	Oh, shut up.
3087825	3088646	Bullshit!
3089347	3098516	The main enhancement of UFC Undisputed 2010's premium online content is the new Fight Camp mode in which players can assemble ranks up to 40 people and train together.
3098556	3110968	This significant value add to the game as players can continually improve their skills by training with friends and bringing teams from MMA specialists together.
3111568	3112289	You know what, though?
3112589	3115131	You could have done that and included that with the game as it is.
3115391	3118554	So now you're just basically making an excuse because EA's doing it.
3118774	3119674	Fuck you, EA.
3119995	3122557	You were on a good streak for a while there.
3122717	3125819	Activision was really making themselves look like shit.
3125879	3126940	They're all gonna do it.
3127260	3128421	But here you go.
3128501	3134006	Might as well... I'm sure Bobby Kotick's eyes are lighting up.
3134046	3135747	Hey, we can charge money for that?
3136928	3139370	Do you have the story up on PSN Plus, out of curiosity?
3139390	3139470	No.
3140610	3141331	Yeah, I do.
3141771	3142851	Can you talk about that a little bit?
3143451	3143671	Yes.
3143872	3156496	So people are basically saying that, in fact, actually the Sony Computer Entertainment Europe president has been alluding that they're going to be doing upcoming paid PlayStation Network subscriptions.
3157557	3160058	And, of course, they won't officially comment on it.
3160078	3163599	It says, will PlayStation Network become a paying service?
3164900	3174547	Kazurai stated a few months ago that we were looking at premium services alongside the current free service and that objective has not changed.
3174567	3176088	You'll learn more about it very soon.
3176468	3177929	So yes, they are doing that.
3178530	3182893	But if I'm hearing it right, they're saying we're not going to charge you to play games online.
3183453	3183913	That's right.
3185594	3189295	I'm just trying to think what could this possibly be besides Core.
3189635	3190175	You know what I mean?
3190776	3195157	I thought Core was kind of their plus thing with the demos and the little things that come with that.
3195557	3196818	Is that just an enhancement of that?
3197798	3208102	From what I remember, the rumors have been saying that it's supposed to have exclusive access to cross-game voice chat, which you can do for free in Microsoft's service.
3208822	3215989	Also, they're going to say that they're going to be including some sort of cloud-based saving system.
3217751	3225598	I was reading that they're also supposed to be, I think, offering the ability to purchase a full title of a game first.
3225979	3228461	Also, they'll be able to play the first hour of download games for
3228761	3230103	Yeah, that's interesting.
3230443	3231144	I'd heard that one.
3231164	3238151	Something about you can download the whole stinking game and play like every Blu-ray game will basically have a demo for an hour.
3238652	3239793	I don't even know how that works.
3240554	3242176	I don't know if that's wishful thinking or what.
3243017	3249864	I think I'd seen – and this is probably another rumor, fanboy wank or whatever, but I'd seen something about PlayStation 1 games are just going to be –
3251265	3251966	Play whatever you want.
3251986	3254327	They're going to have an open library for the PS1.
3254407	3257309	A rotating list of PSP minis and PlayStation 1 classics.
3257470	3259411	Exclusive in-game download content.
3259671	3262753	Discounts to the PlayStation Store.
3264494	3265055	Stuff like that.
3265859	3266199	Maybe.
3266719	3267040	Maybe.
3267220	3268840	I definitely want to hear more about it.
3268960	3273762	I mean, we need to separate the fanboy wank from the reality, but there's some interesting features in there.
3273782	3274963	I can tell you right now I wouldn't be paying for this.
3275083	3276644	I don't play on the PlayStation Network enough.
3277404	3288029	Well, now I'm paying for Xbox Live, and if, if, if, if, big if, capital I, capital F, if it is true that Crackdown is going to do the double dip thing...
3289549	3292752	and I don't hear from Microsoft what the hell I'm paying for anymore.
3292912	3294554	Are you buying Crackdown used?
3294634	3295294	That's the thing.
3295395	3298117	If you're buying it used, then yeah, it's double dipping.
3298277	3300719	If you're buying it new, you get the code, you can play the thing.
3301980	3304042	So, I don't know.
3304563	3306224	Still, why am I paying for Xbox Live?
3306705	3306965	You know?
3308081	3314745	It's still, it's really kind of a lame thing to be doing because they're like saying, oh, we deserve a portion of your use sales.
3315005	3317846	And fuck you, GameStop, for being okay with this shit.
3318186	3320948	I mean, you're the biggest fucking company out there.
3320968	3321828	You know they're not.
3321948	3322729	You know they're not.
3323289	3325110	They're just, they have no choice.
3327031	3332394	I'll get into more of that, why I think they're doing what they're doing and why they're so gung-ho about it anyway.
3332414	3333354	Please, I want to hear that next.
3334475	3336016	Okay, so fuck them.
3336056	3336856	Freeform tonight.
3336916	3337557	I get what I want.
3337597	3341339	Fuck them for being just okay about this.
3342780	3343440	Wait, wait, wait.
3343460	3344380	Shirley, you have an opinion.
3344761	3349883	What do you think about this whole PlayStation Network Plus and the crackdown rumor?
3349903	3350784	Do you have any thoughts?
3353442	3353903	Not yet.
3354063	3358207	Would you pay for a service where you could just go in and play any PlayStation 1 game you wanted?
3360350	3360830	Depends.
3360850	3361471	Yeah.
3361871	3362612	Depends on cost.
3362632	3368719	I mean, if it was any game, any at all ever, maybe.
3369800	3372563	But I don't need to because I have the vault.
3373104	3373304	True.
3374781	3379603	Okay, so fuck them for going along with this and basically saying, oh yeah, we think it's a great idea.
3379883	3381364	Yeah, you know why you think it's a great idea?
3381604	3390168	Because you're going to start selling download content soon, and you're cashing in on that, and basically Microsoft is saying, hey, you know what?
3390528	3393869	We're going to give you some backend rebates from this stuff.
3398908	3425964	I don't know they may be changing their tune too when you look at some of these games that you basically sell them for $30 they turn around and sell it for $55 and then they're going to charge me $10 on top of that to say for example buy multiplayer online I'm paying basically $5 more than the price of a new game so I'm going to be buying a new game obviously if I'm really interested in that
3427265	3428646	or I just won't play online.
3429627	3433910	Thankfully, a lot of the games, if I were to ever buy them used, I probably wouldn't be playing them online.
3433930	3435051	I don't play a lot of stuff online.
3435191	3438194	I don't know.
3438274	3439075	It's really awful.
3440669	3443151	Alright, get to the other thing about GameStop.
3443431	3444972	That's why I already went to that.
3444992	3446854	Because they're going to be selling download content.
3447094	3447274	Oh.
3448435	3448835	That was it.
3449916	3450396	Sorry.
3450717	3453278	No, I had heard that.
3453739	3456041	I had heard that rumor a little bit before, but it just...
3457201	3457682	I don't know.
3457702	3458082	It's weird.
3480242	3480983	All right, what else?
3481803	3483705	How about another story that maybe we'll do release dates?
3485587	3490931	Scratch the Ultimate DJ coming to iPhone, iPad, and the PC.
3492092	3500179	They're still working on, I guess, the console versions as well, according to Numark, but they are going to be out on those three platforms later this year.
3500559	3501680	It looks kind of weird, though.
3501720	3504443	I mean, I can't imagine playing this game on an iPad or something.
3504583	3505404	Very awkward.
3506084	3506705	They have like a...
3507145	3534459	turntables in the upper corners and then the five keys on the bottom and like a crossfader just above those keys little complex the PC version though will actually have a controller for it so that'll be interesting to see but apparently you know I guess it kind of sucks that the whole game was held up because of the whole lawsuit with Activision and stuff which we never really heard what happened with that if they settled or what
3536538	3539960	Whatever happened to the console release?
3540020	3542122	Is that still tied up in the lawsuit?
3542142	3545004	It says the console versions are still in development.
3545204	3548626	It says in addition the PC version will use a special controller.
3550247	3550647	Interesting.
3551368	3551548	Yeah.
3553009	3553309	Alright.
3554730	3555450	How about release dates?
3555470	3556531	Do you want to do some release dates?
3557692	3559333	That sounds like fun.
3559513	3561754	Do you have Europe ones, Jamie?
3561854	3562575	Why don't we start with you?
3562615	3564516	We haven't heard your lovely voice in a few minutes.
3568852	3569573	Yeah, go for it.
3569693	3569954	Why not?
3569974	3573258	Alright, well then, it's really just a few things.
3574660	3582291	On the, well, today, the 26th, Doom 2 for Xbox 360 and SingStar Kent...
3584294	3599185	on PlayStation 3, 28th Clash of the Titans, and Darkness Within 2, The Dark Lineage for PC, No More Heroes 2, Desperate Struggle, Project Runway, Poitouette One Way, or as I was saying, Pure Football, Alpha Protocol, Blur, UFC Undisputed 2010.
3599806	3601147	That's it.
3601167	3601367	Loki?
3601727	3601867	Loki?
3610490	3612891	Well, there's a few things coming out this week.
3613751	3617912	Witch is Witch from Natsume that's on the DS.
3619152	3623153	The Sims 3 Ambitions, the new expansion pack for the PC.
3624153	3631355	Mind Over Matter, another brain training puzzle game coming out on DS as well.
3632535	3636096	Backbreaker coming out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
3636136	3638156	That's one of those independent football games.

3643758	3649981	Pure Football on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.
3650801	3654782	America's Next Top Model on DS and on the Wii.
3655323	3656043	That's exciting.
3658484	3659804	Hope Crazy Tyra's in it.
3661805	3663387	Diamond Trust of London.
3663727	3665609	It's a strategy game on the DS.
3666690	3668151	That's nice, I guess.
3668872	3673256	Bass Pro Shops The Hunt, yet another deer hunting game.
3673716	3675698	That's on the Wii and Xbox 360.
3675778	3680963	And the Wii, of course, getting a gun bundle because those people that own Wiis love guns.
3683198	3704360	and um what else we have here Call of Duty The War Collections a re-release of three Call of Duty World War 2 games on Xbox 360 I believe 2, 3 and World at War uh let's see here Prince of Persia The Forgotten Sands on PC I guess it was a few weeks late and that's that's basically it alright
3706646	3709347	Oh, Siphon Filters, Logan Shadow on PlayStation 2.
3710048	3711729	Yes, they're still making PlayStation 2 games.
3712069	3715632	Yes, there's still ports of PSP games, right?
3715692	3716152	PSP, yeah.
3717193	3719194	Going to Japan, these releases are for June 3rd.
3719214	3724097	We're not going to be live again until June 6th, and I didn't see a lot for May, so let's go to June 3rd releases for Japan, okay?
3724438	3729761	Some price reductions on Gears of War 2 on the 360, Gundam Musou 2, and Tales of Vesperia.
3729901	3732183	Again, these are June 3rd releases I'm doing today.
3732944	3743354	Uh, going to the PlayStation 3, also some more price reductions, Gundam Musou 2 and Katamari Damacy Tribute, which I believe is, uh, Katamari, what did they call it, Forever here?
3744955	3745236	Uh, yeah.
3745376	3754285	Uh, nothing really notable on the Wii, this is kind of a dry period over there, I don't know if there's, you know, just not the season, but it's mostly price reductions going on in Japan right now.
3755106	3771604	Same thing when you look at the PS2, Gundam Musou 2, Mobile Suit Gundam games going on sale, Nintendo DS, another Pachinko game comes out, Kaiden Restaurant Ura Menu 100 Sen, don't know if that's like 100 different things on the menu or what, but that is coming out on the DS, and then on the PSP, 100 Sen.
3774628	3776470	Is that the 100 classic books thing?
3777690	3778251	From Nintendo?
3778431	3780473	No, because it's Kaidan Restaurant.
3781313	3782814	I don't think that's it.
3783595	3785437	No, there's like a little happy ghost on the cover.
3785477	3789920	It's a horror buffet with chilling, blood-curdling, and creepy stories as dishes.
3790000	3790661	Oh, maybe it is.
3790681	3791982	100 tales for you to order.
3792362	3793583	Choose the one that suits your mood.
3793943	3795705	Vampires, ghosts, and psychopath killers.
3795785	3799027	These characters fill the cartridge, and all you have to do is order them to come out.
3799067	3799948	That sounds creepy.
3801129	3802810	It's like Silent Hill, but you read it.
3804752	3821412	and then lastly on the PSP Bleach, Heat the Soul 6 gets a price reduction and probably the only new game I'm seeing on this whole list Fairy Tail, Portable Guild is coming out this week from Konami on June 3rd, next week there you go, Japanese releases, there you have it
3822665	3823226	Facebook and Zynga
3842694	3843674	Farmville people.
3845075	3846175	They kissed and made up.
3847175	3848956	They had make up sex and everything's better.
3848976	3856118	Remember how Zynga was threatening to leave and we're going to take Farmville to our own damn website and I said it'll never work.
3856559	3857379	It'll never work.
3857935	3859196	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3883254	3888336	Yahoo already has a gaming portal that a lot of the PopCap stuff and all that's on.
3889916	3890616	What were the games?
3890636	3892037	I actually used to play some games on there.
3892057	3895898	There's like a Scrabble type game on there and the freaking whiteboard game.
3896078	3900240	It was like Pictionary and everybody drew dirty fucking pictures in that game.
3900740	3904281	I can't remember the name of it, but I even played some of those games before.
3905805	3906446	Whatever.
3906706	3907588	It's not Facebook.
3907788	3916941	If you can't collect the things and post them to your wall so you can prove that you have the biggest e-peen farm, that you're farming all the e-peen in the land, then...
3918631	3925255	The part where I banged my head against the wall was when I saw the FarmVille cards for sale at like 7-Eleven.
3925555	3927216	There was like little $10 FarmVille cards.
3927256	3928197	I was like, oh my god.
3928217	3929618	Did you see the FarmVille ice cream?
3930498	3931579	Oh god, yeah.
3931619	3932839	I heard something about that.
3932919	3936421	Like there's FarmVille ice cream and FarmVille Slurpees.
3936722	3938162	Oh god.
3939603	3940704	No, do not want...
3943100	3947561	I thought this was an interesting story, too, that had to do with Epic and a comment they made this past week about piracy.
3947581	3950402	And they basically said that six years ago, Epic was a PC company.
3969366	3972328	But because of piracy, they went to consoles.
3973108	3976090	We did one PS2 launch title and everything else was PC.
3976130	3978591	And now people are saying, why do you hate the PC?
3978631	3980052	You're a console only company.
3980432	3982874	It's because the money's on consoles.
3983294	3985515	That's from President Mike Capps.
3986216	3987356	We still do PC.
3987416	3988517	We still love the PC.
3988577	3990438	But we already saw the impact of piracy.
3990778	3995261	It killed a lot of great independent developers and completely changed our business model.
3997765	3998066	Steam, Piracy,
4010345	4011325	Any thoughts on that, Loki?
4011645	4017927	Not that I'm insinuating that you're a pirate or anything, but I know you usually have strong feelings about these type of topics.
4018647	4026809	There's piracy on any platform, regardless of PC, Xbox 360, handhelds, other consoles.
4026889	4032711	I mean, it's just it's easier to do on PC, so I guess that's true, but...
4034191	4039614	They're facing piracy everywhere, so, I mean, is that really an excuse?
4040055	4040375	I don't know.
4040535	4044937	I think it's because they can charge more for their games, but whatever.
4045658	4045878	Good.
4046378	4046858	Good for you.
4046939	4050421	You're a console developer now.
4051121	4052942	Do you want me to pat you on the back or something?
4053642	4053883	Really?
4055624	4055884	All right.
4056484	4058625	One other story, and then I'll let Loki take over for a little bit.
4059126	4061567	BlizzCon tickets on sale today.
4061767	4063828	June 2nd and June 5th.
4064548	4065208	$150 if you want to go.
4065708	4067109	And the con is in October.
4067229	4068689	October 22nd and 23rd.
4069190	4070370	You know what, DarkSakura?
4070670	4075552	I think you and I should go down to Anaheim on October 22nd and 23rd and go to Disneyland.
4076897	4079940	Fuck BlizzCon Let's do it 150 bucks?
4079980	4104240	No thank you The 22nd and 23rd, October Let's do it Except I'll be going to Alabama right after No, I'll be going to Alabama in November I haven't done Disney with Jamie in a while I've done Disney with other people, not Jamie It's been a little while We need to make it so Here's my thing You might be thinking, what the hell Rob You're like the biggest wow addict on that show And why are you all hating on BlizzCon A, they won 150 bucks
4105865	4107607	B, what am I getting?
4108247	4110449	Cataclysm ought to be out by then.
4110689	4113812	I mean, and if it's not, damn, they're moving slow.
4113872	4114413	When is it again?
4114773	4116114	October 22nd and 23rd.
4116334	4122840	Well, they did release the last expansion, I want to say, or there was one of expansions that was released in November, so it might not be out.
4122880	4125562	Yeah, but Burning Crusade was out in, like, January, so it...
4126383	4128686	Well, then that's both after October.
4128926	4130768	It's World of Warcraft.
4131068	4133591	Blizzard can release it whenever the fuck they want.
4133651	4138596	They could release it on Christmas Eve and the nerds would be out in force to get there and be the first.
4139136	4139737	It doesn't matter.
4139937	4140418	It's Blizzard.
4140518	4141279	They can do what they want.
4141319	4141679	But this...
4143820	4144861	Look, I understand.
4145081	4146901	They gotta recoup their costs.
4147001	4148501	They do some big stuff for this.
4148621	4149022	Whatever.
4149062	4150482	It's a pretty big effing deal.
4151042	4155463	But I don't... Am I gonna get to be the first to play their new MMO?
4155503	4160124	Which is the rumor that they have a type of action-ish MMO that's in the works.
4160144	4163745	I think the last rumor I heard was a spy, espionage-y type of game.
4164305	4165105	Might be their next MMO.
4165125	4166066	So, the agency?
4167646	4168046	I don't know.
4168226	4168566	I don't know.
4169166	4169466	Rumor.
4169666	4170947	Huge fan-wank rumor.
4171007	4171587	Don't quote me.
4172687	4175909	and I imagine Diablo 3 is going to be playable but $150?
4177029	4180591	I'd rather ride Space Mountain three times in a row.
4180651	4180931	What?
4182291	4186773	Dude, I'd just rather ride Space Mountain period instead of like almost anything.
4187974	4188114	Yep.
4189365	4192626	Maybe we'll walk out front of the convention center.
4192666	4197108	When we get bored, we'll go walk over to the convention center.
4197148	4202289	I don't know how we're going to get bored at Disneyland, but let's just hypothesize that every ride we want to go on is broken.
4202610	4209572	We'll go walk outside the convention center and look at the people and go, So, how's it going?
4210638	4215681	Hey y'all, we're going to go on the Matterhorn.
4216402	4217563	Have fun waiting in line.
4217583	4221325	You might be able to get in as a press.
4221505	4229911	Is it bad to say that again I would just... The convention center, let me put this in perspective if you've never been to Anaheim.
4230251	4233794	The convention center is literally two blocks from Disneyland.
4234254	4235274	You can walk there.
4235435	4236355	It's not that bad.
4236375	4240298	With all the walking you do at Disneyland in a day, I don't get why you'd drive anyway.
4241299	4256418	you can especially California Ventures like right there it's the first park you hit moving that direction it's kind of sad I know that you could literally walk to Disneyland and if I'm going to be that close I've got to go maybe I should be doing a Disney podcast I don't know
4259071	4283034	I might feel a little more excited if I knew what games I was going to get to see but StarCraft 2 is out in July so maybe one of the future expansions but I'm not a StarCraft person anyway I'm assuming it's all about Diablo 3 and I guess Cataclysm if it's still not out but it's got to be in beta by that point so people are already playing it maybe they'll announce another Warcraft expansion
4283855	4285115	I mean, I don't know.
4285435	4286856	I could go off on a tangent about this.
4286896	4293898	Maybe this isn't the right forum, but I kind of think Cataclysm is less of an expansion.
4294038	4294718	I mean, don't get me wrong.
4294838	4295978	I'm very excited for Cataclysm.
4296398	4298079	It sounds like an exciting expansion.
4298719	4302480	But I think this is the closest you're going to get to WoW 2.0.
4303940	4307321	Like, they're literally going back and upgrading the old game.
4307721	4309982	And they're using the Cataclysm as the retcon to do it.
4311781	4321723	So it's kind of like you're getting a little less of an upgrade with all this new stuff as you're just getting your old stuff enhanced to be competitive with newer releases.
4321803	4322523	Does that make sense?
4323264	4323484	Yeah.
4323724	4328445	So I wouldn't be surprised at all if another expansion comes pretty quickly afterwards.
4328505	4332326	The actual expansion where you go out to a new area and all this stuff.
4332986	4336327	And the additional five levels you didn't see in this first expansion.
4337067	4337627	But that's just...
4340507	4342447	Are they raising the level cap again?
4343008	4344368	To 85, but not to 90.
4345309	4347090	Which is, you know, fine, whatever.
4347930	4353512	But it just kind of makes me think that they already have another expansion planned that will take it to 90.
4354433	4356094	I ultimately think WoW will stop at 100.
4356554	4359775	Level 100 seems to be a nice, even, round number, but we'll see.
4361716	4365778	Again, fanboy wank, nothing more Loki, what do you got for us?
4368100	4383708	Apparently, Edge is reporting that Project Natal will be out for $150 And October 26th, give or take a few weeks Didn't they say $100?
4383748	4385329	Oh no, that was a PlayStation move
4387168	4392769	I... I don't think... I would hope that they're smart enough not to put it out for that price.
4393609	4394849	That's how much a Wii costs, isn't it?
4395970	4411112	Yeah, and they're also, you know, basically the Xbox... Well, we know that a slim Xbox is coming out, so perhaps they're going to be bundling with that, and they're saying that they're going to be bundling with the new Xbox 360 for $300.
4411152	4411212	Um...
4415593	4415953	I don't know.
4416013	4417073	It seems awfully high.
4418474	4425075	I know the technology is probably great and all, but they've got to have learned something from Sony.
4425115	4429537	If you put it out at that kind of price point, no one's going to pick it up.
4430377	4435218	You've got a few people picking it up, but no one's going to really jump on board with it because I can get a Wii for that price.
4436710	4442814	But if there's some kick-my-ass-amazing-blow-my-hair-back game, I might pay it.
4444055	4446057	A system is only as good as the games that are on it, right?
4446097	4453002	And the advantage, though, of this over the PlayStation Move is that you have to buy this, and you're done.
4453622	4458225	There's no additional controllers yet to buy because you're basically the controller.
4458325	4460987	Do you think maybe that's their leverage?
4461007	4466010	They're going to come out and say, yes, it's $150, but maybe they're going to do a price comparison.
4466030	4473495	They'll say, if you want to buy the Wii for the whole family to play, that actually costs you $150 plus $40 plus $40 plus $40.
4475456	4475936	Right?
4475976	4482298	It's 40 plus, actually, because you're going to need nunchucks probably, so 40 plus 20, so $60.
4482879	4483759	A lot.
4484419	4485880	Another $180 on top of that.
4485920	4486760	All right, so a lot.
4487220	4488761	But they're going to say, that's going to be their leverage.
4488781	4500565	They're going to come out and say, but to buy the Xbox 360 Natal for the whole family, $300, and it plays DVDs, and it does Netflix out of the box, and da-da-da-da-da-da-da, all this stuff.
4502853	4504199	I can see it.
4505182	4507933	Again, if they have the game to justify it,
4510507	4520174	I think it needs to be sub $100, but that's just me I would say they should put it out for $99.99 You know what they should do?
4522616	4525217	Here's how they would sell a million copies You ready?
4526018	4533944	No joke, you guys are going to hate me for this All the people listening are going to cringe But I'll tell you what, they would sell a million copies of this You ready?
4535145	4546562	The Biggest Loser Video Game The Whole Family Can Play Project Natal So it's like a competitor to Wii Fit based off that TV show.
4547763	4549566	It would sell like crazy.
4550787	4552768	Number one, they put it out on the Wii.
4553209	4557611	It was already pretty successful because it came out last October and it sold pretty well.
4559112	4563874	It's already out and it was okay, but it's not a system seller.
4564455	4569717	And yeah, I understand there's going to be all those kind of party games and fitness games and stuff like that.
4571338	4578022	It's going to suck because there's going to be a ton of these crappy games coming up, but that doesn't really affect me too much because you don't have to buy them, obviously.
4580203	4582244	It's just really how much is the hardware going to cost.
4582364	4585006	That's really the thing I'm interested to find out.
4585706	4587567	But I'll find out in a few weeks.
4587887	4589188	I'm sure they're going to say a price point.
4589788	4590789	They better say a price point.
4591629	4595251	E3 is kind of the time you lay it all out on the table for the holidays.
4595392	4595972	I would expect...
4596989	4626456	well here's the other thing you may not get specific dates but you're gonna get I think you'll get prices and you're gonna get a pretty good understanding of what that blow your hair back game is that they're putting behind whether it be Fable 3 the Milo thing and I said that a long time ago it's gonna be Gears 3 I did remember I said why because they were hiding that game for the longest time you know Gears is a pretty successful franchise and they just recently announced Gears 3 and I think it's gotten a ton of support
4627003	4646249	Here's the other thing I'm thinking, though, is that one of the, I guess, conspiracy theories about it was that they were saying that they originally were rumoring that it was going to be like 50 bucks for the game, for the actual thing, and that now they're putting out this rumor that it's going to be $150 so they can come back and put it out for $99.
4647029	4654272	So those people that are hoping that it was $50 aren't as disappointed, whereas the people that thought it was going to be $150 are like, hey, now it's only $99.
4654792	4655392	That's awesome.
4657182	4657483	I don't know.
4657844	4664840	If they do come out with Natal support for Gears of War 3 at E3, I want to be called from here on out Games Analyst Rob Roberts.
4665602	4666283	Games Analyst.
4667654	4670775	If I'm wrong, then I'm just some dickhead with a podcast, which is what I've always been.
4670835	4671115	Nothing new.
4671135	4672495	It could be Robert Patcher.
4673495	4674536	Stupid Michael Patcher.
4674816	4677656	I want to go on record saying Michael Patcher's a fucking douchebag.
4677676	4681957	And the reason why, because he just throws out guesses, and yet people come... That's what we do!
4682938	4689659	I understand that, but people fucking run... It's like if he comes out on his balcony to the gaming press... He's like the Pope.
4689919	4690700	He's like the Pope.
4691820	4692400	Pretty much.
4692420	4695881	He walks out, gives his declaration, and then...
4698503	4702326	I think this holiday season, game consoles will do well!
4702586	4704808	And everybody reports it like, Oh my god, oh my god, he said something!
4704849	4705209	Oh my god!
4705649	4706550	Game consoles do well!
4706730	4707591	Michael Patrick says so!
4707891	4708752	Oh my god!
4709012	4711475	You know, and it's like... Women fainting.
4712175	4720163	I just don't understand why people have... This is why, other than complaining about him, I will never mention any analysts.
4720323	4722345	I don't give a shit what an analyst thinks.
4723576	4724157	Who cares?
4724277	4725738	If that's your job, great.
4726578	4730021	I don't go asking meteorologists what the weather's going to be like.
4730981	4732342	Because they're not always right.
4732603	4740928	Would it be wrong for us to put, like in the description of our podcast, three games analysts conquer the video game news every week?
4741009	4744571	I mean, you don't really have to have a degree to call yourself an analyst, do you?
4744611	4746232	You just have to analyze the market.
4746252	4747953	Well, we've been doing that for eight years.
4749415	4751116	That's on-the-job experience, right?
4751136	4751296	Yeah.
4753108	4755290	DarkSakura, you know this legal stuff better than I do.
4755670	4757011	Can I call myself a games analyst?
4757251	4758452	Call yourself whatever you want.
4758512	4758793	Yeah.
4759393	4759633	Okay.
4760534	4760954	There you go.
4761755	4766799	Orange Lounge Radio brought to you by three expert games analysts every week.
4767379	4770121	You've been analyzing the industry for eight years.
4770461	4774144	I will go as far as saying I'm the most expert analyst of them all.
4774785	4775725	That's my opinion.
4775865	4777827	I am the most expert analyst ever.
4778427	4781730	We are the most smartest games analysts out there.
4784338	4785499	The most expertest.
4786099	4787680	I'm the smarterest of them all.
4791583	4794985	Another news story, please, before our egos inflate anymore.
4795005	4796046	Wait, wait, wait.
4796286	4798207	Michael Patcher's coming out on the balcony again.
4798227	4799228	Oh, my God.
4799548	4800188	Wait, wait, wait.
4800208	4800729	What's he saying?
4801749	4803671	Madden 11 will sell a lot.
4806492	4807493	Oh, my God.
4807613	4808253	All right, enough of that.
4808273	4809234	It's the holy word.
4809714	4812296	God's awful.
4812316	4813757	Oh, my God.
4815242	4816282	I just don't understand them.
4816442	4817623	Hate me because it's true.
4817643	4819003	Hate me because it's true.
4820124	4821604	Mama, what have you done now?
4822264	4822865	That's right.
4823525	4824625	Babysitting Mama.
4825065	4829747	Including your very own plush baby which you shove a remote down its throat in order to play.
4831999	4832800	I kid you not.
4832840	4833140	Really?
4833841	4834641	Yes, really.
4835242	4835762	That's right.
4836002	4842787	It uses a plush baby in which you have tucked a Wii remote inside, also using the nunchuck that is somehow hanging out of the plush baby.
4842807	4843548	Don't kick the baby.
4843928	4856277	You play 40 mini games in the usual Cookie Mama style, representing feeding, changing the baby, rocking it to sleep, and six different virtual babies, each with their unique personalities.
4857117	4860460	So if the baby shits everywhere, then don't worry, Mama will fix it.
4863524	4864064	I don't know.
4864384	4865345	Oh, you wanted a girl.
4865425	4870047	Don't worry, Mama will fix it.
4870387	4872628	Don't worry, Dr90210 will fix it.
4872888	4873568	I don't know.
4873868	4874428	It's weird.
4874849	4876589	They did have a game come out like this.
4878690	4880571	I think it's called My Baby.
4880591	4881671	There was a story.
4881731	4882392	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4882432	4884493	It was on an Australian blog or something.
4884533	4885933	It was a Twitter topic one week.
4885993	4886453	I remember that.
4886473	4889094	Yeah, with the baby holster on the baby doll.
4889555	4890215	Oh, my gosh.
4891135	4892716	and it's also like that Wiwa thing.
4892736	4893396	Remember the doll?
4893476	4894617	Yeah, I remember Wiwa.
4894657	4895657	Did the Wiwa ever come out?
4895998	4896378	Not yet.
4898019	4898439	Interesting.
4899119	4901800	But that's going to be weird that you have to have a baby doll.
4903241	4906043	Not a damn person listening to this show is ever going to play that game.
4908525	4911568	DarkSakura is the biggest fan of Cooking Mama, I know.
4911908	4914030	DarkSakura, babysitting mama, yes or no?
4914050	4914611	I have a great idea.
4914931	4915211	No.
4915612	4916092	There you go.
4916112	4917554	No, no, no, I have the greatest idea.
4917654	4918815	Slip the baby!
4919356	4920257	High heat!
4920757	4925502	She's a games analyst, Loki, and she says it's just not interesting.
4947683	4952085	No, the best babysitting mama baby analog you could create.
4952165	4955346	So, I mean, because basically the Wii Remote has to go into something.
4955406	4965489	It doesn't necessarily have to be this doll, unless the doll is actually going to have a cord or something that's coming out of it that you can plug into your Wii Remote and actually going to be its own controller.
4965529	4974712	But assuming that's not, it's just going to be some stuff thing, we should have people take other stuff things or create your own baby out of whatever you have lying around your house.
4975652	4976393	And that might be funny.
4977333	4988412	and take pictures playing the game with it that's the game that we need to have instead of Cookie Mom or whatever we need to have this one
5001653	5002754	Y'all knew that joke was coming.
5002814	5003094	Come on.
5004075	5004495	You knew it.
5004555	5004935	You knew it.
5004975	5005556	Don't sigh.
5006136	5006977	Don't sigh at me.
5007457	5008558	It's a groan, Rob.
5008618	5009799	It's a groan because I knew.
5009819	5011040	I got a quickie story.
5011060	5013081	It's something you might hear at E3, or you might not.
5013202	5013542	I don't know.
5013942	5021828	But apparently there are rumors going around, rumors abounding that Final Fantasy XIII Versus may actually release on the Xbox 360.
5022328	5024530	Apparently that's something Squeenix is looking into.
5024550	5026111	Because they sold tons of copies of XIII.
5026131	5029774	Yeah, because Final Fantasy XIII did pretty well, so where the money is, they will follow.
5030594	5053787	The answer will be at E3 Just dropping that little tidbit out there Also one other little tidbit I wanted to drop Just because I thought this was cool Top Gun apparently is coming to PlayStation Network Not the movie It's an actual PlayStation 3 game And it'll be out on Mac and PC as well It's going to be an air combat game My hope is it's pretty much the 8-bit game But with better graphics and new stuff Right?
5053988	5054828	That's what we want, right?
5055048	5059911	I had Top Gun on the NES That was a badass game Good times Hmm
5060154	5065396	Loki, maybe one or two other stories, then we'll get to the, like, we need to do the tweets and the mailbag and all that other fun stuff.
5066356	5071438	GameStop, remember they were talking about throwing around the idea of some sort of new rewards program?
5071998	5078681	Well, now it's being beta launched, I guess, their Power Up Rewards program, and there's two different things.
5078701	5080181	You can get a card for free.
5080521	5084143	Wait, first off, is this something that they will try to force on me with every purchase?
5085163	5086204	It's basically the same thing.
5087144	5089145	You'll see it's not very different than what they're offering right now.
5089306	5090106	Oh, okay.
5090546	5100932	So they have a card that you can get for free that you don't really do anything for, or a card that's the platinum card, I guess, for $14.99.
5101412	5104874	Now, here's what you get with the different cards.
5105035	5112359	The standard black card, for each dollar that you spend on new games and consoles, you get 10 points.
5113480	5136381	points that you earn on pre-owned games you earn 20 points for your trades you get 20 points 20 points per dollar there's different birthday bonuses exclusive member offers and you get entered in each time you buy something to the epic rewards giveaway and then online activation
5137822	5154736	I guess 250 points and if you establish a game library with them you get 250 points now with the platinum card you get basically all that plus you in the epic rewards giveaway thing you get two entries
5157459	5161941	If you upgrade to the pro tier, you get an extra 250 points.
5162441	5168045	You get a one-time buy-to-get-one-free offer for pre-owned games.
5168425	5179651	You get 10% bonuses on points for your purchases, 10% on pre-owned purchase discount, I guess, and 10% trade bonus.
5180532	5182713	And, of course, 12 issues of Game Informer.
5182813	5204799	So basically, you get the same shit that you get now, except there's this point system that you can trade in for different things, including, like, I guess you can get, you know, gift cards, free controllers, but the prices on them were just absolutely ridiculous.
5206860	5210341	Like, you have to basically spend $4,000 to get a... Oh my god.
5210421	5210941	Well, the way...
5212302	5235392	and the sad thing is the extra $5 I have to pay online to play it online now it will not count towards this yeah basically it says the rewards range from coupons for $5 to $10 off purchases and that ranges from 4,000 to 8,000 points you can even get a free Xbox 360 controller or Eternal Beach X11 headset for 40,000 points 40,000 points course would equal about $4,000 spent on new games
5240214	5241155	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5257952	5265237	But hey, I mean, if you're really dead set on spending your money at GameStop anyways, you might as well get the card because at least you're earning some points towards something.
5265617	5267819	But, I mean, I don't know.
5268099	5271662	Just like I had this thing at Petco where I, like, buy cat food and stuff.
5271982	5277726	I'm supposed to, like, buy ten bags of cat food and I get one free, but it's within a certain time limit and that never happens.
5277746	5281348	And you might as well because you're buying cat food at... No, it never happens.
5281368	5283570	It never happens because they don't go through that much cat food.
5283590	5284110	You don't have enough cats.
5284130	5284530	You need more cats.
5284550	5285651	I'd have to have, like, tons of cats, yeah.
5285671	5286452	You need more cats.
5286472	5286732	Yeah.
5287192	5289333	Alright, how about a quick story, then we'll go to Twitter.
5290514	5300598	Alright, UFC Undisputed 2010 just was released yesterday, and unlockable is Shaq.
5301178	5308522	That's right, you can play a little Shaq-fu with Shaquille O'Neal, and there's actually an easy code to do that.
5309622	5321206	On the Xbox 360, at the main menu, you would hit down, up, left, down, down, left, up, down, down, left, X, Y, Y, X, and then start.
5321826	5330909	On PlayStation 3, it would be down, up, left, down, down, left, up, down, down, left, square, triangle, triangle, square, start.
5331910	5333310	So there you go.
5333590	5335951	There's your pro tip for the day.
5338162	5338662	Right.
5339343	5342804	Because I know everybody's just running out to put that code in right now.
5344104	5345365	Let's do some Twitter topics, huh?
5346705	5349486	We may not have a chat room tonight, but we still have all you kids on Twitter.
5349786	5352947	The nice thing about doing this midweek is we kind of get some different people.
5352967	5354188	We catch different people.
5354208	5358609	Because a lot of folks that don't listen to us live don't because they have other things going on Sunday night.
5358629	5360850	But it looks like we've got a little bit of a different crowd tonight.
5363131	5363371	Let's see.
5364671	5370693	Rockman Rock sends us a tweet that says, You thought the movie The Human Centipede was a bad idea?
5371153	5373574	Just wait until you play the game.
5374335	5374935	That's right.
5375215	5387479	There's a Human Centipede game that I got linked to here at Newgrounds that I could play, but I don't know if I want to because the Human Centipede is fucking gross.
5387639	5388740	Yeah, but it's a centipede.
5390061	5391022	Let me just do this.
5391122	5391882	I need to see this.
5391942	5392603	You are a doctor.
5392623	5393884	Wait, let me make this full screen here.
5393984	5394965	Wait, let me turn off the Twitter music.
5394985	5396126	We already heard the Twitter music tonight.
5396146	5397067	Shut up, Santa.
5397448	5398088	All right, let's see.
5398429	5401952	You are Dr. Heider, a brilliant German surgeon who's gone mad and surgically attached people.
5402412	5404294	Ask to mouth to create the human centipede.
5404835	5406056	Your parents are not pleased.
5406096	5411000	You must take your trusty rifle and put down these human centipedes like the bad dogs they are.
5411041	5411301	Whatever.
5412978	5418600	Oh, look, there's some little people with their mouths on their butts, and they're worth ten points, and it looks like... Oh, that's not very gross.
5418981	5419921	It's just digital.
5419941	5422562	It's like little, uh... Let's see, we can do mouse controls.
5422622	5424403	Mouths to move, and left click to fire.
5425063	5426724	Oh, this is just Centipede.
5426744	5431086	Ha, but the Centipede... I get it.
5431826	5433427	It's the human Centipede.
5436568	5438209	This sounds alright.
5438269	5440050	This is totally a hacked version of it.
5440250	5441351	Oh, there's a police officer.
5441511	5442552	Oh, and I just shot him to bits.
5442632	5442972	Woohoo!
5446194	5447635	Yay, I beat the first stage.
5448415	5449956	They change colors really stupidly.
5450737	5452358	Yeah, that's a little dumb.
5453358	5453939	Thanks, anyway.
5453959	5454799	A little dumb.
5454819	5458021	Uh, let's see.
5458181	5460683	Blade 3, or Blade III.
5461543	5463424	How about... It says Blade E!
5463504	5464005	Blade E!
5465615	5470740	How about new Facebook privacy finally fixes games, annoying achievements being posted everywhere.
5470760	5471340	Did you hear about this?
5471380	5474423	Facebook's been in the news a lot, and I guess they came out today.
5474683	5480568	Well, they came out a couple days ago, and I love the Facebook CEO, because he's such a bro.
5481769	5486272	He looks like that total douchebag frat guy.
5486332	5489634	He's running this multi-billion dollar company.
5490975	5496158	He came out a couple days ago and literally said the corporate equivalent of... Oh yeah, my bad.
5497398	5498399	My bad on that one, guys.
5498439	5498899	Sorry, guys.
5499540	5499880	My bad.
5501840	5502540	I forgot the keg.
5502881	5503221	My bad.
5504302	5505762	That's pretty much what happened a couple days ago.
5506043	5514468	Well, they came out today and talked about that basically they're going to have to dumb down the privacy because too many people are getting information used that they don't want to be used.
5515068	5522273	The biggest problem is that Facebook sets a lot of things to public by default without really giving you enough warning.
5522833	5525675	That's the biggest problem I always had with it, but it sounds like they're getting rid of that.
5525695	5528737	They're going to make it really easy to block applications, which includes...
5529477	5546971	games so if you want to just block all the fucking Facebook apps and all the games one click done how about that DarkSakura you won't have to read any of that crap ever again sweet at least that's what it's sounding like we'll see I guess we won't really know until later tonight when it's implemented maybe it's on there now I don't know
5548412	5552837	Let's see, SpongeTwang wants to tell us that he is going to a medium-sized anime con.
5552877	5553838	Not a big one, not a small one.
5553858	5557442	It's a medium-sized anime con in Boise, Idaho.
5558043	5559224	Anime Oasis.
5560245	5562307	Are there Oasis's in Boise?
5562407	5562688	I don't know.
5563288	5563749	Oasis?
5564029	5564610	Oasis?
5564870	5565310	Oasis.
5565470	5565911	Oasis.
5566311	5567453	Are they in Boise?
5567873	5568614	Boise Oasis?
5570859	5573121	Anyways, check out the game room.
5573141	5575262	Sponge20 is going to check out the game room at Anime Oasis 2010.
5576023	5577024	Yes, please, let us know.
5578064	5581507	We like the anime cons, but we like the gaming room reports, especially.
5583528	5585510	Popo Inger.
5586949	5587529	I know this guy.
5587549	5589710	This is my buddy Jer on Facebook.
5589730	5591090	He's probably on Facebook too, but LiveJournal.
5591510	5594731	Popo and Jer says, or it's Pop on Jer.
5594851	5596132	I like Popo and Jer better.
5596772	5597812	Although it might be Pop on Jer.
5598232	5602174	Says, Rob's giggle sounds like the Riddler from the old Batman series.
5602274	5602794	Just saying.
5604548	5605529	DarkSakura.com
5625077	5625618	Screw this.
5625638	5626679	No, no, no, no, no, no.
5626699	5627179	That's right.
5627519	5628680	That was when Batman was awesome.
5629301	5634946	GGBeat wants us to talk about how Jet Set Radio should go to Xbox Live Arcade.
5635046	5635967	It would be awesome.
5636728	5637088	I agree.
5637128	5638449	It should go to Xbox Live Arcade.
5638489	5639130	It would be awesome.
5639350	5641812	There should just be a new Jet Set game, period.
5641912	5644074	I thought it was coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
5644895	5647937	Was that something that was spoiled on the partner net or whatever?
5647977	5650059	I think it was one of the ones spoiled on the partner net.
5650119	5650719	I can't remember.
5651500	5655102	There is a lot of Dreamcast stuff coming to Xbox Live Arcade at some point.
5655282	5659385	GGB, you need to cross your fingers, cross your toes, hold your breath, and hope for a miracle at E3.
5659425	5661446	Yeah, they'll probably show it at E3.
5661927	5662927	Maybe that'll be the game.
5662947	5667631	You know how sometimes at E3 there's a game that they go, and it's out right now?
5668411	5669632	Wasn't that Doom a couple years ago?
5670072	5672134	They came out and said, Doom will be available tonight.
5672754	5673034	Right?
5674176	5674937	Ironically, Doom 2.
5675017	5684068	Maybe, maybe, GGB, say a prayer, light a candle, whatever, a satanic chant, whatever it is you want to do.
5684108	5688914	I would guess Sonic Adventure over that, because that's actually leaked out already.
5689335	5690036	Oh, you never know.
5691465	5719374	MNZiba wants us to talk about this game Rhizome that is going open source pretty interesting when an MMO goes open source ooh this is cute I've never seen this I don't know if that's the same game or if that's the website but there's this cute little background with like a little raccoon with a hard hat on and it's a cute little character well whatever anyhow Winchgate who is developing and publishing Rhizome they have announced that the science fantasy MMO Rhizome it's open source
5720294	5722315	That's kind of neat, an MMO going open source.
5722835	5724635	Can you install Linux on the MMO?
5725635	5726215	Probably.
5726876	5733957	You can now use the Rhizome Core Toolkit to make mods or enhancements to the existing code and even develop your own virtual world.
5734017	5734977	Wow, that's pretty crazy.
5736278	5737298	Who knows what might come of that?
5737318	5738138	Well, thanks for the heads up.
5738178	5741719	If we have any programmers that want to make the OLR MMO, go for it.
5743120	5749466	The Sague wants us to mention, how about the Supreme Court hearings in October about the California video games law?
5749847	5751108	Oh yeah, that's going to be a big deal.
5751909	5758155	Whatever happens because of that, I mean, it will be, you know, the Supreme Court's supposed to be the end of the line, the highest court in the land.
5758615	5760217	Hopefully we'll be the last we hear on it.
5761077	5764100	I just feel like I just don't know enough about the law.
5764901	5770007	I might be a games analyst, but I don't really know enough to really say what's going to happen with this.
5770347	5771769	Of course I want it to be struck down.
5771809	5773631	Of course I think the whole thing is a little silly.
5775353	5777816	But I have no legal basis to say it will or it won't.
5778877	5779818	Do you guys have any thoughts?
5779938	5781159	The California video games law?
5781239	5786225	The California law will make it illegal to sell the game, right?
5787788	5790290	I don't remember the specifics about it.
5790330	5792791	I'd have to look that up real quick.
5792871	5795854	What's the problem with doing a freeform show?
5795874	5797174	You haven't really researched your topics.
5798876	5804760	I think we're going to see... I really don't see that it would fly.
5807421	5809763	I mean, haven't they tried before?
5810242	5810662	Let's see.
5811483	5818970	The California law imposes restrictions on and a labeling requirement with respect to the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
5819390	5822773	Several other states have passed similar laws and others may well be watching the case.
5823174	5825456	The stakes extend beyond California.
5825636	5829680	I remember this now because the verbiage in the law was very vague.
5830200	5830961	I remember this.
5831061	5834404	It didn't really state how a game was... It was very...
5837404	5846220	gray area type of thing on what constituted a violent game and hopefully that's going to be the same thing that does the law in but we'll see I don't know
5848587	5849327	We'll see what happens.
5850628	5852648	Butch Kawa says, might be a late one.
5852708	5853809	No, you got in just in the wire.
5854089	5857290	But the topic of heavy rain rights might go to a movie deal.
5857370	5859470	Trivializing the game or just trying to cash in?
5859830	5860891	Heavy rain movie.
5861351	5862851	Also, I'll piggyback on this.
5862911	5867613	I wanted to say I read this week a Mass Effect movie was sold to Legendary Pictures too.
5868053	5868633	What do you think?
5868753	5870574	These games are pretty epic to begin with.
5870614	5871574	I mean, they're a little different.
5872174	5874896	Matt's effect would be kind of hard to condense down in the movie.
5874936	5878758	Heavy Rain I could see it because it pretty much played out like a movie, so why not?
5879099	5880580	As long as the Jason scene's in it.
5881400	5882161	Jason!
5882681	5883201	Jason!
5883341	5884022	Jason!
5884042	5884662	Jason!
5886023	5889205	Did you see the Press X Jason music video today?
5889245	5890126	I did, actually.
5890686	5891387	That was awesome.
5891807	5892267	Good stuff.
5893828	5896250	As long as they have the Jason scene in it, Bochikawa, I'm cool.
5897932	5902434	But of course, I don't necessarily think it's trivializing the game.
5902534	5903854	It's trying to cash in.
5904274	5908796	They realize that the game is done pretty well and will have a built-in audience to go see it.
5909056	5911477	And they can probably make the movie relatively cheap.
5911577	5918840	Speaking of which, I'm kind of curious to see how Prince of Persia does because we might actually have a mainstream video game movie that does well.
5918940	5920140	With no Persians in it.
5920260	5920840	Imagine that.
5921061	5921401	I know.
5923042	5923762	It's so whitewashed.
5923782	5929228	I think I saw something on Yahoo where the headline was Prince of Persia called offensive.
5930449	5931631	They're talking the movie, not the game.
5932071	5940360	But it had to do, it was a story about that and the movie they can't call Avatar, The Last Airbender, because they're all whitewashed.
5942216	5946539	Well, if they can't find Persian actors that are, you know, good enough for those parts.
5947060	5951684	I think that's a little silly, but, I mean, Jake Gyllenhaal, of course, is an A-list actor.
5952224	5956407	There's going to be lots of people, maybe myself included, that will want to see the movie.
5956527	5963733	Don't mind me while I sound really racist here, but, you know, who would they get to play, like, these Persian roles?
5963773	5968016	Would they have, like, Cal Penn or something, you know, playing the major, you know, lead in this?
5968036	5968537	Yeah.
5969997	5974159	I think you only need one or two A-list actors.
5975560	5982802	To take a step back, I think that kind of says something about our society in general where you've only got one or two guys to pick from.
5982882	5984283	Was Aladdin Persian?
5984623	5987524	I don't remember him being very Persian in the cartoon.
5988245	5989125	He was pretty white.
5990980	5995424	I think that says something about a much larger problem of society.
5996304	5997105	What, the Disney one?
5997325	5997645	Yeah.
5998266	6000388	He looked Middle Eastern.
6001208	6002269	Let me say this.
6002649	6004931	There's an Aladdin stage show at California.
6005652	6007573	Now you are making me do a Disney podcast.
6007653	6007913	Yay.
6008214	6010696	There's an Aladdin stage show at California Adventure.
6011336	6015860	And the last time I saw it, the Jafar they had playing it was a black guy.
6016440	6017341	Thanks for watching!
6029329	6029769	Thanks for watching!
6051110	6053192	Also, can I just say this real quick?
6053812	6059956	They had a girl in the ensemble in a wheelchair, a power wheelchair in the ensemble.
6060516	6066781	And she was actually pretty fierce, I gotta say, because they were kind of smart with how they integrated her into all the dance numbers and everything.
6067501	6091492	during a whole new world where the ensemble will come out and they're carrying famous buildings and so forth I shit you not she had pyramids tied to the back of her wheelchair and she'd kind of ride along with everybody else and she's singing and she fits right in it was it was great to see you know why I like to see that because there's a lot of handicapped kids that go to Disneyland and for them to be able to see that that if they want to do that they can I think that's great personally
6095604	6098525	Boy, we're getting into... These topics are too deep.
6098965	6100125	We need dick and fart jokes.
6100206	6100426	Help.
6101306	6102026	We're done with Twitter.
6102086	6102706	Twitter.com.
6102726	6102986	I burped.
6103006	6103526	Did that help?
6104007	6105647	Yeah.
6106547	6114710	Well, there's a game coming out called Warriors of Alasia, and it's basically bikini-clad women fighting each other, Mortal Kombat style.
6116050	6120011	And they have a lot of bikini-clad women that are promoting it as well.
6121935	6122135	Boobs!
6122196	6123797	Did a lot of the artwork for My Sims
6139515	6141637	And draws chicks with big boobs.
6141837	6142338	She does.
6142358	6144239	Very, very big boobs.
6144320	6147583	She does, and she has a comic that she works on.
6148223	6149505	Her name is Genevieve, by the way.
6150065	6152468	She works on, and I believe her...
6155350	6158451	I'm trying to remember who her other artist is that she works with.
6158772	6159872	I want to say his name is Robert.
6159992	6160312	I don't know.
6160612	6161913	Forgive me if I got that wrong.
6162353	6165454	Anyways, they have a comic that they work on called Islands in the Sky.
6165514	6171296	And it's basically this big boob chick that goes around stealing people's food in these different islands in the sky.
6171316	6172937	And putting them in her boobs, apparently.
6173037	6173537	Pretty much.
6173857	6181480	But as kind of an exclusive thing at Fanime, they're going to be selling... And I don't know how the hell they got these made, but it's just awesome.
6181701	6182501	They're going to be selling...
6183121	6189945	Boob Mouse Pads and they have one that's semi-tame but still she's got big boobs.
6190125	6194047	Then they have one that's just all out topless but you can actually purchase those.
6194127	6194927	Nasty and perverse.
6194947	6197769	She'll be on Artist Row, I believe, booth 301.
6198049	6204352	So if unrealistically proportioned women is your thing, then Islands in the Sky is for you.
6204372	6204692	Exactly.
6204732	6205853	So say hi to Genevieve.
6206293	6207034	She's awesome.
6207054	6208154	Tell them OLR sent you.
6208294	6208554	Yes.
6208654	6209355	You know,
6210355	6210716	Great artists.
6210736	6211817	And recommended the boobies.
6213338	6213718	That's right.
6214458	6215519	Not much has changed.
6216840	6217621	No, but she's cool.
6217681	6218021	Huge monster.
6218101	6219642	These boobs were endorsed by Loki.
6219942	6220143	Yes.
6222250	6225371	How about, um, I don't know, do we want to do, like, Mailbag?
6225411	6226532	Do we have Mailbag ready to go?
6226552	6227893	Do we have some emails we can read tonight?
6228273	6230674	I... I didn't pull up Mailbag.
6230874	6234115	Can we... Well, let's, uh... A quick story if you want to pull up Mailbag.
6234135	6235696	Yeah, pull up Mailbag while we do another quick story.
6235956	6239198	So, that game Super Mario Crossover was pretty awesome.
6239218	6241359	The flash game where you can play Super Mario Bros.
6241399	6242459	with a bunch of different characters.
6242819	6248482	Well, one of the characters that they talked about adding in there that they never really got a chance to do that was Ryu Hayabasa.
6249222	6254427	or Hayabusa and they have now added him in there or at least they're going to very soon.
6254867	6262133	They have a video teasing it and he has of course his wall climb moves and he throws ninja stars and what not so that's awesome.
6262934	6264636	Can't wait to play that version of it.
6264876	6268139	And that's that game you really love to play that has like the Contra characters.
6268219	6268919	Oh yeah.
6268959	6269460	Good times.
6269580	6270060	Sweet.
6270240	6270701	Good times.
6271121	6274823	Alright, DarkSakura is prepared to dive into the mailbag headfirst.
6274883	6277844	Our mailbag, of course, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
6278684	6284087	And she's going to dive in headfirst and pick out an email to read, or two, or three, or fifteen, depending on how many people.
6284127	6284347	Three.
6284947	6285687	Email this this week.
6285747	6286728	DarkSakura, go to it.
6286768	6289249	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you would like to participate.
6289289	6289609	Please do.
6290458	6291458	Hey guys, Sterlach here.
6291738	6295120	I've tried calling about this a couple of times but I've been unable to get through.
6295520	6302062	I was surprised that Loki actually brought the closure of Nintendo PowerLine up as I've known this for a while.
6302682	6305043	I wanted to clarify what the PowerLine actually is.
6305183	6309164	It's a line you can call to get walkthroughs and tips for games instead of talking to live individuals.
6309604	6316467	The walkthroughs are automated with a menu interface which makes it quite easy to find the specific information you're looking for on a particular game.
6316987	6319768	I have very fond memories of running up my parents' phone bill back in the day.
6320368	6324111	Although this is only a regular long distance call, not even a 900 number.
6324571	6330775	The thing I always liked about the power line is that they will frequently have music from the games in question in the background over the person giving the information.
6332216	6336279	By the way, I do want to point out that that may be how it is around these days.
6336679	6339421	When I was in high school, you talked to a person.
6340747	6361885	Go watch The Wizard, there's actually a scene where they call the game counselor, it's pretty epic I just sat and jawed with some guy one day about weird Zelda stuff and prototype games one time because I was bored I get what he's saying though, he's telling us that it's different because I think we were reminiscing about that on last week's show and he's trying to tell us it's a little bit different now than it was then
6362646	6367208	Since I have a lot of memories of this line, I've actually been working to record every last game from it I can.
6367848	6372650	I know I'm probably the only person on the faceless planet who actually gives a fuck about this, but it's something I'm passionate about.
6373210	6376391	I see it as part of my childhood in a way, and I don't want to see it go away entirely.
6376851	6384514	It's a neat little artifact of the 90s, and if nothing else, I'm sorry, if nothing else, sorry for the rambling nature of this message, but this is something I feel quite strongly about.
6384674	6391557	You might actually be able to petition Nintendo to actually put out like DVDs of their Ivor or something.
6391577	6391757	If you've
6391817	6392897	I feel strongly about it.
6392937	6393658	Go for it.
6394798	6396719	I think that's actually kind of cool if he's recording stuff.
6397179	6402961	I don't even know if you have this ability at all, but if you've been recording it and you can make MP3s of it, send us one.
6402981	6403962	I'll play one on the show.
6403982	6405122	I think it'll be kind of fun to listen to.
6405302	6406463	Send us one that you think is really cool.
6407023	6410524	This one is from Doug or Dragon Boy.
6411164	6412405	Hi, Doug Dragon Boy.
6412856	6439366	I was wondering if any of you are playing any PS1 games on your PSPs I have 23 PS1 games now on my he wrote no, it's supposed to be now on my PSP Go and I love playing them as many PS1 games are far better than PSP games that are available Keep up the great work on the podcast I'm a loyal listener and your podcast is without a doubt my favorite Dragon Boy Aw, thank you PS1 games on the PSP?
6440446	6441967	Do they ever do Jumping Flash?
6442458	6442918	Yes, they did.
6443579	6444980	Did get Jumping Flash if you don't have it.
6445440	6446961	Um Jamalami is a great music game.
6446981	6447481	A lot of fun.
6447501	6448502	Um Jamalami.
6448582	6450523	And, of course, that's one I play, personally.
6450923	6451484	Suikoden.
6452104	6454505	I have the original, and I've played that on the PSP before.
6454545	6454826	That's fun.
6454886	6455586	And Final Fantasy VII.
6455966	6456166	Yeah.
6456426	6457347	You might as well go.
6457587	6457967	You know what?
6458308	6459849	All the fanboy wank is there for a reason.
6459869	6460969	Final Fantasy VII is pretty good.
6461349	6464131	Not the best Final Fantasy game they ever made, but pretty darn good.
6464952	6467233	Okay, this last one from RubbaBuh.
6469014	6470516	Maybe iPad Nano?
6470656	6476022	I only suggested that on the last OLR episode because the leaked iPhone images are designed to match the iPad.
6486594	6490837	If it played iPad apps, it would be a way around the contract with AT&T.
6490958	6497142	The iPad itself seems like it would qualify as a non-phone since it has no phone capability.
6497343	6499024	Well, isn't that what the iPod Touch is for?
6500685	6504448	I'm pretty sure the AT&T network is used for the iPad for access to the App Store.
6504908	6507971	By the way, I have an iPad and a netbook, and the iPad is just better.
6508251	6511854	Let's keep an eye out for an Apple-branded phone for Verizon, you know.
6514213	6515014	I still want an iPad.
6515054	6515774	I love my netbook, though.
6515794	6517755	Now the rumor is Apple's going to team up with Sprint.
6519196	6519776	Let's hope not.
6520557	6521377	Well, that's done.
6521697	6523478	Alright, if you really want to do that.
6525339	6525639	Alright.
6525859	6526920	Well, thanks for the emails, guys.
6526980	6530282	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us some more.
6531222	6532143	A couple more news stories?
6532643	6533223	Do we have any more?
6533424	6533804	We done?
6534244	6537786	We still have the Classic Game of the Week, and we'll get to that in a minute, but any more news stories for us, Loki?
6537806	6538746	Uh...
6540573	6565639	not really don't have anything I got one I'll do a couple quick ones I have a couple here that I can do and then classic game of the week we'll close up shop Dragon Quest 9 Sentinels of the Starry Skies July 11th finally here in the US translated and ready for US consumption 4.2 million sold in Japan and it's finally making its way over here Dragon Quest 9 Sentinels of the Starry Skies on the Nintendo DS
6565916	6567437	That's too bad I knew about that weeks ago.
6567737	6569157	Well, I should have mentioned something.
6569198	6570798	I always see this stuff.
6570838	6572599	I'm like, damn you, Loki.
6572919	6573299	That's all right.
6573800	6574880	It's like not news for me.
6574900	6578802	The crackdown thing's really interesting, but again, I hope they're really wrong.
6579822	6580863	I really do hope they're wrong.
6581663	6581884	Outro
6598836	6600657	The 1600 point card was the best selling accessory.
6600757	6603317	I'm surprised live subscriptions aren't and you know why?
6603397	6615080	Because if you've ever tried to buy a live subscription with a credit card on their service, you're stuck in this stupid auto renewing shit and it sucks.
6616360	6618041	Getting out of it is near impossible.
6618601	6627083	So I tell you man, if you really are limited on money, spend the time to go out and buy one of those memberships because it's
6628583	6635988	It's a lot better to buy it at a store and have it, you know, dumped down to silver again than having it auto-bring you all the time and you can't get rid of it.
6637589	6637989	It's awful.
6639891	6640171	All right.
6641211	6643133	Let's go to the classic game of the week.
6643453	6644774	You ready for this, DarkSakura?
6645534	6646075	May as well be.
6646275	6646575	All right.
6646695	6650157	Every week on the program... Wait, where's my... Oh, my gosh.
6650177	6652098	You know it's freeform tonight because everything's broken.
6652139	6653780	I don't have the... I don't have the song.
6654220	6654860	Where's the song?
6655361	6655661	There it is.
6657543	6658224	Classic Game of the Week.
6658284	6660825	Every week, DarkSakura goes into the vault and picks out a classic game.
6660845	6664468	She says, hey, you kids, get off my lawn.
6664508	6665449	Hey, listen.
6665869	6667170	And go play this game.
6668031	6670572	A classic game that we all grew up on.
6671453	6671773	I don't know.
6671793	6673455	What constitutes a classic game?
6674375	6674856	It's old.
6675296	6675596	All right.
6675816	6678118	What is this week's Classic Game of the Week, DarkSakura?
6678458	6679159	Keeper Mania.
6680114	6681815	Don't cry, true loneliness stars
6711896	6714618	It's not terrible.
6714658	6714998	It's a B-.
6715138	6722681	And it's not... It's not an easy song to play.
6722761	6723081	No.
6723581	6725142	Especially since this person's doing doubles.
6725182	6727903	Let's go to the real song here, and then DarkSakura can tell us a little bit about the game.
6727923	6731305	Which, by the way, this is one of my favorite songs totally in this game.
6734186	6736427	But actually, I really like it better in pop music, but anyway...
6737612	6740453	So, um, Keyboard Mania is one of the Bimani games.
6740633	6744015	It has two, um, 24-key keyboards.
6745235	6751418	And, um, the different notes that come down correspond to a different key on the keyboard.
6752398	6759521	Um, and, um, also there's this, you know how Beatmania had the BM98 simulator?
6760561	6764523	Um, there's one called Do-Re-Mi for a Keyboard Mania simulator for him.
6764583	6765083	I get it.
6765243	6766884	Do, a deer, a female deer.
6768506	6775952	Anyway, so we got out Keyboard Mania, then Keyboard Heaven, which is the Korean version of Keyboard Mania.
6776713	6780676	And then Keyboard Mania 2nd Mix, and Keyboard Mania 3rd Mix.
6781777	6792106	3rd Mix actually linked to Drum Mania 4th, Guitar Freaks 5th, and Drum Mania 5th, Guitar Freaks 6th, for certain songs.
6792146	6793067	Because we used to have...
6793547	6795108	Epic Days at Roseville Golf Land.
6795288	6797048	One of the few arcades anywhere that had that.
6797068	6798249	There's pictures of all of us.
6798429	6798949	Amazing.
6799009	6799469	Playing.
6800410	6801690	Like Jamie would do drums.
6801750	6802911	I would always do drums.
6803411	6805832	And like Bradley would do guitar.
6805892	6807552	I don't know if Loki was playing with us then.
6807752	6809493	I probably was playing guitar with the other side of the keyboard.
6809533	6810173	Good times.
6810834	6811974	You'd always pick keyboard.
6812054	6813295	Can I play one of my favorite songs?
6813315	6813595	Go for it.
6813615	6814315	From Keyboard Mania.
6815055	6817196	This kind of sounds like a song that was in like As long as it's not Henry Henry.
6817336	6817756	No, it's not.
6817776	6819897	This is like a song that would be like an act raise or something.
6820717	6822098	This is Cue No Tame No Sonata.
6822118	6822198	Yeah.
6826846	6829749	This sounds like the overworld music in Actraiser to me.
6829849	6830350	I think it is.
6830450	6834154	Like, remember when you were managing your people?
6834174	6837238	This is one of my favorite songs in Keyboard Mania.
6838720	6841183	We'll play a little bit of this, then I'll do the Castlevania song.
6841924	6845107	Yeah, the Akumajo medley.
6846817	6854463	Anyway, there's actually three songs, though, that were big carryover songs into other Bimani games.
6855524	6862710	That was Frozen Ray, Pink Rose, which we played earlier, and The Least Hundred Seconds, which we should actually play that too, Rob.
6864150	6865170	I love Frozen Ray though.
6866391	6869912	But Keyboard Mania had two home versions.
6869952	6874313	There was Keyboard Mania and then Keyboard Mania 2 which was the second and third mix.
6876614	6880795	And it had basically the arcade style controller.
6881255	6890621	I don't see any other way that you could have had the full arcade-style controller like they brought out for 2DX and DDR and all that.
6891261	6900267	Except with the other way is that if you had the Windows PC version, you'd get a Yamaha EZ250i keyboard to play it.
6901488	6902249	Which one do you got there?
6902689	6902869	Oh, yeah.
6919153	6920533	Someone's butchering it a little bit.
6920553	6921254	They're doing pretty good.
6921274	6928176	This is about as good as I would do, probably.
6928616	6934758	And I love how, on the interface, when it has the little background music screen up there from the arcade.
6935758	6937879	The wheel thing always weirded me out, though.
6937899	6938919	Like, what the hell was that?
6938939	6939599	It's your scratch.
6939799	6940619	Yeah, but it was a little dumb.
6940639	6941420	It was a little dumb.
6943263	6949246	And it felt kind of, I'm kind of glad that hopefully if we get this keyboard thing in Rock Band, it probably won't have that.
6950007	6953909	But, I mean, really, there's not much else to say about it other than what I've said, you know.
6954630	6961714	It was fairly short-lived for the Bimani series, and, you know, it's sad that it didn't do better.
6961854	6964055	You know, it was really difficult, though.
6970953	6976197	This is one of the few songs, because when you did that multi-session, there was probably like six songs you could play.
6976518	6978039	This is one of them, at least 100 seconds.
6978900	6980120	I love this game.
6980141	6981261	This was my favorite Bomani game.
6981281	6982002	There were about 12.
6982422	6982743	Oh, okay.
6983683	6986726	Because you could also do, I think there was also a version of Ride on Time.
6988652	6989433	I'm pretty sure there was.
6990275	6990856	Good stuff.
7003545	7007329	I don't remember though, and I want to say it didn't have it.
7007769	7012895	Because keep in mind, I've got Drum Mania 4th, Guitar Freaks 5th for home.
7013676	7014637	And Keyboard Mania.
7015638	7018602	And I don't think it had Super Session Mode for the 3rd.
7019182	7020723	No, not on the home version.
7021303	7027506	So, which made me very sad because I was all like, yeah, Super Session, and no.
7027747	7031128	The 2-3 mix came out way later, too.
7031188	7035010	Like, the first one was out, and people just were pretty convinced that others were never coming out.
7035030	7037792	I think I had the first one, and then I borrowed yours for the longest time.
7037812	7040833	Because, I mean, we basically, I think for a while, had Communal Bimani.
7041094	7041694	Yeah, pretty much.
7042034	7042675	Good times Yeah
7059349	7061070	Did you find me a Frozen Ray, Rob?
7061310	7062211	You want Frozen Ray?
7062271	7063192	I'd like a Frozen Ray.
7063472	7066374	We'll close out with a little bit of Frozen Ray here for the classic game of the week.
7067455	7068655	And let's see.
7069916	7070257	Here we go.
7071217	7072318	Here's from the PS2.
7074480	7076041	Somebody's selecting on the mini list.
7076201	7076541	There we go.
7076781	7077662	Good job.
7090363	7097946	What I really liked about this game is that if you could memorize the note patterns, you could play the song on a real piano.
7098606	7100367	It was the one Bamani game.
7101087	7102409	It was the closest thing to a real simulator.
7118231	7121214	See, when I was like five years old, I started taking organ lessons.
7147415	7150836	The Game of the Week is Keyboard Mania.
7150976	7153856	If none of you played it, you poor, deprived people.
7177000	7177640	Go check it out.
7178601	7179661	If you can, good luck.
7179681	7184084	I'm sure the keytar thing will be pretty cool, but it's never going to be as cool as Keyboard Mania.
7184104	7185044	Keytar freaks.
7185144	7188266	Keyboard Mania is still, I think, at Milpitas Golf Land, at least.
7188406	7188806	I think.
7188946	7189587	Last time I was there.
7190747	7191287	Might still be there.
7191328	7191648	I don't know.
7191728	7192468	It's been a little while.
7192488	7192628	I know.
7192688	7195109	Ours has been gone for ages.
7196110	7196390	All right.
7197391	7200212	One more segment we have to do on this show every week.
7200272	7203514	It's just mandatory for no other reason than sometimes we have to vent a little bit.
7203534	7203694	Pfft.
7218674	7227064	FUs of the week, DarkSakura FU to the place which shall not be named Loki
7228973	7238541	Um, FB to the fact that, uh, this weather changing, it's like rain, sun, rain, sun, rain, sun, is really fucking with my allergies.
7239041	7243285	Uh, yeah, I've been getting headaches the last few days, I just took some Tylenol before I came over here.
7243545	7247748	My throat now is really dry and scratchy, but I think that's from yelling a lot during the show.
7248108	7251151	You know, imitating Michael Patcher really takes a toll on you.
7255395	7256576	My FU goes to myself.
7256656	7258497	Actually, most things in life are pretty good right now.
7258517	7258978	I can't complain.
7259898	7267924	FU to myself, though, because every time I start a pattern of good eating habits, I guess you could say a diet, if you will, I break it within a week and a half.
7267984	7271167	There's always something that breaks me, and this time it was vacation.
7272694	7273695	Good for you.
7273715	7274135	Good for you.
7274155	7274595	That's great.
7296263	7298045	Wish I could lose 16 pounds, bitch.
7298145	7300247	Alright.
7300507	7305131	You were on your involuntary toast diet.
7306252	7308074	Yeah, that was bad.
7308214	7308795	That was bad.
7309255	7313039	You know things are bad when you kind of almost wish you would get sick again so you could be that thin again.
7313559	7314040	Death by Pneumonia
7336221	7338844	Yay, unnamed healthcare company that Jamie has.
7338864	7339664	I called it The Plague.
7339804	7340125	All right.
7341286	7341906	Let's wrap up.
7341947	7342307	We're done.
7342327	7344329	We don't have any other game stories, right, Loki?
7344349	7345150	You burned through them all.
7345290	7345710	We're good.
7345730	7346231	Yeah, we're done.
7346351	7346991	DarkSakura.
7347051	7349073	All right, Loki's ready to go.
7349173	7350755	Actually, I thought we'd... It's hot in here.
7350835	7351956	I thought we'd only be going an hour.
7352016	7352657	We gave you two.
7352677	7355159	What the hell are you thinking?
7356038	7358239	Hey, you were here too, lady.
7358299	7359060	It's my house.
7359880	7360760	It's my house.
7361121	7362581	If you don't like it, you get the fuck out.
7363642	7364162	Then I am.
7364422	7364802	Good night.
7365162	7365522	Bye.
7365643	7366003	Goodbye.
7366023	7369244	You've been listening.
7369284	7370385	No, we have to do final thoughts.
7370425	7371185	We can't do that yet.
7371405	7371905	Final thoughts.
7372105	7374727	Hey, my final thought was, this is my house.
7375067	7376587	If you don't like it, you get the fuck out.
7376828	7377788	Loki, your final thought.
7380149	7382110	I can't wait to edit some more Grand Theft Auto.
7382150	7383090	It's going to be awesome.
7384031	7384451	Hire me.
7384932	7388816	My final thought is I'm stopping getting fast food on the way home and ruining my diet some more.
7388836	7390097	Yay!
7390578	7393080	I did that today because I bought the wrong kind of bread.
7393100	7395523	You know, I buy this like, you know, whole wheat bread or whatever.
7395963	7400448	And I bought the wrong brand so it was really, it just had the wrong texture and just tasted weird.
7400728	7402490	So I'm like, McDonald's!
7403670	7404511	But I've been pretty good.
7404551	7406852	I haven't been going to fast food except for today.
7408092	7411834	My other final thought, my mom's going to be pissed when she finds out who won American Idol.
7412514	7412814	Who did?
7413314	7414515	Lee, Dwight, or whatever.
7414535	7415715	Which one was that?
7415735	7416956	He sucked last night.
7417076	7418777	I haven't watched any of this season.
7418857	7419137	I know.
7419217	7419857	I barely do.
7420017	7423639	I did like that Crystal Bauer song because I thought she was good because somebody showed me her Alanis cover.
7423939	7426320	And apparently Alanis came out to duet with her tonight.
7427102	7428043	Okay, I have to see that.
7428063	7428703	That I have to see.
7428723	7429864	Did you see the little show last night?
7429884	7430785	That's the girl with the dreads, right?
7430945	7431706	No, no.
7431806	7435369	I heard she blew... He sucked last night, but... That was the chick with the dreads, right?
7435389	7435569	Yeah.
7435909	7436450	Oh, she's cool.
7436610	7437391	Yeah.
7437411	7438031	No, she lost.
7438251	7439633	Just like Adam Lambert lost last year.
7439773	7440213	You know what?
7440373	7442795	I did, I did actually... My mom's gonna be... You know what?
7443175	7444457	You wanna call my mom and tell her?
7444977	7445177	Okay.
7445337	7445818	Okay, hold on.
7447119	7447659	By the way, Rob.
7448020	7448160	What?
7448180	7454105	I have to tell you, I did actually buy some of the stuff off of Allison Irohita's album.
7455234	7461369	Clearly the game part of the show is over, so if you were here for the video games, then goodnight.
7462543	7465344	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
7465844	7469046	Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
7469546	7474348	To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Don't talk over the disclaimer!
7474448	7476729	No, I talk over the disclaimer.
7476749	7477750	Blah, blah, blah.
7477970	7479270	All games, listen to them, they roll.
7479290	7479490	Yes, I do.
7479510	7480651	But they do have micropencher.
7480711	7481331	See you next week.
7494318	7494638	No, we won't.
7494758	7495798	All right, there we go.
7496398	7496678	Let's see.
7496698	7497979	We'll see you in two weeks.
7499919	7500379	Let's go on.
7502180	7503500	She's watching it right now, too.
7504760	7505700	Your mom's so funny.
7505900	7512942	Oh, don't ruin it for her.
7512962	7513722	Oh, then we're calling right now.
7519523	7519883	Hello?
7520023	7520383	Hi, Mom.
7522435	7522978	Who is this?
7523199	7524406	It's Rob, your kid
7525467	7529830	I already know who won.
7529870	7531050	Why are you laughing?
7531090	7532451	Why are you laughing?
7532511	7537034	We're on the radio right now and I was calling because I read it on the internet and I wanted to spoil it for you.
7537134	7540756	I got on the internet at 7 o'clock.
7540816	7541817	I'm not stupid.
7542037	7543978	She was robbed.
7544518	7545379	This is weird.
7545439	7551262	My mother a year ago you made me go online and look it up.
7551682	7552763	You didn't know how to do this.
7553482	7555022	Yeah, but I don't need your help anymore.
7555243	7558984	Is this why you decided to... Did you hear that?
7559124	7561324	You got served.
7562205	7563565	I'm not on the radio, am I?
7563605	7564045	Yeah, you are.
7564105	7565045	It's okay.
7565225	7568086	You don't mind, do you?
7568306	7571327	My mom said that I had to text her and warn her before we call.
7572348	7574848	Mom, this is the part after the credits, so no one's listening.
7574888	7575208	It's cool.
7578909	7580630	But are you watching the finale anyway?
7581565	7582926	I didn't watch the first half.
7582966	7584908	I said, I'm not going to watch it because I'm too mad.
7585328	7587530	And then I couldn't stand it, so I turned it on.
7587890	7589952	Now, did you or did you not tell me last year?
7590252	7592034	First off, who should have won last year?
7592954	7593174	Adam.
7594075	7594656	I know, right?
7594816	7596277	And why should Adam have won last year?
7597418	7598979	Because he was by far the best.
7599440	7600480	And what made him the best?
7602202	7602942	He just was.
7603002	7604063	He was more of a showman.
7604103	7604944	He was the best.
7605084	7611049	That's why that Chris guy is selling his stuff on QVC and Adam's touring.
7615017	7616138	I did like Allison.
7617178	7622723	Explain why... Yes, I liked Allison too and she's doing okay because I saw her on the... I bought her album.
7623928	7624749	It's actually really good.
7625610	7625890	Hold on.
7625930	7627251	You guys are talking last year's news.
7627291	7628853	I want to talk this year again.
7628993	7630795	Hey, I'm still reeling over David Cook.
7630935	7631396	Pardon me.
7631796	7632397	Well, okay.
7632697	7634999	Like last night, I mean, Lee stunk.
7635279	7638783	His first single's going to be A Beautiful Day, and it was awful.
7639043	7639744	It was just terrible.
7639764	7640685	I know it was terrible.
7641165	7644749	And the one that she did was really good, and I was hoping that would come out on...
7645342	7649685	on a CD because I'd like to buy it.
7650565	7654828	Don't you think the runner-ups often fare better unless you're the beatboxing guy?
7654848	7656849	In the last few years, they have.
7656889	7665274	And the reason they have is because, and I've told you this before, it becomes a popularity contest in the end and the little girls all vote for the cute guys.
7665915	7669857	Except for David Cook because I thought Archuleta did not have nearly the talent that David Cook had.
7671647	7678770	Well, I think it wasn't so much that he didn't have the talent, but he was really young.
7678810	7681072	That was my mother respectfully disagreeing with you.
7681132	7681732	Did you hear that?
7681772	7684773	Did you hear her look for the politically correct?
7686454	7690036	I honestly, personally, I think that David Cook had better stage presence, but that's me.
7691076	7694618	Well, he probably did, but he was older and more mature.
7695279	7702202	and I think the same way this year with Aaron because I thought Aaron was really a good singer but he was only 17 and he didn't have the
7702952	7730983	you know, he didn't have the charisma and stuff I had him in my third place spot I was picking, well originally because we had a work pool for this I had Crystal, Casey and Aaron, because Lee at the time, I mean it was like a good you know, before I think it was at the top ten he didn't start out to be one of the better ones he just kind of sucked he just sounded like a bunch of mainstream artists now I like Big Mike too
7731323	7742167	I have to ask you this, because you said last year, when Adam lost last year, you said, and I quote, I am never watching that show again, because the person that should win never does.
7742487	7747148	And yet, you watched this year... No, they used to, but lately it hasn't been that way.
7747188	7748989	Well, did Ruben deserve to beat Clay?
7750089	7752350	No, Clay deserved it by far.
7752650	7760593	Okay, actually, if you don't mind me asking, because I'm of two minds about this too, did you prefer Carrie Underwood or Bo Bice?
7762037	7763477	Oh, I preferred Carrie Underwood.
7763997	7770198	Most of the time I've been for the person that's won, there's been a few times though that I thought the second place one should have won.
7770879	7774399	See, I'm from Alabama, so Bo Bice automatically got my vote.
7774659	7776119	And he sang with Leonard Skinner.
7776159	7777140	How could he go wrong with that?
7777160	7778780	Okay, I have to ask my mother though.
7779140	7782321	Mom, are you going to make the threat that you're not watching next year?
7783701	7787001	I don't think with Simon gone, I don't think it's going to be nearly as popular.
7787401	7788562	Our diva's leaving.
7788722	7790622	Who do you think should replace Simon?
7792772	7795194	I don't think there's anybody that can be replaced.
7795214	7798416	It's just like when they took Paula off.
7798476	7799477	The show lost something.
7799497	7799597	No.
7799657	7800558	You know who I want to replace, Simon?
7800578	7800878	Graham Norton.
7810435	7810595	Who?
7811315	7813936	Graham Norton, he's a talk show host.
7814356	7814816	He's funny.
7814876	7816176	What about Perez Hilton?
7816937	7820498	Well, some people have suggested Howard Stern too.
7820758	7822338	He wants to do it.
7822518	7824539	I don't think that's a good idea.
7824599	7829580	No, Howard Stern, it's like a big joke gone out of control and Perez Hilton is just a bitch.
7830440	7835324	And it would turn into a dirty show if Howard Stern got on there.
7835764	7836765	What else was I going to say?
7838186	7842310	The X Factor, Simon's new show that Paula is rumored to be a judge on.
7842370	7843951	Suddenly it's the reality TV podcast.
7844011	7845552	No, no, she's got a dance show.
7845652	7846753	She's going to do a dance show.
7847454	7848114	Where have you been?
7848174	7850316	Are you under a rock or something?
7850376	7852918	Sorry, I'm doing a show on video games.
7852978	7853358	Hey, hold on.
7853578	7854519	I'm a games analyst.
7854879	7855260	Did you hear?
7856727	7857007	No.
7858008	7859328	How'd you get to be a games analyst?
7859368	7860169	I told Robby was.
7860509	7861669	Yeah, Jamie told me I was.
7862090	7862750	He was endorsed.
7865351	7868793	In other words, you're a games analyst in your own mind.
7869213	7869994	Well, okay, sure.
7870734	7872435	That's not what my business card says, but sure.
7874365	7876707	I'm an authority idol in my own mind, too.
7876727	7879450	I just use my female powers of always being right to make Rob an analyst.
7879490	7880110	X Factor, yes or no?
7880551	7881752	Are you going to watch it?
7896195	7902777	Probably because I think it'll be a much better show because it won't be relying on the public to pick the winner.
7903017	7905058	Okay, one more, then I promise I'm wrapping this up.
7905498	7909920	That little 11-year-old kid that Ellen DeGeneres, I know you watch her show every day, right?
7909940	7910840	Absolutely great.
7911360	7913341	He's got that Bieber kid beat to it.
7914181	7915962	I mean, he's so much better.
7916962	7918062	This is why I love my mother.
7918843	7921123	His name is Chance.
7921344	7922944	His first name is Grayson.
7923844	7924325	Grayson?
7924485	7925665	Yeah, Grayson Chance.
7926109	7927630	He's absolutely great.
7927690	7929111	Did you watch Glee last night?
7929451	7929731	No.
7930012	7931513	They did Gaga.
7931873	7932573	Where were you?
7932814	7933794	How come you didn't see it?
7934094	7935035	Okay, wait, wait.
7935455	7940919	I have to ask my mother this about this whole thing with... Rob, I adore your mom.
7941139	7941359	I know.
7941379	7942120	She's pretty cool, right?
7943641	7945802	Oh, now I forgot what I was going to ask about the... Glee.
7946343	7947043	No, not Glee.
7947063	7950946	Before that, the Grayson chants and the... Yeah.
7951106	7951486	Bieber.
7951726	7955128	Oh, since you're hooked up to the internet now, you know how to use Google?
7955168	7955789	How to use Google?
7956209	7966159	Yeah, absolutely There's probably a lot of them with that haircut he's got This is my mother, but it's funny My mom likes Lady Gaga, do you like Lady Gaga?
7980717	8005650	Yeah She didn't used to She thought Lady Gaga was disgusting But then when I said, no, Lady Gaga's cool My mom came around I'm still not coming around I never said she was disgusting I've never really paid that much attention to her You said when she did that performance Where she set the piano on fire And did the whiskey bottles and stuff You were like, oh no You were mad because Adam Lambert Got in trouble over kissing a guy
8007290	8010791	and everybody else had like grabbed their crotch and everything, right?
8011732	8014953	And worse things were done by other people and they didn't pay attention to it.
8014993	8016014	That's what made me mad.
8016114	8016834	That's what he said.
8016894	8020495	He said himself is like, well, if all these other people can get away with it, why shouldn't I be able to?
8021376	8022676	Exactly on the same show.
8023497	8024797	I can't remember.
8024917	8025837	Was it Janet Jackson?
8025857	8026438	I don't remember.
8026498	8028599	Somebody did something worse.
8029739	8030039	All right.
8030499	8034021	And they didn't even say anything.
8034341	8034601	I think
8035330	8044878	but I think he's getting past that now and I'm glad because I don't think people you know, they're not being that judgmental about him anymore.
8045199	8051144	Alright, we have to wrap up this extremely random epilogue that's had nothing to do with video games whatsoever.
8051184	8052365	Is there any video games you're excited about?
8052385	8053265	There's an American Idol video game.
8053285	8054987	Yeah, are there any video games you're excited about, Mom?
8056468	8057809	I don't do video games.
8058370	8059491	Are you going to play Farmville?
8060652	8063114	I absolutely know nothing about video games.
8064952	8065413	Farmville?
8065573	8066073	Farmville?
8067254	8072258	Is that the one that my friend was playing on the internet where you own a farm and you try to make money?
8072818	8073679	She knows Farmville.
8073799	8074699	There you go.
8074959	8075180	See?
8075260	8075900	She's a bigger gamer.
8075920	8077361	Well, she was playing that on the internet.
8077381	8078202	She got hooked on it.
8080783	8084126	You officially know more about the internet than my grandmother does.
8085907	8086648	Congratulations.
8086708	8087208	I don't know.
8087348	8088609	I don't know a lot.
8088649	8089850	She's come a long way in a year.
8089890	8090190	No, I...
8091639	8094941	I don't want to give out my mom's email on the show, but it's really funny.
8095021	8095961	Absolutely not.
8095981	8097022	No, I'm not going to.
8097242	8098823	I'm not, but it's really funny.
8098923	8100844	Like, if you know her email, it's really funny.
8101004	8108767	But I actually remember a couple years ago when, actually, we gave you a call a few years ago and tried to ask you about something and you didn't know because it was online.
8108807	8113449	And now, you know, my mom's on the internet.
8114049	8115190	My grandmother's on the internet now.
8115910	8117411	My dad is on Facebook.
8118894	8122537	I think the apocalypse is happening.
8122577	8123818	Why do you not want to go on Facebook?
8125760	8129363	Because I don't want to put my face on there for a day's see.
8129863	8130143	All right.
8130744	8133286	Mom, we got to wrap up and put the nail in the coffin at the show.
