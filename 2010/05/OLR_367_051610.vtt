Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 367 of Orange Lounge Radio

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
The video game talk show where every gamer has a voice

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
First on up, the one, the only, the fabulous, Dark Sakura

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Here's my impression of Rob earlier

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
What?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
What episode number is this?

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
Okay, no. Okay, before we went on air, because you know, I wanted to have the episode number down

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Because I lost count like three years ago, longer than that, where we were at with the show

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
You know I have to give you a hard time

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
So I said, what episode number are we on? Just kind of like a rhetorical question

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
Like I'm actually going to look it up, like I don't expect Dark Sakura or Loki to know it

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
And Jamie in the background, she's all, 69

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
I said 50 million

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Oh did you? I thought you said 69

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
You said 69

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
I thought you said 69

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
I totally thought she said 69 too

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
I said 50 million

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Alright so it's episode number 69 of Orange

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
Actually in two weeks, no three weeks, because there's not going to be a show in a couple weeks

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
But the show after Labor Day will be episode number 369

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Brought to you by the multiples of three

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
That's right

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Oh that is weird, 369

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Alright anyhow

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Also the other voice you hear over there, the one and only tech master Loki

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Hello

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Who's favorite game by the way, is that Rainbow Unicorn game

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
It is not

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
That's all you ever play on this program is Rainbow Unicorn

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
That's not what I play

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
I played the werewolf ice cream man one not too long ago

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
How dare I

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
And I played the, was it the Mario crossover game the other week

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
I just didn't have the link for the Mario crossover game because I was going to play that

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
That was actually pretty awesome with the Contra guys blowing up all the blocks

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
I do have the link to the Unicorn game but that's about all I have right now

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
Alright also joining us tonight, you guys in our chat room because we do tape live every week at All Games Radio

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000

If you are listening to us live please pull up a chair and join us in our chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
We're going to move into a little bit of how was your gaming week

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
That's how we always start off the show

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
First off Dark Sakura, I understand, school's out for summer

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Yay

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Well I'm going to school in the summer

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Oh never mind then

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Well but I make it to skip pre-algebra

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Well who

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
Because for some reason ARC's website just let me sign up for algebra in the fall

03:03.000 --> 03:10.000
And I was going to do like the self study thing in the summer because it's freaking pre-algebra so whatever

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
So I may only be taking history this summer but that means I graduate

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Wow

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
In the fall

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Wow

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
With my AA

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
My AA

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
My AA

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Your alcoholics anonymous

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
AA

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Alright

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
So you'll actually have time to actually play games again, it'll be great

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
I've been playing games though

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Alright well tell us a little bit about your gaming week

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
Even though I've had like my final projects and crap due

03:34.000 --> 03:42.000
I played, well I downloaded something for free that we'll be talking about later because everybody freaking downloaded it

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
I was having a wait in the damn queue

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
And then I played that stupid gay ass unicorn game

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Excuse you

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
No that's what it's called

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Oh okay

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
Well you have to have the ass to make your unicorn be extra gay or something I don't know

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Wait wait wait wait you're not talking about

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
No the one on Steam

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Oh you played the Pink Anus game

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Anus that was it

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Yes

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I thought, I was thinking of the hand he called

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Oh gosh what was the name of it

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Magic Stone or Legend of Magic Stone or something

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Okay yes

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
I got as far as looking in the stable and I was like this is crap and turned it off

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Just so those you know catching up with OLR

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
It's also very Engrishy

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Who haven't heard the past few episodes

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
There's a game on Steam and it was Alan that brought it to our attention

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
Where in the, it's like something like about a mystical unicorn or whatever

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
And you see in the screenshots like there's like a crafting screen or something

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
And one of the materials you use is A-E-N-U-S it's anus but it's pink

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
So it's the magical unicorn with pink anus game

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
And Dark Sakura bought it cause she's a consumer whore

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
And hell

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
But no like I tried to, it's really like a click and drag type stuff to use things

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
And I was like this is like a big bad flash game

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
You can groom his hooves

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
And he was a little cult when you first got him

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
And now he's a golden unicorn with sparklies falling out of his butt

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
At least that's what it looked like

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
I put up a screen capture somewhere I think on my Twitter or something

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
You make everybody want to play this game very badly

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Here's my review

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
Pink sparkles out of a unicorn's anus

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
It's anus

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
A-E-N-U-S

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Anus

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
My anus is bleeding

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Or would it be

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
It would be emus cause the neod

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
Anyway and then and then and then and then and then and then and then

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
I know you can't have it cause you can't spell your

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Sorry

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Um

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Then um

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
I played other stuff

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Yeah I played more um

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Beluga whale

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
I'm sorry S-B-G-B

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
And um

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
I played um well well we've been

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Well I was watching Dan play Alan Wake

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
And here's our review of it

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Um

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Max Payne meets Silent Hill

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
The end

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
It's actually not that bad

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
And then um

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Oh god we played some other stuff too

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Oh yeah I went to Pinagogo

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
So I played pinball

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Isn't that like a big convention type thing for pinball?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
It's in Dixon

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Oh nevermind

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
Well no it was a pretty big event for pinball folks

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Just to describe Dixon

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Like if you're driving between Sacramento which is OLR headquarters

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
And you know the capital of California

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
And if you're driving between Sacramento and San Francisco which is where all the fun things are

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
Dixon is kind of like the pink anus of that drive

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
It's like

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Sorry the pink anus

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
You look over and you see a gas station

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
A Mary's pizza shack and farms

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
That's about it

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
And fruit stand

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
And fruit

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I went to the Yolo fruit stand yesterday but anyway

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
So yeah um I got

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
I also

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
And I forget this every year because I've been to like four Pinagogos now

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I'm allergic to the town of Dixon

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
No seriously

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
No I'm being absolutely serious

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Okay

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Every time I've been to Dixon

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
I end up getting some type of weird heat stroke

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
My allergies get like

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
You know how allergic I am to dogs

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
It gets that bad

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
I swear

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
I took two doses of Benadryl Sudafed and Zyrtec

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
And I was taking local honey

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
And giving myself shots

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
And you name it for allergies I was doing

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
I was snorting crap

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I was still like super you know

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Eyedrops my eyeballs were floating

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
And it was just like not

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
It was not beautiful

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
I felt like that my eyeballs were the size of like

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Double the size of my head

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
And so I went and sat in the car

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Texted Dan I'm sick

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
I kept hiding in the bathroom because it was in a place with air conditioning

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
And um playing Final Fantasy 2

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
Sitting on the floor of the bathroom at the Dixon Mayfair

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Sounds like fun

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
Sounds like the sophistication being sucked right out of you

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
And that's why you're having all those you know

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Complications and stuff

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
Just like sorry you're too sophisticated for here

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
And well I finally ended up going and sat out in the car

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
So I could turn on the air conditioner

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
And filter out the pollen

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Because you know we run the AC in my car

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
No pollen gets in you know

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
And so I was doing that long enough to get everything settled down

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
So I could take some more stuff

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
And so finally I get to where I'm feeling better

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
I drink some vitamin water I'm feeling good

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
And then Dan texts me so do you want to go home?

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Yes

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
And not to not to not to say anything bad about the uh

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Pina Gogo

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Because it's a great event

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
But if you have hay fever

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
If you've got allergies to nature to grass

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
Um don't go unless you bring your own plastic bubble

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
And then it makes the plastic bubbles really can't play pinball very well in them

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
So I just totally wouldn't you know

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
I would say um a gas mask could work

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
You could actually play the gas mask on that would work

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
But as far as what I played um

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
I played uh Back to the Future

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
And I played Revenge from Mars

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Which is one of the pinball 2000

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
And um I played F14 Tomcat

09:25.000 --> 09:31.000
I was going for mostly the mid 80s to early 90s era of pinball

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
You know just kind of get into it

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
And I played this 80s

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
It's like a mullet era of pinball

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Well I was going to say speaking of that

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
I played a pinball machine called Punk

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
And it had like the you know

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Looked like uh pictures from uh

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
What was that movie with Nicolas Cage

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
And Valley Girl

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
You know and all the

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
The guys on the on the play field

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Looked like Duran Duran

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
And it was kind of funny

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Even though they weren't very punk they had that hair though

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
But um and eyeliner

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Um and that one was actually pretty fun

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
For an old school you know

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Earlier era of pinball

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
And there was a Beatles pinball there

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I took a picture to send to Tiara

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
I didn't realize they made a Beatles pinball game

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Kind of random

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
And um there was like a Spiderman

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
And the Ted Nugent one

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
I love the picture from the Ted Nugent one

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Because he's there with his hair

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
And the guitar and the guitar's a gun

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
And he's shooting out of his guitar gun

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
And I was like rock on Ted

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Huge anyway

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
And so uh I was

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
And my other thing and I know I'm going off on this

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Is I was actually so caught up

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Because me being the big design

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Freaking nerd that I am

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
I was going around taking pictures of

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Of interesting design

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Of like cool pictures and neat you know

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Early 80's late 70's style art

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
And

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
So I'll put some of the pictures up

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
They're on my phone

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Yeah you're a nerd yeah

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
But I did play other games

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Well I said I played Final Fantasy II didn't I?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Yes while you're on the bathroom floor

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Crying and sobbing because of your allergies

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
I wasn't crying

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
And um

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Yeah I played some Star Trek Online

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Fun

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
I'm sure I played something else

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Oh yeah I started playing Braid

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
And then I

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Kind of remembered that I had to do other things like homework

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I'm done with my finals

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
I love how you sum it up

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
I started to play this game

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
But then I was like oh god I have something better to do

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Bye

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
No it wasn't something better to do

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
It was something responsible to do

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Rob

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Screw that growing up

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
So you're Robba and our other one is Robba

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I know I know

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Alright Loki I don't know if you can top

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Dark Sakura's adventures in Dickson

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Pinball and Final Fantasy II on the bathroom floor

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
While she's trying to recover from allergies

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
But you want to try?

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
I didn't go to Dickson

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
That's already an improvement right there

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Let's see

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
I played

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
I played a lot of things that

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Have yet to come out

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Including APB

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I've been playing the beta of that and I love it

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Because it's just like

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
To me it's like crossing Saints Row with

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Free Mode and Grand Theft Auto 4

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
You kind of

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Do what you need to do

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
You have different missions

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
I guess this would be the tutorial portion of the game

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
They have you go

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Spray graffiti

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
And break

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Some stuff

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
And then eventually at the seal stuff

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
In the course later on as it's going on

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
You'll gain

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
More notoriety and

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
They'll have more enforcers

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Coming at you

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
And the enforcers of course are played by

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
People online as well

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
So you can play

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Both the villains and

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Kind of the heroes I guess in the game

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
I'm playing of course as one of the gang bangers

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Because that's fun

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Lots of customization

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
In the character creator

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
It's just nuts

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
How much customization is in there

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
The clothing though you don't really have a lot of options

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
At first you have to kind of buy that stuff

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Or unlock it later on

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
When you finish different missions

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Same with cars and what not

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
But I'm really digging it

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
I might go back to

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
That as an MMO but we'll see

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
I kind of like the fact though that

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
The way they have their

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Pay scale for it

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Basically you pay it as you go

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
So for someone like me that doesn't

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Necessarily get a lot of time

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
To dedicate to MMOs or stuff like that

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
It wouldn't be so bad because

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
You know the time I'm not playing it

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I'm not actually losing out on anything

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Because you pay for the hours that you

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Want to use

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
It sounds good to me

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
I may try it

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
I have to upgrade my computer though too

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
So it might be a little bit

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Other fun stuff

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
I happened to get a copy of

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Red Dead Redemption a little early

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
So I've been playing that

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
And I love the game

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Not a big surprise because it's a little bit like Grand Theft Auto

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
But for me

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
A lot of it's been like Oregon Trail

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Extreme

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Nice

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
It's a hunting portion of Oregon Trail

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Because in the game you make money

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
You can hunt stuff and skin them

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
And take the meat and the skins

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Or whatever

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
But you could only carry 100 pounds back to the wagon?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Oh no I was able to kill a lot of things

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
I don't know about 100 pounds worth of skins

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Did you know in that game you can skin a horse?

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
I did not know that

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Yes you can skin a horse

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Because I got through with this one mission

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Where I had to go

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Kill some gang members

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Kind of hiding in this house

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
And so we killed them

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Captured them or whatever

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
And all their horses were left around

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
And I'm like I can't ride six horses

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
What am I going to do with this?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
So I killed them all and skinned them

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
And sold their skins

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
For $2 each

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
And then I saw Onward Dills running around

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Breaking news

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
PETA hates Red Dead Redemption

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Oh I'm sure they will

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
You can kill all sorts of creatures out there

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
I haven't found the bears yet though

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
But it's really cool

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
And the fact that the game looks a lot better

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Than Grand Theft Auto

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Just a few years

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
And the amount of improvements in the engine

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
It's just amazing

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Definitely worth picking up though

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Then another game I was quite excited to check out

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Was Split Second

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
And really digging that

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I love how crazy the races are in the game

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
And just

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
I didn't play a whole lot of it

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
So I got to play some of the one track

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
That they had I think at E3

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
The airport

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
That's just the demo

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
I didn't play a lot of it

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
But I love the game

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
It's awesome

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
I was playing the demo

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
I'm not cool like you

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
You can get all these early games

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
In the know or whatever

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
I was playing the split second demo myself

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
It was as fun as I remember at E3

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
It was still the same game

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
That was probably

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Funny enough probably my game of show

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Last E3

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Last E3 was not a huge year for me

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
But that was probably the best thing I played at the show

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
So I'm excited that game is finally coming out

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Like Tuesday right?

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
And I'm looking forward to

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
I'm going to try some of the multiplayer in Red Dead

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
When it does come out

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Because they do have a lot of neat multiplayer options in there

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
But at the same time I'm also working on

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Doing another edited

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Modded Grand Theft Auto game

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
I have some maps now

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
But there's specific rules you have to follow

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
As far as getting stuff to work

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
And stuff that normally works on the PC version

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Doesn't work on the console version or whatnot

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
But um

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Oh yeah

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
I got to play some of the listeners

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
During this week's

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Grand Theft Auto games

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Oh finally some listeners took you up on the challenge

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
That was fun

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
And then of course

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
More Grand Theft Auto

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
I think that's really

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Did you school the listeners?

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Or did they school you?

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
I school them, I school everybody I play

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
And so humble

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Well the only times I lose

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
It seems lately is when I get

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Cocky and just start messing around

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
And then I get to the point where

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
They get too close and one of them gets lucky

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Killing and I'm unable

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
To make it across the map to kill somebody

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
So I don't do that anymore

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
But no

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
I'm actually like ranked

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
67 now so I'm

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Going up there trying to

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Make as close to number one as possible

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Moving on up, moving on up

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Alright congratulations

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Hey this is episode 367

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Of OLR and you're number 67 on Grand Theft Auto

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Hey how about that

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
And I did pick up 3D.GameHeroes

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
But I haven't played

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Then we'll move to my gaming week

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Because I did play 3D.GameHeroes

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
I picked that up as well and you know I was kind of

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Motivated by the price point of just $40

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
It kind of seemed like a bargain to me

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
So I decided to pick up the game and I didn't know much about the game

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Okay here's how clueless I was about the game

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
I thought it was kind of like a game editor

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Type of game where you would get to make your own little

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Adventure games

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
No that's not what it is so

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Let's take a step back and talk about what

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
3D.GameHeroes actually is

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
It's basically a gigantic rip off

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Of The Legend of Zelda

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
But that's cool you know like

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
The Legend of Zelda was a great game

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
It's kind of fascinating that they're getting

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Away with it but hey if Nintendo

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Is not going to do anything why not

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Now you know when I say rip off

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
There's some clear parity going on here

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
They've changed just enough

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
So it's not really a rip off of Zelda like for example

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
You don't have hearts

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
You have apples

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
What is he called? Kidneys

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
That'd be funny

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
That's I guess maybe the core

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Part of the customization of 3D.GameHeroes

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Is that your hero can be anything you want

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
You actually have a mode where you can

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Go in and edit

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
The default guy I guess you could say like

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
The person in slot number one in the character edit

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Mode looks like the dude from Dragon Warrior

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
So I don't

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Know what you're supposed to like I'm 12

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
So I give all my characters like 3 year old

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Names I name my character vulva

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
So I don't know what the normal

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Character name is shut up

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Alan and I picked

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Out a good name

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Save us vulva

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Save us from the evil empire

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
So

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Yeah I don't remember what his name is

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Usually

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Somebody in chat will probably yell it out

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
But whatever it doesn't matter what his name is

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
The game

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
The game is like this giant love letter

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
From guys our age but in Japan

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Because I know it was developed over there

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Who kind of miss what gaming used to be

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
I mean if you think about the concept

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Of this game

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
The story is that there's this

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Where everybody stopped visiting

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
It and it got old because

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
You know just people didn't care about

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
It anymore so their big idea was

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
To go 3D to change

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
The world I mean that

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
There's kind of like this really

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Hidden bitter subtext there about how

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Everything is 3D in this day and age

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
And why can't our games be 2D anymore

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
So and it's just loaded

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
With references to old 8-bit games

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Mostly Zelda but there's other stuff

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
In there as well that's really funny

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Including more current games

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Because from software the developer

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
They made this other great Playstation 3

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Game that came out a little while ago

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Called Demon Souls and there's

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Actually this room in the game where

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
If you walk in the right spot

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
It says there's a message on the ground

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Here something like that it says

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Do you want to recommend this message?

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Yes it says somewhere someone got healed

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
That's funny if you've played

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Demon Souls if you haven't

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
It makes no fucking sense you're just like

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
What is this randomness but

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Whatever but then there's a chick right next

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
To it and you find white sticky stuff in front of her

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Which is also a Demon Souls reference

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
But it sounds like

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Porno which is really funny

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Because there's a lot of parts in this game

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
That really push the envelope

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Of an E10 rating but it's funny

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Like there's a whore

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
In the game you pay her to

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Do the fruit fruit with you or whatever they call it

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
And the fufu

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
I don't know what it is and that's

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
You do the fufu

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
But then you wake up and it's her dad

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
I kid you not

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
I kid you not spoiler

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
So anyway

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
You know what

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
It's 40 bucks

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
The game has flaws yes it has

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Flaws there's slow down

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
In some of the dungeons because the water

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Effect that they do in the game is so

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Over the top and there's a lot in this

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Game that's really over the top like

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
I don't know the size of your sword

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
When you have a full health bar like takes up

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
The entire screen

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
As long as you don't get it

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
I was making all kinds of inappropriate jokes

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Yeah

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
It's funny it's really over the top there's a lot

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
That's very over the top about this game

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
And they decide for whatever reason

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
To do the water effects really over the top

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
And it causes

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Slow down in one of the dungeons

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
And it's like okay folks

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
This is the PlayStation

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
3

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
The government bought PlayStation 3

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Where's your cell processor now

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Exactly

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
It's like this game

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
And to be honest there's really nothing

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
About 3D Dot Game Heroes

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
That deserves to be on the PlayStation 3

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
This game could have been on the PS2

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
I mean yes it has trophies

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
And yes it's widescreen but

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
I think there were a handful of widescreen

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Games on the PS2 as well and

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
That's really it

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
I mean graphically

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
You're not getting that much more oomph

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
On the PS3

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
But I'm okay with it and they give it a pass

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Because again you're charging me

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
About the cost of a PS2 game

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
You know 40 bucks

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
And it's you know still a good time

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
And at the end you just have to evaluate

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Did I have fun yes or no

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
And I had fun playing the game

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Despite it's flaws

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
So I wouldn't give the game like an A++

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
But I'd give it a good like solid

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
It's silly

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Especially if you're a gamer in that age bracket

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Late 20's early 30's

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Or even if you're a younger gamer

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
That knows your retro gaming history

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Then you're gonna get a kick out of this

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
And get some lols

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
And I don't think it made our

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Show roll but

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
They have some really cool custom characters

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
You can download off of their

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
The 3D Dot Game Heroes Hall of Heroes

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Website

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Including they have a little arcade game you can play as

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Little girl Cthulhu

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Um

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Chickens

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Well yeah one of the default characters in the game

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Is Santa Claus so I mean that's funny

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
You're Santa Claus going around with a giant sword

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Ha ha

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
The only kind of weak thing

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
I guess is that that's where the

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Customization kind of ends

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
And I guess maybe with LittleBigPlanet

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Being the big thing on PS3 I was hoping

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
For a little more

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
I don't know maybe I'm just being greedy

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
I thought there was gonna be a little more to customize here

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Maybe in the sequel

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
And I hope there is a sequel

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
You know what

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Something just occurred to me that I should do

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
I need to get RPG Maker for PC

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
You should

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
And do Orange Dodge Radio

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
The RPG

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Is that gonna be your little project while you don't have school?

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
You should do that it'd be fun

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Well I've got clients that I'm working for but

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
You know what I'm gonna leave it now

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Whoever's in the chat room who wants to work with me on this

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Or three years ago or three maybe

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
I know that Dark Dead 2 was working on something at one time

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
No somebody did like a text adventure

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Yeah we had a text adventure

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
It was really funny

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
I don't even know where I can get a copy of that anymore

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
I got it somewhere

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
If I can find it I'll share it

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Yeah I

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Again you know

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
I'm nitpicking a little bit with 3D.GameHeroes

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Overall if you wanna play

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Like if you're sitting there going

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Gosh I wish they would make another 2D Zelda game

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
That I could like play on my TV

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Here you go

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
This game was like made for you

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Enjoy. Eat it up. Get a big spoon

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
They have like a little big

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Planet Sackboy type thing

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
In there called Ragdoll

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
It's one of the custom characters that someone made

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Looks just like a little pixelated

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
It's just kind of a bummer that that's like

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
The hero is like the only thing you can change

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
You know what I mean?

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Weren't you kind of hoping there would be like a little more

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Just a little more customizability to this

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Oh well

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
But you know what? 40 bucks. Hard to complain

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
SirDuckTape. Yes someone made a roll of duct tape

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Alright look other games in my gaming week

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
I don't wanna drag this out too long

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Cause we're already almost a half hour into the show

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
And haven't even touched gaming news yet

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
But I just wanted to say really quick some of the stuff I've been playing

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
World of Warcraft of course cause I'm addicted

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
And play some Game Room this week

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Cause you know they're back on the ball

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
With getting the releases out so hooray for that

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
I think I talked on the show last week about Pitfall

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
And nearly missing the top 20 right?

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
I tried to do like a perfect run of the game

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
And you know what gets me in Pitfall

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
And why I can't do it?

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
It's the scorpions and the hidden passage

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Like I have no problem

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
If I just run

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Straight from right to left or run to the left

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
I can like get through 20 minutes

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Running straight and not die once

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
And that's how I got like a score of like 85,000

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
But the minute I have to go into the tunnels

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
The scorpions eat my face

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Like that's the problem I'm having on old school Pitfall

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
But there were also some new games this week

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
And one of them was Oink and I bought that game

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
And you've probably heard me talk about this game before

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Because it was out on the 2600

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
And I don't think people really know this game

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
It was an Activision game kind of based on the story

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Of the three little pigs and I think the best

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Way I've heard it described anywhere

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
It's a reverse breakout

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
There's a wolf that's trying to blast the bricks

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
And you're trying to put the bricks back in place

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Before he can blast through them to get you

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
And Oink is out on Game Room this week

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
And so I was spending some time playing this

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
And I just saw this before the show tonight

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
Bobby, the gentleman who does the show before us

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
On all games, the Bobby Blackwell show

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Actually put a tweet out there on his tweeter

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
And he put, why pay $3 for Sky's favorite 2600 game?

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
Actually I wouldn't say it's my favorite 2600 game

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
But it's, I think maybe like Kaboom or Pitfall 2 would be my favorite 2600 game

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
But it's my most underrated

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
And I think most underappreciated 2600 game

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
When I can get the cartridge for $1

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Buy it on Game Room, I'll probably buy it on Game Room anyway

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
And sure enough he sends a picture of Oink

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
Running on his TV with the Atari 2600 hooked up

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
I think that's a lot of people's chief complaint

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
About Game Room and I get that

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
I get that complaint

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Although do keep in mind it's pretty awesome

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
With Oink when you go like

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Gosh the best score I can get in this game is 1800

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
And this game is really hard

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
How do these people get like scores of 5000 and stuff?

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Oh I can go up, fire up their replay and look at it

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
I mean those are like features you can't get in a dollar

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Cartridge and leaderboards and challenges

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
And some of this other stuff

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
You know, does it justify the increased cost?

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
I don't know, it really depends on how much these games

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Mean to you and so forth

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
There's a lot, yeah and I already did my Game Room

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Tangent a couple weeks ago

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
I'm trying very hard not to repeat it

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
There's a lot of potential with Microsoft Game Room

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
And I really hope that potential is realized

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
I'm hoping E3 is gonna drop a Whopper on us

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
I really want them to come out at that press conference

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
At E3 and go

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
We're gonna release a Whopper of a game

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
On Game Room this week and it's out

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Right now, go get it

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
And so I don't know what that game is

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
But hopefully something really cool

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
Like something not from the early early 80s

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Like something

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
I don't know, I don't know what game that could be

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Galaxian 3

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
I don't know what it'll be

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
But hopefully something they'll kind of put out

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
And it'll take Game Room to that next level

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Where it's not just Atari 2600

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
And old old old old old stuff from the 80s

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
We'll see though

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
My gut tells me

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Here's my bet

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Quote unquote

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
It's gonna be a Capcom game

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
From their like

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Street Fighter 2-ish era

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
When they were using that hardware

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
So I'm gonna play

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
The CPS 1 and 2

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
I'm gonna just

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
guesstimate with no

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Nothing to back this up whatsoever

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Cause there's already the rumors

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
That Capcom games are gonna make their way

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Like the Mega Man fighting game

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
And some of that stuff is gonna make their way

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
To the Rock Battle

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Cause Capcom supported Ultra K

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
In the past

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
So there's no reason why they wouldn't jump in on this

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
I'm gonna just speculate

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Original Street Fighter 1

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Street Fighter 1 will be the big

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
E3 Game Room release

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
I have nothing to base that off of

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
But half fanboyism

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Half, I've been doing this show for long enough

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
That I feel like I start to understand the patterns

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
In some companies

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Take it or leave it

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
And also in Game Room this week

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Keystone Capers was released

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
And I played a crap ton of that

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Alright, I'll stop talking about my gaming week now

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
We are officially a half hour into the show and haven't talked about

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
I've been playing a lot of Super Street Fighter 2

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
I got my ass handed to me in Super Street Fighter 4

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
This weekend

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
I was playing and I got schooled

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
And it just reminded me what a terrible

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Street Fighter player I am

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
I was playing Super Street Fighter 2 on my

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Arcade cabinet

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
It was fun

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Go into our chat room

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
I think some folks are speculating what the game could be

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
That's released at Game Room

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Or released at E3 for Game Room

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
SSJ100Matt speculates

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Oonga Boonga will be the game

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Dear Lord no

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
BlackWolf

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Our good pal Bobby BlackWolf says

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Miss Nude World USA

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Oh I wish

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
And BlackWolf also says

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Remember no online multiplayer

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
In Game Room so it doesn't make much sense

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
To do a fighting game

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Well to be fair sir, it really didn't make much sense

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
To put combat or outlaw there

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Either then for those same reasons

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
I mean combat is

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Is pointless

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
If you don't have someone to play it with

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
And yet you're supposed to invite someone over

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
They get on the second controller

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
So you could basically cheat for the high score on that one

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Donovan speculates

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Custer's Revenge will be the big game that's released

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
You know I just

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
I just don't think that's going to happen

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
A few people in the chat talking about Kangaroo

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
ActDeft in chat says if Game Room releases

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Kangaroo I'll buy it on release

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
I do want to warn you though

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
If they release Kongo Bongo

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Which I don't know, for some reason Kangaroo makes me think

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Of Donkey Kong which makes me think of Kongo Bongo

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Because they were all kind of

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Trying to one up each other

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Kongo Bongo is on the Sega Genesis

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Uber collection

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Be careful if Sega games start showing up

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
On Game Room because a lot of them

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Are on that collection

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Don't get swindled

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Alright let's move on to some

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Actual gaming news for heaven's sakes

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Housekeeping, join us on Twitter

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Twitter.com slash o-l-r, join us on Facebook

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Orange Lawns Radio, yada yada

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Blah blah blah gaming news, Loki

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
So Activision

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Apparently is taking some

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Lessons that they

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Possibly have learned from

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Lawsuits and what not

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
They are dropping celebrities from the next Guitar Hero

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Game so you will not see any

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
You know

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Dead Kurt Cobain's or whatever

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Singing

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Well to be fair, Kurt Cobain was not

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Portrayed as dead in the game because I think

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
If he was that would have been a whole other issue

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
That would have been a whole other issue

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
You just got he's on the stage

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
No head

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Zombie Kurt Cobain

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
So yeah, so they're basically

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Their claim is

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
They're going back to the basics

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
This is coming from the latest issue of the official

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Xbox Magazine

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Some of the old Guitar Hero

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Characters, the ones that were actually unique to

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
The game are coming back and you'll

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Be able to recruit

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Characters by playing their song sets

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
And once you do that you can also

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Unlock their alter egos

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
So for example Lars would become

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Like warrior Lars

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
And that will allow you to

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Get a

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
Times six multiplier

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Quick play

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
I guess is being revamped

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Of course

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
The DLC from

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Guitar Hero 5 and before that

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
It will be compatible with Guitar Hero 6

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
They're doing

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
I guess streaker's momentum

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Do or die are now available in

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Online competitive modes

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
New power challenges

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Queen, kiss

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Black Sabbath, they're confirmed to be

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
In the game, I guess quest mode will

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Feature Gene Simmons as a narrator

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Because he needs money

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Does he have a

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
TV show, does he get money from that

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Well, he's freaking Gene Simmons

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
All he has to do is go in a freak show and

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Stick out his tongue, you know what though, he was on the Celebrity

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Apprentice and that's, you know

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
If you're resorting to going, Joan Rivers

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Was on the Celebrity Apprentice

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
And that's Joan Rivers, her career's kind

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Of not gone

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Now she's got a movie coming out and all this stuff

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
A couple years ago

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
They claim there's going to be a bigger focus on rock and roll

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Right

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Focus on rock and roll

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Well I'm glad they're making a bigger focus

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
On rock and roll and not, I don't know

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Making money

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Why do I just have this feeling, like I'm not trying to be negative

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Or be a fanboy or whatever, but why do I just have

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
This feeling that in E3

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
We're going to see Rock Band 3 and it's just going to

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Blow this shit out of the water

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Like it's just going to annihilate Guitar Hero

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Let me play this way

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Um

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
I don't really

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Give a crap about, I mean look at

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Look at Guitar Hero 5, what exactly did

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Guitar Hero 5 do that was that

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Great over Guitar Hero World Tour

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Nothing really

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
I mean it was pretty much, hey look

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
We have new songs

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Yeah? Yeah?

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
How about we throw in

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Or throw in Van Halen

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Eh, two games to press one

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Is that the first game with the whole

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
You can do four singers if you want

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
And four guitarists and all that stuff

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Wow that's awesome, we're going to put

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Four drummers in my house, yeah cause

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
That makes sense

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Um

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
I don't know, it sounds dumb

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
And this one doesn't sound that great to me

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
But you know what, I'm kind of biased because

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
I don't really care for the Guitar Hero series really

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Once I had Rock Band 2 it was just like

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
I don't really care

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
You know I've got all these download songs

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
That I need to buy another game

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Rock Band 3, I'm going to kind of consider it

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
The same thing unless I see them doing

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Something really unique with it

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Although I do have faith in harmonics that they're

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Going to actually put something out decent

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
That's going to be

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Different enough from the last game

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
So, props to them for that

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
But, I mean look at like the Guitar Hero

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Um, their song creator

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
And stuff that they had in game, that was supposed to be

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Like this huge feature and everyone's kind of like

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Eh, whatever

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
You know, so

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
We'll see, I mean

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
We don't know a lot about it yet

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
But, I'm not expecting much

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Just like with DJ Hero 2

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
I'm not expecting much

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
New songs, that's about it

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Which could be a good thing, because if you set the expectation bar really low

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Then, you know, they have the potential to really

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Overcome that, whereas I think the

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Expectation bar with Rock Band 3

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Is really high, at least for me

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Like, I'm expecting this game to really blow me

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Out of the water, because they've had a couple years

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
To kind of perfect it now

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
They didn't do a Rock Band game last year, you know what I mean

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Well, okay, yeah, they had the Beatles

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
But you saw the progression from Rock Band 2

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
To the Beatles interface, so you're kind of

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Yeah, and like, was this

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
You know, the Green Day Rock Band stuff, I mean that's basically

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Just Beatles being reskinned

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
With Green Day stuff, and it's

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
You know, it's basically like a track pack

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
But there is a lot of songs in the game

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
And, you know, just like

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Guitar Hero Metallica or Aerosmith

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Or something like that, I really don't give a crap about

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Green Day Rock Band

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
I guess even the same could have been said about Lego Rock Band

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Yet I purchased it anyway

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Although Lego Rock Band had a really good setlist

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
So I did like that, but

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
You know, I basically dumped the songs in the game

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
And then sold it back, so

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Whatever

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
I don't know, it'll be

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Interesting to see what happens

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Hopefully we'll, you know, obviously we're gonna know more

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
After E3

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Alright, well let's move on talking about some other

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Big, big news that landed this week

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
I just had everybody talking, and this is one of those things

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
That I don't think is gonna be news to you guys

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
But I wanna take some time out

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
To talk about it and get folks' thoughts here in studio

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
And those of you in chat room, and that is

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
EA's big announcement this week

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
At what exactly they mean

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
When they're talking about Project

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
$10, and the deal is

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
That Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Which is gonna be the first game that has this

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Enabled, it's coming out June 8th

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
So just a couple weeks here

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
The EA Sports games for PS3 and

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Xbox 360 will include a title

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Specific online pass

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
This will enable you to do

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Online services, features, and bonus

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Content, however if your code

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Has already been redeemed, meaning

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
You bought the game used, you

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Got it on Gamefly, or borrowed

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
It from a friend, then you

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Can get an additional online pass

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
For $10

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Of course you get a 7 day free

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Trial, so I guess if you rent it from

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Gamefly, you'll at least get that

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
It's gonna depend

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
What it is, depending on the game you have

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
But EA has mentioned that

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
It will be, it could include

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Meaning it probably will include

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Basic online multiplayer

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
That could also include group and league features

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Roster and playbook updates

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Downloads, of like

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
The user based stuff

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Tournament support, and so forth

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
So that's the direction

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
They're going in, where now if you

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Get this game used, you're gonna have to pay an extra

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
$10 if you're gonna want to enable it online

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Not the first time

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
We've really seen something like this

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Ever happen

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Right? Because you know, there's been

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Other games that have charged

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
You know, the

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Money for extra stuff, you know

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
If you wanna redeem the code, but it's interesting now

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
That you're talking about what I think a lot

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Of people have come to take for granted online

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
And that is basic, head to head

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Online matches. Dark

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Sakura, what do you think?

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
About the whole

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Project $10 thing, where you know

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Folks are now having to pay

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
$10 if they wanna play their sports

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Game online

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
That's

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
I understand

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
The logic behind it

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
What I think

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
It's not really gonna

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
I think

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
People expect for online play

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Just to be a given, you know?

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Yeah

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
So yeah, it kinda sucks

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
You feel like to some extent you're getting nickel and dimed

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
But it's tough because

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Like

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Well at least if you buy the game new

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
It's included, whatever

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
So if you're buying the game new, nothing really changes for you

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
I guess the difficult part for me

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Is that

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
I see the logic behind it

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
And it's hard for me to argue with it

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
Because yeah, game developers kinda lose a little money

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
On the used market, this is a way for them to make it back

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
Whatever

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
So

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Is that I already pay for Xbox Live

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
That's what I was about to say

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
You know, you pay for these services already

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
If they really

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Wanted it to be

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Something they could make more money on

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
They should just have like

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
I don't know

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
More download packs

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
They're not losing any money

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Either off of used sales

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
If you think about it

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
If I sell my game used to somebody

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Out there that's, you know, floating around

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
You know, it's not like

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
I copied my copy

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
And now there's two people playing

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
A game that you paid for once

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
It's just still one person playing

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
And so it is kind of

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
A dick move to do this

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
And you know what, the fact that they haven't dropped the price of their game

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
You know, it's still

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Kinda messed up

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
What's even dumber, the whole thing

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Was that GameStop was actually quoted

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
They were like, yeah we think this is a great idea

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
The quote you're thinking of

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
CEO Dan DeMatteo

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
I think says this

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
GameStop is excited to partner with such a

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Forward thinking publisher as Electronic Arts

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
This relationship allows us to

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Capitalize on our investments

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
To market and sell downloadable content

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Online as well as through our

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Network of stores worldwide

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Are you kissing or sucking over there?

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Here's the thing I think

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Is because they're probably

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Getting other back end deals for this stuff

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Like for example, if you look at Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
On GameStop's website

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
You get a $10 off future order

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
When you purchase Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
The $10 coupon code

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Will be emailed

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
When the order ships

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
So basically they're getting some sort of kickback money

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
That they're passing out to their customers to make it more

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Appealing to them to buy the new game

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Well yeah

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
And I want to say this too

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
DarkTetsuya in our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com says

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
So then the game itself will only cost

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
$59.99 new, right EA?

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Right? No

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
It's still going to cost $59.99

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Or let's just say $60

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Because unless you live in Oregon or one of those other states with no sales tax

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
You're going to pay $60 plus for it

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
The thing to keep in mind though

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
This won't affect you if you're buying your games new

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Because you get your free code

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
With the game and you know since it's new

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
That no one's used it, etc, etc

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
So you know that you're good

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
That means

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Isn't GameStop going to have to alter their policy now

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
That they're not going to take returns on these games anymore?

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
No they will take the returns on the games

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
It's just like you know

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Download content that would be coming with the game

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
You know they do this a lot now

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Where they're bundling in some DLC

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Like a coupon or something like that for

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
You know the first piece of DLC for free

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Or like some in-game hat or something like that

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
That you get for free

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Just to entice people to buy new games

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
But the thing for me

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
And you know I don't know

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Because I don't play sports games a lot

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
You know I wouldn't care

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
For me if I were to buy Tiger Woods

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
You know I wouldn't care

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
That I couldn't play online

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
I wouldn't buy Tiger Woods

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Well that too yeah

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
The only thing that bothers me about this

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Yeah I don't play a lot of these sports games

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Either so there's a lot of me that goes

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Nah nah nah doesn't affect me

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
But I do worry about the precedent

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
This is going to set for the future

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Because EA does make other games I do play

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
And granted I buy most of my games

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Used or I mean sorry new

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
So a lot of this won't affect me anyway

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
I do use Gamefly a little bit

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
But probably these are not the type of games

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
I would be getting

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
I worry about the precedent it sets

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
And the part that kind of irritates me

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Is that I feel like I'm being double dipped

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
I'm paying for Xbox Live

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
And now you want me to pay for this as well

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
If it's used that I have a problem with

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
It's weird like I will admit

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
I am weird this is weird

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
I don't have a problem with it on PlayStation

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
It's free there's not a lot for me to complain

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
About there you can't say like

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Oh well you know it's wrong for them

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
To charge you to use their servers and all

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
That stuff when

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
You know you're not really paying anything for

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
It in the first place and if you want to use these features

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Then you know I get it but I thought

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
That's what I was already paying for on Xbox Live

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
I understand that EA

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Uses their own servers and I understand

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
That it's kind of separate like that

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
But then does that mean that the restriction

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Will be removed where I no longer need an

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Xbox Live Gold account to play these online

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
If that's the case

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Then okay I guess

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
That it's the same as the PlayStation

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
And I can't really argue but otherwise I feel

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Like I'm being charged twice

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Do you seriously think that Microsoft is gonna

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Let an online service go without

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Going through Xbox Live?

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Yes Final Fantasy 11

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
That is different I think

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
When you're dealing with Square

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Well this is EA

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Okay well here's the thing

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
I don't think that EA is in

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Squares

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
They made the exception because Final Fantasy 11

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Was built to be on the PS2

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
And Microsoft wanted a piece of that

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
They wanted it they thought it was gonna be

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Probably the bigger thing than it really ended up being

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
What have you so they made an exception

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
But it just goes to show an exception

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Can be made

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
But I think that also

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
It was the fact that

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
They would be getting something that no one

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Would have ever expected to be on one of their systems

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
So

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
That was I think to get

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Really to get into the market share

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
They're going to get EA games

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Anyway

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
EA would be completely

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Just butt-tarded

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
To not put out a game on

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Xbox 360 I mean

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
There's it They're doing a lot of stuff

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
In this project $10 they have the way

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
That they changed the DLC the way

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
They kind of give it to you

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
In Mass Effect 2

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
You know this is not the first company

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
To try this they did the same thing with

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
SOCOM on the PSP to try to

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
You know

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Curtail people buying the used game

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
But

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
My problem is

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Basically like GameStop

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
You know their money is made and used product

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
And

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
They've been ballsy enough

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Before to make you know publishers

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Pay for shelf space and stuff like that

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Why can't they be ballsy now they go

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
We think this is a stupid idea

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
What's EA going to do

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Oh we're going to stop selling our games to your stores

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
They're not going to take a cut that big

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
I mean they may try to

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Make that bluff

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
But I mean if you call them on it they're not going to do anything

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
And even if they did

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
You know what I've seen Blockbuster

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Blockbuster or Movie Gallery or somebody

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
You know they stopped carrying

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
A certain vendor's

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Product for quite a while

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
And just basically saying

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Well if you don't want to play by our rules

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Then we're just going to stop carrying your product

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
And it hit them big time and they ended up

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Kind of settling with them

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Okay let me go check because there's lots and lots

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
And lots of chatty chat comments I want to read here

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
And most of it's coming from Bobby

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
He definitely has a lot to say on this

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
BobbyBlackWolf in chat

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
You're ripped off if you buy the game used for $55

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Then you'd have to pay $65

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
To get the game plus online

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
But buying the game used for $40

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
And buying the $10 online is still

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
More than buying the game new

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
And EA still gets a tiny bit of money

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
So you win, you got a cheaper game

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
EA wins, they get money to pay their SysAdmins

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
And GameStop wins because you bought a used game from them

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Okay I want to stop there because

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
I get what you're saying

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
And I'm like 95% with you

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
But the soccer moms

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Buying the games for these kids

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Lose because they don't understand

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
That there's a hidden $10 fee that's going to come with this

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
And you know what else

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Sucks too?

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
EA, they shut down their servers after some time

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
So you paid for the money

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
You paid the extra money to play this game online

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
And then it's not there

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
If all of that is disclosed in the agreement

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
I'm borderline comfortable with it

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
And then

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
There's kind of like a little bit of back and forth

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Between BlackWolf and ToaGak

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
And some stuff here

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
BlackWolf says Phantasy Star Online also doesn't

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Require a gold subscription

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Any game that has it's own monthly fee

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Does not require the Xbox Live gold

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
And ToaGak was trying to recall

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
A game that required them both

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Couldn't think of one and Bobby says

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Oh you can't remember haha

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Well this $10 is not a monthly fee though

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
It's just a one time fee

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
To do the game for the duration

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
And you do get the 70 trials

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
So you can try it out

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
If the online is really not something that you care for

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Then you don't have to do it

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
The other thing I was thinking of

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
And I'm sure that they've thought of this

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
And they don't have SystemLink in the game anymore

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
You can use tunneling services

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
To actually play online with other people

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
So you can use that

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
It basically acts like

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
It's a SystemLink game but you're playing it over

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
The internet like you did with the GameCube

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
And stuff like that with Mario Kart

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Again, I don't know

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
I'm just a little worried like

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
What happens next

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Like if this ends up being acceptable

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Then what happens next

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
You know

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
They get you for $10 here

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
And you know, I don't know

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
They're not losing money left and right either

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
I mean this kind of stuff

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
And it's an experiment for them

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
They're just saying, huh, what can we get away with

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
It's just like the $15 map packs

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
For Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
What can we get away with

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
$15, let's see if people buy this

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Oh, people are buying this like crazy

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Let's release another map pack for $15

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
I mean it's just

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
If people are going to buy this stuff left and right

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
And just not even think about it

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
There's going to be a lot of people that decide

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Hey, we're going to buy this game used

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Better off if you really want to get this game cheaper

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Don't buy it used

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Just wait for the drop in price and buy it new

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
And I guess

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
The moral of the story, if you will

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Is so we can kind of move on with some other news

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
If you don't like it, don't buy it

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Don't say you're going to

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Don't be one of those left for dead

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Two petitioners

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
That sign the petition against the game

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
And then are caught on Steam playing the game

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
The day it comes out

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
If you are really against this

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Don't buy it and mean it

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
How about

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Something a little bit more

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Possibly encouraging

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Or maybe face palming

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Maybe a little bit

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Walmart

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Actually is

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Going to be back in the

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Used game

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Business

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
They're going to be working with Game Trade

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
A startup services provider

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
With a lease to test

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Their little game trade stores

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
In different Walmart places

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
There's only about five of them

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
But it's going to be previously owned games

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Movies

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Hardware

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Basically you get store credit or cash

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
So yeah

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
They're going to be

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
I guess what GameStop was

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
For used games

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Only Walmart

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Well they didn't really get out of

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
The used game market

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
The company going under that was doing their kiosk

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Kind of

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
They didn't have a choice

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
So they're kind of trying the same thing again

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
I don't think they launched it full

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Steam

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
While that company was working with them

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
DVD Play

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
I don't remember ever seeing used games at Walmart

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
They were in test locations

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Test locations of a new company

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
E-Play is what it was

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
They were doing it with Best Buy

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
And they went out of business

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
So now this new company

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Coming out trying to do the same thing

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
We'll see what happens there

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
It's a tough market to compete in

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
But granted

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Used games, there's not a lot of kiosks

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Out there for that stuff

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
It could catch on

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
It might be neat

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
I just worry about those things

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
There's too many ways to exploit them

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
I don't know

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
With competitions dwindling

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
It's nice to see

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
I guess GameStop is going to have a little competitor

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Because competition is good

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Especially when news like this comes out

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
And there might be a $10 hidden surcharge

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
On your used games

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
It's nice that

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
There's going to be a little competition there

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
But I just don't think I like that

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
That competition is Walmart

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Well, I mean

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Walmart does everything else

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Do we really need them in this too?

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
You know, money gets tight

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
And you need to buy dinner

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
You can always trade in your game

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
And buy dinner with the coupon

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
Or the store credit that you get

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
That's always good

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Hard to argue with that, okay

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
At least there's that option

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
But as far as

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
As far as trading in stuff

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
I don't know

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Really what they need

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Out there is a website

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
And this would be pretty impossible to get

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
GameStop to be sharing what their trading prices are

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
But if there was a website to

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Compare trading prices based on

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Title per these different places

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
That would be kind of cool

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
But once again, they're not going to give that information out

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
No, I don't think they're going to give that out either

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
You know, and

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
The other kind of little worry I have

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Is that there's going to be a lot of Walmart employees

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
That are going to get taken advantage of

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Because, you know, one thing about GameStop

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Is that most, and it really depends on

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Which one you're going to, but most of them

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Are going to hire people that are at least somewhat game savvy

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Again, depends on the store

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
But I would worry that a place like Walmart

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Isn't going to really care

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
And there's going to be a lot of people to get taken advantage of

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
And buy back games that are

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
All scratchy

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Yucky and codes are used

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Here's the problem though, Rob, with that

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
It's a kiosk

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
It's a machine

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
How does the machine know what games are in good condition and what aren't

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
It tries to read them

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
It reads this

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
It checks them

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
To see if they're able to be read

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
The problem is, though

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
You could trick the machine by using

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Some sort of burn disk or something like that

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
And it might help you

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Tell the difference between it

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Of course, then you have your credit card

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
But, once again, it's also easy

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
To buy a, you know

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
A prepaid credit card

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
And you can do the same thing

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Put whatever, you know, person's name

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Social on there that you want

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
And do it and you can get away with the money

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
You should be telling people how to do this on the show

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
I'm just saying, hey, I think, you know

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
I work out the flaws

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
If you thought of it, somebody a little more shady

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Has definitely already thought of it

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
So, it, I mean, but

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Then again, not everybody's thinking that way

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
So, you could probably

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Factor that in

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
But, um

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
It'll be interesting to see

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Hey, who thought, you know, renting DVDs from a kiosk

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Was going to take off

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Not a lot of people did

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Still not going to make me stop shopping at Target

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Over Walmart

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
But, hey, you know what, though

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
If it takes off at Walmart, who says that Target's not going to do it

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
And, you know, if this company is anything like

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
ePlay was, they could easily have

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
The same damn kiosk

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
It just, you know, branded with the Target stuff

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
And it would be the same service right there

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
And they could double dip, basically, in the market

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
And there's nothing really stopping them from doing that

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Unless they sign some sort of weird contract for it

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Which they very well might have

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Very true

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
We'll see what happens

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Um, so there's some rumors now regarding

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
When, uh, the PlayStation Move

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
And Natal's going to be launched

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Um, the rumor is that

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
PlayStation Move is supposed to launch in September

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
This is coming from Jason Bradbury

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
The host of Britain's

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
The Gadget Show

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Apparently, he's proclaiming

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
That the PlayStation Move controller

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Will take, uh, be released

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
In September

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
On his Twitter account

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Another thing I was meaning to say

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
September for PlayStation Move, I'm sure of it

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Can't say why, just September 2010

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
I

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Well, I mean, if I was a betting man

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
That's a pretty good bet

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
It's gonna be this fall, okay

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
You know it's fall

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
And you know it's before Black Friday

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
It must, must, must be before Black Friday

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
So what does that really leave?

55:43.000 --> 55:47.000
October, November, and maybe September

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Here's how you know when

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Uh, the PlayStation Move is scheduled

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
To come out, is you look at the titles that are

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Supporting the PlayStation Move and where they're

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Sitting as far as releases go

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
And everything that I've seen so far is pointing

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
To November, which makes sense because that's when

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
They seem to launch new consoles and whatnot

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Um, so I would be betting

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
November

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
So, we'll see

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
So you are going to go against the British guy

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
From Gadgets or whatever

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
I don't know who the fuck Jason Bradbury is

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
From the Gadgets show

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Good for you, you think something

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
I think you should challenge Jason Bradbury

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
To a throwdown

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
A throwdown?

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
A hoedown throwdown

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Whatever, I could be like Michael Patcher

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
And say random shit, and if I'm right

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
I'm a genius, if I'm wrong, no one will remember

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
So, whatever

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
I'm an analyst!

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
We should just start calling you an analyst

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
We need to have a segment on the show, analyst Loki

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
No, but I'm serious

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Wait

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
I'm serious though, like look at

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Look at IPET

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
IPET is supporting the Playstation move

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
And that's supposed to be coming out in the fall

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Lord of the Rings, Eragon's Quest

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Whatever is supposed to be coming out in the fall

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
As well, because that's now supporting

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
The move on the Playstation 3

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Um

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
LittleBigPlanet 2 will probably be coming out

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Like this fall, I'm guessing

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
It's all going to be around the same time

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Um

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
I just, I don't know about September

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
I guess it could be September

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
If you think about it, because

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
They are starting to support games now

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
With the Playstation move stuff

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
So, you know, publishers have access to it

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
And I guess they could do that

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
But I would be more willing to bet it's going to be

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Closer to Christmas

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Just to catch in on that holiday buying madness

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
You know, we'll see

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Now see, where's that story going to be on all the

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Game blogs tomorrow, that

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
World renowned, years long

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Running, game analist, Loki

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Has predicted on

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Some little

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Crappy web show

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Just like this other thing

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
The gadget show or whatever

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
That move is coming out in November

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
He is sure of it, folks

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
He is sure of it

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Let me just put it this way, okay

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
This goes, you know, both against me and against him

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Just because we're hosts of a show

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Doesn't mean we know what we're talking about

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
I mean, so, you know

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Just because he hosts a TV show

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Does not mean he knows exactly when

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
The Playstation move is coming out

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
It's a good guess, fourth quarter, duh

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
It's going to be coming out fourth quarter, so

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Whenever that is, if it's September, great

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
It'll be nice and early

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
But, you know, from what I've seen

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Their major Sony releases

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Have either been in November or October

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
October like last year, for example

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Because he had Uncharted 2

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Um

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
God, there was other Sony titles last year

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
But LittleBigPlanet was also

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
In October as well

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Although Resistance 2, I believe

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Was in

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
November, so

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
It's all around that same time

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
They have release schedules

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
What about Natal, then?

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Okay, Project Natal

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
What does our analysts think about Project Natal?

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
They're saying that it's going to be releasing

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
In October

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
This is according to

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
Microsoft's

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Saudi vendor

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
He's not even really working for

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Microsoft

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Although they

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Quote him as working with Microsoft

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Apparently G4 has said that

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Said Bilal

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Tariq

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
There's a source you can trust

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Is not a Microsoft employee

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
He is a vendor employed through a

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Third party company on behalf of Microsoft

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
A subsidiary in

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Saudi Arabia

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
And uh

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Pardon me, pardon me. Can I do just a quick

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
This is a very important poll

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
We need to do in

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Chat, okay? And I realize

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Our audience is biased

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
But I still think this is a question worth asking

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
So quick poll in chat

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Who do you trust more?

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
G4

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
Or

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Analist Loki

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Or Loki

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Ready go

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Well I agree, I don't think he's an employee

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
They're just saying

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
That they're reporting that he's not an employee

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Okay, but he was the one

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Apparently that was saying that

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
We will be in position to confirm the day after

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
E3, which is in June

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
But definitely it's going to be October 2010

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
And we will have it in Saudi Arabia

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
For sure

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
I don't think it's going to be definitely in

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
October

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
And once again it's because all the major

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Stuff that's been released

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Is usually around that November time

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Now granted they could do

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
The fall update early, it's going to be

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Timed with the fall update basically

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
You're going to have the fall update slightly

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Before

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
This is launched, just like

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
When they did the avatars, the new

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Xbox experience, whatever

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
They had

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Their new scenic game come out slightly

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Before

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
This new update came out

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
So you kind of look at what the games are

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
What games are supporting Natal and stuff

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
And what their release schedule is going to be like

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
And you can kind of guess when

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Natal is going to come out

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
And if at E3

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
They're going to be showing off Gears of War 3

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Which obviously is not coming out until next year I guess

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
But maybe another

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Fourth quarter title is going to be really big

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
I'm guessing it's going to be

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Around the November timeframe

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
September would be too early

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
I mean they're saying in October

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
So the end of October would sound

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Right

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Let's go to the results of our quick poll chat

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
And our chatroom, chat.ornsonshooter.com

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Who do you trust more, G4 or Loki?

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
We have Loki, Natalist Loki

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
I trust Bananaman, Loki for sure

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Homer Simpson, Natalist Loki

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Natalist Loki

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
I trust the bird because the bird is the word

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Well everybody said

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
About the bird

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Yeah, stop it

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Let's see

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Loki

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
At least he mentions games I work on

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
We all trust Loki because we all love Secret Club

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Natalist Loki over anything

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Although anything is better than G4

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I don't know, G4 has hotness

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
G4 has Ninja Challenge

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
That is a good point

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
G4 does have Ninja Challenge

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Loki, not the OLR, the Norse god

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
I've trusted Loki with my life before

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Or budget at least

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
And there you go

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
I'd be willing to bet that we'll find out

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Probably before it's released

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
I mean, well

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Obviously we're going to find out before it's released

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
But we were going to find out before

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
They announce it, let me put it that way

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Alright

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Well, do you think you know

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
A catchphrase that ought to be

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
In the next NBA Jam

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
If you have the next Boomshakalaka

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
If you know

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Boomshakalaka, he's on fire

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
If you have the next

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Catchphrase for NBA Jam

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
They want to know

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
EA Sports has come out

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Oh, this means you'll have to pay $10 to play it online

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
EA Sports has come out and said

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
That they're doing

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
This whole little contest about

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
The next catchphrase in NBA Jam

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Of course it's taking place on Facebook

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Go to facebook.com slash NBA Jam

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
And you can submit your entries

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Up until May 19th

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
9am pacific time

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
That doesn't give you much time

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
On the top 64 entries

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
And the one with the highest votes

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Will be immortalized in

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
The game

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Now they say the entries must be

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Associated with one of the following actions

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
In the game

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Dunks, assists, alley oops

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Blocks, 3 point shots

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
2 point field goal

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
On fire shots, steals

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Shot clock violations, rebounds

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Miss shots

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Catchphrases should avoid a reference to specific

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
NBA players and they must not contain

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Pornography, illicit content and must be

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Appropriate for audiences 13 years of age

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
I listened to the

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Ad for that

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Dan played it the other day, I was like

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Dude, it's the guy

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
AlphaCananagram suggests

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
And Boom Goes the Dynamite

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
That's a great

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
YouTube clip by the way, if you've never seen it

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
I think that should be in the game

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Boom Goes the Dynamite

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
I don't know, I'm thinking that maybe they could

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
You know, do something with

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
The bird

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
No, no

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
SSJ100Matt

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Saying that we should have an OLR catchphrase

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
In it, I don't know, what OLR catchphrase

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Would lend itself to basketball

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I don't know, like ferret

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
That doesn't really work, exterminate

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Can you really, I mean that's really a Doctor Who

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Thing that we just kind of stole

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
What other OLR catchphrases do we have?

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
I don't know, do we have other catchphrases?

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Your mom

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
There's Rob Rob Rob Rob What

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
I don't know

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
I don't think that'll do it

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Some other folks are saying

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
That they should try to sneak in an

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
OLR reference into the catchphrases

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
I really don't know what that

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
OLR catchphrase would be

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Ferret

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Duck Island, okay

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Duck Island might work

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
He made that shot all the way from

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Duck Island

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
They'd be like, what?

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
He's not coming in from Duck Island

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
No, how about no

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
It's just J100 Matt

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Says friend your butt

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
He'll friend your butt

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Dunk

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
No, that won't work either

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Cause that might not be appropriate for audiences

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Under 13, alright

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Maybe that'll be a future-less list, I don't know

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Although the contest will be over by then, we'll see

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Look at him

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Paddle those balls

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
No

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
That ain't appropriate

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
But it did make me laugh

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
It did make me laugh

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Alright

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Let's move on with some more news

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
And of course release dates coming up

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
And the classic game of the week at some point tonight

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Well how about something that isn't crappy

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
There's a Castlevania

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
game coming out on the iPhone, Rob

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
OMG what?

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Yeah

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
It's a

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Encore of the night

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Which is really

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
It's gonna be hard to control, right

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Puzzle game

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
It's like

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
When I looked at it, I was like

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Oh, it's Puzzle Fighter and Puzzle Quest

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
So

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Yeah, so basically the little screen capture on here

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
is Alucard playing against one of the fish guys

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Who hangs out in Dracula's basement

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
But it could be fun

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
I think I'm gonna try it out, you know

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
But it also looks like it's timed

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Each of your little matches is timed

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Because there's an hourglass

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
But why can't they just

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Or maybe when the timer runs out

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Something bad happens

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Like the fish guy

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Takes a big poop or something, I don't know

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
And eats your face

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
And poops your face

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Yes

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
It could be cool

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
I

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
I guess

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
I like puzzle games, I like Castlevania

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
It's all in the price

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
It's all in the price

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
By the way, some more suggestions for the NBA Jam

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Thing from our chat, and I gotta say this is my favorite

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
So far from SSG100 Matt

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
D-d-d-d-dongle

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
That's a good one

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
That's a good one

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
I might be saying this wrong

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Shez-ro

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Shez-ro

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Shez-ro says double down

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
You know, like in reference to Loki's

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Least favorite KFC food

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Alright, let's move on to some release dates

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
We're gonna travel around the world and look at some

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Release dates, Loki

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
We're gonna look at some release dates

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
No, it doesn't really work for

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
NBA Jam

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
No, it doesn't

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Yeah, actually some good stuff coming up this week

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Kind of the

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Big push for

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Games until

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Memorial Day, woo

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
July, July is like that

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
But this week though we have SplitSecond coming out on

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Highly recommend picking that up, it's actually pretty awesome

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Oh, and also on PC apparently

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Shrek Forever After

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
for the little tykes, of course the new

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Tie-in game with that movie that

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Thankfully is done

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
No more Shrek movies, thank you

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
They'll be coming out on Playstation 3

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Xbox 360

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Wii, DS, and PSP

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Prince of Persia

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
The Forgotten Sands

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Making its way out on Playstation 3, Xbox 360

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Wii and DS and PSP

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
The PSP version

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Is supposed to be 2D and then they're also

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Re-releasing Prince of Persia

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Sands of Time on Playstation 2

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
In case you haven't picked that up and feel

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Festive with the movie coming out and everything

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
The game I'm

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Definitely gonna be playing

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
A lot this week, Red Dead Redemption

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Coming out on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
This week

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
City Builder

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Coming out on the Wii until the Forgotten

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
About game that no one will be picking up

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Attack of the Movies

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
3D, it's a parody

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Of a bunch of movies including Terminator

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
And you know

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Alien, Mummy

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
It's got 3D glasses and you can play

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
It is an on-rails

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Shooter game and what makes it

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Even more bizarre is it's coming out on

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
360 as well, how the fuck is that

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Gonna work

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
With the analog sticks I guess

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Horrible decision

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
And then of course Alan Wake making its way

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Out on Xbox 360

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
And they're also doing the limited edition

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
For that this week as well

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
And that's

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Basically it

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
It's just J100 Matt in our chat room

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
That play was better than a DS

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Master email

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Oh I'm sorry, how did I miss this

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
I must have scrolled too quickly

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Imagine Animal Doctor Care Center on DS

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
And then a better game

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Blue Dragon Awaken Shadows

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Come out on DS as well

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Blue Dragon

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
I got a good one

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
He's on, FIRED

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Rob

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Rob

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Rob

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
That's the slow Rob

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
And of course one week from today

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Super Mario Galaxy 2

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Going to Japan and looking at the release dates

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
On the Xbox 360, Lost Planet 2

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Senko no Ronde Duo

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Comes out on the Xbox 360 as well

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
That is

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
An updated version of an old game

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
That's now on the Xbox 360

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
New graphics and everything

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Tropico 3 also, again these are Japanese

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Release dates and the Xbox 360 is getting

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
A whole little bundle for Lost Planet 2

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
There you go

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Going over to the Playstation 3 and looking at

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
What's coming out there

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Another Lost Planet 2

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
The port for the PS3 is coming out there

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
World Soccer winning 11 2010

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Aoki Samurai no Chosen

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Comes out there as well

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
There's also a brand new

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Hori Pad if you want to check that out

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
If you are into the Japanese peripherals

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
You can look at that

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
On the Nintendo Wii this week, not a lot

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
World Soccer winning 11 2010 comes out this week

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Next week, just so you know, is the Japanese

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Release of Red Steel 2

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
They don't have that game yet

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
On the Playstation 2

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Tier Nanog is getting a price reduction

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Coming out, there's also a port of World Soccer

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Winning 11 2010 and a few games

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
In the Lucien Bees series

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
There's Evil Violet and Justice Yellow

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
So I'm guessing those are like Pokemon

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
E types of games

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
On the Nintendo DS, Captain Tsubasa

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Gekitou no Kiseki

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Comes out this week

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
That is a soccer type of game

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
I guess with all the winning 11, the DS wants in on the action

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
It's also a manga

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Different game, oh is it, is it a soccer manga type of thing?

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Yeah

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
And then coming out on the PSP

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Heganni no Rekinjutsushi

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Full Metal Alchemist

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Yakuzoku no Hiei

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Yes, it's a Full Metal Alchemist game

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
On the PSP

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
As to what type of game it is

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
I think you actually kind of get to play

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
As Ed and Al

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
You get to

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
I don't know if it's like a

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Kind of like a little 3D adventure game

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
With a lot of cut scenes and dialogue

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
So it's a

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
I think it'll do Full Metal Alchemist fans

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Some justice there, so check that out

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
On the PSP this week in Japan

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Those are Japanese release dates

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
In the UK

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
We have on the 18th Dragon Age

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Origins, Darkspawn Chronicles

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
On the 21st

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Mud Nation Racers, Morphex

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Prince of Persia, The Forgotten Sands

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
All Star Karate

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Red Dead Redemption

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
and Rooms the Main Building

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Oh yeah, and Split Second Velocity

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Busy week

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Yep

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Alright

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
More gaming news and then the classic game of the week

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Coming right up and

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Dark Sakura, I'm not going to spoil what the game is

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
This week, but she just picked a game where she's like

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Yeah, pretty much everyone

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Says this is a classic

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
So we'll get to that in a little bit

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
To put it a little bit more

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
It's a game that

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Dan and I played a lot of when we first

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Got together

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
It has sentimental value

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Alright, we'll get to that in just a moment, Loki

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Apparently, you know, we kind of alluded to this

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
A little bit last week when we were talking about

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Mega Man Universe

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
The trademark that was filed by Capcom

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Recently

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Well, it's been announced that

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Capcom is working on an MMO

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Called Mega Man Online

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
And according to

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
GameSpot, they're saying it's being

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
co-developed by Korea's

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
NeoWiz Games

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
They're responsible for EA Sports

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
FIFA Online

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
And

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Possibly

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Possibly might be related to the Mega Man

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Universe game

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Well, maybe it's

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Could be different names, different regions

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Yeah

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
You never know

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
I don't know

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
That's kind of neat

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
I don't know what they're really going to do for a Mega Man Online game

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
But it'll be pretty awesome, I'm sure

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
I'm going to kind of approach this with a big

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Huh

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
It's just kind of like

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
How would a Mega Man Online game

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Work?

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
But then I think about Mega Man Legends

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
And I'm like, huh

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
This could be interesting

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
I'm not sure how yet

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Or imagine if you're not really playing as Mega Man

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
But imagine if you got to be like your own

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Robot Master boss

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
That'd be kind of rad, actually

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
I don't know, there's just

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Things that make you go hmm

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
There's definitely a big hmm factor with this

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
I don't know, I don't know what to think

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
I'll need to see screenshots or something

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Do you think you'll get to see more of this at E3?

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
It might be a little early, but

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
That'd be kind of neat if they announced something

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Very cool

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Alright, well we'll see what happens

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
With Mega Man Online

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
DarkSakura, do you like the idea

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Of Mega Man going online, or is it

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Enough of the freaking MMOs already?

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
It's a good idea

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Yay for whoever wants to play it

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Good for them

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Ask Star Trek Online, dude

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Even if you got to be a Robot Master boss

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
There's no Robot Master boss you'd want to be

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Well

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
No

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Alright

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
It's Sakura Woman

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Loki could finally have Pizza Man

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
For reals

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
That reference is about 5 years old on this show

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Pizza Man

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
I think there's a clip of that

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Let me tell you how old that reference is

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
There's a clip of that on our

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
MySpace

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Oh, we were talking about the Mega Man 2

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Sound effect thing

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Yeah, there you go, you got it

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Alright, one more story for you guys

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
We were talking about music games a little bit earlier

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
In the show, it's very interesting

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Because apparently there are rumors

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
If you want to believe this Swedish retailer

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Webhallen

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
They are believing that a Pearl Jam

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Rock band is in the

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Works

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Apparently some box art has leaked out

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Although this could be one of those mock ups

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
To get you to pre-order things

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
MTV is saying up and down

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
They have not announced anything besides

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Green Day Rock Band and Rock Band 3

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
But they are quick to say

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
We have a great relationship with Pearl Jam

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
And hope to have many of their more awesome music in the game

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
In the future

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Hmm

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Here's where I have a problem with this right now

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
They've

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Given it a Peggy rating on the box art

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
This early

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
The fact that they haven't even announced the game yet

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
It would not have a rating

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
It would be rating pending

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Very good point

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
It's fake

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Wishful thinking basically

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
I mean, I don't know

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
I kind of go, okay, yeah, I could see Pearl Jam

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Getting their own rock band

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
We've talked about this on the show before

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
There's only certain bands that can have a rock band

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Not every band

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Is worthy of having a rock band game

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Dedicated to them, but Pearl Jam, okay

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
There was a survey that came out

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
That was asking people what dedicated rock band

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Games would you like to see, which artists

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Would you want to see have their game

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
And Pearl Jam was on the list

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
So I think it's a little bit wishful thinking

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
It's kind of like how

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
With, you know, even if you look at GameStop's

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Website and stuff like that

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
There's a bunch of listings for games

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Like pilot wings for the Wii and stuff like that

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Stuff that doesn't exist

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
That they're taking pre-orders on

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Just in case, you know

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
That kind of stuff

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
That rock band ABBA, that's the one I want

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
By the way, apparently

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Yeah, they are doing

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
That little test right now

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
But there's also some news about how well these games

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Are selling

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
The NPD group is saying that Guitar Hero Van Halen

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Only sold 94,000 copies

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Which kind of makes it a poop

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
However, it's hard to say

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Does that count the free ones that went out?

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Because that sort of would

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Kind of screw those numbers, wouldn't it?

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
It's copies sold

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
So I would imagine, yes it does

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Well to put it in perspective, Guitar Hero Aerosmith

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Sold 2.7 million copies

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Guitar Hero Metallica

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Sold 1 million copies

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Beetle Rock Band, 1.2 million copies

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Guitar Hero Aerosmith

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Sold twice as many

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
As Beetle's rock band

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Well, think about it though, Guitar Hero Aerosmith

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Was first, it was the first

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Kind of, you know

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
One group exclusive

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Game that came out, and it seems like the numbers

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Have slowly gone down since then

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
And the Van Halen just kind of pooped

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
You know, it didn't do much, but it's hard to say

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Because again, they were given that away for free

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Can you really trust that number? I don't know

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
It'll be very interesting to see how the

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Guitar Hero Green Day sells

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
You know what's also not accounted for in here

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
I'm sorry, did I say Guitar Hero Green Day?

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
I meant Rock Band Green Day

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
What's also not accounted for in here is the

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
ACDC Rock Band game that came out

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
I don't see that in here anywhere

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
It was like a live ACDC game, it was exclusive to

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Walmart for a little while, but then it wasn't

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
I don't see numbers for that anywhere in here

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Because there's no numbers for that

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Probably, and just for reference

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
On the Peggy website

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
There is no listing for that new Rock Band game

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
If it had a rating, it would be listed on there

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
See? Analist Loki

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Squelching the rumors

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Right here at Orange Lounge Radio

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Alright

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Just out of curiosity though, if they did

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Do a band based game

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
A one band game, is there any band you'd want to see?

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
No

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
No

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Dark Soccer, any bands you think are deserving of their full

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Rock Band game?

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Electric Light Orchestra!

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Sorry, I've been on an ELO kick lately

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
ABBA Rock Band, you think I'm kidding?

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Radiohead Rock Band

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
I would be down with a Radiohead Rock Band actually

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
But I just don't see Radiohead as the type of band

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
That would want to be a part of that

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
And you know

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
I know they said, oh well on the Rock Band Network

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
It could happen

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
I would like to see some drum based tracks

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Come out on Rock Band

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Like, you know, get some Pendulum in there

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Something like that

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
I mean that would be pretty cool

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
With some guitar stuff in there

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
I guess it would be really difficult to do on drums

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
But it would be neat to see

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
He's getting a lot of comments tonight

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
But he's saying some good stuff

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Well that was a track pack

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
It wasn't actually a separate game

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
It wasn't listed as a separate game, it was a track pack

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Yes but Bobby, technically you can play it by itself

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Therefore it is kind of a separate game

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
I get what he's saying though

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
It's in the vein of those country packs

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
And the things they sold individually

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
But yeah, I thought of it as a separate game

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Could you buy the ACDC stuff?

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
You can buy it and play it by itself

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
I didn't think you could buy it from within Rock Band

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
No, you can't buy it within Rock Band

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
You can buy the track pack

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
You can buy it by itself or dump it into your game

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Donovan's suggesting Village People Rock Band

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Blackwolf again says

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
I'd like to see Rush or U2

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Funny T-Man says

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Golden Girls Rock Band

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
There you go

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
It could be the Betty White version of

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Thank You for Being a Friend from Saturday Night Live a couple weeks ago

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Anyhow, let's get into

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Speaking of old classics

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Because when doesn't the Golden Girls seem to come up on this show lately?

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Old classics!

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Because I want to be Betty White when I grow up

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Dark Soccer likes to dig through the gaming vault

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
And find a game that she says

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Hey, hey, listen

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Hey, listen

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
You kids ought to be playing this game

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
It's the classic video game of the week

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
And I think though this week

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
She's managed to pick a game that

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Most people have played

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
But if you haven't

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
What the hell? Seriously

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Where the hell have you been?

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Let's get to it

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Super Mario 64

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Super Mario 64

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Yeah, this

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
I have to say

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
This is one of my favorite ever

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Nintendo 64 games

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Probably one of my favorite

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
It's up there in my list of favorites

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
It was, you know

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
The first real dive

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Into 3D for Mario

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
And it was one of those games

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
That controller just seemed to be made for

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
But I love the music

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Can you turn it up for a minute?

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
I love the early level

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
I also love that you can go up to

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
A sleeping piranha plant

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
And punch him in the face

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Cause look, he's about to do it here too

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
But that was like, there were just so many

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Little fun things, you know, you could do the wall jump

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
You could also glitch the game hardcore

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
And just beat it right from the very get go

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
If you were really good at the wall jump

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
See, he punched the piranha plant in the face

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Sure did, in the face

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Mario's hardcore like that

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
He's a thug

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
At any rate

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
The game starts off

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
At Princess Peach's castle

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
And she writes him a letter

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
And says, I baked you a cake

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Even though I'm a princess and have servants

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
To do it for me

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
I think it was also the first game in the US

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Where we got her name as being Peach

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
If you think about it though, she is a princess

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
She could take credit for what her servants did

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
And their, you know

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
I baked this for you

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
By me, I mean I own these servants that made it for you

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
I want to say she was actually Peach

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
In Mario 3

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
I think, well I know Mario Kart

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Was on Super Nintendo and that was before this

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
I'm pretty sure Mario 3 called her Peach

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
At any rate

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
You go through

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
The entire game

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
And it's kind of neat because

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Not only is it

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
The different levels you have to go through

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
You have 8 different ways of going through

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
A lot of these levels

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
You have to beat them in different ways

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
So it was very innovative

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
And a good way to reuse

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Levels in different means

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
And that theme kept coming back in later

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
3D Mario games

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Like in Sunshine and I think in Galaxy

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
You had different ways of beating the levels

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
And that was pretty cool

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
You could get different things like the Metal Cap

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Where you turn like into

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Shiney crue Mario

01:23:51.000 --> 01:24:04.040
Like bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang

01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:06.000
Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
There. How's that

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Yes

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
And you can find a pink Bob-omb Buddy

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Wooo. He's pink

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:21.120
and there were you also had coins that you used for your life so and you know

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:28.100
you could also you know there was like I said the wall jump you could do a triple

01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:34.040
jump you can flip you can do all kinds of extra stuff but it actually started

01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:41.960
off as Super Mario FX when Miyamoto is working on Star Fox so it was originally

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:49.280
gonna be a Super FX game for the SNES but it couldn't quite reach what he

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:54.480
wanted to do so basically he I think I think he pulled an avatar on this dusted

01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:57.560
it off out of a drawer decided oh technologists caught up let's do it and

01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:04.520
then I love the sliding levels too you just fell down a hole though and you

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:10.600
you can move the camera around and it does have a fairly set path you can go

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:16.200
but you can just run around and do stuff and explore and even if you're like

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:19.360
trying to beat a certain way if like if you're doing a certain mission that has

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:22.320
you beat the level a certain way you can actually do it the other way you know if

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:32.760
you just decide to do that but it's it's really just you know pretty cool and

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:37.400
also the music and it was done by Koji Kondo who is one of my personal heroes

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:41.960
and it was one of the first ones that had Charles Martinet to do the voice

01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:51.080
he's so cool he's so cool he was cool to meet you know so yeah it's I think in

01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:57.760
that list of one of you know best games ever and dude punching a piranha plant

01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:03.360
in the face you know grabbing Koop you know Bowser by the tail and swinging

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:06.680
them around and throwing them off a building you know Mario turned into a

01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:11.720
thug in this game and also if you want to see something incredibly fun go on

01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:21.000
YouTube and just watch speed runs but now the the really interesting thing

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:30.920
with this game for me is that Dan and I we spent because he had a Nintendo 64

01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:34.080
we know we don't we didn't actually have nearly the collection that we do now

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:38.680
when we first moved in together we had maybe about 20 video game systems then

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:43.960
maybe 15 something like that and you know I moved out here with like my Super

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:49.360
Nintendo and stuff but he had a Nintendo 64 and we just played the stew out of

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:56.160
this game and you know we put the rumble pack and we had a lot of fun it was just

01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:02.320
really really cool and I actually have the Nintendo DS one it's actually a

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:07.360
little harder to play but you know you place Yoshi Luigi and Wario and it looks

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:11.960
a little bit better and it's got minigames and multiplayer mode and it's

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:20.000
pretty good there is there was a direct sequel plan for the Nintendo 64 double D

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:28.800
and Miyamoto it started at 97 and it was gonna be released in 99 but because the

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:36.880
64 double D didn't make it my husband just decided to pop his head in the door

01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:39.160
and said that the movie he was watching was awesome what movie were they

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:45.480
watching kick-ass no kick-ass good times but because 64 double D pretty much

01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:54.840
flopped it we basically got Super Mario sunshine on the Gamecube and then we got

01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:58.960
Super Mario Galaxy of course we're getting into the Super Mario Galaxy so

01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:05.600
this game has a special place in my heart that and when you win the game

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:14.800
peach makes you a cake like she promised good for her all right well there it is

01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:20.400
your classic game of the week Super Mario 64 now I want to give a quick

01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:24.480
counter opinion this is not my favorite Mario game in the series I did not like

01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:28.440
the transition to 3d very much I understand a lot of people are all

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:31.920
excited about it but I don't know I I had a really hard time with this game

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:36.840
after the awesomeness that were the Super Nintendo Mario games I don't know

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:42.160
the switch to 3d never felt right for me but oddly enough I was okay with Mario

01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:48.400
Sunshine I know that makes me weird I'm all sorts of weird but whatever all

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:53.520
right anyhow our weirdo Rob I am weird it's fine it's fine I'm ideal with it

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:57.960
okay anyhow let's go ahead and take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio we got

01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:38.000
lost count I was talking about that earlier in the show 367th episode of our

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:44.280
show as we do every week at all games radio www.allgames.com live here on

01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:48.320
Sunday nights we've talked about a lot of different news in part 8 tonight

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:52.200
talking about you know EA's controversial new $10 thing talking

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:55.440
about used games at Walmart and our gaming weeks were quite long tonight

01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:59.440
everybody's doing something Dark Sakura went to Pinagogo and I was playing 3d

01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:02.960
game heroes and look you still playing Grand Theft Auto that's all right good

01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:07.280
times all right speaking of Loki he's gonna start off some quick news topics

01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:10.160
before we get back into some longer discussion so quick quick what's on your

01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:15.840
mind tonight Loki ah yes apparently there is another dance game coming to

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:20.680
the Wii and funny enough this actually has a tie back into one of the shows

01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:27.400
that I wasn't a part of but Rob had hosted while back and it's a kids bop

01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:32.280
dance party the video game you might ask how did that even you know the fuck did

01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:35.520
that come up on olr I don't even remember it wasn't on olr it was on

01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:40.840
vanilla sky because I wanted to spin off shows yeah oh oh god yes oh yeah we had

01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:45.440
the kids bop thing yes the kids bop trivia game where if you got the trivia

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:49.920
question wrong the volume of this song that was my favorite games we ever did

01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:53.680
where if you got the trivia questions wrong the kids bop music got louder yes

01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:56.560
and it would distract you from getting future and see they should make a real

01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:00.640
game show out of that I'm a genius I invented that game all by myself the

01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:05.120
game will be launching September 21st will feature 24 contemporary hits as

01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:09.920
they put it in quotes there including and if you haven't heard of kids bop

01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:15.360
it's basically kids singing you know popular songs so imagine all your

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:19.600
favorite and not so favorite songs and like from a top 40 radio station just

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:25.040
kind of like thrown down the garbage disposal and that's like a kid's music

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:31.120
yes the Benny Hill theme came up inadvertently oops the Benny Hill theme

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:35.200
unfortunately not part of the kids bop dance party video game you know it's

01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:41.280
funny total mistake did intend for that music to play but somehow fitting yes

01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:46.720
such songs in this will be of course Lady Gaga's paparazzi Michael Jackson's

01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:52.920
thriller thanks get the party started and yeah it's gonna include a free play

01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:58.480
challenge dance-off shop and dress-up modes and it will feature two players

01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:04.560
that can dance cooperatively or go to head-to-head lame but not really my

01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:09.240
target demographic but then again just dance sold million copies so what do I

01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:15.960
know about games I guess apparently nothing if you are a collector of such

01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:21.600
odd game peripherals as I don't know the chainsaw controller for Resident Evil

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:27.680
or I guess in this case Dragon Quest it's gonna be getting its own Dragon

01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:36.280
Quest monsters battle road victory it's a Wii game that was a port of an arcade

01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:40.680
game that's based on collectible cards but the actual controller like the

01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:45.560
arcade has two giant buttons and a giant sword that looks like it's basically the

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:49.480
sword in the stone that you have to interact with as well the controller

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:58.040
will cost the 12,800 yen of the equivalent of $137 US and will be out in

01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:04.560
Japan this summer so if you're a big collector of odd peripherals this will

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:09.280
be coming to you from Hori and then finally of course we've been hearing

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:15.600
about a lot of cameos of characters in lost planet 2 including you know Dom

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:21.400
from Gears of War well now of course you know Sony's got to have their characters

01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:26.240
in there as well not really making it in for the launch but there will be some

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:30.880
free download content coming out soon that will include the Helghast

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:35.200
characters from the Killzone series that you'll be able to play as in lost

01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:39.360
planet 2 and they have a few different versions of those that you get to play

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:45.360
as so those will be available for free on the PlayStation Network in June can I

01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:48.840
pitch a dream game to you guys real quick and all our dream game possible I

01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:52.800
just want to pitch it to you guys and see what you guys think okay the crew

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:55.960
from Kidz Bop meets Gwar

01:33:55.960 --> 01:34:03.480
that'd be weird and I don't know like maybe could be like a point-and-click

01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:07.320
type of game like in the vein of you know Sam & Max and those types of games

01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:12.360
where like the you play as the the folks from Gwar and you're trying to find the

01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:16.720
people from Kidz Bop and like corrupt them and or murder them I will one-up

01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:21.960
that okay okay I'll one up that please we need to launch a new CD series called

01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:26.400
Gwar Bop they basically take score and have saying all these different

01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:34.120
temporary hits as they put it hey hey I I'd play that I would do good stuff

01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:37.560
alright and then we'll make it come full circle and put it out of the game alright

01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:43.440
so possibly coming to a PC near you alright moving on let's talk about some

01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:48.120
other quick news halo 2 yes there were still some holdouts playing halo 2

01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:51.560
online you might remember there were guys that were refusing to pull their

01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:56.800
neck connection and what's kind of weird is that Microsoft you would think would

01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:00.320
have just like like put the ban hammer down on them a long time ago but they

01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:04.200
kind of thought it was funny and they they let it go like as long as they

01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:07.680
could hold out their connections and so forth and the last man standing was

01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:15.240
Apache and for sir was the gamertag and he was finally removed he says he was

01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:18.480
kicked off but you know kicked off could mean that his Comcast connection sucks

01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:21.520
balls because that's what's been happening to me on World of Warcraft

01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:24.720
these past couple weeks tech came to my house and everything said he couldn't

01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:28.320
find anything wrong like yeah I guess I'm just fucking crazy yeah that's just

01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:33.880
our crappy service it's a feature so anyhow whatever I so he finally got

01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:37.840
booted whether it was by Microsoft or his cable provider who knows but it was

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:43.520
at 11 o'clock or just before 11 o'clock pacific time may 10th 2010 he was out of

01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:48.400

Super Gameboy that was for the Super Nintendo no it's a device that was

01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:20.480
created by this guy on the Nintendo age forums who calls himself bunny boy it's

01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:24.840

they have like a hidden DJ game in that though the the printer software the what

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.920
software the printer software that came with the actual printer does it I don't

01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:55.080
remember yeah there's a little like game in there or I don't know one I didn't

01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:58.760
pay for one all right I just remember seeing the features and I thought gee

01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:04.640
that was stupid can I put my own receipts on it oh that might be good I

01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:09.600
don't know I game room updates there's now we have to start covering these two

01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:12.720
we got rock band releases virtual console releases now we have game room

01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:17.520
releases as well this week you missed battle zone Canyon bomber Keystone

01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:21.400
capers for the 2600 Canyon bomber is also the 2600 version not the arcade

01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:26.240
version mega zone for the arcade night driver for the Atari 2600 oink for the

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:30.320

01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:34.360
game packs that you're downloading are actually two weeks worth of games it's

01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:38.840
just that half of them stay locked for a week so if you downloaded you know

01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:42.320
something that was in last week's pack like pitfall you already had this week's

01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:45.560
pack waiting to go interesting huh although you would have should have been

01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:50.200
able to guess that because games pack one and two are like 15 games apiece so

01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:53.480
game pack three rolls around and it's you know another 50 megabytes it's

01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:57.280
actually 15 more games go figure well some of the games have been announced

01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:00.640
for the next pack that is coming out and that is going to be coming out on May

01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:04.560
19th because it looks like what is that Wednesday is gonna be game room day yeah

01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:08.320
asteroids for the arcade you know we already have asteroids deluxe but you

01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:12.680
get original asteroids this time demons two diamonds was a 2600 game that's

01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:17.800
coming out this week as well Grand Prix from Activision shark shark space duel

01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:21.680
it was an arcade game it was kind of like a souped-up asteroids I guess you

01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:26.000
could say probably I think the biggest release this week stampede is coming out

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:30.040
this week on the 2600 oh I have fond memories of stampede we went to the

01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:34.640
classic gaming Expo I participated in like the official stampede scoreboard

01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:38.360
that twin galaxies was doing I think I got like next to last place I'm that

01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:44.120
good at stampede time pilot is also coming out May 19th but time pilots

01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:47.660
already available on Xbox Live just so you know for five bucks and you get the

01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:51.680
souped-up version so if you want to buy time pilot for game room that's on you

01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:56.360
but you'll get the opportunity this week to buy it all over again if you want

01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:01.040
it's all about money that's right Monday Monday Monday and speaking of all about

01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:10.560
money how about our rock band releases for the week as yay what is wrong with

01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:14.900
my computer well where do I begin I'm just kidding

01:39:14.900 --> 01:39:19.240
seriously it frees up or something no it's opening 50,000 windows when I'm

01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:28.880
trying to yikes spam spam spam no lose weight increase your penis yes it's no

01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:32.040
because it's completely screwing up now so all right that's fine I'll go to some

01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:35.800
chat room comments chat that orange on trade calm salacious pop says demons and

01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:40.280
diamonds was a paddle game though with it was a big twisty knob paddle and

01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:44.720
trackball for game room please I somewhat agree although I don't think at

01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:48.080
the end of the day I would be able to justify buying a trackball for my Xbox

01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:51.600
because I know it costs like 30 to 40 bucks and what am I gonna play with it

01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:58.320
Crystal Castles whoo I don't know although you know in theory they do they

01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:01.360
do need to have better support for that so it's a prey hack that together playing

01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:06.920
Crystal Castles on the joystick or the little Xbox 360 controller just just it

01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:12.840
stinks it stinks all right so we have I've got everything pulled up now I had

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:18.440
to basically reload it all our rock band download content actually is pretty cool

01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:22.120
we've got a Grateful Dead pack which includes beat it on down the line

01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:27.240
Cumberland blues scarlet begonias throwing stones touch of gray and US

01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:30.800
blues and then two songs by the smithereens and I like the smithereens

01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:34.840
is one of my groups I really liked when I was in high school is a girl like you

01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:42.120
and only a memory those are both really good songs for some project new town

01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:48.280
news their big event is going to have a Cirque du Soleil performance you Cirque

01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:56.880
du Soleil but it'll be on June 13th so look forward to feats of flexibility or

01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:05.440
as my friend calls it Cirque du Soguet I know right and then Bayonetta the

01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:11.000
director Kamiya Hideki he basically doesn't like that there's a Bayonetta

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:20.160
doujinshi like hentai doujinshi about Bayonetta getting getting it on well I

01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:25.520
mean she's kind of sexy that means you've got a popular product hi the more

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:31.100
you know I I have personally Sega should be fucking excited that they have like a

01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:37.400
new franchise here you know what I mean well I mean trust me you go to cons and

01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:42.720
see how much Final Fantasy 7 doujin there were you know I've got a ton

01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:47.880
myself of other series that I won't need I actually have some Final Fantasy 7

01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:55.800
doujinshi doesn't everyone this interesting um but um and I have a few

01:41:55.800 --> 01:42:00.960
roni kenshin ones too but anyway um he's basically quoted saying it seems

01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:04.320
there's pornographic doujinshi based off Bayonetta there are fans who will resent

01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:08.000
that and I hardly think those responsible hold any love for the game

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:15.640
dude get get your head out your butt dude um there was though Chris is it

01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:19.840
dalen or dalen there's a quote from him and I actually like this and this is

01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:24.680
actually a point that I've had with you know some of these games that guys can

01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:29.520
go and get outfits for their female characters and you know I always laughed

01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:33.400
that WrestleMania was like dress-up for for boys you know because they could

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:37.600
customize their wrestler and you know but um the quote saying guys tell

01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:40.080
themselves they shouldn't listen to fashion they're terrified if they spend

01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:43.040
enough time playing as Bayonetta being Bayonetta and witnessing the power of

01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:47.560
her high heels and endless tresses well at some point they'll stop objectifying

01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:51.760
her they want to be her she won't invite our gaze as much as grip it until she

01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:57.640
sucked us into a vortex of overpowering femininity I like that a vortex of

01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:05.960
overpowering femininity that should be on the box can we get an iTunes review

01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:09.160
for our show that says that

01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:15.520
boo power a vortex of overpowering feminine is that what they're calling

01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:22.320
her bits now it's a vortex all right some other gaming news and of course

01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:25.800
we'll get to the skype line the mailbag and all that fun stuff in just a little

01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:32.120
bit but some other new stories first starting off with Loki yes you know it's

01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:37.040
like every week we hear about another game franchise being turned into a movie

01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:43.600
and each one you was perceived with more of a eye roll than the next well this

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:48.720

01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:55.280
Sony pictures what how does that even work it's just gonna be a movie about

01:43:55.280 --> 01:44:01.200

01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:27.840
this has to do with video game injuries you somebody like gotta like bloody nose

thing that's gross I'm looking sorry this is a great radio I'm looking at a

01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:35.480
pictures linked at asylum calm healing this on Twitter here what the hell

01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:40.880
happened here I guess these guys got injured it was Call of Duty modern

01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:45.240
warfare 2 and he was playing against a few friends and his mother asked him to

01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:50.040
get his daughter's PJs wait so your mother had to tell you to get your

01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:53.960
daughter's boy all right so that he didn't realize that the Xbox Live

01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:58.280
headset was wrapped around his chairs arm so when he got up quickly BAM the

01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:02.160
wire got caught and the head smashed right into my Mac which was sitting on a

01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:09.080
stereo a few feet off the ground ow so he got up quickly and BAM hit his head

01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:16.800
that looks hurtful so he went to the hospital and thanks to him I love this

01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:20.560
but a few hours later he was online fragging again thanks to a real-life

01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:24.760
painkiller perk prescribed by the doctor

of something we haven't seen yet f0 k thanks that's the one game I really

01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:29.080
would like to see a new one of except unfortunately I think if I really want

01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:32.600
to like a new f-zero game it's going to have to be on the Xbox or the

01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:38.080
PlayStation 3 and that's not gonna happen 30 tried it there and it sucked

01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:44.360
did they you remember is that a game from koei I put wipeout wipeout HD is

01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:49.880

what else was on the old-school NES that I don't remember ever seeing later was

dot game heroes just rips off an X should be star tropics that was a great

01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:45.760
game all right hey entertainment also sends us this tweet call of duty has

01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:49.360
been making money off multiplayer practically since the launch of the 360

01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:57.880
but they sell products EAS P is a service sure why don't I link read this

01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:04.280
one Tiger Claw 305 sends us another Twitter topic it's a link from MTV

01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:14.360
multiplayer blog apparently cliffy B has said that mass effect let me read this

01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:18.200
quote quote the thing that was cool is that mass effect is kind of an RPG for

01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:21.040
me with the cover-based shooting I think there's a reason why it's been

01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:26.120
successful because gamers love gears God get your just take your ego and shove

01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:32.320
it up your ass here's something like that I would like to thank myself for

01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:36.680
making Mass Effect 2 such a great game because if I put my game out no one

01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:40.360
would know first-person shooters are in the window epic first-person shooters

01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:43.520
you know I I'm sorry with all due respect I'm awesome I'm not gonna read

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.720
thank you Tiger Claw for trying but I'll just tell you in a nutshell he says mass

01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:55.040
effect is the Star Wars for the new generation I'm the Dane Cook oh you know

01:50:55.040 --> 01:51:02.980
what no no what you are like the episode 2 of this generation the Yoda fight was

cool but come on get over yourself all right although I gotta say with all due

01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:15.520
respect to Cliffy be the shadow complex on Xbox Live Arcade was pretty fucking

01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:20.880
rat I gotta say I gotta say shadow runner in chat says Cliffy needs to suck

game of the week oh well you're quite welcome woot there you go those are the

01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:57.160
Twitter topics I'm sorry for ignoring you for one whole story you know I just

01:51:57.160 --> 01:52:00.760
remembered and this is totally random I don't even know why I just remember this

01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:03.620
but I saw earlier this weekend like huh that's not my should mention on the show

01:52:03.620 --> 01:52:06.280
because we talked about it before and we kind of were hoping they would come to

01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:10.640
other platforms remember that game that I kind of hated because it was basically

01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:15.800
a ripoff of House of the Dead Rock of the Dead it was a game that you know it's

01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:20.960
like typing of the dead but you use your guitar controller to I remember that

01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:24.200
it's coming up this fall but it's actually not just coming out in the Wii

01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:27.960
this time it's actually gonna be coming on 360 and PlayStation 3 as well as the

01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:32.120
Wii well done is it please tell me it's a budget title please please uh I don't

01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:36.200
remember I don't remember that part but still called Rock of the Dead so called

01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:41.200
Rock of the Dead awesome look and I realize you guys are saying like you

01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:44.160
know I and I seem to remember when Rock of the Dead first came up on this show a

01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:47.200
lot of people were saying lawsuit it's gonna be a lawsuit but like seriously

01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:51.680
after playing 3d game heroes it's a parody that's all they have to say it's

01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:57.240
a parody and we're like Loki when you play 3d game heroes and dark Sakura if

01:52:57.240 --> 01:53:00.720
you do at some point you know you really should check it out because it'll tickle

01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:05.640
your retro funny bone tell me it's not just a complete effing ripoff oh I can

01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:09.920
tell that without playing it but that's okay I'm fine that Zelda's a good game

01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:16.880
it needs to be ripped off more often hey there was already new topia all right

01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:22.040
huge news this week everybody's been talking about this and you know we got

01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:26.600
to say something about this to steam for the Mac came out this week it included

01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:31.360
57 games at launch including torchlight that's actually game I played a little

01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:35.520
bit of this week I like me some torchlight was out there for 10 bucks on

01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:42.680
steam for the Mac but the best deal of all free free game portal free zero

01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:49.080
dollars free nothing may tell May 24th and they didn't want the Mac users to

01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:51.640
have all the fun there because if they only gave it away for free on the Mac

01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:59.200
you'd have people like Loki that would be like that's my Loki impression that

01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:01.960
they didn't give it out for free on the PC although I'll bet Loki didn't

01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:06.600
download it nope but you really should it is really a great game but I you know

01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:12.560
we all know what the trick is here it's a it's an asshole game at this point

01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:16.360
it's a great game and you should do it if you've never played it you need to

01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:21.360
play it but the trick is it's kind of the Trojan horse to get steam on your

01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:25.840
computer because once steam is on your computer then you're gonna see these

01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:32.320
sales civilization three complete edition one dollar and 25 cents buy it

01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:36.200
that's what's been getting me well I said when when loom went down to four

01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:41.840
bucks you know I was on that yeah and you and dark soccer look dark soccer she

01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:46.680
even bought the pink anus game I did by the penis game and you know what it's

01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:51.760
crap but she bought it and that's all they care about at the end of the day

01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:58.240
yeah it's it's read ratings please people SSJ 100 Matt says can't get any

01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:03.040
cheaper than free unless you're Yaris mmm true SAG in our term says they needed

01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:06.960
to demonstrate the steam play concept so it's free on both platforms absolutely

01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:13.040
it's kind of the Trojan horse but you know it it it's a win-win situation you

01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:16.760
win because you get a free game and you don't get like I in and to reference the

01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:22.400
other chat comment you don't get some crappy free game you get a great game of

01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:27.600
the year caliber game for free but the trade-off is they win because they just

01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:30.280
installed your thing on your computer so you're not tempted to go get you know

01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:34.920
direct-to-drive or the windows gaming platform which granted I know is not on

01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:38.280
the Mac but you know you know what I mean same thing they get that on your

01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:42.080
computer and then you're seeing all the sales and you're like oh shit I can get

01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:47.800
torchlight for $10 maybe I should get that so there you go all of that's

01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:50.080
available on the Mac some of the other games you might want to check out that

01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:56.280
are available on the Mac right now braid let's see is a big one some of the

01:55:56.280 --> 01:56:01.600
Indiana Jones games loom you can play on the Mac now yes salmon max devil's

01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:07.360
playhouse tales monkey island season 1 torchlight which I definitely recommend

01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:11.400
if you liked if you even just like thought Diablo 2 was kind of cool you

01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:16.920
should get torchlight it's pretty much the same fucking game and have a better

01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:21.360
set for which of course you know I have a big boner for all things civilization

01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:26.680
so I'm excited that the Mac fans can play that on steam well I think that was

01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:30.640
I think sit for was already available on the Mac I could be wrong all right more

01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:37.800
news mailbag coming up in a little bit to dark Sakura yes more stuff um this is

01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:48.280
about the rating system in Australia there is and actually so fairly I would

01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:54.800
have to say a big percentage approves that there should be 98% actually said

01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:59.640
that there should be an r18 plus rating so we're thinking where things are

01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:06.160
restricted to 18 and over it's been proposed before but now it's like that

01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:16.160
that's what the people want so who knows but that's there's actually though some

01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:22.000
from other special interest groups though that were saying that only 53%

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:33.160
actually approve of it but numbers lie statistics can be budged it's funny you

01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:36.520
talk about statistics because some of the interesting chat comments I'm

01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:39.520
reading right now about the whole steam thing you know they're a little delayed

01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:44.320
so we get comments from the last story say is saying now we'll have stats for

01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:49.440
how many Mac users will buy games or to clarify publicly accessible stats for

01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:55.360
Mac users who will buy games interesting some other comments Robert M says I've

01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:58.840
been anticipating torchlight for quite some time but didn't want to invest in

01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:03.600
Windows 7 and partitioning for boot camp donovan says he'll wait for Diablo 3

01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:08.800
yourself but I think torchlights pretty good deal with the one thing torchlight

01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:13.280
is missing is multiplayer but seriously it's like 10 bucks that's that's great

01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:19.040
it's a great deal for a single-player game really is anyhow alright so moving

01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:26.160
on with some more news stories looking yes so it's interesting because you

01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:29.880
know there's already been screenshots people are not really screenshots but

01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:35.120
people taking pictures of you know Red Dead Redemption because it's been coming

01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:38.920
in early to a few different stores and one of the screenshots or I should say

01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:43.600
box shots that they got of the game on PlayStation 3 shows that there's some

01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:48.840
exclusive content included for the PlayStation 3 version now I mean not

01:58:48.840 --> 01:58:52.400
trying to sound biased or anything it doesn't sound all that wonderful but

01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:56.960
here's what you get you get Solomon's Solomon's folly gang hideout which is

01:58:56.960 --> 01:59:02.160
basically kind of a safe house in the game and then you also get the Walton

01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:09.920
gang outfit the Walton gang is the kind of villain in the game and John boy yes

01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:14.880
this is exclusive for the PlayStation 3 not quite as wonderful as you know

01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:18.960
exclusive download content like that was on Grand Theft Auto episodes from Liberty

01:59:18.960 --> 01:59:23.360
City but you know maybe this stuff will come out later on as you know something

01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:27.440
paid for on the Xbox 360 I know there is some more free download content coming

01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:32.880
out later on so who knows but hey anything extra is kind of good so you

01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:35.780
know if you're getting on the ps3 there's a little bonus for you who know

01:59:35.780 --> 01:59:39.760
that it might be enough to sway some people even if it's like a little you

01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:43.920
never know people that have both I know it's not that big a deal there's like

01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:49.040
other there's tons of outfits you can get in the game and lots of different

01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:51.960
things you can find safe houses and stuff I don't really know if this stuff

01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:58.080
is really gonna do it for you but whatever if that's me if you really want

01:59:58.080 --> 02:00:02.840
to get into both systems you're not sure which one maybe that's way all right

02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:06.080
some other news coming out this week how many of y'all have seen the movie cube

02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:12.960
there's a little in my love cube too but not the original cube no I like the

02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:18.800
first one but the second one I okay I'm just to go say a little bit about it

02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:23.080
it's it's an indie film and describe what cube is about but you gotta start

02:00:23.080 --> 02:00:28.040
with the first one with the first one these people basically wake up in

02:00:28.040 --> 02:00:33.080
different rooms that are all there's a hatch above a hatch below and a hatch on

02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:38.800
each wall and it starts off with a pretty gory death because some of the

02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:44.360
rooms are trapped and so as it goes they they each run into each other as they go

02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:49.120
through the cube and find out that each of them has a specific skill some people

02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:52.200
have been left with their glasses some people have been left with you know

02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:57.000
something in their pocket there's a crazy lady and her skill is being crazy

02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:03.880
no she was a doctor right yeah the doctor but um but it's it's that you

02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:09.280
know these people are stuck in in the cube and their whole point is trying to

02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:13.320
figure out the way out and basically while they're moving from room to room

02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:18.000
they all know they had they didn't have what the cube 2 was one with crazy lady

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:24.720
the first one had the autistic boy yes they they basically find out that the

02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:30.600
rooms are moving mm-hmm and then G spoiler that's why it's all I just like

02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:35.080
it's like over 10 years old this point and that and that basically the autistic

02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:38.880
boy is some sort of savant with numbers and figures out that it's like prime

02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:42.920
numbers go into the right room and they figure out which way the rooms are going

02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:47.640
to be that lead to the exit right where the exit is so it's all and now cube 2 I

02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:51.960
love it because it's called hyper cube meaning a tesseract wait it's not

02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:59.800
electric boogaloo no I mean I like that one because I love theoretical physics I

02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:03.400
I don't have the brain for the math or anything I just love reading about it

02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:06.680
wait so the cube was like traveling through time and space as well exactly

02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:11.880
Wow the fourth dimension being time Wow so and it had like this really weird

02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:19.760
ending and also the cube 2 inspired a whole mod for a half-life when they're

02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:22.840
a cube zero at some point you were a cute cute the third one was cube zero

02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:27.100
which is like a prequel and it was crap okay well how would you like to play a

02:02:27.100 --> 02:02:31.720
video game based off cube she's raising her hand it might actually happen

02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:37.780
believe it or not it's an interview that Vin Vincenzo is his name Vincenzo Natali

02:02:37.780 --> 02:02:41.560
he was the director of the game and he was talking to MTV about the game the

02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:45.920
film splice which is an upcoming movie that he did they for whatever reason

02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:49.660
asked him about cube if he ever wanted to revisit the universe he said I would

02:02:49.660 --> 02:02:54.100
very much like to do a cube game I'd love to do a game when I was writing it

02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:57.560
with my writing partner we were saying to each other are we writing a film are

02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:00.920
we writing a game it's always been amazing to me that no one has attempted

02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:04.420
to turn it into a game I would very much like to do that that's how I would like

02:03:04.420 --> 02:03:06.600
to get back into the cube world I guess that's true because there was the mod

02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:11.500
right there's the mod based on hypercube he probably hasn't seen it and someone

02:03:11.500 --> 02:03:16.000
actually recreated the end of the movie in using Gary's mod it does have a real

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:20.740
creepster ending to it actually the whole movie is kind of a downer and then

02:03:20.740 --> 02:03:24.940
like like it really leaves you with more questions than you start the movie with

02:03:24.940 --> 02:03:29.100
but it wasn't a bad movie it was just kind of like the fuck look that was my

02:03:29.100 --> 02:03:32.700
reaction at the end was like the well it is what and it's it's a movie that I

02:03:32.700 --> 02:03:36.660
think everyone needs to see at least once you know the movie that leaves you

02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:43.220
talking and for a low-budget movie it was intelligently done I think it's

02:03:43.220 --> 02:03:49.300
definitely one that's a thinker too so would it be a low-budget game well given

02:03:49.300 --> 02:03:53.140
that you probably only need to make you know one environment over and over and

02:03:53.140 --> 02:03:56.860
true well you know when they did when they did how they made the movie cheap

02:03:56.860 --> 02:04:00.820
when they seriously is the same room and they turned them around and when they

02:04:00.820 --> 02:04:05.420
did cube to they it was also relatively expensive they just had those white

02:04:05.420 --> 02:04:11.780
walls of different lights behind them he's easy yeah it you don't nobody has

02:04:11.780 --> 02:04:16.900
to bother by the way with the third movie it's SSJ 100 Matt is suggesting

02:04:16.900 --> 02:04:20.020
Jamie if you like theoretical physics I would tell you to check out the movie

02:04:20.020 --> 02:04:24.020
what the bleep do we know I've heard of that movie I don't want me to see it

02:04:24.020 --> 02:04:27.220
actually you might have to like Netflix that or something all right in the

02:04:27.220 --> 02:04:30.780
meantime though Jamie has no time to Netflix because she has to dive into the

02:04:30.780 --> 02:04:36.220
mailbag and read your emails mailbag orange lounge radio.com every week you

02:04:36.220 --> 02:04:40.140
guys send us emails to our mailbag and dark soccer will jump in read if you

02:04:40.140 --> 02:04:43.500
possibly criticize their grammar and then we'll answer your questions here on

02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:47.500
the show again that's mailbag at orange lounge radio.com although more and more

02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:49.980
people have been submitting them through the website recently I guess there's a

02:04:49.980 --> 02:04:53.940
forum you can fill out deep man does deep man makes the magic happen on the

02:04:53.940 --> 02:04:57.500
website and he made it magical where people send us bleeps through the

02:04:57.500 --> 02:05:01.140
website now only in dragon boy is actually dragon boy 69 is actually

02:05:01.140 --> 02:05:05.420
sending us a tech support question and I have to read this because I think I

02:05:05.420 --> 02:05:09.820
don't know if look you'll laugh I'm not sure if you can assist me with my issue

02:05:09.820 --> 02:05:14.780
I have an iMac and just attempted to sign up to your site however when trying

02:05:14.780 --> 02:05:17.820
to log in it goes to white screen with the words invalid token is this because

02:05:17.820 --> 02:05:22.340
I'm on an iMac thank you in advance for any help you can provide me this matter

02:05:22.340 --> 02:05:26.420
um no I don't think it's because you're on an iMac just well we'll help you

02:05:26.420 --> 02:05:30.100
later I've seen the website do that before and I think it's because a lot of

02:05:30.100 --> 02:05:33.060
people hit it at once sometimes like believe it or not we're kind of popular

02:05:33.060 --> 02:05:39.580
use Firefox not Safari also just reload or use your back button and try to log

02:05:39.580 --> 02:05:43.420
in again usually it will kind of work itself out if it keeps doing it to you

02:05:43.420 --> 02:05:47.660
come back after like an hour we honestly don't know what causes it unfortunately

02:05:47.660 --> 02:05:51.420
our website is a popular target for spammers and when they clog up the pipes

02:05:51.420 --> 02:05:54.980
with their poop then it kind of prevents the rest of us from logging in but it

02:05:54.980 --> 02:05:58.880
has nothing to do with the fact that you're on an iMac as far as we know the

02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:03.380
websites worked on a Mac for me before it wasn't an iMac granted all right

02:06:03.380 --> 02:06:07.740
hello olr I look forward to your show every week I do have a couple of

02:06:07.740 --> 02:06:13.260
questions for olr what Sega model 1 or 2 or model 3 arcade games urgently needs

02:06:13.260 --> 02:06:18.220
an Xbox Live conversion I'm really looking forward to Daytona USA or scud

02:06:18.220 --> 02:06:23.500
race is it cut is it called super GT in the US I think so also I think super

02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:27.300
hang-on needs a good update like Sega did to outrun I would agree with that

02:06:27.300 --> 02:06:31.940
are you guys okay yeah that's the first one what do you think would make a good

02:06:31.940 --> 02:06:36.980
release if they had some sort of gun control or any of the gun games would be

02:06:36.980 --> 02:06:43.300
good like gun blade or even you know house of the dead or some that kind of

02:06:43.300 --> 02:06:52.500
stuff planet Harrier that's Hikari that I don't care planet Harrier um can we

02:06:52.500 --> 02:06:57.740
get doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo no I'm kidding actually that wouldn't be

02:06:57.740 --> 02:07:01.580
bad I mean you could even have steering wheel support maybe it wouldn't have

02:07:01.580 --> 02:07:06.580
drawing that would be cool are you guys planning on a new show for foreign

02:07:06.580 --> 02:07:11.180
listeners after the mishaps of your previous effort that's right wasn't the

02:07:11.180 --> 02:07:15.420
the euro show when the last computer just finally died it exploded yeah that's

02:07:15.420 --> 02:07:20.340
right let's pick a date we will have to do that but it's gonna have to be like

02:07:20.340 --> 02:07:26.420
in June at least yeah it's gonna be something it'll have to be at least June

02:07:26.420 --> 02:07:29.780
because next week I'm gonna literally be running in here at the last second

02:07:29.780 --> 02:07:34.860
because I'm going on a trip but and the weekend after by the way we won't be

02:07:34.860 --> 02:07:38.860
here Memorial Day weekend we will not be here at least I won't be here and I

02:07:38.860 --> 02:07:45.620
think that that's gonna be getting some shush I'm going to Oregon on it on a

02:07:45.620 --> 02:07:49.700
getaway so we're doing that and so I'm not gonna be here and I imagine a lot of

02:07:49.700 --> 02:07:52.220
listeners are probably gonna be doing their vacations and stuff too so we'll

02:07:52.220 --> 02:07:57.420
we'll not be here Memorial Day weekend but sometime either a June maybe July

02:07:57.420 --> 02:08:01.020
maybe like 4th of July weekend or something cuz I'll be a long weekend too

02:08:01.020 --> 02:08:04.820
we can do something we could do something or we should plan it around

02:08:04.820 --> 02:08:09.260
a major holiday you know what we should do is the 4th of July weekend just start

02:08:09.260 --> 02:08:12.660
at 8 in the morning and then finish late at night although Bobby will probably

02:08:12.660 --> 02:08:18.020
want to do a show somewhere in there I figure something out we also need to do

02:08:18.020 --> 02:08:22.400
another like roadshow good times roadshow and last question to dark

02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:25.820
Sakura why are there no more robbed floods I really miss them okay you I

02:08:25.820 --> 02:08:37.820
don't know rubber rubber rubber rubber rubber rubber rubber rubber rubber

02:08:37.820 --> 02:08:41.860
making a show nearly every week it's a real relief to listen to olr your

02:08:41.860 --> 02:08:44.800
light-hearted view on things is very welcome in a world that's way too

02:08:44.800 --> 02:08:48.500
serious thank you very much for a breeze from Belgium PS was my spelling and

02:08:48.500 --> 02:08:54.380
grammar okay you didn't put a question mark at the end of okay other than that

02:08:54.380 --> 02:08:58.460
spot on but he's from Belgium so he gets a little they have question marks in

02:08:58.460 --> 02:09:06.860
Belgium alright funny I question a question from our chat room wetu in our

02:09:06.860 --> 02:09:11.180
chat room asks what is Memorial Day for I don't know if maybe he's Canadian or

02:09:11.180 --> 02:09:13.740
from a foreign country or maybe one of the Americans that doesn't know the

02:09:13.740 --> 02:09:18.620
difference here it is quickly in the u.s. there's two holidays around the Armed

02:09:18.620 --> 02:09:23.140
Services one is Memorial Day one is Veterans Day Memorial Day is a day to

02:09:23.140 --> 02:09:27.620
honor those that have been lost serving the country in the Armed Forces and you

02:09:27.620 --> 02:09:32.500
know most notably wars like Vietnam World War two etc memorial is for those

02:09:32.500 --> 02:09:36.580
that have passed away veterans is to honor oh and what who wants to clarify

02:09:36.580 --> 02:09:42.900
from New Zealand Veterans Day is the day that is that's in November and that's

02:09:42.900 --> 02:09:47.580
the day to honor those that are still serving or you know alive and used to

02:09:47.580 --> 02:09:50.820
serve you know a veteran so one for those that have passed away one for

02:09:50.820 --> 02:09:54.980
those that are still alive basically in other words Memorial Day would be like

02:09:54.980 --> 02:10:00.540
for my papa mm-hmm and my grandfather and Veterans Day would be like for my

02:10:00.540 --> 02:10:08.420
brother but both days great sales at Macy's tell me I'm wrong tell me I'm

02:10:08.420 --> 02:10:16.380
wrong I just read back a message from Becky said I made her snort by saying

02:10:16.380 --> 02:10:20.740
there's question marks in Belgium there are indeed question marks in Belgium

02:10:20.740 --> 02:10:27.060
you're right okay um this one comes I'm just gonna say from Laco and cuz they

02:10:27.060 --> 02:10:30.020
didn't put any other name it's been well since I've had a chance to email you

02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:35.220
guys last time Loki had turned me under earth defense force on 360 what Oh still

02:10:35.220 --> 02:10:38.220
playing by the way my question is in regards to the zombie talk from last

02:10:38.220 --> 02:10:43.100
week you guys talked about what music would kill zombies to but where would

02:10:43.100 --> 02:10:47.260
you set up HQ my roommate and I have argued between a super Walmart a mall

02:10:47.260 --> 02:10:52.580
and a Costco PS sorry if the grammar is bad had a 14-hour work day and typing in

02:10:52.580 --> 02:10:58.260
the dark so that I do not wake the wife good husband and and by the way I only

02:10:58.260 --> 02:11:03.860
give people a hard time they're really really really crappy where would I set

02:11:03.860 --> 02:11:09.500
up shop sorry I was flooding the chat room because they needed a they needed

02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:14.820
a spanking what was the question here it's we talked about what music we would

02:11:14.820 --> 02:11:19.020
kill zombies to but where would we set up HQ my roommate and I wouldn't argued

02:11:19.020 --> 02:11:26.380
as super Walmart a mall or Costco well dead rising was set in a mall and I

02:11:26.380 --> 02:11:30.500
guess that did pretty well for Frank West say an amusement park like

02:11:30.500 --> 02:11:36.180
zombieland that would be fun or a museum might be fun too and especially scary

02:11:36.180 --> 02:11:42.060
and who'd look for me in a museum it's the zoo Fort Knox

02:11:42.060 --> 02:11:52.580
oh good good guess area 51 or the equivalent of wherever it is video 54 so

02:11:52.580 --> 02:11:58.180
you can get your club on and kill zombies my mom's house the space shuttle

02:11:58.180 --> 02:12:05.820
try to get me up here zombies Rob Rob why are there zombies outside Rob Rob

02:12:05.820 --> 02:12:10.580
get rid of the zombies do you know this neighborhood has already gone to hell

02:12:10.580 --> 02:12:15.700
why are there zombies out front Rob she would annoy them away it would be great

02:12:15.700 --> 02:12:21.140
here zombies would never make it in the south especially out in the rural south

02:12:21.140 --> 02:12:26.020
just because of how many people have freaking guns probably be some good

02:12:26.020 --> 02:12:32.380
eating the New Orleans anyway Oh Rob uh no not Rob above Rob above us send us an

02:12:32.380 --> 02:12:35.840
email yeah okay here we go I listen to your conversation about the black we

02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:39.820
bundle leak in quotes the correspondence between an 10 on GameStop sounded

02:12:39.820 --> 02:12:44.580
totally fake ie viral marketing Nintendo bad dog that leak totally advertised our

02:12:44.580 --> 02:12:49.260
new bundle a very convenient week before release GameStop we fired the guy I

02:12:49.260 --> 02:12:53.660
will never do it again unless you ask us to again and did okay but just this once

02:12:53.660 --> 02:12:59.500
well played also Nintendo knows after all these years how to prevent this type

02:12:59.500 --> 02:13:04.620
of leak sending the promo standees every week ahead of time sounded intentional

02:13:04.620 --> 02:13:10.940
Rob above yep probably was and the more and more I hear about it the more and

02:13:10.940 --> 02:13:14.500
more I think it was just kind of like one of those like leaks to actually get

02:13:14.500 --> 02:13:17.740
people talking about the black we can I read some chat comments because these

02:13:17.740 --> 02:13:22.060
are pretty funny do it all right Donovan suggested these are all about the

02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:26.340
zombies and where would you set up shop one of my buddies from Alabama by the

02:13:26.340 --> 02:13:30.580
way hi Donovan my old school buddy I keep thinking it's Travis Donovan

02:13:30.580 --> 02:13:34.900
Donovan from under station live but he wouldn't listen to his one of my mate

02:13:34.900 --> 02:13:38.060
one of my major geek buddies and one of the people responsible for making me a

02:13:38.060 --> 02:13:42.500
bigger nerd then I literally he's a geek if he's listening to this show well a

02:13:42.500 --> 02:13:46.700
hearty hello heart as California as California kids have done a good job of

02:13:46.700 --> 02:13:52.460
corrupting Jamie just you know also some comments about my mother's house zeba

02:13:52.460 --> 02:13:56.220
says they're gross Rob and Tigerclaw follows that up with yes guy and if your

02:13:56.220 --> 02:14:01.700
mom sees you shoot a zombie she'd be like Rob that's gross rock you go outside

02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:10.780

and ask her what she would do if zombies showed up at her house salacious pop

02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:25.220
says lol the notoriously violent elitist bouncers of studio 54 are a great

02:14:25.220 --> 02:14:29.260
anti-zombie tool you look like shit you can't get in sorry come back with some

02:14:29.260 --> 02:14:32.940
hot girls and try again well they wouldn't even let the hot people in

02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:36.260
they're just like you random random random the zombies would have to be

02:14:36.260 --> 02:14:40.340
carrying cocaine to get in basically yeah zombies don't need cocaine they're

02:14:40.340 --> 02:14:44.540
already act like crackheads yeah you know what just popped in my head though

02:14:44.540 --> 02:14:53.940
with the word crackhead and zombie mmm zombie Whitney Houston okay so the next

02:15:01.820 --> 02:15:05.380
carpenter but I have to tell you something I love Wednesdays and

02:15:05.380 --> 02:15:08.860
Thursdays you know why because that's usually the time you release your

02:15:08.860 --> 02:15:11.460
current podcast and I get to fix someone's house while listening to you

02:15:11.460 --> 02:15:16.740

02:15:51.580 --> 02:15:57.020
my mother would have told that joke probably my mother would be ashamed of

02:15:57.020 --> 02:16:01.820
you and this you know my mom my mom this is what you know my mom probably would

02:16:01.820 --> 02:16:06.940
have Rob you shouldn't say that rock she's like secretly laughing she was

02:16:06.940 --> 02:16:11.900
thinking that my mom would probably try to stifle the giggles you know like you

02:16:11.900 --> 02:16:14.960
do when you're at church exactly actually that was me at church

02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:20.660
tackling my giggles I'm sitting in your own pew no usually I was sneaking out

02:16:20.660 --> 02:16:24.540
and going to hang out in the church library to read like the real stuff

02:16:24.540 --> 02:16:29.500
anyway all I know you might might you know and I I don't want to get all

02:16:29.500 --> 02:16:36.180
religious see on the show but I will see super book that was my show growing up

02:16:36.180 --> 02:16:43.460
super book flying house that was it all right actually and for the record I did

02:16:43.460 --> 02:16:48.180
used to sneak out of church and hang out in the church library reading like well

02:16:48.180 --> 02:16:50.900
would you go to hell for that though I don't think you would because like

02:16:50.900 --> 02:16:56.620
you're still like doing churchy things well because no at the tender age of 10

02:16:56.620 --> 02:17:01.340
years old and and this you know I'm not making it any type of a secret I'm

02:17:01.340 --> 02:17:08.840
converting to to Judaism eventually mm-hmm I I was sort of like these were

02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:13.020
translated from Greek wasn't it written in Hebrew and then going out in the

02:17:13.020 --> 02:17:38.460
library and look everything up so that was me anyway

02:17:38.460 --> 02:17:48.180
on the 700 Club Rob I know I know and I was a kid it was totally old-school

02:17:48.180 --> 02:17:51.600
anime you know if you think about it like you know it's some pretty badass

02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:54.900
shit happens in that cartoon you know this guy's just like splitting the ocean

02:17:54.900 --> 02:17:58.300
in half like you know transformers didn't do that shit it's totally

02:17:58.300 --> 02:18:06.300
old-school anime all right anyway um I'm over it God everybody everybody gets too

02:18:06.300 --> 02:18:12.940
too tense when it comes to religious topics have fun I just stopped just I

have to be in boy drag and I can salacious pop I need dark soccer to

02:18:17.740 --> 02:18:21.260
dress in boy drag so she can sneak into the rabbi school and read the Torah

02:18:21.260 --> 02:18:27.340
this needs to happen and sing father can you hear me I could do that anyway if I

02:18:27.340 --> 02:18:32.060
wanted to be a rabbi all right let's move on let's move on I couldn't be an

02:18:32.060 --> 02:18:35.260
Orthodox rabbi but look two things you shouldn't talk about on a video game

02:18:35.260 --> 02:18:39.100
podcast politics and religion yet we do them both that's what makes our show so

02:18:39.100 --> 02:18:50.700

games still place today and believes that parents should be gaming with their

02:19:06.740 --> 02:19:10.100

killing so I am going to copy this link location and by the way while Dark

02:19:42.740 --> 02:19:45.920

plot to Yentl that he was trying to get you a Barbra Streisand I know I haven't

02:19:59.900 --> 02:20:03.020
about watching if we're gonna watch like things that involve cross-dressing Rob

02:20:03.020 --> 02:20:07.020
let's watch Yentl and Victor Victoria no let's watch Priscilla Queen of the

02:20:07.020 --> 02:20:12.860

02:20:32.940 --> 02:20:58.700
this is funny cuz he's running over people with a lock or great radio I'm

02:20:58.700 --> 02:21:10.100
watching a video and laughing at it oh this is the actual song the world's

02:21:10.100 --> 02:21:21.700
combined harvester should be like the new email do we have more emails oh good

02:21:21.700 --> 02:21:25.220
read the email to this song I'm gonna have to find that song now we need to

02:21:25.220 --> 02:21:32.460
use that for we need to do that for our ridiculous news okay ever since I

02:21:32.460 --> 02:21:35.020
started listening to internet radio almost ten years ago I have always

02:21:35.020 --> 02:21:39.420
dreamed about listening to shoutcast net stations in my car when I found first

02:21:39.420 --> 02:21:43.340
came out I was excited to learn that it can play streaming radio however I

02:21:43.340 --> 02:21:46.820
didn't have the money to get one a couple months ago I finally decided that

02:21:46.820 --> 02:21:52.220
I wanted to purchase one with some of my tax return money after I heard about the

02:21:52.220 --> 02:21:55.860
supposed 4g version of the iPhone being found at a bar I was hesitant to buy

02:21:55.860 --> 02:21:59.780
knowing that this version may be released very soon since I haven't heard

02:21:59.780 --> 02:22:03.860
anything new about it in a while I don't know what I should do do you think this

02:22:03.860 --> 02:22:07.140
leak is delaying the 4g version to come out or do you think was just a marketing

02:22:07.140 --> 02:22:10.940
employed by Apple we're going to hear more about it very soon I just don't

02:22:10.940 --> 02:22:14.460
want to buy the 3gs and then a couple months later see a 4g version release

02:22:14.460 --> 02:22:20.780
and screw me over your fellow gamer girl Ziba well I bought a 3g a couple months

02:22:20.780 --> 02:22:26.980
ago rumor is Job's was pissed and like called gizmodo himself that's one of the

02:22:26.980 --> 02:22:30.340
latest rumors that was on the blogs this week but whatever believe it or not I

02:22:30.340 --> 02:22:36.140
don't care the fact is fact Apple will release information about a new phone in

02:22:36.140 --> 02:22:41.300
June so my suggestion if you think you can hold off until June the end of June

02:22:41.300 --> 02:22:44.700
which is only about a month away at this point if you can hold off like one month

02:22:44.700 --> 02:22:48.900
you're in good shape you'll be fine and then you'll you'll have a better idea

02:22:48.900 --> 02:22:54.860
what to expect the only other suggestion I really have is that keep in mind that

02:22:54.860 --> 02:22:59.060
iPhones not your only option you know they do have like two wraps I think for

02:22:59.060 --> 02:23:06.020
blackberries and the droid I mean the other phones have them too I don't know

02:23:06.020 --> 02:23:09.240
I wasn't feeling the song for mailbag music we're gonna have to we'll find a

02:23:09.240 --> 02:23:12.780
purpose for it on the show though it's a good song okay and that's it we're gonna

02:23:12.780 --> 02:23:16.980
find a use for that somewhere yeah by the way you know I was so distracted

02:23:16.980 --> 02:23:20.900
earlier in part a hmm it's because I was reading a friend's live journal and she

02:23:20.900 --> 02:23:28.580
had pictures up of what's it root root beat the the new Bimani game Oh you beat

02:23:28.580 --> 02:23:35.420
you beat yeah and it looked very cubicle it looks oh oh yeah our friend Japan is

02:23:35.420 --> 02:23:39.860
that that was um yeah you beat is kind of one of those games I'd like to play

02:23:39.860 --> 02:23:42.940
at some point where they testing it in the US and then they just kind of stopped

02:23:42.940 --> 02:23:50.980
I guess I don't know well she listed as do beat or maybe it's you as in like the

02:23:50.980 --> 02:23:58.540
the Spanish J I don't know um I I would say that there might be a chance at e3

02:23:58.540 --> 02:24:02.660
sometimes if Konami's got a lot of Bimani games they want to show they'll

02:24:02.660 --> 02:24:06.980
roll out a lot of machines at e3 supernova they did they brought they

02:24:06.980 --> 02:24:14.100
brought a beat me to DX machine in 2006 I think it was six sometimes they'll

02:24:14.100 --> 02:24:19.100
bring them to e3 for awareness I don't know why it started show but the Japanese

02:24:19.100 --> 02:24:25.500
games it was distorted yeah they brought to e3 one year and that was the new game

02:24:25.500 --> 02:24:31.660
that was on Japan yeah so we'll see but you beat I don't think is and it's not

02:24:31.660 --> 02:24:40.620
juby because I know but a lot of people because it's juby go juby I've seen

02:24:40.620 --> 02:24:44.380
people spell it both ways and besides that I would I wouldn't have known if I

02:24:44.380 --> 02:24:50.020
hadn't if I hadn't seen the Kana for it so but it's yeah yeah I'd like to check

02:24:50.020 --> 02:24:55.100
it out at some point but probably never will oh yeah and they actually called it

02:24:55.100 --> 02:24:57.900
in the limited location test they actually called it in dark to see it

02:24:57.900 --> 02:25:02.180
clarifies in chat you beat with like a you and that's not a bad name for a game

02:25:02.180 --> 02:25:10.100
but it could be taken many ways so you beat what we're 12 all right this is the

02:25:10.100 --> 02:25:13.820
part of the show where we get a little bit angsty because I don't know we've

02:25:13.820 --> 02:25:32.620
just been that way for eight years so deal with it it's the F use the week

02:25:32.620 --> 02:25:39.260
if he goes to allergies and the city of Dixon namely they're pollen

02:25:39.260 --> 02:25:45.980
locate after you too bad CD dumps

02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:53.260
I don't know like overall I've had a pretty good week but in the past couple

02:25:53.260 --> 02:25:57.980
days like like mother nature or whoever has it out for me out there was just

02:25:57.980 --> 02:26:03.460
kind of like I'm gonna kick you in the balls but actually you know what all

02:26:03.460 --> 02:26:10.340
things considered things could be a lot worse and I don't have it so bad so I'm

02:26:10.340 --> 02:26:15.100
not that angsty but I will say an F you know there was something that it ticked

02:26:15.100 --> 02:26:17.660
me off the other day and I was like that's gonna be my F you the week on oil

02:26:17.660 --> 02:26:19.940
I ride now I can't remember what it was so I guess they didn't make me that

02:26:19.940 --> 02:26:26.460
angsty F you to the fact that I still don't go out and buy a new car okay I've

02:26:26.460 --> 02:26:29.420
been saying I'm gonna do it for like a year and I still have it if you to

02:26:29.420 --> 02:26:35.620
myself all right let's get into a couple more stories and then oh god your calls

02:26:35.620 --> 02:26:40.620
1877 game olr after a couple more stories here the skype line will be open

02:26:40.620 --> 02:26:45.660
at orange lounge radio on skype or 1877 game olr but at first a couple more

02:26:45.660 --> 02:26:51.180
stories looking I'm sure with infinity war going there not really going there

02:26:51.180 --> 02:26:55.740
separate ways but they're kind of dissolving if you know what I mean I'm

02:26:55.740 --> 02:26:59.140
sure they're going to treat the call of duty franchise with the utmost respect

02:26:59.140 --> 02:27:04.060
although you kind of wonder with all these different domain names that

02:27:04.060 --> 02:27:07.380
they're registering and I'm sure a lot of it's just to kind of make sure that

02:27:07.380 --> 02:27:13.100
people aren't squatting on the moon the domains but a little bit kind of weird

02:27:13.100 --> 02:27:17.740
okay like for example they have registered different variations for

02:27:17.740 --> 02:27:23.180
quality including Call of Duty future warfare advanced warfare secret warfare

02:27:23.180 --> 02:27:29.340
and space warfare as well as those same names with two and three appended to the

02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:37.220
end space warfare really every weird

02:27:38.340 --> 02:27:47.980
space warfare huh space warfare Call of Duty in space well that's got to be

02:27:47.980 --> 02:27:52.300
better than vagina warfare no I'm being completely serious right now there's a

02:27:52.300 --> 02:28:00.020
new game out and it's about vagina it's a game called privates it's on the PC

02:28:00.020 --> 02:28:05.300
and apparently it's coming to the Xbox 360 I don't know how the hell this is

02:28:05.300 --> 02:28:08.700
happening but apparently it's coming to 360 or at least that's what the

02:28:08.700 --> 02:28:16.980
developers would tell you it's zombie cow studios it is quote you lead a teeny

02:28:16.980 --> 02:28:21.940
tiny gang of condom-hatted Marines as they delve into people's vaginas and

02:28:21.940 --> 02:28:26.900
bottoms oh I see it's equal opportunity and blast away at all manner of oozy

02:28:26.900 --> 02:28:37.380
shouty monsters so you will be able to shoot the monsters that live inside the

02:28:37.380 --> 02:28:45.460
vagina take this yeast infection yeah actually you will be able to blast all

02:28:45.460 --> 02:28:49.620
manners of grody infections this looks like it looks like a sperm looks fucking

02:28:49.620 --> 02:28:55.060
gross like an evil sperm I'm all for like you know pushing the envelope and

02:28:55.060 --> 02:29:05.060
everything of good taste but this is just stupid like really really stupid

02:29:05.060 --> 02:29:08.860
but you know I'll have to play it at least once you're shooting sperm you're

02:29:08.860 --> 02:29:13.980
shooting evil spur look at that they're evil sperm yes they are they are evil

02:29:13.980 --> 02:29:17.940
sperm I should make how the hell is this coming out on Xbox I'm gonna make a

02:29:17.940 --> 02:29:21.340
live journal icon out of one of these evil sperm this is not coming out on the

02:29:21.340 --> 02:29:25.140
360 I don't know who the hell they think they're kidding but there's no way this

02:29:25.140 --> 02:29:30.340
game would not get an M or like a o rating and Microsoft has it in their

02:29:30.340 --> 02:29:33.700
thing that a o games will not be released and even if they try to do it

02:29:33.700 --> 02:29:36.980
as an indie game it will not get past the review board who the hell do they

02:29:36.980 --> 02:29:42.500
think they're kidding it's kind of funny though in a 12 year old sort of way I

02:29:42.500 --> 02:29:47.160
mean that's that's the that's the whole point right all right let's open up the

02:29:47.160 --> 02:29:51.980
Skype line right now at one eight seven seven game olr or our username on Skype

some last-minute stories Loki do you have any last-minute stories yeah we're

02:30:15.100 --> 02:30:21.420
talking a little bit about a movie coming for a game franchise well this

02:30:21.420 --> 02:30:26.060
isn't necessarily a game franchise that's getting in a movie but it has

02:30:26.060 --> 02:30:31.580
game stuff in it and that would be that wonderful short film pixels hold on

02:30:31.580 --> 02:30:35.660
collar we'll get to you in just a moment pixels which featured Donkey Kong

02:30:35.660 --> 02:30:39.100
Frogger space invaders and different stuff from Arkanoid that's being

02:30:39.100 --> 02:30:43.380
actually made into a full-length movie now yeah I was reading about that the

02:30:43.380 --> 02:30:47.220
other day that's pretty cool yeah happy mess and actually picked it up all right

02:30:47.220 --> 02:30:49.940
let me go to the phone call are you there hi hello you're on orange launch

02:30:49.940 --> 02:30:57.180
radio who's this this is Rob Rob hey I like your name what's up Rob I am

02:30:57.180 --> 02:31:01.780
getting feedback I'm gonna have to hang up oh no okay with that with I have echo

02:31:01.780 --> 02:31:05.820
one two three give echo one two three a call and hopefully that will work and

02:31:05.820 --> 02:31:09.920
that's a good good reference for anybody who's thinking about calling the show

02:31:09.920 --> 02:31:14.380
call echo one two three on skype before you call and hopefully that'll fix

02:31:14.380 --> 02:31:18.260
whatever problem you're getting sometimes folks will get a little bit of

02:31:18.260 --> 02:31:22.180
echo because just you know a little bit of background as to way we do it here at

02:31:22.180 --> 02:31:26.820
orange andreo we have speakers in studio we do not wear headsets because we

02:31:26.820 --> 02:31:30.380
there's too many of us to have headsets especially if we have a guest so we do

02:31:30.380 --> 02:31:34.540
have in-house speakers so sometimes you will like hear yourself over the speaker

02:31:34.540 --> 02:31:38.900
and it's a little crazy so do be aware of that if you call in and kind of hear

02:31:38.900 --> 02:31:42.820
yourself all right let's try again hi you're on

02:31:42.820 --> 02:31:49.540
orange on its radio who's this hey this is Rob again oh it's Rob above yeah the

02:31:49.540 --> 02:31:55.620
right I the Rob above are you still getting feedback no I I was listening to

02:31:55.620 --> 02:31:59.940
the show I had to turn off the feed so I could hear you ah yes that's a good

02:31:59.940 --> 02:32:03.260
thing just like when you call real radio you have to turn off your speakers so

02:32:03.260 --> 02:32:07.280
that will happen well hey I'm glad you're calling in Rob above what's on

02:32:07.280 --> 02:32:12.780
your mind okay well first of all I saw you and Bobby playing 3d game heroes to

02:32:12.780 --> 02:32:20.020
this afternoon yeah and have you gotten to Ortego town it's the second town is

02:32:20.020 --> 02:32:25.700
that the one in the desert yes is that the one with the um foo foo sequence or

02:32:25.700 --> 02:32:30.540
whatever it was called poof poof poof poof poof that's it it was the poof poof

02:32:30.540 --> 02:32:36.300
sequence is is that what you might have been inquiring about yeah I thought that

02:32:36.300 --> 02:32:41.660
was hilarious and also really dirty it was very dirty okay in mine like I don't

02:32:41.660 --> 02:32:45.740
know if it was just the way I was playing but when he woke up from poof

02:32:45.740 --> 02:32:50.860
poof it was the chicks dad was there and saying doesn't he give really good

02:32:50.860 --> 02:32:57.820
massages like I was like this game is filthy absolutely filthy yeah that's what

02:32:57.820 --> 02:33:02.340
I thought too and in fact they used massages the same way that incredible

02:33:02.340 --> 02:33:08.220
crisis used massages to mean something else mm-hmm exactly well what do you

02:33:08.220 --> 02:33:11.340
think of 3d game heroes obviously you've played a little bit if you've made it to

02:33:11.340 --> 02:33:17.660
poof poof um I'm enjoying it at a Zelda level but it doesn't seem to to go much

02:33:17.660 --> 02:33:23.380
beyond Zelda weren't you a little bit like just slightly disappointed at the

02:33:23.380 --> 02:33:27.100
customization features in it like maybe I'm just being a greedy bastard but I

02:33:27.100 --> 02:33:30.720
was kind of like you know again we live in an era of little big planet and I was

02:33:30.720 --> 02:33:34.440
kind of disappointed that the only thing you get to change is the way the hero

02:33:34.440 --> 02:33:38.760
looks like I was kind of thinking like maybe I'm crazy but that there would

02:33:38.760 --> 02:33:43.580
have been more customizability to it yeah I was a little disappointed in that

02:33:43.580 --> 02:33:48.360
too I knew it wasn't there but I was still disappointed right well at least

02:33:48.360 --> 02:33:52.020
it was only $40 you know it was a budget game I still like yeah I think you're

02:33:52.020 --> 02:33:55.200
right on a Zelda level though I mean if you want a great Zelda clone this is

02:33:55.200 --> 02:33:59.380
definitely I'm one of the best Zelda clones I've ever played Agdeft in our

02:33:59.380 --> 02:34:05.380
chat room says death by poof poof well I have one more thing to say and I'm gonna

02:34:05.380 --> 02:34:11.540
post a link in the chat yes there was some story on digital times about or

02:34:11.540 --> 02:34:20.380
digi times about 10 million iPhones being ordered by Apple of course and

02:34:20.380 --> 02:34:28.580
that they they work on the Verizon type network wait a minute way wait a minute

02:34:28.580 --> 02:34:32.420
I thought and I could have sworn I read this earlier this week and I'm looking

02:34:32.420 --> 02:34:35.300
at I'm looking at your story right now I'm pulling it up but I thought that the

02:34:35.300 --> 02:34:39.380
AT&T came out and like laid it on the table and said you know what bitches

02:34:39.380 --> 02:34:43.700
we're under contract till 2012 so you needed to stfu when it comes to this

02:34:43.700 --> 02:34:52.180
whole Verizon talk yeah but not if they call it an iPad mini that's but anyway

02:34:52.180 --> 02:34:57.740
but funny yeah I don't think 10 million I think it's fake because 10 million is

02:34:57.740 --> 02:35:04.020
a really bad number to order at startup it would be more like two two to five I

02:35:04.020 --> 02:35:08.900
agree didn't the iPad didn't even have that many I mean it was far less like

02:35:08.900 --> 02:35:13.780
not even a million iPads did they order right away I just yeah something strikes

02:35:13.780 --> 02:35:17.620
me as fishy about this too but I just thought about it because you talked

02:35:17.620 --> 02:35:21.740
about it earlier no it's it's you know and and like it or not iPhone is a

02:35:21.740 --> 02:35:26.140
gaming platform and needs to be recognized especially we're seeing ports

02:35:26.140 --> 02:35:29.540
of so many not just classic but new I mean there's it you can get Street

02:35:29.540 --> 02:35:33.700
Fighter 4 on the friggin iPhone it's if you if you don't consider the iPhone a

02:35:33.700 --> 02:35:38.620
gaming platform at this point you are behind the times yes sir

02:35:38.620 --> 02:35:43.260
all right well Robin but it's nice to hear from you like actual here as

02:35:43.260 --> 02:35:46.780

02:36:02.180 --> 02:36:05.540
username on skype is orange launch radio we can take a few more calls here

02:36:05.540 --> 02:36:11.660
Loki see I gave him a pass on some of the Skype etiquette and so forth cuz a I

02:36:11.660 --> 02:36:16.100
know he's listening to the show forever and be you know if it's your first time

02:36:16.100 --> 02:36:21.300
calling in I'll give you a pass on some of that stuff so all is forgiven hi

02:36:21.300 --> 02:36:25.900
you're on orange launch radio who's this hey what's up guys this is cut judo hey

02:36:25.900 --> 02:36:30.260
what's up what's on your mind not much first of all I just want to say that

02:36:30.260 --> 02:36:37.940
what was the game you're just talking about the Zelda 3d heroes yeah I call

02:36:37.940 --> 02:36:44.620
that basically Lego Zelda it's a confusing game I I mean I I understand

02:36:44.620 --> 02:36:47.860
that they it was kind of like a love letter to Zelda and all the other games

02:36:47.860 --> 02:36:52.660
from back in the day so I you know I'm not you know I'm not knocking them for

02:36:52.660 --> 02:36:56.820
making what everyone's calling the Zelda clone but just the look of it just it

02:36:56.820 --> 02:37:01.980
looks really shitty man I mean it looks like our RPG maker for PlayStation 2 you

02:37:01.980 --> 02:37:04.780
know any bad looking games and I don't know if you heard my review earlier in

02:37:04.780 --> 02:37:08.020
the show but that's kind of one thing you know I do like the game and I do

02:37:08.020 --> 02:37:11.140
recommend the game but one of its you know it's not a perfect game and one of

02:37:11.140 --> 02:37:15.140
its imperfections is you know it still just kind of looks like a PlayStation 2

02:37:15.140 --> 02:37:21.060
game and you know to some extent there's you know when you're doing retro I get

02:37:21.060 --> 02:37:23.420
there's probably that the the audience that's sitting there listen to this

02:37:23.420 --> 02:37:28.220
right now going well shit Rob if you're doing a retro style game what the hell

02:37:28.220 --> 02:37:33.080
do you expect them to do and I don't know one thing might be like a free

02:37:33.080 --> 02:37:37.660
roaming camera as opposed to four fixed cameras you get to pick from and yes I

02:37:37.660 --> 02:37:40.620
understand you get to do them in screenshots but I don't know it seems

02:37:40.620 --> 02:37:44.760
like they did have some optimization problems because again frame skip in a

02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:49.820
dungeon that's not okay you know just tone down the water effects they didn't

02:37:49.820 --> 02:37:54.420
need to be that awesome you know yeah I mean yeah that that game I'm pretty sure

02:37:54.420 --> 02:37:58.920
is giving a lot of people seizures with the water I mean I can't even make out

02:37:58.920 --> 02:38:02.020
what I'm looking at half the time you know it's I don't know it's just a

02:38:02.020 --> 02:38:06.180
really weird creepy looking game to me I mean I was never into the Zelda games

02:38:06.180 --> 02:38:11.140
to begin with so I would never pick it up but um it's just strange I don't

02:38:11.140 --> 02:38:15.260
something off with it yeah I mean right on that's part if you weren't into Zelda

02:38:15.260 --> 02:38:19.820
there ain't nothing here for you 3d I mean just just walk right on by there

02:38:19.820 --> 02:38:24.580
ain't nothing here for you yeah and that and that sword is maybe the worst weapon

02:38:24.580 --> 02:38:28.380
I've ever seen in a video game just just the look of it it's just over the time

02:38:28.380 --> 02:38:31.740
yeah I mean I can't knock it too much because I haven't played it maybe

02:38:31.740 --> 02:38:34.860
playing it you actually get some enjoyment out of it but looking at it I

02:38:34.860 --> 02:38:40.620
literally wanted to puke on the television screen the best looking game

02:38:40.620 --> 02:38:44.060
the best thing I could compare that sword to is just this more it's just

02:38:44.060 --> 02:38:48.140
another low moment you know you did in that game is a lot of lol moments and

02:38:48.140 --> 02:38:51.740
this that the ridiculous sword is just another one of them you just kind of

02:38:51.740 --> 02:38:55.460
sit there and doesn't the sword doesn't the sword get bigger as you level up or

02:38:55.460 --> 02:38:58.600
something like that you can go to a blacksmith and get your sword you can

02:38:58.600 --> 02:39:02.300
alter the length and width of your sword and I was just waiting for earth I was

02:39:02.300 --> 02:39:07.580
waiting for girth to be an option too but no way you can modify the beam that

02:39:07.580 --> 02:39:12.700
it fires but um you can go to a blacksmith and get some of that altered

02:39:12.700 --> 02:39:17.980
all right and my last comment is uh are you guys getting uh what is it red

02:39:17.980 --> 02:39:21.460
dimension something uh I'm getting I can't remember the name but I'm

02:39:21.460 --> 02:39:25.000
definitely getting it I know how sorry it's always yeah I'm absolutely good at

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:28.460
all again you already have it right I already have it yeah my boss is getting

02:39:28.460 --> 02:39:32.420
another copy too because I think I've got one free for my work nice look it

02:39:32.420 --> 02:39:36.620
must be nice is it like is it GPA in the wild west because that's basically what

02:39:36.620 --> 02:39:40.100
I want that's all it needs to be for me um yeah it pretty much I mean it doesn't

02:39:40.100 --> 02:39:43.820
play exactly like deep GTA but I mean there's a lot of similarities and I mean

02:39:43.820 --> 02:39:50.260
it's not as like intense as GTA I mean there's a lot of me it's more open world

02:39:50.260 --> 02:39:53.180
but there's not as much in the open world because obviously it's the Wild

02:39:53.180 --> 02:39:57.940
West not like a bustling city but it's awesome and it looks like graphics wise

02:39:57.940 --> 02:40:02.780
it's way better than GTA so it's pretty amazing I've ever GTA I was like wow

02:40:02.780 --> 02:40:06.660
look at that I can look across the you know the river and see all these

02:40:06.660 --> 02:40:10.380
different monuments and stuff like that and it just looks amazing so it'll be

02:40:10.380 --> 02:40:13.820
awesome yeah yeah GP I live in New York and I

02:40:13.820 --> 02:40:16.980
remember there was playing one multiplayer game and actually ran

02:40:16.980 --> 02:40:20.740
through a little section that actually used to hang out when I you know I used

02:40:20.740 --> 02:40:24.380
to hang out in that area when I was a kid and actually knew where to sneak

02:40:24.380 --> 02:40:28.220
around and avoid people and you know avoid getting shot that's kind of a

02:40:28.220 --> 02:40:36.140
creepy like I'm in a good way but that's Wow games are too realistic yeah I've

02:40:36.140 --> 02:40:41.620
taken up enough of your time no I love the show we love the call have a good

02:40:41.620 --> 02:40:45.940
one have a good night buddy all right all right some good calls tonight one

02:40:45.940 --> 02:40:50.460
eight seven seven game olr username on skype orange lounge radio act deaf in

02:40:50.460 --> 02:40:55.140
our chat room says I want a free copy of 3d dog game heroes I liked by the way I

02:40:55.140 --> 02:40:59.460
like that last caller's comparison to Lego Zelda I think was a great

02:40:59.460 --> 02:41:03.260
comparison that was funny and Donovan in chat says actually Lego Zelda sounds

02:41:03.260 --> 02:41:07.620
like it could be fun especially with the Lego game sense of humor I that comment

02:41:07.620 --> 02:41:11.140
actually kind of I think hits the nail on the head it's it's pretty pretty

02:41:11.140 --> 02:41:17.540
accurate let's see Donovan says hmm Lego Wow just as fun of a joke game says the

02:41:17.540 --> 02:41:23.340
guy who's all tabbing out of Wow to type in here addict Jamie you make friends

02:41:23.340 --> 02:41:27.260
with a lot of Wow addicts I gotta say I know what's up with that more people

02:41:27.260 --> 02:41:30.780
playing Star Trek online with me I still have the card I'm gonna use it at some

02:41:30.780 --> 02:41:34.620
point but probably after Memorial Day because if I use it now I've got too

02:41:34.620 --> 02:41:38.500
many trips coming up I'm going on two weekend trips back to back so I've got

02:41:38.500 --> 02:41:43.500
to calm down and actually spend time playing the game and then I got a three

02:41:43.500 --> 02:41:46.700
coming up to I got to worry about that I'm gonna be gone a week for that good

02:41:46.700 --> 02:41:51.180
times oil are at e3 we don't know what we're doing yet but we'll have the

02:41:51.180 --> 02:41:55.860
unfortunately it won't be Loki and Dark Sakura so we won't unfortunately be able

02:41:55.860 --> 02:41:59.940
to bring you something collectively unless maybe there's like some type of

02:41:59.940 --> 02:42:03.700
I don't know maybe we'll do something over Skype because you know Loki Dark

02:42:03.700 --> 02:42:07.560
Sakura will probably be able to follow the news almost better online than I

02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:10.140
will be being at the show but we are gonna hopefully bring you some cool

02:42:10.140 --> 02:42:14.220
interviews at the show at least that is the idea Loki do you have any other last

02:42:14.220 --> 02:42:21.260
minute stories over there that we can get to all we wait for some more calls

02:42:21.260 --> 02:42:24.940
this is kind of actually ties in a little bit with the last order talking

02:42:24.940 --> 02:42:29.700
about inappropriate games and of course you know leading the market of

02:42:29.700 --> 02:42:35.740
inappropriate games would be Japan and developer tea time is bringing new

02:42:35.740 --> 02:42:44.460
technology into the adult anime game franchise including they have the face

02:42:44.460 --> 02:42:50.020
tracking T cam technology will now they're working on hand tracking as well

02:42:50.020 --> 02:42:56.700
so you will be able to use the tall like accuracy to lift skirts and rip off

02:42:56.700 --> 02:43:02.980
shirts of anime women and they have some demo videos displaying such

02:43:02.980 --> 02:43:11.620
inappropriate but funny funny yes good stuff anything else for us tonight

02:43:11.620 --> 02:43:18.060
if escapes come in the ps3 that's kind of neat and this is kind of

02:43:18.060 --> 02:43:23.020
disappointing I guess but you know nowadays we have the internet the

02:43:23.020 --> 02:43:28.060
Nintendo power line is gonna be disconnected on June 1st fuck that was

02:43:28.060 --> 02:43:35.060
still open yeah is that the game counselors I think it is holy shit sorry

02:43:35.060 --> 02:43:38.340
to hear though that they'll be out of jobs I mean that kind of sucks but yeah

02:43:38.340 --> 02:43:43.980
I actually to be honest I didn't know you still existed sorry it was probably

02:43:43.980 --> 02:43:48.660
just one guy with his feet up on the desk not getting cut it's like Loki

02:43:48.660 --> 02:43:54.020
eating the sandwich I do that waiting for the call to come in I do that at

02:43:54.020 --> 02:43:59.020
work hey if I eat the sandwich at my desk before I go to lunch that's more

02:43:59.020 --> 02:44:05.220
time to play grant the thought of that's right anything else for us tonight Loki

02:44:05.220 --> 02:44:11.860
or dark Sakura I don't know yeah I'm debating doing something really addict

02:44:11.860 --> 02:44:18.100
II as long as it's not reactivating your Wow account no I'm considering finding

02:44:18.100 --> 02:44:20.980
a cheap digital download key for Star Trek online so that I can play a joint

02:44:20.980 --> 02:44:25.980
drill that is pretty uh but I get another 30 free days all right let's get

02:44:25.980 --> 02:44:28.940
to another call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey this is

02:44:28.940 --> 02:44:33.700
excellent x-link what's on your mind buddy never much I was just talking

02:44:33.700 --> 02:44:37.940
about the EA about the charging the extra 10 bucks for the sports games yes

02:44:37.940 --> 02:44:40.380
I'm surprised more people didn't want to talk about this what are your thoughts

02:44:40.380 --> 02:44:44.660
on this actually I do because I love playing the sports games from EA in fact

02:44:44.660 --> 02:44:49.460
I like playing all of them from time to time because it's a good way to calm

02:44:49.460 --> 02:44:53.100
down after having a bad day at work especially something like Tiger Woods or

02:44:53.100 --> 02:45:00.380
something though I don't condone what Tiger Woods did but whenever I think of

02:45:00.380 --> 02:45:05.540
the Tiger Woods game by EA I think of the way South Park portrayed it and I

02:45:05.540 --> 02:45:08.700
don't know if you saw that episode where they were like press X to slap him

02:45:08.700 --> 02:45:13.380
president actually they have a game out like that where somebody made one that

02:45:13.380 --> 02:45:17.820
was put basically Tiger Woods with Grand Theft Auto of course they do of course

02:45:17.820 --> 02:45:24.020
it okay obviously shit tons of people and yes that's a metric measure shit

02:45:24.020 --> 02:45:28.820
tons of people play these sports games even you know I I may kind of joke I

02:45:28.820 --> 02:45:31.620
don't know a lot about them but it's not like I've never played a sports game in

02:45:31.620 --> 02:45:35.260
my life I actually rather liked blades of steel thank you very much that was my

02:45:35.260 --> 02:45:40.860
jam back in the day double dribble double drip double dribble was badass I

02:45:40.860 --> 02:45:45.980
will totally buy NBA Jam when it comes out to well I will too that's gonna be a

02:45:45.980 --> 02:45:50.460
great game anyway so so yes so the sports games so what do you think are you

02:45:50.460 --> 02:45:57.140
pissed or you know seriously I don't go online that much to play online if I did

02:45:57.140 --> 02:46:01.380
I could see maybe paying the ten bucks but personally I could give to you know

02:46:01.380 --> 02:46:04.820
two shits about it because I don't really play it online that much if I did

02:46:04.820 --> 02:46:09.060
I played it once in a blue moon so I mean I'm more playing it just for like

02:46:09.060 --> 02:46:12.380
the season stuff for myself and see how well I can do at the team on on the

02:46:12.380 --> 02:46:16.220
teams then I do didn't play in online guess other people that I mostly

02:46:16.220 --> 02:46:20.900
probably end up cheating anyway so but um at ten bucks and they've really seen

02:46:20.900 --> 02:46:25.380
them much compared to so so like um somebody said earlier about you know so

02:46:25.380 --> 02:46:31.940
calm and it'd be in 20 bucks I mean you know it could be a lot worse I mean you

02:46:31.940 --> 02:46:37.060
know so I guess my worry is that if this works it's only gonna get worse that's

02:46:37.060 --> 02:46:40.980
my well it's gonna get worse no matter what I mean we got to think about a long

02:46:40.980 --> 02:46:44.540
run they're gonna nickel-dime us no matter what rather it be downloadable

02:46:44.540 --> 02:46:51.020
content where there be online play whether it be flying unicorns you know

02:46:51.020 --> 02:46:57.660
it it's going to always be something so but I I look at is it if I give them 10

02:46:57.660 --> 02:47:00.860
bucks they better have the servers running they better do it good and they

02:47:00.860 --> 02:47:04.540
better have it so I can connect to people without any lag or anything like

02:47:04.540 --> 02:47:08.140
that so I mean as long as they can do that kind of stuff I really don't see

02:47:08.140 --> 02:47:12.540
any kind of problems so they probably won't I mean they're not gonna change

02:47:12.540 --> 02:47:15.820
their service just because they're charging extra 10 bucks they think see

02:47:15.820 --> 02:47:18.580
the problem is they have all this download content that was out there in

02:47:18.580 --> 02:47:21.960
all these different ways that they were offering extra add-ons whether it be

02:47:21.960 --> 02:47:25.860
buying cheats or buying you know extra crap that you probably don't need for

02:47:25.860 --> 02:47:29.660
your sports games well that maybe wasn't working so well so now they're making

02:47:29.660 --> 02:47:35.660
you buy 10 you know download or I guess multiplayer online if you you know

02:47:35.660 --> 02:47:39.580
purchase the game used so that way they're getting you know some money for

02:47:39.580 --> 02:47:43.720
that you know used purchase versus no money but I really don't think they

02:47:43.720 --> 02:47:48.220
should be getting money for use purchase nowhere else in the industry any

02:47:48.220 --> 02:47:53.540
industry do people get money for a used purchase if I buy a used car don't to

02:47:53.540 --> 02:47:57.300
pay money to the manufacturer because they didn't sell me a new car too fucking

02:47:57.300 --> 02:48:02.060
bad yeah I totally agree on that and that's gonna give other people in our

02:48:02.060 --> 02:48:05.500
companies reason to do other stuff too and that could get out of control big

02:48:05.500 --> 02:48:10.060
time but you know if I wanted to coach and play online real bad too I might

02:48:10.060 --> 02:48:12.980
even look on eBay or something try to find a code on there to somebody's

02:48:12.980 --> 02:48:15.540
willing to sell somebody goes you know buy at the game going you know what I'm

02:48:15.540 --> 02:48:18.580
not gonna use their online I'm going to sell it I mean I don't see why they

02:48:18.580 --> 02:48:21.540
couldn't do that I mean I see that all the time with other downloadable stuff

02:48:21.540 --> 02:48:24.280
so that's a good point I mean maybe somebody doesn't really want to play

02:48:24.280 --> 02:48:27.500
online or doesn't really have the whole hookup to be able to play online so

02:48:27.500 --> 02:48:30.580
there's like hey I'm just gonna sell this code make a quick 10 bucks or 7

02:48:30.580 --> 02:48:33.940
bucks recoup some of the money and then between that and selling the game used

02:48:33.940 --> 02:48:37.580
in the first place make a little more money hey yeah precisely all right

02:48:37.580 --> 02:48:40.460
actually we gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show but thanks so much for

02:48:40.460 --> 02:48:46.060

02:48:46.060 --> 02:48:49.900
right now as we speak so all right thanks from what I from one addict to

02:48:49.900 --> 02:48:54.260
another good luck yeah thank you you're welcome I feel kind of bad I think I

02:48:54.260 --> 02:48:58.260
kind of got excellent cooked on that game like I feel like thank God I don't

02:48:58.260 --> 02:49:04.060
have to pay like ripper like you know like what pay like alimony or something

02:49:04.060 --> 02:49:07.860
like when I I ruin people's lives because of Warcraft I don't know all

02:49:07.860 --> 02:49:12.780
right anyhow we're gonna wrap it up and get to the post show and all the fun

02:49:12.780 --> 02:49:17.140
stuff so we got to go around though and get everybody's final thoughts before we

02:49:17.140 --> 02:49:20.660
close up shop and we'll start with dark Sakura this week dark soccer do you have

02:49:20.660 --> 02:49:28.340
any final thoughts boo don't be sad there'll be another all our next week ah

02:49:28.340 --> 02:49:32.140
actually I'm kind of thought for you up what brother brother brother brother

02:49:32.140 --> 02:49:34.380
brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother I have a

02:49:34.380 --> 02:49:37.060
final thought for you

02:49:40.780 --> 02:49:45.660
Loki do you have a final thought I have to see what animals or other animals I

02:49:45.660 --> 02:49:49.220
can skin in Red Dead Redemption it's too bad that you can't skin a human

02:49:49.220 --> 02:49:54.660
apparently human skin does not sell for much that would be Mortal Kombat right

02:49:54.660 --> 02:50:00.660
and my final thought is it is getting hot in here and I have to run errands on

02:50:00.660 --> 02:50:04.860
