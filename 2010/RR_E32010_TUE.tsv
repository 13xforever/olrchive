26721	27101	DarkSakura
43777	48760	and Loki due to other commitments and that stuff called real life were unable to join me at E3 this year.
48921	51342	But boy, what an E3 it's been.
51362	60949	You know, I got to say, so far, just even compared to, you know, being here last year, I'm so much more motivated by everything I'm kind of seeing on the show for this year.
61569	63951	Miklatov, you haven't been to the show in quite some time.
63991	68394	Tell the listeners a little bit about your last E3 and kind of like what you're thinking so far about this E3.
70420	75744	The last E3 I went to was E3 2006, otherwise known as Stupid.
77025	90596	It was crowded and you couldn't get in line for anything, except for like, you could get in line for the PS3 because nobody wanted to play it at that time, but like the Wii was impossible to get in line for, it was hot, it was cramped.
91256	94539	Absolutely hated it, really, but I kind of missed it, so.
95559	96900	What was the other thing I'm talking about?
97681	98822	How this year is better.
100155	101195	Oh, this year is better.
102396	103756	It's a little less crowded.
105216	126041	This year, last year that I went to, the companies were trying to outdo each other in terms of how loud they could be, but this year it's more like, hey, let's just show games and not really worry about, you know, if we're going to, you know, make the other booths vibrate because of how loud we are.
126401	127481	So it's nice.
128601	131822	All right, well, we'll get to a little bit about the kinds of stuff we've seen on the show floor.
132002	142227	And, you know, I'm kind of taking an approach with these little special shows that we're doing here that a lot of you guys that are listening to these and kind of taking the time out of your day are somewhat familiar already with what's going on at E3.
142287	147369	So I don't really want to sit here and just recap the news conferences that most of you probably watched live.
148298	154484	I do know we have some casual listeners of Orange Ones Radio who might be tuning into these podcasts as well, who maybe didn't watch the whole things.
155225	156586	Here's the basic stuff you need to know.
156866	172121	So what, Microsoft was first yesterday and they were basically blah blah blah, here's some games you already knew about that were coming, blah blah Gears of War 3, blah blah Fable 3, one new game kind of thrown in there for you and then, oh hey, here's Kinect and here's all this...
172725	199561	Connect stuff and boy this looks an awful lot like all the games that when Nintendo was first showing at E3 and for the Wii and all this but it's high def and oh my gosh you don't need controllers and da da da but most people kind of left feeling a little bit disappointed at least you know I'm reading Twitter I'm reading the blogs and I have to admit even I'm feeling a little bit disappointed with what I saw at Microsoft's press conference I'll explain my thoughts in a little bit Shane you sounds like you were disappointed too what was your problem with Microsoft's press conference?
200791	212861	There was nothing really surprising and that's the best part about E3 is all the shocking announcements and just the stuff that makes you want to buy these companies products and Microsoft showed off
213390	215411	The same stuff that they always show off.
215751	223316	First person shooters, an RPG that not many people seem to care about anymore, and then Nintendo products.
223756	233682	I'm like, okay, well, that sucks, and I'm sure everybody in the audience thought it sucked too, until they got a new 360, and then they probably hated it a little less.
235379	238682	It was very interesting, that little Oprah moment that they did kind of at the end there.
238702	240143	And you get a 360, and you get a 360.
240643	247669	And the fact that all of these new Xbox 360 Slims, as the internet is calling it, I don't believe Microsoft is calling it that, it's just the 360.
247729	258377	The Slim was a term that was used with the Sony systems, and they used that, but people are just carrying it over to the 360, incorrectly, I guess you could say.
259739	262761	But they gave all these things away, and they were like, oh yeah, they're going to be in stores this week.
264144	264484	I don't know.
264504	271028	I honestly was reading a lot of feedback on Twitter of people that were kind of pissed off that they just bought a 360 in the past couple months.
272488	276410	I just bought one not that long ago to replace one that had Red Ring of Death.
277151	278972	I'm not angry per se.
279372	285775	I don't really get this new slimmed down system and what it has to offer me that the one I already have doesn't.
285875	286775	I mean, yeah, I get it.
286795	289897	It has Wi-Fi, but I've already found a way to work around that.
290479	292360	and, you know, yeah, I get it.
292500	295742	It has the 250 gig hard drive, but I have yet to fill up the one I have.
296422	312691	I don't think this 360 Slim is so much for me as it is, you know, somebody new, I guess, coming on and perhaps this whole thing where, well, it's actually, it's going to work a little better with the whole Kinect thing, which I still keep, I'm tempted to call it Natal, I don't know.
313291	318955	But I did think it was weird that, you know, they're showing this whole thing and then they give everybody at the conference a free 360 and
320216	329801	To all the viewers at home just kind of sitting there going, oh, and then maybe they're double depressed because they just got a 360 not that long ago.
329961	330342	I don't know.
331062	332483	I apologize for my voice tonight, guys.
332523	338386	If you've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio, you know Jamie's been pretty sick lately, and I think I caught whatever she had.
338486	339907	So, yeah, there's that.
340927	343689	Anyhow, that was Microsoft in a nutshell.
343849	345850	So going over to Nintendo this morning.
346735	358148	Nintendo, in a nutshell, was basically, you know, Reggie comes out on stage, here's a new Wii game, and here's a new Wii game, and here's a new Wii game, and here's a new Wii game, and don't you ever talk bad about my system again.
359990	362593	And now here's Iwata to talk about 3DS a little bit.
363614	367198	And most people were actually pretty blown away by the Nintendo press conference.
367739	372761	I think they were very much improved, certainly over years past.
372861	379623	I think in watching what they did this year, where Reggie really came out and was just like game, game, game, game.
380083	384984	I really felt like he was doing what everybody wanted him to do a couple years ago.
385144	386885	What did you think about the press conference itself, Shay?
388152	408966	well I think it started off really poorly it started off like a Nintendo press conference where they feel like they can show just games for the casual market and then nobody else matters but then they brought out like Epic Mickey and then randomly Donkey Kong Country and that was cool and then
409646	417253	They stole the show, their own show I guess, with the 3DS and that was amazing.
418454	425519	Though it didn't dawn on me until just now, no vitality sensor whatsoever, so that's kind of funny.
426680	429303	It is very interesting some of the things they ended up not showing yet.
429343	433966	The Wii Relax just disappeared, it's vanished, it's not even to be seen on the show floor.
434027	435728	I guess it's just chilling out somewhere else.
436654	438255	And then Sony's press conference happened.
438395	442618	And then admittedly, I did not watch this one because we were already out on the show floor at this time.
443079	445280	Bobby was not able to join us tonight.
445340	447282	He's out at a party or something.
447302	447582	I don't know.
448362	451725	So I only kind of read about this on the internet.
451745	454467	But the general gist I'm getting is that people were kind of like...
455471	463335	Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, games, yeah, okay, oh, PlayStation Move, yeah, we all know you had to come out with motion controllers at some point.
463595	465616	Oh, here's Kevin Butler, oh, we like him.
465796	468858	Oh, motivational speech, oh, that guy's so funny, yay.
469298	472299	Oh, more PlayStation Move, but wait, how much does this fucking thing cost?
472560	473660	You gotta be kidding me.
474701	477502	Oh, okay, well, at least we finally have a date for Gran Turismo 5 and
478180	483484	Oh, Twisted Metal, and oh, hey, Valve is acknowledging the PlayStation 3 now.
483905	490610	I guess that's kind of cool, but also might explain the whole reason why the Portal 2 event got canceled and then subsequently delayed.
490690	493152	Because remember that event was supposed to happen Sunday night.
493592	500378	Well, if the big reveal was that Portal 2 was actually going to be this whole big PlayStation 3 thing, then you must...
500738	506901	kind of see that all those talks and what have you must have just come to pass within the past couple weeks.
507461	511262	You know, when this event got planned and then subsequently cancelled.
511342	514944	This Sony PS3 stuff must have literally just happened within the past couple weeks.
516405	519846	Shane, I know you didn't get to really see it either, but did you have anything you wanted to say about Sony's press conference?
521759	549544	I was once again kind of disappointed because I was really hoping for some shocking titles that people would care about like I don't know a new Uncharted would have been nice a new Jak and Daxter that's not that move heroes game but I think the most interesting thing definitely was the Valve on PS3 because you have to wonder how much money Sony threw at them to have Steam
550180	551721	on PS3 and not on 360.
552942	555605	And does that mean we'll get Left 4 Dead on PS3?
555665	559168	Does that mean we'll get all of those nice Valve games on PS3 now?
560188	565813	It is very interesting how Sony is kind of inching closer and closer to this PC thing.
565873	567535	Maybe it really is a computer after all.
568335	573760	You know, with the announcement of Steam now and then, you know, Final Fantasy XIV is a PC, PS3 title.
574020	577343	We've heard about things like DC Universe Online, which is supposed to be across, you know,
577813	579695	between PS3 and PC.
579735	580717	Yeah, and that's on the show floor.
581237	582179	Sadly, we haven't seen it yet.
582599	585643	So I said I wasn't going to talk your ear off about press conferences, but yeah, there we go.
585663	586844	We kind of ran down them real quick.
586884	588086	I hope that wasn't too much for you.
588547	597671	But what we really wanted to talk about here on the show is, you know, I know a lot of you guys at OLR are watching a lot of this on TV and listening to other podcasts and reading the news sites.
598071	605774	But we want to tell you a little bit about, like, you know, our perspective, what we kind of saw on the show floor today and what we played, which today sadly wasn't a lot.
605874	609776	We spent a lot of time standing in line.
611280	612240	We started the show today.
612260	617383	We decided we were going to make a dash to see the 3DS as fast as possible because we didn't have an appointment.
617743	623185	And we just thought, you know what, we'll just stand in the line and if we go there right when the show starts, we won't have to wait very long.
623766	631689	So right at noon, we get through the doors and, you know, considering we had been standing outside the doors for about 30 minutes beforehand, we had a pretty good spot.
632410	636592	And we got in there and already the booth was kind of around the corner of the line.
637152	639533	So we said, forget it, we'll get in line anyway.
640097	644202	Well, after about two hours, I would say we maybe moved.
646104	647626	We barely moved at all.
647666	652191	We maybe moved about 100 people in line in like a couple of hours.
652571	655255	It just felt like they were not burning through people at all.
655295	657918	And we were starting to get worried because we had a 3.30 appointment.
658899	659800	Well, thankfully...
660584	667671	Hero saved the day and thanks to some connections Shane has, we were able to actually end up getting to see the 3DS a little bit early.
668131	676959	So while we are very thankful to Shane's connections and so forth, it was awesome to get to see the 3DS and I'll let Shane talk about it a little bit here.
678080	680941	I did feel really bad for everybody else in line.
681461	682842	I mean, I did and I didn't.
682962	691265	I had another appointment I had to get to and so forth, but I felt Nintendo really should have been moving that line a lot quicker.
691825	692145	I don't know.
692645	694106	Shane, anything about the line?
695785	702186	Well, as is standard with Nintendo lines, it was far too long and poorly managed.
702747	713849	And I don't know if that's Nintendo's fault or the people they hired to stand and guard the lines, but it was pretty awful, to be expected though.
715389	722471	But yeah, we really have to give a big thanks to JC for helping us out there, letting us
723027	725568	See the system and make our appointment on time.
727529	728350	He's awesome.
728550	731691	He should be president of the company.
732792	733732	Yeah, so big thanks.
733812	738995	But again, in future years, I would really like to see them, I think at least...
740056	742819	Tell people what the estimated wait time is going to be.
743159	744980	Yeah, like a Disney ride or something.
745020	747062	Seriously, epic wait times or something.
747763	754448	Show us a realistic... Because all these people, it's not like people just showed up to the party.
754528	756550	Everybody here did have to qualify.
756610	759993	Maybe it wasn't as media, but everybody is tied to the industry somehow.
760433	762935	A lot of these people have friends back home.
763075	765998	It is kind of sad sometimes.
766397	769979	How much the media just really gets to kind of walk all over E3.
770019	773001	And I do realize, I do realize this is a press event.
773402	774883	It's a trade show and so forth.
775103	776444	And those are the people that have priority.
776484	782027	But, you know, we live in a day and age where, you know, Andy Warhol said everybody gets their 15 minutes.
782107	787171	You know, we've got a podcast and, you know, but lots of people have their YouTubes and their blogs and so forth.
787211	791453	And I just think, you know, there's probably going to be a lot of negative word of mouth about that line.
792194	792434	But
792853	795355	I guess the question would be, did it pay off?
795815	798877	When we got up there, what was the 3DS like?
798937	801039	I'll let Shane talk about the 3DS a little bit.
803100	806442	The 3DS is the second coming of handhelds by far.
807663	820972	I was kind of enthused to go see it today, had my reservations, but once I got up there, got to pick up the system, first thing we saw on it was a demo for Animal Crossing 3DS.
822706	823347	I was sold.
824890	831740	The 3D screen is only the top screen and it's just amazing looking.
831821	832842	It's sharp.
834705	835707	It looks like
836365	852845	you know there's depth back there and behind or in the gosh I'm so tired that the screen just has all this depth going in the back and you can adjust the slider on the side to make it not 3d bring it back down to 2d
853966	854346	I don't know.
854786	863649	For me, I used to hate 3D movies and all that, but now that I've seen the 3DS in action, it is a remarkable little system.
864329	865969	I'm not even sad about the screen size.
866089	874492	I have a DSi XL, and I swore I would never go back down to a smaller screen, but it's no big deal on the 3DS.
877412	884557	You know, I was very skeptical about this system because I have not been a fan of everything very much shifting to 3D recently.
885317	889760	Especially, you know, the movies, I don't have a good time because it kind of hurts my eyes and so forth.
890581	893923	And so I kind of get bothered when I see how, like, everything's going 3D.
894283	899747	But you know what, I'll tell you what, the 3DS was a pretty good looking system and I was a little worried at first.
900107	905271	Because when I first opened that thing up, and I played Animal Crossing first tour, well, we didn't get to really play it.
905371	905531	It was...
905911	910435	A lot, just so you guys know, there was a lot of concept videos, basically.
910475	914958	It's like we were watching a live rendering or whatever of Animal Crossing.
915399	916900	Or Mario Kart was another one.
916920	918661	Or there was, you know, a few that they had.
918701	924165	You didn't really get to play them, but it gave you a really good idea of what the games would look like on the system.
924806	926607	But Animal Crossing was the first thing I saw, too.
926988	933893	And I was like, you know, when I first opened it up and looked at it, I was like, oh, it's very similar to that stereoscopic effect like during Avatar and
934332	936593	Oh, this is going to hurt my eyes, and I don't know about this.
937013	940455	But then the gal pointed out you could use the slider to adjust.
940935	945158	And sure enough, if I turned it down about... Pardon my voice, everybody.
945198	945418	Sorry.
945458	949640	This is a video game podcast guy's worst nightmare during E3.
950721	957124	But if you turn that slider down about a quarter of the way, it was perfect, and it didn't bother my eyes anymore.
958065	968634	Maybe I didn't have the same amount of depth that Shane had, but I was able to get that 3D effect enough where something like Mario Kart looked pretty awesome with that whole 3D.
969474	970495	Here's the thing though, guys.
971196	974038	I am going to put on my skeptics hat a little bit here.
974418	977020	I'm going to say, don't jump out of your seat too high.
978021	979142	It's still a DS.
980022	983185	Yes, it has higher graphics processing power.
984216	989220	Yes, it's got these multitude of cameras and things that are going to let you see these 3D pictures.
989320	992682	But I think the 3D thing, it's a little bit of a gimmick.
993183	995344	Just like the whole motion control was a gimmick.
995764	1000528	And it's very important to note, things are not going to fly out of the screen at you.
1000568	1004891	I think one of the commercials showed the Nintendogs was lifting his paw out of the screen.
1005371	1006832	It's not that in your face.
1007693	1012056	The 3D effects are not going to like... It's a little tiny handheld, guys.
1012932	1014172	But it's subtle enough.
1014333	1019174	And the whole fact that you get that without glasses is pretty cool.
1019735	1024116	It's a very subtle but very noticeable effect that I think will have a big impact.
1024156	1029618	And I think where it's going to have an especially huge impact is the fact that the movies are there with no glasses.
1029978	1031579	That's going to be huge for kids.
1031659	1033960	The stuff they were showing, like the Disney movie, The Tangled.
1034760	1036641	That was one of your favorite things you saw, right, Shane?
1037685	1045532	Yeah, and one of the reasons why it was one of my favorite things I saw on the 3DS is because of the resolution on the screen.
1046292	1048054	It was amazing.
1048954	1055200	If you've seen any of those pre-rendered videos on DS, or even Game Boy Advance, they're all...
1055940	1061842	Blocky, really, really grainy, terrible, terrible looking videos.
1062342	1065323	But this, I swear, was like watching a DVD.
1065904	1067844	Or possibly a Blu-ray, I'm not sure.
1068905	1073626	But it was insane how smooth everything looked.
1074106	1084130	It was like watching a commercial or being in theaters and not seeing these blocky images, just seeing what the creators of the movie wanted you to see.
1084350	1084450	And
1085830	1113415	that alone is well no it's not alone but that is another reason why the 3DS is amazing and I can't I agree that it's a gimmick so far the 3D but I feel that with Nintendo handhelds they start off gimmicky and then you give them less than a year and that form of gameplay gimmick just works and everything they bring out for it just ends up being pretty cool
1115388	1122950	I'm not, you know, I understand Shane's enthusiasm, but I'm not like quite jump up and down screaming, oh my God, kind of like what Shane is.
1123030	1131851	But I will say what I did find actually almost more impressive than the system itself was just all the games they have lined up for it.
1131891	1140013	I mean, they already have huge franchises, Metal Gear, Kingdom Hearts, you know, and of course, all of Nintendo's franchises in there as well.
1140433	1144474	You know, all Saints Row, which got a laugh in the audience and all that.
1145939	1172079	all these people are so on board and I think that when we talk about the golden rule of gaming a game is only as good as the system it's clearly tied very late it's what 12.55 in the morning right now it's actually Wednesday so bear with us guys sorry it's professional radio at it's best but you know the whole golden rule that the system is only as good as the games that are on it dude there are tons of games coming out for the system
1173075	1182983	I still kind of have my whole little antsy thing with handhelds, but, big but here, the 3D is kind of, you know, it motivates me.
1183143	1186846	This is something I'm only going to get on a handheld that I'm not going to get on a TV.
1189167	1191909	I'm sold enough where I will probably pick one of these up when it comes out.
1191989	1196473	If for nothing else, there's a freaking Kid Icarus game coming out on it, probably a launch.
1198418	1201003	This is really going to have the games to back it up at the end of the day.
1201403	1204228	And if the 3D thing becomes too gimmicky, eh, turn it off.
1204609	1204809	Right?
1205834	1212139	Yeah, I mean, I think that was a brilliant move on Nintendo's part to be able to downgrade your 3D to just straight up 2D.
1213120	1221327	I'm assuming they'll require it of every game that comes out for it, but I think Nintendo played this one really well.
1221708	1233278	I'll be interested in seeing what they've held back from E3 about this system beyond the price and the release date, because you know there's something about it that they're just not telling us
1234697	1237238	I would like to hear a little more about the whole Wi-Fi.
1237278	1243379	I know they mentioned during the press conference it seemed like it could kind of be off and in your pocket, but it was still communicating.
1243800	1245560	But doesn't the DS kind of do that?
1245740	1248681	Except, oh, you have to have a game on, but you can have the lid shut.
1249161	1256703	I don't know if they're just expanding on that or what they're doing, but I am very curious to kind of hear more about the communications features.
1257318	1262560	Personally, I don't think we're going to see this thing until next year, but it'll probably be early next year.
1262660	1266101	Japan may have it this holiday, I don't know, but I kind of go back and forth.
1266161	1274684	It seems like the system has more development to go, but with all of these games already announced, it seems like, man, they've got a solid year's worth of games already.
1275876	1280501	I forgot to mention, there are two things I'm kind of disappointed with it.
1281682	1293915	The first one, the overall design, the look to the system, very DS, and I know it's called the 3DS, I was still hoping that was a working title.
1295436	1297038	But I don't know.
1297859	1299221	I've had some ADSs now.
1299261	1303025	I don't really feel like they should have gone with the same design.
1303425	1307670	And the cases, the metallic cases look very cheap.
1308831	1315479	When I saw it, it reminded me of my Power Rangers from when I was younger, my metallic ones.
1316059	1317982	Same exact sort of coding on it.
1318703	1321607	The second thing that I have a problem with is the D-pad.
1322248	1329677	I didn't actually mess with it because there was a playable demo we got, 8-bit Xavius, which we didn't mention.
1330799	1331740	That was pretty cool.
1332781	1359777	and I used the analog stick which was really nice but that d-pad if you're going to make backwards compatible ds games for it the d-pad is in a very awkward position that I don't think would feel right holding while playing but I think it's also important to note that a lot of this is still open change because like you know I remember being here what 04 when the ds first debuted and what they showed on the show floor was a lot different than what the finished prototype was so
1360818	1364903	We do have to take that into account with Shane's feedback that a lot of that could change.
1365223	1366664	What did you think of the analog stick, though?
1367085	1370188	It felt a little cheap to me, but again, I have to remember these are prototypes.
1370769	1372951	But I thought it was effective.
1373011	1374993	It was actually really easy to move around.
1375033	1377035	It didn't hurt like the PSP one does.
1378056	1381300	And that comes from the design of the stick.
1381520	1383202	It is concave.
1383755	1383915	Right?
1383955	1384495	That's the word?
1384555	1385436	Yeah, concave.
1386856	1389117	So your thumb fits in perfectly.
1389237	1391437	It's not flat like the PSP.
1391817	1400380	It's not rounded like, you know, Nintendo 64 or PlayStation or, well, I guess Xbox isn't, but Xbox just doesn't feel right anyway.
1402120	1407182	But it's just this big circle of an analog stick that your thumb fits in nicely.
1408123	1410225	It doesn't really move a lot.
1410245	1414629	It doesn't have a lot of space to move, but it gets the job done and is comfortable.
1414769	1422456	And I think, as Nintendo likes to do, they put their form factor on a high priority when designing these things.
1424518	1424798	All right.
1425359	1429042	If you guys have more questions about the 3DS, we'll try to answer whatever we can.
1429302	1433286	You can always send your questions to the mailbag, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
1434085	1448915	If you want us to talk about it on Sunday's show, or if you want us to try and get to it tomorrow on the Wednesday night show, www.twitter.com.olr is a great way to get a hold of us during the show.
1449015	1451376	I've been posting tons and tons and tons of pictures today.
1451857	1453978	Let's talk about some of the other stuff we observed today.
1455839	1461203	Miklatov, tell us a little bit about one of the games we just randomly ended up seeing and getting to spend a little time with.
1462304	1470892	Well, as we were walking to get food, I happened to see a booth that had Battlestar Galactica all over it.
1471512	1478098	And I remembered, hey, there is a web-based MMO coming out that probably will be awful.
1478959	1480401	So we have to go see it, of course.
1481181	1481742	We go over there.
1482422	1484966	Ask the guy if they have time for a little press interview.
1485726	1497320	Gives us a nice room with, I don't have their names with me at the moment, but one of the head guys heading up the Battlestar MMO from Big Point.
1498302	1499623	Yeah, just leave it at bigpoint.com.
1501144	1502485	Yeah, what he said.
1503886	1512974	And they kind of talked to us about their company and what they were doing with the Battlestar Galactica free web MMO.
1513034	1518558	And they gave us a nice little tour of the pre-alpha is what they were calling it version.
1519359	1526125	And holy crap, this might be the first Battlestar Galactica game that I would not feel bad about playing.
1526905	1527825	It looked beautiful.
1527865	1530106	They really captured the essence of the show.
1531506	1537147	They did say they are working with the creative team from Battlestar Galactica on this.
1537707	1539527	It's a very joint venture.
1541348	1543068	But, I don't know.
1543528	1545288	I'm interested in playing it.
1545328	1547449	They're shooting for a winter release.
1548389	1553810	And they said that they'd have more details like, you know, cast announcements at Comic-Con, which...
1554510	1557993	Sucks, because that is next month and not today.
1558013	1560754	I would love more information on this game.
1561735	1569660	Yeah, again, what we saw was very, very early, and I kind of went in with a lot of the same skepticism that Shane had about, oh, yay, a web browser-based MMO.
1569700	1571121	I'm sure this is going to be a real winner.
1571541	1576705	And we went in, and we were like, I have to admit, I was kind of like, wow, these graphics.
1576825	1577045	I mean,
1577594	1579674	Have I seen better graphics on a PC game?
1579734	1579994	Sure.
1580315	1586696	But for a web-based, no-download, free MMO, I was like, that's actually pretty darn good.
1587936	1592277	And free is definitely a good price, so I will definitely check out the full version when it comes out.
1592637	1596558	I'm not huge on space combat games, but it sounds like there's more to come on this.
1596958	1602499	I like Battlestar enough, and again, just to at least look at the graphics a little bit and see if I can actually steer the ship.
1604607	1607828	Let's talk a little bit about... I'll mention this real quick.
1608068	1612689	We did go by Konami's booth for a little bit and saw their dance game that they have on Kinect.
1613450	1617271	There's two dance games now for Kinect, and I'm having a hard time telling them apart.
1617311	1625153	There's Dance... Dance Masters is Konami, and then Dance... Dance Central is the Harmonix one.
1625193	1625453	Okay.
1625693	1629134	We'll get to Dance Central in a little bit, but I did look at a little bit of Dance Masters.
1631134	1632815	Guys, I think this is where DDR's going.
1633355	1633575	Like,
1634418	1638540	To me, there was a lot of very DDR-ish elements in the game.
1639301	1655589	For those longtime Dance Dance Revolution fans, the song list, at least the few songs they had in this game, you had a Naoki song, you had a SmileDK song, you had a transplant from Para Para Paradise, you know, complete with the same dance, which is making a lot of people compare this game to Para Para Paradise.
1656409	1659311	I think the game might be more accurately compared to Itoi Groove.
1659351	1663673	It was kind of like you kind of move your hands around and then you pose and all this stuff.
1664864	1675206	which is ironic because Kinect, in a way, the whole thing really feels like what we all thought the eye toy was going to be capable of years ago but just really couldn't pull off technically.
1675826	1680067	But this new technology is allowing it to be a lot more fluid or what have you.
1680487	1682748	But I will say I have not played the game yet.
1682828	1684668	I hope to a little later on.
1684708	1693290	But I was floored at first because I kind of took a step back and I was like, wow, it even like perfects are in yellow and greats are in green and a lot of the engine and combos.
1693697	1717346	I was like, this seems to be, and Naoki was there, he seems to be kind of behind it This might be the direction that DDR is going Funny enough, no DDR on the 360 or PS3 to be found All the DDR that was on the floor was for the Wii So, take that as you will Let's move on to one of the dance games we did play, Dance Central What did you think about this game?
1718684	1724666	Well, I saw it at the Microsoft press conference on the TV, and I was sold.
1725106	1725986	It's Harmonix.
1726526	1727667	It's going to be amazing.
1727687	1728887	That's what Harmonix does.
1730127	1734348	But I didn't really understand how great it would be until we actually got to play it today.
1735309	1741951	And it doesn't feel like a video game, and that's probably what makes it so interesting to play.
1742631	1746612	It is a dance teaching game.
1747065	1775274	it's definitely an exercise style game but it's really fun and you start you know when you first play you kind of feel dorky playing it but then you just really get into it and it's it's not one of those games that I would be too embarrassed to play in front of people like you know you might be when you play DDR for a while or when you play any dancing game in the arcade or you know or any rhythm game period
1776784	1782408	I could see this being a great, great teacher for people that want to start to learn to dance.
1782929	1792555	And I think that was a genre that was sorely lacking in video games because DDR doesn't teach you to dance.
1793016	1794357	Pump It Up doesn't teach you to dance.
1796098	1802002	Yeah, but the Dance Masters game, it might not be teaching you to dance, but it kind of seemed like... No, no, the other one.
1802042	1803023	I'm talking about the Konami game.
1804250	1811332	It may not be teaching you to dance per se, but it definitely kind of looked a lot more like real dance, especially if you were kind of mimicking the dancers on the screen.
1811772	1820195	Whereas I think kind of the key difference was that the other game, the Harmonix game, Dance Central, is more about kind of like a choreographed dance that you're learning.
1820595	1824536	You know, and you can kind of put together and you learn this very choreographed dance as you go.
1825076	1827737	But, you know, I think this is going to be Kinect's niche.
1827857	1829737	And this should be no surprise to you.
1830157	1832138	I talked about this on the show a little while ago.
1832847	1834267	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1849651	1864795	As much as it made a lot of us grimace at Microsoft's press conference, I think that's what's going to ultimately get them the most CNN coverage and Oprah coverage and start to kind of nip at the heels of what Nintendo's doing because of the fact that it's just a camera.
1866795	1869716	and this could be something they start implementing in schools too.
1870336	1881121	They would only have to buy one thing for it besides the system and that's an investment that they could easily tailor towards the kids for their physical activities.
1882581	1890565	I will say I was pleasantly surprised at how responsive the game was and you could kind of see the silhouette of yourself and it didn't look like a lot of stray pixels were getting in there.
1891425	1896367	The lighting where we were at was even a little bit dark although we did have a clear background so
1897476	1898916	My interest is definitely peaked.
1899497	1902757	I really want to see how this plays out as well in my living room.
1903158	1905938	Although my living room might be a little cramped for Dance Central, I don't know.
1908699	1917141	It was interesting to look at, I gotta say, and actually play and to get up there and dance to Poker Face and then actually get a five star on the song.
1917756	1927924	You know, when I didn't really know what I was doing, but it kinda showed me enough where, you know, having played enough rhythm games before, I was kinda able to get the hang of it real quick.
1928104	1928484	It was cool.
1929205	1929846	How about Rock Band 3?
1930266	1931287	Tell us a little bit about Rock Band 3.
1933327	1934288	Rock Band 3 was cool.
1936690	1937971	It was Rock Band.
1938431	1946917	I got to play guitar, so I was playing the same instrument we've played for the past two games.
1947778	1953242	Nothing very exciting for me personally when we did the demo.
1953717	1957919	It was cool to have so many people on our little stage, though, all playing together.
1958399	1961480	That was probably the best part for me.
1962221	1963641	Oh, and the guitar was blue.
1964161	1966322	So, I was very happy about that.
1967483	1973205	But, you know, you got to play the keyboards, and I didn't get to really mess with those.
1973345	1978748	And that's the most important part about Rock Band 3 from the demo, so I will give it back to you.
1979848	1980810	The keyboards were cool.
1981150	1985896	I did misstate something in an earlier program that we learned a little more about today.
1986516	1992583	When you're playing in five bar mode, the keyboard is not split into five different sections as it looks like it is.
1993164	1995647	That is for the pro mode basically only.
1995867	1996728	I'm not sure why.
1996808	1999612	I don't know why it kind of sections it off the way it does.
1999972	2000132	ProModes
2022657	2041123	I mean I don't know anything about playing the guitar but watching that guy in the demo was playing that White Stripes song and like I think at one point they kind of like double jacked him so that he was in the Xbox 360 and he was in an amp and he was playing like the real song that was really cool what he was doing was going above my head because I know nothing about playing the guitar
2041894	2047101	But I do know how to play, at least I did when I was a little kid, the piano or keyboard.
2047501	2052928	And it's really exciting that I could probably learn the quote-unquote real songs.
2054366	2058628	I do like the fact that they confirmed today that there will be a Pro Mode for bass.
2059648	2072333	It had been rumored that Pro Mode was coming to the guitar, the drums, and the keyboards, but they were skipping out on bass because bass gets so little love from anybody, it seems.
2073994	2080216	And the new Pro instruments, I don't think that's what they're called, but that's what I'm calling them, with the $150 guitar and whatnot.
2082637	2083618	That was amazing.
2084078	2092644	That is definitely taking their music games and setting it apart from anything else anybody's doing.
2094766	2101851	They're investing so much into this genre that we can only respect them for it, I think.
2103479	2108924	It sounds like they're making a lot of very interesting changes with the single player mode too that I'm kind of curious to see how that plays out.
2109825	2112047	They didn't give us a lot of details on all that today.
2112087	2120294	They kind of talked about it, but it seems like they're going to trickle a little more and a little more kind of up to the release of the game, including more info on the character creation mode and so forth.
2120694	2125659	But I will say this, it was great to hear that pretty much everything is backwards compatible.
2126161	2128703	Not the Beatles, but I think everybody pretty much expected that.
2128743	2131206	But, you know, the Lego Rock Band, everything could come in.
2131226	2133328	They have a whole new way for you to pick songs.
2133708	2135369	That includes filtering your list.
2135490	2140854	So if you just want to look at, you know, Lego songs or you want to look at songs with a certain difficulty, it seems to be a lot more fluid.
2140874	2147400	They made a lot of improvements to the interface, including, you know, people kind of jumping in and out and having quicker play sessions.
2148762	2152485	I was pretty enticed by what they're doing with the setup there.
2153396	2155177	Wow, I'm really losing my voice, guys.
2155517	2161560	I'm so sorry, but I do want to at least try to talk a little bit with you guys about what we saw today.
2162180	2167222	Those were pretty much the games we spent real quality time with.
2167262	2174545	Really got to sit down and play extensively, but we kind of got to look over shoulders and kind of see some other games.
2174586	2177787	I quickly saw the OnLive system.
2178450	2183952	I was like, if that is really streaming in that little box, that looks a lot better than I anticipated.
2184892	2189374	I know Bobby's going to spend some time with that, so maybe when he's here tomorrow, he'll tell us a little more about that.
2190014	2192495	I did see the Tron games, which look kind of cool.
2192916	2200398	The one I was looking at was a Wii bike, or like a bike, the light cycles thing on the Wii, but it looked like there was a 360 one too.
2200438	2202259	I didn't really get to get close enough with.
2202299	2204300	Hopefully tomorrow I'll get to get in there a little closer.
2205172	2207876	to see a little bit of Dead Rising 2, which kind of looked exciting.
2209038	2216228	I'm hoping tomorrow I can look at Sony Move and actually get my hands on it so I can feel like I'm speaking the Sony side a little more with authority.
2216248	2219233	I don't know, anything that just kind of caught your eye as we were walking around?
2221027	2223670	Well, I will actually go to the opposite of that.
2223770	2230416	I will say what did not catch my eye, which would be games that I expected to be there and didn't actually show.
2231457	2235561	Quite disappointed that Nintendo did not bring the new Pokemon games here.
2235921	2242448	They did have one on Wii, and they did have a Pokemon Ranger for DS, but no black and white.
2243148	2251795	I'm hoping that's because they will switch it up and instead of it being a DS game, they bring it to the 3DS.
2252876	2255258	Because I assume we'll get the 3DS by...
2255988	2259651	Our release date of Spring 2011 for Pokemon.
2261113	2265156	I was very disappointed with walking through EA and not seeing Dragon Age 2.
2265977	2273503	They have already set a teaser release date for it, so I don't see why they couldn't have at least shown it in video form.
2273703	2275285	Maybe it was behind closed doors.
2276245	2280049	Konami, not having a Silent Hill up there to show.
2280569	2282550	That was very, very upsetting.
2282871	2294159	However, they kind of countered it with having a Glee karaoke revolution, which I will hopefully be playing tomorrow because I love me some Glee.
2295720	2301604	It's kind of one of those things where when I saw it, I kind of rolled my eyes and said, how did I not see that one coming?
2302679	2312702	Oh, was it just today we were talking about how come nobody picked up a Glee license before we got to Konami and then it was there?
2313362	2313902	You know what it was?
2313942	2316323	Somebody was making a joke like at Ubisoft's press conference.
2316343	2321424	I think somebody had said something like, oh, gee, it's so funny that Ubisoft didn't roll out like a Glee game.
2321464	2327306	I don't know why they're... Yeah, yeah, you said that and then suddenly we're at Konami's booth and, oh, well, they have the license for the Glee game apparently.
2328379	2337241	but I mean it makes sense now they rebooted the karaoke franchise by dropping American Idol and instead they're picking up yet another Fox show.
2337821	2342302	Why can't Dance Masters be So You Think You Can Dance Masters or something like that?
2344163	2347264	I think these tie-ins would go great for Konami.
2347364	2352205	I kind of hope they start doing a little bit better and quit putting out some crap titles.
2354046	2356107	What else caught my eye while we were walking around?
2356868	2360431	Oh, I didn't see Child of Eden at Ubisoft.
2360471	2369677	I was really hoping for that, especially now hearing that you don't need the Move Controller, you don't need the Kinect camera to play.
2369757	2376622	They are going to let you use the regular controls, so not having a demo up or anything was kind of depressing.
2379224	2381646	Yeah, I think... I didn't really get to see much.
2381686	2384127	I mean, we completely skipped over Namco today.
2386169	2387990	I want to try to find Valve if Valve is around.
2388010	2388810	I want to play Portal.
2389931	2392533	Disappointed that Activision thinks they're too good for a booth.
2392753	2394194	I don't think Portal's on the show floor.
2395621	2401065	Oh, I'm sad that Valve thinks they're too good for a booth.
2402206	2413955	Yeah, it's a very much scaled down version of the E3 I'm used to, so little disappointments here and there, but at the same time there's been some really cool stuff just from the first day.
2415069	2416550	I don't think it's really scaled down.
2416610	2418512	I think this is kind of like the just right size.
2418552	2420434	Like 2006 was too much.
2420514	2433406	I think this year is, you know, and with last year, even though what was being shown to me wasn't as impressive last year because everything was still a concept last year, I'm relatively happy with the way this year is going so far.
2434355	2441361	I would be happy if Kentia Hall was back and had all the really crappy games and the really awesome games that nobody cares about.
2443022	2444504	But, I don't know.
2445304	2451690	I kind of miss the old big spectacle E3 just because it was so neat.
2453051	2454452	I don't know, it still feels like a spectacle.
2456151	2456811	Skeptical?
2456891	2458032	What am I saying?
2458452	2460692	God, it still feels like a big spectacle to me, Shane.
2460732	2461813	I don't know.
2462853	2464473	It's been many of these now.
2465354	2471455	Maybe it would feel like a big spectacle to me if we didn't have to wait in line for half the day.
2472816	2473056	Yeah.
2474516	2475336	And one other thing.
2475596	2481278	It is still very disappointing just how much of the show is still...
2482108	2489914	Make an appointment, or only special people can get in here, and everything's behind these walls and so forth.
2489974	2497699	It's kind of like, I don't know, to a lot of people who do, you know, fly out to be here and all that stuff, it's just kind of like, it's a big disappointment.
2499293	2502256	If they're going to do stuff like that, they need to make it media only.
2502336	2509982	I see people with exhibits only badges or even the people that are exhibitors.
2510162	2512785	They can't get to all the stuff that's behind closed doors.
2512865	2515006	It's just media that have appointments.
2516908	2518389	I don't see what the point of that is.
2518489	2522633	You're not getting your product out to everybody that you possibly can.
2523574	2525415	That's just dumb to me by far.
2526676	2527217	You know, I don't...
2528522	2556381	I don't really care who is the super special club or what have you I just don't think it should be so out in everyone else's faces that like you know oh these people are coming back here but you're not you know type of thing like that's why they have meeting rooms in these other places you know use the booth space to show those things you want to show out in the open and have more places for people to walk around so that the show doesn't feel as cramped even though there's less people here I think that's kind of really the point I'm trying to get to is that just don't be so
2557595	2558396	and so on.
2580791	2586713	Going back to 2006, I think there was a lot of that in 2006, too, which caused that show floor to just be packed.
2586953	2588634	Because there's no place for people to go.
2589514	2597818	Gotta say, though, that the stuff I've seen that's closed for, you know, appointments that have already been made, mostly stuff I don't care about.
2597938	2600179	So I'm not too bummed about it.
2600219	2604500	The only thing that kind of got me sad was Final Fantasy XIV being closed off.
2605821	2608722	But hey, we have an appointment for it, so it's all good.
2610256	2614077	Alright, yeah, so we'll be bringing you more information on that coming on Thursday.
2614737	2617798	Anyway, we're just going to start to wrap up for tonight because it's getting very late.
2617818	2618959	It's probably after 1 a.m.
2620239	2626621	If you want to ask us questions or give any feedback, twitter.com slash OLR is really the place to get to us over the next few days.
2626641	2629862	The thing you're most looking forward to seeing tomorrow, Shane?
2631551	2633993	Oh, that is not where I thought you were going with that.
2635815	2636115	You know what?
2636635	2638097	It's not necessarily a thing.
2638657	2643181	I think I'm really interested in hanging out and spending some time with the Sega booth.
2644222	2645783	I want to see the new Sonic games.
2646303	2648925	I want to see the localized Phantasy Star Portable.
2650207	2656572	And even though Bobby said it was terrible, I would love to see the monkey ball on the iPad and see how awful it is.
2658361	2661925	I'm looking forward to just getting some hands-on time with the PlayStation Move hopefully.
2662145	2667671	I'd like to kind of go in and give that a try because I'm hearing a lot about how it feels a little more accurate than the Wii does.
2669713	2677821	As far as the press conference goes, I wasn't hearing about a lot of games that I feel like I need to get, but I'd be curious to go get my hands on it and see if it changes my mind.
2677901	2680164	I think that's one of the top things I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
2681187	2709943	I think it might be worth braving the Nintendo booth again tomorrow to maybe see Zelda, because I don't know what the videos are like online, but that game was running flawlessly, it looked 60 frames a second, it was beautiful, and I would like to try Kirby Epic Yarn or whatever it's called, and the Donkey Kong Country game, because that is amazing looking, it looks just like Donkey Kong Country and sounds like Donkey Kong Country.
2711084	2716528	Alright, so yeah, tomorrow we're going to really try to not stand in as many lines and just play as many games as possible.
2717149	2724614	So we'll see what we can do and we'll be back tomorrow with Bobby will be here with us and thank you for sitting through our special.
2724654	2736804	I know it's a lot different than a regular edition of Orange Lounge Radio but again, we kind of want to get all that out there while we're still thinking about it and of course I'll be joined with DarkSakura and Loki again live this Sunday on Orange Lounge Radio.
2736844	2739926	We'll be talking about a lot of this same stuff
2740600	2747359	but, you know, Loki and DarkSakura kind of have a different point of observation and then, of course, you guys in chat and all that other stuff.
2747399	2749164	It's going to be a fun show on Sunday.
2750243	2760012	I also think it would be great if we get some suggestions for things to see on Thursday because we won't be able to read them, I'm sure, tomorrow in time for when we go.
2760673	2770462	But our Thursday is pretty open except for Final Fantasy, so maybe there's something that some people would like to hear about that we may have accidentally skipped.
2772142	2772723	Absolutely.
2772823	2776086	So yeah, again, contact us at twitter.com slash OLR.
2776106	2777488	You can try to send us emails too.
2777528	2781232	I can't guarantee we can get those as fast because we can do the Twitter thing right there on my phone.
2781512	2782133	It's very easy.
2782593	2783935	So okay, that's it.
2783955	2784876	We're going to wrap up for tonight.
2785056	2786157	It's well after 1 a.m.
2786297	2788039	I need to upload this and go to bed.
2788179	2792644	So this is Rob Roberts at E3, Orange Lounge Special Edition.
2793245	2793465	All right.
2793505	2794246	Have a great night, everybody.
