0	11120	Hey guys, it's Rob Roberts, and welcome to a special show here on our feed at OrangeloungeRadio.com.
11120	16000	It's Rob Roberts and Pals here at E3 2010, or I guess more appropriately tonight it's
16000	20520	really Rob Roberts and Pal, as I'm joined by the one and only, you heard him on this
20520	21920	last week's show, Miklotov.
21920	26320	Hello, woah, I tried to grab the mic, that didn't work out.
26320	31240	Yeah, it's been a very exhausting, very long day, and first off I want to apologize for
31240	36600	the audio quality, we are on a different little portable kit, so the audio quality sadly is
36600	40480	not quite what you're used to hearing in studio, and of course hopefully you've been listening
40480	45220	to the show the past few weeks, unfortunately Dark Sakura and Loki, due to other commitments
45220	50080	and that stuff called real life, were unable to join me at E3 this year, but boy, what
50080	55960	an E3 it's been, you know, I gotta say, so far, just even compared to being here last
55960	61280	year, I'm so much more motivated by everything I'm kind of seeing on the show for this year.
61280	64720	Miklotov, you haven't been in the show in quite some time, tell the listeners a little
64720	70400	bit about your last E3 and kind of like, what you're thinking so far about this E3.
70400	77000	The last E3 I went to was E3 2006, otherwise known as Stupid.
77000	82360	It was crowded and you couldn't get in line for anything, except for like, you could get
82360	86320	in line for the PS3 because nobody wanted to play it at that time, but like the Wii
86320	92120	was impossible to get in line for, it was hot, it was cramped, I absolutely hated it
92120	97720	really, but I kind of missed it, so, what was the other thing I'm talking about?
97720	100360	How this year is better.
100360	110920	This year is better, it's a little less crowded, this year, last year that I went to, the companies
110920	114960	were trying to outdo each other in terms of how loud they could be, but this year it's
114960	120520	more like, hey, let's just show games and not really worry about, you know, if we're
120520	127200	going to, you know, make the other booths vibrate because of how loud we are, so it's
127200	128200	nice.
128200	132120	Alright, we'll get to a little bit about the kinds of stuff we've seen on the show floor,
132120	135200	and you know, I'm kind of taking an approach with these little special shows that we're
135200	138600	doing here, that a lot of you guys that are listening to these and kind of taking the
138600	142360	time out of your day are somewhat familiar with already with what's going on at E3, so
142360	146680	I don't really want to sit here and just recap the news conferences, the most you probably
146680	147680	watch live.
147680	152080	I do know we have some casual listeners of Horizontal's Radio who might be tuning into
152080	156160	these podcasts as well, who maybe didn't watch the whole things, here's the basic stuff you
156160	157160	need to know.
157160	161320	So what, Microsoft was first yesterday, and they were basically, blah blah blah, here's
161320	165080	some games you already knew about that were coming, blah blah Gears of War 3, blah blah
165080	171160	Fable 3, one new game kind of thrown in there for you, and then, oh, hey, here's Kinect,
171160	175960	and here's all this Kinect stuff, and boy, this looks an awful lot like all the games
175960	180120	that Nintendo was first showing at E3, and for the Wii and all this, but it's high def,
180120	184360	and oh my gosh, you don't need controllers, and da da da, but most people kind of left
184360	188320	feeling a little bit disappointed, at least, you know, I'm reading Twitter, I'm reading
188320	191840	the blogs, and I have to admit, even I'm feeling a little bit disappointed with what I saw
191840	196720	at Microsoft's press conference, I'll explain my thoughts in a little bit, Shane, it sounds
196720	200880	like you were disappointed too, what was your problem with Microsoft's press conference?
200880	206120	There was nothing really surprising, and that's the best part about E3, is all the shocking
206120	211360	announcements and just the stuff that makes you want to buy these companies' products,
211360	217200	and Microsoft showed off the same stuff that they always show off, first person shooters,
217200	224040	an RPG that not many people seem to care about anymore, and then Nintendo products, and I'm
224040	228880	like, okay, well, that sucks, and I'm sure everybody in the audience thought it sucked
228880	234120	too, until they got a new 360, and then they probably hated it a little less.
234120	238520	You know, it was very interesting, that little Oprah moment that they did kind of at the
238520	242240	end there, and you get a 360, and you get a 360, and the fact that all of these new
242240	246920	Xbox 360s slim, as the internet is calling it, I don't believe Microsoft is calling it
246920	247920	that.
247920	248920	It's just the 360.
248920	252960	The slim was a term that was used with the Sony systems, and they used that, but people
252960	260280	were just carrying it over to the 360, uncorrectly, I guess you could say, but they gave all these
260280	264080	things away, and they were like, oh, yeah, they're going to be in stores this week, and
264080	267440	I don't know, I honestly was reading a lot of feedback on Twitter of people that were
267440	272400	kind of pissed off that they just bought a 360 in the past couple months, and I mean,
272400	277040	I just bought one not that long ago to replace one that had Red Ring of Death.
277040	282800	I'm not angry, per se, I just, I don't really get this new slimmed down system, and what
282800	287160	it has to offer me that the one I already have doesn't, I mean, yeah, I get it, it has
287160	292520	Wi-Fi, but I've already found a way to work around that, and you know, yeah, I get it,
292520	296360	it has the 250 gig hard drive, but I have yet to fill up the one I have.
296360	303000	I don't think this 360 slim is so much for me as it is, you know, somebody new, I guess,
303000	307600	coming on, and perhaps this whole thing where, well, it's actually, it's going to work a
307600	311440	little better with the whole connect thing, which I still keep, I'm tempted to call it
311440	315340	Natal, I don't know, but I did think it was weird that, you know, they're showing this
315340	321280	whole thing, and then they give everybody at the conference a free 360 to, you know,
321280	326040	all the viewers at home just kind of sitting there going, oh, and then maybe they're double
326040	331640	depressed because they just got a 360, not that long ago, I don't know, I apologize for
331640	335960	my voice tonight, guys, if you've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio, you know, Jamie's
335960	340920	been pretty sick lately, and I think I caught whatever she had, so yeah, there's that.
340920	347200	Anyhow, that was Microsoft in a nutshell, so going over to Nintendo this morning, Nintendo
347200	351960	in a nutshell was basically, you know, Reggie comes out on stage, here's the new Wii game,
351960	356200	and here's the new Wii game, and here's the new Wii game, and here's the new Wii game,
356200	360080	don't you ever talk bad about my system again.
360080	364960	And now here's Iwata to talk about 3DS a little bit, and most people were actually pretty
364960	371520	blown away by the Nintendo press conference, I think they were very much improved, certainly
371520	377020	over years past, I think in watching what they did this year, where Reggie really came
377020	382520	out, it was just like game, game, game, game, I really felt like he was doing what everybody
382520	386880	wanted him to do a couple years ago, what'd you think about the press conference itself,
386880	387880	Shay?
387880	393080	Well, I think it started off really poorly, it started off like a Nintendo press conference,
393080	401000	where they feel like they can show just games for the casual market, and then nobody else
401000	407560	matters, but then they brought out like Epic Mickey, and then randomly Donkey Kong Country,
407560	416080	and that was cool, and then they stole the show, their own show I guess, with the 3DS,
416080	424160	and that was amazing, though it didn't dawn on me till just now, no vitality sensor whatsoever,
424160	426720	so that's kind of funny.
426720	430220	It is very interesting some of the things they ended up not showing out, the Wii Relax
430220	434220	just disappeared, it's vanished, it's not even to be seen on the show floor, I guess
434220	438520	it's just chilling out somewhere else, and then Sony's press conference happened, and
438520	442280	then admittedly I did not watch this one because we were already out on the show floor at this
442280	450520	time, Bobby was not able to join us tonight, he's out at a party or something, I only kind
450520	453800	of read about this on the internet, but the general gist I'm getting is that people were
453800	460860	kind of like, oh okay, yeah, games, yeah, okay, PlayStation Move, yeah, we all know
460860	465040	you had to come out with a motion controller at some point, oh, here's Kevin Butler, oh
465040	470120	we like him, motivational speech, oh that guy's so funny, yay, and more PlayStation
470120	475520	Move, wait, how much does this fucking thing cost, you gotta be kidding me, oh okay, well
475520	481680	at least we finally have a date for Gran Turismo 5, and oh Twisted Metal, and oh, hey, Valve
481680	486200	is acknowledging the PlayStation 3 now, I guess that's kind of cool, but also might
486200	490240	explain the whole reason why the Portal 2 event got cancelled and then subsequently
490240	494480	delayed, because remember that event was supposed to happen Sunday night, well if the big reveal
494480	500680	was that Portal 2 was actually gonna be this whole big PlayStation 3 thing, then you must
500680	505840	kind of see that all those talks and what have you must have just come to pass within
505840	511400	the past couple weeks, you know, when this event got planned and then subsequently cancelled,
511400	515800	because this Sony PS3 stuff must have literally just happened within the past couple weeks,
515800	518280	I don't know, Shane, I know you didn't get to really see it either, but did you have
518280	521600	anything you wanted to say about Sony's press conference?
521600	528920	I was once again kind of disappointed, because I was really hoping for some shocking titles
528920	533200	that people would care about, like, I don't know, a new Uncharted would have been nice,
533200	541760	a new Jak and Daxter, that's not that move heroes game, but I think the most interesting
541760	547720	thing definitely was the Valve on PS3, because you have to wonder how much money Sony threw
547720	554520	at them to have Steam on PS3 and not on 360, and does that mean we'll get Left 4 Dead on
554520	559560	PS3, does that mean we'll get all of those nice Valve games on PS3 now?
559560	565920	It is very interesting how Sony is kind of inching closer and closer to this PC thing,
565920	571000	maybe it really is a computer after all, you know, with the announcement of Steam now,
571000	574800	and then, you know, Final Fantasy XIV is a PC, PS3 title, we've heard about things like
574800	580240	DC Universe Online, which was supposed to be between PS3 and PC, yeah, and that's on
580240	582680	the show floor, sadly we haven't seen it yet.
582680	585700	So I said I wasn't going to talk you off about press conferences, but yeah, there we go,
585700	589040	we kind of ran down them real quick, I hope that wasn't too much for you, but what we
589040	593000	really wanted to talk about here on the show is, you know, I know a lot of you guys at
593000	597360	OLR are watching a lot of this on TV and listening to the other podcasts and reading the news
597360	600880	sites, but we want to tell you a little bit about like, you know, our perspective, what
600880	605940	we kind of saw on the show floor today, what we played, which today sadly wasn't a lot,
605940	611320	we spent a lot of time standing in line.
611320	615560	We started the show today, we decided we were going to make a dash to see the 3DS as fast
615560	618800	as possible, because we didn't have an appointment, and we just thought, you know what, we'll
618800	622480	just stand on the line, and if we go there right when the show starts, we won't have
622480	623840	to wait very long.
623840	628260	So right at noon, we get through the doors, and you know, considering we had been standing
628260	633160	outside the doors for about 30 minutes beforehand, we had a pretty good spot, and we got in there
633160	638640	and already the booth was kind of around the corner of the line, so we said, forget it,
638640	639640	we'll get in line anyway.
639640	648000	Well, after about two hours, I would say we maybe moved, we barely moved at all, we maybe
648000	653960	moved about 100 people in line in like a couple of hours, it just felt like they were not
653960	658040	burning through people at all, and we were starting to get worried because we had a 3.30
658040	659040	appointment.
659040	663760	Well thankfully, a hero saved the day, and thanks to some connections Shane has, we were
663760	669120	able to actually end up getting to see the 3DS a little bit early, so while we are very
669120	675200	thankful to Shane's connections and so forth, you know, it was awesome to get to see the
675200	679120	3DS and I'll let Shane talk about it a little bit here, but I just kind of, I did feel really
679120	683400	bad for everybody else in line, you know, I mean like, I did and I didn't, I had another
683400	688700	appointment I had to get to, you know, and so forth, but I just, I felt Nintendo really
688700	691800	should have been moving that line a lot quicker.
691800	695360	I don't know, Shane, anything about the line?
695360	703080	Well, as is standard with Nintendo lines, it was far too long, and poorly managed, and
703080	709640	I don't know if that's Nintendo's fault, or the people they hired to stand and guard the
709640	717000	lines, but it was pretty awful, it's to be expected though, but yeah, we really have
717000	724240	to give a big thanks to JC for helping us out there, letting us see the system and make
724240	732040	our appointment on time, he's awesome, he should be, you know, president of the company.
732040	737360	Yeah, so big thanks, but you know, again, I just, in future years, I would really like
737360	742380	to see them, I think at least kind of tell people what the estimated wait time is going
742380	746620	to be, so that people, yeah, like a Disney ride or something, seriously, epic wait times
746620	751200	or something, you know, show us a realistic, because you know, all these people, it's not
751200	756620	like people just showed up to the party, you know, everybody here did have to qualify,
756620	760840	maybe it wasn't as media, but everybody is tied to the industry somehow, and you know,
760840	766440	a lot of these people have friends back home, and I mean, it is kind of sad sometimes how
766440	771920	much the media just really gets to kind of walk all over E3, and I do realize, I do realize
771920	775880	this is a press event, it's a trade show and so forth, and those are the people that have
775880	780960	priority, but you know, we live in a day and age where, you know, Andy Warhol said everybody
780960	784960	gets their 15 minutes, you know, we've got a podcast, and you know, but lots of people
784960	788680	have their YouTubes and their blogs and so forth, and I just think, you know, there's
788680	793120	probably going to be a lot of negative word of mouth about that line, but I guess the
793120	795040	question would be, did it pay off?
795040	798960	You know, when we got up there, what was the 3DS like?
798960	802920	I'll let Shane kind of talk about the 3DS a little bit.
802920	807480	The 3DS is the second coming of handhelds by far.
807480	813920	I was kind of enthused to go see it today, had my reservations, but once I got up there,
813920	822440	got to pick up the system, first thing we saw on it was a demo for Animal Crossing 3DS.
822440	824760	I was sold.
824760	834800	The 3D screen is only the top screen, and it's just amazing looking, it's sharp, it
834800	844560	looks like, you know, there's depth back there behind, gosh I'm so tired, the screen just
844560	850000	has all this depth going in the back, and you can adjust the slider on the side to make
850000	856920	it not 3D, bring it back down to 2D, I don't know, for me, I used to hate 3D movies and
856920	864240	all that, but now that I've seen the 3DS in action, it is a remarkable little system.
864240	869800	I'm not even sad about the screen size, I have a DSi XL, and I swore I would never go
869800	877440	back down to a smaller screen, but it's no big deal on the 3DS.
877440	881960	You know, I was very skeptical about this system, because I have not been a fan of everything
881960	887960	very much shifting to 3D recently, especially the movies, I don't have a good time because
887960	892920	it kind of hurts my eyes and so forth, and so I kind of get bothered when I see how everything
892920	898080	is going 3D, but you know what, I'll tell you what, the 3DS was a pretty good looking
898080	902080	system, and I was a little worried at first, because when I first opened that thing up,
902080	906480	and I played Animal Crossing first, well we didn't get to really play it, it was a lot,
906480	911000	just so you guys know, there was a lot of concept videos basically, it's like we were
911000	917220	watching a live rendering or whatever of Animal Crossing, or Mario Kart was another one, or
917220	921720	there was a few that they had, you didn't really get to play them, but it gave you a
921720	924860	really good idea of what the games would look like on the system.
924860	928160	But Animal Crossing was the first thing I saw too, and I was like, you know when I first
928160	932240	opened it up and looked at it, I was like, oh it's very similar to that stereoscopic
932240	937080	effect like during Avatar, oh this is going to hurt my eyes, and I don't know about this,
937080	941800	but then the gal pointed out you could use the slider to adjust, and sure enough, if
941800	947580	I turned it down about, pardon my voice everybody, sorry, this is a video game, podcast guy's
947580	954420	worst nightmare during E3, but if you turn that slider down about a quarter of the way,
954420	959320	it was perfect, and it didn't bother my eyes anymore, you know, maybe I didn't have the
959320	964440	same amount of depth that Shane had, but I was able to get that 3D effect enough where
964440	969540	something like Mario Kart looked pretty awesome with that whole 3D.
969540	973440	Here's the thing though guys, I'm going to be, I am going to put on my skeptics hat a
973440	978080	little bit here, I'm going to say don't jump out of your seat too high.
978080	985680	It's still a DS, yes it has higher graphics processing power, yes, you know, it's got
985680	989360	like these multitude of cameras and things that are going to let you see these 3D pictures,
989360	994220	but I think the 3D thing, it's a little bit of a gimmick, just like, you know, the whole
994220	998280	motion control was a gimmick, and it's very important to note, things are not going to
998280	1002840	fly out of the screen at you, you know, I think one of the commercials showed the Nintendogs
1002840	1008320	was lifting his paw out of the screen, it's not that in your face, okay, the 3D effects
1008320	1014280	are not going to like, I mean, it's a little tiny handheld guys, but it's subtle enough
1014280	1021080	and the whole fact that you get that without glasses is pretty cool, it's a very subtle
1021080	1024640	but very noticeable effect that I think will have a big impact, and I think where it's
1024640	1028920	going to have an especially huge impact is the fact that the movies are there with no
1028920	1033240	glasses, that's going to be huge for kids, the stuff they were showing, like the Disney
1033240	1037760	movie, the Tangled, and that was one of your favorite things you saw, right Shane?
1037760	1043680	Yeah, and one of the reasons why it was one of my favorite things I saw on the 3DS is
1043680	1051440	because of the resolution on the screen, it was amazing, if you've seen any of those pre-rendered
1051440	1060720	videos on DS or even Game Boy Advance, they're all blocky, really, really grainy, terrible,
1060720	1067120	terrible looking videos, but this, I swear, was like watching a DVD, or possibly a Blu-ray,
1067120	1075920	I'm not sure, but it was insane how smooth everything looked, it was like watching a
1075920	1081920	commercial or being in theaters and not seeing these blocky images, just seeing what the
1081920	1089840	creators of the movie wanted you to see, and that alone is, well no it's not alone, but
1089840	1096520	that is another reason why the 3DS is amazing, and I can't, I agree that it's a gimmick so
1096520	1104000	far, the 3D, but I feel that with Nintendo handhelds they start off gimmicky and then
1104000	1111060	you give them less than a year and that form of gameplay gimmick just works and everything
1111060	1115080	they bring out for it just ends up being pretty cool.
1115080	1120800	I'm not, you know, I understand Shane's enthusiasm, but I'm not like quite jump up and down screaming
1120800	1126120	oh my god, kind of like what Shane is, but I will say what I did find, actually almost
1126120	1131720	more impressive than the system itself, was just all the games they have lined up for
1131720	1137560	it, I mean they already have huge franchises, Metal Gear, Kingdom Hearts, and of course
1137560	1144120	all of Nintendo's franchises in there as well, and Saints Row, which got a laugh in the audience
1144120	1150160	and all that, all these people are so on board and I think that, when we talk about the golden
1150160	1158000	rule of gaming, a game is only as good as it's clearly tied very late, it's what, 1255
1158000	1162400	in the morning right now, it's actually Wednesday, so bear with us guys, sorry it's professional
1162400	1168200	radio at its best, but you know, the whole golden rule that the system is only as good
1168200	1172980	as the games that are on it, dude there are tons of games coming out for this system,
1172980	1179360	I still kind of have my whole little antsy thing with handhelds, but, big but here, the
1179360	1184840	3D is kind of, you know, it motivates me, this is something I'm only going to get on
1184840	1190440	a handheld that I'm not going to get on a TV, I'm sold enough where I will probably
1190440	1194240	pick one of these up when it comes out, if for nothing else, there's a freaking Kid Icarus
1194240	1199160	game coming out on it, probably a launch, you know, and this is really going to have
1199160	1203680	the games to back it up at the end of the day, and if the 3D thing becomes too gimmicky,
1203680	1205360	turn it off, right?
1205360	1210540	Yeah, I mean, I think that was a brilliant move on Nintendo's part, to be able to downgrade
1210540	1216480	your 3D to just straight up 2D, I'm assuming they'll require it of every game that comes
1216480	1224360	out for it, but I think Nintendo played this one really well, I'll be interested in seeing
1224360	1229840	what they've held back from E3 about this system beyond the price and the release date,
1229840	1234480	because you know, there's something about it that they're just not telling us.
1234480	1237840	You know, I would like to hear a little more about the whole Wi-Fi, like I know they mentioned
1237840	1241200	during the press conference, like it seemed like, you know, it could kind of like be off
1241200	1246000	and in your pocket, but it was still communicating, but doesn't the DS kind of do that, except
1246000	1249800	oh, you have to have a game on, but you can have the lid shut, you know, I don't know
1249800	1254520	if they're just expanding on that or what they're doing, but I am very curious to kind
1254520	1256960	of hear more about the communications features.
1256960	1261520	Personally, I don't think we're going to see this thing until next year, but it'll probably
1261520	1265440	be early next year, Japan may have it this holiday, I don't know, but yeah, I kind of
1265440	1266440	go back and forth.
1266440	1271200	It seems like the system has more development to go, but with all of these games already
1271200	1275800	announced, it seems like, man, they've got a solid year's worth of games already.
1275800	1281720	I forgot to mention, there are two things I'm kind of disappointed with it.
1281720	1290960	The first one, the overall design, the look to the system, very, you know, DS, and I know
1290960	1297920	it's called the 3DS, I was still hoping that was a working title, but I don't know, I've
1297920	1303480	had some ADSs now, I don't really feel like they should have gone with the same design,
1303480	1308880	and the cases, the metallic cases look very cheap.
1308880	1315360	When I saw it, it reminded me of my Power Rangers from when I was younger, my metallic
1315360	1318680	ones, same exact sort of coding on it.
1318680	1323400	The second thing that I had a problem with is the D-pad, I didn't actually mess with
1323400	1330960	it, because there was a playable demo we got, 8-bit Xavius, which we didn't mention, that
1330960	1336800	was pretty cool, and I used the analog stick, which was really nice, but that D-pad, if
1336800	1341960	you're going to make backwards compatible DS games for it, the D-pad is in a very awkward
1341960	1347560	position that I don't think would feel right holding while playing.
1347560	1351640	But I think it's also important to note that a lot of this is still open change, because
1351640	1356840	I remember being here, what, 04, when the DS first debuted, and what they showed on
1356840	1361400	the show floor was a lot different than what the finished prototype was, so we do have
1361400	1364800	to take that into account with Shane's feedback, that a lot of that could change.
1364800	1368920	When you think of the analog stick, though, it felt a little cheap to me, but again, I
1368920	1373480	have to remember these are prototypes, but I thought it was effective, like it was actually
1373480	1378080	really easy to move around, and it didn't hurt like the PSP one does.
1378080	1381520	And that comes from the design of the stick.
1381520	1384120	It is concave, right?
1384120	1385120	That's the word I'm...
1385120	1386120	Yeah.
1386120	1387120	Yeah, concave.
1387120	1389320	So your thumb fits in perfectly.
1389320	1396120	It's not flat like the PSP, it's not rounded like, you know, Nintendo 64 or PlayStation
1396120	1397120	or X...
1397120	1402320	Well, I guess Xbox isn't, but Xbox just doesn't feel right anyway.
1402320	1408120	But it's just this big circle of an analog stick that your thumb fits in nicely.
1408120	1413240	It doesn't really move a lot, it doesn't have a lot of space to move, but it gets the job
1413240	1420040	done and is comfortable, and I think, as Nintendo likes to do, they put their form factor on
1420040	1422640	a high priority when designing these things.
1422640	1423640	All right.
1423640	1428920	If you guys have more questions about the 3DS, we'll try to answer whatever we can.
1428920	1434160	You can always send your questions to the mailbag, mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com,
1434160	1438140	if you want us to talk about it on Sunday show, or if you want us to try and get to
1438140	1444280	it tomorrow on the Wednesday night show, or maybe I should say Thursday morning show,
1444280	1448960	www.Twitter.com slash O-L-R is a great way to get ahold of us during the show.
1448960	1451960	I've been posting tons and tons and tons of pictures today.
1451960	1454520	Let's talk about some of the other stuff we observed today.
1454520	1459400	Miklotov, tell us a little bit about one of the games where you just randomly ended up
1459400	1462120	seeing and games to spend a little time with.
1462120	1470160	Well, as we were walking to get food, I happened to see a booth that had Battlestar Galactica
1470160	1477280	all over it, and I remembered, hey, there is a web-based MMO coming out that probably
1477280	1481220	will be awful, so we have to go see it, of course.
1481220	1486060	We go over there and ask the guy if they have time for a little press interview, gives us
1486060	1492900	a nice room with, I don't have their names with me at the moment, but one of the head
1492900	1497120	guys heading up the Battlestar MMO from Bigpoint.
1497120	1500720	Yeah, let's just leave it at Bigpoint.com.
1500720	1504160	Yeah, what he said.
1504160	1509080	They kind of talked to us about their company and what they were doing with the Battlestar
1509080	1517400	Galactica free web MMO, and they gave us a nice little tour of the pre-alpha, is what
1517400	1522560	they were calling it, version, and holy crap, this might be the first Battlestar Galactica
1522560	1526960	game that I would not feel bad about playing.
1526960	1527960	It looked beautiful.
1527960	1531560	They really captured the essence of the show.
1531560	1537800	They did say they are working with the creative team from Battlestar Galactica on this.
1537800	1543360	It's a very joint venture, but I don't know.
1543360	1545520	I am interested in playing it.
1545520	1551400	They're shooting for a winter release, and they said that they'd have more details like
1551400	1558880	cast announcements at Comic-Con, which sucks because that is next month and not today.
1558880	1561000	I would love more information on this game.
1561000	1565580	Yeah, again, what we saw was very, very early, and I kind of went in with a lot of the same
1565580	1570400	skepticism that Shane had about, oh yay, a web browser based MMO, I'm sure this is going
1570400	1572160	to be a real winner.
1572160	1577720	We went in and we were like, I have to admit, I was kind of like, wow, these graphics, have
1577720	1579920	I seen better graphics on a PC game?
1579920	1586360	Sure, but for a web based, no download, free MMO, I was like, that's actually pretty darn
1586360	1588360	good.
1588360	1592080	Free is definitely a good price, so I will definitely check out the full version when
1592080	1593080	it comes out.
1593080	1596520	I'm not sure on some of these combat games, but it sounds like there's more to come on
1596520	1597520	this.
1597520	1600560	I like Battlestar enough, and again, just to at least look at the graphics a little
1600560	1604720	bit and see if I can actually steer the ship.
1604720	1609280	Let's talk a little bit about, I'll mention this real quick, we did go by Konami's booth
1609280	1613840	for a little bit and saw their dance game that they have on Kinect.
1613840	1617460	There's two dance games now for Kinect, and I'm having a hard time telling them apart.
1617460	1625360	There's Dance Masters is Konami, and then Dance Central is the harmonics one.
1625360	1628480	Okay, we'll get to Dance Central in a little bit, but I did look at a little bit of Dance
1628480	1629480	Masters.
1629480	1634480	Guys, I think this is where DDR is going.
1634480	1638840	To me, there was a lot of very DDR-ish elements in the game.
1638840	1643460	For those long time Dance Dance Revolution fans, the song list, at least the few songs
1643460	1644460	they had in this game.
1644460	1651400	You had a Naoki song, you had a Smile Decay song, you had a transplant from Para-Para-Paradise,
1651400	1656160	complete with the same dance, which is making a lot of people compare this game to Para-Para-Paradise.
1656160	1659360	I think the game might be more accurately compared to Itoy Groove.
1659360	1664960	It was kind of like you move your hands around and then you pose and all this stuff, which
1664960	1671040	is ironic because Kinect, in a way, the whole thing really feels like what we all thought
1671040	1676120	the Itoy was going to be capable of years ago, but just really couldn't pull off technically.
1676120	1681120	This new technology is allowing it to be a lot more fluid or what have you, but I will
1681120	1682800	say I have not played the game yet.
1682800	1687360	I hope to a little later on, but I was floored at first because I kind of took a step back
1687360	1691720	and I was like, wow, it even like perfects are in yellow and greats are in green and
1691720	1697400	a lot of the engine and combos, I was like, this seems to be an Naoki was there.
1697400	1699520	He seems to be kind of behind it.
1699520	1701880	This might be the direction that DDR is going.
1701880	1705920	Funny enough, no DDR on the 360 or PS3 to be found.
1705920	1708440	All the DDR that was on the floor was for the Wii.
1708440	1711640	So take that as you will.
1711640	1715640	Let's move on to one of the dance games we did play, Dance Central.
1715640	1717760	What did you think about this game?
1717760	1725200	Well, I saw it at the Microsoft press conference on the TV and I was sold.
1725200	1726640	It's harmonics.
1726640	1727640	It's going to be amazing.
1727640	1733000	That's what harmonics does, but I didn't really understand how great it would be until we
1733000	1736200	actually got to play it today.
1736200	1742680	It doesn't feel like a video game and that's probably what makes it so interesting to play.
1742680	1747160	It is a dance teaching game.
1747160	1753720	It's definitely an exercise style game, but it's really fun.
1753720	1758480	You start when you first play, you kind of feel dorky playing it, but then you just really
1758480	1760160	get into it.
1760160	1765640	It's not one of those games that I would be too embarrassed to play in front of people.
1765640	1771400	You might be when you played DDR for a while or when you would play any dancing game in
1771400	1776660	the arcade or any rhythm game, period.
1776660	1781960	I could see this being a great, great teacher for people that want to start to learn to
1781960	1784560	dance.
1784560	1792120	I think that was a genre that was sorely lacking in video games because DDR doesn't teach you
1792120	1793120	to dance.
1793120	1796440	Pump It Up doesn't teach you to dance.
1796440	1800600	The dance masters game, it might not be teaching you to dance, but it kind of seemed like...
1800600	1801600	No, no.
1801600	1802600	The other one.
1802600	1804300	I'm talking about the Konami game.
1804300	1809000	It may not be teaching you to dance per se, but it definitely looked a lot more like real
1809000	1813200	dance, especially if you were mimicking the dancers on the screen, whereas I think the
1813200	1818080	key difference was that the other game, the Harmonix game, Dance Central, is more about
1818080	1822680	a choreographed dance that you're learning and you can put together and you learn this
1822680	1826160	very choreographed dance as you go.
1826160	1829920	I think this is going to be Kinect's niche, and this should be no surprise.
1829920	1833640	I talked about this on the show a little while ago.
1833640	1837280	Didn't I even say on the show a couple weeks ago, I said, all they need to do is put a
1837280	1839880	Biggest Loser game on it, and sure enough, guess what's coming out?
1839880	1843040	Well, that's not one of the games that was on the floor, but I think the whole fitness
1843040	1848080	thing and the fact that you don't need a controller or a scale or a dance pad or any of it, I
1848080	1854080	think as much as it made a lot of us grimace at Microsoft's press conference, I think that's
1854080	1859160	what's going to ultimately get them the most CNN coverage and Oprah coverage and start
1859160	1863960	to kind of nip at the heels of what Nintendo's doing because of the fact that, you know,
1863960	1866880	it's just a camera.
1866880	1870400	And this could be something they start implementing in schools, too.
1870400	1874840	They would only have to buy one thing for it, all besides the system, and that's an
1874840	1882520	investment that they could easily tailor towards, you know, the kids for their physical activities.
1882520	1886520	I will say I was pleasantly surprised at how responsive the game was, and you could kind
1886520	1889940	of see the silhouette of yourself, and it didn't look like a lot of stray pixels were
1889940	1891400	getting in there.
1891400	1896320	The lighting where we were at was even a little bit dark, although we did have a clear background,
1896320	1899400	so my interest is definitely piqued.
1899400	1903720	I really want to see how this plays out as well in my living room, although my living
1903720	1909760	room might be a little cramped for Dance Central, I don't know, so it was interesting to look
1909760	1914160	at, I got to say, and actually play and to get up there and dance to Poker Face and then
1914160	1919920	actually get a five star on the song, you know, when I didn't really know what I was
1919920	1924920	doing, but it kind of showed me enough where, you know, having played enough rhythm games
1924920	1928160	before, I was kind of able to get the hang of it real quick.
1928160	1929160	It was cool.
1929160	1930160	How about Rock Band 3?
1930160	1933480	Tell us a little bit about Rock Band 3.
1933480	1936720	Rock Band 3 was cool.
1936720	1938280	It was rock band.
1938280	1945400	It didn't, for me, okay, I got to play guitar, so I was playing, you know, the same instrument
1945400	1948040	we've played for the past two games.
1948040	1953360	Nothing very exciting for me personally when we did the demo.
1953360	1958520	It was cool to have so many people on our little stage, though, all playing together.
1958520	1965960	That was probably the best part for me, and the guitar was blue, so I was very happy about
1965960	1966960	that.
1966960	1973000	But, you know, you got to play the keyboards, and I didn't get to really mess with those,
1973000	1978240	so, and that's the most important part about Rock Band 3 from the demo, so I'll give it
1978240	1979880	back to you.
1979880	1981080	The keyboards were cool.
1981080	1986640	I did misstate something in an earlier program that we learned a little more about today.
1986640	1990880	When you're playing in five-bar mode, the keyboard is not split into five different
1990880	1993320	sections as it looks like it is.
1993320	1995840	That is for the pro mode, basically only.
1995840	1996840	I'm not sure why.
1996840	1999640	I don't know why it kind of sections it off the way it does.
1999640	2003640	I think it has to do with hand placement, when hand should be hitting what keys.
2003640	2009660	But when you play the normal five-bar mode, you're just playing C, D, E, F, G. For those
2009660	2013400	of you guys that know piano or keyboard, you're just basically playing those five notes all
2013400	2017640	together, and they're kind of labeled a little bit differently, so it's just kind of important
2017640	2018840	to note about playing the keyboard.
2018840	2023880	But the pro modes, I mean, seeing that guy, I mean, I don't know anything about playing
2023880	2029280	the guitar, but watching that guy in the demo was playing that White Stripes song, and like,
2029280	2033600	I think at one point they kind of like double-jacked him so that he was in the Xbox 360, and he
2033600	2037000	was in an amp, and he was playing like the real song.
2037000	2038060	That was really cool.
2038060	2042000	What he was doing was going above my head, because I know nothing about playing the guitar,
2042000	2047680	but I do know how to play, at least I did when I was a little kid, the piano or keyboard.
2047680	2054240	It's really exciting that I could probably learn like the quote-unquote real songs.
2054240	2059720	I do like the fact that they confirmed today that there will be a pro mode for bass.
2059720	2066580	It had been rumored that pro mode was coming to the guitar, the drums, and the keyboards,
2066580	2074080	that they were skipping out on bass, because bass gets so little love from anybody it seems.
2074080	2077440	And the new pro instruments, I don't think that's what they're called, but that's what
2077440	2082760	I'm calling them, with the $150 guitar and whatnot.
2082760	2084360	That was amazing.
2084360	2092400	That is definitely taking their music games and setting it apart from anything else anybody's
2092400	2101440	doing, or they're investing so much into this genre that we can only respect them for it,
2101440	2102440	I think.
2102440	2106280	It sounds like they're making a lot of very interesting changes with the single-player
2106280	2109880	mode too, that I'm kind of curious to see how that plays out.
2109880	2113460	They didn't give us a lot of details on all that today, they kind of talked about it,
2113460	2116480	but it seems like they're going to trickle a little more and a little more up to the
2116480	2120760	release of the game, including more info on the character creation mode and so forth.
2120760	2126280	But I will say this, it was great to hear that pretty much everything is backwards compatible.
2126280	2130680	Not the Beatles, but I think everybody pretty much expected that, but the Lego Rock Band,
2130680	2134180	everything could come in, they have a whole new way for you to pick songs, that includes
2134180	2138040	filtering your list, so if you just want to look at Lego songs or you want to look at
2138040	2140920	songs of a certain difficulty, it seems to be a lot more fluid.
2140920	2146260	They made a lot of improvements to the interface, including people jumping in and out and having
2146260	2148680	quicker play sessions.
2148680	2152960	I was pretty enticed by what they're doing with the setup there.
2152960	2159480	Wow, I'm really losing my voice guys, I'm so sorry, but I do want to at least try to
2159480	2162320	talk a little bit with you guys about what we saw today.
2162320	2167760	Those were pretty much the games we spent real quality time with, really got to sit
2167760	2173760	down and play extensively, but we kind of got to look over shoulders and see some other
2173760	2174760	games.
2174760	2180760	So I quickly saw the OnLive system, and I was like, if that is really streaming in that
2180760	2184880	little box, that looks a lot better than I anticipated.
2184880	2188280	I know Bobby's going to spend some time with that, so maybe when he's here tomorrow he'll
2188280	2189760	tell us a little more about that.
2189760	2192980	I did see the Tron games, which looked kind of cool.
2192980	2197920	The one I was looking at was a Wii bike, or like a bike, the light cycles thing on the
2197920	2202560	Wii, but it looked like there was a 360 one too, I didn't really get close enough with.
2202560	2206000	Probably tomorrow I'm going to get in there a little closer to see a little bit of Dead
2206000	2208120	Rising 2, which kind of looked exciting.
2208120	2213560	I'm hoping tomorrow I can look at Sony Move and actually get my hands on it, so I can
2213560	2216400	feel like I'm speaking the Sony side a little more with authority.
2216400	2221040	I know anything that just kind of caught your eye as we were walking around, let me go talk.
2221040	2226680	Well, I will actually go to the opposite of that, I will say what did not catch my eye,
2226680	2231720	which would be games that I expected to be there and didn't actually show.
2231720	2236280	Quite disappointed that Nintendo did not bring the new Pokemon games here, they did have
2236280	2243080	one on Wii, and they did have a Pokemon Ranger for DS, but no black and white.
2243080	2250600	And I'm hoping that's because they will switch it up and instead of it being a DS game, they
2250600	2258160	bring it to the 3DS, because I assume we'll get the 3DS by our release date of Spring
2258160	2261040	2011 for Pokemon.
2261040	2266040	I was very disappointed with walking through EA and not seeing Dragon Age 2.
2266040	2271920	They have already set a teaser release date for it, so I don't see why they couldn't have
2271920	2275800	at least shown it in video form, maybe it was behind closed doors.
2275800	2283680	Konami, not having a Silent Hill up there to show, that was very very upsetting, however,
2283680	2290800	they kind of countered it with having a Glee Karaoke Revolution, which I will hopefully
2290800	2295780	be playing tomorrow, because I love me some Glee.
2295780	2299680	It's kind of one of those things where when I saw it, I kind of rolled my eyes and said,
2299680	2303400	how did I not see that one coming?
2303400	2309660	Was it just today we were talking about how come nobody picked up a Glee license before
2309660	2313400	we got to Konami, and then it was there?
2313400	2316680	You know what it was, somebody was making a joke at Ubisoft's Prescott, I think somebody
2316680	2321440	had said something like, oh gee, it's so funny that Ubisoft didn't roll out like a Glee game,
2321440	2322440	I don't know why they...
2322440	2325680	Yeah, yeah, you said that, and then suddenly we're at Konami's booth, and oh, well, they
2325680	2327680	have the license for the Glee game apparently.
2327680	2333640	But, I mean, it makes sense now, they rebooted the Karaoke franchise by dropping American
2333640	2339480	Idol, and instead they're picking up yet another Fox show, why can't dance masters be so you
2339480	2344080	think you can dance masters, or something like that?
2344080	2349820	I think these tie-ins would go great for Konami, I kind of hope they start doing a little bit
2349820	2354140	better and quit putting out some crap titles.
2354140	2356600	What else caught my eye while we were walking around?
2356600	2362880	Oh, I didn't see Child of Eden at Ubisoft, I was really hoping for that, especially now
2362880	2369800	hearing that you don't need the move controller, you don't need the Kinect camera to play,
2369800	2375280	they are gonna let you use the regular controls, so not having a demo up or anything was kind
2375280	2377280	of depressing.
2377280	2383880	Yeah, I think, I didn't really get to see much, I mean, we completely skipped over Namco
2383880	2390040	today, I wanna try to find Valve if Valve is around, I wanna play Portal.
2390040	2392680	Disappointed that Activision thinks they're too good for a booth.
2392680	2395440	I don't think Portal's on the show floor.
2395440	2403240	So I'm sad that Valve thinks they're too good for a booth.
2403240	2409580	It's a very much scaled down version of the E3 I'm used to, so, little disappointments
2409580	2413360	here and there, but at the same time there's been some really cool stuff just from the
2413360	2415000	first day.
2415000	2418600	I don't think it's really scaled down, I think this is kind of like the just right size,
2418600	2424400	like 2006 was too much, I think this year is, and with last year, even though what was
2424400	2428320	being shown to me wasn't as impressive last year because everything was still a concept
2428320	2434280	last year, I'm relatively happy with the way this year is going so far.
2434280	2439240	I would be happy if Kentia Hall was back and had all the really crappy games and the really
2439240	2447160	awesome games that nobody cares about, but, I don't know, I would, I kind of miss the
2447160	2452920	old big spectacle E3 just because it was so neat.
2452920	2458920	I don't know, it still feels like a skeptical, what am I saying, god it's late, it still
2458920	2463880	feels like a big spectacle to me Shane, I don't know, but, I don't know, it's been many
2463880	2464880	of these now.
2464880	2470880	Maybe it would feel like a big spectacle to me if we didn't have to wait in line for half
2470880	2472880	the day.
2472880	2480680	Yeah, and one other thing, it is still very disappointing just how much of the show is
2480680	2488080	still make an appointment or only special people can get in here and everything is behind
2488080	2493800	these walls and so forth, it's kind of like, I don't know, to a lot of people who do fly
2493800	2499280	out to be here and all that stuff, it's just kind of like, it's a big disappointment.
2499280	2502240	If they're going to do stuff like that, they need to make it media only.
2502240	2510160	I see people with exhibits only, badges, or, you know, even the people that are exhibitors,
2510160	2516800	they can't get to all the stuff that's behind closed doors, it's just media that have appointments.
2516800	2521400	I don't see what the point of that is, you're not getting your product out to everybody
2521400	2526720	that you possibly can, that's just dumb to me by far.
2526720	2533480	You know, I don't really care who is the super special club or what have you, I just don't
2533480	2537560	think it should be so out in everyone else's faces, that like, you know, oh these people
2537560	2541280	are coming back here but you're not, you know, type of thing, like that's why they have meeting
2541280	2545680	rooms in these other places, you know, use the booth space to show those things you want
2545680	2550800	to show out in the open and have more places for people to walk around so the show doesn't
2550800	2554480	feel as cramped even though there's less people here, I think that's kind of really the point
2554480	2560580	I'm trying to get to is that just don't be so flagrant about, you know, this is the gold
2560580	2564560	star people only, you know, if that makes sense.
2564560	2568600	So I get though why they, you know, it's kind of like that bar that's really crowded out
2568600	2572000	for a while, those people want to get into that bar, that must be the really popular
2572000	2575680	bar but it's just this really kind of trend.
2575680	2580120	I didn't think there was as much of it last year as I'm really starting to see this year,
2580120	2585020	but going back to 2006, I think there was a lot of that in 2006 too which caused that
2585020	2588920	show floor to just be packed because there's no place for people to go.
2588920	2594560	Gotta say though that the stuff I've seen that's closed for, you know, appointments
2594560	2599760	that have already been made, mostly stuff I don't care about, so I'm not too bummed
2599760	2600760	about it.
2600760	2606320	The only thing that kind of got me sad was Final Fantasy XIV being closed off, but hey,
2606320	2608920	we have an appointment for it, so it's all good.
2608920	2614120	Alright, yeah, so we'll be bringing you more information on that coming on Thursday.
2614120	2617880	Anyway, we're just gonna start to wrap up for tonight because it's getting very late,
2617880	2620280	it's probably after 1am.
2620280	2624920	If you want to ask us questions or give any feedback, twitter.com slash OLR is really
2624920	2627800	the place to get to us over the next few days.
2627800	2630320	The thing you're most looking forward to seeing tomorrow, Shane?
2630320	2635880	Oh, that is not where I thought you were going with that.
2635880	2636880	You know what?
2636880	2641880	It's not necessarily a thing, I think I'm really interested in hanging out and spending
2641880	2644120	some time with the Sega booth.
2644120	2646240	I want to see the new Sonic games.
2646240	2650300	I want to see the localized Phantasy Star Portable.
2650300	2654680	And even though Bobby said it was terrible, I would love to see the monkey ball on the
2654680	2658360	iPad and see how awful it is.
2658360	2661880	I'm looking forward to just getting some hands-on time with the PlayStation Move, hopefully.
2661880	2665680	I'd like to kind of go in and give that a try because I'm hearing a lot about how it
2665680	2669720	feels a little more accurate than the Wii does.
2669720	2673280	As far as the press conference goes, I wasn't hearing about a lot of games that I feel like
2673280	2677880	I need to get, but I'd be curious to go get my hands on it and see if it changes my mind.
2677880	2681120	I think that's one of the top things I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
2681120	2688300	I think it might be worth braving the Nintendo booth again tomorrow to ABC Zelda, because
2688300	2693600	I don't know what the videos are like online, but that game was running flawlessly.
2693600	2697280	It looked 60 frames a second, it was beautiful.
2697280	2702260	And I would like to try Kirby Epic Yarn or whatever it's called.
2702260	2706480	And the Donkey Kong Country game, because that is amazing looking.
2706480	2710280	It looks just like Donkey Kong Country and sounds like Donkey Kong Country.
2710280	2714560	All right, so yeah, tomorrow we're going to really try to not stand on as many lines and
2714560	2717240	just play as many games as possible.
2717240	2721520	So we'll see what we can do, and we'll be back tomorrow with Bobby, who will be here
2721520	2723060	with us.
2723060	2724640	And thank you for sitting through our special.
2724640	2728400	I know it's a lot different than a regular edition of Orange Launch Radio, but again,
2728400	2731760	we kind of want to get all that out there while we're still thinking about it.
2731760	2736280	And of course, I'll be joined with Dark Sakura and Loki again live this Sunday on Orange
2736280	2737280	Launch Radio.
2737280	2743280	We'll be talking about a lot of the same stuff, but Loki and Dark Sakura kind of have a different
2743280	2744280	point of observation.
2744280	2748680	And then of course you guys in chat and all that other stuff, it's going to be a fun show
2748680	2749680	on Sunday.
2749680	2755600	I also think it'd be great if we get some suggestions for things to see on Thursday,
2755600	2760880	because we won't be able to read them, I'm sure, tomorrow in time for when we go.
2760880	2765960	But our Thursday is pretty open except for Final Fantasy, so maybe there's something
2765960	2771000	that some people would like to hear about that we may have accidentally skipped.
2771000	2772000	Absolutely.
2772000	2777320	So, yeah, again, contact us at twitter.com slash O-L-R. You can try to send us emails
2777320	2778320	too.
2778320	2780600	I can't guarantee we can get those as fast, because we can do the Twitter thing right
2780600	2781600	there on my phone.
2781600	2782600	It's very easy.
2782600	2783600	So, okay.
2783600	2784600	That's it.
2784600	2785600	We're going to wrap up for tonight.
2785600	2786600	It's well after 1 a.m.
2786600	2788240	I need to upload this and go to bed.
2788240	2792640	So this is Rob Roberts at E3, Orange Lounge Special Edition.
2792640	2793640	All right.
2793640	2823400	Have a great night, everybody.
