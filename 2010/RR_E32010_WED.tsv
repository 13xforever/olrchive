0	9920	Hi everybody, it's Rob Roberts again here at E3 for a little special show for our feed
9920	10920	here.
10920	12920	Rob Roberts and Pals at E3.
12920	18400	It's the Wednesday edition or the second day of E3 although that's somewhat of a fib because
18400	21000	it's technically Thursday right now as we tape this.
21000	25420	It's after 1230 in the morning so it's even later than we taped last night but you'll
25420	29120	notice my voice at least is doing a little better today so that's a good thing.
29120	32280	So I hopefully won't be straining as bad as I was yesterday.
32280	36120	Anyhow, let's get right into the show and talk about some of the things we saw today.
36120	40240	We don't have a lot of news for you guys or anything because I'm sure a lot of you guys
40240	41520	have been reading the different websites.
41520	44920	We talked a lot about what the press conferences were all about yesterday but we just want
44920	48240	to tell you about our perspective on some of the things we tried and some of the things
48240	49240	we got our hands on.
49240	53640	I know a lot of our listeners have come to want to know what we think of some of the
53640	55660	games we get to get our hands on.
55660	59100	So I'll tell you a little bit about my experience in a little bit but we want to catch up with
59100	64440	definitely a pal of Orange Lounge Radio, somebody who's been a supporter of our show for a very
64440	65440	long time.
65440	66440	We try to support him too.
66440	70640	The one and only, straight out of Atlanta, Bobby Blackwolf is here.
70640	72040	Woooo, that's me.
72040	73540	How you doing?
73540	79960	So I wasn't able to be a part of the show last night because I was getting drunk and
79960	83800	attempting to Rick Roll the entire Bethesda party and failed.
83800	84800	It was very terrible.
84800	89080	It was the low point of my E3 when they turned off the karaoke at 1am and I was one step
89080	93120	the song away from Rick Rolling everybody.
93120	95280	That's my biggest disappointment of E3.
95280	98920	But I do have to throw this in though.
98920	103600	He may not have gotten to Rick Roll everybody but if you do want to see his awesome Night
103600	107920	of Fire routine, it's like all over Twitter right now so check that out.
107920	111280	Yeah, we're getting to that.
111280	118500	I do want to say that I was a part of the Activision saying, hey we didn't have to pay
118500	124320	that bonus to Infinity Ward, let's throw a party event, which was, you've probably read
124320	130500	about it and seen it, it's the 6 million dollar party they threw in the Staples Center on
130500	139460	Monday night showcasing just four games, DJ Hero 2, Guitar Hero, Warriors of Rock, True
139460	146840	Crime Hong Kong, and Call of Duty Black Ops with some cheap performers like Usher and
146840	155400	Jane's Addiction and Soundgarden and this guy named Eminem with Rihanna and a stripper.
155400	156960	I love Eminem's.
156960	159600	Yes, I only want the red and black ones.
159600	165300	But the highlight obviously was the pole dancer, I'm not going to say stripper because she
165300	172680	didn't strip, but the pole dancer, they lowered a pole from the rafters of the Staples Center
172680	178200	and she literally went probably about halfway up, which is like to the club seats on this
178200	182640	pole and hanging upside down and all that stuff, she stole the show.
182640	190360	So yeah, 6 million dollars and on top of that they gave us free beer.
190360	194260	Well clearly they had to bring in a pole dancer because the video game industry is so dominated
194260	196680	by women and gay men.
196680	205600	Exactly, but to me that was the biggest F you to the former Infinity Ward guys because
205600	208300	that was probably their bonus that they spent.
208300	213100	But hey, let me tell you guys this, you have never witnessed a video game trailer until
213100	216840	you see it with full pyrotechnics all around you.
216840	222200	The Call of Duty trailer is the same one you've probably seen online except they decided that
222200	226880	it was going to, instead of the music being canned, they actually did have a full orchestra
226880	231040	down in the pit playing the music for the trailer because the conductor was up on stage
231040	232040	and I'm like, what is he conducting?
232040	234760	Oh, there's an orchestra down there because that was far in the back.
234760	239400	And then like halfway through, you know, just one big pyrotechnic like with explosion on
239400	243680	the screen, pyrotechnics went around and I was like, oh that's cool, they did some pyrotechnics.
243680	247600	And then every explosion for the rest of the trailer had either pyrotechnics or firecrackers
247600	252640	from the top and that was the way to experience a trailer.
252640	255840	I'm still not going to play Call of Duty Black Ops.
255840	258980	Is it possible that maybe they didn't just do it as like kind of like, you know, spend
258980	262520	all that bonus money that, you know, they were supposed to pay out but that maybe they
262520	266400	sold the booth on eBay as well because I noticed their booth is nowhere to be found.
266400	270680	So I think maybe they sold all the parts of the booth and that may be paid for like the
270680	273720	Dom PÃ©rignon that Eminem needed backstage.
273720	275800	Yeah, probably.
275800	276800	They do have a presence.
276800	278240	I mean they've got a place.
278240	280560	They've got some meeting rooms.
280560	285280	Basically what they're doing is that, you know, by appointment you can go in and basically
285280	289840	they have these little rooms where you get a 30-minute demo of the game and sometimes
289840	292700	hands-on and that's where they're showing all their games.
292700	296840	But it's by appointment only and they like it a lot better because it's not as hectic
296840	298440	and loud and stuff.
298440	303680	So I did get to actually go in and see Guitar Hero, Warriors of Rock.
303680	306960	I have not been able to see Rock Band yet so don't ask me which one's better.
306960	310360	But you know, kind of going into games and this is, you know, this was actually one of
310360	313040	the most recent things I saw as well.
313040	319800	It's Guitar Hero but they showed us the Quest Mode which is, it's not Career Mode, it's
319800	325040	Quest Mode now and it actually brings a little bit of, you know, it gives you a different
325040	329280	reason to go through the song list other than I want to unlock all these songs.
329280	333160	And then they showed the Quick Play Plus Mode which to me kind of scratched my eye because
333160	336440	they said, yeah, we added so much stuff we couldn't call it Quick Play.
336440	340440	If you've played Guitar Hero 5 or Band Hero, you know about those challenges.
340440	345280	That's what they added to Quick Play was all those challenges and you can also compete
345280	349760	against the score of a friend kind of like in Geometry Wars where you can select a friend's
349760	354640	score off of the leaderboard and then it will show you how close you are to his score.
354640	359160	And then you can send him a message on Xbox Live making fun of him because you just beat
359160	360160	his score.
360160	364240	Will I be able to spam his Twitter and his Facebook and everything else too?
364240	368320	No, I think it is just OS, they've said it was just OS messages.
368320	374020	So it's, you know, you receive an Xbox Live message, kind of like what I get from Spazinator
374020	379520	in some games that, you know, he beat my high score in something.
379520	382780	Or the ones I love is that, you know, so and so wants to play Modern Warfare 2 with you
382780	385260	and I'm like, okay, do you listen to OLR?
385260	387920	Like I just, no disrespect to those games.
387920	393080	I understand why they have an audience and so forth, but it's just out of the literally,
393080	396560	and especially being at this show this year, literally hundreds of games that are available
396560	401120	to play that's just not, you know, high in my queue, you know, but it's just funny that
401120	404140	I get those invites once in a while.
404140	407120	So yeah, so that's Guitar Hero.
407120	411920	The one you were referencing earlier that I've played was Dance Masters from Konami
411920	418240	which broke my Kinect virginity because unfortunately, see what I've been doing, I've been working
418240	421760	with E3coverage.com and we do a lot of interviews and stuff.
421760	427580	So when we go into appointments, it's not really about for, you know, for game tactics,
427580	432240	for Justin Lee who's the editor of Game Tactics, it's not really about seeing the games, it's
432240	434080	about getting the interviews.
434080	438680	So we had an hour long Microsoft appointment and didn't see a single game because they
438680	445040	brought in like, since it's also a Canadian site, they brought up like the Xbox Live manager
445040	451280	for Canada and we interviewed him, the hardware manager for Canada and some, you know, basically
451280	455000	a lot of, you know, and you know, general people about Xbox in Canada and that was the
455000	457560	entire hour was standing up there.
457560	463560	So I didn't get to really play Kinect except in the Konami booth and I'm a sea dancer is
463560	465220	what it said.
465220	469520	Now one thing I do want to say about it is the menu system, this is what kind of threw
469520	473140	me a little bit, there might be a learning curve for some people because in the menu
473140	477440	system for at least Dance Masters which is a third party game, so maybe Microsoft has
477440	480720	it better, it's very sensitive to your movements.
480720	485080	So basically you do the minority report type of thing like, you know, let's, what happened
485080	490280	to us is, you know, selecting the difficulty level between light and standard and to hit
490280	496160	okay in Dance Masters, you have to put your hand up and then to the right and then, you
496160	499600	know, kind of to touch the okay thing that's at the top right of the screen.
499600	504540	Well when I had done it, I had said, okay, we're going to do standard and when I moved
504540	508440	my arm up and it's kind of funny, I'm doing this hand motion, I know you can't see it
508440	513560	but it's so I can explain it, you're supposed to move your hand up and then to the right.
513560	517680	Well when I moved it up, I didn't exactly move it straight up, I went a little bit to
517680	522840	the right and as I did that, it moved down to light and then but I had already started
522840	524800	the motion of hitting okay.
524800	527560	So it's going to take a little bit of getting used to, you have to be a little bit more
527560	532160	precise than you think and they're going to sit there and say, there's no learning curve
532160	533640	but I think there might be for some people.
533640	537840	Well, you know, I had a little hands on time with Dance Masters today too and, you know,
537840	541400	I played a song on there too and was going through the menu and what kind of threw me
541400	544940	was that, you know, Natala is supposed to be this whole, you're just going to hold up
544940	549240	your hand and wave it around and as you wave it around, you'll be able to select the songs
549240	553520	or, you know, whatever it is, change the channels, you know, but I found as I was going through
553520	557320	this Dance Masters, it was like, okay, to choose a number of players, you're going to
557320	560200	kind of, you know, put your hand up and then you're going to put it over to the right and
560200	563600	then it was like, okay, change the difficulty, you're going to kind of reach around to left,
563600	566440	it's like, you know, you put your right hand in, you put your right hand out, can I shake
566440	569960	it all about, okay, do the hokey pokey, turn yourself around, you know, it's like, oh my
569960	573920	gosh, like maybe it's just there's going to be a natural learning curve with all that
573920	578060	stuff and I'm being a little harsh but I was kind of like, gosh, I'm having to dance just
578060	582360	to get through the freaking menus on this game and, you know, I'm not really picking
582360	586200	on Dance Masters in that regard because it seems like even the other one I had played
586200	591160	the other day, Dance Central, maybe didn't have as complex menus because their demo version
591160	596000	was very tight and there wasn't a lot to pick from but, you know, it just seems like I'm
596000	600200	worried that in these Kinect games, it's going to be hard to navigate a lot of the menus
600200	606400	like it is in iToy. Yeah, I remember that, you know, where you have to like wave your
606400	612760	hand over the circle and stuff and yeah. So, but that's the only Kinect experience I've
612760	617440	had, I'm probably not going to be able to see Kinectimals or any of the other stuff.
617440	623400	I did touch PlayStation Move, you know, there was unfortunately we had to cancel our Sony
623400	628000	appointment for another interview with an exec and so that's what, so they cancelled
628000	633720	the Sony appointment but they do actually have some move games that are not required
633720	638920	to stand in a three hour line to get to. So I played Bowling, Brunswick Bowling and I
638920	643480	will say that the controller actually feels good in your hand, I mean it's, you know,
643480	650480	it feels a little bit better than holding a Wii remote to me but Bowling, I mean it's
650480	653860	kind of hard to see how more precise it is than like the Wii remote when you're playing
653860	659040	Bowling because that's such like the simplistic version and the Wii does a very good job Bowling
659040	667220	already. But no, it was really good to use and there was rumble in the controller and
667220	674080	everything so I really don't know what I can really say about it, I didn't get to play
674080	677720	the stuff they're really showing because I'd have to wait in a three hour line and I just
677720	682800	don't have three hours. Alright, well, you know, I know Shane and I have a whole list
682800	686600	of games we want to go over but Bobby since, you know, yesterday, between yesterday and
686600	689680	today are there any games that have kind of caught your eye that you want to, you know,
689680	695560	mention to the listenership right now? Okay, so here's one that, now, got to realize guys,
695560	700520	before I say this, last year my second favorite game of show was split second and I'm not
700520	704840	a fan of it now, now that it's out. So take this with a grain of salt because this might
704840	711460	be another one, Driver San Francisco, which was in Ubisoft, you know, yeah the Driver
711460	716840	games recently have been pretty bad, the ones that were by Atari or were published by Atari,
716840	720100	but they've kind of gone back to the roots of the first Driver which was actually pretty
720100	727840	good and the gameplay mechanic or gimmick or whatever you want to say in this was great.
727840	732520	Basically the storyline for it really quick because it makes no sense, they obviously
732520	737160	made the storyline to fit the gimmick rather than making the gimmick fit the storyline,
737160	741880	is that the character you play is in a coma. He doesn't realize he's in a coma, he just
741880	746000	thinks he has superpowers, but you're playing the entire game in his head and essentially
746000	751840	he's learned that his superpower in this coma that's in his head is that he can jump, he
751840	758220	can shift, that's the actual term in the game is shift, from car to car. So you can be driving
758220	763420	along in a car, hop out, all you do is you hit the A button, it goes to an aerial view
763420	771240	in this white light of God or whatever, and you can select another car, hit A, and then
771240	781560	you're immediately in that car driving around. So you basically can jump from car to car
781560	786240	and then in missions and stuff, the way you activate missions is you see a police chase
786240	791800	in progress, you can activate that mission, you can either shift into the police car or
791800	796560	into the getaway car and you can complete the mission that way. And you can even do
796560	805720	stuff like one of the missions I did had two cop cars chasing the runaway and I could switch
805720	811200	between the two cop cars just with the press of a button. And so if I kind of messed up
811200	815200	with one and crashed into a wall I could jump into the other one, the AI would take over
815200	821600	that car, get it back up, and you can do it that way. And then what they said is, okay,
821600	825060	you might not be able to catch them with the cop car so you can shift out. And there was
825060	830660	a big rig about three blocks down. I shifted into the big rig and did a head-on collision
830660	836200	and that completed the mission. And they also said it's online and yes, you can shift around
836200	840240	online so it's like online races and stuff are going to change a lot with this because
840240	844240	everybody is shifting into other cars and if you have enough, they didn't say exactly
844240	848000	like how you can build up the shift power or whatever, but you could actually shift
848000	853080	into one of the other people's cars and kick them out and they have to get another car.
853080	856400	So it's going to be interesting to see, I mean it was a great demo, just like Split
856400	859880	Second was, it's going to be interesting to see if it delivers in the final product.
859880	864200	Alright, I have to admit I've always had zero interest in the Driver series besides just
864200	869000	kind of like making fun of Driver 3, but that whole kind of play mechanic sounds really
869000	873680	interesting. What about like maybe one other game that's kind of caught your attention
873680	882960	over the past couple of days? Okay, well basically it's not really a game, the 3DS. I was able
882960	887720	to go out and get my hands on the 3DS and as I've said on my show, I am one of the 15%
887720	894400	of Americans that cannot see the 3D TV. I cannot see Avatar in 3D. Basically it looks
894400	899500	like a darker 2D to me. It's because of my eye problems. I had eye surgery when I was
899500	905280	3, so my doctor knows about it and there's really not much we can do about it. That being
905280	912160	said, if I turn the slider on the 3DS all the way up and hold it at an extremely specific
912160	919960	angle, I can see 3D in the 3DS. I can actually see it. They had a trailer of Metal Gear Solid,
919960	926200	or the Metal Gear game that's going to be on the 3DS and I was flinching as some of
926200	931360	the things were flying at me. Now the problem with this is that that's great for trailers
931360	939760	or watching a movie or whatever. I tried to play Star Fox on it in 3D and I realized how
939760	946680	much I move the unit when I'm playing. If I move it any little bit, it starts getting
946680	952280	to be double images because basically it's prisms and stuff. So essentially what would
952280	958200	happen is I would move it just a tiny bit and then it would start seeing double images
958200	962320	and stuff. So I just turned the slider down to 2D. But it's still great in 2D. It's
962320	968200	still a better looking system than the DS. The graphics are improved even in 2D. I might
968200	973240	not be playing the 3D stuff all that much, but the 3D actually does work with my eyes.
973240	980240	Whereas Avatar in the movie theater and my dad's new Panasonic 3D TV, I took my PS3
980240	987040	over and I couldn't see the 3D and my parents thought it was amazing. Nintendo got you there.
987040	991600	That's pretty cool though because you must have had that moment of like, whoa. Because
991600	996200	I think when everybody sees the 3DS for the first time, and we talked about this extensively
996200	1001280	yesterday, but just to kind of recap, I kind of said, okay, yeah it's a little gimmicky,
1001280	1006320	but it's a damn impressive gimmick. It definitely has the games to back it up and you go back
1006320	1009920	to the golden rule of gaming, the system is only as good as the games that are on it.
1009920	1013240	You know there's tons of great games coming out for this thing and graphically it's an
1013240	1018680	upgrade. But all gimmicks, so and so aside, there's still that moment when you first see
1018680	1026480	it where you're just kind of like, whoa, it really is kind of 3D and I'm not wearing glasses.
1026480	1032160	That's kind of cool. I mean, surely you probably had kind of that similar thing, but even probably
1032160	1036680	like double or triple so because you probably were very skeptical about it. Well actually
1036680	1043000	the first time I tried it I was looking at the Resident Evil trailer and I didn't really
1043000	1047560	know how the system worked so I was just kind of sitting there looking at it and I'm like,
1047560	1052840	yeah I don't see the 3D because they actually have these women behind there, behind each
1052840	1059920	system to kind of talk you through it. And I couldn't see it in the Resident Evil because
1059920	1065120	it was all double vision. I didn't know about having to tilt the angle vertically kind of.
1065120	1068400	You know, I kind of had to tilt the screen to be a specific scene. It's different for
1068400	1072640	everybody's eyes. And they didn't tell me that so I was just like, I can't see the 3D,
1072640	1077440	it's all just double images to me. And then I went over back to our PR rep and I was like,
1077440	1081340	yeah I didn't see it and they're like, well try this because the Metal Gear trailer was
1081340	1087320	more popping than the Resident Evil one. It was more extreme. And one of the girls behind
1087320	1092520	there said, I'm blind in my left eye and I can see the 3D in this. And so she trained
1092520	1099280	me and said, you should try tilting it this way and doing that. And then basically it
1099280	1103220	was right at the beginning of the Metal Gear trailer, there's the Kojima Studios logo and
1103220	1108400	it flies at you. That was my flinch holy shit moment, was the Kojima Studios logo flying
1108400	1113280	at me because I had finally gotten it right at the right angle and the woman, she was
1113280	1117920	very nice, but she said, yeah I'm blind in my left eye but I can still see this. And
1117920	1123480	she kind of helped me get it to the right area. I'm almost blown away but that is amazing.
1123480	1129840	She's blind in one eye and she can see it. That is a trip. That is very, very cool. Well
1129840	1132480	Bobby, if you don't mind, I'm going to spend some time with Shane and talk about what we
1132480	1135280	talked about today, but we'll come back to you a little later and see if there's anything
1135280	1138560	you want to add. If you want to jump in, just let me know. We only have kind of one mic
1138560	1142760	we're passing around here. You know, a very ghetto little portable kit. So again, if the
1142760	1146840	sound quality is bugging you, I apologize. This is much, much different than the usual
1146840	1151120	Sunday setup with a Dark Soccer and Loki. I do really, really want to make sure I do
1151120	1154280	plug the one and only Bobby Blackwolf show though. I'm sure most people that are actually
1154280	1158400	taking the time to listen this far into this already know about his show, but if you don't,
1158400	1162640	he's on right before us live on Sunday nights at All Games Radio, 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock
1162640	1170640	Eastern. Check it out. Miklotov, Shane, how you doing? Barely awake. Well I'm sorry, I
1170640	1176160	know we're keeping you up very late, but did you have a good day at E3 today? Yeah, despite
1176160	1180060	the fact that it wasn't the day we played the 3DS. I think today was a little bit more
1180060	1187000	fun, so that's how E3 should go I guess. Alright, well Shane and I kind of made a list of everything
1187000	1192120	we either kind of spent a long time looking at and got a tour through, or you know, we
1192120	1195120	actually got some hands-on time and played, so you want to go through this list a little
1195120	1201160	bit Shane? Let's start off with a game that kind of really surprised me with how much
1201160	1206880	I liked it, DC Universe. What did you think about DC Universe, Shane? It was actually
1206880	1212960	very fun. The thing with DC Universe that I was skeptical about is it's yet another
1212960	1219960	superhero MMO. There seems to be a whole lot of those out there these days, but this one
1219960	1228680	was more action, and you don't really find that in MMOs. It's still the same sort of
1228680	1234480	World of Warcraft style, you target an enemy and then you stand around and you hit a button
1234480	1238640	and then you attack, and then you wait, and then you attack again. This one, I was flying
1238640	1243360	around, running around, jumping, bashing things in the head, freezing them. It was really
1243360	1247920	fun. Yeah, I loved the fact that it was a little more action-based, and the demo we
1247920	1252120	had to play was a PvP demo, and it was really cool. The guy that was demoing it was showing
1252120	1256040	us all these tricks, and I gotta say, you know, it was kind of like Phantasy Star Online,
1256040	1260880	but on speed to me, because when I think action MMOs, there's not a lot I've really played
1260880	1265120	except for Phantasy Star Online and Phantasy Star Universe, but it was kind of like that,
1265120	1270680	but really fast-paced, and then kind of with that Warcraft twist where you do have bars
1270680	1274920	full of spells and things that you could use. So I'm curious to see kind of what the single-player
1274920	1278520	mode looks like. I will tell you one little tidbit we picked up on, though. I don't know
1278520	1283800	if this is out there completely yet, but the PlayStation 3 and the PC versions are not
1283800	1289560	gonna play together like a lot of people speculated they will, at least initially. I get the feeling
1289560	1294800	from the little demo we had that that's something that they might want to try to add in later.
1294800	1299200	I think the developers kind of think they can pull it off, but I think it's also kind
1299200	1302720	of like, I guess, they, you know, have other balancing things and, you know, because it's
1302720	1306600	two different systems or what have you. So if one of you was gonna get that on PS3 and
1306600	1310640	the other was on PC, do note you can't play together right off the bat, so I think that's
1310640	1315200	something a lot of folks are gonna want to take into consideration, yeah? So, cool, DC
1315200	1319080	Universe. When's that out? That was out, what, November 2nd, I think they said? All right,
1319080	1325320	how about Dead Rising 2, Shane? Let me preface this with I am scared to death of zombies
1325320	1332600	and the like, and I decided to, you know, face my fears, play some Dead Rising 2. The
1332600	1337840	game is really fun, very hilarious. I, what's his name, Chuck Green, I think, is the main
1337840	1343040	character you play as. Definitely dressed him up in some women's clothing, gave him
1343040	1348720	a nice little hat. At one point, I picked up a big stuffed pink elephant bear thing
1348720	1355720	and started hitting zombies with it. Saw some very hilarious gory moments, like some sort
1356840	1363840	of like lawnmower device just chewing up zombies and, oh, it was great. I had a really good
1363840	1368240	time. I actually think I want to get this game now, too. I gotta admit, it did look
1368240	1373520	a little like more of the same with the first one to me, but, you know, but upgraded in
1373520	1377760	the way that sequels should be upgraded, you know, it was a little more camp in some ways,
1377760	1381540	which I think is what everybody really appreciated about the first game and, you know, the main
1381540	1385720	character that they have now definitely seemed likable enough and, you know, I think people
1385720	1389720	are gonna get a kick out of the environment, especially, I think the whole like Vegas-y,
1389720	1392820	you know, what a fortune city or whatever they're calling it, the Vegas-like environment,
1392820	1397000	I think a lot of people are really gonna get a kick out of. LittleBigPlanet2, Shane, tell
1397000	1400040	me a little bit about what we did in that game, LittleBigPlanet2.
1400040	1406480	The level they gave us was somewhat of a race level, trying to reach the top before the
1406480	1413480	time limit. We failed, but it still let us keep going. I can't remember a game that had
1413600	1419600	made me smile and laugh so much while I was playing. It's really got a charm about it
1419600	1424400	that just makes you want to play more, which sucked because the demo, to me, felt so short,
1424400	1427480	but I know we were playing that thing for like five minutes at least.
1427480	1432320	Yeah, I think one important thing to note is that, you know, it really did kind of just
1432320	1435600	look and felt like the first game, you know, speaking of kind of, you know, games that
1435600	1440160	are more of the same, but you guys all know that the big innovation in LittleBigPlanet2
1440160	1444580	is kind of what they're letting you do now, you know, the expansion of the creation engine,
1444580	1447880	which is, you know, really the biggest part, and the part Shane left out about the race
1447880	1452380	is it was all about grappling hooks, and the part of what made it really funny is that,
1452380	1455600	you know, if Shane would be kind of like trying to grab on to something, I could actually
1455600	1459980	use my grappling hook to grab on to him, and it would kind of like, like the physics was
1459980	1463580	really good, I thought, and that was, you know, kind of the impressive part of the demo
1463580	1468840	is that they got the physics kind of, of all that complicated grappling and grappling mat
1468840	1474640	type of stuff down, so good times. So LittleBigPlanet2, I mean, I think a lot of you guys, like the
1474640	1479600	first one, are probably already going to check that out, and rightfully so. Tron, I played
1479600	1484160	the new Tron game, Tron Evolution, I believe it's called, on the 360, actually the version
1484160	1489740	I played is the PS3, but, you know, same same. Okay guys, it's Tron meets Prince of Persia,
1489740	1493840	like that's really what it felt like to me, you have the running up and wall jumping that
1493840	1498560	you do, and like seriously, the tutorial stage felt almost just like that first Prince of
1498560	1503200	Persia tutorial stage. The battle mechanics though, of course, are a lot different because,
1503200	1508560	you know, you're not really using a sword. The battle almost felt a little more like
1508560	1512360	Bayonetta to me, because like I could just practically button mash and do all this cool
1512360	1517720	shit, and there was like bullet time and all this, you know, kind of crazy stuff. The graphics
1517720	1524640	were simple, but that's what Tron's supposed to be, it's very true to the movie. It was
1524640	1529000	kind of hard for me to hear in the tunnel that they had, they had Tron in this big neon
1529000	1533120	kind of tunnel looking thing, it was a very, very cool setup, props to them, whoever designed
1533120	1538240	that booth. But, you know, it's very loud in there, but it sounded like the music I
1538240	1542880	could hear was kind of a repeat of the Daft Punk score that's supposed to be in the movie
1542880	1547640	and the music sounded like it was really good. Again, I'm kind of evaluating that on a very
1547640	1554240	quick demo and what I think I heard. But hopefully, a lot of the cool score will carry over. I
1554240	1557400	did have fun with it, I thought for an actiony game, it was it was a pretty cool little button
1557400	1562220	masher and it's Tron. Now, Shane, you don't even like know the Tron movie or what have
1562220	1567800	you, so did this game do anything for you? I know you just watched me play, but...
1567800	1574640	To be honest, not really. It seemed really bland. The graphics weren't that great, especially
1574640	1578680	considering the Wii one was right next to it, and it's kind of hard to tell the difference
1578680	1586200	between the two. And the environments were just really, really dull. It was a whole bunch
1586200	1593040	of black, blue, which, shockingly, you'd think I'd like, but it didn't look like a lot of
1593040	1597480	effort had been put into making the game. But that also might be the way the Tron series
1597480	1603040	is, but that doesn't translate well for a big, flashy video game.
1603040	1606240	Now see, I could tell the difference right away between the Xbox and the Wii one. Well,
1606240	1610240	for one, the Wii was all the light cycle racing, and I guess there's some of that in the PS3
1610240	1616240	one as well, but I don't know. It definitely looks sharper to me. I don't know with Shane
1616240	1622120	smoking, I think it'll be fine. But I guess, you know, if you don't know Tron at home listening,
1622120	1624840	then you're probably going to kind of look at this the same way. But for those of you
1624840	1628800	that are fans of Tron, like me, you're going to go like, oh, that's cool, because you throw
1628800	1634600	discs all over and doing these hops and bullet times and, woo, special effects.
1634600	1639840	Epic Mickey. We kind of had to watch one of the Disney employees play this, but we definitely
1639840	1643400	saw quite a bit of this game. Shane, what did you think of Epic Mickey?
1643400	1651040	It looked like a really solid platformer style game. I think the thing that interested me
1651040	1658720	the most, which is the one thing we didn't see a lot of, was the ability to erase and
1658720	1671240	regenerate certain aspects of stages. I did like the open-ended, not open-ended, but the
1671240	1677320	almost free-roaming little, what we saw, kind of tiki hut, is that what it's called? Yeah,
1677320	1683120	that section. The 2D was okay. I think that was probably my least favorite, but it looked
1683120	1685720	like a pretty interesting game.
1685720	1689000	I personally thought the 2D stuff looked kind of cool. It kind of looked like what maybe
1689000	1692800	you'd see on an Xbox Live arcade game or something, which was something, because the graphics
1692800	1695400	on the Wii were really good. Bobby wants to jump in on Epic Mickey.
1695400	1702480	Because I played it. Oh, yeah. That's right. Mickey is epic. I didn't play any of the 2D
1702480	1705480	stages. I played because there was another guy that was there that did the first part
1705480	1710260	of the demo, and I'm like, I'll just continue from here, because he had to run. But I battled
1710260	1718560	some enemies and stuff. Basically, it's kind of funny. Mickey can't directly hurt the enemies,
1718560	1725880	really. Basically, you've got your paint and your thinner. And basically, if you throw
1725880	1730240	enough paint at an enemy, it becomes your friend and starts fighting for you, kind of
1730240	1736240	like minions in Overlord and stuff. And I think if you do enough thinner at them, then
1736240	1740360	they go away and stuff. But there's actually some other things you can pick up. Like one
1740360	1747080	of the things that I did was pick up a special item that was a TV. And in order to distract
1747080	1751720	the guard, you threw the TV at him, and so he sits on his bucket and starts watching
1751720	1756040	Steamboat Willie on the TV. And then you can get around him and then basically take him
1756040	1761320	out, because there's this boat that needs to be risen, and so you need to get rid of
1761320	1765520	the anchors that are holding it down. And with the thinner, but you need to get in there.
1765520	1770840	So there's some puzzle elements. And then it wasn't really a boss, but it was a harder
1770840	1778160	enemy. Essentially, it has a can of paint in it, and it paints its own shell. So basically,
1778160	1782160	you fire paint at it to slow it down, and then you fire thinner at it to get rid of
1782160	1786800	its shell, and then he's got a weak spot that you hit for massive damage. And if you hit
1786800	1794800	this weak spot three times, then you beat him. And you can also have other of your friends
1794800	1799500	help him. And if you actually turn somebody to your side that has a can of thinner on
1799500	1805040	them, then they will, if they're your friend, they will throw thinner on the enemies and
1805040	1809000	hurt them and stuff. So it was really neat the way that they did it, and it looks really
1809000	1814320	good. It's very smooth and stuff, and it's still an early build. But I had a lot of fun
1814320	1819660	with it, and it looks like they are, because the guy told me War Inspector is a huge Disney
1819660	1824660	fanatic, especially of the older stuff, which is why the Steamboat Willie stuff is in there.
1824660	1828800	So he's really big on capturing the essence of Disney.
1828800	1834640	You know what really surprised me, though, just not knowing the old Disney as well as
1834640	1839920	the contemporary stuff? I was really surprised at how devious they let Mickey be in some
1839920	1844420	parts. I don't know if you saw the part with the tiki masks, but in the very beginning,
1844420	1849440	there's a little quest that Mickey's given to go get tiki masks. And what he can do,
1849440	1854520	he can go get the three masks and turn them in to the shopkeeper, and the shopkeeper will
1854520	1859840	reward him. Or what you can do, you find one mask, you give it to the shopkeeper, and then
1859840	1864560	the shopkeeper puts it in the back. Well, if you go walk around to the back of the building,
1864560	1869160	use paint thinner on the building, you can walk in the back door, take that mask, go
1869160	1874440	back out and give it back to him, and say, I found another mask. And I was kind of like,
1874440	1878000	it just kind of struck me as odd. I was always kind of like, I would have thought that, you
1878000	1884960	know, Von Disney would never let folks kind of portray Mickey in a negative light like
1884960	1888720	that. And his conscience or whatever, Gus or whatever that's kind of following around
1888720	1893440	is like, wow, I'm surprised you do that, Mickey. But it kind of makes him more bad. And you
1893440	1896760	could kind of see that because his his paint would be wearing off. And that's why he kind
1896760	1900120	of has that drippy look is because he had paint thinner. So I was kind of surprised
1900120	1904160	that you could kind of play it a little devious that Mickey didn't necessarily have to be
1904160	1908840	all good. I thought to me, that's the most fascinating part of Epic Mickey is the fact
1908840	1912940	that you can kind of play different ways. I really like games to let you do that. It's
1912940	1916920	very fable. I guess you could say, you know, you think your game kind of changes depending
1916920	1922100	on if you want to be good or bad. So yeah, Epic Mickey, very cool. A couple of DS games
1922100	1925680	that I know you checked out, Shane, I didn't get to spend a lot of time with these, but
1925680	1928120	Super Scribblenauts and the new Professor Layton.
1928120	1934240	Yeah, um, to be honest, I was not going to play Super Scribblenauts. It was an accident
1934240	1939440	thinking I was going to go play a different game. But I'm glad I did because I somewhat
1939440	1945060	liked the first Scribblenauts game. Like everyone had a problem with the controls. And I always
1945060	1954000	relied on anvils and laser guns to get through all the stages. But the nice lady at the demo
1954000	1959880	station was showing me just some of the stuff I could do. She's like, put whatever you want.
1959880	1965120	I was like, well, I don't know what to put. She's like, well, try, you know, big purple
1965120	1970900	pregnant dragon. I'm like, that's ridiculous. So okay. And sure enough, big dragon comes
1970900	1977320	out, has a little baby dragon. Like, what the crap? She's like, okay, go back and put
1977320	1981240	friendly in there somewhere. So I did that. And then the dragons fought each other. It's
1981240	1989620	like, okay, that's pretty cool. So with the controls being vastly improved and the inclusion
1989620	1996200	of adjectives, it actually looks like a really, really fun game. The other game I played was
1996200	2002840	Professor Layton Unwound Future or something like that. I don't remember exactly what it's
2002840	2007880	called. Newest Professor Layton game that's coming out this September, apparently. It's
2007880	2014360	Professor Layton. That's all you really need to know. It's fun. The one puzzle I did kind
2014360	2018760	of stumped me a little bit. Then the rep helped me out. So I felt really dumb because I actually
2018760	2025300	had it figured out. I just was too chicken to pick the wrong answer. I guess there's
2025300	2031840	a new inclusion to the memo function when you're in a puzzle. You can actually draw
2031840	2036800	in different colors and you can erase with an erase tool instead of just clearing the
2036800	2045280	entire thing, which is very handy. Both of those games, once again, I'm looking forward
2045280	2050120	to. I definitely will get Professor Layton. Scribblenauts is now on my list of things
2050120	2054320	I definitely will consider getting.
2054320	2057160	Since I've got to step it up and get through the rest of these games faster so we can actually
2057160	2060400	get to bed, do you want to describe Ghost Trick real quick, too? I know this is from
2060400	2062040	the guy who did Phoenix Wright.
2062040	2069560	Yeah, it's a game where you're a ghost and you have to manipulate objects to alter characters'
2069560	2080040	fate. They're fate because usually the characters die. At least they did in the demo. It's more
2080040	2088160	puzzle than anything else. Really interesting graphic style. The demo stumped me. I kind
2088160	2094000	of think I'm going to go back at some point tomorrow and try to beat it. It looks like
2094000	2098280	another brain teaser with lots of thinking involved from the same people that did Phoenix
2098280	2100640	Wright.
2100640	2103540	While he was playing some of those games, I actually checked out Goldeneye. The new
2103540	2106640	Goldeneye game is actually on the floor. It's kind of hard to find because Activision doesn't
2106640	2111960	have a booth, but Nintendo has it at their booth, only in a couple places. I got to fess
2111960	2116040	up, guys. If you've listened to O.L.R. a long time, you may already know this, but I never
2116040	2121560	really played Goldeneye 64. I didn't have Nintendo 64 until very late, so I never really
2121560	2128760	got into the craze until a little later. Playing this on the Wii was cool because it reminded
2128760	2134160	me of an old school shooter game. I get the sense that they have really just ported a
2134160	2138600	lot of the old game with new graphics. I suppose they were saying new stages and things too.
2138600	2142920	It's not just a copy of the old game. They want to make that very clear. It's new stuff
2142920	2148640	as well, not just Daniel Craig now. We were fighting multiplayer level and I was odd job
2148640	2152840	and I could throw my hat and stuff. It definitely reminded me of one of those old school arcade
2152840	2159480	shooters, very much like Perfect Dark, obviously, the connection between those games. Very interesting
2159480	2165280	that Activision is taking this over now. I know you only saw the game briefly, Shane,
2165280	2171160	Goldeneye, but did you notice anything lost in translation or anything? To me, it made
2171160	2176800	a very seamless transition from being a rare game to whoever is developing it now.
2176800	2182440	The only thing I noticed besides graphics that was a bit different, and this could just
2182440	2187480	be my memory being a little bit hazy, but I do not remember the ability to climb on
2187480	2195640	boxes and stuff like that, which was present in the demo we played. Otherwise, it looked
2195640	2204320	like a pretty faithful port of the Nintendo 64 with some updated features.
2204320	2207320	I think there will be a lot of people listening to this that are going to be into that. I
2207320	2210840	think about Bresloh and his love for Perfect Dark, I think a game like this will be right
2210840	2214880	up his alley. Quickly talking about some of the other games, we quickly got to observe
2214880	2220840	the Castlevania Xbox Live arcade game, heavily influenced by Symphony of the Night. Lots
2220840	2225880	of zoom ins and outs on the different stages. It looks like you have 10 minutes, and you
2225880	2231920	can cooperatively or combatively, I guess you could say, against each other go after
2231920	2237320	the boss, but these stages seem to be very large, and you make your way towards the boss.
2237320	2243720	There is only really one stage in the demo that we could see, but it looked interesting.
2243720	2246920	I think because it is in the same vein as Symphony of the Night, it could be a lot of
2246920	2251040	fun, but it doesn't look like, and maybe I should have asked this, but it doesn't look
2251040	2255800	like there is a lot of single player stuff. Although, I imagine there might be time trials,
2255800	2260400	things of that nature. We didn't get to dig too deep into this game, but Shane, anything
2260400	2264760	from your quick impressions of the Castlevania Xbox Live game? Harmony of Despair, I think
2264760	2271160	it is? I think it looks like crap. I don't like the premise. Graphically, they could
2271160	2276120	have cleaned it up a little bit. The guys we watched playing it clearly did not know
2276120	2283120	what they were doing, but the game also didn't seem to really give you much direction. I
2283120	2288320	don't know. I don't think it is something that they should have attempted. I might give
2288320	2291760	it a shot later on, but it definitely kind of has that Neo Geo effect with all the zoom
2291760	2296080	ins and outs, but I thought it looked good, and I am a fan of anything inspired by Symphony
2296080	2301160	of the Night, so I don't know Shane. You might want to give it a chance later. Here is a
2301160	2306800	game I am giving no chance at all. Saw 2. God, I watched Shane play the demo. If you
2306800	2312440	are eating something, you might want to pause this for a minute. In the very opening scene
2312440	2317400	of the demo, I think parodying a scene in the second movie, I have never seen it, but
2317400	2321960	I have heard about it, where the guy has to basically cut open his eye. Oh, God, it is
2321960	2328720	so gross. Were you doing that with the controller, actually cutting the eye? It was like, oh,
2328720	2335720	this is so disgusting. Shane, you described the demo as bleh. I had said when I saw the
2337000	2341680	Saw 2 game, I did not want to play the part where you cut open your eye, and of course
2341680	2348120	that is the first thing you do in the game, so I had to do it. Grossed me the heck out,
2348120	2352640	but much like the first Saw game, the game is really about puzzles and trying to figure
2352640	2359640	out stuff. I love it. It is kind of my replacement, or not my replacement, but just something
2363220	2367160	to get me through the time when we do not have Silent Hill, because it is still kind
2367160	2374160	of scary and it has got the nice atmosphere. It is very gory, and if you are at all squeamish,
2374160	2381160	I saw so many different things die during the five minutes I played of the demo, and
2382300	2387820	only one of them was me, thankfully. The rest were cut little flashbacks to people getting
2387820	2394820	impaled, sliced with a buzzsaw, all sorts of fun things. But yeah, it felt like a pretty
2394820	2401820	good game again, and I cannot wait for it to come out, but it is really gross.
2404700	2409700	That is the game I should show to my mother. These are what video games are, mom. Do not
2409700	2415540	you love these? Alright, here is a game my mom would like, but I would never understand
2415540	2426220	why. Glee Karaoke Revolution. Basically, it is Karaoke Revolution. It is the little bars
2426220	2431960	along the bottom that move with the pitch, and all the videos are Glee. So there is really
2431960	2438960	no interface in the game itself, besides just the little pitch bars and a very light shell
2438960	2445480	around that. There are no characters anymore. If you remember in Karaoke Revolution, you
2445480	2449200	would have these venues and things. No, you do not really have that anymore. It is just
2449200	2454560	videos from Glee that only kind of go with the songs, because they will try to show it,
2454560	2458160	synced up with how it was in the show, but since the songs in the show are shorter, they
2458160	2464520	will just throw in all these random clips. It was on the Wii, the version we were playing,
2464520	2470760	so the video quality was kind of poop. I watched Glee in HD at home when I was watching the
2470760	2476760	first few episodes, and I just thought the game was just kind of... I was barely singing
2476760	2482480	the song, and I got like five stars. Now granted, I was on the lowest difficulty, and it was
2482480	2487360	probably dumbed down because it was a demo, blah blah blah, but I just, I do not know.
2487360	2491760	I guess for the hardcore Glee fans, they will be all over it, but I just thought it was,
2491760	2495200	it is kind of one of those things where as you make a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy,
2495200	2499000	it starts to wear down a little bit, and that is kind of where I was at with Glee Karaoke
2499000	2502540	Revolution. I mean, it is a cute license idea. I mean, it is kind of one of those things
2502540	2505000	where once we saw it, it is like, oh yeah, of course, of course there was going to be
2505000	2512220	a Glee game. Shane, were your thoughts different? Nope. I also thought it was pretty terrible.
2512220	2517040	My problem with it is, and this is the same thing that has happened before, is that Konami
2517040	2525760	buys rights to a very, very popular IP and then does not put any effort into it, thinking
2525760	2531800	that the brand name will sell itself. Unfortunately, as we learned with the American Idol Karaoke
2531800	2539720	Revolution games, that is not going to work, and this is a very, very good opportunity
2539720	2545360	to make some money, but they just need to invest a little more because right now, I
2545360	2550160	do not see any potential in the game. The sad thing is though, Shane, I think it is
2550160	2553200	going to sell very well because I think there will be a lot of teenage girls that are like,
2553200	2556780	I love Glee, and they will buy the game on the Wii, and they do not look for the same
2556780	2560800	stuff we do. So I think you kind of have to take Shane and I's impressions of the game
2560800	2564320	with a big grain of salt. I think the game will still do really well. It is just not
2564320	2571040	going to do well with people listening to or recording video game podcasts about other
2571040	2575680	types of games, you know what I mean? There is an audience for this that is just not us.
2575680	2582440	Well, as someone who is a huge fan of Glee and has bought all five CDs, on the day they
2582440	2590200	came out, no less, each one of them, all I would need is just a few minor tweaks to the
2590200	2600160	interface, and I would actually be fine with, for the most part, what we saw. It just does
2600160	2606720	not feel like it is anywhere near done. I actually hope that is the case.
2606720	2610240	All right, just a couple of quick ones. We will kind of wrap up talking about what was
2610240	2615960	at Sega's booth and some of the things we saw there. Sonic 4, Episode 1. I think it
2615960	2619840	is pretty much what all of you are expecting. It looks like the old Sonic games, but with
2619840	2624980	HD graphics, that is really what it is. I mean, what else can you say about it? Either
2624980	2628320	you have played the old games or you have not. I do not know, did you notice any minor
2628320	2634200	tweaks that I might be overlooking, Shane? When I played it, it really did feel like
2634200	2639320	Sonic. His animations are a little slow at the moment, but I overheard them saying that
2639320	2646160	they were going to fix that. The boss fight felt a little more complex than what I was
2646160	2653080	used to from a Sonic game of that quality, so I am pleased. I cannot wait for it to come
2653080	2657120	out. I also overheard them talk about, well, we
2657120	2661200	had to take all of this into evaluation and listen to the fans. They wanted Sonic to be
2661200	2666760	able to accelerate faster from walking to running and all that stuff. I was just kind
2666760	2671200	of like, okay, yes, that is great, but I think on most people, sadly, that type of effort
2671200	2673520	will probably be lost because I think a lot of people are going to have that same type
2673520	2678040	of reaction where it is like, oh, hey, it is Sonic 2, but HD. That is not a bad thing.
2678040	2680760	Old Sonic games were when they were really the best.
2680760	2688160	Alright, Phantasy Star Portable 2. I do not know. It was pretty much just like the first
2688160	2691200	one to me. I did not get to ask a lot of questions on that. I really wanted to see if the pizza
2691200	2696320	box was still there. I do not know, Shane. Did you notice anything different, really,
2696320	2703240	except not being able to skip cut scenes? The only addition that they have really made,
2703240	2709300	it seems, is the ability to roll around and dodge, which, you know, if you were like me
2709300	2714280	and download the Japanese trial, you already knew that. Otherwise, it is pretty much the
2714280	2722440	same game. From what I understand, they had somewhat famous, I think, manga or anime artists
2722440	2727360	in Japan do the new character designs. They need to never do that again because they have
2727360	2730960	made the characters worse looking.
2730960	2733860	Are not a lot of the characters just kind of copied from old games because I swear that
2733860	2737480	shark you were fighting in the very beginning was like the same damn thing that was in the
2737480	2740420	Dreamcast PSO.
2740420	2745840	Those are completely different. I am talking about the characters you can create yourself.
2745840	2754560	They changed the faces. They changed the costumes. It does not look nearly as good, I think.
2754560	2758120	Really your character looked kind of cool to me, at least the one I saw. I did not think
2758120	2760840	it was terrible.
2760840	2766440	After spending a lot of time with the character creator in the first game, to me, I noticed
2766440	2769880	how bad. It is really the faces. The faces look really terrible.
2769880	2775640	I guess we will close out today with a game I know Bobby had wanted to say something to
2775640	2781640	on at some point. This is also at Sega's booth. Sega was also showing off some iPads. One
2781640	2787360	of the iPads had Super Monkey Ball 2 on the iPad. I think all of us got a chance to touch
2787360	2788360	that game.
2788360	2792200	Shane, we will start with you. What do you think of Super Monkey Ball 2 on the iPad?
2792200	2800760	The theme for tonight is, I guess, I hated it. It just controlled like crap. Seriously,
2800760	2806400	my iPhone plays Monkey Ball better than that iPad demo that they had, so I am not impressed.
2806400	2811480	Not making me want to buy an iPad. Not making me want to download another Monkey Ball game.
2811480	2815720	Bobby, was the demo lost on YouTube?
2815720	2819180	It is shit.
2819180	2823660	You know, I got the controls pretty quick. It is just that little device was calibrated
2823660	2830380	weird. At the end of the day, I was like, yeah, Monkey Ball was better a long time ago.
2830380	2831880	I think this one is going to be a pass.
2831880	2836840	There you go. I guess we are going to go ahead and wrap up for the night. We are ready to
2836840	2841400	go to bed. God, it is already 1.30 and I still have to get this uplifted. Thanks for staying
2841400	2846160	up with us or whatever time of day it is where you are and listening to the little wrap up
2846160	2847160	today.
2847160	2850600	We will probably do another quick one tomorrow. It probably will not be super long because
2850600	2855280	I know Bobby has to fly out to Atlanta and all that stuff. Tomorrow, we will try to give
2855280	2861000	you some final impressions. Our most favorite thing we have seen at the show we will get
2861000	2865520	to tomorrow. I know we are going to be seeing Final Fantasy XIV tomorrow. I am really hoping
2865520	2869360	to make it to Civ V. Actually, I am supposed to have some time to sit down with Civilization
2869360	2873280	V. It is actually exciting. I know Bobby is going to finally get to see Rock Band 3 tomorrow.
2873280	2876680	So we will have more stuff to talk about tomorrow. Again, if you have questions, feedback, whatever
2876680	2881680	Twitter is the best way to get us on the show floor. I actually did get some requests to
2881680	2888800	see things today that I took pictures of. There was NHL 11. Kirby's Epic Yarn I need
2888800	2892320	to get tomorrow again. I already put one picture up but somebody wanted to know more about
2892320	2896240	it. I will try to get that for impressions tomorrow. I am seeing the stuff on Twitter
2896240	2903600	guys so keep sending those. Twitter.com slash OLR. Any closing thoughts for the night, Bobby?
2903600	2909840	Monkey Ball and iPad is shit. Sounds good. Any closing thoughts for tonight, Shane?
2909840	2915920	I can't wait to live at the Final Fantasy XIV booth tomorrow and never leave it. Alright
2915920	2922280	guys, I guess my final thought is it is time to get this uploaded and go to bed. Cheesecake
2922280	2926800	is delicious just for the record. It is very good. Okay, have a good night everybody. We
2926800	2930760	will see you tomorrow with another Rob Roberts special here on the Orange Lounge Radio feed.
2930760	2935760	Good night.
