5543	10228	Everybody, it's Rob Roberts again here at E3 for a little special show for our feed here.
10408	12330	Rob Roberts and pals at E3.
12830	20358	It's the Wednesday edition or the second day of E3, although that's somewhat of a fib because it's technically Thursday right now as we tape this.
20919	24983	It's after 1230 in the morning, so it's even later than we taped last night.
25043	28626	But you'll notice my voice at least is doing a little better today, so that's a good thing.
29066	31908	So I hopefully won't be straining as bad as I was yesterday.
32489	36052	Anyhow, let's get right into the show and kind of talk about some of the things we saw today.
36092	41497	You know, we don't have a lot of news for you guys or anything, because I'm sure a lot of you guys have been reading the different websites.
41517	43899	We talked a lot about what the press conferences were all about yesterday.
44359	47522	But we just kind of want to tell you about our perspective on some of the things we've tried and
47782	49222	and some of the things we got our hands on.
49242	54684	I know a lot of our listeners have come to kind of want to know what we think of some of the games we get to get our hands on.
55604	64907	So I'll tell you a little bit about my experience in a little bit, but we want to catch up with definitely a pal of Orange Lounge Radio, somebody who's been a supporter of our show for a very long time.
64947	65907	We try to support him too.
66448	70151	The one and only, straight out of Atlanta, Bobby Blackwolf is here.
70431	71472	Woo!
71532	72092	That's me.
72192	72733	How you doing?
73453	83020	So, um, I wasn't able to be a part of the show last night because I was getting drunk and attempting to rickroll the entire Bethesda party and failed.
83761	84461	It was very terrible.
84501	92047	It was the low point of my E3 when they turned off the karaoke at 1am and I was one song away from rickrolling everybody.
92970	94552	That's my biggest disappointment of E3.
95213	98798	I do have to throw this in, though.
98918	107389	He may not have gotten to Rickroll everybody, but if you do want to see his awesome Night of Fire routine, it's all over Twitter right now, so check that out.
108735	109956	Yeah, we're getting to that.
111396	121521	I do want to say that I was a part of the Activision saying, hey, we didn't have to pay that bonus to Infinity Ward, let's throw a party event.
122522	134168	Which was, you've probably read about it and seen it, it's the six million dollar party they threw in the Staples Center on Monday night, showcasing just four games.
134952	141827	DJ Hero 2, Guitar Hero, Warriors of Rock, True Crime Hong Kong, and Call of Duty Black Ops.
142449	155238	with some cheap performers like Usher and Jane's Addiction and Soundgarden and this guy named Eminem with Rihanna and a stripper.
155498	156279	I love Eminems.
156999	157259	Yes.
157980	159141	I only want the red and black ones.
159501	164064	But the highlight obviously was the pole dancer.
164084	165966	I'm not going to say stripper because she didn't strip.
166526	171990	But the pole dancer, they lowered a pole from the rafters of the Staples Center.
172797	181040	and she literally went probably about halfway up, which is like to the club seats on this pole and hanging upside down and all that stuff.
181060	181720	She stole the show.
182580	188202	So yeah, $6 million and on top of that, they gave us free beer.
190283	195725	Well, clearly they had to bring in a pole dancer because the video game industry is so dominated by women and gay men.
197563	207465	Exactly, but to me, to me, that was the biggest F you to the former Infinity Ward guys because that was probably their bonus that they spent.
208186	218028	But hey, let me tell you guys this, you have never witnessed a video game trailer until you see it with full pyrotechnics all around you, the Call of Duty trailer.
218704	231058	is the same one you've probably seen online except they decided that it was going to, instead of the music being canned, they actually did have a full orchestra down in the pit playing the music for the trailer because the conductor was up on stage.
231078	232059	And I'm like, what is he conducting?
232159	234061	Oh, there's an orchestra down there because I was far in the back.
234665	254666	and then like halfway through you know just one big pyrotechnic like with explosion on the screen pyrotechnics went around and I was like oh that's cool they did some pyrotechnics and then every explosion for the rest of the trailer had either pyrotechnics or firecrackers from the top and it was that that was the way to experience a trailer I'm still not gonna play Call of Duty Black Ops
255791	264180	Is it possible that maybe they didn't just do it as like kind of like, you know, spend all that bonus money that, you know, they were supposed to pay out, but that maybe they sold the booth on eBay as well?
264200	266263	Because I noticed their booth is nowhere to be found.
266323	272770	So I think maybe they sold all the parts of the booth and that maybe paid for like the Dom Perignon that Eminem needed backstage.
274386	274966	Probably.
275727	276708	They do have a presence.
276748	279309	I mean, they've got a place, they've got some meeting rooms.
280190	292157	Basically what they're doing is that, you know, by appointment you can go in and basically they have these little rooms where you get a 30 minute demo of the game and sometimes hands-on and that's where they're showing all their games.
292638	298221	But it's by appointment only and they like it a lot better because it's not as hectic and loud and stuff.
298402	302024	So I did get to actually go in and see Guitar Hero.
302939	303680	Warriors of Rock.
303720	306281	I have not been able to see Rock Band yet, so don't ask me which one's better.
306821	311844	But, you know, kind of going into games, and this was actually one of the most recent things I saw as well.
312985	320749	It's Guitar Hero, but they showed us the Quest Mode, which is not Career Mode, it's Quest Mode now.
321410	323671	And it actually brings a little bit of, you know, it
324306	324606	and so on.
348411	354073	where you can select a friend's score off of the leaderboard and then it will show you how close you are to his score.
354513	359675	And then you can send him a message on Xbox Live making fun of him because you just beat his score.
360575	363696	Will I be able to spam his Twitter and his Facebook and everything else too?
364778	366399	No, I think it is just OS.
366419	368140	They've said it was just OS messages.
368240	377987	So it's, you know, you receive an Xbox Live message, kind of like what I get from Spazinator in some games, that, you know, he beat my high score in something.
379488	385111	Or the ones I love is that, you know, so-and-so wants to play Modern Warfare 2 with you, and I'm like, okay, do you listen to OLR?
385172	387833	Like, I just, no disrespect to those games.
388033	390355	I understand why they have an audience and so forth, but
390967	391387	Dance Masters
411280	415281	from Konami, which broke my Kinect virginity.
415842	421243	Because unfortunately, see what I've been doing, I've been working with e3coverage.com and we do a lot of interviews and stuff.
421704	433448	So when we go into appointments, it's not really about, for Game Tactics, for Justin Lee, who's the editor of Game Tactics, it's not really about seeing the games, it's about getting the interviews.
434028	437029	So we had an hour long Microsoft appointment and didn't see a single game.
437729	464046	because they brought in, since it's also a Canadian site, they brought up the Xbox Live manager for Canada and we interviewed him, the hardware manager for Canada and basically a lot of general people about Xbox in Canada and that was the entire hour was standing up there so I didn't get to really play Kinect except in the Konami booth and I'm a C dancer, that's what it said.
465195	488918	Now one thing I do want to say about it is the menu system this is what kind of threw me a little bit there might be a learning curve for some people because in the menu system for at least Dance Masters which is a third-party game so maybe Microsoft has it better it's very sensitive to your movements so basically you do the minority report type of thing like you know let's what happened to us is you know selecting the difficulty level between light and standard and
489498	498951	and to hit okay in Dance Masters, you have to put your hand up and then to the right and then, you know, kind of to touch the okay thing that's at the top right of the screen.
499472	502756	Well, when I had done it, I had said, okay, we're going to do standard and
503271	509432	and when I moved my arm up, and it's kind of funny, I'm doing this hand motion, I know you can't see it, but it's so I can explain it.
511052	513453	You're supposed to move your hand up and then to the right.
513493	516593	Well, when I moved it up, I didn't exactly move it straight up.
516913	518094	I went a little bit to the right.
518654	524075	And as I did that, it moved down to light, but I had already started the motion of hitting okay.
524755	526555	So it's going to take a little bit of getting used to.
526595	528995	You have to be a little bit more precise than you think.
529035	531696	And they're going to sit there and say, there's no learning curve.
532196	533617	But I think there might be for some people.
534517	537158	Well, you know, I had a little hands-on time with Dance Masters today, too.
537238	540499	And, you know, I played a song on there, too, and was going through the menu.
540539	547022	What kind of threw me was that, you know, Natal is supposed to be this whole, you're just going to hold up your hand and wave it around.
547062	551684	And as you wave it around, you'll be able to select the songs or, you know, whatever it is, change the channels.
552104	555265	You know, but I found as I was going through this Dance Masters, it was like, okay, I'm
555465	560029	Um, to choose the number of players, you're going to kind of, you're going to put your hand up and then you're going to put it over to the right.
560109	561611	And then it was like, okay, it changed the difficulty.
561631	563493	You're going to kind of reach around to left.
563553	565735	It's like, you know, you put your right hand in, you put your right hand out.
566015	566936	Can I shake it all about?
566956	568777	Okay, do the hokey pokey, turn yourself around.
569118	574222	You know, it's like, oh my gosh, like maybe it's just, there's going to be a natural learning curve with all that stuff.
574262	576044	And I'm being a little harsh, but I was kind of like,
576638	576958	Yeah.
576978	577078	Yeah.
604389	609076	I remember that, you know, where you have to, like, wave your hand over the circle and stuff, and yeah.
609857	613222	So, but that's the only Kinect experience I've had.
613282	617148	I'm probably not going to be able to see Kinectimals or any of the other stuff.
617548	619111	I did touch PlayStation Move.
619850	636580	You know there was a unfortunately we had to cancel our Sony appointment for another interview with an exec and so that's what so they canceled the Sony appointment but they do actually have some so some move games that are not required to stand in a three-hour line to get to so I play bowling
637520	661697	Brunswick Bowling and I will say that the controller actually feels good in your hand I mean it's it's you know it feels a little bit better than holding a Wii Remote to me but bowling and enemy it's it's it's kind of hard to see how more precise it is than like the Wii Remote when you're playing bowling because that's such like the simplistic version and the Wii does a very good job bowling already but no it was it was
662884	667705	It was really good to use, and there was rumble in the controller and everything.
668265	672386	So I really don't know what I can really say about it.
672426	678528	I didn't get to play the stuff they're really showing, because I'd have to wait in a three-hour line, and I just don't have three hours.
680288	680588	All right.
680909	690751	Well, I know Shane and I have a whole list of games we want to go over, but Bobby, between yesterday and today, are there any games that have caught your eye that you want to mention to the listenership right now?
692048	699450	Okay, so here's one that, now, gotta realize guys, before I say this, last year my second favorite game of show was Split Second.
700130	702370	And I'm not a fan of it now, now that it's out.
702830	705551	So take this with a grain of salt, because this might be another one.
706111	715733	Driver San Francisco, which was in Ubisoft, um, you know, yeah, the Driver games recently have been pretty bad, the ones that were by Atari, or were published by Atari.
716705	726651	but they've kind of gone back to the roots of the first Driver which was actually pretty good and the gameplay mechanic or gimmick or whatever you want to say in this was great.
727331	731694	Basically, the storyline for it really quick because it makes no sense.
732014	739438	They obviously made the storyline to fit the gimmick rather than making the gimmick fit the storyline is that the character you play is in a coma.
740038	744561	He doesn't realize he's in a coma, he just thinks he has superpowers but you're playing the entire game in his head.
745387	756511	and essentially he's learned that his superpower in this coma that's in his head is that he can jump, he can shift, that's the actual term in the game is shift, from car to car.
757091	774417	So you can be driving along in a car, hop out, but all you do is you hit the A button, it goes to an aerial view and a little, and like this white light of God or whatever and you can select another car, hit A and then you're immediately in that car driving around.
775100	792828	So, you basically can jump from car to car, and then in missions and stuff, the way you activate missions is you see a police chase in progress, you can activate that mission, you can either shift into the police car, or into the getaway car.
793769	795330	And you can complete the mission that way.
795830	802593	And you can even do stuff like, one of the missions I did had two cop cars chasing the runaway.
803536	808157	and I could switch between the two cop cars just with the press of a button.
808757	814198	And so if I kind of messed up with one and crashed into a wall, I could jump into the other one.
814218	818079	The AI would take over that car, get it back up, and you can do it that way.
818319	824320	And then what they said is, okay, you might not be able to catch them with the cop car, so you can shift out.
824700	827540	And there was a big rig about three blocks down.
827600	832141	I shifted into the big rig and did a head-on collision, and that completed the mission.
833427	859038	and they also said it's online and yes you can shift around online so it's like online races and stuff are going to change a lot with this because everybody's shifting into other cars and if you have enough they didn't say exactly like how you can build up the shift power or whatever but you could actually shift into one of the other people's cars and kick them out and they have to get another car so it's going to be interesting to see I mean it was a great demo just like Split Second was it's going to be interesting to see if it delivers in the final product
860194	869580	Alright, I have to admit, I've always had zero interest in the Driver series besides just kind of like making fun of Driver 3, but that whole kind of play mechanic sounds really interesting.
871101	874483	What about like maybe one other game that's kind of caught your attention over the past couple days?
878125	880786	Okay, well, basically, it's not really a game, but the 3DS.
882476	895461	I was able to go and get my hands on the 3DS, and as I've said on my show, I am one of the 15% of Americans that cannot see the 3D TV, I cannot see Avatar in 3D, basically it looks like a darker 2D to me.
895982	904265	It's because of my eye problems, I had eye surgery when I was 3, so my doctor knows about it, and there's really not much we can do about it.
904966	915292	That being said, if I turn the slider on the 3DS all the way up and hold it at an extremely specific angle, I can see 3D in the 3DS.
915412	916293	I can actually see it.
916733	927320	They had a trailer of Metal Gear Solid, or the Metal Gear game that's going to be on the 3DS, and I was flinching as some of the things were flying at me.
928000	933724	Now, the problem with this is that that's great for trailers, or watching a movie or whatever.
934724	943371	I tried to play Star Fox on it in 3D, and I realized how much I move the unit when I'm playing.
944011	950216	If I move it any little bit, it starts getting to be double images, because basically it's prisms and stuff.
950776	960163	So essentially what would happen is I would move it just a tiny bit, and then it would start seeing double images and stuff, so I'd just turn the slider down to 2D.
960864	963986	But it's still great in 2D, it's still a better looking system.
964526	965066	then the DS.
965107	985258	The graphics are improved even in 2D so I might not be playing the 3D stuff all that much but the 3D actually does work with my eyes whereas Avatar in the movie theater and you know my dad's new Panasonic 3D TV with I took my PS3 over I couldn't see the 3D my parents thought it was amazing so Nintendo got you there.
986795	1016345	That's pretty cool, though, because you must have had that moment of like, whoa, because I think when everybody sees the 3DS for the first time, and we talked about this somewhat extensively yesterday, but just to kind of recap, I kind of said, okay, yeah, it's a little gimmicky, but it's a damn impressive gimmick, and it definitely has the games to back it up, and you go back to the golden rule of gaming, a system is only as good as the games that are on it, and you know there's tons of great games coming out for this thing, and graphically it's an upgrade, but all gimmicks, so and so aside,
1016806	1025750	There's still that moment when you first see it where you're just kind of like, whoa, it really is kind of 3D and I'm not wearing glasses.
1026231	1027411	That's kind of cool.
1027831	1035535	I mean, surely you probably had kind of that similar thing, but even probably like double or triple so because you probably were very skeptical about it.
1036295	1037616	Well, actually, the first time I tried it,
1038490	1054482	I was looking at the Resident Evil trailer and I didn't really know how the system worked so I was just kind of sitting there looking at it and I'm like, yeah, I don't see the 3D because they actually have these women behind each system to kind of talk you through it.
1055340	1061026	And I couldn't see it in the Resident Evil because it was all double vision.
1061126	1065290	I didn't know about having to tilt the angle vertically, kind of.
1065350	1069194	I kind of had to tilt the screen to be a specific... And it's different for everybody's eyes.
1069795	1073779	And they didn't tell me that, so I was just like, I can't see the 3D, it's all just double images to me.
1074341	1092797	and then I went over back to our PR rep and I was like yeah I didn't see it and they're like well try this because the Metal Gear trailer was more popping than the Resident Evil one it was more extreme and one of the girls behind there said I'm blind in my left eye and I can see the 3D in this and so she trained me
1093457	1104023	and said you should try tilting it this way and doing that and then basically it was right at the beginning of the Metal Gear trailer there's the Kojima Studios logo and it flies at you.
1104163	1119931	That was my flinch holy shit moment was the Kojima Studios logo flying at me because I had finally gotten it right at the right angle and the woman who she was very nice but she said yeah I'm blind in my left eye but I can still see this and she kind of helped me get it to the right area.
1121159	1123300	I'm almost blown away, but that is amazing.
1123380	1125261	She's blind in one eye and she can see it.
1125421	1127002	That is a trip.
1127242	1128743	That is very, very cool.
1129783	1135826	Well, Bobby, if you don't mind, I'm going to spend some time with Shane talking about what we talked about today, but we'll come back to you a little later, see if there's anything you want to add.
1135846	1137327	If you want to jump in, just let me know.
1137687	1142089	We only have kind of one mic we're passing around here, you know, very ghetto, little portable kit.
1142129	1144690	So again, if the sound quality is bugging you, I apologize.
1145114	1149035	This is much, much different than the usual Sunday setup with a DarkSakura and Loki.
1149055	1153156	I do really, really want to make sure I do plug the one and only Bobby Blackwolf show, though.
1153236	1163118	I'm sure most people that are actually taking the time to listen this far into this already know about his show, but if you don't, he's on right before us, live on Sunday nights at All Games Radio, 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern.
1163459	1163959	Check it out.
1164859	1166319	Miklatov, Shane, how you doing?
1167620	1168440	Barely awake.
1169900	1170480	Well, I'm sorry.
1170500	1173301	I know we're keeping you up very late, but did you have a good day at E3 today?
1174730	1183376	Yeah, despite the fact that it wasn't the day we played the 3DS, I think today was a little bit more fun, so that's how E3 should go, I guess.
1184476	1195584	Alright, well Shane and I kind of made a list of everything we either kind of spent a long time looking at and got a tour through, or we actually got some hands-on time and played, so you want to go through this list a little bit, Shane?
1196244	1199146	Let's start off with a game that kind of really...
1200367	1201731	surprised me with how much I liked it.
1201811	1202814	DC Universe.
1203335	1204940	What did you think about DC Universe, Shane?
1206270	1207671	It was actually very fun.
1208912	1215177	The thing with DC Universe that I was skeptical about is it's yet another superhero MMO.
1215818	1226206	There seems to be a whole lot of those out there these days, but this one was more action and you don't really find that in MMOs.
1226266	1229968	It's still the same sort of World of Warcraft style.
1230089	1235773	You target an enemy and then you stand around and you hit a button and then you attack and then you wait
1236033	1236894	and then you attack again.
1237274	1242897	This one, I was flying around, running around, jumping, bashing things in the head, freezing them.
1242977	1243617	It was really fun.
1244858	1250221	Yeah, I love the fact that it was a little more action-based and the demo we got to play was a PvP demo and it was really cool.
1250241	1252883	The guy that was demoing it was showing us all these tricks and
1253305	1257007	I gotta say, you know, it was kind of like Phantasy Star Online, but on speed, to me.
1257027	1263732	Because, like, when I think action MMOs, like, there's not a lot I've really played except for Phantasy Star, you know, Online and Phantasy Star Universe.
1263772	1266493	But it was kind of like that, but really fast-paced.
1266894	1272958	And then kind of with that Warcraft twist, where you do have, you know, bars full of spells and things that you could use.
1273298	1275519	So I'm curious to see kind of what the single-player mode looks like.
1275840	1277961	I will tell you one little tidbit we picked up on, though.
1278281	1282744	I don't know if this is out there completely yet, but the PlayStation 3 and the PC versions...
1283194	1284755	are not going to play together.
1285496	1288258	Like a lot of people speculated, they will, at least initially.
1288798	1294362	I get the feeling from the little demo we had that that's something that they might want to try to add in later.
1294823	1304030	I think the developers kind of think they can pull it off, but I think it's also kind of like, I guess they have other balancing things because it's two different systems or what have you.
1304070	1309994	So if one of you was going to get that on PS3 and the other was on PC, do note you can't play together right off the bat.
1310054	1310935	So I think that's something
1311437	1313779	A lot of folks are going to want to take into consideration, yeah?
1314360	1315701	So, cool, DC Universe.
1315721	1316161	When's that out?
1316181	1317983	That was out, what, November 2nd, I think they said?
1318837	1320178	All right, how about Dead Rising 2, Shane?
1321598	1331403	Let me preface this with I am scared to death of zombies and the like, and I decided to, you know, face my fears, play some Dead Rising 2.
1331443	1334804	The game is really fun, very hilarious.
1336005	1336485	What's his name?
1336525	1338866	Chuck Green, I think, is the main character you play as.
1339907	1342168	Definitely dressed him up in some women's clothing.
1342668	1343369	I had a really good time.
1343389	1345250	I actually think I want to get this game now too.
1367284	1375208	I gotta admit, it did look a little more of the same with the first one to me, but upgraded in the way that sequels should be upgraded.
1375408	1380451	It was a little more camp in some ways, which I think is what everybody really appreciated about the first game.
1381311	1385093	The main character that they have now definitely seemed likable enough.
1385113	1387814	I think people are going to get a kick out of the environment especially.
1387834	1394658	I think the whole Vegas-y, Fortune City or whatever they're calling it, the Vegas-like environment, I think a lot of people are really going to get a kick out of.
1395620	1396943	LittleBigPlanet2.
1397083	1399769	Shane, tell them a little bit about what we did in that game, LittleBigPlanet2.
1401150	1407035	The level they gave us was somewhat of a race level, trying to reach the top before the time limit.
1407075	1409257	We failed, but it still let us keep going.
1410558	1416483	I can't remember a game that had made me smile and laugh so much while I was playing.
1417844	1427132	It's really got a charm about it that just makes you want to play more, which sucked because the demo, to me, felt so short, but I know we were playing that thing for like five minutes at least.
1428564	1436391	Yeah, I think one important thing to note is that, you know, it really did kind of just look and felt like the first game, you know, speaking of kind of, you know, games that are more of the same.
1436811	1445838	But you guys all know that the big innovation in LittleBigPlanet 2 is kind of what they're letting you do now, you know, the expansion of the creation engine, which is, you know, really the biggest part.
1446359	1449421	And the part Shane left out about the race is it was all about grappling hooks.
1449641	1457408	And the part of what made it really funny is that, you know, if Shane would be kind of like trying to grab onto something, I could actually use my grappling hook to grab onto him.
1458362	1461083	And it was kind of like the physics was really good, I thought.
1461483	1469847	And that was, you know, kind of the impressive part of the demo is that they got the physics kind of of all that complicated grappling and grappling that type of stuff down.
1469927	1471148	So, good times.
1472228	1477570	So, LittleBigPlanet 2, I mean, I think a lot of you guys that liked the first one were probably already going to check that out, and rightfully so.
1478811	1482352	Tron, I played the new Tron game, Tron Evolution, I believe it's called, on the 360.
1483673	1486174	Actually, the version I played is the PS3, but, you know, same, same.
1486953	1489374	Okay, guys, it's Tron meets Prince of Persia.
1489674	1491135	Like, that's really what it felt like to me.
1491455	1499758	You have the running up and wall jumping that you do, and, like, seriously, the tutorial stage felt almost just like that first Prince of Persia tutorial stage.
1500479	1506221	The battle mechanics, though, of course, are a lot different because, you know, you're not really using a sword.
1506781	1516165	The battle almost felt a little more like Bayonetta to me because, like, I could just practically button mash and do all this cool shit, and there was, like, bullet time and all this, you know, kind of crazy stuff.
1517098	1521540	The graphics were simple, but that's what Tron's supposed to be.
1521960	1523061	It's very true to the movie.
1524441	1529903	It was kind of hard for me to hear in the tunnel that they had Tron in this big neon kind of tunnel looking thing.
1529923	1531284	It was a very, very cool setup.
1531344	1533505	Props to them, whoever designed that booth.
1536174	1544919	It's very loud in there, but it sounded like the music I could hear was kind of a repeat of the Daft Punk score that's supposed to be in the movie, and the music sounded like it was really good.
1545620	1553805	Again, I'm kind of evaluating that on a very quick demo and what I think I heard, but hopefully a lot of the cool score will carry over.
1554164	1554905	I did have fun with it.
1554945	1558970	I thought for an action-y game, it was a pretty cool little button masher and it's Tron.
1559450	1564977	Now, Shane, you don't even know the Tron movie or what have you, so did this game do anything for you?
1565057	1566179	I know you just watch me play, but...
1567228	1569449	Um, to be honest, not really.
1569749	1571890	It seemed really bland.
1572170	1579453	The graphics weren't that great, especially considering the Wii one was right next to it, and it's kind of hard to tell the difference between the two.
1581294	1584595	And the environments were just really, really dull.
1585575	1586656	It was a whole bunch of black.
1587376	1594978	Blue, which, shockingly, you know, you'd think I'd like, but it was just, I don't know, it didn't look like a lot of effort had been put into making the game.
1595018	1601739	But that also might be the way the Tron series is, but that doesn't translate well for a big, flashy video game.
1603020	1605980	Now, see, I could tell the difference right away between the Xbox and the Wii one.
1606020	1612722	Well, for one, the Wii was all the light cycle racing, and I guess there's some of that in the 360 and PS3 one as well, but I don't know.
1613042	1615143	It definitely looks sharper to me, and I don't know.
1615183	1616083	I don't know what Shane's smoking.
1616123	1616723	I think it'll look fine.
1617165	1624168	But I guess, you know, if you don't know Tron at home listening, then you're probably going to kind of look at this the same way.
1624208	1633311	But for those of you that are fans of Tron, like me, you're going to go like, oh, that's cool, because you're throwing discs all over and doing these hops and bullet times and woo, special effects.
1634432	1635032	Epic Mickey.
1635832	1641174	We kind of had to watch one of the Disney employees play this, but we definitely saw quite a bit of this game.
1641534	1643435	Shane, what did you think of Epic Mickey?
1644795	1648878	It looked like a really solid platformer style game.
1649998	1661966	I think the thing that interests me the most, which is the one thing we didn't get to see a lot of, was the ability to erase and regenerate certain aspects of stages.
1664827	1677952	I did like the almost free-roaming little Tiki Hut section.
1678892	1684594	The 2D was okay, I think that was probably my least favorite, but it looked like a pretty interesting game.
1685848	1687709	I personally thought the 2D stuff looked kind of cool.
1687749	1693750	It kind of looked like what maybe you'd see on an Xbox Live arcade game or something, which was something because the graphics on the Wii were really good.
1693910	1695391	Bobby wants to jump in on Epic Mickey.
1696231	1697131	Because I played it.
1697872	1700452	Oh yeah, that's right, Mickey is epic.
1701293	1702673	I didn't play any of the 2D stages.
1702753	1706314	I played because there was another guy that was there that did the first part of the demo and I'm like,
1706977	1708778	I'll just continue from here because he had to run.
1709759	1712621	But I battled some enemies and stuff.
1713882	1718926	Mickey can't directly hurt the enemies, really.
1720107	1722869	Basically, you've got your paint and your thinner.
1723761	1733129	and you basically, if you throw enough paint at an enemy, it becomes your friend and starts fighting for you, kinda like minions in Overlord and stuff.
1733750	1736873	And I think if you do enough thinner at them, then they go away.
1737846	1766717	and stuff but there's actually some other things you can pick up like one of the things that I did was pick up like a special item that was a TV and in order to distract the guard you threw the TV at him and so he sits on his bucket and starts watching Steamboat Willie on the TV and then you can get around him and then basically take him out because there's this boat that needs to be risen and so you need to get rid of the anchors that are holding it down and with the thinner but you need to get in there and so there's some puzzle elements and
1767190	1776796	and then the boss, it wasn't really a boss but it was a harder enemy, essentially it has a can of paint in it and it paints its own shell.
1777597	1785742	So basically you fire paint at it to slow it down and then you fire thinner at it to get rid of its shell and then he's got a weak spot that you hit for massive damage.
1786323	1789745	And if you hit this weak spot three times then you beat him.
1790045	1794248	And you can also have other of your friend's
1794861	1806012	Help them and if you actually turn somebody to your side that has a can of thinner on them then they will, if they're your friend, they will throw thinner on the enemies and hurt them and stuff.
1806052	1809256	So it was really neat the way that they did it and it looks really good.
1809296	1812519	It's very smooth and stuff and it's still an early build.
1813347	1842212	but I had a lot of fun with it and it looks like they are because the guy told me Warren Spector is a huge Disney fanatic especially of the older stuff which is why you know the Steamboat Willie stuff is in there so he's really big on capturing the essence of Disney you know what really surprised me though just you know not knowing the old Disney as well as you know the contemporary stuff I was really surprised at how devious they let Mickey be in some parts like I don't know if you saw the part with the tiki masks
1842571	1847913	But in the very beginning, you know, there's a little quest that Mickey's given to go get Tiki masks.
1848534	1855057	And what he can do, he can go get the three masks and turn them in to the shopkeeper and, you know, the shopkeeper will reward him.
1855237	1861439	Or what you can do, you find one mask, you give it to the shopkeeper, and then the shopkeeper puts it in the back.
1861860	1871584	Well, if you go walk around to the back of the building, use paint thinner on the building, you can walk in the back door, take that mask, go back out and give it back to him and say, I found another mask.
1872267	1875730	And I was kind of like, that, it just kind of struck me as odd.
1875810	1884958	I was always kind of like, I would have thought that, you know, Vaughn Disney would never let folks kind of portray Mickey in a negative light like that.
1885038	1890362	And his conscience or whatever, Gus or whatever that's kind of following around is like, wow, I'm surprised you do that, Mickey.
1890762	1892644	But it kind of makes him more bad.
1893260	1898864	and you could kind of see that because his paint would be wearing off and that's why he kind of has that drippy look is because he had paint thinner.
1899164	1904567	So I was kind of surprised that you could kind of play it a little devious that Mickey didn't necessarily have to be all good.
1904987	1909010	I thought to me that's the most fascinating part of Epic Mickey is the fact that
1909551	1911293	Super Scribblenauts and The New Professor Layton
1928891	1933014	Yeah, to be honest, I was not going to play Super Scribblenauts.
1933074	1935957	It was an accident, thinking I was going to go play a different game.
1936897	1941281	But I'm glad I did, because I somewhat liked the first Scribblenauts game.
1942121	1946905	Like everyone, I had a problem with the controls, and I always relied on anvils and...
1948126	1958430	LaserGuns to get through all the stages, but the nice lady at the demo station was showing me just some of the stuff I could do.
1958550	1959830	She was like, put whatever you want.
1959850	1961771	I was like, well, I don't know what to put.
1961811	1966273	She's like, well, try, you know, big, purple, pregnant dragon.
1966333	1968073	I'm like, that's ridiculous, so okay.
1968633	1969454	And sure enough,
1970234	1973056	Big Dragon comes out, has a little baby dragon.
1973636	1975017	And I'm like, what the crap?
1975297	1978739	And she's like, OK, go back and put Friendly in there somewhere.
1978799	1979400	So I did that.
1979720	1981041	And then the dragons fought each other.
1981061	1983322	I was like, OK, that's pretty cool.
1983562	1993008	So with the controls being vastly improved and the inclusion of adjectives, it actually looks like a really, really fun game.
1994529	2001090	The other game I played was Professor Layton Unwound Future or something like that.
2001691	2003171	I don't remember exactly what it's called.
2003571	2006031	Newest Professor Layton game that's coming out this September apparently.
2007492	2008772	It's Professor Layton.
2009192	2011193	That's all you really need to know.
2011273	2011813	It's fun.
2012733	2019454	The one puzzle I did kind of stumped me a little bit and then the rep helped me out so I felt really dumb because I actually had it figured out.
2019474	2022375	I just was too chicken to pick the wrong answer.
2024996	2030540	I guess there's a new inclusion to the memo function when you're in a puzzle.
2030620	2039786	You can actually draw in different colors and you can erase with an erase tool instead of just clearing the entire thing, which is very handy.
2041968	2045550	Both of those games, once again, I'm looking forward to.
2046111	2047512	I definitely will get Professor Layton.
2047872	2052215	Scribblenauts is now on my list of things I definitely will consider getting.
2054160	2059401	Since I gotta step it up and get through the rest of these games faster so we can actually get to bed, do you want to describe Ghost Trick real quick too?
2059441	2061402	I know this is from the guy who did Phoenix Wright?
2062322	2072884	Yeah, it's a game where you're a ghost and you have to manipulate objects to alter characters' destiny, not destiny, fate.
2073464	2075765	Yeah, their fate, because usually the characters die.
2076325	2077305	At least they did in the demo.
2078826	2081507	It's more puzzle than anything else.
2082887	2084888	Really interesting graphic style.
2086529	2087609	The demo stumped me.
2087669	2090691	I kind of think I'm going to go back at some point tomorrow and try to beat it.
2092471	2098534	But it looks like another kind of brain teaser with lots of thinking involved from the same people that did Phoenix Wright.
2100194	2127778	um while he was playing some of those games I actually checked out GoldenEye uh the new GoldenEye game is actually on the floor it's kind of hard to find because Activision doesn't have a booth but Nintendo has it at their booth just only in a couple places um and I gotta fess up guys if you've listened to LR a long time you may already know this but uh I never really played GoldenEye 64 I just you know I didn't really have a Nintendo 64 until very late so I never really got into the craze until kind of a little later um so playing this on the Wii it was cool because it kind of you know
2128414	2129855	Old School Arcade Shooters
2158326	2161109	But, you know, very interesting that Activision is kind of taking this over now.
2162089	2169575	I know you only saw the game briefly, Shane Goldeneye, but did you notice anything lost in translation or anything?
2169596	2174920	I mean, to me, it made a very seamless transition from being a rare game to, you know, whoever's developing it now.
2176711	2193856	The only thing I noticed besides graphics that was a bit different, and this could just be my memory being a little bit hazy, but I do not remember the ability to climb on boxes and stuff like that, which was present in the demo we played.
2194296	2201338	But otherwise, it looked like a pretty faithful port of the Nintendo 64 one with some updated features.
2202678	2202778	Yep.
2204352	2206934	I think there'll be a lot of people listening to this that are going to be into that.
2206974	2209435	Like, you know, I think about Bress Lowell and his love for Perfect Dark.
2209476	2211337	I think a game like this will be right up his alley.
2212097	2219943	Quickly talking about some of the other games, we quickly got to observe the Castlevania Xbox Live Arcade game, heavily influenced by Symphony of the Night.
2220663	2223645	Lots of zoom-ins and outs on kind of the different stages.
2223725	2230890	It looks like you have like 10 minutes to, and you can cooperatively or, you know, combatively, I guess you could say, against each other, kind of,
2231320	2237373	Go after the boss but these stages seem to be very large and you kind of make your way towards the boss.
2237393	2239899	There's only really one stage in the demo that we could see but it
2241334	2242415	It looked interesting.
2242495	2242855	I don't know.
2242875	2247217	I think because it's in the same vein as Symphony of the Night, it could be a lot of fun.
2247637	2252560	But it doesn't look like, and maybe I should have asked this, but it doesn't look like there's a lot of single player stuff.
2252920	2256562	Although I imagine there might be time trials, things of that nature.
2256602	2256922	I don't know.
2257222	2259583	We didn't get to dig too deep into this game.
2259623	2263505	But Shane, anything from your quick, quick impressions of the Castlevania Xbox Live game?
2263765	2264886	Harmony of Despair, I think it is?
2265866	2266766	I think it looks like crap.
2267847	2268767	I don't like the premise.
2269928	2272309	Graphically, they could have cleaned it up a little bit.
2273669	2276950	The guys we watched playing it clearly did not know what they were doing.
2278831	2282392	But the game also didn't seem to really give you much direction.
2283453	2283773	I don't know.
2284013	2285874	I don't think it's something that they should have attempted.
2287929	2317068	I might give it a shot later on but it definitely kind of has that Neo Geo effect with all the zoom ins and outs but I thought it looked good and you know I'm a fan of anything inspired by Symphony of the Night so I don't know Shane you might want to give it a chance later here's a game I'm giving no chance at all Saw 2 god I watched Shane play the demo and like okay if you're eating something you might want to pause this for a minute okay okay so like in the very opening scene of the demo it's I think parodying a scene in the second movie I've never seen it but I've
2317475	2321137	I've heard about it where like the guy has to basically like cut open his eye or whatever.
2321157	2322398	Oh God, it's so gross.
2323058	2326280	And like you actually have to, what were you doing that with a controller?
2326320	2327721	Like actually like cutting the eye?
2328141	2330382	And it was like, oh, this is so disgusting.
2330943	2332503	Shane, you described the demos.
2334780	2340723	Um, I had said when I saw the Saw 2 game, I did not want to play the part where you cut open your eye.
2340743	2344025	And of course, that's the first thing you do in the game, so I had to do it.
2344465	2346626	Grossed me the heck out.
2347887	2353250	But, much like the first Saw game, the game is really about puzzles and trying to figure out stuff.
2353810	2355211	and I love it.
2355871	2377102	It's kind of my replacement or not my replacement but just something to get me through the time when we don't have Silent Hill because it is still kind of scary and it's got the nice atmosphere but it's very gory and if you are at all squeamish I saw so many
2377722	2379103	Different things die.
2379583	2384847	During the five minutes I played of the demo, only one of them was me, thankfully.
2385248	2394935	The rest were cut little flashbacks to people getting impaled, sliced with a buzzsaw, all sorts of fun things.
2396336	2400739	But yeah, it felt like a pretty good game again, and I cannot wait for it to come out.
2401159	2402360	But it is really gross.
2404562	2406103	That's the game I should show to my mother.
2406935	2408576	Be like, these are what video games are, Mom.
2408936	2409877	Don't you love these?
2410277	2415721	All right, how about... No, no, here's a game my mom would like, but I would never understand why.
2416542	2418383	Glee Karaoke Revolution.
2419624	2420124	Yeah.
2420564	2421745	Okay, here's the thing, guys.
2422806	2425368	Basically, it's Karaoke Revolution.
2425408	2427689	It's the little bars along the bottom that move with the pitch.
2428430	2430931	And it's just all the videos are Glee.
2431372	2434454	So there's really no interface whatsoever.
2435442	2443647	In the game itself, besides just the little pitch bars and a very, very light shell around that, there's no characters anymore.
2443967	2446668	As soon as you remember in Karaoke Revolution, you'd have these venues and things.
2446749	2448169	Nope, you don't really have that anymore.
2448209	2460476	It's just videos from Glee that only kind of go with the songs because they'll try to show it synced up with how it was in the show, but since the songs in the show are shorter, they'll just throw in all these random clips.
2462437	2464999	And it was on the Wii, the version we were playing, so the video...
2465779	2467040	Quality was kind of poop.
2467520	2479450	Like, you know, I watched Glee in HD at home, you know, when I was watching the first few episodes, and I don't know, I just thought the game was just kind of... I was barely singing the song, and I got like five stars.
2480531	2484494	Now, granted, I was on the lowest difficulty, and it's probably dumbed down because it was a demo, blah, blah, blah.
2484955	2486196	But I just, I don't know.
2487077	2490980	You know, I guess for the hardcore Glee fans, they'll be all over it, but I just thought it was...
2491690	2499615	It's kind of one of those things where as you make a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy, it starts to wear down a little bit, and that's kind of where I was at with Glee Karaoke Revolution.
2499915	2501436	I mean, it's a cute license idea.
2501676	2505599	I mean, it's kind of one of those things where once we saw it, it's like, oh yeah, of course, of course there was going to be a Glee game.
2506179	2507460	Shane, were your thoughts different?
2508598	2511280	Nope, I also thought it was pretty terrible.
2512201	2528055	My problem with it is, and this is the same thing that's happened before, is that Konami buys rights to a very, very popular IP and then does not put any effort into it thinking that the brand name will sell itself.
2528895	2533618	Unfortunately, as we learned with the American Idol Karaoke Revolution games, that's not going to work.
2535659	2546925	And this is a very, very good opportunity to make some money, but I just need to invest a little more because right now I don't see any potential in the game.
2548624	2557608	The sad thing is, though, Shane, I think it's going to sell very well because I think there'll be a lot of teenage girls that are like, I love Glee, and they'll buy the game on the Wii, and they don't look for the same stuff we do.
2557729	2561771	So I think you kind of have to take Shane and I's impressions of the game with a big grain of salt.
2562111	2563832	I think the game will still do really well.
2563892	2571635	It's just not going to do well with people listening to or recording video game podcasts about other types of games.
2571675	2572236	You know what I mean?
2572716	2574877	There's an audience for this that's just not us.
2575973	2598721	Well, as someone who is a huge fan of Glee and has bought all five CDs, on the day they came out, no less, each one of them, all I would need is just a few minor tweaks to the interface, and I would actually be fine with, for the most part, what we saw.
2599381	2602902	It just doesn't feel like it's anywhere near done.
2603442	2604783	I actually hope that's the case.
2606670	2607991	Alright, just a couple quick ones.
2608011	2612714	We'll kind of wrap up talking about what was at Sega's booth and some of the things we saw there.
2612774	2617656	Sonic 4, Episode 1, I think it's pretty much what all of you are expecting.
2617737	2620858	It looks like the old Sonic games, but with HD graphics.
2620978	2623080	That's really what it is.
2623140	2624701	I mean, what else can you say about it?
2624741	2626542	Either you've played the old games or you haven't.
2626882	2630164	I don't know, did you notice any minor tweaks that I might be overlooking, Shane?
2631964	2634625	When I played it, it really did feel like Sonic.
2635325	2640266	His animations are a little slow at the moment, but I overheard them saying that they were going to fix that.
2641627	2649989	The boss fight felt a little more complex than what I was used to from a Sonic game of that quality.
2650049	2651650	So I'm pleased.
2651990	2653270	I can't wait for it to come out.
2654355	2659577	You know, I also overheard them talk about, you know, well, we had to kind of take all this into evaluation and listen to the fans.
2660218	2666180	And they wanted Sonic to be able to accelerate faster from, you know, walking to, you know, running and, you know, all that stuff.
2666220	2668482	And I was just kind of like, okay, yeah, that's great.
2668542	2672083	But I think on most people, sadly, that type of effort will probably be lost.
2672103	2675645	Because I think a lot of people are going to have that same type of reaction where it's like, oh, hey, it's Sonic 2 but HD.
2675985	2676765	But that's not a bad thing.
2677065	2680267	You know, the old Sonic games were when they were really the best.
2681255	2695965	Um, alright, Phantasy Star Portable 2, I, I don't know, it was pretty much just like the first one to me, I didn't get to ask a lot of questions on that, I really wanted to see if the pizza box was still there, but, uh, I don't know, Shane, did you notice anything different, really?
2696266	2698327	Except not being able to skip cutscenes.
2699985	2706169	The only addition that they've really made, it seems, is the ability to roll around and dodge.
2707630	2711553	Which, you know, if you were like me and downloaded the Japanese trial, you already knew that.
2713055	2714996	Otherwise, it's pretty much the same game.
2716137	2724403	From what I understand, they had somewhat famous, I think, manga or anime artists in Japan do the new character designs.
2724904	2726065	They need to never do that again.
2726745	2728827	Because they've made the characters worse looking.
2730834	2733140	Aren't a lot of the characters just kind of copied from old games?
2733160	2738634	Because I swear that shark you were fighting in the very beginning was like the same damn thing that was in the Dreamcast PSO.
2740196	2742077	Those are completely different.
2742117	2744698	I'm talking about the characters you can create yourself.
2745779	2750461	They changed the faces, they changed the costumes.
2751341	2753362	It doesn't look nearly as good, I think.
2754402	2756904	Really, your character looked kind of cool to me, at least the one I saw.
2756924	2759165	I didn't think it was terrible.
2760705	2763466	After spending a lot of time with the character creator in the first game...
2765279	2768261	To me, I noticed how bad... It's really the faces.
2768341	2769961	The faces look really terrible.
2771562	2776445	Alright, I guess we'll close out today with a game I know Bobby had wanted to say something to on at some point.
2776485	2777765	This is also at Sega's booth.
2778226	2780587	But Sega was also showing off some iPads.
2781247	2785309	And one of the iPads had Super Monkey Ball 2 on the iPad.
2785349	2787930	So I know I think all of us got a chance to touch that game.
2788351	2789031	Shane, we'll start with you.
2789051	2790952	What did you think of Super Monkey Ball 2 on the iPad?
2792174	2794476	The theme for tonight is, I guess, I hated it.
2796497	2798298	It just controlled like crap.
2798799	2804883	Seriously, my phone, my iPhone plays Monkey Ball better than that iPad demo that they had.
2805423	2806244	So I'm not impressed.
2806464	2807925	Not making me want to buy an iPad.
2808005	2809967	Not making me want to download another Monkey Ball game.
2811468	2814169	Bobby, was the demo lost on you too?
2815610	2816171	It's shit.
2819113	2821713	You know, I got the controls pretty quick.
2821773	2823874	It's just that little device was calibrated weird.
2823934	2829535	But at the end of the day, I was like, yeah, Monkey Ball was better a long time ago.
2830435	2831655	I think this one's going to be a pass.
2832015	2833376	So there you go.
2834096	2837336	I guess we're going to go ahead and kind of wrap up for the night because I think we're ready to go to bed.
2837416	2840037	God, it's like already 1.30 and I still got to get this uploaded.
2840397	2846498	But thanks for staying up with us or whatever time of day it is where you are and listening to the little wrap up today.
2847058	2849181	We'll probably do another quick one tomorrow.
2849281	2853387	Probably won't be super long because I know Bobby's got to fly out to Atlanta and all that stuff.
2853407	2861558	But tomorrow we'll try to give you some final impressions, kind of like our most favorite thing we've seen at the show we'll get to tomorrow.
2862319	2864781	and I know we're going to be seeing Final Fantasy XIV tomorrow.
2864821	2870585	I'm really hoping to make it to Civ V. Actually, I'm supposed to have some time to sit down with Civilization V. It's actually exciting.
2870625	2872807	I know Bobby is going to finally get to see Rock Band 3 tomorrow.
2873207	2874428	So we'll have more stuff to talk about tomorrow.
2874448	2879412	Again, if you have questions, feedback, whatever, Twitter's the best way to get us on the show floor.
2880032	2882454	I actually did get some requests to see things today.
2883114	2884976	that I took pictures of.
2885016	2889880	There was NHL 11, Kirby's Epic Yarn I need to get tomorrow again.
2889900	2893963	I already put one picture up, but somebody wanted to know more about it, so I'll try to get that for impressions tomorrow.
2895324	2897566	I'm seeing the stuff on Twitter, guys, so keep sending those.
2897586	2899428	Twitter.com slash OLR.
2900168	2902130	Any closing thoughts for the night, Bobby?
2903571	2904992	Monkey ball on iPad is shit.
2906193	2906653	Sounds good.
2906974	2908515	Any closing thoughts for tonight, Shane?
2909887	2930941	I can't wait to live at the Final Fantasy XIV booth tomorrow and never leave it alright guys and I guess my final thought is it is time to get this uploaded and go to bed and cheesecake is delicious just for the record it's very good have a good night everybody we'll see you tomorrow with another Rob Roberts special here on the Orange Lounge Radio feed good night
