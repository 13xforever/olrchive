tonight July 25th 2010 worlds collide in two new fighting games announced at
comic-con independent games are set to come to home and rock band 3 gets a
release date hello my friends out there all over the internet and welcome to
another week of orange lounge radio the video game talk show where every gamer
has a voice my name is Rob Roberts I'll be with you over the next few hours with
my awesome co-host the one and only dark Sakura Jamie summers hi how are you
doing I'm amused I made that sound like it was all one name dark Sakura Jamie
summers but it's actually dark soccer is your online name and the Jamie summers
is your name name my stage name your stage name yes now why are you amused
tonight because I'm looking at that will buff out calm which is part of the fail
network or the aisle cheeseburger network and really all by the same people
I guess it makes sense those are all those guys have I have no idea but this
one then I'll link it in the chat room this one pictures of a car wearing
panties great I just want to point out what awesome radio you looking at
pictures makes all right no no no I'm I'm I I am here my messages are out mm-hmm
and but you're still on vitamin V I am on the V I'm hyped up on the bike it in
congratulations because my hand still has a hole in it there's a part that the
stitches didn't clear up all the way so I put pictures on Facebook to show my
mommy which is why I put them on Facebook is to show my mommy and I'm
still quite bandaged up although not to the extent I was last time and it hurts
as Rob it hurts us have you been able to play any video games at least um yes
which we will get to in my gaming week yes which we'll get to in just a minute
but I couldn't start the show without introducing the one and only tech master
Loki you could it just wouldn't be as good probably not but don't let your ego
get too big how you doing Loki I'm doing fine
what's new in Loki's world you guys finished the nursery right or you're
really close it's he's been inhaling a lot of paint fumes we have just very few
things left to do on it it's it's pretty much done it's just like the finishing
touches I guess we have to like shade the hills or put a little highlight on
them which site to mix some paint with this like blending medium stuff to make
it very transparent and then I have to paint one more hill and just like some
small stuff but it's basically done I would have taken more pictures but now
they said that you know I shouldn't take any more pictures until it's done
because it ruins the Wow effect all right well we'll be waiting to be wowed
it won't be as much of an epic mount all right let's also introduce we do have a
special guest here in studio we've been having a lot of extra people in studio
lately that's a good thing we like I'm having another person here to kind of
mix things up a little bit tonight is somebody you've heard over the past few
episodes say hello to salacious pop hello how are you I'm great can we even
hear you tonight I don't know if we're are we hearing test all right yeah we're
hearing you it's just kind of quiet I don't know don't be afraid don't be
afraid just treat that microphone like it's ice cream all right there you go so
what's new in your world how you doing not much yeah got some new games for my
birthday that I'll be talking about okay sounds good so we'll get to those in a
little bit and for those that may not know you have the unique distinction of
also being my boyfriend yes to which I'm sure a lot of the listeners are like oh
that poor guy but yeah so we went we went out last night actually we went to
see I'm Adam Lambert in concert yes we did speaking of of gays Wow yeah right
no here's no I mean is he any good cuz like I just remember like I hope he
wins cuz I don't like the other person and then he lost well here's the thing
it was my mom's idea okay my mom I'm not surprised my mom is the one that wanted
to go and she bought the tickets but then she pulled out and decided not to
go because her knees been bothering her lately and she was really scared about
walking up and down the stairs and everything and I kind of feel bad but
that's just the kind of person my mom is when she kind of makes her mind up there
ain't no change in it so we went instead with some other friends and you know I
don't know I I thought it was fine but it was weird that people were getting
into a fight I don't know what'd you think of the concert I'm not really into
American Idol at all and when Adam Lambert was getting hyped up I was like
okay I get it but I just wasn't really a fan like I'm not really that into his
music but he has a great voice and he put on a great show I like him more now
having seen him live than I did from just watching him on TV I want his hair
I'd say won me over his wig I'm sure I can't be real that his do can't be real
tell us tell tell the listeners real quick about the fight we will get to
video games I promise so we were up in the bleachers way in the back and about
three rows in front of us off to the left a fight well not a real fight but
um these ladies were dancing and standing up and having a good time
Lamas yeah glamos we're standing up dancing as one would at a rock concert
and this sort of drunk resentful husband who was probably dragged there by his
wife really took offense to the fact that they were standing and he decided
to call them out and get really belligerent cuz you need to know the
crowd was totally like the Real Housewives of Sacramento County I mean
Deena Lohan's all over wherever you look yeah I think on the Venn diagram of
shame there's definitely some overlap between Adam Lambert fans and like
twi-moms I think there are a lot of yeah yeah quite a bit so we got to watch
security come in and yes security had gave them a stern talking to put it so
there was a point where I was like am I serious because I've gone to a lot of
concerts before and I've never seen a fight so it's like am I really gonna see
people throw down at Adam Lambert like is this is this real life yeah it's
pretty pretty surreal well here's the other thing that you need to know about
the concert it was that a Indian casino which we have quite a few of those here
in California so it's you know obviously it's on Native American land and they
can have gambling and smoking and and all that good stuff so we actually went
into casino after the show and I'm kind of shocked at how much the worlds of
gaming and gambling are starting to fuse closer together you may not be aware of
this but a lot of gaming companies are also in the business of making like
gambling devices like Konami is one of the big ones actually they're probably
making more money right now on some of their gambling machines and one of the
machines that we saw in there was this gigantic wheel of fortune slot machine
and it's not like I mean there's been wheel of fortune slot machine for years
but there's a huge mungus wall-sized one yes yeah it looks like Derby owners Club
to me like remember I thought you were talking about like the five cent of the
nickel slots where they had like there's that too but now there's one with a
giant monitor and I guess the bonus round on that one you touch letters to
complete the puzzle on the giant board and it's multiple players doing it at
once it's weird and they have Vanna White like the real Vanna White doing
record like she's the bumpers between rounds like good luck everybody and it's
really her in HD it's very creepy but what's also creepy like isn't she like
80 years old and she still looks like she's like 30 like she's made a pact
with the devil clearly plastic surgery she's just using what you know what some
of that stuff different cosmetics from Umbrella corporation you know to keep
her cells nice and rejuvenated well you've seen that movie death becomes her
she made a porcelain Wow she's ceramic I did I did have to talk to one lady
though in the casino because she had her sign with her that said I'm 70 and I
love Adam because she reminded me of my mom because my mom's also just about 70
she's 69 anyway okay enough Adam I swear that is like the most Adam Lambert chat
you'll ever hear on orange lounge radio I apologize but we do talk about video
games we're gonna get into those in just a minute I had to go to our chat room
though we love the chatters chat that orange
lounge radio.com they're always here with us every Sunday night as we do tape
live at all games radio every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific and nine
o'clock Eastern www.allgames.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show and of
course big major massive super props to Bobby Black Wolf who just turned five
years old this week his show not him his show all right and it was actually
it was his five year of podcasting because I think he had like a life
thesis five thing like we used to have this is gaming related you've got to
stop with the pictures okay I'm gonna put it away put it away all right in the
chat room all right link it in the chat room so that way our live chatters can
see and unfortunately those listening on the podcast well it's just more
incentive to join us exactly that's why I do this all right to lure them well
let's talk about gaming weeks let's get less Adam more video games dark soccer
how was your gaming week mine was fairly epic Rob I did lots of gaming actually
such for being an invalid such as Dan and I took the last of our our spare
money now we're dirt broke waiting on our government checks to arrive he's on
unemployment I'm on disability okay we went to Dave and Buster's it's small oh
the new one here in Roseville it's tiny and loud oh my god loud and but we
played wait your mic is totally cut out you got to check the the connection is
wrong sorry guys live radio Jamie's mic is doing weird stuff go ahead no you're
still out I don't know what I pushed I pushed it in Rob I don't know what's
going on anyway so it played this tank game that Namco put out I don't remember
what's called it was pretty fun I played a lot of games to try to win a blender
because I really need a new blender apparently um and we did this typhoon
thing which is more like a ride and they had a they do like a minecart one no you
your mic you get can you guys switch okay I don't know what's going on with
my hey is this well I'm yeah it's much better all right go ahead anyway so we
played the tank game that Namco did we played this typhoon thing which is like
a bunch of different rides all in one and we did a pinball one which was kind
of throws you around a pinball game it was pretty cool because of course we had
to do pinball and then we I played more more token stuff and then I started
playing Ragnarok online again which because it's easier to do with my hand
being kind of messed up but I did play some Star Trek online and I'm at captain
eight now what exactly does captain eight mean it means that I've got two
more levels until I'm rear Admiral pretty much so those like levels in
other MMOs okay okay cuz like you start off because you know they're set up like
a military organization they go by rank and then you've got divisions in each
rank so so I'm getting up there actually I found out that while a lot of the
earlier missions are lame the upper captain level and Admiral level missions
are really freaking fun so I've been having a good time it's especially funny
watching although I have I've had such a hard time playing when I've just taken
my Vicodin because then I can't I totally focus on one thing when I'm on
Vicodin it's like I have instead of a DD I have like hyper focus disorder or
something and get fixated on one major thing at a time so it's really kind of
hard to multitask hence me looking at all these pictures during the show and
not being able to look away from them I don't know what you're talking about
dork anyway and I did other games what did I do oh yeah I started this what's
that professor top hat game professor Layton no not professor Layton it's like
a combination of platformer and puzzle game and it's this guy I'm gonna hold on
a second is that the new one on Steam no no no no it's a gameplay game and you'd
like have to find the golden suit is this really bizarre little game that
it's it's also it's awfully cutesy and I was surprised that Dan suggested it to
me to play but it's really it's really fun I've been playing a little bit of
that and some trying to go back and play Oh end on except I'm right-handed my
stitches are on my right hand so well my incision is on my right hand so I can't
play a wind on very well especially again when I'm on Vicodin so I gotta
tell you guys before the show I said something and Jamie flipped me off and
it actually put her in pain because she's like I haven't flipped anyone off
since I had my surgery Rob's the first person I flipped off and because the
whole thing is that my flexibility is coming back in my hand and I can make a
sword of fist and I can sort of extend it except I can't apparently make a fist
and extend a finger at the same time cuz then it hurts and maybe you want to cry
and I blame Rob because Rob evoked the finger well you wouldn't bet go bake me
a pie that's what I asked bake your own damn pie all right I'm a guacamole though
you have some guacamole I'm I had but I'm full of chips oh what else I don't
remember no I'd be taking effect everybody no I played I played mahjong
before class my netbook and I found that my SNES my next emulator works very well
for Linux on my netbook so I can play Super Nintendo games before class you
should check out the Castlevania puzzle game that just came out on iPhone
because although it looked really weird from the screenshots I've been hearing a
lot of good things about it I just picked it up actually because I had
$40 worth of iTunes credit for my birthday from various gift cards so I
picked it up was like four or five bucks I don't remember and it just kind of
made me think of you because I know you're big Castlevania fangirl you like
puzzle games too I was wanting to play it but I I almost downloaded the Silent
Hill game and no no the Silent Hill games junk it's on my phone if you wanna
play it it's not that great it's like it's like a first-person thing it's it
does it's not like the actual Silent Hill games at all but um and then we've
also been redoing the vault Dan and I and we've decided well I decided this
and he better go along with it or else that we're gonna play play through Sonic
Adventure I like how you have like the dual TVs all set up in there you know
they were huh they were Xbox Oh monitors from kiosk from certain stores kiosks
okay well no and Dan was just told that he could take everything so we've got
like broken Xboxes and broken Wiis and semi working Wiis and a bunch of cables
and those monitors and crap so he's putting them to proper use in the vault
and I'll put up those pictures of the vault in progress all right so in fact
I'll go do that right now I'm gonna find the name of that game because it's gonna
bother the crap out of me until I figure it out all right so when Jamie runs in
here and yells something completely random that's the aim all right Loki how
is your gaming week now you have to stop looking at pictures what are those SD
cards you SD card compact flash cards and yes I am shopping for compact flash
cards for something I'm working on because I can't go without having six
projects at one time although I did cancel one project because I don't
really give a crap about making it you know cardboard arcade cabinet anymore
what project oh the project under 100 hundred dollars name that sounded cool
the other people have already done that they have like one that's actually a
maim system that's under $100 and basically this would be the same thing
just you know the cabinet would you know be kind of free because it'd be made out
of cardboard but I just don't care and I may do it later but you know I know
whatever so I have spare parts at home um no but what I was working on was
actually can't hear you I want to interject what were you interjecting is
Henry hats worth in the puzzling adventure okay I could told you that so
yeah what I'm working on right now my friend gave me one of these old I don't
even know what they are they're like remember those tiger electronics games
and stuff not necessarily like game and watch but something similar that and
it's a Frogger game it's set up inside of what looks like a bar top arcade
cabinet except it's just plastic and it's really tiny and I was looking at
him like cuz then you know the first thing that comes to my mind for anything
it's like I wonder if I could put an arcade game inside this thing and so
I've kind of challenged myself to do that for no apparent reason what I've
seen that before like the little bit like all the it's like it's kind of like
an LED game but it's in color you know it's Frogger I think I've seen one of
those before aren't they like all red or all orange or something I know they're
well not all of them I've seen ones that are multiple colors they have just like
an overlay on them that gives them the colors but yeah it's basically that so
what I would be doing is I'd be ripping out the guts of the inside or whatever
this thing is I'd actually probably be using the joy stick that's on there not
really even replacing any of the buttons but just wiring them up to some sort of
like I pack type thing probably a mini pack and then running that through which
I just bought because I bid snipe someone and won an auction for a nano
ITX PC which they're really small but it's actually a little big for what I
need it to be put in so I gotta put the board in an angle and hopefully that
fits I'm not sure so that'll be fun otherwise I'll use it for something else
but I have a three and a half inch monitor that came from I think it's
supposed to use for like backup cameras and cars I got dirt cheap that I'm gonna
hook it up through because it just takes a standard video in and I'm gonna hook
that up to the PC through that and maybe possibly use that as an actual tiny
tiny tiny main cabinet that'd be kind of funny and put on my desk at work I shall
call him mini maim mini maim no but actual games I play this week just the
same typical stuff I've been playing you know before Grand Theft Auto lots of lost
in the dammed because that's what my co-workers want to play now because they
think they lose less on that which I've been proving them wrong and although we
did play a little bit of Battle of the Gay Tony because there was a few days
where it's just myself and my other co-worker and there's just no one
online at all playing you know Battle of the Gay Tony not I mean there's more
people playing that than lost and dammed but there's really no one playing lost
and dammed right now which you know I think this is about the right time to
finally get those mods working which I'm hopefully going to start working on some
more once I get done painting the baby's room which I'm very close right that
baby's gonna get here and all your projects just got canceled no they
haven't that's what you think you are wrong sir no I'm just saying project
baby is gonna take a lot of time it's not gonna take that much time babies
just thank you differ they sleep and they feed them any poke at them that's
not gonna last yeah let's what we'll be saving this little clip and playing it
for Loki a year after that kids born we'll see what he thinks hey I I'm well
aware of what babies do and yeah they they wake you up in the middle night and
you're tired okay I get that that does not stop me from say spending a few
minutes you know here and there to build crap I don't know I need gamer daddies
to email the show to give Loki some advice I just I just want to hear from
some gamer daddies that's all all right I'm just saying like I don't need
there's two of us we don't need to juggle the baby I mean I will be taking
care of the baby but if you juggle the baby CPS might get called they might
especially since they can't juggle anything so that's not good now I'm not
worried about that stuff I don't think it's really gonna change anything I have
done a number of people who said that all right we'll stop taking on Loki go
ahead come on I'm just saying that I don't think it will affect anything
that's fine I don't need 80,000 projects going on at one time but I will find
excuses to do that okay so anyways besides all that stuff and of course
more crackdown too I'm not really enjoying this game as much as the first
one probably because this game is very similar to the first one which you know
wouldn't be so bad but it's just they really kind of took away all the open
world part of the game because you know the open world stuff is still there but
my god is that my guy who's the voiceover guy is such a nagging bitch
it's like you should go to this rooftop race fuck that I will do the rooftop
race when I feel like it no you should do it now I will do it later do it now
are you trying to piss me off oh god I hated that stop killing them you know
you know like I'll like jump down and you know the other not agents but like
you know the peacekeepers will be there and they'll get injured or like I'll
blow up a car and some shrapnel will hit them though stop injuring the
peacekeepers they're hard at work or like don't injure the civilians you know
they need to like us my favorite that peacekeeper had a wife and family do you
want to explain it to them and it's dumb and even when you do piss them off to
come at they send a hit squad after you you just go up on the rooftops and they
shoot at the building because they can't figure out how to hit you and and then
that goes away and they're all hope you learned your lesson I'm like nope
didn't learn my lesson I'm gonna do it again we yeah it's alright it's just
maybe the announcers the last boss it's not the last boss and what's retarded is
from what I hear the game has the same fucking twist in it as the first one and
it's completely obvious from the beginning because obviously if you play
the first game you understand what the twist is and right from the get-go they
kind of give you the big hint hey hey it's probably the same twist again not
that I even care it's just that was just a dumb excuse what about the twist in
the original Metal Gear game that the big boss that was talking to you on the
you know frequency thingy and he'd like was the announcer ended up being the
last boss I think so yeah but I don't think this guy's the last boss he's just
it's just that the peacekeepers are evil oh my god you know someone that's helping
you know as evil that twist has been done like 80,000 times and you know I
know it's a spoiler but hey the original crackdown game has been out for a few
years now so too bad whatever it just doesn't it doesn't matter than me but
it's still fun you know I like playing it it's just it's very you know the
missions that you go on are very linear and granted that the first game the
missions weren't that different but they did have some bosses that you fought I
mean granted they were very simply just have to run up to them and roundhouse
kick them a few times and they're dead but you know at least they had bosses I
don't know they they could ramp up the difficulty and stuff they could all
right well I guess that's it for Loki's gaming week how about Alan you want to
talk about your gaming week absolutely how's my mic doing I think you're okay
well kind of a just actually you and Jamie should probably switch back again
is I think I fixed hers we'll see I don't know bear with us guys live radio
let me just okay well we can hear you now okay all right hi okay so my
birthday was a couple weeks ago and I picked up or rather I got Bayonetta so
I'm finally playing that I know that came out in January a lot of fun been
wanting to play it for a while I'm on the third stage so it's pretty much you
know Devil May Cry but with a sexy bitch killing everybody
puzzle quest 2 and I played puzzle quest 1 on the DS I probably have about 130
hours on my save game so I've been playing the hell out of the second one
Wow 130 hours that's a long game yeah I well I pretty much grinded everything to
level 99 that was grindable it was very yeah so puzzle quest 2 Wow of course our
guild tried to do a trial of the Crusader 10 man it's the hardest rate
we've tried and Wow we got about halfway through it before we gave up good
progress there and played some left for dead and played some alien swarm what
you think alien swarm it's good it's the new four player co-op game that valve
put out it is under the valve name it's free so whenever something is not
horrible and free it's usually worthy of a little bit of hype the gameplay is
basically gauntlet for player top-down massive enemies coming at you and it's
so it's gauntlet with crossed with the movie aliens pretty much and there's the
medic the tech the sergeant and the special ops and you play online with
friends and each each person has a special role and it's a lot of fun I
downloaded it oh so we'll have to play you should play with us free yeah you
can't argue with free it's two gigs so yeah anything else you gave me a week
you want to share with us I think that's all I've played really I played left for
dead I'm sure you'll talk about a little bit with you you had never played it
before well I had tried it like once a couple years ago but yeah yeah I did
load up the team team fortress 2 tutorial so I know that Jamie wanted to
play some of that so all right well my gaming week Alan hit on a lot of the
same stuff I was playing a lot of these games we were playing together as I was
in that Wow raid and all that fun stuff I've been doing more PvP in Wow though
I'm one of my characters I'm finally my level 76 bank all warrior I'm finally
bringing back to be like a PvP character and I've been having a lot of fun with
her she's cool anyway a alien swarm free on steam right now there's really no
reason not to get this game it's worth a look it's the time I mean it's not like
oh my god like you know like portal awesome or something but it's the type
of game you would pay like 10 to 15 dollars for on Xbox Live Arcade it feels
a lot like an Xbox Live Arcade game to me but it's not it's a PC game and it's
very much I think gauntlet kind of mixed with aliens is good with a little team
fortress 2 thrown in there because a lot of the classes kind of seem to come over
from that and yeah it's fun and a lot of fun on the multiplayer so check
that out I mean there's really no reason not to check out alien swarm unless
you're like super anti steam is about the only reason I could think of or your
PC really really really blows which might be another reason one thing that I
really like about valve is that they will often they're very involved in the
mod community for half-life and all that stuff and if you read the info on alien
swarm you will read that the developers for it are people from the mod community
that valve hired because they like their work so valve actually hires out of you
know the the fan the fan service projects that's cool and that's how
alien swarm was made is they they hired out of the mod developers all right now
some of our chat chatters a chat that orange on twitter.com are joking about
free and Yaris amazed that suma says can't argue with free points to Yaris
yeah but Yaris was different like I can't explain it like I Yaris really
really was I think the commercial tie-in had a lot to do with that like when you
pay to have a game made that's basically a giant commercial I think you're kind
of set up for disaster a little bit alien swarm is no commercial nothing
it's just I honestly I think it's again to try and get steam on more people's
computers that's that's really what it boils down to because you know since you
launched steam to play the game you're gonna get tempted into these ads where
it's you know four dollar sale on you know old game I really want to buy that's
that's what it is the same reason why they gave away portal for free why they
have these disgustingly low sales is to get steam out there more because the
more steam is out there the less other companies will you know that try to take
them on will have the chance um other games I played I also played a little
bit of team fortress 2 I play more than the tutorial I actually was playing some
offline games I'm not ready to fight the people online yet because I'm still
scared because I'm not very good at it but I found that I was I was doing okay
it's a medic the white mage which I think somebody had suggested in an email
last week and it was funny because I said yeah I'll probably do the medic and
it's kind of a different role because instead of just running out there like
all quake style just running on the front die it's more you know you hang
back with your team and actually heal people and you can over heal I kind of
liked what they did with it it's it's fun so I'm talking about all these games
that are years old because I played Left 4 Dead as well finally got around to
playing a little more that Alan and I played a little bit together and that
was cool just I don't know I think a lot of you guys have already played it so
for me to sit here and describe it after so long it's probably a little
ridiculous but I guess if you haven't just kind of imagine a first-person shoe
that it takes a little bit of teamwork I mean obviously Left 4 Dead is all
about teamwork and it's about the four people you know that are playing
although you know you can have everybody else be a computer player but it is a
little more fun to play at least with people you know I mean you can go online
and play with strangers but it's fun when you play with people you know
because then you can kind of you know joke and talk to each other and you know
Alan and I kind of you know can communicate really well and say you know
he can explain to me you know why we don't run up and say hello to the girl
that's crying right shine a light on her wait bad idea no so yeah it's good it's
not like Left 4 Dead that was fun who's your favorite character in Left 4
Dead somebody asked me down on Twitter this week and I'm like well I've like
played it once do you have a favorite character on Left 4 Dead in the first
one probably the biker I totally blanking on his name but the the guy at
the handlebar mustache and yeah he's funny and the second one probably the
redneck because he's so stupid all right very cool as far as other games I played
this week Puzzle Quest 2 gosh it's almost the same games as Alan played
this week I don't know if there's like anything unique I played that he didn't
play kind of sound game room I don't think you really play game room I play a
little bit of that another one of my old favorite Activision classics excuse me
frostbite is scheduled for release this week that was kind of a frostbite is
like kind of like a ghetto Frogger really really ghetto Frogger so I'll be
checking that out because I have fond childhood memories of that one um all
right that's gonna do it for our gaming week so we're gonna get into the news
and everything that's going on in the gaming world but first we're gonna do
some housekeeping real quick I want to bring you guys up to speed on the big
battle it's kind of going on all summer long at the big battle net I think it's
also available big battle dot all games calm but the big battle dot networks
just fine thank you guys so much olr has really made a charge the past few days
we are finally starting to dent the lead a little bit that dead pixel live has we
have like 51 points we're a pretty solid second place right now and a lot of that
has to do with you guys that played super stardust HD this week and again
if you haven't heard of the big battle listeners of the shows not necessarily
the hosts although I try to participate on at least games I own listeners of the
shows play their favorite games against listeners of other shows and it's kind
of like a big kind of tournament type of thing high scores and leaderboards and
all that I think they're doing one tonight I don't know if maybe it was
rescheduled they're doing battlefield bad company was either tonight earlier
today sadly that's a game I'll have so I can really follow that one but I tried
to get people through the Twitter to sign up but I know that super stardust
HD just came to an end and we took first place thanks to our listeners Zoui came
in first place with a obscene score of 11 million he was going back and forth
with the second place listener from Fantastic Forum on there Riptide did
very well there to AZHP made a showing and then we also made a showing on the
Forza motorsport 3 competition one of our listeners I think just one charted
over there Burr charted for us over there so he came in sixth place but
that's certainly better than nothing so a very good job by Burr over there so we
really appreciate that some things that are coming up in the near future super
Street Fighter 4 trials HD and shatter have both been announced as well so
super Street Fighter 4 I'm very excited about that one so we'll be checking
those out a lot of you guys have been requesting other types of games PC games

like a team fortress 2 battle but I'll try to look into it and see if we can
get maybe Derek schedule so like that would be cool check that out big battle
dotnet the big battle dotnet dark Tetsuya one of our staffers that orange
on twitter.com he does a lot of good work for the site and keeps it up with
fresh content he decided thanks to their classic game of the week last week the
journey being the classic in the week last week and it came up that you know
he wants to do a game with the olr hosts or the olr people in journey or I should
say not in the actual journey game in a journey like game so he actually has
started it he's chronicling it in a little web series called project journey
and there's actually little screenshots of me and like a breakout kind of game I
don't know it's it's I'm curious to see how this turns out yet scared all at
once I'm so excited I'm so excited I'm so scared alright alright that's gonna
do it for housekeeping tonight facebook.com slash orange launch radio
twitter.com slash olr please follow us spread the love of orange launch radio
because we don't have advertising dollars let's get in some actual bonafide
gaming news tonight there's a lot thanks to comic-con but I think Loki starting
us off with something not comic-con related right yes we'll talk a little
bit about connect and some of the stuff that was kind of rumored that we kind of
you know figured was true but is true so we'll see anyways say announced that one
of the things that was rumored that there's gonna be a new Xbox 360 arcade
system coming out this fall there is gonna be a new one now it's bundled with
a 4 gigabyte internal memory unit kind of like how they were doing with the old
arcade systems and so that's kind of neat and then of course you know you can
put your own hard drive in there just like you can with the new you know s
systems or whatever you want to call them or use the USB because I think a
lot of people are now using USB sticks you can also use USB sticks as well on
there because there's plenty USB ports on there now and that's kind of cool and
yes and then also of course they're gonna be doing a new oh and I'm sorry
that will be bundled with connect that $300 one and of course there's also
gonna be a new just plain arcade system for $200 that's gonna be coming out in
August as well so that's kind of neat that they're gonna be doing that I mean
alternatives are wonderful connect is gonna be priced at $150 as if all those
retail listings you know we're Microsoft's own website taking pre
orders didn't give it away yeah yeah it's such an interesting you know price
there didn't didn't call that it does come with a free game which I may have
hinted at before the free game is connected ventures kind of like they're
a little we play type game so that'll be bundled within of course for 150 bucks
and should be coming out well November 4th is that the is connected ventures
the one with like the river rafting yes the Pong type game yes Jimmy Fallon that
well the Pong type game I think that's in connect sports ok but this had like
the like obstacle course thing that they had the river rafting stuff like that so
that'd be kind of neat but you know hopefully makes it and we cost average
it out makes it a little bit more beneficial I guess so if but if I want
this and dance central day one that's gonna cost me what 200 bucks right
yes connect games are gonna be $10 cheaper yes I guess only 50 bucks okay
so it's gonna be 150 plus 50 plus tax so it's gonna cost me about 220 bucks to
get connect to get connected dance central day one yes that's a bit of an
investment I don't know do you think um do you think it's a bad idea to price at
150 I mean of course we all want it cheaper duh but you know I mean the
reality is when you get that third digit in there I mean they cross that kind of
sweet spot as a lot of people were saying of $99 getting into that third
digits that can ultimately hurt the sales but no game or not I think it may
hurt the sales a little bit because it is pretty expensive but I mean they're
trying to make it a little better because they're thrown in the game but
when you look at it though with the new console and since it's being bundled
with the new console then that really brings down the cost of the camera and
I guess the software to $100 so I mean are they losing money on the console or
they just you know adding some sort of profit margin in there for the actual
you know accessory I can tell you right now obviously it may be $150 retail
obviously that's not what they're selling them for you know we probably
work in about a 20% margin in there because that's usually I think what
accessories go for is they have a 20% margin built-in so if you figure that I
mean they have to I guess leave room for the retailers to make some money let me
do a quick poll in our chat room quick poll will you buy connect and it's buy
in game connected ventures this year for a hundred and fifty dollars that's why
I want to know a quick poll in our chat room chat orange laundry calm if you
want to answer a quick poll I want to see some yeses and nos and maybe some
brief reasons why let's go around the room who plans to buy connect and who
says it's a waste of your time dark soccer I like lemonade the hell does
that mean but you you collect peripherals so are you gonna buy it on
that principle or you like no this is one I don't need it depends on what the
money's like I mean that's not really always the big thing for us we'll
eventually have it I'm sure we eventually get everything so it's kind
like your economic situation is gonna be okay well that's fair 150 right now is
kind of steep but I've paid more for less okay
Alan something interests you no interest at all none none what if they made it
$50 would you buy it yeah I consider it then I'm kind of the same boat as Jamie
where it's like not to be Debbie Downer but okay you know well no I bet that's
a blah blah economy blah blah nine point five percent unemployment rate like I
can't get that right now you guys yeah there's a lot of listeners in the same
boat as you guys so I think it's a very realistic answer to say that you know
because of economic situations $150 too damn much now is not the time to be
asking me to buy this stuff and a lot of people actually say that's why you
didn't see new systems this year and you're seeing instead upgrades to
existing systems because imagine if it wasn't just $150 for connect but you
know $400 for Xbox 720 with a motion feature built in for me day one I'm a
little bit on the fence right now like I kind of want to do it just because I
really want Dance Central and the dance the dance masters or whatever it is
Konami is putting out I kind of want to get both of those day one Loki I got a
little so it was a couple things yes I will probably pick it up on day one but
I don't know and I don't know why I should because really I've been burned
by every single camera peripheral that's been put out there ever since the I toy
I mean the very beginning so fine I will bite for a fourth time but this will be
the last damn time there's something interesting when you mentioned dance
masters or whatever the Konami game guess what I saw listing for the other
day that I guess like really I'm surprised that's still coming out is
this a secret no I don't know if it's a secret I think it may even be a
mislisting because I haven't looked at the actual Konami their release list yet
but um dance dance revolution is back on the list of games coming out which I
thought was interesting that wouldn't surprise me is that the Xbox and ps3
one yes I wouldn't surprise me they try to get out by the holiday but it now is
really a bad time because you know especially on 360 where it's all about
you know now you can dance without the mat it's kind of seems like really bad
timing mm-hmm they really should have had that out earlier this year before
e3 but I forgot to mention this during my gaming week technically not a game I'm
playing but holy shit is it awesome I one of my release lists I saw I mean
granted it hasn't been announced yet but I don't give a crap because it's so
sweet earth defense force 2017 insect Armageddon yes they are making a sequel
to the greatest one of the greatest games on the Xbox 360 in my opinion
completely underrated but oh I cannot wait day one purchase for me you know
and I saw that on your Twitter I was excited for you let's go back to the
results of our quick poll at chat orange on twitter.com will you buy connect and
it's buy in game connected ventures this year for $150 here's the results from
our listeners nope no yes no yes only if a 360 is in that bundle yes because of
fucking dance masters maybe I think that would be a good deal oh that's out with
the 360 included 80% chance on not this year and then I don't have a job too so
I don't even think about it those are the results see I told you guys here's
the thing with the connect to is I like how simple it is basically I buy the
system and I'm done I don't have to go oh okay now I gotta go buy all these
extra accessories you know to get to work and I know that they've had there's
a bunch of those price comparison charts and like feature charts that one was
released by Microsoft was released by Sony which were hilarious and not the
sound Microsoft centric or anything release their chart kind of seemed a
little bit more fair with the comparison and what you have to buy you know to
equal out a two-player setup and the cost of that versus you know Sony's
saying that oh well our systems in 1080p with blu-ray as opposed to just 1080p
or your substandard 1080p because it does not have blu-ray technology our
system has buttons on it that is an excellent follow-up question for our
Chiron let me ask this quick poll question real quick are you buying
PlayStation move this year that's what I want to know how much is PlayStation
move again it's it's a PlayStation move is if you buy the bundle it's gonna be
$100 and it gets you one of the the move controllers the camera and a game but
that does not give you in case you know granted you're gonna say oh well not all
the games require you know the navigation controller yes that's also
like saying not all the Wii games require the nunchuck but most of them do
so you're gonna probably want it so you're going to buy another a nunchuck
and to buy another move controller if you want two players and another you
know navigation controller nunchuck whatever you want to call it and you
know those are expensive like 30 bucks I think for the navigation controller and
I want to say like 70 for the actual controller around there I could be
wrong on the prices but quickly let me run around the room and see who might
buy PlayStation move here Dark Sakura PlayStation move this year um really
don't know okay same same kind of answer that's fine
Alan I don't have a Wii yet and I think that sort of answers the same question
no not at all I'm I'll tell I'm gonna say it pretty strongly here I have no
interest in PlayStation move right now there's not a single game that's on it
that I'm really interested in you could be you could pay charge me $50 for the
whole thing the bundle of the controller everything I still wouldn't buy it it's
not to say I'm hateful for everything Sony this year because I really want
little big planet 2 and there's some other things that don't involve the move
that are very interesting pretty much every game that does interest me that
has move support I'm I'll be perfectly content with without move that's my kind
of issue whereas with Kinect what are the games that interest me most over
there things that you just can't do on a controller period and that you know to
for all practical purposes those dance games really haven't been done before in
this style Loki PlayStation move absolutely not it looks like crap and I
can't believe that they made game I mean just the the whole lineup looks like
junk I mean in the fact that the controller is just a total grab at the
Wii stuff I mean it's basically a Wii with HD graphics and good power to them
I guess for trying to come up with a system the other works for them but I
don't play my Wii right now and why am I gonna spend more money for Wii type
games and granted I know that the Kinect will have Wii type games because that's
what they're gonna put out at launch because that's what they do they try to
find something gimmicky but you can't do stuff like dance central or whatever on
the Wii you can't do it with the controller setup that you have either
you're gonna get things that the closest to that you can get is like a just dance
type game and I really don't I'm not interested in something like that
dar Tetsuya in our chat room says care to make a wager if they'll sell 1
million units of move I'm sure they will at some point because it's gonna be like
a new system for them well here's it here's what's interesting you ready to
see the results of our quick poll in our chat room chat that orange house radio
calm are you buying PlayStation move this year you ready for this thanks to
the listeners to chat that orange honestly calm here we go nope I don't
think so nope no no I don't even have ps3 as of now
hells no hell no no thanks I already have a we only if someone gave me a ps3
I don't have a ps3 I really have no need for a ps3 nor do I want one no and brb
not a single person in our chat room and please speak up if I missed you said
that they're buying it we at least had about two or three saying they were
getting connect but not a single person saying they're getting move that could
be very interesting not that I want to make bets cuz I don't want to make bets
and we're not gonna do this crap I'm just I think move is gonna fail but
they're they're gonna be able to sweep it under the rug very easily whereas
connect is way riskier and I don't know if that's gonna do well or not like yeah
I want one but I kind of have a bad feeling that dance central may be the
only game I ever get here's the problem too with the connect is they haven't
really shown off any of the hardcore games yet for it it's all been like the
casual stuff they I mean granted with the move they showed hey look we can use
it in SOCOM 4 and look we can use it in you know kill zone 2 if you want but
they ever or kill zone 3 but they haven't really shown off anything like
hey look Halo Reach is gonna you know support the move or like you know Gears
of War 3 or something like that or not the move they connect so I don't know it
it'll be interesting to see what happens but I I do I don't think it's gonna be
like oh my god everybody's gonna run out and get these consoles it's just the
same reason why even with the Wii and stuff you know the Wii sells well
because it's cheap and I guarantee if this stuff starts doing well like the
move in the Kinect that that console will drop in price again to the
sweet-spot of $99 or even like $120 and it won't matter anymore because people
will be snatching that shit up like crazy and seriously when you think about
it if that's the kind of gameplay you're into why the fuck should you spend $400
on a HD console so the graphics are slightly better remember folks it
doesn't matter if the you know graphics are better as long as the game is fun I
mean if anything look at some of the stuff that like Capcom has done with
like the 8-bit retro games those games are fun because they're fun not because
they look pretty and that's the whole point is the games need to be fun a need
the focus less on how pretty the games are that will only get you so far it's
the fun that keeps people around all right well before I get into the next
story I'm sure there's gonna be some even though our chat results came up
that nobody was interested in move I'm sure there's some folks listening the
podcast because we do reach a pretty big audience of the podcast comparatively
there's probably somebody out there that's probably sitting there right now
going man these guys just hating on Sony man man man no I'm open to and I really
actually want to hear from the people that are gonna buy PlayStation move why
are you buying PlayStation move and I'm not asking that in a accusatory I'm just
kind of I want to know like what is it that interests you about PlayStation move
I told you I'm interested in Dance Central that's kind of why I want to get
connect what is it on move that interests you for this holiday season
and what's motivating you to go out to get a move I'd love to hear from the
listeners mailbag orange on twitter.com I was gonna real quickly show talk about
just Microsoft's thing when they put out the cost of the different systems and
stuff like that oh did you call this that this is gonna come out a Microsoft
will put out a chart that says it like I remember you I don't remember you did
you did I know you did but this is assuming that you already own the these
consoles or whatever here's what it will cost you to equal up to what I guess
them the place not the PlayStation the Kinect can give you so of course of
connect only supports two people at least for full body capture whatever so
for a hundred fifty dollars you get the connects system now to equal that on the
PlayStation side you're in need the hundred-dollar starter kit which gets
you the camera and the controller you're in need an additional controller which
is another $50 and into navigational controllers which are $30 each total
cost $210 now if you compare that with the we all you're gonna really need is
another remote which is $40 they're saying that we balance board and this is
mainly just so that you can play every single game that's available on the week
is with you know the connect you're gonna need you know just that camera to
play every single game that's gonna be available for connect and then with the
you know the movie or any of those navigation controllers to play every
single game on there and then an additional nunchuck so they'll cost $160
it's only $10 more than the hundred fifty dollars that's how they're saying
that they're a better bargain I guess they're doing some fuzzy math it's some
funny because they're also saying if you already have these systems you know it's
not including the price price of the systems and then I think it's a little
bit shady to to throw in the hundred-dollar balance board seeing
saying you need it I get what they're where they're going with it but
Microsoft's doing some fuzzy math but that's that's what that's the sales
people get paid to do I get you but even like with like the PlayStation chart
Sony chart you know what they're talking about the different features and stuff
it's just some of the comparisons are ridiculous like for example they have
like six different bullet points are that are the camera that you know
obviously the the we does not have a camera so all those are no but they're
like saying camera yes augmentative reality yes it's basically if you
actually look and read all the stuff it's all basically the same as the
connect except for you know oh there's no buttons darn you know well what if
you don't need buttons on there I know that they were stressing that buttons
are really important just like that they were stressing that but or force
feedback was an important back when you know they didn't have the licensing for
force feedback in the PlayStation 3 controller you know what they should do
is they should put out a chart that's a little more honest with the price but
they should just say here's what the Xbox will do that the Wii won't do you
know the Xbox is in HD the Xbox has access to indie games the Xbox has this
library of download content the X-Plays DVDs and don't yes basically you know
just be honest yeah it's a little more money but this is what you're getting
for all of it you know you it plays DVDs you can do live interactive things like
one versus a hundred oh wait no you can't not anymore but you can do
Netflix party well I just wondering though the problem I think that they're
gonna have with these two new motion systems is that it may be too late you
know what I mean it's like the Wii is so inexpensive now and it's only gonna get
cheaper you know putting out these additional systems that's basically like
saying oh you know you need to buy no system and fuck for $150 why don't you
just go buy a Wii I mean cuz you can pretty much do that with that kind of
cost so why even bother buying the Kinect when they're just basically saying
four hundred dollars I just buy a Wii let me leave leave this story on this
comment from our chat room chat dot orange on twitter.com because I think
it's interesting frisbee says in response to something Jamie said a
minute ago Microsoft does what Nintend should perhaps alright let's move on to
our next story and this has to do with stuff going on in the real world that
will definitely impact gaming I'm sure you guys have heard about this bill
that's gonna go before the Supreme Court and it's a California bill that is
basically banning the sale of violent video games to kid to get kid justice
one kid actually know the kids and you know it's going to be going before the
Supreme Court and because it was overturned by a lower court you know
some time ago after it was signed into law well long story short 11 states have
now joined in basically saying they support this bill so this is now no
longer just a California issue but Connecticut Florida Hawaii Illinois
Louisiana Maryland Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Texas and Virginia are now
all on this too not to say that if the Supreme Court you know reverses the
other decision putting the law into effect not to say that all these states
will suddenly also have the law but that should tell you where California goes at
least these 11 states are lined up to follow so if you want to have your voice
heard you might want to call your congressperson and don't be afraid to do
so because that's what they're there for that's what they're paid to do it's also
the ECA you can go through the ECA mm-hmm although you know the ECA is a
union you can kind of join to support and help fight it but there is nothing
quite like contacting your representative directly do you want to
say something on this no all right so yeah I definitely would encourage folks
to contact people otherwise this is you know and again just to kind of state
like you know where the issue is with this is that you know whereas yes kids
should not be playing violent video games isn't that really up to the
parents to be doing and not really the video game stores and why are video
games being held to a different standard than you know movies is it against the
law to sell an r-rated movie to a kid like you don't do it like you're not
supposed to do it but is it against the law because it's going to be against the
law to do video games pretty soon if this happens the last few times I've
gone to Best Buy and bought an M rated game from there I've been carded and I
know I pretty sure I look over 18 I am over 18 it's no real inconvenience to me
but I like I appreciate that they do that and if stores just all adopted that
policy I don't really understand why this law is necessary and again it
should be you know if parents were doing their due diligence on what their kids
were playing and buying or what they bought for their kids it's just it seems
really unnecessary J rod in our chat says I don't get why this is an issue
children need a parent to get into an r-rated movie or buy a parental advisory
music album but is that against the law
it's just that same double standard again I actually I somewhat agree with
you J rod it's just that you know I think video games are being held to a
different standard and that's not very fair because it's just going into that
whole stereotype that video games somehow make you a more violent person I
just kind of don't like what they're trying to say I don't like what you're
trying to say to me all right let's move on with another story dark soccer well
this is happier news this actually makes well me in particular very happy we have
a couple of games coming out from both Capcom and Namco Bandai Street Fighter
cross Tekken and Tekken cross Street Fighter what's the difference huh well
Capcom's in charge of the former and that one's gonna be all done in that
sort of Street Fighter 4 style that 2.5 D look and of the the Tekken characters
will be re-image to fit that same style and a slow screen capture from it with
Kazuya and Ryu and it looked really really good the gameplay looks exactly
like Street Fighter 4 that will make me intensely happy they have the video of
it and of course it's tag team so it's gonna be sweet and that one will have
versus training and tag team and it's gonna be a full-on Capcom style now the
latter is going to be more of the Tekken style play that has a 3d arenas I don't
know if they're gonna be taking the the sort of a Street Fighter EX move list
and importing it into Tekken or what or if it's gonna be trying to actually
translate the styles of each character into a move list that would fit the way
Tekken plays because there's not really any real major projectile moves like
that in Tekken except for a couple of interesting moves like and there's the
unblockable moves to like Jen's whole electric block thing I think in the
later Tekken's the final boss would have a fireball to make them even more
cheesier that's right but normally yeah they're regular characters down from
what I remember now Tekken was always my big thing especially when Tekken 3 came
out I was working in a Namco arcade at the time so of course we had it before
everybody else did and I was like ooh I know who that character is coming out
you know cuz I was keeping a keeping up with the Japanese character releases at
the time we got ours in a different order than they did in Japan hmm yeah
Tekken 3 was a huge deal here because it was a launch title with the ps2 yeah so
if you're in line at midnight September whatever 2000 for the ps2 you are
picking up Tekken 3 SSX big as Tekken Tag Tournament actually yeah Tekken 3 was
on the ps1 I'm pretty sure it was with the ps1 in fact they have like a suit
up version on the ps2 I think that's what they had yeah but Tekken Tag
Tournament was the big thing and actually they fixed a lot of the problems
that the Japanese Tekken Tag Tournament had cuz it had this weird thing where
the background would almost detach from the foreground and it would really give
me a headache after a while playing it but um I've got I imported Tekken 3 when
it came out in Japan and actually they they censored the endings between that
one in the u.s. one it's pretty funny I kind of wish if Capcom and Namco we're
gonna get into bed together again I'll get to that a moment in a moment I kind
of wish it was Street Fighter cross Soul Calibur personally cuz I loves me some
Soul Calibur but I get it the universe the universe of Tekken and Street
Fighter are similar like Soul Calibur would not really fit as well in that
universe although Darth Vader and Yoda seemed to do okay yeah well Soul Calibur
is taking its own kind of interesting direction you know it's it's kind of
shifting in more to the customized character I would love to where's my
announcement Soul Calibur 5 because we should be about ready for that don't you
think Soul Calibur 4 was a couple years ago I'm just saying now what I really
want to see is a Capcom I hope you're listening I want I want to know the
rival schools um also let's get into this because it has kind of a funky name
and we've heard people say Street Fighter X Tekken because that's what it
literally reads like and we've heard like Tekken versus Street Fighter just
kind of people replacing it with versus but the name actually comes from a
couple years ago and I know we've talked about it on this show is a Japanese game
that never came out here there was already a Namco cross Capcom and it was
more of like it wasn't more like a strategy game or something just involved
the characters in the various universes I think it was is a tactical stretch it
was like a tactical game that is why I never bothered with it but it has some
sweet music so should be known that this is not the first time that Namco and
Capcom have kind of gotten in bed together this is you know kind of a
logical type of follow-up so it's a little weird in a way like I don't I'm
gonna admit I'm kind of sad that it's not a Capcom SNK part 3 because that's
what I would really like to see because I prefer my and you know Andy Bogard and
all them from the SNK universe but whatever you know I want them to do I
would like to have I mean as much as a Street Fighter and Tekken seems to be
such a logical choice for them to do a crossover game with because those are
the two biggest franchises of each company I would like I would have
preferred to have like a more generic all-out like how Capcom versus SNK was
you know where you had like they had the card fighters clash game that was just
pretty fun and then you had the fighting game and I like that the company's major
artists did each other's art for them you know like the Capcom artist did the
SNK artist and vice versa I would like to see because I'd like to have Klonoa
in a fighting game that was the joke I was about to make yeah Klonoa versus
Akuma well even in the trailer at the very end they show like Megaman chasing
a pac-man ghost and then a pac-man chomping after Megaman like it's really
weird and then I'm like are they gonna do something with Megaman universe like
what the hell are these two companies planning like what is this weird like
somebody is sleeping with somebody at the other company like seriously because
like now what's gonna happen next kadamari damashi meets Resident Evil I
mean you've made the zombie moon I should know that's how you make Pluto
cuz Pluto is the dead planet we should do that as a listless some week you know
the Namco cross Capcom series we'd like to see happen next that would just be
all kinds of wrong but this is interesting is Capcom's got a lot of
fighting games coming out because they've got this they've got Marvel
versus Capcom still happening well it's all these like X versus Y Marvel versus
Capcom 3 out there 3 was using my right hand but which I'm still majorly looking
forward to cuz dude my team of Deadpool and Dante all as she 100 Matt in our
chat room at chat.com is a nap calm that's when you read too fast I like
that name nap calm damn co cross Capcom was a massive financial failure I didn't
realize that but that might explain why it never came out to the u.s. I'm looking
at the Wikipedia article that we got linked here and trying to see what's
going on he out was a tactical game I'm trying to see how it was received oh
there's a lot of characters in the different games there reception it got a
28 out of 40 in Famitsu it was the top-selling game the week of release it
sold approximately 131,000 copies in its first six months of release and then it
got re-released as a PlayStation to the best I don't sound terrible maybe it
wasn't like oh my gosh blow your hair back but it sounds like it okay rating
coming from Famitsu you know how strict they are on the ratings haven't they
given like only five games a ten more like twelve and in ten dogs was one of
them just saying ten dogs is great for about five minutes which is how long
they must have played it for but usually yeah they've they've got some pretty
strict standards but they've had their moments of weakness that's for sure well
I don't know about you guys but I'm looking for this I I I played Tekken 1
2 3 like I had all those games the PlayStation 1 and then I kind of stopped
playing Tekken like I didn't really ever play four or five maybe I rented four I
don't remember well I remember what I got Tekken 6 from Gamefly and you came
over and we played it for a couple hours that's right I had 40 characters which
is like a ton amount of characters and we were like we don't we don't care it
was kind of bad like yeah isn't that great we just couldn't we yeah we
couldn't get into it I I really am curious to see kind of what
the Tekken cross I mean cuz we all know what Street Fighter cross Tekken is
gonna look like it's gonna be freaking Street Fighter 4 with Tekken characters
whoopee I'm more curious to see what Tekken cross Street Fighter ends up
looking like and because you know is it gonna be is it gonna kind of not be so
great like Tekken 6 or are they gonna maybe get the Soul Calibur people to
work on it I don't know it'd be interesting to see what happens did you
see the pictures Rob I saw the pictures of Street Fighter cross Tekken but I
didn't see the other way around I don't think there is
because this all happened at comic-con at the Capcom panel which by the way
isn't it weird that they waited for comic-con and didn't say something at
e3 I mean maybe they weren't ready to make an announcement at e3 but I mean
it wasn't that long ago it just seemed comic-con seems like a weird place to
make that type of announcement because you know comic-con all about the comic
books I thought that this particular shot was just epic and she's looking at
a shot of Ryu fighting Kazuya. Ryu looks like I'm gonna punch you! I have I
can tell you right now with the Tekken cross Street Fighter is gonna look like
huh the Street Fighter EX series I hope not oh god I'm sorry those games were
terrible I did not like them at all ex3 was all right because dude it's all
about skull mania but those weren't even produced by Capcom proper it was done
through an American company I really like those games so I'm surprised
hearing this from you right now what the EX series I thought I think it's really
underrated I liked them all okay well all yours
well if Namco is doing that one in particular then I'm more than certain
that they're gonna be sticking with Namco style for how they do it and
they've always had really tight gameplay for the Tekkens well what was that what
was the SNK game called remember those Capcom versus SNK but SNK put out what
SVC chaos yeah yeah that game wasn't so great not my I mean I love me some SNK
but Capcom I think made the better game it was all right yeah so all right
anyhow let's move on with some more gaming news we're gonna release dates in
a little bit after this next round of news starting off with Loki mm-hmm Sony
has patented multiplayer via stereoscopic systems basically the way
this is gonna work they actually had something similar and I'm surprised that
they're able to patent this anyways they have a way now using the kind of
shutter system or whatever that you'll only be able to see your I guess your
player or whatever on the screen at one time while someone else can actually see
the full screen as well so it'll do split screen by basically having two
different images on the screen at the same time and each player will only be
able to see their own you know version of the screen using those shutter
glasses they actually have this already in TVs right now because I know you can
actually do that with those 120 megahertz TVs and watch two different
programs at the same time or two different inputs but I guess this would
actually kind of combine it with only one input but it would still be two
different versions of the game or whatever they're playing I don't know
why but that technology sounds painful to me it's really um it's it's a neat
idea but it's really it's not something that they're gonna be like oh my god you
can do this it'll be kind of cool but at the same time it's kind of a dumb use of
if I've got these 3d glasses that I'm paying for in this 3d TV that I'm
paying for I'm gonna want to use the 3d portion of that and not necessarily the
split-screen portion of that but what if you want to watch one show and your
sister wants to watch another show I mean now you both can watch the same
show but wouldn't it be cheaper to get a second TV no it's not that at all it's
this would be just to play like it's a multiplayer game but you're just
watching two different play or two different players are using the same
screen but couldn't you do that if look at I mean if it's if it's canceling out
one image and only showing you you know basically half the yeah you can do that
with certain TVs but not this system this is a totally different system that
okay so you can do that right now with certain 120 megahertz TVs if you have
that shutter system you can basically do picture-in-picture or you can be stop
being a little pussy and just you know look at half the fucking screen it's
just spinning like hundreds up hundreds of dollars on a fucking camera or like a
stupid shutter glass system just to do this just buy another damn TV like you
said but the game system doesn't have the processing power to handle the
split-screen those PlayStation threes with their what are they called I don't
know the uber cores or whatever those are in the emotion engine no that was
ps2 the ps3s have something else the cell and just sell yeah well here's the
thing though but it can't handle split-screen yes it can handle split
screens if it can handle two different screens it's the same fucking thing
actually it's even more processor intensive what they really should have
done Rob is they should have gone back to the original design of the PS remember
the original design of the ps3 how ridiculous that was with like it's three
HDMI outs and it's dual LAN outs and stuffs like what the fuck do you need
that stuff for but I mean if that's really what they want to do with this
then why not just do that so we can have two fucking TVs or I don't know how
about you just stop being a little whiny bitch about it and just not worry about
it seriously how many fucking split-screen games are out there not
that much anymore which is really sad it is sad it should be more because there's
a lot of you know like resistance was a fun split-screen game but there's not a
lot of stuff out there Call of Duty you know that'll still do split-screen but
it's not a lot out there and why even bother you know working on this
technology for like a handful of games say you think blur split-screen the
racing game except everyone hates that game for some reason I don't know why
it's not that bad but you know who does have the technology to handle split
screen flawlessly and who couldn't could bring split screen all our homes the
Skynet just saying I can get behind that all right but I mean if you really if
this is such an issue I mean I just I I don't understand I yeah some of your
screens you know blocked out I've never had the problem where it's like oh my
god this is just so painful I can't play this game anymore in split-screen oh my
day is ruined you know I can't imagine that that would be a problem yeah
because I need to go hey look we can play it to you know a two-player game or
whatever but what's gonna stop someone from say I don't know adjusting the
shutters on their glasses to sneak a peek at what you're doing it's exactly
the same shit all over again I get motion sick with split screens really
you can't just focus on one no mines don't work that way but you also can't
play first-person shooters so anyways but like when we were doing racing games
on split screens it would actually give me a headache after a while even Mario
Kart on the old Super Nintendo yeah really that's too bad that was like the
king of split screen right there yeah it was because the aspect rate will
especially for the older ones the aspect ratio is changed so badly that it really
starts putting a strain on my eyes too bad alright well I'm moving on to
something that I don't know if they'll be able to put split screen into this
but it's a new technology ish thing coming to PlayStation home it's a
partnership with codename codename I guess is this indie game label that is
gonna never heard of the content for PlayStation home one of the games whoa
wait yeah I think you put out content like sodium one I know right well what
if one of the first games is called dueling gentleman is the first game I
wonder if that will be like I don't know like dueling gentleman sounds a lot like
like when I think of dual I think of that game wild gunman on the old
Nintendo system ok here's here is wild gunman on the NES if you've never played
it's a light gun game and when the game says draw you push the button on the gun
as fast as you can and on harder rounds you have to pull the trigger faster so
maybe that's a dueling gentleman will be as it'll be press X button to win
because that's all wild gunman was by the way it was like a $30 $40 game back
in the day alright to be fair I have no idea what the hell this game is about
there is a little bit of info though about this you're gonna be using I guess
strategy in homes plaza to go against other people in home I have no idea what
that is but I guess also peanut galleries and other developer they're
gonna be making minor battle it's a capture the flag type of game and then
codename is making super awesome mountain RPG it's gonna have tabletop
port board games with fantasy role-playing I could be interesting
bringing like a little bit of tabletop in a home so because they have super and
awesome in the title does not mean it's gonna be super awesome in fact actually
having super and awesome in the title usually means it's not super awesome a
game by lazy eight called cogs will be in 3d and it will be a dynamic pub
public spectacle in home central plaza really I thought the furry dance-off day
and Sony home was the dynamic public spectacle but maybe that's just me I
don't know oh I got your dynamic public spectacle and any of this is gonna be
able to be translated into I don't know stuff for my apartment or a club is this
gonna expand the clubs in any way maybe I don't know yeah I don't think they
haven't said because it's not gonna happen
didn't sodium one like have a shirt oh my god I totally misinterpreted sodium
one then it's the most awesome it's the super awesomest thing ever cuz I got a
shirt you couldn't you can win a shirt but but Loki it's not actually a real
shirt it's not like back in the Atari 2600 days or they would actually send
you patches for your jacket if you got a high enough score and like you know
barnstorming or ever and they should do that that's that's what that's what
achievements are their virtual I can't wear my achievements Microsoft get on
that oh wait what if you could wear your achievements you technically can on your
avatars somewhat they have those new unlockable things that you do for
different things that's what I want like on left 4 dead 2 for the 8 360 once you
unlock five or six achievements you would unlock a leopard at 2 t-shirt for
your avatar which you could then wear and go on one versus a hundred and show
off your left 4 dead 2 t-shirt they've done that in a few games but not a lot
of used it yet and I wonder if it's something we'll start seeing more in the
next couple years like blur you can get a shirt for your avatar and blur too I
think there's a couple of shirts you can get one of them is really easy to get
because I got it like I have a sombrero in for Red Dead Redemption I'm which I
noticed the other day I'm like oh okay wonderful
well we'll see if the indie games are worth launching home but for now Dark
Sakura what do you got for us I have more stuff specifically for our buddies
overseas in the UK this is about the halo reach Xbox 360 bundle I don't know
how much of it maps over to the US but I'm focusing on our friends overseas at
any rate um it's gonna be exclusive to game and game station it will be a
$249.99 that's pounds will be out on September 14th it will have the
limited-edition wireless controller the wireless headset those will be available
in the UK on the 3rd of September and we're actually getting it later than
they are over there the controller is going to be $39.99 the headset will be
$34.99 and they are going to be limited and available for pre-order now as far
as in the u.s. I believe that we're getting the bundle for $399 on September
14th so a new controller will be available on yeah maybe fix the fucking
d-pad yet new for the record our wireless controller is going to be 60 bucks and
come with a covenant banshee avatar token for Xbox Live and the headset will
be 50 bucks over here and they will be in late August $60 for a controller like
I realize that's how much they cost now but it's just got controllers are
expensive it's a little ridiculous especially for a controller that's
essentially defective all right all right let's travel around the world and
see what you can waste your money on this week in the world of gaming Loki
will start with you there's a couple things this week that are worth
mentioning obviously Starcraft 2 on PC is gonna be a big thing but you think a
Starcraft 2 the wings of Liberty remember there will be three versions of
this game why I don't I don't see the point because they'll sell it three
times to hold they'll sell it they'll try to sell it three times but I know
think the second and third versions of the game will be that great ok but that
will be coming out this week on PC a game called galaxy racers coming to the
DS thanks to Ubisoft it is just like it sounds a game re-erasing space clash of
the Titans coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 where you will release the
Kraken or at least fight the Kraken that is released upon you at least that's
what I gather that movie is about because that's all I ever see in the
trailers Kraken being released all right Chuck E. Cheese party games coming to the
Wii here's a hint people it's not really a brand new game per se the company UFO
interactive they have taken these games called smart girls and smart boys Club
and they've just re-skinned them with Chuck E. Cheese stuff you know that's
really unfair to the dumb boys and the dumb girls of the world I know it's sad
but that will be coming to the Wii Arc Rise Fantasia also coming to the Wii
supposed to be pretty awesome RPG if you're into fighting games blaze blue
continuum shift will be coming out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 I do believe
PC version is going to be available soon as well although if you know where look
it's already been out there for months now arcade game used to run on PC
hardware and that's basically it and then my god next week there's a whole
bunch of junk so I got a question y'all and I want to ask this of chat as well
should I buy Starcraft 2 like I was a part of me that kinda wants it like
despite all my anger at Blizzard the past month in the show like they do make
some really good games and yeah I'm terrible at RTS is but I know some of my
friends are buying this game and they're not very good either so I'll have people
to play with right now what look cool about Starcraft 2 as the level editor
and all the like fun stuff you could do with that like you know the Mario Kart
type game and like stuff like that I think that will be neat well for one I
want to make sure like I I kinda wanna wait for the reviews of this game to
come out because I want to see what they look like I want to know if my real name
is going to show in the battles like I want to see how far they took real ID in
Starcraft 2 that be funny because like see like if I were to sign up on this I
don't have an account or anything and no real name so I could just like create a
character called dicks McButt or something like that is like you have to
sign up for a battle net account to play Starcraft 2 so you know they would want
you know your real name but you could always put you know Matt Loki is your
name and I guess they'd really be none the wiser they wouldn't be so I don't
know so I'm waiting to see what the game like as much as going to the midnight
release might be kind of fun I'm gonna really resist that temptation and just
like what give it a week and just kind of see what the reception is and then I
guess make my decision from there I personally would wait three months two
or three months because you know during that first quarter after it comes out
they're all of the balance issues are gonna come out and they're just gonna
patch the hell out of it and nerf all the things that need to be nerfed so
wait three months and get a more more even version of the game three months I
know three months in three months dance central will be here and in cataclysm
will be here at DC Universal be on the way I'm gonna have time in three months
for cataclysm won't be here in three months okay it's gonna take at least
four months see Christmas Thanksgiving Christmas when is cataclysm coming out
technically fall right now sometime November all right but the fall is the
official date so far so far yeah all right let's move on to Japan and look at
some of the release oh look at the some of the release dates of Japan tiger
claws linking me to a story that I want to get to later in our chat room I have
that on the list for later so we'll talk more about Starcraft 2 later in the show
sure zone our chat room says Dix McButt should be on the wiki the orange large
radio wiki maybe that's that can be like your quintessential like online name no
it's just I was just trying to think of something ridiculous and I'm able to
think of things that are very ridiculous all the time all right let's move on to
the Japanese release date Xbox 360 quite a bit now we've had some quiet weeks but
now some more stuff starting to come out Agra SNK 0 dawn of war is coming out in

Liberty also on the 27th and the 30th the ship simulator extremes for PC yeah
that's about it two more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the
week as dark Sakura's picked well this is we're getting closer and closer to
our 150th game in the classic game of the week episode 400 will be the 150
games we started on 250 because I looked at the wiki today randomly and you
started this because you've had some say well let's see back in the early days of
the show you didn't really have a segment like that I mean but your
regular segments didn't start till we did the podcast and you had what you had
the website of the week and my advice column ice column like what to do if you
get caught on fire because I was using my my worst-case scenario survivor
handbook calendar mm-hmm which was great like how to deliver a baby and how does
navigate a landmine and how to ride a camel but I'm like I'm liking your
classic game of the week they've been very good incorporate this into
something for geek life to who I do Tales from the Vault every Sunday I like
how you've worked in yet another plug this week for geek life go you geek
dash life calm yeah but that one's the more specific about you know memories
around gaming the dash is important because you need to dash on over there
yeah huh I know right all right low-key ah so there's this game called rock band
three that's supposed to be coming out this year sometime in the fall now we
can kind of narrow it down to October 26 I'll be hitting the shelves in North
America just in time for your Halloween parties where you need to rock out to
stuff and then of course you with that obviously there's gonna be different
pre-order bonuses for wherever you decide to pre-order the game if you
pre-order the title at Walmart you get a $10 e gift card if you pre-order through
Amazon they will unlock an exclusive in-game guitar for you yay that's worth
it pre-orders with the GameStop will be able to download three songs for free at
launch including my own summer by the Deftones blue Monday by new order and
burning down the house by talking heads nice how does it feel I want to sing
that song dark soccer you need to have a rock band party when this game comes out
okay I'm getting a keyboard for sure now again please assure me mr. guy who works
at the distributor please assure me I will be able to get keyboard plus game
that's it right yes absolutely that's a bundle that is available they in fact I
don't believe they have full band bundles for this one I think it's just
well the the game by itself and then I want to say maybe they may have a full
bundle but I haven't seen it I know that the keyboard game bundle is out there in
fact I believe that it's already available for pre-order through certain
websites and with stop and yes keyboard bundle $130 pro guitar $150 or you can
buy the keyboard by itself for $80 what would I do with the keyboard by itself I
need a game to play well I guess I could use it as a MIDI keyboard but that that's
dumb I want to play blue Monday how does it feel and and the what there's the
Queen song right became your Rhapsody yeah oh my god I can't wait to play
these on pro expert because then once I learned how to do it you can actually go
to a real keyboard what about that gets harder than $150 yeah I don't need it I
don't need it but there'll be some people that want it there's some people
are pretty hardcore all right one more story from me for you guys and that has
to do with comic-con obviously there has been like a games invasion at comic-con
this year lots and lots of stuff being shown I just wanted to run down for you
guys I mean it's almost like a half of comic-con is basically three all over
again but even some new stuff as we heard earlier you know with a street
fighter cross Tekken and vice versa Activision is there Activision is
showing off a spider-man game which I don't think made it toward the cut for
our show tonight but apparently I'm hearing a lot of early buzz on the
spider-man game that it's gonna blow all the others out of the water absolutely
won't take much but there you go they're also showing guitar hero and call of
duty as well Capcom's they're showing Marvel vs. Capcom 3 that's obviously
they're big big thing that they're pushing understandably but obviously
they're gonna work in plugs for dead rising 2 and Okamedan and all this other
stuff EA is apparently there too they actually took rock band 3 to the show
because you know when I think comic books I think rock band 3 in my living
room a Dead Space 2 is there Dragon Age 2 is supposedly there and playable which
is more than they had at e3 again yet another game Hudson is there to bomber
man live apparently they're showing Konami is there a bit apparently Hideo
Kojima is actually judging a cosplay tournament there at the show it's kind
of cool so they brought some of their games to the show Namco is showing off
Splatterhouse and enslaved Nintendo went to the show they took Metroid other M
and Dragon Quest 9 Sony Computer Entertainment went to show off a little
bit planet to kill zone 3 in Gran Turismo 5 among other things and of
course Warner Brothers had to take super scribble knots to their massive booth
they have and then Microsoft and Xbox took their summer of arcade lineup there
that of course includes limbo hydro thunder the new Tomb Raider game among
other things and th cues there lots and lots of video games square enix I guess
is they're showing off Final Fantasy the four heroes alight no word on if they're
showing 14 though which by the way I did I did give the beta another try this
week and I got other stuff to play this fall sorry no sir he did not like it it
looks really good it's pretty gorgeous really pretty but um you know a pretty
painting wah wah all right forget it it's like the dumb blonde yes yes Final
Fantasy 14 is a dumb blonde I love that comparison it's a bimbo not what I'd
like beautiful tits but just nothing upstairs can they get that printed on
the back of the box like you know how the you know how they'll take like
review snippets for certain games I want that to be like Rob Roberts of Orange
Lounge Radio on Final Fantasy 14 beautiful tits just nothing upstairs I
like that description I like that too all right hey how about a we stop
looking at new games and take a trip down memory lane segment on the show
here we call the classic game of the week and every week dark soccer likes to
go into the vault and find one game that she's been playing and say hey you kids
in your comic cons and your newfangled stuff need to take a minute to respect
the games that have come before you better recognize you better recognize
now this game I know that she picked this week isn't super old but it's older
than you might think sadly it's amazing dark soccer what is the classic game of
the week this week hydro thunder hydro thunder let me fire up some music here
from hydro thunder I love the name of that ship damn the torpedoes this one
that Dan knows at any rate it was part of the thunder series of games this game
came out in 1999 and had a Dreamcast release and then it came out for
PlayStation and instead of 64 in 2000 and the other thunder games is offered
thunder four-wheel thunder and Arctic Thunder which Arctic Thunder is pretty
damn fun anyway it's racing with boats you have places like the Arctic Circle
and you have New York disaster which is the post-apocalyptic you've got the Greek
Isles and Thunder Park which is like a whole rally type of setting with water
you've got different boosts all over the place the ones that will enable you to
either go for a little bit or like get a lot of them the red ones are they give
you more fuel as opposed to the blue one so you do have a fuel gauge at least as
far as your boosts are concerned and then with boosting you can actually do
jumps or you can knock boats sort of off the track and it's pretty cool the
arcade cabinet was the same type of cabinet is cruising USA and offered
thunder except it didn't have the foot pedals I used a throttle and it had a
interesting type of volume deal where he just ran over a penguin that bastard
I'm just saying had a subwoofer in the seat so you could feel like you're
actually on a boat I'm on a boat with your boats you had the easy ones you had
four categories there were easy easy medium hard and bonus with easy you had
damn the torpedoes midway and misbehave they had a big fan instead of a
propeller the medium boats you had banshee tidal blade thresher and the
tidal blade is the cover for the dreamcast the hard ones you had cut
throat a rad hazard that was sort of like UFO and Razorback which was that
was on the PlayStation 1064 ones and if you pick one of those they say you're
great whoa your mic cut out again I don't know what it's something is weird
in that connection I don't know what it is you look at the cord and I'll use the
other one all right how's this perfect okay um with the bonus boats you had
tiny tannic which was a small version of the Titanic and you had the blowfish
and chumdinger which was a fishing boat it would actually bark at the other
boats you also have armed response which is the police boats with a turret guns
there was all the different tracks like I mentioned with Thunder Park lost
island the Arctic Circle then going into medium with Lake Powell which is one that
was really fun it's like a lake in the middle of Utah that's actually the same
Lake Powell supposed to be there's a Far East Greek Isles and then the hard
tracks there was ship graveyard Venice canals in New York disaster which New
York disaster was actually kind of my favorite and then the bonus ones you had
Castle Von Dandy Nile adventure which was the longest tracking game catacombs
and hydro speedway which was the one that was the rally style there were
different versions of course like I said those the dreamcast one the PlayStation
one had a career mode in it the dreamcast though was closest to the
arcade of any of the consoles Nintendo 64 version was actually amazingly fun
and really good for what it was it had a four player multiplayer instead of two
player and you could do that with Nintendo 64 expansion pack and the
dreamcast version is the one that's on Midway arcade treasures 3 there's also a
PC version that was out in Europe the dreamcast version was one of the Sega
all-star titles and there is going to be a sequel out well there's a spiritual
sequel already out called h2 overdrive which is pretty fun the original team
that worked on hydro Thunder did h2 overdrive button through all thrills and
then hydro Thunder hurricane is going to be out on xbox live arcade and Microsoft
bought the rights after Midway was acquired by Warner Brothers so there you
have it

radio
welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio we are taping live on this Sunday
evening July the 25th of 2010 at all games dot-com all games radio which we
are a part of where we tape our show because live radio is just how we've
done it for the past eight years and I don't think we'd have it any other way
although some weeks I don't know some weeks I know we do we love our chatters
and and of course they interact with us for the emails and the calls and the
tweets that you know all that good stuff so well we'll get into Twitter topics in
just a little bit of course we have to do rapid-fire news in just a moment but
I want to talk about this real quick remember last week on the show we had a
story about the Kmart was going to be start to post reviews of it from their
website they would actually post them on the shelves the story guys remember us
talking about this okay well apparently um as well we told our listeners that
they should start writing these completely nonsensical like stupid
things and submit them into the Kmart reviews and that would be really funny
just like flood their reviews a bunch of dumb stuff well we had at least one
listener submit one review so thank you to that one individual who did SGA 100
Matt sent this in I love it he submitted a review of Red Dead Redemption and it's
on the PlayStation 3 and I love this you have to check this out because you
Bamani fans will get a kick out of this this game is dynamite rave it's a review
by mr. Spanky wow I can't stop falling in love with this game this game has you
go west to play the hero and tackle the hysteria of the end of the century while
west you can drop out of the story mode at any time and dive into the online
multiplayer with your friends be for you head over to buy this be sure to bring
your ID to show to the kind lady at Kmart because it's rated M for mature
put your faith in me this game is sweet like candy also holic so you should
proceed immediately to Kmart's website and upvote that review and write more
because that's great I know not everybody's gonna get that joke but for
the money folks that's that's awesome for those that don't go write something
even worse good times on Kmart reviews all right let's get into the rapid-fire
news of some actual gaming news that happened this week stuff we have in
short little bites for you guys Loki yes so guitar hero words of rock will be
coming out in a couple months here and of course they always have to have
someone epic really difficult song to play in the game well apparently there
is going to be one track very similar to some other long songs that have been in
the game it will include Russia's 20 minute long seven part epic 21 12 and I
guess it's a few parts that are progressive rock and then I don't know
I've never heard the song but that's a long ass song 20 minutes that's
ridiculous it's almost like that one achievement in rock band that you have
to play like every single song in the game and it takes on it like an hour or
two yeah that makes me think of um any god it is my my working I don't I think
barely we just you're it's it's wired for Jamie not you try giving that one to
Jamie and use that one live radio yeah as far as epic songs for rock band or
since they have a keyboard they should do in a gada da vida which I think is a
good 23 minutes with the keyboards so yeah good times yeah that song is one
whole hallucination something else that was at comic-con this week and I don't
even know why it was at comic-con it's like kencha Hulk type of stuff but
apparently they had a game from an independent developer called a Bobo's big
adventure and you may not remember a Bobo but sadly I think I do a Bobo is
from Double Dragon ah yes and but was big adventure has him going through a
bunch of 8-bit NES classics kind of parody style it is a PC game but they
had it displayed on a cabinet I would like to read this brief I'm sure this
game is extremely legal yes I would like to read this brief description of some
of the levels here let's see here okay the first stage that this person played
looked just like Double Dragon starting off he encountered typical enemies and
fought them off with the exact same control scheme from the original Double
Dragon game but then the the guys from kung-fu showed up all in a row goombas
from Super Mario Brothers waddled into the screen and Kid Nicky followed and he
was trying to fall fight them all off but then Donkey Kong jumped up on the
surface above and started throwing exploding barrels as head has it was
like all of NES done was out to get him I these they only felt better when an
8-bit bystander walked up to a Bobo and he ripped his head off and ate it and
then used his body to fight a charging skateboard from TNC surf what there's
another another level called super my Bobo found a bow in a jail cell after
picking up trash and eating it a Bobo had to use the cell toilet something he
ate must not have agreed with him because a massive vertical column of
shit came out of his ass and somehow had him flying over the toilet and falling
down into or down into it yes you're just making this up really this ends up
to being like a warp pipe the Super Mario Brothers and both finds himself in
a parody of the water world from that game and he has a Yoshi like tongue that
enables him to eat and spit enemies into other enemies there's also apparently
some Megaman I saw in there I feel like a bunch of like 19 year olds got really
high one night and in between eating Cheetos they just started like talking
and somebody was like dude dude that's really good like dude show the dude
that's hella funny dude dude you should write that down dude and like they did
like things to get posted to new grounds when you're blackout drunk basically
funny that you should mention that new grounds because that's where this game
will be featured at some what a surprise as what a goddamn surprise I'm gonna
fall over and die from that surprise dot-com so yeah but was big adventure
supposed to be out in December it looks funny I guess I don't know and then
finally that plot he read sounded like the plot to the poop that took a pee the
poop that took a pee it was on an episode as narrated by Morgan Freeman
why it was Morgan Freeman it wasn't Morgan Freeman the poop that took a pee
he can I Leo Poland a butterscotch anything uh legend of mana is gonna be
the next game hitting the Japanese PlayStation 1 classics nice on the
PlayStation Network of course be out next week for 600 in or 650 so I mean
it's gonna be to other regions soon speaking of poops it took a pee like
legend of man it's like seriously like my least favorite PlayStation game I was
so disappointed in that game I realized it has its fans and what have you but I
was I was expecting what I think was really then keep in mind this was many
years ago I didn't know there was this whole like import gaming scene
everything so in my mind what really was second at set to three I thought was
what I was kind of getting with was going to get with legend of mana and
then it was like I don't understand what what what is this but you liked it
didn't you Alan you tell me one day I did I did like it's wrong I played it
all the way through I did every little stupid class you probably like saga
frontier too well I had the Japanese it was terrible and it was so hard it was
so heavy language wise I couldn't play it very well do you like the saga
series too yeah I got I was really excited about saga frontier because it
made it sound like chrono trigger with the combo attacks okay yeah and I played
it and yeah that was pretty awful behind lasted an hour yeah I lasted about an
hour to us like this game is terrible all right anyhow let's move on to some
other quick news hey up there in canadia you're gonna be getting Netflix finally
of course I'm talking about Canada I'm not that stupid
Canada's finally getting Netflix I actually I gotta be honest I didn't
realize they didn't already have it like I usually with a lot of this broadcast
stuff they get the rights cleared pretty quickly but sadly yeah Canada's kind of
been shut out so they will finally be getting Netflix up there but you should
be aware if you're French Canadian and you don't speak English well I don't
know why you're listening to this show for one but yeah the French Netflix
service is not going to be out right away but it will come out eventually so
you will be able to get this in Canada on the 360 the ps3 and we so they are
not really they're being a little vague on if it's going to be the exact same
movies and so forth because the clearance is and so forth but they do
give you the nice little marketing fluff of Canadian Netflix members will be able
to instantly watch a broad array of movies and TV episodes right on their
TVs via a range of consumer electronic devices capable of streaming from
Netflix as well as PCs and Macs so yeah I you know you're going to be getting it
but it's probably not going to look the exact same as it does here at least not
right away so yeah Joystick had emailed Netflix looking for comment and Netflix
responded to the big blog we're not announcing the Netflix ready devices
until the service launches but it's fair to assume that several popular brand
name devices will be capable of streaming from Netflix to TVs at launch
in addition to the ability to watch instantly on computers and that will add
to the family of devices over time so hooray for you guys in Canada I suppose
Plants vs. Zombies is going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade finally early
September I played I played this on an iPad this week a little bit because yes
I was looking at an iPad I wanted to buy one then and I thought mmm I really

get into that on the iPhone 4 ok yeah so it's going to be in 1080p and 21
different minigames co-op and co-op and versus mode 1200 Microsoft points so
sometime in September Castlevania puzzle encore of the night is now available on
the App Store it's actually getting pretty decent reviews so I checked it
out I haven't been able to play it myself but just if you were curious it
is now available on the App Store so I'll have to check that out at some
point sadly I can't do it right now because I'm trying to do a show Dark
Sakura in other news we have LittleBigPlanet 2 dated for the 16th of
November I'm here in the US the European dates not out yet and the collector's
edition will have a plushie Sackboy and bookends and there will be different
pre-order and exclusive costumes and five LittleBigPlanet 2 PlayStation
Network avatars that should be 80 bucks something sounds gross about plushie
Sackboy if you squeeze amigos plush on you and then for our downloads for the
UK we've got 3d space tank it's DSi aware also known as Xscape then we've
got as soon as it loads because my computer slow minor disturbance and my
ner which is for iPhone it's 99 pence Astro dodge which is also for iPhone for
£1.24 and did you do sorry it's taking a while Pearl Harbor trilogy 1941 Red
Sun rising for we wear 700 we points crossfire on the Xbox live indie games
and that's it now we also have other cool news for those of us who are Capcom
fans is that they're doing an online version of Street Fighter 3 third strike
which they're calling it Street Fighter 3 third strike online which is an update
to the Dreamcast one but you want to know what they already made it and I
already own it it was the for matching service you remember how when everything
has a long title I usually end for matching service on it that's it it came
out in Japan already so I've already got it yeah but most people over here never
heard of it so you know with the success of their online games I'm assuming
they're just giving this the old Xbox live arcade update correct yeah pretty
much so but it is well that mic sucks Jamie I don't know what to say you know
it's probably me because my voice isn't very no I mean you cut completely out
it's the cord it's not your voice well shit exactly huh yeah all right I'll
take Alan's mic thank you you're being nice for sharing let's move on to some
Twitter topics twitter.com slash olr you guys send us tweets every week and we
respond to them live on air maybe there's stories we didn't get around to
sharing who knows what it's all about we're gonna start off with death death
wishing tonight do you guys hate Kotek to the evil CEO he's my least favorite
human being next to Aquaman do we hate Bobby Kotek hey is a strong word and yes
but yes all right um TigerClaw305 sent us a link he always sends us great
links Disney is in talks apparently to buy Playdom. Playdom by the way made such
awesome Facebook games like sorority life didn't Disney just buy somebody
Disney bought what Tapulous and so now Disney is in talks with Playdom buy them
out for five hundred million is what they're saying again these are all
rumors but Disney's gonna use this company to incorporate its popular
brands and characters into social games Playdom by the way is based out of
Mountain View California I never knew that that's not that far away so yeah
there you go apparently Disney might use its ESPN brands on some of this as well
could be very interesting Playdom ranks third behind Zynga and Playfish by the
way just you know of big social game companies let's see some folks retreat
we're tweeting our congratulatory message to Bobby so grads Bobby
let's see spazz nator says do you think we'll ever see a Mortal Kombat versus
Street Fighter game there's been a lot of talk tonight about Street Fighter
cross Tekken what about the two ultimate I guess in some regards maybe even top
if you dare go there fighting game franchises Street Fighter Mortal Kombat
could it ever happen what do you guys think good Street Fighter versus Mortal
Kombat ever happened it could they play nice with Warner I mean obviously
they're playing nice with other you know publishers so it could happen whether it
will happen or not I don't know I think someone did a Mugen one where they took
the the Street Fighter movie ones in the old Mortal Kombat that were all the
image capture and did a Mugen version Mortal Kombat is sort of all about the
fatalities and the over-the-topness and you know all those Street Fighter has
some over-the-top I don't know if I could see it like I can't see the
Street Fighter characters really doing fatalities and then if you take the
fatalities on a Mortal Kombat like what's left you know now what if they
did Mortal Kombat versus crap that eternal champions what you got it how
long ago is eternal champions eternal champions needs to come back with the
Senate bills and everything just do a real kill again throw kill is horrible
yeah I don't see a game where Sakura gets her spine ripped out I just I can't
I can't there is something wrong with that like how would you feel about that
dark Sakura if there was a game where you could just like totally rip Sakura's
arms off well as long as they included a non-black your ear out again it's just
a dammit though I am I in now yeah okay I was basically saying if they included
a non blacked-out version of the shingle kusatsu with all kinds of you know
beating up and you know breaking noses and bones and having it be really
destructive and leave them as a bloody pulp then maybe I could deal with it I
don't know there just would have to be too much compromise one way or the other
I just don't see like Street Fighter and Tekken kind of makes sense and as much
as I love Soul Calibur like it wouldn't make sense like the Street Fighter
people don't use weapons weapons are a huge part of Soul Calibur it would make
sense so but Street Fighter Tekken yeah I get that I get it all right let's see
other comments on our twitter twitter.com slash o-l-r Matt SJ 100 Matt is
sending us a tweet is Capcom jumping the shark releasing all of these versus
games all at once I'm excited but this should have happened ten years ago
honestly thank Street Fighter 4 I honestly think Street Fighter 4 is the
reason for a lot of this and I think the really warm reception the community had
to this kind of made them decide to listen to the fans a little more and now
they are just just giving fans what they want left and right it's kind of like
what game do you want oh you want oh well here you go then it's kind of where
Capcom is going lately you know so I don't know dark soccer do you think this
is too much or not enough or what I think it's just right all right all
right and last tweet from rock man rock that's not a redundant name at all I
love that name rock man rock why are you guys so awesome is the tweet why are you
guys so awesome I was born that way well it's that's very nice I some days I do
think I'm awesome but some days I don't feel so awesome
but Rob why not I just you know some days are harder than others but your
tweets help me get through the day I appreciate it
twitter.com slash olr if you want to send us some tweets for now more news
loki yes so apparently their rock star is cracking down on Red Dead Redemption
cheaters now I have a problem with them saying that because that's not exactly
what's going on here they're cutting I guess they're cracking down on people
that are utilizing glitches in the game for example they're saying that people
are glitching into parts of the map that you're not supposed to be able to glitch
into like for example there's a house that's in kind of the Mexico part of the
game or you can actually kind of aim at or walk into the corner of a wall and
you'll clip through the ground and you can shoot at stuff underneath it and
apparently people are pissed off that they're getting shot by people that they
can't shoot back at and so because of that you know they're gonna start
patching the game or fixing it so they can't clip through these different
things whatever fine do that people will just find other glitches since the game
is super glitchy but it's not legitimate cheating say you know where they've
modded the game to make their guns fire rockets or something like that like that
happens in Grand Theft Auto like crazy no one's figured out how to do that yet
because exploits are not hacks there's a huge difference between an exploit and a
hack exactly and you know I don't understand why people are up in arms
about this crap because you just don't go where those players are then because
you can see them on the map they're not invisible and obviously if they're under
a building or something they keep shooting at you then perhaps you should
walk away from them I mean there's no real hacks or whatever to say you know
immediately kill somebody you know with homing bullets or something ridiculous
like that nothing like that yet but you know when they make a gun that starts
firing dynamite or something that's different but just because people are
you know clipping through stuff doesn't really necessarily make it a cheat I
also agree that exploits are not cheating because like you know I've
played a lot of these online games like you know kind of like fan games don't
make fun me okay I like Survivor and Big Brother and a lot of those like a
reality shows that have very game centric things and you know people put
together challenges and I love to find loopholes in the challenge rules and win
every time like that's you know I do that
unity is very important I do similar stuff in Grand Theft Auto there's
different exploits you can use they're not necessarily it's not cheating I
guess because it's still playing within the rules of game and everybody can do
it just because they don't know about it doesn't that's not my problem that you
don't you know read up on this stuff like there's a way to fire the sniper
rifle really fast by crouching and crouching there's ways to fall off a
large from a large distance and not take any damage by doing a stunt role in mid
air you know stuff like that but you know it's stuff that I've learned through
you know just reading online and through when you've seen people do stuff and
kind of figuring out how they did different things and it makes me a
better player now granted it's not like I'm using you know modded weapons that
fire rockets at people like crazy and there's lots of people out there to do
that there's a difference between utilizing you know the nuances of the
game you know the different glitches and actually cheating in the game to the
point that it's an unfair advantage knowledge is not cheating cheating is
cheap alright and if you cheat in an online game you're kind of a dick anyway
unless you're cheating with your friends and you all agree that cheating is okay
that's different well if you're doing that then you know like the modded games
that will play against each other that's not necessarily cheating it's just
you're playing with a whole different set of rules now or fun it's it's a mod
it's not it's not cheating it's like if we played our with our modded weapons
against other players that would be cheating so a mod it's a mod here Loki
here's something to entertain you while I do this next story here here you go
how to entertain you for I am NOT I'm not playing this on an iPhone I'm sorry
I feel dirty for having robot unicorn attack and it's it's it's Loki's
favorite game and they have an iPhone it's not my favorite game but yes it is
your favorite game you play it all the time during the show I'm surprised you're
not playing it tonight and they have it on the iPhone now and it you know you
just tap the screen to do your jumping and I can't see you this directions I'm
probably falling everywhere but there you go I played this a lot this week too
all right good times remember always I want to be I almost forgot to show that
to Loki was something reminded me of that early I knew it was out other
people like me I can't believe you made me buy that game because it's you know
you keep talking about like I haven't played it in like months now you are
playing it last week on the show I was not playing it last week on the show
two weeks ago on the show it wasn't two weeks ago either yes it was I'll go in
the archives and find it and like if you if you turn up the music really loud in
the background you'll hear oh you should totally make this for your baby's room
what's that it's a toadstool stool sorry and I told you and I'm easily out of it
easily distracted kind of that's all right well here's something that's very
distracting it's this Old Spice ad on the left side of this page here with the
Old Spice guy because you know he's awesome anyhow I know really it's about
the Mega Man universe a little more information I mean little little more
information at comic-con this week from Akiko Ido actually talked about this a
little bit he's the producer I'm sorry actually it's a Kenji Inafune actually
talked about this he's the producer of Mega Man universe and no he's the
creator of Mega Man no he's a homeless man I don't know Kenji Inafune is the
creator of Mega Man and Akiko Ido is the Mega Man universe producer there we go
can't you tell I'm like totally up on my video game trivia anyway Mega Man
universe of course is coming out eventually and they say it will let you
play as the Mega Man of your dreams the concept of Mega Man universe quote came
from the idea of what Mega Man is and what it means to different people
everyone has a unique idea of what Mega Man is and they even referred to the
quote crappy version of Mega Man from the original cartridge that character
they don't know about they didn't really say like what the game really really is
but a lot of people are inferring like maybe it's just like that and I think
Loki said this last week on the show it's kind of like that Nintendo
championships or whatever they call that game with all the Nintendo characters
the Nintendo crossover game or Mario crossover right they say that it's gonna
quote unite Mega Man fans from around the planet to play together in one place
then they close by saying you haven't heard the last of the Mega Man
announcements out there and they say they're gonna give an oft requested
thing to what you guys want and the crowd promptly started shouting Mega Man
Legends 3 and he just smiled and said thank you and didn't confirm I hope so
by the way the game we're gonna be we only cuz I will be pissed the game will
also not be out for a while I don't know what a while is but it's gonna be a
while I want to know where the universe thing is if that means online or if
that's because of all the characters in it I think it's gonna have all the
different games in it be in another galaxy thank you dark Tetsuya Super
Mario crossover that's what I was thinking of alright dark soccer what do
you got for us stuff and this is for Marvel vs. Capcom actually which is some
pretty cool stuff I'd like to say four new characters have been confirmed at
comic-con we have her Chun Li yeah I like Chun Li I'm like that hater over
there hater dr. doom because all must fall before doom the Super Scroll I have
to mention real quick I saw a license a custom license plate the other day that
said I am doom that's cool okay super scroll who is a newbie in the versus
whole deal and he's I guess we're gonna have all the powers of the Fantastic
Four and Trish mmm Trish and in the teaser trailer there was the outline of
the beautiful Joe so pretty cool Trish ah is leathery tasty didn't they also
announce the my jumping ahead I'm sorry what the dog from Okami or did I think
yeah I saw you is good yeah it's awesome I said that right yeah yeah good times
all right um yeah that's and also Thor yeah so I guess there's a lot of
characters they're showing mm-hmm good times look you what he got for us this
is kind of funny apparently South Peak this is like the lawsuit that really no
one would care about South Peak is suing Majesco over my baby three so when you
over my baby apparently who that is my baby mama South Peak games that is
taking a legal action against Majesco specifically regarding the right to
publishing my baby titles in the United States this was spurred by an
announcement last month I guess that Majesco would publish my baby three and
friends an action South Peak claims Majesco wasn't legally allowed to take
for its part a South Peak issued this statement on the impeding litigation
we're exceptionally proud of our success in making the my baby franchise really
in North America our innovative sales marketing PR strategies brought my baby
to a huge audience and built no sense of shame built a loyal fan base for future
products oh wow where okay South Beach continues to hold the rights to
subsequent my baby games and we intend to vigorously protect those rights
additionally we've confirmed that while South Peak claims a contractual right to
publish subsequent my baby games in the u.s.
noblest owns the my baby IP so it's up to I guess noblest to decide I guess who
publishes what and yeah so basically they're just complaining about that but
I don't know I think it's dumb honestly I know that my baby games sell somewhat
because people people like their sim games and little girls love this stuff
but I mean honestly we're talking like these games sell maybe maybe 200,000
units I mean those are like I've judgment numbers there I mean to give
you an example how how much these fail so I don't know I'm surprised that they
wouldn't be suing like for say babysitting mama or something like that
I'm surprised these games are such a big fucking deal in the first place you'd be
surprised like imagine games they're terrible they have so many that come out
they sell and even like littlest pet shop which I hate you EA and you're
fucking three versions of the game they got to put out each year those sell well
too it's just weird all right well this is also kind of weird but cool I guess
that it was considered but it didn't happen this is running on a website I've
not heard of these guys before but gamer annex.com was running this story and it
kind of caught wind and ended up on a lot of game blogs this week and it was a
comment that Rahul sued the voodoo PC founder and he's also the current CTO of
gaming at Hila Packard he actually revealed a couple months ago that there
was a secret project or an interesting one or a quiet one nonetheless at
Microsoft it would have allowed PC gamers to actually match up with console
players so it wouldn't just be like Final Fantasy 11 wouldn't be the only
game they'll be cross it is not the only game what else is cross platform shadow
run was cross platform right okay and also I believe there was another
strategy game that was man I don't remember which one it was there was I
want to see minesweeper was a kingdom under fire or something like that it was
some sort of game similar that that was cross-platform by no shadow run was well
they were testing Gears of War and unreal tournament but it didn't end up
happening here's why I've heard from reliable this is a quote from our whole
suit I've heard from reliable sources that during the development they brought
together the best console gamers to play mediocre PC gamers at the same game and
guess what happened they pitted console gamers with their console controller
against PC gamers with their keyboard and mouse the console players got
destroyed every time so much so that it would be embarrassing to the Xbox team
in general had Microsoft launched this initiative I know there's a little bit
of that that sounds fanboy to me especially knowing that these other
games are out there what what are you coughing about over there when we played
Left 4 Dead online together on our PCs and I found out that you were playing
with the Xbox controller I was giving you side-eye for that reason why I was
mouse mouse and keyboard is superior and now this is I was is the story I tell
you if they had cross-platform playing Grand Theft Auto I would eat up any PC
player anybody out there I would destroy them but that's not a first-person
shooter and I think it doesn't matter it still has first-person shooter kind of
controls I would destroy them all of them I don't give a shit if you're using
a tomato to control the game I will destroy you feel like there's this whole
kind of like fanboy war about keyboard and mouse versus Xbox 360 controllers
that is continuing to be perpetuated on this very program all they need to do is
just offer keyboard mouse support for these games on the Xbox oh wait but then
they wouldn't be able to sell $60 controllers I guess but I mean this way
it wouldn't be that damn hard there's USB ports I mean would it be really
difficult to I don't know map keys in a game or something you can't work well
you can mouse here's the funny thing you can plug in a keyboard I used to use a
keyboard on fancy 11 for certain games but in I guess if you know by certain
accessories there's ways that kind of shoehorn it in there but why they don't
offer it as an actual solution for you know say Call of Duty and stuff like
that is beyond me because I think that'd be a great idea but then again they
wouldn't be able to sell accessories like they do I don't really think it's a
big deal because most people probably buy a controller anyways they're not
going to just use strictly keyboard mouse for everything but it'd be kind of
cool and I wonder if they could actually do that like have support for that I'm
trying to look at some of our comments in our chat room chat that orders on
show you a calm legend is aku is saying Loki prepare for an ass-whooping with an
eight-year-old logitech mouse I think but unfortunately you can't I mean you
can't with you can't with Grantham auto because it's not a wall obviously
because it's not crashed no cross-platform and especially if it's on
360 there's nothing cross-platform anymore that's too bad bonds 006 in our
chat says I will die with a keyboard in my hands I've tried playing keyboard
mouse I just I don't don't like it I you have to play team fortress 2 with it
like you can't use a controller in team fortress 2 and it's probably part of the
reason I'm forced to play a medic because you don't really have to aim
very well you should lay on the 360 I guess I could but then I'd have to buy
the game again I already bought it on Steam I remember when Left 4 Dead 2 came
out last November and there was a lot of drama on a lot of the major blogs like
joystick and Kotaku who played the 360 version of the game and they gave it
like mediocre reviews saying it was too hard and then the sites that reviewed it
on PC said it was fine and I guess the people played it on Xbox 360 just
couldn't they just kept getting wiped out so I think you know the game was
developed for both platforms but the keyboard mouse people just had an
advantage I don't know keep fanning those flames yeah and it's like why did
you give that game a seven it all came down to the controller according to the
reviewers again I hate to keep going back to this and it's not a first-person
shooter but Final Fantasy 11 you could play with the controller in that game
and Jamie didn't she did quite well with it I mean you have to set up your
macros in advance but you can do it but I I would I had the triggers on top and
I would just cycle through my macro see my trigger buttons mm-hmm and Rob Rob
saw me do it mm-hmm the complete edition was like five bucks on Steam this week I
saw that it was a part of me that just just kind of wanted to play it for a
month really it really was gonna come down to if you want to do games that are
cross-platform like that and you want to have everybody on come the same page you
make the controls more console friendly I guess because that's what they're
doing with DC universes they're making the stuff kind of translate over you
know it the controls are simple as it is and so it translates over well to the
actual controller I I was you know it's funny and I don't know if I should be
repeating this but I was told that the three that the part of the reason why
the games are not cross-server at this time is because it played so much
differently on the PC versus the PlayStation 3 and that one was having an
advantage over the other and I wonder if it comes down to this whole same issue
it's the PlayStation controller versus keyboard mouse could be now see I'll
play Warcraft with a keyboard mouse I couldn't play that with a controller I
think I don't you think you can play that with a controller I don't know but
be weird well like see like for example when I played PC games I use an Xbox
360 controller a lot of times you know Grand Theft Auto and Crysis I played
with PC or with a 360 controller it worked great for me I never had any
problems getting killed I don't want to keep on with this debate I want to hear
what our folks have to say in the mailbag but one more story from Dark
Sakura about another MMO right yeah for Phantasy Star Universe they're getting a
pretty big update there is going to be the ambition of the illuminous expansion
which is a free download and I paid $15 for abortion of the illuminous like two
years ago bastards the Guardians advanced content content is an automated
update for the subscribers with new missions weapons items customization
system and overhaul the games class classes and skills and guardians will
require ambition of the illuminous to work so that's why it's free pretty much
and I guess they're basically taking into account all of the problems that
people had with Phantasy Star Universe that you know all the stuff they took
away from online that made it so much more fun I do think PSO was more fun you
think it's worth revisiting maybe hmm I don't know that I want to play it on the
360 maybe to look at for like a day yeah and they shut down the servers to all
the other formats didn't they think it's only on 360 now but they offered some
support for free servers hmm all right well let's get into the mailbag every
week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orange launch radio.com we pick a few
of our favorites and make dark soccer read them for you guys live on our
program mailbag at orange lounge radio.com okay this is from rubber buff the
first one it I'm not going to fully review the puzzle agent game as it's
much like professor Layton it's on steam by telltale games who say my max
episodes sold well let's say it's a game where you are in a town with OCD about
puzzles there's a very little point-and-click where you play trading
games to advance is mostly all dialogue and puzzles I'm also playing the game
la-di-da and suddenly the game ends at what is typically the middle of the
story I'm not upset about the game being too short I'm mad because the game was
not listed as episodic either that or I completely missed it a game like this is
typically $5 but they have a single illustrator so perhaps that bumped the
game up to $10 I'm also into Xbox live arcade game limbo the game reminds me a
lot of out of this world that's because you were alone and the world feels
completely alien despite the familiar setting of a forest if sky remembers I
made a little big planet level in the same style called UFO story and then
they came it was gray silhouettes foggy and add strange lighting effects limbo
even had a tire swing at the beginning of the game I'm taking no credit though
it had to be coincidence plus my little big planet level is nowhere near as good
as limbo in fact it gets tedious although I'm very proud of the spinning
boss at the end that foggy gray noir setting is nothing new in games by the
way it took me a good 80 hours to make that little big planet level a little
bit construction is not for the dabbler a somewhat okay level takes 80 hours I
wonder what a good or great level to ice I do remember that level and when I read
the email earlier this week I actually was like oh yeah it kind of did have
that same kind of look and feel to it it's kind of funny I I totally remember
what you talk about Robert but he says I'm going to Disney World again
probably bring me back some pins jerk I want to go to Disney World pins can I go
to Disney World Rob and I trade pins last one is from Troy hey olr Troy again
have you guys seen the new Halo Reach Forge mode I don't know how big of the
FPS fans you guys are but if you like Halo the new Forge is like a little big
planet for Halo also I went on a super stardust HD week and hopefully made it
pretty high on the ranking list for the big battle also people who have the
games are listening really should join the big battle I know I was bored of
video games so this came up and now I think I left competitive gaming again
that's it oh well I'm sure the folks that put that all together will be very
nice to hear that yeah very happy to hear that okay let's move on
angst this is the part of the show where we get out our angst it's called the F
use of the week
okay the first one would be me witness a few to the hole in my hand because okay
it was fine with this just the stitches cuz it would pull a little bit and it
was alright but now it's like my hand is a lot more sore than it was last week
since the stitches came out especially with that hole that now I have to do
extra stuff to keep it closed and worth thick bandages on my palm it just makes
my hand hurt a whole lot more and the sad thing with that is that typing on my
keyboard hurts a lot and like I'll message people a little bit but like
using my mouse hurts too but if I'm doing the two of them together then it
really hurts and that's actually made it hard for me to play Star Trek online so
I haven't been doing all the gaming haven't been really doing that much
chatting online or anything it's just it's just really sore it's actually the
whole the weird problem about it is that even though it's sore up at the top of
my palm the back of my hand is really sore too and I think it's where the
bruise was left over from where they did the blood drain so I'm just sore and it
makes me a grumpy grumpy grumpy girl like grumpier than usual that's really
grumpy alright you need some more vitamin B no I don't need more vitamin B
I need ice cream look I want ice cream I don't work
tomorrow just saying Loki um f you to whoever was causing some crime today on
greenback lane they actually have the whole street blocked off with again tape
it was ridiculous so I had to go way around it and I just like that and bad
drivers people stop being stupid like just in general like I'm not talking
listeners of the show clearly or not stupid because you're listening to this
show but just like the people out there instead of listening to the show that
are out there on greenback Avenue shooting each other stop being stupid
seriously serious all right let's see my f you of the week I'm gonna give an F
you to Apple I know Loki's in heaven right now but I think it's total
bullshit that they release this OS that screws up my old phone forcing me to get
a new phone but the new phone is not available anywhere bullshit I'm actually
contemplating getting a different phone right now because I'm thinking like I
need the iPad who does everything the phone does but then I'm still I know I'm
still biting the hand that I want to protest and I'm just a hypocrite and
blah blah blah blah but let's face it the iPhone is now kind of a gaming
platform there's a lot of missing out on if I don't have one slices pop what are
your F use of the week F you to the month of July I'm usually endeared to
this month because it's my birthday month but a lot of people that I follow
on live journal that I've been reading for years have been having to deal with
sudden deaths of like family members and their partners and I have a friend who
had to have ankle surgery due to complications from his ankle surgery he
now has pneumonia figure that one out so yeah it's been a really hard month for a
lot of people that I care about online so that just sucks that I can't really
be there for them because they live far away if you had a distance and people
that are far away that you can't like be there for yeah I get that sucks all
right I have another one quickly my brother's crazy F you to his brain
disease mine too but in a whole different way you know holy he's a he's
a special kind of crazy but we won't get into that on this episode of Ricky
lake alright Loki is some gaming news and then we'll get to the skype line at
1877 game olr Loki yes not to be outdone by Google YouTube also has an Easter egg
on it that allows you to play a game apparently if you go to Google or not
Google YouTube it's owned by Google now so it doesn't matter if you go to
youtube.com and pull up any video whatever hold down the left arrow on
your keyboard and after a few seconds you should be able to play the game
snake over the top I got a sneak man I used to love snake on the old cell phones
fun fun times that's what I need to do I'm gonna go trade in my iPhone and go
get me like one of those like old ass Nokia phones that have snake on it good
times it does still work you can probably get snake for iPhone it's not
the same it's not the same as much as I appreciate why we are one of the
listeners of the show and I do I do think snake 360 is a good game it's just
not the same as playing it on the old school cell phone you know what I mean
you're right one other story for you guys then we're gonna get to the
skyline 877 game olr yada yada this is about Starcraft 2 this is Starcraft 2
story they're saying the launch for this is going to be big big huge gigantic
because you know lots of stores are doing the midnight releases of course
this game's been what like 10 years in the making blizzard is not saying how
many copies of the game has been pre-ordered because they don't get into
that but they are saying that it's it's gonna be big there's these midnight
launch events everywhere it's a $60 game it's number one and number two on Amazon
right now because obviously there's a regular and collector's edition it's
been in the top 100 best-selling games for over three months Walmart staying
open late GameStops Best Buys and so forth they're the this story that I'm
reading from the Orange County Register which is not a video game site
specifically it's more of a blizzard obviously is in Anaheim which is kind of
Orange County they are talking about this 18 year old who apparently plans to
wait 72 hours in line for Starcraft 2 when asked why he said it's really hard
to explain I don't know it's just something I'm crazy enough to enjoy I
guess if people can stand in line for Twilight for that long I guess they can
do it for Starcraft 2 anyhow World of Warcraft Wrath of the Lich King sold 2.8
million copies when it came out in the first 24 hours they think this could
possibly top it one thing though that is not going to help sell the game is
reviews there will be no reviews of Starcraft 2 Wings of Liberty before it
launches on Tuesday the press will be reviewing the game when everybody else
does I guess the publisher feels that the battle net service and the online
features is so essential to the game that opening them up early when it's not
really ready to go for the press to review it could be detrimental to the
game yeah because people will pirate it like they've already know the copies
have already come out but you can't play it until the battle that servers are up
there's gonna be a day one patch for the game in order to give the developer
quote a little bit more time to sort of get their ducks in a row that's
basically telling me the game's not really totally ready and it comes out Oh
Tuesday so kind of what Alan was saying earlier why don't you just wait three
months for them to just actually get the game working there's a lot of pressure
on it Blizzard right now because if this game is fails on launch day it's gonna
be a lot of shit for it I will say this I don't know if I can stand to wait
three months but I am gonna wait for the reviews of the game I think that's pretty
bold of Blizzard to say yeah we're not gonna send out our game for review it'll
sell without it yeah I'm a little confused because I know that a lot of
the major review sites to get their copy two weeks early but they're just not
allowed to publish the story until release date in which case all the sites
try to scoop each other so does this mean that they're not getting the game
at all I don't know they're not really saying for sure but they can't play it
even if they have it they can't play it well and a lot of times they can do some
really shady shit with those embargoes too because a lot of times you can break
the embargo if you gave the game a 90% or better like that shit really happens
out there and it's kind of sick like and that's why you know we're here about
really supporting the independent media because we don't have to really play by
those rules granted we don't get the early copies of the games because of it
but you know just keep in mind if this site got a world exclusive review and
it's like the first to run with it if that review is an a or something of the
equivalent a question it you should question it because they could very well
be doing it especially if it's a no-name site trying to get the additional
traffic they could be doing it just to get the traffic kind of sad
toa gak in our chair him says code your damn games on time or admit failure damn
these day one patches I don't think the game is going to be like terrible but
it's going to be interesting to see if the servers can handle at day one it's
gonna be a big demand big big demand the internet will come to a screeching halt
this week chaos all right let's open up the Skype line at 1 877 game olr our
username on Skype is orange lounge radio that's all one word please if you were
using Skype for the first time make sure you give echo one two three a call on
Skype or I think they actually build it in there in there now it's like make a
test call and you can easily hear if your sound settings are okay because
when we pick up and no one's there it's a little bit frustrating all right while
we wait for some calls to come in do we have any last-minute stories in house I
do not looky I do but I'll have to look them up I thought yes I'm ready to go
you're too busy shopping I am shopping well luckily we're getting a call you're
being saved by a phone call hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this hey it's
wrong everyone hey Rama you're the master of zerg rushing our phones what's
up the first thing I want to bring up is
what you said about the guy that was online for 72 hours for Starcraft 2 he's
standing in line yes I think that you know that I was on the line for the week
and I was out there for you about a day and a half there were people out there my
older brother was out there no my younger brother that this is Thursday
for okay Wow by the way don't adjust your sound Rama is cutting in and out
we're not sure why I don't know if it's your speakers or mate they might buy and
some make this quick and just get going for Torrance okay go ahead I'm not
running in porn torrents I'm not Loki all right I don't want my porn I
downloaded off Houston okay anyway Rama yes you were you were in line just as
long okay I get it but you're also black Luigi you have to be out there I mean
like it's not a Nintendo party without black Luigi I suppose so but I just say
you can't go out for something like that cuz we've all done this I mean you guys
got it didn't get on the line for the week she was out there interviewing
people handing out stuff you know because it was total promotion for our
show cuz you know we can't afford million dollar ads no I mean we got into
it extra for waited in the line he was but I waited in line whether we keep in
mind to this is important if we hadn't waited in line we wouldn't have got one
there's gonna be plenty of Starcraft 2 available day one it's not gonna sell
out like crazy you're gonna be able to find it but you know if software is a
lot easier to make than hardware right
true true but still I'm just saying you shouldn't get a hard time I'm not giving
him that hard a time I'm just kind of I just putting that in the same category
is waiting for Twilight that's that's okay that's I guess tomato all right
well what else is on your mind before we let you go Rama
earlier in the show about that but the law that California is trying to pass
many of the states are jumping on the bandwagon mm-hmm passes is not gonna do
a lick of damage I've seen plenty of time at best by people that aren't 17
buying emory games it pops up on the registered check ID they use it to keep
entered bypass to keep going yeah but now it's gonna be illegal and those
people could be personally responsible if they do that so that behavior might
change pretty soon it depends on me I don't think it's going to change unless
saying the ruling that at the source quite doing this is going to get fined
for it you know what I'm saying let's try this way I bet you can agree with
this Rama if a 16 year old wants to get a dirty game that 16 year old will get
the dirty game lobby damned right pretty much then there you have it so it's up
to the parents to make sure that the 16 year olds don't get the games you don't
want them playing Rama I better let you go so we can get some more calls and you
can see what's up with your connection problem but thanks so much for your call
as always you have a good one take care amiga 777 in our chat rooms asking
what's black Luigi that's what we call Rama cuz he's black and he cosplays as
Luigi and he always seems to get on camera whenever you know he's at one of
these Nintendo events like when he on CNN or something for the Wii event I
don't know but he's black Luigi alright let's take some more calls at 1 8 7 7
game olr our username on skype is orange lounge radio she gets some time time to
round up some stories Loki yeah well too bad because we got another call coming
in I didn't want to see all right then hi you're on orange launch radio who's
this this is new Steve misty well how are you we haven't heard from you in a
while I'm doing pretty good I was thinking that to run the being in the
show where you where you're basically like we've had a shit ton of guests lately yes we haven't but I
thought I'd like to confirm one that's gonna be on the show on August 8th who
would that be that would be me oh you're coming back huh
yep I decided to suck it up and fly oh god it's gonna be a bunch of women here
let's I really hope I really hope I really hope that's not the weekend that
Nellie has the baby because then Loki won't be here and I'll be surrounded by
women no I'm just I'm I'm messing around it'll be okay well that's great are you
now I get asked this question because um I don't know if we talked about it last
time you were here but you do not like to fly and last time you came out here
you took Greyhound out here and a little bit of the train too I think what are
you doing this time are you are I thought there was a train involved
somehow so what are you doing this time are you doing the but you know pushing
the numbers won't do anything right I won't suddenly speak in Spanish for
English press one para espanol maki numero dos all right no uh so so what
are you doing this time are you doing the the Greyhound thing again what I'm
going to get out there is I'm flying Southwest from St. Louis to LA taking
Amtrak overnight from LA to Sacramento and then then on the way back home I'm
taking the bus well Southwest is basically a Greyhound bus with wings so
I enjoy that it'll be fine now have you ever flown before like ever no I'll give
you a tip I want to be on the damn show if you're if you're anxious about it
Misty and it makes you nervous just take like half a Tylenol PM right before you
get on the flight and then you'll fall right asleep and it'll it'll help the
anxiety not that I advocate like taking meds and drugs and stuff but you know
and again if I don't know like if you I'm not your doctor so you might want to
ask somebody because I don't know what other medications you take and I hate to
you know have you mix I don't know what else you take and Tylenol may not mix
but just take a sleep aid that's approved by your doctor and you know
that that might help with the pain or the not the pain but the anxiety because
I've had friends that have to do that they get really anxious especially if
there's gonna be turbulence or anything which flying to LA you I think you get
to dodge the Rockies a little bit I don't think you'll fly right over them
and that's where the worst turbulence is but it'll be fine I fly all the time
it's fine in fact you know what you probably saw on the news not that far
here from Sacramento there's a horrible Greyhound bus accident and I would have
been extremely sad if Misty had been on that bus so I think you'll be alright
with flying. I didn't read that yet but keep in mind my computer's back I'm limited to
doing shit on my iPod right now hmm well you're gonna be you're gonna be just
fine with that flight. I do not drink and you know that all right all right I'll let you go so
you can go beat up some chatters with your fist so we'll see and you can yell
at them in person when you're here in a couple weeks so we'll see you then all
right take care. Misty's gonna be on the show. I had to make sure that I was
actually gonna be here cuz I was worried for me that she was only here for the
weekend what's that say um she's gonna be on the 8th I think that's the night
after showgirls it is the night after showgirls so I'll be but I'll be back in
town on the 8th because I usually come so I'll be here she's here during the
week I guess so we'll have to all get Indian food or something I don't know
cuz she foods what are we gonna do with Misty what do you do a Misty for like
four days I was thinking going to Dave and Buster's and going to our big old
land maybe and let's go order a dumpster the little ghetto arcade over there
with Para Para is it'd be fun cuz she really wants to play Para Para be fun
let's go to another call hi you're on orange lounge radio for English press
one para espanol no I'm kidding hi who's this hey this is excellent hi x-link
what's on your mind hey actually I want to call back everything's first off
about the law I'm I lived here in Florida which is probably supposedly be
one of the states which I really don't think it's gonna pass personally like
Rama said I really think that it's gonna go through a lot of loopholes before
anything gets passed look through a lot of these different states a lot of the
companies too I noticing now are trying to do things so they won't get in
trouble it god forbid it's something like this would pass recently I bought
something I bought a computer game from Target the file collection and I was
surprised that I got ID for it which took me by surprise because the first
time ever buying a game from say like Target or someplace like that where I
actually got carded for the game for being mature so it was very shocking to
say the least but it was very cool though because at least it shows that
they're trying to take the appropriate steps to make sure something does
happen but you but I agree with you there is a bad point they're making all
these steps to block these mature rate games but a lot of times with these are
a movies they're not doing anything it's like oh they're worth their parents so
it has to be okay so you know but it's like almost like a double standard in a
way I'll look at it excellent how do you have time to play Fallout you play just
as much Wow as I do and I don't have time for other video games like how do
you do it now I got it mostly for the collection now because I have three
already so I said well if I got three I might look at one and two and tactics to
put in with it because I had one or two before a long time ago before
unfortunately my mom's place which had all my games and was arson so I lost a
lot of games that I had that's terrible oh man well sorry to hear it but now
glad you're it's like building the second frontier I like I can't believe
you're sitting there bashing it it was actually it wasn't great it wasn't the
best but it would the storyline was alright and besides you can play some
like going around game I love how you're lowering the bar as you're reviewing it
well wasn't that good when that you know it's you know it's there's always one at
every party huh you know it's all good I won't judge you for it
all right that it you got something else all right that's pretty much about it
all right well thank you as always X link you have a wonderful week always
YouTube we'll try to farm Cara tonight okay oh sounds like fun tell the guild
bye just bye bye all right that's gonna do it for the skype line tonight thank
you guys so much for your phone calls here at orange lounge radio we
appreciate it if you didn't get through why don't you leave us a voicemail on
the skype line or of course you know I send us an email mailbag at orange
lounge reader calm there's Twitter's there's lots of ways to get through to
the show so that's it we're gonna wrap up no last-minute stories right now I'm
just kidding what is a look you got for last minute stories dead rising to case
zero be coming out on Xbox live arcade August 31st of course it'll be kind of a
prequel or in-between sequel for the dead rising series it takes place
between dead rising a one and two and also you'll be able to kind of level up
your character and stuff that you earn in that game will also transfer over to
dead rising to the best thing about it though it will only cost you five
dollars so that is awesome for what may be considered I've seen anything on
arcade for five dollars a long time exactly see Netflix is apparently going
diskless by October so they're gonna eventually have an app or you may say
that's probably when the exclusivity contract ran out for having the in-dash
stuff Rockman 3's got some more tracks announced for it everybody wants to rule
the world by tears for fears Rock Lobster by the b-52s awesome foolin by
Def Leppard beautiful people by Marilyn Manson hey man nice shot by filter cold
as ice by foreigner and then also dance central has three songs announced for
drop it like it's hot by Snoop Dogg push it by salt and pepper and bust a move by
young MC that's it do you think Rock Lobster might sound something like this
wait one sit down I want to sing a little song that kept me going when I
had troubles
we were at the beach everybody had matching towels somebody
went under a dock and there they saw a rock but it wasn't a rock it was a rock
lobster that's what's it sound like at my house
that's bad back not that all right I'm over it all right well that's gonna do
it for last minute stories tonight then let's go around no no bird is the word
I'm not going there again but surely you've heard I already put that in as a
cage match okay so I almost want to play it but I'm not gonna I promise all right
quick let's end the show before I play it we're gonna go around everybody get
everybody's final thoughts but not before I thank salacious pop for joining
us tonight here in studio hope you had a fun time I did show as always how it now
it's because you sometimes you listen and you comment in chat and sometimes
you hear how is the show different between the two I don't know behind the
scenes is just a different perspective I guess I'm a lot less nervous this time
than I was the first two times it's my third time on the show you do well the
thing is he's really funny you guys like he makes a lot of really funny chat
comments that's why I read him like I'm not doing like he gets more chat
comments and because like you know he's my boyfriend or whatever but he actually
says a lot of funny stuff and you know so we like getting more of that funny
stuff here on the show so thank you go home and write some jokes and we're
gonna do like a last comic standing with you and drew Nami okay I think I got the
an idea for my next little animated movie from this episode but did you yeah
I did the really sort of foul world of Warcraft was awesome so yeah it was
awesome sounds like fun I'm a little worried as to what that's going to sound
like but we'll see all right do you have a final thought for us tonight video
games are not the same as tobacco and alcohol so that law is stupid and it's
no on that law no on that law thumbs down too bad we don't get to vote on it
f-minus dislike this post yes Loki your final thought tonight that law sucks but
