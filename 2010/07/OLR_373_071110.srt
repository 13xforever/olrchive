1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,520
Tonight, July 11th, 2010, could a cell phone be built into the 3DS?

2
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:24,760
A trial date is set for Infinity Ward vs Activision, and Microsoft teams up with Fast Food to promote

3
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,760
a Kinect game.

4
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,080
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

5
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,080
Radio.

6
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,880
It is the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,760
Thanks so much for tuning in to us tonight.

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,360
We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, at All Games Radio,

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,760
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, www.allgames.com.

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,200
We're going to talk about video games, gaming culture, gamer lifestyle.

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,200
My name is Rob Roberts.

12
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,080
I'll be joining you over the next few hours.

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,800
Joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.

14
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,920
How you doing, Jamie Sommers?

15
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,200
Now I noticed, as we promised two weeks ago, because we didn't have a show because of the

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,800
4th of July, you did not come in here as Inspector Gadget tonight.

17
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,960
Is everything okay with the finger?

18
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,800
My surgery got delayed to Tuesday because of a scheduling issue.

19
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,520
Well, good for us though, that way you're not high.

20
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,120
You shouldn't ship in the bionic parts.

21
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:36,040
No, basically, the thing is that my visit with my last surgeon was set up as my consultation.

22
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,840
He was just going to refer me into surgery, except he didn't put surgery in the thing.

23
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,840
Uh oh.

24
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,480
I've already filled out all my FMLA and everything, so my new doctor's just like, uh, we'll go

25
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:54,040
ahead and write your leave starting Friday, which is what it was supposed to have been.

26
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,840
And then I go in Tuesday at 2 o'clock Pacific to have my hand flayed.

27
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,840
So now-

28
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,120
And I think they're going to put me under this time.

29
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,160
Oh, you don't get to watch!

30
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,160
How sad.

31
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,920
Well, the only logic, the only reason I think this is because they're telling me not to

32
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,360
eat beforehand, so usually that's a sign that they're going to clunk out.

33
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,800
Maybe they'll just numb a lot of parts, like you won't be able to feel the whole left half

34
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
of your body for a little while.

35
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,680
Well, see, that's what happened last time is that they damned off my arm so that there'd

36
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,680
be no blood in my hand.

37
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,440
Well, now, here's what I want to know, because obviously we are a video game show, how does

38
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,160
this affect your gaming ability?

39
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,480
Are you going to be not able to play Star Trek Online anymore, or what happens?

40
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,240
Well, last time I had this done, two days later, I was up all night playing Blue Dragon.

41
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,280
Were you just kind of using one hand?

42
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,280
For the most part, I mean, because really it was a lot of running around and, you know,

43
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,000
and I was actually using, I had the controller in my lap when I wasn't, you know, walking

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,400
and was pushing the button with a finger.

45
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,760
A lot of those RPGs, like Final Fantasy, Blue Dragon, and so forth, really lend themselves

46
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,760
easy to like only having one hand, because it's like, A, attack, A, target creature,

47
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,880
A, A, A, A, over and over, you know?

48
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,400
You remember that single-handed PlayStation controller, the RPG controller?

49
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Oh, vaguely, yes.

50
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,600
I think I've got one somewhere.

51
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Vaguely.

52
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Yeah.

53
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
They weren't very popular, I don't think.

54
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Maybe, well, he's not here.

55
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,840
I think we just were given one or something.

56
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,840
Nice.

57
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,080
Single-hand control schemes are always nice.

58
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,080
Remember Earthbound?

59
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
Mm.

60
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,760
All right, we got a lot of other voices I haven't even introduced yet.

61
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,760
What, huh?

62
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,760
I do have to, well, I'll talk about it later.

63
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,760
All right.

64
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,960
Say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki, as well, who's drinking a shake.

65
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,440
It was hot outside.

66
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,680
I didn't mean to inconvenience you, I'm sorry.

67
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,080
No, it was, it's hot outside, so it was the coldest thing I could think of.

68
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,960
It's just gonna make me really thirsty later.

69
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,960
Is it just- The irony.

70
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,780
Is it funny when you're hearing about this East Coast heatwave and they're like, OMG,

71
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,720
it's 100 degrees, and I'm like, that's like Wednesday here.

72
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,120
My friend in Canada was posting about it being, I think, 80.

73
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,120
She gave it to me in Celsius.

74
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,740
Well, if it's 80 degrees Celsius, I don't want to be over there.

75
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,120
That's very hot, actually, isn't that like 180 degrees?

76
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,920
All right, anyway, forget it.

77
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,360
Here's the thing, is that, obviously, I'm joking a little bit, because I know the East

78
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,560
Coast isn't really built to handle the heat.

79
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,360
Here, everything's got air conditioning.

80
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,040
You don't have a house without central air.

81
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,940
That's unheard of, so I know it kind of sucked for them, but it does make me laugh when I

82
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,340
hear like, 100 degrees, panic, panic, panic, because I'm like, wake me when it's 113.

83
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,340
But then you drive to the bay.

84
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,480
I spent the weekend in the bay area.

85
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,200
You drive to the bay area, it's like cold and windy still.

86
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,680
It's crazy.

87
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,640
I had friends come up this weekend, and they were from Santa Cruz, and they said, yeah,

88
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,360
it's like a high of 71, and I'm like, that'd be nice.

89
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,840
All right, we're also going to introduce, he's back this week.

90
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,400
I don't know what the heck's going on here, but he's here two weeks in a row-ish, because

91
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,360
we didn't really do a show last week, but say hello to intern Drew Nami is here tonight.

92
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,640
Hi, guys, just trying to make it a habit again.

93
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
I see.

94
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,720
You're, you're, see, I know what you're trying to do.

95
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,960
You're trying to, you're trying to squeeze into Loki's chair when he's out on paternity

96
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
leave.

97
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,740
That's what you're trying to do, I think.

98
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't think I don't know what you're up to.

99
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,200
I know nothing, nothing.

100
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Loki is irreplaceable.

101
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,520
I may not be, I don't know.

102
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,720
He may not even, yeah, knowing him, he won't even be gone.

103
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,480
He'll be like, yeah, wife just had the baby this morning, but I'm here.

104
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,760
Well, I remember when he was the intern, he was on the floor, and he didn't get pizza.

105
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,240
All right, look.

106
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,600
All right, well, and, and how have you been?

107
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
How's life been treating you?

108
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,920
How was the Fourth of July for you?

109
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:40,060
Um, just mostly sat and listened to the fireworks go off, watched a couple of fireworks displays

110
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,200
in WoW and played some Left 4 Dead.

111
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,000
Watched fireworks in WoW, probably better than the ones I spent $50 on, that's for sure.

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,360
You used to watch the fireworks in Animal Crossing.

113
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,120
I miss the fireworks from Final Fantasy 11.

114
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,120
Really?

115
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
Remember that?

116
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,120
Oh, that's right.

117
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,120
Oh my gosh.

118
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,000
A lot of MMOs do that stuff.

119
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Good times.

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Good times.

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,560
All right, uh, yeah, I spent $50 on safe and sane fireworks, which is all we're allowed

122
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
in this area.

123
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,560
So that lasted about like, what, five minutes?

124
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,560
Oh, wait.

125
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,720
I spent $50 on safe and sane fireworks, and I just get to hear the idiots down the street

126
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,320
shooting off bottle rockets.

127
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320
Maybe about 20 minutes.

128
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,440
Yeah, you gotta love all the signs everywhere, zero tolerance on illegal fireworks, and the

129
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,440
neighbors all over the place.

130
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,320
We won't tolerate it, but we also won't do anything about it.

131
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,320
But it was, it was fine.

132
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,320
It was fine.

133
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,320
I had a, I had a good night, so.

134
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
It was good.

135
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,720
I hope all of you had a good Fourth of July as well, unless you're overseas, and maybe

136
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,040
you didn't, didn't really celebrate the Fourth, but I hope you had a good week nonetheless.

137
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,880
We're back here with Orange Lawns Radio after our week off.

138
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,680
Um, shezrose in our chat room, chat.orangelawnsradio.com, saying, wow, $50?

139
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,680
What the fuck?

140
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,680
God damn.

141
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,680
That is the exact quote, actually.

142
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
What the fuck?

143
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,680
God damn.

144
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,680
Uh, here's the thing, though.

145
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,080
A lot of charities set up booths here.

146
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,560
So I think that jacks up the price a little bit, but that's okay.

147
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
Like I-

148
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
Screw them.

149
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,560
I don't care.

150
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,560
I'm not buying their crap.

151
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,120
I, I, yes, it was $50, but it went to a preschool, because I don't know about you guys, but I

152
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:10,000
check first what charity it is, because I, there are some charities out there that get

153
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,840
involved in political things, but I'm, I'm not gonna, I don't want to open that can of

154
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,840
worms.

155
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,040
Well, they, this year they were really obnoxious, because they had all the different stands

156
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,720
set up, and normally that's fine.

157
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,160
You see a lot of stands and whatever.

158
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,520
But this year they had, you know, a few stands, and it was quite a few of them, that went

159
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,640
all out as far as trying to get people to come and buy their stuff.

160
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:39,160
For example, there was a stand on one of the major, you know, cross streets here, and they

161
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,080
had, you know, this giant inflatable barrel that looked like an explosive barrel or something.

162
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,920
They had 50,000 signs that were out there.

163
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,200
They had signs like literally blocks away.

164
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,920
They had people waving signs to go buy their fireworks, and they were offering all sorts

165
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,920
of discounts.

166
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,480
And I was like, no, they suck.

167
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,880
Still not buying them.

168
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,880
Oh, and they had a bounce house.

169
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,880
That's crazy.

170
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,800
That's a lot of all the money that they spent on their advertising.

171
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,840
Not gonna make it up with the fireworks and like, sorry, kids, you don't have to donate

172
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,120
money to the orphan orphanage, but now we actually have to sell the orphanage to pay

173
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
for these fireworks.

174
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:22,460
You do have to wonder about a charity organization that spends all this money on that stuff.

175
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,460
You know, I don't know.

176
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:29,720
I, I, I feel a little more for like the handwritten in crayon on the poster board support our

177
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,720
school.

178
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,920
Like I'm, I'm more about that stuff.

179
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,920
I don't know.

180
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,920
I don't, I don't.

181
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,920
But anyway, very grassroots.

182
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,080
I am very grassroots.

183
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,080
Hello.

184
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
Look at the show.

185
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,000
Been going for eight years and still haven't been bought by, by the man yet.

186
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So well here.

187
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's a great thing though.

188
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Hmm.

189
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,280
Fireworks are not good just for the 4th of July.

190
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,520
You can use them all year round.

191
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,360
We had a legal, we had a legal ones.

192
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,360
Shame on you.

193
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,360
Candles.

194
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,200
You had a party like on the 3rd, right?

195
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
We had a block party.

196
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
I see.

197
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,840
So you did fireworks the night before.

198
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,280
And then I did them the night after and the night after that.

199
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:14,400
I remember one year I bought like 30, $40 worth of fireworks, fireworks, fireworks,

200
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
work, work fireworks.

201
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,120
And I brought them to one of Jamie's house parties.

202
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,080
But because there were so many fireworks here, they never got set off.

203
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,780
So I went home with a box of fireworks.

204
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,880
This is funny how you, you take it year round.

205
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,360
I ended up, I actually ended up using them the next year.

206
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,780
I sat on them for a whole year.

207
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,720
We had real metal sparklers too.

208
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,720
Did you?

209
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,360
And um, those little wizard things that go down the street and um, bottle rockets and.

210
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,760
The groundflowers are awesome.

211
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,240
Uh, going to our chat room yet again, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

212
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,240
Let's see.

213
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,480
Um, Salacious Pop is giving an FYI perhaps.

214
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,000
They could have gotten a lot of it comped since the businesses that donated it could

215
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,960
get rid of overstock that way as a write-off.

216
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,020
Hmm.

217
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,080
So maybe they're just really good about soliciting donations.

218
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,080
I guess that's a good point.

219
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,080
Uh, SSJ100 Matt.

220
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,080
Uh, wait, wait, wait.

221
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,280
They're good at soliciting donations.

222
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,920
Why sell the fireworks anyways?

223
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,960
That's the money donated.

224
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,820
SSJ100 Matt says, Rob, I am the man.

225
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,120
How much for the show?

226
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,360
And also I invited Rob and he didn't respond to it talking about his party that he had

227
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,800
and he called me a dick.

228
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,000
Uh, actually, actually I put myself down as a maybe.

229
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,960
For those that don't know, um, I, I yelled at SSJ100 Matt last week cause he called into

230
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,360
the show saying he was having a fourth of July party and what like classic games should

231
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,360
they play?

232
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,360
And I said, I didn't get an invite.

233
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,360
Keep in mind, I live in California and SSJ100 Matt's in New York city.

234
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,120
So he, he did send me an invite on Facebook and I responded maybe because that's what

235
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,680
you do to all the invites on Facebook.

236
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,960
You put yourself down as a maybe.

237
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,360
It's not like there's going to be any fireworks there anyway.

238
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,960
I usually just say no and then when I show up, it's a surprise.

239
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
Alright.

240
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,440
Uh, and then, uh, one other comment here, uh, where is it?

241
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
Oh my God.

242
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
What?

243
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,440
I thought it was something totally wrong, but it would be hilarious.

244
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,480
All right, but we got to get into gaming weeks after that.

245
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,480
Yes.

246
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,480
Okay.

247
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,720
As like a prank, you know, you set up one of those fireworks stands and you put it's

248
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,000
benefiting Al-Qaeda.

249
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,400
That is not a funny prank.

250
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,200
That's a hilarious prank.

251
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
It's not funny.

252
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,560
It gets you killed, but it's funny.

253
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,520
What about instead of something kind of hot button like that, you do like just this really

254
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:29,320
like obscure charity organization, like trying to launch, um, a horse into space organization.

255
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
Now that's fun.

256
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,120
How about the people that are trying to build a Gundam?

257
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,120
I think they already have.

258
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,120
No, no, no.

259
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,120
Okay.

260
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,120
Not the Japanese guys.

261
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,120
No, no, no.

262
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,880
It's an American group trying to build a Mecca.

263
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,880
Yeah.

264
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,840
They were looking for funding at like Alaska or something like that and they were trying

265
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,320
to build an actual working Mecca at, I donate, I donate to them.

266
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,840
I tell you how you sell your fireworks and this is so simple.

267
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,440
I don't know why it's not been done yet.

268
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
You get strippers.

269
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
Come on.

270
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,740
Seriously, you take you, you take those stupid, you know, charity car washes that they have

271
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,920
out there now and they have them for like, you know, soccer teams and stuff like that.

272
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,240
Well, the same, you know, same time they also have, you know, strippers doing car washes

273
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,640
for different charities and whatnot because they're kind of donating and because people

274
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,480
like seeing strippers in bikinis.

275
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,880
It's a tax write off.

276
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,880
Exactly.

277
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,760
You put them out there in bikinis and sell fireworks.

278
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,100
They will clean out that fireworks stand.

279
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,100
That's true.

280
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,100
Easy.

281
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,100
Think about it.

282
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,840
Who's the stereotypical person that's going out to buy the fireworks?

283
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,800
It's you know, the older brother, men that want to blow things up.

284
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,800
No offense, Jamie.

285
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
I know you want to blow things up too.

286
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,520
I think you'd have fun with strippers.

287
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,680
Strippers love, here's another thing you need to keep in mind.

288
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,200
Strippers love other women.

289
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,400
They'll get way freakier with other women than they will with men.

290
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
Yeah.

291
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Unless you're a gay man.

292
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,280
I know this from experience, sadly.

293
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:58,120
It's the whole, the whole point of threatening unless, unless, I think it has to do with

294
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,120
the level of threat.

295
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,120
I see.

296
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,160
I'm telling you, if you have, you know, you have a stand with the bounce house and you

297
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,600
have a stand with strippers, I'm going with the stripper stand.

298
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,840
How about a stand with strippers and a bounce house?

299
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
That's dangerous.

300
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,840
To who?

301
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,840
All right.

302
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,840
Um, occasionally.

303
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,600
Yeah, but then you'd have to have work, you'd have to be prepared for workman's claim comps

304
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,880
for back strain.

305
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,840
Occasionally here at Orange Launch Radio, we talk about video games.

306
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
They're not very often.

307
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,360
I have a huge rack and I know it hurts, so whatever.

308
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
All right.

309
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,120
Can we please get into discussion about how is your gaming week?

310
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,280
My boobs are epic.

311
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,640
Dark Sakura.

312
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,000
I know, I've seen those bras hanging up to dry in there.

313
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,320
I'm like, oh my God, a hamster could live in there.

314
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,320
All right.

315
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,320
Actually.

316
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,320
What?

317
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,320
They have.

318
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,320
Four hamsters.

319
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,320
All right.

320
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,600
We love you, Dark Sakura.

321
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,080
We love your breasts.

322
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,080
Tell us a little bit.

323
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
I said why?

324
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
How is, how was your gaming week?

325
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,960
You did, you did get to do some games this week, right?

326
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
Yeah.

327
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,120
Um, I played Star Trek Online and that's about it.

328
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,120
Um, well, no.

329
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:10,560
Actually, I think that is all I played with Star Trek Online because I, um, I made captain

330
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,320
and then I took a little break and now, um, I'm trying, I have this goal to reach admiral

331
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,700
by Tuesday morning and then go have my surgery done.

332
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:28,240
So I'm at captain five now and so I have, um, about, I have five more ranks to go and

333
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,220
then you hit 11 and then spend all your points and then you get everything.

334
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,200
And then episode two is going to be out by the end of the month.

335
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,400
So that means we get, you can get more levels.

336
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,740
They're opening up another admiral rank.

337
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,960
And that's not something you have to buy.

338
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,520
It's like a download thing that's doing it automatically.

339
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,520
Oh, cool.

340
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,320
I mean, like a wild patch basically.

341
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
Yeah.

342
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,320
Cool.

343
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,880
Basically what happens with Star Trek Online is that, you know, they, they have their episodes

344
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:57,240
and then they'll do like little mini updates where they'll do like episode 1.5 or something

345
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,540
and give you a few more goodies.

346
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,880
Now the stuff that you, um, actually can buy in the game, like right now they actually

347
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,800
unlocked all of the, um, the pre-order bonuses that you can buy.

348
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,800
So I have everything now.

349
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,760
So you now can have a joint trail if you want to.

350
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,740
And I already paid, actually, I think I already paid about the equivalent anyway to have the

351
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,720
joint trail because I got, um, another, anyway, long story.

352
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:29,360
So, um, I, um, I've just been playing that and I have my, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I played

353
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,360
peggle.

354
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,960
A lot of peggle on my phone.

355
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,960
Good times.

356
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,960
The end.

357
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,800
Any idea what you might play when you're down to one hand?

358
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,160
Well, um.

359
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,960
Video game wise?

360
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
There's always peggle.

361
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,560
Yeah, I could actually play peggle with my phone.

362
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,560
Okay.

363
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,920
This is a good thing about the iPhone though is that I can actually do, like I could, um,

364
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,120
I think I could actually get away with playing as blue, as big, uh, beluga.

365
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,400
You need an RPG.

366
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,520
You know what?

367
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,440
I'll just loan you Final Fantasy 13 this week.

368
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,960
That way you have an RPG to play and you can talk about something besides Star Trek online

369
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
on this program.

370
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
I was going to try to finish.

371
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,960
I knew I forgot to bring something.

372
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,280
I was going to try to finish blue dragon, but there's that too.

373
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,720
Final Fantasy 13 would be great.

374
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,440
I'm really looking forward to playing it.

375
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,440
All right.

376
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:26,000
And, um, other than that, we've been playing the get rid of shit game fun, as you can tell

377
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,120
by the state of this room.

378
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
I don't know.

379
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,120
It seems like look in the closet.

380
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
Okay.

381
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,120
Well yeah, there's a lot less shit in there.

382
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,000
Who's the, who's the cartoony picture of there?

383
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I don't.

384
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,720
That's a picture that's Yara did for, for me of characters.

385
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
Okay.

386
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
They're characters.

387
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,720
I'm like, these aren't people I know.

388
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,720
Are they?

389
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,920
It's a cute picture, but it's okay.

390
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,920
She does good stuff.

391
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,920
Sorry.

392
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,920
Isn't that awesome radio.

393
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,920
We're talking about pictures.

394
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,920
All right.

395
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,680
But I also hung up my, my bathhouse collage.

396
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,680
You did?

397
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,680
Yes I did.

398
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,360
And I made this thing, which I'm about to put on the board.

399
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,360
You can take it.

400
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,000
At least you can take a picture and put it on our website.

401
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Right.

402
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm going to put it on the website.

403
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Yeah.

404
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
All right.

405
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
There you go.

406
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
But um, cause I felt crafty.

407
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
All right.

408
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,920
Let's as in, I've not been working and I've been bored, bored.

409
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,920
So all right.

410
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
Let's move on to Loki.

411
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
How was your gaming week?

412
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:16,200
Um, my game week was interesting, I guess, because, um, I had a lot of different things

413
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:22,120
I played that I haven't really been playing a lot of, um, for example, I went back and

414
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:28,240
dusted off a few music games this week, including DJ Hero, um, went and played some of the new

415
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:36,760
tracks in the party mix thing, including the, was it the Lady Gaga, um, uh, Girls on Film

416
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,080
remix was kind of interesting.

417
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:45,720
Um, I played that and there's some of the other stuff that I haven't played before,

418
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,360
like the other songs, cause I have like all the download content for that.

419
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:55,200
Then played some Rock Band, um, which was fun, lots of songs to choose from there.

420
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,920
Um, tried playing a little bit more on the medium setting cause you know, I, I'm just,

421
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,880
I was so used to like Guitar Freaks and stuff and never really tried experimenting with

422
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,080
playing, um, any of the harder difficulties.

423
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,000
Just have a, you know, I kind of like how Guitar Freaks when they ramped up the difficulty

424
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,980
just had more notes on the three keys instead of, you know, adding, you know, just more

425
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,980
keys to it.

426
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:25,000
I kind of like that a little bit better, but, um, I don't know, it was still fun.

427
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,480
Um, and then other than music games and stuff, I've been playing a lot of Crackdown 2 and

428
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,800
honestly it's not that different from Crackdown 1 except they made leveling up a lot easier.

429
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:46,000
Um, not that it doesn't take as long, but they don't really have gangs this time.

430
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,680
It's just one big old gang that, you know, kind of attacks you everywhere and then at

431
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:55,200
night you get these, like, zombie-like freaks or whatever that run around, but there's so

432
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,400
many of them and they're so easy to kill, all you really have to do is, you know, like

433
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,600
to level up your physical attack or whatever, you just keep hitting B over and over and

434
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,180
over again and it just attacks all of them and you don't really take a lot of damage

435
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,920
and it's A, you do take a lot of damage, you just kind of jump out of the way and wait

436
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,320
until your health comes back and then go back down there and spam B some more.

437
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,880
Now, this game's been getting a lot of shit in the reviews for being just like the first

438
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,880
game.

439
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,880
Yes.

440
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,640
Do you think that's fair to knock the game for that?

441
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,960
Um, absolutely, it's very similar to the first game and honestly it should be more like the

442
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,960
first game than it is right now.

443
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,760
The problem I have with it is that basically it's very linear in the way you have to kind

444
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,240
of tackle the game because the first game it was, okay, here's the three gangs that

445
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:49,080
they have and they have these people that are, you know, the gang cell leaders or whatever

446
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,180
and then once you kill the leaders you go after the boss and, you know, it was kind

447
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,400
of neat because you could, okay, I'm going to tackle this gang first or I'm going to

448
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,920
tackle this gang first or hey, I'm going to tackle part of this gang, then go to this

449
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,220
gang and go to the last gang, whatever.

450
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,600
You could pretty much have the freedom to choose how you would tackle the game.

451
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,080
This one though is completely linear because, I mean, granted you can kind of run around

452
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,680
and do different things but they want you to hit up, you know, this one point first

453
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,500
and you have to turn on these beacons and then once the beacons are charged up you go

454
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:26,040
into kind of a protection mission almost where you have to protect the beacon from the freaks

455
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:31,400
while it, you know, charges up to destroy all of them and that's good and all but it's

456
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:37,240
kind of boring because all the missions are very similar.

457
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,560
I wish it was more like the first game where you had a bunch of gangs and you could kind

458
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,680
of tackle it the way it is.

459
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,840
The city itself is almost identical to the first city.

460
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,280
I mean they've got a lot of, like if you've played the first game you'll definitely recognize

461
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,240
a lot of landmarks in there which is kind of cool and some of the strongholds where

462
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,500
these freaks are and stuff are actually where the old bosses were in the first game but

463
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,040
it just kind of, it's a little sad that some of the stuff that, you know, made the first

464
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,520
game so good is kind of taken out.

465
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,360
Like the vehicles that transform when your driving skills is up, those aren't there anymore.

466
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,920
Instead you just get actual different vehicles that have that stuff or all the stuff that

467
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,760
was from the download content, the different like guns and whatnot are actually in the

468
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,760
game.

469
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,920
You have to unlock them later on and it's harder for me to like find these different

470
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,360
points where you're supposed to be getting, you know, gear and stuff.

471
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,120
Now you have to kind of choose your loadout and run around and then finally you have to

472
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:39,960
find the actual spots where you've captured spots on the map where you can get more ammo

473
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
and stuff.

474
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,480
And it doesn't matter anyways because these specialized guns that you have you can't find

475
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,360
ammo for them ever because the gang members don't carry them so once you've run out of

476
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,800
your limited amount of ammo you have to go just use their guns anyways.

477
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,800
SSG100Matt is also pointing out something that's missing.

478
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,400
It's just like the first game he says, minus a Halo Beta packed in.

479
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,200
That's at chat.hornsonsrader.com live.

480
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,080
But it does have the co-op, you know you can do four player co-op which is kind of fun.

481
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,560
They were, one of the things that they were kind of showing off was the magnet grenades

482
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,520
and honestly haven't really found those too useful yet.

483
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,420
Like they showed off some cool things you can do with them like you can stick one on

484
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:19,080
a gas tank and stick one, another one on a gas tank and fire at one and it'll fling the

485
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,640
gas tanks around.

486
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,240
But it's just, you know, it's hard to do that and line it up.

487
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,640
Oh and then like some of the stuff that they had from the first game that was kind of necessary.

488
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,560
Like for example the sniper rifle had a scope on it which is awesome because sniper rifles

489
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,040
normally have scopes.

490
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,560
Not in the second game because that would make sense.

491
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,560
Or targeting.

492
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,800
You know the first game you can target different parts of the people's bodies.

493
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,640
You can still do that in the second game.

494
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,440
The problem is though is say you target the wrong thing.

495
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,920
In the first game you can just kind of hit left or right on the analog stick or whatever

496
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,620
and it would switch between targets.

497
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,060
Now this one you have to keep hitting the target button to see if you can target the

498
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,060
correct person.

499
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,680
Do you think a lot of these things you're talking about have to do with the transition

500
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,680
between developers?

501
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,660
Because as I understand it the new development company did not have access to what the first

502
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,360
development company had done.

503
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,280
Besides what we all see in retail.

504
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,360
Well they had access to the retail game and they could play and go okay hey there is a

505
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,360
feature in the game.

506
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,080
Maybe we should have made note on it to add it to the game.

507
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,280
It wouldn't be that difficult.

508
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,880
And I hear that they're going to patch it.

509
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,240
They're going to patch it to add this feature back because it is kind of important that

510
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,640
should be there.

511
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,960
That excuse is getting old from all these companies.

512
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960
It is really old.

513
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,760
Dude we didn't finish the game in time because we needed to hit our release date.

514
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,000
But we'll patch it to fix it.

515
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,080
We'll promise us promises.

516
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,320
Blame the publishers most of the time.

517
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,320
It's an alright game.

518
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,760
I do like okay some of the positives though like orb hunting and stuff because there's

519
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:55,000
a lot of orbs and I can tell you right in the first game I have all but like two and

520
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,640
I can't find the last two.

521
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:02,120
I mean I could go through a guide and you know search from all down but it's going to

522
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,440
be really hard to find near the two last agility orbs.

523
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,520
They're probably somewhere I'm not looking.

524
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,520
At least this game.

525
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
You think?

526
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,520
Yeah.

527
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,520
That's probably where they'll be.

528
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,520
Somewhere you haven't looked.

529
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,880
Everything that you look for is always in the last place you looked.

530
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,420
So this game though does have an option where you can ping the orbs and actually see them

531
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:26,120
on your map briefly so you can hit the up button on the directional pad and it'll actually

532
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,040
ping the orbs to see where they're around.

533
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,640
So for example you're kind of looking for them and you are stuck with like two left.

534
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,400
You can ping it and see where it's at on your map and kind of give you a better idea where

535
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,080
there's zero in on it.

536
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,240
Thank God for that.

537
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,640
But just like some of the other stuff that's in the game it's I don't know it's just very

538
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,480
hard to get used to I guess.

539
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:53,240
Oh and the you know the guy that's talking to you throughout the entire game kind of

540
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,560
you know announcing things.

541
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:01,560
He's annoying and I can't turn him off which is annoying because he's like you should do

542
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,680
these road races.

543
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,740
I'm like I don't want to do road races right now.

544
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,400
You should do these road races.

545
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
They'll give you more driving skill.

546
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,480
Hey there's a rooftop race you just walked by.

547
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,280
I'm like I don't care.

548
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,640
Maybe you should go to that you know the beacon because it's not going to charge itself.

549
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,400
It's like stop nagging me to do this stuff.

550
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
I don't care.

551
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,740
You already have a wife.

552
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,240
Watch out there's freaks at night.

553
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,120
Really I didn't figure that out by spending the last 20 days in the game.

554
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,040
You know I can't figure out that the freaks come out at night.

555
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,360
Oh watch out there's a stronghold over here.

556
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,640
Really that's what that means on the map because you've already told me that three times now.

557
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,320
It's just very annoying.

558
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,080
They should have an option to tick that off.

559
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,420
Tell you once when you're starting the game because they kind of do explain everything

560
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,340
and then be done with it.

561
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:52,560
Stop bothering me with stuff unless it's actually important.

562
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,640
Anything else you gave me week Logie?

563
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:01,240
Some DS stuff because I was you know finishing up the trial stuff.

564
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:08,480
So played Pagle DS lots of Pagle Knights on there and a little bit of Zelda Spirit Tracks

565
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,080
just going through the next dungeon where I got some sort of windmill looking thing

566
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,600
which by the way that game just I don't know what it is with some of these Zelda games

567
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,120
but it pretty much it seems like that the whole dungeon is just a tutorial of how to

568
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,600
figure out how to use this item.

569
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
I get it.

570
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,300
Okay I figured out how to use the item.

571
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:29,000
You don't need to you know hey look you can do this puzzle with this you know oh hey look

572
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,100
you can do this now.

573
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,080
It's like just give me the features that you know the item has and I'll figure the rest

574
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,080
out.

575
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,080
You don't need to walk me through it.

576
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,880
You don't need to hold my hand to figure out how to use this.

577
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,080
Oh and fuck you Nintendo for making me blow on my DS to use the stupid item.

578
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,000
Some people don't want to do that.

579
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,840
Just because you have a microphone on there doesn't mean you have to use it for stupid

580
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,580
shit like that.

581
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:55,080
Are you still on that jury duty thing or did that finally finish?

582
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,200
Because I'm imagining you at the courthouse playing your DS just like very slyly having

583
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,200
to go.

584
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,200
And your DS.

585
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,200
I did that in the hallway.

586
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,140
But yeah no we finished up with that.

587
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,360
We had delivered.

588
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,800
The trial went on for eight days.

589
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
Oh god.

590
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,840
All right quickly what was the trial because we're all dying to know.

591
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,840
What was it?

592
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,840
Give us all the details.

593
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,240
Okay trials went on for eight days.

594
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:22,940
It was this woman by the name of Julie Mayo who had gotten fired from a printing company

595
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,360
in Sacramento here.

596
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,360
Which company?

597
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,360
Because they're probably hiring.

598
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,360
Pacific Standard Press.

599
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,360
Okay I'm running it down.

600
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,520
No they seemed like a nice company because they did have pretty much everybody you know

601
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,640
on the witness stand.

602
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,520
So anyways so she got fired from there but she is claiming that she got fired because

603
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,440
of racial discrimination because she was Caucasian.

604
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,360
She says that this woman by the name of Grace Schneider.

605
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,320
I love that just Logie's putting all the details out there.

606
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,320
It's all public record.

607
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,840
I know it's all public record but it's funny.

608
00:27:53,840 --> 00:28:00,280
So this woman Grace Schneider who is a Filipino supposedly called her a white bitch or a fucking

609
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,880
white bitch.

610
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,320
And because of that you know American lithographers.

611
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,880
I called my sister that once.

612
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,520
Well Pacific Standard Press or in this case the company was at the time known as American

613
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:17,120
lithographers basically was supposedly covering it up and all this stuff.

614
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:23,400
Anyways oh and because of that she has suffered you know severe depression agoraphobia and

615
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,920
post-traumatic stress disorder which by the way when they're asking you the questions

616
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:32,520
you know okay before they're picking the jury and stuff like that.

617
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,480
I was just like because you can kind of get the impression of what this person is claiming

618
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,480
is the problem.

619
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,800
You're just like what.

620
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,200
No that doesn't make any sense.

621
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,760
So throughout the whole trial the plaintiff lawyer was completely retarded.

622
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,720
Reminded me of Andy Griffith in the Matlock role.

623
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,300
And I'm just guessing from the way you're describing this.

624
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,680
This was a not guilty or not or no what would you call it.

625
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,840
Not liable right.

626
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,320
The person who sued lost.

627
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:04,740
I'm getting I'm just guessing yes.

628
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,360
So basically this this whole trial went on for eight days and the plaintiff lawyer he's

629
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,320
just completely idiotic is the worst lawyer I've ever seen.

630
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:18,480
Just after they finished the plaintiff's case it was the defense all they had to say was

631
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,480
they got nothing.

632
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,640
I mean he seriously did them such a favor it was retarded.

633
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,640
All the witnesses they called up not one even sided with her.

634
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,680
All of them told a different story the only person who told her story was her.

635
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,280
And nobody could corroborate it.

636
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:42,340
Anyways long story short after eight days of trial we deliberated twice in 10 minutes.

637
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,340
We knew that was coming.

638
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:47,240
I was just how long did you guys deliberate 10 minutes.

639
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,680
And we went over the questions twice just to be sure but most of them were twelve zero

640
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:57,000
and in the favor of the defense there was it was it was sad.

641
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,960
We were just like my God because it was down to like three o'clock.

642
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,000
And if we didn't get deliberated deliberations done by like 415 we would have to come back

643
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
on Friday.

644
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
We're like fuck that.

645
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,680
We are getting this done now.

646
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,560
Was she was was she pissed.

647
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,120
She looked frustrated like annoyed.

648
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,320
But she was like crying stuff throughout the whole trial.

649
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,520
Didn't do that when she knew at the end.

650
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,720
Oh but her lawyer which wasn't really her lawyer it was the his partner came in that

651
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:32,240
when we have the the verdict read he looked pissed and he did of course pulled the jury

652
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,280
which we figured they would because we deliberated in 10 minutes but I was like whatever I'm

653
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,480
fucking done today.

654
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
You get nothing.

655
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,520
I'm surprised you weren't playing Phoenix Wright in the hall.

656
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:50,440
I thought that would be ironic but yet no she it ended up that she was just a horrible

657
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,640
worker and she got fired for you know very you know obvious reasons and it made no sense

658
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,840
that she was claiming racial discrimination since the people that fired her were white.

659
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,400
She was replaced by a white woman and the majority of the company is white.

660
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,600
I'm sorry I asked all right.

661
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,880
I'm glad I had to know guys I had to know after two weeks ago.

662
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,920
Oh and by the way I did some research after the trial and she had also sued other people

663
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:20,400
and she has an Internet business which is doing a lot better than she claimed that it

664
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,640
was doing.

665
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:26,880
So she's a lying bitch allegedly I all right.

666
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,760
We don't need a trial for that.

667
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,880
I really hate people that do that crap.

668
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,800
The plaintiff lawyer kept calling like his client Mr. instead of Mrs. He kept screwing

669
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,940
up the gender of different people on the witness stand or whatever kept repeating stuff.

670
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:44,440
He would fuck up their names all the time and he misspelled examining on his little

671
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,200
board in this closing closing arguments.

672
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,200
It was awesome.

673
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,040
We video games back to video games sorry real life Phoenix right.

674
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:56,480
Drew Hey you're going to try and follow that up what do you have been playing this week.

675
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:03,360
I cannot top that I played played a little bit of wow and a lot of Left 4 Dead 2 towards

676
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,600
the end of the steam sale a friend of mine give to me Grand Theft Auto 4 for PC.

677
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,720
So I was playing some of that.

678
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,400
It's OK.

679
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:18,560
It actually made my system work for once but I've just been playing a whole lot of Left

680
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,560
4 Dead 2.

681
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,880
I really enjoy Ellis he's a motor mouth.

682
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:29,020
And aside from that my gaming group week has been pretty boring.

683
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:35,980
So I really got I really got after all that Loki said I got nothing all right.

684
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,980
That's fine.

685
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,980
That's fine.

686
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,480
Did you take advantage of the Uber steam sale that was going on I see Dark Soccer's on steam

687
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,600
right now and I remembered the week we were off they had some Uber sales and I know I

688
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:52,320
bought a lot I bought I managed to restrain myself since my funding is a little tight.

689
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,800
I think I spent about thirty thirty five dollars I bought a flat out ultimate carnage for two

690
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:04,760
bucks nice Left 4 Dead 2 for twenty and I was pissed when they dropped it down to ten.

691
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:13,440
It's like playing the stock market someone gifted me GTA 4 and I got one other game and

692
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,560
I can't remember what it was but I think I spent in total about thirty bucks.

693
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,480
This game is great it's called Blood Bowl.

694
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,480
It's Warhammer sports.

695
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,280
I know I think that's hilarious.

696
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,560
It is hilarious every single bit of it.

697
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,720
Let me transition into my week a little bit and I'll talk about what I bought on steam.

698
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,400
I was gifted the Civ 4 complete collection for my birthday because that went down to

699
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,880
about I think it was like ten dollars at one point so I got that as a gift which was awesome.

700
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,040
So I did play a little bit of Civ 4 this week got back into Crackleization.

701
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,080
I tried I tried.

702
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:49,160
Oh it's fun but it's a lot I honestly think the console versions of Civilization as much

703
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:54,280
as they're hated by some of the core Civ community I think they are really good entry level games.

704
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,960
So like if you've never played a Civ game before maybe start with the console ones but

705
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,320
I don't think the PC ones are that inaccessible they've got good tutorials but I played that

706
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,120
a little bit.

707
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,640
Team Fortress 2 I finally bought I played that a little bit but man I am horrible first

708
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:13,160
person shooters I was sucking in the tutorial levels it's sad.

709
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:20,240
If it was hard before it's a clusterfuck now that they've pushed the engineer update.

710
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:26,800
Now engineers can pick up carry and set down their sentries.

711
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:34,560
So on the server I was testing it on I played for two hours nine engineers on ten man teams

712
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,360
and the tenth man was a spy.

713
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,840
Jamie and I still have to have our match we didn't we didn't get around to that but I'm

714
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,600
I'm still learning how to play so yeah I would probably play as a team of all scouts it'll

715
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:49,440
have to be after the hand thing needs to be because they have the best taunts well here's

716
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,920
one thing kind of and maybe you know this Drew I granted I didn't spend a lot of time

717
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:58,080
with it I couldn't get my 360 controller to work right with it do I did I do something

718
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,960
wrong or does it not really work I've actually never tried using controller for Team Fortress

719
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:09,760
2 in fact I am very against the idea of using a console controller to play first person

720
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,280
shooter why there's nothing wrong with it it's personal taste I find a mouse to be more

721
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:20,280
precise some of those great internet debates well keep it keep in mind and when we were

722
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,000
all playing Final Fantasy 11 I was playing with controller well that team was designed

723
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:32,360
for the ps2 really but I could you know break out all my macros like that and people were

724
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:36,640
like why are you using controller I also want to say I bought this real quick because it's

725
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,720
awesome even though I didn't get a chance to touch it this week but I bought the complete

726
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:45,080
XCOM collection for like five bucks because the old school I just wanted to I never had

727
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,840
the chance to play through those but I heard they were good they're good so I'm gonna play

728
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:54,080
them let's see other games I played this week of course I play Warcraft because I always

729
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,560
fucking play Warcraft but I want to talk about some other games lol random game of the week

730
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:02,180
I played Star Wars the force unleashed the game's only about what two and a half years

731
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:06,720
old I finally got around to playing it this week that was that was the other game about

732
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,760
Star Wars Empire at War oh well there I'm glad I could help jog your memory there I

733
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,520
played the force unleashed which you might remember the talk about this one because this

734
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:24,560
is the one where Soulcalibur 4 had Yoda Darth Vader and then the apprentice Starkiller Starkiller

735
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,880
and this was his game was the force unleashed although you start the game playing as a Vader

736
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,480
which I thought was kind of cool I was like yeah I'm Darth Vader and I'm just gonna fucking

737
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,740
blow everything up with the force yeah I'm gonna blow through this giant wall yeah I'm

738
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:40,480
fucking Darth Vader whoo it was fine I actually was saying that while I was playing you know

739
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,440
it's fun but in in and then when you get into the real because the prologue lasts what like

740
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,080
15 minutes then you get into the real game and it and you know you're the actual apprentice

741
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:53,920
and there's a lot in the mechanic about gripping things with your you know it's it's what the

742
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,280
fanboys want you gripping things from a distance with your hand and like flinging these barrels

743
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:03,400
into the stormtroopers and into all these bad guys it's pretty cool I guess the game

744
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:08,200
got razzed a little bit by the critics and I can kind of see why there was some weird

745
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:14,920
graphical things in it and the mechanic seemed to be a lot of fling things around fling this

746
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:21,360
and fling that and it's it's also a really hard game it's it's I died like within five

747
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,840
minutes when I first started I was like whoa I gotta I gotta approach this a little differently

748
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:29,160
and I've been doing Lucasarts games have never been particularly forgiving but I would I

749
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,520
would not say it's a bad game by any means it was it was neat I think especially if I

750
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,160
was more of a see I'm more of a Trekkie hate me if you want but I think if I was more into

751
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:43,620
Star Wars I would probably really like this and I liked it enough as it is it was cool

752
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:47,000
I mean granted it's it's a little old now but you can probably get it cheap if you're

753
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,760
a budget gamer oh I can't get it cheaper than it was at the time it was seven dollars and

754
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:59,060
fifty freaking cents so it was cool I want to play a little more of that I I need to

755
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,160
play more I didn't play a whole lot so I want to play more of that I'll tell you what game

756
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,080
I played a whole lot of this week Puzzle Quest 2 came out on Xbox Live I believe it's all

757
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:13,920
sold on DS maybe iPhone all if it's not there yet it will be let's face it those Puzzle

758
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:20,500
Quest games show up everywhere so Puzzle Quest 2 is sort of the lol Galactrix didn't really

759
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,980
happen kind of game because remember there actually was already a Puzzle Quest 2 this

760
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:31,160
is the Puzzle Quest 2 back to swords and magic and sorcery type of game but I noticed right

761
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:36,360
off the bat this actually threw me for a loop they kind of did away with the world map in

762
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:42,880
the first game and now it's more of this isometric you don't really have free roam but you go

763
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:49,240
from screen to screen kind of like an old ass PC game is kind of the engine and at first

764
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:55,280
I was like I don't know if I like this this is really weird but then I realized by completely

765
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,280
changing and renovating the engine they kind of did away with what I didn't like in the

766
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,320
first game and that was all the micromanagement you had to do like the upkeep of making sure

767
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,440
you're in control of the castles and discovering spells a lot of the micromanagement and all

768
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:14,920
that stuff is gone and they have more of a streamlined dragon warrior-esque feeling RPG

769
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,560
if you will although again you don't free roam it's more like point and click but that's

770
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:24,320
not the game right the game unlike those other RPGs the game itself is not moving around

771
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:30,760
the game is the puzzle board and the bejeweled desk matching three in a row game I really

772
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,120
like the changes they made here and that's really what makes this sequel I think better

773
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:40,880
than the first game is that they did away with XP and gold as objects in the board you

774
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,720
might remember in the old game used to have to match up XP if you want to gain experience

775
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:49,120
you had to match up gold if you wanted gold that's all gone you just gain experience and

776
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:53,400
gold based on how well you do what they've replaced it with is that now there's an actual

777
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:59,280
purple mana so there's five colors instead of four and instead of gold they have these

778
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,720
brass knuckles I guess for lack of better more like iron knuckles I guess for lack of

779
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:11,040
a better term and as you level up iron knuckles you can either use a sword or a shield depending

780
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,720
on your class or possibly a poison if you're an assassin I think sorcerers do like magic

781
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,480
or mana pool regeneration things it's sort of like a wild card depending on your class

782
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:26,120
I kind of like that mechanic it really adds an interesting twist to it so that's really

783
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:30,760
the biggest change between puzzle quest one and two in regards to how the game works but

784
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:36,000
there's another thing you should also know is that now the size of the board will change

785
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,760
depending on what you're battling so sometimes you battle these big bears and there's a huge

786
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,560
board to go with it and I kind of like that and sometimes some squares will remain inaccessible

787
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,440
there are still some mini games like picking locks bashing down doors and they are all

788
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:56,160
pretty much give or take the variations on bejeweled you've seen before like does anyone

789
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:01,480
remember an Xbox live game and I think this is on like Facebook and stuff too called jewel quest

790
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:06,400
where the goal wasn't to match three in a row but was to make every square on the board

791
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,940
gold by matching a piece on that square I think so okay that is the search the room

792
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:17,740
mini game in puzzle quest 2 so lots of lots of little variations that you're kind of used

793
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:24,040
to seeing so I thought it was neat I enjoyed it and I played a hell of a lot of it so I

794
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,560
think that says something about it and you know for 15 bucks on Xbox live it's it's it's

795
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:34,580
pretty good deal 30 bucks on the DS so not sure what that's all about well I do it costs

796
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:39,120
more to make a cartridge than it does to push something digitally but I could see where

797
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,680
the allure of being able to take it with you would be but I'll probably try to play a little

798
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,640
bit more on Xbox live I need to because you know how well I'm doing on my beat three games

799
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:53,560
goal I've beaten zero so maybe I'll beat this one we'll see alright you guys ready to get

00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,240
to do I do want to point out if you go to our website at orange lounge radio.com there's

816
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,440
a little box on the left side called extended play and that's got like everything it's got

817
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,760
like our youtube channel our twitter our facebook the steam community olrpsp.com which we haven't

818
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:26,280
talked about forever and the wiki I love the wiki have people actually updated stuff there's

819
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,960
a few dedicated like dark Tetsuya AJ mix and I think I've seen a few others they're very

820
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,480
dedicated and they're very good generals of the oil army for keeping that stuff up to

821
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:43,080
date but it could use more so I'm hoping people crack on it get to it we need other contributors

822
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:47,560
all right and yes a comment in our chat room act F says nobody uses myspace anymore yeah

823
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:52,160
that's how I felt all right let's let's let's get into some actual gaming news here and

824
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,600
talk about what's going on in the gaming world Loki what's up well this is kind of interesting

825
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:07,560
they're going to be kind of changing up how you know people look at Xbox Live Arcade and

826
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:14,760
honestly reminds me a little bit of the PlayStation Network kind of what they're doing but it's

827
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:21,560
called destination arcade it's kind of a visual browser of the Xbox Live Arcade stuff they

828
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:26,560
have a bunch of different things on there including you can check out the new arrivals

829
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:32,300
check out some of the news stuff actually is browser titles they're going to have kind

830
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:41,560
of recommendations based off of different purchases lots of neat stuff also kind of

831
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:48,720
a way to maybe see some more better screenshots now they have this all kind of now but they're

832
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,840
making I guess a little bit easier to view because I know with a lot of the titles that

833
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:57,240
are out there now it may make it a little difficult to browse for what you're looking

834
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:03,660
for especially God if you were looking for indie games that's really difficult to find

835
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:08,800
now hope this includes the indie games yeah I was gonna say have you heard anything about

836
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:15,580
like the indie games the incorporation of that no so we'll see because I mean if they're

837
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:20,920
doing this with Xbox Live Arcade and the indie games are almost like Xbox Live Arcade stuff

838
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:25,620
I don't see why they couldn't include it now we haven't heard a lot about this next patch

839
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:31,000
in general and usually there's a lot of fanfare about what's coming up in these big you know

840
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,320
it used to be biannual now it's just what annual I don't even know how often they do

841
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:39,680
know it's kind of like whatever they feel like it is still biannual in fact this this

842
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:46,960
thing before well not even that that was just another update this update actually with the

843
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:54,480
visual browser is supposed to be happening I believe this month oh wow so any week now

844
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:00,740
I mean it should be coming soon have they said anything else about what else we might

845
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:04,800
see implemented I mean my assumption is that all this connect stuff is probably the big

846
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,600
thing that's gonna be in it but I don't think the connect stuff is actually gonna be in

847
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:13,640
there until it actually comes out on the fourth if anything I would guess that we're gonna

848
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:19,080
get that patch pushed to us probably either I'd say the end of October is when we're gonna

849
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:27,340
see the connect patch they'll kind of unlock all that stuff but yeah I mean it looks interesting

850
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:33,180
I guess they'll be I don't know we'll have to check out when it actually comes out but

851
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:37,880
it's nice I guess but honestly I've never had problem finding stuff on Xbox Live Arcade

852
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:42,720
but I could see where you might if you don't know what you're looking for um act-def seems

853
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,640
to say in our chat room here I'm just kind of summarizing what he's saying that this

854
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,800
whole new interface seems a lot like the rock band store the guitar hero store and the music

855
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,840
shop I haven't used that I haven't used those in a while because I haven't really been buying

856
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,100
download content I've used the rock band one before I haven't used it in a while either

857
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:05,360
but I've used it before well I haven't used it let's say in Xbox Live I've used it in

858
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:10,680
rock band 2 but you know it's a lot different on Xbox Live it's like this whole standalone

859
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:15,120
app yeah and you can listen to clips and everything without having to actually launch the game

860
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:19,800
which is interesting but it's what's also weird is that it shows up in your played games

861
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:24,860
history like it I think it's really just a mini game in a way yeah if that makes sense

862
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:30,320
but I think that's how Xbox kind of recognizes it as a miniature free game if you will so

863
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:35,880
um act-def uh also hits us with another good comment here at chat dot orange launcher dot

864
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,440
com says I think they won't add the indie games since they aren't available outside

865
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,400
the US and other countries so it'll only be for arcade stuff I don't understand why they

866
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,500
wouldn't be out they really should open it up to everybody one of the other features

867
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:51,680
that you can do in this is you can actually recommend games for friends so that's kind

868
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,680
of cool wait I thought now I realize act-def is in Mexico so maybe that is true about Mexico

869
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,240
but I thought um Japan had the indie games too because aren't there some indie games

870
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:03,000
being made over there I know there's some Japanese indie games that are on the service

871
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,180
already so I assume that they were in those regions as well so it's just kind of outside

872
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:12,480
of the big regions where you're not seeing this and when I say big regions I say Japan

873
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:21,500
US UK basically I guess all right well we'll see what happens with this store when it launches

874
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:25,920
or whenever we get a patch date so we'll see moving on uh did you know that there's a game

875
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:32,840
called Justin Bieber revenge what yes there's actually a video game called Justin Bieber

876
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:37,760
revenge and I imagine that Justin Bieber just like takes out an Uzi into that crowd of screaming

877
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,120
fangirls I found a game going through apps real quick that I have to share off topic

878
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:51,040
vuvuzela versus zombies I want to see Justin Bieber vs. vuvuzela the other day when I was

879
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:59,480
driving home I saw a guy with one of those blowing it out the window of his car I was

880
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:05,080
like what the hell I know it's all the rage I guess I it destined to become you know when

881
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:10,760
they have the I love the 2010 you know many years from now snarky bevels comics commenting

882
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:17,100
on the vuvuzela take that vuvuzela and shove it up your butt it just sounds like it probably

883
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:23,120
improved the sound God all right here it is Justin Bieber revenge look what it really

884
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:27,640
is you heard a tap tap revenge on the App Store right well tap tap revenge has all these

885
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:37,640
spin-off games Lady Gaga revenge Dave Matthews band revenge and Nickelback revenge I think

886
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,000
that should go the other way around Nickelback should not be having revenge on me I should

887
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
be having revenge on Nickelback for being on the radio but I did or Justin Bieber here's

888
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,840
the thing I don't listen to radio stations that play Justin Bieber but of course the

889
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:54,440
only time I've ever seen him was when I was waiting for more comedy in Saturday Night

890
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:59,520
Live because they had a break where apparently they just decided not to be funny or anything

891
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:05,160
we're being funny by having him sing but it was just I don't understand I don't see the

892
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:09,000
draw I don't get it all right well here's the thing it's going to be very interesting

893
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,520
I think you're going to see a little more Justin Bieber revenge and a little less Nickelback

894
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:16,520
revenge I'm not sure I feel about that in the future because guess what Tapulous the

895
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:23,640
company that makes these games was just bought this week by Disney that's right Disney bought

896
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:28,920
Tapulous so now they are a part of Disney interactive media which is interesting because

897
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:33,120
we've seen kind of more and more from Disney interactive media come out in the past couple

898
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:37,720
years we have split second Tron is coming out soon it's a little more than just the

899
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:46,920
kiddie games so on predator I'm sorry I was like that's not a turok was Disney oh that's

900
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:53,080
right well that's forget it was Sega all right but anyway I it's gonna be interesting to

901
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:58,480
see what this partnership might bring later on and tap tap revenge is not just a play

902
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:04,560
on Dance Dance Revolution that always kind of struck me as funny it's whatever it's just

903
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:09,560
an eye I've played the game and it's like one of those things that's oh yeah I'm black

904
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:13,000
wolf points out a good one that's important epic Mickey which is a very different direction

905
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,840
for the Disney franchises is also there not really when you look at it I mean it would

906
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:25,080
have been if it had been kept it to its original wonder you know awesomeness with all the like

907
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:30,020
really twisted shit but in the end it's going to be as twisted as like I think near the

908
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:36,680
Alice in Wonderland movie where there's definitely a dark side to it it's dark sided little bit

909
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:41,560
of that let me put it this way the equivalent of epic Mickey should have been and what it's

910
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:48,320
going to be it would be like if epic the original epic Mickey is like American McGee's Alice

911
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:54,240
versus what it's going to be is like you know Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland kill the

912
00:51:54,240 --> 00:52:01,160
mouse take his house kill the mouse take his house what was how it was supposed to be with

913
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:07,560
Oswald going nuts I see I get it isn't what the Oswald's in the in the thing right yeah

914
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:14,000
yeah but if he's not as nuts apparently okay it would have been you know that's what they

915
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,560
need to do American McGee's you know epic Mickey AJ mix in our chat room actually says

916
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:23,800
the game used to be called tap tap revolution going back to this old tap tap revenge thing

917
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:28,880
by the way just kind of like a little aside apparently like step mania is now on the iPhone

918
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:35,240
did you hear that yep now they it but it's it's tap mania but like what's really weird

919
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:39,040
about it like and I haven't played with the app so I don't fully understand how this works

920
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:49,400
but apparently you can load mp3s into the app but not via the iTunes interface which

921
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:55,200
I can't believe Apple approved that like there seems to be something there like I again I

922
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,600
haven't had hands on with it but apparently you can load your own mp3s and step files

923
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:03,320
into this app and that doesn't seem to be something that usually Apple's very supportive

924
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:08,160
of unless it's they're just claiming to do that via like the SM zips you know format

925
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,600
or something like that where you can just zip up the whole file and just throw it in

926
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:17,960
there with the steps and the backgrounds and all that fun stuff oh Black Wolf is saying

927
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,160
that it was a homebrew app back in the day it even worked with your own music people

928
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,440
submitted note charts and it was awesome and then the app store came out and they went

929
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,040
all legit so that I guess that's a history well now you got now you've got tap mania

930
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:36,200
is I guess the rogue renegade tap tap revenge or whatever but does anybody care all I can

931
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:42,480
say is that apps in general effing suck on my 3g now ever since iOS 4 came out like I

932
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,520
thought I asked for it was gonna be awesome but it really slowed down the 3g like mine's

933
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:53,000
been pretty awesome that's always been my impression of the iPhone is it was supposed

934
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:58,160
to be awesome but it just sucked all right can we move on I think we got Apple hey you

935
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:04,520
can even take that back to Apple Disney bought tap people we'll see what comes of that in

936
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:09,920
the future I'm just I'm just waiting I'm guessing your brother's revenge can't wait can't wait

937
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:15,200
by the Cyrus revenge goody goody what do you got for us dark Sakura well this is something

938
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:22,320
that has been on the mind of many a World of Warcraft and Starcraft 2 player about the

939
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:31,480
real ID here we go yep and this news comes from geek life plug plug that's geek dash

940
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:36,720
life that's important what's geek what's geek life without the dash take you to porn I don't

941
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:46,240
know I'm gonna look but the dash is important anyway there's a certain thing that happened

942
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:53,480
after one of the forum moderators revealed his name and someone managed to basically

943
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:58,120
put out all of his personal information out in plain view so they said um yeah we're not

944
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:04,560
gonna do that on the forum sorry oops our bad it's fine for everyone else just not us

945
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:10,640
how do people use the official Warcraft forums anyways I don't understand it's like if you

946
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:16,460
don't like it I'm sure that there's other forums out there I mean it tech support I

947
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:21,240
use the official Star Trek online ones tech support but it's World of Warcraft it should

948
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:26,400
never be broken I think well also life is like a podcast or something but their site's

949
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,580
kind of ugly I mean no offense it's just very disorganized anyway but geek dash life is

950
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:35,000
great yes it is it's fantastic and I've started doing a blog on there now called tales from

951
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,920
the vault okay so be mirrored on the orange I want to rant so let's get through this story

952
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,760
because I'm ready to write well I said everything while you were looking up the other site so

953
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:47,880
curious I believe me I have been closely following what's been going on with this whole real

954
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:52,600
ID thing gonna find you Rob have it wrong they will here's the thing the forums okay

955
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:57,520
obviously was a bad idea but yes you do have to post there for tech support sometimes and

956
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,520
if you want to contact the GM's you know why because when you call Blizzard you're gonna

957
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:08,000
wait on hold for 45 minutes if you can even get through at all like their text once you

958
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,380
get through to somebody their tech support's okay but from the standpoint of like sitting

959
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:16,680
on hold and everything it stinks it really stinks so yeah I mean the forums end up having

960
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:22,600
to be an alternative to that obviously the forums was a stupid idea I mean it was a dumb

961
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:27,580
idea I understand the whole wanting to get rid of trolls things but that wasn't the way

962
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:33,000
to do it roles don't care and it will give them more ammo you're gonna get rid of seven

963
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,940
eighths of your posters if at least by doing that so it's like why do you want to shoot

964
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:42,940
yourself in the foot maybe you want to do advertising on your form someday do they still

965
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:47,880
do advertising here's the thing it cuts down on bandwidth cost if you lose most of your

966
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:53,520
forum users that's the genius that's the fucking lizard they don't need to cut back on that

967
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:57,840
meanwhile they're running a computer game with 11 million people subscribing I hard

968
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:02,920
and soon a huge game that's gonna just like turn Korea upside down and then we're gonna

969
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:07,960
have Diablo 3 and don't think I happen with that and isn't Blizzard they have the bandwidth

970
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:12,840
to Blizzard a company that they can just make up a mount and just sell it for $25 and people

971
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:17,920
are like oh we got a new mount and sparkle ponies it's pretty sick dude now if they had

972
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,840
sparkle ponies they do have sparkle ponies no I still wouldn't play okay well I was gonna

973
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:27,200
say that that was hey we were promised a pony $25 sparkle ponies all right look here's the

974
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:32,520
thing yes the forum thing was dumb I there were people that were like yay no more trolls

975
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:36,940
on the forum yay yay but it's kind of like okay well now you can just sit there and talk

976
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:43,880
to yourself I suppose I don't think the official forums are that bad I mean yes there's trolls

977
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:49,200
but you know where on the internet aren't there trolls there's trolls in the reviews

978
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:53,960
for orange lounge radio on iTunes there's trolls everywhere you guys I don't understand

979
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:59,160
how it's gonna cut down on trolls because say I have my real name up there you know

980
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:05,200
whether my name is like you know troll guy or you know Matt I can still troll people

981
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:10,360
well look Rob they're they're not doing it anyway yeah try hanging out on the roleplay

982
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:14,680
forums and tell me there aren't more trolls well now how in the F are you supposed to

983
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:20,240
roleplay with your real name come on I know that's that's the death no the dumb that was

984
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:24,820
gonna be massive they already had a replacement site set up for everyone to go to all right

985
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:30,020
look I we could talk about the blizzard employee who got cyberstalked when he put his real

986
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:33,840
name out there and they spill all your data bottom line is they didn't go through with

987
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:38,280
it yay it was makes about as much sense as a whole lifelock dude so I'm not gonna go

988
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:41,400
back into the pros and cons of the forums but this is what I really want to make sure

989
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:46,520
people understand because there's a lot of misinformation out there okay there's a lot

990
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:49,960
of misinformation out there and one of the first ones was and I would see this I saw

991
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:55,140
this on Twitter from other podcasters and people that ought to know better it would

992
00:58:55,140 --> 00:59:01,980
say real ID is going away real ID is gone real ID has been eliminated by blizzard real

993
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:10,740
ID is here to stay no no no no no no no real ID didn't go anywhere it's just this implementation

994
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:16,500
didn't happen this extension of real ID didn't happen this whole blizzard already did a dumb

995
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:21,380
thing and they're just making it even dumber is the only thing that got pulled back everything

996
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:26,040
I said in my rant two weeks ago you know what changed from all that stuff I ran it about

997
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:31,200
two weeks ago about the whole friends of friends about the whole your last name is in the game

998
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:37,240
you know you know how much of that changed with this announcement nothing nothing the

999
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:42,580
only thing that that CEO mentioned was that he's they're not going to implement something

1000
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:47,000
they thought about implementing when almost 50,000 people replied on that thread before

1001
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:53,000
it got officially I have seen administrator posts on the forums and such saying that they're

1002
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,520
looking to close some security holes in the real ID system so you wouldn't be able to

1003
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:02,520
see friends of friends and such they're working on it but it is testament to the fact that

1004
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:08,440
if you complain loud enough often enough and in great enough number you can generally rattle

1005
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:14,960
the company into doing what's right and yet Bobby Kotick still has a job now Bobby Blackwolf

1006
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:19,560
thinks I'm blaming him because he was one of those people that posted about all that

1007
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:24,320
no Bobby I'm not picking on you I'm picking on because I know you don't play Warcraft

1008
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:28,840
whatever but there's you know people out there that claim to have friends at these companies

1009
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:33,720
and friends and all these high places I got friends that work there and I know what's

1010
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:40,460
going on well then you ought to know better Oh dark dark Tetsuya in chat so is mr. T gonna

1011
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:44,480
start using his real name in the commercial now I know that is his real name look name

1012
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:50,440
mister middle name period last name T I know there's some people that don't want to hear

1013
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:55,880
all this really that would be awesome for stalking celebrities in the game well they

1014
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:59,080
wouldn't post on the forums but here here's the thing but aren't their names going to

1015
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:03,480
be in the game do you know it's gone that's gone no here's the thing though here's the

1016
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:11,080
thing that's important is that this whole thing overshadowed something way more important

1017
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:15,760
that happened in real ID this week so allow me to bring some light to this it was revealed

1018
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,740
this we don't believe me go to wow.com it's in a story on there and there there are respected

1019
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:26,880
wow news site okay there is one line of code when inserted into an add-on will show your

1020
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:34,580
real name even if you don't have anybody on your friends list so if there is a rogue add-on

1021
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:39,680
out there that wants to insert and and already there's been these false reports and false

1022
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:45,000
photoshops and things of this line of code being in popular mod such as gear score and

1023
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,760
deadly boss mods luckily those are all bullshit but what is not bullshit is the fact that

1024
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:52,680
the code is out there and it works rob the hole has been closed it was hot fixed on the

1025
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:58,440
tenth yesterday okay okay fair fair enough but it was there in the first place and this

1026
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:03,080
is important because blizzard says this whole system they've been saying this whole time

1027
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:08,060
that this is opt-in and that it's safe well that exploit showed it wasn't and granted

1028
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:12,420
okay whatever this thing's been hot fixed yep yep yep yep yep they need to verify their

1029
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:18,180
shit first right exactly and what's to say there won't be a three line code or a five

1030
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:22,580
line code that is soon to come out that's also going to exploit this information my

1031
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:27,380
point is blizzard has been selling this thing as opt-in and opt-in and a lot of people that

1032
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:32,300
are advocating for this is opt-in well this little exploit that happened this week patched

1033
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:38,480
or not showed that the system is not opt-in if you really want to shut it off you've got

1034
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:43,820
to enable parental controls i'm a 32 year old and i have to enable parental controls

1035
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:49,460
on my own account in order to be able to shut off real id that is not opting in that's opting

1036
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:54,080
out and not only is it opting out it's opting out in a very complicated way it is opting

1037
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:58,780
in because they've opted you in to this wonderful feature well now i realize battle net wants

1038
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:02,700
to get in bed with blizzards or i'm sorry they are in bed with blizzard battle net wants

1039
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:07,940
to get in bed with facebook so so badly but here's the thing that's what facebook is getting

1040
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:12,900
a lot of shit over right now and there's that movie coming out about facebook and they really

1041
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:16,780
don't make them look like nice people have you seen the trailers for the i think it looks

1042
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:21,380
awesome but they really don't make the facebook people look like nice people like it's not

1043
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:26,980
nice it's not a very glamorous remember facebook and possibly blizzard hey you remember what

1044
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:31,720
happened to myspace remember how myspace used to be like facebook there will be another

1045
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:37,540
website and everyone will migrate to that website let me quickly finish my thought here

1046
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:42,160
and that is that you know it's not an opt-in program it's an opt-out program and if you

1047
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,460
are believing that it's opt-in this whole thing that happened this week should tell

1048
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:50,780
you uh different and you might be thinking i don't play wow i don't give a shit well

1049
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:55,980
if you're going to play starcraft 2 or diablo 3 this will apply to you and let's not forget

1050
01:03:55,980 --> 01:04:01,040
how many mmos have knocked off wow at this point how many video games in general have

1051
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:05,600
knocked off diablo and starcraft and blizzard at this point dangerous precedent yes it is

1052
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:11,120
a highly dangerous precedent so you may not care now but ask yourself if this were your

1053
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:16,780
favorite game would you care they might change the definition of opt-in to be you opt-in

1054
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:21,920
by playing our game um you know what if i have to say this that if they did it on star

1055
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:27,760
trek online i would quit i would and it's a dangerous precedent that they're setting

1056
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:32,220
so let's hope they do the right thing let's hope they um allow you to mask your last name

1057
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:36,720
allow you to you know have the handle at least hide that friends of friends stuff and just

1058
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:40,680
uh i wish my real name was on grand theft auto because i'd fucking love everybody to

1059
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:46,240
know that i'm kicking their ass by the way i'm ranked 58 now i in the world and i love

1060
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:50,280
this comment from toa gak in chat real ideas as secure as the we correct and that's your

1061
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:56,300
real name out there folks your real name because when i signed up for wow four years ago i

1062
01:04:56,300 --> 01:05:00,280
assumed that the name i was giving them was for billing and information purposes i had

1063
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:04,040
no idea what the agreement said no idea that this was going to be the result of it and

1064
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:08,240
now i can't change my name i would have signed up with my internet name and my internet trail

1065
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,440
rob roberts if i knew that in the beginning this is this is what actually i'd like to

1066
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:19,120
see happen is i'd really like to see you know an organized boycott hit him where it hurts

1067
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:24,860
well that's happening to some extent but you know i don't know it's i'm kind of on the

1068
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:29,800
fence with it like i was you know my whole thing last week i kind of believed the whole

1069
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:34,680
opt-in thing and that's why i didn't go so far as to say i'm gonna quit that at a da

1070
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:38,120
but then when the forum thing happened this week i got really angry and i thought about

1071
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:41,800
quitting because that kind of felt like a slap in the face from blizzard to me saying

1072
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:45,080
that oh well we're not really listening to the concerns you guys have about real idea

1073
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:48,680
in the first place in fact we're taking it a step further and i think what people are

1074
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:53,440
forgetting and this is really bothering me that this happened because you know blizzard

1075
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:57,640
announced this and then took it back it's making everybody forget the problem that was

1076
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:02,280
still there in the first place and the flaws with real ideas it is i wouldn't put it past

1077
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:07,280
them that they did it on purpose knowing that would happen i love their game i'd i know

1078
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:12,640
i would prefer it to remain a game it's so hard jamie it's not a social network i love

1079
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:17,160
that game and and i have so many friends that i interact with and play it with they'll still

1080
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:23,440
be your friends and i know but it's it's just i can't explain it i i know what you mean

1081
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:28,320
trust me i played ragnarok for how long yeah yeah and i quit ragnarok when they started

1082
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:33,840
doing shit i didn't agree with and i played in the beta like the the first actually i

1083
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:38,320
played um part apart from the alpha so that's how long i've been with ragnarok online when

1084
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:43,000
they started doing crap i didn't like i quit i'm not opposed i'm not opposed to quitting

1085
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:48,640
in fact ask ask alan i really kind of had a long chat with him about it and i said i

1086
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:52,720
was paid through the 14th so i said i'm gonna wait and see if blizzard changes their mind

1087
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:57,200
by the 14th and sure enough the scale back happened and i said okay well now they're

1088
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:00,280
moving in the right direction so i'm kind of like at that point where i'm like well

1089
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:04,500
let's see what happens but there is an expansion coming out and if they're going to want my

1090
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:08,680
40 to the expansion i want it to be an expansion i want i just think that there comes a point

1091
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:12,760
and this is something that people in the gaming community need to realize there comes a point

1092
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:19,360
which um when you basically sacrifice your ideals for entertainment uh rama kun in chat

1093
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:23,400
says chat dot orange on twitter.com by the way says sky all of this is coming from activision

1094
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:29,280
they're pushing for this not blizzard i don't care where it's coming from it sucks you know

1095
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:33,840
in the end i i don't really care who the boycott is hurting if it's not something i believe

1096
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:37,720
in then i'm not i'm not opposed to quitting well if that's correct that means blizzard

1097
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:44,020
is starting to push back but i have to it's here's what i'll tell you will happen i might

1098
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:51,360
stick with wow for now but there's two mmos coming out this fall that i am very interested

1099
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:57,120
in final fantasy 14 and dc universe you're supposed to play star trek and at some point

1100
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:01,600
i'm supposed to squeeze star trek online in there too i'm not playing with me i'm not

1101
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:07,600
paying for four mmos so quit world of warcraft and play with me we'll see you can you can

1102
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:13,320
play with all of my really cool new um friends in my fleet in fact i promised that i would

1103
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:20,120
give them a plug and i'm going to so oh yeah go ahead i would like to give my show although

1104
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:24,640
they're probably mostly all asleep because they're all in the uk of course they are of

1105
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:30,520
course they are the independent united fleet they are super cool people and well there's

1106
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:37,180
a couple there's one from hawaii and one from new york i think so i'm not the only american

1107
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:42,920
there one more thing i want to say unreal id and boycotting wow and all that i here's

1108
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:47,340
another thing to consider is that again this isn't just about warcraft i am really looking

1109
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:53,460
forward to diablo 3 i really like diablo 2 and i really really want to play diablo 3

1110
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:57,160
so that's another reason i kind of want blizzard to do the right thing here because realize

1111
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:02,040
that if i have to quit wow because of this um you know if if blizzard takes it a step

1112
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:05,680
further in the wrong direction and i end up quitting wow over this i'm gonna have to quit

1113
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:10,920
diablo 3 as well rob which is gonna it's not the same but you could always have torchlight

1114
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:14,640
i do have torchlight and it's great so yeah there's the torchlight mmo to look forward

1115
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:19,460
to next year i suppose there's a we'll always have torchlight backs me up that you can play

1116
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:24,700
star trek online with me and travis oh god travis travis will do nothing but dare me

1117
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:29,460
to do dumb shit in star trek online just like he does there's no real way that you can do

1118
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:37,380
dumb shit on star trek oh that sounds like a challenge it's run without armor into a

1119
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:42,320
horde of klingons and watch them kick you in the face let's not forget my first character

1120
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:50,500
and when i was in the beta my character's name was captain sassy of the uss oh girl

1121
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:54,660
that was a challenge idea by the way the ship name i've i have seen i have seen plenty i

1122
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:59,580
actually ran into a captain jack harkness that's awesome who role plays captain jack

1123
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:07,340
harkness on from torchwood on and doctor who all right in the damn star trek online thing

1124
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:13,580
i just noticed something how come every captain seems to be named jack go to america is not

1125
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:18,660
named jack he's steve um let me let's move on i want to move on to other gaming stories

1126
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:22,460
but real quick i thank you guys who have kind of bared with my hatred of real idea over

1127
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:25,700
the past couple weeks on the show i know not everybody's into wow and all that but remember

1128
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:31,820
i just want to remind you guys precedent this could have a huge effect on online gaming

1129
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:35,620
as we know it i mean imagine if xbox live required it your real name would you would

1130
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:39,540
you stick with xbox live i just just throwing it out there guys all right let's move on

1131
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:43,180
completely there's actually something that bobby just said in chat oh that i think is

1132
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:46,220
amazing what's that go ahead and read to draw a parallel i said first they came for the

1133
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:49,980
wow people and i said nothing for i don't play wow you know he said something similar

1134
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:54,020
on his twitter this week about the whole thing and i think that's a great uh great little

1135
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:59,700
analogy for for you know for anyone who don't know you know is that you know finally in

1136
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:03,260
the last thing is like finally they came for me and there was you know no one to say anything

1137
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:08,420
for me and i think that you know it's like you're saying this is going to set a precedent

1138
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:14,540
since it's time to stop it in its tracks and i still say everyone should quit surezo in

1139
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:19,740
chat room says it's okay rob ranting on wow is okay with me and here's the thing though

1140
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:23,120
guys there's a there were a lot of people on twitter when i said i was so frustrated

1141
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:28,240
with this they were like yay quit wow quit wow it's stupid wow but all these people that

1142
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:32,140
are egging me on to quit wow probably have some game they really enjoy to play and the

1143
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:36,620
thing about wow you guys as as stupid as this is going to sound i i realize this but this

1144
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:40,620
is just this is the way it is in the year 2010 okay i have a lot of friends in the bay

1145
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:46,700
area that i'm able to like hang out with when we play wow especially one of them happens

1146
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:50,020
to be my boyfriend like we quest together and it's adorable you know that's kind of

1147
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:53,900
one thing we'll do during the week and i think it's really cool that we're both into that

1148
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:58,540
and one reason i kind of didn't want to leave wow is that we wouldn't really have that although

1149
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:01,220
we've got plenty of it we could play team fortress 2 or life or dead and all this other

1150
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:04,940
stuff and you know it's still we'd still have an awesome you know connection and all that

1151
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:12,100
stuff but it you know it's it's hard to just say oh quit you know because you you are saying

1152
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:16,220
goodbye to all your friends when you do that but i also understand it's just a game and

1153
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:20,300
at the end of the day if you believe in something that strongly then you need to walk away and

1154
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:25,620
that is what i will do when you know if if push comes to shove if this makes you feel

1155
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:30,820
better rob um i still keep up with at least four people from the free server that i played

1156
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:36,340
on in um ragnarok online and back from the old school days keep in mind that i quit what

1157
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:44,100
six years ago um i still keep up with at least um three people from there luckily most of

1158
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:47,740
the people i play with i already know in real life but there are a few there's there's a

1159
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:50,940
couple that were listeners of the show that i've gotten to know really well just because

1160
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:56,460
they they came to play wow so you know it's kind of neat anyhow let's move on loki we

1161
01:12:56,460 --> 01:13:01,280
need like a whole new different change a topic here it's something something else to um take

1162
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:10,260
our minds off of all this stuff uh we're coming to the psp real id you know uh it affects

1163
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:17,860
nobody um so yes apparently this is great great planning on um sony's part gotta love

1164
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:25,060
their forethought in this i pet psp and invisibles may not support the psp go in north america

1165
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:34,180
um of course these games do require the um playstation portable camera which would have

1166
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:42,300
plugged into the uh usb port on the top of the 3000 2000 1000 models you may remember

1167
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:50,860
though that the psp go does not have that port on top of its system instead they have

1168
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:57,500
some sort of an adapter or converter cable that um is released in japan to be able to

1169
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:08,020
use that kind of stuff that's not coming out over here so yeah it may not be able to you

1170
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:12,740
you're obviously not going to be able to purchase the game either via digital download well

1171
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:18,220
obviously not in umd because the game system doesn't have a umd drive but um might be a

1172
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:24,340
little bit tougher to purchase those for the go i i realize you know i think there's a

1173
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:29,180
lot of people that just want sony to come out and admit psp go is a big fucking flop

1174
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:33,140
it is a big fucking flopping you know why so he can't say that everybody gotta know

1175
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:37,220
that sony can't say that you know what's a big fucking flop have they done any more like

1176
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:42,220
bundles to try to promote the psp go no the last bundle that came out was a psp 3000 with

1177
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:48,300
familiar solid there's another bundle coming out with um you know madden there's gonna

1178
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:54,060
be another bundle coming out i think for kingdom hearts notice all those are with psp 3000s

1179
01:14:54,060 --> 01:15:01,240
they are not with the psp go so is that sort of sony's way of of declaring it dead without

1180
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:06,540
declaring it dead well just like they're still willing to say that the umd format is awesome

1181
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:13,020
for movies that it was a successful format i mean they're just they're never willing

1182
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:20,020
to admit defeat despite the fact that defeat might be you know very obvious much like the

1183
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:25,260
court case i was in for the last three weeks are these games themselves you think you're

1184
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:31,340
gonna be any good no it seemed like for a while there the psp had all these like pretty

1185
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:35,260
cool games coming out on it now i don't i it's just me or things slowing down on that

1186
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:40,760
front we really it seems like everything that's on the psp right now is just ports of ps3

1187
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:44,760
games which you know okay you know i i understand you know you want to port a lot of stuff to

1188
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:52,180
handheld makes sense but i mean the psp hasn't had a lot of original stuff right like i i

1189
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:56,900
know there was the final fantasy fighting game but that's the last one i can think of

1190
01:15:56,900 --> 01:16:02,900
there's a pretty good like what like the congratulations you've won jamie i hate those things but you've

1191
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:10,980
won you should be congratulated um so let's see here yeah there's been you know some good

1192
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:16,500
exclusive psp games a lot of it's like niche rpg stuff there's the occasional first party

1193
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:23,540
sony title which is you know like i got a war title or something like that uh motorstorm

1194
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:31,020
arctic whatever the hell they called it um they're okay i mean even they're decent but

1195
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:35,820
it's just not like you're not getting really good third-party tiles i mean mel you're solid

1196
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:42,780
it's gonna be pretty good but just there's not a lot of them out there i mean i just

1197
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:46,860
know that a lot of my customers don't get excited about psp games anymore not even so

1198
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:51,860
much ds games anymore either but i can definitely say there's a lot more ds games coming out

1199
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:59,940
than psp games although there's also a lot more crappy ds games coming out but i pin

1200
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:05,140
invisimals if you really had a psp go i don't think you're gonna be too sad about that because

1201
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:11,340
really i pet you know an augmentive reality game where you raise a little pet i don't

1202
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:15,620
think a lot of people that own the psp go give a shit or invisimals you know a game

1203
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:20,100
that's kind of like monster rancher but you know you take pictures of stuff and you know

1204
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:26,060
based on the picture you get these little animals or whatever uh nothing of that i don't

1205
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:29,940
give a shit about that either that's just like saying oh it's so sad that we didn't

1206
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:36,820
have the gps function you know for you know some game like they had one for uh one of

1207
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:42,900
the uh golf games where you could go and get information about golf courses and stuff like

1208
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:47,500
that if you took your psp with you nowadays if you want that kind of crap you have an

1209
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:53,540
iphone or an ipod or something like that well let's continue on any any phone that has apps

1210
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:58,780
let's continue on with this whole comparison of uh the phones and so forth to the systems

1211
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:05,780
because uh apparently uh sony and nintendo both are in talks right now to add 3g network

1212
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:09,780
connections to the next batch of handheld game machines maybe this is something in store

1213
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:16,260
for the psp2 or even the 3ds or more likely a future in creation of the 3ds um this is

1214
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:22,300
coming from ryuji yamada in a newspaper report in the wall street journal he's the president

1215
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:28,740
of ntt dokomo inc is the biggest wireless carrier in japan is currently a company that

1216
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:34,340
had the cool gachamon commercials yeah currently talking to uh video game hardware makers to

1217
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:40,860
try and get these uh portable systems connected to 3g uh there is a quote here from uh ryuji

1218
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:46,660
yamada in the various uh articles quote video game makers know that in order for portable

1219
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:51,260
game machines to take the next step forward they need wireless communication we are discussing

1220
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:57,780
this with various players interesting it's going to be expensive well yeah i mean gosh

1221
01:18:57,780 --> 01:19:04,700
the 3g and an ipad makes it what 120 more expensive i think these will be certain versions

1222
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:08,140
of these types of hardware but i don't i don't think you're going to see this in the first

1223
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:13,120
phase of the 3ds but certainly there could be a later phase just like the dsi came out

1224
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:19,060
later on there'll probably be a 3ds iphone or something like that coming out i mean in

1225
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:24,820
a way isn't the iphone kind of the big competitor right now with the handheld it is it is like

1226
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:31,860
it or not the iphone and ipad are our handheld gaming systems right now

1227
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:37,220
you know i don't buy that though i mean i understand you know if you put out a lot of

1228
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:41,860
games you know on a platform i guess we can call it a gaming platform you know the pc

1229
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:46,580
is a gaming platform there's tons of games on there but and just because a lot of people

1230
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:53,540
buy them i mean i guess it's just what i'm trying to say is people buy apple products

1231
01:19:53,540 --> 01:20:04,900
are very um sheepish um ba no i i actually sat sat and compared the stats between that

1232
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:11,500
in the blackberry and honestly i've used a bunch of different ones and i like my iphone

1233
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:16,660
so you know clearly the reason why a lot of people have it is because it's actually a

1234
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:21,180
good product now i do believe in the rule of thumb wait until the second generation

1235
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:25,940
all right have you seen this youtube that's been floating around this week because it's

1236
01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:30,900
really really funny and look i am an apple fan too and i want an iphone 4 but this youtube

1237
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:38,100

1251
01:21:55,860 --> 01:22:00,580
anything it's a brand all right that's on tiny watch productions on youtube and i i

1252
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:04,500
just thought that stuff was funny it's that that's the whole sheet thing you're talking

1253
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:13,340
about right loki yes well grab bad bag because i want one and i'm not seeing everybody there's

1254
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:17,420
a few people out there that actually do look at the specs and stuff but a lot of people

1255
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:25,860
just go oh my god apple's releasing something go by like the ipad come on the ipad the oh

1256
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:30,860
i don't get it by the way um there's uh some uh arguments back and forth apparently the

1257
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:35,060
guy who made that video actually works for best buy and there was a little like i guess

1258
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:39,200
he was fired but then he wasn't um according to a story but he didn't he didn't go back

1259
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:43,820
i don't think i think he told them to take to his job and shove it yeah basically i don't

1260
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:51,980
care i guess that whole text to video thing is is really easy to do now because that obviously

1261
01:22:51,980 --> 01:23:01,140
that i would i would take the ferret 10 times over that stupid boo-boo zillow if that becomes

1262
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:10,060
a new thing on the show i'm gonna kill myself all right we found the tribble we found angus

1263
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:14,740
yeah somewhere in here was a story about cell phones on sony and nintendo would that entice

1264
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:19,980
you to buy the system i don't know i kind of don't care no i don't care i don't care

1265
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:24,460
that's how i feel here's what really keeps you away from phones like that because you

1266
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:31,260
know i will show you my phone rob and just kind of give you an example here my phone

1267
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:36,100
used to be silver it is now gray because all the paint has rubbed off on it the rubber

1268
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:39,960
that used to be on this phone covering you know the different speaker ports and whatever

1269
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:45,900
has dissolved to nothing um some of the back lights are probably burnt out it doesn't get

1270
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:52,380
internet at all let me put it this way it still has an old logo loki's phone is so last

1271
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:57,700
gen that's basically what it is like three gens ago this is like more than that but here's

1272
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:01,840
the here's the point though the reason why i don't get a new phone and don't upgrade

1273
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:06,660
my services stuff because it's fucking expensive i pay fifty dollars a month for this phone

1274
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:12,340
of which i use i pay maybe twelve dollars or twelve minutes a month i don't want to

1275
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:17,700
know what dan and i spend i pay 80 for mine granted but like for 30 dollars i mean i have

1276
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:22,120
internet everywhere loki internet everywhere i i have to say this and the big thing for

1277
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:27,560
me is that if i wanted to have a permanent internet tether all i have to do is jailbreak

1278
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:34,860
my iphone and i can go anywhere and use the 3g as my internet or you know it has my because

1279
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:41,900
otherwise i was actually looking into buying a pda you know this replaces a pda for me

1280
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:47,500
it replaces my phone my pda enemies don't have to carry my gameboy around you can use

1281
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:52,320
and my mp3 player just just to remind i just wanted to tell you here's a really good reason

1282
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:56,500
why you want to have internet on your cell phone because with internet on no camera on

1283
01:24:56,500 --> 01:25:01,900
this either no but here's the thing with internet on your cell phone you can read tmz while

1284
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:07,580
pooping i just want to point that out you can sneak into the bathroom at work uh-huh

1285
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:14,740
and play peggle just so you know dan i just heard like speaking of pooping i just heard

1286
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:19,100
like a huge gunshot go off in the living room and almost maybe poop right here we have playing

1287
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:24,220
crackdown too we have epic subwoofer remember all right that's right all right yeah you

1288
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:30,460
know what keeps me from getting an iphone i can't fucking afford it okay and just okay

1289
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:35,500
okay dude stories on lindsey low hand kind of facilitate release just so you know for

1290
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:45,020
the same price as an iphone you can buy a computer all right i can just go into the

1291
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:49,480
garage and dig up spare parts and build a computer dark sakura the show has literally

1292
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:54,100
gone into the toilet can you uh help move us on to a different topic how about dating

1293
01:25:54,100 --> 01:26:01,580
sims rob yay this is the best drm ever um okay for people who have pirated versions

1294
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:09,380
of love plus well when they play their pirated version they find um a little surprise when

1295
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:16,300
they shut off their game and turn it back on um basically instead of having to you know

1296
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:20,180
bypass this and that not being able to play like sure go ahead and play the game and you

1297
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:24,660
get all your happy love points at the girl and yay then you start the game back up she

1298
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:31,100
hates you you cannot get her to like you again you cannot get any of the girls to like you

1299
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:36,980
again because they know you're a pirate and girls don't like pirates at least not in dating

1300
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:44,540
sim land why won't she love me and because you're a dirty ass thief that's why and well

1301
01:26:44,540 --> 01:26:49,580

1302
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:53,740
she was pissed at me i can't get her to like me and she's always annoyed at me it's the

1303
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:58,700
ultimate anti-piracy measure i tried the friend part of love plus again to get some scenes

1304
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:03,340
i missed you're right she wouldn't let us become lovers after 100 days she still won't

1305
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:07,380
let me become her boyfriend she completely ignores me and won't send me an email she

1306
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:13,660
would never let me see your tits the events aren't happening either brutal let's see if

1307
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:18,860
the developer hates you the girls hate you too what a surprise and it's written into

1308
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:25,780
the game as copy production dark soccer would you show your boobs to a pirate depends have

1312

1313
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:53,500

1314
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:57,960
heavier i just want to point out before the show tonight dark soccer was reading a story

1315
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:01,660
about all these like disneyland myths or things like that one of the things she was talking

1316
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:05,720
about was flash mountain where which i guess is still a website that's operational which

1317
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:10,340
is all the ladies at disneyland that like to show their stuff while they're on splash

1318
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:14,940
mountain i almost called it flash mountain and i'm every time i see that i'm like yeah

1319
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:18,960
i have a friend that would do that not jamie somebody else but i would never do that at

1320
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:23,940
disneyland rob not at disneyland but at mardi gras no no no no no because mobile mardi

1321
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:27,740
gras does not have boob flashing i mean it does but it's sort of like what the crap are

1322
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:33,340
you doing show my boobs right now you're not remembering seriously you didn't really like

1323
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:40,380
you're being stupid we don't care about your tits we want moon pies i'm remembering the

1324
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:45,620
the gabriel lacey skit were they flashed oh yeah and they thought that it were were a

1325
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:50,220
couple women because they look like sexy bitches because they're man boobs i want to see real

1326
01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:54,140
quick it reminded me that whole little story of i i know we've covered it on the show before

1327
01:28:54,140 --> 01:29:00,060
the earthbound uh copy protection or whatever it was where the game got harder if you pirated

1328
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:03,700
it there would be like yeah four times as many monsters in the last and self in the

1329
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:10,220
last battle it freezes you truly cannot comprehend the true form of the attack because it deletes

1330
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:16,220
your fucking save file that's brutal well i mean if you're gonna pirate a game however

1331
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:20,500
i would love to see the people who got that far with it and you know i want to see a rom

1332
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:25,480
hack where you can play it that difficult and beat the game i think it's been done okay

1333
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:30,760
people just get around this copy protection it won't take long but no but i think it's

1334
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:34,380
fun that that's what they do because they recognize it's gonna happen let's just make

1335
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:38,960
their lives a little bit of hell for you know until they figure it out by then we'll hit

1336
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:44,380
our sails we're done we also had a story um not too long ago probably about four or five

1337
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:49,140
months ago about the whole batman arkham asylum had been pirated and uh apparently in the

1338
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:53,960
pirated version of the game one of the and i'm trying to go from memory here so forgive

1339
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:57,780
me if i screw this up one of the like jump types was missing or there was a puzzle that

1340
01:29:57,780 --> 01:30:02,480
couldn't be finished and a guy went on the forums to complain about it and the creators

1341
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:07,180
of the game or the forum moderators basically said yeah you're playing a pirated version

1342
01:30:07,180 --> 01:30:10,400
of the game because uh we kind of you know did that on purpose in the pirated version

1343
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:14,940
of the game ban no that's because he complained about it before the game was released and

1344
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:19,080
it's kind of that wasn't what the story was it was it was the feature that gave him away

1345
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:24,140
yeah that was that it was it was that he was complaining about it before the game was released

1346
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:30,380
that was stupid there are people you get advanced copies all the time and and i legitimately

1347
01:30:30,380 --> 01:30:36,300
too rob that was about as stupid as the uh guy who complained on the steam forums that

1348
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:42,140
he got banned for uh what was told to him was an undetectable hack and i shouldn't be

1349
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:47,060
banned because it said the hack was undetectable you should guys shouldn't have been able to

1350
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:51,720
shouldn't have been able to detect it why do i get banned reverse the ban somewhere

1351
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:55,820
in a lull bye have a nice day oh you should probably get your money back from that for

1352
01:30:55,820 --> 01:31:00,380
buying that hack that's just called an idiot somewhere in a lunchroom nerds are laughing

1353
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:07,340
just an idiot it's and this one thing actually you really do dig about the sims that i mean

1354
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:13,520
now i'm not playing um a all my copies are legit and registered but i download hacks

1355
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:20,460
like crazy for them and the ea actually looks at you know some of the stuff that people

1356
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:25,020
you know make uh modded stuff for and actually kind of incorporate those themes into their

1357
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:29,900
future releases for their store well they know what happens i think the moral of the

1358
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:35,980
story here is buy your games legitimately and maybe you can see some tits yeah i think

1359
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:40,420
if you pay for your game legitimately and then you know there's no tits in love mod

1360
01:31:40,420 --> 01:31:46,580
it i'm sorry i mean the only way that you can get the patches that ea puts out is to

1361
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:51,620
basically reinstall everything which i've done you know i i but i only do that when

1362
01:31:51,620 --> 01:31:58,140
i buy new versions but i mean but still it's i i think i like i like it better when a company

1363
01:31:58,140 --> 01:32:01,420
understands that it's going to happen and then they fuck with you well i agree once

1364
01:32:01,420 --> 01:32:04,500
you buy it you should be able to hack the shit out of it it's your copy of the game

1365
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:08,020
and if you want to tear it apart go for it as long you know i don't think you should

1366
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:15,340
hack it to re-upload it you know with to be free and all that but whatever let's move

1367
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:19,200
on let's uh talk about release dates speaking of buying your games legitimately there's

1419
01:37:31,060 --> 01:37:36,700

1420
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:43,100
from tagging you i hate that too i really wish you could screen that first before you

1421
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:52,940
get tagged in pictures i don't like that too or at least a way that you can detag it yourself

1422
01:37:52,940 --> 01:38:00,860
i think you can really yeah i haven't seen it yet anyway um so games well and this is

1423
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:05,500

3 um destination arcade and then the 16th puzzle quest 2 and toy story 3 the video game

1426
01:38:21,940 --> 01:38:25,780
which actually i was looking at the preview for that looks kind of fine my sister's been

1427
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:30,140
playing it on 360 and she says it's pretty fun i actually was listening to another podcast

1428
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:33,820
on the drive down here and one of their caller or whatever was saying good things about it

1429
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:39,460
too so um it was sounds like it might be better than you think as far as movie tie-in games

1430
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:44,500
go i've tried out is that it dark soccer yeah all right well then let's get back into some

1431
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:51,240
news loki yes um there has been a trial date or at least a couple trial dates set for the

1432
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:58,000
infinity ward suit you may remember of course uh the founders of infinity ward were um forcefully

1433
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:05,560
departed from their company and uh are now suing for uh royalties that were unpaid uh

1434
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:12,920
the lawsuit will take place on may 23rd uh 2011 and there's also supposed to be another

1435
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:18,220
uh hearing on august 5th to determine whether a third lawsuit filed by employees of infinity

1436
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:23,940
ward against activision should be considered with the other two lawsuits um on i guess

1437
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:30,700
march 1st activision dismissed uh both west and zampella uh the creators of the called

1438
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:37,340
ooze series for um alleging insubordination and breach of contract by the two and of course

1439
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:43,380
they're suing seeking 36 million dollars in unpaid royalties and alleging activision rigged

1440
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:49,040
an investigation into their conduct to um find a pretext to fire them uh activision

1441
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:54,780
fired or filed a counter suit against the two and of course since then they've created

1442
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:59,700
the uh respawn entertainment studio and there's i believe at least 40 of the employees have

1443
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:05,060
uh kind of moved over to their new studio as well i think i know what activision activision

1444
01:40:05,060 --> 01:40:10,900
could do about it they gotta hire your hire that lawyer you had to deal with god that's

1445
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:15,640
the case dude that that i'm serious if that's the case that trial will take about three

1446
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:20,980
years to complete cuz that guy is slow and confusing and will not help them out in one

1447
01:40:20,980 --> 01:40:25,140
bit and not only are that they can afford more money or you know afford a better lawyer

1448
01:40:25,140 --> 01:40:32,060
than that cuz the theory was going around uh the jury panel is somehow they think that

1449
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:37,900
she was related to him the defense rests like jury hibernates like he's uh he's an uncle

1450
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:42,920
or something because there's no way you would pay good money for a lawyer like that he was

1451
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:49,260
terrible can't we all just get along no i wish i could have recorded that trial just

1452
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:56,980
to so people can understand the kind of pain and suffering i you know was affected by um

1453
01:40:56,980 --> 01:41:03,460
i should sue her for the pain suffering that's wrong no it was seriously such a waste of

1454
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:08,340
time all right well uh i'm sure there's gonna be lots of i i can't believe it's actually

1455
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:13,660
going to trial most of this stuff usually gets settled i hope it's on court tv or maybe

1456
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:16,780
e will do some reenactments remember during the michael jackson trial when he did the

1457
01:41:16,780 --> 01:41:20,420
reenactments that was the best stuff ever it's about gaming companies nobody gives a

1458
01:41:20,420 --> 01:41:32,380
shit yeah i guess that's true but you know all right uh let's move on and uh talk about

1459
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:38,340
uh this interesting little story about roger ebert um which i find kind of interesting

1460
01:41:38,340 --> 01:41:43,020
because uh you know he was kind of a few years ago no it actually wasn't a few years ago

1461
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:46,900
probably about a year ago he made this post about video games are not art and can never

1462
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:52,860
be art he's basically saying you know video games are not art and he took a lot of crap

1463
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:57,340
from people that were like you know well what about flower what about shadow of the colossus

1464
01:41:57,340 --> 01:42:01,060
what about you know all these other great games that you know you're not really giving

1465
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:06,220
a fair shot to um well roger ebert actually came out and this is actually kind of in the

1466
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:10,140
week we were gone but it was worth mentioning here saying um i was a fool for mentioning

1467
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:14,700
video games in the first place i would never express an opinion on a movie i hadn't seen

1468
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:19,460
so he did make kind of like a if you will like a retraction post but i didn't when i

1469
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:23,620
read it i didn't really see it as a retraction post more or less as like an olive branch

1470
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:28,540
type of post would i think would be more of a fair comparison not only not only though

1471
01:42:28,540 --> 01:42:34,780
did he say that he shouldn't be complaining about things he's never experienced he still

1472
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:41,860
doesn't want to even want uh doesn't even want to try and understand people have offered

1473
01:42:41,860 --> 01:42:48,780
to uh supply him with a system and games that they considered to be artful and he will he

1474
01:42:48,780 --> 01:42:53,540
still refuses to play them he just isn't going to make a statement about things he doesn't

1475
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:58,700
want to uh experience yeah so he's one thing i think you should kind of make sure you pull

1476
01:42:58,700 --> 01:43:02,740
away from this he didn't come out and say okay they're art he's just saying you know

1477
01:43:02,740 --> 01:43:07,780
what i shouldn't have said anything it's my bad passive aggressive bullshit if you can't

1478
01:43:07,780 --> 01:43:13,020
say something nice don't say anything i and yeah it's very interesting that he kind of

1479
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:17,460
won't play the games but you know at the same time no one has to do anything they don't

1480
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:23,900
want to do no one has to do anything so there you go he's basically come out and said i'm

1481
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:27,940
not going to do it so you know what i'm not going to comment on it and i was bad to comment

1482
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:32,860
on it in the first place and so most people are like okay you know i never hated the guy

1483
01:43:32,860 --> 01:43:36,500
for what he said i mean hate would always be a strong word anyway i've you know rather

1484
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:41,200
thought his opinions on movies were very interesting and so forth but you know i think yeah you

1485
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:44,740
probably shouldn't make such a bold statement about something you really haven't i mean

1486
01:43:44,740 --> 01:43:50,940
especially games like you know the flowers and the shadow colossus and final fantasies

1487
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:55,380
and more artful type of games i mean you can't just associate video games immortal combat

1488
01:43:55,380 --> 01:44:01,100
that would be like just associating movies with mega shark versus giant octopus i bet

1489
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:08,500
ebert wouldn't appreciate that it i it still bugs me a little bit that he's choosing to

1490
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:15,220
maintain his level of ignorance rather than uh accept some enlightenment that's being

1491
01:44:15,220 --> 01:44:22,220
offered him that's what still bugs me he's refusing to be educated and that's a lot of

1492
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:26,540
people though that's that's a big failing of humanity that's what bugs me about a lot

1493
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:31,500
of people to be fair the guy's got a lot of other stuff to worry about i mean it's not

1494
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:38,740
no there's there's no way to be fair about it ignorance especially self-imposed ignorance

1495
01:44:38,740 --> 01:44:43,740
is to me unforgivable well at least he came out and said i was ignorant i shouldn't have

1496
01:44:43,740 --> 01:44:47,120
said anything i mean maybe he didn't say that but you know what i'm gonna choose to remain

1497
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:55,100
ignorant thank you very much have a good day shut up all right teach their own uh that's

1498
01:44:55,100 --> 01:45:00,380
it for the news but we can't end this segment just yet we've got to get to the classic video

1499
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:06,900
game of the week that's right here on the show we always take a few minutes to uh say

1500
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:12,060
hey why are you not uh admiring these games from the past you should take a moment to

1501
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:17,300
respect your elders and the elder games that came before you dark sakura what is tonight's

1502
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:21,680
classic game of the week i think the only way we can properly do this is to play the

1503
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:23,900
intro rob oh well i guess i can do that for you

1504
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:37,700
it's a very quiet intro just you know i don't even know if it's going through on the feed

1505
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:42,980
it's super super quiet well it's dragon's lair there you go so you want to get on to

1506
01:45:42,980 --> 01:45:46,980
the other stuff let me see if this one plays a little bit louder now i feel like i have

1507
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:52,260
to move right really quickly yeah this one plays a little better that's just um that's

1508
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:59,780
a complete uh perfect playthrough in hd so yeah the game is dragon's lair which i have

1509
01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:08,460
a bajillion copies of including the hd copy and i have it on sega cd and um but this game

1510
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:19,860
um was out on laserdisc animated by don bluth and um you um basically as each little section

1511
01:46:19,860 --> 01:46:26,300
play you'd have to um tap the right direction or the right button and it would bring it

1512
01:46:26,300 --> 01:46:33,400
up as a little flash on the screen so you'd have to move in the correct direction based

1513
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:38,460
on what it gave you and you'd have to be pretty fast i mean right at the beginning i mean

1514
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:44,100
i can't tell you how many times i fell through the damn um bridge right when you're walking

1515
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:51,740
into the the lair um it's also out on the iphone too just to say so um anyway about

1516
01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:57,500
the game you play as derk the daring to rescue princess daphne from the evil dragon slinge

1517
01:46:57,500 --> 01:47:05,380
and you go through it it's really straightforward also um this was one of the first arcade games

1518
01:47:05,380 --> 01:47:15,540
that cost 50 cents to play usually most the other games were a quarter of play and um

1519
01:47:15,540 --> 01:47:22,260
basically uh the game was inspired by the old text game adventure and so this is called

1520
01:47:22,260 --> 01:47:30,980
a graphic adventure um when uh the game came out it was basically a big sensation again

1521
01:47:30,980 --> 01:47:41,820
not just because of uh the fact that it was more expensive um but that uh it made games

1522
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:47,180
this the game itself shut down quite a bit because it was running on a laser disc yeah

1523
01:47:47,180 --> 01:47:52,860
they basically were overused and really broke down and it's actually one of the you know

1524
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:59,220
probably the most popular game of this type other ones that came out in um the uh series

1525
01:47:59,220 --> 01:48:05,580
there was uh space ace and dragon's lair 2 and even um there were a number of other ones

1526
01:48:05,580 --> 01:48:12,740
that were like that they even converted um the lupin movie the castle of cagliostro into

1527
01:48:12,740 --> 01:48:18,460
one called cliff jumper i don't think it was the same company i i can only remember getting

1528
01:48:18,460 --> 01:48:25,660
past the first three scenes in space ace the animation was so good i love space ace um

1529
01:48:25,660 --> 01:48:30,820
there's also dragon's lair 3d returned to the lair which is a 3d you know reinterpretation

1530
01:48:30,820 --> 01:48:40,940
of the game um they actually had um a dragon's lair movie scripted and ready to go into production

1531
01:48:40,940 --> 01:48:46,300
um right now though and they are doing this completely old school 2d animation but it's

1532
01:48:46,300 --> 01:48:53,980
um in held up in development right now there's a blu-ray version of dragon's lair um and

1533
01:48:53,980 --> 01:48:59,380
um they basically though had to completely go through and remaster everything clean the

1534
01:48:59,380 --> 01:49:04,180
cells themselves remember when they did the macross yeah um thing where they actually

1535
01:49:04,180 --> 01:49:10,680
extended the frames out to wider screens they're doing the same thing this this though is not

1536
01:49:10,680 --> 01:49:18,680
to be confused with the utterly horrible uh nes adaptation of dragon's lair this this

1537
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:22,540
is the good stuff right here i want to do an aside when jamie's done because there was

1538
01:49:22,540 --> 01:49:27,060
a home version i replayed a lot more of than the arcade game growing up but i'll get into

1539
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:33,660
that a minute um well there's also um you probably have heard princess daphne in the

1540
01:49:33,660 --> 01:49:38,660
background it doesn't really look very princess like she actually is just kind of ditzy and

1541
01:49:38,660 --> 01:49:45,220
just like a hoe she was like a who a who-er to quote my mother um but for all the other

1542
01:49:45,220 --> 01:49:54,500
versions that came there was um it was actually escaped from singe's castle which was a non-linear

1543
01:49:54,500 --> 01:50:02,220
version of it um there was a puzzle one um that came out on the old eight-bit systems

1544
01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:06,820
there is um the nes one the superness one called dragon's lair which was a platformer

1545
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:11,660
version also space ace had a platformer version um there was a game boy one called dragon's

1546
01:50:11,660 --> 01:50:18,620
lair the legend which really has nothing to do with it um it's actually a port of an old

1547
01:50:18,620 --> 01:50:25,080
zx spectrum game called roller coaster um the game boy color version is um actually

1548
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:31,280
pretty much like the original um there was dragon's lair deluxe pack there was um an

1549
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:36,900
apple version the sega cd version um so talking about the old mac one from 1994 and then the

1550
01:50:36,900 --> 01:50:44,020
emulator daphne um where you have to have the original laserdisc and the rom file to

1551
01:50:44,020 --> 01:50:49,420
be able to play that or they have other versions that use mpeg 2 video streams so yeah there

1552
01:50:49,420 --> 01:50:56,100
are a lot of versions out just looking over the list ever since 1983 we've had i'm just

1553
01:50:56,100 --> 01:51:02,860
going to run off the list of different systems it's been on okay okay we've had um the arcade

1554
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:14,260
uh clico adam armchair uh cpc the spectrum commodore 64 um do atari st the amiga um pc

1557
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:49,140
2 mobile phone um uh blu-ray player ps3 home hd dvd players iphone dsi for dsi where the

1558
01:51:49,140 --> 01:52:00,100
ds psp and the we as a disc so wow and also um it had um the character dirt was battling

1559
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:06,540
midlife crisis in an episode of robot chicken nice and part of the game was parodied in

1560
01:52:06,540 --> 01:52:12,540
family guy it was there really wasn't a lot like it i mean yeah there were those other

1561
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:15,980
games you mentioned but i can't think of a lot of games that were really like this ever

1562
01:52:15,980 --> 01:52:22,100
if you ever thought that the concept of the quick time event was new no no dragon's lair

1563
01:52:22,100 --> 01:52:29,700
did it way before so it was even quicker well if dark soccer we're at the end of the game

1564
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:33,740
if dark soccer is done with her piece i want to do a quick aside if i could um because

1565
01:52:33,740 --> 01:52:40,260
i played growing up an awful lot the commodore 64 versions of the game which were different

1566
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:44,380
they were let me see if we can get some of the music here this is kind of like the you

1567
01:52:44,380 --> 01:52:50,800
know it was much different it took scenes inspired by the arcade game and kind of made

1568
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:55,020
them like actiony things like here's that scene where the disc is kind of falling down

1569
01:52:55,020 --> 01:52:59,580
well instead of you know obviously they couldn't port the movie type stuff at the time so instead

1570
01:52:59,580 --> 01:53:03,380
they put in these little clouds and you'd have to run away as they're breathing air

1571
01:53:03,380 --> 01:53:09,260
this game was just as hard if not harder than the um uh arcade game that was out the snest

1572
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:14,300
one terribly hard the snest one was actually kind of difficult i hated the snest version

1573
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:18,900
of space ace by the way some of the music in um dragon's lair and then the sequel they

1574
01:53:18,900 --> 01:53:26,580
also had dragon's lair 2 escape from cinja's castle had awesome music listen to this oh

1575
01:53:26,580 --> 01:53:30,660
a little theme song got cut off hey it's the um the whole rapids area yeah the whole rapids

1576
01:53:30,660 --> 01:53:34,900
area but i love the music and the boulders area is awesome let me see if i can get to

1577
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:49,740
that part here we go this is pretty cool just i mean the soundtrack to this game was awesome

1578
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:53,900
and and you know it wasn't quite the arcade game but it was levels kind of inspired by

1579
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:57,720
the arcade game every bit as hard i mean if i were to play this today i would i would

1580
01:53:57,720 --> 01:54:01,760
not be able to get very far but yeah see you have to run past the things but you're slowly

1581
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:05,100
moving back the whole time and that's just you know one of the other stages and then

1582
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:11,060
later on you get into you know like here's that one room this is where the thing takes

1583
01:54:11,060 --> 01:54:15,420
your hat and your sword and this is a little more like the arcade version where you have

1584
01:54:15,420 --> 01:54:22,040
to hit up at certain times but the soundtrack was just awesome if you're into that whole

1585
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:26,540
old school sounding stuff so that's my little aside to the classic game of the week is that

1586
01:54:26,540 --> 01:54:29,760
the commodore 64 one is definitely worth your attention i just figured it was about time

1587
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:33,540
we did dragon's lair it really was i'm surprised it's been i mean we've been doing the classic

1588
01:54:33,540 --> 01:54:37,740
game of the week for a long time right i have had a feeling that i had already done it and

1589
01:54:37,740 --> 01:54:42,060

1640
01:59:14,300 --> 01:59:22,620
far um other fun stuff we may have talked about this a little bit i think i've mentioned

1649
02:00:14,580 --> 02:00:19,420
were talking about some psp games before the break and one of the psp games that's coming

1650
02:00:19,420 --> 02:00:24,500
out uh will actually be a port of split second and that'll be pretty awesome it's a cool

1651
02:00:24,500 --> 02:00:29,660
racing game where you get to detonate a bunch of explosions and causal sorts of mayhem and

1652

that'll be coming out this fall all right yet another port on its way to psp enjoy that

1653
02:00:37,820 --> 02:00:41,740
hey i got some quick stuff for you too dragon age 2 finally some details on that it was

1654
02:00:41,740 --> 02:00:47,180
missing from e3 but it's dated for march 2011 that's kind of conflicting to the february

1655
02:00:47,180 --> 02:00:52,460
1st 2011 date that was in the dragon age origins awakening but hey at least it's kind of close

1656
02:00:52,460 --> 02:00:57,420
march 2011 is when this is coming out big big change from the first game um you're gonna

1657
02:00:57,420 --> 02:01:02,660
be playing as one character named hawk and that could be either a male or a female but

1658
02:01:02,660 --> 02:01:06,600
no more of this like origin story and and all this other stuff that the first dragon

1659
02:01:06,600 --> 02:01:11,940
age had and you you're basically going to be this one character be it like uh mass effect

1660
02:01:11,940 --> 02:01:15,900
where you're commander shepherd yes my favorite store in the citadel there you go so it's

1661
02:01:15,900 --> 02:01:20,460
kind of the same type of thing um and i guess they're trying to do that to you know make

1662
02:01:20,460 --> 02:01:24,700
more cinematic type of stuff where they can kind of involve hawk and the cinematics is

1663
02:01:24,700 --> 02:01:31,420
supposed to actually address you by name exactly so uh that is um that's their big plans for

1664
02:01:31,420 --> 02:01:37,700
the game i i think that could be good um but i like the some some folks are suggesting

1665
02:01:37,700 --> 02:01:42,260
uh you know you could name your character like hudson hawk or ethan hawk or you know

1666
02:01:42,260 --> 02:01:48,500
all these other hudson hawk is good just not mike anyhow uh yeah so i i don't know

1667
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:51,980
i like the first game i'm curious kind of how the second game is going to play out it's

1668
02:01:51,980 --> 02:01:56,180
that definitely is a radical shift though i think uh the first being a little more open

1669
02:01:56,180 --> 02:01:59,820
in the first game really kind of drew a lot of people to that but i still think it'll

1670
02:01:59,820 --> 02:02:05,260
be cool another game i think will be cool that i want to play is nba jam and i'm actually

1671
02:02:05,260 --> 02:02:10,620
excited because according to the germans rating the german ratings board nba jam has been

1672
02:02:10,620 --> 02:02:16,340
classified for xbox 360 and ps3 now it's kind of weird because those weren't shown at e3

1673
02:02:16,340 --> 02:02:21,200
they haven't demoed it on those systems but you know these rating board stories usually

1674
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:26,380
turn out to be right they kind of have to have a game to rate it well here's my thought

1675
02:02:26,380 --> 02:02:33,100
is that what if it's the old nba jam or something like that like coming to xbox live arcade

1676
02:02:33,100 --> 02:02:38,340
possible i doubt it but i mean yeah i could run into licensing issues and all that stuff

1677
02:02:38,340 --> 02:02:42,620
but maybe it's a port of the old arcade although then again i guess midway would have that

1678
02:02:42,620 --> 02:02:48,460
and you know now there's no midway maybe it's a little harder than that i don't know but

1679
02:02:48,460 --> 02:02:53,500
uh do you remember we were talking on this show before about the nba jam catchphrase

1680
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:59,540
competition and folks can submit their own catchphrases well it's boom shaka laka well

1681
02:02:59,540 --> 02:03:04,220
that's already in the game but you have to come up with the next boom shaka laka and

1682
02:03:04,220 --> 02:03:12,220
uh these are the i guess the four that made it into the game i think um objections sustained

1683
02:03:12,220 --> 02:03:21,940
when you get a block shot no shoot for you i love it uh and the survey says denied on

1684
02:03:21,940 --> 02:03:27,580
a block and then uh i have no idea where this one comes from banga langadooda for a dunk

1685
02:03:27,580 --> 02:03:35,660
say what banga langadooda probably from the same place that boom shaka laka came from

1686
02:03:35,660 --> 02:03:39,140
i don't know it's kind of like the sequel the reject i'd like to hear a little less

1687
02:03:39,140 --> 02:03:44,900
a song made out of boom shaka laka and banga langadooda sounds like the singers in an 80s

1688
02:03:44,900 --> 02:03:51,020
hair band i don't know all right uh moving on sounds like shana a little more information

1689
02:03:51,020 --> 02:03:55,260
is coming out about the michael jackson based video game it's going to be called michael

1690
02:03:55,260 --> 02:04:01,660
jackson the experience and you will actually be able to play as michael jackson and you

1691
02:04:01,660 --> 02:04:06,980
get to relive his iconic performances and that would be using the move the connect or

1692
02:04:06,980 --> 02:04:10,980
the we and you're basically going to dance along with the prompts on the screen you can

1693
02:04:10,980 --> 02:04:16,300
also sing along on the xbox 360 or playstation 3 you can use the connects built-in mic to

1694
02:04:16,300 --> 02:04:21,420
do this there's also going to be ds and psp versions of this game it's going to be tapping

1695
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:26,140
think elite beat agents that's kind of cool it's coming out in november if you want to

1696
02:04:26,140 --> 02:04:30,280
check this game out and boy would i pay a lot of money for youtubes of loki playing

1697
02:04:30,280 --> 02:04:35,700
this game we've already had a good michael jackson based game it was called moonwalker

1698
02:04:35,700 --> 02:04:42,180
i thought you said a good game oh it was a good game oh it depends what system you played

1699
02:04:42,180 --> 02:04:49,360
it on depends what system you played on all right i don't know i i would my favorite michael

1700
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:53,560
jackson video game was space channel 5 i don't know about you that was a cameo that doesn't

1701
02:04:53,560 --> 02:04:59,080
count still i'd rather play space channel 5 than just mimic him you know what i mean

1702
02:04:59,080 --> 02:05:04,140
like i don't know there's just i would i hope there's more to it than that but we'll see

1703
02:05:04,140 --> 02:05:14,140
dark sakura well we have some definite news in our music games we have for a rock band

02:05:47,940 --> 02:05:54,580
whoo buck 99 and um for dj hero we actually have some good news that the sales are up

1710
02:05:54,580 --> 02:06:00,580
to 1.2 million units that's pretty good even though i've seen them clearance at fries well

1711
02:06:00,580 --> 02:06:06,740
so much for all y'all who said it was a flop you know what it took price reduction but

1712
02:06:06,740 --> 02:06:13,180
um it was actually considered considered the best-selling ip of 2009 by revenue yeah keyword

1713
02:06:13,180 --> 02:06:18,580
is by revenue because they're like 100 and some dollars each yeah but wait to spin those

1714
02:06:18,580 --> 02:06:22,820
really start selling till it had a big price drop and then it started selling yeah at least

1715
02:06:22,820 --> 02:06:26,620
they've figured it out for the next release so they're not going to be charging quite

1716
02:06:26,620 --> 02:06:32,380
as much it's going to be a little bit more like guitar hero prices still expensive well

1717
02:06:32,380 --> 02:06:36,800
speaking of guitar hero we actually do have download music for guitar hero 5 and band

1718
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:42,340
hero we have the queen 2 track pack which is crazy little thing called love killer queen

1721
02:06:54,020 --> 02:07:00,540
trick and indestructible whatever that's my impression of disturbed except for the really

1722
02:07:00,540 --> 02:07:09,900
good cover i thought it was it's just what it is except they did a really good cover

1723
02:07:09,900 --> 02:07:15,780
of land of confusion a really good song um and then shine down on july 27th with devour

1724
02:07:15,780 --> 02:07:21,820
second chance sound of madness all i heard was queen and everything after that was blah

1725
02:07:21,820 --> 02:07:29,020
blah blah i know it's queen all right if that's it for the rapid fire news then i think it

1726
02:07:29,020 --> 02:07:36,340
might be time for us to get into some twitter topics every week we ask for your tweets at

1727
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:42,340
twitter.com slash o l r and we read some of our favorite tweets here on the program we

1728
02:07:42,340 --> 02:07:47,100
didn't we hardly got any tonight maybe i wasn't soliciting early enough in advance oh well

1729
02:07:47,100 --> 02:07:51,340
uh you can always count on tiger claws submit a few good stories so tiger claw 305 on twitter

1730
02:07:51,340 --> 02:07:57,320
sends us a few stories here um i like this one this has to do with google and i had no

1731
02:07:57,320 --> 02:08:01,620
idea about this until tiger claw uh kind of linked this and this has to do with a big

1732
02:08:01,620 --> 02:08:08,380
investment that google uh made in zinga apparently according to this report and i'm reading from

1733
02:08:08,380 --> 02:08:15,700
gamasutra here google quietly invested between 100 million and 200 million in zinga as part

1734
02:08:15,700 --> 02:08:21,580
of its preparation to launch google games later this year because you know google's

1735
02:08:21,580 --> 02:08:28,820
got to get all up on everything whatever happened to google's philosophy of don't be evil google

1736
02:08:28,820 --> 02:08:34,900
zinga no that's true zinga's kind of evil but i i would be curious how it would operate

1737
02:08:34,900 --> 02:08:39,060
into google's philosophy i don't know but here's uh google itself apparently closed

1738
02:08:39,060 --> 02:08:43,060
the investment and it happened about a month ago and that was on a report from tech crunch

1739
02:08:43,060 --> 02:08:48,260
um part of the partnership will entail zinga's games serving as the cornerstone for search

1740
02:08:48,260 --> 02:08:54,100
giant google games platform which is rumored to launch later this year they haven't said

1741
02:08:54,100 --> 02:08:58,740
any information about it uh what's interesting though that doesn't necessarily mean you're

1742
02:08:58,740 --> 02:09:03,860
just going to have farmville frontierville and fishville and what the fuckville all on

1743
02:09:03,860 --> 02:09:11,480
google games i love what the fuckville stripperville who wouldn't play stripperville hornville needs

1744
02:09:11,480 --> 02:09:21,220
bounce houses maybe there will be new games that come on to google games who knows if

1745
02:09:21,220 --> 02:09:26,420
if there's anyone that they would want to invest in you know better options i would

1746
02:09:26,420 --> 02:09:32,780
say i don't know congregate much better place and you know well i'm just saying much better

1747
02:09:32,780 --> 02:09:39,020
developers too how many freaking people are playing farmville a lot a lot more than we're

1748
02:09:39,020 --> 02:09:43,740
playing wow right i know hate if you want but this is it's just like it's just like

1749
02:09:43,740 --> 02:09:48,140
hating on the we you can hate it all you want at the end of the day it's still the most

1750
02:09:48,140 --> 02:09:55,780
popular selling system you can't that is a fact you facebook isn't even a gaming system

1751
02:09:55,780 --> 02:10:01,300
but more people play games there than they do on consoles probably i don't have those

1752
02:10:01,300 --> 02:10:05,500
numbers to back it up but i'm pretty sure uh when you add up all those uh soccer moms

1753
02:10:05,500 --> 02:10:09,820
playing farmville yeah it's probably more than her fragging on the halo 3 sorry to say

1754
02:10:09,820 --> 02:10:19,000
it that's just how it is i i work with a lot of people that play these games a lot of co-workers

1755
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:25,640
but you know they don't really know the video games i play it's just i don't know crazy

1756
02:10:25,640 --> 02:10:29,300
i'd be i'd be very curious to see how this all plays out though with google games because

1757
02:10:29,300 --> 02:10:33,420
of the fact that you know google has this philosophy of don't be evil but then again

1758
02:10:33,420 --> 02:10:38,500
buzz was kind of evil like there was some they made some horrible missteps with buzz

1759
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:44,140
i wish internet companies would just learn their freaking lesson with privacy don't you

1760
02:10:44,140 --> 02:10:49,860
one more from tiger claw for us as i uh want to mention this steve weeby you remember him

1761
02:10:49,860 --> 02:10:54,940
the king of kong did he finally get it well no but he got something else that's pretty

1762
02:10:54,940 --> 02:10:59,320
cool um he's going to be inducted into the international video game hall of fame cool

1763
02:10:59,320 --> 02:11:04,540
and uh don't forget it's that doctor or dentist guy hank chien has it now it's not even billy

1764
02:11:04,540 --> 02:11:08,700
mitchell remember a few few months ago that doctor or dentist or whatever he's in he's

1765
02:11:08,700 --> 02:11:14,660
the king of kong now well anyhow steve weeby though um he's you know still uh he's still

1766
02:11:14,660 --> 02:11:19,180
obviously acknowledged as a great gamer um he's going to be joining 28 other people including

1767
02:11:19,180 --> 02:11:29,980
miyamoto and pac-man that's going to be uh i guess built in get this otuma otumwa iowa

1768
02:11:29,980 --> 02:11:34,340
ottumwa iowa i can't even pronounce this name but you may have heard of this uh city before

1769
02:11:34,340 --> 02:11:37,700
this is where they're trying to build the international video game hall of fame they

1770
02:11:37,700 --> 02:11:42,800
want to make this place like the video game capital or whatever i don't and i don't remember

1771
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:46,300
all the stories behind it but it wasn't there was like a really famous photo shoot back

1772
02:11:46,300 --> 02:11:51,060
in the 80s that took place there i remember hearing about and i don't know just it's just

1773
02:11:51,060 --> 02:11:56,460
because no one's claimed it yet so this town that has nobody there's no reason to go there

1774
02:11:56,460 --> 02:12:01,900
there's a story behind it i'm sure there is and i don't care what it is but i i refuse

1775
02:12:01,900 --> 02:12:05,420
to believe that you're going to be the capital of shatter a chatter will fill me in well

1776
02:12:05,420 --> 02:12:09,900
the part i remember was that you can't even reach it unless it's like a three-hour drive

1777
02:12:09,900 --> 02:12:17,260
from a nearby airport i mean that's something else it's iowa yeah someday i will make claim

1778
02:12:17,260 --> 02:12:21,940
to that same thing and do it better monty boggs says that's inside the international

1779
02:12:21,940 --> 02:12:28,120
house of pancakes actually is the international house of gaming frisbee asks isn't that the

1780
02:12:28,120 --> 02:12:33,940
home of twin galaxies uh could be that might be the connection i'm not sure i always thought

1781
02:12:33,940 --> 02:12:38,620
the guy from twin galaxies had an office i don't know why pennsylvania jumps out of my

1782
02:12:38,620 --> 02:12:43,660
mind but it does or somewhere in silicon silicon valley at least i don't know anyhow sponge

1783
02:12:43,660 --> 02:12:48,780
twang uh since it's a tweet uh clarifying some stuff about the big battle um apparently

1784
02:12:48,780 --> 02:12:53,940
the battlefield bad company 2 competition was rescheduled also he has noticed a super

1785
02:12:53,940 --> 02:12:57,740
street fighter 4 banner has leaked its way into the rotation so i don't know if derek

1786
02:12:57,740 --> 02:13:02,100
just hasn't announced anything yet but it looks like your super street fighter 4 might

1787
02:13:02,100 --> 02:13:07,140
be uh be able to battle on that now i know you kids play that game so you got to get

1788
02:13:07,140 --> 02:13:10,780
it on that if i was super enough for that i'd join in but i don't have super street

1789
02:13:10,780 --> 02:13:15,180
fighter 4 it doesn't you know oh okay i was gonna say i'm terrible at super street fighter

1790
02:13:15,180 --> 02:13:19,060
4 but if that's one of the games i'll play it just just to do it you know it's not about

1791
02:13:19,060 --> 02:13:25,760
winning it's about having fun i put dan the man up on top of the charts s21 under matt

1792
02:13:25,760 --> 02:13:31,460
says that he thinks it's the hometown of walter day won't why does that make it the capital

1793
02:13:31,460 --> 02:13:37,580
of video oh whatever that's a whole other rant uh dark tetsuya last tweet says uh since

1794
02:13:37,580 --> 02:13:44,100
i didn't hear anything in part a thoughts on ddr x2 ac oh yeah i haven't played it yet

1795
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:47,100
but i don't think it's out there yet i think it's still being tested apparently a bunch

1796
02:13:47,100 --> 02:13:51,940
of old school dance mania tracks came back like captain jack is back in the game if you

1797
02:13:51,940 --> 02:13:55,860
were here by jennifer is back in the game like all these old ass ddr songs are now back

1798
02:13:55,860 --> 02:14:02,620

02:15:01,180 --> 02:15:09,700
crunchyroll and apparently the expansion is going to be a partnership with microsoft for

1809
02:15:09,700 --> 02:15:15,380
the zune marketplace and this will bring a popular anime title such as the melancholy

of um haruhi uh suzamiya and the and uh giant killing to the xbox 360 zune hd and windows

1811
02:15:24,860 --> 02:15:31,340
pcs and um that's kind of neat i guess giant killing is notable because it's airing in

1812
02:15:31,340 --> 02:15:38,460
japan right now and this will be the uh first time these title have been available for digital

1813

1893
02:23:54,060 --> 02:23:58,700
moment tiger oh and i didn't even bother to cut it at the perforation i just pulled it

1894
02:23:58,700 --> 02:24:03,160

02:24:03,160 --> 02:24:09,900
would have uranus no i can i can think of other podcasts i can have that all right anyhow

1896
02:24:09,900 --> 02:24:15,420
let's move on uh i want to talk about back to gaming news i know hard to believe let's

1897
02:24:15,420 --> 02:24:20,900
talk about this this has to do with connectimals you know you guys connectimals they're cute

1898
02:24:20,900 --> 02:24:26,960
you know cuddly and uh you're gonna soon find out more about them at burger king that's

1899
02:24:26,960 --> 02:24:31,740
right not only is microsoft and it's kind of a side story apparently microsoft is teaming

1900
02:24:31,740 --> 02:24:37,420
up with macy's to show connect certain places they're also going to be teaming up with burger

1901
02:24:37,420 --> 02:24:43,320
king uh so you're going to actually get little stuffed animals that can be scanned by the

1902
02:24:43,320 --> 02:24:49,780
connects camera to create the same animal in the game and then you can have them interact

1903
02:24:49,780 --> 02:24:56,200
with your regular pet connectimal and there you go so so instead of the bk games we were

1904
02:24:56,200 --> 02:24:59,980
hearing about now you're going to get little mini connectimals or whatever the problem

1905
02:24:59,980 --> 02:25:05,260
is it's just going to be a little card that will easily be scanned and posted on the internet

1906
02:25:05,260 --> 02:25:09,820
so you don't even have to buy these if they were smart since the connect can you scan

1907
02:25:09,820 --> 02:25:13,740
in objects they should actually do the stuffed animal like you'd have to actually have a

1908
02:25:13,740 --> 02:25:19,180
picture of the stuffed animal well i mean how long is it going to be though before there's

1909
02:25:19,180 --> 02:25:24,520
just an internet page with all the barcodes so after you stuff your face with a triple

1910
02:25:24,520 --> 02:25:28,800
whopper you can go and move around a little bit on connect that's what i love about this

1911
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:32,660
i mean at least it's connectimals and not dance central but that would crack me up if

1912
02:25:32,660 --> 02:25:37,380
like dance central had a tie-in with burger king this was like the old barcode scanner

1913
02:25:37,380 --> 02:25:42,820
games that were out in japan remember it was like one particular brand of ramen was like

1914
02:25:42,820 --> 02:25:47,420
would make these this ultimate monster and everyone was buying out this one brand of

1915
02:25:47,420 --> 02:25:56,060
ramen e reader for life they did the same thing with vivo pinata and um in fact people

1916
02:25:56,060 --> 02:26:00,900
started hacking the actual codes and unlocked more animals that didn't they didn't give

1917
02:26:00,900 --> 02:26:07,580
away um you know stuff that wasn't in the game so or at least it was in the game but

1918
02:26:07,580 --> 02:26:13,660
never released for the game interesting though microsoft is very aggressive with the marketing

1919
02:26:13,660 --> 02:26:19,460
for this thing they really really want it to take off i mean burger king macy's and

1920
02:26:19,460 --> 02:26:27,820
you know in their own stores whereas you know what's where's playstation move advertising

1921
02:26:27,820 --> 02:26:31,780
granted it's a little early so maybe a little closer to release we'll see a more accelerated

1922
02:26:31,780 --> 02:26:38,380
campaign maybe commercials on tv and all that other fun stuff but so far microsoft is definitely

1923
02:26:38,380 --> 02:26:41,760
getting aggressive with this but they kind of have to be i mean if connect fails that's

1924
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:47,940
going to be a real sad little footnote in microsoft's history we'll see though meanwhile

1925
02:26:47,940 --> 02:26:54,620
dark sakura i i i i am just still laughing because i put the picture oh did you use the

1926
02:26:54,620 --> 02:27:01,900
picture i put it in the chat room nice appreciate that oh our plushies all right so now you

1927
02:27:01,900 --> 02:27:05,360
know it's official you're listening to the official video game podcast of the galaxy

1928
02:27:05,360 --> 02:27:10,560
well rock band three has decided to do something nice for all those people who can't hold a

1929
02:27:10,560 --> 02:27:23,340
tune to save their fucking life um it um has uh harmonics and uh isotope um have uh done

1930
02:27:23,340 --> 02:27:29,540
a real-time pitch correction basically they have autotune um it's gonna put everybody

1931
02:27:29,540 --> 02:27:33,980
into the right key when it plays through so that they don't sound like crap now what i

1932
02:27:33,980 --> 02:27:38,060
want to do i have this one friend who actually have a couple friends who are intensely tone

1933
02:27:38,060 --> 02:27:48,200
deaf enough that it makes my um my liver quiver um that rhymed i know but um i would like

1934
02:27:48,200 --> 02:27:54,600
to see if actually can make these people who are so unbelievably tone deaf hold a key is

1935
02:27:54,600 --> 02:28:00,640
i don't know if anyone knows this little fact about me i hear perfect pitch and it drives

1936
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:06,180
me completely nuts because it's even worse when i sing and hear myself got a tune i listening

1937
02:28:06,180 --> 02:28:13,580
to somebody else go just cannot being able to hold a tune makes me nauseous literally

1938
02:28:13,580 --> 02:28:19,620
nauseous um how do you feel about this then where everybody's gonna be fixed on the on

1939
02:28:19,620 --> 02:28:25,660
the fly i love you harmonics and isotope but you know you know it's not gonna fix the fact

1940
02:28:25,660 --> 02:28:30,780
that you can still hear them in the same yeah they're still gonna make things sound horrible

1941
02:28:30,780 --> 02:28:35,420
anyway it's not a really an autotune it's more of a because they actually do have autotuners

1942
02:28:35,420 --> 02:28:42,660
that aren't the the digital sounding autotune they'll do wave modulation plus i think if

1943
02:28:42,660 --> 02:28:46,020
you want to get really into the science of it and all autotunes like a post-production

1944
02:28:46,020 --> 02:28:51,260
thing and this is a in production basically they're available in almost any recording

1945
02:28:51,260 --> 02:28:57,020
studio i mean how come do you think some people just sound like crap live it's a bummer though

1946
02:28:57,020 --> 02:29:00,140
you're not going to be able to hear the voices over the internet i mean at the same time

1947
02:29:00,140 --> 02:29:02,980
maybe that's a blessing but i think there's some people that wouldn't mind you know being

1948
02:29:02,980 --> 02:29:06,320
able to sing i understand that with the lag and the time and everything it's probably

1949
02:29:06,320 --> 02:29:11,600
not possible although what would be wrong with maybe having the singer start five seconds

1950
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:15,380
before the rest of the band just well i guess i guess maybe with the scoring system wouldn't

1951
02:29:15,380 --> 02:29:22,200
really work out i really have the voice play on a replay hmm maybe i really though um i

1952
02:29:22,200 --> 02:29:26,820
think it would be nice if this is an option that you could turn off but certainly you

1953
02:29:26,820 --> 02:29:31,300
know i think that the option to turn it on should be on the other player's side if you're

1954
02:29:31,300 --> 02:29:35,640
doing this on the internet for people like me who can't stand to listen to people be

1955
02:29:35,640 --> 02:29:40,700
out of tune i don't think they actually do a person's voice over the internet for like

1956
02:29:40,700 --> 02:29:45,020
rock band because it can't they don't have the bandwidth to stream that which is the

1957
02:29:45,020 --> 02:29:50,360
problem um so you never hear voices you do hear guitar and stuff but you never hear voice

1958
02:29:50,360 --> 02:29:54,660
well because the guitar is just bits and bytes on or off pass or fail basically but uh voice

1959
02:29:54,660 --> 02:29:59,940
is it's too much bandwidth for it to handle although you could always just do party chat

1960
02:29:59,940 --> 02:30:03,660
and do it that way but you know true you know one little bit it'll be delayed it's it's

1961
02:30:03,660 --> 02:30:07,780
because i've played rock band with a singer who didn't put their mic their regular mic

1962
02:30:07,780 --> 02:30:11,700
on mute and it was delayed and it actually can really throw you off when you're trying

1963
02:30:11,700 --> 02:30:16,740
to play guitar or something else um one thing i had predicted for rock band three that didn't

1964
02:30:16,740 --> 02:30:20,240
end up happening or at least not yet anyway was that they were going to go more the sing

1965
02:30:20,240 --> 02:30:24,740
star route of being able to share your performances and being able to you know have that community

1966
02:30:24,740 --> 02:30:29,960
of uh your youtube-esque uh sharing of performances who knows maybe that's still in the cards

1967
02:30:29,960 --> 02:30:33,800
for the future although i kind of doubt it at this point um this would have kind of added

1968
02:30:33,800 --> 02:30:38,220
to that though in a way a little more professional touch to it i'll tell you one thing i actually

1969
02:30:38,220 --> 02:30:44,580
did like about um rock band is at least playing it on easier difficulties it gives a person

1970
02:30:44,580 --> 02:30:51,060
who is actually a singer more room to have fun with the song like for example you've

1971
02:30:51,060 --> 02:30:58,180
heard becky sing i'm not sure maybe like once so like a rock band thing but she's got a

1972
02:30:58,180 --> 02:31:02,860
crazy powerful voice she's a little more classically trained right i can't remember she does she

1973
02:31:02,860 --> 02:31:07,300
does tend to edge more towards the classically trim but she can belt them out she can she

1974
02:31:07,300 --> 02:31:13,140
can really sing she's got a great voice and i i like having things at the lower level

1975
02:31:13,140 --> 02:31:16,660
you know when she's playing because then it won't make her fail the song for having fun

1976
02:31:16,660 --> 02:31:21,580
with it i can see donna just ask the listeners of understation live no i can't believe that

1977
02:31:21,580 --> 02:31:28,180
you and tiara got me singing abba rock band oh that was fun and that i actually did listening

1978
02:31:28,180 --> 02:31:33,940
i don't think so tiara tiara tiara come back to sacramento because we need to make jamie

1979
02:31:33,940 --> 02:31:37,500
play abba it was not abba rock band by the way sing star abba that's what i was talking

1980
02:31:37,500 --> 02:31:43,100
about sing star abba i just can't believe that i actually did good at it it's fun yeah

1981
02:31:43,100 --> 02:31:47,820
i need to get uh sing star queen now that it's uh discounted i would play that but you're

1982
02:31:47,820 --> 02:31:53,140
right expert doesn't give a lot of leeway for stuff like i don't know vibrato no but

1983
02:31:53,140 --> 02:31:57,700
you know um remember when karaoke revolution was coming out and how it was pretty forgiving

1984
02:31:57,700 --> 02:32:03,240
here the japanese versions because i've had friends who had the japanese versions they

1985
02:32:03,240 --> 02:32:09,300
are evil that you have to pronounce everything perfectly you have to be dead pitch on you

1986
02:32:09,300 --> 02:32:13,200
can't just mumble your way through it and as long as you hit the key you're fine you

1987
02:32:13,200 --> 02:32:17,460
actually have to fully pronounce everything right because japanese itself can be pretty

1988
02:32:17,460 --> 02:32:23,380
precise i played that terrible karaoke revolution glee game that was at e3 it was very forgiving

1989
02:32:23,380 --> 02:32:27,820
granted i was playing it on the easiest level but you you could just uh your way through

1990
02:32:27,820 --> 02:32:32,020
it and probably pass it see this one thing that i was thinking about in with the different

1991
02:32:32,020 --> 02:32:36,460
games you know from area to area where you have because i'd have to say japanese is a

1992
02:32:36,460 --> 02:32:43,020
very precise language really english especially american english i'm sorry is just well english

1993
02:32:43,020 --> 02:32:50,040
all over the place is just has so many variables that i really think that they they even the

1994
02:32:50,040 --> 02:32:56,340
harder difficulties of them should have more of a allowance i am really curious to see

1995
02:32:56,340 --> 02:32:59,620
how this new vocal system plays out though i'm really interested too because i know i'm

1996
02:32:59,620 --> 02:33:04,100
probably gonna get it yeah i know i gotta get rock band rock band's awesome uh all right

1997
02:33:04,100 --> 02:33:07,660
couple more stories for you guys than the mailbag and the fus of the week and then the

1998
02:33:07,660 --> 02:33:12,620
skype line your call is a 1877 game olr and a little bit here at orange lounge radio but

1999
02:33:12,620 --> 02:33:19,180
first some news from loki uh yes dead rising 2 they've announced a special edition for

2000
02:33:19,180 --> 02:33:24,900
europe uh called the outbreak pack and uh with it you're gonna be getting uh some pretty

2001
02:33:24,900 --> 02:33:32,060
cool tchotchkes actually it looks like a zombie figurine a surf bot head which i'm only assuming

2002
02:33:32,060 --> 02:33:37,960
goes on the zombie and a cone which also can go on the head of the zombie i'm assuming

2003
02:33:37,960 --> 02:33:47,460
and um looks like uh let's see a voucher for a premium theme and some other console specific

2004
02:33:47,460 --> 02:33:52,900
items as well i do love the little surf bot head for the zombie that's that's pretty awesome

2005
02:33:52,900 --> 02:33:58,540
it is pretty awesome um of course they announced that this is not coming out over here of course

2006
02:33:58,540 --> 02:34:03,580
not at all thankfully though we do have something coming out over here and this hasn't really

2007
02:34:03,580 --> 02:34:09,980
been announced yet but i do know what's actually in the special edition it's not that exciting

2008
02:34:09,980 --> 02:34:15,620
actually it's kind of standard special edition fair a lot of zombrex um theme stuff you know

2009
02:34:15,620 --> 02:34:23,140
zombrex being the actual i don't know if it's the virus or the you know anti-zombie medication

2010
02:34:23,140 --> 02:34:27,480
or something but a lot of stuff kind of based on that you get a prescription pad which i'm

2011
02:34:27,480 --> 02:34:35,020
assuming is just a notepad uh you get an investor's brochure uh which is kind of funny uh you

2012
02:34:35,020 --> 02:34:45,340
get a poster um also you get a avatar item for the xbox 360 version and a premium dynamic

2013
02:34:45,340 --> 02:34:52,280
theme for the playstation 3 version uh behind the scenes documentary of the making of dead

2014
02:34:52,280 --> 02:34:58,460
rising 2 and then of course the whole thing comes in a steelbook case that slips on um

2015
02:34:58,460 --> 02:35:07,160
the actual game so i'll be coming out the end of september now for 79.99 oh that's a

2016
02:35:07,160 --> 02:35:11,880
lot of money for a game i guess you get all that other cool stuff with it but still i

2017
02:35:11,880 --> 02:35:15,260
didn't you know i liked dead rising 1 but i really didn't play enough of it that's one

2018
02:35:15,260 --> 02:35:19,140
of those games i really need to go back and revisit because pretty cool and dead rising

2019
02:35:19,140 --> 02:35:24,300
2 is kind of more the same but not in a bad way like crackdown 2 people are making selling

2020
02:35:24,300 --> 02:35:27,500
more of the same it's kind of a bad thing but i had a lot of fun with it i'm surprised

2021
02:35:27,500 --> 02:35:32,380
they didn't put dead rising like theme duct tape or something like that in there because

2022
02:35:32,380 --> 02:35:38,040
you know the main part of the game is actually yeah yeah yeah i think i saw what i see a

2023
02:35:38,040 --> 02:35:44,180
baseball bat get duct taped with nails on the demo i played pretty cool okay uh i want

2024
02:35:44,180 --> 02:35:48,620
to talk about this that uh was floating around some of the blogs this week and it made designer

2025
02:35:48,620 --> 02:35:53,660
ben marsh a little bit famous this week because these aren't real okay guys but he put out

2026
02:35:53,660 --> 02:36:01,300
some designs there for video game condoms that's right it's video game packaging themed

2027
02:36:01,300 --> 02:36:11,460
condoms with such lovely names as donkey schlong and dong like pong but dong uh sextress um

2028
02:36:11,460 --> 02:36:15,200
the long dick of zelda i think that says i can't really see what this says super mario

2029
02:36:15,200 --> 02:36:21,240
land of love all these lovely little uh video game themed and i love this there's like little

2030
02:36:21,240 --> 02:36:26,640
variety packs there they have but kind of a serious theme here to this because uh he

2031
02:36:26,640 --> 02:36:32,580
says here the packaging aims to create a desire to purchase the product for aesthetic reasons

2032
02:36:32,580 --> 02:36:41,020
rather than the necessity of condoms simply by owning the product safer sex is promoted

2033
02:36:41,020 --> 02:36:46,020
interesting i did does anyone have a feeling on this do you think this would promote safe

2034
02:36:46,020 --> 02:36:50,220
sex because people buy it for the joke of it but then like you know if the time comes

2035
02:36:50,220 --> 02:36:57,580
where it's time to go iraq and hey you're prepared um it would never fly in the first

2036
02:36:57,580 --> 02:37:01,180
place because the game companies would never let this be you know put out but assuming

2037
02:37:01,180 --> 02:37:07,220
that he was able to create a generic enough concept um i suppose people might buy that

2038
02:37:07,220 --> 02:37:14,860
um but at the same time you know you don't see a lot of gaming related stuff to sex selling

2039
02:37:14,860 --> 02:37:19,980
i mean you don't see a lot of people buying you know the fake vaginas for those um you

2040
02:37:19,980 --> 02:37:24,300
know sex games that they have in japan you'll see people's stories hey look at that that's

2041
02:37:24,300 --> 02:37:29,100
from a game you know people look at you funny um as people would look at you funny if you

2042
02:37:29,100 --> 02:37:37,340
had a box for you know donkey schlong on your your bone zone too bone zone too yeah um it'd

2043
02:37:37,340 --> 02:37:42,780
be fun gag gifts for people but it would never make it past the stigma that gamers don't

2044
02:37:42,780 --> 02:37:47,260
get laid yeah that whole gag gift thing i could see myself getting like eight boxes

2045
02:37:47,260 --> 02:37:55,460
of these for my birthday and it would be like it was funny the first time seven of them

2046
02:37:55,460 --> 02:38:02,540
would be from loki no you know what i mean though sometimes with gag gifts if there's

2047
02:38:02,540 --> 02:38:06,140
like a certain one that speaks to you like i'll tell you this one time for christmas

2048
02:38:06,140 --> 02:38:13,860
i kid you not i got the survivor board game three times sure did the hell got the survivor

2049
02:38:13,860 --> 02:38:17,620
board game three times one christmas the the first year survivor was big and everyone knew

2050
02:38:17,620 --> 02:38:23,420
i watched it every week so all right how about we get to another segment here on the show

2055
02:38:48,020 --> 02:38:52,320
at orange lounge radio dot com by the way i want to say real quick akuma jp says he's

2056
02:38:52,320 --> 02:38:59,620
actually seen these in akihabara akihabara i'm sorry to say they're wrong okay that'd

2057
02:38:59,620 --> 02:39:05,980
be that big tech store in japan there's a whole it's it's a section of it's a district

2058
02:39:05,980 --> 02:39:14,340
oh okay yeah nice anyway hey olr crew azhp here i'm sure rob has got this on show roll

2059
02:39:14,340 --> 02:39:18,620
but i had to throw my two cents in for what it's worth blizzard is going to use real id

2060
02:39:18,620 --> 02:39:23,500
for their forums now yeah we already bypassed that but here's i'm going to continue here's

2061
02:39:23,500 --> 02:39:27,900
a quote from blizzard removing the veil of anonymity typical to online dialogue will

2062
02:39:27,900 --> 02:39:32,260
contribute to a more positive form environment promote constructive conversations and connect

2063
02:39:32,260 --> 02:39:36,540
the blizzard community in ways they haven't been connected before really do they think

2064
02:39:36,540 --> 02:39:39,980
that flamers will stop just because their name is being shown belligerent people will

2065
02:39:39,980 --> 02:39:44,300
still be belligerent only now they'll know just who they are arguing with and can go

2066
02:39:44,300 --> 02:39:49,620
to their house and stab them if they don't agree anyway i thought the point of wow was

2067
02:39:49,620 --> 02:39:53,760
that you could get away from your real life not have it follow you around and haunt your

2068
02:39:53,760 --> 02:39:58,380
every move and wow what if i don't want my co-workers knowing that i post on the wow

2069
02:39:58,380 --> 02:40:03,460
forums while i'm supposed to be on the clock not that i do i don't even play wow excuse

2070
02:40:03,460 --> 02:40:09,780
me this is just ridiculous and i have a feeling that this move is going to be one of the worst

2071
02:40:09,780 --> 02:40:13,460
blizzard has ever made just wondering what you guys think about this travesty i hope

2072
02:40:13,460 --> 02:40:17,500
i'll hope it all goes away soon yours truly is hp written and sent while i'm supposed

2073
02:40:17,500 --> 02:40:22,660
to be on the clock ps this will make dark sakura laugh or cry i'm not sure which basically

2074
02:40:22,660 --> 02:40:28,740
the biggest travesty in superhero mashups ever make sure she sees this on the show okay

2075
02:40:28,740 --> 02:40:36,580
all right oh it's clearly is it a video oh no it's a what it's a toy box i'm trying

2076
02:40:36,580 --> 02:40:42,980
to describe this on the radio bootleg superheroes superheroes justice league with spider-man

2077
02:40:42,980 --> 02:40:50,300
batman naruto naruto and iron man iron man all together malfunction malfunction does

2078
02:40:50,300 --> 02:40:55,380
not compute what the fuck by the way i have to commend you on your mostly perfect grammar

2079
02:40:55,380 --> 02:40:59,020
and spelling actually your spelling was pretty pretty good i think everybody missed a couple

2080
02:40:59,020 --> 02:41:03,180
of punctuation points i think everybody can agree that naruto is the greatest superhero

2081
02:41:03,180 --> 02:41:08,940
ever known can i find something you throw it loki where's the triple throw the triple

2082
02:41:08,940 --> 02:41:15,220
i prefer goddamn batman on twitter actually i don't know if you've ever seen goddamn batman's

2083
02:41:15,220 --> 02:41:19,340
and then there's gosh dang robin or something like that he's a goddamn batman there's goddamn

2084
02:41:19,340 --> 02:41:25,260
batman and gosh dang robin we can't forget the juggernaut bitch all righty how obviously

2085
02:41:25,260 --> 02:41:30,740
we already kind of ran it about real id early in the show but thankfully uh azhp the that

2086
02:41:30,740 --> 02:41:34,700
part i think you were really concerned about did go away but it hasn't all gone away let's

2087
02:41:34,700 --> 02:41:40,620
not forget i'm still gleefully looking at the decree and shiny silver how's it feel

2088
02:41:40,620 --> 02:41:47,340
to be on the official video game podcast of the galaxy hell yeah anyway next up um it's

2089
02:41:47,340 --> 02:41:55,260
labeled choose your world words carefully in this article on ign uk um sony shuhei yoshida

2090
02:41:55,260 --> 02:42:00,460
sorry yoshida claims this year is the first time we are able to cover the cost of the

2091
02:42:00,460 --> 02:42:05,260
playstation 3 he told ign we aren't making huge money from hardware but we aren't bleeding

2092
02:42:05,260 --> 02:42:11,100
like we used to i believe he is telling the truth but it says the ps3 is sold at profit

2093
02:42:11,100 --> 02:42:16,660
not that the ps3 program is profitable i expect this will take another eight to ten years

2094
02:42:16,660 --> 02:42:22,900
if at all it's just that now each console digs them a little bit out of the debt hole

2095
02:42:22,900 --> 02:42:27,820
i've also got more questions complaints about the ea game pass thing since i'm typically

2096
02:42:27,820 --> 02:42:32,380
not an online gamer shouldn't i get a refund of ten dollars on that new ea game i mean

2097
02:42:32,380 --> 02:42:37,100
if they allowed me to re to turn in the code for rebate it would make the entire thing

2098
02:42:37,100 --> 02:42:41,800
a lot more reasonable in theory if the code is still unused the game should be worth ten

2099
02:42:41,800 --> 02:42:47,640
dollars on more on resale but how do you prove it is still good and i bet the initial pack

2100
02:42:47,640 --> 02:42:51,980
in codes will be deleted after a year two there's really a lot more screwing of the

2101
02:42:51,980 --> 02:42:57,780
customer than is obvious hope you have a happy independence day rubba you know also if the

2102
02:42:57,780 --> 02:43:01,540
this can actually be considered part of president's way you probably could actually get away with

2103
02:43:01,540 --> 02:43:08,460
it my laptop for example if i had never booted windows on it and installed linux i could

2104
02:43:08,460 --> 02:43:14,740
have gotten a refund from dell for 200 bucks and my laptop was 350 oh wow yeah as long

2105
02:43:14,740 --> 02:43:22,580
as you never load windows on them and prove that you have never loaded windows on it that

2106
02:43:22,580 --> 02:43:28,220
you basically installed you know what launched right into linux or something then you get

2107
02:43:28,220 --> 02:43:31,900
your money back it's a bummer that the resellers don't have some type of application to see

2108
02:43:31,900 --> 02:43:37,220
if the code has been run or not but then again probably the whole point of this is to really

2109
02:43:37,220 --> 02:43:42,540
circumvent the resellers even though gamestop supposedly on board yeah but then someone

2110
02:43:42,540 --> 02:43:47,620
could you know malicious could get that code verifier and start typing in random codes

2111
02:43:47,620 --> 02:43:51,380
to see if there's one that hasn't been used or not used it'll you know give you invalid

2112
02:43:51,380 --> 02:43:57,740
or unused code and they're like oh hey look free so just so you guys know here in studio

2113
02:43:57,740 --> 02:44:03,020
apparently winapp has frozen and the stream has died yay so we gotta uh come right back

2114
02:44:03,020 --> 02:44:08,620

2122
02:44:40,900 --> 02:44:45,840

2133
02:45:36,500 --> 02:45:41,760
enough no i guess there's a couple there's not a lot of video game podcasts out there

2134
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:46,340
that don't have game in the title like i guess there's of course bobby blackwolf doesn't

2135
02:45:46,340 --> 02:45:50,740
have game in the title dead pixel live i guess doesn't have game in it but it still you know

2136
02:45:50,740 --> 02:45:55,260
pixel is kind of game what other all-game shows are there under sedation live but they

2137
02:45:55,260 --> 02:46:00,000
don't they're they're not just gaming they're kind of sci-fi ninja sisterhood oh yeah that's

2138
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:05,980
true there's them too electric sisterhood yeah because ninja sister's the host uh co-host

02:46:05,980 --> 02:46:09,440
whatever their deal is so i guess there's a few but yeah orange orange lounge doesn't

2140
02:46:09,440 --> 02:46:14,220
really make most people think video games uh you want to tell a story or me uh quick

2141
02:46:14,220 --> 02:46:19,100
thing we were bimani podcast to start off we named it after a bimani band orange lounge

2142
02:46:19,100 --> 02:46:26,000
orange lounge radio the end while on the part although we the name orange launch stuck because

2143
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:31,340
we wanted to kind of evoke that image of we're lounging around talking about games because

2144
02:46:31,340 --> 02:46:35,260
the whole idea brand yeah it's kind of like uh you know we used to go to this restaurant

2145
02:46:35,260 --> 02:46:39,300
called brooke fields it was right in the parking lot of the old people restaurant yeah oh god

2146
02:46:39,300 --> 02:46:42,420
i'm after a long night of gaming we just sit around and talk shit about games and that's

2147
02:46:42,420 --> 02:46:47,180
what we wanted our show to be and rick would always order his merlot i always remembered

2148
02:46:47,180 --> 02:46:51,820
that rick would always order his merlot and those cheese sticks were awesome they were

2149
02:46:51,820 --> 02:46:55,620
amazing amazing okay so there you go that's where i'll show you came from bimani traces

2150
02:46:55,620 --> 02:47:03,300
back to the ddr games second do you guys have any games to recommend for xbox ps3 singularity

2151
02:47:03,300 --> 02:47:08,560
recently came out and it looked cool any thoughts on that game thanks love your podcast troy

2152
02:47:08,560 --> 02:47:13,220
not played singularity myself um what i've heard around the grapevine is that it's not

2153
02:47:13,220 --> 02:47:18,720
so great but i haven't played it myself so i can tell you got good reviews um we got

2154
02:47:18,720 --> 02:47:24,560
mixed reviews i guess uh i know was it a game informer gave it an 8.5 out of 10 if that

2155
02:47:24,560 --> 02:47:29,300
makes any difference to you just check them you know metacritic if you want to you know

2156
02:47:29,300 --> 02:47:34,980
get a good you know i guess benchmark where the game is uh yeah like red dead redemption

2157
02:47:34,980 --> 02:47:39,220
will be good crackdown too if that's your sort of thing uh there's a lot of sports games

2158
02:47:39,220 --> 02:47:43,220
i think blur was underrated i think it's really good it really helps just a future reference

2159
02:47:43,220 --> 02:47:47,480
to our players let us know what type of games you're into yeah before you ask us what to

2160
02:47:47,480 --> 02:47:52,660
suggest because we are i know me in particular i am probably the most niche person in this

2161
02:47:52,660 --> 02:48:00,220
room i mean i like playing games where you take pictures of of magical girls i'm just

2162

2174
02:49:02,900 --> 02:49:08,220

2181
02:49:43,700 --> 02:49:48,780
all these expansion packs to make it never get old and that's all i can think about except

2186
02:50:10,560 --> 02:50:17,140
name agent wiggles agent wiggles that's amazing um i have been known to like a board gamer

2187
02:50:17,140 --> 02:50:21,260
too i was always a big fan of life i really like this question by the way this is a really

2188
02:50:21,260 --> 02:50:26,760
good question out of the the many random questions we get i think this is a neat question so

2189
02:50:26,760 --> 02:50:32,300
board games that you like um i kind of like the classics too i prefer a lot of card games

2190
02:50:32,300 --> 02:50:36,780
actually my favorite card game is uh millborn i don't know if you've ever played this it

2191
02:50:36,780 --> 02:50:43,800
looks like miles borns but i think it's french millborn um it's uh like a racing game with

2192
02:50:43,800 --> 02:50:48,680
cards and you can like give people flat tires and and all that that's my favorite like card

2193
02:50:48,680 --> 02:50:52,620
game i was always good at run me in spades those are always my games as far as board

2194
02:50:52,620 --> 02:50:57,500
game goes i was always a fan of clue growing up and clue master detective especially and

2195
02:50:57,500 --> 02:51:01,500
then of course i love the movie and and all that stuff so i like the classics i could

2196
02:51:01,500 --> 02:51:07,140
never get into like axis and allies and the really complex board game shit too many pieces

2197
02:51:07,140 --> 02:51:14,220
i did play risk as a small child i played risk and that thing is probably why i don't

2198
02:51:14,220 --> 02:51:21,460
like strategy games now because of all the risk i played as a kid and i love taboo i

2199
02:51:21,460 --> 02:51:26,340
mean it's not really so much of a board game i love trivial pursuits the genesis edition

2200
02:51:26,340 --> 02:51:32,540
ones the harder they are the better i like them it's hard because there's really that's

2201
02:51:32,540 --> 02:51:38,980
what she said there's there's two categories of board games there's like your hasbro target

2202
02:51:38,980 --> 02:51:44,900
walmart board games and then there's your like fucking millions of pieces hardcore we

2203
02:51:44,900 --> 02:51:51,460
don't fuck around board games like imported from foreign countries and all that like and

2204
02:51:51,460 --> 02:51:56,540
it's kind they're two totally different worlds and so it's hard to know which type of those

2205
02:51:56,540 --> 02:52:02,940
games you're into i hate monopoly i think monopolies really overrated too because if

2206
02:52:02,940 --> 02:52:07,340
you're gonna play monopoly don't make any fucking plans if you're gonna play an entire

2207
02:52:07,340 --> 02:52:12,780
game of monopoly and be prepared to hate everybody else i keep wondering where apples to apples

2208
02:52:12,780 --> 02:52:18,620
fits in it's more of a card i put it in the taboo lolsy area it works for me i like apples

2209
02:52:18,620 --> 02:52:23,740
to apples though i like and actually we played one game that was called was it cranium yeah

2210
02:52:23,740 --> 02:52:29,220
cranium is fun cranium was awesome i remember that and i miss um pictionary i still like

2211
02:52:29,220 --> 02:52:33,540
trivial pursuit i love trivial pursuits my old roommate and i were gonna have a board

2212
02:52:33,540 --> 02:52:36,740
game night we never did get around to doing it i would totally be in on the board game

2213
02:52:36,740 --> 02:52:41,180
night if we wanted to start one can't do it at my place i should talk to my friend who

2214
02:52:41,180 --> 02:52:45,620
owns a house in the south area and see if he would want to do something like that the

2215
02:52:45,620 --> 02:52:51,740
last actual board game i played was uh electronic assisted board game the omega virus does anyone

2216
02:52:51,740 --> 02:52:57,820
remember that i think so i was like early 90s that that's in that same family of games

2217
02:52:57,820 --> 02:53:02,480
like the the mall game and yeah when you say it's not the same type you know what i mean

2218
02:53:02,480 --> 02:53:06,500
when you say like mall madness when you say electronic assisted board game i think of

2219
02:53:06,500 --> 02:53:11,900
electronic battleship i used to have electronic battleship it was fucking rad you know game

2220
02:53:11,900 --> 02:53:18,900
i love for a board game mouse trap yes except it never worked it never worked if you tweak

2221
02:53:18,900 --> 02:53:24,380
parts of them um surso in our chat room says how about strip poker how about munchkin that's

2222
02:53:24,380 --> 02:53:31,380
a classic i like playing uh munchkin catan catan's pretty fun um you know your traditional

2223
02:53:31,380 --> 02:53:36,460
stuff we'll play like the game of life and now then scrabble um one game though i did

2224
02:53:36,460 --> 02:53:40,700
play with uh one of my friends a while back and it was actually a lot of fun really need

2225
02:53:40,700 --> 02:53:46,980
to play it again uh cthulhu rising i've heard that's good it's awesome it's you versus it's

2226
02:53:46,980 --> 02:53:51,900
basically everybody playing together as a team um although we need to cheat the next

2227
02:53:51,900 --> 02:53:58,180
time we play because uh it was really fucking hard cthulhu kicked our ass as cthulhu usually

2228
02:53:58,180 --> 02:54:02,180
does an elder god it reminds me of a joke i heard sorry about that someone sent me a

2229
02:54:02,180 --> 02:54:06,540
link i didn't know a video would be on it my bad how many cthulhu investigators does

2230
02:54:06,540 --> 02:54:11,700
take change light bulb all of them you never split the party see now sure as i was yelling

2231
02:54:11,700 --> 02:54:17,420
out all those junior high school games spin the bottle oh god two minutes in the closet

2232
02:54:17,420 --> 02:54:23,620
really sticking to the board games to board games okay we used to we used to though when

2233
02:54:23,620 --> 02:54:28,340
we would play monopoly we would steal the pieces from clue so i could be the you know

2234
02:54:28,340 --> 02:54:33,500
so you could be the lead pipe or the dagger or the the revolver that was always we used

2235
02:54:33,500 --> 02:54:38,140
to always fight over who got to be the car i never wanted to be the car i wanted to be

2236
02:54:38,140 --> 02:54:44,300
the shoe so i could the boots i could kick everyone's ass this is this is my logic as

2237
02:54:44,300 --> 02:54:50,380
a 10 year old this explains so much about jamie i don't see what the problem is and

2238
02:54:50,380 --> 02:54:54,940
then i don't have to argue with everybody over who gets a damn car it's it's pewter

2239
02:54:54,940 --> 02:55:03,220
it's pewter you know hold on i'll go and get like one of my uh exes uh warhammer figures

2240
02:55:03,220 --> 02:55:09,780

2244
02:55:28,120 --> 02:55:49,260
to be in our system tonight and uh it's a little segment we call the f us of the week

2245
02:55:49,260 --> 02:55:55,620
mine is multifaceted oh big words faceted is not a big word rob all right it's a little

2246
02:55:55,620 --> 02:56:01,780
word with the big meaning facet is it's something you put on the kitchen sink right where's

2247
02:56:01,780 --> 02:56:11,500
the treble it vibrates let's put that in my special place rob's got a big hairy ball in

2248
02:56:11,500 --> 02:56:23,220
his crotch now what else is new anyone got a weed whacker lord anyway anyway um not it's

2249
02:56:23,220 --> 02:56:26,940
more of a situational thing not directly to anyone in particular just the whole having

2250
02:56:26,940 --> 02:56:34,300
to wait for my surgery thing really blows but i do want to thank um my surgeon for basically

2251
02:56:34,300 --> 02:56:38,600
fitting me in on one of his on-call days to get me in so that i can still legitimately

2252
02:56:38,600 --> 02:56:50,580
claim my my uh fmla family medical lead act um also um fu to the company that purchased

2253
02:56:50,580 --> 02:56:58,620
mine um for basically um i know you're gonna outsource all the servicing to india so uh

2254
02:56:58,620 --> 02:57:04,860
i really hope that you go to hell for you know and i know i know logically it's i try

2255
02:57:04,860 --> 02:57:10,100
to separate what i logically know from what i emotionally feel you know logically it's

2256
02:57:10,100 --> 02:57:15,340
business we were the number one servicer they were the number two servicer they had the

2257
02:57:15,340 --> 02:57:22,480
money to buy us they bought us now they have no competition but still when you look at

2258
02:57:22,480 --> 02:57:28,240
people who you've been with you know for like some of these people i've worked with the

2259
02:57:28,240 --> 02:57:32,700
entire time i've been with the company for 10 years and it's just sort of like wow that's

2260
02:57:32,700 --> 02:57:38,420
a big chapter closing you know so i'm not really necessarily going to say an fu to um

2261
02:57:38,420 --> 02:57:44,460
aqua because even though they are shitty and not keeping jobs in america pretty much which

2262
02:57:44,460 --> 02:57:50,700

on the show this is my impersonation of watching world cup on telemundo okay becky and i my

2302
03:01:45,140 --> 03:01:49,680
last week of work we decided to go get tacos at our usual place and we were watching um

2303
03:01:49,680 --> 03:01:55,380
uruguay versus netherlands and it was great but every time of course there was the goal

2304
03:01:55,380 --> 03:01:58,180
wait here where's that camera and then in back when you're

2305
03:01:58,180 --> 03:02:12,340
that's my impersonation of watching world cup on telemedo you make it sound so riveting

2306
03:02:12,340 --> 03:02:24,180
all right loki got some news for us uh yes uh the ps3 is becoming white and uh racist

2307
03:02:24,180 --> 03:02:32,060
in japan it's uh it's white and it's offering a larger hard drive um because you know i

2308
03:02:32,060 --> 03:02:37,460
know those ps3 systems they really have a problem with storage space uh but instead

2309
03:02:37,460 --> 03:02:44,340
of the current 120 gigabyte ps3 slim you will now be able to get a 160 gigabyte ps3 slim

2310
03:02:44,340 --> 03:02:51,240
that's in white and uh will also include a new vertical white stand and of course a white

2311
03:02:51,240 --> 03:03:01,020
dualshock 3 controller and i'll be uh retailing for uh 29 980 yen i can't be the only one

2312
03:03:01,020 --> 03:03:05,820
who remembers the disastrous ad campaign they did with the psp when they released that night

2313
03:03:05,820 --> 03:03:11,980
let's not let's just not and then when it fails in japan it will sue the sony claiming

2314
03:03:11,980 --> 03:03:16,060
that you know it was discriminated against because it was caucasian and i'm sorry if

2315
03:03:16,060 --> 03:03:24,100
you already mentioned this but i was i was looking at chat wow um didn't they already

2316
03:03:24,100 --> 03:03:28,860
have the final fantasy 13 one that was white yeah it was white with like a pink crap on

2317
03:03:28,860 --> 03:03:32,660
it so if you don't want to know well they put a woman on it so that's why it didn't

2318
03:03:32,660 --> 03:03:41,340
sell i was waiting to get well played dark soccer is distracted by earthbound i was looking

2319
03:03:41,340 --> 03:03:49,260
at the anti-piracy stuff it's for the best all right uh and do you have anything else

2320
03:03:49,260 --> 03:03:55,380
to go with that uh yes also they're gonna be bundling resident evil 5 with um the playstation

2321
03:03:55,380 --> 03:04:01,460
move over there which in all honesty is probably a better game anyways than what moves sports

2322
03:04:01,460 --> 03:04:13,380
yay move sports but it's also gonna include it right now the uh it's also supposed to

2323
03:04:13,380 --> 03:04:21,300
be including i believe um the gun shooting pack oh they have also announced a big three

2324
03:04:21,300 --> 03:04:28,340
gun shooting perfect pack uh that will include time crisis raising storm dead uh dead storm

2325
03:04:28,340 --> 03:04:34,540
pirates and time crisis for the arcade version uh that's going to cost about 136 dollars

2326
03:04:34,540 --> 03:04:43,740
or 1 000 or i'm sorry 11 980 yen um but of course the you know the move bundle with resident

2327
03:04:43,740 --> 03:04:50,180
evil 5 the alternative edition it's all gonna have alternative music in there um that'll

2328
03:04:50,180 --> 03:04:59,220
retail for about 7980 yen or about 90 once again i rather have resident evil 5 than the

2329
03:04:59,220 --> 03:05:04,740
crappy screw it pack the resident evil game with the white ps3 and call it equal opportunity

2330
03:05:04,740 --> 03:05:09,820
well look that way everyone gets offended be quiet the nice thing about um the move

2331
03:05:09,820 --> 03:05:15,660
and a lot of that stuff is that those games aren't going to require move that's true much

2332
03:05:15,660 --> 03:05:21,980
different than the connect just so you know they may have some games that require them

2333
03:05:21,980 --> 03:05:27,780
actually no there are games that require the move oh well yeah how the fuck are you gonna

2334
03:05:27,780 --> 03:05:31,900
play move sports or how are you gonna play the sorcery game or how are you gonna play

2335
03:05:31,900 --> 03:05:36,820
um well there's a lot there's a lot though that don't require it that's true there are

2336
03:05:36,820 --> 03:05:40,980
a lot that require it the same can be said about the connect though as well there's a

2337
03:05:40,980 --> 03:05:49,380
lot what there's child of eden and well that's all that's been announced yet yeah just saying

2338
03:05:49,380 --> 03:05:54,340
and that's all right that they don't require that the playstation move be you know required

2339
03:05:54,340 --> 03:05:59,180
to play certain games because it probably will stink all right one more story for you

2340
03:05:59,180 --> 03:06:03,840
guys then we're gonna open up the skype line at 1877 game olr and i'm sorry this picture

2341
03:06:03,840 --> 03:06:08,580
that they have photoshopped with the move in her hand it looks like a giant sex toy

2342
03:06:08,580 --> 03:06:14,260
a freaking huge giant sex toy with a glowing end on it are you done i'm done you swear

2343
03:06:14,260 --> 03:06:20,740
all right one more story for you guys tonight uh and it has to do with an olr favorite game

2344
03:06:20,740 --> 03:06:27,380
eye of judgment and i guess you could say a sad end to a story here yes the eye of judgment

2345
03:06:27,380 --> 03:06:31,620
or as we sometimes call it here uh on orange launch radio the brown eye of judgment or

2346
03:06:31,620 --> 03:06:35,980
that game we really wish would sell 1 million copies so that loki would have to put on a

2347
03:06:35,980 --> 03:06:39,380
tingle suit when he comes to the show you might remember he made that bet a long time

2348
03:06:39,380 --> 03:06:50,180
ago apparently the eye of judgment servers are going to be shut down on september 30th

2349
03:06:50,180 --> 03:06:54,780
and that was a notice now now it's on the european playstation forums but you can just

2350
03:06:54,780 --> 03:06:58,900
pretty much guess that this pretty much is going to carry over to the states as well

2351
03:06:58,900 --> 03:07:03,940
so offline play will still be available of course but if you play the eye of judgment

2352
03:07:03,940 --> 03:07:09,300
online you will no longer be able to after september 30th i have something to say about

2353
03:07:09,300 --> 03:07:17,140
that what so i'm sure all ten of you will be there iphone what's that i said i'm sure

2354
03:07:17,140 --> 03:07:24,660
all ten of you will be sad well this also means something else you guys is that you

2355
03:07:24,660 --> 03:07:29,500
know we made that bet with loki and i know you guys were holding out hope uh that somehow

2356
03:07:29,500 --> 03:07:33,460
some way maybe a price cut or something would happen where this game would sell a million

2357
03:07:33,460 --> 03:07:38,920
copies but guys now that the developer is even pulling the plug on eye of judgment i

2358
03:07:38,920 --> 03:07:48,340
think it's time to finally admit you guys the bet ladies and gentlemen is over and not

2359
03:07:48,340 --> 03:07:53,220
to mention that they stopped printing the game like years ago i don't even think they

2360
03:07:53,220 --> 03:07:58,900

2365
03:08:19,760 --> 03:08:23,100

2370
03:08:48,460 --> 03:08:52,780
it's cute because there's this little dog that you can play with here and uh it's like

2371
03:08:52,780 --> 03:08:56,740
kind of like it looks like a little a little bit of an rpg here uh that you can play with

2372
03:08:56,740 --> 03:09:01,600
your team there it's a ds game metal max 3 it's a sequel i believe there was an old ass

2373
03:09:01,600 --> 03:09:06,940
nintendo game that was only out in japan called metal max it was out in the states too i distinctly

2374
03:09:06,940 --> 03:09:13,920
yes it was was it really um i want to say it was either on the playstation 3 or playstation

2375
03:09:13,920 --> 03:09:19,260
2 maybe because i remember it's the one with dogs with artillery on it because that's so

2376
03:09:19,260 --> 03:09:24,620
epic it is dogs with artillery i think it's the same game i can't remember what it was

2377
03:09:24,620 --> 03:09:29,300
called over here but that's how i sold it i'm like dude it's dogs with freaking cannons

2378
03:09:29,300 --> 03:09:33,700
on the back of them i like some of these artworks too you can be a hunter or a mechanic and

2379
03:09:33,700 --> 03:09:37,820
there's this chick with like big old wrenches there and uh you could be a big old wrenches

2380
03:09:37,820 --> 03:09:44,460
that's right or a nurse hello nurse wenches uh wrestlers artists i don't see the dog with

2381
03:09:44,460 --> 03:09:48,700
artillery but i think that's in the game a little later there so metal max 3 there for

2382
03:09:48,700 --> 03:09:53,220
last minute stories tonight uh our skyline is open i guess i guess our freaking feed

2383
03:09:53,220 --> 03:09:59,180
dropped for some reason uh 1877 game olr is the phone number to call i don't know why

2384
03:09:59,180 --> 03:10:04,060
we're having stream fail problems tonight i blame visual basic i blame the vuvuzela

2385
03:10:04,060 --> 03:10:09,540
all right loki you have any last minute stories for us while we wait for some phone calls

2386
03:10:09,540 --> 03:10:14,540
uh just one the apparently the rumor is the new animal crossing game for the 3ds will

2387
03:10:14,540 --> 03:10:21,260
have you as the role of the mayor interesting so you will you will have to do stuff for

2388
03:10:21,260 --> 03:10:26,280
the town where's that rumor coming from um it's coming from apparently a pdf that came

2389
03:10:26,280 --> 03:10:31,500
out from nintendo during e3 which makes sense because they did put out e3 or they usually

2390
03:10:31,500 --> 03:10:35,780
put out pdfs with um information regarding their titles all right let me get to the phone

2391
03:10:35,780 --> 03:10:40,140
because we do have a call and hold hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hi uh this

2392
03:10:40,140 --> 03:10:46,460
is spazzing here hey spazzinator what's on your mind um well this is just uh basically

2393
03:10:46,460 --> 03:10:53,100
a follow call to the car i you know i had made like two weeks ago um you know just a

2394
03:10:53,100 --> 03:10:59,260
quick recap just in case you or the other listeners forgot uh forgot um basically sunny

2395
03:10:59,260 --> 03:11:08,300
was having uh having me jump through uh to get my veal uh back after uh having to send

2396
03:11:08,300 --> 03:11:17,100
my system in for repair uh again for the yellow lighted desk and basically um i don't know

2397
03:11:17,100 --> 03:11:24,060
if anyone's seen my lull ramps on twitter but here it is basically a week and a half

2398
03:11:24,060 --> 03:11:33,740
later and i still don't have all my videos you know back uh-oh basically i uh i literally

2399
03:11:33,740 --> 03:11:43,380
uh you know i looked at what they did authorize uh you know and uh you know i compare that

2400
03:11:43,380 --> 03:11:51,380
to all the videos that backed up and basically i still got like 55 videos outstanding and

2401
03:11:51,380 --> 03:11:55,860
i'm like what the fuck you know uh you would think you're not the only person to that this

2402
03:11:55,860 --> 03:12:01,580
happens to it's it it's weird that they don't have a better process like at least microsoft

2403
03:12:01,580 --> 03:12:07,980
seems to have with the whole you know releasing your um drm once a year to be able to re-download

2404
03:12:07,980 --> 03:12:16,220
it seems a little ridiculous yeah my my main gripe more than anything is that well it's

2405
03:12:16,220 --> 03:12:25,420
kind of twofold a uh the first one being that you know sony's policy you know is uh having

2406
03:12:25,420 --> 03:12:33,020
this done uh done it's supposed to be done within 24 to 48 hours of your call and i since

2407
03:12:33,020 --> 03:12:39,740
i you know made the initial call uh on the wednesday before you know the first of july

2408
03:12:39,740 --> 03:12:46,100
you know i should have gotten all my videos back by that friday and like i just said i'm

2409
03:12:46,100 --> 03:12:53,700
still missing 55 videos and the second uh gripe that i have is that you know the sony

2410
03:12:53,700 --> 03:13:00,300
reps over there you know either don't seem to know what the hell they're doing or just

2411
03:13:00,300 --> 03:13:05,260
don't give a give a shit one way y'all are you know well they're probably outsourced

2412
03:13:05,260 --> 03:13:09,580
i hate to say it but they're they're probably some type of outs i mean i don't i don't have

2413
03:13:09,580 --> 03:13:14,100
any facts to back that up but a lot of times when they're disconnected they are but actually

2414
03:13:14,100 --> 03:13:17,720
i want to say um this real quick uh from a chat room chat room because we have a lot

2415
03:13:17,720 --> 03:13:22,060
of chatters that are saying well maybe you should buy hard copies i mean does this kind

2416
03:13:22,060 --> 03:13:28,020
of make you think wow this might be the case against digital distribution or are you walking

2417
03:13:28,020 --> 03:13:32,140
away from this going oh you know what i'm still i'm still about digital distribution

2418
03:13:32,140 --> 03:13:41,020
well you know some of the shows i normally get on a regular basis for example uh i i

2419
03:13:41,020 --> 03:13:48,780
i buy um the weekly recaps of uh x play and attack of the show on a regular basis and

2420
03:13:48,780 --> 03:13:59,300
i i've never seen those uh on hard copy whatsoever unless i get like uh a dvd burner and uh you

2421
03:13:59,300 --> 03:14:07,740
know record them directly out the air interesting okay yeah uh all in other uh shows you know

2422
03:14:07,740 --> 03:14:14,660
uh you know i've tried looking at places like blockbuster targeting what that uh and uh

2423
03:14:14,660 --> 03:14:22,240
i almost never see them you know my only other recourse would probably be to go to uh go

2424
03:14:22,240 --> 03:14:29,180
to microsoft to get them there or get them on playstation networks so uh you know or

2425
03:14:29,180 --> 03:14:35,780
find some kind of mail order service and buy them that way but but you know you know but

2426
03:14:35,780 --> 03:14:43,100
the thing is you know i damaged joe joe schmoe shouldn't have to jump through hoops you know

2427
03:14:43,100 --> 03:14:49,020
please and beg and yada yada yada to get all their videos back that they rightfully

2428
03:14:49,020 --> 03:14:55,620
paid for you know i mean all i want is to sit down watch my videos when i'm not playing

2429
03:14:55,620 --> 03:15:00,780
you know playing my games and whatnot i mean it really isn't really too much to ask for

2430
03:15:00,780 --> 03:15:04,900
well you know spaz nader although there's not a lot we can really do to help um i think

2431
03:15:04,900 --> 03:15:10,580
there's a lot that at least your troubles hopefully will not be other listeners problems

2432
03:15:10,580 --> 03:15:14,180
in the future this should be something that i think a lot of people should take into consideration

2433
03:15:14,180 --> 03:15:18,060
when uh buying this stuff is that you know if they're gonna make you jump through hoops

2434
03:15:18,060 --> 03:15:22,800
to get your content back maybe you want to think twice before you click buy and that's

2435
03:15:22,800 --> 03:15:28,780
really what it boils down to unfortunately i i there's i can't i can't make sony give

2436
03:15:28,780 --> 03:15:33,780
the stuff back or what have you so uh there's not a lot we can do but i'm i'm hoping you're

2437
03:15:33,780 --> 03:15:38,580
uh able to get conclusion to this but this is really that just really bites and i think

2438
03:15:38,580 --> 03:15:44,540
uh unfortunately your story is going to have to be caution for everybody else yeah um one

2439
03:15:44,540 --> 03:15:51,340
final note before i want to go and get to um the next call yeah um i did you know make

2440
03:15:51,340 --> 03:15:59,160
you know my most recent call to sony uh you know this past friday and basically bitching

2441
03:15:59,160 --> 03:16:06,180
to them about um you know what's going on with the videos and basically they said it's

2442
03:16:06,180 --> 03:16:12,820
gonna take a couple days longer and i should should you know you know get them back by

2443
03:16:12,820 --> 03:16:19,460
tuesday and um you know if i you know i don't want to get them by tuesday i'm just gonna

2444
03:16:19,460 --> 03:16:23,980
call them back and i'll tell them how pissed off i am and you know threatening to take

2445
03:16:23,980 --> 03:16:28,820
all my business over to microsoft you know in terms of uh digital downloads and whatnot

2446
03:16:28,820 --> 03:16:34,660
and tell them you got the video game podcast of the galaxy behind your back all right well

2447
03:16:34,660 --> 03:16:42,940
and have a good one and i'll keep you posted as to what's going on please do and they can

2448
03:16:42,940 --> 03:16:48,100
follow you on twitter too at what spasinator underscore psn right or is there no underscore

2449
03:16:48,100 --> 03:16:54,100

2450
03:16:54,100 --> 03:16:59,740
i see uh bonds in chat says my ps3 yellow rained on me too so i guess and rob that's

2451
03:16:59,740 --> 03:17:05,940
the official video game podcast i'm sorry i'm sorry because i didn't violate the decree

2452
03:17:05,940 --> 03:17:10,060
did i was there a clause in there okay i'm good just want to clarify that all right thank

2453
03:17:10,060 --> 03:17:14,940
you thank you for clarifying that real is an orange lounge radio the official video

2454
03:17:14,940 --> 03:17:19,140
game podcast of the galaxy uh if you want to give us a call 1 877 game olr or our username

2455
03:17:19,140 --> 03:17:26,340
on skype orange lounge radio yeah sceo 100 matt has advice for spasinator saying if you're

2456
03:17:26,340 --> 03:17:29,560
going to keep getting bitten by this then just stop downloading videos on it it really

2457
03:17:29,560 --> 03:17:33,340
isn't worth the hassle every six months with this nonsense you know i kind of make this

2458
03:17:33,340 --> 03:17:38,220
comparison to what i'm going through in world of warcraft right now is that you invest so

2459
03:17:38,220 --> 03:17:43,860
much in something sometimes it's easier said than done to just walk away from it you know

2460
03:17:43,860 --> 03:17:48,420
what i mean although granted spasinators well no actually i don't think you could say that

2461
03:17:48,420 --> 03:17:53,120
because i pay fifteen dollars a month for wow so spasinators invested a lot of money

2462
03:17:53,120 --> 03:18:00,760
too i'm sure but so have i so um yeah i i i think though um what you got to do is you've

2463
03:18:00,760 --> 03:18:07,500
got to let his uh trouble serve as a lesson for everybody else 1 877 game olr username

2468

2480

top executives telling the infinity award folks to get over it regarding the bonuses

that they were promised basically being interrogated in secrecy stuff that you would see in some

2498
03:21:25,820 --> 03:21:31,000
sort of like you know so stuff that you would see during the soviet union days when you

had a secret police interrogate people out of nowhere did they just try did activision

2500
03:21:36,240 --> 03:21:41,000
recently exchanged 10 spies for four of infinity award spies and one of them was like this

2501
03:21:41,000 --> 03:21:45,960
really hot redhead is that perhaps i saw something on that but i guess it's for it's to the point

2502
03:21:45,960 --> 03:21:51,360
where they literally withheld bonuses unless they churned out another modern warfare game

2503
03:21:51,360 --> 03:21:56,120
to be completed november of next year stuff like that like they were basically being hoard

2504
03:21:56,120 --> 03:22:01,520
out to to spit out nothing but modern warfare you know you know what's interesting something

2505
03:22:01,520 --> 03:22:05,000
similar to what you're saying right now was brought up earlier in the show and it was

2506
03:22:05,000 --> 03:22:09,840
when loki was talking about crackdown 2 and you know we mentioned oh crackdown 2 has been

2507
03:22:09,840 --> 03:22:13,180
getting a lot of crap because it's just like crackdown 1 and we were talking about how

2508
03:22:13,180 --> 03:22:17,040
the developers had to start from scratch and you know they should just have waited and

2509
03:22:17,040 --> 03:22:20,700
not say they're going to patch it on the back end and then drew kind of chimed in and said

2510
03:22:20,700 --> 03:22:26,080
well that was probably the publisher not the developer and it's kind of interesting because

2511
03:22:26,080 --> 03:22:31,620
this whole thing you're talking about is publisher bullying the developer yes exactly this is

2512
03:22:31,620 --> 03:22:38,080
this this goes back to the point of who holds the strings and how much how much power is

2513
03:22:38,080 --> 03:22:42,760
being wielded by activision in this sense they're they they're swinging that big stick

2514
03:22:42,760 --> 03:22:47,600
of theirs no pun intended but who has the bigger penis well that that's how it usually

2515
03:22:47,600 --> 03:22:53,000
is remember uh hellgate london that had numerous problems with it but they had to make the

2516
03:22:53,000 --> 03:23:00,240
halloween release date which is i know i mean infinity ward met their deadline ahead of

2517
03:23:00,240 --> 03:23:05,120
schedule and yet they're basically asking a lot you know twice as much from them let

2518
03:23:05,120 --> 03:23:10,600
me very little in exchange let me put out going as far as like you know just giving

2519
03:23:10,600 --> 03:23:14,980
them crumbs of their bonuses let me put out a pro tip to all the publishers of the world

2520
03:23:14,980 --> 03:23:20,660
out there i think in general are gamers going to be pissed if you keep pushing a game back

2521
03:23:20,660 --> 03:23:24,200
and back and back and back yes there's going to be they're going to be pissed off there's

2522
03:23:24,200 --> 03:23:28,300
going to be rabble rabble on the internet but at the end of the day when that game comes

2523
03:23:28,300 --> 03:23:33,820
out do you want to actually sell copies of the game if so it should probably be a good

2524
03:23:33,820 --> 03:23:39,620
game so my advice to the publishers of the world take the time to get it right are you

2525
03:23:39,620 --> 03:23:43,460
gonna go through a little bit of belly aching and pains while you make it right yes but

2526
03:23:43,460 --> 03:23:47,640
at the end of the day it's gonna be worth it because the game kicks ass there you go

2527
03:23:47,640 --> 03:23:53,080
just like and how many of you remember never forget super smash brothers brawl right the

2528
03:23:53,080 --> 03:23:59,720
new one on the gamecube or not on the gamecube we was delayed like twice and one of them

2529
03:23:59,720 --> 03:24:03,460
was a huge delay like six months right they spent more time on it and as a result the

2530
03:24:03,460 --> 03:24:08,240
quality increased yes now this goes back to my point where hideo kojima recently said

2531
03:24:08,240 --> 03:24:13,720
that japanese developers are pretty much they're lacking ambition and creativity something

2532
03:24:13,720 --> 03:24:18,200
that activision loves to you know this is the same card that activision plays by milking

2533
03:24:18,200 --> 03:24:24,360
their franchises to death the japanese are doing likewise they're not they're as long

2534
03:24:24,360 --> 03:24:28,240
in other words if an idea is out of their comfort zone they're not going to pursue it

2535
03:24:28,240 --> 03:24:33,880
they're just it's more profitable to just create a new sequel of x rpg or x fight and

2536
03:24:33,880 --> 03:24:38,080
y fighting game salacious pop in our chat room gives another excellent example arkham

2537
03:24:38,080 --> 03:24:42,760
asylum was delayed at least twice but everyone immediately forgot their angst about it when

2538
03:24:42,760 --> 03:24:48,460
it hit because it was really good chat.org i just said last week on the show i think

2539
03:24:48,460 --> 03:24:54,020
final fantasy 14 should be delayed like the uh the valves and blizzards they might take

2540
03:24:54,020 --> 03:25:00,160
forever but but the games they finally do release are worth the wait exactly that's

2541
03:25:00,160 --> 03:25:05,240
the whole point that's why but then you know that doesn't fit well that doesn't bode well

2542
03:25:05,240 --> 03:25:11,080
with the public company and shareholders because they want results in the short term or else

2543
03:25:11,080 --> 03:25:14,800
they're going to stop investing money in that company so this is where activision makes

2544
03:25:14,800 --> 03:25:19,560
us bread and butter by by doing sequels in the short term and not really preparing for

2545
03:25:19,560 --> 03:25:23,500
long term invest you know investments all right well zack we got to let you go to see

2546
03:25:23,500 --> 03:25:27,740
if anyone else is going to call in but uh we don't forget ddrx2 came out in japan we

2547
03:25:27,740 --> 03:25:31,320
heard we heard what do you think of that really quick what you think of the remixes i haven't

2548
03:25:31,320 --> 03:25:34,800
heard him yet but what do you think of that whole idea i think the song was a lot better

2549
03:25:34,800 --> 03:25:39,560
that i mean it's something that that blows it's in other words a lot better than what

2550
03:25:39,560 --> 03:25:45,040
supernova and possibly extreme has offered to grow zdrx out of the water at initially

2551
03:25:45,040 --> 03:25:49,840
our mp3 is out there on the internet now can you hear these remix songs go off of body

2552
03:25:49,840 --> 03:25:53,480
style they've already had like videos of it do they still have the stupid tokens and all

2553
03:25:53,480 --> 03:25:59,040
that garbage like to download stuff okay good i doubt it that's lost track anyways that'll

2554
03:25:59,040 --> 03:26:04,480
tell you how long it's been since i've been following uh go to that site they're updating

2562
03:26:39,520 --> 03:26:49,040

2563
03:26:49,040 --> 03:27:08,600
what oh the background's like cute it looks like it runs really smooth hell you should

2564
03:27:08,600 --> 03:27:12,240
be happy that they brought back captain jack in this one so now you can play this again

2565
03:27:12,240 --> 03:27:17,160
yeah i wasn't how about a different captain jack song yeah i agree with sj100 matt you

2566
03:27:17,160 --> 03:27:21,520
the original one hasn't made an appearance as extreme and that's all you could say that's

2567
03:27:21,520 --> 03:27:28,240
eight it's like eight years absent from a ddr mix but it was in a ddr mix how about

2568

a new cap but it hasn't been in a ddr mix in almost eight years all right all right

2569
03:27:33,240 --> 03:27:37,120
