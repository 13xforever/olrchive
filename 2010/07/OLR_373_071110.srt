1
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:18,524
[SPEAKER_13]: Tonight, July 11th, 2010, could a cell phone be built into the 3DS?

2
00:00:18,925 --> 00:00:25,616
[SPEAKER_13]: A trial date is set for Infinity Ward vs. Activision, and Microsoft teams up with Fast Food to promote a Kinect game.

3
00:00:31,673 --> 00:00:36,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:39,858
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:39,918 --> 00:00:41,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much for tuning in to us tonight.

6
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:50,745
[SPEAKER_03]: We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show, www.allgames.com.

7
00:00:50,765 --> 00:00:52,566
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk about video games.

8
00:00:53,126 --> 00:00:54,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Gaming Culture, Gamer Lifestyle.

9
00:00:55,187 --> 00:00:56,088
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts.

10
00:00:56,108 --> 00:00:57,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be joining you over the next few hours.

11
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:02,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:02,591 --> 00:01:06,874
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, Jamie Summers?

13
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:16,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I noticed, as we promised two weeks ago, because we didn't have a show because of the 4th of July, you did not come in here as Inspector Gadget tonight.

14
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Is everything okay with the fingers?

15
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,352
[SPEAKER_12]: My surgery got delayed to Tuesday because of a scheduling issue.

16
00:01:23,312 --> 00:01:24,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, good for us though.

17
00:01:24,993 --> 00:01:27,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't ship in the bionic parts.

18
00:01:29,075 --> 00:01:36,338
[SPEAKER_12]: No, basically the thing is that my visit with my last surgeon was set up as my consultation.

19
00:01:36,358 --> 00:01:37,639
[SPEAKER_12]: He was just going to refer me into surgery.

20
00:01:38,019 --> 00:01:40,800
[SPEAKER_12]: Except he didn't put surgery in the thing.

21
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:43,682
[SPEAKER_12]: I've already filled out all my FMLA and everything.

22
00:01:43,862 --> 00:01:45,503
[SPEAKER_12]: So my new doctor is just like...

23
00:01:46,303 --> 00:01:52,766
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll go ahead and write your leave starting Friday, which is what it was supposed to have been.

24
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:59,109
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I go in Tuesday at 2 o'clock Pacific to have my hand flayed.

25
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,871
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think they're going to put me under this time.

26
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:04,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you don't get to watch.

27
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:09,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, the only logic, the only reason I think this is because they're telling me not to eat beforehand.

28
00:02:10,357 --> 00:02:13,219
[SPEAKER_12]: So usually that's a sign that they're going to clunk you out.

29
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they'll just numb like a lot of parts.

30
00:02:15,521 --> 00:02:18,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you won't be able to feel like the whole like left half of your body for a little while.

31
00:02:18,524 --> 00:02:23,468
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what happened the last time is that they damned off my arm so that there'd be no blood in my hand.

32
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:24,809
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

33
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:40,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you just kind of using one hand?

34
00:02:41,242 --> 00:02:54,246
[SPEAKER_12]: For the most part, I mean, because really it was a lot of running around and, you know, and I was actually using, I had the controller in my lap when I wasn't, you know, walking and was pushing the button with a finger.

35
00:02:54,506 --> 00:03:04,769
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of those RPGs like Final Fantasy, Blue Dragon, and so forth really lend themselves easy to like only having one hand because it's like A, attack, A, target creature, A, A, A, A, over and over, you know?

36
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:08,250
[SPEAKER_12]: You remember that single-handed PlayStation controller, the RPG controller?

37
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, vaguely, yes.

38
00:03:10,011 --> 00:03:11,331
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I've got one somewhere.

39
00:03:11,511 --> 00:03:12,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Vaguely.

40
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:12,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

41
00:03:12,652 --> 00:03:14,213
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't very popular, I don't think.

42
00:03:14,273 --> 00:03:15,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, well, he's not here.

43
00:03:15,353 --> 00:03:17,574
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we just were given one or something.

44
00:03:17,734 --> 00:03:17,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

45
00:03:18,255 --> 00:03:19,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Single hand control schemes are always nice.

46
00:03:19,835 --> 00:03:20,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember Earthbound?

47
00:03:22,056 --> 00:03:24,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we got a lot of other voices I haven't even introduced yet.

48
00:03:25,518 --> 00:03:27,239
[SPEAKER_12]: I do have to, well, I'll talk about it later.

49
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:30,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki as well.

50
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:33,902
[SPEAKER_03]: He was drinking a shake.

51
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:35,521
[SPEAKER_04]: It was hot outside.

52
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,622
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't mean to inconvenience you, I'm sorry.

53
00:03:37,682 --> 00:03:41,083
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's hot outside, so it was the coldest thing I could think of.

54
00:03:41,103 --> 00:03:43,603
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just going to make me really thirsty later.

55
00:03:44,084 --> 00:03:44,664
[SPEAKER_03]: The irony.

56
00:03:44,844 --> 00:03:51,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it funny when you're hearing about this East Coast heat wave, and they're like, OMG, it's 100 degrees, and I'm like, that's like Wednesday here.

57
00:03:52,686 --> 00:03:56,927
[SPEAKER_12]: My friend in Canada was posting about it being, I think, 80.

58
00:03:58,007 --> 00:04:00,488
[SPEAKER_12]: She gave it to me in Celsius.

59
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:05,231
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's 80 degrees Celsius, I don't want to be over there.

60
00:04:05,491 --> 00:04:06,992
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very hot, actually.

61
00:04:07,852 --> 00:04:09,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that like 180 degrees?

62
00:04:09,772 --> 00:04:10,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, forget it.

63
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:12,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

64
00:04:12,993 --> 00:04:17,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, I'm joking a little bit because I know the East Coast isn't really built to handle the heat.

65
00:04:17,353 --> 00:04:19,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, everything's got air conditioning.

66
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:20,894
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have a house without central air.

67
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:21,854
[SPEAKER_03]: That's unheard of.

68
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:30,776
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it kind of sucked for them, but it does make me laugh when I hear 100 degrees, panic, panic, panic because I'm like, wake me when it's 113.

69
00:04:32,436 --> 00:04:34,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent the weekend in the Bay Area.

70
00:04:34,457 --> 00:04:38,458
[SPEAKER_03]: You drive to the Bay Area, it's like cold and windy still.

71
00:04:38,858 --> 00:04:39,659
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.

72
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:45,821
[SPEAKER_04]: I had friends come up this weekend and they were from Santa Cruz and they said, yeah, it's like a high of 71.

73
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:49,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, that'd be nice.

74
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:52,804
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're also going to introduce, he's back this week.

75
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:57,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the heck's going on here, but he's here two weeks in a row-ish, because we didn't really do a show last week.

76
00:04:57,566 --> 00:05:00,368
[SPEAKER_03]: But say hello to intern Drew Nami, he's here tonight.

77
00:05:00,588 --> 00:05:02,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi guys, just trying to make it a habit again.

78
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:03,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

79
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,551
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I know what you're trying to do.

80
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:09,153
[SPEAKER_03]: You're trying to squeeze into Loki's chair when he's out on paternity leave.

81
00:05:09,193 --> 00:05:11,574
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you're trying to do, I think.

82
00:05:11,614 --> 00:05:12,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't think I don't know what you're up to.

83
00:05:13,175 --> 00:05:15,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I know nothing, nothing.

84
00:05:15,957 --> 00:05:17,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki is irreplaceable.

85
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:19,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

86
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:21,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Knowing him, he won't even be gone.

87
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,406
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll be like, you know, I just had the baby this morning, but I'm here.

88
00:05:24,646 --> 00:05:28,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I remember when he was the intern, he was on the floor and he didn't get pizza.

89
00:05:29,432 --> 00:05:29,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, look.

90
00:05:31,752 --> 00:05:32,392
[SPEAKER_02]: And how have you been?

91
00:05:32,452 --> 00:05:33,252
[SPEAKER_02]: How's life been treating you?

92
00:05:33,272 --> 00:05:35,133
[SPEAKER_03]: How was the 4th of July for you?

93
00:05:35,453 --> 00:05:53,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Just mostly sat and listened to the fireworks go off Watched a couple fireworks displays in WoW and played some Left 4 Dead Watched fireworks in WoW, probably better than the ones I spent $50 on, that's for sure I also watched fireworks in Animal Crossing I missed the fireworks from Final Fantasy 11, remember that?

94
00:05:54,143 --> 00:05:55,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's right.

95
00:05:55,445 --> 00:05:56,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my gosh.

96
00:05:56,226 --> 00:05:57,427
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of MMOs do that stuff.

97
00:05:58,929 --> 00:05:59,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

98
00:05:59,429 --> 00:05:59,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

99
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:00,590
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

100
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:06,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I spent $50 on safe and sane fireworks, which is all we're allowed in this area.

101
00:06:06,837 --> 00:06:08,159
[SPEAKER_03]: So that lasts about, like, what, five minutes?

102
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:08,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

103
00:06:08,923 --> 00:06:14,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wait, $50 on safe and sane fireworks and I just get to hear the idiots down the street shooting off bottle rockets.

104
00:06:15,072 --> 00:06:16,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe about 20 minutes.

105
00:06:16,113 --> 00:06:17,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you gotta love all the signs everywhere.

106
00:06:17,535 --> 00:06:21,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Zero tolerance on illegal fireworks and all the neighbors all over.

107
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:23,885
[SPEAKER_03]: We won't tolerate it, but we also won't do anything about it.

108
00:06:26,263 --> 00:06:27,564
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was fine.

109
00:06:27,584 --> 00:06:29,426
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a good night.

110
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:31,268
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope all of you had a good 4th of July as well.

111
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you're overseas and maybe you didn't really celebrate the 4th.

112
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,612
[SPEAKER_03]: But I hope you had a good week nonetheless.

113
00:06:36,973 --> 00:06:38,934
[SPEAKER_03]: We're back here with Orange Lawns Radio after our week off.

114
00:06:40,856 --> 00:06:41,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Shezro's in our chat room.

115
00:06:42,037 --> 00:06:44,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.OrangeLawnsRadio.com saying, Wow, $50?

116
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,120
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck?

117
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,680
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn.

118
00:06:45,761 --> 00:06:46,982
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the exact quote actually.

119
00:06:47,342 --> 00:06:47,842
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck?

120
00:06:47,862 --> 00:06:48,323
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn.

121
00:06:49,204 --> 00:06:49,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing though.

122
00:06:50,044 --> 00:06:52,627
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of charities set up booths here.

123
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:54,128
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

124
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,824
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

125
00:07:38,617 --> 00:08:01,643
[SPEAKER_04]: They had this giant inflatable barrel that looked like an explosive barrel or something They had 50,000 signs that were out there They had signs literally blocks away They had people waving signs to go buy their fireworks And they were offering all sorts of discounts And I was like, no, they suck I'm still not buying them Oh, and they had a bounce house

126
00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:03,736
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.

127
00:08:03,876 --> 00:08:04,478
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of stuff.

128
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:06,061
[SPEAKER_04]: All the money that they spend on their advertising?

129
00:08:06,722 --> 00:08:07,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Not going to make it up with the fireworks.

130
00:08:09,897 --> 00:08:15,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry kids, we were going to donate money to the orphanage, but now we actually have to sell the orphanage to pay for these fireworks.

131
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:22,688
[SPEAKER_03]: You do have to wonder about a charity organization that spends all this money on that stuff.

132
00:08:22,788 --> 00:08:31,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I feel a little more for the handwritten in crayon on the poster board, support our school, I'm more about that stuff.

133
00:08:33,557 --> 00:08:34,518
[SPEAKER_11]: You're very grassroots.

134
00:08:35,143 --> 00:08:36,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I am very grassroots.

135
00:08:36,323 --> 00:08:37,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, look at this show.

136
00:08:38,664 --> 00:08:44,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Been going for eight years and still haven't been bought by the man yet.

137
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:49,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Fireworks are not good just for the 4th of July.

138
00:08:49,607 --> 00:08:50,707
[SPEAKER_04]: He needs them all year round.

139
00:08:53,508 --> 00:08:54,988
[SPEAKER_12]: We had illegal ones.

140
00:08:56,109 --> 00:08:56,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Shame on you.

141
00:08:58,689 --> 00:09:00,470
[SPEAKER_03]: You had a party on the 3rd, right?

142
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,490
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a block party.

143
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:04,231
[SPEAKER_03]: So you did fireworks the night before?

144
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,691
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I did the night after and the night after that and the night after that.

145
00:09:08,472 --> 00:09:12,594
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember one year I bought like $30, $40 worth of fireworks.

146
00:09:12,794 --> 00:09:13,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Fireworks.

147
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:14,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Fireworks.

148
00:09:14,295 --> 00:09:14,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Work, work.

149
00:09:15,295 --> 00:09:15,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Fireworks.

150
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:17,856
[SPEAKER_03]: And I brought them to one of Jamie's house parties.

151
00:09:17,976 --> 00:09:23,019
[SPEAKER_03]: But because there were so many fireworks here, they never got set off.

152
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:24,700
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went home with a box of fireworks.

153
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just funny how you're talking.

154
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,000
[SPEAKER_03]: What a shame.

155
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I could use them year round.

156
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:27,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Year round.

157
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:30,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually ended up using them the next year.

158
00:09:31,466 --> 00:09:32,728
[SPEAKER_03]: I sat on them for a whole year.

159
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:34,391
[SPEAKER_12]: We had real metal sparklers too.

160
00:09:34,631 --> 00:09:34,932
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you?

161
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,996
[SPEAKER_12]: And those little wizard things that go down the street.

162
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,821
[SPEAKER_12]: And bottle rockets and...

163
00:09:41,343 --> 00:09:42,824
[SPEAKER_04]: The ground flowers are awesome.

164
00:09:58,979 --> 00:10:01,060
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe they're just really good about soliciting donations.

165
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,860
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's a good point.

166
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, wait.

167
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,741
[SPEAKER_03]: They're good at soliciting donations.

168
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:08,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Why sell the fireworks anyway?

169
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the money donated.

170
00:10:11,603 --> 00:10:13,623
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt says, Rob, I am the man.

171
00:10:13,783 --> 00:10:14,683
[SPEAKER_03]: How much for the show?

172
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:20,425
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, I invited Rob, and he didn't respond to it, talking about his party that he had, and he called me a dick.

173
00:10:21,265 --> 00:10:25,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, actually, I put myself down as a maybe.

174
00:10:25,948 --> 00:10:34,814
[SPEAKER_03]: For those that don't know, I yelled at SSJ100Matt last week because he called into the show saying he was having a 4th of July party and what classic game should they play and I said I didn't get an invite.

175
00:10:35,215 --> 00:10:37,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind I live in California and SSJ100Matt's in New York City.

176
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:43,640
[SPEAKER_03]: So he did send me an invite on Facebook and I responded maybe because that's what you do to all the invites on Facebook.

177
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,681
[SPEAKER_03]: You put yourself down as a maybe.

178
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:47,023
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like there's going to be any fireworks there anyway.

179
00:10:47,503 --> 00:10:50,045
[SPEAKER_12]: I usually just say no and then when I show up it's a surprise.

180
00:10:52,697 --> 00:10:54,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Al-Qaeda Al-Qaeda Al-Qaeda

181
00:11:09,896 --> 00:11:11,237
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not a funny prank.

182
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:12,978
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a hilarious prank.

183
00:11:13,138 --> 00:11:13,718
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not funny.

184
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:15,619
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one that'll get you killed, but it's funny.

185
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:29,206
[SPEAKER_03]: What about instead of something kind of hot button like that, you do like just this really like obscure charity organization like trying to launch a horse into space organization.

186
00:11:29,346 --> 00:11:29,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that's funny.

187
00:11:30,286 --> 00:11:32,087
[SPEAKER_12]: How about the people that are trying to build a Gundam?

188
00:11:33,746 --> 00:11:36,308
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know why it's not been done yet You get strippers

189
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,031
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

190
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:24,926
[SPEAKER_04]: They will clean out that fireworks stand.

191
00:12:24,966 --> 00:12:25,446
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

192
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:25,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy.

193
00:12:26,066 --> 00:12:26,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about it.

194
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:29,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's the stereotypical person that's going out to buy the fireworks?

195
00:12:29,727 --> 00:12:31,388
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, the older brother.

196
00:12:31,408 --> 00:12:32,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Men that want to blow stuff up.

197
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:33,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Men that want to blow things up.

198
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:34,349
[SPEAKER_03]: No offense, Jamie.

199
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:35,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you want to blow things up, too.

200
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:36,850
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think you'd have fun with strippers.

201
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Strippers love... Here's another thing you need to keep in mind.

202
00:12:42,132 --> 00:12:44,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Strippers love other women.

203
00:12:45,113 --> 00:12:47,854
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll get way freakier with other women than they will with men.

204
00:12:48,194 --> 00:12:48,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

205
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:49,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you're a gay man.

206
00:12:49,914 --> 00:12:51,395
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this from experience, sadly.

207
00:12:52,195 --> 00:12:55,197
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the whole point of threatening.

208
00:12:57,018 --> 00:12:58,900
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it has to do with the level of threat.

209
00:13:00,241 --> 00:13:05,304
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you, if you have a stand with a bounce house and you have a stand with strippers, I'm going with the stripper stand.

210
00:13:05,544 --> 00:13:07,305
[SPEAKER_02]: How about a stand with strippers and a bounce house?

211
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:09,551
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

212
00:13:33,763 --> 00:13:45,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I've seen those bras hanging up to dry in there I'm like, oh my god A hamster could live in there Alright Actually What?

213
00:13:46,736 --> 00:13:53,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Four hamsters Alright, we love you DarkSakura and we love your breasts Tell us a little bit How was your gaming week?

214
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:55,545
[SPEAKER_03]: You did get to do some games this week, right?

215
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:57,933
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I played Star Trek Online.

216
00:13:59,414 --> 00:14:00,915
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's about it.

217
00:14:01,515 --> 00:14:02,376
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, no.

218
00:14:05,218 --> 00:14:07,339
[SPEAKER_12]: No, actually, I think that is all I played was Star Trek Online.

219
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:11,682
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I made Captain, and then I took a little break.

220
00:14:11,943 --> 00:14:16,386
[SPEAKER_12]: And now I'm trying... I have this goal to reach Admiral by Tuesday morning.

221
00:14:16,926 --> 00:14:18,127
[SPEAKER_12]: And then go have my surgery done.

222
00:14:19,648 --> 00:14:22,931
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm at Captain 5 now.

223
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:24,171
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I have...

224
00:14:26,229 --> 00:14:27,169
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

225
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,159
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

226
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:08,645
[SPEAKER_12]: Now the stuff that you actually can buy in the game, like right now they actually unlocked all of the pre-order bonuses that you can buy.

227
00:15:08,745 --> 00:15:09,666
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have everything now.

228
00:15:09,786 --> 00:15:12,688
[SPEAKER_12]: So you now can have a joint trail if you want to and I already paid.

229
00:15:13,408 --> 00:15:19,973
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I think I already paid about the equivalent anyway to have the joint trail because I got another... Anyway, long story.

230
00:15:20,694 --> 00:15:23,676
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um... I, um...

231
00:15:25,942 --> 00:15:26,763
[SPEAKER_12]: I've just been playing that.

232
00:15:26,983 --> 00:15:28,664
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have my... Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

233
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:29,785
[SPEAKER_12]: I played Peggle.

234
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:34,049
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of Peggle on my phone.

235
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

236
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:36,751
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

237
00:15:37,451 --> 00:15:39,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Any idea what you might play when you're down to one hand?

238
00:15:41,515 --> 00:15:44,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Well... Video game-wise?

239
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,560
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always Peggle.

240
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Peggle.

241
00:15:50,736 --> 00:15:52,457
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I could actually play Peggle with my phone.

242
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:53,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

243
00:15:53,818 --> 00:16:01,804
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a good thing about the iPhone, though, is that I can actually do, like, I could, I think I could actually get away with playing S-Baluga.

244
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,305
[SPEAKER_03]: You need an RPG.

245
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:03,765
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

246
00:16:04,565 --> 00:16:06,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just loan you Final Fantasy XIII this week.

247
00:16:06,327 --> 00:16:07,588
[SPEAKER_03]: That way you have an RPG to play.

248
00:16:08,148 --> 00:16:10,469
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can talk about something besides Star Trek Online on this program.

249
00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:12,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was going to try to finish Blue Dragon.

250
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,411
[SPEAKER_12]: I knew I forgot to bring something.

251
00:16:13,612 --> 00:16:16,153
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to try to finish Blue Dragon, but... Okay, well, there's that, too.

252
00:16:16,353 --> 00:16:17,434
[SPEAKER_12]: Final Fantasy XIII would be great.

253
00:16:17,854 --> 00:16:18,975
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm really looking forward to playing it.

254
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:19,636
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

255
00:16:20,576 --> 00:16:49,802

[SPEAKER_03]: You did.

257
00:16:51,063 --> 00:16:51,543
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I did.

258
00:16:52,084 --> 00:16:55,227
[SPEAKER_12]: And I made this thing which I'm about to put on the board.

259
00:16:56,368 --> 00:16:58,230
[SPEAKER_03]: At least you can take a picture and put it on our website, right?

260
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,190
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to put it on the website, yeah.

261
00:16:59,231 --> 00:16:59,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, there you go.

262
00:17:00,031 --> 00:17:02,193
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I felt crafty.

263
00:17:03,194 --> 00:17:06,357
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, let's... As in, I've not been working and I've been bored.

264
00:17:06,998 --> 00:17:07,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Bored.

265
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:09,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's move on to Loki.

266
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,301
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week?

267
00:17:11,372 --> 00:17:18,615
[SPEAKER_04]: My game week was interesting, I guess, because I had a lot of different things I played that I haven't really been playing a lot of.

268
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:25,878
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, I went back and dusted off a few music games this week, including DJ Hero.

269
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:31,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Went and played some of the new tracks in the Party Mix thing, including the Lady Gaga...

270
00:17:35,473 --> 00:17:37,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Girls on Film Remix Rock Band

271
00:17:56,871 --> 00:18:07,619
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried playing a little bit more on the medium setting because I was so used to Guitar Freaks and stuff and never really tried experimenting with playing any of the harder difficulties.

272
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:17,846
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of like how Guitar Freaks, when they ramped up the difficulty, just had more notes on the three keys instead of adding just more keys to it.

273
00:18:18,027 --> 00:18:19,848
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of like that a little bit better.

274
00:18:20,488 --> 00:18:20,929
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um...

275
00:18:22,844 --> 00:18:25,005
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it was still fun.

276
00:18:25,925 --> 00:18:31,248
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, other than music games and stuff, I've been playing a lot of Crackdown 2.

277
00:18:32,268 --> 00:18:35,369
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, it's not that different from Crackdown 1.

278
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Except they made leveling up a lot easier.

279
00:18:40,532 --> 00:18:42,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that it doesn't take as long, but...

280
00:18:44,301 --> 00:18:45,882
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't really have gangs this time.

281
00:18:45,942 --> 00:18:49,325
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just one big old gang that, you know, kind of attacks you everywhere.

282
00:18:49,405 --> 00:18:53,568
[SPEAKER_04]: And then at night you get these, like, zombie-like freaks or whatever that run around.

283
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:57,110
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's so many of them and they're so easy to kill.

284
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:05,036
[SPEAKER_04]: All you really have to do is, you know, like to level up your physical attack or whatever, you just keep hitting B over and over and over again.

285
00:19:05,516 --> 00:19:08,258
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just attacks all of them and you don't really take a lot of damage.

286
00:19:08,318 --> 00:19:11,040
[SPEAKER_04]: And say you do take a lot of damage, you just kind of jump out of the way and...

287
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:15,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait until your health comes back and then go back down there and spam B some more.

288
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:21,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this game's been getting a lot of shit in the reviews for being just like the first game.

289
00:19:22,243 --> 00:19:24,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that's fair to knock the game for that?

290
00:19:26,564 --> 00:19:27,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

291
00:19:27,704 --> 00:19:29,205
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very similar to the first game.

292
00:19:29,245 --> 00:19:32,346
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, it should be more like the first game than it is right now.

293
00:19:32,946 --> 00:19:36,607
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem I have with it is that basically it's...

294
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:39,328
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

295
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:28,759
[SPEAKER_04]: This one, though, is completely linear because, I mean, granted you can kind of run around and do different things, but they want you to hit up, you know, this one point first and you have to turn on these beacons and then once the beacons are charged up you go into kind of a protection mission almost where you have to protect the beacon from the freaks while it, you know, charges up to destroy all of them.

296
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,284
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's good and all, but it's kind of boring because all the missions are very similar.

297
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:42,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I just... I wish it was more like the first game where you had a bunch of gangs and you could kind of tackle it the way it is.

298
00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:45,472
[SPEAKER_04]: The city itself is almost identical to the first city.

299
00:20:45,892 --> 00:20:52,374
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they've got a lot of... Like, if you've played the first game, you'll definitely recognize a lot of landmarks in there, which is kind of cool.

300
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:58,255
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the strongholds where these freaks are and stuff are actually where the old bosses were in the first game.

301
00:20:58,916 --> 00:20:59,116
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

302
00:21:00,456 --> 00:21:07,364
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of, it's a little sad that some of the stuff that made the first game so good is kind of taken out.

303
00:21:07,404 --> 00:21:11,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the vehicles that transform when your driving skills is up, those aren't there anymore.

304
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:15,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, you just get actual different vehicles that have that stuff.

305
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:20,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Or all the stuff that was from the download content, the different guns and whatnot are actually in the game.

306
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:22,040
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to unlock them later on.

307
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:29,246
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's harder for me to find these different points where you're supposed to be getting gear and stuff.

308
00:21:29,306 --> 00:21:33,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you have to choose your loadout and run around.

309
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:40,395
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally you have to find the actual spots where you've captured spots on the map where you can get more ammo and stuff.

310
00:21:40,735 --> 00:21:46,301
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't matter anyways because these specialized guns that you have, you can't find ammo for them ever because the gang members don't carry them.

311
00:21:46,381 --> 00:21:50,506
[SPEAKER_04]: So once you've run out of your limited amount of ammo, you have to go just use their guns anyways.

312
00:21:51,086 --> 00:21:53,369
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt is also pointing out something that's missing.

313
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:57,193
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like the first game, he says, minus a Halo beta packed in.

314
00:21:57,533 --> 00:21:59,475
[SPEAKER_03]: That's at chat.hornslaundry.com live.

315
00:22:00,676 --> 00:22:01,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

316
00:22:22,077 --> 00:22:23,238
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

317
00:22:37,554 --> 00:22:38,035
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

318
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:58,819
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

319
00:23:21,258 --> 00:23:22,719
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hear that they're going to patch it.

320
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:28,965
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to patch it to add this feature back because it is kind of important that it should be there.

321
00:23:29,525 --> 00:23:32,107
[SPEAKER_04]: That excuse is getting old from all these companies.

322
00:23:32,207 --> 00:23:33,689
[SPEAKER_03]: It is really old.

323
00:23:33,709 --> 00:23:37,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, we didn't finish the game in time because we needed to hit our release date.

324
00:23:37,632 --> 00:23:39,654
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll patch it to fix it.

325
00:23:40,134 --> 00:23:41,615
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole promises promises.

326
00:23:42,116 --> 00:23:43,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Blame the publishers most of the time.

327
00:23:44,983 --> 00:23:45,844
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

328
00:24:07,407 --> 00:24:08,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Lisa's Game.

329
00:24:08,088 --> 00:24:08,368
[SPEAKER_04]: You think?

330
00:24:08,729 --> 00:24:08,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

331
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:11,152
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably where they'll be, somewhere you haven't looked.

332
00:24:11,572 --> 00:24:15,778
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep in mind, everything that you look for is always in the last place you looked.

333
00:24:16,866 --> 00:24:45,008
[SPEAKER_04]: so this game though does have an option where you can ping the orbs and actually see them on your map briefly so you can hit the up button on the directional pad and it'll actually ping the orbs to see where they're around so for example you're kind of looking for them and you are stuck with like two left you can ping it and see where it's at on your map and kind of give you a better idea where to zero in on it thank god for that but just like some of the other stuff that's in the game it's I don't know it's just very hard to get used to I guess

334
00:24:47,657 --> 00:24:55,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and the guy that's talking to you throughout the entire game, kind of announcing things, he's annoying.

335
00:24:55,563 --> 00:24:56,704
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't turn him off.

336
00:24:57,845 --> 00:24:58,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is annoying.

337
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:02,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he's like, you should do these road races.

338
00:25:02,729 --> 00:25:04,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I don't want to do road races right now.

339
00:25:04,731 --> 00:25:06,332
[SPEAKER_04]: You should do these road races.

340
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:08,114
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll give you more driving skill.

341
00:25:08,414 --> 00:25:10,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, there's a rooftop race you just walked by.

342
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:11,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I don't care.

343
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:16,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you should go to that beacon because it's not going to charge itself.

344
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,341
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, stop

345
00:25:22,623 --> 00:25:24,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch out, there's freaks at night.

346
00:25:24,103 --> 00:25:24,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

347
00:25:24,443 --> 00:25:27,084
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't figure that out by spending the last 20 days in the game.

348
00:25:27,124 --> 00:25:29,725
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I can't figure out that the freaks come out at night.

349
00:25:30,485 --> 00:25:32,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, watch out, there's a stronghold over here.

350
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:32,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

351
00:25:32,526 --> 00:25:33,687
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what that means on the map?

352
00:25:33,727 --> 00:25:35,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you've already told me that three times now.

353
00:25:36,607 --> 00:25:38,348
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just very annoying.

354
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,969
[SPEAKER_04]: They should have an option to tick that off.

355
00:25:42,003 --> 00:25:47,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell you once when you're starting the game because they kind of do explain everything and then be done with it.

356
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:51,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop bothering me with stuff unless it's actually important.

357
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else with your Game of the Week, Loki?

358
00:25:55,593 --> 00:25:59,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Some DS stuff, because I was finishing up the trial stuff.

359
00:26:01,217 --> 00:26:11,906
[SPEAKER_04]: So I played Peggle DS, lots of Peggle Knights on there, and a little bit of Zelda Spirit Tracks, just going through the next dungeon where I got some sort of windmill-looking thing.

360
00:26:12,246 --> 00:26:13,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, by the way, that game just...

361
00:26:15,028 --> 00:26:21,511
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what it is with some of these Zelda games, but it pretty much seems like the whole dungeon is just a tutorial of how to figure out how to use this item.

362
00:26:21,731 --> 00:26:22,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

363
00:26:22,731 --> 00:26:24,252
[SPEAKER_04]: I figured out how to use the item.

364
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:28,073
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't need to... Hey, look, you can do this puzzle with this.

365
00:26:28,173 --> 00:26:30,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hey, look, you can do this now.

366
00:26:30,734 --> 00:26:34,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Just give me the features that the item has and I'll figure the rest out.

367
00:26:34,355 --> 00:26:35,776
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't need to walk me through.

368
00:26:35,796 --> 00:26:38,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to hold my hand to figure out how to use this.

369
00:26:39,037 --> 00:26:43,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and fuck you, Nintendo, for making me blow on my DS to use this stupid item.

370
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people don't want to do that.

371
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because you have a microphone on there doesn't mean you have to use it for stupid shit like that.

372
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you still on that jury duty thing?

373
00:26:52,401 --> 00:26:53,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Or did that finally finish?

374
00:26:54,981 --> 00:27:02,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm imagining you at the courthouse playing your DS just like very slyly having to go and your DS.

375
00:27:03,323 --> 00:27:05,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I did it in the hallway, but yeah.

376
00:27:05,563 --> 00:27:07,083
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we finished up with that.

377
00:27:09,404 --> 00:27:10,924
[SPEAKER_04]: The trial went on for eight days.

378
00:27:10,944 --> 00:27:11,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

379
00:27:11,604 --> 00:27:12,825
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, quickly, what was the trial?

380
00:27:12,845 --> 00:27:13,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're all dying to know.

381
00:27:14,006 --> 00:27:14,426
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it?

382
00:27:14,446 --> 00:27:15,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Give us all the details.

383
00:27:16,047 --> 00:27:17,188
[SPEAKER_04]: The trial went on for eight days.

384
00:27:17,248 --> 00:27:23,973
[SPEAKER_04]: It was this woman by the name of Julie Mayo who had gotten fired from a printing company in Sacramento here.

385
00:27:23,993 --> 00:27:25,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Which company?

386
00:27:25,234 --> 00:27:26,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they're probably hiring.

387
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Pacific Standard Press.

388
00:27:28,716 --> 00:27:29,337
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I'm writing it down.

389
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:34,443
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they seem like a nice company because they did have pretty much everybody on the witness stand.

390
00:27:35,624 --> 00:27:43,892
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyways, she got fired from there, but she's claiming that she got fired because of racial discrimination, because she was Caucasian.

391
00:27:44,432 --> 00:27:47,375
[SPEAKER_04]: She says that this woman by the name of Grace Schneider...

392
00:27:48,516 --> 00:27:51,258
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that Loki's putting all the details out there.

393
00:27:51,298 --> 00:27:52,138
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all public record now.

394
00:27:52,158 --> 00:27:53,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's all public record, but it's funny.

395
00:27:53,979 --> 00:28:00,983
[SPEAKER_04]: So this woman, Grace Schneider, who is a Filipino, supposedly called her a white bitch or a fucking white bitch.

396
00:28:01,743 --> 00:28:05,605
[SPEAKER_04]: And because of that, you know, American lithographers... I called my sister that once.

397
00:28:05,766 --> 00:28:06,486
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the difference?

398
00:28:06,506 --> 00:28:15,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Pacific Standard Press, or in this case, the company was at the time known as American Lithographers, basically was supposedly covering it up and all this stuff.

399
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:24,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, oh, and because of that, she has suffered, you know, severe depression, agoraphobia, and post-traumatic stress disorder.

400
00:28:25,973 --> 00:28:37,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, by the way, when they were asking you the questions, you know, okay, before they were picking the jury and stuff like that, I was just like, because you can kind of get the impression of what this person is claiming is the problem.

401
00:28:37,295 --> 00:28:39,296
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're just like, what?

402
00:28:39,616 --> 00:28:40,596
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that doesn't make any sense.

403
00:28:41,196 --> 00:28:44,920
[SPEAKER_04]: So, throughout the whole trial, the plaintiff lawyer was completely retarded.

404
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Reminded me of Andy Griffith in the Matlock role.

405
00:28:49,825 --> 00:28:55,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just guessing from the way you're describing this, this was a not guilty, or what would you call it?

406
00:28:55,571 --> 00:28:56,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Not liable, right?

407
00:28:56,832 --> 00:28:57,993
[SPEAKER_03]: The person who sued lost?

408
00:28:58,414 --> 00:28:59,314
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just guessing.

409
00:28:59,334 --> 00:28:59,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

410
00:29:04,297 --> 00:29:10,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so basically, this whole trial went on for eight days, and the plaintiff lawyer, he's just completely idiotic.

411
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:12,760
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the worst lawyer I've ever seen.

412
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,702
[SPEAKER_04]: After they finished the plaintiff's case, the defense only had to say was...

413
00:29:18,402 --> 00:29:19,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

414
00:29:43,977 --> 00:29:49,639
[SPEAKER_04]: We went over the questions twice, just to be sure.

415
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:54,099
[SPEAKER_04]: But most of them were 12-0 in the favor of the defense.

416
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,820
[SPEAKER_04]: It was sad.

417
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,880
[SPEAKER_04]: We were just like, my God.

418
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was down to like 3 o'clock.

419
00:30:00,861 --> 00:30:06,542
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we didn't get deliberations done by like 4.15, we would have to come back on Friday.

420
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:07,842
[SPEAKER_04]: We're like, fuck that.

421
00:30:07,922 --> 00:30:09,082
[SPEAKER_04]: We are getting this done now.

422
00:30:09,563 --> 00:30:10,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Was she pissed?

423
00:30:12,103 --> 00:30:17,426
[SPEAKER_04]: She looked frustrated, annoyed, but she was crying and stuff throughout the whole trial.

424
00:30:18,046 --> 00:30:20,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't do that one at the end.

425
00:30:20,647 --> 00:30:27,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, but her lawyer, which wasn't really her lawyer, it was his partner came in when we had the verdict read.

426
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,751
[SPEAKER_04]: He looked pissed.

427
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:34,813
[SPEAKER_04]: And he did, of course, pull the jury, which we figured they would because we deliberated in ten minutes.

428
00:30:35,774 --> 00:30:38,195
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, whatever, I'm fucking done today.

429
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:40,076
[SPEAKER_04]: You get nothing.

430
00:30:40,676 --> 00:30:43,738
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised you weren't playing Phoenix Wright in the hallway.

431
00:30:43,778 --> 00:30:45,699
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that would be ironic, but yeah.

432
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:59,488
[SPEAKER_04]: No, she... It ended up that she was just a horrible worker and she got fired for very obvious reasons and it made no sense that she was claiming racial discrimination since the people that fired her were white.

433
00:30:59,808 --> 00:31:03,651
[SPEAKER_04]: She was replaced by a white woman and the majority of the company is white.

434
00:31:05,498 --> 00:31:06,519
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry I asked.

435
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad.

436
00:31:08,501 --> 00:31:09,122
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to know.

437
00:31:09,262 --> 00:31:10,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, I had to know after two weeks ago.

438
00:31:10,963 --> 00:31:20,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and by the way, I did some research after the trial and she had also sued other people and she has an internet business which is doing a lot better than she claimed that it was doing.

439
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:22,574
[SPEAKER_04]: So she's a lying bitch.

440
00:31:23,635 --> 00:31:26,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Allegedly.

441
00:31:26,858 --> 00:31:27,899
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need a trial for that.

442
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,401
[SPEAKER_12]: I just totally hate people that do that crap.

443
00:31:30,861 --> 00:31:38,726
[SPEAKER_04]: The plaintiff lawyer kept calling his client Mr. instead of Mrs. He kept screwing up the gender of different people on the witness stand or whatever.

444
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:39,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Kept repeating stuff.

445
00:31:39,907 --> 00:31:41,748
[SPEAKER_04]: He would fuck up their names all the time.

446
00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:46,732
[SPEAKER_04]: And he misspelled examining on his little board in his closing arguments.

447
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:47,772
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awesome.

448
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:48,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Video games.

449
00:31:48,913 --> 00:31:49,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to video games.

450
00:31:49,914 --> 00:31:50,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

451
00:31:50,434 --> 00:31:51,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Real life Phoenix Wright.

452
00:31:51,855 --> 00:31:53,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew, hey, you gonna try and follow that up?

453
00:31:53,796 --> 00:31:54,837
[SPEAKER_03]: What have you been playing this week?

454
00:31:56,598 --> 00:31:57,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot top that.

455
00:31:57,939 --> 00:31:58,439
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a little

456
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:02,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Played a little bit of WoW and a lot of Left 4 Dead 2.

457
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:09,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Towards the end of the Steam sale, a friend of mine gifted me Grand Theft Auto 4 for PC, so I was playing some of that.

458
00:32:09,621 --> 00:32:11,082
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

459
00:32:11,402 --> 00:32:13,842
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually made my system work for once.

460
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:18,883
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've just been playing a whole lot of Left 4 Dead 2.

461
00:32:19,483 --> 00:32:20,544
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoy Ellis.

462
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:21,384
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a motormouth.

463
00:32:22,684 --> 00:32:27,445
[SPEAKER_02]: And aside from that, my gaming week has been pretty boring.

464
00:32:28,982 --> 00:32:30,963
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

465
00:32:46,661 --> 00:32:47,001
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot.

466
00:32:47,642 --> 00:32:51,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I managed to restrain myself since my funding's a little tight.

467
00:32:52,445 --> 00:32:53,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I spent about $30, $35.

468
00:32:54,247 --> 00:32:58,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought Flat Out Ultimate Carnage for $2.

469
00:32:58,970 --> 00:32:59,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

470
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Left 4 Dead 2 for $20, and I was pissed when they dropped it down to $10.

471
00:33:03,474 --> 00:33:06,236
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like playing the stock market.

472
00:33:06,556 --> 00:33:07,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone gifted me GTA 4.

473
00:33:08,097 --> 00:33:08,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's nice.

474
00:33:09,338 --> 00:33:15,683
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got one other game, and I can't remember what it was, but I think I spent in total about $30.

475
00:33:15,723 --> 00:33:15,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

476
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:17,496
[SPEAKER_11]: This game is great.

477
00:33:17,536 --> 00:33:18,497
[SPEAKER_11]: It's called Blood Bowl.

478
00:33:19,657 --> 00:33:22,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's Warhammer Sports.

479
00:33:22,598 --> 00:33:23,778
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, I think that's hilarious.

480
00:33:24,339 --> 00:33:26,119
[SPEAKER_02]: It is hilarious, every single bit of it.

481
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:29,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me transition into my week a little bit, and I'll talk about what I bought on Steam.

482
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:36,562
[SPEAKER_03]: I was gifted the Civ IV Complete Collection for my birthday, because that went down to about, I think it was like $10 at one point, so I got that as a gift, which was awesome.

483
00:33:36,863 --> 00:33:40,124
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did play a little bit of Civ IV this week, got back into Crackalization.

484
00:33:40,784 --> 00:33:42,064
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried, I tried.

485
00:33:42,224 --> 00:33:44,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's fun, but it's a lot...

486
00:33:45,326 --> 00:34:11,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly think the console versions of Civilization as much as they're hated by some of the core Civ community I think they are really good entry level games so like if you've never played a Civ game before maybe start with the console ones but I don't think the PC ones are that inaccessible they've got good tutorials but I played that a little bit Team Fortress 2 I finally bought I played that a little bit but man I am horrible at first person shooters I was sucking in the tutorial levels it's sad

487
00:34:11,926 --> 00:34:18,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, if it was hard before, it's a clusterfuck now that they've pushed the engineer update.

488
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:19,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no.

489
00:34:20,231 --> 00:34:25,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Now engineers can pick up, carry, and set down their sentries.

490
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:33,839
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the server I was testing it on, I played for two hours, nine engineers on ten-man teams.

491
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:34,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wow.

492
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,060
[SPEAKER_02]: And the tenth man was a spy.

493
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie and I still have to have our match.

494
00:34:37,901 --> 00:34:38,982
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't get around to that.

495
00:34:39,322 --> 00:34:39,843
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we didn't.

496
00:34:39,903 --> 00:34:40,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still learning how to play.

497
00:34:41,044 --> 00:34:43,345
[SPEAKER_12]: See, I would probably play a team of all scouts.

498
00:34:43,546 --> 00:34:46,568
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll have to be after the hand thing.

499
00:34:46,748 --> 00:34:48,589
[SPEAKER_12]: Just because they have the best taunts.

500
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:52,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's one thing that kind of, and maybe you know this, Drew.

501
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:54,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, I didn't spend a lot of time with it.

502
00:34:54,714 --> 00:34:56,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't get my 360 controller to work right with it.

503
00:34:57,196 --> 00:34:59,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I do something wrong or does it not really work?

504
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:02,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually never tried using a controller for Team Fortress 2.

505
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:09,921
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I am very against the idea of using a console controller to play a first-person shooter.

506
00:35:10,362 --> 00:35:10,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

507
00:35:10,922 --> 00:35:11,742
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing wrong with it.

508
00:35:11,882 --> 00:35:13,303
[SPEAKER_02]: It's personal taste.

509
00:35:13,343 --> 00:35:14,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I find a mouse to be more precise.

510
00:35:15,023 --> 00:35:16,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of those great internet debates.

511
00:35:16,784 --> 00:35:23,267
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep in mind, when we were all playing Final Fantasy XI, I was playing with a controller.

512
00:35:24,192 --> 00:35:26,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that game was designed for the PS2, really.

513
00:35:26,474 --> 00:35:33,321
[SPEAKER_12]: But I could, you know, break out all my macros like that and people were like, why are you using a controller?

514
00:35:34,182 --> 00:35:41,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to say I bought this real quick because it's awesome, even though I didn't get a chance to touch it this week, but I bought the complete XCOM collection for like five bucks.

515
00:35:42,691 --> 00:35:44,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted the old school XCOM games.

516
00:35:44,452 --> 00:35:47,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I never had the chance to play through those, but I heard they were good.

517
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:47,793
[SPEAKER_02]: They're good.

518
00:35:48,033 --> 00:35:49,654
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to play them later.

519
00:35:49,674 --> 00:35:50,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Space Harrier.

520
00:35:50,935 --> 00:35:51,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

521
00:35:51,635 --> 00:35:52,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Other games I played this week.

522
00:35:52,675 --> 00:35:54,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I played Warcraft because I always fucking play Warcraft.

523
00:35:54,756 --> 00:35:55,637
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want to talk about some other games.

524
00:35:56,097 --> 00:35:57,497
[SPEAKER_03]: LOL Random Game of the Week.

525
00:35:57,817 --> 00:36:00,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Star Wars The Force Unleashed.

526
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:02,399
[SPEAKER_03]: That game's only about, what, two and a half years old?

527
00:36:02,459 --> 00:36:03,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I finally got around to playing it this week.

528
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,804
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the other game I bought.

529
00:36:06,844 --> 00:36:08,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Star Wars Empire at War.

530
00:36:08,526 --> 00:36:10,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, I'm glad I could help jog your memory there.

531
00:36:11,428 --> 00:36:24,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I played The Force Unleashed, which you might remember the talk about this one because this was the one where Soul Calibur IV had Yoda, Darth Vader, and then The Apprentice, who's also known as Starkiller.

532
00:36:24,498 --> 00:36:26,460
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was his game, was The Force Unleashed.

533
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Although you start the game playing as Vader, which I thought was kind of cool.

534
00:36:29,943 --> 00:36:30,283
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like...

535
00:36:30,663 --> 00:36:32,085
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

536
00:36:51,604 --> 00:36:52,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

537
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:14,433
[SPEAKER_03]: The mechanic seemed to be a lot of fling things around.

538
00:37:14,493 --> 00:37:15,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Fling this and fling that.

539
00:37:16,754 --> 00:37:18,075
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also a really hard game.

540
00:37:19,817 --> 00:37:22,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I died within five minutes when I first started.

541
00:37:22,598 --> 00:37:25,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, whoa, I gotta approach this a little differently than I've been doing.

542
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,182
[SPEAKER_03]: LucasArts games have never been particularly forgiving.

543
00:37:28,683 --> 00:37:30,904
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would not say it's a bad game by any means.

544
00:37:30,944 --> 00:37:32,405
[SPEAKER_03]: It was neat.

545
00:37:32,745 --> 00:37:35,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I think especially if I was more of a... See, I'm more of a Trekkie.

546
00:37:35,167 --> 00:37:38,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Hate me if you want, but... I think if I was more into Star Wars, I would probably...

547
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:40,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Really like this.

548
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:42,892
[SPEAKER_03]: And I liked it enough as it is.

549
00:37:42,952 --> 00:37:43,372
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cool.

550
00:37:43,672 --> 00:37:47,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, granted, it's a little old now, but you can probably get it cheap if you're a budget gamer.

551
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I can't get it cheaper than it was at the time.

552
00:37:50,796 --> 00:37:50,997
[SPEAKER_02]: It was $7.50.

553
00:37:55,479 --> 00:37:57,281
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

554
00:38:17,105 --> 00:38:23,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Puzzle Quest 2 is sort of the LOL Galactrix didn't really happen kind of game because remember there actually was already a Puzzle Quest 2.

555
00:38:24,891 --> 00:38:29,634
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Puzzle Quest 2 back to swords and magic and sorcery type of game.

556
00:38:30,115 --> 00:38:37,100
[SPEAKER_03]: But I noticed right off the bat, and this actually threw me for a loop, they kind of did away with the world map in the first game.

557
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,281
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's more of this isometric...

558
00:38:40,242 --> 00:38:40,842
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

559
00:39:02,978 --> 00:39:03,839
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

560
00:39:19,138 --> 00:39:19,699
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

561
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:40,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

562
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:18,716
[SPEAKER_03]: and as you level up Iron Knuckles you can either use a sword or a shield depending on your class or possibly a poison if you're an assassin I think sorcerers do like magic or mana pool regeneration things

563
00:40:19,136 --> 00:40:21,418
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sort of like a wild card depending on your class.

564
00:40:21,538 --> 00:40:22,759
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of like that mechanic.

565
00:40:22,819 --> 00:40:24,700
[SPEAKER_03]: It really adds an interesting twist to it.

566
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:30,204
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really the biggest change between Puzzle Quest 1 and 2 in regards to how the game works.

567
00:40:30,664 --> 00:40:37,128
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's another thing you should also know is that now the size of the board will change depending on what you're battling.

568
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:40,731
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes you battle these big bears and there's a huge board to go with it.

569
00:40:41,131 --> 00:40:41,891
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kind of like that.

570
00:40:41,911 --> 00:40:43,873
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes some squares will remain inaccessible.

571
00:40:44,513 --> 00:40:48,496
[SPEAKER_03]: There are still some mini games like picking locks, bashing down doors.

572
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:54,740
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are all pretty much give or take the variations on Bejeweled you've seen before.

573
00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:09,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, does anyone remember an Xbox Live game, and I think this is on Facebook and stuff too, called Jewel Quest, where the goal wasn't to match three in a row, but was to make every square on the board gold by matching a piece on that square?

574
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:10,110
[SPEAKER_11]: I think so.

575
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:14,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that is the Search the Room minigame in Puzzle Quest 2.

576
00:41:14,773 --> 00:41:18,155
[SPEAKER_03]: So lots of little variations that you're kind of used to seeing.

577
00:41:19,496 --> 00:41:47,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was neat I enjoyed it and I played a hell of a lot of it so I think that says something about it and you know for 15 bucks on Xbox Live it's a pretty good deal 30 bucks on the DS so not sure what that's all about well I do it costs more to make a cartridge than it does to push something digitally but I could see where the allure of being able to take it with you would be but I'll probably try to play a little bit more on Xbox Live I need to because you know how well I'm doing on my Beat 3 games goal

578
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,166
[SPEAKER_03]: I've beaten zero.

579
00:41:50,047 --> 00:41:50,947
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe I'll beat this one.

580
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:51,267
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

581
00:41:52,828 --> 00:41:54,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, you guys ready to get into some gaming news?

582
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:56,711
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess.

583
00:41:56,731 --> 00:41:57,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally.

584
00:41:57,111 --> 00:41:58,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me do some housekeeping real quick here.

585
00:42:00,593 --> 00:42:01,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Join us on our Facebook, please.

[SPEAKER_03]: You can join our community there.

[SPEAKER_03]: We post news when the shows are coming out and so forth.

589
00:42:09,298 --> 00:42:10,139
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also on Twitter.

591
00:42:17,464 --> 00:42:19,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even going to plug Myspace anymore.

592
00:42:19,546 --> 00:42:20,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Is anyone here using Myspace?

593
00:42:20,688 --> 00:42:20,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone?

594
00:42:21,149 --> 00:42:22,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone in chat using Myspace?

595
00:42:23,051 --> 00:42:24,173
[SPEAKER_03]: My butt.

596
00:42:25,054 --> 00:42:25,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I should just delete it.

597
00:42:27,489 --> 00:42:28,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

598
00:42:49,898 --> 00:42:59,143
[SPEAKER_02]: If you browse GameFAQs, I'll try to leave notes about Orange Lounge Radio's next shows up on the current events message board.

599
00:42:59,623 --> 00:43:00,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's awesome.

600
00:43:00,464 --> 00:43:00,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

601
00:43:01,264 --> 00:43:03,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen people put it in their signatures and stuff too, and I love that.

602
00:43:03,806 --> 00:43:05,707
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so generous of folks to do.

603
00:43:06,107 --> 00:43:06,607
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the wiki

604
00:43:23,587 --> 00:43:25,228
[SPEAKER_12]: Have people actually updated stuff?

605
00:43:26,128 --> 00:43:30,489
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few dedicated, like Dark Tetsuya, AJ Mix, and I think I've seen a few others.

606
00:43:30,509 --> 00:43:34,771
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very dedicated, and they're very good generals of the oil army for keeping that stuff up to date.

607
00:43:35,311 --> 00:43:37,071
[SPEAKER_03]: But it could use more.

608
00:43:37,811 --> 00:43:40,012
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping people... Crack on it.

609
00:43:40,112 --> 00:43:40,652
[SPEAKER_12]: Get to it.

610
00:43:42,273 --> 00:43:43,153
[SPEAKER_03]: We need other contributors.

611
00:43:43,193 --> 00:43:43,433
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

612
00:43:44,113 --> 00:43:45,534
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, a comment in our chat room.

613
00:43:45,594 --> 00:43:47,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft says, nobody uses MySpace anymore.

614
00:43:47,514 --> 00:43:48,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's how I felt.

615
00:43:48,655 --> 00:43:49,075
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I felt.

616
00:43:49,934 --> 00:43:53,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into some actual gaming news here and talk about what's going on in the gaming world.

617
00:43:54,016 --> 00:43:54,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what's up?

618
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is kind of interesting.

619
00:43:57,677 --> 00:44:05,340
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be kind of changing up how people look at Xbox Live Arcade.

620
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:13,863
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, it reminds me a little bit of the PlayStation Network, kind of, what they're doing.

621
00:44:14,783 --> 00:44:16,483
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Destination Arcade.

622
00:44:16,963 --> 00:44:21,084
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a visual browser of the Xbox Live Arcade stuff.

623
00:44:21,544 --> 00:44:30,266
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a bunch of different things on there, including you can check out the new arrivals, check out some of the new stuff, actually just browse through titles.

624
00:44:30,806 --> 00:44:36,787
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have recommendations based off of different purchases.

625
00:44:38,128 --> 00:44:39,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of neat stuff.

626
00:44:40,868 --> 00:44:44,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, kind of a way to maybe see some better screenshots.

627
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:50,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, they have this all kind of now, but they're making, I guess, a little bit easier to view.

628
00:44:51,073 --> 00:44:57,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know with a lot of the titles that are out there now, it may make it a little difficult to browse for what you're looking for.

629
00:44:57,536 --> 00:45:00,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially, God, if you were looking for indie games.

630
00:45:00,978 --> 00:45:03,939
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really difficult to find now.

631
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:05,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope this includes indie games.

632
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:10,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was going to say, have we heard anything about the indie games and the incorporation of that?

633
00:45:10,905 --> 00:45:11,026
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

634
00:45:13,496 --> 00:45:13,836
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

635
00:45:14,437 --> 00:45:22,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, I mean, if they're doing this with Xbox Live Arcade and the indie games are almost like Xbox Live Arcade stuff, I don't see why they couldn't include it.

636
00:45:23,124 --> 00:45:34,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we haven't heard a lot about this next patch in general, and usually there's a lot of fanfare about what's coming up in these big, you know, it used to be biannual, now it's just, what, annual?

637
00:45:34,414 --> 00:45:35,615
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know how often they do it.

638
00:45:35,655 --> 00:45:37,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's kind of like whatever they feel like, isn't it?

639
00:45:37,116 --> 00:45:37,957
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still biannual.

640
00:45:37,997 --> 00:45:40,319
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, this dashboard update...

641
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not even that.

642
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,821
[SPEAKER_04]: That was just another update.

643
00:45:45,641 --> 00:45:50,162
[SPEAKER_04]: This update, actually, with the visual browser is supposed to be happening, I believe, this month.

644
00:45:50,502 --> 00:45:50,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

645
00:45:51,422 --> 00:45:54,223
[SPEAKER_04]: So, any week now.

646
00:45:54,523 --> 00:45:55,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it should be coming soon.

647
00:45:58,543 --> 00:46:01,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Have they said anything else about what else we might see implemented?

648
00:46:01,444 --> 00:46:06,165
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my assumption is that all this Kinect stuff is probably the big thing that's going to be in it, but...

649
00:46:06,962 --> 00:46:11,787
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think the Kinect stuff is actually going to be in there until it actually comes out on the 4th.

650
00:46:11,807 --> 00:46:20,215
[SPEAKER_04]: If anything, I would guess that we're going to get that patch pushed to us probably either, I'd say the end of October is when we're going to see the Kinect patch.

651
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:21,916
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll kind of unlock all that stuff.

652
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,261
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I mean, it looks interesting.

653
00:46:27,441 --> 00:46:31,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess there'll be, I don't know, we'll have to check out when it actually comes out.

654
00:46:33,117 --> 00:46:41,231
[SPEAKER_04]: it's nice I guess but honestly I've never had a problem finding stuff on Xbox Live Arcade but I can see where you might if you don't know what you're looking for

655
00:46:42,123 --> 00:46:52,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft seems to say in our chatroom here, I'm just kind of summarizing what he's saying, that this whole new interface seems a lot like the Rock Band store, the Guitar Hero store, and the Music Shop.

656
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:56,769
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't used those in a while because I haven't really been buying download content.

657
00:46:56,849 --> 00:46:58,089
[SPEAKER_04]: I've used the Rock Band one before.

658
00:46:58,209 --> 00:46:59,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't used it in a while either, but I've used it before.

659
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:04,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I haven't used it, let's say, in Xbox Live.

660
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:06,532
[SPEAKER_04]: I've used it in Rock Band 2.

661
00:47:07,753 --> 00:47:09,373
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot different on Xbox Live.

662
00:47:09,433 --> 00:47:11,014
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like this whole standalone app.

663
00:47:11,914 --> 00:47:29,629
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can listen to clips and everything without having to actually launch the game which is interesting but what's also weird is that it shows up in your played games history I think it's really just a mini game in a way, I don't know if that makes sense but I think that's how Xbox kind of recognizes it as a miniature free game if you will

664
00:47:32,131 --> 00:47:35,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft also hits us with another good comment here.

665
00:47:35,055 --> 00:47:40,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.OrangeLauncher.com says, I think they won't add the indie games since they aren't available outside the US and other countries.

666
00:47:41,323 --> 00:47:42,744
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'll only be for arcade stuff.

667
00:47:42,764 --> 00:47:44,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand why they wouldn't be out.

668
00:47:44,647 --> 00:47:46,188
[SPEAKER_04]: They really should open it up to everybody.

669
00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:50,614
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the other features that you can do in this is you can actually recommend games for friends.

670
00:47:52,249 --> 00:47:59,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, I thought, now I realize Actdeft is in Mexico, so maybe that is true about Mexico, but I thought Japan had the indie games too, because aren't there some indie games being made over there?

671
00:48:00,136 --> 00:48:06,541
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there's some Japanese indie games that are on the service already, so I assumed that they were in those regions as well.

672
00:48:06,701 --> 00:48:10,465
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just kind of outside of the big regions where you're not seeing this.

673
00:48:10,565 --> 00:48:14,008
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I say big regions, I say Japan, US, UK, basically.

674
00:48:14,648 --> 00:48:15,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

675
00:48:15,269 --> 00:48:15,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

676
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:22,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, we'll see what happens with this store when it launches or whenever we get a patch date.

677
00:48:23,178 --> 00:48:23,639
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

678
00:48:23,999 --> 00:48:27,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, did you know that there's a game called Justin Bieber Revenge?

679
00:48:28,382 --> 00:48:28,743
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

680
00:48:29,063 --> 00:48:33,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there's actually a video game called Justin Bieber Revenge.

681
00:48:33,847 --> 00:48:38,430
[SPEAKER_03]: And I imagine that Justin Bieber just takes out an Uzi into that crowd of screaming fangirls.

682
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:41,953
[SPEAKER_12]: I found a game going through apps real quick that I have to share off topic.

683
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:43,895
[SPEAKER_12]: Vuvuzela vs. Zombies.

684
00:48:46,681 --> 00:48:48,922
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see Justin Bieber vs. Vuvuzela.

685
00:48:49,823 --> 00:48:58,007
[SPEAKER_04]: The other day when I was driving home, I saw a guy with one of those blowing it out the window of his car.

686
00:48:58,027 --> 00:49:00,409
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, what the hell?

687
00:49:00,689 --> 00:49:02,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, it's all the rage, I guess.

688
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:11,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Destined to become, you know, when they have the I Love the 2010, you know, many years from now, snarky B-list comics commenting on the Vuvuzela.

689
00:49:12,526 --> 00:49:14,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Take that Vuvuzela and shove it up your butt.

690
00:49:15,929 --> 00:49:18,191
[SPEAKER_03]: It just sounds like... It'd probably improve the sound.

691
00:49:18,452 --> 00:49:18,992
[SPEAKER_03]: God.

692
00:49:19,733 --> 00:49:20,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here it is.

693
00:49:21,154 --> 00:49:22,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Justin Bieber Revenge.

694
00:49:22,355 --> 00:49:25,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, what it really is... You heard of Tap Tap Revenge on the App Store, right?

695
00:49:26,359 --> 00:49:28,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Tap Tap Revenge has all these spin-off games.

696
00:49:28,902 --> 00:49:35,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Lady Gaga Revenge, Dave Matthews Band Revenge, and... Nickelback Revenge.

697
00:49:37,492 --> 00:49:54,899
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that should go the other way around Nickelback should not be having revenge on me I should be having revenge on Nickelback for being on the radio or Justin Bieber here's the thing I don't listen to radio stations that play Justin Bieber but unfortunately Nickelback is crap the only time I've ever seen him was when I was waiting for more comedy in Saturday Night Live

698
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:56,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Disney.com.

699
00:50:21,638 --> 00:50:24,439
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, Disney bought Tapulous.

700
00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:33,503
[SPEAKER_03]: So now they are a part of Disney Interactive Media, which is interesting because we've seen kind of more and more from Disney Interactive Media come out in the past couple years.

701
00:50:33,543 --> 00:50:36,164
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Split Second, Tron is coming out soon.

702
00:50:36,504 --> 00:50:38,465
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little more than just the kiddie games.

703
00:50:40,526 --> 00:50:40,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Predator.

704
00:50:42,086 --> 00:50:42,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Turok was Disney Tap Tap Revenge

705
00:51:03,098 --> 00:51:04,239
[SPEAKER_03]: It's... whatever.

706
00:51:04,299 --> 00:51:11,322
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just an... I've played the game and it's like one of those things that's... Oh yeah, and Black Wolf points out a good one that's important.

707
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:15,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Epic Mickey, which is a very different direction for the Disney franchise, is also there.

708
00:51:15,604 --> 00:51:16,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really when you look at it.

709
00:51:17,084 --> 00:51:17,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

710
00:51:18,485 --> 00:51:26,212
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have been if they had kept it to its original wonder awesomeness with all the really twisted shit.

711
00:51:26,633 --> 00:51:31,497
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the end, it's going to be as twisted as the Alice in Wonderland movie was.

712
00:51:31,517 --> 00:51:34,259
[SPEAKER_03]: There's definitely a dark side to it.

713
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark-sided?

714
00:51:36,121 --> 00:51:36,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a little bit of that.

715
00:51:37,142 --> 00:51:37,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me put it this way.

716
00:51:38,443 --> 00:51:43,548
[SPEAKER_04]: The equivalent of what Epic Mickey should have been and what it's going to be, it would be like...

717
00:51:44,148 --> 00:51:53,855
[SPEAKER_04]: If the original Epic Mickey is like American McGee's Alice versus what it's going to be is like Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland.

718
00:51:53,915 --> 00:51:55,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Kill the mouse, take his house.

719
00:51:55,376 --> 00:51:56,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Kill the mouse, take his house.

720
00:51:57,978 --> 00:51:58,199
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

721
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:02,442
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it was supposed to be with Oswald going nuts.

722
00:52:02,962 --> 00:52:03,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

723
00:52:03,663 --> 00:52:03,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

724
00:52:05,764 --> 00:52:07,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Oswald's in the thing, right?

725
00:52:07,645 --> 00:52:10,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but he's not as nuts, apparently.

726
00:52:10,888 --> 00:52:12,269
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have been, you know...

727
00:52:13,633 --> 00:52:14,534
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they need to do.

728
00:52:14,654 --> 00:52:16,915
[SPEAKER_03]: American McGee's, you know, Epic Mickey.

729
00:52:18,236 --> 00:52:21,518
[SPEAKER_03]: AJ Mix in our chatroom actually says the game used to be called Tap Tap Revolution.

730
00:52:21,698 --> 00:52:23,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Going back to this whole Tap Tap Revenge thing.

731
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:29,023
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, just kind of like a little aside, apparently like Step Mania is now on the iPhone.

732
00:52:29,224 --> 00:52:29,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you hear that?

733
00:52:29,804 --> 00:52:30,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, I did.

734
00:52:30,965 --> 00:52:32,326
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's Tap Mania.

735
00:52:32,986 --> 00:52:42,733
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, what's really weird about it, like, and I haven't played with the app, so I don't fully understand how this works, but apparently you can load MP3s into the app.

736
00:52:44,093 --> 00:53:11,831
[SPEAKER_03]: but not via the iTunes interface which I can't believe Apple approved that like there seems to be something there like and again I haven't had hands on with it but apparently you can load your own mp3s and step files into this app and that doesn't seem to be something that usually Apple's very supportive of unless it's they're just claiming to do that via like the smzips format or something like that where you can just zip up the whole file and just throw it in there

737
00:53:12,891 --> 00:53:15,432
[SPEAKER_04]: with the steps and the backgrounds and all that fun stuff.

738
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:16,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

739
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:19,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Blackwolf is saying that it was a homebrew app back in the day.

740
00:53:19,653 --> 00:53:20,934
[SPEAKER_03]: It even worked with your own music.

741
00:53:20,994 --> 00:53:22,754
[SPEAKER_03]: People submitted note charts and it was awesome.

742
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:25,095
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the app store came out and they went all legit.

743
00:53:25,115 --> 00:53:26,015
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess that's a history.

744
00:53:26,055 --> 00:53:32,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now you've got Tapmania is, I guess, the rogue renegade tap-tap revenge or whatever.

745
00:53:34,608 --> 00:53:35,709
[SPEAKER_04]: But does anybody care?

746
00:53:35,909 --> 00:53:42,453
[SPEAKER_03]: All I can say is that apps in general effing suck on my 3G now, ever since iOS 4 came out.

747
00:53:42,473 --> 00:53:45,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought iOS 4 was going to be awesome, but it really slowed down the 3G.

748
00:53:46,355 --> 00:53:48,036
[SPEAKER_12]: Mine's been pretty awesome.

749
00:53:48,456 --> 00:53:49,597
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have a 3GS.

750
00:53:50,057 --> 00:53:54,860
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always been my impression of the iPhone, is it was supposed to be awesome, but it just sucked.

751
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:56,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, can we move on?

752
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Apple, hey, you can even take that back to Apple.

753
00:54:00,082 --> 00:54:03,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Disney bought Tap Revenge, people.

754
00:54:03,104 --> 00:54:05,045
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what comes of that in the future.

755
00:54:05,406 --> 00:54:07,927
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just waiting for Jonas Brothers Revenge.

756
00:54:08,007 --> 00:54:08,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't wait.

757
00:54:09,388 --> 00:54:09,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't wait.

758
00:54:09,989 --> 00:54:11,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Miley Cyrus Revenge.

759
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:12,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Goody, goody.

760
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:13,631
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you got for us, DarkSakra?

761
00:54:14,332 --> 00:54:23,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, this is something that has been on the mind of many a World of Warcraft and StarCraft II player about the real ID.

762
00:54:23,258 --> 00:54:23,758
[SPEAKER_12]: Here we go!

763
00:54:24,038 --> 00:54:24,318
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

764
00:54:26,384 --> 00:54:29,849
[SPEAKER_12]: and this news comes from Geek Life, plug, plug.

765
00:54:30,891 --> 00:54:31,973
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Geek Dash Life.

766
00:54:32,033 --> 00:54:32,634
[SPEAKER_03]: That's important.

767
00:54:32,954 --> 00:54:35,297
[SPEAKER_03]: What's Geek Life without the dash take you to?

768
00:54:35,598 --> 00:54:35,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Porn?

769
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:37,060
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

770
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:37,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna look.

771
00:54:38,662 --> 00:54:39,724
[SPEAKER_03]: But the dash is important.

772
00:54:42,573 --> 00:54:56,196
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, there's a certain thing that happened after one of the forum moderators revealed his name and someone managed to basically put out all of his personal information out in plain view.

773
00:54:56,996 --> 00:54:59,077
[SPEAKER_12]: So they said, yeah, we're not going to do that on the forum.

774
00:54:59,237 --> 00:54:59,557
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

775
00:55:00,917 --> 00:55:01,177
[SPEAKER_12]: Oops.

776
00:55:01,517 --> 00:55:01,877
[SPEAKER_12]: Our bad.

777
00:55:02,397 --> 00:55:04,618
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine for everyone else, just not us.

778
00:55:06,687 --> 00:55:08,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I use the official Star Trek Online ones.

779
00:55:19,383 --> 00:55:21,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Tech support, but it's World of Warcraft.

780
00:55:21,083 --> 00:55:22,003
[SPEAKER_03]: It should never be broken.

781
00:55:22,144 --> 00:55:27,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Geek Life is like a podcast or something, but their site's kind of ugly.

782
00:55:27,164 --> 00:55:27,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, no offense.

783
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:29,245
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just very disorganized.

784
00:55:29,345 --> 00:55:30,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, but Geek-Life is great.

785
00:55:31,005 --> 00:55:31,505
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, it is.

786
00:55:31,565 --> 00:55:32,325
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fantastic.

787
00:55:32,445 --> 00:55:35,346
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've started doing a blog on there now called Tales from the Vault.

788
00:55:35,526 --> 00:55:35,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

789
00:55:35,646 --> 00:55:37,206
[SPEAKER_12]: Which will be mirrored on Orange Island.

790
00:55:37,266 --> 00:55:39,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to rant, so let's get through this story because I'm ready to rant.

791
00:55:39,887 --> 00:55:42,367
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I said everything while you were looking up the other sites.

792
00:55:42,427 --> 00:55:43,267
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I was curious.

793
00:55:43,868 --> 00:55:46,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Believe me, I have been closely following...

794
00:55:46,548 --> 00:55:48,149
[SPEAKER_03]: What's been going on with this whole real ID thing?

795
00:55:48,169 --> 00:55:49,390
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to find you, Rob.

796
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:50,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Just have it, Rob.

797
00:55:50,071 --> 00:55:50,431
[SPEAKER_03]: They will.

798
00:55:50,631 --> 00:55:51,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

799
00:55:51,512 --> 00:55:52,733
[SPEAKER_03]: The forums, okay?

800
00:55:53,353 --> 00:55:54,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously it was a bad idea.

801
00:55:54,774 --> 00:55:58,717
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, you do have to post there for tech support sometimes and if you want to contact the GMs.

802
00:55:58,737 --> 00:55:59,298
[SPEAKER_03]: You know why?

803
00:55:59,578 --> 00:56:05,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when you call Blizzard, you're going to wait on hold for 45 minutes if you can even get through at all.

804
00:56:06,243 --> 00:56:08,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Trolls don't care and it will give them more ammo.

805
00:56:31,881 --> 00:56:37,108
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to get rid of 7 eighths of your posters, at least, by doing that.

806
00:56:37,128 --> 00:56:38,731
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, why do you want to shoot yourself in the foot?

807
00:56:39,091 --> 00:56:41,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you want to do advertising on your forums someday?

808
00:56:41,034 --> 00:56:42,676
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got it.

809
00:56:42,696 --> 00:56:43,778
[SPEAKER_03]: They still do advertising.

810
00:56:43,878 --> 00:56:44,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

811
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:48,284
[SPEAKER_02]: It cuts down on bandwidth cost if you lose most of your forum users.

812
00:56:49,502 --> 00:56:50,263
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the genius.

813
00:56:50,303 --> 00:56:50,843
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the genius.

814
00:56:50,863 --> 00:56:51,664
[SPEAKER_02]: They're fucking Blizzard.

815
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:53,525
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't need to cut back on that.

816
00:56:53,625 --> 00:56:57,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, they're running a computer game with 11 million people subscribing.

817
00:56:57,988 --> 00:57:02,011
[SPEAKER_03]: And soon, a huge game that's going to just turn Korea upside down.

818
00:57:02,411 --> 00:57:04,193
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're going to have Diablo 3.

819
00:57:04,253 --> 00:57:06,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Lord knows what's going to happen with that.

820
00:57:06,194 --> 00:57:08,215
[SPEAKER_03]: And isn't Blizzard... They have the bandwidth, Drew.

821
00:57:08,256 --> 00:57:11,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't Blizzard a company that they can just make up a mount and just sell it for $25?

822
00:57:12,018 --> 00:57:13,940
[SPEAKER_04]: And people are like, oh, we got a new mount!

823
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Sparkle ponies!

824
00:57:15,661 --> 00:57:16,521
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty sick.

825
00:57:16,622 --> 00:57:18,383
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, now, if they had sparkle ponies...

826
00:57:18,703 --> 00:57:19,824
[SPEAKER_03]: They do have Sparkle Ponies!

827
00:57:20,064 --> 00:57:20,745
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I still didn't play.

828
00:57:20,965 --> 00:57:23,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well I was going to say, that was a couple months ago.

829
00:57:23,667 --> 00:57:25,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, we were promised a pony.

830
00:57:25,049 --> 00:57:25,589
[SPEAKER_03]: $25 Sparkle Ponies.

831
00:57:25,889 --> 00:57:26,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, look.

832
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:27,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

833
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:29,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the forum thing was dumb.

834
00:57:29,973 --> 00:57:34,056
[SPEAKER_03]: There were people that were like, yay, no more trolls on the forum, yay, yay.

835
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:37,980
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's kind of like, okay, well now you can just sit there and talk to yourself, I suppose.

836
00:57:38,861 --> 00:57:41,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think the official forums are that bad.

837
00:57:42,043 --> 00:57:44,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yes, there's trolls, but...

838
00:57:45,802 --> 00:57:47,843
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, where on the internet aren't there trolls?

839
00:57:47,903 --> 00:57:51,044
[SPEAKER_03]: There's trolls in the reviews for Orange Lounge Radio on iTunes.

840
00:57:51,264 --> 00:57:52,885
[SPEAKER_03]: There's trolls everywhere, you guys.

841
00:57:53,145 --> 00:58:05,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand how it's going to cut down on trolls because say I have my real name up there, you know, whether my name is like, you know, Troll Guy or, you know, Matt, I can still troll people.

842
00:58:05,211 --> 00:58:07,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, look, they're not doing it anymore.

843
00:58:07,672 --> 00:58:07,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

844
00:58:08,812 --> 00:58:12,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Try hanging out on the roleplay forums and tell me there aren't more trolls.

845
00:58:13,438 --> 00:58:15,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Now how in the F are you supposed to roleplay with your real name?

846
00:58:16,081 --> 00:58:16,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

847
00:58:17,183 --> 00:58:18,945
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, that's the death knell.

848
00:58:18,965 --> 00:58:19,966
[SPEAKER_03]: That was dumb.

849
00:58:20,006 --> 00:58:21,148
[SPEAKER_03]: That was going to be massive.

850
00:58:21,528 --> 00:58:24,432
[SPEAKER_02]: They already had a replacement site set up for everyone to go to.

851
00:58:24,652 --> 00:58:25,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, look.

852
00:58:26,254 --> 00:58:31,960
[SPEAKER_03]: We could talk about the Blizzard employee who got cyber-stalked when he put his real name out there and they spilled all the data.

853
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Bottom line is they didn't go through with it.

854
00:58:34,182 --> 00:58:34,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

855
00:58:34,943 --> 00:58:37,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes about as much sense as a whole LifeLock dude.

856
00:58:37,445 --> 00:58:39,968
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not going to go back into the pros and cons of the forums.

857
00:58:40,028 --> 00:58:44,692
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is what I really want to make sure people understand because there's a lot of misinformation out there.

858
00:58:45,273 --> 00:58:46,134
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

859
00:59:14,233 --> 00:59:20,757
[SPEAKER_03]: This whole Blizzard already did a dumb thing and they're just making it even dumber is the only thing that got pulled back.

860
00:59:20,977 --> 00:59:26,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything I said in my rant two weeks ago, you know what changed from all that stuff I ranted about two weeks ago?

861
00:59:27,621 --> 00:59:31,083
[SPEAKER_03]: About the whole friends of friends, about the whole your last name is in the game.

862
00:59:31,343 --> 00:59:33,564
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how much of that changed with this announcement?

863
00:59:34,225 --> 00:59:34,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

864
00:59:35,466 --> 00:59:35,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

865
00:59:37,216 --> 00:59:47,762
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that that CEO mentioned was that they're not going to implement something they thought about implementing when almost 50,000 people replied on that thread before it got officially released.

866
00:59:47,942 --> 00:59:58,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I have seen administrator posts on the forums and such saying that they're looking to close some security holes in the Real ID system so you wouldn't be able to see friends of friends and such.

867
00:59:58,948 --> 00:59:59,729
[SPEAKER_02]: They're working on it.

868
01:00:00,209 --> 01:00:11,191
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is testament to the fact that if you complain loud enough, often enough, and in great enough number, you can generally rattle the company into doing what's right.

869
01:00:11,752 --> 01:00:13,612
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet, Bobby Kotick still has a job.

870
01:00:14,192 --> 01:00:19,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Bobby Blackwolf thinks I'm blaming him because he was one of those people that posted about all that.

871
01:00:19,753 --> 01:00:21,294
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Bobby, I'm not picking on you.

872
01:00:21,354 --> 01:00:22,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm picking on...

873
01:00:22,774 --> 01:00:24,675
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

874
01:00:49,235 --> 01:00:51,056
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's some people that don't want to hear all this reality stuff.

875
01:00:51,076 --> 01:00:54,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, that would be awesome for stalking celebrities in the game.

876
01:00:55,759 --> 01:00:56,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they wouldn't post on the forums.

877
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:57,861
[SPEAKER_04]: But here, here's the thing.

878
01:00:58,201 --> 01:00:59,622
[SPEAKER_03]: But aren't their names going to be in the game?

879
01:00:59,722 --> 01:00:59,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you?

880
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:01,423
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's gone.

881
01:01:01,523 --> 01:01:01,923
[SPEAKER_03]: That's gone.

882
01:01:02,604 --> 01:01:03,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing, though.

883
01:01:03,304 --> 01:01:04,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing that's important.

884
01:01:06,107 --> 01:01:06,967
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

885
01:01:32,839 --> 01:01:45,809
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there is a rogue add-on out there that wants to insert, and already there's been these false reports and false photoshops and things of this line of code being in popular mods such as Gearscore and Deadly Boss mods.

886
01:01:45,849 --> 01:01:50,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Luckily those are all bullshit, but what is not bullshit is the fact that the code is out there and it works.

887
01:01:50,632 --> 01:01:51,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, the hole's been closed.

888
01:01:51,913 --> 01:01:52,854
[SPEAKER_03]: It was hot fixed on the 10th.

889
01:01:53,496 --> 01:01:55,458
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

890
01:02:14,495 --> 01:02:22,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, and what's to say there won't be a three-line code or a five-line code that is soon to come out that's also going to exploit this information?

891
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:29,084
[SPEAKER_03]: My point is, Blizzard has been selling this thing as opt-in and opt-in, and a lot of people that are advocating for this as opt-in.

892
01:02:29,405 --> 01:02:35,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this little exploit that happened this week, patched or not, showed that the system is not opt-in.

893
01:02:36,229 --> 01:02:36,549
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

894
01:02:53,567 --> 01:02:56,810
[SPEAKER_03]: You're opting in because they've opted you in to this wonderful feature.

895
01:02:56,850 --> 01:03:00,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now I realize Battle.net wants to get in bed with Blizzard.

896
01:03:01,233 --> 01:03:02,013
[SPEAKER_03]: They are in bed with Blizzard.

897
01:03:02,234 --> 01:03:05,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Battle.net wants to get in bed with Facebook so, so badly.

898
01:03:05,476 --> 01:03:06,157
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the thing.

899
01:03:06,637 --> 01:03:09,599
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what Facebook is getting a lot of shit over right now.

900
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:14,483
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's that movie coming out about Facebook, and they really don't make them look like nice people.

901
01:03:14,523 --> 01:03:15,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen the trailers for the –

902
01:03:16,104 --> 01:03:17,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it looks awesome.

903
01:03:31,172 --> 01:03:36,156
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be another website, and everyone will migrate to that website.

904
01:03:36,196 --> 01:03:41,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me quickly finish my thought here, and that is that it's not an opt-in program, it's an opt-out program.

905
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:47,024
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you are believing that it's opt-in, this whole thing that happened this week should tell you different.

906
01:03:47,524 --> 01:03:49,345
[SPEAKER_03]: and you might be thinking, I don't play WoW.

907
01:03:49,485 --> 01:03:50,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't give a shit.

908
01:03:50,665 --> 01:03:54,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you're going to play StarCraft 2 or Diablo 3, this will apply to you.

909
01:03:54,847 --> 01:03:58,949
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's not forget, how many MMOs have knocked off WoW at this point?

910
01:03:59,269 --> 01:04:03,871
[SPEAKER_03]: How many video games in general have knocked off Diablo and StarCraft and Blizzard at this point?

911
01:04:03,911 --> 01:04:04,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Dangerous precedent.

912
01:04:05,211 --> 01:04:07,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is a highly dangerous precedent.

913
01:04:07,592 --> 01:04:08,953
[SPEAKER_03]: So you may not care now...

914
01:04:09,753 --> 01:04:12,457
[SPEAKER_03]: But ask yourself, if this were your favorite game, would you care?

915
01:04:12,678 --> 01:04:17,926
[SPEAKER_02]: They might change the definition of opt-in to be, you opt-in by playing our game.

916
01:04:19,448 --> 01:04:23,575
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what, I have to say this, that if they did it on Star Trek Online, I would quit.

917
01:04:25,183 --> 01:04:25,483
[SPEAKER_12]: I would.

918
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:27,544
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a dangerous precedent that they're setting.

919
01:04:27,904 --> 01:04:29,444
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's hope they do the right thing.

920
01:04:29,484 --> 01:04:36,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hope they allow you to mask your last name, allow you to have the handle, at least hide that friends of friends stuff.

921
01:04:37,246 --> 01:04:42,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish my real name was on Grand Theft Auto because I'd fucking love everybody to know that I'm kicking their ass.

922
01:04:43,508 --> 01:04:45,628
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I'm ranked 58 now in the world.

923
01:04:45,848 --> 01:04:47,569
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love this comment from Toa Gak in chat.

924
01:04:47,649 --> 01:04:49,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Real ideas is secure as the Wii.

925
01:04:49,649 --> 01:04:49,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

926
01:04:49,989 --> 01:04:51,990
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's your real name out there, folks.

927
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:52,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Your real name.

928
01:04:53,650 --> 01:05:00,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when I signed up for WoW four years ago, I assumed that the name I was giving them was for billing and information purposes.

929
01:05:00,133 --> 01:05:00,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I had no idea.

930
01:05:00,674 --> 01:05:01,894
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what the agreement said.

931
01:05:01,994 --> 01:05:03,955
[SPEAKER_03]: No idea that this was going to be the result of it.

932
01:05:03,995 --> 01:05:04,956
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I can't change my name.

933
01:05:05,716 --> 01:05:09,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have signed up with my internet name and my internet trail Rob Roberts if I knew that in the beginning.

934
01:05:10,058 --> 01:05:15,801
[SPEAKER_12]: This is what actually I'd like to see happen is I'd really like to see, you know, an organized boycott.

935
01:05:17,873 --> 01:05:18,614
[SPEAKER_12]: Hit them where it hurts.

936
01:05:41,417 --> 01:05:44,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't put it past them that they did it on purpose knowing that would happen

937
01:06:04,804 --> 01:06:06,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I love their game.

938
01:06:06,686 --> 01:06:09,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd prefer it to remain a game.

939
01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:11,171
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so hard, Jamie.

940
01:06:11,331 --> 01:06:12,132
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a social network.

941
01:06:12,152 --> 01:06:16,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I really love that game and I have so many friends that I interact with and play it with.

942
01:06:16,897 --> 01:06:17,938
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll still be your friends.

943
01:06:18,138 --> 01:06:21,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but it's just... I can't explain it.

944
01:06:22,459 --> 01:06:23,360
[SPEAKER_12]: I know what you mean.

945
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:25,121
[SPEAKER_12]: Trust me, I played Ragnarok for how long?

946
01:06:25,161 --> 01:06:25,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

947
01:06:25,842 --> 01:06:29,385
[SPEAKER_12]: And I quit Ragnarok when they started doing shit I didn't agree with.

948
01:06:29,445 --> 01:06:35,471
[SPEAKER_12]: And I played in the beta, like the first... Actually, I played part from the alpha.

949
01:06:36,252 --> 01:06:38,134
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's how long I've been with Ragnarok online.

950
01:06:38,154 --> 01:06:40,356
[SPEAKER_12]: And when they started doing crap I didn't like, I quit.

951
01:06:41,176 --> 01:06:42,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not opposed to quitting.

952
01:06:43,076 --> 01:06:44,477
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, ask Alan.

953
01:06:45,017 --> 01:06:47,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I really kind of had a long chat with him about it.

954
01:06:47,417 --> 01:06:49,838
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, I was paid through the 14th.

955
01:06:50,258 --> 01:06:53,458
[SPEAKER_03]: So I said, I'm going to wait and see if Blizzard changes their mind by the 14th.

956
01:06:53,838 --> 01:06:56,079
[SPEAKER_03]: And sure enough, the scale back happened.

957
01:06:56,119 --> 01:06:58,199
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, okay, well, now they're moving in the right direction.

958
01:06:58,259 --> 01:07:01,180
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm kind of like at that point where I'm like, well, let's see what happens.

959
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:03,120
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is an expansion coming out.

960
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:07,181
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they're going to want my $40 for the expansion, I want it to be an expansion I want.

961
01:07:07,381 --> 01:07:16,294
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think that there comes a point and this is something that people in the gaming community need to realize there comes a point when you basically sacrifice your ideals for entertainment

962
01:07:18,497 --> 01:07:23,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Ramakun in chat says Sky, all of this is coming from Activision.

963
01:07:23,419 --> 01:07:25,220
[SPEAKER_03]: They're pushing for this, not Blizzard.

964
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,040
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care where it's coming from.

965
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,401
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks.

966
01:07:29,441 --> 01:07:31,922
[SPEAKER_03]: In the end, I don't really care who the boycott is hurting.

967
01:07:31,982 --> 01:07:35,963
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's not something I believe in, then I'm not opposed to quitting.

968
01:07:36,123 --> 01:07:38,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if that's correct, then it means Blizzard is starting to push back.

969
01:07:41,305 --> 01:07:42,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what I'll tell you will happen.

970
01:07:43,806 --> 01:07:45,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I might stick with WoW for now.

971
01:07:46,636 --> 01:07:51,562
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's two MMOs coming out this fall that I am very interested in.

972
01:07:51,782 --> 01:07:54,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy XIV and DC Universe.

973
01:07:54,466 --> 01:07:56,148
[SPEAKER_12]: You're supposed to play Star Trek Online with me.

974
01:07:56,188 --> 01:07:59,412
[SPEAKER_03]: And at some point I'm supposed to squeeze Star Trek Online in there too.

975
01:07:59,712 --> 01:08:01,234
[SPEAKER_12]: You can quit and play with me.

976
01:08:01,354 --> 01:08:02,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not paying for four MMOs.

977
01:08:03,717 --> 01:08:04,939
[SPEAKER_12]: So quit World of Warcraft and play with me.

978
01:08:06,363 --> 01:08:06,763
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

979
01:08:07,104 --> 01:08:11,007
[SPEAKER_12]: You can play with all of my really cool new friends in my fleet.

980
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:15,310
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, I promised that I would give them a plug, and I'm going to.

981
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:17,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, go ahead.

982
01:08:18,433 --> 01:08:23,277
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to give my... Although they're probably mostly all asleep because they're all in the UK.

983
01:08:23,477 --> 01:08:24,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course they are.

984
01:08:24,578 --> 01:08:25,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course they are.

985
01:08:25,879 --> 01:08:27,601
[SPEAKER_12]: The independent United Fleet.

986
01:08:27,961 --> 01:08:29,342
[SPEAKER_12]: They are super cool people.

987
01:08:30,123 --> 01:08:31,003
[SPEAKER_12]: And, well, there's a couple.

988
01:08:31,224 --> 01:08:34,106
[SPEAKER_12]: There's one from Hawaii and one from New York, I think, so...

989
01:08:36,213 --> 01:08:37,472
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not the only American there!

990
01:08:38,661 --> 01:09:06,754
[SPEAKER_03]: one more thing I want to say on Real ID and boycotting WoW and all that here's another thing to consider is that again this isn't just about Warcraft I am really looking forward to Diablo 3 I really like Diablo 2 and I really really want to play Diablo 3 so that's another reason I kind of want Blizzard to do the right thing here because realize that if I have to quit WoW because of this if Blizzard takes it a step further in the wrong direction and I end up quitting WoW over this I'm going to have to quit Diablo 3 as well

991
01:09:07,094 --> 01:09:10,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, well, it's not the same, but you could always have Torchlight.

992
01:09:11,016 --> 01:09:12,317
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have Torchlight, and it's great.

993
01:09:12,677 --> 01:09:15,138
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, there's the Torchlight MMO to look forward to next year.

994
01:09:15,178 --> 01:09:16,959
[SPEAKER_03]: I suppose there's a... We'll always have Torchlight.

995
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:20,841
[SPEAKER_12]: SSG100Map backs me up that you can play Star Trek Online with me and Travis.

996
01:09:22,142 --> 01:09:22,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

997
01:09:22,662 --> 01:09:27,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Travis will do nothing but dare me to do dumb shit in Star Trek Online, just like he does on Twitter.

998
01:09:27,945 --> 01:09:31,807
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no real way that you can do dumb shit on Star Trek Online.

999
01:09:31,927 --> 01:09:33,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that sounds like a challenge.

1000
01:09:35,354 --> 01:09:39,878
[SPEAKER_12]: Run without armor into a horde of Klingons and watch them kick you in the face.

1001
01:09:39,958 --> 01:09:42,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's not forget my first character.

1002
01:09:42,561 --> 01:09:47,746
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was in the beta, my character's name was Captain Sassy of the USS O'Girl.

1003
01:09:50,734 --> 01:09:52,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Captain America is not named Jack, he's Steve.

1004
01:10:16,954 --> 01:10:17,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on.

1005
01:10:17,535 --> 01:10:23,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to move on to other gaming stories, but real quick, thank you guys who have kind of bared with my hatred of Real ID over the past couple weeks on this show.

1006
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:28,565
[SPEAKER_03]: I know not everybody's into WoW and all that, but remember, I just want to remind you guys, precedent.

1007
01:10:29,186 --> 01:10:32,389
[SPEAKER_03]: This could have a huge effect on online gaming as we know it.

1008
01:10:32,509 --> 01:10:34,931
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, imagine if Xbox Live required it, your real name.

1009
01:10:35,132 --> 01:10:36,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you stick with Xbox Live?

1010
01:10:37,714 --> 01:10:38,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Just throwing it out there, guys.

1011
01:10:38,574 --> 01:10:39,555
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on.

1012
01:10:39,595 --> 01:10:40,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Completely new topic.

1013
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:43,617
[SPEAKER_12]: There's actually something that Bobby just said in chat that I think is amazing.

1014
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:43,937
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

1015
01:10:43,957 --> 01:10:44,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead and read it.

1016
01:10:44,397 --> 01:10:48,679
[SPEAKER_12]: To draw a parallel, he said, first they came for the WoW people, and I said nothing for I don't play WoW.

1017
01:10:48,879 --> 01:10:54,582
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he said something similar on his Twitter this week about the whole thing, and I think that's a great little analogy.

1018
01:10:54,762 --> 01:11:03,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, for anyone who don't know, in the last thing, it's like finally they came for me, and there was no one to say anything for me.

1019
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:05,207
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that...

1020
01:11:06,207 --> 01:11:10,429
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's like you're saying this is going to set a precedent and it's time to stop it in its tracks.

1021
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:13,650
[SPEAKER_12]: And I still say everyone should quit.

1022
01:11:14,050 --> 01:11:16,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Surezo in chatroom says, it's okay, Rob.

1023
01:11:16,971 --> 01:11:18,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranting on WoW is okay with me.

1024
01:11:18,912 --> 01:11:20,212
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's the thing, though, guys.

1025
01:11:20,432 --> 01:11:23,414
[SPEAKER_03]: There were a lot of people on Twitter when I said I was so frustrated with this.

1026
01:11:23,434 --> 01:11:26,435
[SPEAKER_03]: They were like, yay, quit WoW, quit WoW, it's stupid, blah, blah, blah.

1027
01:11:27,315 --> 01:11:28,156
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1028
01:11:44,613 --> 01:11:45,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1029
01:12:06,244 --> 01:12:09,847
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's hard to just say, oh, quit.

1030
01:12:10,767 --> 01:12:13,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you are saying goodbye to all your friends when you do that.

1031
01:12:13,449 --> 01:12:16,131
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also understand it's just a game.

1032
01:12:16,211 --> 01:12:20,194
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the end of the day, if you believe in something that strongly, then you need to walk away.

1033
01:12:20,274 --> 01:12:22,176
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is what I will do if...

1034
01:12:24,017 --> 01:12:24,817
[SPEAKER_03]: and Push Comes to Show.

1035
01:12:24,877 --> 01:12:34,280
[SPEAKER_12]: If this makes you feel better, Rob, I still keep up with at least four of the people from the free server that I played on in Ragnarok Online and back from the old school days.

1036
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,621
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep in mind that I quit, what, six years ago?

1037
01:12:38,901 --> 01:12:41,782
[SPEAKER_12]: I still keep up with at least three people from there.

1038
01:12:42,982 --> 01:12:47,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Luckily, most of the people I play with I already know in real life, but there are a few.

1039
01:12:47,183 --> 01:12:49,004
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple that were listeners of the show.

1040
01:12:49,363 --> 01:12:49,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Segue!

1041
01:12:49,523 --> 01:12:49,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Segue!

1042
01:13:04,858 --> 01:13:06,779
[SPEAKER_03]: We're coming to the PSP, real ID.

1043
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:10,722
[SPEAKER_04]: It affects nobody.

1044
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:14,184
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, apparently this is great.

1045
01:13:14,564 --> 01:13:16,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Great planning on Sony's part.

1046
01:13:17,165 --> 01:13:19,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotta love their forethought in this.

1047
01:13:20,027 --> 01:13:25,232
[SPEAKER_04]: iPad, PSP, and Invisibles may not support the PSP Go in North America.

1048
01:13:27,194 --> 01:13:38,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, these games do require the PlayStation Portable Camera, which would have plugged into the USB port on the top of the 3000, 2000, 1000 models.

1049
01:13:41,827 --> 01:13:49,012
[SPEAKER_04]: You may remember, though, that the PSP Go does not have that port on top of its system.

1050
01:13:49,413 --> 01:13:58,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, they have some sort of an adapter or converter cable that is released in Japan to be able to use that kind of stuff.

1051
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:00,841
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not coming out over here.

1052
01:14:03,003 --> 01:14:03,863
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1053
01:14:05,734 --> 01:14:07,475
[SPEAKER_04]: PSP Go is a big fucking flop.

1054
01:14:29,324 --> 01:14:31,045
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a big fucking flop, and you know why?

1055
01:14:31,065 --> 01:14:32,285
[SPEAKER_03]: But Sony can't say that.

1056
01:14:32,485 --> 01:14:33,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course they can.

1057
01:14:33,426 --> 01:14:34,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony can't say that.

1058
01:14:34,486 --> 01:14:35,766
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know why it's a big fucking flop?

1059
01:14:36,087 --> 01:14:39,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Have they done any more bundles to try to promote the PSP Go?

1060
01:14:39,428 --> 01:14:39,588
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1061
01:14:39,868 --> 01:14:42,969
[SPEAKER_04]: The last bundle that came out was a PSP 3000 with Metal Gear Solid.

1062
01:14:42,989 --> 01:14:47,091
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another bundle coming out with Madden.

1063
01:14:47,951 --> 01:14:51,192
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be another bundle coming out, I think, for Kingdom Hearts.

1064
01:14:51,692 --> 01:14:53,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Notice all those are with PSP 3000s.

1065
01:14:53,993 --> 01:14:56,054
[SPEAKER_04]: They are not with the PSP Go.

1066
01:14:57,941 --> 01:15:26,004
[SPEAKER_04]: so is that sort of Sony's way of declaring it dead without declaring it dead well just like they're still willing to say that the UMD format is awesome for movies that it was a successful format I mean they're just they're never willing to admit defeat despite the fact that defeat might be you know very obvious much like the court case I was in for the last three weeks are these games themselves you think are going to be any good

1067
01:15:28,422 --> 01:15:28,562
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1068
01:15:28,963 --> 01:15:32,608
[SPEAKER_03]: It seemed like for a while there, the PSP had all these pretty cool games coming out on it.

1069
01:15:32,648 --> 01:15:35,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, is it just me or are things slowing down on that front?

1070
01:15:36,846 --> 01:15:40,889
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like everything that's on the PSP right now is just ports of PS3 games.

1071
01:15:41,009 --> 01:15:42,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, you know, okay.

1072
01:15:42,851 --> 01:15:43,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand.

1073
01:15:43,672 --> 01:15:45,293
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to port a lot of stuff to handheld.

1074
01:15:45,754 --> 01:15:46,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes sense.

1075
01:15:46,715 --> 01:15:51,499
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, the PSP hasn't had a lot of original stuff, right?

1076
01:15:51,599 --> 01:15:55,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there was the Final Fantasy fighting game, but that's the last one I can think of.

1077
01:15:56,864 --> 01:15:58,046
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a pretty good, like what?

1078
01:15:58,146 --> 01:15:59,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations, you've won, Jamie.

1079
01:16:00,468 --> 01:16:01,389
[SPEAKER_12]: I hate those things.

1080
01:16:02,662 --> 01:16:03,302
[SPEAKER_04]: But you've won.

1081
01:16:03,742 --> 01:16:06,843
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be congratulated.

1082
01:16:07,743 --> 01:16:08,624
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see here.

1083
01:16:09,004 --> 01:16:12,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's been some good exclusive PSP games.

1084
01:16:12,285 --> 01:16:14,125
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of it's like niche RPG stuff.

1085
01:16:14,725 --> 01:16:20,567
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the occasional first party Sony title, which is like a God of War title or something like that.

1086
01:16:21,307 --> 01:16:24,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Motorstorm, Arctic, whatever the hell they call it.

1087
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:27,850
[SPEAKER_04]: They're okay.

1088
01:16:28,931 --> 01:16:34,397
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, even they're decent, but it's just not like you're not getting really good third-party titles.

1089
01:16:34,437 --> 01:16:39,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Metal Gear Solid is going to be pretty good, but just there's not a lot of them out there.

1090
01:16:40,023 --> 01:16:40,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

1091
01:16:42,469 --> 01:16:43,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1092
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:04,382
[SPEAKER_04]: EyePet, Invisibles, if you really had a PSP Go, I don't think you're going to be too sad about that.

1093
01:17:04,402 --> 01:17:13,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, really, EyePet, you know, an augment of reality game where you raise a little pet, I don't think a lot of people that own the PSP Go give a shit.

1094
01:17:14,145 --> 01:17:22,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Invisibles, you know, a game that's kind of like Monster Rancher, but, you know, you take pictures of stuff and, you know, based on the picture you get these little animals or whatever.

1095
01:17:23,909 --> 01:17:23,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh...

1096
01:17:25,493 --> 01:17:50,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't give a shit about that either that's just like saying oh it's so sad that we didn't have the GPS function for some game like they had one for one of the golf games where you could go and get information about golf courses and stuff like that if you took your PSP with you nowadays if you want that kind of crap you have an iPhone or an iPod or something like that

1097
01:17:50,919 --> 01:17:51,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Any phone that has apps.

1098
01:18:16,039 --> 01:18:21,385
[SPEAKER_03]: This is coming from Ryuji Yamada in a newspaper report in the Wall Street Journal.

1099
01:18:21,666 --> 01:18:24,589
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the president of NTT Dokomo Inc.

1100
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:27,373
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the biggest wireless carrier in Japan.

1101
01:18:27,914 --> 01:18:30,317
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the company that had the cool Gatchaman commercials.

1102
01:18:30,397 --> 01:18:30,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it

1103
01:18:30,697 --> 01:18:31,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Video Game Makers

1104
01:18:56,076 --> 01:19:01,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, I mean, gosh, the 3G in an iPad makes it, what, $120 more expensive?

1105
01:19:02,981 --> 01:19:11,126
[SPEAKER_03]: I think these will be certain versions of these types of hardware, but I don't think you're going to see this in the first phase of the 3DS, but certainly there could be a later phase.

1106
01:19:11,566 --> 01:19:18,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like the DSi came out later on, there'll probably be a 3DSi phone or something like that coming out.

1107
01:19:18,811 --> 01:19:21,813
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, in a way, isn't the iPhone kind of the big competitor right now?

1108
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:23,891
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

1109
01:19:24,712 --> 01:19:28,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it or not, the iPhone and iPad are handheld gaming systems right now.

1110
01:19:31,853 --> 01:19:34,634
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't buy that, though.

1111
01:19:34,734 --> 01:19:40,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I understand if you put out a lot of games on a platform, I guess we can call it a gaming platform.

1112
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:42,816
[SPEAKER_04]: The PC is a gaming platform.

1113
01:19:42,836 --> 01:19:44,557
[SPEAKER_04]: There's tons of games on there.

1114
01:19:45,417 --> 01:19:48,998
[SPEAKER_04]: And just because a lot of people buy them, I mean, I guess it's just...

1115
01:19:51,786 --> 01:19:55,248
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm trying to say is people that buy Apple products are very sheepish.

1116
01:19:56,228 --> 01:19:58,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Um... Bah?

1117
01:19:59,870 --> 01:20:00,110
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1118
01:20:01,511 --> 01:20:09,434
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually sat and compared the stats between that and the BlackBerry and honestly I've used a bunch of different ones and I like my iPhone.

1119
01:20:11,475 --> 01:20:17,538
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, clearly the reason why a lot of people have it is because it's actually a good product.

1120
01:20:17,638 --> 01:20:21,180
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, I do believe in the rule of thumb, wait until the second generation...

1121
01:20:22,665 --> 01:20:25,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, have you seen this YouTube that's been floating around this week?

1122
01:20:25,646 --> 01:20:27,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's really, really funny.

1123
01:20:27,086 --> 01:20:29,787
[SPEAKER_03]: And look, I am an Apple fan too, and I want an iPhone 4.

1124
01:20:30,087 --> 01:20:32,248
[SPEAKER_03]: But this YouTube was so freaking funny.

1125
01:20:33,448 --> 01:20:34,348
[SPEAKER_06]: How may I help you?

1126
01:20:34,749 --> 01:20:35,349
[SPEAKER_06]: iPhone 4.

1127
01:20:36,049 --> 01:20:36,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Where is the iPhone 4?

1128
01:20:37,929 --> 01:20:38,930
[SPEAKER_06]: I need an iPhone 4.

1129
01:20:39,410 --> 01:20:42,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm very sorry, but we are currently sold out.

1130
01:20:43,191 --> 01:20:46,872
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we did finally get some more HTC EVOS in.

1131
01:20:47,212 --> 01:20:47,392
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1132
01:20:48,052 --> 01:20:48,653
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that?

1133
01:20:49,373 --> 01:20:50,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it an iPhone?

1134
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:52,952
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it is that 4G phone on Sprint.

1135
01:20:53,272 --> 01:20:55,273
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's not an iPhone, why would I want it?

1136
01:20:55,593 --> 01:20:58,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's similar to an iPhone, but has a bigger screen.

1137
01:20:59,116 --> 01:20:59,736
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

1138
01:21:00,076 --> 01:21:02,878
[SPEAKER_01]: The internet speeds are around three times faster.

1139
01:21:03,198 --> 01:21:03,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

1140
01:21:04,179 --> 01:21:07,341
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a higher resolution camera on both the front and the back.

1141
01:21:07,681 --> 01:21:08,302
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

1142
01:21:08,682 --> 01:21:12,084
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't require you to be on Wi-Fi to use video chat.

1143
01:21:12,364 --> 01:21:12,985
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

1144
01:21:13,345 --> 01:21:16,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Its battery is replaceable, as is the memory card.

1145
01:21:16,887 --> 01:21:17,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

1146
01:21:17,848 --> 01:21:24,169
[SPEAKER_01]: It is highly customizable, everything from the widgets to the icons, the fonts and even has video wallpaper.

1147
01:21:24,509 --> 01:21:25,129
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

1148
01:21:25,469 --> 01:21:26,850
[SPEAKER_01]: The monthly bill is cheaper.

1149
01:21:27,190 --> 01:21:27,830
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

1150
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:29,310
[SPEAKER_01]: It fucking prints money.

1151
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:30,330
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

1152
01:21:30,690 --> 01:21:35,111
[SPEAKER_01]: It can grant up to three wishes, even if one of those wishes is for an iPhone.

1153
01:21:35,471 --> 01:21:36,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

1154
01:21:36,451 --> 01:21:41,932
[SPEAKER_01]: It has an app that will build you an island, and then it fucking transforms into a jet and flies you there.

1155
01:21:42,312 --> 01:21:42,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

1156
01:21:43,252 --> 01:21:45,273
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's motherfucking indestructible.

1157
01:21:45,633 --> 01:21:46,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care about any of that.

1158
01:21:47,173 --> 01:21:47,973
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, fine.

1159
01:21:48,273 --> 01:21:52,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what the hell entices you about the iPhone 4, if you don't mind me asking?

1160
01:21:53,195 --> 01:21:54,015
[SPEAKER_06]: It is an iPhone.

1161
01:21:54,335 --> 01:21:56,376
[SPEAKER_01]: You do realize that doesn't mean anything.

1162
01:21:56,656 --> 01:21:57,156
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a brand.

1163
01:21:57,176 --> 01:22:01,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's on Tiny Watch Productions on YouTube, and I just thought that stuff was funny.

1164
01:22:02,457 --> 01:22:05,138
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the whole sheep thing you were talking about, right, Loki?

1165
01:22:05,638 --> 01:22:08,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and bad, bad, bad, because I want one.

1166
01:22:11,795 --> 01:22:19,809
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not saying everybody, there's a few people out there that actually do look at the specs and stuff, but a lot of people just go, oh my god, Apple's releasing something, go buy it.

1167
01:22:20,270 --> 01:22:21,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the iPad.

1168
01:22:21,852 --> 01:22:22,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

1169
01:22:22,754 --> 01:22:23,515
[SPEAKER_04]: The iPad.

1170
01:22:23,535 --> 01:22:23,595
[SPEAKER_04]: The

1171
01:22:25,952 --> 01:22:26,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it.

1172
01:22:27,253 --> 01:22:27,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it.

1173
01:22:27,913 --> 01:22:30,454
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, there's some arguments back and forth.

1174
01:22:30,474 --> 01:22:38,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently the guy who made that video actually works for Best Buy, and there was a little, like, I guess he was fired, but then he wasn't, according to a story on Gizmodo.

1175
01:22:38,316 --> 01:22:39,737
[SPEAKER_04]: But he didn't go back, I don't think.

1176
01:22:39,777 --> 01:22:42,218
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he told them to take his job and shove it.

1177
01:22:42,258 --> 01:22:43,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, basically.

1178
01:22:43,598 --> 01:22:44,198
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

1179
01:22:46,779 --> 01:22:50,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that whole text-to-video thing is really easy to do now.

1180
01:22:50,281 --> 01:22:50,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1181
01:22:56,366 --> 01:23:00,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I would take the ferret ten times over that stupid Vuvuzela thing.

1182
01:23:00,468 --> 01:23:03,629
[SPEAKER_03]: If that becomes a new thing on the show, I'm going to kill myself.

1183
01:23:04,709 --> 01:23:04,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1184
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:08,251
[SPEAKER_12]: We found the Tribble.

1185
01:23:08,491 --> 01:23:09,091
[SPEAKER_12]: We found Angus.

1186
01:23:10,188 --> 01:23:11,128
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1187
01:23:30,337 --> 01:23:32,398
[SPEAKER_04]: My phone used to be silver.

1188
01:23:32,578 --> 01:23:35,280
[SPEAKER_04]: It is now gray because all the paint has rubbed off on it.

1189
01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:41,523
[SPEAKER_04]: The rubber that used to be on this phone covering the different speaker ports and whatever has dissolved to nothing.

1190
01:23:42,443 --> 01:23:44,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the backlights are probably burnt out.

1191
01:23:45,065 --> 01:23:47,406
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't get internet at all.

1192
01:23:47,426 --> 01:23:49,767
[SPEAKER_03]: It still has an old logo.

1193
01:23:49,867 --> 01:23:52,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki's phone is so last gen.

1194
01:23:53,129 --> 01:23:54,371
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically what it is.

1195
01:23:54,391 --> 01:23:55,473
[SPEAKER_12]: It's only three gens ago.

1196
01:23:55,693 --> 01:23:57,175
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like more than that.

1197
01:23:57,395 --> 01:23:58,898
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the point, though.

1198
01:23:59,438 --> 01:24:04,125
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why I don't get a new phone and don't upgrade my service and stuff, because it's fucking expensive.

1199
01:24:04,286 --> 01:24:07,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I pay $50 a month for this phone, of which I use...

1200
01:24:08,872 --> 01:24:11,473
[SPEAKER_03]: I pay $80 for mine, granted.

1201
01:24:11,533 --> 01:24:13,414
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't want to know what Dan and I spend.

1202
01:24:13,494 --> 01:24:18,957
[SPEAKER_03]: I pay $80 for mine, granted, but for $30, I mean, I have internet everywhere, Loki.

1203
01:24:19,037 --> 01:24:19,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Internet everywhere.

1204
01:24:20,218 --> 01:24:28,181
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to say this, and the big thing for me is that if I wanted to have a permanent internet tether, all I have to do is jailbreak my iPhone.

1205
01:24:29,102 --> 01:24:31,723
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can go anywhere and use the 3G as my internet.

1206
01:24:32,523 --> 01:24:37,046
[SPEAKER_12]: Or, you know, it has my... Because otherwise, I was actually looking into buying a PDA.

1207
01:24:40,062 --> 01:24:41,443
[SPEAKER_12]: This replaces a PDA for me.

1208
01:24:42,043 --> 01:24:45,584
[SPEAKER_12]: It replaces my phone, my PDA, and I don't have to carry my Game Boy around.

1209
01:24:46,744 --> 01:24:50,465
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use... And my MP3 player.

1210
01:24:50,525 --> 01:24:54,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to tell you, here's a really good reason why you want to have internet on your cell phone.

1211
01:24:54,746 --> 01:24:57,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Because with internet on your cell phone... No camera on this either.

1212
01:24:57,227 --> 01:24:57,987
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but here's the thing.

1213
01:24:58,007 --> 01:25:02,368
[SPEAKER_03]: With internet on your cell phone, you can read TMZ while pooping.

1214
01:25:04,992 --> 01:25:08,334
[SPEAKER_12]: You can sneak into the bathroom at work and play Peggle.

1215
01:25:10,536 --> 01:25:12,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so you know.

1216
01:25:13,658 --> 01:25:18,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of pooping, I just heard a huge gunshot go off in the living room and almost made me poop right here.

1217
01:25:18,822 --> 01:25:19,822
[SPEAKER_02]: He's playing Crackdown 2.

1218
01:25:19,862 --> 01:25:21,464
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Epic Subwoofer, remember?

1219
01:25:24,206 --> 01:25:25,727
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what keeps me from getting an iPhone?

1220
01:25:26,187 --> 01:25:27,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't fucking afford it.

1221
01:25:28,168 --> 01:25:30,830
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1222
01:25:53,516 --> 01:25:54,697
[SPEAKER_12]: How about dating sims, Rob?

1223
01:25:54,717 --> 01:25:57,058
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the best DRM ever.

1224
01:25:59,179 --> 01:26:10,985
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, for people who have pirated versions of Love Plus, well, when they play their pirated version, they find a little surprise when they shut off their game and turn it back on.

1225
01:26:12,937 --> 01:26:19,668
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, basically, instead of having to, you know, bypass this and that and not being able to play it, they're like, sure, go ahead and play the game.

1226
01:26:20,089 --> 01:26:23,074
[SPEAKER_12]: And you get all your happy love points with the girl, and yay.

1227
01:26:23,455 --> 01:26:24,436
[SPEAKER_12]: Then you start the game back up.

1228
01:26:24,496 --> 01:26:25,238
[SPEAKER_12]: She hates you.

1229
01:26:27,270 --> 01:26:28,991
[SPEAKER_12]: You cannot get her to like you again.

1230
01:26:29,051 --> 01:26:35,236
[SPEAKER_12]: You cannot get any of the girls to like you again because they know you're a pirate and girls don't like pirates.

1231
01:26:35,837 --> 01:26:37,678
[SPEAKER_12]: At least not in dating sim land.

1232
01:26:37,838 --> 01:26:39,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Why won't she love me?

1233
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:42,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're a dirty ass thief, that's why.

1234
01:26:44,287 --> 01:26:50,530
[SPEAKER_12]: and, well, to read some of these quotes on here, I was dating her normally, and when I restarted, she was pissed at me.

1235
01:26:50,890 --> 01:26:53,311
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't get her to like me, and she's always annoyed at me.

1236
01:26:53,591 --> 01:26:55,372
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the ultimate anti-piracy measure.

1237
01:26:56,313 --> 01:26:59,134
[SPEAKER_12]: I tried the friend part of Love Plus again to get some scenes I missed.

1238
01:26:59,454 --> 01:26:59,854
[SPEAKER_12]: You're right.

1239
01:27:00,155 --> 01:27:01,475
[SPEAKER_12]: She wouldn't let us become lovers.

1240
01:27:02,135 --> 01:27:04,497
[SPEAKER_12]: After 100 days, she still won't let me become her boyfriend.

1241
01:27:04,917 --> 01:27:07,238
[SPEAKER_12]: She completely ignores me and won't send me any mails.

1242
01:27:07,298 --> 01:27:09,079
[SPEAKER_03]: She would never let me see her tits.

1243
01:27:09,319 --> 01:27:10,880
[SPEAKER_12]: The events aren't happening either.

1244
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:11,600
[SPEAKER_12]: Brutal.

1245
01:27:13,038 --> 01:27:16,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, if the developer hates you, the girls hate you too.

1246
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:17,121
[SPEAKER_02]: What a surprise.

1247
01:27:17,661 --> 01:27:20,283
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's written into the game's copy production.

1248
01:27:20,703 --> 01:27:22,565
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, would you show your boobs to a pirate?

1249
01:27:24,986 --> 01:27:25,447
[SPEAKER_12]: Depends.

1250
01:27:25,667 --> 01:27:27,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you shown your boobs to a pirate?

1251
01:27:29,321 --> 01:27:29,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo-ho.

1252
01:27:29,742 --> 01:27:33,065
[SPEAKER_12]: Depends.

1253
01:27:33,505 --> 01:27:36,188
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep in mind, I've done some interesting things.

1254
01:27:36,288 --> 01:27:37,589
[SPEAKER_12]: Mardi Gras did come from my hometown.

1255
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:38,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know.

1256
01:27:38,610 --> 01:27:40,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, let's not go there.

1257
01:27:41,833 --> 01:27:44,376
[SPEAKER_03]: But this reminds me of the... This shirt would be easy to do.

1258
01:27:45,717 --> 01:27:46,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, no, no, no.

1259
01:27:46,578 --> 01:27:48,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you have to say that while we're trying to do a show?

1260
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:53,885
[SPEAKER_12]: I was cleaning out my closet and I found this shirt and it's too big for me because it was from when I was 20 pounds heavier.

1261
01:27:54,958 --> 01:27:55,158
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

1262
01:28:13,731 --> 01:28:15,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I see that, I'm like, yeah, I have a friend that would do that.

1263
01:28:16,933 --> 01:28:17,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Jamie, somebody else.

1264
01:28:18,213 --> 01:28:19,714
[SPEAKER_12]: I would never do that at Disneyland, Rob.

1265
01:28:19,874 --> 01:28:22,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at Disneyland, but at Mardi Gras.

1266
01:28:22,636 --> 01:28:25,258
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, no, no, because Mardi Gras does not have boob flashing.

1267
01:28:25,578 --> 01:28:28,199
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it does, but it's sort of like, what the crap are you doing?

1268
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:30,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm showing my boobs.

1269
01:28:31,862 --> 01:28:33,303
[SPEAKER_12]: Seriously, you do it at Mardi Gras.

1270
01:28:33,543 --> 01:28:35,324
[SPEAKER_12]: You're being stupid.

1271
01:28:35,964 --> 01:28:37,145
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't care about your tits.

1272
01:28:37,905 --> 01:28:38,626
[SPEAKER_12]: We want moon pies.

1273
01:28:39,696 --> 01:28:43,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm remembering the Gabriel Iglesias skit where they flashed.

1274
01:28:43,719 --> 01:28:46,780
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, and they thought that it were a couple women because they're man boobs.

1275
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:47,681
[SPEAKER_02]: They look like sexy bitches.

1276
01:28:48,742 --> 01:28:49,602
[SPEAKER_12]: Because they're man boobs.

1277
01:28:49,762 --> 01:28:57,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say real quick, it reminded me that whole little story of, I know we've covered it on the show before, the Earthbound copy protection or whatever it was.

1278
01:28:57,827 --> 01:29:00,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the game got harder if you pirated it.

1279
01:29:00,309 --> 01:29:03,571
[SPEAKER_03]: There would be like, yeah, four times as many monsters and it deletes itself.

1280
01:29:03,631 --> 01:29:05,312
[SPEAKER_02]: In the last battle, it flashed.

1281
01:29:05,512 --> 01:29:11,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Freezes, you truly cannot comprehend the true form of the attack because it deletes your fucking save file.

1282
01:29:12,058 --> 01:29:12,719
[SPEAKER_02]: That's brutal.

1283
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:23,769
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I mean, if you're gonna pirate a game... However, I would love to see the people who got that far with it in... You know, I wanna see a ROM hack where you can play it that difficult and beat the game.

1284
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:24,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's been done.

1285
01:29:25,070 --> 01:29:25,270
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1286
01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:26,191
[SPEAKER_12]: People just...

1287
01:29:27,168 --> 01:29:28,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Get around this copy protection.

1288
01:29:28,631 --> 01:29:29,612
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't take long.

1289
01:29:29,913 --> 01:29:33,619
[SPEAKER_12]: But no, but I think it's fun that that's what they do because they recognize it's going to happen.

1290
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:37,366
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's just make their lives a little bit of hell until they figure it out.

1291
01:29:37,846 --> 01:29:39,629
[SPEAKER_12]: By then, we'll hit our sales.

1292
01:29:40,371 --> 01:29:40,831
[SPEAKER_12]: We're done.

1293
01:29:41,496 --> 01:30:10,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we also had a story not too long ago, probably about four or five months ago, about the whole Batman Arkham Asylum had been pirated, and apparently in the pirated version of the game, one of the, and I'm trying to go from memory here, so forgive me if I screw this up, one of the jump types was missing, or there was a puzzle that couldn't be finished, and a guy went on the forums to complain about it, and the creators of the game, or the forum moderators basically said, yeah, you're playing a pirated version of the game, because we kind of did that on purpose in the pirated version of the game,

1294
01:30:11,064 --> 01:30:12,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1295
01:30:30,814 --> 01:30:56,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, that was about as stupid as the guy who complained on the Steam forums that he got banned for what was told to him was an undetectable hack and I shouldn't be banned because it said the hack was undetectable you guys shouldn't have been able to detect it why did I get banned, reverse the ban lol, bye, have a nice day oh, you should probably get your money back for buying that hack

1296
01:30:56,809 --> 01:30:58,210
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just called an idiot.

1297
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:00,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Somewhere in a lunchroom, nerds are laughing.

1298
01:31:00,491 --> 01:31:02,233
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just an idiot.

1299
01:31:02,453 --> 01:31:07,036
[SPEAKER_12]: This is one thing I actually really do dig about The Sims.

1300
01:31:07,716 --> 01:31:15,622
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not playing a... All my copies are legit and registered, but I download hacks like crazy for them.

1301
01:31:16,922 --> 01:31:26,449
[SPEAKER_12]: The EA actually looks at some of the stuff that people make modded stuff for and actually incorporate those themes into their future releases for their store.

1302
01:31:27,770 --> 01:31:28,610
[SPEAKER_12]: They know what happens.

1303
01:31:28,971 --> 01:31:34,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the moral of the story here is buy your games legitimately and maybe you can see some tits.

1304
01:31:35,815 --> 01:31:40,739
[SPEAKER_12]: I think if you pay for your game legitimately and then mod it.

1305
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,060
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1306
01:31:43,601 --> 01:31:48,944
[SPEAKER_12]: The only way that you can get the patches that EA puts out is to basically reinstall everything, which I've done.

1307
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:52,587
[SPEAKER_12]: But I only do that when I buy new versions.

1308
01:31:53,300 --> 01:32:00,624
[SPEAKER_12]: But still, I like it better when a company understands that it's going to happen, and then they fuck with you.

1309
01:32:00,744 --> 01:32:01,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I agree.

1310
01:32:01,364 --> 01:32:03,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you buy it, you should be able to hack the shit out of it.

1311
01:32:03,525 --> 01:32:06,547
[SPEAKER_03]: It's your copy of the game, and if you want to tear it apart, go for it.

1312
01:32:07,367 --> 01:32:14,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you should hack it to re-upload it to be free and all that, but whatever.

1313
01:32:14,966 --> 01:32:15,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on.

1314
01:32:15,867 --> 01:32:17,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about release dates.

1315
01:32:17,428 --> 01:32:21,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of buying your games legitimately, there's a whole lot of games you can buy legitimately this week.

1316
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:22,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, start us off with the U.S.

1317
01:32:23,231 --> 01:32:26,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Including Chuck E. Cheese's Party Games for the Nintendo DS.

1318
01:32:27,234 --> 01:32:29,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there's a franchise most people forgot about.

1319
01:32:30,556 --> 01:32:35,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Little League World Series Baseball 2010 coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.

1320
01:32:38,421 --> 01:32:44,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Then, of course, the Wii version, which includes, I believe, the last year version and this year.

1321
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:47,107
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering why they called that Double Play.

1322
01:32:48,567 --> 01:32:49,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1323
01:32:54,230 --> 01:32:57,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's coming out on Wii and DS, I believe.

1324
01:32:58,571 --> 01:33:04,054
[SPEAKER_04]: NCAA Football 2011 on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.

1325
01:33:05,534 --> 01:33:10,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Pausing Claws Regal Resort, the game with the most retarded cover ever.

1326
01:33:11,257 --> 01:33:16,499
[SPEAKER_04]: It has cats and dogs dressed up like their royalty.

1327
01:33:16,959 --> 01:33:20,961
[SPEAKER_04]: A cat with a tiara, a dog with a crown, and a bunny dressed up like a jester.

1328
01:33:21,161 --> 01:33:21,441
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1329
01:33:23,018 --> 01:33:27,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Cat's and Dogs Revenge of Kitty Galore Disciples 3 Resistance PC

1330
01:33:43,732 --> 01:33:45,554
[SPEAKER_04]: and then some more junk.

1331
01:33:46,674 --> 01:33:49,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Hidden Objects Mystery Stories.

1332
01:33:49,716 --> 01:33:54,920
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a hidden objects game, obviously, and that'll be out on the Nintendo DS.

1333
01:33:56,341 --> 01:33:56,981
[SPEAKER_04]: That is it.

1334
01:33:57,181 --> 01:33:59,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, oh, wait, no, I'm sorry.

1335
01:33:59,843 --> 01:34:01,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Planet Pet Vet Collection.

1336
01:34:01,904 --> 01:34:04,546
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple Pet Vet games that have already been released.

1337
01:34:04,706 --> 01:34:05,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and Sorcerer's Apprentice.

1338
01:34:08,014 --> 01:34:09,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, movie tie-ins.

1339
01:34:09,215 --> 01:34:11,075
[SPEAKER_02]: The movie doesn't look horrible.

1340
01:34:11,095 --> 01:34:13,356
[SPEAKER_02]: It has Nicolas Cage, therefore I'm not going to see it.

1341
01:34:13,576 --> 01:34:15,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it has Nicolas Cage as Nicolas Cage.

1342
01:34:18,318 --> 01:34:24,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Salacious Pop in our chatroom says, Oh, so cats can be CEOs and presidents, but bunnies can't be little kings and princesses.

1343
01:34:24,861 --> 01:34:25,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1344
01:34:26,502 --> 01:34:27,122
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different.

1345
01:34:28,443 --> 01:34:29,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Why you got to hate on the bunnies, man?

1346
01:34:30,884 --> 01:34:31,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I can't.

1347
01:34:31,877 --> 01:34:32,137
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1348
01:34:32,678 --> 01:34:35,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go over to Japanese release dates and see what's coming out around the world.

1349
01:34:36,462 --> 01:34:37,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox 360 in Japan.

1350
01:34:37,883 --> 01:34:38,884
[SPEAKER_03]: PGA Woods.

1351
01:34:39,285 --> 01:34:39,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1352
01:34:39,785 --> 01:34:40,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiger Woods.

1353
01:34:40,626 --> 01:34:41,747
[SPEAKER_03]: PGA.

1354
01:34:41,767 --> 01:34:42,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much the same thing.

1355
01:34:42,908 --> 01:34:44,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11.

1356
01:34:45,651 --> 01:34:49,575
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one that South Park would have you believe has the whole fighting simulation in it.

1357
01:34:49,615 --> 01:34:50,416
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really should have.

1358
01:34:50,576 --> 01:34:53,279
[SPEAKER_03]: It really would have made the game so much more interesting.

1359
01:34:53,859 --> 01:34:56,843
[SPEAKER_03]: On the PlayStation 3, same thing, but there's a couple other games too.

1360
01:34:57,243 --> 01:34:59,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Naruto, Narutimate Storm gets a price reduction.

1361
01:35:00,387 --> 01:35:05,673
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as new games go, there's one coming out from Konami called GQ Powerful Pro Yaku 2010.

1362
01:35:05,793 --> 01:35:06,374
[SPEAKER_03]: This is baseball.

1363
01:35:06,474 --> 01:35:06,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1364
01:35:09,637 --> 01:35:11,238
[SPEAKER_12]: Dragon Quest Monsters Battle Road Victory Game

1365
01:35:34,255 --> 01:35:36,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Fire Emblem Shin Monsu no Nazo Hikari Tutakage no Yu

1366
01:35:58,110 --> 01:35:59,770
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's coming out a little early in Japan.

1367
01:36:00,210 --> 01:36:01,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Love Plus gets a price reduction.

1368
01:36:02,591 --> 01:36:04,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Keshikakukon comes out as well.

1369
01:36:05,192 --> 01:36:07,232
[SPEAKER_03]: And Metal Fight Beyblade.

1370
01:36:07,472 --> 01:36:11,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Bakugami Shushono Shurai comes out from Hudson.

1371
01:36:12,213 --> 01:36:14,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if that's a series we know here.

1372
01:36:16,374 --> 01:36:17,914
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an action-based game.

1373
01:36:17,934 --> 01:36:20,255
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it comes with a special little controller or something.

1374
01:36:20,315 --> 01:36:21,935
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a thicker packaging.

1375
01:36:22,595 --> 01:36:24,236
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's like one of those... What is it?

1376
01:36:24,456 --> 01:36:24,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Beyblade?

1377
01:36:25,336 --> 01:36:25,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1378
01:36:25,616 --> 01:36:25,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1379
01:36:26,016 --> 01:36:27,977
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a series that's been out over here.

1380
01:36:28,437 --> 01:36:30,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Beyblade is... Spinning Tops.

1381
01:36:31,499 --> 01:36:32,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's what those are.

1382
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:33,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that one game?

1383
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:41,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it wasn't Tops, but it was... Where was the game that you were shooting silver... Crossfire.

1384
01:36:41,164 --> 01:36:41,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's Crossfire.

1385
01:36:41,864 --> 01:36:43,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Crossfire!

1386
01:36:44,326 --> 01:36:46,487
[SPEAKER_04]: With the really useless pieces that would spin around.

1387
01:36:46,883 --> 01:37:12,758
[SPEAKER_03]: and lastly on the PSP the Castlevania Dracula X Chronicles gets a price reduction but as far as new games go there's Last Ranker comes out Papa Music Portable gets a price reduction Naruto Shippuden Kizuna Drive comes out and Busou Shinki Battle Masters comes out as well from Konami which looks like um is that a shmup because it kind of looks like it from the cover it's one of those robo anime babes it looks like she turns into a plane

1388
01:37:14,537 --> 01:37:16,158
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1389
01:37:44,947 --> 01:37:46,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like that, too.

1390
01:37:48,209 --> 01:37:50,690
[SPEAKER_12]: Or at least a way that you can de-tag it yourself.

1391
01:37:53,012 --> 01:37:53,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you can.

1392
01:37:54,093 --> 01:37:54,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1393
01:37:54,653 --> 01:37:54,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1394
01:37:54,833 --> 01:37:55,914
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't seen it yet.

1395
01:37:56,574 --> 01:37:59,176
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, so, games.

1396
01:37:59,876 --> 01:38:05,459
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, and this is actually, you know, yesterday, but it's worth saying the Silver Lining came out, woohoo.

1397
01:38:05,579 --> 01:38:07,260
[SPEAKER_12]: On the 13th, Deathspank.

1398
01:38:08,461 --> 01:38:09,121
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't get it.

1399
01:38:09,762 --> 01:38:09,922
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1400
01:38:09,942 --> 01:38:11,663
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a game on Xbox Live Arcade.

1401
01:38:12,117 --> 01:38:13,359
[SPEAKER_12]: and PlayStation 3.

1402
01:38:16,144 --> 01:38:23,317
[SPEAKER_12]: Destination Arcade and then the 16th Puzzle Quest 2 and Toy Story 3, the video game, which actually I was looking at the preview for that.

1403
01:38:23,337 --> 01:38:24,018
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks kind of fine.

1404
01:38:25,066 --> 01:38:25,546
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1405
01:38:45,970 --> 01:38:52,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there has been a trial date, or at least a couple trial dates, set for the Infinity Ward suit.

1406
01:38:52,575 --> 01:39:04,583
[SPEAKER_04]: You may remember, of course, the founders of Infinity Ward were forcefully departed from their company and are now suing for royalties that were unpaid.

1407
01:39:05,523 --> 01:39:07,484
[SPEAKER_04]: The lawsuit will take place on May 23, 2011.

1408
01:39:11,125 --> 01:39:21,489
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also supposed to be another hearing on August 5 to determine whether a third lawsuit filed by employees of Infinity Ward against Activision should be considered with the other two lawsuits.

1409
01:39:23,409 --> 01:39:36,252
[SPEAKER_04]: On, I guess, March 1st, Activision dismissed both Wes and Zampella, the creators of the Call of Duty series, for alleging insubordination and breach of contract by the two.

1410
01:39:36,932 --> 01:39:47,934
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, they're suing seeking $36 million in unpaid royalties and alleging Activision rigged an investigation into their conduct to find a pretext to fire them.

1411
01:39:48,694 --> 01:40:01,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Activision filed a countersuit against the two and of course since then they've created the Respawn Entertainment Studio and there's I believe at least 40 of the employees that have kind of moved over to their new studio as well

1412
01:40:03,499 --> 01:40:05,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I know what Activision could do about it.

1413
01:40:06,702 --> 01:40:09,104
[SPEAKER_02]: They could hire that lawyer you had to deal with.

1414
01:40:09,764 --> 01:40:10,205
[SPEAKER_14]: God.

1415
01:40:10,625 --> 01:40:12,867
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's the case, dude, I'm serious.

1416
01:40:12,987 --> 01:40:21,234
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's the case, that trial will take about three years to complete because that guy is slow and confusing and will not help them out in one bit.

1417
01:40:21,754 --> 01:40:24,576
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure that they can afford a better lawyer than that because...

1418
01:40:26,898 --> 01:40:28,580
[SPEAKER_04]: The defense for us, the jury hibernates.

1419
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:29,561
[SPEAKER_04]: He was terrible.

1420
01:40:44,534 --> 01:40:46,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't we all just get along?

1421
01:40:46,595 --> 01:40:47,055
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

1422
01:40:47,375 --> 01:40:55,898
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I could have recorded that trial just so people can understand the kind of pain and suffering I, you know, was affected by.

1423
01:40:57,158 --> 01:41:00,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I should sue her for the pain and suffering of that trial.

1424
01:41:00,939 --> 01:41:03,720
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was seriously such a waste of time.

1425
01:41:04,631 --> 01:41:09,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, I'm sure there's going to be lots of... I can't believe it's actually going to trial.

1426
01:41:09,156 --> 01:41:10,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of this stuff usually gets settled.

1427
01:41:11,499 --> 01:41:12,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it's on Court TV.

1428
01:41:13,261 --> 01:41:13,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe E!

1429
01:41:13,901 --> 01:41:15,063
[SPEAKER_03]: will do some reenactments.

1430
01:41:15,183 --> 01:41:17,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember during the Michael Jackson trial when he did the reenactments?

1431
01:41:17,485 --> 01:41:18,446
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the best stuff ever.

1432
01:41:18,707 --> 01:41:19,948
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about gaming companies.

1433
01:41:19,988 --> 01:41:20,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody gives a shit.

1434
01:41:20,869 --> 01:41:21,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess that's true.

1435
01:41:22,010 --> 01:41:22,491
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know...

1436
01:41:26,624 --> 01:41:47,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's move on and talk about this interesting little story about Roger Ebert, which I find kind of interesting because, you know, he was kind of, a few years ago, no, actually it wasn't a few years ago, probably about a year ago, he made this post about video games are not art and can never be art.

1437
01:41:48,189 --> 01:41:50,169
[SPEAKER_03]: He's basically saying, you know, video games are...

1438
01:41:50,749 --> 01:41:51,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Not art!

1439
01:41:51,529 --> 01:41:55,731
[SPEAKER_03]: And he took a lot of crap from people that were like, you know, well, what about Flower?

1440
01:41:55,811 --> 01:41:57,412
[SPEAKER_03]: What about Shadow of the Colossus?

1441
01:41:57,472 --> 01:42:01,954
[SPEAKER_03]: What about, you know, all these other great games that, you know, you're not really giving a fair shot to?

1442
01:42:03,075 --> 01:42:07,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Roger Ebert actually came out, and this is actually kind of in the week we were gone, but it was worth mentioning here.

1443
01:42:08,377 --> 01:42:11,400
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, I was a fool for mentioning video games in the first place.

1444
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:14,482
[SPEAKER_03]: I would never express an opinion on a movie I hadn't seen.

1445
01:42:14,842 --> 01:42:24,450
[SPEAKER_03]: So he did make kind of like a, if you will, like a retraction post, but when I read it, I didn't really see it as a retraction post, more or less as like an olive branch type of post.

1446
01:42:25,291 --> 01:42:25,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh...

1447
01:42:41,886 --> 01:43:04,615
[SPEAKER_02]: To supply him with a system and games that they consider to be artful And he still refuses to play them He just isn't going to make a statement about things he doesn't want to experience Yeah, so one thing I think you should kind of make sure you pull away from this He didn't come out and say, okay, they're art He's just saying, you know what, I shouldn't have said anything

1448
01:43:05,003 --> 01:43:05,503
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my bad.

1449
01:43:05,603 --> 01:43:07,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Passive-aggressive bullshit.

1450
01:43:07,345 --> 01:43:09,466
[SPEAKER_12]: If you can't say something nice, don't say anything.

1451
01:43:11,687 --> 01:43:14,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's very interesting that he kind of won't play the games.

1452
01:43:14,289 --> 01:43:17,852
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, at the same time, no one has to do anything they don't want to do.

1453
01:43:18,612 --> 01:43:19,793
[SPEAKER_03]: No one has to do anything.

1454
01:43:20,153 --> 01:43:21,294
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there you go.

1455
01:43:22,214 --> 01:43:25,417
[SPEAKER_03]: He's basically come out and said, I'm not going to do it, so you know what?

1456
01:43:25,597 --> 01:43:26,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to comment on it.

1457
01:43:27,018 --> 01:43:28,859
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was bad to comment on it in the first place.

1458
01:43:29,815 --> 01:43:33,678
[SPEAKER_03]: And so most people are like, okay, you know, I never hated the guy for what he said.

1459
01:43:33,718 --> 01:43:35,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, hate would always be a strong word anyway.

1460
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:39,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I've rather thought his opinions on movies were very interesting and so forth.

1461
01:43:39,503 --> 01:43:45,348
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I think, yeah, you probably shouldn't make such a bold statement about something you really haven't... I mean, especially...

1462
01:43:46,744 --> 01:43:52,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Games like, you know, The Flowers and The Shadow Colossus and Final Fantasy is a more artful type of games.

1463
01:43:52,306 --> 01:43:55,387
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can't just associate video games with Mortal Kombat.

1464
01:43:55,427 --> 01:44:00,068
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be like just associating movies with Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus.

1465
01:44:00,808 --> 01:44:02,189
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet Ebert wouldn't appreciate that.

1466
01:44:04,660 --> 01:44:20,420
[SPEAKER_02]: it still bugs me a little bit that he's choosing to maintain his level of ignorance rather than accept some enlightenment that's being offered him that's what still bugs me he's refusing to be educated

1467
01:44:21,317 --> 01:44:22,817
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's a lot of people, though.

1468
01:44:22,957 --> 01:44:25,058
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a big failing of humanity.

1469
01:44:25,078 --> 01:44:26,898
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what bugs me about a lot of people.

1470
01:44:26,918 --> 01:44:29,999
[SPEAKER_03]: To be fair, the guy's got a lot of other stuff to worry about.

1471
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:33,780
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no way to be fair about it.

1472
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:41,482
[SPEAKER_12]: Ignorance, especially self-imposed ignorance, is, to me, unforgivable.

1473
01:44:41,502 --> 01:44:44,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at least he came out and said, I was ignorant and I shouldn't have said anything.

1474
01:44:44,243 --> 01:44:45,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe he didn't say that.

1475
01:44:45,263 --> 01:44:46,243
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

1476
01:44:46,263 --> 01:44:47,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to choose to remain ignorant.

1477
01:44:47,543 --> 01:44:48,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

1478
01:44:48,664 --> 01:44:49,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good day.

1479
01:44:49,984 --> 01:44:50,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

1480
01:44:52,080 --> 01:45:14,999
[SPEAKER_03]: alright to each their own that's it for the news but we can't end this segment just yet we've got to get to the classic video game of the week that's right here on the show we always take a few minutes to say hey why are you not admiring these games from the past you should take a moment to respect your elders and the elder games that came before you

1481
01:45:15,373 --> 01:45:16,594
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super, super quiet, you guys.

1482
01:45:16,674 --> 01:45:17,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's Dragon Slayer.

1483
01:45:17,955 --> 01:45:18,916
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1484
01:45:42,012 --> 01:45:43,876
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you want to get on to the other stuff.

1485
01:45:43,896 --> 01:45:46,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if this one plays a little bit louder.

1486
01:45:46,402 --> 01:45:48,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I feel like I have to move right really quickly.

1487
01:45:48,867 --> 01:45:50,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this one plays a little louder for me.

1488
01:45:50,612 --> 01:45:53,974
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just... That's a complete, perfect playthrough.

1489
01:45:55,395 --> 01:45:55,995
[SPEAKER_12]: In HD.

1490
01:45:57,016 --> 01:46:13,146
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, the game is Dragon's Lair, which I have a bajillion copies of, including the HD copy, and I have it on Sega CD, and... But this game was out on Laserdisc, animated by Don Bluth.

1491
01:46:14,306 --> 01:46:14,507
[SPEAKER_12]: And...

1492
01:46:17,348 --> 01:46:28,099
[SPEAKER_12]: You basically, as each little section play, you'd have to tap the right direction or the right button and it would bring it up as a little flash on the screen.

1493
01:46:29,730 --> 01:46:34,493
[SPEAKER_12]: So you'd have to move in the correct direction based on what it gave you.

1494
01:46:35,293 --> 01:46:36,734
[SPEAKER_12]: And you'd have to be pretty fast.

1495
01:46:36,774 --> 01:46:45,219
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, right at the beginning... I mean, I can't tell you how many times I fell through the damn bridge right when you're walking into the lair.

1496
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:48,881
[SPEAKER_12]: It's also out on the iPhone, too, just to say so.

1497
01:46:51,363 --> 01:46:56,786
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, about the game, you play as Dirk the Daring to rescue Princess Daphne from the evil dragon Sludge.

1498
01:46:57,874 --> 01:46:59,415
[SPEAKER_12]: and you go through it.

1499
01:47:00,375 --> 01:47:01,976
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really straightforward.

1500
01:47:02,596 --> 01:47:08,199
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, this was one of the first arcade games that cost 50 cents to play.

1501
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:12,641
[SPEAKER_12]: And usually most of the other games were a quarter of play.

1502
01:47:15,703 --> 01:47:20,325
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, the game was inspired by the old-text game, Adventure.

1503
01:47:21,225 --> 01:47:23,887
[SPEAKER_12]: And so this is called a graphic adventure.

1504
01:47:25,348 --> 01:47:45,969
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, when, uh, the game came out, it was basically a big sensation, again, not just because of, uh, the fact that it was more expensive, um, but that, uh, it made games, the game itself shut down quite a bit because it was running on a later disc.

1505
01:47:47,122 --> 01:47:50,504
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they basically were overused and really broke down.

1506
01:47:50,524 --> 01:47:54,546
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's actually one of the, you know, probably the most popular game of its type.

1507
01:47:54,666 --> 01:48:02,730
[SPEAKER_12]: Other ones that came out in the series, there was Space Ace and Dragon's Lair 2.

1508
01:48:03,430 --> 01:48:06,231
[SPEAKER_12]: And even, there were a number of other ones that were like that.

1509
01:48:06,631 --> 01:48:13,875
[SPEAKER_12]: They even converted the Lupin movie, the Castle of Cagliostro, into one called Cliffjumper.

1510
01:48:15,356 --> 01:48:16,677
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it was the same company.

1511
01:48:23,656 --> 01:48:24,617
[SPEAKER_12]: I love Space Ace.

1512
01:48:25,537 --> 01:48:31,260
[SPEAKER_12]: There's also Dragon's Lair 3D Return to the Lair, which is a 3D reinterpretation of the game.

1513
01:48:32,781 --> 01:48:40,105
[SPEAKER_12]: They actually had a Dragon's Lair movie scripted and ready to go into production.

1514
01:48:42,447 --> 01:48:48,910
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now, though, and they are doing this completely old-school 2D animation, but it's held up in development right now.

1515
01:48:49,491 --> 01:48:51,092
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a Blu-ray version of Dragon's Lair...

1516
01:48:53,713 --> 01:49:00,280
[SPEAKER_12]: and they basically had to completely go through and remaster everything, clean the cells themselves.

1517
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:06,787
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember when they did the Macross thing where they actually extended the frames out to wider screens?

1518
01:49:06,967 --> 01:49:07,748
[SPEAKER_12]: They're doing the same thing.

1519
01:49:10,030 --> 01:49:16,677
[SPEAKER_02]: This though is not to be confused with the utterly horrible NES adaptation of Dragon's Lair.

1520
01:49:18,577 --> 01:49:20,098
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the good stuff right here.

1521
01:49:20,218 --> 01:49:29,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to do an aside when Jamie's done because there was a home version I played a lot more of than the arcade game growing up, but I'll get into that in a minute.

1522
01:49:29,504 --> 01:49:34,167
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there's also, you probably have heard Princess Daphne in the background.

1523
01:49:35,348 --> 01:49:36,909
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't really look very princess-like.

1524
01:49:36,969 --> 01:49:38,570
[SPEAKER_12]: She actually is just kind of ditzy and squeaky.

1525
01:49:38,590 --> 01:49:39,391
[SPEAKER_11]: She looks like a hoe.

1526
01:49:39,631 --> 01:49:40,292
[SPEAKER_12]: She looks like a whoo.

1527
01:49:41,372 --> 01:49:43,113
[SPEAKER_12]: A hoover, to quote my mother.

1528
01:49:44,454 --> 01:49:55,240
[SPEAKER_12]: But for all the other versions that came, there was... There was actually Escape from Sinja's Castle, which was a non-linear version of it.

1529
01:49:56,261 --> 01:49:57,682
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a puzzle one...

1530
01:50:00,024 --> 01:50:01,685
[SPEAKER_12]: That came out on the old 8-bit systems.

1531
01:50:02,325 --> 01:50:07,288
[SPEAKER_12]: There is the NES one, the Super NES one called Dragon's Lair, which was a platformer version.

1532
01:50:07,388 --> 01:50:09,189
[SPEAKER_12]: Also Space Ace had a platformer version.

1533
01:50:10,129 --> 01:50:14,592
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a Game Boy one called Dragon's Lair The Legend, which really has nothing to do with it.

1534
01:50:17,353 --> 01:50:20,255
[SPEAKER_12]: It's actually a port of an old ZX Spectrum game called Roller Coaster.

1535
01:50:21,495 --> 01:50:26,657
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, the Game Boy Color version is actually pretty much like the original.

1536
01:50:28,018 --> 01:50:47,486
[SPEAKER_12]: There was Dragon's Lair Deluxe Pack, there was an Apple version, the Sega CD version, talking about the old Mac 1 from 1994, and then the emulator Daphne, where you have to have the original Laserdisc and the ROM file to be able to play that, or they have other versions that use MPEG-2 video streams.

1537
01:50:48,386 --> 01:50:52,431
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yeah, there are a lot of versions out, just looking over the list.

1538
01:50:53,112 --> 01:50:58,539
[SPEAKER_12]: Ever since 1983, we've had, I'm just going to run off the list of different systems it's been on.

1539
01:50:59,040 --> 01:50:59,300
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay?

1540
01:50:59,420 --> 01:50:59,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1541
01:51:00,816 --> 01:51:27,485
[SPEAKER_12]: We've had the Arcade, Coleco Atom, Armstead, CPC, Spectrum, Commodore 64, Atari ST, the Amiga, PC, NES, Game Boy, Mac Plus, Atari ST, more Mac, Sega CD, 3DO, Mega CD, or Sega CD, CDI, Atari Jaguar, Windows 95, let's see...

1542
01:51:30,006 --> 01:51:52,251
[SPEAKER_12]: Game Boy Color, PS2, Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation 2, mobile phone, Blu-ray player, PS3, HD DVD players, iPhone, DSi for DSiWare, DS, PSP, and the Wii as a disc.

1543
01:51:53,591 --> 01:51:54,332
[SPEAKER_12]: So, wow.

1544
01:51:55,152 --> 01:52:02,276
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, the character Dirk was battling mid-life crisis in an episode of Robot Chicken.

1545
01:52:04,277 --> 01:52:04,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1546
01:52:05,537 --> 01:52:07,058
[SPEAKER_12]: And part of the game was parodied in Family Guy.

1547
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:11,540
[SPEAKER_03]: There really wasn't a lot like it.

1548
01:52:11,620 --> 01:52:15,122
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, there were those other games you mentioned, but I can't think of a lot of games that were really like this.

1549
01:52:15,442 --> 01:52:15,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever.

1550
01:52:16,123 --> 01:52:20,645
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ever thought that the concept of the QuickTime event was new... No.

1551
01:52:20,665 --> 01:52:20,705
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1552
01:52:21,090 --> 01:52:23,613
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Dragon's Lair did it way before.

1553
01:52:25,114 --> 01:52:28,258
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was even quicker.

1554
01:52:28,698 --> 01:52:29,479
[SPEAKER_12]: We're at the end of the game.

1555
01:52:29,819 --> 01:52:32,622
[SPEAKER_03]: If DarkSakura's done with her piece, I want to do a quick aside if I could.

1556
01:52:32,642 --> 01:52:33,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Please do.

1557
01:52:33,223 --> 01:52:40,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I played, growing up, an awful lot the Commodore 64 versions of the game, which were different.

1558
01:52:40,891 --> 01:52:42,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if we can get some of the music here.

1559
01:52:43,013 --> 01:53:10,594
[SPEAKER_03]: this is kind of like the you know it was much different it took scenes inspired by the arcade game and kind of made them like actiony things like here's that scene where the disc is kind of falling down well instead of you know obviously they couldn't port the movie type stuff at the time so instead they put in these little clouds and you'd have to run away as they're breathing air this game was just as hard if not harder than the arcade game that was out there terribly hard

1560
01:53:10,954 --> 01:53:13,235
[SPEAKER_12]: The SNES one was actually kind of difficult.

1561
01:53:13,315 --> 01:53:15,356
[SPEAKER_12]: I hated the SNES version of Space Ace, by the way.

1562
01:53:15,496 --> 01:53:23,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the music in Dragon's Lair and then the sequel, they also had Dragon's Lair 2, Escape from Singe's Castle, had awesome music.

1563
01:53:23,901 --> 01:53:24,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to this.

1564
01:53:26,625 --> 01:53:28,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, a little theme song got cut off.

1565
01:53:28,266 --> 01:53:30,008
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, it's the whole Rapids area.

1566
01:53:30,028 --> 01:53:30,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the whole Rapids area.

1567
01:53:31,208 --> 01:53:34,291
[SPEAKER_03]: But I love the music and the boulders area is awesome.

1568
01:53:34,331 --> 01:53:35,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if I can get to that part.

1569
01:53:35,291 --> 01:53:39,014
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go.

1570
01:53:39,695 --> 01:53:44,458
[SPEAKER_03]: This is pretty cool.

1571
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:49,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, I mean, the soundtrack to this game was awesome.

1572
01:53:49,882 --> 01:53:55,206
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it wasn't quite the arcade game, but it was levels kind of inspired by the arcade game every bit as hard.

1573
01:53:55,586 --> 01:53:58,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if I were to play this today, I would not be able to get very far.

1574
01:53:58,807 --> 01:54:04,508
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, see, you have to run past the things, but you're slowly moving back the whole time, and that's just, you know, one of the other stages.

1575
01:54:04,969 --> 01:54:09,630
[SPEAKER_03]: And then later on, you get into, you know, like, here's that one room.

1576
01:54:10,450 --> 01:54:11,950
[SPEAKER_12]: Where the thing takes your hat and your sword?

1577
01:54:12,130 --> 01:54:16,852
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a little more like the arcade version, where you have to hit up at certain times.

1578
01:54:17,772 --> 01:54:19,052
[SPEAKER_03]: The soundtrack was just awesome.

1579
01:54:20,413 --> 01:54:21,133
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're into that whole...

1580
01:54:22,156 --> 01:54:23,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Old School Sounding Stuff.

1581
01:54:23,797 --> 01:54:28,701
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my little aside to the Classic Game of the Week is that the Commodore 64 one is definitely worth your attention.

1582
01:54:28,741 --> 01:54:30,782
[SPEAKER_12]: I just figured it was about time we did Dragon's Lair.

1583
01:54:31,042 --> 01:54:31,583
[SPEAKER_03]: It really was.

1584
01:54:31,623 --> 01:54:32,583
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised it's been.

1585
01:54:32,623 --> 01:54:34,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we've been doing the Classic Game of the Week for a long time, right?

1586
01:54:34,985 --> 01:54:37,087
[SPEAKER_12]: I have had a feeling that I had already done it.

1587
01:54:37,647 --> 01:54:39,528
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I actually went back and checked the list.

1588
01:54:39,648 --> 01:54:42,510
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, whoever updates, you know, the wiki.

1589
01:54:42,651 --> 01:54:43,571
[SPEAKER_12]: Update the rest of it.

1590
01:54:45,312 --> 01:54:46,273
[SPEAKER_12]: Give Drew your money.

1591
01:54:48,094 --> 01:54:50,276
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's about time.

1592
01:54:50,896 --> 01:54:51,397
[SPEAKER_12]: It's about time.

1593
01:54:51,957 --> 01:54:52,298
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1594
01:54:53,039 --> 01:54:57,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think we're going to wrap up part A of our show here, but guys, there is plenty more show to come.

1595
01:54:57,805 --> 01:55:01,249
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some rapid fire news coming up in the next segment.

1596
01:55:01,269 --> 01:55:01,549
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk...

1597
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:16,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, excuse me, about Red Dead Redemption, Split Second getting ported, Guitar Hero, Rock Band Updates, and then Anime coming to your 360, Dead Rising 2 News, Twitter Topics, so get your Twitter Topics in, and the Mailbag.

1598
01:55:16,612 --> 01:55:22,217
[SPEAKER_03]: It is all coming up right after this when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1599
01:55:28,010 --> 01:55:39,155
[SPEAKER_03]: And welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, July the 11th of 2010, where we are taping the 373rd episode of our show.

1600
01:55:39,215 --> 01:55:41,156
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, we've been doing this quite some time.

1601
01:55:41,877 --> 01:55:45,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, we're going to get into some quick, quick news here in a moment.

1602
01:55:45,338 --> 01:55:48,880
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, I wanted to just quickly mention, because I didn't impart A, but it's very important.

1603
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:50,881
[SPEAKER_03]: The big battle is still going on.

1604
01:55:51,201 --> 01:55:56,085
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, it's us versus other all-game shows, or I should say our listeners versus other all-games listeners.

1605
01:55:56,646 --> 01:56:05,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the Soldner X competition wrapped up, and sadly, I thought we had at least one person who was going to participate, but for whatever reason, confusion, I don't know, I don't follow.

1606
01:56:06,715 --> 01:56:07,575
[SPEAKER_03]: The scores didn't happen.

1607
01:56:08,376 --> 01:56:09,957
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1608
01:56:33,012 --> 01:56:40,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Go in there and then click sign up or register for this competition and that way your name will be in there and they'll come looking for you.

1609
01:56:41,654 --> 01:56:45,334
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully we'll be able to get some scores, some points on the board there.

1610
01:56:45,854 --> 01:56:49,155
[SPEAKER_03]: I see Monty Boggs has participated in Pinball FX.

1611
01:56:49,715 --> 01:56:52,015
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully we'll get some more representation there in the big battle.

1612
01:56:52,055 --> 01:56:53,676
[SPEAKER_03]: You have until Friday the 16th.

1613
01:56:53,756 --> 01:56:55,216
[SPEAKER_03]: July 16th is last day.

1614
01:56:55,236 --> 01:56:55,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is that Saturday?

1615
01:56:56,716 --> 01:56:57,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Do my math.

1616
01:56:57,156 --> 01:56:57,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Friday.

1617
01:56:57,416 --> 01:56:57,736
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Friday.

1618
01:56:57,756 --> 01:56:59,917
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have until Friday to get those scores in.

1619
01:56:59,957 --> 01:57:00,557
[SPEAKER_03]: So make sure you...

1620
01:57:01,537 --> 01:57:02,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, make sure you get in on the big battle.

1621
01:57:25,095 --> 01:57:32,121
[SPEAKER_04]: and, you know, given the track record of Rockstar, I'm not going to try to speculate when they're going to release some of these.

1622
01:57:32,361 --> 01:57:38,145
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, one we do know for sure is Legends and Killers, which is coming August 2010 for $10.

1623
01:57:38,506 --> 01:57:53,297
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will feature nine new multiplayer map locations, eight new multiplayer characters, including some from Red Dead Revolver, new projectile weapon, the Tomahawk, and corresponding multiplayer and single-player challenges, and new achievements and trophies.

1624
01:57:54,598 --> 01:58:05,221
[SPEAKER_04]: The next one is coming at a date yet to be determined, and it's called Liars and Cheats, and it'll also be for $10.

1625
01:58:05,641 --> 01:58:15,223
[SPEAKER_04]: With that, it's going to include an attack and defend multiplayer competitive mode and challenges, new multiplayer horse races with mounted combat, which sounds cool,

1626
01:58:16,324 --> 01:58:32,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Play as the heroes and the villains of Red Dead Redemption as well as 8 new multiplayer characters, multiplayer versions of Liar's Dice and Poker from the single player game, and a new weapon Explosive Rifle with corresponding multiplayer and single player challenges, new achievements and trophies.

1627
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:34,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1628
01:58:34,861 --> 01:58:46,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, the third expansion would be Free Roam, which includes additional free roam challenges, new action areas and defensive placements, posse scoring and leaderboards, and new anti-griefing measures in free mode.

1629
01:58:47,965 --> 01:58:49,485
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's coming later on.

1630
01:58:49,945 --> 01:58:52,126
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what game would not be awesome without...

1631
01:58:52,706 --> 01:59:18,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Zombies, Undead Nightmare New single player adventure, challenges and quests 8 new multiplayer zombie characters Additional animals to hunt I can only hope there are zombie animals And new dynamic events and more Hopefully more shotguns Every zombie hunter knows a good shotgun goes far Other fun stuff

1632
01:59:20,583 --> 01:59:21,924
[SPEAKER_04]: We may have talked about this a little bit.

1633
01:59:21,944 --> 01:59:23,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I've mentioned it before.

1634
01:59:23,786 --> 01:59:32,354
[SPEAKER_04]: The Mega Man 8-bit Deathmatch, which was a mod for Doom 2, has now been released in demo form and is available to the public.

1635
01:59:32,914 --> 01:59:42,183
[SPEAKER_04]: This new mod, of course, kind of reskins Doom with the wonderful 8-bit sprites and includes different Mega Man power-ups as well.

1636
01:59:43,144 --> 01:59:44,345
[SPEAKER_04]: You can find this...

1637
01:59:46,106 --> 01:59:56,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, at, uh, HTTP, uh, let's see, cutandstuff.net slash blog slash, uh, question mark, P equals 2218.

1638
01:59:56,932 --> 01:59:57,712
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it's probably one.

1639
01:59:57,732 --> 01:59:59,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm sure everybody's writing that down real quick.

1640
01:59:59,793 --> 02:00:04,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's, uh, the Cut and Stuff blog, and, uh, they've got a bunch of stuff.

1641
02:00:04,476 --> 02:00:07,337
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you've been missing Mega Man Legends, this is as close as you're ever gonna get.

1642
02:00:08,117 --> 02:00:09,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so, uh...

1643
02:00:10,632 --> 02:00:11,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.

1644
02:00:11,212 --> 02:00:11,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks pretty cool.

1645
02:00:12,853 --> 02:00:17,015
[SPEAKER_04]: And then last but not least, we were talking about some PSP games before the break.

1646
02:00:17,335 --> 02:00:22,258
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the PSP games that's coming out will actually be a port of Split Second.

1647
02:00:22,978 --> 02:00:24,139
[SPEAKER_04]: And that'll be pretty awesome.

1648
02:00:24,159 --> 02:00:28,601
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a cool racing game where you get to detonate a bunch of explosions and cause all sorts of mayhem.

1649
02:00:29,481 --> 02:00:31,162
[SPEAKER_04]: And that'll be coming out this fall.

1650
02:00:33,453 --> 02:00:36,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, yet another port on its way to PSP.

1651
02:00:36,637 --> 02:00:37,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy that.

1652
02:00:37,898 --> 02:00:39,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I got some quick stuff for you too.

1653
02:00:39,500 --> 02:00:41,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Dragon Age 2, finally some details on that.

1654
02:00:41,643 --> 02:00:44,546
[SPEAKER_03]: It was missing from E3, but it's dated for March 2011.

1655
02:00:44,666 --> 02:00:52,195
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of conflicting to the February 1st, 2011 date that was in the Dragon Age Origins Awakening, but hey, at least it's kind of close.

1656
02:00:52,575 --> 02:00:54,356
[SPEAKER_03]: March 2011 is when this is coming out.

1657
02:00:54,696 --> 02:00:56,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Big, big change from the first game.

1658
02:00:57,117 --> 02:00:59,718
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be playing as one character named Hawk.

1659
02:00:59,838 --> 02:01:02,279
[SPEAKER_03]: And that could be either a male or a female.

1660
02:01:02,599 --> 02:01:07,121
[SPEAKER_03]: But no more of this like origin story and all this other stuff that the first Dragon Age had.

1661
02:01:07,202 --> 02:01:10,343
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're basically going to be this one character, be it male or female.

1662
02:01:10,483 --> 02:01:12,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Hawk, like Mass Effect where you're Commander Shepard.

1663
02:01:12,984 --> 02:01:13,604
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Commander Shepard.

1664
02:01:13,624 --> 02:01:14,905
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my favorite story in the Citadel.

1665
02:01:15,245 --> 02:01:15,685
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1666
02:01:15,745 --> 02:01:17,446
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of the same type of thing.

1667
02:01:17,926 --> 02:01:24,548
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess they're trying to do that to make more cinematic type of stuff where they can kind of involve Hawk in the cinematics.

1668
02:01:24,848 --> 02:01:26,488
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually address you by name.

1669
02:01:26,728 --> 02:01:27,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1670
02:01:27,688 --> 02:01:31,790
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's their big plans for the game.

1671
02:01:32,070 --> 02:01:32,930
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that could be good.

1672
02:01:34,450 --> 02:01:42,793
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like that some folks are suggesting you could name your character like Hudson Hawk or Ethan Hawk or all these others.

1673
02:01:42,813 --> 02:01:44,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Hudson Hawk is good, just not Mike.

1674
02:01:45,638 --> 02:01:45,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

1675
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:48,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I don't know.

1676
02:01:48,640 --> 02:01:49,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the first game.

1677
02:01:49,861 --> 02:01:51,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious kind of how the second game is going to play out.

1678
02:01:51,863 --> 02:01:53,684
[SPEAKER_03]: That definitely is a radical shift, though.

1679
02:01:53,724 --> 02:01:58,728
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the first being a little more open in the first game really kind of drew a lot of people to that.

1680
02:01:58,788 --> 02:02:00,109
[SPEAKER_03]: But I still think it'll be cool.

1681
02:02:01,030 --> 02:02:01,590
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1682
02:02:22,699 --> 02:02:24,681
[SPEAKER_03]: They kinda have to have a game to rate it.

1683
02:02:48,228 --> 02:03:15,474
[SPEAKER_03]: but do you remember we were talking on this show before about the NBA Jam catchphrase competition and folks can submit their own catchphrases well it's Boom Shaka Laka well that's already in the game but you have to come up with the next Boom Shaka Laka and these are the I guess the four that made it into the game I think objection sustained when you get a block shot no shoot for you

1684
02:03:16,574 --> 02:03:17,094
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.

1685
02:03:19,256 --> 02:03:22,498
[SPEAKER_03]: And the survey says denied on a block.

1686
02:03:22,858 --> 02:03:24,960
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I have no idea where this one comes from.

1687
02:03:25,460 --> 02:03:27,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Bangalangadooda for a dunk.

1688
02:03:27,862 --> 02:03:28,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Say what?

1689
02:03:28,902 --> 02:03:29,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Bangalangadooda.

1690
02:03:33,092 --> 02:03:35,653
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably from the same place that Boom Shakalaka came from?

1691
02:03:35,693 --> 02:03:36,133
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1692
02:03:36,193 --> 02:03:37,093
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like the sequel.

1693
02:03:37,633 --> 02:03:38,154
[SPEAKER_03]: The Reject?

1694
02:03:38,194 --> 02:03:41,815
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to hear a little song made out of Boom Shakalaka and Banga Langa Doodah.

1695
02:03:42,955 --> 02:03:45,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like the singers in an 80s hair band.

1696
02:03:45,276 --> 02:03:45,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1697
02:03:45,956 --> 02:03:47,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

1698
02:03:47,476 --> 02:03:48,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like Sha Na Na.

1699
02:03:49,941 --> 02:03:54,264
[SPEAKER_03]: A little more information is coming out about the Michael Jackson-based video game.

1700
02:03:54,324 --> 02:03:57,126
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be called Michael Jackson The Experience.

1701
02:03:58,127 --> 02:04:04,111
[SPEAKER_03]: And you will actually be able to play as Michael Jackson and you get to relive his iconic performances.

1702
02:04:04,531 --> 02:04:07,453
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would be using the Move, the Connect, or the Wii.

1703
02:04:07,753 --> 02:04:10,755
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're basically going to dance along with the prompts on the screen.

1704
02:04:10,815 --> 02:04:13,617
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also sing along on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.

1705
02:04:14,197 --> 02:04:16,739
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use the Connect's built-in mic to do this.

1706
02:04:17,139 --> 02:04:19,721
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also going to be DS and PSP versions of this game.

1707
02:04:20,141 --> 02:04:21,202
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be tapping.

1708
02:04:21,462 --> 02:04:22,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Think Elite Beat Agents.

1709
02:04:23,164 --> 02:04:23,784
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of cool.

1710
02:04:24,164 --> 02:04:26,907
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out in November if you want to check this game out.

1711
02:04:26,947 --> 02:04:30,690
[SPEAKER_03]: And boy would I pay a lot of money for YouTubes of Loki playing this game.

1712
02:04:31,210 --> 02:04:34,393
[SPEAKER_02]: We've already had a good Michael Jackson based game.

1713
02:04:34,473 --> 02:04:36,014
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called Moonwalker.

1714
02:04:37,095 --> 02:04:38,036
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you said a good game.

1715
02:04:39,417 --> 02:04:41,078
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a good game.

1716
02:04:41,118 --> 02:04:42,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Depends what system you played it on.

1717
02:04:42,619 --> 02:04:44,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Depends what system you played it on.

1718
02:04:44,180 --> 02:04:44,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1719
02:04:44,961 --> 02:04:45,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1720
02:04:46,642 --> 02:04:46,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I would...

1721
02:04:48,456 --> 02:04:49,057
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

1722
02:05:07,300 --> 02:05:11,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we have some definite news in our music games.

1723
02:05:12,082 --> 02:05:22,266
[SPEAKER_12]: We have for a rock band, we've got stuff by Sweet Billy Pilgrim.

1724
02:05:23,126 --> 02:05:26,928
[SPEAKER_12]: We have Get Out, he's a rocker, Orange Amber.

1725
02:05:28,379 --> 02:05:29,940
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, that's the Vines Pack.

1726
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,081
[SPEAKER_12]: My apologies, my apologies.

1727
02:05:31,942 --> 02:05:39,529
[SPEAKER_12]: For the Vines Pack, we have Get Out, He's a Rocker, Orange Amber, Out of the Way, and Ride, and then Sweet Billy Pilgrim, Future Perfect Tense.

1728
02:05:40,970 --> 02:05:45,414
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course, these are basically Buck 99 a piece.

1729
02:05:47,776 --> 02:05:48,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo, Buck 99!

1730
02:05:49,802 --> 02:06:03,896
[SPEAKER_12]: And for DJ Hero, we actually have some good news that the sales are up to 1.2 million units That's pretty good, even though I've seen them clearance at Fry's Well, so much for all y'all who said it was a flop You know what it took?

1731
02:06:04,196 --> 02:06:10,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Price reduction But it was actually considered the best-selling IP of 2009 by Revenue

1732
02:06:12,421 --> 02:06:16,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the key word is by revenue because they're like a hundred and something dollars each.

1733
02:06:17,324 --> 02:06:18,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Way to spin those lyrics.

1734
02:06:18,205 --> 02:06:22,187
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't really start selling until it had a big price drop and then it started selling.

1735
02:06:22,247 --> 02:06:27,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, at least they've figured it out for the next release so they're not going to be charging quite as much.

1736
02:06:27,170 --> 02:06:29,732
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a little bit more like Guitar Hero prices.

1737
02:06:30,492 --> 02:06:31,373
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still expensive.

1738
02:06:32,321 --> 02:06:37,243
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, speaking of Guitar Hero, we actually do have download music for Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero.

1739
02:06:38,064 --> 02:06:43,546
[SPEAKER_12]: We have the Queen 2 track pack, which is a crazy little thing called Love, Killer Queen, and Somebody to Love.

1740
02:06:45,127 --> 02:06:47,288
[SPEAKER_12]: That's on July, well, it's already out then, July 6th.

1741
02:06:47,388 --> 02:06:51,090
[SPEAKER_12]: July 13th, Avenged Sevenfold, Afterlife, Almost Easy, and Scream.

1742
02:06:51,110 --> 02:06:55,652
[SPEAKER_12]: July 20th, Disturbed track pack, Down with the Sickness, Stricken, Indestructible, whatever.

1743
02:06:57,593 --> 02:07:22,323
[SPEAKER_12]: that's my impression of Disturbed except for the really good cover I thought it was give this guy a lozenge is what it is except they did a really good cover of Land of Confusion really good song and then Shinedown on July 27th with Devour, Second Chance, Sound of Madness all I heard was Queen and everything after that was blah blah blah

1744
02:07:22,808 --> 02:07:23,409
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

1745
02:07:23,650 --> 02:07:24,431
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a queen.

1746
02:07:25,453 --> 02:07:25,774
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1747
02:07:26,395 --> 02:07:31,363
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's it for the Rapid Fire News, then I think it might be time for us to get into some Twitter topics.

1748
02:07:34,565 --> 02:07:35,405
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1749
02:07:54,193 --> 02:07:55,014
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this one.

1750
02:07:55,054 --> 02:07:56,615
[SPEAKER_03]: This has to do with Google.

1751
02:07:56,655 --> 02:08:00,138
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had no idea about this until TigerClock kind of linked this.

1752
02:08:00,559 --> 02:08:04,762
[SPEAKER_03]: And this has to do with a big investment that Google made in Zynga.

1753
02:08:06,118 --> 02:08:20,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, according to this report, and I'm reading from Gamasutra here, Google quietly invested between $100 million and $200 million in Zynga as part of its preparation to launch Google Games later this year.

1754
02:08:20,723 --> 02:08:23,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, Google's got to get all up on everything.

1755
02:08:23,424 --> 02:08:26,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever happened to Google's philosophy of don't be evil?

1756
02:08:28,126 --> 02:08:30,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Google, Zynga, no

1757
02:08:56,639 --> 02:09:04,682
[SPEAKER_03]: What's interesting, though, that doesn't necessarily mean you're just going to have Farmville, Frontierville, and Fishville, and What the Fuckville all on Google Games.

1758
02:09:05,062 --> 02:09:06,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I love What the Fuckville.

1759
02:09:07,203 --> 02:09:07,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Stripperville.

1760
02:09:08,004 --> 02:09:09,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wouldn't play Stripperville?

1761
02:09:09,564 --> 02:09:10,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Hornville.

1762
02:09:11,385 --> 02:09:12,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Needs bounce houses.

1763
02:09:12,665 --> 02:09:18,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe there will be new games that come onto Google Games.

1764
02:09:18,088 --> 02:09:18,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

1765
02:09:21,397 --> 02:09:28,185
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's anyone that they would want to invest in, you know, better options, I would say, I don't know, Congregate?

1766
02:09:30,127 --> 02:09:31,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Much better place, you know.

1767
02:09:31,669 --> 02:09:33,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm just saying... Much better developers, too.

1768
02:09:34,433 --> 02:09:35,975
[SPEAKER_03]: How many freaking people were playing FarmVille?

1769
02:09:36,115 --> 02:09:36,676
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot.

1770
02:09:37,356 --> 02:09:38,538
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people.

1771
02:09:38,578 --> 02:09:39,879
[SPEAKER_03]: More than were playing WoW, right?

1772
02:09:40,660 --> 02:09:44,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Hate if you want, but it's just like hating on the Wii.

1773
02:09:45,005 --> 02:09:46,346
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hate it all you want.

1774
02:09:46,747 --> 02:09:49,390
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, it's still the most popular selling system.

1775
02:09:50,331 --> 02:09:51,732
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a fact.

1776
02:09:52,053 --> 02:09:55,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Facebook isn't even a gaming system.

1777
02:09:55,577 --> 02:09:58,260
[SPEAKER_03]: But more people play games there.

1778
02:09:58,780 --> 02:09:59,561
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just how it is.

1779
02:10:15,602 --> 02:10:42,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I work with a lot of people that play these games a lot of co-workers but you know they don't really know the video games I play it's just I don't know crazy I'd be very curious to see how this all plays out though with Google games because of the fact that you know Google has this philosophy of don't be evil but then again Buzz was kind of evil they made some horrible missteps with Buzz I wish internet companies would just learn their freaking lesson with privacy don't you

1780
02:10:44,073 --> 02:10:45,494
[SPEAKER_03]: One more from Tigerclaw for us.

1781
02:10:46,414 --> 02:10:47,495
[SPEAKER_03]: As I want to mention this.

1782
02:10:47,575 --> 02:10:48,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve Wiebe.

1783
02:10:48,915 --> 02:10:49,556
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember him?

1784
02:10:49,856 --> 02:10:50,636
[SPEAKER_03]: The King of Kong?

1785
02:10:50,676 --> 02:10:51,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I do.

1786
02:10:51,237 --> 02:10:51,977
[SPEAKER_12]: Did he finally get it?

1787
02:10:52,657 --> 02:10:55,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, but he got something else that's pretty cool.

1788
02:10:55,739 --> 02:10:58,600
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to be inducted into the International Video Game Hall of Fame.

1789
02:10:58,740 --> 02:10:59,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

1790
02:10:59,521 --> 02:11:03,883
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't forget, it's that doctor or dentist guy, Hank Chien, has it now.

1791
02:11:03,943 --> 02:11:04,903
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even Billy Mitchell.

1792
02:11:04,924 --> 02:11:08,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember a few months ago we had that doctor or dentist or whatever?

1793
02:11:08,505 --> 02:11:09,646
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the King of Kong now.

1794
02:11:10,086 --> 02:11:11,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve Wiebe, Otumwa, Iowa

1795
02:11:30,491 --> 02:11:32,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even pronounce this name.

1796
02:11:32,233 --> 02:11:34,414
[SPEAKER_03]: But you may have heard of this city before.

1797
02:11:34,474 --> 02:11:37,316
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where they're trying to build the International Video Game Hall of Fame.

1798
02:11:37,657 --> 02:11:41,479
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to make this place like the video game capital or whatever.

1799
02:11:42,120 --> 02:11:43,981
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't remember all the stories behind it.

1800
02:11:44,001 --> 02:11:47,644
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was like a really famous photo shoot back in the 80s that took place there.

1801
02:11:47,664 --> 02:11:48,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember hearing about.

1802
02:11:49,185 --> 02:11:49,966
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know.

1803
02:11:50,026 --> 02:11:50,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Just...

1804
02:11:50,786 --> 02:11:56,250
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just because no one's claimed it yet, so this town that has nobody, there's no reason to go there.

1805
02:11:56,270 --> 02:11:57,652
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's a story behind it.

1806
02:11:57,912 --> 02:12:04,397
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there is, and I don't care what it is, but I refuse to believe that you're going to be the capital of game.

1807
02:12:04,497 --> 02:12:05,298
[SPEAKER_03]: A chatter will fill me in.

1808
02:12:05,318 --> 02:12:10,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the part I remember was that you can't even reach it unless it's like a three-hour drive from a nearby airport.

1809
02:12:11,062 --> 02:12:13,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's something else.

1810
02:12:13,404 --> 02:12:14,445
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Iowa, folks.

1811
02:12:16,099 --> 02:12:19,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Someday I will make claim to that same thing and do it better.

1812
02:12:19,921 --> 02:12:22,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Monty Boggs says that's inside the International House of Pancakes.

1813
02:12:23,163 --> 02:12:25,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it's the International House of Gaming.

1814
02:12:26,944 --> 02:12:29,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisbee asks, isn't that the home of Twin Galaxies?

1815
02:12:30,306 --> 02:12:30,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be.

1816
02:12:31,446 --> 02:12:32,527
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be the connection.

1817
02:12:32,567 --> 02:12:33,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.

1818
02:12:33,567 --> 02:12:35,748
[SPEAKER_03]: I always thought the guy from Twin Galaxies had an office.

1819
02:12:37,089 --> 02:12:39,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why Pennsylvania jumps out of my mind, but it does.

1820
02:12:40,163 --> 02:12:42,446
[SPEAKER_03]: or somewhere in Silicon Valley at least, I don't know.

1821
02:12:43,026 --> 02:12:48,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, SpongeTwang sends us a tweet clarifying some stuff about the big battle.

1822
02:12:48,492 --> 02:12:51,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently the Battlefield Bad Company 2 competition was rescheduled.

1823
02:12:52,476 --> 02:12:57,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, he has noticed a Super Street Fighter 4 banner has leaked its way into the rotation.

1824
02:12:57,041 --> 02:13:00,124
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if Derek just hasn't announced anything yet, but it looks like...

1825
02:13:01,005 --> 02:13:03,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Street Fighter 4 Super Street Fighter 4 Super Street Fighter 4

1826
02:13:25,146 --> 02:13:27,767
[SPEAKER_03]: S21 Under Matt says he thinks it's the hometown of Walter Day.

1827
02:13:27,887 --> 02:13:31,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, why does that make it the capital of video?

1828
02:13:32,189 --> 02:13:32,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, whatever.

1829
02:13:32,709 --> 02:13:33,670
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a whole other rant.

1830
02:13:35,570 --> 02:13:40,672
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuyaLastTweet says, Since I didn't hear anything in Part A, thoughts on DDRX2AC?

1831
02:13:42,871 --> 02:13:42,971
[SPEAKER_03]: L.E.D.

1832
02:13:43,031 --> 02:13:44,373
[SPEAKER_03]: remixed some of the Dance Mania songs

1833
02:14:05,672 --> 02:14:09,417
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of neat, but I hate to say it, I'm kind of over DDR.

1834
02:14:09,977 --> 02:14:13,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm more interested in Dance Masters at this point and Dance Central.

1835
02:14:14,743 --> 02:14:15,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know.

1836
02:14:16,645 --> 02:14:18,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me away, I think I might catch that.

1837
02:14:20,329 --> 02:14:23,433
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR just hasn't been interesting for a little while.

1838
02:14:23,573 --> 02:14:24,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry!

1839
02:14:24,554 --> 02:14:25,576
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of how I feel.

1840
02:14:27,634 --> 02:14:32,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I played the, um, um, I can't even think of the name of the damn game.

1841
02:14:33,595 --> 02:14:35,836
[SPEAKER_03]: The Korean push the screen game.

1842
02:14:35,976 --> 02:14:37,176
[SPEAKER_03]: No, push the screen game.

1843
02:14:37,616 --> 02:14:39,577
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Max, Technica, that's it.

1844
02:14:40,857 --> 02:14:44,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I played that and that's more interesting to me right now than DDR, sorry.

1845
02:14:45,198 --> 02:14:46,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's it for Twitter topics.

1846
02:14:46,639 --> 02:14:49,819
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to send us some tweets in the future, twitter.com slash OLR.

1847
02:14:49,940 --> 02:14:51,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, back to the news, Loki.

1848
02:14:53,294 --> 02:14:56,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, soon you'll be able to get some anime on your Xbox.

1849
02:14:57,497 --> 02:15:02,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently Microsoft is teaming up with the video streaming portal Crunchyroll.

1850
02:15:03,042 --> 02:15:11,049
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently the expansion is going to be a partnership with Microsoft for the Zune Marketplace.

1851
02:15:11,809 --> 02:15:15,772
[SPEAKER_04]: And this will bring popular anime titles such as The Melancholy of...

1852
02:15:17,013 --> 02:15:25,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Haruhi Suzumiya, and Giant Killing to the Xbox 360, Zune HD, and Windows PCs.

1853
02:15:26,496 --> 02:15:28,737
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of neat.

1854
02:15:28,777 --> 02:15:32,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess Giant Killing is notable because it's airing in Japan right now.

1855
02:15:34,150 --> 02:15:39,375
[SPEAKER_04]: And this will be the first time these titles have been available for digital download purchase.

1856
02:15:40,776 --> 02:15:45,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting, because doesn't the PS3 have a huge anime library with it?

1857
02:15:46,361 --> 02:15:49,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they do have some anime on there.

1858
02:15:49,644 --> 02:15:56,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I could have sworn they tried testing it out with Queen's Blade and then didn't realize it was such an adult-themed anime.

1859
02:15:57,330 --> 02:15:58,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw that story, too.

1860
02:15:59,192 --> 02:15:59,953
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.

1861
02:16:01,312 --> 02:16:02,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Did this news come out of Anime Expo?

1862
02:16:02,995 --> 02:16:10,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know that was a huge thing that just happened this last week, and maybe that's where some of this is coming from, but I don't know.

1863
02:16:11,143 --> 02:16:14,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't watch a lot of anime, so I feel so apathetic about this.

1864
02:16:15,345 --> 02:16:17,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything you guys in chat?

1865
02:16:17,246 --> 02:16:18,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you guys excited about this?

1866
02:16:18,306 --> 02:16:18,786
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking here.

1867
02:16:18,826 --> 02:16:24,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com Ranma says, I don't support bootleg streaming sites.

1868
02:16:26,850 --> 02:16:27,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1869
02:16:28,451 --> 02:16:29,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're talking about some other stuff.

1870
02:16:29,871 --> 02:16:31,732
[SPEAKER_03]: The iPhone apps and all that stuff.

1871
02:16:34,835 --> 02:16:39,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Ramakun says all the anime from ADV Films is on Netflix via streaming.

1872
02:16:39,798 --> 02:16:41,838
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another way you can get your anime.

1873
02:16:41,938 --> 02:16:43,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, unless you were talking about Crunchyroll.

1874
02:16:43,859 --> 02:16:44,520
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't go there.

1875
02:16:44,540 --> 02:16:45,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't really know.

1876
02:16:47,108 --> 02:16:47,408
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1877
02:16:48,469 --> 02:16:55,255
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, not to go too far back into the past, but I always say this wrong, and Drunami will correct me.

1878
02:16:55,335 --> 02:16:56,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Kamara in chat?

1879
02:16:56,956 --> 02:16:57,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Kamara.

1880
02:16:57,457 --> 02:17:03,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Kamara in chat posts this little cut and paste about...

1881
02:17:04,162 --> 02:17:05,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Otumwa, Iowa.

1882
02:17:06,204 --> 02:17:19,614
[SPEAKER_03]: As the home of Twin Galaxies, so you guys are right, Otumwa was officially proclaimed the video game capital of the world by a mayoral decree issued on November 30th, 1982 by Otumwa Mayor Jerry Parker.

1883
02:17:20,114 --> 02:17:25,900
[SPEAKER_03]: As a result of this most unusual distinction, the city was officially recognized and congratulated by U.S.

1884
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:27,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Senator Charles Grassley.

1885
02:17:28,042 --> 02:17:34,108
[SPEAKER_03]: In connection with this proclamation, the city hosted the first North American Video Game Olympics in the fall of 1982.

1886
02:17:34,368 --> 02:17:40,975
[SPEAKER_12]: That'd be like me standing on my house and saying that this is the laminate flooring capital of the world.

1887
02:17:42,316 --> 02:17:52,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, this is just a bunch of old fat guys sticking the flag in the ground saying I claim this in the name of Spain.

1888
02:17:52,582 --> 02:17:53,083
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1889
02:17:53,183 --> 02:17:54,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a flag?

1890
02:17:54,523 --> 02:17:56,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to check the calendar.

1891
02:17:56,445 --> 02:17:57,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it 1982 still?

1892
02:17:57,846 --> 02:17:58,386
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it is not 1982.

1893
02:17:58,486 --> 02:17:59,847
[SPEAKER_03]: It is now the year 2010.

1894
02:17:59,907 --> 02:18:01,268
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1895
02:18:01,328 --> 02:18:04,430
[SPEAKER_03]: This old fat guy, I'm going to make a proclamation right now.

1896
02:18:05,660 --> 02:18:11,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I hereby rescind that title from however the fuck you pronounce it, Otumwa, Iowa.

1897
02:18:12,244 --> 02:18:15,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I hereby rescind your title.

1898
02:18:16,086 --> 02:18:18,627
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Vuvuzelas agree with me in the grand stance.

1899
02:18:18,727 --> 02:18:20,868
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I make a counter-declaration.

1900
02:18:21,008 --> 02:18:21,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, what?

1901
02:18:21,969 --> 02:18:25,551
[SPEAKER_02]: I declare this room to be the gaming podcast capital of the world.

1902
02:18:27,590 --> 02:18:28,371
[SPEAKER_12]: I second that.

1903
02:18:28,591 --> 02:18:35,276
[SPEAKER_03]: I hereby declare Orange Lounge Radio the official video game podcast of the galaxy.

1904
02:18:35,997 --> 02:18:36,597
[SPEAKER_12]: Woohoo!

1905
02:18:36,778 --> 02:18:37,038
[SPEAKER_03]: See?

1906
02:18:37,078 --> 02:18:37,518
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

1907
02:18:37,598 --> 02:18:38,019
[SPEAKER_03]: It works.

1908
02:18:38,839 --> 02:18:39,820
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we're all analysts.

1909
02:18:39,880 --> 02:18:43,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is the official video game podcast of the galaxy.

1910
02:18:43,803 --> 02:18:44,184
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

1911
02:18:44,784 --> 02:18:45,064
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree.

1912
02:18:45,304 --> 02:18:46,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've written it in decree.

1913
02:18:46,485 --> 02:18:47,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Does somebody have something I can sign?

1914
02:18:48,127 --> 02:18:48,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone put it.

1915
02:18:49,108 --> 02:18:49,588
[SPEAKER_03]: A decree.

1916
02:18:49,608 --> 02:18:50,429
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

1917
02:18:50,449 --> 02:18:51,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Write on that paper.

1918
02:18:51,389 --> 02:18:51,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Decree.

1919
02:18:52,230 --> 02:18:53,511
[SPEAKER_03]: We have it seconded.

1920
02:18:53,531 --> 02:18:54,332
[SPEAKER_02]: We have it witnessed.

1921
02:18:54,532 --> 02:18:55,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Now put it up on the wiki.

1922
02:18:56,073 --> 02:19:25,215
[SPEAKER_03]: and then you're going to put it on the pictures thing on Orange Lounge so everybody knows Orange Lounge Radio is the official video game podcast of the galaxy because if some schmo can do this for his hometown in bumfuck Iowa it's the video game capital of the world then this schmo is going to make his own decrees Iowa is not the capital of anything other than boredom and whatever agriculture they have there

1923
02:19:26,457 --> 02:19:26,958
[SPEAKER_03]: and porn.

1924
02:19:26,978 --> 02:19:28,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan's yelling porn from the living room.

1925
02:19:28,961 --> 02:19:29,983
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's L.A.

1926
02:19:34,010 --> 02:19:34,331
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1927
02:19:36,758 --> 02:19:37,258
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you are.

1928
02:19:37,778 --> 02:19:39,499
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I'm holding up the show here.

1929
02:19:39,599 --> 02:19:40,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Live radio, folks.

1930
02:19:40,899 --> 02:19:41,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1931
02:19:41,559 --> 02:19:42,760
[SPEAKER_02]: This is awesome radio right here.

1932
02:19:42,780 --> 02:19:42,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1933
02:19:42,940 --> 02:19:43,800
[SPEAKER_03]: This is awesome radio.

1934
02:19:43,820 --> 02:19:44,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1935
02:19:44,120 --> 02:19:44,900
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura's writing.

1936
02:19:45,140 --> 02:19:45,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Decree.

1937
02:19:46,300 --> 02:19:49,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is the official podcast.

1938
02:19:49,641 --> 02:19:51,882
[SPEAKER_03]: She didn't even bother to put video game podcast.

1939
02:19:51,902 --> 02:19:52,862
[SPEAKER_03]: She just put podcast.

1940
02:19:53,402 --> 02:19:54,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the official podcast.

1941
02:19:54,582 --> 02:19:55,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, she wrote it in.

1942
02:19:59,764 --> 02:20:00,324
[SPEAKER_03]: She can do that.

1943
02:20:00,384 --> 02:20:00,824
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

1944
02:20:02,632 --> 02:20:07,254
[SPEAKER_04]: This is as legit, if not more legit, than their declaration.

1945
02:20:07,294 --> 02:20:07,934
[SPEAKER_12]: I know a notary.

1946
02:20:09,055 --> 02:20:10,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shit.

1947
02:20:11,176 --> 02:20:12,516
[SPEAKER_12]: I would get this notarized.

1948
02:20:13,216 --> 02:20:15,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Drunami, can you be a notary?

1949
02:20:15,997 --> 02:20:16,998
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I mean, I know a real notary.

1950
02:20:17,298 --> 02:20:17,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you?

1951
02:20:17,578 --> 02:20:18,518
[SPEAKER_12]: Can we get this notarized?

1952
02:20:18,639 --> 02:20:18,999
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably.

1953
02:20:19,119 --> 02:20:19,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1954
02:20:20,239 --> 02:20:21,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, shit.

1955
02:20:23,641 --> 02:20:24,621
[SPEAKER_04]: We need press releases.

1956
02:20:30,001 --> 02:20:31,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone whip up a press release.

1957
02:20:32,264 --> 02:20:34,205
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be on Kotaku in a few days.

1958
02:20:34,225 --> 02:20:40,392
[SPEAKER_12]: This is going to be our official copy, but you know I'm going to have to do a nice designed one with little stars and pink hearts.

1959
02:20:42,734 --> 02:20:44,295
[SPEAKER_04]: And a unicorn jumping across it.

1960
02:20:46,037 --> 02:20:48,059
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you press a button, it plays always.

1961
02:20:49,941 --> 02:20:51,342
[SPEAKER_04]: And then put at the bottom, P.S.

1962
02:20:51,463 --> 02:20:53,344
[SPEAKER_04]: We also rescind the claim to...

1963
02:20:55,174 --> 02:20:57,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I signed it with my left hand so you know I'm serious.

1964
02:20:59,835 --> 02:21:00,415
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1965
02:21:00,555 --> 02:21:01,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have to sign that too?

1966
02:21:01,316 --> 02:21:01,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you do.

1967
02:21:01,836 --> 02:21:03,356
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to sign it as Loki.

1968
02:21:04,496 --> 02:21:05,317
[SPEAKER_03]: It's official decree.

1969
02:21:05,337 --> 02:21:06,217
[SPEAKER_12]: How about Jamie S?

1970
02:21:06,637 --> 02:21:07,157
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1971
02:21:07,717 --> 02:21:09,217
[SPEAKER_12]: Because they can't get my whole name.

1972
02:21:10,998 --> 02:21:13,659
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100 Matt says notarize it and frame it in the studio.

1973
02:21:14,339 --> 02:21:16,179
[SPEAKER_12]: And then our witness.

1974
02:21:16,439 --> 02:21:17,720
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to do a witness thing.

1975
02:21:17,740 --> 02:21:18,680
[SPEAKER_12]: And you should just sign with an X.

1976
02:21:21,867 --> 02:21:22,388
[SPEAKER_03]: I see how it is.

1977
02:21:22,428 --> 02:21:23,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm chopped liver.

1978
02:21:23,648 --> 02:21:25,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew Nami is our official witness.

1979
02:21:27,150 --> 02:21:27,450
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1980
02:21:28,170 --> 02:21:28,590
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

1981
02:21:30,111 --> 02:21:30,411
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1982
02:21:30,811 --> 02:21:31,231
[SPEAKER_03]: It's official.

1983
02:21:31,271 --> 02:21:33,352
[SPEAKER_12]: Written in silver Sharpie.

1984
02:21:33,472 --> 02:21:34,092
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right.

1985
02:21:34,232 --> 02:21:36,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Official video game podcast of the galaxy.

1986
02:21:37,034 --> 02:21:38,234
[SPEAKER_12]: On torn out notebook paper.

1987
02:21:38,594 --> 02:21:38,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1988
02:21:38,894 --> 02:21:42,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize to the other hardworking video game podcasters out there.

1989
02:21:43,036 --> 02:21:44,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you guys do great work.

1990
02:21:44,537 --> 02:21:47,318
[SPEAKER_04]: But you just didn't think of it first.

1991
02:21:47,438 --> 02:21:50,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in the style of Otumwa, whatever, Iowa.

1992
02:21:52,669 --> 02:21:53,510
[SPEAKER_03]: We just beat you to it.

1993
02:21:53,530 --> 02:21:53,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1994
02:21:54,770 --> 02:22:06,116
[SPEAKER_04]: We should figure out whether Capital or like, you know, hell, we could like corner the market in waffles or something, you know, the official home of waffle lovers or the, you know.

1995
02:22:06,436 --> 02:22:06,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, wait.

1996
02:22:07,076 --> 02:22:11,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Amiga777 in chat says, serious guy, tits or get the fuck out.

1997
02:22:12,239 --> 02:22:16,161
[SPEAKER_03]: So DarkSakura, if you wouldn't mind, just kiss the paper with your boobs.

1998
02:22:18,362 --> 02:22:19,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kiss the paper with your boobs.

1999
02:22:19,902 --> 02:22:20,283
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

2000
02:22:20,303 --> 02:22:20,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2001
02:22:21,818 --> 02:22:22,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hi, Dan.

2002
02:22:22,518 --> 02:22:23,039
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing?

2003
02:22:23,759 --> 02:22:24,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit.

2004
02:22:24,659 --> 02:22:25,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan just walked in.

2005
02:22:25,399 --> 02:22:26,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, how's it going, Dan?

2006
02:22:26,580 --> 02:22:27,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, did you hear?

2007
02:22:27,140 --> 02:22:30,482
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear Atuma, Iowa used to have a hell of an arcade.

2008
02:22:30,682 --> 02:22:34,043
[SPEAKER_03]: You are guesting on the official video game podcast of the galaxy.

2009
02:22:34,063 --> 02:22:34,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Of the galaxy.

2010
02:22:34,823 --> 02:22:35,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Of the galaxy.

2011
02:22:37,684 --> 02:22:40,886
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently the laminate floor capital of the world.

2012
02:22:41,966 --> 02:22:43,787
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't stand on the house and declare it yet.

2013
02:22:44,407 --> 02:22:46,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Our laminate floor is awesome.

2014
02:22:46,756 --> 02:22:47,597
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesomely dirty.

2015
02:22:47,617 --> 02:22:48,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2016
02:22:48,118 --> 02:22:50,601
[SPEAKER_12]: Because someone dripped margarita mix in the living room.

2017
02:22:50,761 --> 02:22:51,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Get to mopping.

2018
02:22:52,704 --> 02:22:53,565
[SPEAKER_12]: You spilled it, dude.

2019
02:22:53,625 --> 02:22:54,406
[SPEAKER_07]: With your hair.

2020
02:22:55,408 --> 02:22:56,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Bite my butt.

2021
02:22:56,169 --> 02:23:01,075
[SPEAKER_03]: The chat room is expressing major concern about Bobby and that we have taken the galaxy away from Bobby.

2022
02:23:01,135 --> 02:23:01,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, look.

2023
02:23:01,996 --> 02:23:03,859
[SPEAKER_12]: He can have the next galaxy over.

2024
02:23:05,160 --> 02:23:07,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby can have... We will give Bobby Pluto.

2025
02:23:08,323 --> 02:23:08,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?

2026
02:23:08,924 --> 02:23:09,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby can have Pluto.

2027
02:23:10,706 --> 02:23:11,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody loves Pluto.

2028
02:23:11,907 --> 02:23:12,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a planet?

2029
02:23:12,708 --> 02:23:13,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it not?

2030
02:23:13,228 --> 02:23:13,929
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know.

2031
02:23:14,149 --> 02:23:14,770
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't care.

2032
02:23:14,890 --> 02:23:15,671
[SPEAKER_03]: It's yours, Bobby.

2033
02:23:15,831 --> 02:23:16,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun with it.

2034
02:23:16,472 --> 02:23:18,193
[SPEAKER_04]: He could have, you know, what is it?

2035
02:23:18,213 --> 02:23:24,199
[SPEAKER_04]: The official video game radio show of... He can be...

2036
02:23:29,378 --> 02:23:34,963
[SPEAKER_12]: If we are the podcast of it, he can have the voice of the galaxy.

2037
02:23:35,183 --> 02:23:35,483
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2038
02:23:35,924 --> 02:23:40,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Monty Boggs says, congratulations to Orange Laundry for jumping the shark with such finesse.

2039
02:23:40,328 --> 02:23:40,588
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

2040
02:23:40,848 --> 02:23:42,650
[SPEAKER_03]: We did it with style.

2041
02:23:42,790 --> 02:23:47,555
[SPEAKER_12]: This is going to stay at my desk so I can look at it every day and go, what the fuck were we thinking?

2042
02:23:47,575 --> 02:23:48,175
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2043
02:23:48,856 --> 02:23:50,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to video game news.

2044
02:23:52,443 --> 02:23:54,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had the what the hell are we doing moment.

2045
02:23:55,865 --> 02:23:58,247
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, and I didn't even bother to cut it at the perforation.

2046
02:23:58,287 --> 02:23:59,367
[SPEAKER_12]: I just pulled it right out of the book.

2047
02:23:59,407 --> 02:24:00,068
[SPEAKER_12]: That's ghetto.

2048
02:24:00,108 --> 02:24:04,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Tigerclaw says, Sky, for a second I thought you would say Bobby would have Uranus.

2049
02:24:05,831 --> 02:24:08,073
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I can think of other podcasts that can have that.

2050
02:24:08,413 --> 02:24:08,713
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2051
02:24:09,694 --> 02:24:10,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's move on.

2052
02:24:12,275 --> 02:24:14,937
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to talk about, back to gaming news, I know, hard to believe.

2053
02:24:15,277 --> 02:24:16,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about this.

2054
02:24:16,078 --> 02:24:18,019
[SPEAKER_03]: This has to do with Connectimals.

2055
02:24:18,766 --> 02:24:19,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Burger King Burger King Burger King

2056
02:24:38,904 --> 02:24:47,393
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to actually get little stuffed animals that can be scanned by the Kinect's camera to create the same animal in the game.

2057
02:24:47,854 --> 02:24:51,538
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can have them interact with your regular pet Kinectimal.

2058
02:24:52,139 --> 02:24:52,900
[SPEAKER_03]: And there you go.

2059
02:24:53,941 --> 02:24:59,385
[SPEAKER_03]: So instead of the BK games we were hearing about, now you're going to get little mini-Connectimals or whatever.

2060
02:24:59,566 --> 02:25:06,732
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is, it's just going to be a little card that will easily be scanned and posted on the internet, so you don't even have to buy these.

2061
02:25:07,512 --> 02:25:12,417
[SPEAKER_04]: If they were smart, since the Kinect can scan in objects, they should actually do the stuffed animal.

2062
02:25:12,717 --> 02:25:14,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you'd have to actually have a picture of the stuffed animal.

2063
02:25:17,133 --> 02:25:21,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, how long is it going to be though before there's just an internet page with all the barcodes?

2064
02:25:22,759 --> 02:25:27,243
[SPEAKER_02]: So after you stuff your face with a triple whopper, you can go and move around a little bit on Kinect.

2065
02:25:27,472 --> 02:25:28,853
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I love about this.

2066
02:25:28,973 --> 02:25:34,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, at least it's Connectimals and not Dance Central, but that would crack me up if Dance Central had a tie-in with Burger King.

2067
02:25:34,857 --> 02:25:39,180
[SPEAKER_12]: This was like the old barcode scanner games that were out in Japan, remember?

2068
02:25:39,700 --> 02:25:47,886
[SPEAKER_12]: It was like one particular brand of ramen would make this ultimate monster, and everyone was buying out this one brand of ramen.

2069
02:25:49,216 --> 02:26:09,081
[SPEAKER_04]: E-Reader for life they did the same thing with Viva Pinata and in fact people started hacking the actual codes and unlocked more animals they didn't give away stuff that wasn't in the game or at least it was in the game but never released for the game

2070
02:26:11,044 --> 02:26:14,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting though, Microsoft is very aggressive with the marketing for this thing.

2071
02:26:14,308 --> 02:26:16,350
[SPEAKER_03]: They really, really want it to take off.

2072
02:26:16,590 --> 02:26:21,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Burger King, Macy's, and, you know, in their own stores.

2073
02:26:22,056 --> 02:26:25,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas, you know, where's PlayStation Move advertising?

2074
02:26:27,810 --> 02:26:28,390
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2075
02:26:58,214 --> 02:27:13,293
[SPEAKER_12]: appreciate that oh all our plushies alright so now you know what's official you're listening to the official video game podcast of the galaxy well Rock Band 3 has decided to do something nice for all those people who can't hold a tune to save their fucking life um

2076
02:27:15,305 --> 02:27:24,567
[SPEAKER_12]: It, um, has, uh, harmonics and, uh, isotope, um, have, uh, done a real-time pitch correction.

2077
02:27:24,587 --> 02:27:25,647
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, they have autotune.

2078
02:27:26,707 --> 02:27:33,608
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, it's gonna put everybody into the right key when it plays through so that they don't sound like crap.

2079
02:27:33,728 --> 02:27:41,629
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, what I want to do, I have this one friend who, I actually have a couple friends who are intensely tone-deaf enough that it makes my, um, my liver quiver.

2080
02:27:42,710 --> 02:27:42,830
[SPEAKER_12]: Um.

2081
02:27:43,210 --> 02:27:43,870
[SPEAKER_12]: That rhymed.

2082
02:27:44,210 --> 02:27:44,490
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

2083
02:27:46,110 --> 02:27:53,472
[SPEAKER_12]: But I would like to see if I actually can make these people who are so unbelievably tone deaf hold a key.

2084
02:27:54,692 --> 02:27:57,093
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if anyone knows this little fact about me.

2085
02:27:57,733 --> 02:28:03,895
[SPEAKER_12]: I hear perfect pitch and it drives me completely nuts because it's even worse when I sing and hear myself go out of tune.

2086
02:28:05,956 --> 02:28:14,038
[SPEAKER_12]: Listening to somebody else go, just not being able to hold a tune makes me nauseous, literally nauseous.

2087
02:28:15,796 --> 02:28:16,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Outro Music

2088
02:28:41,738 --> 02:28:48,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, I think if you want to get really into the science of it and all, autotune is like a post-production thing, and this is a in-production thing.

2089
02:28:48,724 --> 02:28:51,787
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, they're available in almost any recording studio.

2090
02:28:53,228 --> 02:28:55,530
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, how come do you think some people just sound like crap live?

2091
02:28:56,511 --> 02:28:59,093
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bummer, though, you're not going to be able to hear the voices over the internet.

2092
02:28:59,133 --> 02:29:03,557
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, at the same time, maybe that's a blessing, but I think there's some people that wouldn't mind, you know, being able to sing.

2093
02:29:04,077 --> 02:29:07,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that with the lag and the time and everything, it's probably not possible, but...

2094
02:29:07,836 --> 02:29:12,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, what would be wrong with maybe having the singer start five seconds before the rest of the band?

2095
02:29:12,980 --> 02:29:16,082
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess maybe with the scoring system it wouldn't really work out.

2096
02:29:16,462 --> 02:29:18,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I really, though... Have the voice play on a replay.

2097
02:29:20,005 --> 02:29:20,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

2098
02:29:20,706 --> 02:29:24,829
[SPEAKER_12]: I really, though... I think it would be nice if this was an option that you could turn off.

2099
02:29:25,649 --> 02:29:30,653
[SPEAKER_12]: But certainly, you know, I think that the option to turn it on should be on the other player's side.

2100
02:29:31,153 --> 02:29:32,334
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're doing this on the internet.

2101
02:29:33,155 --> 02:29:36,217
[SPEAKER_12]: For people like me, who can't stand to listen to people be out of tune.

2102
02:29:36,963 --> 02:29:37,303
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2103
02:29:58,145 --> 02:30:12,667
[SPEAKER_03]: although you can always just do party chat and do it that way but you know true you know one little bit will be delayed it's it's because I've played rock band with a singer who didn't put their mic their regular mic on mute and it was delayed and it actually can really throw you off when you're trying to play guitar or something else

2104
02:30:14,349 --> 02:30:28,583
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I had predicted for Rock Band 3 that didn't end up happening, or at least not yet anyway, was that they were going to go more the SingStar route of being able to share your performances and being able to have that community of your YouTube-esque sharing of performances.

2105
02:30:28,623 --> 02:30:28,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

2106
02:30:29,024 --> 02:30:31,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's still in the cards for the future, although I kind of doubt it at this point.

2107
02:30:32,888 --> 02:30:35,030
[SPEAKER_03]: This would have kind of added to that, though, in a way.

2108
02:30:35,650 --> 02:30:37,252
[SPEAKER_03]: A little more professional touch to it.

2109
02:30:37,332 --> 02:30:37,913
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for watching!

2110
02:30:54,393 --> 02:30:56,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe like once, like a rock band thing.

2111
02:30:57,154 --> 02:30:59,595
[SPEAKER_12]: She's got a crazy powerful voice.

2112
02:30:59,615 --> 02:31:01,296
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a little more classically trained, right?

2113
02:31:01,956 --> 02:31:02,456
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.

2114
02:31:02,816 --> 02:31:06,298
[SPEAKER_12]: She does tend to edge more towards the classically trained, but she can belt them out.

2115
02:31:06,358 --> 02:31:08,199
[SPEAKER_12]: She can really sing.

2116
02:31:08,219 --> 02:31:09,039
[SPEAKER_12]: She's got a great voice.

2117
02:31:10,339 --> 02:31:16,982
[SPEAKER_12]: I like having things at the lower level when she's playing because then it won't make her fail the song for having fun with it.

2118
02:31:17,162 --> 02:31:18,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I can sing Madonna.

2119
02:31:18,204 --> 02:31:19,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Just ask the listeners of Understation Live.

2120
02:31:20,087 --> 02:31:24,115
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I can't believe that you and Tiara got me singing Abba Rock Band.

2121
02:31:24,836 --> 02:31:25,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that was fun.

2122
02:31:26,097 --> 02:31:27,557
[SPEAKER_12]: Is Tiara listening?

2123
02:31:28,298 --> 02:31:28,998
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think so.

2124
02:31:29,018 --> 02:31:34,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiara, Tiara, Tiara, come back to Sacramento because we need to make Jamie play ABBA.

2125
02:31:35,101 --> 02:31:36,261
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not ABBA Rock Band, by the way.

2126
02:31:36,281 --> 02:31:36,862
[SPEAKER_03]: It's SingStar ABBA.

2127
02:31:36,982 --> 02:31:37,682
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I was talking about.

2128
02:31:37,702 --> 02:31:38,542
[SPEAKER_12]: SingStar ABBA.

2129
02:31:39,323 --> 02:31:40,903
[SPEAKER_11]: I just can't believe that I actually did good at it.

2130
02:31:41,604 --> 02:31:42,064
[SPEAKER_11]: It's fun.

2131
02:31:43,204 --> 02:31:45,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to get SingStar Queen now that it's discounted.

2132
02:31:45,766 --> 02:31:46,326
[SPEAKER_12]: I would play that.

2133
02:31:47,466 --> 02:31:48,127
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're right.

2134
02:31:48,207 --> 02:31:51,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Expert doesn't give a lot of leeway for stuff like, I don't know, Vibrato.

2135
02:31:52,071 --> 02:31:52,271
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

2136
02:31:52,991 --> 02:31:55,793
[SPEAKER_12]: But you know, remember when Karaoke Revolution was coming out?

2137
02:31:56,133 --> 02:31:56,333
[SPEAKER_14]: Mm-hmm.

2138
02:31:56,593 --> 02:31:58,714
[SPEAKER_12]: And how it was pretty forgiving here?

2139
02:31:59,295 --> 02:32:04,377
[SPEAKER_12]: The Japanese versions, because I've had friends who had the Japanese versions, they are evil.

2140
02:32:05,438 --> 02:32:13,161
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to pronounce everything perfectly, you have to be dead pitch on, you can't just mumble your way through it, and as long as you hit the key, you're fine.

2141
02:32:13,181 --> 02:32:15,042
[SPEAKER_12]: You actually have to fully pronounce everything right.

2142
02:32:15,743 --> 02:32:18,104
[SPEAKER_12]: Because Japanese itself can be pretty precise.

2143
02:32:18,124 --> 02:32:18,344
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

2144
02:32:18,704 --> 02:32:22,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I played that terrible Karaoke Revolution Glee game that was at E3.

2145
02:32:22,287 --> 02:32:23,348
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very forgiving.

2146
02:32:23,428 --> 02:32:28,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, I was playing it on the easiest level, but you could just get your way through it and probably pass it.

2147
02:32:28,872 --> 02:32:37,779
[SPEAKER_12]: See, that's one thing that I was thinking about with the different games from area to area where you have... Because I'd have to say Japanese is a very precise language.

2148
02:32:38,479 --> 02:32:38,759
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

2149
02:32:39,840 --> 02:32:54,672
[SPEAKER_12]: English, especially American English, I'm sorry, is just... Well, English all over the place has so many variables that I really think that even the harder difficulties of them should have more of an allowance.

2150
02:32:55,353 --> 02:32:57,955
[SPEAKER_03]: I am really curious to see how this new vocal system plays out, though.

2151
02:32:57,975 --> 02:33:00,217
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm really interested, too, because I know I'm probably going to get it.

2152
02:33:00,597 --> 02:33:00,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

2153
02:33:00,898 --> 02:33:01,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to get Rock Band.

2154
02:33:01,758 --> 02:33:02,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Rock Band's awesome.

2155
02:33:03,534 --> 02:33:07,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, couple more stories for you guys in the mailbag in the FUs of the week.

2156
02:33:07,396 --> 02:33:08,456
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the Skype line.

2157
02:33:08,757 --> 02:33:12,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR in a little bit here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2158
02:33:12,538 --> 02:33:13,919
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, some news from Loki.

2159
02:33:15,030 --> 02:33:21,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Dead Rising 2, they've announced a special edition for Europe called the Outbreak Pack.

2160
02:33:22,592 --> 02:33:26,234
[SPEAKER_04]: And with it, you're going to be getting some pretty cool tchotchkes, actually.

2161
02:33:26,294 --> 02:33:37,277
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like a zombie figurine, a surfboard head, which I'm only assuming goes on the zombie, and a cone, which also can go on the head of the zombie, I'm assuming.

2162
02:33:38,397 --> 02:33:48,560
[SPEAKER_04]: and looks like a voucher for a premium theme and some other console specific items as well.

2163
02:33:49,140 --> 02:33:51,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I do love the little serve bot head for the zombie.

2164
02:33:51,760 --> 02:33:52,921
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty awesome.

2165
02:33:53,001 --> 02:33:54,621
[SPEAKER_04]: It is pretty awesome.

2166
02:33:55,281 --> 02:33:57,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Corsi announced that this is not coming out over here.

2167
02:33:58,322 --> 02:34:20,487
[SPEAKER_04]: of course not at all thankfully though we do have something coming out over here and this hasn't really been announced yet but I do know what's actually in the special edition it's not that exciting actually it's kind of standard special edition fair a lot of Zombrex themed stuff you know Zombrex being the actual I don't know if it's the virus or the

2168
02:34:21,347 --> 02:34:22,287
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2169
02:34:38,435 --> 02:35:04,026
[SPEAKER_04]: also you get an avatar item for the Xbox 360 version and a premium dynamic theme for the Playstation 3 version behind the scenes documentary of the making of Dead Rising 2 and then of course the whole thing comes in a steelbook case that slips on the actual game so that'll be coming out at the end of September now for $79.99

2170
02:35:06,957 --> 02:35:08,000
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of money for a game.

2171
02:35:09,324 --> 02:35:11,229
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you get all that other cool stuff with it, but still.

2172
02:35:12,023 --> 02:35:15,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked Dead Rising 1, but I really didn't play enough of it.

2173
02:35:15,024 --> 02:35:18,206
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those games I really need to go back and revisit because it's pretty cool.

2174
02:35:18,606 --> 02:35:21,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead Rising 2 is kind of more of the same, but not in a bad way.

2175
02:35:22,688 --> 02:35:24,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Crackdown 2, people are making it sound like more of the same.

2176
02:35:24,949 --> 02:35:27,030
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a bad thing, but I had a lot of fun with Dead Rising 2.

2177
02:35:27,090 --> 02:35:35,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised they didn't put Dead Rising theme duct tape or something like that in there because the main part of the game is actually creating objects.

2178
02:35:35,513 --> 02:35:36,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2179
02:35:37,074 --> 02:35:41,297
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I saw what I see, a baseball bat get duct taped with nails on the demo I played.

2180
02:35:41,497 --> 02:35:41,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty cool.

2181
02:35:43,178 --> 02:35:52,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I want to talk about this that was floating around some of the blogs this week and it made designer Ben Marsh a little bit famous this week because these aren't real, okay guys?

2182
02:35:53,063 --> 02:35:57,126
[SPEAKER_03]: But he put out some designs there for video game condoms.

2183
02:35:57,686 --> 02:36:02,449
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, it's video game packaging themed condoms for...

2184
02:36:02,609 --> 02:36:07,454
[SPEAKER_03]: All these lovely little video game themed... And I love this.

2185
02:36:07,514 --> 02:36:10,797
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like little variety packs there they have.

2186
02:36:23,468 --> 02:36:34,370
[SPEAKER_03]: But kind of a serious theme here to this because he says here, the packaging aims to create a desire to purchase the product for aesthetic reasons rather than the necessity of condoms.

2187
02:36:34,830 --> 02:36:38,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Simply by owning the product, safer sex is promoted.

2188
02:36:40,952 --> 02:36:41,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

2189
02:36:43,152 --> 02:36:44,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone have a feeling on this?

2190
02:36:44,812 --> 02:36:46,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think this would promote safe sex?

2191
02:36:46,313 --> 02:36:52,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Because people buy it for the joke of it, but then like, you know, if the time comes where it's time to go a-rockin', hey, you're prepared.

2192
02:36:56,400 --> 02:37:00,684
[SPEAKER_04]: It would never fly in the first place because the game companies would never let this be put out.

2193
02:37:00,704 --> 02:37:07,069
[SPEAKER_04]: But assuming that he was able to create a generic enough concept, I suppose people might buy that.

2194
02:37:09,488 --> 02:37:14,730
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, you know, you don't see a lot of gaming related stuff to sex selling.

2195
02:37:14,890 --> 02:37:22,293
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you don't see a lot of people buying, you know, the fake vaginas for those, you know, sex games that they have in Japan.

2196
02:37:22,633 --> 02:37:23,693
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't see people storing those.

2197
02:37:23,713 --> 02:37:24,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, look at that.

2198
02:37:24,174 --> 02:37:24,834
[SPEAKER_04]: That's from a game.

2199
02:37:25,714 --> 02:37:26,655
[SPEAKER_04]: People look at you funny.

2200
02:37:27,795 --> 02:37:33,779
[SPEAKER_04]: As people would look at you funny if you had a box for Donkey Shalong on your... Or Bone Zone 2.

2201
02:37:33,979 --> 02:37:36,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Bone Zone 2, yeah.

2202
02:37:37,161 --> 02:37:43,404
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd be fun gag gifts for people, but... It would never make it past the stigma that gamers don't get laid.

2203
02:37:43,784 --> 02:37:49,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that whole gag gift thing, I could see myself getting like eight boxes of these for my birthday, and it would be like...

2204
02:37:53,502 --> 02:37:54,863
[SPEAKER_03]: It was funny the first time.

2205
02:37:54,883 --> 02:37:56,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven of them would be from Loki.

2206
02:37:56,745 --> 02:37:57,085
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2207
02:37:58,686 --> 02:37:59,467
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean, though.

2208
02:38:01,148 --> 02:38:03,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes with gag gifs, if there's a certain one that speaks to you.

2209
02:38:04,250 --> 02:38:04,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'll tell you this.

2210
02:38:05,231 --> 02:38:09,254
[SPEAKER_03]: One time for Christmas, I kid you not, I got the Survivor board game three times.

2211
02:38:11,736 --> 02:38:12,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure did.

2212
02:38:12,417 --> 02:38:13,017
[SPEAKER_03]: The hell?

2213
02:38:13,278 --> 02:38:15,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Got the Survivor board game three times one Christmas.

2214
02:38:15,739 --> 02:38:18,582
[SPEAKER_03]: The first year, Survivor was big, and everyone knew I watched it every week.

2215
02:38:20,740 --> 02:38:27,086
[SPEAKER_03]: so alright how about we get to another segment here on the show called the mailbag yay

2216
02:38:30,382 --> 02:38:55,086
[SPEAKER_03]: every week you guys send us your emails mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura dives in head first and picks a few of her favorites and reads them for you here on the show she's back to doing the mailbag this week I do hooray next week I get to do it drugged yay so definitely send her lots of emails for next week mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com by the way I want to say real quick Akuma JP says he's actually seen these in Akihabara Akihabara?

2217
02:38:55,286 --> 02:38:56,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry did I say that wrong?

2218
02:38:56,707 --> 02:38:58,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Akihabara yeah you said it about right

2219
02:38:58,507 --> 02:39:01,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that big tech store in Japan.

2220
02:39:02,037 --> 02:39:05,567
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a section of... It's a district.

2221
02:39:06,068 --> 02:39:06,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

2222
02:39:07,845 --> 02:39:11,526
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, hey OLR crew, AZHP here.

2223
02:39:11,706 --> 02:39:16,527
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure Rob has got this on show roll, but I had to throw my two cents in for what it's worth.

2224
02:39:16,947 --> 02:39:19,568
[SPEAKER_12]: Blizzard is going to use Real ID for their forums now.

2225
02:39:20,028 --> 02:39:23,069
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we already bypassed that, but here's... I'm going to continue.

2226
02:39:23,389 --> 02:39:24,169
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's a quote from Blizzard.

2227
02:39:24,509 --> 02:39:35,332
[SPEAKER_12]: Removing the veil of anonymity, typical to online dialogue, will contribute to a more positive forum environment, promote constructive conversations, and connect the Blizzard community in ways they haven't been connected before.

2228
02:39:35,852 --> 02:39:36,093
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

2229
02:39:36,173 --> 02:39:38,958
[SPEAKER_12]: Do they think that flamers will stop just because their name is being shown?

2230
02:39:39,279 --> 02:39:40,901
[SPEAKER_12]: Belligerent people will still be belligerent.

2231
02:39:41,382 --> 02:39:46,171
[SPEAKER_12]: Only now they'll know just who they are arguing with and can go to their house and stab them if they don't agree.

2232
02:39:47,293 --> 02:39:54,736
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, I thought the point of WoW was that you could get away from your real life, not have it follow you around and haunt your every move in WoW.

2233
02:39:55,896 --> 02:40:03,618
[SPEAKER_12]: What if I don't want my coworkers knowing that I post on the WoW forums while I'm supposed to be on the clock, not that I do, I don't even play WoW.

2234
02:40:04,039 --> 02:40:10,821
[SPEAKER_12]: This is just ridiculous, and I have a feeling that this move is going to be one of the worst Blizzard has ever made.

2235
02:40:11,241 --> 02:40:13,142
[SPEAKER_12]: Just wondering what you guys think about this travesty.

2236
02:40:13,262 --> 02:40:14,902
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope it all goes away soon.

2237
02:40:14,983 --> 02:40:16,003
[SPEAKER_12]: Yours truly is HP.

2238
02:40:16,423 --> 02:40:18,484
[SPEAKER_12]: Written and sent while I'm supposed to be on the clock.

2239
02:40:18,604 --> 02:40:18,944
[SPEAKER_12]: P.S.

2240
02:40:19,344 --> 02:40:22,025
[SPEAKER_12]: This will make DarkSakura laugh or cry, I'm not sure which.

2241
02:40:22,365 --> 02:40:25,126
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically the biggest travesty in superhero mashups ever.

2242
02:40:25,447 --> 02:40:26,967
[SPEAKER_12]: Make sure she sees this on the show.

2243
02:40:34,426 --> 02:40:39,710
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a toy box of bootleg superheroes.

2244
02:40:39,770 --> 02:40:48,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Superheroes Justice League with Spider-Man, Batman, Naruto, and Iron Man.

2245
02:40:49,097 --> 02:40:51,179
[SPEAKER_12]: Malfunction does not compute.

2246
02:40:52,700 --> 02:40:55,922
[SPEAKER_12]: By the way, I have to commend you on your mostly perfect grammar and spelling.

2247
02:40:56,002 --> 02:40:57,563
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, your spelling was pretty good.

2248
02:40:57,583 --> 02:41:00,245
[SPEAKER_12]: You've missed a couple of punctuation points.

2249
02:41:00,385 --> 02:41:03,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everybody can agree that Naruto is the greatest superhero ever known.

2250
02:41:05,485 --> 02:41:06,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I find something in your throat, Loki?

2251
02:41:07,273 --> 02:41:07,793
[SPEAKER_12]: Where's the Tribble?

2252
02:41:08,514 --> 02:41:08,934
[SPEAKER_12]: Throw the Tribble.

2253
02:41:09,054 --> 02:41:11,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I prefer Goddamn Batman on Twitter, actually.

2254
02:41:11,615 --> 02:41:17,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you've ever seen Goddamn Batman, and then there's Gosh Dang Robin or something like that.

2255
02:41:17,618 --> 02:41:18,699
[SPEAKER_03]: You said Goddamn Batman.

2256
02:41:18,739 --> 02:41:20,760
[SPEAKER_03]: There's Goddamn Batman and Gosh Dang Robin.

2257
02:41:21,640 --> 02:41:22,901
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't forget the Juggernaut, bitch.

2258
02:41:23,641 --> 02:41:24,121
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyhow.

2259
02:41:24,982 --> 02:41:34,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, we already kind of ran it about Real ID early in the show, but thankfully, AZHP, that part I think that you were really concerned about did go away, but it hasn't all gone away.

2260
02:41:34,587 --> 02:41:35,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's not forget.

2261
02:41:35,601 --> 02:41:38,681
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm still gleefully looking at the decree in shiny silver.

2262
02:41:40,151 --> 02:41:43,513
[SPEAKER_03]: How does it feel to be on the official video game podcast of the galaxy?

2263
02:41:43,653 --> 02:41:44,214
[SPEAKER_12]: Hell yeah.

2264
02:41:44,614 --> 02:41:45,995
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, next up.

2265
02:41:47,236 --> 02:41:49,197
[SPEAKER_12]: It's labeled Choose Your Words Carefully.

2266
02:41:49,838 --> 02:42:02,146
[SPEAKER_12]: In this article on IGN UK, Sony's Shuhei Yoshida claims, This year is the first time we are able to cover the cost of the PlayStation 3, he told IGN.

2267
02:42:02,526 --> 02:42:06,109
[SPEAKER_12]: We aren't making huge money from hardware, but we aren't bleeding like we used to.

2268
02:42:06,909 --> 02:42:13,496
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe he is telling the truth, but it says the PS3 is sold at profit, not that the PS3 program is profitable.

2269
02:42:14,497 --> 02:42:17,200
[SPEAKER_12]: I expect this will take another 8-10 years, if at all.

2270
02:42:17,820 --> 02:42:21,684
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just that now each console digs them a little bit out of the debt hole.

2271
02:42:22,985 --> 02:42:26,669
[SPEAKER_12]: I've also got more questions slash complaints about the EA Game Pass thing.

2272
02:42:27,109 --> 02:42:31,773
[SPEAKER_12]: Since I'm typically not an online gamer, shouldn't I get a refund of $10 on that new EA game?

2273
02:42:32,214 --> 02:42:38,039
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, if they allowed me to turn in the code for rebate, it would make the entire thing a lot more reasonable.

2274
02:42:38,179 --> 02:42:45,786
[SPEAKER_12]: In theory, if the code is still unused, the game should be worth $10 more on resale, but how do you prove it is still good?

2275
02:42:46,446 --> 02:42:49,907
[SPEAKER_12]: and I bet the initial pack-in codes will be deleted after year two.

2276
02:42:50,287 --> 02:42:53,387
[SPEAKER_12]: There's really a lot more screwing of the customer than is obvious.

2277
02:42:53,787 --> 02:42:55,168
[SPEAKER_12]: Hope you have a happy Independence Day.

2278
02:42:55,428 --> 02:43:01,729
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, also, if this can actually be considered part of precedence, well, you probably could actually get away with it.

2279
02:43:02,369 --> 02:43:11,771
[SPEAKER_12]: My laptop, for example, if I had never booted Windows on it and installed Linux, I could have gotten a refund from Dell for $200 and my laptop was $350.

2280
02:43:11,831 --> 02:43:11,971
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, wow.

2281
02:43:14,493 --> 02:43:28,736
[SPEAKER_12]: As long as you never load Windows on them, and prove that you have never loaded Windows on it, that you basically launched right into Linux or something, then you get your money back.

2282
02:43:29,036 --> 02:43:40,218
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bummer that the resellers don't have some type of application to see if the code has been run or not, but then again, probably the whole point of this is to really circumvent the resellers, even though GameStop's supposedly on board.

2283
02:43:41,573 --> 02:43:50,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but then someone malicious could get that code verifier and start typing in random codes to see if there's one that has been used or not used.

2284
02:43:50,140 --> 02:43:52,802
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll give you invalid or unused code.

2285
02:43:52,862 --> 02:43:54,864
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, oh, hey, look, Frisa.

2286
02:43:56,445 --> 02:44:00,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so you guys know here in studio, apparently Winamp has frozen and the stream has died.

2287
02:44:00,708 --> 02:44:01,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

2288
02:44:01,649 --> 02:44:03,450
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got to come right back up here.

2289
02:44:03,931 --> 02:44:07,714
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to hope that the rest of the computer doesn't shut down here.

2290
02:44:08,394 --> 02:44:09,896
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're going to try and keep going here.

2291
02:44:10,356 --> 02:44:12,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't read the next email just yet, DarkSakura.

2292
02:44:12,519 --> 02:44:13,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody needs to stretch for time.

2293
02:44:14,521 --> 02:44:15,802
[SPEAKER_03]: I want someone to go get me some pie.

2294
02:44:15,822 --> 02:44:18,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell the podcast listeners something special while we try to go back up.

2295
02:44:18,586 --> 02:44:19,466
[SPEAKER_12]: Something special?

2296
02:44:19,687 --> 02:44:20,708
[SPEAKER_12]: My boobs are amazing.

2297
02:44:22,563 --> 02:44:23,503
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, my feet are dirty.

2298
02:44:24,103 --> 02:44:25,144
[SPEAKER_12]: See, look how dirty my feet are.

2299
02:44:26,064 --> 02:44:26,904
[SPEAKER_12]: My feet are pretty dirty.

2300
02:44:27,124 --> 02:44:28,965
[SPEAKER_03]: We should be back up on all games now.

2301
02:44:29,085 --> 02:44:29,505
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

2302
02:44:30,025 --> 02:44:34,507
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why the stream just decided to... I'm a dirty girl.

2303
02:44:34,687 --> 02:44:35,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you are.

2304
02:44:35,647 --> 02:44:37,508
[SPEAKER_03]: You should have heard what DarkSakura told us when we were down.

2305
02:44:37,528 --> 02:44:37,928
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just kidding.

2306
02:44:38,508 --> 02:44:40,809
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why the stream just decided to drop.

2307
02:44:40,829 --> 02:44:43,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I do know why because Winamp froze.

2308
02:44:44,050 --> 02:44:45,510
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know why Winamp froze.

2309
02:44:45,630 --> 02:44:46,390
[SPEAKER_03]: That was strange.

2310
02:44:46,830 --> 02:44:47,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Winamp fail.

2311
02:44:47,871 --> 02:44:48,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Llama fail.

2312
02:44:48,971 --> 02:44:49,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, apparently.

2313
02:44:49,811 --> 02:44:50,572
[SPEAKER_11]: It had brain freeze.

2314
02:44:50,952 --> 02:44:51,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Lord.

2315
02:44:51,953 --> 02:44:52,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I do the next email now?

2316
02:44:53,433 --> 02:44:53,814
[SPEAKER_03]: We're back.

2317
02:44:53,874 --> 02:44:55,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you can go on to the next email now that we're back.

2318
02:44:55,775 --> 02:44:56,835
[SPEAKER_12]: This is from Troy.

2319
02:44:57,355 --> 02:45:00,937
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if it's the same person I work with, so I'm not going to make an assumption.

2320
02:45:01,798 --> 02:45:04,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Whoa, your guys' podcast is freaking awesome.

2321
02:45:04,199 --> 02:45:04,939
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a new listener.

2322
02:45:05,119 --> 02:45:09,582
[SPEAKER_12]: I have listened to the last two episodes so far, and I can say that you guys are great podcasters.

2323
02:45:09,922 --> 02:45:11,362
[SPEAKER_12]: A couple things I wanted to ask.

2324
02:45:11,563 --> 02:45:15,625
[SPEAKER_12]: First of all, I would like to know how you came up with the name Orange Dungeons Radio for this video game podcast.

2325
02:45:16,665 --> 02:45:17,827
[SPEAKER_12]: Rewind Short Story

2326
02:45:39,298 --> 02:45:39,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Ninja's Sisterhood

2327
02:45:59,409 --> 02:46:00,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that's true.

2328
02:46:00,370 --> 02:46:01,131
[SPEAKER_03]: There's them too.

2329
02:46:01,331 --> 02:46:02,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Electric Sisterhood.

2330
02:46:02,032 --> 02:46:03,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it Ninja?

2331
02:46:03,173 --> 02:46:04,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Ninja Sister is the host.

2332
02:46:05,355 --> 02:46:06,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Co-host, whatever their deal is.

2333
02:46:07,137 --> 02:46:07,838
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess there's a few.

2334
02:46:07,878 --> 02:46:11,321
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, Orange Lounge doesn't really make most people think video games.

2335
02:46:11,882 --> 02:46:13,103
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to tell a story or me?

2336
02:46:14,104 --> 02:46:14,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Quick thing.

2337
02:46:14,604 --> 02:46:16,266
[SPEAKER_12]: We were a Bimani podcast to start off.

2338
02:46:16,406 --> 02:46:17,667
[SPEAKER_12]: We named it after a Bimani band.

2339
02:46:18,208 --> 02:46:18,788
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge.

2340
02:46:19,209 --> 02:46:19,870
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio.

2341
02:46:20,190 --> 02:46:20,530
[SPEAKER_11]: The end.

2342
02:46:21,171 --> 02:46:21,711
[SPEAKER_11]: While on the Bart.

2343
02:46:23,032 --> 02:46:32,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Although the name Orange Lounge stuck because we wanted to kind of evoke that image of we're lounging around talking about games because the whole idea... It's our brand.

2344
02:46:32,856 --> 02:46:36,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's kind of like we used to go to this restaurant called Brookfield's.

2345
02:46:36,177 --> 02:46:37,638
[SPEAKER_03]: It was right in the parking lot of Rosen's Golf Lab.

2346
02:46:37,658 --> 02:46:38,438
[SPEAKER_03]: The old people restaurant.

2347
02:46:38,478 --> 02:46:38,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2348
02:46:38,938 --> 02:46:39,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God, I miss that.

2349
02:46:39,538 --> 02:46:43,240
[SPEAKER_03]: After a long night of gaming, we'd just sit around and talk shit about games, and that's what we wanted our show to be.

2350
02:46:43,480 --> 02:46:45,041
[SPEAKER_12]: And Rick would always order his Merlot.

2351
02:46:46,541 --> 02:46:48,702
[SPEAKER_12]: I always remembered that Rick would always order his Merlot.

2352
02:46:49,184 --> 02:46:50,645
[SPEAKER_03]: and those cheese sticks were awesome.

2353
02:46:51,026 --> 02:46:51,526
[SPEAKER_03]: They were.

2354
02:46:51,686 --> 02:46:52,147
[SPEAKER_12]: They were amazing.

2355
02:46:52,167 --> 02:46:52,727
[SPEAKER_03]: They were amazing.

2356
02:46:52,887 --> 02:46:53,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so there you go.

2357
02:46:53,548 --> 02:46:54,589
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where Orange Lounge Radio came from.

2358
02:46:54,969 --> 02:46:55,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Bomani.

2359
02:46:55,449 --> 02:46:56,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Traces back to the DDR games.

2360
02:46:57,311 --> 02:47:01,214
[SPEAKER_12]: Second, do you guys have any games to recommend for Xbox PS3?

2361
02:47:02,735 --> 02:47:05,197
[SPEAKER_12]: Singularity recently came out and it looked cool.

2362
02:47:05,278 --> 02:47:06,198
[SPEAKER_12]: Any thoughts on that game?

2363
02:47:06,358 --> 02:47:06,619
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

2364
02:47:06,679 --> 02:47:07,459
[SPEAKER_12]: Love your podcast.

2365
02:47:07,579 --> 02:47:07,900
[SPEAKER_12]: Troy.

2366
02:47:08,615 --> 02:47:10,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I've not played Singularity myself.

2367
02:47:10,977 --> 02:47:16,320
[SPEAKER_03]: What I've heard around The Great Vine is that it's not so great, but I haven't played it myself, so I couldn't tell you.

2368
02:47:16,740 --> 02:47:17,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Got good reviews.

2369
02:47:18,482 --> 02:47:19,582
[SPEAKER_04]: We got mixed reviews, I guess.

2370
02:47:19,602 --> 02:47:25,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Game Informer gave it an 8.5 out of 10, if that makes any difference to you.

2371
02:47:26,087 --> 02:47:32,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Just check Metacritic if you want to get a good benchmark where the game is.

2372
02:47:34,172 --> 02:47:37,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Red Dead Redemption, Crackdown 2 if that's your sort of thing.

2373
02:47:38,155 --> 02:47:39,596
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of sports games coming out.

2374
02:47:39,616 --> 02:47:40,516
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Blur was underrated.

2375
02:47:40,536 --> 02:47:42,097
[SPEAKER_12]: It really helps.

2376
02:47:42,317 --> 02:47:47,881
[SPEAKER_12]: Just a future reference to our players, let us know what type of games you're into before you ask us what to suggest.

2377
02:47:47,981 --> 02:47:54,526
[SPEAKER_12]: I know me in particular, I'm probably the most niche person in this room.

2378
02:47:54,766 --> 02:47:58,888
[SPEAKER_12]: I like playing games where you take pictures of magical girls.

2379
02:47:59,929 --> 02:48:01,550
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just thinking about my Cardcaptor Sakura game.

2380
02:48:02,991 --> 02:48:07,054
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I'm playing, you know, I've been playing some World of Goo.

2381
02:48:07,874 --> 02:48:09,515
[SPEAKER_12]: I like my titles weird.

2382
02:48:10,616 --> 02:48:15,459
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, I loved, oh shit, what's the name of that game with that yellow blob?

2383
02:48:17,820 --> 02:48:19,261
[SPEAKER_12]: Why can't I remember the name of that game, Rob?

2384
02:48:19,961 --> 02:48:20,462
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why.

2385
02:48:20,842 --> 02:48:23,323
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I have the... LocoRoco.

2386
02:48:23,363 --> 02:48:24,224
[SPEAKER_12]: LocoRoco, thank you.

2387
02:48:25,892 --> 02:48:26,813
[SPEAKER_12]: I love LocoRoco.

2388
02:48:27,613 --> 02:48:29,394
[SPEAKER_12]: I like all kinds of weirdness in my games.

2389
02:48:30,015 --> 02:48:30,855
[SPEAKER_12]: I am the niche girl.

2390
02:48:30,975 --> 02:48:32,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we have to know what kind of games you like to really deal with that.

2391
02:48:32,676 --> 02:48:34,517
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have heard her when Katamari Damacy came out.

2392
02:48:35,238 --> 02:48:36,459
[SPEAKER_12]: I was ready to pee.

2393
02:48:38,220 --> 02:48:39,200
[SPEAKER_12]: It was the most awesome thing.

2394
02:48:39,240 --> 02:48:40,281
[SPEAKER_12]: I could barely contain myself.

2395
02:48:40,720 --> 02:48:47,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't own either system, but I'm a fan of the series, so I would actually recommend Tales of Vesperia.

2396
02:48:47,925 --> 02:48:50,266
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can find it, rumor has it they only did one printing.

2397
02:48:50,847 --> 02:48:52,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my suggestion for our listener.

2398
02:48:52,468 --> 02:49:02,694
[SPEAKER_03]: If you really are new to these consoles, like I don't know if you're new to these or you've had these for a while, go back to the bargain bin and try to find some games you missed, because I bet there's a lot of shit out there that you've missed.

2399
02:49:02,995 --> 02:49:04,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'll give you case in point.

2400
02:49:04,556 --> 02:49:06,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Team Fortress 2, for myself.

2401
02:49:07,037 --> 02:49:09,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Somehow missed that game just after, you know, how long has it been now?

2402
02:49:09,678 --> 02:49:11,619
[SPEAKER_03]: About three years now?

2403
02:49:11,659 --> 02:49:11,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Two years.

2404
02:49:11,979 --> 02:49:12,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Two and a half years?

2405
02:49:12,920 --> 02:49:15,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just totally missed that game somehow, but I'm just now getting into it.

2406
02:49:16,021 --> 02:49:18,142
[SPEAKER_12]: You can get the game on eBay, by the way, for $30.

2407
02:49:21,043 --> 02:49:21,303
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2408
02:49:21,404 --> 02:49:22,404
[SPEAKER_12]: Just to let Drew know.

2409
02:49:23,284 --> 02:49:25,165
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you for the email, and we love having new listeners.

2410
02:49:25,886 --> 02:49:26,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Spread the word!

2411
02:49:28,647 --> 02:49:30,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, next and final email.

2412
02:49:32,268 --> 02:49:33,489
[SPEAKER_12]: This comes from Damani.

2413
02:49:34,727 --> 02:49:38,491
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey OLR, I was just wondering, do you guys play any board games?

2414
02:49:39,272 --> 02:49:42,094
[SPEAKER_12]: I never did until we bought Catan, I guess that's Settlers of Catan.

2415
02:49:42,975 --> 02:49:46,499
[SPEAKER_12]: It's so fun and has all these expansion packs to make it never get old.

2416
02:49:47,320 --> 02:49:51,184
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's all I can think about except how awesome Gliding and Crackdown 2 are.

2417
02:49:52,525 --> 02:49:53,386
[SPEAKER_12]: Please spell properly.

2418
02:49:53,826 --> 02:49:54,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Agent Wiggles

2419
02:50:12,066 --> 02:50:28,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Agent Wiggles, that's amazing I have been known to like board games I was always a big fan of Life I really like this question by the way This is a really good question Out of the many random questions we get I think this is a neat question So board games that you like Um

2420
02:50:29,182 --> 02:50:30,263
[SPEAKER_03]: I was always good at Rummy and Spades.

2421
02:50:51,044 --> 02:50:51,904
[SPEAKER_11]: Those were always my games.

2422
02:50:52,064 --> 02:50:55,145
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as board game goes, I was always a fan of Clue growing up.

2423
02:50:55,165 --> 02:50:55,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Clue!

2424
02:50:55,285 --> 02:50:57,346
[SPEAKER_03]: And Clue Master Detective especially.

2425
02:50:57,426 --> 02:50:59,667
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course I love the movie and all that stuff.

2426
02:50:59,987 --> 02:51:00,767
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like the classics.

2427
02:51:01,247 --> 02:51:07,189
[SPEAKER_03]: I could never get into like Axis and Allies and the really complex board game shit too many pieces.

2428
02:51:07,309 --> 02:51:08,169
[SPEAKER_12]: I did play Risk.

2429
02:51:09,610 --> 02:51:11,350
[SPEAKER_12]: As a small child, I played Risk.

2430
02:51:12,450 --> 02:51:15,291
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's probably why I don't like strategy games now.

2431
02:51:15,992 --> 02:51:17,332
[SPEAKER_12]: Because of all the Risk I played as a kid.

2432
02:51:19,248 --> 02:51:20,429
[SPEAKER_12]: and I love Taboo.

2433
02:51:21,490 --> 02:51:23,872
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's not really so much of a board game.

2434
02:51:23,972 --> 02:51:26,674
[SPEAKER_12]: I love Trivial Pursuits, the Genesis Edition ones.

2435
02:51:27,815 --> 02:51:29,496
[SPEAKER_12]: The harder they are, the better I like them.

2436
02:51:31,285 --> 02:51:36,328
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard because there's really two categories of board games.

2437
02:51:36,368 --> 02:51:40,310
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like your Hasbro, Target, Walmart board games.

2438
02:51:40,790 --> 02:51:50,215
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's your like fucking millions of pieces, hardcore, we don't fuck around board games, like imported from foreign countries and all that.

2439
02:51:50,315 --> 02:51:50,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Like...

2440
02:51:51,375 --> 02:52:10,568
[SPEAKER_12]: and it's kind they're two totally different worlds and so it's hard to know which type of those games you're into I hate Monopoly I think Monopoly is really overrated too because if you're gonna play Monopoly don't make any fucking plans if you're gonna play an entire game of Monopoly and be prepared to hate everybody else

2441
02:52:11,115 --> 02:52:11,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I still like Trivial Pursuit.

2442
02:52:30,948 --> 02:52:31,889
[SPEAKER_12]: I love Trivial Pursuits.

2443
02:52:32,029 --> 02:52:34,030
[SPEAKER_03]: My old roommate and I were going to have a board game night.

2444
02:52:34,050 --> 02:52:35,190
[SPEAKER_03]: We never did get around to doing it.

2445
02:52:35,250 --> 02:52:37,931
[SPEAKER_12]: I would totally be in on a board game night if we wanted to start one.

2446
02:52:38,071 --> 02:52:38,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't do it at my place.

2447
02:52:39,552 --> 02:52:45,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I should talk to my friend who owns a house in the south area and see if he would want to do something like that.

2448
02:52:45,635 --> 02:52:51,378
[SPEAKER_02]: The last actual board game I played was electronic assisted board game, The Omega Virus.

2449
02:52:51,418 --> 02:52:52,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anyone remember that?

2450
02:52:52,658 --> 02:52:53,639
[SPEAKER_12]: I think so.

2451
02:52:54,139 --> 02:52:55,900
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like early 90s.

2452
02:52:56,240 --> 02:52:59,162
[SPEAKER_12]: That's in that same family of games like the mall game.

2453
02:52:59,182 --> 02:53:02,384
[SPEAKER_12]: But I mean it's not the same type, but you know what I mean.

2454
02:53:02,584 --> 02:53:03,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was kind of like mall madness.

2455
02:53:04,125 --> 02:53:07,907
[SPEAKER_03]: When you say electronic assisted board game, I think of electronic battleship.

2456
02:53:08,488 --> 02:53:09,809
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to have electronic battleship.

2457
02:53:09,829 --> 02:53:10,449
[SPEAKER_03]: That game was fucking rad.

2458
02:53:10,469 --> 02:53:11,229
[SPEAKER_03]: You know which one I loved?

2459
02:53:11,429 --> 02:53:12,790
[SPEAKER_12]: You know which game I loved for a board game?

2460
02:53:13,231 --> 02:53:13,731
[SPEAKER_12]: Mousetrap.

2461
02:53:14,685 --> 02:53:16,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, except it never worked.

2462
02:53:17,447 --> 02:53:18,248
[SPEAKER_02]: It never worked.

2463
02:53:18,488 --> 02:53:19,930
[SPEAKER_12]: If you tweak parts of them, they don't work.

2464
02:53:20,130 --> 02:53:22,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Serzo in our chatroom says, how about strip poker?

2465
02:53:22,732 --> 02:53:24,213
[SPEAKER_03]: How about munchkin?

2466
02:53:24,233 --> 02:53:24,994
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a classic.

2467
02:53:25,094 --> 02:53:27,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I like playing... What about munchkin?

2468
02:53:27,196 --> 02:53:27,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Catan.

2469
02:53:28,417 --> 02:53:29,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Catan's pretty fun.

2470
02:53:30,498 --> 02:53:35,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Your traditional stuff, we'll play the Game of Life now than Scrabble.

2471
02:53:35,883 --> 02:53:39,846
[SPEAKER_04]: One game, though, I did play with one of my friends a while back, and it was actually a lot of fun.

2472
02:53:39,866 --> 02:53:41,247
[SPEAKER_04]: We really need to play it again.

2473
02:53:41,848 --> 02:53:42,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Cthulhu Rising.

2474
02:53:43,536 --> 02:53:44,677
[SPEAKER_12]: I've heard that's good.

2475
02:53:44,837 --> 02:53:45,638
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

2476
02:53:45,798 --> 02:53:49,701
[SPEAKER_04]: It's you versus, it's basically everybody playing together as a team.

2477
02:53:50,741 --> 02:53:54,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Although we need to cheat the next time we play because it was really fucking hard.

2478
02:53:54,784 --> 02:53:58,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Cthulhu kicked our ass as Cthulhu usually does.

2479
02:53:59,528 --> 02:54:01,009
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminds me of a joke I heard.

2480
02:54:01,249 --> 02:54:01,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry about that.

2481
02:54:01,729 --> 02:54:02,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone sent me a link.

2482
02:54:02,510 --> 02:54:03,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know a video would be on it.

2483
02:54:03,651 --> 02:54:03,951
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

2484
02:54:05,112 --> 02:54:07,473
[SPEAKER_02]: How many Cthulhu investigators does Take Change Lightbulb?

2485
02:54:08,454 --> 02:54:08,814
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them.

2486
02:54:09,034 --> 02:54:09,974
[SPEAKER_02]: You never split the party.

2487
02:54:09,994 --> 02:54:13,415
[SPEAKER_03]: See, now Scherzo's yelling out all those junior high school games.

2488
02:54:13,515 --> 02:54:17,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Spin the Bottle, Two Minutes in the Closet, Truth or Dare.

2489
02:54:17,916 --> 02:54:20,377
[SPEAKER_12]: We're really sticking to board games, okay?

2490
02:54:22,278 --> 02:54:26,099
[SPEAKER_12]: We used to, though, when we would play Monopoly, we would steal the pieces from Clue.

2491
02:54:26,919 --> 02:54:31,360
[SPEAKER_12]: So you could be the lead pipe, or the dagger, or the revolver.

2492
02:54:32,740 --> 02:54:33,360
[SPEAKER_12]: That was always fun.

2493
02:54:33,380 --> 02:54:35,121
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to always fight over who got to be the car.

2494
02:54:36,348 --> 02:54:37,589
[SPEAKER_12]: I never wanted to be the car.

2495
02:54:37,649 --> 02:54:40,531
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to be the boot so I could kick everyone's ass.

2496
02:54:42,933 --> 02:54:45,015
[SPEAKER_02]: This was my logic as a 10-year-old.

2497
02:54:45,055 --> 02:54:46,817
[SPEAKER_02]: This explains so much about Jamie.

2498
02:54:49,138 --> 02:54:50,239
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see what the problem is.

2499
02:54:50,299 --> 02:54:52,981
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I don't have to argue with everybody over who gets the damn car.

2500
02:54:53,082 --> 02:54:54,303
[SPEAKER_12]: It's pewter.

2501
02:54:55,023 --> 02:54:55,684
[SPEAKER_12]: It's pewter.

2502
02:54:56,860 --> 02:54:57,961
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, hold on.

2503
02:54:58,101 --> 02:55:06,147
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll go and get one of my ex's Warhammer figures and I will be the orc with the tank.

2504
02:55:06,467 --> 02:55:07,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

2505
02:55:07,508 --> 02:55:10,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, Cthulhu Rising needs to be an Xbox Live Arcade game.

2506
02:55:11,391 --> 02:55:12,412
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome.

2507
02:55:13,752 --> 02:55:14,072
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2508
02:55:14,593 --> 02:55:17,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any other emails this week to read?

2509
02:55:17,635 --> 02:55:18,416
[SPEAKER_03]: We do not.

2510
02:55:18,796 --> 02:55:19,116
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2511
02:55:19,457 --> 02:55:23,700
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys should send us emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

2512
02:55:24,300 --> 02:55:33,508
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, it is time for us to get out a little bit of the angst that happens to be in our system tonight, and it's a little segment we call the FUs of the Week.

2513
02:55:49,119 --> 02:55:50,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Mine is multifaceted.

2514
02:55:51,321 --> 02:55:52,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, big words.

2515
02:55:53,123 --> 02:55:54,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Faceted is not a big word, Rob.

2516
02:55:55,064 --> 02:55:56,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, it's a little word with a big meaning.

2517
02:55:56,586 --> 02:55:57,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know what a facet is?

2518
02:55:57,767 --> 02:55:59,688
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something you put on the kitchen sink, right?

2519
02:56:01,670 --> 02:56:02,331
[SPEAKER_12]: Where's the treble?

2520
02:56:04,312 --> 02:56:04,633
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob?

2521
02:56:06,715 --> 02:56:07,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, it vibrates.

2522
02:56:07,475 --> 02:56:10,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's put that in my special place.

2523
02:56:10,178 --> 02:56:13,200
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob's got a big hairy ball in his crotch now.

2524
02:56:13,921 --> 02:56:14,682
[SPEAKER_03]: What else is new?

2525
02:56:16,730 --> 02:56:17,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone got a weed whacker?

2526
02:56:18,511 --> 02:56:18,851
[SPEAKER_12]: Lord.

2527
02:56:19,852 --> 02:56:20,993
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, anyway.

2528
02:56:23,154 --> 02:56:29,078
[SPEAKER_12]: It's more of a situational thing, not directly to anyone in particular, just the whole having to wait for my surgery thing really blows.

2529
02:56:29,558 --> 02:56:39,245
[SPEAKER_12]: But I do want to thank my surgeon for basically fitting me in on one of his on-call days to get me in so that I can still legitimately claim my FMLA.

2530
02:56:43,137 --> 02:57:00,093
[SPEAKER_12]: Family Medical Leave Act Also F you to the company that purchased mine for basically I know you're going to outsource all the servicing to India so I really hope that you go to hell for

2531
02:57:03,022 --> 02:57:08,344
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, logically, I try to separate what I logically know from what I emotionally feel, you know?

2532
02:57:09,264 --> 02:57:10,605
[SPEAKER_12]: Logically, it's business.

2533
02:57:11,325 --> 02:57:14,486
[SPEAKER_12]: We were the number one servicer, they were the number two servicer.

2534
02:57:14,906 --> 02:57:16,307
[SPEAKER_12]: They had the money to buy us.

2535
02:57:17,207 --> 02:57:19,288
[SPEAKER_12]: They bought us, now they have no competition.

2536
02:57:19,928 --> 02:57:24,910
[SPEAKER_12]: But still, when you look at people who you've been with, you know, for...

2537
02:57:27,064 --> 02:57:30,165
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of these people, I've worked with the entire time I've been with the company for 10 years.

2538
02:57:30,926 --> 02:57:34,647
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just sort of like, wow, that's a big chapter closing.

2539
02:57:34,867 --> 02:57:42,771
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm not really necessarily going to say an F you to Auckland, because even though they are shitty and not keeping jobs in America, pretty much.

2540
02:57:44,231 --> 02:58:05,594
[SPEAKER_12]: which I have a big issue with I do want to say that it really sucks for all the people who actually enjoyed working there who I've known for ages and I just wish everybody the best all my co-workers for those who are listening to the show and no I won't tell you what department I was in Loki

2541
02:58:06,772 --> 02:58:16,237
[SPEAKER_04]: A big ol' fuck you to Julie Mayo of Roseville, California and Martin Jennings of Roseville, California for wasting three weeks of my time.

2542
02:58:17,078 --> 02:58:25,062
[SPEAKER_04]: May you never get any money from any of your litigations and, for the love of God, take some goddamn responsibility for your firing.

2543
02:58:25,462 --> 02:58:30,405
[SPEAKER_04]: You are a horrible employee, you don't get along with people, and you wonder why you got fired.

2544
02:58:31,866 --> 02:58:33,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe because you're a fucking idiot.

2545
02:58:33,607 --> 02:58:34,067
[SPEAKER_04]: The end.

2546
02:58:34,187 --> 02:58:34,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Allegedly.

2547
02:58:34,847 --> 02:58:36,168
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been sitting on this one.

2548
02:58:37,824 --> 02:58:38,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

2549
02:58:55,254 --> 02:58:56,315
[SPEAKER_03]: My FUs of the week.

2550
02:58:57,515 --> 02:59:02,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Some folks think I'm going to FU the World Cup because I'm Dutch in heritage, but I'm not that upset about it.

2551
02:59:03,139 --> 02:59:04,019
[SPEAKER_12]: My last name's Dutch.

2552
02:59:04,139 --> 02:59:04,820
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just soccer.

2553
02:59:06,601 --> 02:59:07,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

2554
02:59:07,481 --> 02:59:08,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, we're in the U.S.

2555
02:59:08,582 --> 02:59:10,443
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't get as riled up as other places do.

2556
02:59:10,743 --> 02:59:11,544
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also gamers.

2557
02:59:11,564 --> 02:59:12,945
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really care about sports.

2558
02:59:13,225 --> 02:59:15,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give my weekly FU to Real ID.

2559
02:59:15,686 --> 02:59:16,487
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn you.

2560
02:59:16,907 --> 02:59:20,209
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to the fucking Vuvuzela app that Jamie has.

2561
02:59:20,249 --> 02:59:21,350
[SPEAKER_03]: That thing can burn in hell.

2562
02:59:22,290 --> 02:59:23,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop giggling like three-year-olds.

2563
02:59:24,433 --> 02:59:30,561
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why the Nintendo DS and PSP are far superior to the Apple iPhone.

2564
02:59:32,183 --> 02:59:32,984
[SPEAKER_04]: No app like that.

2565
02:59:33,024 --> 02:59:33,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet.

2566
02:59:33,305 --> 02:59:35,267
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't even say it.

2567
02:59:37,869 --> 02:59:41,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like an animal that roams the jungle.

2568
02:59:42,132 --> 02:59:43,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's see.

2569
02:59:43,393 --> 02:59:48,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give an F you to Owie Phantom Side Pains I've been having lately.

2570
02:59:48,516 --> 02:59:49,197
[SPEAKER_03]: That's no fun.

2571
02:59:49,457 --> 02:59:51,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully it's not as bad as what I had before.

2572
02:59:51,138 --> 02:59:51,578
[SPEAKER_03]: That would suck.

2573
02:59:52,659 --> 03:00:01,244
[SPEAKER_03]: And then F you to the fact that I'm probably finally getting rid of my car that I've had longer than I've been doing this show this week.

2574
03:00:01,465 --> 03:00:01,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

2575
03:00:02,503 --> 03:00:03,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

2576
03:00:03,423 --> 03:00:04,404
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't happened yet.

2577
03:00:04,464 --> 03:00:05,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't cheer yet.

2578
03:00:05,144 --> 03:00:05,824
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't happened yet.

2579
03:00:06,725 --> 03:00:07,285
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

2580
03:00:07,965 --> 03:00:12,127
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a frugal person, and if I want to drive my car into the ground, I have every right.

2581
03:00:12,207 --> 03:00:14,908
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have driven that thing into the ground.

2582
03:00:14,948 --> 03:00:15,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Sell it.

2583
03:00:15,448 --> 03:00:16,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's going to buy it?

2584
03:00:16,388 --> 03:00:21,010
[SPEAKER_12]: I will play this the entire... It's that goddamn fucking horn.

2585
03:00:21,030 --> 03:00:22,531
[SPEAKER_12]: I will delete this off of my phone.

2586
03:00:22,871 --> 03:00:25,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to hold you to that.

2587
03:00:25,672 --> 03:00:27,172
[SPEAKER_12]: Do they even have the spit noises?

2588
03:00:27,212 --> 03:00:27,773
[SPEAKER_12]: That's great.

2589
03:00:28,113 --> 03:00:30,834
[SPEAKER_04]: And then she'll get a bee app that makes the same noise.

2590
03:00:31,670 --> 03:00:32,012
[SPEAKER_13]: Drew.

2591
03:00:34,173 --> 03:00:35,294
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to the heat.

2592
03:00:36,414 --> 03:00:38,496
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been screwing with my computer.

2593
03:00:39,236 --> 03:00:40,717
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been screwing with the AC.

2594
03:00:41,737 --> 03:00:44,459
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it may have been screwing with the fridge in my house.

2595
03:00:44,579 --> 03:00:47,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Big F you to my fridge, which finally died.

2596
03:00:48,181 --> 03:01:00,328
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to go out to a storage container in the middle of the day on a 102 fucking degree day to get the fridge, get into a U-Haul.

2597
03:01:00,588 --> 03:01:02,209
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one fucking broke.

2598
03:01:03,578 --> 03:01:21,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Broke down, as in handle broke off the door Take it out, get all the spoiled food out of the fridge Put, I don't know, one third of our food back in the new fridge Plug it in, and then clean up the entire fucking mess that we made in the process Complain, complain, complain

2599
03:01:22,745 --> 03:01:23,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck this heat.

2600
03:01:24,648 --> 03:01:25,610
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all I got.

2601
03:01:25,670 --> 03:01:26,592
[SPEAKER_02]: May as well make it big.

2602
03:01:37,173 --> 03:01:38,775
[SPEAKER_12]: By the way, I said I was going to do this on the show.

2603
03:01:39,256 --> 03:01:42,419
[SPEAKER_12]: This is my impersonation of watching World Cup on Telemundo.

2604
03:01:43,641 --> 03:01:47,926
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, Becky and I, my last week of work, we decided to go get tacos at our usual place.

2605
03:01:48,426 --> 03:01:50,929
[SPEAKER_12]: And we were watching Uruguay versus Netherlands.

2606
03:01:51,931 --> 03:01:52,792
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was great.

2607
03:01:53,252 --> 03:01:55,254
[SPEAKER_12]: But every time, of course, there was a goal.

2608
03:01:55,515 --> 03:01:55,935
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait here.

2609
03:01:56,756 --> 03:01:57,556
[SPEAKER_12]: Where's that camera now?

2610
03:01:57,576 --> 03:02:01,538
[SPEAKER_12]: And then back on your... Goal!

2611
03:02:01,858 --> 03:02:02,058
[SPEAKER_12]: Goal!

2612
03:02:02,259 --> 03:02:03,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Goal!

2613
03:02:03,119 --> 03:02:03,799
[SPEAKER_12]: Goal!

2614
03:02:03,819 --> 03:02:04,099
[SPEAKER_12]: Goal!

2615
03:02:04,139 --> 03:02:04,440
[SPEAKER_12]: Goal!

2616
03:02:04,480 --> 03:02:06,781
[SPEAKER_12]: Goal!

2617
03:02:07,521 --> 03:02:10,342
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my impersonation of watching a World Cup on Telemundo.

2618
03:02:10,602 --> 03:02:11,803
[SPEAKER_03]: You make it sound so riveting.

2619
03:02:12,583 --> 03:02:12,923
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2620
03:02:13,844 --> 03:02:15,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, got some news for us?

2621
03:02:16,545 --> 03:02:16,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2622
03:02:17,245 --> 03:02:22,568
[SPEAKER_04]: The PS3 is becoming white and... Racist.

2623
03:02:24,228 --> 03:02:24,849
[SPEAKER_04]: In Japan.

2624
03:02:24,969 --> 03:02:25,089
[SPEAKER_04]: It's...

2625
03:02:27,290 --> 03:02:28,652
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2626
03:02:46,272 --> 03:02:56,067
[SPEAKER_04]: and we'll also include a new vertical white stand and of course a white DualShock 3 controller and I'll be retailing for 29,980 yen.

2627
03:03:00,091 --> 03:03:00,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking at chat.

2628
03:03:21,698 --> 03:03:21,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

2629
03:03:23,639 --> 03:03:26,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't they already have the Final Fantasy XIII one that was white?

2630
03:03:26,200 --> 03:03:28,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was white with like a pink crap on it.

2631
03:03:29,861 --> 03:03:33,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they put a woman on it, so that's why it didn't sell.

2632
03:03:36,264 --> 03:03:38,505
[SPEAKER_03]: I was waiting to get voodoo.

2633
03:03:38,585 --> 03:03:40,405
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura's distracted by EarthBound.

2634
03:03:40,926 --> 03:03:43,086
[SPEAKER_12]: I was looking at the anti-piracy stuff.

2635
03:03:43,166 --> 03:03:43,747
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for the best.

2636
03:03:44,167 --> 03:03:44,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2637
03:03:48,348 --> 03:03:49,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have anything else to go with that?

2638
03:03:50,799 --> 03:03:56,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they're going to be bundling Resident Evil 5 with the PlayStation Move over there.

2639
03:03:56,483 --> 03:04:01,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, in all honesty, is probably a better game anyways than what Move Sports.

2640
03:04:03,028 --> 03:04:04,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, Move Sports.

2641
03:04:05,710 --> 03:04:09,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop it right now!

2642
03:04:12,754 --> 03:04:17,718
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also supposed to be including, I believe, the gun shooting pack.

2643
03:04:19,224 --> 03:04:31,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they have also announced a big three gun shooting perfect pack that will include Time Crisis, Raising Storm, Dead Storm Pirates, and Time Crisis 4, the arcade version.

2644
03:04:32,368 --> 03:04:33,828
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to cost about $136 or 11,980 yen.

2645
03:04:33,848 --> 03:04:37,049
[SPEAKER_04]: But, of course, the Move bundle with Resident Evil 5, the alternative edition.

2646
03:04:37,109 --> 03:04:41,970
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all going to have alternative music in there.

2647
03:04:49,972 --> 03:05:17,738
[SPEAKER_02]: that'll retail for about $7,980 yen or about $90 once again, I'd rather have Resident Evil 5 than the crappy screw it, pack the Resident Evil game with the white PS3 and call it equal opportunity that way everyone gets offended the nice thing about the move and a lot of that stuff is that those games aren't going to require move that's true much different than the Kinect just so you know

2648
03:05:20,131 --> 03:05:46,826
[SPEAKER_04]: but they may have some games that require them actually no there are games that require the move oh well yeah how the fuck are you gonna play move sports or how are you gonna play the sorcery game or how are you gonna play um well there's a lot there's a lot though that don't require it that's true there are a lot that require it the same could be said about the connect though as well there's a lot what there's child of eden and well that's all that's been announced yet yeah

2649
03:05:49,636 --> 03:05:56,302
[SPEAKER_04]: That's alright that they don't require that the PlayStation Move be required to play certain games because it probably will stink.

2650
03:05:57,623 --> 03:05:57,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2651
03:05:58,503 --> 03:06:02,686
[SPEAKER_03]: One more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2652
03:06:02,847 --> 03:06:08,311
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sorry, this picture that they have photoshopped with the Move in her hand, it looks like a giant sex toy.

2653
03:06:08,791 --> 03:06:12,374
[SPEAKER_04]: A freaking huge giant sex toy with a glowing end on it.

2654
03:06:12,994 --> 03:06:13,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you done?

2655
03:06:13,655 --> 03:06:13,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

2656
03:06:14,055 --> 03:06:14,315
[SPEAKER_03]: You swear?

2657
03:06:14,335 --> 03:06:14,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear.

2658
03:06:14,736 --> 03:06:14,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2659
03:06:15,596 --> 03:06:16,757
[SPEAKER_03]: One more story for you guys tonight.

2660
03:06:17,317 --> 03:06:22,019
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has to do with an OLR favorite game, Eye of Judgment.

2661
03:06:22,780 --> 03:06:25,601
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess you could say a sad end to a story here.

2662
03:06:26,121 --> 03:06:37,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the Eye of Judgment, or as we sometimes call it here on Orange Launch Radio, the Brown Eye of Judgment, or that game we really wish would sell one million copies so that Loki would have to put on a tingle suit when he comes to the show.

2663
03:06:37,587 --> 03:06:39,647
[SPEAKER_03]: You might remember he made that bet a long time ago.

2664
03:06:42,188 --> 03:07:09,660
[SPEAKER_03]: apparently the Eye of Judgment servers are going to be shut down on September 30th and that was a notice now it's on the European Playstation forums but you can just pretty much guess that this pretty much is going to carry over to the states as well so offline play will still be available of course but if you play the Eye of Judgment online you will no longer be able to after September 30th I have something to say about that what?

2665
03:07:11,361 --> 03:07:13,946
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sure all ten of you will be sad.

2666
03:07:15,790 --> 03:07:16,150
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

2667
03:07:16,651 --> 03:07:18,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I said I'm sure all ten of you will be sad.

2668
03:07:22,119 --> 03:07:33,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this also means something else, you guys, is that we made that bet with Loki, and I know you guys were holding out hope that somehow, someway, maybe a price cut or something would happen where this game would sell a million copies.

2669
03:07:34,427 --> 03:07:45,075
[SPEAKER_03]: But guys, now that the developer is even pulling the plug on Eye of Judgment, I think it's time to finally admit, you guys, the bet, ladies and gentlemen, is over.

2670
03:07:48,055 --> 03:07:52,618
[SPEAKER_02]: And not to mention that they stopped printing the game like years ago.

2671
03:07:52,638 --> 03:07:55,200
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even think they printed one million copies.

2672
03:07:55,440 --> 03:07:58,282
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I can guarantee they did not print one million copies.

2673
03:07:58,562 --> 03:08:03,145
[SPEAKER_03]: We never made it official here on the show, so I kind of felt like we needed to finally say...

2674
03:08:04,546 --> 03:08:05,087
[SPEAKER_03]: It's over.

2675
03:08:05,147 --> 03:08:05,987
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, you guys.

2676
03:08:06,187 --> 03:08:06,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.

2677
03:08:06,828 --> 03:08:14,573
[SPEAKER_03]: You lost the bet with Loki, and Loki will not be ever dressing up as Tingle unless you can get him to sign up to something else, which should be your next goal.

2678
03:08:15,594 --> 03:08:22,239
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not able to get him to sign up or do this with the eye of judgment, then you should get him to make a bet somewhere else.

2679
03:08:22,839 --> 03:08:23,600
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just all I'm saying.

2680
03:08:25,333 --> 03:08:25,653
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2681
03:08:26,314 --> 03:08:27,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we ready to take some phone calls?

2682
03:08:28,575 --> 03:08:29,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

2683
03:08:29,156 --> 03:08:30,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

2684
03:08:30,596 --> 03:08:35,360
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR is our phone number or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2685
03:08:35,400 --> 03:08:37,701
[SPEAKER_03]: The Skype line is now open for business.

2686
03:08:38,301 --> 03:08:40,763
[SPEAKER_03]: And meanwhile, some last minute stories for you guys.

2687
03:08:41,804 --> 03:08:44,505
[SPEAKER_03]: I was asked by a listener to throw this out here real quick.

2688
03:08:44,966 --> 03:08:48,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Max 3 is coming out soon.

2689
03:08:48,688 --> 03:08:53,131
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cute because there's this little dog that you can play with here and it's kind of like

2690
03:08:53,231 --> 03:08:53,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Out in the States 2

2691
03:09:10,620 --> 03:09:15,442
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say it was either on the PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 2, maybe.

2692
03:09:16,062 --> 03:09:18,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I remember it's the one with dogs with artillery on it.

2693
03:09:18,603 --> 03:09:19,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's so epic.

2694
03:09:20,584 --> 03:09:21,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.

2695
03:09:21,664 --> 03:09:22,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Dogs with artillery.

2696
03:09:22,624 --> 03:09:23,705
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the same game.

2697
03:09:23,985 --> 03:09:27,226
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember what it's called over here, but that's how I sold it.

2698
03:09:27,266 --> 03:09:30,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, dude, it's dogs with freaking cannons on the back of them.

2699
03:09:30,487 --> 03:09:31,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

2700
03:09:50,679 --> 03:09:51,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Our skyline is open.

2701
03:09:51,859 --> 03:09:55,900
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess our freaking feed dropped for some reason.

2702
03:09:55,920 --> 03:09:58,161
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR is the phone number to call.

2703
03:09:58,861 --> 03:10:00,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why we're having stream fail problems tonight.

2704
03:10:00,921 --> 03:10:01,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I blame Visual Basic.

2705
03:10:02,642 --> 03:10:03,502
[SPEAKER_03]: I blame the Vuvuzela.

2706
03:10:04,182 --> 03:10:04,442
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2707
03:10:06,183 --> 03:10:09,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you have any last minute stories for us while we wait for some phone calls?

2708
03:10:09,904 --> 03:10:10,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Just one.

2709
03:10:10,664 --> 03:10:16,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently the rumor is the new Animal Crossing game for the 3DS will have you as the role of the mayor.

2710
03:10:18,061 --> 03:10:23,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting, so you will have to do stuff for the town Where's that rumor coming from?

2711
03:10:24,025 --> 03:10:38,295
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming from apparently a PDF that came out from Nintendo during E3 Which makes sense because they did put out E3 Or they usually put out PDFs with information regarding their titles Alright, let me get to the phone because we do have a call on hold Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2712
03:10:39,556 --> 03:10:42,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, this is Spazinator Hey Spazinator, what's on your mind?

2713
03:10:44,652 --> 03:10:50,694
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is just basically a follow-up call to the call I had made like two weeks ago.

2714
03:10:52,634 --> 03:10:57,215
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick recap, just in case you or the other listeners forgot.

2715
03:10:58,395 --> 03:11:12,679
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, Sony was having me jump through hoops to get my VOs back after having to send my system in for repair, again, for the yellow light of death.

2716
03:11:13,867 --> 03:11:29,174
[SPEAKER_00]: and basically, I don't know if anyone's seen my little rants on Twitter, but here it is basically a week and a half later and I still don't have all my videos back.

2717
03:11:31,355 --> 03:11:39,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I literally looked at what they did authorize and

2718
03:11:42,665 --> 03:11:50,209
[SPEAKER_00]: I compare that to all the videos that backed up, and basically I still got like 55 videos outstanding.

2719
03:11:51,230 --> 03:11:54,011
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, what the fuck, you know?

2720
03:11:54,231 --> 03:11:56,572
[SPEAKER_03]: You would think you're not the only person, too, that this happens to.

2721
03:11:57,333 --> 03:12:08,138
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird that they don't have a better process, like at least Microsoft seems to have with the whole, you know, releasing your DRM once a year to be able to re-download it.

2722
03:12:08,158 --> 03:12:09,639
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems a little ridiculous.

2723
03:12:09,659 --> 03:12:10,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2724
03:12:11,590 --> 03:12:17,272
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my main gripe more than anything is that, well, it's kind of two-fold.

2725
03:12:18,132 --> 03:12:31,176
[SPEAKER_00]: A, the first one being that Sony's policy in terms of having this done is supposed to be done within 24 to 48 hours of your call.

2726
03:12:32,357 --> 03:12:39,239
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I made the initial call on the Wednesday before the 4th of July,

2727
03:12:40,115 --> 03:12:47,863
[SPEAKER_00]: I've still got all my videos back by that Friday, and like I just said, I'm still missing 55 videos.

2728
03:12:48,924 --> 03:12:59,195
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second gripe that I have is that the Sony reps over there either don't seem to know what the hell they're doing,

2729
03:12:59,838 --> 03:13:02,559
[SPEAKER_00]: or just don't give a shit one way y'all are.

2730
03:13:19,306 --> 03:13:21,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe you should buy hard copies.

2731
03:13:21,347 --> 03:13:27,109
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, does this kind of make you think, wow, this might be the case against digital distribution?

2732
03:13:27,289 --> 03:13:30,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are you walking away from this going, oh, you know what?

2733
03:13:30,290 --> 03:13:32,190
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still about digital distribution.

2734
03:13:33,871 --> 03:13:48,216
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, some of the shows I normally get on a regular basis, for example, I buy the weekly recaps of X-Play and Attack of the Show on a regular basis, and

2735
03:13:49,057 --> 03:14:01,245
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen those on hard copy whatsoever unless I get like a DVD burner and record them directly out the air.

2736
03:14:01,685 --> 03:14:02,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting, okay.

2737
03:14:03,907 --> 03:14:13,553
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in other shows, you know, I've tried looking at places like Blockbuster, Target, and what that, and...

2738
03:14:14,861 --> 03:14:16,242
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost never see them.

2739
03:14:16,902 --> 03:14:28,268
[SPEAKER_00]: My only other recourse would probably be to go to Microsoft, get them there, or get them on PlayStation Network.

2740
03:14:29,169 --> 03:14:32,310
[SPEAKER_00]: Or find some kind of mail order service and buy them that way.

2741
03:14:33,711 --> 03:14:44,297
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, David's Joe Schmoe shouldn't have to jump through hoops, plead and beg, and

2742
03:14:45,060 --> 03:14:50,051
[SPEAKER_00]: yada yada yada to get all their videos back that they rightfully paid for, you know?

2743
03:14:50,171 --> 03:14:54,701
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all I want is to sit down, watch my videos when I'm at it,

2744
03:14:55,171 --> 03:14:57,212
[SPEAKER_00]: Playing my games and whatnot.

2745
03:14:57,432 --> 03:15:00,333
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really, is there really too much to ask for?

2746
03:15:22,603 --> 03:15:41,729
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's really what it boils down to unfortunately I can't make Sony give the stuff back or what have you so there's not a lot we can do but I'm hoping you're able to get conclusion to this but that just really bites and I think unfortunately your story is going to have to be cautioned for everybody else

2747
03:15:43,052 --> 03:15:48,516
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, one final note before I let you go and get to the next call.

2748
03:15:49,937 --> 03:16:03,967
[SPEAKER_00]: I did make my most recent call to Sony this past Friday and basically bitching to them about what's going on with the videos and

2749
03:16:04,775 --> 03:16:13,378
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, they said it's going to take a couple days longer and I should, you know, get them back by Tuesday.

2750
03:16:14,618 --> 03:16:22,281
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if I don't get them by Tuesday, I'm just going to call them back and I'll tell them how pissed off I am and

2751
03:16:22,915 --> 03:16:29,079
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll certainly take all my business over to Microsoft in terms of digital downloads and whatnot.

2752
03:16:29,319 --> 03:16:32,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell them you've got the video game podcast of the galaxy behind your back.

2753
03:16:34,102 --> 03:16:34,402
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

2754
03:16:34,562 --> 03:16:35,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks.

2755
03:16:35,663 --> 03:16:35,983
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

2756
03:16:36,043 --> 03:16:38,084
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, have a good one.

2757
03:16:38,324 --> 03:16:38,584
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

2758
03:16:38,845 --> 03:16:42,247
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll keep you posted as to what's going on.

2759
03:16:42,307 --> 03:16:42,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Please do.

2760
03:16:42,747 --> 03:16:44,688
[SPEAKER_03]: And they can follow you on Twitter too at what?

2761
03:16:44,728 --> 03:16:46,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Spazinator underscore PSN, right?

2762
03:16:47,290 --> 03:16:48,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is there no underscore?

2763
03:16:48,711 --> 03:16:48,911
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2764
03:16:48,931 --> 03:16:49,211
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

2765
03:16:49,611 --> 03:16:49,851
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2766
03:16:50,151 --> 03:16:50,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care, Spazinator.

2767
03:16:51,980 --> 03:16:52,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, you too.

2768
03:16:52,700 --> 03:16:52,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

2769
03:16:53,801 --> 03:16:54,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

2770
03:16:54,401 --> 03:16:58,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I see Bonds in chat says my PS3 yellow ringed on me too.

2771
03:16:58,563 --> 03:17:03,106
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess... And Rob, that's the official video game podcast of the galaxy.

2772
03:17:03,186 --> 03:17:03,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

2773
03:17:04,066 --> 03:17:04,426
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

2774
03:17:04,687 --> 03:17:06,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't violate the decree, did I?

2775
03:17:07,088 --> 03:17:07,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a clause in there?

2776
03:17:07,948 --> 03:17:08,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2777
03:17:08,489 --> 03:17:08,729
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good.

2778
03:17:08,749 --> 03:17:09,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to clarify that.

2779
03:17:09,689 --> 03:17:09,889
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2780
03:17:09,929 --> 03:17:10,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2781
03:17:10,389 --> 03:17:11,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for clarifying that.

2782
03:17:13,211 --> 03:17:16,212
[SPEAKER_03]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the official video game podcast of the galaxy.

2783
03:17:16,553 --> 03:17:20,995
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2784
03:17:23,416 --> 03:17:29,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, SSJ100Matt has advice for Spaznator saying, if you're going to keep getting bitten by this, then just stop downloading videos on it.

2785
03:17:29,298 --> 03:17:31,800
[SPEAKER_03]: It really isn't worth the hassle every six months with this nonsense.

2786
03:17:32,220 --> 03:17:39,563
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I kind of make this comparison to what I'm going through in World of Warcraft right now is that you invest so much in something...

2787
03:17:40,103 --> 03:17:40,864
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2788
03:17:59,076 --> 03:18:05,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, though, what you've got to do is you've got to let his trouble serve as a lesson for everybody else.

2789
03:18:05,438 --> 03:18:08,979
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2790
03:18:09,299 --> 03:18:10,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, do you have any last-minute stories for us?

2791
03:18:11,820 --> 03:18:12,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

2792
03:18:13,660 --> 03:18:18,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Real quick, I guess they're going to be doing a prequel to Dead Space 2 called Dead Space Ignition.

2793
03:18:19,181 --> 03:18:24,643
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be available out on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network slightly before the title is released.

2794
03:18:25,223 --> 03:18:27,605
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2795
03:18:45,796 --> 03:18:49,820
[SPEAKER_04]: But now we actually have release dates and prices for these titles as well.

2796
03:18:50,420 --> 03:18:54,223
[SPEAKER_04]: So, starting July 21st, Limbo will be making its way out.

2797
03:18:54,804 --> 03:18:57,526
[SPEAKER_04]: July 28th has Hydro Thunder Hurricane.

2798
03:18:58,127 --> 03:19:00,509
[SPEAKER_04]: August 4th, Castlevania, Harmony of Despair.

2799
03:19:01,289 --> 03:19:03,111
[SPEAKER_04]: August 11th, Monday Night Combat.

2800
03:19:03,471 --> 03:19:08,935
[SPEAKER_04]: And August 18th, Lara Croft in The Guardian of Light, or as I call it, Lara Croft in Who Gives a Shit.

2801
03:19:09,756 --> 03:19:12,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I hear it's much cooler than you'd think.

2802
03:19:12,618 --> 03:19:14,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what I hear about every single one.

2803
03:19:14,720 --> 03:19:15,420
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess what happens?

2804
03:19:15,600 --> 03:19:16,461
[SPEAKER_03]: They all suck.

2805
03:19:16,581 --> 03:19:18,562
[SPEAKER_03]: All I'm just saying, it's not Tomb Raider.

2806
03:19:18,623 --> 03:19:21,525
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more, you're not supposed to say it's Diablo, but it's Diablo.

2807
03:19:22,926 --> 03:19:23,366
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

2808
03:19:23,446 --> 03:19:25,307
[SPEAKER_04]: If I want to play Diablo, I'll play Diablo.

2809
03:19:27,689 --> 03:19:36,135
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are all going to be out for the new 800 Microsoft price point, which is actually now 1,200 Microsoft points, or $15.

2810
03:19:36,175 --> 03:19:36,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2811
03:19:38,257 --> 03:19:38,557
[SPEAKER_04]: PS15 is the new 5

2812
03:19:52,520 --> 03:19:54,281
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not getting a lot of calls on Skype tonight.

2813
03:19:54,301 --> 03:19:55,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what's going on.

2814
03:19:55,121 --> 03:19:56,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Is something wrong with our line?

2815
03:19:56,862 --> 03:19:57,462
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the deal?

2816
03:19:57,722 --> 03:19:58,662
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the dealio?

2817
03:19:59,723 --> 03:20:01,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Give us a call already, geez.

2818
03:20:01,784 --> 03:20:02,584
[SPEAKER_03]: 877-GAME-OLR.

2819
03:20:03,144 --> 03:20:05,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2820
03:20:06,666 --> 03:20:13,829
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another cave shmup game coming to Xbox Live Arcade, Gouange, and it's going to be released worldwide.

2821
03:20:14,649 --> 03:20:18,090
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's go into the call.

2822
03:20:18,410 --> 03:20:19,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2823
03:20:19,291 --> 03:20:19,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

2824
03:20:20,698 --> 03:20:22,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, good old-fashioned Legend of Zaku here.

2825
03:20:22,559 --> 03:20:24,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hello, Legend of Zaku.

2826
03:20:24,299 --> 03:20:24,999
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

2827
03:20:25,019 --> 03:20:26,219
[SPEAKER_12]: Even old-fashioned.

2828
03:20:26,920 --> 03:20:28,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, nothing much, really.

2829
03:20:28,320 --> 03:20:33,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Just, like, getting back from, like, excursions with my girlfriend over the weekend.

2830
03:20:33,521 --> 03:20:35,182
[SPEAKER_08]: But not anywhere interesting.

2831
03:20:35,842 --> 03:20:37,562
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know you had a girly friend now.

2832
03:20:37,782 --> 03:20:38,442
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your name?

2833
03:20:39,583 --> 03:20:40,383
[SPEAKER_08]: My name's April.

2834
03:20:40,443 --> 03:20:42,603
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been together for about, like, four months now.

2835
03:20:42,903 --> 03:20:44,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Is she a reporter for a major newspaper?

2836
03:20:45,734 --> 03:20:46,314
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

2837
03:20:46,334 --> 03:20:48,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob!

2838
03:20:48,355 --> 03:20:49,955
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was a television station.

2839
03:20:50,075 --> 03:20:50,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to.

2840
03:20:50,635 --> 03:20:51,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it was a TV.

2841
03:20:51,395 --> 03:20:51,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget.

2842
03:20:52,035 --> 03:20:53,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, April!

2843
03:20:54,136 --> 03:20:54,616
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

2844
03:20:55,736 --> 03:21:10,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Besides DDRX2 release, another thing that I noticed was that the former Infinity Ward employees are actually ratcheting up their suit against Activision with more details as to how much Activision created a hostile environment for them.

2845
03:21:12,122 --> 03:21:20,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Stuff like, you know, their top executives telling the Infinity Ward folks to get over it regarding the bonuses that they were promised.

2846
03:21:20,986 --> 03:21:23,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically being interrogated in secrecy.

2847
03:21:24,487 --> 03:21:30,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Stuff that you would see in some sort of like, you know, stuff that you would see during the Soviet Union days.

2848
03:21:30,750 --> 03:21:34,031
[SPEAKER_08]: Where you had a secret police interrogate people out of nowhere.

2849
03:21:34,672 --> 03:21:35,272
[SPEAKER_08]: And just try to...

2850
03:21:35,512 --> 03:21:39,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Did Activision recently exchange 10 spies for 4 of Infinity Ward's spies?

2851
03:21:39,976 --> 03:21:41,938
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of them was this really hot redhead?

2852
03:21:41,958 --> 03:21:42,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps.

2853
03:21:43,019 --> 03:21:44,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I saw something on that.

2854
03:21:44,140 --> 03:21:53,768
[SPEAKER_08]: But I guess it's to the point where they literally withheld bonuses unless they churned out another Modern Warfare game to be completed November of next year.

2855
03:21:53,868 --> 03:21:54,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Stuff like that.

2856
03:21:54,709 --> 03:21:58,853
[SPEAKER_08]: They were basically being whored out to spit out nothing but Modern Warfare.

2857
03:21:59,193 --> 03:22:00,615
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's interesting?

2858
03:22:00,875 --> 03:22:00,975
What?

2859
03:22:01,295 --> 03:22:29,327
[SPEAKER_03]: something similar to what you're saying right now was brought up earlier in the show and it was when Loki was talking about Crackdown 2 and you know we mentioned oh Crackdown 2 has been getting a lot of crap because it's just like Crackdown 1 and we were talking about how the developers had to start from scratch and you know they should just have waited and not say they're going to patch it on the back end and then Drew kind of chimed in and said well that was probably the publisher not the developer and it's kind of interesting because this whole thing you're talking about is publisher bullying the developer

2860
03:22:30,612 --> 03:22:31,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, exactly.

2861
03:22:31,732 --> 03:22:40,034
[SPEAKER_08]: This goes back to the point of who holds the strings and how much power is being wielded by Activision.

2862
03:22:40,114 --> 03:22:44,155
[SPEAKER_08]: In this sense, they're swinging that big stick of theirs, no pun intended.

2863
03:22:44,235 --> 03:22:46,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Who has the bigger penis?

2864
03:22:46,055 --> 03:22:47,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's how it usually is.

2865
03:22:47,936 --> 03:22:49,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember Hellgate London?

2866
03:22:50,536 --> 03:22:54,197
[SPEAKER_02]: That had numerous problems with it, but they had to make the Halloween release date.

2867
03:22:56,134 --> 03:23:06,525
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I mean, Infinity Ward met their deadline ahead of schedule, and yet they're basically asking twice as much from them for very little in exchange.

2868
03:23:06,845 --> 03:23:12,230
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going as far as just giving them crumbs of their bonuses.

2869
03:23:12,411 --> 03:23:15,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put out a pro tip to all the publishers of the world out there.

2870
03:23:15,534 --> 03:23:17,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, in general...

2871
03:23:17,956 --> 03:23:21,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Are gamers going to be pissed if you keep pushing a game back and back and back and back?

2872
03:23:21,918 --> 03:23:25,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they're going to be pissed off and there's going to be rabble rabble on the internet.

2873
03:23:25,721 --> 03:23:31,684
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the day, when that game comes out, do you want to actually sell copies of the game?

2874
03:23:31,824 --> 03:23:34,226
[SPEAKER_03]: If so, it should probably be a good game.

2875
03:23:34,566 --> 03:23:36,327
[SPEAKER_03]: So my advice to the publishers of the world...

2876
03:23:36,767 --> 03:23:39,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Take the time to get it right.

2877
03:23:39,369 --> 03:23:43,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to go through a little bit of belly aching and pains while you make it right?

2878
03:23:43,091 --> 03:23:47,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but at the end of the day, it's going to be worth it because if the game kicks ass, there you go.

2879
03:23:48,654 --> 03:23:51,576
[SPEAKER_03]: How many of you remember, never forget, Super Smash Bros.

2880
03:23:52,116 --> 03:23:58,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Brawl, the new one on the GameCube, on the Wii, was delayed like twice.

2881
03:23:59,161 --> 03:24:01,402
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of them was a huge delay, like six months, right?

2882
03:24:01,422 --> 03:24:04,925
[SPEAKER_08]: They spent more time on it, and as a result, the quality increased.

2883
03:24:04,985 --> 03:24:12,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Now this goes back to my point where Hideo Kojima recently said that Japanese developers are pretty much, they're lacking ambition and creativity.

2884
03:24:13,430 --> 03:24:19,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Something that Activision loves to, you know, this is the same card that Activision plays by milking their franchises to death.

2885
03:24:19,995 --> 03:24:21,536
[SPEAKER_08]: The Japanese are doing likewise.

2886
03:24:24,477 --> 03:24:28,197
[SPEAKER_08]: In other words, if an idea is out of their comfort zone, they're not going to pursue it.

2887
03:24:28,217 --> 03:24:34,759
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more profitable to just create a new sequel of X RPG or X fighting game.

2888
03:24:35,119 --> 03:24:37,739
[SPEAKER_03]: SalaciousPop in our chatroom gives another excellent example.

2889
03:24:37,899 --> 03:24:44,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Arkham Asylum was delayed at least twice, but everyone immediately forgot their angst about it when it hit because it was really good.

2890
03:24:46,661 --> 03:24:50,142
[SPEAKER_03]: I just said last week on the show, I think Final Fantasy XIV should be delayed.

2891
03:24:50,262 --> 03:24:53,223
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the Valves and Blizzards of the world.

2892
03:24:53,243 --> 03:24:58,944
[SPEAKER_02]: They might take forever, but the games they finally do release are worth the wait.

2893
03:24:59,624 --> 03:25:00,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, that's the whole point.

2894
03:25:01,165 --> 03:25:09,747
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why, but then, you know, that doesn't fit well, that doesn't bode well with the public companies and shareholders because they want results in the short term.

2895
03:25:10,908 --> 03:25:13,088
[SPEAKER_08]: or else they're going to stop investing money in that company.

2896
03:25:13,588 --> 03:25:20,890
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is where Activision makes its bread and butter by doing sequels in the short term and not really preparing for long-term investments.

2897
03:25:20,910 --> 03:25:21,510
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2898
03:25:22,350 --> 03:25:24,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Zaku, we've got to let you go to see if anyone else is going to call in.

2899
03:25:25,591 --> 03:25:27,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't forget DDRX2 came out in Japan.

2900
03:25:27,531 --> 03:25:27,691
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

2901
03:25:27,731 --> 03:25:28,171
[SPEAKER_03]: We heard.

2902
03:25:28,231 --> 03:25:28,591
[SPEAKER_03]: We heard.

2903
03:25:28,631 --> 03:25:30,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Really quick, what did you think of the remixes?

2904
03:25:31,132 --> 03:25:32,872
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't heard them yet, but what do you think of that whole idea?

2905
03:25:32,892 --> 03:25:33,472
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot better.

2906
03:25:33,512 --> 03:25:34,892
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the song was a lot better.

2907
03:25:35,592 --> 03:25:36,713
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's something that blows...

2908
03:25:38,573 --> 03:25:44,901
[SPEAKER_08]: In other words, a lot better than what Supernova and possibly Xtreme has offered to blow ZDRX out of the water initially.

2909
03:25:45,141 --> 03:25:47,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Are MP3s out there on the internet now?

2910
03:25:47,884 --> 03:25:50,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear these remix songs?

2911
03:25:50,287 --> 03:25:51,689
[SPEAKER_08]: They've already had videos of it.

2912
03:25:51,729 --> 03:25:55,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they still have the stupid tokens and all that garbage to download stuff?

2913
03:25:56,214 --> 03:25:56,695
[SPEAKER_08]: I doubt it.

2914
03:25:56,755 --> 03:25:57,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I lost track anyways.

2915
03:25:58,877 --> 03:26:01,518
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll tell you how long it's been since I've been following TDR.

2916
03:26:01,978 --> 03:26:03,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to that site.

2917
03:26:03,178 --> 03:26:05,399
[SPEAKER_08]: They're updating the list as we speak.

2918
03:26:05,419 --> 03:26:06,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do I get the songs on here?

2919
03:26:06,999 --> 03:26:08,160
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to play some for the listeners.

2920
03:26:08,200 --> 03:26:08,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do I go?

2921
03:26:08,720 --> 03:26:09,920
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be a while.

2922
03:26:10,601 --> 03:26:13,321
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to have to wait a while until they get good line-out recordings.

2923
03:26:14,142 --> 03:26:14,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's the videos?

2924
03:26:15,022 --> 03:26:15,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's the videos?

2925
03:26:16,022 --> 03:26:18,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they here?

2926
03:26:18,123 --> 03:26:19,803
[SPEAKER_08]: It should be one of the top stories.

2927
03:26:20,143 --> 03:26:21,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at it.

2928
03:26:21,284 --> 03:26:23,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Dance Dance Revolution X2 released song list update.

2929
03:26:23,805 --> 03:26:24,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are the videos?

2930
03:26:24,845 --> 03:26:25,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are they?

2931
03:26:26,205 --> 03:26:27,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep scrolling down.

2932
03:26:27,446 --> 03:26:28,326
[SPEAKER_08]: There's YouTube links.

2933
03:26:29,320 --> 03:26:30,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let me see, let me see, let me see.

2934
03:26:31,221 --> 03:26:32,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know how I'll do this.

2935
03:26:32,021 --> 03:26:33,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Control-Find, YouTube.

2936
03:26:33,902 --> 03:26:34,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Aha!

2937
03:26:34,963 --> 03:26:36,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Video with intro of X2.

2938
03:26:36,183 --> 03:26:36,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want that.

2939
03:26:37,604 --> 03:26:38,164
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot.

2940
03:26:39,205 --> 03:26:47,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them are, the quality on some of them is a little... Oh, God!

2941
03:26:47,108 --> 03:26:48,449
[SPEAKER_03]: The interface looks like Universe 3.

2942
03:26:48,589 --> 03:26:48,849
[SPEAKER_03]: What in...

2943
03:26:58,891 --> 03:27:04,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the backgrounds look cute.

2944
03:27:05,856 --> 03:27:07,277
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like your run's really smooth.

2945
03:27:08,398 --> 03:27:12,321
[SPEAKER_08]: You should be happy that they brought back Captain Jack in this one, so now you can play this again.

2946
03:27:14,163 --> 03:27:15,624
[SPEAKER_03]: How about a different Captain Jack song?

2947
03:27:15,664 --> 03:27:17,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I agree with SSJ100, Matt.

2948
03:27:17,205 --> 03:27:21,368
[SPEAKER_08]: The original one hasn't made an appearance as extreme, and that's all you can say?

2949
03:27:21,508 --> 03:27:25,792
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like eight years absent from a DDR mix.

2950
03:27:26,397 --> 03:27:28,038
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was in a DDR mix.

2951
03:27:28,058 --> 03:27:28,959
[SPEAKER_03]: How about a new Captain Jackson?

2952
03:27:28,979 --> 03:27:32,201
[SPEAKER_08]: But it hasn't been in a DDR mix in almost eight years.

2953
03:27:32,281 --> 03:27:32,981
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, all right.

2954
03:27:33,282 --> 03:27:34,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's been hard to obtain that license.

2955
03:27:35,283 --> 03:27:35,703
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

2956
03:27:35,723 --> 03:27:38,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and my fat ass hasn't played DDR in about the same time.

2957
03:27:38,265 --> 03:27:40,206
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I'm letting you go, Zaku.

2958
03:27:40,286 --> 03:27:41,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one, okay?

2959
03:27:41,767 --> 03:27:42,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, have a good one too.

2960
03:27:42,607 --> 03:27:44,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care.

2961
03:27:44,789 --> 03:27:47,090
[SPEAKER_03]: 877-GAME-OLR, his name on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

2962
03:27:47,150 --> 03:27:49,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma in our chat says, holy shit, DDRX2 has Super Driver.

2963
03:27:49,851 --> 03:27:50,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was that song I was playing.

2964
03:27:51,292 --> 03:27:52,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Right there, Super Driver.

2965
03:27:54,954 --> 03:27:59,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently it has like Cascada and all these other cute little songs in there.

2966
03:27:59,876 --> 03:28:01,697
[SPEAKER_03]: 877-GAME-OLR, his name on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

2967
03:28:01,717 --> 03:28:02,778
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really not getting any calls.

2968
03:28:02,858 --> 03:28:04,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, is it time to end the show?

2969
03:28:05,279 --> 03:28:06,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, oh, it might be.

2970
03:28:06,220 --> 03:28:07,480
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost like 10 o'clock already.

2971
03:28:08,001 --> 03:28:08,821
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that is going to do it for this.

2972
03:28:08,841 --> 03:28:11,022
[SPEAKER_10]: People are ready for sleep, and some people have to work tomorrow.

2973
03:28:11,062 --> 03:28:13,204
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're ready for the skyplanes, or done with the skyplanes.

2974
03:28:13,384 --> 03:28:13,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Not me.

2975
03:28:14,284 --> 03:28:14,645
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

2976
03:28:16,606 --> 03:28:16,906
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

2977
03:28:16,926 --> 03:28:22,469
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to wrap things up here and be on our way out of here tonight, but thank you guys for tuning in tonight.

2978
03:28:23,270 --> 03:28:25,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, though, quickly if we have any other last-minute stories, Loki.

2979
03:28:27,546 --> 03:28:29,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

2980
03:28:49,443 --> 03:28:52,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought because we can't end the show until we get the final thoughts.

2981
03:28:52,925 --> 03:28:56,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew Nami, thanks for being here again and hope you had fun.

2982
03:28:57,027 --> 03:28:58,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Expect me over here more often.

2983
03:28:58,987 --> 03:28:59,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too much so.

2984
03:28:59,768 --> 03:29:00,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a break once in a while.

2985
03:29:00,788 --> 03:29:01,749
[SPEAKER_03]: It's our show, damn it.

2986
03:29:01,849 --> 03:29:02,349
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

2987
03:29:03,329 --> 03:29:04,170
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome whenever you want.

2988
03:29:04,190 --> 03:29:05,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Next time you have to wear the Mickey hat.

2989
03:29:06,131 --> 03:29:09,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a final thought for us tonight?

2990
03:29:10,913 --> 03:29:11,933
[SPEAKER_02]: My mind is a blank.

2991
03:29:12,513 --> 03:29:14,054
[SPEAKER_02]: We have more to come next week though.

2992
03:29:14,594 --> 03:29:15,715
[SPEAKER_02]: I have more ideas.

2993
03:29:16,436 --> 03:29:22,727
[SPEAKER_03]: you were telling me can I just say we were talking about OnLive and how that's out but nobody here has really played it yet

2994
03:29:22,918 --> 03:29:27,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's been really kind of under the radar and a lot of people consider it to be vaporware.

2995
03:29:27,121 --> 03:29:28,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that can be your little task.

2996
03:29:29,402 --> 03:29:29,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.

2997
03:29:29,823 --> 03:29:30,183
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2998
03:29:30,223 --> 03:29:30,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Task.

2999
03:29:31,964 --> 03:29:33,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Something before DarkSakura gets to her final thought.

3000
03:29:33,945 --> 03:29:36,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I meant to bring this up during housekeeping and I completely forgot.

3001
03:29:37,188 --> 03:29:39,749
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe you're still going, but I know I am for sure.

3002
03:29:39,809 --> 03:29:41,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Saturday, California Extreme.

3003
03:29:41,310 --> 03:29:41,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yes.

3004
03:29:42,231 --> 03:29:45,293
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've had chatters ask, when are you ever going to California Extreme?

3005
03:29:45,313 --> 03:29:46,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Because years and years, like it's been going.

3006
03:29:47,214 --> 03:29:49,396
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been to California Extreme all the last couple years.

3007
03:29:49,536 --> 03:29:50,196
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been.

3008
03:29:50,637 --> 03:29:51,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you go last year?

3009
03:29:51,377 --> 03:29:52,778
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't think you went last year or the year before.

3010
03:29:53,038 --> 03:29:55,101
[SPEAKER_12]: I went last year and I went the year before and I went the year before that.

3011
03:29:55,381 --> 03:29:57,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're both going to be there this Saturday.

3012
03:29:57,584 --> 03:29:59,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadly, Loki's got a pregnant wife so he can't go.

3013
03:29:59,747 --> 03:30:00,548
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're going to both go.

3014
03:30:00,568 --> 03:30:01,489
[SPEAKER_12]: Carpool, come with us.

3015
03:30:01,909 --> 03:30:05,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't because I go early to spend boyfriend time.

3016
03:30:05,334 --> 03:30:06,996
[SPEAKER_03]: But you guys will have fun.

3017
03:30:07,016 --> 03:30:07,576
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll meet up there.

3018
03:30:07,677 --> 03:30:09,459
[SPEAKER_12]: We are also meeting Mel and Melody.

3019
03:30:09,761 --> 03:30:25,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, I hope to meet up with them too, so we'll have fun So we're not like participating in the show or anything We're going as spectators just like the rest of you But we'll be around There will be write-ups on both Orange Jones Radio and on Geek Life There may even be some vlogging

3020
03:30:26,218 --> 03:30:50,284
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll see also I just want to throw out there though follow us on Twitter twitter.com slash OLR because if you want to meet up with us at the show that's where we'll be posting updates because I don't even know what's at the show or what the layout's like it's in Santa Clara now oh really if we're going to do a meet up so it's not even at the convention center I'm used to if we're going to do a meet up we'll have to tweet something also it's more expensive to pre-register

3021
03:30:51,400 --> 03:30:52,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Redone Donkey Kong

3022
03:31:16,349 --> 03:31:17,950
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a new Donkey Kong project.

3023
03:31:17,970 --> 03:31:18,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Donkey Kong 2.

3024
03:31:20,430 --> 03:31:25,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.

3025
03:31:26,872 --> 03:31:29,193
[SPEAKER_12]: I want pie or a milkshake.

3026
03:31:29,773 --> 03:31:30,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Or both.

3027
03:31:30,493 --> 03:31:31,613
[SPEAKER_12]: I blame Loki for that.

3028
03:31:32,513 --> 03:31:34,234
[SPEAKER_12]: But I really want something sweet.

3029
03:31:35,799 --> 03:31:36,640
[SPEAKER_03]: What is in a mango?

3030
03:31:37,240 --> 03:31:41,541
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is I'm going to want more Tylenol in about 30 minutes.

3031
03:31:42,182 --> 03:31:42,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some.

3032
03:31:42,962 --> 03:31:43,802
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I have some too.

3033
03:31:45,023 --> 03:31:45,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Issues.

3034
03:31:46,883 --> 03:31:47,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your final thought.

3035
03:31:50,365 --> 03:31:51,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to paint more of the room.

3036
03:31:52,365 --> 03:31:52,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

3037
03:31:53,706 --> 03:32:01,769
[SPEAKER_12]: I did think of you because I found more Mario things that people have made online.

3038
03:32:02,625 --> 03:32:03,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

3039
03:32:04,326 --> 03:32:09,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Nellie was supposed to be posting pictures online of the progress I've made, but she has failed to do that.

3040
03:32:09,989 --> 03:32:11,490
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to make the hamper for you.

3041
03:32:12,091 --> 03:32:12,571
[SPEAKER_04]: The hamper?

3042
03:32:12,931 --> 03:32:13,171
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

3043
03:32:14,432 --> 03:32:15,213
[SPEAKER_03]: The diaper hamper?

3044
03:32:16,153 --> 03:32:17,634
[SPEAKER_03]: The poop warp pipe?

3045
03:32:18,975 --> 03:32:19,555
[SPEAKER_12]: The warp pipe.

3046
03:32:19,955 --> 03:32:20,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

3047
03:32:21,837 --> 03:32:23,318
[SPEAKER_12]: I have an idea that I've drawn up.

3048
03:32:23,378 --> 03:32:24,898
[SPEAKER_12]: I just have to find the sketchbook I put it in.

3049
03:32:24,918 --> 03:32:25,539
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

3050
