00:00:10,267 --> 00:00:24,621
[SPEAKER_10]: Sky, and Loki Tonight, July 25th, 2010 Worlds collide in two new fighting games announced at Comic Con Independent games are set to come to home And Rock Band 3 gets a release date

2
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:41,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello my friends out there all over the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:47,928
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be with you over the next few hours with my awesome co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

4
00:00:48,188 --> 00:00:48,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi!

5
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:49,569
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing?

6
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:51,150
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm amused.

7
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I made that sound like it was all one name.

8
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:54,332
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:54,352 --> 00:00:57,453
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's actually DarkSakura is your online name and then Jamie Summers is your name name.

10
00:00:57,794 --> 00:00:58,354
[SPEAKER_07]: My stage name.

11
00:00:58,394 --> 00:00:59,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Your stage name.

12
00:00:59,455 --> 00:00:59,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

13
00:00:59,995 --> 00:01:01,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Now why are you amused tonight?

14
00:01:01,296 --> 00:01:08,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm looking at ThatWillBuffOut.com, which is part of the Fail Network or the I Love Cheeseburger Network.

15
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that really all by the same people?

16
00:01:10,022 --> 00:01:10,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it makes sense.

17
00:01:10,903 --> 00:01:14,166
[SPEAKER_02]: How much money do those guys have?

18
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:20,213
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea, but this one, and I'll link it in the chat room, this one pictures of a car wearing panties.

19
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:22,756
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great!

20
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:25,840
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to point out what awesome radio you looking at pictures makes.

21
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:28,824
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, I'm, I'm, um, I...

22
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:32,225
[SPEAKER_07]: I am here, my stitches are out.

23
00:01:34,326 --> 00:01:39,009
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're still on vitamin V. I am on the V. I'm hyped up on the V. Bike it in!

24
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:39,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.

25
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Because my hand still has a hole in it.

26
00:01:43,151 --> 00:01:45,632
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a part that the stitches didn't clear up all the way.

27
00:01:46,252 --> 00:01:48,233
[SPEAKER_07]: So I put pictures on Facebook to show my mommy.

28
00:01:49,353 --> 00:01:51,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is why I put them on Facebook, is to show my mommy.

29
00:01:52,795 --> 00:01:57,157
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm still quite bandaged up, although not to the extent I was last time.

30
00:01:57,497 --> 00:01:58,518
[SPEAKER_07]: And it hurts us, Rob.

31
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,018
[SPEAKER_07]: It hurts us.

32
00:01:59,218 --> 00:01:59,599
[SPEAKER_02]: TechMasterLoki

33
00:02:16,558 --> 00:02:18,539
[SPEAKER_02]: What's new in Loki's world?

34
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:20,999
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys finished the nursery, right?

35
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not finished.

36
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,180
[SPEAKER_07]: He's been inhaling a lot of paint fumes.

37
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,662
[SPEAKER_05]: We have just very few things left to do on it.

38
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:29,102
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty much done.

39
00:02:29,142 --> 00:02:31,763
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the finishing touches, I guess.

40
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:35,024
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to shade the hills or put a little highlight on them.

41
00:02:35,604 --> 00:02:42,106
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had to mix some paint with this blending medium stuff to make it very transparent.

42
00:02:42,626 --> 00:03:03,622
[SPEAKER_05]: and then I have to paint one more hill and just like some small stuff but it's basically done I would have taken more pictures but Nellie said that you know I shouldn't take any more pictures until it's done because it ruins the wow effect all right well we'll be waiting to be wowed it won't be as much of an epic mount all right

43
00:03:04,483 --> 00:03:07,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's also introduce, we do have a special guest here in studio.

44
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:08,747
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been having a lot of extra people in studio lately.

45
00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:09,387
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good thing.

46
00:03:09,427 --> 00:03:11,889
[SPEAKER_02]: We like having another person here to kind of mix things up a little bit.

47
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight is somebody you've heard over the past few episodes.

48
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:17,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello to Salacious Pop.

49
00:03:17,474 --> 00:03:17,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

50
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:18,435
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?

51
00:03:18,735 --> 00:03:19,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm great.

52
00:03:19,456 --> 00:03:20,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we even hear you tonight?

53
00:03:21,638 --> 00:03:21,938
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

54
00:03:22,218 --> 00:03:22,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we hearing you?

55
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:23,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Test, test.

56
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:24,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're hearing you.

57
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:24,940
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just kind of quiet.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

59
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:26,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be afraid.

60
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:29,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Just treat that microphone like it's ice cream.

61
00:03:29,604 --> 00:03:30,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, there you go.

62
00:03:30,785 --> 00:03:32,267
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what's new in your world?

63
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:32,687
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing?

64
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:34,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Not much.

65
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Got some new games for my birthday that I'll be talking about that I've been playing.

66
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:38,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

67
00:03:38,943 --> 00:03:39,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.

68
00:03:39,564 --> 00:03:40,847
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll get to those in a little bit.

69
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:48,474
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those that may not know, you have the unique distinction of also being my boyfriend, to which I'm sure a lot of the listeners are like, oh, that poor guy.

70
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:52,037
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so we went out last night, actually.

71
00:03:52,077 --> 00:03:54,279
[SPEAKER_02]: We went to see Adam Lambert in concert.

72
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:55,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we did.

73
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of gays.

74
00:03:57,081 --> 00:03:57,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

75
00:03:57,661 --> 00:03:58,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right?

76
00:03:58,222 --> 00:03:58,862
[SPEAKER_02]: No, here's the thing.

77
00:03:58,902 --> 00:04:00,103
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean, is he any good?

78
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:04,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I just remember like, oh, I hope he wins because I don't like the other person.

79
00:04:04,146 --> 00:04:05,207
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he lost.

80
00:04:05,615 --> 00:04:07,077
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

81
00:04:21,691 --> 00:04:23,793
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of feel bad, but that's just the kind of person my mom is.

82
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:26,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Once she kind of makes her mind up, there ain't no changing it.

83
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:30,638
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went instead with some other friends, and I don't know.

84
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:34,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was fine, but it was weird that people were getting into a fight.

85
00:04:35,062 --> 00:04:35,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

86
00:04:35,402 --> 00:04:36,383
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think of the concert?

87
00:04:37,516 --> 00:04:38,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to paint his hair.

88
00:04:54,212 --> 00:04:54,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say he won me over.

89
00:04:55,273 --> 00:04:56,173
[SPEAKER_02]: His wig, I'm sure.

90
00:04:56,573 --> 00:04:57,253
[SPEAKER_02]: That can't be real.

91
00:04:58,194 --> 00:04:59,854
[SPEAKER_02]: His do can't be real.

92
00:04:59,914 --> 00:05:01,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell the listeners real quick about the fight.

93
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:02,516
[SPEAKER_02]: We will get to video games, I promise.

94
00:05:02,876 --> 00:05:10,479
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were up in the bleachers, way in the back, and about three rows in front of us, off to the left, a fight.

95
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:15,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not a real fight, but these ladies were dancing and standing up and having a good time.

96
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:16,081
[SPEAKER_03]: We call them glamas.

97
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:17,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, glamas.

98
00:05:17,602 --> 00:05:21,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Were standing up dancing, as one would at a rock concert.

99
00:05:21,563 --> 00:05:31,985
[SPEAKER_03]: and this sort of drunk, resentful husband who was probably dragged there by his wife really took offense to the fact that they were standing and he decided to call them out and get really belligerent.

100
00:05:32,025 --> 00:05:36,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you need to know the crowd was totally like the real housewives of Sacramento County.

101
00:05:36,606 --> 00:05:38,967
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Dina Lohan's all over, wherever you look.

102
00:05:39,127 --> 00:05:45,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I think on the Venn diagram of shame, there's definitely some overlap between Adam Lambert fans and like Twi moms.

103
00:05:46,188 --> 00:05:49,109
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there are a lot of, yeah, quite a bit.

104
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,904
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to watch Security come in.

105
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:55,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Security gave them a stern talking to.

106
00:05:57,007 --> 00:05:59,048
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a point where I was like, am I serious?

107
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:02,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've gone to a lot of concerts before, and I've never seen a fight.

108
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,152
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, am I really going to see people throw down at Adam Lambert?

109
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:07,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this real life?

110
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:09,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's pretty surreal.

111
00:06:10,054 --> 00:06:10,535
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

112
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,731
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

113
00:06:47,848 --> 00:06:52,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Wheel of Fortune slot machine, and it's not like, I mean, there's been Wheel of Fortune slot machines for years.

114
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:52,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's big.

115
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:55,332
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's this- Like the huge, mongous, wall-sized one?

116
00:06:55,392 --> 00:06:55,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

117
00:06:55,853 --> 00:06:56,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

118
00:06:56,313 --> 00:06:58,114
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like Derby Owner's Club to me.

119
00:06:58,714 --> 00:07:03,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, remember- No, I thought you were talking about, like, the five-cent, the nickel slots where they had, like, the giant wheel that spins.

120
00:07:03,637 --> 00:07:13,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, there's that, too, but now there's one with a giant monitor, and I guess the bonus round on that one, you touch letters to complete the puzzle on the giant board, and it's multiple players doing it at once.

121
00:07:13,143 --> 00:07:13,503
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.

122
00:07:13,523 --> 00:07:13,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

123
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:18,946
[SPEAKER_03]: They have Vanna White, like, the real Vanna White, doing record, like, she's the bumpers between rounds.

124
00:07:19,046 --> 00:07:20,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, good luck, everybody.

125
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:22,028
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really her in HD.

126
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:23,008
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very creepy.

127
00:07:23,088 --> 00:07:25,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's also creepy, like, isn't she, like, 80 years old?

128
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,691
[SPEAKER_02]: And she still looks like she's, like, 30.

129
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:29,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, she's made a pact with the devil, clearly.

130
00:07:29,592 --> 00:07:30,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Plastic surgery.

131
00:07:31,573 --> 00:07:41,399
[SPEAKER_05]: She's just using, you know, some different cosmetics from Umbrella Corporation, you know, to keep her cells nice and rejuvenated.

132
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:43,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you've seen that movie Death Becomes Her?

133
00:07:43,934 --> 00:07:44,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

134
00:07:44,054 --> 00:07:44,876
[SPEAKER_07]: She's made of porcelain.

135
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:45,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

136
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:46,559
[SPEAKER_07]: She's ceramic.

137
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:53,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I did have to talk to one lady though in the casino because she had her sign with her that said, I'm 70 and I love Adam.

138
00:07:54,144 --> 00:07:56,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Because she reminded me of my mom because my mom's also just about 70.

139
00:07:57,045 --> 00:07:57,185
[SPEAKER_02]: She's 69.

140
00:07:57,945 --> 00:07:59,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, okay, enough Adam.

141
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:03,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear that is like the most Adam Lambert chat you will ever hear on Orange Lounge Radio.

142
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:04,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.

143
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,107
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do talk about video games.

144
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:07,328
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get into those in just a minute.

145
00:08:07,368 --> 00:08:08,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to go to our chat room though.

146
00:08:08,668 --> 00:08:09,428
[SPEAKER_02]: We love the chatters.

147
00:08:09,668 --> 00:08:15,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com They're always here with us every Sunday night as we do tape live at All Games Radio.

148
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:38,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, www.allgames.com Right after the Bobby Blackwolf show And of course, big, major, massive, super props to Bobby Blackwolf Who just turned 5 years old this week He can get a kindergarten His show, not him, his show Alright, and actually it was his 5 year of podcasting Because I think he had like a life through his 5 things like we used to have

149
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:39,539
[SPEAKER_07]: This is gaming related.

150
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,420
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to stop with the pictures.

151
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm going to leave this one in the chat room.

152
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:43,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it away.

153
00:08:43,782 --> 00:08:44,702
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm leaving this in the chat room.

154
00:08:44,943 --> 00:08:47,424
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, link it in the chat room so that way our live chatters can see it.

155
00:08:47,464 --> 00:08:51,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, those listening on the podcast, well, it's just more incentive to join us live.

156
00:08:51,647 --> 00:08:53,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly, that's why I do this.

157
00:08:53,837 --> 00:08:54,678
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

158
00:09:22,153 --> 00:09:23,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the new one here in Roseville.

159
00:09:23,293 --> 00:09:25,054
[SPEAKER_07]: It's tiny and loud.

160
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:25,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, loud.

161
00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:30,296
[SPEAKER_07]: But we played this tank game.

162
00:09:30,376 --> 00:09:31,716
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a Namco tank game.

163
00:09:31,776 --> 00:09:33,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember what it's called.

164
00:09:33,757 --> 00:09:34,757
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was pretty fun.

165
00:09:35,217 --> 00:09:36,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, your mic is totally cut out.

166
00:09:36,478 --> 00:09:40,779
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta check the... I think the connection is weird.

167
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:41,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry guys, live radio.

168
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:43,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie's mic is doing weird stuff.

169
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:46,280
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

170
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:06,371
[SPEAKER_07]: I really need a new blender, apparently.

171
00:10:09,355 --> 00:10:12,039
[SPEAKER_07]: We did this Typhoon thing, which is more like a ride.

172
00:10:13,281 --> 00:10:17,166
[SPEAKER_07]: They do a minecart one.

173
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you guys switch?

174
00:10:19,128 --> 00:10:20,070
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what's going on with that mic.

175
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, is this?

176
00:10:21,211 --> 00:10:21,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, I'm loud.

177
00:10:21,752 --> 00:10:22,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's much better.

178
00:10:22,512 --> 00:10:23,093
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, go ahead.

179
00:10:23,614 --> 00:10:26,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so we played the tank game that Namco did.

180
00:10:26,176 --> 00:10:31,462
[SPEAKER_07]: We played this Typhoon thing, which is like a bunch of different rides all in one.

181
00:10:32,183 --> 00:10:36,047
[SPEAKER_07]: And we did a pinball one, which was kind of throws you around a pinball game.

182
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:37,769
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pretty cool because, of course, we had to do pinball.

183
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,192
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we...

184
00:10:44,464 --> 00:10:56,414
[SPEAKER_07]: I played more token stuff and then I started playing Ragnarok online again because it's easier to do with my hand being kind of messed up.

185
00:10:56,874 --> 00:11:00,378
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did play some Star Trek online and I'm at Captain 8 now.

186
00:11:01,438 --> 00:11:03,000
[SPEAKER_02]: What exactly does Captain 8 mean?

187
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:08,534
[SPEAKER_07]: It means that I've got two more levels until I'm a rear admiral, pretty much.

188
00:11:09,154 --> 00:11:11,035
[SPEAKER_02]: So are those like levels in other MMOs?

189
00:11:11,075 --> 00:11:11,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

190
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:16,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, because like you start off, because you know, they're set up like a military organization.

191
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:17,100
[SPEAKER_07]: They go by rank.

192
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,542
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you've got divisions in each rank, so...

193
00:11:20,702 --> 00:11:21,804
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm getting up there.

194
00:11:22,444 --> 00:11:31,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I found out that while a lot of the earlier missions are lame, the upper captain level and admiral level missions are really freaking fun.

195
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:34,015
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've been having a good time.

196
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:45,045
[SPEAKER_07]: It's especially funny watching, although I've had such a hard time playing when I've just taken my Vicodin, because then I totally focus on one thing when I'm on Vicodin.

197
00:11:45,445 --> 00:12:04,707
[SPEAKER_07]: it's like I have instead of ADD I have like hyper focus disorder or something and get fixated on one major thing at a time so it's really kind of hard to multitask hence me looking at all these pictures during the show and not being able to look away from them I don't know what you're talking about

198
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:11,560
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

199
00:12:38,835 --> 00:12:40,656
[SPEAKER_07]: and you have to find the golden suit.

200
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,276
[SPEAKER_07]: It's this really bizarre little game.

201
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:49,378
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awfully cutesy and I was surprised that Dan suggested it to me to play.

202
00:12:49,878 --> 00:12:51,419
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's really fun.

203
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:56,760
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been playing a little bit of that and trying to go back and play Oendan except I'm right-handed.

204
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,541
[SPEAKER_07]: My stitches are on my right hand.

205
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:01,581
[SPEAKER_07]: My incision is on my right hand.

206
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,742
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can't play Oendan very well.

207
00:13:03,802 --> 00:13:05,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially, again, when I'm on Vicodin.

208
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:07,283
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

209
00:13:07,782 --> 00:13:15,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta tell you guys before the show I said something and Jamie flipped me off and it actually put her in pain because she's like I haven't flipped anyone off since I had my surgery.

210
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:36,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob's the first person I flipped off and because the whole thing is that my flexibility is coming back in my hand and I can make a sort of fist and I can sort of extend it except I can't apparently make a fist and extend a finger at the same time because then it hurts and it made me want to cry and I blame Rob because Rob evoked the finger.

211
00:13:37,788 --> 00:13:38,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I play other stuff.

212
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:38,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

213
00:13:53,618 --> 00:14:11,577
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember Vitamin V is taking effect everybody I played Mahjong before class on my netbook and I found that my SNES 9X emulator works very well for Linux on my netbook so I can play Super Nintendo games before class

214
00:14:11,986 --> 00:14:40,270
[SPEAKER_02]: you should check out the Castlevania puzzle game that just came out on iPhone cause although it looked really weird from the screenshots I've been hearing a lot of good things about it I just picked it up actually cause I had $40 worth of iTunes credit for my birthday from various gift cards so I picked it up cause it was like 4 or 5 bucks I don't remember and it just kind of made me think of you cause I know you're a big Castlevania fan girl and you like puzzle games too I was wanting to play it but I I almost downloaded the Silent Hill game and no no the Silent Hill game is junk it's on my phone if you want to play it it's not that great

215
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,232
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a first person thing.

216
00:14:42,292 --> 00:14:47,336
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like the actual Silent Hill games at all.

217
00:14:47,897 --> 00:14:58,487
[SPEAKER_07]: We've also been redoing The Vault, Dan and I. I decided this and he better go along with it or else that we're going to play through Sonic Adventure.

218
00:15:00,268 --> 00:15:02,611
[SPEAKER_02]: I like how you have the dual TVs all set up in there.

219
00:15:02,671 --> 00:15:03,351
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what they were?

220
00:15:03,832 --> 00:15:05,313
[SPEAKER_07]: They were Xbox...

221
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:10,047
[SPEAKER_02]: monitors from kiosks.

222
00:15:10,128 --> 00:15:13,228
[SPEAKER_02]: From certain stores' kiosks.

223
00:15:13,768 --> 00:15:15,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan was just told that he could take everything.

224
00:15:15,508 --> 00:15:23,250
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've got broken Xboxes and broken Wiis and semi-working Wiis and a bunch of cables and those monitors and crap.

225
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,350
[SPEAKER_07]: He's putting them to proper use in the vault.

226
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,651
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll post pictures of the vault in progress.

227
00:15:29,771 --> 00:15:31,031
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I'll go do that right now.

228
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:35,472
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to find the name of that game because it's going to bother the crap out of me until I figure it out.

229
00:15:35,672 --> 00:15:39,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so when Jamie runs in here and yells something completely random, that's the aim.

230
00:15:39,774 --> 00:15:41,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

231
00:15:42,215 --> 00:15:43,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you have to stop looking at pictures.

232
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:45,156
[SPEAKER_02]: What are those, SD cards?

233
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you SD card shopping?

234
00:15:46,056 --> 00:15:50,939
[SPEAKER_05]: It's compact flash cards, and yes, I am shopping for compact flash cards.

235
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:56,882
[SPEAKER_05]: for something I'm working on because I can't go without having six projects at one time.

236
00:15:57,163 --> 00:16:04,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I did cancel one project because I don't really give a crap about making it, you know, a cardboard arcade cabinet anymore.

237
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,028
[SPEAKER_05]: What project?

238
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:05,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the cardboard.

239
00:16:05,528 --> 00:16:06,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, a project under $100 may...

240
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to interject I want to interject

241
00:16:34,511 --> 00:16:35,554
[SPEAKER_05]: What were you interjecting?

242
00:16:35,574 --> 00:16:37,939
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Henry Hatsworth and the Puzzling Adventure.

243
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:38,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

244
00:16:40,244 --> 00:16:40,906
[SPEAKER_05]: I could have told you that.

245
00:16:44,784 --> 00:16:51,470
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, what I'm working on right now, my friend gave me one of these old, I don't even know what they are.

246
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:54,874
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, remember those Tiger Electronics games and stuff?

247
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:58,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Not necessarily like Game & Watch, but something similar to that.

248
00:16:59,338 --> 00:17:00,959
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a Frogger game.

249
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,826
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's set up inside of what looks like a bar top arcade cabinet, except it's just plastic and it's really tiny.

250
00:17:08,446 --> 00:17:16,008
[SPEAKER_05]: and I was looking at it and I'm like, because the first thing that comes to my mind for anything, it's like, I wonder if I could put an arcade game inside this thing.

251
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:21,650
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, I've kind of challenged myself to do that for no apparent reason whatsoever.

252
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen that before, like the little bit.

253
00:17:24,131 --> 00:17:27,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all the... It's kind of like an LED game, but it's in color.

254
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:28,674
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's Frogger.

255
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:29,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've seen one of those before.

256
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't they like all red or all orange or something?

257
00:17:31,796 --> 00:17:32,517
[SPEAKER_03]: I know they're monochrome.

258
00:17:32,537 --> 00:17:33,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all of them.

259
00:17:33,337 --> 00:17:34,898
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen ones that are multiple colors.

260
00:17:34,918 --> 00:17:37,640
[SPEAKER_05]: They have just like an overlay on them that gives them the colors.

261
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,001
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's basically that.

262
00:17:39,521 --> 00:17:44,564
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I would be doing is I'd be ripping out the guts of the inside of whatever this thing is.

263
00:17:44,784 --> 00:17:58,173
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd actually probably be using the joystick that's on there, not really even replacing any of the buttons, but just wiring them up to some sort of like iPack type thing, probably a mini pack, and then running that through, which I just bought.

264
00:17:58,513 --> 00:18:09,500
[SPEAKER_05]: because I bid sniped someone and won an auction for a Nano ITX PC, which they're really small, but it's actually a little big for what I need it to be put in.

265
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,481
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got to put the board in at an angle and hopefully that fits.

266
00:18:12,742 --> 00:18:13,542
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.

267
00:18:13,662 --> 00:18:14,943
[SPEAKER_05]: So that'll be fun.

268
00:18:15,523 --> 00:18:16,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, I'll use it for something else.

269
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:19,626
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have a three and a half inch...

270
00:18:21,787 --> 00:18:23,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Mini Mame Mini Mame

271
00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:46,640
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

272
00:19:06,554 --> 00:19:11,437
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just no one online at all playing, you know, Battle of the Gay Tony.

273
00:19:11,857 --> 00:19:16,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Not, I mean, there's more people playing that than Lost and Damned, but there's really no one playing Lost and Damned right now.

274
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:28,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, you know, I think this is about the right time to finally get those mods working, which I'm hopefully going to start working on some more once I get done painting the baby's room, which I'm very close.

275
00:19:29,005 --> 00:19:29,966
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll probably finish it this week.

276
00:19:29,986 --> 00:19:33,568
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that baby's going to get here and all your projects just got canceled.

277
00:19:33,788 --> 00:19:34,268
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they haven't.

278
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:35,969
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you think.

279
00:19:37,526 --> 00:19:39,048
[SPEAKER_05]: You are wrong, sir.

280
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:39,989
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

281
00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:44,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying Project Baby is going to take a lot of time.

282
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:46,196
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to take that much time.

283
00:19:46,236 --> 00:19:46,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Babies just sleep.

284
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:47,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I beg to differ.

285
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:51,181
[SPEAKER_05]: They sleep and then you feed them and then you poke at them and you're done.

286
00:19:51,201 --> 00:19:52,142
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to last.

287
00:19:52,203 --> 00:19:56,247
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we'll be saving this little clip and playing it for Loki a year after that kid's born.

288
00:19:56,267 --> 00:19:57,028
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see what he thinks.

289
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:02,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I'm well aware of what babies do, and yeah, they wake you up in the middle of the night and you're tired, okay?

290
00:20:02,873 --> 00:20:03,493
[SPEAKER_05]: I get that.

291
00:20:03,553 --> 00:20:10,639
[SPEAKER_05]: That does not stop me from, say, spending a few minutes here and there to build crap.

292
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:11,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

293
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,563
[SPEAKER_02]: I need gamer daddies to email the show to give Loki some advice.

294
00:20:16,564 --> 00:20:18,025
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to hear from some gamer daddies.

295
00:20:18,525 --> 00:20:18,866
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.

296
00:20:20,163 --> 00:20:24,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, I'm just saying, there's two of us, we don't need to juggle the baby.

297
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:29,268
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I will be taking care of the baby, but... Yeah, if you juggle the baby, CPS might get called.

298
00:20:29,969 --> 00:20:30,489
[SPEAKER_05]: They might.

299
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:34,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially since they can't juggle anything, so that's not good.

300
00:20:34,892 --> 00:20:37,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I'm not worried about that stuff.

301
00:20:37,273 --> 00:20:38,934
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's really going to change anything.

302
00:20:40,735 --> 00:20:42,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I have known a number of people who said that.

303
00:20:44,389 --> 00:20:45,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we'll stop picking on Loki.

304
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:46,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, come on.

305
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,391
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying that I don't think it will affect anything.

306
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:50,792
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

307
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,232
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need 80,000 projects going on at one time.

308
00:20:54,393 --> 00:20:56,354
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will find excuses to do that.

309
00:20:57,834 --> 00:21:05,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so anyways, besides all that stuff, and of course more Crackdown 2, I'm not really enjoying this game as much as the first one.

310
00:21:05,857 --> 00:21:08,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably because this game is very similar to the first one.

311
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:11,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, you know, wouldn't be so bad, but it's just...

312
00:21:13,354 --> 00:21:27,000
[SPEAKER_05]: They really kind of took away all the open world part of the game because the open world stuff is still there but my god is that guy who's the voiceover guy is such a nagging bitch.

313
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:27,860
[SPEAKER_05]: It's annoying.

314
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,421
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you should go to this rooftop race.

315
00:21:30,561 --> 00:21:31,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck that.

316
00:21:31,161 --> 00:21:33,422
[SPEAKER_05]: I will do the rooftop race when I feel like it.

317
00:21:33,522 --> 00:21:34,683
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you should do it now.

318
00:21:35,123 --> 00:21:35,963
[SPEAKER_05]: I will do it later.

319
00:21:36,203 --> 00:21:37,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it now!

320
00:21:37,224 --> 00:21:38,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you trying to piss me off?

321
00:21:39,145 --> 00:21:40,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh god, I hated that.

322
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:52,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop killing... I'll jump down and the other... Not agents, but the peacekeepers will be there and they'll get injured.

323
00:21:52,694 --> 00:21:55,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I'll blow up a car and some shrapnel will hit them.

324
00:21:55,796 --> 00:21:58,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop injuring the peacekeepers.

325
00:21:58,218 --> 00:21:59,438
[SPEAKER_05]: They're hard at work.

326
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:01,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't injure the civilians.

327
00:22:02,461 --> 00:22:03,781
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to like us.

328
00:22:04,182 --> 00:22:06,884
[SPEAKER_07]: My favorite... That peacekeeper had a wife and family.

329
00:22:07,464 --> 00:22:08,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to explain it to them?

330
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:35,244
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's dumb and even when you do piss them off they send a hit squad after you and you just go up on the rooftops and they shoot at the building because they can't figure out how to hit you and then that goes away and they're all, hope you learned your lesson I'm like, nope didn't learn my lesson I'm gonna do it again, wee yeah, it's alright, it's just I don't know maybe the announcer's the last boss

331
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:37,276
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the last boss.

332
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:03,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't that the twist in the original Metal Gear game?

333
00:23:03,993 --> 00:23:11,418
[SPEAKER_02]: That the big boss that was talking to you on the frequency thingy, he was the announcer, ended up being the last boss?

334
00:23:12,219 --> 00:23:12,639
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

335
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:14,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I don't think this guy's the last boss.

336
00:23:15,621 --> 00:23:18,423
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that the peacekeepers are evil.

337
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

338
00:23:19,904 --> 00:23:21,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone that's helping you out is evil.

339
00:23:21,505 --> 00:23:23,326
[SPEAKER_05]: That twist has been done like 80,000 times.

340
00:23:24,147 --> 00:23:29,730
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know it's a spoiler, but hey, the original Crackdown game's been out for a few years now, so too bad.

341
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:59,052
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever it doesn't matter to me but it's still fun I like playing it it's very the missions that you go on are very linear and granted that the first game the missions weren't that different but they did have some bosses that you fought granted they were very simply you just had to run up to them and roundhouse kick them a few times and they're dead but at least they had bosses

342
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:01,331
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

343
00:24:01,572 --> 00:24:03,333
[SPEAKER_05]: They could ramp up the difficulty and stuff.

344
00:24:05,174 --> 00:24:05,514
[SPEAKER_02]: They could.

345
00:24:06,235 --> 00:24:06,475
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

346
00:24:06,775 --> 00:24:08,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess that's it for Loki's Gaming Week.

347
00:24:09,137 --> 00:24:09,617
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Alan?

348
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:10,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to talk about your Gaming Week?

349
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:12,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

350
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,720
[SPEAKER_03]: How's my mic doing?

351
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:16,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're okay.

352
00:24:16,282 --> 00:24:18,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, you and Jamie should probably switch back again.

353
00:24:18,364 --> 00:24:18,724
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

354
00:24:19,144 --> 00:24:20,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I fixed hers.

355
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:21,145
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

356
00:24:21,886 --> 00:24:22,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

357
00:24:22,787 --> 00:24:23,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Bear with us, guys.

358
00:24:23,507 --> 00:24:24,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Live radio.

359
00:24:24,188 --> 00:24:24,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Want me to test?

360
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:25,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I looking okay?

361
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:26,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we can hear you now.

362
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:27,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

363
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:27,590
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

364
00:24:28,591 --> 00:24:28,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

365
00:24:28,751 --> 00:24:28,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

366
00:24:29,351 --> 00:24:34,495
[SPEAKER_03]: So my birthday was a couple weeks ago, and I picked up, or rather I got Bayonetta.

367
00:24:35,175 --> 00:24:36,116
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm finally playing that.

368
00:24:36,156 --> 00:24:37,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that came out in January.

369
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:38,377
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of fun.

370
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Been wanting to play it for a while.

371
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on the third stage.

372
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:47,883
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's pretty much, you know, Devil May Cry, but with a sexy bitch killing everybody.

373
00:24:49,124 --> 00:24:53,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Puzzle Quest 2, and I played Puzzle Quest 1 on the DS.

374
00:24:53,167 --> 00:24:58,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably have about 130 hours on my save game, so I've been playing the hell out of the second one.

375
00:24:58,567 --> 00:25:00,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, 130 hours.

376
00:25:00,048 --> 00:25:00,729
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a long game.

377
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:01,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

378
00:25:01,649 --> 00:25:03,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I pretty much grinded everything to level 99.

379
00:25:04,452 --> 00:25:05,312
[SPEAKER_03]: That was grindable.

380
00:25:05,512 --> 00:25:06,493
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very, yeah.

381
00:25:07,374 --> 00:25:09,335
[SPEAKER_03]: So Puzzle Quest 2, WoW, of course.

382
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:13,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Our guild tried to do a trial of the Crusader Ten Man.

383
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:15,300
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the hardest raid we've tried in WoW.

384
00:25:16,021 --> 00:25:17,662
[SPEAKER_03]: We got about halfway through it before we gave up.

385
00:25:18,282 --> 00:25:19,123
[SPEAKER_03]: We had progress there.

386
00:25:19,964 --> 00:25:23,947
[SPEAKER_03]: And played some Left 4 Dead and played some Alien Swarm.

387
00:25:25,968 --> 00:25:26,789
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think of Alien Swarm?

388
00:25:28,058 --> 00:25:28,458
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good.

389
00:25:28,698 --> 00:25:33,003
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the new four-player co-op game that Valve put out.

390
00:25:33,043 --> 00:25:34,104
[SPEAKER_03]: It is under the Valve name.

391
00:25:34,624 --> 00:25:39,389
[SPEAKER_03]: It's free, so whenever something is not horrible and free, it's usually worthy of a little bit of hype.

392
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,832
[SPEAKER_03]: The gameplay is basically Gauntlet.

393
00:25:43,693 --> 00:26:12,357
[SPEAKER_03]: four player top down massive enemies coming at you so it's gauntlet crossed with the movie Aliens pretty much and there's the medic, the tech, the sergeant and the special ops and you play online with friends and each person has a special role and it's a lot of fun I downloaded it so we'll have to play it was free you can't argue with free, it's two gigs so yeah anything else in your gaming week you want to share with us?

394
00:26:14,758 --> 00:26:16,560
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

395
00:26:34,471 --> 00:26:36,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

396
00:26:53,295 --> 00:26:55,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, Alien Swarm.

397
00:26:55,418 --> 00:26:57,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Free on Steam right now.

398
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,402
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really no reason not to get this game.

399
00:26:59,983 --> 00:27:00,744
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth a look.

400
00:27:00,844 --> 00:27:09,713
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not like, oh my god, like Portal awesome or something, but it's the type of game you would pay like $10 to $15 on Xbox Live Arcade.

401
00:27:10,114 --> 00:27:13,277
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels a lot like an Xbox Live Arcade game to me, but it's not.

402
00:27:13,337 --> 00:27:13,958
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a PC game.

403
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:39,149
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's very much I think Gauntlet kind of mixed with Aliens is good with a little Team Fortress 2 thrown in there because a lot of the classes kind of seem to come over from that and yeah it's fun and a lot of fun on the multiplayer so check that out I mean there's really no reason not to check out Alien Swarm unless you're like super anti-steam is about the only reason I can think of or your PC really really really blows which might be another reason

404
00:27:39,651 --> 00:27:48,276
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that I really like about Valve is that they're very involved in the mod community for Half-Life and all that stuff.

405
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:56,820
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you read the info on Alien Swarm, you will read that the developers for it are people from the mod community that Valve hired because they like their work.

406
00:27:57,081 --> 00:27:58,862
[SPEAKER_03]: So Valve actually hires out of...

407
00:28:00,002 --> 00:28:02,465
[SPEAKER_03]: The fan service projects.

408
00:28:02,585 --> 00:28:04,227
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how Alien Swarm was made.

409
00:28:04,747 --> 00:28:07,089
[SPEAKER_03]: They hired out of the mod developers.

410
00:28:16,238 --> 00:28:44,355
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah but Yaris was different like I can't explain it like Yaris really really was I think the commercial tie-in had a lot to do with that like when you pay to have a game made that's basically a giant commercial I think you're kind of set up for disaster a little bit Alien Swarm is no commercial nothing it's just I honestly I think it's again to try and get Steam on more people's computers that's that's really what it boils down to because you know since you launch Steam to play the game you're gonna get tempted into these ads where it's you know $4

411
00:28:46,076 --> 00:28:47,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

412
00:29:04,464 --> 00:29:07,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Other games I played, I also played a little bit of Team Fortress 2.

413
00:29:07,866 --> 00:29:09,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I played more than the tutorial.

414
00:29:09,107 --> 00:29:11,128
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually was playing some offline games.

415
00:29:11,168 --> 00:29:15,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not ready to fight the people online yet because I'm still scared because I'm not very good at it.

416
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,534
[SPEAKER_02]: But I found that I was doing okay as a medic.

417
00:29:19,414 --> 00:29:20,956
[SPEAKER_02]: The White Mage, which I think...

418
00:29:21,756 --> 00:29:26,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody had suggested in an email last week, and it was funny, because I said, yeah, I'll probably do the medic.

419
00:29:26,578 --> 00:29:32,060
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of a different role, because instead of just running out there like all Quake-style, just running out in the front, die!

420
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:37,001
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more, you know, you hang back with your team and actually heal people, and you can overheal.

421
00:29:37,281 --> 00:29:38,362
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of liked what they did with it.

422
00:29:38,762 --> 00:29:39,222
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.

423
00:29:39,502 --> 00:29:43,003
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm talking about all these games that are years old, because I played Left 4 Dead as well.

424
00:29:43,744 --> 00:29:45,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally got around to playing a little more of that.

425
00:29:46,224 --> 00:29:49,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan and I played a little bit together, and that was cool.

426
00:29:49,466 --> 00:29:49,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Just...

427
00:29:50,746 --> 00:29:51,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

428
00:29:51,606 --> 00:30:01,390
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of you guys have already played it, so for me to sit here and describe it after so long is probably a little ridiculous, but I guess if you haven't, just kind of imagine a first-person shooter that it takes a little bit of teamwork.

429
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:11,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously Left 4 Dead is all about teamwork, and it's about the four people that are playing, although you can have everybody else be a computer player, but it is a little more fun to play at least with people you know.

430
00:30:11,854 --> 00:30:18,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can go online and play with strangers, but it's fun when you play with people you know because then you can kind of joke and talk to each other, and Alan and I

431
00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:19,378
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

432
00:30:40,874 --> 00:30:43,998
[SPEAKER_03]: In the first one, probably the biker.

433
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:45,780
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm totally blanking on his name.

434
00:30:46,561 --> 00:30:48,523
[SPEAKER_03]: But the guy with the handlebar mustache.

435
00:30:48,843 --> 00:30:49,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's funny.

436
00:30:50,104 --> 00:30:52,667
[SPEAKER_03]: In the second one, probably the redneck because he's so stupid.

437
00:30:53,328 --> 00:30:53,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, very cool.

438
00:30:55,533 --> 00:31:23,425
[SPEAKER_02]: as far as other games I played this week, Puzzle Quest 2 gosh, almost the same games as Alan played this week, I don't know if there's anything unique I played that he didn't play Game Room, I don't think you really play Game Room, I play a little bit of that another one of my old favorite Activision classics Frostbite is scheduled for release this week, that was kind of a Frostbite is kind of like a ghetto frogger, really really ghetto frogger, so I'll be checking that out because I have fond childhood memories of that one

439
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's going to do it for our gaming week.

440
00:31:27,069 --> 00:31:30,073
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to get into the news and everything that's going on in the gaming world.

441
00:31:30,373 --> 00:31:32,536
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, we're going to do some housekeeping real quick.

442
00:31:32,556 --> 00:31:34,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to bring you guys up to speed on The Big Battle.

443
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:40,847
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of going on all summer long at thebigbattle.net I think it's also available at bigbattle.allgames.com

444
00:31:42,088 --> 00:31:43,649
[SPEAKER_02]: TheBigBattle.net works just fine

445
00:32:01,497 --> 00:32:06,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Listeners of the shows, not necessarily the hosts, although I try to participate on at least games I own.

446
00:32:06,542 --> 00:32:10,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Listeners of the shows play their favorite games against listeners of other shows.

447
00:32:10,565 --> 00:32:13,068
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just kind of like a big tournament type of thing.

448
00:32:13,908 --> 00:32:15,670
[SPEAKER_02]: High scores and leaderboards and all that.

449
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,612
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they're doing one tonight.

450
00:32:17,792 --> 00:32:18,112
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if...

451
00:32:19,093 --> 00:32:19,574
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

452
00:32:41,872 --> 00:32:58,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Riptide did very well there too AZHP made a showing and then we also made a showing on the Forza Motorsport 3 competition one of our listeners, I think just one charted over there Burr charted for us over there so he came in 6th place but that's certainly better than nothing

453
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:26,327
[SPEAKER_02]: so um a very good job by Burr over there so we really appreciate that uh some things that are coming up in the near future Super Street Fighter 4 Trials HD and Shatter have both been announced as well so Super Street Fighter 4 I'm very excited about that one uh so we'll be checking those out a lot of you guys have been requesting other types of games PC games is one I've gotten a request for so I don't know how you might be able to do like a Team Fortress 2 battle but I'll try to look into it and see if we can get maybe Derek to schedule something like that that'd be cool

454
00:33:26,747 --> 00:33:26,987
[SPEAKER_02]: BigBattle.net

455
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:53,653
[SPEAKER_02]: or I should say not in the actual Journey game but in a Journey-like game.

456
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:58,740
[SPEAKER_02]: So he actually has started it and he's chronicling it in a little web series called Project Journey.

457
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,225
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's actually little screenshots of me in like a breakout kind of game.

458
00:34:03,265 --> 00:34:03,666
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

459
00:34:04,046 --> 00:34:08,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious to see how this turns out yet scared all at once.

460
00:34:08,942 --> 00:34:11,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so excited, I'm so excited I'm so scared

461
00:34:29,915 --> 00:34:40,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we'll talk a little bit about Kinect and some of the stuff that was kind of rumored that we kind of figured was true, but it is true.

462
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:42,119
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see.

463
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:51,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, they announced that one of the things that was rumored that there's going to be a new Xbox 360 arcade system coming out this fall.

464
00:34:51,683 --> 00:34:52,903
[SPEAKER_05]: There is going to be a new one.

465
00:34:53,103 --> 00:34:53,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's...

466
00:34:54,824 --> 00:35:01,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Bundled with a 4GB internal memory unit, kind of like how they were doing with the old arcade systems.

467
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:04,610
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's kind of neat.

468
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:13,935
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, you can put your own hard drive in there just like you can with the new S systems or whatever you want to call them.

469
00:35:14,135 --> 00:35:17,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Or use the USB because I think a lot of people are now using USB sticks.

470
00:35:17,477 --> 00:35:22,940
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also use USB sticks as well in there because there's plenty of USB ports on there now.

471
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:23,881
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's kind of cool.

472
00:35:24,924 --> 00:35:25,737
[SPEAKER_05]: and um

473
00:35:27,256 --> 00:35:56,390
[SPEAKER_05]: yes and then also of course they're going to be doing a new oh and I'm sorry that will be bundled with Kinect that $300 one and of course there's also going to be a new just plain arcade system for $200 that's going to be coming out in August as well so that's kind of neat that they're going to be doing that I mean alternatives are wonderful Kinect is going to be priced at $150 as if all those retail listings you know

474
00:35:58,455 --> 00:36:25,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft's own website taking pre-orders didn't give it away yeah that's such an interesting price there didn't call that it does come with a free game which I may have hinted at before the free game is Connect Adventures kind of like their little Wii Play type game so that'll be bundled within of course for $150 and should be coming out well November 4th

475
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:33,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Connect Adventures the one with the river rafting and the Pong-type game that was on Jimmy Fallon that one night?

476
00:36:33,363 --> 00:36:36,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the Pong-type game, I think that's in Connect Sports.

477
00:36:36,665 --> 00:36:37,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

478
00:36:37,565 --> 00:36:44,428
[SPEAKER_05]: But this had the obstacle course thing that they had, the river rafting, stuff like that.

479
00:36:44,528 --> 00:36:45,649
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would be kind of neat.

480
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:51,111
[SPEAKER_05]: But hopefully when you cost average it out, it makes it a little bit more...

481
00:36:52,472 --> 00:36:53,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Beneficial, I guess.

482
00:36:54,033 --> 00:36:57,976
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I want this and Dance Central day one, that's going to cost me, what, $200, right?

483
00:36:58,016 --> 00:36:58,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

484
00:36:58,156 --> 00:37:01,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Kinect games are going to be $10 cheaper?

485
00:37:01,538 --> 00:37:02,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they're going to be only $50.

486
00:37:02,939 --> 00:37:03,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

487
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,201
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be $150 plus $50 plus tax.

488
00:37:06,461 --> 00:37:11,685
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to cost me about $220 to get Kinect and Dance Central day one.

489
00:37:11,905 --> 00:37:12,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

490
00:37:12,245 --> 00:37:13,326
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a bit of an investment.

491
00:37:14,227 --> 00:37:14,567
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

492
00:37:14,747 --> 00:37:15,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think...

493
00:37:16,528 --> 00:37:16,808
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

494
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:54,758
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it may hurt the sales a little bit because it is pretty expensive but I mean they're trying to make it a little better because they're throwing in the game but when you look at it though with the new console when since it's being bundled with the new console then that really brings down the cost of the camera and I guess the software to $100.

495
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:10,305
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, are they losing money on the console or are they just, you know, adding some sort of profit margin in there for the actual, you know, accessory?

496
00:38:10,345 --> 00:38:14,087
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell you right now, obviously, it may be $150 retail.

497
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, that's not what they're selling them for.

498
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:25,312
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we probably work in about a 20% margin in there because that's usually I think what accessories go for is they have a 20% margin built in.

499
00:38:26,564 --> 00:38:32,326
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you figure that, I mean, they have to, I guess, leave room for the retailers to make some money.

500
00:38:33,087 --> 00:38:34,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me do a quick poll in our chat room.

501
00:38:34,547 --> 00:38:35,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick poll.

502
00:38:35,127 --> 00:38:39,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you buy Kinect and its buy-in game Kinect Adventures this year for $150?

503
00:38:39,709 --> 00:38:41,570
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to know.

504
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick poll in our chat room.

505
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:45,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to answer.

506
00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:45,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick poll.

507
00:38:45,931 --> 00:38:48,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see some yeses and nos and maybe some brief reasons why.

508
00:38:49,013 --> 00:38:49,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go around the room.

509
00:38:50,233 --> 00:38:52,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Who plans to buy Kinect and who says it's a waste of your time?

510
00:38:52,654 --> 00:38:53,094
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura?

511
00:38:54,715 --> 00:38:55,355
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Lemonade.

512
00:38:57,179 --> 00:38:58,159
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell does that mean?

513
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:03,161
[SPEAKER_02]: But you collect peripherals, so are you going to buy it on that principle, or are you like, no, this is one I don't need?

514
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:04,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Depends on what the money's like.

515
00:39:05,022 --> 00:39:07,282
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's not really always the big thing for us.

516
00:39:07,322 --> 00:39:08,683
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll eventually have it, I'm sure.

517
00:39:09,203 --> 00:39:10,263
[SPEAKER_07]: We eventually get everything.

518
00:39:10,484 --> 00:39:13,945
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like your economic situation's going to be, okay, well, that's fair.

519
00:39:14,045 --> 00:39:18,086
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, $150 right now is kind of steep, but I've paid more for less.

520
00:39:18,646 --> 00:39:18,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

521
00:39:19,907 --> 00:39:21,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan, something that interests you?

522
00:39:22,247 --> 00:39:22,908
[SPEAKER_02]: No interest at all.

523
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:23,688
[SPEAKER_02]: None?

524
00:39:23,808 --> 00:39:24,048
[SPEAKER_02]: None.

525
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:26,089
[SPEAKER_02]: What if they made it $50?

526
00:39:26,129 --> 00:39:26,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you buy it?

527
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:29,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I consider it then.

528
00:39:29,392 --> 00:39:39,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of in the same boat as Jamie, where it's like, not to be Debbie Downer, but, you know, blah, blah, economy, blah, blah, 9.5% unemployment rate.

529
00:39:39,154 --> 00:39:40,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I can't get that right now.

530
00:39:41,655 --> 00:39:49,477
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of listeners in the same boat as you guys, so I think it's a very realistic answer to say that, you know, because of economic situations, $150 is too damn much.

531
00:39:49,837 --> 00:39:51,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Now is not the time to be asking me to buy this stuff.

532
00:39:52,037 --> 00:40:02,142
[SPEAKER_02]: and a lot of people actually say that's why you didn't see new systems this year and you're seeing instead upgrades to existing systems because imagine if it wasn't just $150 for Kinect but $400 for Xbox 720 with a motion feature built in.

533
00:40:02,162 --> 00:40:02,702
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, day one...

534
00:40:10,266 --> 00:40:11,608
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little bit on the fence right now.

535
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:19,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of want to do it just because I really want Dance Central and the Dance Masters or whatever it is Konami's putting out.

536
00:40:19,736 --> 00:40:21,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of want to get both of those day one.

537
00:40:21,718 --> 00:40:22,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki?

538
00:40:22,819 --> 00:40:25,442
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple things.

539
00:40:26,303 --> 00:40:28,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I will probably pick it up on day one.

540
00:40:30,067 --> 00:40:30,287
[SPEAKER_05]: But

541
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:33,978
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

542
00:40:51,078 --> 00:40:55,599
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something interesting when you mentioned Dance Masters or whatever.

543
00:40:56,659 --> 00:40:57,420
[SPEAKER_05]: The Konami game.

544
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what I saw a listing for the other day.

545
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, really?

546
00:41:02,321 --> 00:41:03,801
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised that's still coming out.

547
00:41:03,901 --> 00:41:04,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this a secret?

548
00:41:05,242 --> 00:41:06,402
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't know if it's a secret.

549
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:13,344
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it may even be a mislisting because I haven't looked at the actual Konami release list yet.

550
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:13,744
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

551
00:41:14,824 --> 00:41:20,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Dance Dance Revolution is back on the list of games coming out, which I thought was interesting.

552
00:41:20,565 --> 00:41:21,445
[SPEAKER_02]: That wouldn't surprise me.

553
00:41:21,485 --> 00:41:23,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the Xbox and PS3 one?

554
00:41:23,806 --> 00:41:24,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

555
00:41:24,186 --> 00:41:24,946
[SPEAKER_02]: That wouldn't surprise me.

556
00:41:24,966 --> 00:41:26,106
[SPEAKER_02]: They try to get it out by the holiday.

557
00:41:26,447 --> 00:41:34,328
[SPEAKER_02]: But now is really a bad time because, you know, especially on 360, where it's all about, you know, now you can dance without the mat.

558
00:41:34,928 --> 00:41:36,729
[SPEAKER_02]: It just kind of seems like really bad timing.

559
00:41:36,909 --> 00:41:37,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

560
00:41:38,169 --> 00:42:06,762
[SPEAKER_05]: they really should have had that out earlier this year before E3 but I forgot to mention this during my gaming week because it's technically not a game I'm playing but holy shit is it awesome one of my release lists I saw and granted it hasn't been announced yet but I don't give a crap because it's so sweet Earth Defense Force 2017 Insect Armageddon yes they are making a sequel to the greatest one of the greatest games on the Xbox 360 in my opinion completely underrated

561
00:42:07,523 --> 00:42:09,726
[SPEAKER_05]: But oh, I cannot wait.

562
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Day one purchase for me.

563
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:12,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that on your Twitter.

564
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I was excited for you.

565
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:21,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go back to the results of our quick poll at chat.orangehonestradio.com Will you buy Kinect and its buy-in game Kinect Adventures this year for $150?

566
00:42:21,753 --> 00:42:23,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the results from our listeners.

567
00:42:24,094 --> 00:42:24,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

568
00:42:24,854 --> 00:42:25,114
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

569
00:42:25,535 --> 00:42:25,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

570
00:42:26,315 --> 00:42:26,595
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

571
00:42:26,955 --> 00:42:27,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

572
00:42:27,715 --> 00:42:29,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Only if a 360 is in that bundle.

573
00:42:29,896 --> 00:42:30,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

574
00:42:30,617 --> 00:42:32,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of fucking Dance Masters.

575
00:42:32,557 --> 00:42:32,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

576
00:42:33,338 --> 00:42:34,478
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be a good deal.

577
00:42:34,838 --> 00:42:36,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's with the 360 included.

578
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,640
[SPEAKER_02]: 80% chance on not this year.

579
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,722
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I don't have a job too, so I don't even think about it.

580
00:42:43,762 --> 00:42:44,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the results.

581
00:42:44,744 --> 00:42:46,265
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I told you guys you weren't alone.

582
00:42:46,326 --> 00:42:50,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing with the Kinect 2 is I like how simple it is.

583
00:42:50,951 --> 00:42:53,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, I buy the system and I'm done.

584
00:42:54,135 --> 00:42:58,921
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have to go, oh, okay, now I got to go buy all these extra accessories to get it to work.

585
00:42:59,381 --> 00:43:20,682
[SPEAKER_05]: and I know that they've had there's a bunch of those price comparison charts and like feature charts that one was released by Microsoft one was released by Sony which were hilarious and not to sound Microsoft centric or anything but at least their chart kind of seemed a little bit more fair with the comparison and what you have to buy you know to equal out a two player setup and the cost of that versus you know

586
00:43:21,303 --> 00:43:28,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony's saying that, oh, well, our system's in 1080p with Blu-ray as opposed to just 1080p.

587
00:43:29,009 --> 00:43:32,952
[SPEAKER_05]: You're substandard 1080p because it does not have Blu-ray technology.

588
00:43:33,232 --> 00:43:34,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Our system has buttons on it.

589
00:43:35,474 --> 00:43:37,876
[SPEAKER_02]: That is an excellent follow-up question for our chat room.

590
00:43:37,896 --> 00:43:39,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me ask this quick poll question real quick.

591
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:42,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you buying PlayStation Move this year?

592
00:43:42,859 --> 00:43:43,600
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to know.

593
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,981
[SPEAKER_02]: How much is PlayStation Move again?

594
00:44:02,769 --> 00:44:09,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's also like saying not all the Wii games require the nunchuck, but most of them do, so you're going to probably want it.

595
00:44:10,352 --> 00:44:19,376
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're going to have to buy another nunchuck, you're going to have to buy another move controller if you want two players, and another navigation controller nunchuck, whatever you want to call it.

596
00:44:19,996 --> 00:44:21,417
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are expensive.

597
00:44:22,277 --> 00:44:28,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Like $30 I think for the navigation controller, and I want to say like $70 for the actual controller.

598
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:30,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Around there.

599
00:44:30,621 --> 00:44:35,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be wrong on the prices, but... Quickly, let me run around the room and see who might buy PlayStation Move here.

600
00:44:35,545 --> 00:44:37,186
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, PlayStation Move this year?

601
00:44:40,349 --> 00:44:40,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

602
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:41,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't know.

603
00:44:41,897 --> 00:44:43,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, same kind of answer.

604
00:44:43,058 --> 00:44:43,518
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

605
00:44:43,718 --> 00:44:43,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan?

606
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:47,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a Wii yet, and I think that sort of answers the same question.

607
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:48,841
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not at all.

608
00:44:49,381 --> 00:44:51,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say it pretty strongly here.

609
00:44:51,883 --> 00:44:53,724
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no interest in PlayStation Move right now.

610
00:44:53,744 --> 00:44:57,566
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a single game that's on it that I'm really interested in.

611
00:44:58,306 --> 00:45:02,849
[SPEAKER_02]: You could charge me $50 for the whole thing, the bundle, the controller, everything.

612
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:03,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I still wouldn't buy it.

613
00:45:03,949 --> 00:45:09,973
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not to say I'm hateful for everything Sony this year, because I really want LittleBigPlanet 2, and there's some other things that don't involve the Move.

614
00:45:10,413 --> 00:45:11,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

615
00:45:27,132 --> 00:45:30,855
[SPEAKER_02]: For all practical purposes, those dance games really haven't been done before in this style.

616
00:45:31,436 --> 00:45:32,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, PlayStation Move.

617
00:45:32,917 --> 00:45:33,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely not.

618
00:45:33,958 --> 00:45:35,059
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like crap.

619
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:40,565
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't believe that they made games... I mean, just the whole lineup looks like junk.

620
00:45:40,945 --> 00:45:44,649
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, and the fact that the controller is just a total grab at...

621
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:47,312
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii stuff.

622
00:45:47,853 --> 00:45:50,997
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically a Wii with HD graphics.

623
00:45:52,759 --> 00:45:56,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Power to them, I guess, for trying to come up with a system that works for them.

624
00:45:58,573 --> 00:45:59,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

625
00:46:15,556 --> 00:46:17,097
[SPEAKER_05]: on the Wii.

626
00:46:17,638 --> 00:46:20,800
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't do it with the controller setup that you have either.

627
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:28,225
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to get things that, the closest to that you're going to get is like a Just Dance type game and I really don't, I'm not interested in something like that.

628
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:32,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Dartetsu in our chatroom says, care to make a wager if they'll sell one million units of Move?

629
00:46:33,348 --> 00:46:33,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so

630
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:49,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

631
00:46:49,536 --> 00:46:49,796
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

632
00:46:50,296 --> 00:46:50,577
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

633
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:52,518
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even have a PS3 as of now.

634
00:46:52,758 --> 00:46:53,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Hells no.

635
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:54,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell no.

636
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,701
[SPEAKER_02]: No thanks, I already have a Wii.

637
00:46:56,041 --> 00:46:57,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Only if someone gave me a PS3.

638
00:46:57,843 --> 00:46:58,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a PS3.

639
00:46:59,144 --> 00:47:01,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I really have no need for a PS3, nor do I want one.

640
00:47:02,627 --> 00:47:02,907
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

641
00:47:03,747 --> 00:47:04,268
[SPEAKER_02]: And BRB.

642
00:47:05,169 --> 00:47:08,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a single person in our chatroom, and please speak up if I missed you, said that they're buying it.

643
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:16,212
[SPEAKER_02]: We at least had about two or three saying they were getting Kinect, but not a single person saying they're getting Move.

644
00:47:16,672 --> 00:47:17,913
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be very interesting.

645
00:47:18,314 --> 00:47:20,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that I want to make bets, because I don't want to make bets.

646
00:47:21,276 --> 00:47:22,697
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to do this crap.

647
00:47:23,537 --> 00:47:31,103
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Move is going to fail, but they're going to be able to sweep it under the rug very easily, whereas Kinect is way riskier.

648
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:33,765
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if that's going to do well or not.

649
00:47:34,065 --> 00:47:39,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I want one, but I kind of have a bad feeling that Dance Central may be the only game I ever get to play on.

650
00:47:39,169 --> 00:47:44,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the problem, too, with the Kinect, is they haven't really shown off any of the hardcore games yet for it.

651
00:47:44,914 --> 00:47:46,455
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all been the casual stuff.

652
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:53,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, with the move, they showed, hey, look, we can use it in SOCOM 4, and look, we can use it in Killzone 2 if you want.

653
00:47:55,802 --> 00:47:56,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Killzone 3.

654
00:47:57,123 --> 00:48:05,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but they haven't really shown off anything like, hey look, Halo Reach is gonna, you know, support the move, or like, you know, Gears of War 3 or something like that.

655
00:48:06,027 --> 00:48:07,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Or not the move, the Kinect.

656
00:48:07,688 --> 00:48:08,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so...

657
00:48:10,425 --> 00:48:19,329
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, it'll be interesting to see what happens, but I don't think it's going to be like, oh my god, everybody's going to run out and get these consoles.

658
00:48:19,489 --> 00:48:33,715
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the same reason why, even with the Wii and stuff, the Wii sells well because it's cheap, and I guarantee if this stuff starts doing well, like the move in the Kinect, that that console will drop in price again to the sweet spot of $99, or even like $120, and...

659
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:41,298
[SPEAKER_05]: It won't matter anymore because people will be snatching that shit up like crazy.

660
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:50,263
[SPEAKER_05]: And seriously, when you think about it, if that's the kind of gameplay you're into, why the fuck should you spend $400 on an HD console so the graphics are slightly better?

661
00:48:51,184 --> 00:48:56,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, folks, it doesn't matter if the graphics are better as long as the game is fun.

662
00:48:56,827 --> 00:49:02,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if anything, look at some of the stuff that Capcom has done with the 8-bit retro games.

663
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:06,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Those games are fun because they're fun, not because they look pretty.

664
00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:13,597
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the whole point, is the games need to be fun, and you need to focus less on how pretty the games are.

665
00:49:13,857 --> 00:49:15,238
[SPEAKER_05]: That will only get you so far.

666
00:49:15,639 --> 00:49:17,100
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the fun that keeps people around.

667
00:49:18,441 --> 00:49:29,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, before I get into the next story, I'm sure there's going to be some, even though our chat results came up that nobody was interested in Move, I'm sure there's some folks listening to the podcast, because we do reach a pretty big audience with the podcast, comparatively.

668
00:49:29,649 --> 00:49:34,453
[SPEAKER_02]: There's probably somebody out there that's probably sitting there right now going, man, these guys just hating on Sony, man, man, man.

669
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:39,676
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm open to, and I really actually want to hear from the people that are going to buy PlayStation Move.

670
00:49:40,356 --> 00:49:41,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you buying PlayStation Move?

671
00:49:41,757 --> 00:49:43,638
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not asking that in an accusatory way.

672
00:49:43,658 --> 00:49:47,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of want to know, like, what is it that interests you about PlayStation Move?

673
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:49,200
[SPEAKER_02]: I told you I'm interested in Dance Central.

674
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,321
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of why I want to get connected.

675
00:49:50,641 --> 00:49:55,624
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it on Move that interests you for this holiday season, and what's motivating you to go out to get a move?

676
00:49:55,664 --> 00:49:56,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to hear from some listeners.

677
00:49:57,144 --> 00:49:58,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLunchRadio.com.

678
00:49:58,365 --> 00:50:06,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to real quickly talk about just Microsoft's thing when they put out the cost of the different systems and stuff like that.

679
00:50:06,811 --> 00:50:07,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, didn't you call this?

680
00:50:07,932 --> 00:50:08,853
[SPEAKER_02]: That this is going to come out?

681
00:50:09,453 --> 00:50:11,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft will put out a chart that says it?

682
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember you saying this in the show.

683
00:50:13,416 --> 00:50:13,716
[SPEAKER_02]: You did.

684
00:50:13,776 --> 00:50:14,276
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you did.

685
00:50:14,316 --> 00:50:18,800
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is assuming that you already own these consoles or whatever.

686
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:26,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what it will cost you to equal up to what I guess the PlayStation the Kinect can give you.

687
00:50:27,086 --> 00:50:32,430
[SPEAKER_05]: So, of course, the Kinect only supports two people, at least for full body capture or whatever.

688
00:50:34,411 --> 00:50:39,215
[SPEAKER_05]: So, for $150, you get the Kinect system.

689
00:50:39,415 --> 00:50:48,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, to equal that on the PlayStation side, you're going to need the $100 starter kit, which gets you the camera and the controller.

690
00:50:49,582 --> 00:51:17,178
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to need an additional controller which is another $50 and then two navigational controllers which are $30 each total cost $210 now if you compare that with the Wii all you're going to really need is another remote which is $40 they're saying the Wii balance board and this is mainly just so that you can play every single game that's available on the Wii because with the Kinect you're going to need just that camera to play every single game that's going to be available for Kinect

691
00:51:17,718 --> 00:51:22,282
[SPEAKER_05]: and then with the move, you're going to need those navigation controllers to play every single game on there.

692
00:51:22,743 --> 00:51:25,625
[SPEAKER_05]: And then an additional nunchuck, so that'll cost $160.

693
00:51:25,945 --> 00:51:28,367
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's only $10 more than the $150.

694
00:51:28,407 --> 00:51:33,532
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's how they're saying that they're a better bargain, I guess.

695
00:51:33,672 --> 00:51:35,954
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing some fuzzy math, though.

696
00:51:35,974 --> 00:51:38,296
[SPEAKER_02]: It's some funky... Because they're also saying...

697
00:51:38,756 --> 00:51:40,857
[SPEAKER_02]: if you already have these systems.

698
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:44,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, not including the price of the system.

699
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:50,183
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think it's a little bit shady to throw in the $100 balance board saying you need it.

700
00:51:50,543 --> 00:51:55,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I get where they're going with it, but Microsoft's doing some fuzzy math.

701
00:51:55,726 --> 00:51:59,129
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the sales people get paid to do.

702
00:51:59,149 --> 00:51:59,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

703
00:51:59,469 --> 00:52:09,537
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they do, but even with the PlayStation chart, the Sony chart, what they're talking about, the different features and stuff, some of the comparisons are ridiculous.

704
00:52:10,018 --> 00:52:15,342
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, they have six different bullet points that are the camera.

705
00:52:15,422 --> 00:52:19,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, the Wii does not have a camera, so all those are no.

706
00:52:19,905 --> 00:52:21,246
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're saying, camera?

707
00:52:21,427 --> 00:52:21,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

708
00:52:21,947 --> 00:52:22,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Augmentative reality?

709
00:52:22,988 --> 00:52:23,028
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

710
00:52:23,308 --> 00:52:33,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and it's basically, if you actually look and read all the stuff, it's all basically the same as the Kinect, except for, you know, oh, there's no buttons.

711
00:52:34,261 --> 00:52:37,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Darn, you know, well, what if you don't need buttons on there?

712
00:52:37,805 --> 00:52:40,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that they're stressing that buttons are really important.

713
00:52:40,968 --> 00:52:50,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like that they were stressing that force feedback wasn't important back when, you know, they didn't have the licensing for force feedback in the PlayStation 3 controllers.

714
00:52:50,516 --> 00:52:58,282
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what they should do is they should put out a chart that's a little more honest with the price, but they should just say, here's what the Xbox will do that the Wii won't do.

715
00:52:58,663 --> 00:53:00,624
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the Xbox is in HD.

716
00:53:00,724 --> 00:53:02,806
[SPEAKER_02]: The Xbox has access to indie games.

717
00:53:02,826 --> 00:53:05,268
[SPEAKER_02]: The Xbox has this library of download content.

718
00:53:05,308 --> 00:53:07,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft does what Nintendo don't.

719
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:09,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you know,

720
00:53:10,132 --> 00:53:10,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Just be honest.

721
00:53:10,972 --> 00:53:13,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a little more money, but this is what you're getting for all of it.

722
00:53:14,133 --> 00:53:15,154
[SPEAKER_02]: It plays DVDs.

723
00:53:15,934 --> 00:53:18,455
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do live interactive things like 1 vs. 100.

724
00:53:19,255 --> 00:53:19,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait.

725
00:53:19,895 --> 00:53:20,475
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you can't.

726
00:53:20,635 --> 00:53:21,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Not anymore.

727
00:53:21,855 --> 00:53:22,996
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can do Netflix Party.

728
00:53:23,076 --> 00:53:23,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo!

729
00:53:23,976 --> 00:53:29,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just wondering, though, the problem I think that they're going to have with these tune-to-motion systems is that...

730
00:53:30,638 --> 00:53:32,519
[SPEAKER_05]: It may be too late, you know what I mean?

731
00:53:32,659 --> 00:53:38,301
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, the Wii is so inexpensive now, and it's only going to get cheaper.

732
00:53:38,321 --> 00:53:45,783
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, putting out these additional systems, that's basically like saying, oh, you know, you need to buy another system.

733
00:53:45,863 --> 00:53:49,805
[SPEAKER_05]: And fuck, for $150, why don't you just go buy a Wii?

734
00:53:50,245 --> 00:53:53,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, because you can pretty much do that with that kind of cost.

735
00:53:55,345 --> 00:54:00,749
[SPEAKER_05]: So why even bother buying the Kinect when they're just basically saying, for $150, I can just buy a Wii.

736
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:06,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me leave this story on this comment from our chatroom, chat.orangeonsradio.com, because I think it's interesting.

737
00:54:07,033 --> 00:54:12,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Frisbee says, in response to something Jamie said a minute ago, Microsoft does what Nintendo should.

738
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:14,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Perhaps.

739
00:54:15,143 --> 00:54:21,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's move on to our next story, and this has to do with stuff going on in the real world that will definitely impact gaming.

740
00:54:22,087 --> 00:54:30,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you guys have heard about this bill that's going to go before the Supreme Court, and it's a California bill that is basically banning the sale of violent video games to kid.

741
00:54:30,511 --> 00:54:30,791
[SPEAKER_02]: To kid?

742
00:54:32,292 --> 00:54:33,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Just this one kid, actually.

743
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:35,034
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the kids.

744
00:54:36,214 --> 00:54:43,658
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be going before the Supreme Court because it was overturned by a lower court some time ago after it was signed into law.

745
00:54:44,138 --> 00:54:50,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, long story short, 11 states have now joined in basically saying they support this bill.

746
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:53,723
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is no longer just a California issue.

747
00:54:54,343 --> 00:55:00,166
[SPEAKER_02]: But Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Texas, and Virginia...

748
00:55:00,626 --> 00:55:01,987
[SPEAKER_02]: are now all on this too.

749
00:55:02,468 --> 00:55:17,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to say that if the Supreme Court reverses the other decision putting the law into effect, not to say that all these states will suddenly also have the law, but that should tell you where California goes at least these 11 states are lined up to follow.

750
00:55:18,243 --> 00:55:25,865
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to have your voice heard, you might want to call your congressperson and don't be afraid to do so because that's what they're there for.

751
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:27,005
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they're paid to do.

752
00:55:27,025 --> 00:55:28,305
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also the ECA.

753
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:29,846
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go through the ECA.

754
00:55:30,506 --> 00:55:35,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, you know, the ECA is a union you can kind of join to support and help fight it.

755
00:55:35,667 --> 00:55:39,328
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is nothing quite like contacting your representative directly.

756
00:55:39,688 --> 00:55:40,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to say something on this?

757
00:55:41,263 --> 00:55:41,403
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

758
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:42,204
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

759
00:55:43,786 --> 00:55:48,251
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I definitely would encourage folks to contact people.

760
00:55:48,351 --> 00:55:50,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, this is... You know, and...

761
00:55:51,989 --> 00:56:03,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, just to kind of state where the issue is with this, is that whereas, yes, kids should not be playing violent video games, isn't that really up to the parents to be doing and not really the video game stores?

762
00:56:03,635 --> 00:56:08,177
[SPEAKER_02]: And why are video games being held to a different standard than movies?

763
00:56:08,717 --> 00:56:12,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it against the law to sell an R-rated movie to a kid?

764
00:56:12,939 --> 00:56:13,820
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't do it.

765
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:14,620
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not supposed to do it.

766
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:15,801
[SPEAKER_02]: But is it against the law?

767
00:56:16,501 --> 00:56:19,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's going to be against the law to do video games pretty soon.

768
00:56:21,164 --> 00:56:21,784
[SPEAKER_02]: If this happens.

769
00:56:43,038 --> 00:56:43,818
[SPEAKER_03]: is necessary.

770
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:54,622
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, it should be, you know, if parents were doing their due diligence on what their kids were playing and buying or what they bought for their kids, it's just, it seems really unnecessary.

771
00:56:55,802 --> 00:56:58,043
[SPEAKER_02]: J. Rod in our chat says, I don't get why this is an issue.

772
00:56:58,103 --> 00:57:02,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Children need a parent to get into an R-rated movie or buy a parental advisory music album.

773
00:57:02,324 --> 00:57:03,545
[SPEAKER_02]: But is that against the law?

774
00:57:06,425 --> 00:57:08,006
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just that same double standard again.

775
00:57:09,617 --> 00:57:11,819
[SPEAKER_02]: I somewhat agree with you, J-Rod.

776
00:57:11,859 --> 00:57:16,021
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that, you know, I think video games are being held to a different standard, and that's not very fair.

777
00:57:16,382 --> 00:57:21,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's just going into that whole stereotype that video games somehow make you a more violent person.

778
00:57:22,146 --> 00:57:24,527
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of don't like what they're trying to say.

779
00:57:25,628 --> 00:57:26,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like what you're trying to say to me!

780
00:57:27,129 --> 00:57:27,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

781
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:29,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on with another story, DarkSakura.

782
00:57:30,748 --> 00:57:32,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is happier news.

783
00:57:32,209 --> 00:57:34,451
[SPEAKER_07]: This actually makes me in particular very happy.

784
00:57:34,992 --> 00:57:40,076
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a couple of games coming out from both Capcom and Namco Bandai.

785
00:57:41,737 --> 00:57:45,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Street Fighter x Tekken and Tekken x Street Fighter.

786
00:57:45,701 --> 00:57:46,602
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the difference, huh?

787
00:57:47,262 --> 00:57:55,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Capcom's in charge of the former, and that one's going to be all done in that sort of Street Fighter 4 style, that 2.5D look.

788
00:57:57,972 --> 00:58:03,618
[SPEAKER_07]: and all the Tekken characters will be re-imaged to fit that same style.

789
00:58:04,039 --> 00:58:10,086
[SPEAKER_07]: And I saw a screen capture from it with Kazuya and Ryu and it looked really, really good.

790
00:58:10,146 --> 00:58:12,930
[SPEAKER_05]: The gameplay looks exactly like Street Fighter 4.

791
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:14,511
[SPEAKER_07]: That will make me intensely happy.

792
00:58:14,592 --> 00:58:17,355
[SPEAKER_05]: They have the video of it and of course it's tag team so it's going to be sweet.

793
00:58:19,069 --> 00:58:45,243
[SPEAKER_07]: and that one will have versus training and tag team and it's going to be a full on Capcom style now the latter is going to be more of the Tekken style play that has a 3D arena so I don't know if they're going to be taking the sort of Street Fighter EX move list and importing it into Tekken or what but

794
00:58:47,003 --> 00:58:54,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if it's going to be trying to actually translate the styles of each character into a move list that would fit the way Tekken plays.

795
00:58:54,807 --> 00:59:03,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there's not really any real major projectile moves like that in Tekken, except for a couple of interesting moves.

796
00:59:04,432 --> 00:59:08,734
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's the unblockable moves too, like Jin's whole electric block thing.

797
00:59:08,974 --> 00:59:13,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in the later Tekkens, the final boss would have a fireball to make them even more...

798
00:59:13,857 --> 00:59:41,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheesier That's right But normally, yeah, the regular characters don't From what I remember Now, Tekken was always my big thing Especially when Tekken 3 came out I was working in a Namco arcade at the time So, of course, we had it before everybody else did And I was like, ooh, I know who that character's coming out You know, because I was keeping up with the Japanese character releases at the time We got ours in a different order than they did in Japan

799
00:59:43,544 --> 00:59:47,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Tekken 3 was a huge deal here because it was a launch title with the PS2.

800
00:59:47,846 --> 00:59:55,630
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you were in line at midnight, September whatever, 2000 for the PS2, you were picking up Tekken 3, SSX, big.

801
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:57,551
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Tekken Tag Tournament, actually.

802
00:59:57,772 --> 00:59:59,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Tekken 3 was on the PS1, I'm pretty sure.

803
00:59:59,492 --> 01:00:00,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Tekken 3 was with the PS1.

804
01:00:00,353 --> 01:00:02,714
[SPEAKER_02]: They had like a souped up version on the PS2.

805
01:00:02,734 --> 01:00:03,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what they had, yeah.

806
01:00:04,415 --> 01:00:32,146
[SPEAKER_07]: but Tekken Tag Tournament was the big thing and actually they fixed a lot of the problems that the Japanese Tekken Tag Tournament had because it had this weird thing where the background would almost detach from the foreground and it would really give me a headache after a while playing it but I've got, I imported Tekken 3 when it came out in Japan and actually they censored the endings between that one and the US one it's pretty funny

807
01:00:32,566 --> 01:00:36,288
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of wish if Capcom and Namco were going to get into bed together again.

808
01:00:36,568 --> 01:00:38,269
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get to that in a moment.

809
01:00:38,589 --> 01:00:45,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of wish it was Street Fighter across Soul Calibur, personally, because I love me some Soul Calibur, but I get it.

810
01:00:45,993 --> 01:00:47,874
[SPEAKER_02]: The universe of Tekken and Street Fighter are similar.

811
01:00:48,214 --> 01:00:52,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Soul Calibur would not really fit as well in that universe, although Darth Vader and Yoda seem to do okay.

812
01:00:54,278 --> 01:00:57,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Soul Calibur is taking its own kind of interesting direction.

813
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:01,181
[SPEAKER_07]: It's shifting in more to the customized character.

814
01:01:01,702 --> 01:01:04,423
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to see, where's my announcement on Soul Calibur 5?

815
01:01:04,523 --> 01:01:07,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we should be about ready for that, don't you think?

816
01:01:07,424 --> 01:01:09,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Soul Calibur 4 was a couple years ago, I'm just saying.

817
01:01:09,645 --> 01:01:15,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, what I really want to see is, Capcom, I hope you're listening, I want to know the rival schools.

818
01:01:16,622 --> 01:01:42,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, also, let's get into this, because it has kind of a funky name, and we've heard people say Street Fighter X Tekken, because that's what it literally reads like, and then we've heard, like, Tekken versus Street Fighter, just kind of people replacing it with versus, but the name actually comes from a couple years ago, and I know we've talked about it on this show, it was a Japanese game that never came out here, there was already a Namco Cross Capcom, and it was more of like, it wasn't more of like a strategy game or something, it just involved the characters from the various universes, I think it was?

819
01:01:42,918 --> 01:01:43,779
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a tactical strategy.

820
01:01:43,799 --> 01:01:45,200
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a tactical game that came out.

821
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:47,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is why I never bothered with it, but it had some sweet music.

822
01:01:47,623 --> 01:01:52,327
[SPEAKER_02]: So it should be known that this is not the first time that Namco and Capcom have kind of gotten in bed together.

823
01:01:52,527 --> 01:01:58,273
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of a logical type of follow-up, so it's a little weird in a way.

824
01:01:58,453 --> 01:02:06,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to admit, I'm kind of sad that it's not a Capcom SNK Part 3, because that's what I would really like to see, because...

825
01:02:07,001 --> 01:02:13,506
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer Mai and Andy Bogard and all them from the SNK universe, but whatever.

826
01:02:14,106 --> 01:02:28,135
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I want them to do, I would like to have, I mean, as much as Street Fighter and Tekken seems to be such a logical choice for them to do a crossover game with, because those are the two biggest franchises of each company.

827
01:02:29,276 --> 01:02:36,037
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have preferred to have a more generic all-out like how Capcom vs. SNK was.

828
01:02:37,037 --> 01:02:43,739
[SPEAKER_07]: They had the Cardfighters Clash game, which was pretty fun, and then you had the fighting game.

829
01:02:45,499 --> 01:02:50,400
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that the company's major artists did each other's art for them.

830
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:53,760
[SPEAKER_07]: The Capcom artists did the SNK artists and vice versa.

831
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:56,901
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to have Klonoa in a fighting game.

832
01:02:58,242 --> 01:02:59,684
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the joke I was about to make, yeah.

833
01:02:59,704 --> 01:03:00,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Klonoa versus Akuma.

834
01:03:01,653 --> 01:03:09,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, even in the trailer, at the very end, they show, like, Mega Man chasing a Pac-Man ghost, and then a Pac-Man chomping after Mega Man.

835
01:03:09,198 --> 01:03:10,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's really weird.

836
01:03:10,599 --> 01:03:13,842
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm like, are they gonna do something with Mega Man Universe?

837
01:03:13,922 --> 01:03:16,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what the hell are these two companies planning?

838
01:03:16,724 --> 01:03:18,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, is this weird?

839
01:03:18,485 --> 01:03:21,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, somebody is sleeping with somebody at the other company.

840
01:03:22,568 --> 01:03:25,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, because, like, now, what's gonna happen next?

841
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:27,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Katamari Damacy meets Resident Evil?

842
01:03:27,131 --> 01:03:27,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

843
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:31,555
[SPEAKER_07]: You've made the zombie moon!

844
01:03:31,575 --> 01:03:34,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, that's how you'd make Pluto, because Pluto's the dead planet.

845
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:37,181
[SPEAKER_02]: We should do that as a list list some week.

846
01:03:37,201 --> 01:03:40,625
[SPEAKER_02]: The Namco cross-Capcom series we'd like to see happen next.

847
01:03:42,407 --> 01:03:46,191
[SPEAKER_07]: That would just be all kinds of wrong.

848
01:03:47,774 --> 01:03:54,437
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is interesting, because Capcom's got a lot of fighting games coming out, because they've got this, they've got Marvel vs. Capcom still happening.

849
01:03:54,977 --> 01:03:59,079
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all these, like, X vs. Y. Marvel vs. Capcom 3!

850
01:03:59,979 --> 01:04:00,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Ow, that hurt.

851
01:04:00,959 --> 01:04:00,939
3!

852
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,440
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just in my right hand.

853
01:04:03,681 --> 01:04:09,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I'm still majorly looking forward to, because, dude, my team of Deadpool and Dante, aww.

854
01:04:09,523 --> 01:04:13,505
[SPEAKER_02]: S2100 Matt in our chatroom at chat.orange.com is saying Napcom, or Napcom?

855
01:04:13,745 --> 01:04:14,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Napcom.

856
01:04:16,138 --> 01:04:17,499
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what happens when you read too fast.

857
01:04:17,539 --> 01:04:18,799
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that name, Napcom.

858
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Namco Cross Capcom was a massive financial failure.

859
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:26,142
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize that, but that might explain why it never came out to the US.

860
01:04:26,783 --> 01:04:31,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at the Wikipedia article that we got linked here and trying to see what's going on.

861
01:04:32,005 --> 01:04:33,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was a tactical game.

862
01:04:34,526 --> 01:04:36,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to see how it was received.

863
01:04:36,668 --> 01:04:38,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there's a lot of characters in the different games there.

864
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:39,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Reception.

865
01:04:40,131 --> 01:04:42,614
[SPEAKER_02]: It got a 28 out of 40 in Famitsu.

866
01:04:43,094 --> 01:04:45,516
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the top-selling game the week of release.

867
01:04:46,077 --> 01:04:53,424
[SPEAKER_02]: It sold approximately 131,000 copies in its first six months of release, and then it got re-released as a PlayStation 2 the best.

868
01:04:53,724 --> 01:04:54,905
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't sound terrible.

869
01:04:55,806 --> 01:04:59,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it wasn't like, oh my gosh, blow your hair back, but it sounds like it did okay.

870
01:05:00,606 --> 01:05:06,027
[SPEAKER_07]: That rating coming from Famitsu, you know how strict they are on their ratings.

871
01:05:07,108 --> 01:05:09,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Haven't they given only five games a ten?

872
01:05:09,328 --> 01:05:12,329
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more like twelve, and Nintendogs was one of them.

873
01:05:12,949 --> 01:05:13,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendogs was great.

874
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:17,750
[SPEAKER_02]: For about five minutes, which is how long they must have played it for.

875
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:22,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually, yeah, they've got some pretty strict standards.

876
01:05:22,811 --> 01:05:25,112
[SPEAKER_02]: But they've had their moments of weakness, that's for sure.

877
01:05:26,254 --> 01:05:28,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know about you guys, but I'm looking forward to this.

878
01:05:29,435 --> 01:05:30,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Tekken 1, 2, 3.

879
01:05:31,776 --> 01:05:35,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I had all those games from PlayStation 1, and then I kind of stopped playing Tekken.

880
01:05:36,117 --> 01:05:37,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really ever play 4 or 5.

881
01:05:37,878 --> 01:05:38,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I rented 4.

882
01:05:38,918 --> 01:05:39,338
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

883
01:05:39,739 --> 01:05:44,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember I got Tekken 6 from Gamefly, and you came over, and we played it for a couple hours.

884
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:45,240
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

885
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:50,262
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had 40 characters, which is a ton amount of characters, and we were like, we don't care.

886
01:05:50,882 --> 01:05:51,863
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of bad.

887
01:05:52,003 --> 01:05:53,003
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't that great.

888
01:05:53,023 --> 01:05:54,303
[SPEAKER_03]: We just couldn't get into it.

889
01:05:56,404 --> 01:06:03,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I really am curious to see kind of what the Tekken... I mean, because we all know what Street Fighter X Tekken is going to look like.

890
01:06:03,352 --> 01:06:05,534
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be freaking Street Fighter 4 with Tekken characters.

891
01:06:05,674 --> 01:06:06,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoopee!

892
01:06:06,695 --> 01:06:09,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm more curious to see what Tekken X Street Fighter ends up looking like.

893
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:14,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, is it going to kind of not be so great like Tekken 6?

894
01:06:14,964 --> 01:06:16,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are they going to maybe get...

895
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:19,067
[SPEAKER_02]: The Soul Calibur people to work on it?

896
01:06:19,147 --> 01:06:19,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

897
01:06:19,788 --> 01:06:21,048
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be interesting to see what happens.

898
01:06:21,229 --> 01:06:22,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you see the pictures, Rob?

899
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:26,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the pictures of Street Fighter X Tekken, but I didn't see the other way around.

900
01:06:27,072 --> 01:06:28,293
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if there's pictures out for that yet.

901
01:06:28,313 --> 01:06:31,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there is, because this all happened at Comic-Con at the Capcom panel.

902
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:36,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, by the way, isn't it weird that they waited for Comic-Con and didn't say something at E3?

903
01:06:36,899 --> 01:06:41,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, maybe they weren't ready to make an announcement at E3, but it wasn't that long ago.

904
01:06:41,502 --> 01:06:44,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Comic-Con seems like a weird place to make that type of announcement.

905
01:06:46,084 --> 01:06:47,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, Comic-Con, all about the comic books.

906
01:06:49,269 --> 01:06:52,795
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that this particular shot was just epic.

907
01:06:53,056 --> 01:06:56,281
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's looking at a shot of Ryu fighting Jin, right?

908
01:06:56,422 --> 01:06:56,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Kazuya.

909
01:06:59,156 --> 01:07:02,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Drew looks like, I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU!

910
01:07:02,859 --> 01:07:06,942
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell you right now what the Tekken X Street Fighter is going to look like.

911
01:07:07,662 --> 01:07:09,223
[SPEAKER_05]: The Street Fighter EX series.

912
01:07:09,243 --> 01:07:10,004
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I hope not.

913
01:07:10,384 --> 01:07:11,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God, I'm sorry.

914
01:07:11,425 --> 01:07:12,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Those games were terrible.

915
01:07:12,386 --> 01:07:13,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not like them at all.

916
01:07:13,547 --> 01:07:14,607
[SPEAKER_07]: EX3 was alright.

917
01:07:15,368 --> 01:07:17,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, dude, it's all about Skullamania.

918
01:07:19,271 --> 01:07:21,372
[SPEAKER_07]: But those weren't even produced by Capcom proper.

919
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:23,494
[SPEAKER_07]: It was done through an American company.

920
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:27,706
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like those games, so I'm surprised hearing this from you right now.

921
01:07:27,946 --> 01:07:29,750
[SPEAKER_03]: The EX series.

922
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:30,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's really underrated.

923
01:07:30,932 --> 01:07:31,473
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked them all.

924
01:07:32,443 --> 01:07:34,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, you have fun.

925
01:07:36,888 --> 01:07:37,348
[SPEAKER_02]: All yours.

926
01:07:38,129 --> 01:07:50,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if Namco's doing that one in particular, then I'm more than certain that they're going to be sticking with Namco's style for how they do it.

927
01:07:50,563 --> 01:07:54,387
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've always had really tight gameplay for the Tekken's.

928
01:07:54,747 --> 01:07:57,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what was the SNK game called?

929
01:07:57,188 --> 01:08:00,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember there was Capcom vs. SNK, but SNK put out, what, SVC Chaos or something?

930
01:08:01,269 --> 01:08:02,349
[SPEAKER_02]: And that game wasn't so great.

931
01:08:03,189 --> 01:08:06,390
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I love me some SNK, but Capcom, I think, made the better game.

932
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:07,470
[SPEAKER_07]: It was alright.

933
01:08:09,271 --> 01:08:09,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyhow.

934
01:08:10,471 --> 01:08:12,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on with some more gaming news.

935
01:08:12,531 --> 01:08:15,852
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to release dates in a little bit after this next round of news starting off with Loki.

936
01:08:17,253 --> 01:08:22,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony has patented multiplayer via stereoscopic systems.

937
01:08:22,774 --> 01:08:50,678
[SPEAKER_05]: basically the way this is going to work they actually had something similar and I'm surprised that they were able to patent this anyways they have a way now using the kind of shutter system or whatever that you'll only be able to see your I guess your player or whatever on the screen at one time while someone else can actually see the full screen as well so it'll do split screen by basically having two different images on the screen at the same time

938
01:08:51,718 --> 01:09:17,326
[SPEAKER_05]: and each player will only be able to see their own version of the screen using those shutter glasses they actually have this already in TVs right now because I know you can actually do that with those 120 MHz TVs and watch two different programs at the same time or two different inputs but I guess this would actually kind of combine it with only one input but it would still be two different versions of the game or whatever that you're playing I don't know why but that technology sounds painful to me

939
01:09:18,067 --> 01:09:25,053
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really, it's a neat idea, but it's really, it's not something that they're going to be like, oh my god, you can do this.

940
01:09:27,075 --> 01:09:42,187
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be kind of cool, but at the same time, it's kind of a dumb use of, if I've got these 3D glasses that I'm paying for and this 3D TV that I'm paying for, I'm going to want to use the 3D portion of that and not necessarily the split screen portion of that.

941
01:09:42,287 --> 01:09:46,210
[SPEAKER_02]: But what if you want to watch one show and your sister wants to watch another show?

942
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:48,652
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, now you both can watch the same show.

943
01:09:48,712 --> 01:09:50,953
[SPEAKER_02]: But wouldn't it just be cheaper to get a second TV?

944
01:09:51,113 --> 01:09:52,274
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not that at all.

945
01:09:52,494 --> 01:09:55,737
[SPEAKER_05]: This would be just two players.

946
01:09:55,937 --> 01:10:00,840
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a multiplayer game, but you're just watching two different players using the same screen.

947
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:01,601
[SPEAKER_02]: But couldn't you do that?

948
01:10:01,881 --> 01:10:02,502
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

949
01:10:18,058 --> 01:10:32,164
[SPEAKER_05]: or you can be, stop being a little pussy and just, you know, look at half the fucking screen instead of spending like hundreds of dollars on a fucking camera or like a stupid shutter glass system just to do this.

950
01:10:32,444 --> 01:10:34,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Just buy another damn TV like you said.

951
01:10:34,585 --> 01:10:39,146
[SPEAKER_02]: But the game system doesn't have the processing power to handle the split screen.

952
01:10:39,207 --> 01:10:42,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Those PlayStation 3s with their, what are they called?

953
01:10:42,088 --> 01:10:44,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, the Uber Cores or whatever those are.

954
01:10:44,349 --> 01:10:45,269
[SPEAKER_02]: The Emotion Engine.

955
01:10:45,569 --> 01:10:46,170
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

956
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:09,673
[SPEAKER_05]: What they really should have done, Rob, is they should have gone back to the original design of the PS3.

957
01:11:09,713 --> 01:11:11,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the original design of the PS3?

958
01:11:11,294 --> 01:11:12,455
[SPEAKER_05]: How ridiculous that was?

959
01:11:12,755 --> 01:11:16,818
[SPEAKER_05]: With, like, it's three HDMI outs and it's dual LAN outs and stuff.

960
01:11:16,838 --> 01:11:18,780
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, what the fuck do you need that stuff for?

961
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:22,802
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, if that's really what they want to do with this, then why not just do that?

962
01:11:22,902 --> 01:11:24,223
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can have two fucking TVs.

963
01:11:24,564 --> 01:11:29,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, I don't know, how about you just stop being a little whiny bitch about it and just not worry about it?

964
01:11:29,047 --> 01:11:31,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, seriously, how many fucking split-screen games are out there?

965
01:11:32,169 --> 01:11:34,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that much anymore, which is really sad.

966
01:11:34,230 --> 01:11:34,951
[SPEAKER_02]: It is sad, dude.

967
01:11:34,991 --> 01:11:36,252
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be more.

968
01:11:37,553 --> 01:11:41,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Resistance was a fun split-screen game, but there's not a lot of stuff out there.

969
01:11:41,895 --> 01:11:46,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Call of Duty, that'll still do split-screen, but it's not a lot out there.

970
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:52,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Why even bother working on this technology for a handful of games?

971
01:11:53,463 --> 01:11:56,965
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Blur is split-screen, the racing game, except everyone hates that game for some reason.

972
01:11:56,985 --> 01:11:57,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why.

973
01:11:57,545 --> 01:11:58,166
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that bad.

974
01:11:58,766 --> 01:12:04,695
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know who does have the technology to handle split-screen flawlessly and who could bring split-screen to all our homes is Skynet.

975
01:12:05,676 --> 01:12:06,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

976
01:12:07,179 --> 01:12:08,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get behind that.

977
01:12:09,562 --> 01:12:09,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

978
01:12:10,043 --> 01:12:13,227
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, if you really... This is such an issue.

979
01:12:13,428 --> 01:12:14,069
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I just...

980
01:12:16,043 --> 01:12:16,764
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

981
01:12:32,179 --> 01:12:36,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it'd be kind of neat to go, hey, look, we can play a two-player game or whatever.

982
01:12:37,063 --> 01:12:43,127
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's gonna stop someone from, say, I don't know, adjusting the shutters on their glasses to sneak a peek at what you're doing?

983
01:12:43,147 --> 01:12:45,729
[SPEAKER_05]: It's exactly the same shit all over again.

984
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:48,671
[SPEAKER_07]: I get motion sick with split screens.

985
01:12:49,878 --> 01:12:50,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

986
01:12:50,518 --> 01:12:51,599
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't just focus on one?

987
01:12:52,539 --> 01:12:53,600
[SPEAKER_07]: No, mine don't work that way.

988
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,002
[SPEAKER_05]: But you also can't play first person shooters, so it wouldn't really matter anyways.

989
01:12:58,403 --> 01:13:04,406
[SPEAKER_07]: But like when we were doing racing games on split screens, it would actually give me a headache after a while.

990
01:13:05,307 --> 01:13:08,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Even Mario Kart on the old Super Nintendo?

991
01:13:08,448 --> 01:13:08,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

992
01:13:08,909 --> 01:13:09,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

993
01:13:09,169 --> 01:13:09,649
[SPEAKER_02]: That's too bad.

994
01:13:09,789 --> 01:13:11,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that was like the king of split screen right there.

995
01:13:11,914 --> 01:13:22,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was because the aspect rate, well, especially for the older ones, the aspect ratio is changed so badly that it really starts putting a strain on my eyes.

996
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:24,161
[SPEAKER_13]: It's too bad.

997
01:13:25,181 --> 01:13:33,266
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, moving on to something that I don't know if they'll be able to put split screen into this, but it's a new technology-ish thing coming to PlayStation Home.

998
01:13:33,626 --> 01:13:35,647
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a partnership with Codename.

999
01:13:36,688 --> 01:13:43,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Code name, I guess, is this indie game label that is going to be making content for PlayStation Home.

1000
01:13:45,316 --> 01:13:46,737
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the games is going to be...

1001
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:51,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they going to be putting out content like Sodium One?

1002
01:14:14,251 --> 01:14:19,174
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the game says draw, you push the button on the gun as fast as you can.

1003
01:14:20,235 --> 01:14:23,577
[SPEAKER_02]: And on harder rounds, you have to pull the trigger faster.

1004
01:14:24,497 --> 01:14:26,118
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe that's what Dueling Gentleman will be.

1005
01:14:26,278 --> 01:14:28,420
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be press X button to win.

1006
01:14:30,358 --> 01:14:32,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Wild Gunman Strategy in Holmes Plaza

1007
01:14:48,652 --> 01:14:49,612
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea what that is.

1008
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:52,653
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess also Peanut Gallery is another developer.

1009
01:14:52,673 --> 01:14:54,254
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be making Minor Battle.

1010
01:14:54,294 --> 01:14:55,814
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a capture the flag type of game.

1011
01:14:56,314 --> 01:15:00,055
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Codename is making Super Awesome Mountain RPG.

1012
01:15:00,595 --> 01:15:04,156
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to have tabletop board games with fantasy role playing.

1013
01:15:04,677 --> 01:15:05,497
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be interesting.

1014
01:15:06,577 --> 01:15:08,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Bringing like a little bit of tabletop into home.

1015
01:15:08,438 --> 01:15:12,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because they have super and awesome in the title does not mean it's going to be super awesome.

1016
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,824
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, actually having super and awesome in the title usually means it's not super awesome.

1017
01:15:19,044 --> 01:15:27,871
[SPEAKER_02]: A game by Lazy8 called Cogs will be in 3D, and it will be a dynamic public spectacle in Home Central Plaza.

1018
01:15:28,712 --> 01:15:36,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, I thought the furry dance-off day in Sony Home was the dynamic public spectacle, but maybe that's just me, I don't know.

1019
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,981
[SPEAKER_07]: I got your dynamic public spectacle.

1020
01:15:40,762 --> 01:15:46,966
[SPEAKER_05]: And any of this going to be able to be translated into, I don't know, stuff for my apartment or a club?

1021
01:15:47,066 --> 01:15:48,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this going to expand the clubs in any way?

1022
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:50,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe, I don't know.

1023
01:15:51,009 --> 01:15:52,510
[SPEAKER_05]: They haven't said yet.

1024
01:15:52,650 --> 01:15:54,071
[SPEAKER_05]: They haven't said because it's not going to happen.

1025
01:15:55,475 --> 01:15:58,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't Sodium One have a shirt?

1026
01:15:58,117 --> 01:15:59,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god!

1027
01:15:59,197 --> 01:16:02,800
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally misinterpreted Sodium One then.

1028
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:05,842
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the super awesomest thing ever.

1029
01:16:06,302 --> 01:16:07,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I got a shirt.

1030
01:16:07,863 --> 01:16:10,885
[SPEAKER_02]: You can win a shirt, but Loki, it's not actually a real shirt.

1031
01:16:11,665 --> 01:16:18,069
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like back in the Atari 2600 days where they would actually send you patches for your jacket if you got a high enough score in barnstorming or whatever.

1032
01:16:18,129 --> 01:16:19,230
[SPEAKER_02]: And they should do that!

1033
01:16:20,671 --> 01:16:21,972
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what achievements are.

1034
01:16:23,037 --> 01:16:25,478
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wear my achievements.

1035
01:16:42,785 --> 01:17:11,410
[SPEAKER_02]: you would unlock a Left 4 Dead 2 t-shirt for your avatar which you could then wear and go on 1 vs 100 and show off your Left 4 Dead 2 t-shirt they've done that in a few games but not a lot have used it yet and I wonder if it's something we'll start seeing more in the next couple years like Blur, you can get a shirt for your avatar in Blur too I think there's a couple shirts you can get but one of them is really easy to get because I got it I have a sombrero for Red Dead Redemption which I noticed the other day I'm like, oh, okay wonderful

1036
01:17:13,624 --> 01:17:15,365
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1037
01:17:37,492 --> 01:18:06,036
[SPEAKER_07]: at any rate, it's going to be exclusive to Game and Game Station it will be $249.99 that's pounds will be out on September 14th it will have the limited edition wireless controller the wireless headset those will be available in the UK on the 3rd of September and we're actually getting it later than they are over there

1038
01:18:06,816 --> 01:18:08,257
[SPEAKER_07]: The controller is going to be $39.99.

1039
01:18:08,978 --> 01:18:11,900
[SPEAKER_07]: The headset will be $34.99.

1040
01:18:14,883 --> 01:18:18,065
[SPEAKER_07]: And they are going to be limited and available for pre-order.

1041
01:18:19,967 --> 01:18:27,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, as far as in the U.S., I believe that we're getting the bundle for $399 on September 14th.

1042
01:18:30,006 --> 01:18:31,808
[SPEAKER_02]: So a new controller will be available, huh?

1043
01:18:32,628 --> 01:18:34,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Have they fixed the fucking D-pad yet?

1044
01:18:35,591 --> 01:18:36,191
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1045
01:18:36,411 --> 01:18:40,194
[SPEAKER_07]: For the record, our wireless controller is going to be $60.

1046
01:18:42,316 --> 01:18:45,679
[SPEAKER_07]: And come with a Covenant Banshee Avatar token for Xbox Live.

1047
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:49,842
[SPEAKER_07]: And the headset will be $50 over here.

1048
01:18:50,042 --> 01:18:52,304
[SPEAKER_07]: And they will be in late August.

1049
01:18:53,385 --> 01:18:54,526
[SPEAKER_02]: $60 for a controller.

1050
01:18:54,946 --> 01:18:56,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize that's how much they cost now, but it's just...

1051
01:18:57,488 --> 01:18:59,009
[SPEAKER_02]: God, controllers are expensive.

1052
01:18:59,069 --> 01:18:59,949
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little ridiculous.

1053
01:18:59,969 --> 01:19:00,249
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know.

1054
01:19:00,309 --> 01:19:02,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially for a controller that's essentially defective.

1055
01:19:04,011 --> 01:19:04,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

1056
01:19:06,252 --> 01:19:09,953
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's travel around the world and see what you can waste your money on this week in the world of gaming.

1057
01:19:10,033 --> 01:19:10,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, we'll start with you.

1058
01:19:11,214 --> 01:19:14,015
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a couple things this week that are worth mentioning.

1059
01:19:14,275 --> 01:19:17,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, StarCraft II on PC is going to be a big thing.

1060
01:19:17,437 --> 01:19:17,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you think?

1061
01:19:18,237 --> 01:19:20,238
[SPEAKER_05]: StarCraft II, the Wings of Liberty.

1062
01:19:20,378 --> 01:19:22,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, there will be three versions of this game.

1063
01:19:24,269 --> 01:19:24,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

1064
01:19:25,030 --> 01:19:26,691
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see the point.

1065
01:19:26,711 --> 01:19:28,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they'll sell it three times to a lot of people.

1066
01:19:28,973 --> 01:19:34,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they'll try to sell it three times, but I don't think the second and third versions of the game will be that great.

1067
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:38,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but that will be coming out this week on PC.

1068
01:19:39,603 --> 01:19:44,327
[SPEAKER_05]: A game called Galaxy Racers coming to the DS thanks to Ubisoft.

1069
01:19:44,468 --> 01:19:47,490
[SPEAKER_05]: It is, just like it sounds, a game where you race through space.

1070
01:19:48,431 --> 01:20:04,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Clash of the Titans Coming out on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 Where you will release the Kraken Or at least fight the Kraken that is released upon you At least that's what I gather that movie is about Because that's all I ever see in the trailers Kraken being released

1071
01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:07,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1072
01:20:07,251 --> 01:20:11,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Chuck E. Cheese Party Games coming to the Wii.

1073
01:20:12,094 --> 01:20:12,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a hint, people.

1074
01:20:13,215 --> 01:20:16,857
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not really a brand new game, per se.

1075
01:20:18,478 --> 01:20:29,484
[SPEAKER_05]: The company UFO Interactive, they have taken these games called Smart Girls and Smart Boys Club and they've just re-skinned them with Chuck E. Cheese stuff.

1076
01:20:29,504 --> 01:20:33,086
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's really unfair to the dumb boys and the dumb girls of the world.

1077
01:20:35,268 --> 01:20:36,409
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, it's sad.

1078
01:20:37,149 --> 01:20:38,410
[SPEAKER_05]: But that will be coming to the Wii.

1079
01:20:39,071 --> 01:20:41,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Arkrise Fantasia also coming to the Wii.

1080
01:20:41,212 --> 01:20:44,314
[SPEAKER_05]: It's supposed to be a pretty awesome RPG.

1081
01:20:45,635 --> 01:20:51,239
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're into fighting games, BlazBlue Continuum Shift will be coming out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

1082
01:20:51,839 --> 01:20:54,681
[SPEAKER_05]: I do believe a PC version is going to be available soon as well.

1083
01:20:56,102 --> 01:21:00,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, if you know where to look, it's already been out there for months now.

1084
01:21:01,486 --> 01:21:03,147
[SPEAKER_05]: This arcade game used to run on PC hardware.

1085
01:21:06,708 --> 01:21:08,889
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's basically it.

1086
01:21:09,109 --> 01:21:12,709
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, oh my god, next week there's a whole bunch of junk.

1087
01:21:13,649 --> 01:21:16,750
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got a question, y'all, and I want to ask this of chat as well.

1088
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:17,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Should I buy StarCraft 2?

1089
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:21,191
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a part of me that kind of wants it.

1090
01:21:21,231 --> 01:21:26,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Despite all my anger at Blizzard the past month in this show, they do make some really good games.

1091
01:21:26,832 --> 01:21:32,633
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I'm terrible at RTSs, but I know some of my friends are buying this game, and they're not very good either.

1092
01:21:32,713 --> 01:21:34,453
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll have people to play with.

1093
01:21:34,753 --> 01:21:36,554
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what would look cool about StarCraft 2?

1094
01:21:37,014 --> 01:21:38,015
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the level editor.

1095
01:21:38,655 --> 01:21:40,696
[SPEAKER_05]: And all the fun stuff you could do with that.

1096
01:21:40,756 --> 01:21:43,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the Mario Kart type game and stuff like that.

1097
01:21:44,178 --> 01:21:45,219
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would be neat.

1098
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:50,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for one, I want to make sure... I kind of want to wait for the reviews of this game to come out.

1099
01:21:51,602 --> 01:21:54,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I want to see what they look like.

1100
01:21:54,183 --> 01:21:57,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know if my real name is going to show in the battles.

1101
01:21:57,805 --> 01:22:00,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see how far they took real ID in StarCraft 2.

1102
01:22:01,507 --> 01:22:17,478
[SPEAKER_05]: that'd be funny because like see like if I were to sign up on this I don't have an account or anything and no real name so I could just like create a character called Dicks McButt or something like that it's like you have to sign up for a Battle.net account to play StarCraft 2

1103
01:22:18,018 --> 01:22:40,420
[SPEAKER_02]: so you know and they would want you know your real name but you could always put you know Matt Loki is your name and I guess they'd really be none the wiser they wouldn't be so I don't know so I'm waiting to see what the game like as much as going to the midnight release might be kind of fun I'm gonna really resist that temptation and just like give it a week and just kind of see what the reception is and then I guess make my decision from there

1104
01:22:41,221 --> 01:22:54,426
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally would wait three months, two or three months, because, you know, during that first quarter after it comes out, all of the balance issues are going to come out, and they're just going to patch the hell out of it and nerf all the things that need to be nerfed.

1105
01:22:54,946 --> 01:22:59,128
[SPEAKER_03]: So wait three months and get a more even version of the game.

1106
01:22:59,228 --> 01:23:00,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Three months?

1107
01:23:00,448 --> 01:23:01,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

1108
01:23:01,289 --> 01:23:02,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Three months?

1109
01:23:02,229 --> 01:23:03,129
[SPEAKER_02]: That's too long.

1110
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:04,430
[SPEAKER_02]: In three months...

1111
01:23:04,890 --> 01:23:07,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Dance Central will be here and Cataclysm will be here.

1112
01:23:08,256 --> 01:23:09,578
[SPEAKER_02]: DC Universe will be on the way.

1113
01:23:09,598 --> 01:23:11,361
[SPEAKER_02]: I ain't going to have time in three months for no Starcraft.

1114
01:23:11,381 --> 01:23:13,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Cataclysm won't be here in three months, okay?

1115
01:23:13,604 --> 01:23:15,968
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to take at least four months.

1116
01:23:16,469 --> 01:23:17,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanksgiving Christmas.

1117
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:18,633
[SPEAKER_05]: When is Cataclysm coming out?

1118
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Technically fall right now.

1119
01:23:22,121 --> 01:23:22,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometime November.

1120
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:26,443
[SPEAKER_05]: But fall is the official date so far.

1121
01:23:27,483 --> 01:23:27,863
[SPEAKER_02]: So far.

1122
01:23:30,384 --> 01:23:34,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on to Japan and look at some of the release dates in Japan.

1123
01:23:35,767 --> 01:23:38,468
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw is linking me to a story that I want to get to later in our chatroom.

1124
01:23:38,508 --> 01:23:39,989
[SPEAKER_02]: I have that on the list for later.

1125
01:23:40,049 --> 01:23:41,709
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk more about StarCraft 2 later in the show.

1126
01:23:44,090 --> 01:23:46,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Shirzo in our chatroom says Dix McButt should be on the wiki.

1127
01:23:46,791 --> 01:23:47,632
[SPEAKER_02]: The Orange Launch Radio wiki.

1128
01:23:48,893 --> 01:23:51,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that can be your quintessential online name.

1129
01:23:52,396 --> 01:23:55,738
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I was just trying to think of something ridiculous.

1130
01:23:57,180 --> 01:24:00,522
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm able to think of things that are very ridiculous all the time.

1131
01:24:02,004 --> 01:24:04,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's move on to the Japanese release date.

1132
01:24:04,766 --> 01:24:07,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox 360, quite a bit now.

1133
01:24:07,068 --> 01:24:09,710
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had some quiet weeks, but now some more stuff is starting to come out.

1134
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:13,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Agares Senkei Zero Dawn of War is coming out in Japan on July 29th.

1135
01:24:14,794 --> 01:24:16,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Dating Sim Strike Witches, Shirogane no Tsubasa

1136
01:24:37,788 --> 01:24:44,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it looks like they are little cat girl anime chicks that turn into... Or no, they just happen to fly.

1137
01:24:44,851 --> 01:24:46,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess they have little jetpacks and they fly.

1138
01:24:47,092 --> 01:24:49,513
[SPEAKER_02]: So little cat girls that fly carrying guns.

1139
01:24:49,653 --> 01:24:54,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is like every anime fanboy's wet dream, so have fun with that.

1140
01:24:54,435 --> 01:24:59,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Supreme Commander 2 also comes out from Squeenix this week, July 29th on the Xbox 360.

1141
01:24:59,156 --> 01:25:02,538
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to finally see some busy weeks in Japan because it's been kind of slow the past few weeks.

1142
01:25:03,459 --> 01:25:12,772
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3 There's a new console coming out It's the PlayStation 3 Slim 160GB and 320GB models are coming out this week We will also be getting those here

[SPEAKER_02]: This is, they say it's for people that love Trinity Universe.

1146
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:31,580
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an RPG.

1147
01:25:31,801 --> 01:25:33,601
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the one where the consoles fight each other.

1148
01:25:33,621 --> 01:25:35,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the console battle game?

1149
01:25:35,041 --> 01:25:35,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes, yes, I do.

1150
01:25:35,781 --> 01:25:36,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, you're smart.

1151
01:25:37,002 --> 01:25:38,402
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember all these games.

1152
01:25:38,422 --> 01:25:39,222
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a good time.

1153
01:25:39,622 --> 01:25:50,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, uh... On the Wii, Sengoku Basara 3 comes out there as well, as well as a game called Meisaze Surimaster Sekai ni Challenge Hen.

1154
01:25:50,811 --> 01:25:55,395
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually a price reduction that's going into the best hits from Hudson there.

1155
01:25:55,515 --> 01:25:56,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what, Dekasports?

1156
01:25:57,256 --> 01:25:58,137
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of what it looks like.

1157
01:25:58,658 --> 01:26:00,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Dekasports 3 probably.

1158
01:26:00,339 --> 01:26:01,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, it's fishing.

1159
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:02,261
[SPEAKER_02]: It's their fishing sim.

1160
01:26:02,841 --> 01:26:05,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh... The hell is that called over here?

1161
01:26:06,324 --> 01:26:06,444

1162
01:26:08,761 --> 01:26:10,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, come on, it's a fishing game.

1163
01:26:10,021 --> 01:26:10,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

1164
01:26:10,742 --> 01:26:11,422
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fishing game.

1165
01:26:11,742 --> 01:26:14,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Fishing games have not been cool since the Dreamcast.

1166
01:26:14,323 --> 01:26:15,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they keep putting them out, though.

1167
01:26:15,883 --> 01:26:16,823
[SPEAKER_02]: On the PlayStation 2.

1168
01:26:17,984 --> 01:26:19,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there's still games coming out on PlayStation 2.

1169
01:26:20,344 --> 01:26:20,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what?

01:26:21,285 --> 01:26:22,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobunaga!

1171
01:26:22,345 --> 01:26:23,785
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, another Nobunaga game.

1172
01:26:23,865 --> 01:26:27,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobunaga no Yabu Kakushin with a power-up kit.

1173
01:26:27,366 --> 01:26:29,607
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a price reduction from Koei.

1174
01:26:29,847 --> 01:26:33,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the power-up kit is, but that's maybe some in-game stuff.

1175
01:26:33,768 --> 01:26:34,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1176
01:26:34,488 --> 01:26:36,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Natsuzora no Monologue.

1177
01:26:38,614 --> 01:26:41,545
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what that game is all about, but that's from Idea Factory.

1178
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:45,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Hatsune Miku Project Diva 2 Hatsune Miku

1179
01:27:10,019 --> 01:27:12,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Second Mix is coming out this week from Sega.

1180
01:27:12,961 --> 01:27:13,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy that.

1181
01:27:13,802 --> 01:27:17,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, lastly, there's a game called, yes, Slapstick Wonderland.

1182
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:24,829
[SPEAKER_02]: The full name of the game, Gaijusuka Art Design Class, Slapstick Wonderland.

1183
01:27:26,434 --> 01:27:28,575
[SPEAKER_02]: You are free to imagine whatever you want.

1184
01:27:29,435 --> 01:27:32,176
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's schoolgirls looking at sketchbooks.

1185
01:27:32,736 --> 01:27:39,139
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this one because there's these four anime girls looking at a sketchbook and they look all excited like there's pictures of peen in the sketchbook.

1186
01:27:39,479 --> 01:27:41,660
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's this one little girl over here who just don't care.

1187
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:43,080
[SPEAKER_02]: She's sipping on her sippy cup.

1188
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:45,241
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, I don't give a shit what these girls are looking at.

1189
01:27:45,261 --> 01:27:46,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care about the peen in here.

1190
01:27:47,522 --> 01:27:47,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1191
01:27:49,762 --> 01:27:50,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on to the UK.

1192
01:27:50,543 --> 01:27:50,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1193
01:27:52,364 --> 01:27:54,487
[SPEAKER_07]: In the UK, we have some releases.

1194
01:27:54,747 --> 01:27:56,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I've only got a few on my list, though.

1195
01:27:57,610 --> 01:27:59,512
[SPEAKER_07]: The 27th is Alan Wake, The Signal.

1196
01:28:00,614 --> 01:28:03,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Starcraft 2, Wings of Liberty, also on the 27th.

1197
01:28:03,777 --> 01:28:06,841
[SPEAKER_07]: And the 30th is Ship Simulator Extremes for PC.

1198
01:28:08,242 --> 01:28:09,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's about it.

1199
01:28:10,086 --> 01:28:15,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Two more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week, as DarkSakura has picked.

1200
01:28:16,149 --> 01:28:20,170
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting closer and closer to our 150th game in the classic game of the week.

1201
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:22,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Episode 400 will be the 150th game.

1202
01:28:22,311 --> 01:28:25,512
[SPEAKER_02]: We started on 250, because I looked at the wiki today, randomly.

1203
01:28:26,033 --> 01:28:26,753
[SPEAKER_02]: And you started this...

1204
01:28:27,413 --> 01:28:29,174
[SPEAKER_02]: You've had some segments.

1205
01:28:29,454 --> 01:28:33,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the early days of the show, you didn't really have a segment like that.

1206
01:28:34,137 --> 01:28:36,698
[SPEAKER_02]: But your regular segments didn't start until we did the podcast.

1207
01:28:36,718 --> 01:28:41,161
[SPEAKER_07]: There was the website of the week and my advice column.

1208
01:28:41,301 --> 01:28:42,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what to do if you get caught on fire.

1209
01:28:42,982 --> 01:28:49,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I was using my Worst Case Scenario Survivor Handbook calendar, which was great.

1210
01:28:50,206 --> 01:28:55,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Like how to deliver a baby and how to navigate a landmine and how to ride a camel.

1211
01:28:56,601 --> 01:29:22,727
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm liking your classic game of the week they've been very good I've actually been able to incorporate this into something for Geek Life too I do Tales from the Vault every Sunday I like how you've worked in yet another plug this week for Geek Life go you, geek-life.com yeah, but that one's the more specific about, you know memories around gaming the dash is important because you need to dash on over there I know, right?

1212
01:29:23,967 --> 01:29:25,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1213
01:29:25,969 --> 01:29:31,273
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's this game called Rock Band 3 that's supposed to be coming out this year sometime in the fall.

1214
01:29:31,614 --> 01:29:36,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we can kind of narrow it down to October 26th.

1215
01:29:37,318 --> 01:29:45,004
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be hitting the shelves in North America just in time for your Halloween parties where you need to rock out to stuff.

1216
01:29:47,266 --> 01:30:05,676
[SPEAKER_05]: and then of course with that obviously there's going to be different pre-order bonuses for wherever you decide to pre-order the game if you pre-order the title at Walmart you get a $10 e-gift card if you pre-order through Amazon they will unlock an exclusive in-game guitar for you

1217
01:30:07,225 --> 01:30:08,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay, that's worth it.

1218
01:30:09,607 --> 01:30:20,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Pre-orders with GameStop will be able to download three songs for free at launch, including My Own Summer by the Deftones, Blue Monday by New Order, and Burning Down the House by Talking Heads.

1219
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:21,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

1220
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:24,422
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it feel?

1221
01:30:26,144 --> 01:30:27,085
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to sing that song.

1222
01:30:27,305 --> 01:30:29,888
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, you need to have a rock band party when this game comes out.

1223
01:30:30,128 --> 01:30:30,528
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1224
01:30:31,894 --> 01:30:33,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting the keyboard, for sure.

1225
01:30:33,935 --> 01:30:40,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, again, please assure me, Mr. Guy who works at the distributor, please assure me I will be able to get keyboard plus game.

1226
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,360
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it, right?

1227
01:30:41,521 --> 01:30:42,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, absolutely.

1228
01:30:42,261 --> 01:30:43,562
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a bundle that is available.

1229
01:30:43,742 --> 01:30:47,565
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I don't believe they have full band bundles for this one.

1230
01:30:47,585 --> 01:30:57,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just the game by itself, and then I want to say maybe they may have a full bundle, but I haven't seen it.

1231
01:30:58,272 --> 01:30:58,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1232
01:30:59,853 --> 01:31:04,196
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know that the keyboard game bundle is out there.

1233
01:31:04,456 --> 01:31:10,199
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I believe that it's already available for pre-order through certain websites and with Stop.

1234
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:14,021
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, keyboard bundle, $130.

1235
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:14,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Pro guitar, $150.

1236
01:31:22,734 --> 01:31:24,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can buy the keyboard by itself for $80.

1237
01:31:25,936 --> 01:31:27,416
[SPEAKER_02]: What would I do with the keyboard by itself?

1238
01:31:27,477 --> 01:31:28,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a game to play.

1239
01:31:28,257 --> 01:31:30,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I could use it as a MIDI keyboard, but that's dumb.

1240
01:31:31,258 --> 01:31:33,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to play Blue Monday.

1241
01:31:33,820 --> 01:31:35,341
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it feel?

1242
01:31:35,761 --> 01:31:38,382
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's the Queen song, right?

1243
01:31:38,422 --> 01:31:39,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Bohemian Rhapsody?

1244
01:31:39,663 --> 01:31:40,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1245
01:31:40,223 --> 01:31:42,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, I can't wait to play these on Pro Expert.

1246
01:31:42,825 --> 01:31:46,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then once I learn how to do it, you can actually go to a real keyboard.

1247
01:31:46,947 --> 01:31:47,807
[SPEAKER_02]: What about that guitar though? $150.

1248
01:31:50,269 --> 01:31:51,009
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need it.

1249
01:31:51,189 --> 01:31:51,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need it.

1250
01:31:52,270 --> 01:31:53,330
[SPEAKER_02]: But there'll be some people that want it.

1251
01:31:54,211 --> 01:31:55,452
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some people that are pretty hardcore.

1252
01:31:56,612 --> 01:31:56,893
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1253
01:31:57,833 --> 01:32:01,135
[SPEAKER_02]: One more story from me for you guys, and that has to do with Comic-Con.

1254
01:32:01,255 --> 01:32:04,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, there has been like a games invasion at Comic-Con this year.

1255
01:32:04,878 --> 01:32:06,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots and lots of stuff being shown.

1256
01:32:06,178 --> 01:32:07,359
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to run down for you guys.

1257
01:32:07,619 --> 01:32:16,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's almost like half of Comic-Con is basically E3 all over again, but even some new stuff, as we heard earlier, with Street Fighter X Tekken and vice versa.

1258
01:32:16,665 --> 01:32:17,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1259
01:32:17,225 --> 01:32:46,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Activision is there Activision is showing off a Spider-Man game which I don't think made it to the cut for our show tonight but apparently I'm hearing a lot of early buzz on the Spider-Man game that it's going to blow all the others out of the water which won't take much but there you go they're also showing Guitar Hero and Call of Duty as well Capcom's there showing Marvel vs. Capcom 3 that's obviously their big big thing that they're pushing understandably but obviously they're going to work in plugs for Dead Rising 2 and El Camino and all this other stuff

1260
01:32:46,825 --> 01:32:48,106
[SPEAKER_02]: EA is apparently there too.

1261
01:32:48,486 --> 01:32:53,868
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually took Rock Band 3 to the show because, you know, when I think comic books, I think Rock Band 3 in my living room.

1262
01:32:54,648 --> 01:32:56,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Dead Space 2 is there.

1263
01:32:56,109 --> 01:33:00,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon Age 2 is supposedly there and playable, which is more than they had at E3.

1264
01:33:01,271 --> 01:33:02,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, yet another game.

1265
01:33:03,352 --> 01:33:04,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Hudson is there too.

1266
01:33:04,552 --> 01:33:06,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Bomberman Live apparently they're showing.

1267
01:33:07,093 --> 01:33:08,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami is there.

1268
01:33:09,014 --> 01:33:12,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Hideo Kojima, Nintendo, Metroid Other M, Dragon Quest IX, Sony Computer Entertainment, LittleBigPlanet 2, Killzone 3, Gran Turismo 5

1269
01:33:29,442 --> 01:33:30,123
[SPEAKER_02]: among other things.

1270
01:33:30,183 --> 01:33:34,865
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, Warner Brothers had to take Super Scribblenauts to their massive booth they have.

1271
01:33:35,865 --> 01:33:40,728
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Microsoft and Xbox took their Summer of Arcade lineup there.

1272
01:33:40,768 --> 01:33:46,971
[SPEAKER_02]: That of course includes Limbo, Hydro Thunder, the new Tomb Raider game, among other things.

1273
01:33:47,551 --> 01:33:48,912
[SPEAKER_02]: And THQ's there.

1274
01:33:49,312 --> 01:33:50,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots and lots of video games.

1275
01:33:50,953 --> 01:33:54,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Square Enix, I guess, is there showing off Final Fantasy IV Heroes of Light.

1276
01:33:54,915 --> 01:33:56,615
[SPEAKER_02]: No word on if they're showing 14, though.

1277
01:33:56,635 --> 01:33:59,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, by the way, I did give the beta another try this week.

1278
01:34:00,796 --> 01:34:00,917
[SPEAKER_02]: And?

1279
01:34:03,197 --> 01:34:04,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I got other stuff to play this fall.

1280
01:34:05,438 --> 01:34:05,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1281
01:34:06,138 --> 01:34:07,458
[SPEAKER_02]: No, sir, he did not like it.

1282
01:34:08,538 --> 01:34:09,879
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks really good.

1283
01:34:09,979 --> 01:34:10,599
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty.

1284
01:34:10,659 --> 01:34:11,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Gorgeous.

1285
01:34:11,039 --> 01:34:11,879
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really pretty.

1286
01:34:12,419 --> 01:34:17,361
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, a pretty painting.

1287
01:34:17,661 --> 01:34:18,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Wah, wah.

1288
01:34:19,494 --> 01:34:25,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XIV Final Fantasy XIV Final Fantasy XIV

1289
01:34:49,158 --> 01:34:50,299
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that description.

1290
01:34:50,379 --> 01:34:51,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that, too.

1291
01:34:51,899 --> 01:34:52,180
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1292
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:58,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, how about we stop looking at new games and take a trip down memory lane?

1293
01:34:59,403 --> 01:35:02,364
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a segment on the show here we call the Classic Game of the Week.

1294
01:35:02,724 --> 01:35:15,290
[SPEAKER_02]: And every week, DarkSakura likes to go into the vault and find one game that she's been playing and say, Hey, you kids and your comic cons and your newfangled stuff need to take a minute to respect...

1295
01:35:16,488 --> 01:35:18,149
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?

1296
01:35:18,169 --> 01:35:18,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Hydro Thunder!

1297
01:35:18,989 --> 01:35:19,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Hydro Thunder.

1298
01:35:19,510 --> 01:35:22,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me fire up some music here from Hydro Thunder.

1299
01:35:22,131 --> 01:35:22,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Hydro, choose your track!

1300
01:35:22,912 --> 01:35:23,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Arctic Circle!

1301
01:35:45,726 --> 01:35:47,790
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the sequel this weekend.

1302
01:35:57,265 --> 01:35:58,205
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the name of that ship.

1303
01:35:58,405 --> 01:35:59,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn the torpedoes.

1304
01:35:59,806 --> 01:36:02,347
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the one that Dan would always use.

1305
01:36:03,087 --> 01:36:06,108
[SPEAKER_07]: At any rate, it was part of the Thunder series of games.

1306
01:36:06,188 --> 01:36:10,789
[SPEAKER_07]: This game came out in 1999 and had a Dreamcast release.

1307
01:36:11,629 --> 01:36:14,830
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it came out for PlayStation and Nintendo 64 in 2000.

1308
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:20,652
[SPEAKER_07]: The other Thunder games is Offroad Thunder, Four Wheel Thunder, and Arctic Thunder, which Arctic Thunder is pretty damn fun.

1309
01:36:21,829 --> 01:36:24,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, it's racing with boats.

1310
01:36:25,411 --> 01:36:31,334
[SPEAKER_07]: You have places like the Arctic Circle, and you have New York Disaster, which is sort of a post-apocalyptic.

1311
01:36:31,714 --> 01:36:37,277
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got the Greek Isles and Thunder Park, which is like a whole rally type of setting with water.

1312
01:36:38,937 --> 01:36:41,739
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got different booths all over the place.

1313
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:44,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Ones that will...

1314
01:36:46,421 --> 01:36:47,282
[SPEAKER_07]: The Red Ones, um...

1315
01:36:55,927 --> 01:37:23,876
[SPEAKER_07]: they give you more fuel as opposed to the blue ones so you do have a fuel gauge at least as far as your boosts are concerned and then with boosting you can actually do jumps or you can knock boats sort of off the track and it's pretty cool the arcade cabinet was the same type of cabinet as Cruisin' USA and Off-Road Thunder except it didn't have the flip pedals that use the throttle

1316
01:37:25,036 --> 01:37:38,264
[SPEAKER_07]: and, um, it had, um, an interesting type of volume deal where, um... He just ran over a penguin, that bastard!

1317
01:37:38,284 --> 01:37:40,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying.

1318
01:37:40,825 --> 01:37:44,708
[SPEAKER_07]: It had a subwoofer in the seat, so you could feel like you were actually on a boat.

1319
01:37:45,308 --> 01:37:46,249
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on a boat!

1320
01:37:47,631 --> 01:37:52,097
[SPEAKER_07]: With your boats, you had the easy ones, you had four categories.

1321
01:37:52,617 --> 01:37:55,982
[SPEAKER_07]: There were easy, medium, hard, and bonus.

1322
01:37:57,063 --> 01:38:01,729
[SPEAKER_07]: With easy, you had damn the torpedoes, midway, and misbehave.

1323
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:03,852
[SPEAKER_07]: It had a big fan instead of a propeller.

1324
01:38:04,412 --> 01:38:10,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Medium Boats, you had Banshee, Tidal Blade, Thresher.

1325
01:38:11,716 --> 01:38:16,259
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Tidal Blade is the cover for the Dreamcast thing.

1326
01:38:16,319 --> 01:38:23,023
[SPEAKER_07]: The hard ones, you had Cutthroat, Radhazard, that was sort of like UFO, and Razorback.

1327
01:38:25,685 --> 01:38:28,246
[SPEAKER_07]: That one was on the PlayStation and 1064 ones.

1328
01:38:28,626 --> 01:38:31,128
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you pick one of those, they say, you're crazy.

1329
01:38:34,147 --> 01:38:35,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, your mic cut out again.

1330
01:38:36,388 --> 01:38:37,848
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1331
01:38:38,288 --> 01:38:39,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Something is weird in that connection.

1332
01:38:39,789 --> 01:38:40,469
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is.

1333
01:38:40,769 --> 01:38:43,010
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll use the other one.

1334
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:44,551
[SPEAKER_02]: How's this?

1335
01:38:45,271 --> 01:38:47,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.

1336
01:38:47,752 --> 01:38:53,033
[SPEAKER_07]: With the bonus boats, you had Tiny Tanic, which was a small version of the Titanic.

1337
01:38:53,654 --> 01:38:57,575
[SPEAKER_07]: And you had the Blowfish and Chumdinger, which was a fishing boat.

1338
01:38:58,335 --> 01:38:59,996
[SPEAKER_07]: It would actually bark at the other boats.

1339
01:39:00,396 --> 01:39:03,597
[SPEAKER_07]: You also have Armed Response, which is the police boats with the turret guns.

1340
01:39:06,270 --> 01:39:08,112
[SPEAKER_07]: There was all the different tracks, like I mentioned.

1341
01:39:08,132 --> 01:39:13,536
[SPEAKER_07]: We had Thunder Park, Lost Island, The Arctic Circle, then going into Medium, we had Lake Powell, which is one that was really fun.

1342
01:39:14,237 --> 01:39:19,481
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a lake in the middle of Utah that's actually the same Lake Powell is supposed to be.

1343
01:39:20,182 --> 01:39:29,450
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a Far East, Greek Isles, and then the hard tracks, there was Ship Graveyard, Venice Canals, and New York Disaster, which New York Disaster was actually kind of my favorite.

1344
01:39:29,870 --> 01:39:41,515
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the bonus ones, you had Castle Von Dandy, Nile Adventure, which was the longest tracking game, Catacombs, and Hydra Speedway, which was the one that was the rally style.

1345
01:39:44,196 --> 01:39:47,057
[SPEAKER_07]: There were different versions, of course.

1346
01:39:47,818 --> 01:39:49,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, there was the Dreamcast one.

1347
01:39:49,779 --> 01:39:53,020
[SPEAKER_07]: The PlayStation one had a career mode in it.

1348
01:39:53,740 --> 01:39:57,242
[SPEAKER_07]: The Dreamcast, though, was closest to the arcade of any of the consoles.

1349
01:39:57,742 --> 01:40:03,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo 64 version was actually amazingly fun and really good for what it was.

1350
01:40:03,425 --> 01:40:06,746
[SPEAKER_07]: It had a four-player multiplayer instead of two-player.

1351
01:40:07,687 --> 01:40:10,848
[SPEAKER_07]: And you could do that with the Nintendo 64 expansion pack.

1352
01:40:11,469 --> 01:40:14,590
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Dreamcast version is the one that's on Midway Arcade Treasures 3.

1353
01:40:15,891 --> 01:40:17,872
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also a PC version that was out in Europe.

1354
01:40:18,972 --> 01:40:21,934
[SPEAKER_07]: The Dreamcast version was one of the Sega All-Star titles.

1355
01:40:22,994 --> 01:40:23,135
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

1356
01:40:25,395 --> 01:40:52,123
[SPEAKER_07]: there is going to be a sequel out well there's a spiritual sequel already out called H2 Overdrive which is pretty fun the original team that worked on Hydro Thunder did H2 Overdrive through Raw Thrills and then Hydro Thunder Hurricane is going to be out on Xbox Live Arcade and Microsoft bought the rights after Midway was acquired by Warner Brothers so there you have it

1357
01:40:55,071 --> 01:40:58,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, your classic game of the week, Hydro Thunder.

1358
01:40:58,353 --> 01:40:59,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn the torpedoes.

1359
01:41:01,975 --> 01:41:02,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Good pick.

1360
01:41:02,955 --> 01:41:07,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember playing this at RVGL to cool off between DDR.

1361
01:41:07,357 --> 01:41:11,460
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is one game that Dan picked out that I actually went with.

1362
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:12,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1363
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:13,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you, Dan.

1364
01:41:14,681 --> 01:41:16,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Since he's not here, butthead.

1365
01:41:16,602 --> 01:41:19,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he should be listening to this show every week.

1366
01:41:20,515 --> 01:41:20,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1367
01:41:20,955 --> 01:41:21,235
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1368
01:41:21,575 --> 01:41:24,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, that's going to do it for Part A here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1369
01:41:24,237 --> 01:41:26,037
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, we have plenty more show to go.

1370
01:41:26,077 --> 01:41:34,801
[SPEAKER_02]: We got your Twitter topics coming up in Part B. We're going to be talking Mega Man Universe, a little more about StarCraft II, Phantasy Star Universe.

1371
01:41:35,161 --> 01:41:39,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, a four-year-old game we'll be talking about as well because there's some new news and, of course, our rapid-fire news.

1372
01:41:40,463 --> 01:41:44,065
[SPEAKER_02]: All when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1373
01:41:50,293 --> 01:41:52,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1374
01:42:16,974 --> 01:42:17,614
[SPEAKER_02]: All that good stuff.

1375
01:42:17,634 --> 01:42:19,795
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll get into Twitter topics in just a little bit.

1376
01:42:20,035 --> 01:42:22,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we have to do Rapid Fire News in just a moment.

1377
01:42:22,796 --> 01:42:24,137
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to talk about this real quick.

1378
01:42:24,857 --> 01:42:32,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember last week on the show we had a story about the Kmart was going to start to post reviews from their website.

1379
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:34,120
[SPEAKER_02]: They would actually post them on the shelves of the story.

1380
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:35,381
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys remember us talking about this?

1381
01:42:35,781 --> 01:42:35,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1382
01:42:36,281 --> 01:42:37,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, apparently –

1383
01:42:39,262 --> 01:42:49,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we told our listeners that they should start writing these completely nonsensical, like stupid things and submit them into the Kmart reviews and that would be really funny just to like flood their reviews with a bunch of dumb stuff.

1384
01:42:49,766 --> 01:42:52,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we had at least one listener submit one review.

1385
01:42:52,887 --> 01:42:55,028
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you to that one individual who did.

1386
01:42:55,788 --> 01:42:57,509
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt sent this in.

1387
01:42:57,549 --> 01:42:57,989
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

1388
01:42:58,049 --> 01:43:03,311
[SPEAKER_02]: He submitted a review of Red Dead Redemption and it's on the PlayStation 3 and I love this.

1389
01:43:03,811 --> 01:43:07,993
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to check this out because you Bomani fans will get a kick out of this.

1390
01:43:08,493 --> 01:43:10,273
[SPEAKER_02]: This game is Dynamite Rave.

1391
01:43:10,373 --> 01:43:11,974
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a review by Mr. Spanky.

1392
01:43:12,774 --> 01:43:15,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, I can't stop falling in love with this game.

1393
01:43:15,554 --> 01:43:21,335
[SPEAKER_02]: This game has you go west to play the hero and tackle the hysteria of the end of the century Wild West.

1394
01:43:21,775 --> 01:43:26,976
[SPEAKER_02]: You can drop out of the story mode at any time and dive into the online multiplayer with your friends.

1395
01:43:27,476 --> 01:43:28,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Be for you.

1396
01:43:28,316 --> 01:43:29,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Head over to buy this.

1397
01:43:29,677 --> 01:43:34,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Be sure to bring your ID to show to the kind lady at Kmart because it's rated M for Mature.

1398
01:43:34,757 --> 01:43:35,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Put your faith in me.

1399
01:43:36,158 --> 01:43:37,738
[SPEAKER_02]: This game is sweet like candy.

1400
01:43:38,138 --> 01:43:38,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Alsoholic.

1401
01:43:40,238 --> 01:43:43,499
[SPEAKER_02]: So you should proceed immediately to Kmart's website and upvote that review.

1402
01:43:43,919 --> 01:43:45,339
[SPEAKER_02]: And write more, because that's great.

1403
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:50,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I know not everybody's going to get that joke, but for the Bomani folks, that's awesome.

1404
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:53,181
[SPEAKER_02]: For those that don't, go write something even worse.

1405
01:43:54,041 --> 01:43:55,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times on Kmart reviews.

1406
01:43:56,222 --> 01:43:59,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's get into the rapid fire news and some actual gaming news that happened this week.

1407
01:44:00,322 --> 01:44:02,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff we have in short little bites for you guys.

1408
01:44:02,703 --> 01:44:02,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

1409
01:44:04,529 --> 01:44:05,770
[SPEAKER_05]: 7 part epic, 2112

1410
01:44:32,490 --> 01:44:50,699
[SPEAKER_05]: and uh i guess it's a few parts that are progressive rock and then uh i don't know i've never heard the song but that's a long ass song 20 minutes that's ridiculous that's almost like that one achievement in rock band that you have to play like every single song in the game and it takes on like an hour or two

1411
01:44:51,926 --> 01:44:55,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that makes me think of Inigata... Is my mic working?

1412
01:44:55,167 --> 01:44:56,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I think barely.

1413
01:44:57,548 --> 01:44:59,068
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wired for Jamie, not you.

1414
01:44:59,248 --> 01:45:01,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Try giving that one to Jamie and use that one.

1415
01:45:01,589 --> 01:45:02,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Live radio, yay.

1416
01:45:02,509 --> 01:45:12,533
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as epic songs for a rock band, since they have a keyboard, they should do Inigata De Vida, which I think is a good 23 minutes with the keyboards.

1417
01:45:13,013 --> 01:45:13,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

1418
01:45:14,573 --> 01:45:16,514
[SPEAKER_07]: That song is one whole hallucination.

1419
01:45:19,368 --> 01:45:24,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Something else that was at Comic-Con this week, and I don't even know why it was at Comic-Con.

1420
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:27,251
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Kencha Hulk type of stuff.

1421
01:45:27,651 --> 01:45:34,373
[SPEAKER_05]: But apparently they had a game from an independent developer called Bobo's.

1422
01:45:35,353 --> 01:46:02,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Big Adventure and you may not remember Abobo but sadly I think I do Abobo is from Double Dragon yes and Abobo's Big Adventure has him going through a bunch of 8-bit NES classics kind of parody style it is a PC game but they had it displayed on a cabinet I would like to read this brief I'm sure this game is extremely legal

1423
01:46:03,382 --> 01:46:06,426
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1424
01:46:24,026 --> 01:46:25,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1425
01:46:39,947 --> 01:46:42,551
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like all of NES stuff was out to get him.

1426
01:46:43,573 --> 01:46:55,210
[SPEAKER_05]: It only felt better when an 8-bit bystander walked up to Bobo and he ripped his head off and ate it and then used his body to fight a charging skateboarder from TNC Surf.

1427
01:46:55,615 --> 01:46:55,935
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1428
01:46:57,736 --> 01:47:03,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Another level called Super Mabobo found Bobo in a jail cell.

1429
01:47:04,078 --> 01:47:07,639
[SPEAKER_05]: After picking up trash and eating it, Bobo had to use the cell toilet.

1430
01:47:08,159 --> 01:47:17,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Something he ate must not have been agreed with him because a massive vertical column of shit came out of his ass and somehow had him flying over the toilet and falling down into...

1431
01:47:20,024 --> 01:47:21,506
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just making this up.

1432
01:47:38,705 --> 01:47:44,110
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like a bunch of 19-year-olds got really high one night.

1433
01:47:44,671 --> 01:47:47,774
[SPEAKER_02]: And in between eating Cheetos, they just started talking.

1434
01:47:48,215 --> 01:47:50,998
[SPEAKER_13]: And somebody was like, dude, dude, that's really good.

1435
01:47:51,038 --> 01:47:53,680
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, that's hella funny, dude.

1436
01:47:54,001 --> 01:47:55,362
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, you should write that down.

1437
01:47:55,622 --> 01:47:55,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude.

1438
01:47:56,163 --> 01:47:56,924
[SPEAKER_13]: And they did.

1439
01:47:57,324 --> 01:48:01,188
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like things to get posted to Newgrounds when you're blackout drunk, basically.

1440
01:48:01,248 --> 01:48:06,072
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny that you should mention that at Newgrounds, because that's where this game will be featured at some point.

1441
01:48:06,132 --> 01:48:07,173
[SPEAKER_02]: What a surprise!

1442
01:48:07,674 --> 01:48:09,235
[SPEAKER_05]: What a goddamn surprise!

1443
01:48:09,916 --> 01:48:12,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna fall over and die from that surprise.

1444
01:48:13,419 --> 01:48:18,064
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, Bobo's Big Adventure is supposed to be out in December.

1445
01:48:18,224 --> 01:48:20,286
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks funny, I guess.

1446
01:48:20,486 --> 01:48:20,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1447
01:48:22,228 --> 01:48:26,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then finally... That plot he read sounded like the plot to The Poop That Took a Pee.

1448
01:48:29,441 --> 01:48:30,422
[SPEAKER_02]: The Poop That Took a Pee.

1449
01:48:30,723 --> 01:48:31,885
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on an episode of South Park.

1450
01:48:31,925 --> 01:48:32,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that.

1451
01:48:33,307 --> 01:48:34,690
[SPEAKER_02]: As narrated by Morgan Freeman.

1452
01:48:36,628 --> 01:48:36,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

1453
01:48:36,768 --> 01:48:37,489
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Morgan Freeman?

1454
01:48:37,589 --> 01:48:38,670
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Morgan Freeman.

1455
01:48:39,110 --> 01:48:40,731
[SPEAKER_02]: The Pope that took a pee.

1456
01:48:42,532 --> 01:48:44,233
[SPEAKER_05]: By Leopold Butterscotch.

1457
01:48:45,154 --> 01:48:45,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything.

1458
01:48:47,035 --> 01:48:52,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Legend of Mana is going to be the next game hitting the Japanese PlayStation 1 classics.

1459
01:48:52,219 --> 01:48:52,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1460
01:48:53,079 --> 01:48:55,121
[SPEAKER_05]: On the PlayStation Network, of course.

1461
01:48:57,803 --> 01:48:58,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Legend of Mana.

1462
01:48:58,563 --> 01:49:00,925
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be out next week.

1463
01:49:00,946 --> 01:49:02,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Worst game ever.

1464
01:49:02,647 --> 01:49:03,208
[SPEAKER_05]: For $600 to $650.

1465
01:49:03,668 --> 01:49:08,172
[SPEAKER_05]: That means it's going to be to other regions soon.

1466
01:49:10,014 --> 01:49:15,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of poops that took a pee, Legend of Mana is seriously my least favorite PlayStation game.

1467
01:49:15,919 --> 01:49:18,362
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so disappointed in that game.

1468
01:49:18,422 --> 01:49:22,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize it has its fans and what have you, but I was expecting...

1469
01:49:23,326 --> 01:49:26,248
[SPEAKER_02]: What I think was really, and keep in mind, this was many years ago.

1470
01:49:26,289 --> 01:49:28,911
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know there was this whole import gaming scene and everything.

1471
01:49:29,211 --> 01:49:36,257
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my mind, what really was second Datsetsu 3, I thought was what I was going to get with Legend of Mana.

1472
01:49:36,337 --> 01:49:38,619
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was like, I don't understand.

1473
01:49:38,719 --> 01:49:40,180
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this?

1474
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:42,181
[SPEAKER_02]: But you liked it, didn't you, Alan?

1475
01:49:42,201 --> 01:49:42,902
[SPEAKER_02]: You were telling me one day.

1476
01:49:42,962 --> 01:49:43,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.

1477
01:49:43,763 --> 01:49:44,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I did like it.

1478
01:49:44,663 --> 01:49:45,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I played it all the way through.

1479
01:49:45,764 --> 01:49:47,025
[SPEAKER_02]: I did every little stupid quest.

1480
01:49:47,045 --> 01:49:48,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Gosh, you probably like Saga Frontier, too.

1481
01:49:49,435 --> 01:49:51,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I had the Japanese one.

1482
01:49:51,877 --> 01:49:54,439
[SPEAKER_07]: That game was terrible.

1483
01:49:54,559 --> 01:49:57,722
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so heavy language-wise, I couldn't play it very well.

1484
01:49:59,243 --> 01:50:00,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like the Saga series, too?

1485
01:50:01,124 --> 01:50:01,785
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not really.

1486
01:50:02,626 --> 01:50:07,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I was really excited about Saga Frontier because it made it sound like Chrono Trigger with the combo attacks.

1487
01:50:09,111 --> 01:50:11,533
[SPEAKER_03]: And I played it, and yeah, that was pretty awful.

1488
01:50:12,053 --> 01:50:12,914
[SPEAKER_03]: It lasted an hour.

1489
01:50:13,474 --> 01:50:14,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it lasted about an hour, too.

1490
01:50:14,615 --> 01:50:15,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, this game's terrible.

1491
01:50:16,161 --> 01:50:16,441
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1492
01:50:17,142 --> 01:50:18,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, let's move on to some other quick news.

1493
01:50:19,465 --> 01:50:23,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, up there in Canada, you're going to be getting Netflix finally.

1494
01:50:24,350 --> 01:50:25,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I'm talking about Canada.

1495
01:50:25,852 --> 01:50:26,713
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not that stupid.

1496
01:50:27,333 --> 01:50:29,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada is finally getting Netflix.

1497
01:50:29,836 --> 01:50:30,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I got to be honest.

1498
01:50:30,877 --> 01:50:32,860
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize they didn't already have it.

1499
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:33,861
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1500
01:50:55,038 --> 01:50:59,822
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll be able to get this in Canada on the 360, the PS3, and Wii.

1501
01:51:00,142 --> 01:51:07,188
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're being a little vague on if it's going to be the exact same movies and so forth because of clearances and so forth.

1502
01:51:07,548 --> 01:51:22,440
[SPEAKER_02]: But they do give you the nice little marketing fluff of Canadian Netflix members will be able to instantly watch a broad array of movies and TV episodes right on their TVs via a range of consumer electronic devices capable of streaming from Netflix as well as PCs and Macs.

1503
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:23,081
[SPEAKER_02]: So

1504
01:51:24,061 --> 01:51:30,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're going to be getting it, but it's probably not going to look the exact same as it does here, at least not right away.

1505
01:51:33,368 --> 01:51:52,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Joystick had emailed Netflix looking for comment, and Netflix responded to the big blog, We're not announcing the Netflix-ready devices until the service launches, but it's fair to assume that several popular brand-name devices will be capable of streaming from Netflix to TVs at launch, in addition to the ability to watch instantly on computers, and that will add to the family of devices over time.

1506
01:51:53,961 --> 01:51:55,603
[SPEAKER_02]: So hooray for you guys in Canada, I suppose.

1507
01:51:56,584 --> 01:52:01,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants vs. Zombies is going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, finally.

1508
01:52:01,649 --> 01:52:02,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Early September.

1509
01:52:02,850 --> 01:52:06,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I played this on an iPad this week a little bit, because I was looking at an iPad.

1510
01:52:07,295 --> 01:52:09,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to buy one, and then I thought...

1511
01:52:11,697 --> 01:52:13,198
[SPEAKER_02]: I already have an iPod.

1512
01:52:30,009 --> 01:52:33,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Castlevania Puzzle Encore of the Night is now available on the App Store.

1513
01:52:33,951 --> 01:52:36,692
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually getting pretty decent reviews, so I checked it out.

1514
01:52:37,033 --> 01:52:43,176
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been able to play it myself, but just if you were curious, it is now available on the App Store, so I'll have to check that out at some point.

1515
01:52:43,756 --> 01:52:46,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly, I can't do it right now because I'm trying to do a show.

1516
01:52:46,698 --> 01:52:47,198
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

1517
01:52:48,576 --> 01:52:57,401
[SPEAKER_07]: In other news, we have LittleBigPlanet 2 dated for the 16th of November here in the U.S.

1518
01:52:59,122 --> 01:53:00,443
[SPEAKER_07]: The European date's not out yet.

1519
01:53:01,304 --> 01:53:05,606
[SPEAKER_07]: And the collector's edition will have a plushie sack boy and bookends.

1520
01:53:08,547 --> 01:53:17,837
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be different pre-order and exclusive costumes and five LittleBigPlanet 2 PlayStation Network avatars, which should be $80.

1521
01:53:18,778 --> 01:53:20,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Something sounds gross about plushy sack boy.

1522
01:53:22,979 --> 01:53:24,620
[SPEAKER_07]: If you squeeze him, he goes plush on you.

1523
01:53:27,722 --> 01:53:37,950
[SPEAKER_07]: And then for our downloads for the UK, we've got 3D Space Tank, DSiWare, also known as Xscape.

1524
01:53:40,551 --> 01:53:41,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we've got...

1525
01:53:42,953 --> 01:53:46,896
[SPEAKER_07]: As soon as it loads, because my computer's slow.

1526
01:53:47,577 --> 01:53:50,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Minor Disturbance, M-I-N-E-R, which is for iPhone.

1527
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:52,761
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 99 pence.

1528
01:53:54,542 --> 01:53:58,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Astro Dodge, which is also for iPhone, for £1.24.

1529
01:53:58,826 --> 01:53:59,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, it's taking a while.

1530
01:54:00,007 --> 01:54:05,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Pearl Harbor Trilogy, 1941, Red Sun Rising for WiiWare, 700 Wii Points.

1531
01:54:10,955 --> 01:54:15,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Crossfire, Xbox Live Indie Games, and that's it.

1532
01:54:16,858 --> 01:54:31,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, we also have other cool news for those of us who are Capcom fans, is that they're doing an online version of Street Fighter III Third Strike, which they're calling it...

1533
01:54:32,066 --> 01:55:01,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Street Fighter 3 Third Strike Online which is an update to the Dreamcast one but you want to know what they already made it and I already own it it was the for matching service you remember how when everything has a long title I usually end for matching service on it that's it it came out in Japan already so I've already got it yeah but most people over here never heard of it so you know with the success of their online games I'm assuming they're just giving this the old Xbox Live Arcade update correct

1534
01:55:01,658 --> 01:55:02,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, pretty much.

1535
01:55:04,859 --> 01:55:06,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that mic sucks, Jamie.

1536
01:55:06,420 --> 01:55:07,160
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what to say.

1537
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:13,222
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's probably me because my voice isn't very... No, I mean you cut completely out.

1538
01:55:13,302 --> 01:55:13,882
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the cord.

1539
01:55:13,922 --> 01:55:14,542
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not your voice.

1540
01:55:15,283 --> 01:55:16,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, shit.

1541
01:55:16,543 --> 01:55:18,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, huh?

1542
01:55:18,704 --> 01:55:19,724
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take Alan's mic.

1543
01:55:20,324 --> 01:55:20,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1544
01:55:20,944 --> 01:55:22,005
[SPEAKER_07]: You're being nice for sharing.

1545
01:55:22,665 --> 01:55:25,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on to some Twitter topics.

1546
01:55:27,421 --> 01:55:29,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1547
01:55:29,383 --> 01:55:32,727
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys send us tweets every week and we respond to them live on air.

1548
01:55:32,768 --> 01:55:34,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there's stories we didn't get around to sharing.

1549
01:55:35,491 --> 01:55:37,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows what it's all about.

1550
01:55:37,653 --> 01:55:40,277
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to start off with Deathwishing tonight.

1551
01:55:40,697 --> 01:55:43,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys hate Kotek2, the evil CEO?

1552
01:55:43,761 --> 01:55:46,484
[SPEAKER_02]: He's my least favorite human being next to Aquaman.

1553
01:55:47,565 --> 01:55:48,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we hate Bobby Kotick?

1554
01:55:48,626 --> 01:55:50,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Hate is a strong word.

1555
01:55:50,046 --> 01:55:50,987
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes.

1556
01:55:51,527 --> 01:55:52,608
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes.

1557
01:55:53,668 --> 01:55:55,909
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw305 sends us a link.

1558
01:55:55,949 --> 01:55:56,970
[SPEAKER_02]: He always sends us great links.

1559
01:55:57,370 --> 01:56:00,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Disney is in talks apparently to buy Playdom.

1560
01:56:00,492 --> 01:56:04,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Playdom, by the way, made such awesome Facebook games like Sorority Life.

1561
01:56:05,374 --> 01:56:07,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Disney bought what?

1562
01:56:07,375 --> 01:56:07,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Tapulous?

1563
01:56:08,335 --> 01:56:10,656
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now Disney is in talks with Playdom.

1564
01:56:11,096 --> 01:56:14,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy them out for $500 million is what they're saying.

1565
01:56:15,317 --> 01:56:21,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, these are all rumors, but Disney's going to use this company to incorporate its popular brands and characters into social games.

1566
01:56:22,559 --> 01:56:24,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Playdom, by the way, is based out of Mountain View, California.

1567
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:25,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I never knew that.

1568
01:56:25,960 --> 01:56:26,721
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not that far away.

1569
01:56:27,841 --> 01:56:28,761
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there you go.

1570
01:56:28,901 --> 01:56:32,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently Disney might use its ESPN brands on some of this as well.

1571
01:56:32,923 --> 01:56:33,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Could be very interesting.

1572
01:56:34,483 --> 01:56:40,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Playdom ranks third behind Zynga and Playfish, by the way, just so you know, of big social game companies.

1573
01:56:42,509 --> 01:56:42,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1574
01:56:44,850 --> 01:56:49,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Some folks retweeting our congratulatory message to Bobby.

1575
01:56:49,253 --> 01:56:49,933
[SPEAKER_02]: So, congrats, Bobby.

1576
01:56:50,854 --> 01:56:51,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1577
01:56:51,114 --> 01:56:56,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Spazinator says, Do you think we'll ever see a Mortal Kombat vs. Street Fighter game?

1578
01:56:57,177 --> 01:56:59,559
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a lot of talk tonight about Street Fighter X Tekken.

1579
01:56:59,999 --> 01:57:08,864
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the two ultimate, I guess in some regards, maybe even top, if you dare go there, fighting game franchises, Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat?

1580
01:57:08,884 --> 01:57:09,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Could it ever happen?

1581
01:57:09,865 --> 01:57:10,465
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think?

1582
01:57:10,745 --> 01:57:12,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Could Street Fighter vs. Mortal Kombat ever happen?

1583
01:57:12,426 --> 01:57:15,768
[SPEAKER_05]: It could if they play nice with Warner.

1584
01:57:15,788 --> 01:57:19,770
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, obviously they're playing nice with other publishers.

1585
01:57:22,271 --> 01:57:23,212
[SPEAKER_05]: It could happen.

1586
01:57:23,912 --> 01:57:25,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether it will happen or not, I don't know.

1587
01:57:25,933 --> 01:57:37,479
[SPEAKER_07]: I think someone did a Mugen one where they took the Street Fighter movie ones and the old Mortal Kombat that were all the image capture and did a Mugen version.

1588
01:57:38,140 --> 01:57:39,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Just do Thrill Kill again.

1589
01:58:05,600 --> 01:58:06,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Thrill Kill was horrible.

1590
01:58:07,282 --> 01:58:11,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, see, I don't see a game where Sakura gets her spine ripped out.

1591
01:58:11,627 --> 01:58:13,529
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I can't, I can't.

1592
01:58:13,769 --> 01:58:14,950
[SPEAKER_02]: There is something wrong with that.

1593
01:58:15,051 --> 01:58:20,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how would you feel about that, DarkSakura, if there was a game where you could just, like, totally rip Sakura's arms off?

1594
01:58:21,658 --> 01:58:25,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, as long as they included a non-blacked out Shingo Kusatsu.

1595
01:58:27,539 --> 01:58:29,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn it!

1596
01:58:29,421 --> 01:58:32,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I in now?

1597
01:58:33,065 --> 01:58:33,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1598
01:58:33,425 --> 01:58:33,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1599
01:58:34,766 --> 01:58:49,280
[SPEAKER_07]: I was basically saying if they included a non-blacked out version of the Shingo Kusatsu with all kinds of beating up and breaking noses and bones and having it be really destructive and leave them as a bloody pulp, then maybe I could deal with it.

1600
01:58:50,922 --> 01:59:07,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know there just would have to be too much compromise one way or the other I just don't see like Street Fighter and Tekken kind of makes sense and as much as I love Soul Calibur like it wouldn't make sense like the Street Fighter people don't use weapons weapons are a huge part of Soul Calibur it wouldn't make sense so but Street Fighter, Tekken yeah I get that I get it

1601
01:59:08,928 --> 01:59:10,129
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's see.

1602
01:59:10,269 --> 01:59:14,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Other comments on our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

1603
01:59:16,234 --> 01:59:17,675
[SPEAKER_02]: SJ100Matt is sending us a tweet.

1604
01:59:18,035 --> 01:59:21,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Capcom jumping the shark releasing all of these versus games all at once?

1605
01:59:22,299 --> 01:59:24,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited, but this should have happened 10 years ago.

1606
01:59:26,033 --> 01:59:27,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, thank Street Fighter 4.

1607
01:59:28,515 --> 01:59:31,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly think Street Fighter 4 is the reason for a lot of this.

1608
01:59:31,677 --> 01:59:37,121
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the really warm reception the community had to this kind of made them decide to listen to the fans a little more.

1609
01:59:37,221 --> 01:59:41,263
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they are just giving fans what they want left and right.

1610
01:59:41,343 --> 01:59:43,005
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like, what game do you want?

1611
01:59:43,305 --> 01:59:44,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, here you go then.

1612
01:59:45,566 --> 01:59:47,728
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of where Capcom is going lately, you know.

1613
01:59:49,109 --> 01:59:49,709
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

1614
01:59:49,769 --> 01:59:52,511
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, do you think this is too much or not enough or what?

1615
01:59:53,031 --> 01:59:54,512
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's just right.

1616
01:59:54,933 --> 01:59:55,273
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1617
01:59:56,627 --> 01:59:59,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, and last tweet from RockmanRock.

1618
02:00:00,649 --> 02:00:01,950
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a redundant name at all.

1619
02:00:01,970 --> 02:00:02,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that name.

1620
02:00:02,571 --> 02:00:03,411
[SPEAKER_02]: RockmanRock.

1621
02:00:04,152 --> 02:00:05,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you guys so awesome?

1622
02:00:06,093 --> 02:00:06,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the tweet.

1623
02:00:06,613 --> 02:00:07,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you guys so awesome?

1624
02:00:08,454 --> 02:00:09,375
[SPEAKER_07]: I was born that way.

1625
02:00:11,176 --> 02:00:11,916
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very nice.

1626
02:00:12,657 --> 02:00:16,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Some days I do think I'm awesome, but some days I don't feel so awesome.

1627
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Rob, why not?

1628
02:00:19,281 --> 02:00:21,802
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, you know, some days are harder than others.

1629
02:00:21,842 --> 02:00:23,263
[SPEAKER_02]: But your tweets help me get through the day.

1630
02:00:24,244 --> 02:00:24,784
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.

1631
02:00:26,124 --> 02:00:28,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us some tweets.

1632
02:00:28,451 --> 02:00:30,136
[SPEAKER_02]: For now, more news, Loki.

1633
02:00:33,493 --> 02:00:39,014
[SPEAKER_05]: So, apparently their Rockstar is cracking down on Red Dead Redemption cheaters.

1634
02:00:40,155 --> 02:00:45,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I have a problem with them saying that, because that's not exactly what's going on here.

1635
02:00:45,816 --> 02:00:51,738
[SPEAKER_05]: They're cutting... I guess they're cracking down on people that are utilizing glitches in the game.

1636
02:00:51,878 --> 02:00:58,100
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, they're saying that people are glitching into parts of the map that you're not supposed to be able to glitch into.

1637
02:00:58,180 --> 02:00:59,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, for example, there's a...

1638
02:01:00,460 --> 02:01:13,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, a house that's in kind of the Mexico part of the game where you can actually kind of aim at or walk into the corner of a wall and you'll clip through the ground and you can shoot at stuff underneath it.

1639
02:01:14,210 --> 02:01:19,434
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently people are pissed off that they're getting shot by people that they can't shoot back at.

1640
02:01:19,554 --> 02:01:26,299
[SPEAKER_05]: And so because of that, you know, they're going to start patching the game or fixing it so they can't clip through these different things.

1641
02:01:27,697 --> 02:01:46,700
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever fine do that people will just find other glitches since the game is super glitchy but it's not legitimate cheating say you know where they've modded the game to make their guns fire rockets or something like that like that happens in Grand Theft Auto like crazy no one's figured out how to do that yet

1642
02:01:49,269 --> 02:01:50,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Exploits are not hacks.

1643
02:01:50,711 --> 02:01:52,752
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a huge difference between an exploit and a hack.

1644
02:01:52,872 --> 02:01:53,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1645
02:01:54,954 --> 02:02:03,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand why people are up in arms about this crap because you just don't go where those players are then because you can see them on the map.

1646
02:02:03,060 --> 02:02:04,121
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not invisible.

1647
02:02:04,822 --> 02:02:08,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, if they're under a building or something and they keep shooting at you...

1648
02:02:09,145 --> 02:02:11,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Then perhaps you should walk away from them.

1649
02:02:32,739 --> 02:02:39,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I also agree that exploits are not cheating because I've played a lot of these online games, kind of like fan games.

1650
02:02:39,462 --> 02:02:40,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't make fun of me, okay?

1651
02:02:40,582 --> 02:02:45,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Of Survivor and Big Brother and a lot of those reality shows that have very game-centric things.

1652
02:02:45,584 --> 02:02:50,926
[SPEAKER_02]: And people will put together challenges, and I love to find loopholes in the challenge rules and win every time.

1653
02:02:51,086 --> 02:02:51,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I do that.

1654
02:02:51,426 --> 02:02:52,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Immunity is very important.

1655
02:02:53,407 --> 02:02:56,068
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1656
02:03:15,875 --> 02:03:16,616
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1657
02:03:36,435 --> 02:03:39,416
[SPEAKER_05]: and kind of figuring out how they did different things and it makes me a better player.

1658
02:03:40,056 --> 02:03:47,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Now granted, it's not like I'm using modded weapons that fire rockets at people like crazy and there's lots of people out there that do that.

1659
02:03:47,877 --> 02:03:59,199
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a difference between utilizing the nuances of the game, the different glitches and actually cheating in a game to the point that it's an unfair advantage.

1660
02:04:00,580 --> 02:04:01,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Knowledge is not cheating.

1661
02:04:03,072 --> 02:04:03,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheating is cheating.

1662
02:04:04,613 --> 02:04:07,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, and if you cheat in an online game, you're kind of a dick anyway.

1663
02:04:08,174 --> 02:04:11,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you're cheating with your friends and you all agree that cheating's okay.

1664
02:04:12,435 --> 02:04:13,035
[SPEAKER_02]: That's different.

1665
02:04:13,276 --> 02:04:19,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you're doing that, like the modded games that we'll play against each other, that's not necessarily cheating.

1666
02:04:19,898 --> 02:04:22,239
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just you're playing with a whole different set of rules now.

1667
02:04:22,259 --> 02:04:23,479
[SPEAKER_02]: It's having more fun.

1668
02:04:23,819 --> 02:04:25,040
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a mod.

1669
02:04:25,320 --> 02:04:26,040
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not cheating.

1670
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:26,520
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1671
02:04:40,598 --> 02:04:41,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, always, I want to be with you

1672
02:05:09,810 --> 02:05:12,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost forgot to show that to Loki, but something reminded me of that earlier.

1673
02:05:12,572 --> 02:05:13,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew it was out.

1674
02:05:14,493 --> 02:05:19,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Other people were like, I can't believe you made me buy that game because you keep talking about it.

1675
02:05:19,296 --> 02:05:21,377
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I haven't played it in months now.

1676
02:05:21,397 --> 02:05:23,238
[SPEAKER_02]: You were playing it last week on the show.

1677
02:05:23,358 --> 02:05:25,359
[SPEAKER_05]: I was not playing it last week on the show.

1678
02:05:25,399 --> 02:05:26,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Two weeks ago on the show.

1679
02:05:26,620 --> 02:05:28,041
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't two weeks ago either.

1680
02:05:28,221 --> 02:05:28,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it was.

1681
02:05:29,242 --> 02:05:30,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go in the archives and find it.

1682
02:05:31,643 --> 02:05:34,865
[SPEAKER_02]: If you turn up the music really loud in the background, you'll hear...

1683
02:05:36,198 --> 02:05:38,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Always I wanna be with you

1684
02:05:59,634 --> 02:06:02,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, no, really, it's about the Mega Man universe.

1685
02:06:02,536 --> 02:06:11,764
[SPEAKER_02]: A little more information, I mean, little, little more information at Comic-Con this week from Akiko Ito actually talked about this a little bit.

1686
02:06:11,804 --> 02:06:12,604
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the producer.

1687
02:06:13,025 --> 02:06:16,828
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, actually, it's Kenji Inafune actually talked about this.

1688
02:06:16,868 --> 02:06:18,929
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the producer of Mega Man universe.

1689
02:06:19,550 --> 02:06:22,712
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, he's the creator of Mega Man.

1690
02:06:23,613 --> 02:06:24,534
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he's a homeless man.

1691
02:06:24,634 --> 02:06:25,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who he is.

1692
02:06:25,334 --> 02:06:31,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Kenji Inafune is the creator of Mega Man and Akiko Ito is the Mega Man Universe producer.

1693
02:06:31,597 --> 02:06:32,057
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

1694
02:06:32,918 --> 02:06:35,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't you tell I'm like totally up on my video game trivia?

1695
02:06:35,179 --> 02:06:39,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, Mega Man Universe, of course, is coming out eventually.

1696
02:06:39,881 --> 02:06:43,483
[SPEAKER_02]: And they say it will let you play as the Mega Man of your dreams.

1697
02:06:44,083 --> 02:06:50,707
[SPEAKER_02]: The concept of Mega Man Universe, quote, came from the idea of what Mega Man is and what it means to different people.

1698
02:06:52,521 --> 02:07:20,735
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone has a unique idea of what Mega Man is and they even referred to the quote crappy version of Mega Man from the original cartridge that character they don't know about they didn't really say like what the game really really is but a lot of people are inferring like maybe it's just like that and I think Loki said this last week on the show it's kind of like that Nintendo championships or whatever they call that game with all the Nintendo characters the Nintendo crossover game Mario crossover right

1699
02:07:21,515 --> 02:07:24,678
[SPEAKER_02]: And the crowd promptly started shouting Mega Man Legends 3.

1700
02:07:40,672 --> 02:07:54,183
[SPEAKER_02]: and he just smiled and said thank you and didn't confirm oh god I hope so it better not be we only cause I will be pissed the game will also not be out for a while I don't know what a while is but it's gonna be a while

1701
02:07:56,007 --> 02:07:56,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1702
02:07:56,888 --> 02:08:01,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know where the universe thing is, if that means online or if that's because of all the characters in it.

1703
02:08:01,871 --> 02:08:04,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's because it's going to have all the different games in it.

1704
02:08:04,513 --> 02:08:05,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Be in another galaxy.

1705
02:08:06,095 --> 02:08:06,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, DarkTetsuya.

1706
02:08:07,015 --> 02:08:08,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Mario Crossover.

1707
02:08:08,957 --> 02:08:09,817
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was thinking of.

1708
02:08:10,658 --> 02:08:12,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

1709
02:08:13,160 --> 02:08:13,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Stuff.

1710
02:08:15,181 --> 02:08:21,146
[SPEAKER_07]: This is for Marvel vs. Capcom, actually, which is some pretty cool stuff, I'd like to say.

1711
02:08:22,227 --> 02:08:25,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Four new characters have been confirmed at Comic-Con.

1712
02:08:26,986 --> 02:08:30,229
[SPEAKER_07]: We have her, Chun-Li.

1713
02:08:31,750 --> 02:08:32,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, I like Chun-Li.

1714
02:08:32,731 --> 02:08:33,992
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like that hater over there.

1715
02:08:35,013 --> 02:08:35,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Hater.

1716
02:08:36,054 --> 02:08:40,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Doom, because all must fall before Doom.

1717
02:08:40,838 --> 02:08:49,846
[SPEAKER_05]: The Super Scroll, which is... I have to mention real quick, I saw a custom license plate the other day that said, I am Doom.

1718
02:08:50,680 --> 02:08:51,240
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

1719
02:08:52,121 --> 02:08:52,881
[SPEAKER_07]: That is pretty cool.

1720
02:08:53,561 --> 02:08:53,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1721
02:08:54,762 --> 02:08:59,604
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, Doctor Doom is the Super Skrull who is a newbie in the versus whole deal.

1722
02:09:00,665 --> 02:09:03,927
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's, I guess, going to have all the powers of the Fantastic Four.

1723
02:09:04,707 --> 02:09:05,387
[SPEAKER_07]: And Trish.

1724
02:09:07,448 --> 02:09:08,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Trish.

1725
02:09:10,470 --> 02:09:13,252
[SPEAKER_07]: In the teaser trailer, there was an outline of the beautiful Joe.

1726
02:09:13,612 --> 02:09:14,973
[SPEAKER_07]: So, pretty cool.

1727
02:09:16,834 --> 02:09:17,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Trish.

1728
02:09:18,775 --> 02:09:19,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Leathery, tasty.

1729
02:09:19,896 --> 02:09:22,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't they also announce the... Am I jumping ahead?

1730
02:09:22,518 --> 02:09:22,838
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1731
02:09:23,538 --> 02:09:23,778
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1732
02:09:23,918 --> 02:09:26,100
[SPEAKER_02]: The dog from Okami?

1733
02:09:27,741 --> 02:09:28,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, yeah.

1734
02:09:28,421 --> 02:09:28,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a video.

1735
02:09:28,881 --> 02:09:30,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Amaratsu is confirmed.

1736
02:09:30,242 --> 02:09:30,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1737
02:09:31,143 --> 02:09:31,623
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

1738
02:09:31,643 --> 02:09:32,324
[SPEAKER_02]: If I said that right.

1739
02:09:32,544 --> 02:09:32,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1740
02:09:33,764 --> 02:09:34,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

1741
02:09:34,925 --> 02:09:35,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1742
02:09:36,106 --> 02:09:37,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's... And also Thor.

1743
02:09:37,527 --> 02:09:37,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Thor.

1744
02:09:38,743 --> 02:09:40,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I guess there's a lot of characters they're showing.

1745
02:09:42,145 --> 02:09:42,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

1746
02:09:43,906 --> 02:09:44,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what do you got for us?

1747
02:09:58,014 --> 02:09:59,235
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm suing you over My Baby.

1748
02:09:59,576 --> 02:10:01,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently... Now who that is?

1749
02:10:01,477 --> 02:10:02,258
[SPEAKER_02]: My Baby Mama?

1750
02:10:02,318 --> 02:10:03,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Now who that is?

1751
02:10:03,459 --> 02:10:14,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Southview Games is taking legal action against Majesco specifically regarding the right to publishing My Baby titles in the United States.

1752
02:10:15,828 --> 02:10:30,297
[SPEAKER_05]: This was spurred by an announcement last month that Majesco would publish My Baby 3 and Friends, an action South Peak claims Majesco wasn't legally allowed to take.

1753
02:10:31,318 --> 02:10:36,500
[SPEAKER_05]: for its part as Southweek issued this statement on the impeding litigation.

1754
02:10:36,940 --> 02:10:44,602
[SPEAKER_05]: We are exceptionally proud of our success in making the My Baby franchise in North America.

1755
02:10:45,062 --> 02:10:55,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Our innovative sales, marketing, and PR strategies brought My Baby to a huge audience and built a loyal fan base for future products.

1756
02:10:56,285 --> 02:10:57,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, where?

1757
02:10:58,747 --> 02:10:59,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1758
02:11:00,007 --> 02:11:06,631
[SPEAKER_05]: South Peak continues to hold the rights to subsequent My Baby games, and we intend to vigorously protect those rights.

1759
02:11:07,472 --> 02:11:21,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Additionally, we've confirmed that while South Peak claims a contractual right to publish subsequent My Baby games in the U.S., Noblis owns the My Baby IP.

1760
02:11:22,900 --> 02:11:29,004
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's up to, I guess, Noblis to decide, I guess, who publishes what.

1761
02:11:29,805 --> 02:11:36,650
[SPEAKER_05]: And... Yeah, so, basically, they're just complaining about that, but...

1762
02:11:39,995 --> 02:11:40,375
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1763
02:11:40,656 --> 02:11:41,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's dumb.

1764
02:11:42,717 --> 02:11:49,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I know that my BB games sell somewhat because people like their sim games and little girls love this stuff.

1765
02:11:50,623 --> 02:11:55,926
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, honestly, we're talking like these games sell maybe, maybe 200,000 units.

1766
02:11:56,067 --> 02:11:58,668
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, those are like eye of judgment numbers there.

1767
02:11:58,889 --> 02:12:02,451
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, to give you an example of how much these fail.

1768
02:12:04,072 --> 02:12:05,013
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

1769
02:12:06,929 --> 02:12:34,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised that they wouldn't be suing like for say babysitting mama or something like that I'm surprised these games are such a big fucking deal in the first place you'd be surprised like those Imagine games they're terrible they have so many that come out they sell and even like Lillis Pet Shop which I hate you EA and your fucking three versions of the game that you gotta put out each year those sell well too it's just weird

1770
02:12:36,900 --> 02:12:42,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, this is also kind of weird, but cool, I guess, that it was considered, but it didn't happen.

1771
02:12:42,761 --> 02:13:04,186
[SPEAKER_02]: This was running on a website, I've not heard of these guys before, but GamerANX.com was running this story, and it kind of caught wind and ended up on a lot of game blogs this week, and it was a comment that Rahul Sood, the Voodoo PC founder, and he's also the current CTO of gaming at Hewlett Packard, he actually revealed a couple months ago that there was a secret project

1772
02:13:05,086 --> 02:13:07,327
[SPEAKER_02]: or an interesting one or a quiet one nonetheless.

1773
02:13:08,147 --> 02:13:12,989
[SPEAKER_02]: At Microsoft, it would have allowed PC gamers to actually match up with console players.

1774
02:13:13,469 --> 02:13:17,550
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wouldn't just be like Final Fantasy XI wouldn't be the only game that would be cross-platform.

1775
02:13:17,950 --> 02:13:19,171
[SPEAKER_02]: It isn't the only game.

1776
02:13:20,111 --> 02:13:21,491
[SPEAKER_02]: What else is cross-platform?

1777
02:13:21,611 --> 02:13:23,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Shadowrun was cross-platform.

1778
02:13:23,552 --> 02:13:24,632
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, okay.

1779
02:13:24,792 --> 02:13:28,694
[SPEAKER_05]: And also I believe there was another strategy game that was...

1780
02:13:31,758 --> 02:13:32,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1781
02:13:50,544 --> 02:13:59,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard from reliable sources that during the development they brought together the best console gamers to play mediocre PC gamers at the same game.

1782
02:13:59,709 --> 02:14:00,590
[SPEAKER_02]: And guess what happened?

1783
02:14:00,930 --> 02:14:06,053
[SPEAKER_02]: They pitted console gamers with their console controller against PC gamers with their keyboard and mouse.

1784
02:14:06,633 --> 02:14:09,234
[SPEAKER_02]: The console players got destroyed every time.

1785
02:14:09,655 --> 02:14:15,438
[SPEAKER_02]: So much so that it would be embarrassing to the Xbox team in general had Microsoft launched this initiative.

1786
02:14:16,358 --> 02:14:21,100
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little bit of that that sounds fanboy-y to me, especially knowing that these other games are out there.

1787
02:14:22,081 --> 02:14:23,321
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you coughing about over there?

1788
02:14:23,522 --> 02:14:31,345
[SPEAKER_03]: When we played Left 4 Dead online together on our PCs and I found out that you were playing with the Xbox controller, I was giving you side-eye for that reason.

1789
02:14:31,806 --> 02:14:32,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

1790
02:14:32,306 --> 02:14:33,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I was doing fine.

1791
02:14:33,266 --> 02:14:35,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Mouse and keyboard is superior.

1792
02:14:35,767 --> 02:14:37,548
[SPEAKER_03]: And now this is the story.

1793
02:14:38,229 --> 02:14:43,151
[SPEAKER_05]: I tell you, if they had cross-platform play on Grand Theft Auto, I would eat up any PC player.

1794
02:14:43,772 --> 02:14:58,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Out there, I would destroy them But that's not a first person shooter It doesn't matter, it still has first person shooter Kind of controls I would destroy them All of them I don't give a shit if you're using a tomato To control the game

1795
02:14:58,815 --> 02:14:59,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I will destroy you.

1796
02:15:18,604 --> 02:15:21,487
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, it wouldn't be that damn hard.

1797
02:15:21,507 --> 02:15:22,948
[SPEAKER_05]: There's USB ports.

1798
02:15:23,608 --> 02:15:27,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, would it be really difficult to, I don't know, map keys in a game or something?

1799
02:15:27,932 --> 02:15:29,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Or use a mouse?

1800
02:15:29,374 --> 02:15:30,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the funny thing.

1801
02:15:30,354 --> 02:15:31,575
[SPEAKER_02]: You can plug in a keyboard.

1802
02:15:31,616 --> 02:15:33,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to use a keyboard on Final Fantasy XI.

1803
02:15:33,397 --> 02:15:34,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you can for certain games.

1804
02:15:35,379 --> 02:15:38,482
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess if you buy certain accessories...

1805
02:15:39,082 --> 02:15:50,288
[SPEAKER_05]: There's ways to kind of shoehorn it in there, but why they don't offer it as an actual solution for, you know, say Call of Duty and stuff like that is beyond me because I think that'd be a great idea.

1806
02:15:50,608 --> 02:15:53,650
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, they wouldn't be able to sell accessories like they do.

1807
02:15:54,371 --> 02:15:58,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really think it's a big deal because most people will probably buy a controller anyways.

1808
02:15:58,073 --> 02:16:02,735
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going to just use strictly keyboard mouse for everything, but it'd be kind of cool.

1809
02:16:03,315 --> 02:16:07,758
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wonder if they could actually do that, like have support for that.

1810
02:16:10,922 --> 02:16:39,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to look at some of our comments in our chat room chat.orange.radio.com Legend of Zaku is saying, Loki, prepare for an ass whooping with an 8 year old Logitech mouse I think, uh, but unfortunately you can't, I mean, you can't you can't with Grand Theft Auto because it's not well, obviously because it's not cross you know, cross platform especially if it's on 360 there's nothing cross platform anymore so that's too bad Bonds006 in our chat says, I will die with a keyboard in my hands

1811
02:16:42,390 --> 02:16:42,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw.

1812
02:16:42,870 --> 02:16:44,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried playing Keyboard Mouse.

1813
02:16:44,331 --> 02:16:46,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I don't, don't like it.

1814
02:16:46,431 --> 02:16:48,132
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to play Team Fortress 2 with it.

1815
02:16:48,172 --> 02:16:54,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you can't use a controller in Team Fortress 2 and it's probably part of the reason I'm forced to play a medic because you don't really have to aim very well.

1816
02:16:54,373 --> 02:16:55,393
[SPEAKER_02]: You should play on the 360.

1817
02:16:56,394 --> 02:16:57,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I could.

1818
02:16:57,894 --> 02:17:00,315
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I'd have to buy the game again.

1819
02:17:00,335 --> 02:17:01,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I already bought it on Steam.

1820
02:17:02,279 --> 02:17:15,266
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when Left 4 Dead 2 came out last November and there was a lot of drama on a lot of the major blogs like Joystick and Kotaku who played the 360 version of the game and they gave it mediocre reviews saying it was too hard.

1821
02:17:15,966 --> 02:17:18,667
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the sites that reviewed it on PC said it was fine.

1822
02:17:18,927 --> 02:17:24,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess the people playing it on Xbox 360 just couldn't... They just kept getting wiped out.

1823
02:17:25,070 --> 02:17:29,573
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the game was developed for both platforms but the keyboard and mouse people just...

1824
02:17:30,353 --> 02:17:30,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Hand Advantage.

1825
02:17:30,974 --> 02:17:31,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1826
02:17:31,294 --> 02:17:32,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Just keep fanning those flames.

1827
02:17:32,655 --> 02:17:34,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Just keep fanning those flames.

1828
02:17:34,337 --> 02:17:35,578
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, why did you give that game a 7?

1829
02:17:35,958 --> 02:17:39,281
[SPEAKER_03]: It all came down to the controller, according to the reviewers.

1830
02:17:39,942 --> 02:17:48,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I hate to keep going back to this, and it's not a first-person shooter, but Final Fantasy XI, you could play with a controller in that game, and Jamie did, and she did quite well with it.

1831
02:17:48,189 --> 02:17:50,611
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you have to set up your macros in advance, but you can do it.

1832
02:17:51,031 --> 02:17:56,474
[SPEAKER_07]: But I had the triggers on top and I would just cycle through my macros through my trigger buttons.

1833
02:17:57,654 --> 02:17:58,995
[SPEAKER_07]: And Rob saw me do it.

1834
02:17:59,976 --> 02:18:02,457
[SPEAKER_02]: The complete edition was like five bucks on Steam this week.

1835
02:18:02,697 --> 02:18:03,357
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw that.

1836
02:18:03,377 --> 02:18:06,159
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a part of me that just kind of wanted to play it for a month.

1837
02:18:06,319 --> 02:18:06,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1838
02:18:06,659 --> 02:18:21,073
[SPEAKER_05]: It really was going to come down to if you want to do games that are cross-platform like that and you want to have everybody on kind of the same page, you need to make the controls more console-friendly, I guess, because that's what they're doing with DC Universe is they're making the stuff kind of translate over.

1839
02:18:23,235 --> 02:18:27,960
[SPEAKER_05]: The controls are simple as it is, and so it translates over well to the actual controller.

1840
02:18:28,707 --> 02:18:51,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I was you know what's funny and I don't know if I should be repeating this but I was told at E3 that the part of the reason why the games are not cross server at this time is because it played so much differently on the PC versus the PlayStation 3 and that one was having an advantage over the other and I wonder if it comes down to this whole same issue it's the PlayStation controller versus keyboard mouse could be

1841
02:18:52,066 --> 02:18:53,487
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll play Warcraft with a keyboard and mouse.

1842
02:18:53,507 --> 02:18:54,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't play that with a controller.

1843
02:18:55,148 --> 02:18:57,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even think you can play that with a controller.

1844
02:18:57,109 --> 02:19:00,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but it'd be weird.

1845
02:19:00,151 --> 02:19:05,615
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, when I play PC games, I use an Xbox 360 controller a lot of times.

1846
02:19:05,675 --> 02:19:10,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Grand Theft Auto and Crysis, I played with a 360 controller.

1847
02:19:11,639 --> 02:19:12,399
[SPEAKER_05]: It worked great for me.

1848
02:19:13,540 --> 02:19:15,021
[SPEAKER_05]: I never had any problems getting killed.

1849
02:19:15,361 --> 02:19:16,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to keep on with this debate.

1850
02:19:17,162 --> 02:19:19,303
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to hear what our folks have to say in the mailbag.

1851
02:19:19,343 --> 02:19:22,524
[SPEAKER_02]: But one more story from DarkSakura about another MMO, right?

1852
02:19:23,485 --> 02:19:27,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for Phantasy Star Universe, they're getting a pretty big update.

1853
02:19:28,907 --> 02:19:34,590
[SPEAKER_07]: There is going to be the Ambition of the Illuminous expansion, which is a free download.

1854
02:19:35,810 --> 02:19:39,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I paid $15 for Abortion of the Illuminous like two years ago.

1855
02:19:40,372 --> 02:19:40,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Bastards.

1856
02:19:41,573 --> 02:19:41,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

1857
02:19:43,233 --> 02:19:53,840
[SPEAKER_07]: The Guardians Advanced Content is an automated update for the subscribers with new missions, weapons, items, customization system, and an overhaul of the game's classes and skills.

1858
02:19:54,861 --> 02:19:59,164
[SPEAKER_07]: And Guardians will require Ambition of the Illuminous to work.

1859
02:20:00,765 --> 02:20:01,986
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why it's free, pretty much.

1860
02:20:03,286 --> 02:20:03,427
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

1861
02:20:06,093 --> 02:20:13,515
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess they're basically taking into account all of the problems that people had with Phantasy Star Universe.

1862
02:20:14,875 --> 02:20:19,716
[SPEAKER_07]: All the stuff they took away from online that made it so much more fun.

1863
02:20:21,257 --> 02:20:22,797
[SPEAKER_07]: I do think PSO was more fun.

1864
02:20:24,357 --> 02:20:25,598
[SPEAKER_02]: You think it's worth revisiting?

1865
02:20:26,518 --> 02:20:26,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

1866
02:20:28,498 --> 02:20:29,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know that I want to play it on the 360.

1867
02:20:29,999 --> 02:20:30,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

1868
02:20:31,380 --> 02:20:31,780
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1869
02:20:58,613 --> 02:21:02,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to fully review the Puzzle Agent game as it's much like Professor Layton.

1870
02:21:03,038 --> 02:21:06,081
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on Steam by Telltale Games who say my Max episodes sold well.

1871
02:21:06,121 --> 02:21:10,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's say it's a game where you are in a town with OCD about puzzles.

1872
02:21:11,387 --> 02:21:18,674
[SPEAKER_07]: There's very little point and click where you play trading games to advance is mostly all dialogue and puzzles.

1873
02:21:19,315 --> 02:21:24,036
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm also playing the game La Di Da, and suddenly the game ends at what is typically the middle of the story.

1874
02:21:24,576 --> 02:21:26,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not upset about the game being too short.

1875
02:21:27,297 --> 02:21:31,138
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm mad because the game was not listed as episodic, either that or I completely missed it.

1876
02:21:31,558 --> 02:21:36,800
[SPEAKER_07]: A game like this is typically $5, but they have a single illustrator, so perhaps that bumped the game up to $10.

1877
02:21:38,340 --> 02:21:40,561
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm also into Xbox Live Arcade game Limbo.

1878
02:21:41,001 --> 02:21:43,322
[SPEAKER_07]: The game reminds me a lot of Out of This World.

1879
02:21:43,342 --> 02:21:47,964
[SPEAKER_07]: That's because you are alone and the world feels completely alien despite the familiar setting of a forest.

1880
02:21:48,605 --> 02:21:54,968
[SPEAKER_07]: If Sky remembers, I made a little big planet level in the same style called UFO Story and then they came.

1881
02:21:56,188 --> 02:21:59,310
[SPEAKER_07]: It was gray silhouettes, foggy, and had strange lighting effects.

1882
02:21:59,391 --> 02:22:02,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Limbo even had a tire swing at the beginning of the game.

1883
02:22:03,353 --> 02:22:04,514
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm taking no credit, though.

1884
02:22:04,554 --> 02:22:05,595
[SPEAKER_07]: It had to be coincidence.

1885
02:22:05,695 --> 02:22:09,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus, my LittleBigPlanet level is nowhere near as good as Limbo.

1886
02:22:09,618 --> 02:22:10,819
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, it gets tedious.

1887
02:22:11,739 --> 02:22:18,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I'm very proud of the spinning boss at the end, that foggy gray noir setting is nothing new in games.

1888
02:22:18,824 --> 02:22:22,505
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, it took me a good 80 hours to make that LittleBigPlanet level.

1889
02:22:22,865 --> 02:22:25,086
[SPEAKER_07]: LittleBigPlanet construction is not for the dabbler.

1890
02:22:25,746 --> 02:22:27,887
[SPEAKER_07]: A somewhat okay level takes 80 hours.

1891
02:22:28,427 --> 02:22:30,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder what a good or great level takes.

1892
02:22:30,607 --> 02:22:38,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I do remember that level, and when I read the email earlier this week, I actually was like, oh yeah, it kind of did have that same kind of look and feel to it.

1893
02:22:38,429 --> 02:22:38,949
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of funny.

1894
02:22:39,430 --> 02:22:40,810
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally remember what you're talking about, Robbaba.

1895
02:22:41,627 --> 02:22:42,549
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to Disney World.

1896
02:22:42,730 --> 02:22:43,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Again.

1897
02:22:44,414 --> 02:22:45,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Bring me back some pins, dude.

1898
02:22:45,476 --> 02:22:45,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Jerk.

1899
02:22:45,918 --> 02:22:46,679
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to go to Disney World.

1900
02:22:46,699 --> 02:22:47,381
[SPEAKER_12]: I want some pins.

1901
02:22:47,421 --> 02:22:48,424
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I go to Disney World?

1902
02:22:48,684 --> 02:22:49,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob and I trade pins.

1903
02:22:52,749 --> 02:22:54,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Last one is from Troy.

1904
02:22:55,972 --> 02:22:58,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, OLR, Troy again.

1905
02:22:58,594 --> 02:23:01,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you guys seen the new Halo Reach Forge mode?

1906
02:23:01,737 --> 02:23:08,723
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how big of FPS fans you guys are, but if you like Halo, the new Forge is like a little big planet for Halo.

1907
02:23:09,403 --> 02:23:15,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I went on a Super Stardust HD week and hopefully made it pretty high on the ranking list for the big battle.

1908
02:23:16,389 --> 02:23:19,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, people who have the games and are listening really should join the big battle.

1909
02:23:20,331 --> 02:23:24,592
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I was bored of video games until this came up, but now I think I love competitive gaming again.

1910
02:23:24,612 --> 02:23:26,653
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.

1911
02:23:27,353 --> 02:23:31,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, I'm sure the folks that put that all together will be very nice to hear that.

1912
02:23:31,875 --> 02:23:32,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1913
02:23:32,235 --> 02:23:33,356
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be very happy to hear that.

1914
02:23:35,317 --> 02:23:35,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1915
02:23:36,797 --> 02:23:37,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

1916
02:23:38,898 --> 02:23:39,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Angst.

1917
02:23:39,238 --> 02:23:41,379
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the part of the show where we get out our angst.

1918
02:23:41,399 --> 02:23:43,440
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called the FUs of the Week.

1919
02:23:43,460 --> 02:23:43,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1920
02:24:00,100 --> 02:24:03,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, the first one would be me, wouldn't it?

1921
02:24:03,243 --> 02:24:18,297
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to the hole in my hand, because, okay, it was fine with just the stitches, because it would pull a little bit and it was alright, but now it's like my hand is a lot more sore than it was last week since the stitches came out.

1922
02:24:18,857 --> 02:24:47,535
[SPEAKER_07]: especially with that hole that now I have to do extra stuff to keep it closed and wear thick bandages on my palm it just makes my hand hurt a whole lot more and the sad thing with that is that typing on my keyboard hurts a lot and like I'll message people a little bit but like using my mouse hurts too but if I'm doing the two of them together then it really hurts and that's actually made it hard for me to play Star Trek Online

1923
02:24:48,275 --> 02:24:52,637
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I haven't been doing all the gaming, haven't been really doing that much chatting online or anything.

1924
02:24:52,757 --> 02:24:56,078
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's just really sore.

1925
02:24:56,218 --> 02:25:03,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, the whole, the weird problem about it is that even though it's sore up at the top of my palm, the back of my hand is really sore too.

1926
02:25:04,220 --> 02:25:07,181
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's where the bruise was left over from where they did the blood drain.

1927
02:25:07,862 --> 02:25:11,983
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm just sore and it makes me a grumpy, grumpy, grumpy girl.

1928
02:25:13,396 --> 02:25:14,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Like grumpier than usual?

1929
02:25:15,578 --> 02:25:16,498
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really grumpy.

1930
02:25:17,239 --> 02:25:20,001
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm quite grumpy.

1931
02:25:20,641 --> 02:25:20,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1932
02:25:22,462 --> 02:25:26,285
[SPEAKER_07]: You need some more vitamin B. No, I don't need more vitamin B. I need ice cream.

1933
02:25:27,205 --> 02:25:27,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I want ice cream.

1934
02:25:29,537 --> 02:25:30,578
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't work tomorrow, just saying.

1935
02:25:30,978 --> 02:25:33,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

1936
02:25:34,301 --> 02:25:40,527
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to whoever was causing some crime today on Greenback Lane.

1937
02:25:41,267 --> 02:25:44,490
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually had the whole street blocked off with police tape.

1938
02:25:44,971 --> 02:25:45,851
[SPEAKER_05]: It was ridiculous.

1939
02:25:46,372 --> 02:25:50,215
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had to go way around it, and I dislike that.

1940
02:25:50,836 --> 02:25:51,597
[SPEAKER_05]: And bad drivers.

1941
02:25:51,717 --> 02:25:53,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Could people stop being stupid?

1942
02:25:54,479 --> 02:25:55,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, just in general.

1943
02:25:55,834 --> 02:25:56,475
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not talking to you.

1944
02:25:56,515 --> 02:25:59,137
[SPEAKER_02]: The listeners of this show clearly are not stupid because they're listening to this show.

1945
02:25:59,497 --> 02:26:05,061
[SPEAKER_02]: But just like the people out there, instead of listening to this show, that are out there on Greenback Avenue shooting each other, stop being stupid.

1946
02:26:06,943 --> 02:26:07,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

1947
02:26:08,715 --> 02:26:09,216
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously.

1948
02:26:10,597 --> 02:26:11,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's see.

1949
02:26:12,540 --> 02:26:14,963
[SPEAKER_02]: My FU of the week, I'm going to give an FU to Apple.

1950
02:26:15,944 --> 02:26:25,876
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, Loki's in heaven right now, but I think it's total bullshit that they released this OS that screws up my old phone, forcing me to get a new phone, but the new phone is not available anywhere.

1951
02:26:26,437 --> 02:26:27,078
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bullshit!

1952
02:26:28,866 --> 02:26:50,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually contemplating getting a different phone right now because I'm thinking like I can get the iPad it does everything the phone does but then I'm still I know I'm still biting the hand that I want to protest and I'm a hypocrite and blah blah blah but let's face it the iPhone is now kind of a gaming platform there's a lot I'm missing out on if I don't have one Salacious Pop what are your FUs of the week?

1953
02:26:52,311 --> 02:26:53,632
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to the month of July.

1954
02:26:54,453 --> 02:27:10,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm usually endeared to this month because it's my birthday month, but a lot of people that I follow on LiveJournal that I've been reading for years have been having to deal with sudden deaths of family members and their partners, and I have a friend who had to have ankle surgery.

1955
02:27:11,354 --> 02:27:14,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Due to complications from his ankle surgery, he now has pneumonia.

1956
02:27:15,115 --> 02:27:15,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Figure that one out.

1957
02:27:16,856 --> 02:27:20,797
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's been a really hard month for a lot of people that I care about online.

1958
02:27:21,178 --> 02:27:24,919
[SPEAKER_03]: So that just sucks that I can't really be there for them because they live far away.

1959
02:27:26,218 --> 02:27:29,459
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to distance and people that are far away that you can't be there for.

1960
02:27:29,659 --> 02:27:30,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1961
02:27:30,419 --> 02:27:30,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I get that.

1962
02:27:31,019 --> 02:27:31,599
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks.

1963
02:27:32,619 --> 02:27:32,899
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1964
02:27:33,839 --> 02:27:34,759
[SPEAKER_07]: I have another one.

1965
02:27:35,100 --> 02:27:35,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Quickly.

1966
02:27:35,940 --> 02:27:36,780
[SPEAKER_07]: My brother's crazy.

1967
02:27:37,880 --> 02:27:39,080
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to his brain disease.

1968
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:41,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine too, but in a whole different way.

1969
02:27:45,521 --> 02:27:49,622
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a special kind of crazy, but we won't get into that on this episode of Ricky Lake.

1970
02:27:50,042 --> 02:27:53,443
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Loki, some gaming news, and then we'll get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1971
02:27:53,463 --> 02:27:53,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

1972
02:27:55,373 --> 02:28:03,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, not to be outdone by Google, YouTube also has an Easter egg on it that allows you to play a game.

1973
02:28:05,060 --> 02:28:11,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, if you go to Google, or not Google, YouTube, it's owned by Google now so it doesn't matter.

1974
02:28:12,244 --> 02:28:35,176
[SPEAKER_05]: if you go to youtube.com and pull up any video whatever hold down the left arrow on your keyboard and after a few seconds you should be able to play the game Snake over the top of the video I used to love Snake on the old cell phones fun times

1975
02:28:36,209 --> 02:28:36,869
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I need to do.

1976
02:28:36,909 --> 02:28:41,611
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go trade in my iPhone and go get me one of those old-ass Nokia phones that have Snake on it.

1977
02:28:42,051 --> 02:28:42,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

1978
02:28:43,612 --> 02:28:44,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Does this still work?

1979
02:28:44,352 --> 02:28:46,073
[SPEAKER_07]: You can probably get Snake for iPhone.

1980
02:28:48,134 --> 02:28:48,814
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the same.

1981
02:28:52,096 --> 02:28:52,796
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the same.

1982
02:28:55,097 --> 02:29:04,301
[SPEAKER_02]: As much as I appreciate YYR, one of the listeners of the show, and I do think Snake 360 is a good game, it's just not the same as playing it on the old-school cell phone.

1983
02:29:04,321 --> 02:29:04,821
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

1984
02:29:05,993 --> 02:29:06,313
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1985
02:29:07,874 --> 02:29:13,577
[SPEAKER_02]: One other story for you guys, then we're going to get to the Skype line, 877-GAME-OLR, yada, yada.

1986
02:29:13,737 --> 02:29:15,077
[SPEAKER_02]: This is about StarCraft II.

1987
02:29:15,117 --> 02:29:16,278
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a StarCraft II story.

1988
02:29:16,858 --> 02:29:25,082
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying the launch for this is going to be big, big, huge, gigantic, because lots of stores are doing the midnight releases, of course.

1989
02:29:25,122 --> 02:29:27,063
[SPEAKER_02]: This game's been, what, like 10 years in the making?

1990
02:29:27,623 --> 02:29:31,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Blizzard is not saying how many copies of the game has been preordered, because they don't get into that.

1991
02:29:32,325 --> 02:29:33,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1992
02:29:54,637 --> 02:30:20,436
[SPEAKER_02]: The story that I'm reading from the Orange County Register which is not a video game site specifically Blizzard obviously is in Anaheim which is kind of Orange County They are talking about this 18 year old who apparently plans to wait 72 hours in line for StarCraft 2 When asked why he said It's really hard to explain, I don't know, it's just something I'm crazy enough to enjoy I guess if people can stand in line for Twilight for that long I guess they can do it for StarCraft 2

1993
02:30:21,477 --> 02:30:28,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, World of Warcraft Wrath of the Lich King sold 2.8 million copies when it came out in the first 24 hours.

1994
02:30:28,809 --> 02:30:30,512
[SPEAKER_02]: They think this could possibly top it.

1995
02:30:32,751 --> 02:30:36,093
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing, though, that is not going to help sell the game is reviews.

1996
02:30:36,633 --> 02:30:41,896
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be no reviews of StarCraft II Wings of Liberty before it launches on Tuesday.

1997
02:30:42,616 --> 02:30:45,758
[SPEAKER_02]: The press will be reviewing the game when everybody else does.

1998
02:30:46,718 --> 02:30:58,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the publisher feels that the Battle.net service and the online features is so essential to the game that opening them up early when it's not really ready to go for the press to review it could be detrimental to the game.

1999
02:30:58,624 --> 02:31:05,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because people will pirate it like they already know the copies have already come out, but you can't play it until the bell and then servers are up.

2000
02:31:05,828 --> 02:31:14,172
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be a day one patch for the game in order to give the developer, quote, a little bit more time to sort of get their ducks in a row.

2001
02:31:14,512 --> 02:31:18,455
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically telling me the game's not really totally ready and it comes out, oh, Tuesday.

2002
02:31:19,435 --> 02:31:24,700
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of what Alan was saying earlier, why don't you just wait three months for them to just actually get the game working?

2003
02:31:25,781 --> 02:31:31,305
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of pressure on at Blizzard right now, because if this game fails on launch day, there's going to be a lot of shit for it.

2004
02:31:31,686 --> 02:31:36,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say this, I don't know if I can stand to wait three months, but I am going to wait for the reviews of the game.

2005
02:31:36,590 --> 02:31:40,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's pretty bold of Blizzard to say, nah, we're not going to send out our game for review.

2006
02:31:41,454 --> 02:31:42,155
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll sell without it.

2007
02:31:42,935 --> 02:31:56,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a little confused because I know that a lot of the major review sites get their copy two weeks early but they're just not allowed to publish the story until release date in which case all the sites try to scoop each other so does this mean that they're not getting the game at all?

2008
02:31:57,228 --> 02:32:01,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, they're not really saying for sure but they can't play it even if they have it, they can't play it

2009
02:32:02,338 --> 02:32:25,085
[SPEAKER_02]: well and a lot of times they get into some really shady shit with those embargoes too because a lot of times you can break the embargo if you gave the game a 90% or better like that shit really happens out there and it's kind of sick like and that's why you know we're here about really supporting the independent media because we don't have to really play by those rules granted we don't get the early copies of the games because of it

2010
02:32:25,465 --> 02:32:54,706
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know just keep in mind if this site got a world exclusive review and is like the first to run with it if that review is an A or something of the equivalent question it you should question it because they could very well be doing it especially if it's a no name site trying to get the additional traffic they could be doing it just to get the traffic kind of sad Toagak in our chat room says code your damn games on time or admit failure damn these day one patches

2011
02:32:57,139 --> 02:33:02,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think the game is going to be terrible, but it's going to be interesting to see if the servers can handle it day one.

2012
02:33:03,786 --> 02:33:04,827
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a big demand.

2013
02:33:05,568 --> 02:33:06,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Big, big demand.

2014
02:33:07,069 --> 02:33:09,672
[SPEAKER_02]: The internet will come to a screeching halt this week.

2015
02:33:10,905 --> 02:33:11,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Chaos.

2016
02:33:12,386 --> 02:33:12,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2017
02:33:13,286 --> 02:33:19,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2018
02:33:19,389 --> 02:33:20,230
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all one word.

2019
02:33:21,170 --> 02:33:29,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, if you're using Skype for the first time, make sure you give Echo123 a call on Skype or I think they actually build it in there now.

2020
02:33:29,474 --> 02:33:37,318
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like make a test call and you can easily hear if your sound settings are okay because when we pick up and no one's there, it's a little bit frustrating.

2021
02:33:37,339 --> 02:33:37,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2022
02:33:38,439 --> 02:33:42,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, while we wait for some calls to come in, do we have any last minute stories in the house?

2023
02:33:43,262 --> 02:33:43,923
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not.

2024
02:33:44,443 --> 02:33:44,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki?

2025
02:33:45,604 --> 02:33:47,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, but I'll have to look them up.

2026
02:33:48,166 --> 02:33:50,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you had some ready to go.

2027
02:33:50,107 --> 02:33:51,228
[SPEAKER_02]: You're too busy shopping.

2028
02:33:51,588 --> 02:33:52,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I am shopping.

2029
02:33:52,589 --> 02:33:54,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, luckily we're getting a call.

2030
02:33:54,230 --> 02:33:55,991
[SPEAKER_02]: You're being saved by a phone call.

2031
02:33:56,452 --> 02:33:57,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2032
02:33:57,692 --> 02:33:58,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2033
02:33:59,192 --> 02:34:00,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it's Ranma, everyone.

2034
02:34:00,853 --> 02:34:03,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Ranma, you're the master of zerg rushing our phones.

2035
02:34:03,714 --> 02:34:04,074
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?

2036
02:34:05,375 --> 02:34:09,337
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not the master, I just got lucky.

2037
02:34:09,597 --> 02:34:12,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Just two things I wanted to tell you, so I'll be on my merry little way.

2038
02:34:12,919 --> 02:34:13,279
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up?

2039
02:34:13,419 --> 02:34:20,562
[SPEAKER_11]: The first thing I want to bring up is what you said about the guy that was online for 72 hours for StarCraft II.

2040
02:34:20,922 --> 02:34:22,103
[SPEAKER_11]: He's standing in line, yes.

2041
02:34:23,792 --> 02:34:27,074
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want you to know that I was on the line for the week.

2042
02:34:27,254 --> 02:34:29,455
[SPEAKER_11]: I was out there for about a day and a half.

2043
02:34:29,895 --> 02:34:30,776
[SPEAKER_11]: There were people out there.

2044
02:34:30,996 --> 02:34:33,157
[SPEAKER_11]: My older brother was out there.

2045
02:34:33,437 --> 02:34:36,498
[SPEAKER_11]: No, my younger brother was out there since Thursday for a week, okay?

2046
02:34:36,919 --> 02:34:37,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

2047
02:34:37,479 --> 02:34:39,420
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, don't adjust your sound.

2048
02:34:39,500 --> 02:34:40,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma is cutting in and out.

2049
02:34:40,681 --> 02:34:41,401
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not sure why.

2050
02:34:41,441 --> 02:34:48,444
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it's your speakers or... It might be my end, so I'll make this quick and just get going.

2051
02:34:48,504 --> 02:34:49,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Porn Torrents.

2052
02:34:49,345 --> 02:34:50,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, go ahead.

2053
02:34:51,246 --> 02:34:52,747
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not running any Porn Torrents.

2054
02:34:52,767 --> 02:34:53,347
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not Loki.

2055
02:34:54,037 --> 02:34:58,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't torrent my porn, I download it off Houston, okay?

2056
02:34:59,385 --> 02:35:03,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, Ranma, yes, you were in line just as long, okay, I get it.

2057
02:35:03,830 --> 02:35:06,134
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're also Black Luigi, you have to be out there.

2058
02:35:06,174 --> 02:35:08,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like, it's not a Nintendo party without Black Luigi.

2059
02:35:10,148 --> 02:35:15,171
[SPEAKER_11]: I suppose so, but I'm just saying you can't call out for something like that because we've all done this.

2060
02:35:15,231 --> 02:35:17,873
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you guys didn't get on the line for the week.

2061
02:35:17,893 --> 02:35:21,095
[SPEAKER_11]: You were out there interviewing people, handing out food and stuff, you know?

2062
02:35:21,316 --> 02:35:25,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was total promotion for our show because, you know, we can't afford million-dollar ads.

2063
02:35:25,759 --> 02:35:26,719
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, we got into it.

2064
02:35:26,819 --> 02:35:28,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Extrofer waited in the line.

2065
02:35:30,382 --> 02:35:32,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I waited in line over the week.

2066
02:35:32,103 --> 02:35:33,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, too, this is important.

2067
02:35:34,445 --> 02:35:37,327
[SPEAKER_02]: If we hadn't waited in line, we wouldn't have got one.

2068
02:35:38,007 --> 02:35:41,009
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be plenty of StarCraft 2 available day one.

2069
02:35:41,089 --> 02:35:43,110
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to sell out like crazy.

2070
02:35:43,170 --> 02:35:44,210
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be able to find it.

2071
02:35:44,891 --> 02:35:48,753
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, software is a lot easier to make than hardware, right?

2072
02:35:51,374 --> 02:35:52,194
[SPEAKER_11]: True, true.

2073
02:35:52,575 --> 02:35:56,437
[SPEAKER_11]: But still, I'm just saying you shouldn't give him a hard time.

2074
02:35:57,617 --> 02:35:59,718
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not giving him that hard a time.

2075
02:35:59,798 --> 02:36:03,300
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just putting that in the same category as waiting for Twilight.

2076
02:36:03,400 --> 02:36:04,401
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

2077
02:36:04,421 --> 02:36:04,601
[SPEAKER_02]: That's...

2078
02:36:09,648 --> 02:36:11,492
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess.

2079
02:36:11,773 --> 02:36:15,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well what else is on your mind before we let you go, Ranma?

2080
02:36:17,558 --> 02:36:23,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Earlier in the show about the law that California is trying to pass to the other states that are jumping on the wagon.

2081
02:36:24,562 --> 02:36:26,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Passes is not going to do a lick of damage.

2082
02:36:27,283 --> 02:36:39,789
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen plenty of time at Best Buy, people at 17 buying the Emerald Games, it pops up on the register, check your ID, they just hit the keyboard, enter the bypass, and keep going.

2083
02:36:40,410 --> 02:36:44,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but now it's going to be illegal, and those people could be personally responsible if they do that.

2084
02:36:44,972 --> 02:36:47,073
[SPEAKER_02]: So that behavior might change pretty soon.

2085
02:36:49,580 --> 02:36:50,140
[SPEAKER_11]: It depends.

2086
02:36:50,201 --> 02:36:58,927
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I don't think it's going to change unless it's in the ruling that if a store is caught doing it, that store is going to get fined for it.

2087
02:36:59,027 --> 02:36:59,747
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I'm saying?

2088
02:36:59,787 --> 02:37:00,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try this way.

2089
02:37:01,108 --> 02:37:02,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you can agree with this, Ranma.

2090
02:37:03,029 --> 02:37:08,373
[SPEAKER_02]: If a 16-year-old wants to get a dirty game, that 16-year-old will get the dirty game.

2091
02:37:08,633 --> 02:37:09,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Lobby damned.

2092
02:37:11,127 --> 02:37:13,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Amiga777 in our chatroom is asking, what's Black Luigi?

2093
02:37:13,247 --> 02:37:16,268
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we call Rama, because he's black and he cosplays as Luigi.

2094
02:37:35,888 --> 02:37:40,552
[SPEAKER_02]: and he always seems to get on camera whenever, you know, he's at one of these Nintendo events.

2095
02:37:40,592 --> 02:37:43,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, wasn't he on CNN or something for the Wii event?

2096
02:37:43,175 --> 02:37:43,515
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2097
02:37:43,955 --> 02:37:45,677
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, he's Black Luigi.

2098
02:37:46,438 --> 02:37:46,718
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2099
02:37:47,338 --> 02:37:49,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take some more calls.

2100
02:37:49,601 --> 02:37:53,124
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2101
02:37:53,464 --> 02:37:55,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get some time to round up some stories, Loki?

2102
02:37:55,806 --> 02:37:56,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2103
02:37:56,267 --> 02:37:57,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, too bad because we got another call coming in.

2104
02:37:57,988 --> 02:37:59,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I didn't want to say it.

2105
02:37:59,269 --> 02:37:59,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, all right then.

2106
02:38:00,290 --> 02:38:01,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2107
02:38:01,451 --> 02:38:01,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2108
02:38:03,491 --> 02:38:05,192
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Misty.

2109
02:38:05,333 --> 02:38:10,336
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing pretty good.

2110
02:38:10,777 --> 02:38:18,202
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking back to around the beginning of the show where you were basically like, we've had a shit ton of guests lately.

2111
02:38:18,522 --> 02:38:19,323
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we have.

2112
02:38:19,503 --> 02:38:25,368
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I'd like to confirm one that's going to be on the show on August 8th.

2113
02:38:26,048 --> 02:38:26,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Who would that be?

2114
02:38:28,310 --> 02:38:29,110
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be me.

2115
02:38:29,531 --> 02:38:30,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're coming back, huh?

2116
02:38:32,552 --> 02:38:34,895
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided to suck it up and fly

2117
02:38:48,772 --> 02:38:50,553
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just... I'm messing around.

2118
02:38:50,593 --> 02:38:51,134
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be okay.

2119
02:38:51,995 --> 02:38:52,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's great.

2120
02:38:52,835 --> 02:38:58,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I got to ask this question because I don't know if we talked about it last time you were here, but you do not like to fly.

2121
02:38:59,100 --> 02:39:04,985
[SPEAKER_02]: And last time you came out here, you took Greyhound out here and a little bit of the train too, I think.

2122
02:39:05,305 --> 02:39:06,206
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you doing this time?

2123
02:39:06,246 --> 02:39:06,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you...

2124
02:39:07,267 --> 02:39:10,629
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the train last time, just the bus I've gotten a new phone since I've been out there and it's a twitchy little touchscreen once in a while

2125
02:39:27,659 --> 02:39:28,840
[SPEAKER_02]: For English, press 1.

2126
02:39:30,081 --> 02:39:32,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Para Español, marque numero 2.

2127
02:39:34,084 --> 02:39:36,205
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are you doing this time?

2128
02:39:36,225 --> 02:39:37,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you doing the Greyhound thing again?

2129
02:39:39,848 --> 02:39:43,811
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm doing to get out there is I'm flying southwest from St.

2130
02:39:43,851 --> 02:39:47,893
[SPEAKER_00]: Louis to L.A., taking Amtrak overnight from L.A.

2131
02:39:47,933 --> 02:39:48,634
[SPEAKER_00]: to Sacramento.

2132
02:39:49,094 --> 02:39:51,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the way back home, I'm taking the bus.

2133
02:39:51,803 --> 02:39:52,784
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2134
02:40:17,265 --> 02:40:27,110
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I'm not your doctor, so you might want to ask somebody, because I don't know what other medications you take, and I'd hate to have you mix.

2135
02:40:27,410 --> 02:40:37,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what else you take, and Tylenol may not mix, but just take a sleep aid that's approved by your doctor, and that might help with the anxiety.

2136
02:40:39,136 --> 02:40:40,817
[SPEAKER_02]: because I've had friends that have to do that.

2137
02:40:40,857 --> 02:40:47,960
[SPEAKER_02]: They get really anxious, especially if there's going to be turbulence or anything, which flying to LA, I think you get to dodge the Rockies a little bit.

2138
02:40:47,980 --> 02:40:51,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you'll fly right over them, and that's where the worst turbulence is, but it'll be fine.

2139
02:40:52,002 --> 02:40:52,902
[SPEAKER_02]: I fly all the time.

2140
02:40:52,942 --> 02:40:53,402
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine.

2141
02:40:53,922 --> 02:40:54,803
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, you know what?

2142
02:40:55,283 --> 02:41:06,308
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably saw on the news, not that far here from Sacramento, there was a horrible Greyhound bus accident, and I would have been extremely sad if Misty had been on that bus, so I think you'll be all right with flying.

2143
02:41:07,268 --> 02:41:13,590
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't read that yet, but keep in mind my computer's not unlimited to doing shit on my iPod right now.

2144
02:41:15,090 --> 02:41:18,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're going to be just fine with that.

2145
02:41:18,411 --> 02:41:20,332
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not drink and you know that.

2146
02:41:21,552 --> 02:41:25,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I'll let you go so you can go beat up some chatters with your fist.

2147
02:41:26,693 --> 02:41:28,514
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can yell at them in person when you're here in a couple weeks.

2148
02:41:28,774 --> 02:41:29,314
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see you then.

2149
02:41:31,483 --> 02:41:41,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, take care Misty's gonna be on the show She will be on my couch I had to make sure that I was actually gonna be here Because I was worried for a minute that she was only here for the weekend What's that?

2150
02:41:41,892 --> 02:41:56,344
[SPEAKER_02]: She's gonna be on the 8th, I think that's the night after Showgirls It is the night after Showgirls But I'll be back in town on the 8th So I'll be here, she's here during the week I guess So we'll have to all get Indian food or something I don't know What are we gonna do with Misty?

2151
02:41:56,365 --> 02:41:57,886
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you gonna do with Misty for like 4 days?

2152
02:41:59,469 --> 02:42:05,332
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking going to Dave and Buster's and going to Arviggle.

2153
02:42:06,033 --> 02:42:07,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's throw in a dumpster.

2154
02:42:07,654 --> 02:42:11,316
[SPEAKER_07]: And going by the little ghetto arcade over there where the Parapara is.

2155
02:42:11,376 --> 02:42:11,856
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be fun.

2156
02:42:11,896 --> 02:42:13,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Because she really wants to play Parapara.

2157
02:42:13,657 --> 02:42:14,137
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be fun.

2158
02:42:14,657 --> 02:42:15,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to another call.

2159
02:42:15,518 --> 02:42:17,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2160
02:42:17,759 --> 02:42:19,940
[SPEAKER_02]: For English, press 1.

2161
02:42:20,140 --> 02:42:21,501
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.

2162
02:42:21,541 --> 02:42:22,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, who's this?

2163
02:42:24,083 --> 02:42:24,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, this is X-Link.

2164
02:42:25,043 --> 02:42:25,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, X-Link.

2165
02:42:25,704 --> 02:42:26,244
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

2166
02:42:27,062 --> 02:42:28,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, actually, I want to call back up your things.

2167
02:42:28,644 --> 02:42:30,147
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, about the law.

2168
02:42:30,307 --> 02:42:35,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I live here in Florida, which is probably supposedly be one of the states, which I really don't think it's going to pass, personally.

2169
02:42:35,955 --> 02:42:42,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Ranma said, I really think it's going to go through a lot of loopholes before anything gets passed through a lot of these different states.

2170
02:42:43,526 --> 02:42:49,973
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the companies too, I'm noticing now, are trying to do things so they won't get in trouble.

2171
02:42:50,234 --> 02:42:52,056
[SPEAKER_04]: God forbid something like this would pass.

2172
02:42:53,477 --> 02:42:57,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Recently, I bought a computer game from Target, the F.A.W.

2173
02:42:57,842 --> 02:43:00,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Collection, and I was surprised that I got ID'd for it.

2174
02:43:02,799 --> 02:43:10,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Which took me by surprise because that's the first time ever buying a game from say like Target or someplace like that where I actually got carded for the game for being mature.

2175
02:43:11,065 --> 02:43:13,806
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was very shocking to say the least.

2176
02:43:13,926 --> 02:43:19,490
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was very cool though because at least it shows that they're trying to take the appropriate steps to make sure something like this happens.

2177
02:43:19,510 --> 02:43:21,792
[SPEAKER_04]: But I agree with you, there is a valid point.

2178
02:43:22,432 --> 02:43:24,494
[SPEAKER_04]: X-Link, how do you have time to play Fallout?

2179
02:43:24,514 --> 02:43:28,278
[SPEAKER_04]: You play just as much WoW as I do, and I don't have time for other video games.

2180
02:43:28,578 --> 02:43:29,039
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you do it?

2181
02:43:44,884 --> 02:43:45,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

2182
02:43:45,305 --> 02:43:45,865
[SPEAKER_04]: That's terrible.

2183
02:44:03,411 --> 02:44:03,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.

2184
02:44:04,151 --> 02:44:08,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, sorry to hear it, but I'm glad you're building the collection.

2185
02:44:08,032 --> 02:44:09,152
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Saga Frontier I liked.

2186
02:44:09,232 --> 02:44:11,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe you're sitting there bashing it.

2187
02:44:11,253 --> 02:44:16,934
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually, it wasn't great, it wasn't the best, but the storyline was alright.

2188
02:44:17,034 --> 02:44:19,435
[SPEAKER_04]: And besides, you can play as somebody going around getting drunk.

2189
02:44:19,475 --> 02:44:22,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I love how you're lowering the bar as you're reviewing it.

2190
02:44:22,055 --> 02:44:23,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, wasn't that good?

2191
02:44:23,456 --> 02:44:27,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't that, you know, there's always one at every party.

2192
02:44:30,611 --> 02:44:31,112
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good.

2193
02:44:31,752 --> 02:44:32,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't judge you for it.

2194
02:44:34,654 --> 02:44:34,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2195
02:44:36,235 --> 02:44:36,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it?

2196
02:44:37,075 --> 02:44:38,016
[SPEAKER_02]: You got something else?

2197
02:44:38,816 --> 02:44:39,597
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much about it.

2198
02:44:39,737 --> 02:44:41,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well thank you as always, X-Link.

2199
02:44:42,098 --> 02:44:42,859
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a wonderful week.

2200
02:44:43,479 --> 02:44:44,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Always, you too.

2201
02:44:44,119 --> 02:44:45,420
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll try to farm Kara tonight, okay?

2202
02:44:46,381 --> 02:44:47,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sounds like fun.

2203
02:44:47,341 --> 02:44:47,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell the guild.

2204
02:44:47,942 --> 02:44:48,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

2205
02:44:48,622 --> 02:44:49,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, bye-bye.

2206
02:44:51,605 --> 02:44:53,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2207
02:44:53,887 --> 02:44:57,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys so much for your phone calls here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2208
02:44:57,949 --> 02:44:58,509
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate it.

2209
02:44:58,549 --> 02:45:05,894
[SPEAKER_02]: If you didn't get through, why don't you leave us a voicemail on the Skype line, or of course you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

2210
02:45:06,154 --> 02:45:08,876
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Twitters, there's lots of ways to get through to the show.

2211
02:45:09,296 --> 02:45:10,316
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's it, we're going to wrap up.

2212
02:45:10,396 --> 02:45:11,477
[SPEAKER_02]: No last minute stories, right?

2213
02:45:11,777 --> 02:45:12,298
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.

2214
02:45:12,578 --> 02:45:14,499
[SPEAKER_02]: What does Loki got for last minute stories?

2215
02:45:14,999 --> 02:45:19,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Dead Rising 2K0 will be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade August 31st.

2216
02:45:20,106 --> 02:45:26,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course it will be kind of a prequel or in between sequel for the Dead Rising series.

2217
02:45:26,814 --> 02:45:28,817
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes place between Dead Rising 1 and 2.

2218
02:45:30,398 --> 02:45:56,413
[SPEAKER_05]: and also you'll be able to kind of level up your character and stuff that you earn in that game will also transfer over to Dead Rising 2 the best thing about it though it will only cost you $5 so that is awesome for what may be considered I haven't seen anything on arcade for $5 in a long time exactly

2219
02:45:59,537 --> 02:46:03,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, Netflix is apparently going discless by October.

2220
02:46:04,159 --> 02:46:05,340
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're going to eventually have an app.

2221
02:46:05,720 --> 02:46:12,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you may say that's probably when the exclusivity contract ran out for having the in-dash stuff.

2222
02:46:14,344 --> 02:46:16,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Rockman 3's got some more tracks announced for it.

2223
02:46:18,066 --> 02:46:20,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody Wants to Rule the World by Tears for Fears.

2224
02:46:21,428 --> 02:46:22,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Rock Lobster by the B-52s.

2225
02:46:24,129 --> 02:46:24,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

2226
02:46:24,669 --> 02:46:33,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Foolin' by Def Leppard, Beautiful People by Marilyn Manson, Hey Man, Nice Shot by Filter, Cold as Ice by Foreigner.

2227
02:46:33,574 --> 02:46:35,955
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also Dance Central has three songs announced for it.

2228
02:46:36,475 --> 02:46:42,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Drop It Like It's Hot by Snoop Dogg, Push It by Salt-N-Pepa, and Bust a Move by Young MC.

2229
02:46:45,520 --> 02:46:46,040
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

2230
02:46:46,200 --> 02:46:48,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think Rock Lobster might sound something like this?

2231
02:46:48,361 --> 02:46:49,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait one, sit down.

2232
02:46:49,742 --> 02:46:53,344
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to sing a little song that kept me going when I had troubles.

2233
02:46:59,312 --> 02:47:00,312
[SPEAKER_09]: We were at the beach.

2234
02:47:01,953 --> 02:47:04,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody had matching towels.

2235
02:47:04,513 --> 02:47:08,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody went under a duck and there they saw a rock.

2236
02:47:09,655 --> 02:47:10,915
[SPEAKER_09]: But it wasn't a rock.

2237
02:47:12,536 --> 02:47:14,896
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a rock lobster!

2238
02:47:15,616 --> 02:47:18,657
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it's going to sound like in my house.

2239
02:47:19,938 --> 02:47:20,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Rock lobster!

2240
02:47:21,178 --> 02:47:21,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Rock lobster!

2241
02:47:21,818 --> 02:47:24,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I'm over it.

2242
02:47:26,184 --> 02:47:29,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well if that's going to do it for Last Minute Stories tonight, then let's go around.

2243
02:47:31,426 --> 02:47:32,827
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no bird is the word.

2244
02:47:32,847 --> 02:47:34,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going there again.

2245
02:47:36,168 --> 02:47:37,809
[SPEAKER_02]: But surely you've heard.

2246
02:47:39,950 --> 02:47:42,271
[SPEAKER_05]: I already put that in as a cage match, okay?

2247
02:47:44,924 --> 02:47:47,147
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost want to play it, but I'm not going to, I promise.

2248
02:47:47,207 --> 02:47:49,389
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, quick, let's end the show before I play it.

2249
02:47:49,770 --> 02:47:55,496
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts, but not before I thank Salacious Pop for joining us tonight here in studio.

2250
02:47:55,517 --> 02:47:56,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you had a fun time.

2251
02:47:56,558 --> 02:47:59,241
[SPEAKER_02]: I did, as always.

2252
02:47:59,281 --> 02:48:01,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you listen, and you comment in chat, and sometimes you're here.

2253
02:48:01,684 --> 02:48:03,346
[SPEAKER_02]: How is the show different between the two?

2254
02:48:05,463 --> 02:48:07,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2255
02:48:07,645 --> 02:48:09,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Behind the scenes is just a different perspective.

2256
02:48:11,128 --> 02:48:13,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a lot less nervous this time than I was the first two times.

2257
02:48:13,870 --> 02:48:15,051
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my third time on the show.

2258
02:48:15,952 --> 02:48:16,472
[SPEAKER_02]: You do well.

2259
02:48:17,453 --> 02:48:19,475
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is, he's really funny, you guys.

2260
02:48:19,495 --> 02:48:20,996
[SPEAKER_02]: He makes a lot of really funny chat comments.

2261
02:48:21,016 --> 02:48:21,817
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I read him.

2262
02:48:21,837 --> 02:48:28,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not doing like, he gets more chat comments in because he's my boyfriend or whatever, but he actually says a lot of funny stuff.

2263
02:48:29,783 --> 02:48:31,625
[SPEAKER_02]: So we like getting more of that funny stuff here on the show.

2264
02:48:32,385 --> 02:48:32,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2265
02:48:32,845 --> 02:48:37,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Go home and write some jokes and we're going to do like a last comic standing with you and Drew Nami, okay?

2266
02:48:37,488 --> 02:48:42,532
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I got an idea for my next little animated movie from this episode.

2267
02:48:43,092 --> 02:48:43,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you?

2268
02:48:43,692 --> 02:48:44,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2269
02:48:44,293 --> 02:48:47,194
[SPEAKER_03]: I did the really sort of foul World of Warcraft one.

2270
02:48:47,234 --> 02:48:47,715
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.

2271
02:48:47,755 --> 02:48:48,115
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.

2272
02:48:48,435 --> 02:48:48,916
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.

2273
02:48:49,116 --> 02:48:49,816
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to work on that.

2274
02:48:49,836 --> 02:48:50,817
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like fun.

2275
02:48:51,557 --> 02:48:54,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little worried as to what that's going to sound like, but we'll see.

2276
02:48:55,179 --> 02:48:57,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, do you have a final thought for us tonight?

2277
02:48:58,400 --> 02:49:03,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Video games are not the same as tobacco and alcohol, so that law is stupid.

2278
02:49:03,723 --> 02:49:05,544
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's no on that law.

2279
02:49:06,404 --> 02:49:07,145
[SPEAKER_02]: No on that law.

2280
02:49:07,185 --> 02:49:07,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Thumbs down.

2281
02:49:07,945 --> 02:49:09,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Too bad we don't get to vote on it.

2282
02:49:09,226 --> 02:49:09,666
[SPEAKER_03]: F minus.

2283
02:49:10,006 --> 02:49:11,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Dislike this post.

2284
02:49:11,126 --> 02:49:11,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2285
02:49:13,107 --> 02:49:14,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, your final thought tonight?

2286
02:49:14,428 --> 02:49:18,370
[SPEAKER_05]: That law sucks, but I don't care because I'm over 18, so suck it, children.

2287
02:49:21,544 --> 02:49:50,301
[SPEAKER_02]: my final thought tonight is congratulations to Extifer's sister Annie and her husband Jim who had their baby this week Oliver James last name Hill congratulations baby yay baby but can you imagine like I know Extifer hasn't been on the show in a very long time and I hope to change that but for those that have listened to OLR for a very long time can you imagine if Extifer was your gay uncle like I'm just saying DarkSakura your final thought tonight

2288
02:49:50,869 --> 02:49:50,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Ow.

2289
02:49:52,290 --> 02:49:52,630
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it?

2290
02:49:52,850 --> 02:49:52,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Ow?

2291
02:49:53,310 --> 02:49:53,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Ow.

2292
02:49:53,871 --> 02:49:55,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Reject false ows.

2293
02:49:55,892 --> 02:49:56,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Ow.

2294
02:49:56,692 --> 02:49:58,213
[SPEAKER_07]: That and I want a sewing machine.

2295
02:49:58,933 --> 02:49:59,653
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I want?

2296
02:50:00,234 --> 02:50:00,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Yogurt.

2297
02:50:01,249 --> 02:50:02,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, Rob.

2298
02:50:02,229 --> 02:50:03,390
[SPEAKER_07]: I want some frozen yogurt.

2299
02:50:03,490 --> 02:50:04,230
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to work tomorrow.

2300
02:50:04,250 --> 02:50:04,750
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying.

2301
02:50:04,950 --> 02:50:05,490
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't?

2302
02:50:05,810 --> 02:50:06,231
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't.

2303
02:50:07,191 --> 02:50:08,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hang out tomorrow.

2304
02:50:08,511 --> 02:50:10,532
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have to get car errands done.

2305
02:50:10,552 --> 02:50:11,412
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I took the day off.

2306
02:50:11,872 --> 02:50:14,593
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't hang out during the day, but maybe in the evening.

2307
02:50:15,213 --> 02:50:18,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Real quick, even though it's not the segment for it.

2308
02:50:19,155 --> 02:50:22,296
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to give an F you to 7sins.com.

2309
02:50:22,336 --> 02:50:23,316
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a modding forum.

2310
02:50:23,656 --> 02:50:26,577
[SPEAKER_05]: You have the worst server on the face of the earth.

2311
02:50:28,416 --> 02:50:29,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Worst server ever.

2312
02:50:30,018 --> 02:50:35,846
[SPEAKER_05]: It seriously times out and cannot connect more than any other site on the internet.

2313
02:50:38,683 --> 02:50:39,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's it.

2314
02:50:39,764 --> 02:50:41,784
