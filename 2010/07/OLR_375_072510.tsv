10267	24621	Sky, and Loki Tonight, July 25th, 2010 Worlds collide in two new fighting games announced at Comic Con Independent games are set to come to home And Rock Band 3 gets a release date
31860	41065	Hello my friends out there all over the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.
41185	47928	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be with you over the next few hours with my awesome co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
48188	48828	Hi!
49029	49569	How are you doing?
50329	51150	I'm amused.
51450	53071	I made that sound like it was all one name.
53111	54332	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
54352	57453	But it's actually DarkSakura is your online name and then Jamie Summers is your name name.
57794	58354	My stage name.
58394	59034	Your stage name.
59455	59655	Yes.
59995	61156	Now why are you amused tonight?
61296	68020	Because I'm looking at ThatWillBuffOut.com, which is part of the Fail Network or the I Love Cheeseburger Network.
68940	70002	Is that really all by the same people?
70022	70883	I guess it makes sense.
70903	74166	How much money do those guys have?
75007	80213	I have no idea, but this one, and I'll link it in the chat room, this one pictures of a car wearing panties.
81875	82756	That's great!
82817	85840	I just want to point out what awesome radio you looking at pictures makes.
86881	88824	No, no, no, I'm, I'm, um, I...
89724	92225	I am here, my stitches are out.
94326	99009	But you're still on vitamin V. I am on the V. I'm hyped up on the V. Bike it in!
99049	99649	Congratulations.
99689	102290	Because my hand still has a hole in it.
103151	105632	There's a part that the stitches didn't clear up all the way.
106252	108233	So I put pictures on Facebook to show my mommy.
109353	111494	Which is why I put them on Facebook, is to show my mommy.
112795	117157	And I'm still quite bandaged up, although not to the extent I was last time.
117497	118518	And it hurts us, Rob.
118618	119018	It hurts us.
119218	119599	TechMasterLoki
136558	138539	What's new in Loki's world?
139699	140999	You guys finished the nursery, right?
141140	142040	Well, it's not finished.
142560	144180	He's been inhaling a lot of paint fumes.
144200	147662	We have just very few things left to do on it.
148182	149102	It's pretty much done.
149142	151763	It's just the finishing touches, I guess.
151783	155024	We have to shade the hills or put a little highlight on them.
155604	162106	So I had to mix some paint with this blending medium stuff to make it very transparent.
162626	183622	and then I have to paint one more hill and just like some small stuff but it's basically done I would have taken more pictures but Nellie said that you know I shouldn't take any more pictures until it's done because it ruins the wow effect all right well we'll be waiting to be wowed it won't be as much of an epic mount all right
184483	187005	Let's also introduce, we do have a special guest here in studio.
187025	188747	We've been having a lot of extra people in studio lately.
188807	189387	That's a good thing.
189427	191889	We like having another person here to kind of mix things up a little bit.
192570	195552	Tonight is somebody you've heard over the past few episodes.
195592	197174	Say hello to Salacious Pop.
197474	197834	Hello.
198095	198435	How are you?
198735	199075	I'm great.
199456	200477	Can we even hear you tonight?
201638	201938	I don't know.
202218	202799	Are we hearing you?
202819	203599	Test, test.
203619	204240	Yeah, we're hearing you.
204260	204940	It's just kind of quiet.
205000	205301	I don't know.
205661	206121	Don't be afraid.
206141	209204	Just treat that microphone like it's ice cream.
209604	210265	Alright, there you go.
210785	212267	So, what's new in your world?
212287	212687	How are you doing?
213672	214053	Not much.
214714	217961	Got some new games for my birthday that I'll be talking about that I've been playing.
218141	218482	Okay.
218943	219404	Sounds good.
219564	220847	So we'll get to those in a little bit.
221529	228474	And for those that may not know, you have the unique distinction of also being my boyfriend, to which I'm sure a lot of the listeners are like, oh, that poor guy.
228855	232037	But yeah, so we went out last night, actually.
232077	234279	We went to see Adam Lambert in concert.
234579	235159	Yes, we did.
235380	236761	Speaking of gays.
237081	237341	Wow.
237661	238162	Yeah, right?
238222	238862	No, here's the thing.
238902	240103	No, I mean, is he any good?
240123	244026	Because I just remember like, oh, I hope he wins because I don't like the other person.
244146	245207	And then he lost.
245615	247077	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
261691	263793	I kind of feel bad, but that's just the kind of person my mom is.
263813	266015	Once she kind of makes her mind up, there ain't no changing it.
266075	270638	So we went instead with some other friends, and I don't know.
271599	274922	I thought it was fine, but it was weird that people were getting into a fight.
275062	275382	I don't know.
275402	276383	What did you think of the concert?
277516	278377	I want to paint his hair.
294212	294993	I'd say he won me over.
295273	296173	His wig, I'm sure.
296573	297253	That can't be real.
298194	299854	His do can't be real.
299914	301215	Tell the listeners real quick about the fight.
301235	302516	We will get to video games, I promise.
302876	310479	So we were up in the bleachers, way in the back, and about three rows in front of us, off to the left, a fight.
310519	315481	Well, not a real fight, but these ladies were dancing and standing up and having a good time.
315501	316081	We call them glamas.
316281	317001	Yeah, glamas.
317602	321023	Were standing up dancing, as one would at a rock concert.
321563	331985	and this sort of drunk, resentful husband who was probably dragged there by his wife really took offense to the fact that they were standing and he decided to call them out and get really belligerent.
332025	336106	Because you need to know the crowd was totally like the real housewives of Sacramento County.
336606	338967	I mean, Dina Lohan's all over, wherever you look.
339127	345528	I think on the Venn diagram of shame, there's definitely some overlap between Adam Lambert fans and like Twi moms.
346188	349109	I think there are a lot of, yeah, quite a bit.
350983	352904	We got to watch Security come in.
353104	355426	Yes, Security gave them a stern talking to.
357007	359048	There was a point where I was like, am I serious?
359068	362570	Because I've gone to a lot of concerts before, and I've never seen a fight.
362670	366152	So it's like, am I really going to see people throw down at Adam Lambert?
366332	367493	Is this real life?
368413	369714	Yeah, it's pretty surreal.
370054	370535	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
387390	388731	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
407848	412731	Wheel of Fortune slot machine, and it's not like, I mean, there's been Wheel of Fortune slot machines for years.
412751	412971	Oh, it's big.
413331	415332	But there's this- Like the huge, mongous, wall-sized one?
415392	415773	Yes.
415853	416273	Yeah.
416313	418114	It looks like Derby Owner's Club to me.
418714	423617	Like, remember- No, I thought you were talking about, like, the five-cent, the nickel slots where they had, like, the giant wheel that spins.
423637	433083	Oh, yeah, there's that, too, but now there's one with a giant monitor, and I guess the bonus round on that one, you touch letters to complete the puzzle on the giant board, and it's multiple players doing it at once.
433143	433503	It's weird.
433523	433603	Yeah.
433923	438946	They have Vanna White, like, the real Vanna White, doing record, like, she's the bumpers between rounds.
439046	440047	Like, good luck, everybody.
440067	442028	And it's really her in HD.
442088	443008	It's very creepy.
443088	445570	Well, it's also creepy, like, isn't she, like, 80 years old?
445610	446691	And she still looks like she's, like, 30.
447311	449412	Like, she's made a pact with the devil, clearly.
449592	450973	Plastic surgery.
451573	461399	She's just using, you know, some different cosmetics from Umbrella Corporation, you know, to keep her cells nice and rejuvenated.
462089	463533	Well, you've seen that movie Death Becomes Her?
463934	464034	Yes.
464054	464876	She's made of porcelain.
465257	465577	Wow.
465898	466559	She's ceramic.
468142	473284	I did have to talk to one lady though in the casino because she had her sign with her that said, I'm 70 and I love Adam.
474144	476645	Because she reminded me of my mom because my mom's also just about 70.
477045	477185	She's 69.
477945	479506	Anyway, okay, enough Adam.
479946	483587	I swear that is like the most Adam Lambert chat you will ever hear on Orange Lounge Radio.
483847	484467	I apologize.
485027	486107	But we do talk about video games.
486127	487328	We're going to get into those in just a minute.
487368	488388	I had to go to our chat room though.
488668	489428	We love the chatters.
489668	495110	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com They're always here with us every Sunday night as we do tape live at All Games Radio.
495510	518378	Every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, www.allgames.com Right after the Bobby Blackwolf show And of course, big, major, massive, super props to Bobby Blackwolf Who just turned 5 years old this week He can get a kindergarten His show, not him, his show Alright, and actually it was his 5 year of podcasting Because I think he had like a life through his 5 things like we used to have
518618	519539	This is gaming related.
519559	521420	You've got to stop with the pictures.
521440	522941	Okay, I'm going to leave this one in the chat room.
523321	523662	Put it away.
523782	524702	I'm leaving this in the chat room.
524943	527424	All right, link it in the chat room so that way our live chatters can see it.
527464	531587	Unfortunately, those listening on the podcast, well, it's just more incentive to join us live.
531647	533229	Exactly, that's why I do this.
533837	534678	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
562153	563253	Oh, the new one here in Roseville.
563293	565054	It's tiny and loud.
565214	565994	Oh my god, loud.
566975	570296	But we played this tank game.
570376	571716	It's a Namco tank game.
571776	573337	I can't remember what it's called.
573757	574757	But it was pretty fun.
575217	576458	Wait, your mic is totally cut out.
576478	580779	You gotta check the... I think the connection is weird.
580839	581879	Sorry guys, live radio.
582059	583600	Jamie's mic is doing weird stuff.
585319	586280	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
604449	606371	I really need a new blender, apparently.
609355	612039	We did this Typhoon thing, which is more like a ride.
613281	617166	They do a minecart one.
617666	618267	Can you guys switch?
619128	620070	I don't know what's going on with that mic.
620530	621051	Hey, is this?
621211	621732	Wow, I'm loud.
621752	622452	Yeah, it's much better.
622512	623093	All right, go ahead.
623614	626096	Anyway, so we played the tank game that Namco did.
626176	631462	We played this Typhoon thing, which is like a bunch of different rides all in one.
632183	636047	And we did a pinball one, which was kind of throws you around a pinball game.
636067	637769	It was pretty cool because, of course, we had to do pinball.
638670	640192	And then we...
644464	656414	I played more token stuff and then I started playing Ragnarok online again because it's easier to do with my hand being kind of messed up.
656874	660378	But I did play some Star Trek online and I'm at Captain 8 now.
661438	663000	What exactly does Captain 8 mean?
663590	668534	It means that I've got two more levels until I'm a rear admiral, pretty much.
669154	671035	So are those like levels in other MMOs?
671075	671316	Okay.
671336	676399	Okay, because like you start off, because you know, they're set up like a military organization.
676459	677100	They go by rank.
677760	679542	And then you've got divisions in each rank, so...
680702	681804	So I'm getting up there.
682444	691532	Actually, I found out that while a lot of the earlier missions are lame, the upper captain level and admiral level missions are really freaking fun.
692393	694015	So I've been having a good time.
694055	705045	It's especially funny watching, although I've had such a hard time playing when I've just taken my Vicodin, because then I totally focus on one thing when I'm on Vicodin.
705445	724707	it's like I have instead of ADD I have like hyper focus disorder or something and get fixated on one major thing at a time so it's really kind of hard to multitask hence me looking at all these pictures during the show and not being able to look away from them I don't know what you're talking about
727179	731560	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
758835	760656	and you have to find the golden suit.
760676	763276	It's this really bizarre little game.
765097	769378	It's awfully cutesy and I was surprised that Dan suggested it to me to play.
769878	771419	But it's really fun.
771479	776760	I've been playing a little bit of that and trying to go back and play Oendan except I'm right-handed.
777260	778541	My stitches are on my right hand.
780061	781581	My incision is on my right hand.
781681	783742	So I can't play Oendan very well.
783802	785903	Especially, again, when I'm on Vicodin.
787103	787283	So...
787782	795305	I gotta tell you guys before the show I said something and Jamie flipped me off and it actually put her in pain because she's like I haven't flipped anyone off since I had my surgery.
796045	816373	Rob's the first person I flipped off and because the whole thing is that my flexibility is coming back in my hand and I can make a sort of fist and I can sort of extend it except I can't apparently make a fist and extend a finger at the same time because then it hurts and it made me want to cry and I blame Rob because Rob evoked the finger.
817788	818449	I play other stuff.
818529	818649	Um...
833618	851577	I don't remember Vitamin V is taking effect everybody I played Mahjong before class on my netbook and I found that my SNES 9X emulator works very well for Linux on my netbook so I can play Super Nintendo games before class
851986	880270	you should check out the Castlevania puzzle game that just came out on iPhone cause although it looked really weird from the screenshots I've been hearing a lot of good things about it I just picked it up actually cause I had $40 worth of iTunes credit for my birthday from various gift cards so I picked it up cause it was like 4 or 5 bucks I don't remember and it just kind of made me think of you cause I know you're a big Castlevania fan girl and you like puzzle games too I was wanting to play it but I I almost downloaded the Silent Hill game and no no the Silent Hill game is junk it's on my phone if you want to play it it's not that great
880530	882232	It's like a first person thing.
882292	887336	It's not like the actual Silent Hill games at all.
887897	898487	We've also been redoing The Vault, Dan and I. I decided this and he better go along with it or else that we're going to play through Sonic Adventure.
900268	902611	I like how you have the dual TVs all set up in there.
902671	903351	You know what they were?
903832	905313	They were Xbox...
907867	910047	monitors from kiosks.
910128	913228	From certain stores' kiosks.
913768	915428	Dan was just told that he could take everything.
915508	923250	So we've got broken Xboxes and broken Wiis and semi-working Wiis and a bunch of cables and those monitors and crap.
924250	926350	He's putting them to proper use in the vault.
926430	929651	And I'll post pictures of the vault in progress.
929771	931031	In fact, I'll go do that right now.
931731	935472	I'm going to find the name of that game because it's going to bother the crap out of me until I figure it out.
935672	939394	Alright, so when Jamie runs in here and yells something completely random, that's the aim.
939774	941955	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
942215	943655	Now you have to stop looking at pictures.
944056	945156	What are those, SD cards?
945236	946036	Are you SD card shopping?
946056	950939	It's compact flash cards, and yes, I am shopping for compact flash cards.
952179	956882	for something I'm working on because I can't go without having six projects at one time.
957163	964348	Although I did cancel one project because I don't really give a crap about making it, you know, a cardboard arcade cabinet anymore.
964588	965028	What project?
965048	965428	Oh, the cardboard.
965528	966309	Oh, a project under $100 may...
967990	969791	I want to interject I want to interject
994511	995554	What were you interjecting?
995574	997939	It's Henry Hatsworth and the Puzzling Adventure.
997959	998500	Oh, okay.
1000244	1000906	I could have told you that.
1004784	1011470	So yeah, what I'm working on right now, my friend gave me one of these old, I don't even know what they are.
1011530	1014874	They're like, remember those Tiger Electronics games and stuff?
1014914	1018957	Not necessarily like Game & Watch, but something similar to that.
1019338	1020959	And it's a Frogger game.
1021440	1027826	And it's set up inside of what looks like a bar top arcade cabinet, except it's just plastic and it's really tiny.
1028446	1036008	and I was looking at it and I'm like, because the first thing that comes to my mind for anything, it's like, I wonder if I could put an arcade game inside this thing.
1036549	1041650	And so, I've kind of challenged myself to do that for no apparent reason whatsoever.
1041670	1043631	I've seen that before, like the little bit.
1044131	1047633	Like all the... It's kind of like an LED game, but it's in color.
1047653	1048674	And it's Frogger.
1048714	1049695	I think I've seen one of those before.
1049715	1051736	Aren't they like all red or all orange or something?
1051796	1052517	I know they're monochrome.
1052537	1053157	Not all of them.
1053337	1054898	I've seen ones that are multiple colors.
1054918	1057640	They have just like an overlay on them that gives them the colors.
1057740	1059001	But yeah, it's basically that.
1059521	1064564	So what I would be doing is I'd be ripping out the guts of the inside of whatever this thing is.
1064784	1078173	I'd actually probably be using the joystick that's on there, not really even replacing any of the buttons, but just wiring them up to some sort of like iPack type thing, probably a mini pack, and then running that through, which I just bought.
1078513	1089500	because I bid sniped someone and won an auction for a Nano ITX PC, which they're really small, but it's actually a little big for what I need it to be put in.
1089520	1092481	So I got to put the board in at an angle and hopefully that fits.
1092742	1093542	I'm not sure.
1093662	1094943	So that'll be fun.
1095523	1096664	Otherwise, I'll use it for something else.
1097084	1099626	But I have a three and a half inch...
1101787	1103268	Mini Mame Mini Mame
1125399	1126640	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1146554	1151437	There's just no one online at all playing, you know, Battle of the Gay Tony.
1151857	1156799	Not, I mean, there's more people playing that than Lost and Damned, but there's really no one playing Lost and Damned right now.
1158320	1168985	Which, you know, I think this is about the right time to finally get those mods working, which I'm hopefully going to start working on some more once I get done painting the baby's room, which I'm very close.
1169005	1169966	We'll probably finish it this week.
1169986	1173568	And then that baby's going to get here and all your projects just got canceled.
1173788	1174268	No, they haven't.
1175089	1175969	That's what you think.
1177526	1179048	You are wrong, sir.
1179809	1179989	No.
1180489	1184254	I'm just saying Project Baby is going to take a lot of time.
1184574	1186196	It's not going to take that much time.
1186236	1186897	Babies just sleep.
1186917	1187978	I beg to differ.
1188298	1191181	They sleep and then you feed them and then you poke at them and you're done.
1191201	1192142	That's not going to last.
1192203	1196247	Yeah, we'll be saving this little clip and playing it for Loki a year after that kid's born.
1196267	1197028	We'll see what he thinks.
1197208	1202733	Hey, I'm well aware of what babies do, and yeah, they wake you up in the middle of the night and you're tired, okay?
1202873	1203493	I get that.
1203553	1210639	That does not stop me from, say, spending a few minutes here and there to build crap.
1210859	1211320	I don't know.
1212000	1215563	I need gamer daddies to email the show to give Loki some advice.
1216564	1218025	I just want to hear from some gamer daddies.
1218525	1218866	That's all.
1220163	1224766	Right, I'm just saying, there's two of us, we don't need to juggle the baby.
1224806	1229268	I mean, I will be taking care of the baby, but... Yeah, if you juggle the baby, CPS might get called.
1229969	1230489	They might.
1230509	1234451	Especially since they can't juggle anything, so that's not good.
1234892	1237213	Now, I'm not worried about that stuff.
1237273	1238934	I don't think it's really going to change anything.
1240735	1242676	I have known a number of people who said that.
1244389	1245770	Alright, we'll stop picking on Loki.
1245810	1246430	Go ahead, come on.
1246670	1249391	I'm just saying that I don't think it will affect anything.
1250251	1250792	That's fine.
1250832	1253232	I don't need 80,000 projects going on at one time.
1254393	1256354	But I will find excuses to do that.
1257834	1265197	Okay, so anyways, besides all that stuff, and of course more Crackdown 2, I'm not really enjoying this game as much as the first one.
1265857	1268358	Probably because this game is very similar to the first one.
1269339	1271720	Which, you know, wouldn't be so bad, but it's just...
1273354	1287000	They really kind of took away all the open world part of the game because the open world stuff is still there but my god is that guy who's the voiceover guy is such a nagging bitch.
1287180	1287860	It's annoying.
1288360	1290421	It's like, you should go to this rooftop race.
1290561	1291021	Fuck that.
1291161	1293422	I will do the rooftop race when I feel like it.
1293522	1294683	No, you should do it now.
1295123	1295963	I will do it later.
1296203	1297024	Do it now!
1297224	1298704	Are you trying to piss me off?
1299145	1300065	Oh god, I hated that.
1300425	1312353	Stop killing... I'll jump down and the other... Not agents, but the peacekeepers will be there and they'll get injured.
1312694	1315195	Or I'll blow up a car and some shrapnel will hit them.
1315796	1318158	Stop injuring the peacekeepers.
1318218	1319438	They're hard at work.
1320359	1321860	Don't injure the civilians.
1322461	1323781	They need to like us.
1324182	1326884	My favorite... That peacekeeper had a wife and family.
1327464	1328705	Do you want to explain it to them?
1331744	1355244	and it's dumb and even when you do piss them off they send a hit squad after you and you just go up on the rooftops and they shoot at the building because they can't figure out how to hit you and then that goes away and they're all, hope you learned your lesson I'm like, nope didn't learn my lesson I'm gonna do it again, wee yeah, it's alright, it's just I don't know maybe the announcer's the last boss
1356155	1357276	It's not the last boss.
1380911	1383353	Wasn't that the twist in the original Metal Gear game?
1383993	1391418	That the big boss that was talking to you on the frequency thingy, he was the announcer, ended up being the last boss?
1392219	1392639	I think so.
1393119	1394880	Yeah, but I don't think this guy's the last boss.
1395621	1398423	It's just that the peacekeepers are evil.
1398563	1399283	Oh my god.
1399904	1401445	Someone that's helping you out is evil.
1401505	1403326	That twist has been done like 80,000 times.
1404147	1409730	And I know it's a spoiler, but hey, the original Crackdown game's been out for a few years now, so too bad.
1412452	1439052	whatever it doesn't matter to me but it's still fun I like playing it it's very the missions that you go on are very linear and granted that the first game the missions weren't that different but they did have some bosses that you fought granted they were very simply you just had to run up to them and roundhouse kick them a few times and they're dead but at least they had bosses
1440771	1441331	I don't know.
1441572	1443333	They could ramp up the difficulty and stuff.
1445174	1445514	They could.
1446235	1446475	All right.
1446775	1448396	Well, I guess that's it for Loki's Gaming Week.
1449137	1449617	How about Alan?
1449657	1450678	Do you want to talk about your Gaming Week?
1452039	1452519	Absolutely.
1452840	1453720	How's my mic doing?
1454121	1456202	I think you're okay.
1456282	1458043	Actually, you and Jamie should probably switch back again.
1458364	1458724	All right.
1459144	1460505	I think I fixed hers.
1460725	1461145	We'll see.
1461886	1462226	I don't know.
1462787	1463467	Bear with us, guys.
1463507	1464008	Live radio.
1464188	1464828	Want me to test?
1465388	1465989	Am I looking okay?
1466089	1466829	Well, we can hear you now.
1467010	1467250	Okay.
1467370	1467590	All right.
1468591	1468711	Hi.
1468751	1468791	Hi.
1469351	1474495	So my birthday was a couple weeks ago, and I picked up, or rather I got Bayonetta.
1475175	1476116	So I'm finally playing that.
1476156	1477336	I know that came out in January.
1477737	1478377	A lot of fun.
1478477	1479538	Been wanting to play it for a while.
1479978	1481399	I'm on the third stage.
1482280	1487883	So it's pretty much, you know, Devil May Cry, but with a sexy bitch killing everybody.
1489124	1493147	Puzzle Quest 2, and I played Puzzle Quest 1 on the DS.
1493167	1498270	I probably have about 130 hours on my save game, so I've been playing the hell out of the second one.
1498567	1500008	Wow, 130 hours.
1500048	1500729	That's a long game.
1500809	1501109	Yeah.
1501649	1503931	Well, I pretty much grinded everything to level 99.
1504452	1505312	That was grindable.
1505512	1506493	It was very, yeah.
1507374	1509335	So Puzzle Quest 2, WoW, of course.
1509876	1513298	Our guild tried to do a trial of the Crusader Ten Man.
1513379	1515300	It's the hardest raid we've tried in WoW.
1516021	1517662	We got about halfway through it before we gave up.
1518282	1519123	We had progress there.
1519964	1523947	And played some Left 4 Dead and played some Alien Swarm.
1525968	1526789	What did you think of Alien Swarm?
1528058	1528458	It's good.
1528698	1533003	It's the new four-player co-op game that Valve put out.
1533043	1534104	It is under the Valve name.
1534624	1539389	It's free, so whenever something is not horrible and free, it's usually worthy of a little bit of hype.
1540250	1542832	The gameplay is basically Gauntlet.
1543693	1572357	four player top down massive enemies coming at you so it's gauntlet crossed with the movie Aliens pretty much and there's the medic, the tech, the sergeant and the special ops and you play online with friends and each person has a special role and it's a lot of fun I downloaded it so we'll have to play it was free you can't argue with free, it's two gigs so yeah anything else in your gaming week you want to share with us?
1574758	1576560	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1594471	1596113	Thank you for watching!
1613295	1615037	Anyway, Alien Swarm.
1615418	1617080	Free on Steam right now.
1617320	1619402	There's really no reason not to get this game.
1619983	1620744	It's worth a look.
1620844	1629713	I mean, it's not like, oh my god, like Portal awesome or something, but it's the type of game you would pay like $10 to $15 on Xbox Live Arcade.
1630114	1633277	It feels a lot like an Xbox Live Arcade game to me, but it's not.
1633337	1633958	It's a PC game.
1634958	1659149	and it's very much I think Gauntlet kind of mixed with Aliens is good with a little Team Fortress 2 thrown in there because a lot of the classes kind of seem to come over from that and yeah it's fun and a lot of fun on the multiplayer so check that out I mean there's really no reason not to check out Alien Swarm unless you're like super anti-steam is about the only reason I can think of or your PC really really really blows which might be another reason
1659651	1668276	One thing that I really like about Valve is that they're very involved in the mod community for Half-Life and all that stuff.
1668376	1676820	And if you read the info on Alien Swarm, you will read that the developers for it are people from the mod community that Valve hired because they like their work.
1677081	1678862	So Valve actually hires out of...
1680002	1682465	The fan service projects.
1682585	1684227	And that's how Alien Swarm was made.
1684747	1687089	They hired out of the mod developers.
1696238	1724355	yeah but Yaris was different like I can't explain it like Yaris really really was I think the commercial tie-in had a lot to do with that like when you pay to have a game made that's basically a giant commercial I think you're kind of set up for disaster a little bit Alien Swarm is no commercial nothing it's just I honestly I think it's again to try and get Steam on more people's computers that's that's really what it boils down to because you know since you launch Steam to play the game you're gonna get tempted into these ads where it's you know $4
1726076	1727117	Thanks for watching!
1744464	1747446	Other games I played, I also played a little bit of Team Fortress 2.
1747866	1749067	I played more than the tutorial.
1749107	1751128	I actually was playing some offline games.
1751168	1755311	I'm not ready to fight the people online yet because I'm still scared because I'm not very good at it.
1755712	1758534	But I found that I was doing okay as a medic.
1759414	1760956	The White Mage, which I think...
1761756	1766158	Somebody had suggested in an email last week, and it was funny, because I said, yeah, I'll probably do the medic.
1766578	1772060	And it's kind of a different role, because instead of just running out there like all Quake-style, just running out in the front, die!
1772540	1777001	It's more, you know, you hang back with your team and actually heal people, and you can overheal.
1777281	1778362	I kind of liked what they did with it.
1778762	1779222	It's fun.
1779502	1783003	So I'm talking about all these games that are years old, because I played Left 4 Dead as well.
1783744	1785764	Finally got around to playing a little more of that.
1786224	1789206	Alan and I played a little bit together, and that was cool.
1789466	1789626	Just...
1790746	1791086	I don't know.
1791606	1801390	I think a lot of you guys have already played it, so for me to sit here and describe it after so long is probably a little ridiculous, but I guess if you haven't, just kind of imagine a first-person shooter that it takes a little bit of teamwork.
1801430	1811774	I mean, obviously Left 4 Dead is all about teamwork, and it's about the four people that are playing, although you can have everybody else be a computer player, but it is a little more fun to play at least with people you know.
1811854	1818317	I mean, you can go online and play with strangers, but it's fun when you play with people you know because then you can kind of joke and talk to each other, and Alan and I
1818717	1819378	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1840874	1843998	In the first one, probably the biker.
1844458	1845780	I'm totally blanking on his name.
1846561	1848523	But the guy with the handlebar mustache.
1848843	1849584	Yeah, he's funny.
1850104	1852667	In the second one, probably the redneck because he's so stupid.
1853328	1853969	Alright, very cool.
1855533	1883425	as far as other games I played this week, Puzzle Quest 2 gosh, almost the same games as Alan played this week, I don't know if there's anything unique I played that he didn't play Game Room, I don't think you really play Game Room, I play a little bit of that another one of my old favorite Activision classics Frostbite is scheduled for release this week, that was kind of a Frostbite is kind of like a ghetto frogger, really really ghetto frogger, so I'll be checking that out because I have fond childhood memories of that one
1884966	1887029	Alright, that's going to do it for our gaming week.
1887069	1890073	So we're going to get into the news and everything that's going on in the gaming world.
1890373	1892536	But first, we're going to do some housekeeping real quick.
1892556	1894879	I want to bring you guys up to speed on The Big Battle.
1895179	1900847	It's kind of going on all summer long at thebigbattle.net I think it's also available at bigbattle.allgames.com
1902088	1903649	TheBigBattle.net works just fine
1921497	1926141	Listeners of the shows, not necessarily the hosts, although I try to participate on at least games I own.
1926542	1930305	Listeners of the shows play their favorite games against listeners of other shows.
1930565	1933068	And it's just kind of like a big tournament type of thing.
1933908	1935670	High scores and leaderboards and all that.
1935690	1937612	And I think they're doing one tonight.
1937792	1938112	I don't know if...
1939093	1939574	and DarkSakura.com.
1961872	1978315	Riptide did very well there too AZHP made a showing and then we also made a showing on the Forza Motorsport 3 competition one of our listeners, I think just one charted over there Burr charted for us over there so he came in 6th place but that's certainly better than nothing
1978777	2006327	so um a very good job by Burr over there so we really appreciate that uh some things that are coming up in the near future Super Street Fighter 4 Trials HD and Shatter have both been announced as well so Super Street Fighter 4 I'm very excited about that one uh so we'll be checking those out a lot of you guys have been requesting other types of games PC games is one I've gotten a request for so I don't know how you might be able to do like a Team Fortress 2 battle but I'll try to look into it and see if we can get maybe Derek to schedule something like that that'd be cool
2006747	2006987	BigBattle.net
2030610	2033653	or I should say not in the actual Journey game but in a Journey-like game.
2034074	2038740	So he actually has started it and he's chronicling it in a little web series called Project Journey.
2039200	2043225	And there's actually little screenshots of me in like a breakout kind of game.
2043265	2043666	I don't know.
2044046	2048412	I'm curious to see how this turns out yet scared all at once.
2048942	2051664	I'm so excited, I'm so excited I'm so scared
2069915	2080599	Yes, we'll talk a little bit about Kinect and some of the stuff that was kind of rumored that we kind of figured was true, but it is true.
2081099	2082119	So we'll see.
2082700	2091403	Anyways, they announced that one of the things that was rumored that there's going to be a new Xbox 360 arcade system coming out this fall.
2091683	2092903	There is going to be a new one.
2093103	2093684	Now it's...
2094824	2101988	Bundled with a 4GB internal memory unit, kind of like how they were doing with the old arcade systems.
2102849	2104610	And so that's kind of neat.
2104990	2113935	And then, of course, you can put your own hard drive in there just like you can with the new S systems or whatever you want to call them.
2114135	2117397	Or use the USB because I think a lot of people are now using USB sticks.
2117477	2122940	You can also use USB sticks as well in there because there's plenty of USB ports on there now.
2123240	2123881	And that's kind of cool.
2124924	2125737	and um
2127256	2156390	yes and then also of course they're going to be doing a new oh and I'm sorry that will be bundled with Kinect that $300 one and of course there's also going to be a new just plain arcade system for $200 that's going to be coming out in August as well so that's kind of neat that they're going to be doing that I mean alternatives are wonderful Kinect is going to be priced at $150 as if all those retail listings you know
2158455	2185740	Microsoft's own website taking pre-orders didn't give it away yeah that's such an interesting price there didn't call that it does come with a free game which I may have hinted at before the free game is Connect Adventures kind of like their little Wii Play type game so that'll be bundled within of course for $150 and should be coming out well November 4th
2187300	2193343	Is Connect Adventures the one with the river rafting and the Pong-type game that was on Jimmy Fallon that one night?
2193363	2196044	Well, the Pong-type game, I think that's in Connect Sports.
2196665	2197505	Oh, okay.
2197565	2204428	But this had the obstacle course thing that they had, the river rafting, stuff like that.
2204528	2205649	So that would be kind of neat.
2206409	2211111	But hopefully when you cost average it out, it makes it a little bit more...
2212472	2213373	Beneficial, I guess.
2214033	2217976	But if I want this and Dance Central day one, that's going to cost me, what, $200, right?
2218016	2218116	Yes.
2218156	2221078	Because Kinect games are going to be $10 cheaper?
2221538	2222539	Yes, they're going to be only $50.
2222939	2223339	Okay.
2224000	2226201	So it's going to be $150 plus $50 plus tax.
2226461	2231685	So it's going to cost me about $220 to get Kinect and Dance Central day one.
2231905	2232085	Yes.
2232245	2233326	That's a bit of an investment.
2234227	2234567	It is.
2234747	2235147	Do you think...
2236528	2236808	DarkSakura.com
2256297	2274758	I think it may hurt the sales a little bit because it is pretty expensive but I mean they're trying to make it a little better because they're throwing in the game but when you look at it though with the new console when since it's being bundled with the new console then that really brings down the cost of the camera and I guess the software to $100.
2276079	2290305	So, I mean, are they losing money on the console or are they just, you know, adding some sort of profit margin in there for the actual, you know, accessory?
2290345	2294087	I can tell you right now, obviously, it may be $150 retail.
2294167	2295988	Obviously, that's not what they're selling them for.
2297088	2305312	You know, we probably work in about a 20% margin in there because that's usually I think what accessories go for is they have a 20% margin built in.
2306564	2312326	So if you figure that, I mean, they have to, I guess, leave room for the retailers to make some money.
2313087	2314487	Let me do a quick poll in our chat room.
2314547	2315007	Quick poll.
2315127	2319629	Will you buy Kinect and its buy-in game Kinect Adventures this year for $150?
2319709	2321570	That's what I want to know.
2321630	2322710	Quick poll in our chat room.
2323330	2325431	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to answer.
2325491	2325911	Quick poll.
2325931	2328372	I want to see some yeses and nos and maybe some brief reasons why.
2329013	2329713	Let's go around the room.
2330233	2332614	Who plans to buy Kinect and who says it's a waste of your time?
2332654	2333094	DarkSakura?
2334715	2335355	I like Lemonade.
2337179	2338159	What the hell does that mean?
2338519	2343161	But you collect peripherals, so are you going to buy it on that principle, or are you like, no, this is one I don't need?
2343801	2344842	Depends on what the money's like.
2345022	2347282	I mean, that's not really always the big thing for us.
2347322	2348683	We'll eventually have it, I'm sure.
2349203	2350263	We eventually get everything.
2350484	2353945	So it's kind of like your economic situation's going to be, okay, well, that's fair.
2354045	2358086	I mean, $150 right now is kind of steep, but I've paid more for less.
2358646	2358866	Okay.
2359907	2361267	Alan, something that interests you?
2362247	2362908	No interest at all.
2363448	2363688	None?
2363808	2364048	None.
2364708	2366089	What if they made it $50?
2366129	2366629	Would you buy it?
2368132	2369252	Yeah, I consider it then.
2369392	2379074	I'm kind of in the same boat as Jamie, where it's like, not to be Debbie Downer, but, you know, blah, blah, economy, blah, blah, 9.5% unemployment rate.
2379154	2380495	Like, I can't get that right now.
2381655	2389477	There's a lot of listeners in the same boat as you guys, so I think it's a very realistic answer to say that, you know, because of economic situations, $150 is too damn much.
2389837	2391677	Now is not the time to be asking me to buy this stuff.
2392037	2402142	and a lot of people actually say that's why you didn't see new systems this year and you're seeing instead upgrades to existing systems because imagine if it wasn't just $150 for Kinect but $400 for Xbox 720 with a motion feature built in.
2402162	2402702	For me, day one...
2410266	2411608	I'm a little bit on the fence right now.
2411708	2419396	I kind of want to do it just because I really want Dance Central and the Dance Masters or whatever it is Konami's putting out.
2419736	2421278	I kind of want to get both of those day one.
2421718	2422038	Loki?
2422819	2425442	A couple things.
2426303	2428105	Yes, I will probably pick it up on day one.
2430067	2430287	But
2432196	2433978	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2451078	2455599	There's something interesting when you mentioned Dance Masters or whatever.
2456659	2457420	The Konami game.
2458540	2460380	Guess what I saw a listing for the other day.
2460400	2461821	I was like, really?
2462321	2463801	I'm surprised that's still coming out.
2463901	2464781	Is this a secret?
2465242	2466402	No, I don't know if it's a secret.
2466422	2473344	I think it may even be a mislisting because I haven't looked at the actual Konami release list yet.
2473584	2473744	But...
2474824	2480245	Dance Dance Revolution is back on the list of games coming out, which I thought was interesting.
2480565	2481445	That wouldn't surprise me.
2481485	2483626	Is that the Xbox and PS3 one?
2483806	2484046	Yes.
2484186	2484946	That wouldn't surprise me.
2484966	2486106	They try to get it out by the holiday.
2486447	2494328	But now is really a bad time because, you know, especially on 360, where it's all about, you know, now you can dance without the mat.
2494928	2496729	It just kind of seems like really bad timing.
2496909	2497289	Mm-hmm.
2498169	2526762	they really should have had that out earlier this year before E3 but I forgot to mention this during my gaming week because it's technically not a game I'm playing but holy shit is it awesome one of my release lists I saw and granted it hasn't been announced yet but I don't give a crap because it's so sweet Earth Defense Force 2017 Insect Armageddon yes they are making a sequel to the greatest one of the greatest games on the Xbox 360 in my opinion completely underrated
2527523	2529726	But oh, I cannot wait.
2529986	2531408	Day one purchase for me.
2532089	2532990	I saw that on your Twitter.
2533010	2534032	I was excited for you.
2534950	2541653	Let's go back to the results of our quick poll at chat.orangehonestradio.com Will you buy Kinect and its buy-in game Kinect Adventures this year for $150?
2541753	2543614	Here's the results from our listeners.
2544094	2544334	Nope.
2544854	2545114	No.
2545535	2545835	Yes.
2546315	2546595	No.
2546955	2547235	Yes.
2547715	2549456	Only if a 360 is in that bundle.
2549896	2550176	Yes.
2550617	2552077	Because of fucking Dance Masters.
2552557	2552958	Maybe.
2553338	2554478	I think that would be a good deal.
2554838	2556359	Oh, that's with the 360 included.
2557440	2558640	80% chance on not this year.
2559640	2562722	And then I don't have a job too, so I don't even think about it.
2563762	2564583	Those are the results.
2564744	2566265	See, I told you guys you weren't alone.
2566326	2570831	Here's the thing with the Kinect 2 is I like how simple it is.
2570951	2573474	Basically, I buy the system and I'm done.
2574135	2578921	I don't have to go, oh, okay, now I got to go buy all these extra accessories to get it to work.
2579381	2600682	and I know that they've had there's a bunch of those price comparison charts and like feature charts that one was released by Microsoft one was released by Sony which were hilarious and not to sound Microsoft centric or anything but at least their chart kind of seemed a little bit more fair with the comparison and what you have to buy you know to equal out a two player setup and the cost of that versus you know
2601303	2608028	Sony's saying that, oh, well, our system's in 1080p with Blu-ray as opposed to just 1080p.
2609009	2612952	You're substandard 1080p because it does not have Blu-ray technology.
2613232	2614913	Our system has buttons on it.
2615474	2617876	That is an excellent follow-up question for our chat room.
2617896	2619977	Let me ask this quick poll question real quick.
2620417	2622439	Are you buying PlayStation Move this year?
2622859	2623600	That's what I want to know.
2623840	2624981	How much is PlayStation Move again?
2642769	2649732	Yes, that's also like saying not all the Wii games require the nunchuck, but most of them do, so you're going to probably want it.
2650352	2659376	So you're going to have to buy another nunchuck, you're going to have to buy another move controller if you want two players, and another navigation controller nunchuck, whatever you want to call it.
2659996	2661417	And those are expensive.
2662277	2668460	Like $30 I think for the navigation controller, and I want to say like $70 for the actual controller.
2669820	2670221	Around there.
2670621	2675445	I could be wrong on the prices, but... Quickly, let me run around the room and see who might buy PlayStation Move here.
2675545	2677186	DarkSakura, PlayStation Move this year?
2680349	2680669	Really?
2681130	2681470	Don't know.
2681897	2683038	Okay, same kind of answer.
2683058	2683518	That's fine.
2683718	2683938	Alan?
2685039	2687700	I don't have a Wii yet, and I think that sort of answers the same question.
2687980	2688841	No, not at all.
2689381	2691763	I'm going to say it pretty strongly here.
2691883	2693724	I have no interest in PlayStation Move right now.
2693744	2697566	There's not a single game that's on it that I'm really interested in.
2698306	2702849	You could charge me $50 for the whole thing, the bundle, the controller, everything.
2702869	2703549	I still wouldn't buy it.
2703949	2709973	That's not to say I'm hateful for everything Sony this year, because I really want LittleBigPlanet 2, and there's some other things that don't involve the Move.
2710413	2711214	Thank you for watching!
2727132	2730855	For all practical purposes, those dance games really haven't been done before in this style.
2731436	2732697	Loki, PlayStation Move.
2732917	2733638	Absolutely not.
2733958	2735059	It looks like crap.
2735320	2740565	And I can't believe that they made games... I mean, just the whole lineup looks like junk.
2740945	2744649	I mean, and the fact that the controller is just a total grab at...
2746090	2747312	The Wii stuff.
2747853	2750997	It's basically a Wii with HD graphics.
2752759	2756284	Power to them, I guess, for trying to come up with a system that works for them.
2758573	2759174	Thanks for watching!
2775556	2777097	on the Wii.
2777638	2780800	You can't do it with the controller setup that you have either.
2781200	2788225	You're going to get things that, the closest to that you're going to get is like a Just Dance type game and I really don't, I'm not interested in something like that.
2788685	2792207	Dartetsu in our chatroom says, care to make a wager if they'll sell one million units of Move?
2793348	2793808	I don't think so
2808875	2809135	Nope.
2809536	2809796	No.
2810296	2810577	No.
2811017	2812518	I don't even have a PS3 as of now.
2812758	2813359	Hells no.
2813639	2814140	Hell no.
2814500	2815701	No thanks, I already have a Wii.
2816041	2817542	Only if someone gave me a PS3.
2817843	2818863	I don't have a PS3.
2819144	2821346	I really have no need for a PS3, nor do I want one.
2822627	2822907	No.
2823747	2824268	And BRB.
2825169	2828932	Not a single person in our chatroom, and please speak up if I missed you, said that they're buying it.
2831969	2836212	We at least had about two or three saying they were getting Kinect, but not a single person saying they're getting Move.
2836672	2837913	That could be very interesting.
2838314	2840976	Not that I want to make bets, because I don't want to make bets.
2841276	2842697	We're not going to do this crap.
2843537	2851103	I think Move is going to fail, but they're going to be able to sweep it under the rug very easily, whereas Kinect is way riskier.
2851683	2853765	And I don't know if that's going to do well or not.
2854065	2859129	Yeah, I want one, but I kind of have a bad feeling that Dance Central may be the only game I ever get to play on.
2859169	2864834	Here's the problem, too, with the Kinect, is they haven't really shown off any of the hardcore games yet for it.
2864914	2866455	It's all been the casual stuff.
2867155	2873741	Granted, with the move, they showed, hey, look, we can use it in SOCOM 4, and look, we can use it in Killzone 2 if you want.
2875802	2876283	Or Killzone 3.
2877123	2885447	Um, but they haven't really shown off anything like, hey look, Halo Reach is gonna, you know, support the move, or like, you know, Gears of War 3 or something like that.
2886027	2887288	Or not the move, the Kinect.
2887688	2888769	Um, so...
2890425	2899329	I don't know, it'll be interesting to see what happens, but I don't think it's going to be like, oh my god, everybody's going to run out and get these consoles.
2899489	2913715	It's just the same reason why, even with the Wii and stuff, the Wii sells well because it's cheap, and I guarantee if this stuff starts doing well, like the move in the Kinect, that that console will drop in price again to the sweet spot of $99, or even like $120, and...
2917416	2921298	It won't matter anymore because people will be snatching that shit up like crazy.
2922099	2930263	And seriously, when you think about it, if that's the kind of gameplay you're into, why the fuck should you spend $400 on an HD console so the graphics are slightly better?
2931184	2936346	Remember, folks, it doesn't matter if the graphics are better as long as the game is fun.
2936827	2942270	I mean, if anything, look at some of the stuff that Capcom has done with the 8-bit retro games.
2942630	2946132	Those games are fun because they're fun, not because they look pretty.
2947072	2953597	And that's the whole point, is the games need to be fun, and you need to focus less on how pretty the games are.
2953857	2955238	That will only get you so far.
2955639	2957100	It's the fun that keeps people around.
2958441	2969049	Alright, well, before I get into the next story, I'm sure there's going to be some, even though our chat results came up that nobody was interested in Move, I'm sure there's some folks listening to the podcast, because we do reach a pretty big audience with the podcast, comparatively.
2969649	2974453	There's probably somebody out there that's probably sitting there right now going, man, these guys just hating on Sony, man, man, man.
2974833	2979676	No, I'm open to, and I really actually want to hear from the people that are going to buy PlayStation Move.
2980356	2981737	Why are you buying PlayStation Move?
2981757	2983638	And I'm not asking that in an accusatory way.
2983658	2987119	I just kind of want to know, like, what is it that interests you about PlayStation Move?
2987159	2989200	I told you I'm interested in Dance Central.
2989220	2990321	That's kind of why I want to get connected.
2990641	2995624	What is it on Move that interests you for this holiday season, and what's motivating you to go out to get a move?
2995664	2996764	I'd love to hear from some listeners.
2997144	2998185	Mailbag at OrangeLunchRadio.com.
2998365	3006651	I was going to real quickly talk about just Microsoft's thing when they put out the cost of the different systems and stuff like that.
3006811	3007772	Oh, didn't you call this?
3007932	3008853	That this is going to come out?
3009453	3011454	Microsoft will put out a chart that says it?
3011675	3013316	I remember you saying this in the show.
3013416	3013716	You did.
3013776	3014276	I know you did.
3014316	3018800	But this is assuming that you already own these consoles or whatever.
3018880	3026045	Here's what it will cost you to equal up to what I guess the PlayStation the Kinect can give you.
3027086	3032430	So, of course, the Kinect only supports two people, at least for full body capture or whatever.
3034411	3039215	So, for $150, you get the Kinect system.
3039415	3048702	Now, to equal that on the PlayStation side, you're going to need the $100 starter kit, which gets you the camera and the controller.
3049582	3077178	you're going to need an additional controller which is another $50 and then two navigational controllers which are $30 each total cost $210 now if you compare that with the Wii all you're going to really need is another remote which is $40 they're saying the Wii balance board and this is mainly just so that you can play every single game that's available on the Wii because with the Kinect you're going to need just that camera to play every single game that's going to be available for Kinect
3077718	3082282	and then with the move, you're going to need those navigation controllers to play every single game on there.
3082743	3085625	And then an additional nunchuck, so that'll cost $160.
3085945	3088367	So it's only $10 more than the $150.
3088407	3093532	So that's how they're saying that they're a better bargain, I guess.
3093672	3095954	They're doing some fuzzy math, though.
3095974	3098296	It's some funky... Because they're also saying...
3098756	3100857	if you already have these systems.
3101298	3104259	Yes, not including the price of the system.
3104620	3110183	And then I think it's a little bit shady to throw in the $100 balance board saying you need it.
3110543	3115046	I get where they're going with it, but Microsoft's doing some fuzzy math.
3115726	3119129	That's what the sales people get paid to do.
3119149	3119449	I get it.
3119469	3129537	That's what they do, but even with the PlayStation chart, the Sony chart, what they're talking about, the different features and stuff, some of the comparisons are ridiculous.
3130018	3135342	For example, they have six different bullet points that are the camera.
3135422	3139485	Obviously, the Wii does not have a camera, so all those are no.
3139905	3141246	But they're saying, camera?
3141427	3141727	Yes.
3141947	3142968	Augmentative reality?
3142988	3143028	No.
3143308	3153740	Yes, and it's basically, if you actually look and read all the stuff, it's all basically the same as the Kinect, except for, you know, oh, there's no buttons.
3154261	3157765	Darn, you know, well, what if you don't need buttons on there?
3157805	3160648	I know that they're stressing that buttons are really important.
3160968	3170476	Just like that they were stressing that force feedback wasn't important back when, you know, they didn't have the licensing for force feedback in the PlayStation 3 controllers.
3170516	3178282	You know what they should do is they should put out a chart that's a little more honest with the price, but they should just say, here's what the Xbox will do that the Wii won't do.
3178663	3180624	You know, the Xbox is in HD.
3180724	3182806	The Xbox has access to indie games.
3182826	3185268	The Xbox has this library of download content.
3185308	3187130	Microsoft does what Nintendo don't.
3187990	3189051	Basically, you know,
3190132	3190832	Just be honest.
3190972	3193513	Yeah, it's a little more money, but this is what you're getting for all of it.
3194133	3195154	It plays DVDs.
3195934	3198455	You can do live interactive things like 1 vs. 100.
3199255	3199795	Oh, wait.
3199895	3200475	No, you can't.
3200635	3201095	Not anymore.
3201855	3202996	But you can do Netflix Party.
3203076	3203476	Woo!
3203976	3209058	I'm just wondering, though, the problem I think that they're going to have with these tune-to-motion systems is that...
3210638	3212519	It may be too late, you know what I mean?
3212659	3218301	It's like, the Wii is so inexpensive now, and it's only going to get cheaper.
3218321	3225783	You know, putting out these additional systems, that's basically like saying, oh, you know, you need to buy another system.
3225863	3229805	And fuck, for $150, why don't you just go buy a Wii?
3230245	3233966	I mean, because you can pretty much do that with that kind of cost.
3235345	3240749	So why even bother buying the Kinect when they're just basically saying, for $150, I can just buy a Wii.
3242090	3246953	Let me leave this story on this comment from our chatroom, chat.orangeonsradio.com, because I think it's interesting.
3247033	3252556	Frisbee says, in response to something Jamie said a minute ago, Microsoft does what Nintendo should.
3254017	3254618	Perhaps.
3255143	3261967	Alright, let's move on to our next story, and this has to do with stuff going on in the real world that will definitely impact gaming.
3262087	3270131	I'm sure you guys have heard about this bill that's going to go before the Supreme Court, and it's a California bill that is basically banning the sale of violent video games to kid.
3270511	3270791	To kid?
3272292	3273473	Just this one kid, actually.
3273833	3275034	No, the kids.
3276214	3283658	And it's going to be going before the Supreme Court because it was overturned by a lower court some time ago after it was signed into law.
3284138	3290641	Well, long story short, 11 states have now joined in basically saying they support this bill.
3291021	3293723	So this is no longer just a California issue.
3294343	3300166	But Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Texas, and Virginia...
3300626	3301987	are now all on this too.
3302468	3317462	Not to say that if the Supreme Court reverses the other decision putting the law into effect, not to say that all these states will suddenly also have the law, but that should tell you where California goes at least these 11 states are lined up to follow.
3318243	3325865	So if you want to have your voice heard, you might want to call your congressperson and don't be afraid to do so because that's what they're there for.
3326125	3327005	That's what they're paid to do.
3327025	3328305	There's also the ECA.
3328625	3329846	You can go through the ECA.
3330506	3335607	Although, you know, the ECA is a union you can kind of join to support and help fight it.
3335667	3339328	But there is nothing quite like contacting your representative directly.
3339688	3340568	Do you want to say something on this?
3341263	3341403	No.
3341964	3342204	All right.
3343786	3348251	So yeah, I definitely would encourage folks to contact people.
3348351	3350294	Otherwise, this is... You know, and...
3351989	3363555	Again, just to kind of state where the issue is with this, is that whereas, yes, kids should not be playing violent video games, isn't that really up to the parents to be doing and not really the video game stores?
3363635	3368177	And why are video games being held to a different standard than movies?
3368717	3372319	Is it against the law to sell an R-rated movie to a kid?
3372939	3373820	You don't do it.
3373840	3374620	You're not supposed to do it.
3374660	3375801	But is it against the law?
3376501	3379803	Because it's going to be against the law to do video games pretty soon.
3381164	3381784	If this happens.
3403038	3403818	is necessary.
3403858	3414622	And again, it should be, you know, if parents were doing their due diligence on what their kids were playing and buying or what they bought for their kids, it's just, it seems really unnecessary.
3415802	3418043	J. Rod in our chat says, I don't get why this is an issue.
3418103	3422064	Children need a parent to get into an R-rated movie or buy a parental advisory music album.
3422324	3423545	But is that against the law?
3426425	3428006	It's just that same double standard again.
3429617	3431819	I somewhat agree with you, J-Rod.
3431859	3436021	It's just that, you know, I think video games are being held to a different standard, and that's not very fair.
3436382	3441725	Because it's just going into that whole stereotype that video games somehow make you a more violent person.
3442146	3444527	I just kind of don't like what they're trying to say.
3445628	3446649	I don't like what you're trying to say to me!
3447129	3447389	Alright.
3448290	3449931	Let's move on with another story, DarkSakura.
3450748	3452009	Well, this is happier news.
3452209	3454451	This actually makes me in particular very happy.
3454992	3460076	We have a couple of games coming out from both Capcom and Namco Bandai.
3461737	3465160	Street Fighter x Tekken and Tekken x Street Fighter.
3465701	3466602	What's the difference, huh?
3467262	3475549	Well, Capcom's in charge of the former, and that one's going to be all done in that sort of Street Fighter 4 style, that 2.5D look.
3477972	3483618	and all the Tekken characters will be re-imaged to fit that same style.
3484039	3490086	And I saw a screen capture from it with Kazuya and Ryu and it looked really, really good.
3490146	3492930	The gameplay looks exactly like Street Fighter 4.
3493130	3494511	That will make me intensely happy.
3494592	3497355	They have the video of it and of course it's tag team so it's going to be sweet.
3499069	3525243	and that one will have versus training and tag team and it's going to be a full on Capcom style now the latter is going to be more of the Tekken style play that has a 3D arena so I don't know if they're going to be taking the sort of Street Fighter EX move list and importing it into Tekken or what but
3527003	3534787	Or if it's going to be trying to actually translate the styles of each character into a move list that would fit the way Tekken plays.
3534807	3543812	Because there's not really any real major projectile moves like that in Tekken, except for a couple of interesting moves.
3544432	3548734	And there's the unblockable moves too, like Jin's whole electric block thing.
3548974	3553217	I think in the later Tekkens, the final boss would have a fireball to make them even more...
3553857	3581014	Cheesier That's right But normally, yeah, the regular characters don't From what I remember Now, Tekken was always my big thing Especially when Tekken 3 came out I was working in a Namco arcade at the time So, of course, we had it before everybody else did And I was like, ooh, I know who that character's coming out You know, because I was keeping up with the Japanese character releases at the time We got ours in a different order than they did in Japan
3583544	3587306	Tekken 3 was a huge deal here because it was a launch title with the PS2.
3587846	3595630	So if you were in line at midnight, September whatever, 2000 for the PS2, you were picking up Tekken 3, SSX, big.
3595710	3597551	It was Tekken Tag Tournament, actually.
3597772	3599472	Yeah, Tekken 3 was on the PS1, I'm pretty sure.
3599492	3600293	Tekken 3 was with the PS1.
3600353	3602714	They had like a souped up version on the PS2.
3602734	3603875	I think that's what they had, yeah.
3604415	3632146	but Tekken Tag Tournament was the big thing and actually they fixed a lot of the problems that the Japanese Tekken Tag Tournament had because it had this weird thing where the background would almost detach from the foreground and it would really give me a headache after a while playing it but I've got, I imported Tekken 3 when it came out in Japan and actually they censored the endings between that one and the US one it's pretty funny
3632566	3636288	I kind of wish if Capcom and Namco were going to get into bed together again.
3636568	3638269	I'll get to that in a moment.
3638589	3645753	I kind of wish it was Street Fighter across Soul Calibur, personally, because I love me some Soul Calibur, but I get it.
3645993	3647874	The universe of Tekken and Street Fighter are similar.
3648214	3652957	Soul Calibur would not really fit as well in that universe, although Darth Vader and Yoda seem to do okay.
3654278	3657000	Soul Calibur is taking its own kind of interesting direction.
3657740	3661181	It's shifting in more to the customized character.
3661702	3664423	I would love to see, where's my announcement on Soul Calibur 5?
3664523	3667104	Because we should be about ready for that, don't you think?
3667424	3669385	Soul Calibur 4 was a couple years ago, I'm just saying.
3669645	3675488	Now, what I really want to see is, Capcom, I hope you're listening, I want to know the rival schools.
3676622	3702698	Um, also, let's get into this, because it has kind of a funky name, and we've heard people say Street Fighter X Tekken, because that's what it literally reads like, and then we've heard, like, Tekken versus Street Fighter, just kind of people replacing it with versus, but the name actually comes from a couple years ago, and I know we've talked about it on this show, it was a Japanese game that never came out here, there was already a Namco Cross Capcom, and it was more of like, it wasn't more of like a strategy game or something, it just involved the characters from the various universes, I think it was?
3702918	3703779	It was a tactical strategy.
3703799	3705200	It was like a tactical game that came out.
3705220	3707302	Which is why I never bothered with it, but it had some sweet music.
3707623	3712327	So it should be known that this is not the first time that Namco and Capcom have kind of gotten in bed together.
3712527	3718273	This is kind of a logical type of follow-up, so it's a little weird in a way.
3718453	3726381	I've got to admit, I'm kind of sad that it's not a Capcom SNK Part 3, because that's what I would really like to see, because...
3727001	3733506	I prefer Mai and Andy Bogard and all them from the SNK universe, but whatever.
3734106	3748135	You know, I want them to do, I would like to have, I mean, as much as Street Fighter and Tekken seems to be such a logical choice for them to do a crossover game with, because those are the two biggest franchises of each company.
3749276	3756037	I would have preferred to have a more generic all-out like how Capcom vs. SNK was.
3757037	3763739	They had the Cardfighters Clash game, which was pretty fun, and then you had the fighting game.
3765499	3770400	I like that the company's major artists did each other's art for them.
3770760	3773760	The Capcom artists did the SNK artists and vice versa.
3774420	3776901	I'd like to have Klonoa in a fighting game.
3778242	3779684	That was the joke I was about to make, yeah.
3779704	3780846	Klonoa versus Akuma.
3781653	3789158	Well, even in the trailer, at the very end, they show, like, Mega Man chasing a Pac-Man ghost, and then a Pac-Man chomping after Mega Man.
3789198	3790239	Like, it's really weird.
3790599	3793842	And then I'm like, are they gonna do something with Mega Man Universe?
3793922	3796163	Like, what the hell are these two companies planning?
3796724	3798465	Like, is this weird?
3798485	3801027	Like, somebody is sleeping with somebody at the other company.
3802568	3805110	Seriously, because, like, now, what's gonna happen next?
3805150	3807011	Katamari Damacy meets Resident Evil?
3807131	3807371	I mean...
3810014	3811555	You've made the zombie moon!
3811575	3814819	Actually, that's how you'd make Pluto, because Pluto's the dead planet.
3815199	3817181	We should do that as a list list some week.
3817201	3820625	The Namco cross-Capcom series we'd like to see happen next.
3822407	3826191	That would just be all kinds of wrong.
3827774	3834437	But this is interesting, because Capcom's got a lot of fighting games coming out, because they've got this, they've got Marvel vs. Capcom still happening.
3834977	3839079	It's all these, like, X vs. Y. Marvel vs. Capcom 3!
3839979	3840939	Ow, that hurt.
3840959	3840939	3!
3841480	3842440	It was just in my right hand.
3843681	3849503	Which I'm still majorly looking forward to, because, dude, my team of Deadpool and Dante, aww.
3849523	3853505	S2100 Matt in our chatroom at chat.orange.com is saying Napcom, or Napcom?
3853745	3854225	Napcom.
3856138	3857499	That's what happens when you read too fast.
3857539	3858799	I like that name, Napcom.
3859680	3862521	Namco Cross Capcom was a massive financial failure.
3863401	3866142	I didn't realize that, but that might explain why it never came out to the US.
3866783	3871985	I'm looking at the Wikipedia article that we got linked here and trying to see what's going on.
3872005	3873206	Yeah, it was a tactical game.
3874526	3876508	I'm trying to see how it was received.
3876668	3878630	Oh, there's a lot of characters in the different games there.
3879130	3879871	Reception.
3880131	3882614	It got a 28 out of 40 in Famitsu.
3883094	3885516	It was the top-selling game the week of release.
3886077	3893424	It sold approximately 131,000 copies in its first six months of release, and then it got re-released as a PlayStation 2 the best.
3893724	3894905	That doesn't sound terrible.
3895806	3899890	Maybe it wasn't like, oh my gosh, blow your hair back, but it sounds like it did okay.
3900606	3906027	That rating coming from Famitsu, you know how strict they are on their ratings.
3907108	3909308	Haven't they given only five games a ten?
3909328	3912329	It's more like twelve, and Nintendogs was one of them.
3912949	3913969	Nintendogs was great.
3914869	3917750	For about five minutes, which is how long they must have played it for.
3919290	3922211	Usually, yeah, they've got some pretty strict standards.
3922811	3925112	But they've had their moments of weakness, that's for sure.
3926254	3928975	Well, I don't know about you guys, but I'm looking forward to this.
3929435	3930195	I played Tekken 1, 2, 3.
3931776	3935497	I had all those games from PlayStation 1, and then I kind of stopped playing Tekken.
3936117	3937278	I didn't really ever play 4 or 5.
3937878	3938758	Maybe I rented 4.
3938918	3939338	I don't remember.
3939739	3944580	I remember I got Tekken 6 from Gamefly, and you came over, and we played it for a couple hours.
3944840	3945240	That's right.
3945260	3950262	And it had 40 characters, which is a ton amount of characters, and we were like, we don't care.
3950882	3951863	It was kind of bad.
3952003	3953003	It wasn't that great.
3953023	3954303	We just couldn't get into it.
3956404	3963312	I really am curious to see kind of what the Tekken... I mean, because we all know what Street Fighter X Tekken is going to look like.
3963352	3965534	It's going to be freaking Street Fighter 4 with Tekken characters.
3965674	3966054	Whoopee!
3966695	3969978	I'm more curious to see what Tekken X Street Fighter ends up looking like.
3971300	3974763	Because, you know, is it going to kind of not be so great like Tekken 6?
3974964	3976485	Or are they going to maybe get...
3977666	3979067	The Soul Calibur people to work on it?
3979147	3979467	I don't know.
3979788	3981048	It'll be interesting to see what happens.
3981229	3982489	Did you see the pictures, Rob?
3983010	3986572	I saw the pictures of Street Fighter X Tekken, but I didn't see the other way around.
3987072	3988293	I don't know if there's pictures out for that yet.
3988313	3991395	I don't think there is, because this all happened at Comic-Con at the Capcom panel.
3991655	3996719	Which, by the way, isn't it weird that they waited for Comic-Con and didn't say something at E3?
3996899	4001002	I mean, maybe they weren't ready to make an announcement at E3, but it wasn't that long ago.
4001502	4004724	Comic-Con seems like a weird place to make that type of announcement.
4006084	4007947	Because, you know, Comic-Con, all about the comic books.
4009269	4012795	I thought that this particular shot was just epic.
4013056	4016281	And she's looking at a shot of Ryu fighting Jin, right?
4016422	4016882	Kazuya.
4019156	4022679	Drew looks like, I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU!
4022859	4026942	I can tell you right now what the Tekken X Street Fighter is going to look like.
4027662	4029223	The Street Fighter EX series.
4029243	4030004	God, I hope not.
4030384	4031385	Oh, God, I'm sorry.
4031425	4032306	Those games were terrible.
4032386	4033286	I did not like them at all.
4033547	4034607	EX3 was alright.
4035368	4037269	Because, dude, it's all about Skullamania.
4039271	4041372	But those weren't even produced by Capcom proper.
4041412	4043494	It was done through an American company.
4044119	4047706	I really like those games, so I'm surprised hearing this from you right now.
4047946	4049750	The EX series.
4049790	4050791	I think it's really underrated.
4050932	4051473	I liked them all.
4052443	4054105	Okay, well, you have fun.
4056888	4057348	All yours.
4058129	4070523	Well, if Namco's doing that one in particular, then I'm more than certain that they're going to be sticking with Namco's style for how they do it.
4070563	4074387	And they've always had really tight gameplay for the Tekken's.
4074747	4077168	Well, what was the SNK game called?
4077188	4080889	Remember there was Capcom vs. SNK, but SNK put out, what, SVC Chaos or something?
4081269	4082349	And that game wasn't so great.
4083189	4086390	I mean, I love me some SNK, but Capcom, I think, made the better game.
4086610	4087470	It was alright.
4089271	4089831	Alright, anyhow.
4090471	4092411	Let's move on with some more gaming news.
4092531	4095852	We're going to release dates in a little bit after this next round of news starting off with Loki.
4097253	4102134	Sony has patented multiplayer via stereoscopic systems.
4102774	4130678	basically the way this is going to work they actually had something similar and I'm surprised that they were able to patent this anyways they have a way now using the kind of shutter system or whatever that you'll only be able to see your I guess your player or whatever on the screen at one time while someone else can actually see the full screen as well so it'll do split screen by basically having two different images on the screen at the same time
4131718	4157326	and each player will only be able to see their own version of the screen using those shutter glasses they actually have this already in TVs right now because I know you can actually do that with those 120 MHz TVs and watch two different programs at the same time or two different inputs but I guess this would actually kind of combine it with only one input but it would still be two different versions of the game or whatever that you're playing I don't know why but that technology sounds painful to me
4158067	4165053	It's really, it's a neat idea, but it's really, it's not something that they're going to be like, oh my god, you can do this.
4167075	4182187	It'll be kind of cool, but at the same time, it's kind of a dumb use of, if I've got these 3D glasses that I'm paying for and this 3D TV that I'm paying for, I'm going to want to use the 3D portion of that and not necessarily the split screen portion of that.
4182287	4186210	But what if you want to watch one show and your sister wants to watch another show?
4186310	4188652	I mean, now you both can watch the same show.
4188712	4190953	But wouldn't it just be cheaper to get a second TV?
4191113	4192274	No, it's not that at all.
4192494	4195737	This would be just two players.
4195937	4200840	It's a multiplayer game, but you're just watching two different players using the same screen.
4200860	4201601	But couldn't you do that?
4201881	4202502	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4218058	4232164	or you can be, stop being a little pussy and just, you know, look at half the fucking screen instead of spending like hundreds of dollars on a fucking camera or like a stupid shutter glass system just to do this.
4232444	4234485	Just buy another damn TV like you said.
4234585	4239146	But the game system doesn't have the processing power to handle the split screen.
4239207	4242008	Those PlayStation 3s with their, what are they called?
4242088	4244289	I don't know, the Uber Cores or whatever those are.
4244349	4245269	The Emotion Engine.
4245569	4246170	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4265450	4269673	What they really should have done, Rob, is they should have gone back to the original design of the PS3.
4269713	4271274	Remember the original design of the PS3?
4271294	4272455	How ridiculous that was?
4272755	4276818	With, like, it's three HDMI outs and it's dual LAN outs and stuff.
4276838	4278780	It's like, what the fuck do you need that stuff for?
4279180	4282802	But, I mean, if that's really what they want to do with this, then why not just do that?
4282902	4284223	So we can have two fucking TVs.
4284564	4289027	Or, I don't know, how about you just stop being a little whiny bitch about it and just not worry about it?
4289047	4291949	Because, seriously, how many fucking split-screen games are out there?
4292169	4294110	Not that much anymore, which is really sad.
4294230	4294951	It is sad, dude.
4294991	4296252	It should be more.
4297553	4301875	Resistance was a fun split-screen game, but there's not a lot of stuff out there.
4301895	4306458	Call of Duty, that'll still do split-screen, but it's not a lot out there.
4307359	4312142	Why even bother working on this technology for a handful of games?
4313463	4316965	I think Blur is split-screen, the racing game, except everyone hates that game for some reason.
4316985	4317525	I don't know why.
4317545	4318166	It's not that bad.
4318766	4324695	But you know who does have the technology to handle split-screen flawlessly and who could bring split-screen to all our homes is Skynet.
4325676	4326117	Just saying.
4327179	4328060	I can get behind that.
4329562	4329822	Alright.
4330043	4333227	But, I mean, if you really... This is such an issue.
4333428	4334069	I mean, I just...
4336043	4336764	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4352179	4356662	Yeah, it'd be kind of neat to go, hey, look, we can play a two-player game or whatever.
4357063	4363127	But what's gonna stop someone from, say, I don't know, adjusting the shutters on their glasses to sneak a peek at what you're doing?
4363147	4365729	It's exactly the same shit all over again.
4367070	4368671	I get motion sick with split screens.
4369878	4370098	Really?
4370518	4371599	You can't just focus on one?
4372539	4373600	No, mine don't work that way.
4374000	4377002	But you also can't play first person shooters, so it wouldn't really matter anyways.
4378403	4384406	But like when we were doing racing games on split screens, it would actually give me a headache after a while.
4385307	4388168	Even Mario Kart on the old Super Nintendo?
4388448	4388688	Yeah.
4388909	4389129	Really?
4389169	4389649	That's too bad.
4389789	4391530	Because that was like the king of split screen right there.
4391914	4402520	Yeah, it was because the aspect rate, well, especially for the older ones, the aspect ratio is changed so badly that it really starts putting a strain on my eyes.
4403740	4404161	It's too bad.
4405181	4413266	All right, well, moving on to something that I don't know if they'll be able to put split screen into this, but it's a new technology-ish thing coming to PlayStation Home.
4413626	4415647	It's a partnership with Codename.
4416688	4423554	Code name, I guess, is this indie game label that is going to be making content for PlayStation Home.
4425316	4426737	One of the games is going to be...
4428140	4431361	Are they going to be putting out content like Sodium One?
4454251	4459174	And when the game says draw, you push the button on the gun as fast as you can.
4460235	4463577	And on harder rounds, you have to pull the trigger faster.
4464497	4466118	So maybe that's what Dueling Gentleman will be.
4466278	4468420	It'll be press X button to win.
4470358	4472059	Wild Gunman Strategy in Holmes Plaza
4488652	4489612	I have no idea what that is.
4489652	4492653	But I guess also Peanut Gallery is another developer.
4492673	4494254	They're going to be making Minor Battle.
4494294	4495814	It's a capture the flag type of game.
4496314	4500055	And then Codename is making Super Awesome Mountain RPG.
4500595	4504156	It's going to have tabletop board games with fantasy role playing.
4504677	4505497	That could be interesting.
4506577	4508298	Bringing like a little bit of tabletop into home.
4508438	4512059	Just because they have super and awesome in the title does not mean it's going to be super awesome.
4514000	4518824	In fact, actually having super and awesome in the title usually means it's not super awesome.
4519044	4527871	A game by Lazy8 called Cogs will be in 3D, and it will be a dynamic public spectacle in Home Central Plaza.
4528712	4536559	Really, I thought the furry dance-off day in Sony Home was the dynamic public spectacle, but maybe that's just me, I don't know.
4538200	4539981	I got your dynamic public spectacle.
4540762	4546966	And any of this going to be able to be translated into, I don't know, stuff for my apartment or a club?
4547066	4548927	Is this going to expand the clubs in any way?
4549628	4550889	Maybe, I don't know.
4551009	4552510	They haven't said yet.
4552650	4554071	They haven't said because it's not going to happen.
4555475	4558097	Didn't Sodium One have a shirt?
4558117	4559177	Oh my god!
4559197	4562800	I totally misinterpreted Sodium One then.
4562900	4565842	It's the super awesomest thing ever.
4566302	4567303	Because I got a shirt.
4567863	4570885	You can win a shirt, but Loki, it's not actually a real shirt.
4571665	4578069	It's not like back in the Atari 2600 days where they would actually send you patches for your jacket if you got a high enough score in barnstorming or whatever.
4578129	4579230	And they should do that!
4580671	4581972	That's what achievements are.
4583037	4585478	I can't wear my achievements.
4602785	4631410	you would unlock a Left 4 Dead 2 t-shirt for your avatar which you could then wear and go on 1 vs 100 and show off your Left 4 Dead 2 t-shirt they've done that in a few games but not a lot have used it yet and I wonder if it's something we'll start seeing more in the next couple years like Blur, you can get a shirt for your avatar in Blur too I think there's a couple shirts you can get but one of them is really easy to get because I got it I have a sombrero for Red Dead Redemption which I noticed the other day I'm like, oh, okay wonderful
4633624	4635365	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4657492	4686036	at any rate, it's going to be exclusive to Game and Game Station it will be $249.99 that's pounds will be out on September 14th it will have the limited edition wireless controller the wireless headset those will be available in the UK on the 3rd of September and we're actually getting it later than they are over there
4686816	4688257	The controller is going to be $39.99.
4688978	4691900	The headset will be $34.99.
4694883	4698065	And they are going to be limited and available for pre-order.
4699967	4707292	Now, as far as in the U.S., I believe that we're getting the bundle for $399 on September 14th.
4710006	4711808	So a new controller will be available, huh?
4712628	4714530	Have they fixed the fucking D-pad yet?
4715591	4716191	No.
4716411	4720194	For the record, our wireless controller is going to be $60.
4722316	4725679	And come with a Covenant Banshee Avatar token for Xbox Live.
4726760	4729842	And the headset will be $50 over here.
4730042	4732304	And they will be in late August.
4733385	4734526	$60 for a controller.
4734946	4736788	I realize that's how much they cost now, but it's just...
4737488	4739009	God, controllers are expensive.
4739069	4739949	It's a little ridiculous.
4739969	4740249	I know, I know.
4740309	4742810	Especially for a controller that's essentially defective.
4744011	4744311	Right?
4746252	4749953	All right, let's travel around the world and see what you can waste your money on this week in the world of gaming.
4750033	4750914	Loki, we'll start with you.
4751214	4754015	There's a couple things this week that are worth mentioning.
4754275	4757156	Obviously, StarCraft II on PC is going to be a big thing.
4757437	4757937	Oh, you think?
4758237	4760238	StarCraft II, the Wings of Liberty.
4760378	4762899	Remember, there will be three versions of this game.
4764269	4764609	Why?
4765030	4766691	I don't see the point.
4766711	4768953	Because they'll sell it three times to a lot of people.
4768973	4774358	Well, they'll try to sell it three times, but I don't think the second and third versions of the game will be that great.
4776020	4778302	Okay, but that will be coming out this week on PC.
4779603	4784327	A game called Galaxy Racers coming to the DS thanks to Ubisoft.
4784468	4787490	It is, just like it sounds, a game where you race through space.
4788431	4804449	Clash of the Titans Coming out on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 Where you will release the Kraken Or at least fight the Kraken that is released upon you At least that's what I gather that movie is about Because that's all I ever see in the trailers Kraken being released
4805950	4807191	Alright.
4807251	4811113	Chuck E. Cheese Party Games coming to the Wii.
4812094	4812974	Here's a hint, people.
4813215	4816857	It's not really a brand new game, per se.
4818478	4829484	The company UFO Interactive, they have taken these games called Smart Girls and Smart Boys Club and they've just re-skinned them with Chuck E. Cheese stuff.
4829504	4833086	You know, that's really unfair to the dumb boys and the dumb girls of the world.
4835268	4836409	I know, it's sad.
4837149	4838410	But that will be coming to the Wii.
4839071	4841192	Arkrise Fantasia also coming to the Wii.
4841212	4844314	It's supposed to be a pretty awesome RPG.
4845635	4851239	If you're into fighting games, BlazBlue Continuum Shift will be coming out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
4851839	4854681	I do believe a PC version is going to be available soon as well.
4856102	4860525	Although, if you know where to look, it's already been out there for months now.
4861486	4863147	This arcade game used to run on PC hardware.
4866708	4868889	And that's basically it.
4869109	4872709	And then, oh my god, next week there's a whole bunch of junk.
4873649	4876750	So I got a question, y'all, and I want to ask this of chat as well.
4876770	4877990	Should I buy StarCraft 2?
4879070	4881191	There's a part of me that kind of wants it.
4881231	4886752	Despite all my anger at Blizzard the past month in this show, they do make some really good games.
4886832	4892633	And yeah, I'm terrible at RTSs, but I know some of my friends are buying this game, and they're not very good either.
4892713	4894453	So I'll have people to play with.
4894753	4896554	You know what would look cool about StarCraft 2?
4897014	4898015	It's the level editor.
4898655	4900696	And all the fun stuff you could do with that.
4900756	4903998	Like the Mario Kart type game and stuff like that.
4904178	4905219	I think that would be neat.
4905859	4910661	Well, for one, I want to make sure... I kind of want to wait for the reviews of this game to come out.
4911602	4914103	Because I want to see what they look like.
4914183	4917365	I want to know if my real name is going to show in the battles.
4917805	4920347	I want to see how far they took real ID in StarCraft 2.
4921507	4937478	that'd be funny because like see like if I were to sign up on this I don't have an account or anything and no real name so I could just like create a character called Dicks McButt or something like that it's like you have to sign up for a Battle.net account to play StarCraft 2
4938018	4960420	so you know and they would want you know your real name but you could always put you know Matt Loki is your name and I guess they'd really be none the wiser they wouldn't be so I don't know so I'm waiting to see what the game like as much as going to the midnight release might be kind of fun I'm gonna really resist that temptation and just like give it a week and just kind of see what the reception is and then I guess make my decision from there
4961221	4974426	I personally would wait three months, two or three months, because, you know, during that first quarter after it comes out, all of the balance issues are going to come out, and they're just going to patch the hell out of it and nerf all the things that need to be nerfed.
4974946	4979128	So wait three months and get a more even version of the game.
4979228	4980428	Three months?
4980448	4981129	Yeah, I know.
4981289	4982189	Three months?
4982229	4983129	That's too long.
4983650	4984430	In three months...
4984890	4987915	Dance Central will be here and Cataclysm will be here.
4988256	4989578	DC Universe will be on the way.
4989598	4991361	I ain't going to have time in three months for no Starcraft.
4991381	4993504	Cataclysm won't be here in three months, okay?
4993604	4995968	It's going to take at least four months.
4996469	4997270	Thanksgiving Christmas.
4997330	4998633	When is Cataclysm coming out?
5000120	5001661	Technically fall right now.
5002121	5002881	Sometime November.
5004082	5006443	But fall is the official date so far.
5007483	5007863	So far.
5010384	5014826	Let's move on to Japan and look at some of the release dates in Japan.
5015767	5018468	TigerClaw is linking me to a story that I want to get to later in our chatroom.
5018508	5019989	I have that on the list for later.
5020049	5021709	We'll talk more about StarCraft 2 later in the show.
5024090	5026631	Shirzo in our chatroom says Dix McButt should be on the wiki.
5026791	5027632	The Orange Launch Radio wiki.
5028893	5031955	Maybe that can be your quintessential online name.
5032396	5035738	No, I was just trying to think of something ridiculous.
5037180	5040522	And I'm able to think of things that are very ridiculous all the time.
5042004	5044165	Alright, let's move on to the Japanese release date.
5044766	5047008	Xbox 360, quite a bit now.
5047068	5049710	We've had some quiet weeks, but now some more stuff is starting to come out.
5049830	5053613	Agares Senkei Zero Dawn of War is coming out in Japan on July 29th.
5054794	5056275	Dating Sim Strike Witches, Shirogane no Tsubasa
5077788	5084431	Yeah, it looks like they are little cat girl anime chicks that turn into... Or no, they just happen to fly.
5084851	5086572	I guess they have little jetpacks and they fly.
5087092	5089513	So little cat girls that fly carrying guns.
5089653	5094395	I mean, this is like every anime fanboy's wet dream, so have fun with that.
5094435	5099116	Supreme Commander 2 also comes out from Squeenix this week, July 29th on the Xbox 360.
5099156	5102538	It's nice to finally see some busy weeks in Japan because it's been kind of slow the past few weeks.
5103459	5112772	PlayStation 3 There's a new console coming out It's the PlayStation 3 Slim 160GB and 320GB models are coming out this week We will also be getting those here
5113317	5116398	Sengoku Basara 3 is also coming out over there.
5117118	5126620	They also get a game called, oh, I'm sorry, this is for the Asia region and not specific to Japan, Chujaigen Game Neptune in regular and limited edition.
5127740	5130680	This is, they say it's for people that love Trinity Universe.
5130740	5131580	It's an RPG.
5131801	5133601	It's the one where the consoles fight each other.
5133621	5135001	Remember the console battle game?
5135041	5135721	Oh, yes, yes, I do.
5135781	5136821	Wow, you're smart.
5137002	5138402	I don't remember all these games.
5138422	5139222	You're a good time.
5139622	5150451	Alright, uh... On the Wii, Sengoku Basara 3 comes out there as well, as well as a game called Meisaze Surimaster Sekai ni Challenge Hen.
5150811	5155395	That's actually a price reduction that's going into the best hits from Hudson there.
5155515	5156996	I think that's what, Dekasports?
5157256	5158137	That's kind of what it looks like.
5158658	5160079	Uh, Dekasports 3 probably.
5160339	5161080	Oh no, it's fishing.
5161360	5162261	It's their fishing sim.
5162841	5165823	Uh... The hell is that called over here?
5166324	5166444	Um...
5168761	5170001	Oh, come on, it's a fishing game.
5170021	5170642	Who cares?
5170742	5171422	It's a fishing game.
5171742	5174123	Fishing games have not been cool since the Dreamcast.
5174323	5175443	Well, they keep putting them out, though.
5175883	5176823	On the PlayStation 2.
5177984	5179524	Yes, there's still games coming out on PlayStation 2.
5180344	5180824	Guess what?
5181285	5182105	Nobunaga!
5182345	5183785	That's right, another Nobunaga game.
5183865	5187306	Nobunaga no Yabu Kakushin with a power-up kit.
5187366	5189607	It's actually a price reduction from Koei.
5189847	5193728	I don't know what the power-up kit is, but that's maybe some in-game stuff.
5193768	5194068	I don't know.
5194488	5196549	Also, Natsuzora no Monologue.
5198614	5201545	I don't know what that game is all about, but that's from Idea Factory.
5203880	5205721	Hatsune Miku Project Diva 2 Hatsune Miku
5230019	5232521	Second Mix is coming out this week from Sega.
5232961	5233401	Enjoy that.
5233802	5237944	Also, lastly, there's a game called, yes, Slapstick Wonderland.
5239025	5244829	The full name of the game, Gaijusuka Art Design Class, Slapstick Wonderland.
5246434	5248575	You are free to imagine whatever you want.
5249435	5252176	But it's schoolgirls looking at sketchbooks.
5252736	5259139	I love this one because there's these four anime girls looking at a sketchbook and they look all excited like there's pictures of peen in the sketchbook.
5259479	5261660	And there's this one little girl over here who just don't care.
5261740	5263080	She's sipping on her sippy cup.
5263700	5265241	She's like, I don't give a shit what these girls are looking at.
5265261	5266221	I don't care about the peen in here.
5267522	5267822	Alright.
5269762	5270523	Let's move on to the UK.
5270543	5270803	Okay.
5272364	5274487	In the UK, we have some releases.
5274747	5276489	I've only got a few on my list, though.
5277610	5279512	The 27th is Alan Wake, The Signal.
5280614	5283277	Starcraft 2, Wings of Liberty, also on the 27th.
5283777	5286841	And the 30th is Ship Simulator Extremes for PC.
5288242	5289003	Yeah, that's about it.
5290086	5295548	Two more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week, as DarkSakura has picked.
5296149	5300170	We're getting closer and closer to our 150th game in the classic game of the week.
5300310	5302271	Episode 400 will be the 150th game.
5302311	5305512	We started on 250, because I looked at the wiki today, randomly.
5306033	5306753	And you started this...
5307413	5309174	You've had some segments.
5309454	5313417	Back in the early days of the show, you didn't really have a segment like that.
5314137	5316698	But your regular segments didn't start until we did the podcast.
5316718	5321161	There was the website of the week and my advice column.
5321301	5322882	Like what to do if you get caught on fire.
5322982	5329846	Because I was using my Worst Case Scenario Survivor Handbook calendar, which was great.
5330206	5335329	Like how to deliver a baby and how to navigate a landmine and how to ride a camel.
5336601	5362727	but I'm liking your classic game of the week they've been very good I've actually been able to incorporate this into something for Geek Life too I do Tales from the Vault every Sunday I like how you've worked in yet another plug this week for Geek Life go you, geek-life.com yeah, but that one's the more specific about, you know memories around gaming the dash is important because you need to dash on over there I know, right?
5363967	5365869	Loki.
5365969	5371273	So there's this game called Rock Band 3 that's supposed to be coming out this year sometime in the fall.
5371614	5376778	Now we can kind of narrow it down to October 26th.
5377318	5385004	I'll be hitting the shelves in North America just in time for your Halloween parties where you need to rock out to stuff.
5387266	5405676	and then of course with that obviously there's going to be different pre-order bonuses for wherever you decide to pre-order the game if you pre-order the title at Walmart you get a $10 e-gift card if you pre-order through Amazon they will unlock an exclusive in-game guitar for you
5407225	5408346	Yay, that's worth it.
5409607	5420939	Pre-orders with GameStop will be able to download three songs for free at launch, including My Own Summer by the Deftones, Blue Monday by New Order, and Burning Down the House by Talking Heads.
5421199	5421559	Nice.
5422600	5424422	How does it feel?
5426144	5427085	I want to sing that song.
5427305	5429888	DarkSakura, you need to have a rock band party when this game comes out.
5430128	5430528	Okay.
5431894	5433895	I'm getting the keyboard, for sure.
5433935	5440020	Now, again, please assure me, Mr. Guy who works at the distributor, please assure me I will be able to get keyboard plus game.
5440320	5441360	That's it, right?
5441521	5442221	Yes, absolutely.
5442261	5443562	That's a bundle that is available.
5443742	5447565	In fact, I don't believe they have full band bundles for this one.
5447585	5457932	I think it's just the game by itself, and then I want to say maybe they may have a full bundle, but I haven't seen it.
5458272	5458352	Um...
5459853	5464196	But I know that the keyboard game bundle is out there.
5464456	5470199	In fact, I believe that it's already available for pre-order through certain websites and with Stop.
5471060	5474021	And yes, keyboard bundle, $130.
5474302	5474582	Pro guitar, $150.
5482734	5484395	Or you can buy the keyboard by itself for $80.
5485936	5487416	What would I do with the keyboard by itself?
5487477	5488237	I need a game to play.
5488257	5490898	I guess I could use it as a MIDI keyboard, but that's dumb.
5491258	5493240	I want to play Blue Monday.
5493820	5495341	How does it feel?
5495761	5498382	And there's the Queen song, right?
5498422	5499123	Bohemian Rhapsody?
5499663	5500043	Yeah.
5500223	5502544	Oh my god, I can't wait to play these on Pro Expert.
5502825	5506907	Because then once I learn how to do it, you can actually go to a real keyboard.
5506947	5507807	What about that guitar though? $150.
5510269	5511009	I don't need it.
5511189	5511589	I don't need it.
5512270	5513330	But there'll be some people that want it.
5514211	5515452	There's some people that are pretty hardcore.
5516612	5516893	All right.
5517833	5521135	One more story from me for you guys, and that has to do with Comic-Con.
5521255	5524417	Obviously, there has been like a games invasion at Comic-Con this year.
5524878	5526158	Lots and lots of stuff being shown.
5526178	5527359	I just wanted to run down for you guys.
5527619	5536645	I mean, it's almost like half of Comic-Con is basically E3 all over again, but even some new stuff, as we heard earlier, with Street Fighter X Tekken and vice versa.
5536665	5537005	Yeah.
5537225	5566145	Activision is there Activision is showing off a Spider-Man game which I don't think made it to the cut for our show tonight but apparently I'm hearing a lot of early buzz on the Spider-Man game that it's going to blow all the others out of the water which won't take much but there you go they're also showing Guitar Hero and Call of Duty as well Capcom's there showing Marvel vs. Capcom 3 that's obviously their big big thing that they're pushing understandably but obviously they're going to work in plugs for Dead Rising 2 and El Camino and all this other stuff
5566825	5568106	EA is apparently there too.
5568486	5573868	They actually took Rock Band 3 to the show because, you know, when I think comic books, I think Rock Band 3 in my living room.
5574648	5576029	Dead Space 2 is there.
5576109	5580491	Dragon Age 2 is supposedly there and playable, which is more than they had at E3.
5581271	5582271	Again, yet another game.
5583352	5584452	Hudson is there too.
5584552	5586353	Bomberman Live apparently they're showing.
5587093	5588014	Konami is there.
5589014	5592736	Hideo Kojima, Nintendo, Metroid Other M, Dragon Quest IX, Sony Computer Entertainment, LittleBigPlanet 2, Killzone 3, Gran Turismo 5
5609442	5610123	among other things.
5610183	5614865	And of course, Warner Brothers had to take Super Scribblenauts to their massive booth they have.
5615865	5620728	And then Microsoft and Xbox took their Summer of Arcade lineup there.
5620768	5626971	That of course includes Limbo, Hydro Thunder, the new Tomb Raider game, among other things.
5627551	5628912	And THQ's there.
5629312	5630553	Lots and lots of video games.
5630953	5634415	Square Enix, I guess, is there showing off Final Fantasy IV Heroes of Light.
5634915	5636615	No word on if they're showing 14, though.
5636635	5639056	Which, by the way, I did give the beta another try this week.
5640796	5640917	And?
5643197	5644577	I got other stuff to play this fall.
5645438	5645738	Sorry.
5646138	5647458	No, sir, he did not like it.
5648538	5649879	It looks really good.
5649979	5650599	It's pretty.
5650659	5651019	Gorgeous.
5651039	5651879	It's really pretty.
5652419	5657361	But, you know, a pretty painting.
5657661	5658421	Wah, wah.
5659494	5665018	Final Fantasy XIV Final Fantasy XIV Final Fantasy XIV
5689158	5690299	I like that description.
5690379	5691079	I like that, too.
5691899	5692180	All right.
5693720	5698622	Hey, how about we stop looking at new games and take a trip down memory lane?
5699403	5702364	It's a segment on the show here we call the Classic Game of the Week.
5702724	5715290	And every week, DarkSakura likes to go into the vault and find one game that she's been playing and say, Hey, you kids and your comic cons and your newfangled stuff need to take a minute to respect...
5716488	5718149	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?
5718169	5718969	Hydro Thunder!
5718989	5719470	Hydro Thunder.
5719510	5722111	Let me fire up some music here from Hydro Thunder.
5722131	5722852	Hydro, choose your track!
5722912	5723772	Arctic Circle!
5745726	5747790	This is the sequel this weekend.
5757265	5758205	I love the name of that ship.
5758405	5759686	Damn the torpedoes.
5759806	5762347	That's the one that Dan would always use.
5763087	5766108	At any rate, it was part of the Thunder series of games.
5766188	5770789	This game came out in 1999 and had a Dreamcast release.
5771629	5774830	And then it came out for PlayStation and Nintendo 64 in 2000.
5775750	5780652	The other Thunder games is Offroad Thunder, Four Wheel Thunder, and Arctic Thunder, which Arctic Thunder is pretty damn fun.
5781829	5784590	Anyway, it's racing with boats.
5785411	5791334	You have places like the Arctic Circle, and you have New York Disaster, which is sort of a post-apocalyptic.
5791714	5797277	You've got the Greek Isles and Thunder Park, which is like a whole rally type of setting with water.
5798937	5801739	You've got different booths all over the place.
5803840	5804680	Ones that will...
5806421	5807282	The Red Ones, um...
5815927	5843876	they give you more fuel as opposed to the blue ones so you do have a fuel gauge at least as far as your boosts are concerned and then with boosting you can actually do jumps or you can knock boats sort of off the track and it's pretty cool the arcade cabinet was the same type of cabinet as Cruisin' USA and Off-Road Thunder except it didn't have the flip pedals that use the throttle
5845036	5858264	and, um, it had, um, an interesting type of volume deal where, um... He just ran over a penguin, that bastard!
5858284	5860485	I'm just saying.
5860825	5864708	It had a subwoofer in the seat, so you could feel like you were actually on a boat.
5865308	5866249	I'm on a boat!
5867631	5872097	With your boats, you had the easy ones, you had four categories.
5872617	5875982	There were easy, medium, hard, and bonus.
5877063	5881729	With easy, you had damn the torpedoes, midway, and misbehave.
5882310	5883852	It had a big fan instead of a propeller.
5884412	5890496	Medium Boats, you had Banshee, Tidal Blade, Thresher.
5891716	5896259	And the Tidal Blade is the cover for the Dreamcast thing.
5896319	5903023	The hard ones, you had Cutthroat, Radhazard, that was sort of like UFO, and Razorback.
5905685	5908246	That one was on the PlayStation and 1064 ones.
5908626	5911128	And if you pick one of those, they say, you're crazy.
5914147	5915287	Whoa, your mic cut out again.
5916388	5917848	What?
5918288	5919769	Something is weird in that connection.
5919789	5920469	I don't know what it is.
5920769	5923010	I'll use the other one.
5924070	5924551	How's this?
5925271	5927532	Perfect.
5927752	5933033	With the bonus boats, you had Tiny Tanic, which was a small version of the Titanic.
5933654	5937575	And you had the Blowfish and Chumdinger, which was a fishing boat.
5938335	5939996	It would actually bark at the other boats.
5940396	5943597	You also have Armed Response, which is the police boats with the turret guns.
5946270	5948112	There was all the different tracks, like I mentioned.
5948132	5953536	We had Thunder Park, Lost Island, The Arctic Circle, then going into Medium, we had Lake Powell, which is one that was really fun.
5954237	5959481	It's like a lake in the middle of Utah that's actually the same Lake Powell is supposed to be.
5960182	5969450	There's a Far East, Greek Isles, and then the hard tracks, there was Ship Graveyard, Venice Canals, and New York Disaster, which New York Disaster was actually kind of my favorite.
5969870	5981515	And then the bonus ones, you had Castle Von Dandy, Nile Adventure, which was the longest tracking game, Catacombs, and Hydra Speedway, which was the one that was the rally style.
5984196	5987057	There were different versions, of course.
5987818	5989218	Like I said, there was the Dreamcast one.
5989779	5993020	The PlayStation one had a career mode in it.
5993740	5997242	The Dreamcast, though, was closest to the arcade of any of the consoles.
5997742	6003025	Nintendo 64 version was actually amazingly fun and really good for what it was.
6003425	6006746	It had a four-player multiplayer instead of two-player.
6007687	6010848	And you could do that with the Nintendo 64 expansion pack.
6011469	6014590	And the Dreamcast version is the one that's on Midway Arcade Treasures 3.
6015891	6017872	There's also a PC version that was out in Europe.
6018972	6021934	The Dreamcast version was one of the Sega All-Star titles.
6022994	6023135	And...
6025395	6052123	there is going to be a sequel out well there's a spiritual sequel already out called H2 Overdrive which is pretty fun the original team that worked on Hydro Thunder did H2 Overdrive through Raw Thrills and then Hydro Thunder Hurricane is going to be out on Xbox Live Arcade and Microsoft bought the rights after Midway was acquired by Warner Brothers so there you have it
6055071	6058213	Alright, your classic game of the week, Hydro Thunder.
6058353	6059433	Damn the torpedoes.
6061975	6062555	Good pick.
6062955	6067097	I remember playing this at RVGL to cool off between DDR.
6067357	6071460	And this is one game that Dan picked out that I actually went with.
6072120	6072480	Alright.
6072760	6073361	Well, thank you, Dan.
6074681	6076002	Since he's not here, butthead.
6076602	6079504	Well, he should be listening to this show every week.
6080515	6080675	Right.
6080955	6081235	All right.
6081575	6084197	Anyhow, that's going to do it for Part A here at Orange Lounge Radio.
6084237	6086037	But hey, we have plenty more show to go.
6086077	6094801	We got your Twitter topics coming up in Part B. We're going to be talking Mega Man Universe, a little more about StarCraft II, Phantasy Star Universe.
6095161	6099863	Yes, a four-year-old game we'll be talking about as well because there's some new news and, of course, our rapid-fire news.
6100463	6104065	All when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6110293	6112695	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
6136974	6137614	All that good stuff.
6137634	6139795	So we'll get into Twitter topics in just a little bit.
6140035	6142716	Of course, we have to do Rapid Fire News in just a moment.
6142796	6144137	But I want to talk about this real quick.
6144857	6152340	Remember last week on the show we had a story about the Kmart was going to start to post reviews from their website.
6152360	6154120	They would actually post them on the shelves of the story.
6154160	6155381	You guys remember us talking about this?
6155781	6155981	Okay.
6156281	6157201	Well, apparently –
6159262	6169386	Well, we told our listeners that they should start writing these completely nonsensical, like stupid things and submit them into the Kmart reviews and that would be really funny just to like flood their reviews with a bunch of dumb stuff.
6169766	6172267	Well, we had at least one listener submit one review.
6172887	6175028	So thank you to that one individual who did.
6175788	6177509	SSJ100Matt sent this in.
6177549	6177989	I love it.
6178049	6183311	He submitted a review of Red Dead Redemption and it's on the PlayStation 3 and I love this.
6183811	6187993	You have to check this out because you Bomani fans will get a kick out of this.
6188493	6190273	This game is Dynamite Rave.
6190373	6191974	It's a review by Mr. Spanky.
6192774	6195234	Wow, I can't stop falling in love with this game.
6195554	6201335	This game has you go west to play the hero and tackle the hysteria of the end of the century Wild West.
6201775	6206976	You can drop out of the story mode at any time and dive into the online multiplayer with your friends.
6207476	6208236	Be for you.
6208316	6209357	Head over to buy this.
6209677	6214417	Be sure to bring your ID to show to the kind lady at Kmart because it's rated M for Mature.
6214757	6215858	Put your faith in me.
6216158	6217738	This game is sweet like candy.
6218138	6218758	Alsoholic.
6220238	6223499	So you should proceed immediately to Kmart's website and upvote that review.
6223919	6225339	And write more, because that's great.
6226140	6230040	I know not everybody's going to get that joke, but for the Bomani folks, that's awesome.
6230360	6233181	For those that don't, go write something even worse.
6234041	6235381	Good times on Kmart reviews.
6236222	6239922	Alright, let's get into the rapid fire news and some actual gaming news that happened this week.
6240322	6242463	Stuff we have in short little bites for you guys.
6242703	6242903	Loki.
6244529	6245770	7 part epic, 2112
6272490	6290699	and uh i guess it's a few parts that are progressive rock and then uh i don't know i've never heard the song but that's a long ass song 20 minutes that's ridiculous that's almost like that one achievement in rock band that you have to play like every single song in the game and it takes on like an hour or two
6291926	6295147	Yeah, that makes me think of Inigata... Is my mic working?
6295167	6296648	I think barely.
6297548	6299068	It's wired for Jamie, not you.
6299248	6301089	Try giving that one to Jamie and use that one.
6301589	6302389	Live radio, yay.
6302509	6312533	As far as epic songs for a rock band, since they have a keyboard, they should do Inigata De Vida, which I think is a good 23 minutes with the keyboards.
6313013	6313533	Good times.
6314573	6316514	That song is one whole hallucination.
6319368	6324330	Something else that was at Comic-Con this week, and I don't even know why it was at Comic-Con.
6324390	6327251	It's like Kencha Hulk type of stuff.
6327651	6334373	But apparently they had a game from an independent developer called Bobo's.
6335353	6362678	Big Adventure and you may not remember Abobo but sadly I think I do Abobo is from Double Dragon yes and Abobo's Big Adventure has him going through a bunch of 8-bit NES classics kind of parody style it is a PC game but they had it displayed on a cabinet I would like to read this brief I'm sure this game is extremely legal
6363382	6366426	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6384026	6385128	Thank you for watching!
6399947	6402551	It was like all of NES stuff was out to get him.
6403573	6415210	It only felt better when an 8-bit bystander walked up to Bobo and he ripped his head off and ate it and then used his body to fight a charging skateboarder from TNC Surf.
6415615	6415935	What?
6417736	6423838	Another level called Super Mabobo found Bobo in a jail cell.
6424078	6427639	After picking up trash and eating it, Bobo had to use the cell toilet.
6428159	6437522	Something he ate must not have been agreed with him because a massive vertical column of shit came out of his ass and somehow had him flying over the toilet and falling down into...
6440024	6441506	You're just making this up.
6458705	6464110	I feel like a bunch of 19-year-olds got really high one night.
6464671	6467774	And in between eating Cheetos, they just started talking.
6468215	6470998	And somebody was like, dude, dude, that's really good.
6471038	6473680	Dude, that's hella funny, dude.
6474001	6475362	Dude, you should write that down.
6475622	6475943	Dude.
6476163	6476924	And they did.
6477324	6481188	It's like things to get posted to Newgrounds when you're blackout drunk, basically.
6481248	6486072	It's funny that you should mention that at Newgrounds, because that's where this game will be featured at some point.
6486132	6487173	What a surprise!
6487674	6489235	What a goddamn surprise!
6489916	6492438	I'm gonna fall over and die from that surprise.
6493419	6498064	So, yeah, Bobo's Big Adventure is supposed to be out in December.
6498224	6500286	It looks funny, I guess.
6500486	6500846	I don't know.
6502228	6506636	Um, and then finally... That plot he read sounded like the plot to The Poop That Took a Pee.
6509441	6510422	The Poop That Took a Pee.
6510723	6511885	It was on an episode of South Park.
6511925	6512406	I remember that.
6513307	6514690	As narrated by Morgan Freeman.
6516628	6516748	Right?
6516768	6517489	It was Morgan Freeman?
6517589	6518670	It was Morgan Freeman.
6519110	6520731	The Pope that took a pee.
6522532	6524233	By Leopold Butterscotch.
6525154	6525614	Anything.
6527035	6532099	Legend of Mana is going to be the next game hitting the Japanese PlayStation 1 classics.
6532219	6532619	Nice.
6533079	6535121	On the PlayStation Network, of course.
6537803	6538523	Legend of Mana.
6538563	6540925	It'll be out next week.
6540946	6542287	Worst game ever.
6542647	6543208	For $600 to $650.
6543668	6548172	That means it's going to be to other regions soon.
6550014	6555879	Speaking of poops that took a pee, Legend of Mana is seriously my least favorite PlayStation game.
6555919	6558362	I was so disappointed in that game.
6558422	6562465	I realize it has its fans and what have you, but I was expecting...
6563326	6566248	What I think was really, and keep in mind, this was many years ago.
6566289	6568911	I didn't know there was this whole import gaming scene and everything.
6569211	6576257	So in my mind, what really was second Datsetsu 3, I thought was what I was going to get with Legend of Mana.
6576337	6578619	And then it was like, I don't understand.
6578719	6580180	What is this?
6581040	6582181	But you liked it, didn't you, Alan?
6582201	6582902	You were telling me one day.
6582962	6583262	I did.
6583763	6584343	I did like it.
6584663	6585704	I played it all the way through.
6585764	6587025	I did every little stupid quest.
6587045	6588547	Gosh, you probably like Saga Frontier, too.
6589435	6591837	Well, I had the Japanese one.
6591877	6594439	That game was terrible.
6594559	6597722	It was so heavy language-wise, I couldn't play it very well.
6599243	6600584	Do you like the Saga series, too?
6601124	6601785	No, not really.
6602626	6607970	I was really excited about Saga Frontier because it made it sound like Chrono Trigger with the combo attacks.
6609111	6611533	And I played it, and yeah, that was pretty awful.
6612053	6612914	It lasted an hour.
6613474	6614595	Yeah, it lasted about an hour, too.
6614615	6615716	I was like, this game's terrible.
6616161	6616441	All right.
6617142	6618804	Anyhow, let's move on to some other quick news.
6619465	6623810	Hey, up there in Canada, you're going to be getting Netflix finally.
6624350	6625832	Of course, I'm talking about Canada.
6625852	6626713	I'm not that stupid.
6627333	6629256	Canada is finally getting Netflix.
6629836	6630617	Actually, I got to be honest.
6630877	6632860	I didn't realize they didn't already have it.
6633300	6633861	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6655038	6659822	So you'll be able to get this in Canada on the 360, the PS3, and Wii.
6660142	6667188	So they're being a little vague on if it's going to be the exact same movies and so forth because of clearances and so forth.
6667548	6682440	But they do give you the nice little marketing fluff of Canadian Netflix members will be able to instantly watch a broad array of movies and TV episodes right on their TVs via a range of consumer electronic devices capable of streaming from Netflix as well as PCs and Macs.
6682880	6683081	So
6684061	6690906	Yeah, you're going to be getting it, but it's probably not going to look the exact same as it does here, at least not right away.
6693368	6712981	Joystick had emailed Netflix looking for comment, and Netflix responded to the big blog, We're not announcing the Netflix-ready devices until the service launches, but it's fair to assume that several popular brand-name devices will be capable of streaming from Netflix to TVs at launch, in addition to the ability to watch instantly on computers, and that will add to the family of devices over time.
6713961	6715603	So hooray for you guys in Canada, I suppose.
6716584	6721129	Plants vs. Zombies is going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, finally.
6721649	6722550	Early September.
6722850	6726854	I played this on an iPad this week a little bit, because I was looking at an iPad.
6727295	6729057	I wanted to buy one, and then I thought...
6731697	6733198	I already have an iPod.
6750009	6753851	Castlevania Puzzle Encore of the Night is now available on the App Store.
6753951	6756692	It's actually getting pretty decent reviews, so I checked it out.
6757033	6763176	I haven't been able to play it myself, but just if you were curious, it is now available on the App Store, so I'll have to check that out at some point.
6763756	6766137	Sadly, I can't do it right now because I'm trying to do a show.
6766698	6767198	DarkSakura.
6768576	6777401	In other news, we have LittleBigPlanet 2 dated for the 16th of November here in the U.S.
6779122	6780443	The European date's not out yet.
6781304	6785606	And the collector's edition will have a plushie sack boy and bookends.
6788547	6797837	There will be different pre-order and exclusive costumes and five LittleBigPlanet 2 PlayStation Network avatars, which should be $80.
6798778	6800941	Something sounds gross about plushy sack boy.
6802979	6804620	If you squeeze him, he goes plush on you.
6807722	6817950	And then for our downloads for the UK, we've got 3D Space Tank, DSiWare, also known as Xscape.
6820551	6821452	Then we've got...
6822953	6826896	As soon as it loads, because my computer's slow.
6827577	6830859	Minor Disturbance, M-I-N-E-R, which is for iPhone.
6831480	6832761	It's 99 pence.
6834542	6838786	Astro Dodge, which is also for iPhone, for £1.24.
6838826	6839987	Sorry, it's taking a while.
6840007	6845191	Pearl Harbor Trilogy, 1941, Red Sun Rising for WiiWare, 700 Wii Points.
6850955	6855518	Crossfire, Xbox Live Indie Games, and that's it.
6856858	6871206	Now, we also have other cool news for those of us who are Capcom fans, is that they're doing an online version of Street Fighter III Third Strike, which they're calling it...
6872066	6901148	Street Fighter 3 Third Strike Online which is an update to the Dreamcast one but you want to know what they already made it and I already own it it was the for matching service you remember how when everything has a long title I usually end for matching service on it that's it it came out in Japan already so I've already got it yeah but most people over here never heard of it so you know with the success of their online games I'm assuming they're just giving this the old Xbox Live Arcade update correct
6901658	6902738	Yeah, pretty much.
6904859	6906260	Wow, that mic sucks, Jamie.
6906420	6907160	I don't know what to say.
6907380	6913222	No, it's probably me because my voice isn't very... No, I mean you cut completely out.
6913302	6913882	It's the cord.
6913922	6914542	It's not your voice.
6915283	6916163	Well, shit.
6916543	6918644	Exactly, huh?
6918704	6919724	I'll take Alan's mic.
6920324	6920864	Thank you.
6920944	6922005	You're being nice for sharing.
6922665	6925106	Let's move on to some Twitter topics.
6927421	6929323	Twitter.com slash OLR.
6929383	6932727	You guys send us tweets every week and we respond to them live on air.
6932768	6934970	Maybe there's stories we didn't get around to sharing.
6935491	6937113	Who knows what it's all about.
6937653	6940277	We're going to start off with Deathwishing tonight.
6940697	6943701	Do you guys hate Kotek2, the evil CEO?
6943761	6946484	He's my least favorite human being next to Aquaman.
6947565	6948586	Do we hate Bobby Kotick?
6948626	6950026	Hate is a strong word.
6950046	6950987	And yes.
6951527	6952608	But yes.
6953668	6955909	TigerClaw305 sends us a link.
6955949	6956970	He always sends us great links.
6957370	6960052	Disney is in talks apparently to buy Playdom.
6960492	6964294	Playdom, by the way, made such awesome Facebook games like Sorority Life.
6965374	6967335	Disney bought what?
6967375	6967995	Tapulous?
6968335	6970656	And so now Disney is in talks with Playdom.
6971096	6974697	Buy them out for $500 million is what they're saying.
6975317	6981999	Again, these are all rumors, but Disney's going to use this company to incorporate its popular brands and characters into social games.
6982559	6984820	Playdom, by the way, is based out of Mountain View, California.
6984840	6985340	I never knew that.
6985960	6986721	That's not that far away.
6987841	6988761	So yeah, there you go.
6988901	6992082	Apparently Disney might use its ESPN brands on some of this as well.
6992923	6993943	Could be very interesting.
6994483	7000338	Playdom ranks third behind Zynga and Playfish, by the way, just so you know, of big social game companies.
7002509	7002989	Let's see.
7004850	7009153	Some folks retweeting our congratulatory message to Bobby.
7009253	7009933	So, congrats, Bobby.
7010854	7011074	Let's see.
7011114	7016637	Spazinator says, Do you think we'll ever see a Mortal Kombat vs. Street Fighter game?
7017177	7019559	There's been a lot of talk tonight about Street Fighter X Tekken.
7019999	7028864	What about the two ultimate, I guess in some regards, maybe even top, if you dare go there, fighting game franchises, Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat?
7028884	7029684	Could it ever happen?
7029865	7030465	What do you guys think?
7030745	7032346	Could Street Fighter vs. Mortal Kombat ever happen?
7032426	7035768	It could if they play nice with Warner.
7035788	7039770	I mean, obviously they're playing nice with other publishers.
7042271	7043212	It could happen.
7043912	7045753	Whether it will happen or not, I don't know.
7045933	7057479	I think someone did a Mugen one where they took the Street Fighter movie ones and the old Mortal Kombat that were all the image capture and did a Mugen version.
7058140	7059021	Just do Thrill Kill again.
7085600	7086621	Thrill Kill was horrible.
7087282	7091367	Yeah, see, I don't see a game where Sakura gets her spine ripped out.
7091627	7093529	I just, I can't, I can't.
7093769	7094950	There is something wrong with that.
7095051	7100797	Like, how would you feel about that, DarkSakura, if there was a game where you could just, like, totally rip Sakura's arms off?
7101658	7105522	Well, as long as they included a non-blacked out Shingo Kusatsu.
7107539	7109021	Damn it!
7109421	7112884	Am I in now?
7113065	7113265	Yeah.
7113425	7113745	Okay.
7114766	7129280	I was basically saying if they included a non-blacked out version of the Shingo Kusatsu with all kinds of beating up and breaking noses and bones and having it be really destructive and leave them as a bloody pulp, then maybe I could deal with it.
7130922	7147766	I don't know there just would have to be too much compromise one way or the other I just don't see like Street Fighter and Tekken kind of makes sense and as much as I love Soul Calibur like it wouldn't make sense like the Street Fighter people don't use weapons weapons are a huge part of Soul Calibur it wouldn't make sense so but Street Fighter, Tekken yeah I get that I get it
7148928	7150129	All right, let's see.
7150269	7154593	Other comments on our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
7156234	7157675	SJ100Matt is sending us a tweet.
7158035	7161779	Is Capcom jumping the shark releasing all of these versus games all at once?
7162299	7164461	I'm excited, but this should have happened 10 years ago.
7166033	7167854	Honestly, thank Street Fighter 4.
7168515	7171337	I honestly think Street Fighter 4 is the reason for a lot of this.
7171677	7177121	And I think the really warm reception the community had to this kind of made them decide to listen to the fans a little more.
7177221	7181263	And now they are just giving fans what they want left and right.
7181343	7183005	It's kind of like, what game do you want?
7183305	7184786	Oh, well, here you go then.
7185566	7187728	It's kind of where Capcom is going lately, you know.
7189109	7189709	So, I don't know.
7189769	7192511	DarkSakura, do you think this is too much or not enough or what?
7193031	7194512	I think it's just right.
7194933	7195273	All right.
7196627	7199089	Alright, and last tweet from RockmanRock.
7200649	7201950	That's not a redundant name at all.
7201970	7202511	I love that name.
7202571	7203411	RockmanRock.
7204152	7205492	Why are you guys so awesome?
7206093	7206573	Is the tweet.
7206613	7207854	Why are you guys so awesome?
7208454	7209375	I was born that way.
7211176	7211916	That's very nice.
7212657	7216899	Some days I do think I'm awesome, but some days I don't feel so awesome.
7218000	7219001	Oh, Rob, why not?
7219281	7221802	I just, you know, some days are harder than others.
7221842	7223263	But your tweets help me get through the day.
7224244	7224784	I appreciate it.
7226124	7228411	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us some tweets.
7228451	7230136	For now, more news, Loki.
7233493	7239014	So, apparently their Rockstar is cracking down on Red Dead Redemption cheaters.
7240155	7245036	Now, I have a problem with them saying that, because that's not exactly what's going on here.
7245816	7251738	They're cutting... I guess they're cracking down on people that are utilizing glitches in the game.
7251878	7258100	For example, they're saying that people are glitching into parts of the map that you're not supposed to be able to glitch into.
7258180	7259160	Like, for example, there's a...
7260460	7273690	Uh, a house that's in kind of the Mexico part of the game where you can actually kind of aim at or walk into the corner of a wall and you'll clip through the ground and you can shoot at stuff underneath it.
7274210	7279434	And apparently people are pissed off that they're getting shot by people that they can't shoot back at.
7279554	7286299	And so because of that, you know, they're going to start patching the game or fixing it so they can't clip through these different things.
7287697	7306700	whatever fine do that people will just find other glitches since the game is super glitchy but it's not legitimate cheating say you know where they've modded the game to make their guns fire rockets or something like that like that happens in Grand Theft Auto like crazy no one's figured out how to do that yet
7309269	7310610	Exploits are not hacks.
7310711	7312752	There's a huge difference between an exploit and a hack.
7312872	7313473	Exactly.
7314954	7323040	I don't understand why people are up in arms about this crap because you just don't go where those players are then because you can see them on the map.
7323060	7324121	They're not invisible.
7324822	7328244	Obviously, if they're under a building or something and they keep shooting at you...
7329145	7331747	Then perhaps you should walk away from them.
7352739	7359222	I also agree that exploits are not cheating because I've played a lot of these online games, kind of like fan games.
7359462	7360302	Don't make fun of me, okay?
7360582	7365124	Of Survivor and Big Brother and a lot of those reality shows that have very game-centric things.
7365584	7370926	And people will put together challenges, and I love to find loopholes in the challenge rules and win every time.
7371086	7371406	I do that.
7371426	7372547	Immunity is very important.
7373407	7376068	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7395875	7396616	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7416435	7419416	and kind of figuring out how they did different things and it makes me a better player.
7420056	7427597	Now granted, it's not like I'm using modded weapons that fire rockets at people like crazy and there's lots of people out there that do that.
7427877	7439199	There's a difference between utilizing the nuances of the game, the different glitches and actually cheating in a game to the point that it's an unfair advantage.
7440580	7441640	Knowledge is not cheating.
7443072	7443832	Cheating is cheating.
7444613	7447834	Alright, and if you cheat in an online game, you're kind of a dick anyway.
7448174	7451995	Unless you're cheating with your friends and you all agree that cheating's okay.
7452435	7453035	That's different.
7453276	7459698	Well, if you're doing that, like the modded games that we'll play against each other, that's not necessarily cheating.
7459898	7462239	It's just you're playing with a whole different set of rules now.
7462259	7463479	It's having more fun.
7463819	7465040	It's a mod.
7465320	7466040	It's not cheating.
7466240	7466520	DarkSakura.com
7480598	7481538	Remember, always, I want to be with you
7509810	7512372	I almost forgot to show that to Loki, but something reminded me of that earlier.
7512572	7513572	I knew it was out.
7514493	7519276	Other people were like, I can't believe you made me buy that game because you keep talking about it.
7519296	7521377	I'm like, I haven't played it in months now.
7521397	7523238	You were playing it last week on the show.
7523358	7525359	I was not playing it last week on the show.
7525399	7526460	Two weeks ago on the show.
7526620	7528041	It wasn't two weeks ago either.
7528221	7528721	Yes, it was.
7529242	7530602	I'll go in the archives and find it.
7531643	7534865	If you turn up the music really loud in the background, you'll hear...
7536198	7538680	Always I wanna be with you
7559634	7562196	Anyhow, no, really, it's about the Mega Man universe.
7562536	7571764	A little more information, I mean, little, little more information at Comic-Con this week from Akiko Ito actually talked about this a little bit.
7571804	7572604	He's the producer.
7573025	7576828	I'm sorry, actually, it's Kenji Inafune actually talked about this.
7576868	7578929	He's the producer of Mega Man universe.
7579550	7582712	And no, he's the creator of Mega Man.
7583613	7584534	No, he's a homeless man.
7584634	7585314	I don't know who he is.
7585334	7591377	Kenji Inafune is the creator of Mega Man and Akiko Ito is the Mega Man Universe producer.
7591597	7592057	There we go.
7592918	7595099	Can't you tell I'm like totally up on my video game trivia?
7595179	7599001	Anyway, Mega Man Universe, of course, is coming out eventually.
7599881	7603483	And they say it will let you play as the Mega Man of your dreams.
7604083	7610707	The concept of Mega Man Universe, quote, came from the idea of what Mega Man is and what it means to different people.
7612521	7640735	everyone has a unique idea of what Mega Man is and they even referred to the quote crappy version of Mega Man from the original cartridge that character they don't know about they didn't really say like what the game really really is but a lot of people are inferring like maybe it's just like that and I think Loki said this last week on the show it's kind of like that Nintendo championships or whatever they call that game with all the Nintendo characters the Nintendo crossover game Mario crossover right
7641515	7644678	And the crowd promptly started shouting Mega Man Legends 3.
7660672	7674183	and he just smiled and said thank you and didn't confirm oh god I hope so it better not be we only cause I will be pissed the game will also not be out for a while I don't know what a while is but it's gonna be a while
7676007	7676327	Sorry.
7676888	7681671	I want to know where the universe thing is, if that means online or if that's because of all the characters in it.
7681871	7684133	I think it's because it's going to have all the different games in it.
7684513	7685974	Be in another galaxy.
7686095	7686975	Thank you, DarkTetsuya.
7687015	7688176	Super Mario Crossover.
7688957	7689817	That's what I was thinking of.
7690658	7692419	Alright, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
7693160	7693900	Stuff.
7695181	7701146	This is for Marvel vs. Capcom, actually, which is some pretty cool stuff, I'd like to say.
7702227	7705449	Four new characters have been confirmed at Comic-Con.
7706986	7710229	We have her, Chun-Li.
7711750	7712691	Yay, I like Chun-Li.
7712731	7713992	I'm like that hater over there.
7715013	7715393	Hater.
7716054	7720017	Dr. Doom, because all must fall before Doom.
7720838	7729846	The Super Scroll, which is... I have to mention real quick, I saw a custom license plate the other day that said, I am Doom.
7730680	7731240	That's cool.
7732121	7732881	That is pretty cool.
7733561	7733802	Okay.
7734762	7739604	So yeah, Doctor Doom is the Super Skrull who is a newbie in the versus whole deal.
7740665	7743927	And he's, I guess, going to have all the powers of the Fantastic Four.
7744707	7745387	And Trish.
7747448	7748329	Trish.
7750470	7753252	In the teaser trailer, there was an outline of the beautiful Joe.
7753612	7754973	So, pretty cool.
7756834	7757514	Trish.
7758775	7759796	Leathery, tasty.
7759896	7762477	Didn't they also announce the... Am I jumping ahead?
7762518	7762838	I'm sorry.
7763538	7763778	What?
7763918	7766100	The dog from Okami?
7767741	7768281	I think, yeah.
7768421	7768841	I saw a video.
7768881	7770182	Amaratsu is confirmed.
7770242	7770582	Yeah.
7771143	7771623	It's awesome.
7771643	7772324	If I said that right.
7772544	7772724	Yeah.
7773764	7774305	Good times.
7774925	7775145	Alright.
7776106	7777507	Yeah, that's... And also Thor.
7777527	7777727	Thor.
7778743	7780864	Yeah, so I guess there's a lot of characters they're showing.
7782145	7782785	Good times.
7783906	7784706	Loki, what do you got for us?
7798014	7799235	I'm suing you over My Baby.
7799576	7801377	Apparently... Now who that is?
7801477	7802258	My Baby Mama?
7802318	7803359	Now who that is?
7803459	7814748	Southview Games is taking legal action against Majesco specifically regarding the right to publishing My Baby titles in the United States.
7815828	7830297	This was spurred by an announcement last month that Majesco would publish My Baby 3 and Friends, an action South Peak claims Majesco wasn't legally allowed to take.
7831318	7836500	for its part as Southweek issued this statement on the impeding litigation.
7836940	7844602	We are exceptionally proud of our success in making the My Baby franchise in North America.
7845062	7855145	Our innovative sales, marketing, and PR strategies brought My Baby to a huge audience and built a loyal fan base for future products.
7856285	7857946	Oh, where?
7858747	7859927	Okay.
7860007	7866631	South Peak continues to hold the rights to subsequent My Baby games, and we intend to vigorously protect those rights.
7867472	7881800	Additionally, we've confirmed that while South Peak claims a contractual right to publish subsequent My Baby games in the U.S., Noblis owns the My Baby IP.
7882900	7889004	So, it's up to, I guess, Noblis to decide, I guess, who publishes what.
7889805	7896650	And... Yeah, so, basically, they're just complaining about that, but...
7899995	7900375	I don't know.
7900656	7901316	I think it's dumb.
7902717	7909582	Honestly, I know that my BB games sell somewhat because people like their sim games and little girls love this stuff.
7910623	7915926	But, I mean, honestly, we're talking like these games sell maybe, maybe 200,000 units.
7916067	7918668	I mean, those are like eye of judgment numbers there.
7918889	7922451	I mean, to give you an example of how much these fail.
7924072	7925013	So, I don't know.
7926929	7954473	I'm surprised that they wouldn't be suing like for say babysitting mama or something like that I'm surprised these games are such a big fucking deal in the first place you'd be surprised like those Imagine games they're terrible they have so many that come out they sell and even like Lillis Pet Shop which I hate you EA and your fucking three versions of the game that you gotta put out each year those sell well too it's just weird
7956900	7962421	Alright, well, this is also kind of weird, but cool, I guess, that it was considered, but it didn't happen.
7962761	7984186	This was running on a website, I've not heard of these guys before, but GamerANX.com was running this story, and it kind of caught wind and ended up on a lot of game blogs this week, and it was a comment that Rahul Sood, the Voodoo PC founder, and he's also the current CTO of gaming at Hewlett Packard, he actually revealed a couple months ago that there was a secret project
7985086	7987327	or an interesting one or a quiet one nonetheless.
7988147	7992989	At Microsoft, it would have allowed PC gamers to actually match up with console players.
7993469	7997550	So it wouldn't just be like Final Fantasy XI wouldn't be the only game that would be cross-platform.
7997950	7999171	It isn't the only game.
8000111	8001491	What else is cross-platform?
8001611	8003532	Shadowrun was cross-platform.
8003552	8004632	That's right, okay.
8004792	8008694	And also I believe there was another strategy game that was...
8011758	8012318	Thanks for watching!
8030544	8039369	I've heard from reliable sources that during the development they brought together the best console gamers to play mediocre PC gamers at the same game.
8039709	8040590	And guess what happened?
8040930	8046053	They pitted console gamers with their console controller against PC gamers with their keyboard and mouse.
8046633	8049234	The console players got destroyed every time.
8049655	8055438	So much so that it would be embarrassing to the Xbox team in general had Microsoft launched this initiative.
8056358	8061100	There's a little bit of that that sounds fanboy-y to me, especially knowing that these other games are out there.
8062081	8063321	What are you coughing about over there?
8063522	8071345	When we played Left 4 Dead online together on our PCs and I found out that you were playing with the Xbox controller, I was giving you side-eye for that reason.
8071806	8072166	Why?
8072306	8073226	I was doing fine.
8073266	8075667	Mouse and keyboard is superior.
8075767	8077548	And now this is the story.
8078229	8083151	I tell you, if they had cross-platform play on Grand Theft Auto, I would eat up any PC player.
8083772	8098395	Out there, I would destroy them But that's not a first person shooter It doesn't matter, it still has first person shooter Kind of controls I would destroy them All of them I don't give a shit if you're using a tomato To control the game
8098815	8099976	I will destroy you.
8118604	8121487	But I mean, it wouldn't be that damn hard.
8121507	8122948	There's USB ports.
8123608	8127852	I mean, would it be really difficult to, I don't know, map keys in a game or something?
8127932	8129334	Or use a mouse?
8129374	8130254	Here's the funny thing.
8130354	8131575	You can plug in a keyboard.
8131616	8133257	I used to use a keyboard on Final Fantasy XI.
8133397	8134938	Well, you can for certain games.
8135379	8138482	But I guess if you buy certain accessories...
8139082	8150288	There's ways to kind of shoehorn it in there, but why they don't offer it as an actual solution for, you know, say Call of Duty and stuff like that is beyond me because I think that'd be a great idea.
8150608	8153650	But then again, they wouldn't be able to sell accessories like they do.
8154371	8158053	I don't really think it's a big deal because most people will probably buy a controller anyways.
8158073	8162735	They're not going to just use strictly keyboard mouse for everything, but it'd be kind of cool.
8163315	8167758	And I wonder if they could actually do that, like have support for that.
8170922	8199365	I'm trying to look at some of our comments in our chat room chat.orange.radio.com Legend of Zaku is saying, Loki, prepare for an ass whooping with an 8 year old Logitech mouse I think, uh, but unfortunately you can't, I mean, you can't you can't with Grand Theft Auto because it's not well, obviously because it's not cross you know, cross platform especially if it's on 360 there's nothing cross platform anymore so that's too bad Bonds006 in our chat says, I will die with a keyboard in my hands
8202390	8202490	Aw.
8202870	8204171	I've tried playing Keyboard Mouse.
8204331	8206051	I just, I don't, don't like it.
8206431	8208132	You have to play Team Fortress 2 with it.
8208172	8214313	Like, you can't use a controller in Team Fortress 2 and it's probably part of the reason I'm forced to play a medic because you don't really have to aim very well.
8214373	8215393	You should play on the 360.
8216394	8217074	I guess I could.
8217894	8220315	But then I'd have to buy the game again.
8220335	8221215	I already bought it on Steam.
8222279	8235266	I remember when Left 4 Dead 2 came out last November and there was a lot of drama on a lot of the major blogs like Joystick and Kotaku who played the 360 version of the game and they gave it mediocre reviews saying it was too hard.
8235966	8238667	And then the sites that reviewed it on PC said it was fine.
8238927	8244730	And I guess the people playing it on Xbox 360 just couldn't... They just kept getting wiped out.
8245070	8249573	So I think the game was developed for both platforms but the keyboard and mouse people just...
8250353	8250914	Hand Advantage.
8250974	8251274	I don't know.
8251294	8252615	Just keep fanning those flames.
8252655	8254317	Just keep fanning those flames.
8254337	8255578	It's like, why did you give that game a 7?
8255958	8259281	It all came down to the controller, according to the reviewers.
8259942	8268149	Again, I hate to keep going back to this, and it's not a first-person shooter, but Final Fantasy XI, you could play with a controller in that game, and Jamie did, and she did quite well with it.
8268189	8270611	I mean, you have to set up your macros in advance, but you can do it.
8271031	8276474	But I had the triggers on top and I would just cycle through my macros through my trigger buttons.
8277654	8278995	And Rob saw me do it.
8279976	8282457	The complete edition was like five bucks on Steam this week.
8282697	8283357	I saw that.
8283377	8286159	It was a part of me that just kind of wanted to play it for a month.
8286319	8286459	Really?
8286659	8301073	It really was going to come down to if you want to do games that are cross-platform like that and you want to have everybody on kind of the same page, you need to make the controls more console-friendly, I guess, because that's what they're doing with DC Universe is they're making the stuff kind of translate over.
8303235	8307960	The controls are simple as it is, and so it translates over well to the actual controller.
8308707	8331029	I was you know what's funny and I don't know if I should be repeating this but I was told at E3 that the part of the reason why the games are not cross server at this time is because it played so much differently on the PC versus the PlayStation 3 and that one was having an advantage over the other and I wonder if it comes down to this whole same issue it's the PlayStation controller versus keyboard mouse could be
8332066	8333487	I'll play Warcraft with a keyboard and mouse.
8333507	8334568	I couldn't play that with a controller.
8335148	8337089	I don't even think you can play that with a controller.
8337109	8340131	I don't know, but it'd be weird.
8340151	8345615	For example, when I play PC games, I use an Xbox 360 controller a lot of times.
8345675	8350898	Grand Theft Auto and Crysis, I played with a 360 controller.
8351639	8352399	It worked great for me.
8353540	8355021	I never had any problems getting killed.
8355361	8356762	I don't want to keep on with this debate.
8357162	8359303	I want to hear what our folks have to say in the mailbag.
8359343	8362524	But one more story from DarkSakura about another MMO, right?
8363485	8367286	Yeah, for Phantasy Star Universe, they're getting a pretty big update.
8368907	8374590	There is going to be the Ambition of the Illuminous expansion, which is a free download.
8375810	8379672	I paid $15 for Abortion of the Illuminous like two years ago.
8380372	8380892	Bastards.
8381573	8381733	Hmm.
8383233	8393840	The Guardians Advanced Content is an automated update for the subscribers with new missions, weapons, items, customization system, and an overhaul of the game's classes and skills.
8394861	8399164	And Guardians will require Ambition of the Illuminous to work.
8400765	8401986	So that's why it's free, pretty much.
8403286	8403427	And...
8406093	8413515	I guess they're basically taking into account all of the problems that people had with Phantasy Star Universe.
8414875	8419716	All the stuff they took away from online that made it so much more fun.
8421257	8422797	I do think PSO was more fun.
8424357	8425598	You think it's worth revisiting?
8426518	8426938	Maybe.
8428498	8429939	I don't know that I want to play it on the 360.
8429999	8430159	Maybe.
8431380	8431780	DarkSakura.com
8458613	8462617	I'm not going to fully review the Puzzle Agent game as it's much like Professor Layton.
8463038	8466081	It's on Steam by Telltale Games who say my Max episodes sold well.
8466121	8470506	Let's say it's a game where you are in a town with OCD about puzzles.
8471387	8478674	There's very little point and click where you play trading games to advance is mostly all dialogue and puzzles.
8479315	8484036	I'm also playing the game La Di Da, and suddenly the game ends at what is typically the middle of the story.
8484576	8486817	I'm not upset about the game being too short.
8487297	8491138	I'm mad because the game was not listed as episodic, either that or I completely missed it.
8491558	8496800	A game like this is typically $5, but they have a single illustrator, so perhaps that bumped the game up to $10.
8498340	8500561	I'm also into Xbox Live Arcade game Limbo.
8501001	8503322	The game reminds me a lot of Out of This World.
8503342	8507964	That's because you are alone and the world feels completely alien despite the familiar setting of a forest.
8508605	8514968	If Sky remembers, I made a little big planet level in the same style called UFO Story and then they came.
8516188	8519310	It was gray silhouettes, foggy, and had strange lighting effects.
8519391	8522132	Limbo even had a tire swing at the beginning of the game.
8523353	8524514	I'm taking no credit, though.
8524554	8525595	It had to be coincidence.
8525695	8529478	Plus, my LittleBigPlanet level is nowhere near as good as Limbo.
8529618	8530819	In fact, it gets tedious.
8531739	8538144	Although I'm very proud of the spinning boss at the end, that foggy gray noir setting is nothing new in games.
8538824	8542505	By the way, it took me a good 80 hours to make that LittleBigPlanet level.
8542865	8545086	LittleBigPlanet construction is not for the dabbler.
8545746	8547887	A somewhat okay level takes 80 hours.
8548427	8550047	I wonder what a good or great level takes.
8550607	8558029	I do remember that level, and when I read the email earlier this week, I actually was like, oh yeah, it kind of did have that same kind of look and feel to it.
8558429	8558949	It's kind of funny.
8559430	8560810	I totally remember what you're talking about, Robbaba.
8561627	8562549	I'm going to Disney World.
8562730	8563051	Again.
8564414	8565436	Bring me back some pins, dude.
8565476	8565898	Jerk.
8565918	8566679	I want to go to Disney World.
8566699	8567381	I want some pins.
8567421	8568424	Can I go to Disney World?
8568684	8569667	Rob and I trade pins.
8572749	8574931	Last one is from Troy.
8575972	8578114	Hey, OLR, Troy again.
8578594	8581316	Have you guys seen the new Halo Reach Forge mode?
8581737	8588723	I don't know how big of FPS fans you guys are, but if you like Halo, the new Forge is like a little big planet for Halo.
8589403	8595428	Also, I went on a Super Stardust HD week and hopefully made it pretty high on the ranking list for the big battle.
8596389	8599710	Also, people who have the games and are listening really should join the big battle.
8600331	8604592	I know I was bored of video games until this came up, but now I think I love competitive gaming again.
8604612	8606653	And that's it.
8607353	8611495	Oh, well, I'm sure the folks that put that all together will be very nice to hear that.
8611875	8612115	Yep.
8612235	8613356	I'd be very happy to hear that.
8615317	8615557	Okay.
8616797	8617397	Let's move on.
8618898	8619178	Angst.
8619238	8621379	This is the part of the show where we get out our angst.
8621399	8623440	It's called the FUs of the Week.
8623460	8623600	Okay.
8640100	8643003	Okay, the first one would be me, wouldn't it?
8643243	8658297	F you to the hole in my hand, because, okay, it was fine with just the stitches, because it would pull a little bit and it was alright, but now it's like my hand is a lot more sore than it was last week since the stitches came out.
8658857	8687535	especially with that hole that now I have to do extra stuff to keep it closed and wear thick bandages on my palm it just makes my hand hurt a whole lot more and the sad thing with that is that typing on my keyboard hurts a lot and like I'll message people a little bit but like using my mouse hurts too but if I'm doing the two of them together then it really hurts and that's actually made it hard for me to play Star Trek Online
8688275	8692637	So, I haven't been doing all the gaming, haven't been really doing that much chatting online or anything.
8692757	8696078	It's just, it's just really sore.
8696218	8703620	Actually, the whole, the weird problem about it is that even though it's sore up at the top of my palm, the back of my hand is really sore too.
8704220	8707181	And I think it's where the bruise was left over from where they did the blood drain.
8707862	8711983	So, I'm just sore and it makes me a grumpy, grumpy, grumpy girl.
8713396	8714537	Like grumpier than usual?
8715578	8716498	That's really grumpy.
8717239	8720001	I'm quite grumpy.
8720641	8720881	Alright.
8722462	8726285	You need some more vitamin B. No, I don't need more vitamin B. I need ice cream.
8727205	8727866	I want ice cream.
8729537	8730578	I don't work tomorrow, just saying.
8730978	8733040	Loki.
8734301	8740527	F you to whoever was causing some crime today on Greenback Lane.
8741267	8744490	They actually had the whole street blocked off with police tape.
8744971	8745851	It was ridiculous.
8746372	8750215	So we had to go way around it, and I dislike that.
8750836	8751597	And bad drivers.
8751717	8753398	Could people stop being stupid?
8754479	8755340	Like, just in general.
8755834	8756475	I'm not talking to you.
8756515	8759137	The listeners of this show clearly are not stupid because they're listening to this show.
8759497	8765061	But just like the people out there, instead of listening to this show, that are out there on Greenback Avenue shooting each other, stop being stupid.
8766943	8767303	Seriously.
8768715	8769216	Seriously.
8770597	8771859	Alright, let's see.
8772540	8774963	My FU of the week, I'm going to give an FU to Apple.
8775944	8785876	I know, Loki's in heaven right now, but I think it's total bullshit that they released this OS that screws up my old phone, forcing me to get a new phone, but the new phone is not available anywhere.
8786437	8787078	It's bullshit!
8788866	8810983	I'm actually contemplating getting a different phone right now because I'm thinking like I can get the iPad it does everything the phone does but then I'm still I know I'm still biting the hand that I want to protest and I'm a hypocrite and blah blah blah but let's face it the iPhone is now kind of a gaming platform there's a lot I'm missing out on if I don't have one Salacious Pop what are your FUs of the week?
8812311	8813632	F you to the month of July.
8814453	8830533	I'm usually endeared to this month because it's my birthday month, but a lot of people that I follow on LiveJournal that I've been reading for years have been having to deal with sudden deaths of family members and their partners, and I have a friend who had to have ankle surgery.
8831354	8834455	Due to complications from his ankle surgery, he now has pneumonia.
8835115	8835836	Figure that one out.
8836856	8840797	So yeah, it's been a really hard month for a lot of people that I care about online.
8841178	8844919	So that just sucks that I can't really be there for them because they live far away.
8846218	8849459	F you to distance and people that are far away that you can't be there for.
8849659	8850339	Yeah.
8850419	8850859	I get that.
8851019	8851599	It sucks.
8852619	8852899	All right.
8853839	8854759	I have another one.
8855100	8855380	Quickly.
8855940	8856780	My brother's crazy.
8857880	8859080	F you to his brain disease.
8859120	8861861	Mine too, but in a whole different way.
8865521	8869622	He's a special kind of crazy, but we won't get into that on this episode of Ricky Lake.
8870042	8873443	All right, Loki, some gaming news, and then we'll get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8873463	8873603	Loki.
8875373	8883819	Yes, not to be outdone by Google, YouTube also has an Easter egg on it that allows you to play a game.
8885060	8891444	Apparently, if you go to Google, or not Google, YouTube, it's owned by Google now so it doesn't matter.
8892244	8915176	if you go to youtube.com and pull up any video whatever hold down the left arrow on your keyboard and after a few seconds you should be able to play the game Snake over the top of the video I used to love Snake on the old cell phones fun times
8916209	8916869	That's what I need to do.
8916909	8921611	I'm going to go trade in my iPhone and go get me one of those old-ass Nokia phones that have Snake on it.
8922051	8922532	Good times.
8923612	8924312	Does this still work?
8924352	8926073	You can probably get Snake for iPhone.
8928134	8928814	It's not the same.
8932096	8932796	It's not the same.
8935097	8944301	As much as I appreciate YYR, one of the listeners of the show, and I do think Snake 360 is a good game, it's just not the same as playing it on the old-school cell phone.
8944321	8944821	You know what I mean?
8945993	8946313	All right.
8947874	8953577	One other story for you guys, then we're going to get to the Skype line, 877-GAME-OLR, yada, yada.
8953737	8955077	This is about StarCraft II.
8955117	8956278	This is a StarCraft II story.
8956858	8965082	They're saying the launch for this is going to be big, big, huge, gigantic, because lots of stores are doing the midnight releases, of course.
8965122	8967063	This game's been, what, like 10 years in the making?
8967623	8971725	Blizzard is not saying how many copies of the game has been preordered, because they don't get into that.
8972325	8973346	Thank you for watching!
8994637	9020436	The story that I'm reading from the Orange County Register which is not a video game site specifically Blizzard obviously is in Anaheim which is kind of Orange County They are talking about this 18 year old who apparently plans to wait 72 hours in line for StarCraft 2 When asked why he said It's really hard to explain, I don't know, it's just something I'm crazy enough to enjoy I guess if people can stand in line for Twilight for that long I guess they can do it for StarCraft 2
9021477	9028428	Anyhow, World of Warcraft Wrath of the Lich King sold 2.8 million copies when it came out in the first 24 hours.
9028809	9030512	They think this could possibly top it.
9032751	9036093	One thing, though, that is not going to help sell the game is reviews.
9036633	9041896	There will be no reviews of StarCraft II Wings of Liberty before it launches on Tuesday.
9042616	9045758	The press will be reviewing the game when everybody else does.
9046718	9058324	I guess the publisher feels that the Battle.net service and the online features is so essential to the game that opening them up early when it's not really ready to go for the press to review it could be detrimental to the game.
9058624	9065107	Yeah, because people will pirate it like they already know the copies have already come out, but you can't play it until the bell and then servers are up.
9065828	9074172	There's going to be a day one patch for the game in order to give the developer, quote, a little bit more time to sort of get their ducks in a row.
9074512	9078455	That's basically telling me the game's not really totally ready and it comes out, oh, Tuesday.
9079435	9084700	So kind of what Alan was saying earlier, why don't you just wait three months for them to just actually get the game working?
9085781	9091305	There's a lot of pressure on at Blizzard right now, because if this game fails on launch day, there's going to be a lot of shit for it.
9091686	9096210	I will say this, I don't know if I can stand to wait three months, but I am going to wait for the reviews of the game.
9096590	9100914	I think that's pretty bold of Blizzard to say, nah, we're not going to send out our game for review.
9101454	9102155	It'll sell without it.
9102935	9116708	I'm a little confused because I know that a lot of the major review sites get their copy two weeks early but they're just not allowed to publish the story until release date in which case all the sites try to scoop each other so does this mean that they're not getting the game at all?
9117228	9121452	I don't know, they're not really saying for sure but they can't play it even if they have it, they can't play it
9122338	9145085	well and a lot of times they get into some really shady shit with those embargoes too because a lot of times you can break the embargo if you gave the game a 90% or better like that shit really happens out there and it's kind of sick like and that's why you know we're here about really supporting the independent media because we don't have to really play by those rules granted we don't get the early copies of the games because of it
9145465	9174706	but you know just keep in mind if this site got a world exclusive review and is like the first to run with it if that review is an A or something of the equivalent question it you should question it because they could very well be doing it especially if it's a no name site trying to get the additional traffic they could be doing it just to get the traffic kind of sad Toagak in our chat room says code your damn games on time or admit failure damn these day one patches
9177139	9182344	I don't think the game is going to be terrible, but it's going to be interesting to see if the servers can handle it day one.
9183786	9184827	It's going to be a big demand.
9185568	9186248	Big, big demand.
9187069	9189672	The internet will come to a screeching halt this week.
9190905	9191365	Chaos.
9192386	9192626	Alright.
9193286	9199349	Let's open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9199389	9200230	That's all one word.
9201170	9209414	Please, if you're using Skype for the first time, make sure you give Echo123 a call on Skype or I think they actually build it in there now.
9209474	9217318	It's like make a test call and you can easily hear if your sound settings are okay because when we pick up and no one's there, it's a little bit frustrating.
9217339	9217579	Alright.
9218439	9222522	Alright, while we wait for some calls to come in, do we have any last minute stories in the house?
9223262	9223923	I do not.
9224443	9224703	Loki?
9225604	9227445	I do, but I'll have to look them up.
9228166	9230007	I thought you had some ready to go.
9230107	9231228	You're too busy shopping.
9231588	9232409	I am shopping.
9232589	9234190	Well, luckily we're getting a call.
9234230	9235991	You're being saved by a phone call.
9236452	9237672	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9237692	9238073	Who's this?
9239192	9240553	Hey, it's Ranma, everyone.
9240853	9243634	Hey, Ranma, you're the master of zerg rushing our phones.
9243714	9244074	What's up?
9245375	9249337	I'm not the master, I just got lucky.
9249597	9252758	Just two things I wanted to tell you, so I'll be on my merry little way.
9252919	9253279	What's up?
9253419	9260562	The first thing I want to bring up is what you said about the guy that was online for 72 hours for StarCraft II.
9260922	9262103	He's standing in line, yes.
9263792	9267074	I just want you to know that I was on the line for the week.
9267254	9269455	I was out there for about a day and a half.
9269895	9270776	There were people out there.
9270996	9273157	My older brother was out there.
9273437	9276498	No, my younger brother was out there since Thursday for a week, okay?
9276919	9277199	Wow.
9277479	9279420	By the way, don't adjust your sound.
9279500	9280661	Ranma is cutting in and out.
9280681	9281401	We're not sure why.
9281441	9288444	I don't know if it's your speakers or... It might be my end, so I'll make this quick and just get going.
9288504	9289245	Porn Torrents.
9289345	9290025	Okay, go ahead.
9291246	9292747	I'm not running any Porn Torrents.
9292767	9293347	I'm not Loki.
9294037	9298944	I don't torrent my porn, I download it off Houston, okay?
9299385	9303450	Anyway, Ranma, yes, you were in line just as long, okay, I get it.
9303830	9306134	But you're also Black Luigi, you have to be out there.
9306174	9308517	I mean, like, it's not a Nintendo party without Black Luigi.
9310148	9315171	I suppose so, but I'm just saying you can't call out for something like that because we've all done this.
9315231	9317873	I mean, you guys didn't get on the line for the week.
9317893	9321095	You were out there interviewing people, handing out food and stuff, you know?
9321316	9325398	Because it was total promotion for our show because, you know, we can't afford million-dollar ads.
9325759	9326719	No, I mean, we got into it.
9326819	9328060	Extrofer waited in the line.
9330382	9332023	I waited in line over the week.
9332103	9333744	Keep in mind, too, this is important.
9334445	9337327	If we hadn't waited in line, we wouldn't have got one.
9338007	9341009	There's going to be plenty of StarCraft 2 available day one.
9341089	9343110	It's not going to sell out like crazy.
9343170	9344210	You're going to be able to find it.
9344891	9348753	But, you know, software is a lot easier to make than hardware, right?
9351374	9352194	True, true.
9352575	9356437	But still, I'm just saying you shouldn't give him a hard time.
9357617	9359718	I'm not giving him that hard a time.
9359798	9363300	I'm just putting that in the same category as waiting for Twilight.
9363400	9364401	That's okay.
9364421	9364601	That's...
9369648	9371492	I guess.
9371773	9375281	Alright, well what else is on your mind before we let you go, Ranma?
9377558	9383741	Earlier in the show about the law that California is trying to pass to the other states that are jumping on the wagon.
9384562	9386763	Passes is not going to do a lick of damage.
9387283	9399789	I've seen plenty of time at Best Buy, people at 17 buying the Emerald Games, it pops up on the register, check your ID, they just hit the keyboard, enter the bypass, and keep going.
9400410	9404872	Yeah, but now it's going to be illegal, and those people could be personally responsible if they do that.
9404972	9407073	So that behavior might change pretty soon.
9409580	9410140	It depends.
9410201	9418927	I mean, I don't think it's going to change unless it's in the ruling that if a store is caught doing it, that store is going to get fined for it.
9419027	9419747	You know what I'm saying?
9419787	9420888	Let's try this way.
9421108	9422569	I bet you can agree with this, Ranma.
9423029	9428373	If a 16-year-old wants to get a dirty game, that 16-year-old will get the dirty game.
9428633	9429334	Lobby damned.
9431127	9433227	Amiga777 in our chatroom is asking, what's Black Luigi?
9433247	9436268	That's what we call Rama, because he's black and he cosplays as Luigi.
9455888	9460552	and he always seems to get on camera whenever, you know, he's at one of these Nintendo events.
9460592	9463135	Like, wasn't he on CNN or something for the Wii event?
9463175	9463515	I don't know.
9463955	9465677	But, yeah, he's Black Luigi.
9466438	9466718	All right.
9467338	9469581	Let's take some more calls.
9469601	9473124	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9473464	9475546	Did you get some time to round up some stories, Loki?
9475806	9476106	Yeah.
9476267	9477968	Well, too bad because we got another call coming in.
9477988	9479249	Well, I didn't want to say it.
9479269	9479970	Well, all right then.
9480290	9481431	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9481451	9481852	Who's this?
9483491	9485192	This is Misty.
9485333	9490336	I'm doing pretty good.
9490777	9498202	I was thinking back to around the beginning of the show where you were basically like, we've had a shit ton of guests lately.
9498522	9499323	Yes, we have.
9499503	9505368	I thought I'd like to confirm one that's going to be on the show on August 8th.
9506048	9506749	Who would that be?
9508310	9509110	That would be me.
9509531	9510872	Oh, you're coming back, huh?
9512552	9514895	I decided to suck it up and fly
9528772	9530553	No, I'm just... I'm messing around.
9530593	9531134	It'll be okay.
9531995	9532755	Well, that's great.
9532835	9538700	Now, I got to ask this question because I don't know if we talked about it last time you were here, but you do not like to fly.
9539100	9544985	And last time you came out here, you took Greyhound out here and a little bit of the train too, I think.
9545305	9546206	What are you doing this time?
9546246	9546446	Are you...
9547267	9550629	Not the train last time, just the bus I've gotten a new phone since I've been out there and it's a twitchy little touchscreen once in a while
9567659	9568840	For English, press 1.
9570081	9572342	Para Español, marque numero 2.
9574084	9576205	So what are you doing this time?
9576225	9577726	Are you doing the Greyhound thing again?
9579848	9583811	What I'm doing to get out there is I'm flying southwest from St.
9583851	9587893	Louis to L.A., taking Amtrak overnight from L.A.
9587933	9588634	to Sacramento.
9589094	9591276	Then on the way back home, I'm taking the bus.
9591803	9592784	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9617265	9627110	And again, I'm not your doctor, so you might want to ask somebody, because I don't know what other medications you take, and I'd hate to have you mix.
9627410	9637115	I don't know what else you take, and Tylenol may not mix, but just take a sleep aid that's approved by your doctor, and that might help with the anxiety.
9639136	9640817	because I've had friends that have to do that.
9640857	9647960	They get really anxious, especially if there's going to be turbulence or anything, which flying to LA, I think you get to dodge the Rockies a little bit.
9647980	9651942	I don't think you'll fly right over them, and that's where the worst turbulence is, but it'll be fine.
9652002	9652902	I fly all the time.
9652942	9653402	It's fine.
9653922	9654803	In fact, you know what?
9655283	9666308	You probably saw on the news, not that far here from Sacramento, there was a horrible Greyhound bus accident, and I would have been extremely sad if Misty had been on that bus, so I think you'll be all right with flying.
9667268	9673590	I didn't read that yet, but keep in mind my computer's not unlimited to doing shit on my iPod right now.
9675090	9678071	Well, you're going to be just fine with that.
9678411	9680332	I do not drink and you know that.
9681552	9685593	Alright, I'll let you go so you can go beat up some chatters with your fist.
9686693	9688514	And you can yell at them in person when you're here in a couple weeks.
9688774	9689314	So we'll see you then.
9691483	9701571	Alright, take care Misty's gonna be on the show She will be on my couch I had to make sure that I was actually gonna be here Because I was worried for a minute that she was only here for the weekend What's that?
9701892	9716344	She's gonna be on the 8th, I think that's the night after Showgirls It is the night after Showgirls But I'll be back in town on the 8th So I'll be here, she's here during the week I guess So we'll have to all get Indian food or something I don't know What are we gonna do with Misty?
9716365	9717886	What are you gonna do with Misty for like 4 days?
9719469	9725332	I was thinking going to Dave and Buster's and going to Arviggle.
9726033	9727413	Let's throw in a dumpster.
9727654	9731316	And going by the little ghetto arcade over there where the Parapara is.
9731376	9731856	It'll be fun.
9731896	9733437	Because she really wants to play Parapara.
9733657	9734137	It'll be fun.
9734657	9735478	Let's go to another call.
9735518	9737399	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9737759	9739940	For English, press 1.
9740140	9741501	No, I'm kidding.
9741541	9742001	Hi, who's this?
9744083	9744923	Hey, this is X-Link.
9745043	9745684	Hi, X-Link.
9745704	9746244	What's on your mind?
9747062	9748604	Hey, actually, I want to call back up your things.
9748644	9750147	First off, about the law.
9750307	9755815	I live here in Florida, which is probably supposedly be one of the states, which I really don't think it's going to pass, personally.
9755955	9762465	Like Ranma said, I really think it's going to go through a lot of loopholes before anything gets passed through a lot of these different states.
9763526	9769973	A lot of the companies too, I'm noticing now, are trying to do things so they won't get in trouble.
9770234	9772056	God forbid something like this would pass.
9773477	9777802	Recently, I bought a computer game from Target, the F.A.W.
9777842	9780645	Collection, and I was surprised that I got ID'd for it.
9782799	9790264	Which took me by surprise because that's the first time ever buying a game from say like Target or someplace like that where I actually got carded for the game for being mature.
9791065	9793806	So it was very shocking to say the least.
9793926	9799490	But it was very cool though because at least it shows that they're trying to take the appropriate steps to make sure something like this happens.
9799510	9801792	But I agree with you, there is a valid point.
9802432	9804494	X-Link, how do you have time to play Fallout?
9804514	9808278	You play just as much WoW as I do, and I don't have time for other video games.
9808578	9809039	How do you do it?
9824884	9825224	Oh my god.
9825305	9825865	That's terrible.
9843411	9843931	Oh, man.
9844151	9848012	Well, sorry to hear it, but I'm glad you're building the collection.
9848032	9849152	It's Saga Frontier I liked.
9849232	9851153	I can't believe you're sitting there bashing it.
9851253	9856934	It was actually, it wasn't great, it wasn't the best, but the storyline was alright.
9857034	9859435	And besides, you can play as somebody going around getting drunk.
9859475	9862015	I love how you're lowering the bar as you're reviewing it.
9862055	9863356	Well, wasn't that good?
9863456	9867977	Wasn't that, you know, there's always one at every party.
9870611	9871112	It's all good.
9871752	9872592	I won't judge you for it.
9874654	9874974	Alright.
9876235	9876735	Is that it?
9877075	9878016	You got something else?
9878816	9879597	That's pretty much about it.
9879737	9881998	Alright, well thank you as always, X-Link.
9882098	9882859	You have a wonderful week.
9883479	9884079	Always, you too.
9884119	9885420	We'll try to farm Kara tonight, okay?
9886381	9887261	Oh, sounds like fun.
9887341	9887782	Tell the guild.
9887942	9888162	Bye.
9888622	9889202	Yes, bye-bye.
9891605	9893847	Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
9893887	9897929	Thank you guys so much for your phone calls here at Orange Lounge Radio.
9897949	9898509	We appreciate it.
9898549	9905894	If you didn't get through, why don't you leave us a voicemail on the Skype line, or of course you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
9906154	9908876	There's Twitters, there's lots of ways to get through to the show.
9909296	9910316	So that's it, we're going to wrap up.
9910396	9911477	No last minute stories, right?
9911777	9912298	No, I'm just kidding.
9912578	9914499	What does Loki got for last minute stories?
9914999	9919625	Dead Rising 2K0 will be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade August 31st.
9920106	9926734	Of course it will be kind of a prequel or in between sequel for the Dead Rising series.
9926814	9928817	It takes place between Dead Rising 1 and 2.
9930398	9956413	and also you'll be able to kind of level up your character and stuff that you earn in that game will also transfer over to Dead Rising 2 the best thing about it though it will only cost you $5 so that is awesome for what may be considered I haven't seen anything on arcade for $5 in a long time exactly
9959537	9963679	Let's see, Netflix is apparently going discless by October.
9964159	9965340	So they're going to eventually have an app.
9965720	9972804	Or you may say that's probably when the exclusivity contract ran out for having the in-dash stuff.
9974344	9976625	Rockman 3's got some more tracks announced for it.
9978066	9980507	Everybody Wants to Rule the World by Tears for Fears.
9981428	9982749	Rock Lobster by the B-52s.
9984129	9984489	Awesome.
9984669	9993354	Foolin' by Def Leppard, Beautiful People by Marilyn Manson, Hey Man, Nice Shot by Filter, Cold as Ice by Foreigner.
9993574	9995955	And then also Dance Central has three songs announced for it.
9996475	10002999	Drop It Like It's Hot by Snoop Dogg, Push It by Salt-N-Pepa, and Bust a Move by Young MC.
10005520	10006040	That's it.
10006200	10008321	Do you think Rock Lobster might sound something like this?
10008361	10009142	Wait one, sit down.
10009742	10013344	I want to sing a little song that kept me going when I had troubles.
10019312	10020312	We were at the beach.
10021953	10024293	Everybody had matching towels.
10024513	10028955	Somebody went under a duck and there they saw a rock.
10029655	10030915	But it wasn't a rock.
10032536	10034896	It was a rock lobster!
10035616	10038657	That's what it's going to sound like in my house.
10039938	10040878	Rock lobster!
10041178	10041798	Rock lobster!
10041818	10044879	Alright, I'm over it.
10046184	10049606	Alright, well if that's going to do it for Last Minute Stories tonight, then let's go around.
10051426	10052827	No, no bird is the word.
10052847	10054067	I'm not going there again.
10056168	10057809	But surely you've heard.
10059950	10062271	I already put that in as a cage match, okay?
10064924	10067147	I almost want to play it, but I'm not going to, I promise.
10067207	10069389	All right, quick, let's end the show before I play it.
10069770	10075496	We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts, but not before I thank Salacious Pop for joining us tonight here in studio.
10075517	10076337	I hope you had a fun time.
10076558	10079241	I did, as always.
10079281	10081624	Sometimes you listen, and you comment in chat, and sometimes you're here.
10081684	10083346	How is the show different between the two?
10085463	10087585	I don't know.
10087645	10089487	Behind the scenes is just a different perspective.
10091128	10093830	I'm a lot less nervous this time than I was the first two times.
10093870	10095051	This is my third time on the show.
10095952	10096472	You do well.
10097453	10099475	The thing is, he's really funny, you guys.
10099495	10100996	He makes a lot of really funny chat comments.
10101016	10101817	That's why I read him.
10101837	10108382	I'm not doing like, he gets more chat comments in because he's my boyfriend or whatever, but he actually says a lot of funny stuff.
10109783	10111625	So we like getting more of that funny stuff here on the show.
10112385	10112685	Thank you.
10112845	10117448	Go home and write some jokes and we're going to do like a last comic standing with you and Drew Nami, okay?
10117488	10122532	I think I got an idea for my next little animated movie from this episode.
10123092	10123472	Did you?
10123692	10124233	Yeah.
10124293	10127194	I did the really sort of foul World of Warcraft one.
10127234	10127715	It was awesome.
10127755	10128115	So yeah.
10128435	10128916	It was awesome.
10129116	10129816	So I'm going to work on that.
10129836	10130817	That sounds like fun.
10131557	10134519	I'm a little worried as to what that's going to sound like, but we'll see.
10135179	10137840	Alright, do you have a final thought for us tonight?
10138400	10143263	Video games are not the same as tobacco and alcohol, so that law is stupid.
10143723	10145544	And it's no on that law.
10146404	10147145	No on that law.
10147185	10147805	Thumbs down.
10147945	10149106	Too bad we don't get to vote on it.
10149226	10149666	F minus.
10150006	10151006	Dislike this post.
10151126	10151347	Yes.
10153107	10154328	Loki, your final thought tonight?
10154428	10158370	That law sucks, but I don't care because I'm over 18, so suck it, children.
10161544	10190301	my final thought tonight is congratulations to Extifer's sister Annie and her husband Jim who had their baby this week Oliver James last name Hill congratulations baby yay baby but can you imagine like I know Extifer hasn't been on the show in a very long time and I hope to change that but for those that have listened to OLR for a very long time can you imagine if Extifer was your gay uncle like I'm just saying DarkSakura your final thought tonight
10190869	10190989	Ow.
10192290	10192630	That's it?
10192850	10192970	Ow?
10193310	10193490	Ow.
10193871	10195031	Reject false ows.
10195892	10196112	Ow.
10196692	10198213	That and I want a sewing machine.
10198933	10199653	You know what I want?
10200234	10200634	Yogurt.
10201249	10202049	Oh my god, Rob.
10202229	10203390	I want some frozen yogurt.
10203490	10204230	I don't have to work tomorrow.
10204250	10204750	I'm just saying.
10204950	10205490	You don't?
10205810	10206231	No, I don't.
10207191	10208011	Let's hang out tomorrow.
10208511	10210532	You know, I have to get car errands done.
10210552	10211412	That's why I took the day off.
10211872	10214593	So I can't hang out during the day, but maybe in the evening.
10215213	10218654	Real quick, even though it's not the segment for it.
10219155	10222296	I'd like to give an F you to 7sins.com.
10222336	10223316	It's a modding forum.
10223656	10226577	You have the worst server on the face of the earth.
10228416	10229558	Worst server ever.
10230018	10235846	It seriously times out and cannot connect more than any other site on the internet.
10238683	10239503	Alright, that's it.
