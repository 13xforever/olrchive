98640	103880	congratulations because my hand still has a hole in it there's a part that the
103880	107840	stitches didn't clear up all the way so I put pictures on Facebook to show my
107840	113200	mommy which is why I put them on Facebook is to show my mommy and I'm
113200	117920	still quite bandaged up although not to the extent I was last time and it hurts
117920	122280	as Rob it hurts us have you been able to play any video games at least um yes
122280	126080	which we will get to in my gaming week yes which we'll get to in just a minute
126080	129240	but I couldn't start the show without introducing the one and only tech master
129240	133640	Loki you could it just wouldn't be as good probably not but don't let your ego
133640	135880	get too big how you doing Loki I'm doing fine
135880	141240	what's new in Loki's world you guys finished the nursery right or you're
141240	145680	really close it's he's been inhaling a lot of paint fumes we have just very few
145680	150240	things left to do on it it's it's pretty much done it's just like the finishing
150240	154840	touches I guess we have to like shade the hills or put a little highlight on
154840	161080	them which site to mix some paint with this like blending medium stuff to make
161080	169080	it very transparent and then I have to paint one more hill and just like some
169080	172920	small stuff but it's basically done I would have taken more pictures but now
172920	175920	they said that you know I shouldn't take any more pictures until it's done
175920	180440	because it ruins the Wow effect all right well we'll be waiting to be wowed
180440	185840	it won't be as much of an epic mount all right let's also introduce we do have a
185840	188460	special guest here in studio we've been having a lot of extra people in studio
188460	191080	lately that's a good thing we like I'm having another person here to kind of
191080	195060	mix things up a little bit tonight is somebody you've heard over the past few
195060	199800	episodes say hello to salacious pop hello how are you I'm great can we even
199800	203880	hear you tonight I don't know if we're are we hearing test all right yeah we're
203880	206320	hearing you it's just kind of quiet I don't know don't be afraid don't be
206320	210840	afraid just treat that microphone like it's ice cream all right there you go so
210840	215720	what's new in your world how you doing not much yeah got some new games for my
215720	220480	birthday that I'll be talking about okay sounds good so we'll get to those in a
220480	224760	little bit and for those that may not know you have the unique distinction of
224760	227840	also being my boyfriend yes to which I'm sure a lot of the listeners are like oh
227840	232400	that poor guy but yeah so we went we went out last night actually we went to
232400	238040	see I'm Adam Lambert in concert yes we did speaking of of gays Wow yeah right
238040	242400	no here's no I mean is he any good cuz like I just remember like I hope he
242400	246400	wins cuz I don't like the other person and then he lost well here's the thing
246400	251680	it was my mom's idea okay my mom I'm not surprised my mom is the one that wanted
251680	255400	to go and she bought the tickets but then she pulled out and decided not to
255400	258480	go because her knees been bothering her lately and she was really scared about
258480	262480	walking up and down the stairs and everything and I kind of feel bad but
262480	265160	that's just the kind of person my mom is when she kind of makes her mind up there
265160	270040	ain't no change in it so we went instead with some other friends and you know I
270040	274280	don't know I I thought it was fine but it was weird that people were getting
274280	278400	into a fight I don't know what'd you think of the concert I'm not really into
278400	282260	American Idol at all and when Adam Lambert was getting hyped up I was like
282260	285880	okay I get it but I just wasn't really a fan like I'm not really that into his
285880	289920	music but he has a great voice and he put on a great show I like him more now
289920	293400	having seen him live than I did from just watching him on TV I want his hair
293400	299040	I'd say won me over his wig I'm sure I can't be real that his do can't be real
299040	301680	tell us tell tell the listeners real quick about the fight we will get to
301680	306120	video games I promise so we were up in the bleachers way in the back and about
306120	311720	three rows in front of us off to the left a fight well not a real fight but
311720	315440	um these ladies were dancing and standing up and having a good time
315440	320920	Lamas yeah glamos we're standing up dancing as one would at a rock concert
320920	326360	and this sort of drunk resentful husband who was probably dragged there by his
326360	329880	wife really took offense to the fact that they were standing and he decided
329880	332960	to call them out and get really belligerent cuz you need to know the
332960	336800	crowd was totally like the Real Housewives of Sacramento County I mean
336800	341040	Deena Lohan's all over wherever you look yeah I think on the Venn diagram of
341040	344840	shame there's definitely some overlap between Adam Lambert fans and like
344840	351640	twi-moms I think there are a lot of yeah yeah quite a bit so we got to watch
351640	356680	security come in and yes security had gave them a stern talking to put it so
356680	359880	there was a point where I was like am I serious because I've gone to a lot of
359880	363960	concerts before and I've never seen a fight so it's like am I really gonna see
363960	368720	people throw down at Adam Lambert like is this is this real life yeah it's
368720	371480	pretty pretty surreal well here's the other thing that you need to know about
371480	376040	the concert it was that a Indian casino which we have quite a few of those here
376040	379840	in California so it's you know obviously it's on Native American land and they
379840	384400	can have gambling and smoking and and all that good stuff so we actually went
384400	389800	into casino after the show and I'm kind of shocked at how much the worlds of
389800	393960	gaming and gambling are starting to fuse closer together you may not be aware of
393960	397160	this but a lot of gaming companies are also in the business of making like
397160	400560	gambling devices like Konami is one of the big ones actually they're probably
400560	404400	making more money right now on some of their gambling machines and one of the
404400	409600	machines that we saw in there was this gigantic wheel of fortune slot machine
409600	412800	and it's not like I mean there's been wheel of fortune slot machine for years
412800	417600	but there's a huge mungus wall-sized one yes yeah it looks like Derby owners Club
417600	421560	to me like remember I thought you were talking about like the five cent of the
421560	425240	nickel slots where they had like there's that too but now there's one with a
425240	429600	giant monitor and I guess the bonus round on that one you touch letters to
429600	432840	complete the puzzle on the giant board and it's multiple players doing it at
432840	436760	once it's weird and they have Vanna White like the real Vanna White doing
436760	440240	record like she's the bumpers between rounds like good luck everybody and it's
440240	444720	really her in HD it's very creepy but what's also creepy like isn't she like
444720	448320	80 years old and she still looks like she's like 30 like she's made a pact
448320	454240	with the devil clearly plastic surgery she's just using what you know what some
454240	459040	of that stuff different cosmetics from Umbrella corporation you know to keep
459040	463480	her cells nice and rejuvenated well you've seen that movie death becomes her
463480	469680	she made a porcelain Wow she's ceramic I did I did have to talk to one lady
469680	472680	though in the casino because she had her sign with her that said I'm 70 and I
472680	476960	love Adam because she reminded me of my mom because my mom's also just about 70
476960	481960	she's 69 anyway okay enough Adam I swear that is like the most Adam Lambert chat
481960	485840	you'll ever hear on orange lounge radio I apologize but we do talk about video
485840	488200	games we're gonna get into those in just a minute I had to go to our chat room

535600	539900	let's talk about gaming weeks let's get less Adam more video games dark soccer
539900	544940	how was your gaming week mine was fairly epic Rob I did lots of gaming actually
544940	550880	such for being an invalid such as Dan and I took the last of our our spare
550880	556100	money now we're dirt broke waiting on our government checks to arrive he's on
556100	561800	unemployment I'm on disability okay we went to Dave and Buster's it's small oh
561800	567200	the new one here in Roseville it's tiny and loud oh my god loud and but we
567200	578520	played wait your mic is totally cut out you got to check the the connection is
578520	587040	wrong sorry guys live radio Jamie's mic is doing weird stuff go ahead no you're
587040	593120	still out I don't know what I pushed I pushed it in Rob I don't know what's
593120	599040	going on anyway so it played this tank game that Namco put out I don't remember
599040	603320	what's called it was pretty fun I played a lot of games to try to win a blender
603320	610200	because I really need a new blender apparently um and we did this typhoon
610200	616360	thing which is more like a ride and they had a they do like a minecart one no you
616360	619840	your mic you get can you guys switch okay I don't know what's going on with
619840	624520	my hey is this well I'm yeah it's much better all right go ahead anyway so we
624520	628000	played the tank game that Namco did we played this typhoon thing which is like
628000	634560	a bunch of different rides all in one and we did a pinball one which was kind
634560	637200	of throws you around a pinball game it was pretty cool because of course we had
637200	649360	to do pinball and then we I played more more token stuff and then I started
649360	654760	playing Ragnarok online again which because it's easier to do with my hand
654760	659560	being kind of messed up but I did play some Star Trek online and I'm at captain
659560	664520	eight now what exactly does captain eight mean it means that I've got two
664520	670360	more levels until I'm rear Admiral pretty much so those like levels in
670360	675200	other MMOs okay okay cuz like you start off because you know they're set up like
675200	678960	a military organization they go by rank and then you've got divisions in each
678960	684680	rank so so I'm getting up there actually I found out that while a lot of the
684680	690240	earlier missions are lame the upper captain level and Admiral level missions
690240	695040	are really freaking fun so I've been having a good time it's especially funny
695040	700280	watching although I have I've had such a hard time playing when I've just taken
700280	704580	my Vicodin because then I can't I totally focus on one thing when I'm on
704580	710880	Vicodin it's like I have instead of a DD I have like hyper focus disorder or
710880	715260	something and get fixated on one major thing at a time so it's really kind of
715260	720840	hard to multitask hence me looking at all these pictures during the show and
720840	726360	not being able to look away from them I don't know what you're talking about
726360	737200	dork anyway and I did other games what did I do oh yeah I started this what's
737200	743880	that professor top hat game professor Layton no not professor Layton it's like
743880	751200	a combination of platformer and puzzle game and it's this guy I'm gonna hold on
751200	759080	a second is that the new one on Steam no no no no it's a gameplay game and you'd
759080	763560	like have to find the golden suit is this really bizarre little game that
763560	768780	it's it's also it's awfully cutesy and I was surprised that Dan suggested it to
768780	772500	me to play but it's really it's really fun I've been playing a little bit of
772500	777320	that and some trying to go back and play Oh end on except I'm right-handed my
777320	782520	stitches are on my right hand so well my incision is on my right hand so I can't
782520	787960	play a wind on very well especially again when I'm on Vicodin so I gotta
787960	791320	tell you guys before the show I said something and Jamie flipped me off and
791320	794080	it actually put her in pain because she's like I haven't flipped anyone off
794080	798840	since I had my surgery Rob's the first person I flipped off and because the
798840	802160	whole thing is that my flexibility is coming back in my hand and I can make a
802160	806480	sword of fist and I can sort of extend it except I can't apparently make a fist
806480	811160	and extend a finger at the same time cuz then it hurts and maybe you want to cry
811160	818880	and I blame Rob because Rob evoked the finger well you wouldn't bet go bake me
818880	824600	a pie that's what I asked bake your own damn pie all right I'm a guacamole though
824600	833840	you have some guacamole I'm I had but I'm full of chips oh what else I don't
833840	838760	remember no I'd be taking effect everybody no I played I played mahjong
838760	846160	before class my netbook and I found that my SNES my next emulator works very well
846160	852080	for Linux on my netbook so I can play Super Nintendo games before class you
852080	854840	should check out the Castlevania puzzle game that just came out on iPhone
854840	857920	because although it looked really weird from the screenshots I've been hearing a
857920	861080	lot of good things about it I just picked it up actually because I had
861080	865560	$40 worth of iTunes credit for my birthday from various gift cards so I
865560	868800	picked it up was like four or five bucks I don't remember and it just kind of
868800	871160	made me think of you because I know you're big Castlevania fangirl you like
871160	875680	puzzle games too I was wanting to play it but I I almost downloaded the Silent
875680	879360	Hill game and no no the Silent Hill games junk it's on my phone if you wanna
879360	882680	play it it's not that great it's like it's like a first-person thing it's it
882680	888000	does it's not like the actual Silent Hill games at all but um and then we've
888000	893360	also been redoing the vault Dan and I and we've decided well I decided this
893360	898040	and he better go along with it or else that we're gonna play play through Sonic
898040	902840	Adventure I like how you have like the dual TVs all set up in there you know
902840	912200	they were huh they were Xbox Oh monitors from kiosk from certain stores kiosks
912200	915880	okay well no and Dan was just told that he could take everything so we've got
915880	920640	like broken Xboxes and broken Wiis and semi working Wiis and a bunch of cables
920640	926320	and those monitors and crap so he's putting them to proper use in the vault
926320	930000	and I'll put up those pictures of the vault in progress all right so in fact
930000	933680	I'll go do that right now I'm gonna find the name of that game because it's gonna
933680	937240	bother the crap out of me until I figure it out all right so when Jamie runs in
937240	941080	here and yells something completely random that's the aim all right Loki how
941080	944840	is your gaming week now you have to stop looking at pictures what are those SD
944840	950520	cards you SD card compact flash cards and yes I am shopping for compact flash
950520	955920	cards for something I'm working on because I can't go without having six
955920	959400	projects at one time although I did cancel one project because I don't
959400	964320	really give a crap about making it you know cardboard arcade cabinet anymore
964320	968720	what project oh the project under 100 hundred dollars name that sounded cool
968720	972120	the other people have already done that they have like one that's actually a
972120	975480	maim system that's under $100 and basically this would be the same thing
975480	981680	just you know the cabinet would you know be kind of free because it'd be made out
981680	986000	of cardboard but I just don't care and I may do it later but you know I know
986000	990880	whatever so I have spare parts at home um no but what I was working on was
990880	995720	actually can't hear you I want to interject what were you interjecting is
995720	1004840	Henry hats worth in the puzzling adventure okay I could told you that so
1004840	1010480	yeah what I'm working on right now my friend gave me one of these old I don't
1010480	1013960	even know what they are they're like remember those tiger electronics games
1013960	1019080	and stuff not necessarily like game and watch but something similar that and
1019080	1024920	it's a Frogger game it's set up inside of what looks like a bar top arcade
1024920	1029720	cabinet except it's just plastic and it's really tiny and I was looking at
1029720	1032960	him like cuz then you know the first thing that comes to my mind for anything
1032960	1037160	it's like I wonder if I could put an arcade game inside this thing and so
1037160	1041560	I've kind of challenged myself to do that for no apparent reason what I've
1041560	1046320	seen that before like the little bit like all the it's like it's kind of like
1046320	1049360	an LED game but it's in color you know it's Frogger I think I've seen one of
1049360	1052080	those before aren't they like all red or all orange or something I know they're
1052080	1055680	well not all of them I've seen ones that are multiple colors they have just like
1055680	1059560	an overlay on them that gives them the colors but yeah it's basically that so
1059560	1064040	what I would be doing is I'd be ripping out the guts of the inside or whatever
1064040	1069080	this thing is I'd actually probably be using the joy stick that's on there not
1069080	1072400	really even replacing any of the buttons but just wiring them up to some sort of
1072400	1077320	like I pack type thing probably a mini pack and then running that through which
1077320	1082360	I just bought because I bid snipe someone and won an auction for a nano
1082360	1087940	ITX PC which they're really small but it's actually a little big for what I
1087940	1092040	need it to be put in so I gotta put the board in an angle and hopefully that
1092040	1096560	fits I'm not sure so that'll be fun otherwise I'll use it for something else
1096560	1104240	but I have a three and a half inch monitor that came from I think it's
1104240	1108880	supposed to use for like backup cameras and cars I got dirt cheap that I'm gonna
1108880	1113240	hook it up through because it just takes a standard video in and I'm gonna hook
1113240	1118320	that up to the PC through that and maybe possibly use that as an actual tiny
1118320	1122760	tiny tiny main cabinet that'd be kind of funny and put on my desk at work I shall
1122760	1127960	call him mini maim mini maim no but actual games I play this week just the
1127960	1132640	same typical stuff I've been playing you know before Grand Theft Auto lots of lost
1132640	1135480	in the dammed because that's what my co-workers want to play now because they
1135480	1140920	think they lose less on that which I've been proving them wrong and although we
1140920	1143560	did play a little bit of Battle of the Gay Tony because there was a few days
1143560	1147300	where it's just myself and my other co-worker and there's just no one
1147300	1152960	online at all playing you know Battle of the Gay Tony not I mean there's more
1152960	1156080	people playing that than lost and dammed but there's really no one playing lost
1156080	1160920	and dammed right now which you know I think this is about the right time to
1160920	1164360	finally get those mods working which I'm hopefully going to start working on some
1164360	1170120	more once I get done painting the baby's room which I'm very close right that
1170120	1173960	baby's gonna get here and all your projects just got canceled no they
1173960	1182840	haven't that's what you think you are wrong sir no I'm just saying project
1182840	1186480	baby is gonna take a lot of time it's not gonna take that much time babies
1186480	1191280	just thank you differ they sleep and they feed them any poke at them that's
1191280	1194640	not gonna last yeah let's what we'll be saving this little clip and playing it
1194640	1198200	for Loki a year after that kids born we'll see what he thinks hey I I'm well
1198200	1201840	aware of what babies do and yeah they they wake you up in the middle night and
1201840	1206360	you're tired okay I get that that does not stop me from say spending a few
1206360	1213040	minutes you know here and there to build crap I don't know I need gamer daddies
1213040	1217120	to email the show to give Loki some advice I just I just want to hear from
1217120	1221840	some gamer daddies that's all all right I'm just saying like I don't need
1221840	1226200	there's two of us we don't need to juggle the baby I mean I will be taking
1226200	1230400	care of the baby but if you juggle the baby CPS might get called they might
1230400	1236200	especially since they can't juggle anything so that's not good now I'm not
1236200	1240880	worried about that stuff I don't think it's really gonna change anything I have
1240880	1245920	done a number of people who said that all right we'll stop taking on Loki go
1245920	1249360	ahead come on I'm just saying that I don't think it will affect anything
1249360	1255040	that's fine I don't need 80,000 projects going on at one time but I will find
1255040	1260000	excuses to do that okay so anyways besides all that stuff and of course
1260000	1264880	more crackdown too I'm not really enjoying this game as much as the first
1264880	1269760	one probably because this game is very similar to the first one which you know
1269760	1276200	wouldn't be so bad but it's just they really kind of took away all the open
1276200	1280240	world part of the game because you know the open world stuff is still there but
1280240	1286840	my god is that my guy who's the voiceover guy is such a nagging bitch
1286840	1292000	it's like you should go to this rooftop race fuck that I will do the rooftop
1292000	1296600	race when I feel like it no you should do it now I will do it later do it now
1296600	1302080	are you trying to piss me off oh god I hated that stop killing them you know
1302080	1309640	you know like I'll like jump down and you know the other not agents but like
1309640	1313080	you know the peacekeepers will be there and they'll get injured or like I'll
1313080	1317000	blow up a car and some shrapnel will hit them though stop injuring the
1317000	1322360	peacekeepers they're hard at work or like don't injure the civilians you know
1322360	1327560	they need to like us my favorite that peacekeeper had a wife and family do you
1327560	1333960	want to explain it to them and it's dumb and even when you do piss them off to
1333960	1337200	come at they send a hit squad after you you just go up on the rooftops and they
1337200	1341360	shoot at the building because they can't figure out how to hit you and and then
1341360	1345400	that goes away and they're all hope you learned your lesson I'm like nope
1345400	1352600	didn't learn my lesson I'm gonna do it again we yeah it's alright it's just
1352600	1358520	maybe the announcers the last boss it's not the last boss and what's retarded is
1358520	1363080	from what I hear the game has the same fucking twist in it as the first one and
1363080	1367080	it's completely obvious from the beginning because obviously if you play
1367080	1370720	the first game you understand what the twist is and right from the get-go they
1370720	1376880	kind of give you the big hint hey hey it's probably the same twist again not
1376880	1381640	that I even care it's just that was just a dumb excuse what about the twist in
1381640	1386160	the original Metal Gear game that the big boss that was talking to you on the
1386160	1390880	you know frequency thingy and he'd like was the announcer ended up being the
1390880	1395920	last boss I think so yeah but I don't think this guy's the last boss he's just
1395920	1400600	it's just that the peacekeepers are evil oh my god you know someone that's helping
1400600	1405040	you know as evil that twist has been done like 80,000 times and you know I
1405040	1408560	know it's a spoiler but hey the original crackdown game has been out for a few
1408560	1417240	years now so too bad whatever it just doesn't it doesn't matter than me but
1417240	1422640	it's still fun you know I like playing it it's just it's very you know the
1422640	1426400	missions that you go on are very linear and granted that the first game the
1426400	1431000	missions weren't that different but they did have some bosses that you fought I
1431000	1434480	mean granted they were very simply just have to run up to them and roundhouse
1434480	1440000	kick them a few times and they're dead but you know at least they had bosses I
1440000	1446320	don't know they they could ramp up the difficulty and stuff they could all
1446320	1450000	right well I guess that's it for Loki's gaming week how about Alan you want to
1450000	1455320	talk about your gaming week absolutely how's my mic doing I think you're okay
1455320	1458040	well kind of a just actually you and Jamie should probably switch back again
1458040	1463920	is I think I fixed hers we'll see I don't know bear with us guys live radio
1463920	1469600	let me just okay well we can hear you now okay all right hi okay so my
1469600	1475240	birthday was a couple weeks ago and I picked up or rather I got Bayonetta so
1475240	1478560	I'm finally playing that I know that came out in January a lot of fun been
1478560	1483000	wanting to play it for a while I'm on the third stage so it's pretty much you
1483000	1488360	know Devil May Cry but with a sexy bitch killing everybody
1488360	1494640	puzzle quest 2 and I played puzzle quest 1 on the DS I probably have about 130
1494640	1498200	hours on my save game so I've been playing the hell out of the second one
1498200	1503680	Wow 130 hours that's a long game yeah I well I pretty much grinded everything to
1503680	1509880	level 99 that was grindable it was very yeah so puzzle quest 2 Wow of course our
1509880	1514000	guild tried to do a trial of the Crusader 10 man it's the hardest rate
1514000	1518400	we've tried and Wow we got about halfway through it before we gave up good
1518400	1526040	progress there and played some left for dead and played some alien swarm what
1526040	1532520	you think alien swarm it's good it's the new four player co-op game that valve
1532520	1536760	put out it is under the valve name it's free so whenever something is not
1536760	1541440	horrible and free it's usually worthy of a little bit of hype the gameplay is
1541440	1548240	basically gauntlet for player top-down massive enemies coming at you and it's
1548240	1552720	so it's gauntlet with crossed with the movie aliens pretty much and there's the
1552720	1558280	medic the tech the sergeant and the special ops and you play online with
1558280	1561760	friends and each each person has a special role and it's a lot of fun I
1561760	1567520	downloaded it oh so we'll have to play you should play with us free yeah you
1567520	1571680	can't argue with free it's two gigs so yeah anything else you gave me a week
1571680	1577600	you want to share with us I think that's all I've played really I played left for
1577600	1580240	dead I'm sure you'll talk about a little bit with you you had never played it
1580240	1585720	before well I had tried it like once a couple years ago but yeah yeah I did
1585720	1591720	load up the team team fortress 2 tutorial so I know that Jamie wanted to
1591720	1597960	play some of that so all right well my gaming week Alan hit on a lot of the
1597960	1600840	same stuff I was playing a lot of these games we were playing together as I was
1600840	1604440	in that Wow raid and all that fun stuff I've been doing more PvP in Wow though
1604440	1609240	I'm one of my characters I'm finally my level 76 bank all warrior I'm finally
1609240	1612060	bringing back to be like a PvP character and I've been having a lot of fun with
1612060	1618120	her she's cool anyway a alien swarm free on steam right now there's really no
1618120	1621880	reason not to get this game it's worth a look it's the time I mean it's not like
1621880	1626320	oh my god like you know like portal awesome or something but it's the type
1626320	1630480	of game you would pay like 10 to 15 dollars for on Xbox Live Arcade it feels
1630480	1635160	a lot like an Xbox Live Arcade game to me but it's not it's a PC game and it's
1635160	1638520	very much I think gauntlet kind of mixed with aliens is good with a little team
1638520	1641520	fortress 2 thrown in there because a lot of the classes kind of seem to come over
1641520	1648100	from that and yeah it's fun and a lot of fun on the multiplayer so check
1648100	1651280	that out I mean there's really no reason not to check out alien swarm unless
1651280	1655880	you're like super anti steam is about the only reason I could think of or your
1655880	1660100	PC really really really blows which might be another reason one thing that I
1660100	1665680	really like about valve is that they will often they're very involved in the
1665680	1670180	mod community for half-life and all that stuff and if you read the info on alien
1670180	1674980	swarm you will read that the developers for it are people from the mod community
1674980	1679760	that valve hired because they like their work so valve actually hires out of you
1679760	1683040	know the the fan the fan service projects that's cool and that's how
1683040	1687880	alien swarm was made is they they hired out of the mod developers all right now
1687880	1691160	some of our chat chatters a chat that orange on twitter.com are joking about
1691160	1695360	free and Yaris amazed that suma says can't argue with free points to Yaris
1695360	1700320	yeah but Yaris was different like I can't explain it like I Yaris really
1700320	1704680	really was I think the commercial tie-in had a lot to do with that like when you
1704680	1708640	pay to have a game made that's basically a giant commercial I think you're kind
1708640	1712560	of set up for disaster a little bit alien swarm is no commercial nothing
1712560	1716360	it's just I honestly I think it's again to try and get steam on more people's
1716360	1720080	computers that's that's really what it boils down to because you know since you
1720080	1723920	launched steam to play the game you're gonna get tempted into these ads where
1723920	1729000	it's you know four dollar sale on you know old game I really want to buy that's
1729000	1732600	that's what it is the same reason why they gave away portal for free why they
1732600	1736680	have these disgustingly low sales is to get steam out there more because the
1736680	1741480	more steam is out there the less other companies will you know that try to take
1741480	1746640	them on will have the chance um other games I played I also played a little
1746640	1750160	bit of team fortress 2 I play more than the tutorial I actually was playing some
1750160	1754080	offline games I'm not ready to fight the people online yet because I'm still
1754080	1758040	scared because I'm not very good at it but I found that I was I was doing okay
1758040	1763160	it's a medic the white mage which I think somebody had suggested in an email
1763160	1766280	last week and it was funny because I said yeah I'll probably do the medic and
1766280	1769640	it's kind of a different role because instead of just running out there like
1769640	1773680	all quake style just running on the front die it's more you know you hang
1773680	1777520	back with your team and actually heal people and you can over heal I kind of
1777520	1780360	liked what they did with it it's it's fun so I'm talking about all these games
1780360	1784480	that are years old because I played Left 4 Dead as well finally got around to
1784480	1788120	playing a little more that Alan and I played a little bit together and that
1788120	1793200	was cool just I don't know I think a lot of you guys have already played it so
1793200	1795960	for me to sit here and describe it after so long it's probably a little
1795960	1799400	ridiculous but I guess if you haven't just kind of imagine a first-person shoe
1799400	1802660	that it takes a little bit of teamwork I mean obviously Left 4 Dead is all
1802660	1805760	about teamwork and it's about the four people you know that are playing
1805760	1809760	although you know you can have everybody else be a computer player but it is a
1809760	1812360	little more fun to play at least with people you know I mean you can go online
1812360	1814880	and play with strangers but it's fun when you play with people you know
1814880	1817720	because then you can kind of you know joke and talk to each other and you know
1817720	1821040	Alan and I kind of you know can communicate really well and say you know
1821040	1824760	he can explain to me you know why we don't run up and say hello to the girl
1824760	1832160	that's crying right shine a light on her wait bad idea no so yeah it's good it's
1832160	1835240	not like Left 4 Dead that was fun who's your favorite character in Left 4
1835240	1837900	Dead somebody asked me down on Twitter this week and I'm like well I've like
1837900	1841360	played it once do you have a favorite character on Left 4 Dead in the first
1841360	1847360	one probably the biker I totally blanking on his name but the the guy at
1847360	1851200	the handlebar mustache and yeah he's funny and the second one probably the
1851200	1856440	redneck because he's so stupid all right very cool as far as other games I played
1856440	1859840	this week Puzzle Quest 2 gosh it's almost the same games as Alan played
1859840	1862680	this week I don't know if there's like anything unique I played that he didn't
1862680	1866280	play kind of sound game room I don't think you really play game room I play a
1866280	1871080	little bit of that another one of my old favorite Activision classics excuse me
1871080	1876280	frostbite is scheduled for release this week that was kind of a frostbite is
1876280	1880540	like kind of like a ghetto Frogger really really ghetto Frogger so I'll be
1880540	1885040	checking that out because I have fond childhood memories of that one um all
1885040	1888120	right that's gonna do it for our gaming week so we're gonna get into the news
1888120	1891240	and everything that's going on in the gaming world but first we're gonna do

1903200	1907680	just fine thank you guys so much olr has really made a charge the past few days

1915600	1919440	has to do with you guys that played super stardust HD this week and again
1919440	1923640	if you haven't heard of the big battle listeners of the shows not necessarily
1923640	1927040	the hosts although I try to participate on at least games I own listeners of the
1927040	1931000	shows play their favorite games against listeners of other shows and it's kind
1931000	1935440	of like a big kind of tournament type of thing high scores and leaderboards and
1935440	1939480	all that I think they're doing one tonight I don't know if maybe it was
1939480	1942800	rescheduled they're doing battlefield bad company was either tonight earlier
1942800	1946520	today sadly that's a game I'll have so I can really follow that one but I tried
1946520	1950440	to get people through the Twitter to sign up but I know that super stardust
1950440	1954880	HD just came to an end and we took first place thanks to our listeners Zoui came
1954880	1958320	in first place with a obscene score of 11 million he was going back and forth
1958320	1962640	with the second place listener from Fantastic Forum on there Riptide did
1962640	1967320	very well there to AZHP made a showing and then we also made a showing on the
1967320	1972120	Forza motorsport 3 competition one of our listeners I think just one charted
1972120	1977120	over there Burr charted for us over there so he came in sixth place but
1977120	1981520	that's certainly better than nothing so a very good job by Burr over there so we
1981520	1985200	really appreciate that some things that are coming up in the near future super

2095280	2100960	a 4 gigabyte internal memory unit kind of like how they were doing with the old
2100960	2107760	arcade systems and so that's kind of neat and then of course you know you can
2107760	2112360	put your own hard drive in there just like you can with the new you know s
2112360	2115600	systems or whatever you want to call them or use the USB because I think a
2115600	2120320	lot of people are now using USB sticks you can also use USB sticks as well on
2120320	2126360	there because there's plenty USB ports on there now and that's kind of cool and
2126360	2132720	yes and then also of course they're gonna be doing a new oh and I'm sorry
2132720	2136160	that will be bundled with connect that $300 one and of course there's also
2136160	2140400	gonna be a new just plain arcade system for $200 that's gonna be coming out in
2140400	2146160	August as well so that's kind of neat that they're gonna be doing that I mean
2146160	2153520	alternatives are wonderful connect is gonna be priced at $150 as if all those
2153520	2160680	retail listings you know we're Microsoft's own website taking pre
2160680	2166040	orders didn't give it away yeah yeah it's such an interesting you know price
2166040	2171280	there didn't didn't call that it does come with a free game which I may have
2171280	2176360	hinted at before the free game is connected ventures kind of like they're
2176360	2181640	a little we play type game so that'll be bundled within of course for 150 bucks
2181640	2188920	and should be coming out well November 4th is that the is connected ventures
2188920	2193040	the one with like the river rafting yes the Pong type game yes Jimmy Fallon that
2193040	2198200	well the Pong type game I think that's in connect sports ok but this had like
2198200	2204680	the like obstacle course thing that they had the river rafting stuff like that so
2204680	2209520	that'd be kind of neat but you know hopefully makes it and we cost average
2209520	2214720	it out makes it a little bit more beneficial I guess so if but if I want
2214720	2218720	this and dance central day one that's gonna cost me what 200 bucks right
2218720	2223280	yes connect games are gonna be $10 cheaper yes I guess only 50 bucks okay
2223280	2228080	so it's gonna be 150 plus 50 plus tax so it's gonna cost me about 220 bucks to
2228080	2232880	get connect to get connected dance central day one yes that's a bit of an
2232880	2238120	investment I don't know do you think um do you think it's a bad idea to price at
2238120	2243200	150 I mean of course we all want it cheaper duh but you know I mean the
2243200	2248400	reality is when you get that third digit in there I mean they cross that kind of
2248400	2252120	sweet spot as a lot of people were saying of $99 getting into that third
2252120	2257200	digits that can ultimately hurt the sales but no game or not I think it may
2257200	2262200	hurt the sales a little bit because it is pretty expensive but I mean they're
2262200	2264840	trying to make it a little better because they're thrown in the game but
2264840	2268400	when you look at it though with the new console and since it's being bundled
2268400	2273640	with the new console then that really brings down the cost of the camera and
2273640	2279880	I guess the software to $100 so I mean are they losing money on the console or
2279880	2287440	they just you know adding some sort of profit margin in there for the actual
2287440	2294040	you know accessory I can tell you right now obviously it may be $150 retail
2294040	2298000	obviously that's not what they're selling them for you know we probably
2298000	2302200	work in about a 20% margin in there because that's usually I think what
2302200	2308240	accessories go for is they have a 20% margin built-in so if you figure that I
2308240	2313240	mean they have to I guess leave room for the retailers to make some money let me
2313240	2317080	do a quick poll in our chat room quick poll will you buy connect and it's buy
2317080	2321160	in game connected ventures this year for a hundred and fifty dollars that's why
2321160	2324920	I want to know a quick poll in our chat room chat orange laundry calm if you
2324920	2327560	want to answer a quick poll I want to see some yeses and nos and maybe some
2327560	2331440	brief reasons why let's go around the room who plans to buy connect and who
2331440	2337680	says it's a waste of your time dark soccer I like lemonade the hell does
2337680	2340880	that mean but you you collect peripherals so are you gonna buy it on
2340880	2344320	that principle or you like no this is one I don't need it depends on what the
2344320	2347440	money's like I mean that's not really always the big thing for us we'll
2347440	2350960	eventually have it I'm sure we eventually get everything so it's kind
2350960	2355200	like your economic situation is gonna be okay well that's fair 150 right now is
2355200	2359520	kind of steep but I've paid more for less okay
2359520	2365320	Alan something interests you no interest at all none none what if they made it
2365320	2370680	$50 would you buy it yeah I consider it then I'm kind of the same boat as Jamie
2370680	2375400	where it's like not to be Debbie Downer but okay you know well no I bet that's
2375400	2379360	a blah blah economy blah blah nine point five percent unemployment rate like I
2379360	2382840	can't get that right now you guys yeah there's a lot of listeners in the same
2382840	2386240	boat as you guys so I think it's a very realistic answer to say that you know
2386240	2390720	because of economic situations $150 too damn much now is not the time to be
2390720	2394120	asking me to buy this stuff and a lot of people actually say that's why you
2394120	2397400	didn't see new systems this year and you're seeing instead upgrades to
2397400	2402220	existing systems because imagine if it wasn't just $150 for connect but you
2402220	2410280	know $400 for Xbox 720 with a motion feature built in for me day one I'm a
2410280	2413800	little bit on the fence right now like I kind of want to do it just because I
2413800	2418680	really want Dance Central and the dance the dance masters or whatever it is
2418680	2422880	Konami is putting out I kind of want to get both of those day one Loki I got a
2422880	2430200	little so it was a couple things yes I will probably pick it up on day one but
2430200	2436040	I don't know and I don't know why I should because really I've been burned
2436040	2440840	by every single camera peripheral that's been put out there ever since the I toy
2440840	2447520	I mean the very beginning so fine I will bite for a fourth time but this will be
2447520	2454200	the last damn time there's something interesting when you mentioned dance
2454200	2460120	masters or whatever the Konami game guess what I saw listing for the other
2460120	2463920	day that I guess like really I'm surprised that's still coming out is
2463920	2467280	this a secret no I don't know if it's a secret I think it may even be a
2467280	2473280	mislisting because I haven't looked at the actual Konami their release list yet
2473280	2479000	but um dance dance revolution is back on the list of games coming out which I
2479000	2483280	thought was interesting that wouldn't surprise me is that the Xbox and ps3
2483280	2487320	one yes I wouldn't surprise me they try to get out by the holiday but it now is
2487320	2491480	really a bad time because you know especially on 360 where it's all about
2491480	2496200	you know now you can dance without the mat it's kind of seems like really bad
2496200	2499920	timing mm-hmm they really should have had that out earlier this year before
2499920	2504000	e3 but I forgot to mention this during my gaming week technically not a game I'm
2504000	2509360	playing but holy shit is it awesome I one of my release lists I saw I mean
2509360	2512520	granted it hasn't been announced yet but I don't give a crap because it's so
2512520	2519360	sweet earth defense force 2017 insect Armageddon yes they are making a sequel
2519360	2525040	to the greatest one of the greatest games on the Xbox 360 in my opinion
2525040	2531920	completely underrated but oh I cannot wait day one purchase for me you know
2531920	2535560	and I saw that on your Twitter I was excited for you let's go back to the
2535560	2539440	results of our quick poll at chat orange on twitter.com will you buy connect and
2539440	2543080	it's buy in game connected ventures this year for $150 here's the results from
2543080	2550920	our listeners nope no yes no yes only if a 360 is in that bundle yes because of
2550920	2555480	fucking dance masters maybe I think that would be a good deal oh that's out with
2555480	2561480	the 360 included 80% chance on not this year and then I don't have a job too so
2561480	2566480	I don't even think about it those are the results see I told you guys here's
2566480	2572280	the thing with the connect to is I like how simple it is basically I buy the
2572280	2576480	system and I'm done I don't have to go oh okay now I gotta go buy all these
2576480	2580760	extra accessories you know to get to work and I know that they've had there's
2580760	2584480	a bunch of those price comparison charts and like feature charts that one was
2584480	2589280	released by Microsoft was released by Sony which were hilarious and not the
2589280	2592760	sound Microsoft centric or anything release their chart kind of seemed a
2592760	2596040	little bit more fair with the comparison and what you have to buy you know to
2596040	2601640	equal out a two-player setup and the cost of that versus you know Sony's
2601640	2607760	saying that oh well our systems in 1080p with blu-ray as opposed to just 1080p
2607760	2613160	or your substandard 1080p because it does not have blu-ray technology our
2613160	2617400	system has buttons on it that is an excellent follow-up question for our
2617400	2620800	Chiron let me ask this quick poll question real quick are you buying
2620800	2624600	PlayStation move this year that's what I want to know how much is PlayStation
2624600	2628880	move again it's it's a PlayStation move is if you buy the bundle it's gonna be
2628880	2635440	$100 and it gets you one of the the move controllers the camera and a game but
2635440	2639080	that does not give you in case you know granted you're gonna say oh well not all
2639080	2643360	the games require you know the navigation controller yes that's also
2643360	2648080	like saying not all the Wii games require the nunchuck but most of them do
2648080	2652360	so you're gonna probably want it so you're going to buy another a nunchuck
2652360	2657080	and to buy another move controller if you want two players and another you
2657080	2660400	know navigation controller nunchuck whatever you want to call it and you
2660400	2665080	know those are expensive like 30 bucks I think for the navigation controller and
2665080	2670840	I want to say like 70 for the actual controller around there I could be
2670840	2674280	wrong on the prices but quickly let me run around the room and see who might
2674280	2680600	buy PlayStation move here Dark Sakura PlayStation move this year um really
2680600	2683600	don't know okay same same kind of answer that's fine
2683600	2687680	Alan I don't have a Wii yet and I think that sort of answers the same question
2687680	2692400	no not at all I'm I'll tell I'm gonna say it pretty strongly here I have no
2692400	2695720	interest in PlayStation move right now there's not a single game that's on it
2695720	2701080	that I'm really interested in you could be you could pay charge me $50 for the
2701080	2704040	whole thing the bundle of the controller everything I still wouldn't buy it it's
2704040	2707200	not to say I'm hateful for everything Sony this year because I really want
2707200	2709840	little big planet 2 and there's some other things that don't involve the move
2709840	2714160	that are very interesting pretty much every game that does interest me that
2714160	2718200	has move support I'm I'll be perfectly content with without move that's my kind
2718200	2721880	of issue whereas with Kinect what are the games that interest me most over
2721880	2726640	there things that you just can't do on a controller period and that you know to
2726640	2730200	for all practical purposes those dance games really haven't been done before in
2730200	2735520	this style Loki PlayStation move absolutely not it looks like crap and I
2735520	2739920	can't believe that they made game I mean just the the whole lineup looks like
2739920	2746200	junk I mean in the fact that the controller is just a total grab at the
2746200	2753240	Wii stuff I mean it's basically a Wii with HD graphics and good power to them
2753240	2757800	I guess for trying to come up with a system the other works for them but I
2757800	2762880	don't play my Wii right now and why am I gonna spend more money for Wii type
2762880	2766720	games and granted I know that the Kinect will have Wii type games because that's
2766720	2770320	what they're gonna put out at launch because that's what they do they try to
2770320	2775440	find something gimmicky but you can't do stuff like dance central or whatever on
2775440	2780720	the Wii you can't do it with the controller setup that you have either
2780720	2784400	you're gonna get things that the closest to that you can get is like a just dance
2784400	2788240	type game and I really don't I'm not interested in something like that
2788240	2791280	dar Tetsuya in our chat room says care to make a wager if they'll sell 1
2791280	2795520	million units of move I'm sure they will at some point because it's gonna be like
2795520	2798680	a new system for them well here's it here's what's interesting you ready to
2798680	2801400	see the results of our quick poll in our chat room chat that orange house radio
2801400	2804680	calm are you buying PlayStation move this year you ready for this thanks to
2804680	2808000	the listeners to chat that orange honestly calm here we go nope I don't
2808000	2812400	think so nope no no I don't even have ps3 as of now
2812400	2817200	hells no hell no no thanks I already have a we only if someone gave me a ps3
2817200	2824240	I don't have a ps3 I really have no need for a ps3 nor do I want one no and brb
2824240	2828280	not a single person in our chat room and please speak up if I missed you said
2828280	2833960	that they're buying it we at least had about two or three saying they were
2833960	2837120	getting connect but not a single person saying they're getting move that could
2837120	2840800	be very interesting not that I want to make bets cuz I don't want to make bets
2840800	2845720	and we're not gonna do this crap I'm just I think move is gonna fail but
2845720	2848720	they're they're gonna be able to sweep it under the rug very easily whereas
2848720	2854840	connect is way riskier and I don't know if that's gonna do well or not like yeah
2854840	2858320	I want one but I kind of have a bad feeling that dance central may be the
2858320	2861800	only game I ever get here's the problem too with the connect is they haven't
2861800	2865680	really shown off any of the hardcore games yet for it it's all been like the
2865680	2869080	casual stuff they I mean granted with the move they showed hey look we can use
2869080	2875360	it in SOCOM 4 and look we can use it in you know kill zone 2 if you want but
2875360	2879860	they ever or kill zone 3 but they haven't really shown off anything like
2879860	2884280	hey look Halo Reach is gonna you know support the move or like you know Gears
2884280	2891000	of War 3 or something like that or not the move they connect so I don't know it
2891000	2896040	it'll be interesting to see what happens but I I do I don't think it's gonna be
2896040	2899840	like oh my god everybody's gonna run out and get these consoles it's just the
2899840	2903960	same reason why even with the Wii and stuff you know the Wii sells well
2903960	2908640	because it's cheap and I guarantee if this stuff starts doing well like the
2908640	2912520	move in the Kinect that that console will drop in price again to the
2912520	2919240	sweet-spot of $99 or even like $120 and it won't matter anymore because people
2919240	2923160	will be snatching that shit up like crazy and seriously when you think about
2923160	2927640	it if that's the kind of gameplay you're into why the fuck should you spend $400
2927640	2932080	on a HD console so the graphics are slightly better remember folks it
2932080	2936480	doesn't matter if the you know graphics are better as long as the game is fun I
2936480	2940680	mean if anything look at some of the stuff that like Capcom has done with
2940680	2945400	like the 8-bit retro games those games are fun because they're fun not because
2945400	2950960	they look pretty and that's the whole point is the games need to be fun a need
2950960	2955680	the focus less on how pretty the games are that will only get you so far it's
2955680	2959840	the fun that keeps people around all right well before I get into the next
2959840	2962640	story I'm sure there's gonna be some even though our chat results came up
2962640	2965520	that nobody was interested in move I'm sure there's some folks listening the
2965520	2969040	podcast because we do reach a pretty big audience of the podcast comparatively
2969040	2971520	there's probably somebody out there that's probably sitting there right now
2971520	2976600	going man these guys just hating on Sony man man man no I'm open to and I really
2976600	2980480	actually want to hear from the people that are gonna buy PlayStation move why
2980480	2983840	are you buying PlayStation move and I'm not asking that in a accusatory I'm just
2983840	2987080	kind of I want to know like what is it that interests you about PlayStation move
2987080	2989960	I told you I'm interested in Dance Central that's kind of why I want to get
2989960	2993840	connect what is it on move that interests you for this holiday season
2993840	2996400	and what's motivating you to go out to get a move I'd love to hear from the
2996400	3000560	listeners mailbag orange on twitter.com I was gonna real quickly show talk about
3000560	3006040	just Microsoft's thing when they put out the cost of the different systems and
3006040	3009840	stuff like that oh did you call this that this is gonna come out a Microsoft
3009840	3013240	will put out a chart that says it like I remember you I don't remember you did
3013240	3017800	you did I know you did but this is assuming that you already own the these
3017800	3022360	consoles or whatever here's what it will cost you to equal up to what I guess
3022360	3028080	them the place not the PlayStation the Kinect can give you so of course of
3028080	3034560	connect only supports two people at least for full body capture whatever so
3034560	3041360	for a hundred fifty dollars you get the connects system now to equal that on the
3041360	3046080	PlayStation side you're in need the hundred-dollar starter kit which gets
3046080	3051120	you the camera and the controller you're in need an additional controller which
3051120	3056500	is another $50 and into navigational controllers which are $30 each total
3056500	3062380	cost $210 now if you compare that with the we all you're gonna really need is
3062380	3066640	another remote which is $40 they're saying that we balance board and this is
3066640	3070800	mainly just so that you can play every single game that's available on the week
3070800	3075200	is with you know the connect you're gonna need you know just that camera to
3075200	3078360	play every single game that's gonna be available for connect and then with the
3078360	3081600	you know the movie or any of those navigation controllers to play every
3081600	3086520	single game on there and then an additional nunchuck so they'll cost $160
3086520	3090240	it's only $10 more than the hundred fifty dollars that's how they're saying
3090240	3096360	that they're a better bargain I guess they're doing some fuzzy math it's some
3096360	3101960	funny because they're also saying if you already have these systems you know it's
3101960	3105720	not including the price price of the systems and then I think it's a little
3105720	3109080	bit shady to to throw in the hundred-dollar balance board seeing
3109080	3112920	saying you need it I get what they're where they're going with it but
3112920	3118200	Microsoft's doing some fuzzy math but that's that's what that's the sales
3118200	3122640	people get paid to do I get you but even like with like the PlayStation chart
3122640	3126480	Sony chart you know what they're talking about the different features and stuff
3126480	3131120	it's just some of the comparisons are ridiculous like for example they have
3131120	3135320	like six different bullet points are that are the camera that you know
3135320	3140160	obviously the the we does not have a camera so all those are no but they're
3140160	3144800	like saying camera yes augmentative reality yes it's basically if you
3144800	3150400	actually look and read all the stuff it's all basically the same as the
3150400	3155880	connect except for you know oh there's no buttons darn you know well what if
3155880	3159480	you don't need buttons on there I know that they were stressing that buttons
3159480	3163580	are really important just like that they were stressing that but or force
3163580	3168020	feedback was an important back when you know they didn't have the licensing for
3168020	3171360	force feedback in the PlayStation 3 controller you know what they should do
3171360	3174520	is they should put out a chart that's a little more honest with the price but
3174520	3178700	they should just say here's what the Xbox will do that the Wii won't do you
3178700	3183720	know the Xbox is in HD the Xbox has access to indie games the Xbox has this
3183720	3189280	library of download content the X-Plays DVDs and don't yes basically you know
3189280	3192840	just be honest yeah it's a little more money but this is what you're getting
3192840	3197560	for all of it you know you it plays DVDs you can do live interactive things like
3197560	3202220	one versus a hundred oh wait no you can't not anymore but you can do
3202220	3206400	Netflix party well I just wondering though the problem I think that they're
3206400	3211980	gonna have with these two new motion systems is that it may be too late you
3211980	3217760	know what I mean it's like the Wii is so inexpensive now and it's only gonna get
3217760	3222380	cheaper you know putting out these additional systems that's basically like
3222380	3228720	saying oh you know you need to buy no system and fuck for $150 why don't you
3228720	3233060	just go buy a Wii I mean cuz you can pretty much do that with that kind of
3233060	3238760	cost so why even bother buying the Kinect when they're just basically saying
3238760	3243840	four hundred dollars I just buy a Wii let me leave leave this story on this
3243840	3246480	comment from our chat room chat dot orange on twitter.com because I think
3246480	3249600	it's interesting frisbee says in response to something Jamie said a
3249600	3256440	minute ago Microsoft does what Nintend should perhaps alright let's move on to
3256440	3260280	our next story and this has to do with stuff going on in the real world that
3260280	3263520	will definitely impact gaming I'm sure you guys have heard about this bill
3263520	3266960	that's gonna go before the Supreme Court and it's a California bill that is
3266960	3272640	basically banning the sale of violent video games to kid to get kid justice
3272640	3277960	one kid actually know the kids and you know it's going to be going before the
3277960	3282040	Supreme Court and because it was overturned by a lower court you know
3282040	3286680	some time ago after it was signed into law well long story short 11 states have
3286680	3291980	now joined in basically saying they support this bill so this is now no
3291980	3296440	longer just a California issue but Connecticut Florida Hawaii Illinois
3296440	3300880	Louisiana Maryland Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Texas and Virginia are now
3300880	3306000	all on this too not to say that if the Supreme Court you know reverses the
3306000	3309400	other decision putting the law into effect not to say that all these states
3309400	3314960	will suddenly also have the law but that should tell you where California goes at
3314960	3320200	least these 11 states are lined up to follow so if you want to have your voice
3320200	3324200	heard you might want to call your congressperson and don't be afraid to do
3324200	3327440	so because that's what they're there for that's what they're paid to do it's also
3327440	3332160	the ECA you can go through the ECA mm-hmm although you know the ECA is a
3332160	3337140	union you can kind of join to support and help fight it but there is nothing
3337140	3340000	quite like contacting your representative directly do you want to
3340000	3347040	say something on this no all right so yeah I definitely would encourage folks
3347040	3352960	to contact people otherwise this is you know and again just to kind of state
3352960	3357520	like you know where the issue is with this is that you know whereas yes kids
3357520	3360300	should not be playing violent video games isn't that really up to the
3360300	3364560	parents to be doing and not really the video game stores and why are video
3364560	3369440	games being held to a different standard than you know movies is it against the
3369440	3374040	law to sell an r-rated movie to a kid like you don't do it like you're not
3374040	3377760	supposed to do it but is it against the law because it's going to be against the
3377760	3383340	law to do video games pretty soon if this happens the last few times I've
3383340	3389760	gone to Best Buy and bought an M rated game from there I've been carded and I
3389760	3394600	know I pretty sure I look over 18 I am over 18 it's no real inconvenience to me
3394600	3399880	but I like I appreciate that they do that and if stores just all adopted that
3399880	3404240	policy I don't really understand why this law is necessary and again it
3404240	3408560	should be you know if parents were doing their due diligence on what their kids
3408560	3412880	were playing and buying or what they bought for their kids it's just it seems
3412880	3417880	really unnecessary J rod in our chat says I don't get why this is an issue
3417880	3421440	children need a parent to get into an r-rated movie or buy a parental advisory
3421440	3425400	music album but is that against the law
3425480	3431280	it's just that same double standard again I actually I somewhat agree with
3431280	3434320	you J rod it's just that you know I think video games are being held to a
3434320	3438360	different standard and that's not very fair because it's just going into that
3438360	3441880	whole stereotype that video games somehow make you a more violent person I
3441880	3446040	just kind of don't like what they're trying to say I don't like what you're
3446040	3450880	trying to say to me all right let's move on with another story dark soccer well
3450880	3455400	this is happier news this actually makes well me in particular very happy we have
3455400	3462240	a couple of games coming out from both Capcom and Namco Bandai Street Fighter
3462240	3467400	cross Tekken and Tekken cross Street Fighter what's the difference huh well
3467400	3473240	Capcom's in charge of the former and that one's gonna be all done in that
3473240	3480800	sort of Street Fighter 4 style that 2.5 D look and of the the Tekken characters
3480800	3485920	will be re-image to fit that same style and a slow screen capture from it with
3485920	3490920	Kazuya and Ryu and it looked really really good the gameplay looks exactly
3490920	3495280	like Street Fighter 4 that will make me intensely happy they have the video of
3495280	3500800	it and of course it's tag team so it's gonna be sweet and that one will have
3500800	3508800	versus training and tag team and it's gonna be a full-on Capcom style now the
3508800	3515440	latter is going to be more of the Tekken style play that has a 3d arenas I don't
3515440	3521560	know if they're gonna be taking the the sort of a Street Fighter EX move list
3521560	3528280	and importing it into Tekken or what or if it's gonna be trying to actually
3528280	3534000	translate the styles of each character into a move list that would fit the way
3534000	3539040	Tekken plays because there's not really any real major projectile moves like
3539040	3544800	that in Tekken except for a couple of interesting moves like and there's the
3544800	3549520	unblockable moves to like Jen's whole electric block thing I think in the
3549520	3553280	later Tekken's the final boss would have a fireball to make them even more
3553280	3558200	cheesier that's right but normally yeah they're regular characters down from
3558200	3565560	what I remember now Tekken was always my big thing especially when Tekken 3 came
3565560	3569800	out I was working in a Namco arcade at the time so of course we had it before
3569800	3573360	everybody else did and I was like ooh I know who that character is coming out
3573360	3578760	you know cuz I was keeping a keeping up with the Japanese character releases at
3578760	3583280	the time we got ours in a different order than they did in Japan hmm yeah
3583280	3587960	Tekken 3 was a huge deal here because it was a launch title with the ps2 yeah so
3587960	3592600	if you're in line at midnight September whatever 2000 for the ps2 you are
3592600	3598460	picking up Tekken 3 SSX big as Tekken Tag Tournament actually yeah Tekken 3 was
3598460	3601640	on the ps1 I'm pretty sure it was with the ps1 in fact they have like a suit
3601640	3605440	up version on the ps2 I think that's what they had yeah but Tekken Tag
3605440	3608520	Tournament was the big thing and actually they fixed a lot of the problems
3608520	3611760	that the Japanese Tekken Tag Tournament had cuz it had this weird thing where
3611760	3616320	the background would almost detach from the foreground and it would really give
3616320	3622720	me a headache after a while playing it but um I've got I imported Tekken 3 when
3622720	3630080	it came out in Japan and actually they they censored the endings between that
3630080	3634520	one in the u.s. one it's pretty funny I kind of wish if Capcom and Namco we're
3634520	3638880	gonna get into bed together again I'll get to that a moment in a moment I kind
3638880	3643280	of wish it was Street Fighter cross Soul Calibur personally cuz I loves me some
3643280	3647240	Soul Calibur but I get it the universe the universe of Tekken and Street
3647240	3650160	Fighter are similar like Soul Calibur would not really fit as well in that
3650160	3654880	universe although Darth Vader and Yoda seemed to do okay yeah well Soul Calibur
3654880	3658600	is taking its own kind of interesting direction you know it's it's kind of
3658600	3662960	shifting in more to the customized character I would love to where's my
3662960	3666880	announcement Soul Calibur 5 because we should be about ready for that don't you
3666880	3670760	think Soul Calibur 4 was a couple years ago I'm just saying now what I really
3670760	3674880	want to see is a Capcom I hope you're listening I want I want to know the
3674880	3679840	rival schools um also let's get into this because it has kind of a funky name
3679840	3683320	and we've heard people say Street Fighter X Tekken because that's what it
3683320	3687000	literally reads like and we've heard like Tekken versus Street Fighter just
3687000	3690440	kind of people replacing it with versus but the name actually comes from a
3690440	3693440	couple years ago and I know we've talked about it on this show is a Japanese game
3693440	3697560	that never came out here there was already a Namco cross Capcom and it was
3697560	3700480	more of like it wasn't more like a strategy game or something just involved
3700480	3703840	the characters in the various universes I think it was is a tactical stretch it
3703840	3706740	was like a tactical game that is why I never bothered with it but it has some
3706740	3710920	sweet music so should be known that this is not the first time that Namco and
3710920	3713800	Capcom have kind of gotten in bed together this is you know kind of a
3713800	3718840	logical type of follow-up so it's a little weird in a way like I don't I'm
3718840	3724840	gonna admit I'm kind of sad that it's not a Capcom SNK part 3 because that's
3724840	3730520	what I would really like to see because I prefer my and you know Andy Bogard and
3730520	3736080	all them from the SNK universe but whatever you know I want them to do I
3736080	3740800	would like to have I mean as much as a Street Fighter and Tekken seems to be
3740800	3745040	such a logical choice for them to do a crossover game with because those are
3745040	3750560	the two biggest franchises of each company I would like I would have
3750560	3755920	preferred to have like a more generic all-out like how Capcom versus SNK was
3755920	3761280	you know where you had like they had the card fighters clash game that was just
3761280	3766840	pretty fun and then you had the fighting game and I like that the company's major
3766840	3771760	artists did each other's art for them you know like the Capcom artist did the
3771760	3776200	SNK artist and vice versa I would like to see because I'd like to have Klonoa
3776200	3780440	in a fighting game that was the joke I was about to make yeah Klonoa versus
3780440	3785880	Akuma well even in the trailer at the very end they show like Megaman chasing
3785880	3789840	a pac-man ghost and then a pac-man chomping after Megaman like it's really
3789840	3794040	weird and then I'm like are they gonna do something with Megaman universe like
3794040	3798600	what the hell are these two companies planning like what is this weird like
3798600	3803320	somebody is sleeping with somebody at the other company like seriously because
3803320	3807160	like now what's gonna happen next kadamari damashi meets Resident Evil I
3807160	3813400	mean you've made the zombie moon I should know that's how you make Pluto
3813400	3817160	cuz Pluto is the dead planet we should do that as a listless some week you know
3817160	3824480	the Namco cross Capcom series we'd like to see happen next that would just be
3824480	3829760	all kinds of wrong but this is interesting is Capcom's got a lot of
3829760	3832960	fighting games coming out because they've got this they've got Marvel
3832960	3838240	versus Capcom still happening well it's all these like X versus Y Marvel versus
3838240	3844960	Capcom 3 out there 3 was using my right hand but which I'm still majorly looking
3844960	3850120	forward to cuz dude my team of Deadpool and Dante all as she 100 Matt in our
3850120	3857760	chat room at chat.com is a nap calm that's when you read too fast I like
3857760	3863920	that name nap calm damn co cross Capcom was a massive financial failure I didn't
3863920	3867200	realize that but that might explain why it never came out to the u.s. I'm looking
3867200	3871520	at the Wikipedia article that we got linked here and trying to see what's
3871520	3876640	going on he out was a tactical game I'm trying to see how it was received oh
3876640	3880360	there's a lot of characters in the different games there reception it got a
3880360	3885720	28 out of 40 in Famitsu it was the top-selling game the week of release it
3885720	3891000	sold approximately 131,000 copies in its first six months of release and then it
3891000	3896160	got re-released as a PlayStation to the best I don't sound terrible maybe it
3896160	3900960	wasn't like oh my gosh blow your hair back but it sounds like it okay rating
3900960	3907440	coming from Famitsu you know how strict they are on the ratings haven't they
3907440	3912200	given like only five games a ten more like twelve and in ten dogs was one of
3912200	3916960	them just saying ten dogs is great for about five minutes which is how long
3916960	3921240	they must have played it for but usually yeah they've they've got some pretty
3921240	3926400	strict standards but they've had their moments of weakness that's for sure well
3926400	3930440	I don't know about you guys but I'm looking for this I I I played Tekken 1
3930440	3934960	2 3 like I had all those games the PlayStation 1 and then I kind of stopped
3934960	3938920	playing Tekken like I didn't really ever play four or five maybe I rented four I
3938920	3943040	don't remember well I remember what I got Tekken 6 from Gamefly and you came
3943040	3946640	over and we played it for a couple hours that's right I had 40 characters which
3946640	3950880	is like a ton amount of characters and we were like we don't we don't care it
3950880	3954560	was kind of bad like yeah isn't that great we just couldn't we yeah we
3954560	3958840	couldn't get into it I I really am curious to see kind of what
3958840	3962760	the Tekken cross I mean cuz we all know what Street Fighter cross Tekken is
3962760	3965380	gonna look like it's gonna be freaking Street Fighter 4 with Tekken characters
3965380	3969400	whoopee I'm more curious to see what Tekken cross Street Fighter ends up
3969400	3973920	looking like and because you know is it gonna be is it gonna kind of not be so
3973920	3978600	great like Tekken 6 or are they gonna maybe get the Soul Calibur people to
3978600	3981440	work on it I don't know it'd be interesting to see what happens did you
3981440	3985560	see the pictures Rob I saw the pictures of Street Fighter cross Tekken but I
3985560	3988800	didn't see the other way around I don't think there is
3988800	3992200	because this all happened at comic-con at the Capcom panel which by the way
3992200	3996080	isn't it weird that they waited for comic-con and didn't say something at
3996080	3999880	e3 I mean maybe they weren't ready to make an announcement at e3 but I mean
3999880	4003300	it wasn't that long ago it just seemed comic-con seems like a weird place to
4003300	4007700	make that type of announcement because you know comic-con all about the comic
4007700	4013720	books I thought that this particular shot was just epic and she's looking at
4013720	4022800	a shot of Ryu fighting Kazuya. Ryu looks like I'm gonna punch you! I have I
4022800	4026880	can tell you right now with the Tekken cross Street Fighter is gonna look like
4026880	4031880	huh the Street Fighter EX series I hope not oh god I'm sorry those games were
4031880	4036320	terrible I did not like them at all ex3 was all right because dude it's all
4036320	4041800	about skull mania but those weren't even produced by Capcom proper it was done
4041800	4045720	through an American company I really like those games so I'm surprised
4045720	4050200	hearing this from you right now what the EX series I thought I think it's really
4050200	4057520	underrated I liked them all okay well all yours
4057520	4063840	well if Namco is doing that one in particular then I'm more than certain
4063840	4070640	that they're gonna be sticking with Namco style for how they do it and
4070640	4075720	they've always had really tight gameplay for the Tekkens well what was that what
4075720	4079640	was the SNK game called remember those Capcom versus SNK but SNK put out what
4079640	4084640	SVC chaos yeah yeah that game wasn't so great not my I mean I love me some SNK
4084640	4089520	but Capcom I think made the better game it was all right yeah so all right
4089520	4093520	anyhow let's move on with some more gaming news we're gonna release dates in
4093520	4097480	a little bit after this next round of news starting off with Loki mm-hmm Sony
4097480	4103760	has patented multiplayer via stereoscopic systems basically the way
4103760	4106840	this is gonna work they actually had something similar and I'm surprised that
4106840	4113440	they're able to patent this anyways they have a way now using the kind of
4113440	4119400	shutter system or whatever that you'll only be able to see your I guess your
4119400	4123760	player or whatever on the screen at one time while someone else can actually see
4123760	4128720	the full screen as well so it'll do split screen by basically having two
4128720	4132760	different images on the screen at the same time and each player will only be
4132760	4136640	able to see their own you know version of the screen using those shutter
4136640	4139720	glasses they actually have this already in TVs right now because I know you can
4139720	4145440	actually do that with those 120 megahertz TVs and watch two different
4145440	4148720	programs at the same time or two different inputs but I guess this would
4148720	4152840	actually kind of combine it with only one input but it would still be two
4152840	4155520	different versions of the game or whatever they're playing I don't know
4155520	4161240	why but that technology sounds painful to me it's really um it's it's a neat
4161240	4164320	idea but it's really it's not something that they're gonna be like oh my god you
4164320	4170760	can do this it'll be kind of cool but at the same time it's kind of a dumb use of
4170760	4174800	if I've got these 3d glasses that I'm paying for in this 3d TV that I'm
4174800	4180720	paying for I'm gonna want to use the 3d portion of that and not necessarily the
4180720	4184440	split-screen portion of that but what if you want to watch one show and your
4184440	4188280	sister wants to watch another show I mean now you both can watch the same
4188280	4193200	show but wouldn't it be cheaper to get a second TV no it's not that at all it's
4193200	4197800	this would be just to play like it's a multiplayer game but you're just
4197800	4200440	watching two different play or two different players are using the same
4200440	4203840	screen but couldn't you do that if look at I mean if it's if it's canceling out
4203840	4206960	one image and only showing you you know basically half the yeah you can do that
4206960	4210520	with certain TVs but not this system this is a totally different system that
4210520	4214720	okay so you can do that right now with certain 120 megahertz TVs if you have
4214720	4219320	that shutter system you can basically do picture-in-picture or you can be stop
4219320	4223000	being a little pussy and just you know look at half the fucking screen it's
4223000	4228200	just spinning like hundreds up hundreds of dollars on a fucking camera or like a
4228200	4234220	stupid shutter glass system just to do this just buy another damn TV like you
4234220	4238420	said but the game system doesn't have the processing power to handle the
4238420	4242280	split-screen those PlayStation threes with their what are they called I don't
4242280	4245920	know the uber cores or whatever those are in the emotion engine no that was
4245920	4254880	ps2 the ps3s have something else the cell and just sell yeah well here's the
4254880	4257920	thing though but it can't handle split-screen yes it can handle split
4257920	4260880	screens if it can handle two different screens it's the same fucking thing
4260880	4266200	actually it's even more processor intensive what they really should have
4266200	4270000	done Rob is they should have gone back to the original design of the PS remember
4270000	4273480	the original design of the ps3 how ridiculous that was with like it's three
4273480	4278040	HDMI outs and it's dual LAN outs and stuffs like what the fuck do you need
4278040	4281400	that stuff for but I mean if that's really what they want to do with this
4281400	4285480	then why not just do that so we can have two fucking TVs or I don't know how
4285480	4288880	about you just stop being a little whiny bitch about it and just not worry about
4288880	4292280	it seriously how many fucking split-screen games are out there not
4292280	4296240	that much anymore which is really sad it is sad it should be more because there's
4296240	4301040	a lot of you know like resistance was a fun split-screen game but there's not a
4301040	4304840	lot of stuff out there Call of Duty you know that'll still do split-screen but
4304840	4309440	it's not a lot out there and why even bother you know working on this
4309440	4314840	technology for like a handful of games say you think blur split-screen the
4314840	4317440	racing game except everyone hates that game for some reason I don't know why
4317440	4321000	it's not that bad but you know who does have the technology to handle split
4321000	4324240	screen flawlessly and who couldn't could bring split screen all our homes the
4324240	4331600	Skynet just saying I can get behind that all right but I mean if you really if
4331600	4338960	this is such an issue I mean I just I I don't understand I yeah some of your
4338960	4343680	screens you know blocked out I've never had the problem where it's like oh my
4343680	4347880	god this is just so painful I can't play this game anymore in split-screen oh my
4347880	4352320	day is ruined you know I can't imagine that that would be a problem yeah
4352320	4356280	because I need to go hey look we can play it to you know a two-player game or
4356280	4360360	whatever but what's gonna stop someone from say I don't know adjusting the
4360360	4363840	shutters on their glasses to sneak a peek at what you're doing it's exactly
4363840	4370080	the same shit all over again I get motion sick with split screens really
4370080	4374600	you can't just focus on one no mines don't work that way but you also can't
4374600	4380200	play first-person shooters so anyways but like when we were doing racing games
4380200	4385840	on split screens it would actually give me a headache after a while even Mario
4385840	4390480	Kart on the old Super Nintendo yeah really that's too bad that was like the
4390480	4394400	king of split screen right there yeah it was because the aspect rate will
4394400	4400720	especially for the older ones the aspect ratio is changed so badly that it really
4400720	4406800	starts putting a strain on my eyes too bad alright well I'm moving on to
4406800	4409960	something that I don't know if they'll be able to put split screen into this
4409960	4413800	but it's a new technology ish thing coming to PlayStation home it's a
4413800	4420600	partnership with codename codename I guess is this indie game label that is
4420600	4426640	gonna never heard of the content for PlayStation home one of the games whoa
4426640	4433560	wait yeah I think you put out content like sodium one I know right well what
4433560	4438600	if one of the first games is called dueling gentleman is the first game I
4438600	4444200	wonder if that will be like I don't know like dueling gentleman sounds a lot like
4444200	4447600	like when I think of dual I think of that game wild gunman on the old
4447600	4452560	Nintendo system ok here's here is wild gunman on the NES if you've never played
4452560	4458200	it's a light gun game and when the game says draw you push the button on the gun
4458200	4464680	as fast as you can and on harder rounds you have to pull the trigger faster so
4464680	4468480	maybe that's a dueling gentleman will be as it'll be press X button to win
4468480	4474640	because that's all wild gunman was by the way it was like a $30 $40 game back
4474640	4477600	in the day alright to be fair I have no idea what the hell this game is about
4477600	4482520	there is a little bit of info though about this you're gonna be using I guess
4482520	4489280	strategy in homes plaza to go against other people in home I have no idea what
4489280	4492800	that is but I guess also peanut galleries and other developer they're
4492800	4496520	gonna be making minor battle it's a capture the flag type of game and then
4496520	4501600	codename is making super awesome mountain RPG it's gonna have tabletop
4501600	4505840	port board games with fantasy role-playing I could be interesting
4505840	4509320	bringing like a little bit of tabletop in a home so because they have super and
4509320	4514720	awesome in the title does not mean it's gonna be super awesome in fact actually
4514720	4518880	having super and awesome in the title usually means it's not super awesome a
4518880	4524680	game by lazy eight called cogs will be in 3d and it will be a dynamic pub
4524680	4530760	public spectacle in home central plaza really I thought the furry dance-off day
4530760	4536160	and Sony home was the dynamic public spectacle but maybe that's just me I
4536160	4541840	don't know oh I got your dynamic public spectacle and any of this is gonna be
4541840	4547200	able to be translated into I don't know stuff for my apartment or a club is this
4547200	4552440	gonna expand the clubs in any way maybe I don't know yeah I don't think they
4552440	4554680	haven't said because it's not gonna happen
4554680	4562400	didn't sodium one like have a shirt oh my god I totally misinterpreted sodium
4562400	4566680	one then it's the most awesome it's the super awesomest thing ever cuz I got a
4566680	4570360	shirt you couldn't you can win a shirt but but Loki it's not actually a real
4570360	4574080	shirt it's not like back in the Atari 2600 days or they would actually send
4574080	4577040	you patches for your jacket if you got a high enough score and like you know
4577040	4581240	barnstorming or ever and they should do that that's that's what that's what
4581240	4587040	achievements are their virtual I can't wear my achievements Microsoft get on
4587040	4592240	that oh wait what if you could wear your achievements you technically can on your
4592240	4595960	avatars somewhat they have those new unlockable things that you do for
4595960	4600960	different things that's what I want like on left 4 dead 2 for the 8 360 once you
4600960	4605040	unlock five or six achievements you would unlock a leopard at 2 t-shirt for
4605040	4609640	your avatar which you could then wear and go on one versus a hundred and show
4609640	4613720	off your left 4 dead 2 t-shirt they've done that in a few games but not a lot
4613720	4616120	of used it yet and I wonder if it's something we'll start seeing more in the
4616120	4619400	next couple years like blur you can get a shirt for your avatar and blur too I
4619400	4622000	think there's a couple of shirts you can get one of them is really easy to get
4622000	4627240	because I got it like I have a sombrero in for Red Dead Redemption I'm which I
4627240	4632600	noticed the other day I'm like oh okay wonderful
4632600	4638080	well we'll see if the indie games are worth launching home but for now Dark
4638080	4644120	Sakura what do you got for us I have more stuff specifically for our buddies
4644120	4650680	overseas in the UK this is about the halo reach Xbox 360 bundle I don't know
4650680	4657480	how much of it maps over to the US but I'm focusing on our friends overseas at
4657480	4664960	any rate um it's gonna be exclusive to game and game station it will be a
4664960	4674800	$249.99 that's pounds will be out on September 14th it will have the
4674800	4680320	limited-edition wireless controller the wireless headset those will be available
4680320	4685320	in the UK on the 3rd of September and we're actually getting it later than
4685320	4691380	they are over there the controller is going to be $39.99 the headset will be
4691380	4702080	$34.99 and they are going to be limited and available for pre-order now as far
4702080	4708760	as in the u.s. I believe that we're getting the bundle for $399 on September
4708760	4713760	14th so a new controller will be available on yeah maybe fix the fucking
4713760	4722240	d-pad yet new for the record our wireless controller is going to be 60 bucks and
4722240	4728560	come with a covenant banshee avatar token for Xbox Live and the headset will
4728560	4734960	be 50 bucks over here and they will be in late August $60 for a controller like
4734960	4738280	I realize that's how much they cost now but it's just got controllers are
4738280	4741600	expensive it's a little ridiculous especially for a controller that's
4741600	4747520	essentially defective all right all right let's travel around the world and
4747520	4750320	see what you can waste your money on this week in the world of gaming Loki
4750320	4753400	will start with you there's a couple things this week that are worth
4753400	4758040	mentioning obviously Starcraft 2 on PC is gonna be a big thing but you think a
4758040	4762320	Starcraft 2 the wings of Liberty remember there will be three versions of
4762320	4767840	this game why I don't I don't see the point because they'll sell it three
4767840	4771400	times to hold they'll sell it they'll try to sell it three times but I know
4771400	4776400	think the second and third versions of the game will be that great ok but that
4776400	4782600	will be coming out this week on PC a game called galaxy racers coming to the
4782600	4788860	DS thanks to Ubisoft it is just like it sounds a game re-erasing space clash of
4788860	4794400	the Titans coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 where you will release the
4794400	4798800	Kraken or at least fight the Kraken that is released upon you at least that's
4798800	4801920	what I gather that movie is about because that's all I ever see in the
4801920	4810760	trailers Kraken being released all right Chuck E. Cheese party games coming to the
4810760	4819640	Wii here's a hint people it's not really a brand new game per se the company UFO
4819640	4826240	interactive they have taken these games called smart girls and smart boys Club
4826240	4830520	and they've just re-skinned them with Chuck E. Cheese stuff you know that's
4830520	4836440	really unfair to the dumb boys and the dumb girls of the world I know it's sad
4836440	4841120	but that will be coming to the Wii Arc Rise Fantasia also coming to the Wii
4841120	4847800	supposed to be pretty awesome RPG if you're into fighting games blaze blue
4847800	4852240	continuum shift will be coming out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 I do believe
4852240	4857080	PC version is going to be available soon as well although if you know where look
4857080	4862840	it's already been out there for months now arcade game used to run on PC
4862840	4871520	hardware and that's basically it and then my god next week there's a whole
4871520	4876760	bunch of junk so I got a question y'all and I want to ask this of chat as well
4876760	4881240	should I buy Starcraft 2 like I was a part of me that kinda wants it like
4881240	4885640	despite all my anger at Blizzard the past month in the show like they do make
4885640	4890040	some really good games and yeah I'm terrible at RTS is but I know some of my
4890040	4893480	friends are buying this game and they're not very good either so I'll have people
4893480	4898000	to play with right now what look cool about Starcraft 2 as the level editor
4898000	4901840	and all the like fun stuff you could do with that like you know the Mario Kart
4901840	4906760	type game and like stuff like that I think that will be neat well for one I
4906760	4910320	want to make sure like I I kinda wanna wait for the reviews of this game to
4910320	4916240	come out because I want to see what they look like I want to know if my real name
4916240	4919900	is going to show in the battles like I want to see how far they took real ID in
4919900	4925880	Starcraft 2 that be funny because like see like if I were to sign up on this I
4925880	4929920	don't have an account or anything and no real name so I could just like create a
4929920	4935480	character called dicks McButt or something like that is like you have to
4935480	4939320	sign up for a battle net account to play Starcraft 2 so you know they would want
4939320	4944680	you know your real name but you could always put you know Matt Loki is your
4944680	4949120	name and I guess they'd really be none the wiser they wouldn't be so I don't
4949120	4952760	know so I'm waiting to see what the game like as much as going to the midnight
4952760	4956160	release might be kind of fun I'm gonna really resist that temptation and just
4956160	4959280	like what give it a week and just kind of see what the reception is and then I
4959280	4964440	guess make my decision from there I personally would wait three months two
4964440	4967480	or three months because you know during that first quarter after it comes out
4967480	4971480	they're all of the balance issues are gonna come out and they're just gonna
4971480	4975040	patch the hell out of it and nerf all the things that need to be nerfed so
4975040	4980680	wait three months and get a more more even version of the game three months I
4980680	4987200	know three months in three months dance central will be here and in cataclysm
4987200	4990800	will be here at DC Universal be on the way I'm gonna have time in three months
4990800	4994440	for cataclysm won't be here in three months okay it's gonna take at least
4994440	4999480	four months see Christmas Thanksgiving Christmas when is cataclysm coming out
4999480	5005040	technically fall right now sometime November all right but the fall is the
5005040	5011600	official date so far so far yeah all right let's move on to Japan and look at
5011600	5015960	some of the release oh look at the some of the release dates of Japan tiger
5015960	5018800	claws linking me to a story that I want to get to later in our chat room I have
5018800	5023240	that on the list for later so we'll talk more about Starcraft 2 later in the show
5023240	5027160	sure zone our chat room says Dix McButt should be on the wiki the orange large
5027160	5032480	radio wiki maybe that's that can be like your quintessential like online name no
5032480	5037760	it's just I was just trying to think of something ridiculous and I'm able to
5037760	5042880	think of things that are very ridiculous all the time all right let's move on to
5042880	5048320	the Japanese release date Xbox 360 quite a bit now we've had some quiet weeks but

5379160	5384680	America just in time for your Halloween parties where you need to rock out to
5384680	5390320	stuff and then of course you with that obviously there's gonna be different
5390320	5395480	pre-order bonuses for wherever you decide to pre-order the game if you

5426520	5429760	that song dark soccer you need to have a rock band party when this game comes out
5429760	5436760	okay I'm getting a keyboard for sure now again please assure me mr. guy who works
5436760	5439880	at the distributor please assure me I will be able to get keyboard plus game
5439880	5444240	that's it right yes absolutely that's a bundle that is available they in fact I
5444240	5448280	don't believe they have full band bundles for this one I think it's just
5448280	5456440	well the the game by itself and then I want to say maybe they may have a full
5456440	5464360	bundle but I haven't seen it I know that the keyboard game bundle is out there in
5464360	5468560	fact I believe that it's already available for pre-order through certain
5468560	5483000	websites and with stop and yes keyboard bundle $130 pro guitar $150 or you can
5483000	5487480	buy the keyboard by itself for $80 what would I do with the keyboard by itself I
5487480	5490440	need a game to play well I guess I could use it as a MIDI keyboard but that that's
5490440	5497520	dumb I want to play blue Monday how does it feel and and the what there's the
5497520	5501440	Queen song right became your Rhapsody yeah oh my god I can't wait to play
5501440	5504880	these on pro expert because then once I learned how to do it you can actually go
5504880	5511080	to a real keyboard what about that gets harder than $150 yeah I don't need it I
5511080	5514600	don't need it but there'll be some people that want it there's some people
5514600	5519800	are pretty hardcore all right one more story from me for you guys and that has
5519800	5524000	to do with comic-con obviously there has been like a games invasion at comic-con
5524000	5527120	this year lots and lots of stuff being shown I just wanted to run down for you

5534840	5538680	fighter cross Tekken and vice versa Activision is there Activision is
5538680	5542600	showing off a spider-man game which I don't think made it toward the cut for
5542600	5545720	our show tonight but apparently I'm hearing a lot of early buzz on the
5545720	5549360	spider-man game that it's gonna blow all the others out of the water absolutely

5565880	5570160	stuff EA is apparently there too they actually took rock band 3 to the show

5695520	5700320	looking at new games and take a trip down memory lane segment on the show
5700320	5704480	here we call the classic game of the week and every week dark soccer likes to
5704480	5709320	go into the vault and find one game that she's been playing and say hey you kids
5709320	5715440	in your comic cons and your newfangled stuff need to take a minute to respect
5715440	5719520	the games that have come before you better recognize you better recognize
5719520	5725280	now this game I know that she picked this week isn't super old but it's older
5725280	5730080	than you might think sadly it's amazing dark soccer what is the classic game of
5730080	5737040	the week this week hydro thunder hydro thunder let me fire up some music here
5737040	5760120	from hydro thunder I love the name of that ship damn the torpedoes this one
5760120	5766560	that Dan knows at any rate it was part of the thunder series of games this game
5766560	5772520	came out in 1999 and had a Dreamcast release and then it came out for
5772520	5777040	PlayStation and instead of 64 in 2000 and the other thunder games is offered
5777040	5780080	thunder four-wheel thunder and Arctic Thunder which Arctic Thunder is pretty
5780080	5788160	damn fun anyway it's racing with boats you have places like the Arctic Circle
5788160	5792320	and you have New York disaster which is the post-apocalyptic you've got the Greek
5792320	5798000	Isles and Thunder Park which is like a whole rally type of setting with water
5798000	5807600	you've got different boosts all over the place the ones that will enable you to
5807600	5816240	either go for a little bit or like get a lot of them the red ones are they give
5816240	5821240	you more fuel as opposed to the blue one so you do have a fuel gauge at least as
5821240	5826640	far as your boosts are concerned and then with boosting you can actually do
5826640	5835300	jumps or you can knock boats sort of off the track and it's pretty cool the
5835300	5840200	arcade cabinet was the same type of cabinet is cruising USA and offered
5840200	5850240	thunder except it didn't have the foot pedals I used a throttle and it had a
5850240	5858840	interesting type of volume deal where he just ran over a penguin that bastard
5858840	5863800	I'm just saying had a subwoofer in the seat so you could feel like you're
5863800	5870440	actually on a boat I'm on a boat with your boats you had the easy ones you had
5870440	5878200	four categories there were easy easy medium hard and bonus with easy you had
5878200	5883400	damn the torpedoes midway and misbehave they had a big fan instead of a
5883400	5891920	propeller the medium boats you had banshee tidal blade thresher and the
5891920	5897940	tidal blade is the cover for the dreamcast the hard ones you had cut
5897940	5905800	throat a rad hazard that was sort of like UFO and Razorback which was that
5905800	5910720	was on the PlayStation 1064 ones and if you pick one of those they say you're
5910720	5919040	great whoa your mic cut out again I don't know what it's something is weird
5919040	5922640	in that connection I don't know what it is you look at the cord and I'll use the
5922640	5929400	other one all right how's this perfect okay um with the bonus boats you had
5929400	5934720	tiny tannic which was a small version of the Titanic and you had the blowfish
5934720	5939600	and chumdinger which was a fishing boat it would actually bark at the other
5939600	5945320	boats you also have armed response which is the police boats with a turret guns
5945320	5948940	there was all the different tracks like I mentioned with Thunder Park lost
5948940	5952800	island the Arctic Circle then going into medium with Lake Powell which is one that
5952800	5958160	was really fun it's like a lake in the middle of Utah that's actually the same
5958160	5963560	Lake Powell supposed to be there's a Far East Greek Isles and then the hard
5963560	5967560	tracks there was ship graveyard Venice canals in New York disaster which New
5967560	5971840	York disaster was actually kind of my favorite and then the bonus ones you had
5971840	5977840	Castle Von Dandy Nile adventure which was the longest tracking game catacombs
5977840	5984960	and hydro speedway which was the one that was the rally style there were
5984960	5990520	different versions of course like I said those the dreamcast one the PlayStation
5990520	5995720	one had a career mode in it the dreamcast though was closest to the
5995720	6000680	arcade of any of the consoles Nintendo 64 version was actually amazingly fun
6000680	6006320	and really good for what it was it had a four player multiplayer instead of two
6006320	6011600	player and you could do that with Nintendo 64 expansion pack and the
6011600	6016280	dreamcast version is the one that's on Midway arcade treasures 3 there's also a
6016280	6020960	PC version that was out in Europe the dreamcast version was one of the Sega
6020960	6028440	all-star titles and there is going to be a sequel out well there's a spiritual
6028440	6032840	sequel already out called h2 overdrive which is pretty fun the original team
6032840	6037880	that worked on hydro Thunder did h2 overdrive button through all thrills and
6037880	6046680	then hydro Thunder hurricane is going to be out on xbox live arcade and Microsoft
6046680	6051720	bought the rights after Midway was acquired by Warner Brothers so there you
6051720	6054120	have it

6154880	6160400	talking about this okay well apparently um as well we told our listeners that
6160400	6163660	they should start writing these completely nonsensical like stupid
6163660	6167040	things and submit them into the Kmart reviews and that would be really funny
6167040	6170800	just like flood their reviews a bunch of dumb stuff well we had at least one
6170800	6176320	listener submit one review so thank you to that one individual who did SGA 100

6232400	6237560	even worse good times on Kmart reviews all right let's get into the rapid-fire
6237560	6241400	news of some actual gaming news that happened this week stuff we have in
6241400	6247680	short little bites for you guys Loki yes so guitar hero words of rock will be
6247680	6251080	coming out in a couple months here and of course they always have to have
6251080	6258640	someone epic really difficult song to play in the game well apparently there
6258640	6263280	is going to be one track very similar to some other long songs that have been in
6263280	6273240	the game it will include Russia's 20 minute long seven part epic 21 12 and I
6273240	6278440	guess it's a few parts that are progressive rock and then I don't know
6278440	6283520	I've never heard the song but that's a long ass song 20 minutes that's
6283520	6287200	ridiculous it's almost like that one achievement in rock band that you have
6287200	6290480	to play like every single song in the game and it takes on it like an hour or
6290480	6295720	two yeah that makes me think of um any god it is my my working I don't I think
6295720	6300000	barely we just you're it's it's wired for Jamie not you try giving that one to
6300000	6305360	Jamie and use that one live radio yeah as far as epic songs for rock band or
6305360	6309680	since they have a keyboard they should do in a gada da vida which I think is a
6309680	6315520	good 23 minutes with the keyboards so yeah good times yeah that song is one
6315520	6322680	whole hallucination something else that was at comic-con this week and I don't
6322680	6327760	even know why it was at comic-con it's like kencha Hulk type of stuff but
6327760	6335480	apparently they had a game from an independent developer called a Bobo's big
6335480	6341360	adventure and you may not remember a Bobo but sadly I think I do a Bobo is
6341360	6349120	from Double Dragon ah yes and but was big adventure has him going through a
6349120	6356040	bunch of 8-bit NES classics kind of parody style it is a PC game but they
6356040	6361080	had it displayed on a cabinet I would like to read this brief I'm sure this
6361080	6366760	game is extremely legal yes I would like to read this brief description of some
6366760	6374120	of the levels here let's see here okay the first stage that this person played
6374120	6379680	looked just like Double Dragon starting off he encountered typical enemies and
6379680	6382920	fought them off with the exact same control scheme from the original Double
6382920	6388200	Dragon game but then the the guys from kung-fu showed up all in a row goombas
6388200	6392800	from Super Mario Brothers waddled into the screen and Kid Nicky followed and he
6392800	6396240	was trying to fall fight them all off but then Donkey Kong jumped up on the
6396240	6400320	surface above and started throwing exploding barrels as head has it was
6400320	6405800	like all of NES done was out to get him I these they only felt better when an
6405800	6411120	8-bit bystander walked up to a Bobo and he ripped his head off and ate it and
6411120	6417440	then used his body to fight a charging skateboard from TNC surf what there's
6417440	6424000	another another level called super my Bobo found a bow in a jail cell after
6424000	6428600	picking up trash and eating it a Bobo had to use the cell toilet something he
6428600	6432520	ate must not have agreed with him because a massive vertical column of
6432520	6437120	shit came out of his ass and somehow had him flying over the toilet and falling
6437120	6442560	down into or down into it yes you're just making this up really this ends up
6442560	6446000	to being like a warp pipe the Super Mario Brothers and both finds himself in
6446000	6450680	a parody of the water world from that game and he has a Yoshi like tongue that
6450680	6455120	enables him to eat and spit enemies into other enemies there's also apparently
6455120	6463120	some Megaman I saw in there I feel like a bunch of like 19 year olds got really
6463120	6467720	high one night and in between eating Cheetos they just started like talking
6467720	6472520	and somebody was like dude dude that's really good like dude show the dude
6472520	6476840	that's hella funny dude dude you should write that down dude and like they did
6476840	6480920	like things to get posted to new grounds when you're blackout drunk basically
6480920	6484760	funny that you should mention that new grounds because that's where this game
6484760	6490160	will be featured at some what a surprise as what a goddamn surprise I'm gonna
6490160	6496200	fall over and die from that surprise dot-com so yeah but was big adventure
6496200	6502680	supposed to be out in December it looks funny I guess I don't know and then
6502680	6509440	finally that plot he read sounded like the plot to the poop that took a pee the
6509440	6515680	poop that took a pee it was on an episode as narrated by Morgan Freeman
6515680	6521320	why it was Morgan Freeman it wasn't Morgan Freeman the poop that took a pee
6521320	6527960	he can I Leo Poland a butterscotch anything uh legend of mana is gonna be
6527960	6533240	the next game hitting the Japanese PlayStation 1 classics nice on the
6533240	6545640	PlayStation Network of course be out next week for 600 in or 650 so I mean
6545640	6551800	it's gonna be to other regions soon speaking of poops it took a pee like
6551800	6556120	legend of man it's like seriously like my least favorite PlayStation game I was
6556120	6560840	so disappointed in that game I realized it has its fans and what have you but I
6560840	6565680	was I was expecting what I think was really then keep in mind this was many
6565680	6568640	years ago I didn't know there was this whole like import gaming scene
6568640	6573520	everything so in my mind what really was second at set to three I thought was
6573520	6576400	what I was kind of getting with was going to get with legend of mana and
6576400	6581640	then it was like I don't understand what what what is this but you liked it
6581640	6585040	didn't you Alan you tell me one day I did I did like it's wrong I played it
6585040	6587960	all the way through I did every little stupid class you probably like saga
6587960	6594720	frontier too well I had the Japanese it was terrible and it was so hard it was
6594720	6599840	so heavy language wise I couldn't play it very well do you like the saga
6599840	6605480	series too yeah I got I was really excited about saga frontier because it
6605480	6609880	made it sound like chrono trigger with the combo attacks okay yeah and I played
6609880	6614280	it and yeah that was pretty awful behind lasted an hour yeah I lasted about an
6614280	6618120	hour to us like this game is terrible all right anyhow let's move on to some
6618120	6623760	other quick news hey up there in canadia you're gonna be getting Netflix finally
6623760	6626840	of course I'm talking about Canada I'm not that stupid
6626840	6631280	Canada's finally getting Netflix I actually I gotta be honest I didn't
6631280	6634920	realize they didn't already have it like I usually with a lot of this broadcast
6634920	6639040	stuff they get the rights cleared pretty quickly but sadly yeah Canada's kind of
6639040	6644320	been shut out so they will finally be getting Netflix up there but you should
6644320	6648000	be aware if you're French Canadian and you don't speak English well I don't
6648000	6651800	know why you're listening to this show for one but yeah the French Netflix
6651800	6655120	service is not going to be out right away but it will come out eventually so
6655120	6661040	you will be able to get this in Canada on the 360 the ps3 and we so they are
6661040	6664000	not really they're being a little vague on if it's going to be the exact same
6664000	6667840	movies and so forth because the clearance is and so forth but they do
6667840	6671840	give you the nice little marketing fluff of Canadian Netflix members will be able
6671840	6675660	to instantly watch a broad array of movies and TV episodes right on their
6675660	6680200	TVs via a range of consumer electronic devices capable of streaming from
6680200	6687120	Netflix as well as PCs and Macs so yeah I you know you're going to be getting it
6687120	6690440	but it's probably not going to look the exact same as it does here at least not
6690440	6696480	right away so yeah Joystick had emailed Netflix looking for comment and Netflix
6696480	6700320	responded to the big blog we're not announcing the Netflix ready devices
6700320	6703960	until the service launches but it's fair to assume that several popular brand
6703960	6707360	name devices will be capable of streaming from Netflix to TVs at launch
6707360	6711280	in addition to the ability to watch instantly on computers and that will add
6711280	6715960	to the family of devices over time so hooray for you guys in Canada I suppose
6715960	6721880	Plants vs. Zombies is going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade finally early
6721880	6725840	September I played I played this on an iPad this week a little bit because yes

6853280	6861560	and that's it now we also have other cool news for those of us who are Capcom
6861560	6867360	fans is that they're doing an online version of Street Fighter 3 third strike
6867360	6876800	which they're calling it Street Fighter 3 third strike online which is an update
6876800	6880440	to the Dreamcast one but you want to know what they already made it and I
6880440	6885480	already own it it was the for matching service you remember how when everything
6885480	6889880	has a long title I usually end for matching service on it that's it it came
6889880	6895240	out in Japan already so I've already got it yeah but most people over here never
6895240	6898360	heard of it so you know with the success of their online games I'm assuming
6898360	6902240	they're just giving this the old Xbox live arcade update correct yeah pretty
6902240	6907400	much so but it is well that mic sucks Jamie I don't know what to say you know
6907400	6913040	it's probably me because my voice isn't very no I mean you cut completely out
6913040	6918680	it's the cord it's not your voice well shit exactly huh yeah all right I'll
6918680	6923760	take Alan's mic thank you you're being nice for sharing let's move on to some
6923760	6931520	Twitter topics twitter.com slash olr you guys send us tweets every week and we
6931520	6934280	respond to them live on air maybe there's stories we didn't get around to
6934280	6939360	sharing who knows what it's all about we're gonna start off with death death
6939360	6944680	wishing tonight do you guys hate Kotek to the evil CEO he's my least favorite
6944680	6950880	human being next to Aquaman do we hate Bobby Kotek hey is a strong word and yes
6950880	6956680	but yes all right um TigerClaw305 sent us a link he always sends us great
6956680	6961800	links Disney is in talks apparently to buy Playdom. Playdom by the way made such
6961800	6966640	awesome Facebook games like sorority life didn't Disney just buy somebody
6966640	6971440	Disney bought what Tapulous and so now Disney is in talks with Playdom buy them
6971440	6975920	out for five hundred million is what they're saying again these are all
6975920	6979840	rumors but Disney's gonna use this company to incorporate its popular
6979840	6983760	brands and characters into social games Playdom by the way is based out of
6983760	6988280	Mountain View California I never knew that that's not that far away so yeah
6988280	6992040	there you go apparently Disney might use its ESPN brands on some of this as well
6992040	6997320	could be very interesting Playdom ranks third behind Zynga and Playfish by the
6997320	7005840	way just you know of big social game companies let's see some folks retreat
7005840	7010000	we're tweeting our congratulatory message to Bobby so grads Bobby
7010000	7015600	let's see spazz nator says do you think we'll ever see a Mortal Kombat versus
7015600	7018720	Street Fighter game there's been a lot of talk tonight about Street Fighter
7018720	7024800	cross Tekken what about the two ultimate I guess in some regards maybe even top
7024800	7028760	if you dare go there fighting game franchises Street Fighter Mortal Kombat
7028760	7031680	could it ever happen what do you guys think good Street Fighter versus Mortal
7031680	7036120	Kombat ever happened it could they play nice with Warner I mean obviously
7036120	7044240	they're playing nice with other you know publishers so it could happen whether it
7044240	7048280	will happen or not I don't know I think someone did a Mugen one where they took
7048280	7055080	the the Street Fighter movie ones in the old Mortal Kombat that were all the
7055080	7059640	image capture and did a Mugen version Mortal Kombat is sort of all about the
7059640	7063280	fatalities and the over-the-topness and you know all those Street Fighter has
7063280	7065840	some over-the-top I don't know if I could see it like I can't see the
7065840	7068820	Street Fighter characters really doing fatalities and then if you take the
7068820	7072520	fatalities on a Mortal Kombat like what's left you know now what if they
7072520	7078720	did Mortal Kombat versus crap that eternal champions what you got it how
7078720	7082120	long ago is eternal champions eternal champions needs to come back with the
7082120	7086600	Senate bills and everything just do a real kill again throw kill is horrible
7086600	7092240	yeah I don't see a game where Sakura gets her spine ripped out I just I can't
7092240	7096040	I can't there is something wrong with that like how would you feel about that
7096040	7099920	dark Sakura if there was a game where you could just like totally rip Sakura's
7099920	7109200	arms off well as long as they included a non-black your ear out again it's just
7109200	7116960	a dammit though I am I in now yeah okay I was basically saying if they included
7116960	7121640	a non blacked-out version of the shingle kusatsu with all kinds of you know
7121640	7126080	beating up and you know breaking noses and bones and having it be really
7126080	7130080	destructive and leave them as a bloody pulp then maybe I could deal with it I
7130080	7134040	don't know there just would have to be too much compromise one way or the other
7134040	7137600	I just don't see like Street Fighter and Tekken kind of makes sense and as much
7137600	7140720	as I love Soul Calibur like it wouldn't make sense like the Street Fighter
7140720	7143680	people don't use weapons weapons are a huge part of Soul Calibur it would make
7143680	7150040	sense so but Street Fighter Tekken yeah I get that I get it all right let's see
7150040	7156960	other comments on our twitter twitter.com slash o-l-r Matt SJ 100 Matt is
7156960	7160800	sending us a tweet is Capcom jumping the shark releasing all of these versus
7160800	7165320	games all at once I'm excited but this should have happened ten years ago
7165320	7170240	honestly thank Street Fighter 4 I honestly think Street Fighter 4 is the
7170240	7173740	reason for a lot of this and I think the really warm reception the community had
7173740	7177440	to this kind of made them decide to listen to the fans a little more and now
7177440	7181760	they are just just giving fans what they want left and right it's kind of like
7181760	7186000	what game do you want oh you want oh well here you go then it's kind of where
7186000	7190720	Capcom is going lately you know so I don't know dark soccer do you think this
7190720	7196640	is too much or not enough or what I think it's just right all right all
7196640	7201920	right and last tweet from rock man rock that's not a redundant name at all I
7201920	7206940	love that name rock man rock why are you guys so awesome is the tweet why are you
7206940	7213320	guys so awesome I was born that way well it's that's very nice I some days I do
7213320	7217120	think I'm awesome but some days I don't feel so awesome
7217120	7222040	but Rob why not I just you know some days are harder than others but your
7222040	7225320	tweets help me get through the day I appreciate it
7225320	7229520	twitter.com slash olr if you want to send us some tweets for now more news
7229520	7238520	loki yes so apparently their rock star is cracking down on Red Dead Redemption
7238520	7244080	cheaters now I have a problem with them saying that because that's not exactly
7244080	7249120	what's going on here they're cutting I guess they're cracking down on people
7249120	7253920	that are utilizing glitches in the game for example they're saying that people
7253920	7257680	are glitching into parts of the map that you're not supposed to be able to glitch
7257680	7263720	into like for example there's a house that's in kind of the Mexico part of the
7263720	7269800	game or you can actually kind of aim at or walk into the corner of a wall and
7269800	7274360	you'll clip through the ground and you can shoot at stuff underneath it and
7274360	7278360	apparently people are pissed off that they're getting shot by people that they
7278360	7282760	can't shoot back at and so because of that you know they're gonna start
7282760	7286160	patching the game or fixing it so they can't clip through these different
7286160	7291840	things whatever fine do that people will just find other glitches since the game
7291840	7297720	is super glitchy but it's not legitimate cheating say you know where they've
7297720	7301400	modded the game to make their guns fire rockets or something like that like that
7301400	7307960	happens in Grand Theft Auto like crazy no one's figured out how to do that yet
7307960	7312480	because exploits are not hacks there's a huge difference between an exploit and a
7312480	7316520	hack exactly and you know I don't understand why people are up in arms
7316520	7321880	about this crap because you just don't go where those players are then because
7321880	7325840	you can see them on the map they're not invisible and obviously if they're under
7325840	7330360	a building or something they keep shooting at you then perhaps you should
7330360	7337280	walk away from them I mean there's no real hacks or whatever to say you know
7337280	7340920	immediately kill somebody you know with homing bullets or something ridiculous
7340920	7344960	like that nothing like that yet but you know when they make a gun that starts
7344960	7348840	firing dynamite or something that's different but just because people are
7348840	7352760	you know clipping through stuff doesn't really necessarily make it a cheat I
7352760	7356080	also agree that exploits are not cheating because like you know I've
7356080	7359680	played a lot of these online games like you know kind of like fan games don't
7359680	7362720	make fun me okay I like Survivor and Big Brother and a lot of those like a
7362720	7366480	reality shows that have very game centric things and you know people put
7366480	7370400	together challenges and I love to find loopholes in the challenge rules and win
7370400	7372640	every time like that's you know I do that
7372640	7375680	unity is very important I do similar stuff in Grand Theft Auto there's
7375680	7380440	different exploits you can use they're not necessarily it's not cheating I
7380440	7384080	guess because it's still playing within the rules of game and everybody can do
7384080	7388200	it just because they don't know about it doesn't that's not my problem that you
7388200	7391920	don't you know read up on this stuff like there's a way to fire the sniper
7391920	7398720	rifle really fast by crouching and crouching there's ways to fall off a
7398720	7406040	large from a large distance and not take any damage by doing a stunt role in mid
7406040	7410760	air you know stuff like that but you know it's stuff that I've learned through
7410760	7416600	you know just reading online and through when you've seen people do stuff and
7416600	7418880	kind of figuring out how they did different things and it makes me a
7418880	7423680	better player now granted it's not like I'm using you know modded weapons that
7423680	7427480	fire rockets at people like crazy and there's lots of people out there to do
7427480	7431480	that there's a difference between utilizing you know the nuances of the
7431480	7436960	game you know the different glitches and actually cheating in the game to the
7436960	7443520	point that it's an unfair advantage knowledge is not cheating cheating is
7443520	7447840	cheap alright and if you cheat in an online game you're kind of a dick anyway
7447840	7451960	unless you're cheating with your friends and you all agree that cheating is okay
7451960	7456800	that's different well if you're doing that then you know like the modded games
7456800	7460360	that will play against each other that's not necessarily cheating it's just
7460360	7464360	you're playing with a whole different set of rules now or fun it's it's a mod
7464360	7468520	it's not it's not cheating it's like if we played our with our modded weapons
7468520	7474560	against other players that would be cheating so a mod it's a mod here Loki
7474560	7478120	here's something to entertain you while I do this next story here here you go
7478120	7483000	how to entertain you for I am NOT I'm not playing this on an iPhone I'm sorry
7483000	7488040	I feel dirty for having robot unicorn attack and it's it's it's Loki's
7488040	7491040	favorite game and they have an iPhone it's not my favorite game but yes it is
7491040	7493160	your favorite game you play it all the time during the show I'm surprised you're
7493160	7496680	not playing it tonight and they have it on the iPhone now and it you know you
7496680	7500280	just tap the screen to do your jumping and I can't see you this directions I'm
7500280	7504400	probably falling everywhere but there you go I played this a lot this week too
7504400	7510600	all right good times remember always I want to be I almost forgot to show that
7510600	7514560	to Loki was something reminded me of that early I knew it was out other
7514560	7518360	people like me I can't believe you made me buy that game because it's you know
7518360	7521600	you keep talking about like I haven't played it in like months now you are
7521600	7525280	playing it last week on the show I was not playing it last week on the show
7525280	7529520	two weeks ago on the show it wasn't two weeks ago either yes it was I'll go in
7529520	7533720	the archives and find it and like if you if you turn up the music really loud in
7533720	7541000	the background you'll hear oh you should totally make this for your baby's room
7541000	7549200	what's that it's a toadstool stool sorry and I told you and I'm easily out of it
7549200	7552400	easily distracted kind of that's all right well here's something that's very
7552400	7556880	distracting it's this Old Spice ad on the left side of this page here with the
7556880	7560880	Old Spice guy because you know he's awesome anyhow I know really it's about
7560880	7565320	the Mega Man universe a little more information I mean little little more
7565320	7571440	information at comic-con this week from Akiko Ido actually talked about this a
7571440	7576400	little bit he's the producer I'm sorry actually it's a Kenji Inafune actually
7576400	7581440	talked about this he's the producer of Mega Man universe and no he's the
7581440	7586320	creator of Mega Man no he's a homeless man I don't know Kenji Inafune is the
7586320	7592080	creator of Mega Man and Akiko Ido is the Mega Man universe producer there we go
7592080	7596520	can't you tell I'm like totally up on my video game trivia anyway Mega Man
7596520	7601080	universe of course is coming out eventually and they say it will let you
7601080	7606680	play as the Mega Man of your dreams the concept of Mega Man universe quote came
7606680	7611840	from the idea of what Mega Man is and what it means to different people
7611840	7617680	everyone has a unique idea of what Mega Man is and they even referred to the
7617680	7622040	quote crappy version of Mega Man from the original cartridge that character
7622040	7627560	they don't know about they didn't really say like what the game really really is
7627560	7630640	but a lot of people are inferring like maybe it's just like that and I think
7630640	7633640	Loki said this last week on the show it's kind of like that Nintendo
7633640	7636840	championships or whatever they call that game with all the Nintendo characters
7636840	7643120	the Nintendo crossover game or Mario crossover right they say that it's gonna
7643120	7647040	quote unite Mega Man fans from around the planet to play together in one place
7647040	7650640	then they close by saying you haven't heard the last of the Mega Man
7650640	7654080	announcements out there and they say they're gonna give an oft requested
7654080	7658840	thing to what you guys want and the crowd promptly started shouting Mega Man
7658840	7665440	Legends 3 and he just smiled and said thank you and didn't confirm I hope so
7665440	7669560	by the way the game we're gonna be we only cuz I will be pissed the game will
7669560	7673840	also not be out for a while I don't know what a while is but it's gonna be a
7673840	7680040	while I want to know where the universe thing is if that means online or if
7680040	7683240	that's because of all the characters in it I think it's gonna have all the
7683240	7687280	different games in it be in another galaxy thank you dark Tetsuya Super
7687280	7692080	Mario crossover that's what I was thinking of alright dark soccer what do
7692080	7699320	you got for us stuff and this is for Marvel vs. Capcom actually which is some
7699320	7704840	pretty cool stuff I'd like to say four new characters have been confirmed at

7752040	7760280	the beautiful Joe so pretty cool Trish ah is leathery tasty didn't they also
7760280	7767960	announce the my jumping ahead I'm sorry what the dog from Okami or did I think
7767960	7774080	yeah I saw you is good yeah it's awesome I said that right yeah yeah good times
7774080	7780040	all right um yeah that's and also Thor yeah so I guess there's a lot of
7780040	7785880	characters they're showing mm-hmm good times look you what he got for us this
7785880	7790480	is kind of funny apparently South Peak this is like the lawsuit that really no
7790480	7798320	one would care about South Peak is suing Majesco over my baby three so when you
7798320	7804960	over my baby apparently who that is my baby mama South Peak games that is
7804960	7811400	taking a legal action against Majesco specifically regarding the right to
7811400	7817760	publishing my baby titles in the United States this was spurred by an
7817760	7822760	announcement last month I guess that Majesco would publish my baby three and
7822760	7830480	friends an action South Peak claims Majesco wasn't legally allowed to take
7830480	7836440	for its part a South Peak issued this statement on the impeding litigation
7836440	7842960	we're exceptionally proud of our success in making the my baby franchise really
7842960	7848920	in North America our innovative sales marketing PR strategies brought my baby
7848920	7854480	to a huge audience and built no sense of shame built a loyal fan base for future
7854480	7861800	products oh wow where okay South Beach continues to hold the rights to
7861800	7866920	subsequent my baby games and we intend to vigorously protect those rights
7866920	7874960	additionally we've confirmed that while South Peak claims a contractual right to
7874960	7878800	publish subsequent my baby games in the u.s.
7878800	7888160	noblest owns the my baby IP so it's up to I guess noblest to decide I guess who
7888160	7896640	publishes what and yeah so basically they're just complaining about that but
7896640	7904880	I don't know I think it's dumb honestly I know that my baby games sell somewhat
7904880	7909720	because people people like their sim games and little girls love this stuff
7909720	7915920	but I mean honestly we're talking like these games sell maybe maybe 200,000
7915920	7919360	units I mean those are like I've judgment numbers there I mean to give
7919360	7927680	you an example how how much these fail so I don't know I'm surprised that they
7927680	7931080	wouldn't be suing like for say babysitting mama or something like that
7931080	7936680	I'm surprised these games are such a big fucking deal in the first place you'd be
7936680	7941480	surprised like imagine games they're terrible they have so many that come out
7941480	7947640	they sell and even like littlest pet shop which I hate you EA and you're
7947640	7952840	fucking three versions of the game they got to put out each year those sell well
7952840	7960720	too it's just weird all right well this is also kind of weird but cool I guess
7960720	7964400	that it was considered but it didn't happen this is running on a website I've
7964400	7969960	not heard of these guys before but gamer annex.com was running this story and it
7969960	7973440	kind of caught wind and ended up on a lot of game blogs this week and it was a
7973440	7978960	comment that Rahul sued the voodoo PC founder and he's also the current CTO of
7978960	7983200	gaming at Hila Packard he actually revealed a couple months ago that there
7983200	7988080	was a secret project or an interesting one or a quiet one nonetheless at
7988080	7992480	Microsoft it would have allowed PC gamers to actually match up with console
7992480	7995920	players so it wouldn't just be like Final Fantasy 11 wouldn't be the only
7995920	8001720	game they'll be cross it is not the only game what else is cross platform shadow
8001720	8007280	run was cross platform right okay and also I believe there was another
8007280	8013720	strategy game that was man I don't remember which one it was there was I
8013720	8018400	want to see minesweeper was a kingdom under fire or something like that it was
8018400	8023320	some sort of game similar that that was cross-platform by no shadow run was well
8023320	8027280	they were testing Gears of War and unreal tournament but it didn't end up
8027280	8031760	happening here's why I've heard from reliable this is a quote from our whole
8031760	8035160	suit I've heard from reliable sources that during the development they brought
8035160	8039480	together the best console gamers to play mediocre PC gamers at the same game and
8039480	8043360	guess what happened they pitted console gamers with their console controller
8043360	8047640	against PC gamers with their keyboard and mouse the console players got
8047640	8052520	destroyed every time so much so that it would be embarrassing to the Xbox team
8052520	8057040	in general had Microsoft launched this initiative I know there's a little bit
8057040	8060360	of that that sounds fanboy to me especially knowing that these other
8060360	8064000	games are out there what what are you coughing about over there when we played
8064000	8067560	Left 4 Dead online together on our PCs and I found out that you were playing
8067560	8072400	with the Xbox controller I was giving you side-eye for that reason why I was
8072400	8078440	mouse mouse and keyboard is superior and now this is I was is the story I tell
8078440	8082800	you if they had cross-platform playing Grand Theft Auto I would eat up any PC
8082800	8086720	player anybody out there I would destroy them but that's not a first-person
8086720	8090080	shooter and I think it doesn't matter it still has first-person shooter kind of
8090080	8096320	controls I would destroy them all of them I don't give a shit if you're using
8096320	8101120	a tomato to control the game I will destroy you feel like there's this whole
8101120	8105960	kind of like fanboy war about keyboard and mouse versus Xbox 360 controllers
8105960	8109680	that is continuing to be perpetuated on this very program all they need to do is
8109680	8115400	just offer keyboard mouse support for these games on the Xbox oh wait but then
8115400	8120000	they wouldn't be able to sell $60 controllers I guess but I mean this way
8120000	8124760	it wouldn't be that damn hard there's USB ports I mean would it be really
8124760	8128640	difficult to I don't know map keys in a game or something you can't work well
8128640	8132080	you can mouse here's the funny thing you can plug in a keyboard I used to use a
8132080	8137840	keyboard on fancy 11 for certain games but in I guess if you know by certain
8137840	8143200	accessories there's ways that kind of shoehorn it in there but why they don't
8143200	8147240	offer it as an actual solution for you know say Call of Duty and stuff like
8147240	8151300	that is beyond me because I think that'd be a great idea but then again they
8151300	8155240	wouldn't be able to sell accessories like they do I don't really think it's a
8155240	8158320	big deal because most people probably buy a controller anyways they're not
8158320	8162440	going to just use strictly keyboard mouse for everything but it'd be kind of
8162440	8170880	cool and I wonder if they could actually do that like have support for that I'm
8170880	8173400	trying to look at some of our comments in our chat room chat that orders on
8173400	8176600	show you a calm legend is aku is saying Loki prepare for an ass-whooping with an
8176600	8181240	eight-year-old logitech mouse I think but unfortunately you can't I mean you
8181240	8185120	can't with you can't with Grantham auto because it's not a wall obviously
8185120	8189560	because it's not crashed no cross-platform and especially if it's on
8189560	8197000	360 there's nothing cross-platform anymore that's too bad bonds 006 in our
8197000	8203840	chat says I will die with a keyboard in my hands I've tried playing keyboard
8203840	8208120	mouse I just I don't don't like it I you have to play team fortress 2 with it
8208120	8211320	like you can't use a controller in team fortress 2 and it's probably part of the
8211320	8213760	reason I'm forced to play a medic because you don't really have to aim
8213760	8219440	very well you should lay on the 360 I guess I could but then I'd have to buy
8219440	8224080	the game again I already bought it on Steam I remember when Left 4 Dead 2 came
8224080	8228200	out last November and there was a lot of drama on a lot of the major blogs like
8228200	8232680	joystick and Kotaku who played the 360 version of the game and they gave it
8232680	8237240	like mediocre reviews saying it was too hard and then the sites that reviewed it
8237240	8242560	on PC said it was fine and I guess the people played it on Xbox 360 just
8242560	8247040	couldn't they just kept getting wiped out so I think you know the game was
8247040	8250560	developed for both platforms but the keyboard mouse people just had an
8250560	8254880	advantage I don't know keep fanning those flames yeah and it's like why did
8254880	8258960	you give that game a seven it all came down to the controller according to the
8258960	8262360	reviewers again I hate to keep going back to this and it's not a first-person
8262360	8265160	shooter but Final Fantasy 11 you could play with the controller in that game
8265160	8268960	and Jamie didn't she did quite well with it I mean you have to set up your
8268960	8274360	macros in advance but you can do it but I I would I had the triggers on top and
8274360	8278520	I would just cycle through my macro see my trigger buttons mm-hmm and Rob Rob
8278520	8282640	saw me do it mm-hmm the complete edition was like five bucks on Steam this week I
8282640	8285800	saw that it was a part of me that just just kind of wanted to play it for a
8285800	8289920	month really it really was gonna come down to if you want to do games that are
8289920	8293520	cross-platform like that and you want to have everybody on come the same page you
8293520	8297000	make the controls more console friendly I guess because that's what they're
8297000	8302840	doing with DC universes they're making the stuff kind of translate over you
8302840	8307240	know it the controls are simple as it is and so it translates over well to the
8307240	8311280	actual controller I I was you know it's funny and I don't know if I should be
8311280	8315240	repeating this but I was told that the three that the part of the reason why
8315240	8319320	the games are not cross-server at this time is because it played so much
8319320	8323400	differently on the PC versus the PlayStation 3 and that one was having an
8323400	8326720	advantage over the other and I wonder if it comes down to this whole same issue
8326720	8332160	it's the PlayStation controller versus keyboard mouse could be now see I'll
8332160	8334760	play Warcraft with a keyboard mouse I couldn't play that with a controller I
8334760	8338520	think I don't you think you can play that with a controller I don't know but
8338520	8343080	be weird well like see like for example when I played PC games I use an Xbox
8343080	8348620	360 controller a lot of times you know Grand Theft Auto and Crysis I played
8348620	8354220	with PC or with a 360 controller it worked great for me I never had any
8354220	8357600	problems getting killed I don't want to keep on with this debate I want to hear
8357600	8360460	what our folks have to say in the mailbag but one more story from Dark
8360460	8366320	Sakura about another MMO right yeah for Phantasy Star Universe they're getting a
8366320	8372880	pretty big update there is going to be the ambition of the illuminous expansion
8372880	8379120	which is a free download and I paid $15 for abortion of the illuminous like two
8379120	8386520	years ago bastards the Guardians advanced content content is an automated
8386520	8390520	update for the subscribers with new missions weapons items customization
8390520	8396520	system and overhaul the games class classes and skills and guardians will
8396520	8401920	require ambition of the illuminous to work so that's why it's free pretty much
8401920	8409720	and I guess they're basically taking into account all of the problems that
8409720	8415560	people had with Phantasy Star Universe that you know all the stuff they took
8415560	8424400	away from online that made it so much more fun I do think PSO was more fun you
8424400	8429920	think it's worth revisiting maybe hmm I don't know that I want to play it on the
8429920	8434160	360 maybe to look at for like a day yeah and they shut down the servers to all
8434160	8439320	the other formats didn't they think it's only on 360 now but they offered some
8439320	8443960	support for free servers hmm all right well let's get into the mailbag every
8443960	8448240	week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orange launch radio.com we pick a few
8448240	8451320	of our favorites and make dark soccer read them for you guys live on our
8451320	8456760	program mailbag at orange lounge radio.com okay this is from rubber buff the
8456760	8461360	first one it I'm not going to fully review the puzzle agent game as it's
8461360	8465000	much like professor Layton it's on steam by telltale games who say my max
8465000	8469960	episodes sold well let's say it's a game where you are in a town with OCD about
8469960	8475400	puzzles there's a very little point-and-click where you play trading
8475400	8480140	games to advance is mostly all dialogue and puzzles I'm also playing the game
8480140	8483680	la-di-da and suddenly the game ends at what is typically the middle of the
8483680	8488200	story I'm not upset about the game being too short I'm mad because the game was
8488200	8492080	not listed as episodic either that or I completely missed it a game like this is
8492080	8496360	typically $5 but they have a single illustrator so perhaps that bumped the
8496360	8502120	game up to $10 I'm also into Xbox live arcade game limbo the game reminds me a
8502120	8505160	lot of out of this world that's because you were alone and the world feels
8505160	8509640	completely alien despite the familiar setting of a forest if sky remembers I
8509640	8514520	made a little big planet level in the same style called UFO story and then
8514520	8519620	they came it was gray silhouettes foggy and add strange lighting effects limbo
8519620	8524400	even had a tire swing at the beginning of the game I'm taking no credit though
8524400	8528800	it had to be coincidence plus my little big planet level is nowhere near as good
8528800	8533500	as limbo in fact it gets tedious although I'm very proud of the spinning
8533500	8538960	boss at the end that foggy gray noir setting is nothing new in games by the
8538960	8543000	way it took me a good 80 hours to make that little big planet level a little
8543000	8548040	bit construction is not for the dabbler a somewhat okay level takes 80 hours I
8548040	8552880	wonder what a good or great level to ice I do remember that level and when I read
8552880	8556440	the email earlier this week I actually was like oh yeah it kind of did have
8556440	8559840	that same kind of look and feel to it it's kind of funny I I totally remember
8559840	8563160	what you talk about Robert but he says I'm going to Disney World again
8563160	8567680	probably bring me back some pins jerk I want to go to Disney World pins can I go
8567680	8577960	to Disney World Rob and I trade pins last one is from Troy hey olr Troy again
8577960	8583200	have you guys seen the new Halo Reach Forge mode I don't know how big of the
8583200	8587800	FPS fans you guys are but if you like Halo the new Forge is like a little big
8587800	8593360	planet for Halo also I went on a super stardust HD week and hopefully made it
8593360	8597600	pretty high on the ranking list for the big battle also people who have the
8597600	8601400	games are listening really should join the big battle I know I was bored of
8601400	8605240	video games so this came up and now I think I left competitive gaming again
8605240	8610640	that's it oh well I'm sure the folks that put that all together will be very
8610640	8618080	nice to hear that yeah very happy to hear that okay let's move on
8618080	8622080	angst this is the part of the show where we get out our angst it's called the F
8622080	8628280	use of the week
8639280	8647040	okay the first one would be me witness a few to the hole in my hand because okay
8647040	8651360	it was fine with this just the stitches cuz it would pull a little bit and it
8651360	8656960	was alright but now it's like my hand is a lot more sore than it was last week
8656960	8660840	since the stitches came out especially with that hole that now I have to do
8660840	8667040	extra stuff to keep it closed and worth thick bandages on my palm it just makes
8667040	8672200	my hand hurt a whole lot more and the sad thing with that is that typing on my
8672200	8679640	keyboard hurts a lot and like I'll message people a little bit but like
8679640	8684320	using my mouse hurts too but if I'm doing the two of them together then it
8684320	8688360	really hurts and that's actually made it hard for me to play Star Trek online so
8688360	8691160	I haven't been doing all the gaming haven't been really doing that much
8691160	8696680	chatting online or anything it's just it's just really sore it's actually the
8696680	8700880	whole the weird problem about it is that even though it's sore up at the top of
8700880	8705080	my palm the back of my hand is really sore too and I think it's where the
8705080	8709800	bruise was left over from where they did the blood drain so I'm just sore and it
8709800	8716060	makes me a grumpy grumpy grumpy girl like grumpier than usual that's really
8716060	8725240	grumpy alright you need some more vitamin B no I don't need more vitamin B
8725240	8729800	I need ice cream look I want ice cream I don't work
8729800	8739120	tomorrow just saying Loki um f you to whoever was causing some crime today on
8739120	8744360	greenback lane they actually have the whole street blocked off with again tape
8744360	8751120	it was ridiculous so I had to go way around it and I just like that and bad
8751120	8756280	drivers people stop being stupid like just in general like I'm not talking
8756280	8758880	listeners of the show clearly or not stupid because you're listening to this
8758880	8761960	show but just like the people out there instead of listening to the show that
8761960	8766280	are out there on greenback Avenue shooting each other stop being stupid
8766280	8774320	seriously serious all right let's see my f you of the week I'm gonna give an F
8774320	8778840	you to Apple I know Loki's in heaven right now but I think it's total
8778840	8783680	bullshit that they release this OS that screws up my old phone forcing me to get
8783680	8789640	a new phone but the new phone is not available anywhere bullshit I'm actually
8789640	8793000	contemplating getting a different phone right now because I'm thinking like I
8793000	8797080	need the iPad who does everything the phone does but then I'm still I know I'm
8797080	8801880	still biting the hand that I want to protest and I'm just a hypocrite and
8801880	8806080	blah blah blah blah but let's face it the iPhone is now kind of a gaming
8806080	8810400	platform there's a lot of missing out on if I don't have one slices pop what are
8810400	8815880	your F use of the week F you to the month of July I'm usually endeared to
8815880	8819320	this month because it's my birthday month but a lot of people that I follow
8819320	8823760	on live journal that I've been reading for years have been having to deal with
8823760	8829080	sudden deaths of like family members and their partners and I have a friend who
8829080	8833560	had to have ankle surgery due to complications from his ankle surgery he
8833560	8839440	now has pneumonia figure that one out so yeah it's been a really hard month for a
8839440	8843320	lot of people that I care about online so that just sucks that I can't really
8843320	8847480	be there for them because they live far away if you had a distance and people
8847480	8852680	that are far away that you can't like be there for yeah I get that sucks all
8852680	8858720	right I have another one quickly my brother's crazy F you to his brain
8858720	8866160	disease mine too but in a whole different way you know holy he's a he's
8866160	8869400	a special kind of crazy but we won't get into that on this episode of Ricky
8869400	8873200	lake alright Loki is some gaming news and then we'll get to the skype line at
8873200	8881400	1877 game olr Loki yes not to be outdone by Google YouTube also has an Easter egg
8881400	8888040	on it that allows you to play a game apparently if you go to Google or not
8888040	8892560	Google YouTube it's owned by Google now so it doesn't matter if you go to
8892560	8900000	youtube.com and pull up any video whatever hold down the left arrow on
8900000	8905440	your keyboard and after a few seconds you should be able to play the game
8905440	8913840	snake over the top I got a sneak man I used to love snake on the old cell phones
8913840	8918520	fun fun times that's what I need to do I'm gonna go trade in my iPhone and go
8918520	8922160	get me like one of those like old ass Nokia phones that have snake on it good
8922160	8928320	times it does still work you can probably get snake for iPhone it's not
8928320	8937200	the same it's not the same as much as I appreciate why we are one of the
8937200	8941400	listeners of the show and I do I do think snake 360 is a good game it's just
8941400	8945040	not the same as playing it on the old school cell phone you know what I mean
8945040	8950080	you're right one other story for you guys then we're gonna get to the
8950080	8955920	skyline 877 game olr yada yada this is about Starcraft 2 this is Starcraft 2
8955920	8961200	story they're saying the launch for this is going to be big big huge gigantic
8961200	8965040	because you know lots of stores are doing the midnight releases of course
8965040	8968920	this game's been what like 10 years in the making blizzard is not saying how
8968920	8971480	many copies of the game has been pre-ordered because they don't get into
8971480	8975840	that but they are saying that it's it's gonna be big there's these midnight
8975840	8980680	launch events everywhere it's a $60 game it's number one and number two on Amazon
8980680	8984680	right now because obviously there's a regular and collector's edition it's
8984680	8989160	been in the top 100 best-selling games for over three months Walmart staying
8989160	8995320	open late GameStops Best Buys and so forth they're the this story that I'm
8995320	8999200	reading from the Orange County Register which is not a video game site
8999200	9003560	specifically it's more of a blizzard obviously is in Anaheim which is kind of
9003560	9007560	Orange County they are talking about this 18 year old who apparently plans to
9007560	9012720	wait 72 hours in line for Starcraft 2 when asked why he said it's really hard
9012720	9015720	to explain I don't know it's just something I'm crazy enough to enjoy I
9015720	9019640	guess if people can stand in line for Twilight for that long I guess they can
9019640	9025800	do it for Starcraft 2 anyhow World of Warcraft Wrath of the Lich King sold 2.8
9025800	9029600	million copies when it came out in the first 24 hours they think this could
9029600	9035440	possibly top it one thing though that is not going to help sell the game is
9035440	9040720	reviews there will be no reviews of Starcraft 2 Wings of Liberty before it
9040720	9045360	launches on Tuesday the press will be reviewing the game when everybody else
9045360	9049760	does I guess the publisher feels that the battle net service and the online
9049760	9054520	features is so essential to the game that opening them up early when it's not
9054520	9058080	really ready to go for the press to review it could be detrimental to the
9058080	9062240	game yeah because people will pirate it like they've already know the copies
9062240	9065080	have already come out but you can't play it until the battle that servers are up
9065080	9070840	there's gonna be a day one patch for the game in order to give the developer
9070840	9074560	quote a little bit more time to sort of get their ducks in a row that's
9074560	9077760	basically telling me the game's not really totally ready and it comes out Oh
9077760	9082440	Tuesday so kind of what Alan was saying earlier why don't you just wait three
9082440	9086560	months for them to just actually get the game working there's a lot of pressure
9086560	9090120	on it Blizzard right now because if this game is fails on launch day it's gonna
9090120	9093520	be a lot of shit for it I will say this I don't know if I can stand to wait
9093520	9097120	three months but I am gonna wait for the reviews of the game I think that's pretty
9097120	9101560	bold of Blizzard to say yeah we're not gonna send out our game for review it'll
9101560	9105000	sell without it yeah I'm a little confused because I know that a lot of
9105000	9109040	the major review sites to get their copy two weeks early but they're just not
9109040	9113560	allowed to publish the story until release date in which case all the sites
9113560	9116240	try to scoop each other so does this mean that they're not getting the game
9116240	9119680	at all I don't know they're not really saying for sure but they can't play it
9119680	9124280	even if they have it they can't play it well and a lot of times they can do some
9124280	9128080	really shady shit with those embargoes too because a lot of times you can break
9128080	9133600	the embargo if you gave the game a 90% or better like that shit really happens
9133600	9137640	out there and it's kind of sick like and that's why you know we're here about
9137640	9141200	really supporting the independent media because we don't have to really play by
9141200	9145040	those rules granted we don't get the early copies of the games because of it
9145040	9149960	but you know just keep in mind if this site got a world exclusive review and
9149960	9154520	it's like the first to run with it if that review is an a or something of the
9154520	9158800	equivalent a question it you should question it because they could very well
9158800	9161280	be doing it especially if it's a no-name site trying to get the additional
9161280	9167520	traffic they could be doing it just to get the traffic kind of sad
9167520	9173400	toa gak in our chair him says code your damn games on time or admit failure damn
9173400	9179360	these day one patches I don't think the game is going to be like terrible but
9179360	9183840	it's going to be interesting to see if the servers can handle at day one it's
9183840	9188800	gonna be a big demand big big demand the internet will come to a screeching halt
9188800	9197080	this week chaos all right let's open up the Skype line at 1 877 game olr our
9197080	9201920	username on Skype is orange lounge radio that's all one word please if you were

9209920	9214320	test call and you can easily hear if your sound settings are okay because
9214320	9219640	when we pick up and no one's there it's a little bit frustrating all right while

9222680	9229840	do not looky I do but I'll have to look them up I thought yes I'm ready to go

9239440	9243840	wrong everyone hey Rama you're the master of zerg rushing our phones what's
9243840	9255360	up the first thing I want to bring up is
9255360	9261000	what you said about the guy that was online for 72 hours for Starcraft 2 he's
9261000	9266960	standing in line yes I think that you know that I was on the line for the week
9266960	9271080	and I was out there for you about a day and a half there were people out there my
9271080	9275480	older brother was out there no my younger brother that this is Thursday
9275480	9280600	for okay Wow by the way don't adjust your sound Rama is cutting in and out
9280600	9286520	we're not sure why I don't know if it's your speakers or mate they might buy and
9286520	9291560	some make this quick and just get going for Torrance okay go ahead I'm not
9291560	9297320	running in porn torrents I'm not Loki all right I don't want my porn I
9297320	9302280	downloaded off Houston okay anyway Rama yes you were you were in line just as
9302280	9306360	long okay I get it but you're also black Luigi you have to be out there I mean
9306360	9311440	like it's not a Nintendo party without black Luigi I suppose so but I just say
9311440	9315840	you can't go out for something like that cuz we've all done this I mean you guys
9315840	9318920	got it didn't get on the line for the week she was out there interviewing
9318920	9323160	people handing out stuff you know because it was total promotion for our
9323160	9326600	show cuz you know we can't afford million dollar ads no I mean we got into
9326600	9332400	it extra for waited in the line he was but I waited in line whether we keep in
9332400	9337240	mind to this is important if we hadn't waited in line we wouldn't have got one
9337240	9341840	there's gonna be plenty of Starcraft 2 available day one it's not gonna sell
9341840	9346800	out like crazy you're gonna be able to find it but you know if software is a
9346800	9350600	lot easier to make than hardware right
9350600	9358280	true true but still I'm just saying you shouldn't get a hard time I'm not giving
9358280	9361800	him that hard a time I'm just kind of I just putting that in the same category
9361800	9372040	is waiting for Twilight that's that's okay that's I guess tomato all right
9372040	9376840	well what else is on your mind before we let you go Rama
9376840	9381280	earlier in the show about that but the law that California is trying to pass
9381280	9385840	many of the states are jumping on the bandwagon mm-hmm passes is not gonna do
9385840	9391760	a lick of damage I've seen plenty of time at best by people that aren't 17
9391760	9397240	buying emory games it pops up on the registered check ID they use it to keep
9397240	9402440	entered bypass to keep going yeah but now it's gonna be illegal and those
9402440	9406200	people could be personally responsible if they do that so that behavior might
9406200	9413680	change pretty soon it depends on me I don't think it's going to change unless
9413680	9418360	saying the ruling that at the source quite doing this is going to get fined
9418360	9421880	for it you know what I'm saying let's try this way I bet you can agree with
9421880	9427400	this Rama if a 16 year old wants to get a dirty game that 16 year old will get
9427400	9433760	the dirty game lobby damned right pretty much then there you have it so it's up
9433760	9438320	to the parents to make sure that the 16 year olds don't get the games you don't
9438320	9442040	want them playing Rama I better let you go so we can get some more calls and you
9442040	9444480	can see what's up with your connection problem but thanks so much for your call

9450000	9454840	what's black Luigi that's what we call Rama cuz he's black and he cosplays as
9454840	9459520	Luigi and he always seems to get on camera whenever you know he's at one of
9459520	9463240	these Nintendo events like when he on CNN or something for the Wii event I
9463240	9469560	don't know but he's black Luigi alright let's take some more calls at 1 8 7 7
9469560	9474520	game olr our username on skype is orange lounge radio she gets some time time to
9474520	9477920	round up some stories Loki yeah well too bad because we got another call coming
9477920	9481560	in I didn't want to see all right then hi you're on orange launch radio who's
9481560	9486880	this this is new Steve misty well how are you we haven't heard from you in a
9486880	9493000	while I'm doing pretty good I was thinking that to run the being in the
9493000	9500360	show where you where you're basically like we've had a shit ton of guests lately yes we haven't but I
9500360	9506120	thought I'd like to confirm one that's gonna be on the show on August 8th who
9506120	9511600	would that be that would be me oh you're coming back huh
9511600	9517600	yep I decided to suck it up and fly oh god it's gonna be a bunch of women here
9517600	9522560	let's I really hope I really hope I really hope that's not the weekend that
9522560	9526960	Nellie has the baby because then Loki won't be here and I'll be surrounded by
9526960	9532680	women no I'm just I'm I'm messing around it'll be okay well that's great are you
9532680	9536360	now I get asked this question because um I don't know if we talked about it last
9536360	9540080	time you were here but you do not like to fly and last time you came out here
9540080	9545480	you took Greyhound out here and a little bit of the train too I think what are
9545480	9551520	you doing this time are you are I thought there was a train involved
9551520	9556040	somehow so what are you doing this time are you doing the but you know pushing
9556040	9567800	the numbers won't do anything right I won't suddenly speak in Spanish for
9567800	9575680	English press one para espanol maki numero dos all right no uh so so what
9575680	9580480	are you doing this time are you doing the the Greyhound thing again what I'm
9580480	9585520	going to get out there is I'm flying Southwest from St. Louis to LA taking
9585520	9590640	Amtrak overnight from LA to Sacramento and then then on the way back home I'm
9590640	9595160	taking the bus well Southwest is basically a Greyhound bus with wings so
9595160	9602080	I enjoy that it'll be fine now have you ever flown before like ever no I'll give
9602080	9606180	you a tip I want to be on the damn show if you're if you're anxious about it
9606180	9610760	Misty and it makes you nervous just take like half a Tylenol PM right before you
9610760	9614000	get on the flight and then you'll fall right asleep and it'll it'll help the
9614000	9617580	anxiety not that I advocate like taking meds and drugs and stuff but you know
9617580	9622360	and again if I don't know like if you I'm not your doctor so you might want to
9622360	9625760	ask somebody because I don't know what other medications you take and I hate to
9625760	9629360	you know have you mix I don't know what else you take and Tylenol may not mix
9629360	9634440	but just take a sleep aid that's approved by your doctor and you know
9634440	9639320	that that might help with the pain or the not the pain but the anxiety because
9639320	9642080	I've had friends that have to do that they get really anxious especially if
9642080	9646560	there's gonna be turbulence or anything which flying to LA you I think you get
9646560	9649200	to dodge the Rockies a little bit I don't think you'll fly right over them
9649200	9652760	and that's where the worst turbulence is but it'll be fine I fly all the time
9652760	9657120	it's fine in fact you know what you probably saw on the news not that far
9657120	9661040	here from Sacramento there's a horrible Greyhound bus accident and I would have
9661040	9665840	been extremely sad if Misty had been on that bus so I think you'll be alright
9665840	9670400	with flying. I didn't read that yet but keep in mind my computer's back I'm limited to
9670400	9677440	doing shit on my iPod right now hmm well you're gonna be you're gonna be just
9677440	9682600	fine with that flight. I do not drink and you know that all right all right I'll let you go so
9682600	9687160	you can go beat up some chatters with your fist so we'll see and you can yell
9687160	9691520	at them in person when you're here in a couple weeks so we'll see you then all
9691520	9698040	right take care. Misty's gonna be on the show. I had to make sure that I was
9698040	9700560	actually gonna be here cuz I was worried for me that she was only here for the
9700560	9704560	weekend what's that say um she's gonna be on the 8th I think that's the night
9704560	9708360	after showgirls it is the night after showgirls so I'll be but I'll be back in
9708360	9710780	town on the 8th because I usually come so I'll be here she's here during the
9710780	9714200	week I guess so we'll have to all get Indian food or something I don't know
9714200	9717440	cuz she foods what are we gonna do with Misty what do you do a Misty for like
9717440	9724560	four days I was thinking going to Dave and Buster's and going to our big old
9724560	9730240	land maybe and let's go order a dumpster the little ghetto arcade over there
9730240	9734040	with Para Para is it'd be fun cuz she really wants to play Para Para be fun
9734040	9738600	let's go to another call hi you're on orange lounge radio for English press
9738600	9745600	one para espanol no I'm kidding hi who's this hey this is excellent hi x-link
9745600	9748920	what's on your mind hey actually I want to call back everything's first off
9748920	9752600	about the law I'm I lived here in Florida which is probably supposedly be
9752600	9756040	one of the states which I really don't think it's gonna pass personally like
9756040	9759000	Rama said I really think that it's gonna go through a lot of loopholes before
9759000	9763920	anything gets passed look through a lot of these different states a lot of the
9763920	9769480	companies too I noticing now are trying to do things so they won't get in
9769480	9774440	trouble it god forbid it's something like this would pass recently I bought
9774440	9778760	something I bought a computer game from Target the file collection and I was
9778760	9784760	surprised that I got ID for it which took me by surprise because the first
9784760	9787760	time ever buying a game from say like Target or someplace like that where I
9787760	9793240	actually got carded for the game for being mature so it was very shocking to
9793240	9796040	say the least but it was very cool though because at least it shows that
9796040	9799160	they're trying to take the appropriate steps to make sure something does
9799160	9803680	happen but you but I agree with you there is a bad point they're making all
9803680	9807580	these steps to block these mature rate games but a lot of times with these are
9807580	9811360	a movies they're not doing anything it's like oh they're worth their parents so
9811360	9815800	it has to be okay so you know but it's like almost like a double standard in a
9815800	9819280	way I'll look at it excellent how do you have time to play Fallout you play just
9819280	9822440	as much Wow as I do and I don't have time for other video games like how do
9822440	9827240	you do it now I got it mostly for the collection now because I have three
9827240	9830900	already so I said well if I got three I might look at one and two and tactics to
9830900	9833640	put in with it because I had one or two before a long time ago before
9833640	9839480	unfortunately my mom's place which had all my games and was arson so I lost a
9839480	9846120	lot of games that I had that's terrible oh man well sorry to hear it but now
9846120	9849680	glad you're it's like building the second frontier I like I can't believe
9849680	9854240	you're sitting there bashing it it was actually it wasn't great it wasn't the
9854240	9858360	best but it would the storyline was alright and besides you can play some
9858360	9862000	like going around game I love how you're lowering the bar as you're reviewing it
9862000	9867440	well wasn't that good when that you know it's you know it's there's always one at
9867440	9873720	every party huh you know it's all good I won't judge you for it

9911880	9915960	just kidding what is a look you got for last minute stories dead rising to case
9915960	9921000	zero be coming out on Xbox live arcade August 31st of course it'll be kind of a
9921000	9927240	prequel or in-between sequel for the dead rising series it takes place
9927240	9935360	between dead rising a one and two and also you'll be able to kind of level up
9935360	9941680	your character and stuff that you earn in that game will also transfer over to
9941680	9946320	dead rising to the best thing about it though it will only cost you five
9946320	9953720	dollars so that is awesome for what may be considered I've seen anything on
9953720	9961240	arcade for five dollars a long time exactly see Netflix is apparently going
9961240	9966280	diskless by October so they're gonna eventually have an app or you may say
