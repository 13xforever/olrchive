congratulations because my hand still has a hole in it there's a part that the

01:43.880 --> 01:47.840
stitches didn't clear up all the way so I put pictures on Facebook to show my

01:47.840 --> 01:53.200
mommy which is why I put them on Facebook is to show my mommy and I'm

01:53.200 --> 01:57.920
still quite bandaged up although not to the extent I was last time and it hurts

01:57.920 --> 02:02.280
as Rob it hurts us have you been able to play any video games at least um yes

02:02.280 --> 02:06.080
which we will get to in my gaming week yes which we'll get to in just a minute

02:06.080 --> 02:09.240
but I couldn't start the show without introducing the one and only tech master

02:09.240 --> 02:13.640
Loki you could it just wouldn't be as good probably not but don't let your ego

02:13.640 --> 02:15.880
get too big how you doing Loki I'm doing fine

02:15.880 --> 02:21.240
what's new in Loki's world you guys finished the nursery right or you're

02:21.240 --> 02:25.680
really close it's he's been inhaling a lot of paint fumes we have just very few

02:25.680 --> 02:30.240
things left to do on it it's it's pretty much done it's just like the finishing

02:30.240 --> 02:34.840
touches I guess we have to like shade the hills or put a little highlight on

02:34.840 --> 02:41.080
them which site to mix some paint with this like blending medium stuff to make

02:41.080 --> 02:49.080
it very transparent and then I have to paint one more hill and just like some

02:49.080 --> 02:52.920
small stuff but it's basically done I would have taken more pictures but now

02:52.920 --> 02:55.920
they said that you know I shouldn't take any more pictures until it's done

02:55.920 --> 03:00.440
because it ruins the Wow effect all right well we'll be waiting to be wowed

03:00.440 --> 03:05.840
it won't be as much of an epic mount all right let's also introduce we do have a

03:05.840 --> 03:08.460
special guest here in studio we've been having a lot of extra people in studio

03:08.460 --> 03:11.080
lately that's a good thing we like I'm having another person here to kind of

03:11.080 --> 03:15.060
mix things up a little bit tonight is somebody you've heard over the past few

03:15.060 --> 03:19.800

03:26.320 --> 03:30.840
afraid just treat that microphone like it's ice cream all right there you go so

03:30.840 --> 03:35.720
what's new in your world how you doing not much yeah got some new games for my

03:35.720 --> 03:40.480
birthday that I'll be talking about okay sounds good so we'll get to those in a

03:40.480 --> 03:44.760
little bit and for those that may not know you have the unique distinction of

03:44.760 --> 03:47.840
also being my boyfriend yes to which I'm sure a lot of the listeners are like oh

03:47.840 --> 03:52.400
that poor guy but yeah so we went we went out last night actually we went to

03:52.400 --> 03:58.040
see I'm Adam Lambert in concert yes we did speaking of of gays Wow yeah right

03:58.040 --> 04:02.400
no here's no I mean is he any good cuz like I just remember like I hope he

04:02.400 --> 04:06.400
wins cuz I don't like the other person and then he lost well here's the thing

04:06.400 --> 04:11.680
it was my mom's idea okay my mom I'm not surprised my mom is the one that wanted

04:11.680 --> 04:15.400
to go and she bought the tickets but then she pulled out and decided not to

04:15.400 --> 04:18.480
go because her knees been bothering her lately and she was really scared about

04:18.480 --> 04:22.480
walking up and down the stairs and everything and I kind of feel bad but

04:22.480 --> 04:25.160
that's just the kind of person my mom is when she kind of makes her mind up there

04:25.160 --> 04:30.040
ain't no change in it so we went instead with some other friends and you know I

04:30.040 --> 04:34.280
don't know I I thought it was fine but it was weird that people were getting

04:34.280 --> 04:38.400
into a fight I don't know what'd you think of the concert I'm not really into

04:38.400 --> 04:42.260
American Idol at all and when Adam Lambert was getting hyped up I was like

04:42.260 --> 04:45.880
okay I get it but I just wasn't really a fan like I'm not really that into his

04:45.880 --> 04:49.920
music but he has a great voice and he put on a great show I like him more now

04:49.920 --> 04:53.400
having seen him live than I did from just watching him on TV I want his hair

04:53.400 --> 04:59.040
I'd say won me over his wig I'm sure I can't be real that his do can't be real

04:59.040 --> 05:01.680
tell us tell tell the listeners real quick about the fight we will get to

05:01.680 --> 05:06.120
video games I promise so we were up in the bleachers way in the back and about

05:06.120 --> 05:11.720
three rows in front of us off to the left a fight well not a real fight but

05:11.720 --> 05:15.440
um these ladies were dancing and standing up and having a good time

05:15.440 --> 05:20.920
Lamas yeah glamos we're standing up dancing as one would at a rock concert

05:20.920 --> 05:26.360
and this sort of drunk resentful husband who was probably dragged there by his

05:26.360 --> 05:29.880
wife really took offense to the fact that they were standing and he decided

05:29.880 --> 05:32.960
to call them out and get really belligerent cuz you need to know the

05:32.960 --> 05:36.800
crowd was totally like the Real Housewives of Sacramento County I mean

05:36.800 --> 05:41.040
Deena Lohan's all over wherever you look yeah I think on the Venn diagram of

05:41.040 --> 05:44.840
shame there's definitely some overlap between Adam Lambert fans and like

05:44.840 --> 05:51.640
twi-moms I think there are a lot of yeah yeah quite a bit so we got to watch

05:51.640 --> 05:56.680
security come in and yes security had gave them a stern talking to put it so

05:56.680 --> 05:59.880
there was a point where I was like am I serious because I've gone to a lot of

05:59.880 --> 06:03.960
concerts before and I've never seen a fight so it's like am I really gonna see

06:03.960 --> 06:08.720
people throw down at Adam Lambert like is this is this real life yeah it's

06:08.720 --> 06:11.480
pretty pretty surreal well here's the other thing that you need to know about

06:11.480 --> 06:16.040
the concert it was that a Indian casino which we have quite a few of those here

06:16.040 --> 06:19.840
in California so it's you know obviously it's on Native American land and they

06:19.840 --> 06:24.400
can have gambling and smoking and and all that good stuff so we actually went

06:24.400 --> 06:29.800
into casino after the show and I'm kind of shocked at how much the worlds of

06:29.800 --> 06:33.960
gaming and gambling are starting to fuse closer together you may not be aware of

06:33.960 --> 06:37.160
this but a lot of gaming companies are also in the business of making like

06:37.160 --> 06:40.560
gambling devices like Konami is one of the big ones actually they're probably

06:40.560 --> 06:44.400
making more money right now on some of their gambling machines and one of the

06:44.400 --> 06:49.600
machines that we saw in there was this gigantic wheel of fortune slot machine

06:49.600 --> 06:52.800
and it's not like I mean there's been wheel of fortune slot machine for years

06:52.800 --> 06:57.600
but there's a huge mungus wall-sized one yes yeah it looks like Derby owners Club

06:57.600 --> 07:01.560
to me like remember I thought you were talking about like the five cent of the

07:01.560 --> 07:05.240
nickel slots where they had like there's that too but now there's one with a

07:05.240 --> 07:09.600
giant monitor and I guess the bonus round on that one you touch letters to

07:09.600 --> 07:12.840
complete the puzzle on the giant board and it's multiple players doing it at

07:12.840 --> 07:16.760
once it's weird and they have Vanna White like the real Vanna White doing

07:16.760 --> 07:20.240
record like she's the bumpers between rounds like good luck everybody and it's

07:20.240 --> 07:24.720
really her in HD it's very creepy but what's also creepy like isn't she like

07:24.720 --> 07:28.320
80 years old and she still looks like she's like 30 like she's made a pact

07:28.320 --> 07:34.240
with the devil clearly plastic surgery she's just using what you know what some

07:34.240 --> 07:39.040
of that stuff different cosmetics from Umbrella corporation you know to keep

07:39.040 --> 07:43.480
her cells nice and rejuvenated well you've seen that movie death becomes her

07:43.480 --> 07:49.680
she made a porcelain Wow she's ceramic I did I did have to talk to one lady

07:49.680 --> 07:52.680
though in the casino because she had her sign with her that said I'm 70 and I

07:52.680 --> 07:56.960
love Adam because she reminded me of my mom because my mom's also just about 70

07:56.960 --> 08:01.960
she's 69 anyway okay enough Adam I swear that is like the most Adam Lambert chat

08:01.960 --> 08:05.840
you'll ever hear on orange lounge radio I apologize but we do talk about video

08:05.840 --> 08:08.200

incentive to join us exactly that's why I do this all right to lure them well

08:55.600 --> 08:59.900
let's talk about gaming weeks let's get less Adam more video games dark soccer

08:59.900 --> 09:04.940
how was your gaming week mine was fairly epic Rob I did lots of gaming actually

09:04.940 --> 09:10.880
such for being an invalid such as Dan and I took the last of our our spare

09:10.880 --> 09:16.100
money now we're dirt broke waiting on our government checks to arrive he's on

09:16.100 --> 09:21.800
unemployment I'm on disability okay we went to Dave and Buster's it's small oh

09:21.800 --> 09:27.200
the new one here in Roseville it's tiny and loud oh my god loud and but we

09:27.200 --> 09:38.520
played wait your mic is totally cut out you got to check the the connection is

09:38.520 --> 09:47.040
wrong sorry guys live radio Jamie's mic is doing weird stuff go ahead no you're

09:47.040 --> 09:53.120
still out I don't know what I pushed I pushed it in Rob I don't know what's

09:53.120 --> 09:59.040
going on anyway so it played this tank game that Namco put out I don't remember

09:59.040 --> 10:03.320
what's called it was pretty fun I played a lot of games to try to win a blender

10:03.320 --> 10:10.200
because I really need a new blender apparently um and we did this typhoon

10:10.200 --> 10:16.360
thing which is more like a ride and they had a they do like a minecart one no you

10:16.360 --> 10:19.840
your mic you get can you guys switch okay I don't know what's going on with

10:19.840 --> 10:24.520
my hey is this well I'm yeah it's much better all right go ahead anyway so we

10:24.520 --> 10:28.000
played the tank game that Namco did we played this typhoon thing which is like

10:28.000 --> 10:34.560
a bunch of different rides all in one and we did a pinball one which was kind

10:34.560 --> 10:37.200
of throws you around a pinball game it was pretty cool because of course we had

10:37.200 --> 10:49.360
to do pinball and then we I played more more token stuff and then I started

10:49.360 --> 10:54.760
playing Ragnarok online again which because it's easier to do with my hand

10:54.760 --> 10:59.560
being kind of messed up but I did play some Star Trek online and I'm at captain

10:59.560 --> 11:04.520
eight now what exactly does captain eight mean it means that I've got two

11:04.520 --> 11:10.360
more levels until I'm rear Admiral pretty much so those like levels in

11:10.360 --> 11:15.200
other MMOs okay okay cuz like you start off because you know they're set up like

11:15.200 --> 11:18.960
a military organization they go by rank and then you've got divisions in each

11:18.960 --> 11:24.680
rank so so I'm getting up there actually I found out that while a lot of the

11:24.680 --> 11:30.240
earlier missions are lame the upper captain level and Admiral level missions

11:30.240 --> 11:35.040
are really freaking fun so I've been having a good time it's especially funny

11:35.040 --> 11:40.280
watching although I have I've had such a hard time playing when I've just taken

11:40.280 --> 11:44.580
my Vicodin because then I can't I totally focus on one thing when I'm on

11:44.580 --> 11:50.880
Vicodin it's like I have instead of a DD I have like hyper focus disorder or

11:50.880 --> 11:55.260
something and get fixated on one major thing at a time so it's really kind of

11:55.260 --> 12:00.840
hard to multitask hence me looking at all these pictures during the show and

12:00.840 --> 12:06.360
not being able to look away from them I don't know what you're talking about

12:06.360 --> 12:17.200
dork anyway and I did other games what did I do oh yeah I started this what's

12:17.200 --> 12:23.880
that professor top hat game professor Layton no not professor Layton it's like

12:23.880 --> 12:31.200
a combination of platformer and puzzle game and it's this guy I'm gonna hold on

12:31.200 --> 12:39.080
a second is that the new one on Steam no no no no it's a gameplay game and you'd

12:39.080 --> 12:43.560
like have to find the golden suit is this really bizarre little game that

12:43.560 --> 12:48.780
it's it's also it's awfully cutesy and I was surprised that Dan suggested it to

12:48.780 --> 12:52.500
me to play but it's really it's really fun I've been playing a little bit of

12:52.500 --> 12:57.320
that and some trying to go back and play Oh end on except I'm right-handed my

12:57.320 --> 13:02.520
stitches are on my right hand so well my incision is on my right hand so I can't

13:02.520 --> 13:07.960
play a wind on very well especially again when I'm on Vicodin so I gotta

13:07.960 --> 13:11.320
tell you guys before the show I said something and Jamie flipped me off and

13:11.320 --> 13:14.080
it actually put her in pain because she's like I haven't flipped anyone off

13:14.080 --> 13:18.840
since I had my surgery Rob's the first person I flipped off and because the

13:18.840 --> 13:22.160
whole thing is that my flexibility is coming back in my hand and I can make a

13:22.160 --> 13:26.480
sword of fist and I can sort of extend it except I can't apparently make a fist

13:26.480 --> 13:31.160
and extend a finger at the same time cuz then it hurts and maybe you want to cry

13:31.160 --> 13:38.880
and I blame Rob because Rob evoked the finger well you wouldn't bet go bake me

13:38.880 --> 13:44.600
a pie that's what I asked bake your own damn pie all right I'm a guacamole though

13:44.600 --> 13:53.840
you have some guacamole I'm I had but I'm full of chips oh what else I don't

13:53.840 --> 13:58.760
remember no I'd be taking effect everybody no I played I played mahjong

13:58.760 --> 14:06.160
before class my netbook and I found that my SNES my next emulator works very well

14:06.160 --> 14:12.080
for Linux on my netbook so I can play Super Nintendo games before class you

14:12.080 --> 14:14.840
should check out the Castlevania puzzle game that just came out on iPhone

14:14.840 --> 14:17.920
because although it looked really weird from the screenshots I've been hearing a

14:17.920 --> 14:21.080
lot of good things about it I just picked it up actually because I had

14:21.080 --> 14:25.560
$40 worth of iTunes credit for my birthday from various gift cards so I

14:25.560 --> 14:28.800
picked it up was like four or five bucks I don't remember and it just kind of

14:28.800 --> 14:31.160
made me think of you because I know you're big Castlevania fangirl you like

14:31.160 --> 14:35.680
puzzle games too I was wanting to play it but I I almost downloaded the Silent

14:35.680 --> 14:39.360
Hill game and no no the Silent Hill games junk it's on my phone if you wanna

14:39.360 --> 14:42.680
play it it's not that great it's like it's like a first-person thing it's it

14:42.680 --> 14:48.000
does it's not like the actual Silent Hill games at all but um and then we've

14:48.000 --> 14:53.360
also been redoing the vault Dan and I and we've decided well I decided this

14:53.360 --> 14:58.040
and he better go along with it or else that we're gonna play play through Sonic

14:58.040 --> 15:02.840
Adventure I like how you have like the dual TVs all set up in there you know

15:02.840 --> 15:12.200
they were huh they were Xbox Oh monitors from kiosk from certain stores kiosks

15:12.200 --> 15:15.880
okay well no and Dan was just told that he could take everything so we've got

15:15.880 --> 15:20.640
like broken Xboxes and broken Wiis and semi working Wiis and a bunch of cables

15:20.640 --> 15:26.320
and those monitors and crap so he's putting them to proper use in the vault

15:26.320 --> 15:30.000
and I'll put up those pictures of the vault in progress all right so in fact

15:30.000 --> 15:33.680
I'll go do that right now I'm gonna find the name of that game because it's gonna

15:33.680 --> 15:37.240
bother the crap out of me until I figure it out all right so when Jamie runs in

15:37.240 --> 15:41.080
here and yells something completely random that's the aim all right Loki how

15:41.080 --> 15:44.840
is your gaming week now you have to stop looking at pictures what are those SD

15:44.840 --> 15:50.520
cards you SD card compact flash cards and yes I am shopping for compact flash

15:50.520 --> 15:55.920
cards for something I'm working on because I can't go without having six

15:55.920 --> 15:59.400
projects at one time although I did cancel one project because I don't

15:59.400 --> 16:04.320
really give a crap about making it you know cardboard arcade cabinet anymore

16:04.320 --> 16:08.720
what project oh the project under 100 hundred dollars name that sounded cool

16:08.720 --> 16:12.120
the other people have already done that they have like one that's actually a

16:12.120 --> 16:15.480
maim system that's under $100 and basically this would be the same thing

16:15.480 --> 16:21.680
just you know the cabinet would you know be kind of free because it'd be made out

16:21.680 --> 16:26.000
of cardboard but I just don't care and I may do it later but you know I know

16:26.000 --> 16:30.880
whatever so I have spare parts at home um no but what I was working on was

16:30.880 --> 16:35.720
actually can't hear you I want to interject what were you interjecting is

16:35.720 --> 16:44.840
Henry hats worth in the puzzling adventure okay I could told you that so

16:44.840 --> 16:50.480
yeah what I'm working on right now my friend gave me one of these old I don't

16:50.480 --> 16:53.960
even know what they are they're like remember those tiger electronics games

16:53.960 --> 16:59.080
and stuff not necessarily like game and watch but something similar that and

16:59.080 --> 17:04.920
it's a Frogger game it's set up inside of what looks like a bar top arcade

17:04.920 --> 17:09.720
cabinet except it's just plastic and it's really tiny and I was looking at

17:09.720 --> 17:12.960
him like cuz then you know the first thing that comes to my mind for anything

17:12.960 --> 17:17.160
it's like I wonder if I could put an arcade game inside this thing and so

17:17.160 --> 17:21.560
I've kind of challenged myself to do that for no apparent reason what I've

17:21.560 --> 17:26.320
seen that before like the little bit like all the it's like it's kind of like

17:26.320 --> 17:29.360
an LED game but it's in color you know it's Frogger I think I've seen one of

17:29.360 --> 17:32.080
those before aren't they like all red or all orange or something I know they're

17:32.080 --> 17:35.680
well not all of them I've seen ones that are multiple colors they have just like

17:35.680 --> 17:39.560
an overlay on them that gives them the colors but yeah it's basically that so

17:39.560 --> 17:44.040
what I would be doing is I'd be ripping out the guts of the inside or whatever

17:44.040 --> 17:49.080
this thing is I'd actually probably be using the joy stick that's on there not

17:49.080 --> 17:52.400
really even replacing any of the buttons but just wiring them up to some sort of

17:52.400 --> 17:57.320
like I pack type thing probably a mini pack and then running that through which

17:57.320 --> 18:02.360
I just bought because I bid snipe someone and won an auction for a nano

18:02.360 --> 18:07.940
ITX PC which they're really small but it's actually a little big for what I

18:07.940 --> 18:12.040
need it to be put in so I gotta put the board in an angle and hopefully that

18:12.040 --> 18:16.560
fits I'm not sure so that'll be fun otherwise I'll use it for something else

18:16.560 --> 18:24.240
but I have a three and a half inch monitor that came from I think it's

18:24.240 --> 18:28.880
supposed to use for like backup cameras and cars I got dirt cheap that I'm gonna

18:28.880 --> 18:33.240
hook it up through because it just takes a standard video in and I'm gonna hook

18:33.240 --> 18:38.320
that up to the PC through that and maybe possibly use that as an actual tiny

18:38.320 --> 18:42.760
tiny tiny main cabinet that'd be kind of funny and put on my desk at work I shall

18:42.760 --> 18:47.960
call him mini maim mini maim no but actual games I play this week just the

18:47.960 --> 18:52.640
same typical stuff I've been playing you know before Grand Theft Auto lots of lost

18:52.640 --> 18:55.480
in the dammed because that's what my co-workers want to play now because they

18:55.480 --> 19:00.920
think they lose less on that which I've been proving them wrong and although we

19:00.920 --> 19:03.560
did play a little bit of Battle of the Gay Tony because there was a few days

19:03.560 --> 19:07.300
where it's just myself and my other co-worker and there's just no one

19:07.300 --> 19:12.960
online at all playing you know Battle of the Gay Tony not I mean there's more

19:12.960 --> 19:16.080
people playing that than lost and dammed but there's really no one playing lost

19:16.080 --> 19:20.920
and dammed right now which you know I think this is about the right time to

19:20.920 --> 19:24.360
finally get those mods working which I'm hopefully going to start working on some

19:24.360 --> 19:30.120
more once I get done painting the baby's room which I'm very close right that

19:30.120 --> 19:33.960
baby's gonna get here and all your projects just got canceled no they

19:33.960 --> 19:42.840
haven't that's what you think you are wrong sir no I'm just saying project

19:42.840 --> 19:46.480
baby is gonna take a lot of time it's not gonna take that much time babies

19:46.480 --> 19:51.280
just thank you differ they sleep and they feed them any poke at them that's

19:51.280 --> 19:54.640
not gonna last yeah let's what we'll be saving this little clip and playing it

19:54.640 --> 19:58.200
for Loki a year after that kids born we'll see what he thinks hey I I'm well

19:58.200 --> 20:01.840
aware of what babies do and yeah they they wake you up in the middle night and

20:01.840 --> 20:06.360
you're tired okay I get that that does not stop me from say spending a few

20:06.360 --> 20:13.040
minutes you know here and there to build crap I don't know I need gamer daddies

20:13.040 --> 20:17.120
to email the show to give Loki some advice I just I just want to hear from

20:17.120 --> 20:21.840
some gamer daddies that's all all right I'm just saying like I don't need

20:21.840 --> 20:26.200
there's two of us we don't need to juggle the baby I mean I will be taking

20:26.200 --> 20:30.400
care of the baby but if you juggle the baby CPS might get called they might

20:30.400 --> 20:36.200
especially since they can't juggle anything so that's not good now I'm not

20:36.200 --> 20:40.880
worried about that stuff I don't think it's really gonna change anything I have

20:40.880 --> 20:45.920
done a number of people who said that all right we'll stop taking on Loki go

20:45.920 --> 20:49.360
ahead come on I'm just saying that I don't think it will affect anything

20:49.360 --> 20:55.040
that's fine I don't need 80,000 projects going on at one time but I will find

20:55.040 --> 21:00.000
excuses to do that okay so anyways besides all that stuff and of course

21:00.000 --> 21:04.880
more crackdown too I'm not really enjoying this game as much as the first

21:04.880 --> 21:09.760
one probably because this game is very similar to the first one which you know

21:09.760 --> 21:16.200
wouldn't be so bad but it's just they really kind of took away all the open

21:16.200 --> 21:20.240
world part of the game because you know the open world stuff is still there but

21:20.240 --> 21:26.840
my god is that my guy who's the voiceover guy is such a nagging bitch

21:26.840 --> 21:32.000
it's like you should go to this rooftop race fuck that I will do the rooftop

21:32.000 --> 21:36.600
race when I feel like it no you should do it now I will do it later do it now

21:36.600 --> 21:42.080
are you trying to piss me off oh god I hated that stop killing them you know

21:42.080 --> 21:49.640
you know like I'll like jump down and you know the other not agents but like

21:49.640 --> 21:53.080
you know the peacekeepers will be there and they'll get injured or like I'll

21:53.080 --> 21:57.000
blow up a car and some shrapnel will hit them though stop injuring the

21:57.000 --> 22:02.360
peacekeepers they're hard at work or like don't injure the civilians you know

22:02.360 --> 22:07.560
they need to like us my favorite that peacekeeper had a wife and family do you

22:07.560 --> 22:13.960
want to explain it to them and it's dumb and even when you do piss them off to

22:13.960 --> 22:17.200
come at they send a hit squad after you you just go up on the rooftops and they

22:17.200 --> 22:21.360
shoot at the building because they can't figure out how to hit you and and then

22:21.360 --> 22:25.400
that goes away and they're all hope you learned your lesson I'm like nope

22:25.400 --> 22:32.600
didn't learn my lesson I'm gonna do it again we yeah it's alright it's just

22:32.600 --> 22:38.520
maybe the announcers the last boss it's not the last boss and what's retarded is

22:38.520 --> 22:43.080
from what I hear the game has the same fucking twist in it as the first one and

22:43.080 --> 22:47.080
it's completely obvious from the beginning because obviously if you play

22:47.080 --> 22:50.720
the first game you understand what the twist is and right from the get-go they

22:50.720 --> 22:56.880
kind of give you the big hint hey hey it's probably the same twist again not

22:56.880 --> 23:01.640
that I even care it's just that was just a dumb excuse what about the twist in

23:01.640 --> 23:06.160
the original Metal Gear game that the big boss that was talking to you on the

23:06.160 --> 23:10.880
you know frequency thingy and he'd like was the announcer ended up being the

23:10.880 --> 23:15.920
last boss I think so yeah but I don't think this guy's the last boss he's just

23:15.920 --> 23:20.600
it's just that the peacekeepers are evil oh my god you know someone that's helping

23:20.600 --> 23:25.040
you know as evil that twist has been done like 80,000 times and you know I

23:25.040 --> 23:28.560
know it's a spoiler but hey the original crackdown game has been out for a few

23:28.560 --> 23:37.240
years now so too bad whatever it just doesn't it doesn't matter than me but

23:37.240 --> 23:42.640
it's still fun you know I like playing it it's just it's very you know the

23:42.640 --> 23:46.400
missions that you go on are very linear and granted that the first game the

23:46.400 --> 23:51.000
missions weren't that different but they did have some bosses that you fought I

23:51.000 --> 23:54.480
mean granted they were very simply just have to run up to them and roundhouse

23:54.480 --> 24:00.000
kick them a few times and they're dead but you know at least they had bosses I

24:00.000 --> 24:06.320
don't know they they could ramp up the difficulty and stuff they could all

24:06.320 --> 24:10.000
right well I guess that's it for Loki's gaming week how about Alan you want to

24:10.000 --> 24:15.320
talk about your gaming week absolutely how's my mic doing I think you're okay

24:15.320 --> 24:18.040
well kind of a just actually you and Jamie should probably switch back again

24:18.040 --> 24:23.920
is I think I fixed hers we'll see I don't know bear with us guys live radio

24:23.920 --> 24:29.600
let me just okay well we can hear you now okay all right hi okay so my

24:29.600 --> 24:35.240
birthday was a couple weeks ago and I picked up or rather I got Bayonetta so

24:35.240 --> 24:38.560
I'm finally playing that I know that came out in January a lot of fun been

24:38.560 --> 24:43.000
wanting to play it for a while I'm on the third stage so it's pretty much you

24:43.000 --> 24:48.360
know Devil May Cry but with a sexy bitch killing everybody

24:48.360 --> 24:54.640
puzzle quest 2 and I played puzzle quest 1 on the DS I probably have about 130

24:54.640 --> 24:58.200
hours on my save game so I've been playing the hell out of the second one

24:58.200 --> 25:03.680
Wow 130 hours that's a long game yeah I well I pretty much grinded everything to

25:03.680 --> 25:09.880
level 99 that was grindable it was very yeah so puzzle quest 2 Wow of course our

25:09.880 --> 25:14.000
guild tried to do a trial of the Crusader 10 man it's the hardest rate

25:14.000 --> 25:18.400
we've tried and Wow we got about halfway through it before we gave up good

25:18.400 --> 25:26.040
progress there and played some left for dead and played some alien swarm what

25:26.040 --> 25:32.520
you think alien swarm it's good it's the new four player co-op game that valve

25:32.520 --> 25:36.760
put out it is under the valve name it's free so whenever something is not

25:36.760 --> 25:41.440
horrible and free it's usually worthy of a little bit of hype the gameplay is

25:41.440 --> 25:48.240
basically gauntlet for player top-down massive enemies coming at you and it's

25:48.240 --> 25:52.720
so it's gauntlet with crossed with the movie aliens pretty much and there's the

25:52.720 --> 25:58.280
medic the tech the sergeant and the special ops and you play online with

25:58.280 --> 26:01.760
friends and each each person has a special role and it's a lot of fun I

26:01.760 --> 26:07.520
downloaded it oh so we'll have to play you should play with us free yeah you

26:07.520 --> 26:11.680
can't argue with free it's two gigs so yeah anything else you gave me a week

26:11.680 --> 26:17.600
you want to share with us I think that's all I've played really I played left for

26:17.600 --> 26:20.240
dead I'm sure you'll talk about a little bit with you you had never played it

26:20.240 --> 26:25.720
before well I had tried it like once a couple years ago but yeah yeah I did

26:25.720 --> 26:31.720
load up the team team fortress 2 tutorial so I know that Jamie wanted to

26:31.720 --> 26:37.960
play some of that so all right well my gaming week Alan hit on a lot of the

26:37.960 --> 26:40.840
same stuff I was playing a lot of these games we were playing together as I was

26:40.840 --> 26:44.440
in that Wow raid and all that fun stuff I've been doing more PvP in Wow though

26:44.440 --> 26:49.240
I'm one of my characters I'm finally my level 76 bank all warrior I'm finally

26:49.240 --> 26:52.060
bringing back to be like a PvP character and I've been having a lot of fun with

26:52.060 --> 26:58.120
her she's cool anyway a alien swarm free on steam right now there's really no

26:58.120 --> 27:01.880
reason not to get this game it's worth a look it's the time I mean it's not like

27:01.880 --> 27:06.320
oh my god like you know like portal awesome or something but it's the type

27:06.320 --> 27:10.480
of game you would pay like 10 to 15 dollars for on Xbox Live Arcade it feels

27:10.480 --> 27:15.160
a lot like an Xbox Live Arcade game to me but it's not it's a PC game and it's

27:15.160 --> 27:18.520
very much I think gauntlet kind of mixed with aliens is good with a little team

27:18.520 --> 27:21.520
fortress 2 thrown in there because a lot of the classes kind of seem to come over

27:21.520 --> 27:28.100
from that and yeah it's fun and a lot of fun on the multiplayer so check

27:28.100 --> 27:31.280
that out I mean there's really no reason not to check out alien swarm unless

27:31.280 --> 27:35.880
you're like super anti steam is about the only reason I could think of or your

27:35.880 --> 27:40.100
PC really really really blows which might be another reason one thing that I

27:40.100 --> 27:45.680
really like about valve is that they will often they're very involved in the

27:45.680 --> 27:50.180
mod community for half-life and all that stuff and if you read the info on alien

27:50.180 --> 27:54.980
swarm you will read that the developers for it are people from the mod community

27:54.980 --> 27:59.760
that valve hired because they like their work so valve actually hires out of you

27:59.760 --> 28:03.040
know the the fan the fan service projects that's cool and that's how

28:03.040 --> 28:07.880
alien swarm was made is they they hired out of the mod developers all right now

28:07.880 --> 28:11.160
some of our chat chatters a chat that orange on twitter.com are joking about

28:11.160 --> 28:15.360
free and Yaris amazed that suma says can't argue with free points to Yaris

28:15.360 --> 28:20.320
yeah but Yaris was different like I can't explain it like I Yaris really

28:20.320 --> 28:24.680
really was I think the commercial tie-in had a lot to do with that like when you

28:24.680 --> 28:28.640
pay to have a game made that's basically a giant commercial I think you're kind

28:28.640 --> 28:32.560
of set up for disaster a little bit alien swarm is no commercial nothing

28:32.560 --> 28:36.360
it's just I honestly I think it's again to try and get steam on more people's

28:36.360 --> 28:40.080
computers that's that's really what it boils down to because you know since you

28:40.080 --> 28:43.920
launched steam to play the game you're gonna get tempted into these ads where

28:43.920 --> 28:49.000
it's you know four dollar sale on you know old game I really want to buy that's

28:49.000 --> 28:52.600
that's what it is the same reason why they gave away portal for free why they

28:52.600 --> 28:56.680
have these disgustingly low sales is to get steam out there more because the

28:56.680 --> 29:01.480
more steam is out there the less other companies will you know that try to take

29:01.480 --> 29:06.640
them on will have the chance um other games I played I also played a little

29:06.640 --> 29:10.160
bit of team fortress 2 I play more than the tutorial I actually was playing some

29:10.160 --> 29:14.080
offline games I'm not ready to fight the people online yet because I'm still

29:14.080 --> 29:18.040
scared because I'm not very good at it but I found that I was I was doing okay

29:18.040 --> 29:23.160
it's a medic the white mage which I think somebody had suggested in an email

29:23.160 --> 29:26.280
last week and it was funny because I said yeah I'll probably do the medic and

29:26.280 --> 29:29.640
it's kind of a different role because instead of just running out there like

29:29.640 --> 29:33.680
all quake style just running on the front die it's more you know you hang

29:33.680 --> 29:37.520
back with your team and actually heal people and you can over heal I kind of

29:37.520 --> 29:40.360
liked what they did with it it's it's fun so I'm talking about all these games

29:40.360 --> 29:44.480
that are years old because I played Left 4 Dead as well finally got around to

29:44.480 --> 29:48.120
playing a little more that Alan and I played a little bit together and that

29:48.120 --> 29:53.200
was cool just I don't know I think a lot of you guys have already played it so

29:53.200 --> 29:55.960
for me to sit here and describe it after so long it's probably a little

29:55.960 --> 29:59.400
ridiculous but I guess if you haven't just kind of imagine a first-person shoe

29:59.400 --> 30:02.660
that it takes a little bit of teamwork I mean obviously Left 4 Dead is all

30:02.660 --> 30:05.760
about teamwork and it's about the four people you know that are playing

30:05.760 --> 30:09.760
although you know you can have everybody else be a computer player but it is a

30:09.760 --> 30:12.360
little more fun to play at least with people you know I mean you can go online

30:12.360 --> 30:14.880
and play with strangers but it's fun when you play with people you know

30:14.880 --> 30:17.720
because then you can kind of you know joke and talk to each other and you know

30:17.720 --> 30:21.040
Alan and I kind of you know can communicate really well and say you know

30:21.040 --> 30:24.760
he can explain to me you know why we don't run up and say hello to the girl

30:24.760 --> 30:32.160
that's crying right shine a light on her wait bad idea no so yeah it's good it's

30:32.160 --> 30:35.240
not like Left 4 Dead that was fun who's your favorite character in Left 4

30:35.240 --> 30:37.900
Dead somebody asked me down on Twitter this week and I'm like well I've like

30:37.900 --> 30:41.360
played it once do you have a favorite character on Left 4 Dead in the first

30:41.360 --> 30:47.360
one probably the biker I totally blanking on his name but the the guy at

30:47.360 --> 30:51.200
the handlebar mustache and yeah he's funny and the second one probably the

30:51.200 --> 30:56.440
redneck because he's so stupid all right very cool as far as other games I played

30:56.440 --> 30:59.840
this week Puzzle Quest 2 gosh it's almost the same games as Alan played

30:59.840 --> 31:02.680
this week I don't know if there's like anything unique I played that he didn't

31:02.680 --> 31:06.280
play kind of sound game room I don't think you really play game room I play a

31:06.280 --> 31:11.080
little bit of that another one of my old favorite Activision classics excuse me

31:11.080 --> 31:16.280
frostbite is scheduled for release this week that was kind of a frostbite is

31:16.280 --> 31:20.540
like kind of like a ghetto Frogger really really ghetto Frogger so I'll be

31:20.540 --> 31:25.040
checking that out because I have fond childhood memories of that one um all

31:25.040 --> 31:28.120
right that's gonna do it for our gaming week so we're gonna get into the news

31:28.120 --> 31:31.240
and everything that's going on in the gaming world but first we're gonna do

31:31.240 --> 31:34.360
some housekeeping real quick I want to bring you guys up to speed on the big

31:34.360 --> 31:39.040
battle it's kind of going on all summer long at the big battle net I think it's

31:39.040 --> 31:43.200
also available big battle dot all games calm but the big battle dot networks

31:43.200 --> 31:47.680
just fine thank you guys so much olr has really made a charge the past few days

31:47.680 --> 31:52.660
we are finally starting to dent the lead a little bit that dead pixel live has we

31:52.660 --> 31:55.600
have like 51 points we're a pretty solid second place right now and a lot of that

31:55.600 --> 31:59.440
has to do with you guys that played super stardust HD this week and again

31:59.440 --> 32:03.640
if you haven't heard of the big battle listeners of the shows not necessarily

32:03.640 --> 32:07.040
the hosts although I try to participate on at least games I own listeners of the

32:07.040 --> 32:11.000
shows play their favorite games against listeners of other shows and it's kind

32:11.000 --> 32:15.440
of like a big kind of tournament type of thing high scores and leaderboards and

32:15.440 --> 32:19.480
all that I think they're doing one tonight I don't know if maybe it was

32:19.480 --> 32:22.800
rescheduled they're doing battlefield bad company was either tonight earlier

32:22.800 --> 32:26.520
today sadly that's a game I'll have so I can really follow that one but I tried

32:26.520 --> 32:30.440
to get people through the Twitter to sign up but I know that super stardust

32:30.440 --> 32:34.880
HD just came to an end and we took first place thanks to our listeners Zoui came

32:34.880 --> 32:38.320
in first place with a obscene score of 11 million he was going back and forth

32:38.320 --> 32:42.640
with the second place listener from Fantastic Forum on there Riptide did

32:42.640 --> 32:47.320
very well there to AZHP made a showing and then we also made a showing on the

32:47.320 --> 32:52.120
Forza motorsport 3 competition one of our listeners I think just one charted

32:52.120 --> 32:57.120
over there Burr charted for us over there so he came in sixth place but

32:57.120 --> 33:01.520
that's certainly better than nothing so a very good job by Burr over there so we

33:01.520 --> 33:05.200
really appreciate that some things that are coming up in the near future super

33:05.200 --> 33:10.400
Street Fighter 4 trials HD and shatter have both been announced as well so

33:10.400 --> 33:13.880
super Street Fighter 4 I'm very excited about that one so we'll be checking

33:13.880 --> 33:18.200
those out a lot of you guys have been requesting other types of games PC games

33:18.200 --> 33:21.840
is when I've gotten a request for so I don't know how you might be able to do

33:21.840 --> 33:24.720
like a team fortress 2 battle but I'll try to look into it and see if we can

33:24.720 --> 33:27.680
get maybe Derek schedule so like that would be cool check that out big battle

33:27.680 --> 33:33.520

on twitter.com he does a lot of good work for the site and keeps it up with

33:36.600 --> 33:41.720
fresh content he decided thanks to their classic game of the week last week the

33:41.720 --> 33:45.720
journey being the classic in the week last week and it came up that you know

33:45.720 --> 33:51.120
he wants to do a game with the olr hosts or the olr people in journey or I should

33:51.120 --> 33:54.840
say not in the actual journey game in a journey like game so he actually has

33:54.840 --> 33:58.760
started it he's chronicling it in a little web series called project journey

33:58.760 --> 34:03.360
and there's actually little screenshots of me and like a breakout kind of game I

34:03.360 --> 34:08.200
don't know it's it's I'm curious to see how this turns out yet scared all at

34:08.200 --> 34:13.840
once I'm so excited I'm so excited I'm so scared alright alright that's gonna

34:13.840 --> 34:16.680
do it for housekeeping tonight facebook.com slash orange launch radio

34:16.680 --> 34:20.760
twitter.com slash olr please follow us spread the love of orange launch radio

34:20.760 --> 34:24.080
because we don't have advertising dollars let's get in some actual bonafide

34:24.080 --> 34:27.760
gaming news tonight there's a lot thanks to comic-con but I think Loki starting

34:27.760 --> 34:30.840
us off with something not comic-con related right yes we'll talk a little

34:30.840 --> 34:36.800
bit about connect and some of the stuff that was kind of rumored that we kind of

34:36.800 --> 34:45.360
you know figured was true but is true so we'll see anyways say announced that one

34:45.360 --> 34:48.960
of the things that was rumored that there's gonna be a new Xbox 360 arcade

34:48.960 --> 34:55.280
system coming out this fall there is gonna be a new one now it's bundled with

34:55.280 --> 35:00.960
a 4 gigabyte internal memory unit kind of like how they were doing with the old

35:00.960 --> 35:07.760
arcade systems and so that's kind of neat and then of course you know you can

35:07.760 --> 35:12.360
put your own hard drive in there just like you can with the new you know s

35:12.360 --> 35:15.600
systems or whatever you want to call them or use the USB because I think a

35:15.600 --> 35:20.320
lot of people are now using USB sticks you can also use USB sticks as well on

35:20.320 --> 35:26.360
there because there's plenty USB ports on there now and that's kind of cool and

35:26.360 --> 35:32.720
yes and then also of course they're gonna be doing a new oh and I'm sorry

35:32.720 --> 35:36.160
that will be bundled with connect that $300 one and of course there's also

35:36.160 --> 35:40.400
gonna be a new just plain arcade system for $200 that's gonna be coming out in

35:40.400 --> 35:46.160
August as well so that's kind of neat that they're gonna be doing that I mean

35:46.160 --> 35:53.520
alternatives are wonderful connect is gonna be priced at $150 as if all those

35:53.520 --> 36:00.680
retail listings you know we're Microsoft's own website taking pre

36:00.680 --> 36:06.040
orders didn't give it away yeah yeah it's such an interesting you know price

36:06.040 --> 36:11.280
there didn't didn't call that it does come with a free game which I may have

36:11.280 --> 36:16.360
hinted at before the free game is connected ventures kind of like they're

36:16.360 --> 36:21.640
a little we play type game so that'll be bundled within of course for 150 bucks

36:21.640 --> 36:28.920
and should be coming out well November 4th is that the is connected ventures

36:28.920 --> 36:33.040
the one with like the river rafting yes the Pong type game yes Jimmy Fallon that

36:33.040 --> 36:38.200
well the Pong type game I think that's in connect sports ok but this had like

36:38.200 --> 36:44.680
the like obstacle course thing that they had the river rafting stuff like that so

36:44.680 --> 36:49.520
that'd be kind of neat but you know hopefully makes it and we cost average

36:49.520 --> 36:54.720
it out makes it a little bit more beneficial I guess so if but if I want

36:54.720 --> 36:58.720
this and dance central day one that's gonna cost me what 200 bucks right

36:58.720 --> 37:03.280
yes connect games are gonna be $10 cheaper yes I guess only 50 bucks okay

37:03.280 --> 37:08.080
so it's gonna be 150 plus 50 plus tax so it's gonna cost me about 220 bucks to

37:08.080 --> 37:12.880
get connect to get connected dance central day one yes that's a bit of an

37:12.880 --> 37:18.120
investment I don't know do you think um do you think it's a bad idea to price at

37:18.120 --> 37:23.200
150 I mean of course we all want it cheaper duh but you know I mean the

37:23.200 --> 37:28.400
reality is when you get that third digit in there I mean they cross that kind of

37:28.400 --> 37:32.120
sweet spot as a lot of people were saying of $99 getting into that third

37:32.120 --> 37:37.200
digits that can ultimately hurt the sales but no game or not I think it may

37:37.200 --> 37:42.200
hurt the sales a little bit because it is pretty expensive but I mean they're

37:42.200 --> 37:44.840
trying to make it a little better because they're thrown in the game but

37:44.840 --> 37:48.400
when you look at it though with the new console and since it's being bundled

37:48.400 --> 37:53.640
with the new console then that really brings down the cost of the camera and

37:53.640 --> 37:59.880
I guess the software to $100 so I mean are they losing money on the console or

37:59.880 --> 38:07.440
they just you know adding some sort of profit margin in there for the actual

38:07.440 --> 38:14.040
you know accessory I can tell you right now obviously it may be $150 retail

38:14.040 --> 38:18.000
obviously that's not what they're selling them for you know we probably

38:18.000 --> 38:22.200
work in about a 20% margin in there because that's usually I think what

38:22.200 --> 38:28.240
accessories go for is they have a 20% margin built-in so if you figure that I

38:28.240 --> 38:33.240
mean they have to I guess leave room for the retailers to make some money let me

38:33.240 --> 38:37.080
do a quick poll in our chat room quick poll will you buy connect and it's buy

38:37.080 --> 38:41.160
in game connected ventures this year for a hundred and fifty dollars that's why

38:41.160 --> 38:44.920
I want to know a quick poll in our chat room chat orange laundry calm if you

38:44.920 --> 38:47.560
want to answer a quick poll I want to see some yeses and nos and maybe some

38:47.560 --> 38:51.440
brief reasons why let's go around the room who plans to buy connect and who

38:51.440 --> 38:57.680
says it's a waste of your time dark soccer I like lemonade the hell does

38:57.680 --> 39:00.880
that mean but you you collect peripherals so are you gonna buy it on

39:00.880 --> 39:04.320
that principle or you like no this is one I don't need it depends on what the

39:04.320 --> 39:07.440
money's like I mean that's not really always the big thing for us we'll

39:07.440 --> 39:10.960
eventually have it I'm sure we eventually get everything so it's kind

39:10.960 --> 39:15.200
like your economic situation is gonna be okay well that's fair 150 right now is

39:15.200 --> 39:19.520
kind of steep but I've paid more for less okay

39:19.520 --> 39:25.320
Alan something interests you no interest at all none none what if they made it

39:25.320 --> 39:30.680
$50 would you buy it yeah I consider it then I'm kind of the same boat as Jamie

39:30.680 --> 39:35.400
where it's like not to be Debbie Downer but okay you know well no I bet that's

39:35.400 --> 39:39.360
a blah blah economy blah blah nine point five percent unemployment rate like I

39:39.360 --> 39:42.840
can't get that right now you guys yeah there's a lot of listeners in the same

39:42.840 --> 39:46.240
boat as you guys so I think it's a very realistic answer to say that you know

39:46.240 --> 39:50.720
because of economic situations $150 too damn much now is not the time to be

39:50.720 --> 39:54.120
asking me to buy this stuff and a lot of people actually say that's why you

39:54.120 --> 39:57.400
didn't see new systems this year and you're seeing instead upgrades to

39:57.400 --> 40:02.220
existing systems because imagine if it wasn't just $150 for connect but you

40:02.220 --> 40:10.280
know $400 for Xbox 720 with a motion feature built in for me day one I'm a

40:10.280 --> 40:13.800
little bit on the fence right now like I kind of want to do it just because I

40:13.800 --> 40:18.680
really want Dance Central and the dance the dance masters or whatever it is

40:18.680 --> 40:22.880
Konami is putting out I kind of want to get both of those day one Loki I got a

40:22.880 --> 40:30.200
little so it was a couple things yes I will probably pick it up on day one but

40:30.200 --> 40:36.040
I don't know and I don't know why I should because really I've been burned

40:36.040 --> 40:40.840
by every single camera peripheral that's been put out there ever since the I toy

40:40.840 --> 40:47.520
I mean the very beginning so fine I will bite for a fourth time but this will be

40:47.520 --> 40:54.200
the last damn time there's something interesting when you mentioned dance

40:54.200 --> 41:00.120
masters or whatever the Konami game guess what I saw listing for the other

41:00.120 --> 41:03.920
day that I guess like really I'm surprised that's still coming out is

41:03.920 --> 41:07.280
this a secret no I don't know if it's a secret I think it may even be a

41:07.280 --> 41:13.280
mislisting because I haven't looked at the actual Konami their release list yet

41:13.280 --> 41:19.000
but um dance dance revolution is back on the list of games coming out which I

41:19.000 --> 41:23.280
thought was interesting that wouldn't surprise me is that the Xbox and ps3

41:23.280 --> 41:27.320
one yes I wouldn't surprise me they try to get out by the holiday but it now is

41:27.320 --> 41:31.480
really a bad time because you know especially on 360 where it's all about

41:31.480 --> 41:36.200
you know now you can dance without the mat it's kind of seems like really bad

41:36.200 --> 41:39.920
timing mm-hmm they really should have had that out earlier this year before

41:39.920 --> 41:44.000
e3 but I forgot to mention this during my gaming week technically not a game I'm

41:44.000 --> 41:49.360
playing but holy shit is it awesome I one of my release lists I saw I mean

41:49.360 --> 41:52.520
granted it hasn't been announced yet but I don't give a crap because it's so

41:52.520 --> 41:59.360
sweet earth defense force 2017 insect Armageddon yes they are making a sequel

41:59.360 --> 42:05.040
to the greatest one of the greatest games on the Xbox 360 in my opinion

42:05.040 --> 42:11.920
completely underrated but oh I cannot wait day one purchase for me you know

42:11.920 --> 42:15.560
and I saw that on your Twitter I was excited for you let's go back to the

42:15.560 --> 42:19.440
results of our quick poll at chat orange on twitter.com will you buy connect and

42:19.440 --> 42:23.080
it's buy in game connected ventures this year for $150 here's the results from

42:23.080 --> 42:30.920
our listeners nope no yes no yes only if a 360 is in that bundle yes because of

42:30.920 --> 42:35.480
fucking dance masters maybe I think that would be a good deal oh that's out with

42:35.480 --> 42:41.480
the 360 included 80% chance on not this year and then I don't have a job too so

42:41.480 --> 42:46.480
I don't even think about it those are the results see I told you guys here's

42:46.480 --> 42:52.280
the thing with the connect to is I like how simple it is basically I buy the

42:52.280 --> 42:56.480
system and I'm done I don't have to go oh okay now I gotta go buy all these

42:56.480 --> 43:00.760
extra accessories you know to get to work and I know that they've had there's

43:00.760 --> 43:04.480
a bunch of those price comparison charts and like feature charts that one was

43:04.480 --> 43:09.280
released by Microsoft was released by Sony which were hilarious and not the

43:09.280 --> 43:12.760
sound Microsoft centric or anything release their chart kind of seemed a

43:12.760 --> 43:16.040
little bit more fair with the comparison and what you have to buy you know to

43:16.040 --> 43:21.640
equal out a two-player setup and the cost of that versus you know Sony's

43:21.640 --> 43:27.760
saying that oh well our systems in 1080p with blu-ray as opposed to just 1080p

43:27.760 --> 43:33.160
or your substandard 1080p because it does not have blu-ray technology our

43:33.160 --> 43:37.400
system has buttons on it that is an excellent follow-up question for our

43:37.400 --> 43:40.800
Chiron let me ask this quick poll question real quick are you buying

43:40.800 --> 43:44.600
PlayStation move this year that's what I want to know how much is PlayStation

43:44.600 --> 43:48.880
move again it's it's a PlayStation move is if you buy the bundle it's gonna be

43:48.880 --> 43:55.440
$100 and it gets you one of the the move controllers the camera and a game but

43:55.440 --> 43:59.080
that does not give you in case you know granted you're gonna say oh well not all

43:59.080 --> 44:03.360
the games require you know the navigation controller yes that's also

44:03.360 --> 44:08.080
like saying not all the Wii games require the nunchuck but most of them do

44:08.080 --> 44:12.360
so you're gonna probably want it so you're going to buy another a nunchuck

44:12.360 --> 44:17.080
and to buy another move controller if you want two players and another you

44:17.080 --> 44:20.400
know navigation controller nunchuck whatever you want to call it and you

44:20.400 --> 44:25.080
know those are expensive like 30 bucks I think for the navigation controller and

44:25.080 --> 44:30.840
I want to say like 70 for the actual controller around there I could be

44:30.840 --> 44:34.280
wrong on the prices but quickly let me run around the room and see who might

44:34.280 --> 44:40.600
buy PlayStation move here Dark Sakura PlayStation move this year um really

44:40.600 --> 44:43.600
don't know okay same same kind of answer that's fine

44:43.600 --> 44:47.680
Alan I don't have a Wii yet and I think that sort of answers the same question

44:47.680 --> 44:52.400
no not at all I'm I'll tell I'm gonna say it pretty strongly here I have no

44:52.400 --> 44:55.720
interest in PlayStation move right now there's not a single game that's on it

44:55.720 --> 45:01.080
that I'm really interested in you could be you could pay charge me $50 for the

45:01.080 --> 45:04.040
whole thing the bundle of the controller everything I still wouldn't buy it it's

45:04.040 --> 45:07.200
not to say I'm hateful for everything Sony this year because I really want

45:07.200 --> 45:09.840
little big planet 2 and there's some other things that don't involve the move

45:09.840 --> 45:14.160
that are very interesting pretty much every game that does interest me that

45:14.160 --> 45:18.200
has move support I'm I'll be perfectly content with without move that's my kind

45:18.200 --> 45:21.880
of issue whereas with Kinect what are the games that interest me most over

45:21.880 --> 45:26.640
there things that you just can't do on a controller period and that you know to

45:26.640 --> 45:30.200
for all practical purposes those dance games really haven't been done before in

45:30.200 --> 45:35.520
this style Loki PlayStation move absolutely not it looks like crap and I

45:35.520 --> 45:39.920
can't believe that they made game I mean just the the whole lineup looks like

45:39.920 --> 45:46.200
junk I mean in the fact that the controller is just a total grab at the

45:46.200 --> 45:53.240
Wii stuff I mean it's basically a Wii with HD graphics and good power to them

45:53.240 --> 45:57.800
I guess for trying to come up with a system the other works for them but I

45:57.800 --> 46:02.880
don't play my Wii right now and why am I gonna spend more money for Wii type

46:02.880 --> 46:06.720
games and granted I know that the Kinect will have Wii type games because that's

46:06.720 --> 46:10.320
what they're gonna put out at launch because that's what they do they try to

46:10.320 --> 46:15.440
find something gimmicky but you can't do stuff like dance central or whatever on

46:15.440 --> 46:20.720
the Wii you can't do it with the controller setup that you have either

46:20.720 --> 46:24.400
you're gonna get things that the closest to that you can get is like a just dance

46:24.400 --> 46:28.240
type game and I really don't I'm not interested in something like that

46:28.240 --> 46:31.280
dar Tetsuya in our chat room says care to make a wager if they'll sell 1

46:31.280 --> 46:35.520
million units of move I'm sure they will at some point because it's gonna be like

46:35.520 --> 46:38.680
a new system for them well here's it here's what's interesting you ready to

46:38.680 --> 46:41.400
see the results of our quick poll in our chat room chat that orange house radio

46:41.400 --> 46:44.680
calm are you buying PlayStation move this year you ready for this thanks to

46:44.680 --> 46:48.000
the listeners to chat that orange honestly calm here we go nope I don't

46:48.000 --> 46:52.400
think so nope no no I don't even have ps3 as of now

46:52.400 --> 46:57.200
hells no hell no no thanks I already have a we only if someone gave me a ps3

46:57.200 --> 47:04.240
I don't have a ps3 I really have no need for a ps3 nor do I want one no and brb

47:04.240 --> 47:08.280
not a single person in our chat room and please speak up if I missed you said

47:08.280 --> 47:13.960
that they're buying it we at least had about two or three saying they were

47:13.960 --> 47:17.120
getting connect but not a single person saying they're getting move that could

47:17.120 --> 47:20.800
be very interesting not that I want to make bets cuz I don't want to make bets

47:20.800 --> 47:25.720
and we're not gonna do this crap I'm just I think move is gonna fail but

47:25.720 --> 47:28.720
they're they're gonna be able to sweep it under the rug very easily whereas

47:28.720 --> 47:34.840
connect is way riskier and I don't know if that's gonna do well or not like yeah

47:34.840 --> 47:38.320
I want one but I kind of have a bad feeling that dance central may be the

47:38.320 --> 47:41.800
only game I ever get here's the problem too with the connect is they haven't

47:41.800 --> 47:45.680
really shown off any of the hardcore games yet for it it's all been like the

47:45.680 --> 47:49.080
casual stuff they I mean granted with the move they showed hey look we can use

47:49.080 --> 47:55.360
it in SOCOM 4 and look we can use it in you know kill zone 2 if you want but

47:55.360 --> 47:59.860
they ever or kill zone 3 but they haven't really shown off anything like

47:59.860 --> 48:04.280
hey look Halo Reach is gonna you know support the move or like you know Gears

48:04.280 --> 48:11.000
of War 3 or something like that or not the move they connect so I don't know it

48:11.000 --> 48:16.040
it'll be interesting to see what happens but I I do I don't think it's gonna be

48:16.040 --> 48:19.840
like oh my god everybody's gonna run out and get these consoles it's just the

48:19.840 --> 48:23.960
same reason why even with the Wii and stuff you know the Wii sells well

48:23.960 --> 48:28.640
because it's cheap and I guarantee if this stuff starts doing well like the

48:28.640 --> 48:32.520
move in the Kinect that that console will drop in price again to the

48:32.520 --> 48:39.240
sweet-spot of $99 or even like $120 and it won't matter anymore because people

48:39.240 --> 48:43.160
will be snatching that shit up like crazy and seriously when you think about

48:43.160 --> 48:47.640
it if that's the kind of gameplay you're into why the fuck should you spend $400

48:47.640 --> 48:52.080
on a HD console so the graphics are slightly better remember folks it

48:52.080 --> 48:56.480
doesn't matter if the you know graphics are better as long as the game is fun I

48:56.480 --> 49:00.680
mean if anything look at some of the stuff that like Capcom has done with

49:00.680 --> 49:05.400
like the 8-bit retro games those games are fun because they're fun not because

49:05.400 --> 49:10.960
they look pretty and that's the whole point is the games need to be fun a need

49:10.960 --> 49:15.680
the focus less on how pretty the games are that will only get you so far it's

49:15.680 --> 49:19.840
the fun that keeps people around all right well before I get into the next

49:19.840 --> 49:22.640
story I'm sure there's gonna be some even though our chat results came up

49:22.640 --> 49:25.520
that nobody was interested in move I'm sure there's some folks listening the

49:25.520 --> 49:29.040
podcast because we do reach a pretty big audience of the podcast comparatively

49:29.040 --> 49:31.520
there's probably somebody out there that's probably sitting there right now

49:31.520 --> 49:36.600
going man these guys just hating on Sony man man man no I'm open to and I really

49:36.600 --> 49:40.480
actually want to hear from the people that are gonna buy PlayStation move why

49:40.480 --> 49:43.840
are you buying PlayStation move and I'm not asking that in a accusatory I'm just

49:43.840 --> 49:47.080
kind of I want to know like what is it that interests you about PlayStation move

49:47.080 --> 49:49.960
I told you I'm interested in Dance Central that's kind of why I want to get

49:49.960 --> 49:53.840
connect what is it on move that interests you for this holiday season

49:53.840 --> 49:56.400
and what's motivating you to go out to get a move I'd love to hear from the

49:56.400 --> 50:00.560
listeners mailbag orange on twitter.com I was gonna real quickly show talk about

50:00.560 --> 50:06.040
just Microsoft's thing when they put out the cost of the different systems and

50:06.040 --> 50:09.840
stuff like that oh did you call this that this is gonna come out a Microsoft

50:09.840 --> 50:13.240
will put out a chart that says it like I remember you I don't remember you did

50:13.240 --> 50:17.800
you did I know you did but this is assuming that you already own the these

50:17.800 --> 50:22.360
consoles or whatever here's what it will cost you to equal up to what I guess

50:22.360 --> 50:28.080
them the place not the PlayStation the Kinect can give you so of course of

50:28.080 --> 50:34.560
connect only supports two people at least for full body capture whatever so

50:34.560 --> 50:41.360
for a hundred fifty dollars you get the connects system now to equal that on the

50:41.360 --> 50:46.080
PlayStation side you're in need the hundred-dollar starter kit which gets

50:46.080 --> 50:51.120
you the camera and the controller you're in need an additional controller which

50:51.120 --> 50:56.500
is another $50 and into navigational controllers which are $30 each total

50:56.500 --> 51:02.380
cost $210 now if you compare that with the we all you're gonna really need is

51:02.380 --> 51:06.640
another remote which is $40 they're saying that we balance board and this is

51:06.640 --> 51:10.800
mainly just so that you can play every single game that's available on the week

51:10.800 --> 51:15.200
is with you know the connect you're gonna need you know just that camera to

51:15.200 --> 51:18.360
play every single game that's gonna be available for connect and then with the

51:18.360 --> 51:21.600
you know the movie or any of those navigation controllers to play every

51:21.600 --> 51:26.520
single game on there and then an additional nunchuck so they'll cost $160

51:26.520 --> 51:30.240
it's only $10 more than the hundred fifty dollars that's how they're saying

51:30.240 --> 51:36.360
that they're a better bargain I guess they're doing some fuzzy math it's some

51:36.360 --> 51:41.960
funny because they're also saying if you already have these systems you know it's

51:41.960 --> 51:45.720
not including the price price of the systems and then I think it's a little

51:45.720 --> 51:49.080
bit shady to to throw in the hundred-dollar balance board seeing

51:49.080 --> 51:52.920
saying you need it I get what they're where they're going with it but

51:52.920 --> 51:58.200
Microsoft's doing some fuzzy math but that's that's what that's the sales

51:58.200 --> 52:02.640
people get paid to do I get you but even like with like the PlayStation chart

52:02.640 --> 52:06.480
Sony chart you know what they're talking about the different features and stuff

52:06.480 --> 52:11.120
it's just some of the comparisons are ridiculous like for example they have

52:11.120 --> 52:15.320
like six different bullet points are that are the camera that you know

52:15.320 --> 52:20.160
obviously the the we does not have a camera so all those are no but they're

52:20.160 --> 52:24.800
like saying camera yes augmentative reality yes it's basically if you

52:24.800 --> 52:30.400
actually look and read all the stuff it's all basically the same as the

52:30.400 --> 52:35.880
connect except for you know oh there's no buttons darn you know well what if

52:35.880 --> 52:39.480
you don't need buttons on there I know that they were stressing that buttons

52:39.480 --> 52:43.580
are really important just like that they were stressing that but or force

52:43.580 --> 52:48.020
feedback was an important back when you know they didn't have the licensing for

52:48.020 --> 52:51.360
force feedback in the PlayStation 3 controller you know what they should do

52:51.360 --> 52:54.520
is they should put out a chart that's a little more honest with the price but

52:54.520 --> 52:58.700
they should just say here's what the Xbox will do that the Wii won't do you

52:58.700 --> 53:03.720
know the Xbox is in HD the Xbox has access to indie games the Xbox has this

53:03.720 --> 53:09.280
library of download content the X-Plays DVDs and don't yes basically you know

53:09.280 --> 53:12.840
just be honest yeah it's a little more money but this is what you're getting

53:12.840 --> 53:17.560
for all of it you know you it plays DVDs you can do live interactive things like

53:17.560 --> 53:22.220
one versus a hundred oh wait no you can't not anymore but you can do

53:22.220 --> 53:26.400
Netflix party well I just wondering though the problem I think that they're

53:26.400 --> 53:31.980
gonna have with these two new motion systems is that it may be too late you

53:31.980 --> 53:37.760
know what I mean it's like the Wii is so inexpensive now and it's only gonna get

53:37.760 --> 53:42.380
cheaper you know putting out these additional systems that's basically like

53:42.380 --> 53:48.720
saying oh you know you need to buy no system and fuck for $150 why don't you

53:48.720 --> 53:53.060
just go buy a Wii I mean cuz you can pretty much do that with that kind of

53:53.060 --> 53:58.760
cost so why even bother buying the Kinect when they're just basically saying

53:58.760 --> 54:03.840
four hundred dollars I just buy a Wii let me leave leave this story on this

54:03.840 --> 54:06.480
comment from our chat room chat dot orange on twitter.com because I think

54:06.480 --> 54:09.600
it's interesting frisbee says in response to something Jamie said a

54:09.600 --> 54:16.440
minute ago Microsoft does what Nintend should perhaps alright let's move on to

54:16.440 --> 54:20.280
our next story and this has to do with stuff going on in the real world that

54:20.280 --> 54:23.520
will definitely impact gaming I'm sure you guys have heard about this bill

54:23.520 --> 54:26.960
that's gonna go before the Supreme Court and it's a California bill that is

54:26.960 --> 54:32.640
basically banning the sale of violent video games to kid to get kid justice

54:32.640 --> 54:37.960
one kid actually know the kids and you know it's going to be going before the

54:37.960 --> 54:42.040
Supreme Court and because it was overturned by a lower court you know

54:42.040 --> 54:46.680
some time ago after it was signed into law well long story short 11 states have

54:46.680 --> 54:51.980
now joined in basically saying they support this bill so this is now no

54:51.980 --> 54:56.440
longer just a California issue but Connecticut Florida Hawaii Illinois

54:56.440 --> 55:00.880
Louisiana Maryland Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Texas and Virginia are now

55:00.880 --> 55:06.000
all on this too not to say that if the Supreme Court you know reverses the

55:06.000 --> 55:09.400
other decision putting the law into effect not to say that all these states

55:09.400 --> 55:14.960
will suddenly also have the law but that should tell you where California goes at

55:14.960 --> 55:20.200
least these 11 states are lined up to follow so if you want to have your voice

55:20.200 --> 55:24.200
heard you might want to call your congressperson and don't be afraid to do

55:24.200 --> 55:27.440
so because that's what they're there for that's what they're paid to do it's also

55:27.440 --> 55:32.160
the ECA you can go through the ECA mm-hmm although you know the ECA is a

55:32.160 --> 55:37.140
union you can kind of join to support and help fight it but there is nothing

55:37.140 --> 55:40.000
quite like contacting your representative directly do you want to

55:40.000 --> 55:47.040
say something on this no all right so yeah I definitely would encourage folks

55:47.040 --> 55:52.960
to contact people otherwise this is you know and again just to kind of state

55:52.960 --> 55:57.520
like you know where the issue is with this is that you know whereas yes kids

55:57.520 --> 56:00.300
should not be playing violent video games isn't that really up to the

56:00.300 --> 56:04.560
parents to be doing and not really the video game stores and why are video

56:04.560 --> 56:09.440
games being held to a different standard than you know movies is it against the

56:09.440 --> 56:14.040
law to sell an r-rated movie to a kid like you don't do it like you're not

56:14.040 --> 56:17.760
supposed to do it but is it against the law because it's going to be against the

56:17.760 --> 56:23.340
law to do video games pretty soon if this happens the last few times I've

56:23.340 --> 56:29.760
gone to Best Buy and bought an M rated game from there I've been carded and I

56:29.760 --> 56:34.600
know I pretty sure I look over 18 I am over 18 it's no real inconvenience to me

56:34.600 --> 56:39.880
but I like I appreciate that they do that and if stores just all adopted that

56:39.880 --> 56:44.240
policy I don't really understand why this law is necessary and again it

56:44.240 --> 56:48.560
should be you know if parents were doing their due diligence on what their kids

56:48.560 --> 56:52.880
were playing and buying or what they bought for their kids it's just it seems

56:52.880 --> 56:57.880
really unnecessary J rod in our chat says I don't get why this is an issue

56:57.880 --> 57:01.440
children need a parent to get into an r-rated movie or buy a parental advisory

57:01.440 --> 57:05.400
music album but is that against the law

57:05.480 --> 57:11.280
it's just that same double standard again I actually I somewhat agree with

57:11.280 --> 57:14.320
you J rod it's just that you know I think video games are being held to a

57:14.320 --> 57:18.360
different standard and that's not very fair because it's just going into that

57:18.360 --> 57:21.880
whole stereotype that video games somehow make you a more violent person I

57:21.880 --> 57:26.040
just kind of don't like what they're trying to say I don't like what you're

57:26.040 --> 57:30.880
trying to say to me all right let's move on with another story dark soccer well

57:30.880 --> 57:35.400
this is happier news this actually makes well me in particular very happy we have

57:35.400 --> 57:42.240
a couple of games coming out from both Capcom and Namco Bandai Street Fighter

57:42.240 --> 57:47.400
cross Tekken and Tekken cross Street Fighter what's the difference huh well

57:47.400 --> 57:53.240
Capcom's in charge of the former and that one's gonna be all done in that

57:53.240 --> 58:00.800
sort of Street Fighter 4 style that 2.5 D look and of the the Tekken characters

58:00.800 --> 58:05.920
will be re-image to fit that same style and a slow screen capture from it with

58:05.920 --> 58:10.920
Kazuya and Ryu and it looked really really good the gameplay looks exactly

58:10.920 --> 58:15.280
like Street Fighter 4 that will make me intensely happy they have the video of

58:15.280 --> 58:20.800
it and of course it's tag team so it's gonna be sweet and that one will have

58:20.800 --> 58:28.800
versus training and tag team and it's gonna be a full-on Capcom style now the

58:28.800 --> 58:35.440
latter is going to be more of the Tekken style play that has a 3d arenas I don't

58:35.440 --> 58:41.560
know if they're gonna be taking the the sort of a Street Fighter EX move list

58:41.560 --> 58:48.280
and importing it into Tekken or what or if it's gonna be trying to actually

58:48.280 --> 58:54.000
translate the styles of each character into a move list that would fit the way

58:54.000 --> 58:59.040
Tekken plays because there's not really any real major projectile moves like

58:59.040 --> 59:04.800
that in Tekken except for a couple of interesting moves like and there's the

59:04.800 --> 59:09.520
unblockable moves to like Jen's whole electric block thing I think in the

59:09.520 --> 59:13.280
later Tekken's the final boss would have a fireball to make them even more

59:13.280 --> 59:18.200
cheesier that's right but normally yeah they're regular characters down from

59:18.200 --> 59:25.560
what I remember now Tekken was always my big thing especially when Tekken 3 came

59:25.560 --> 59:29.800
out I was working in a Namco arcade at the time so of course we had it before

59:29.800 --> 59:33.360
everybody else did and I was like ooh I know who that character is coming out

59:33.360 --> 59:38.760
you know cuz I was keeping a keeping up with the Japanese character releases at

59:38.760 --> 59:43.280
the time we got ours in a different order than they did in Japan hmm yeah

59:43.280 --> 59:47.960
Tekken 3 was a huge deal here because it was a launch title with the ps2 yeah so

59:47.960 --> 59:52.600
if you're in line at midnight September whatever 2000 for the ps2 you are

59:52.600 --> 59:58.460
picking up Tekken 3 SSX big as Tekken Tag Tournament actually yeah Tekken 3 was

59:58.460 --> 01:00:01.640
on the ps1 I'm pretty sure it was with the ps1 in fact they have like a suit

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:05.440
up version on the ps2 I think that's what they had yeah but Tekken Tag

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:08.520
Tournament was the big thing and actually they fixed a lot of the problems

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:11.760
that the Japanese Tekken Tag Tournament had cuz it had this weird thing where

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:16.320
the background would almost detach from the foreground and it would really give

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:22.720
me a headache after a while playing it but um I've got I imported Tekken 3 when

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:30.080
it came out in Japan and actually they they censored the endings between that

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:34.520
one in the u.s. one it's pretty funny I kind of wish if Capcom and Namco we're

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:38.880
gonna get into bed together again I'll get to that a moment in a moment I kind

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:43.280
of wish it was Street Fighter cross Soul Calibur personally cuz I loves me some

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:47.240
Soul Calibur but I get it the universe the universe of Tekken and Street

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:50.160
Fighter are similar like Soul Calibur would not really fit as well in that

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:54.880
universe although Darth Vader and Yoda seemed to do okay yeah well Soul Calibur

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:58.600
is taking its own kind of interesting direction you know it's it's kind of

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:02.960
shifting in more to the customized character I would love to where's my

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:06.880
announcement Soul Calibur 5 because we should be about ready for that don't you

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:10.760
think Soul Calibur 4 was a couple years ago I'm just saying now what I really

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:14.880
want to see is a Capcom I hope you're listening I want I want to know the

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:19.840
rival schools um also let's get into this because it has kind of a funky name

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:23.320
and we've heard people say Street Fighter X Tekken because that's what it

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:27.000
literally reads like and we've heard like Tekken versus Street Fighter just

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.440
kind of people replacing it with versus but the name actually comes from a

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:33.440
couple years ago and I know we've talked about it on this show is a Japanese game

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:37.560
that never came out here there was already a Namco cross Capcom and it was

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:40.480
more of like it wasn't more like a strategy game or something just involved

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:43.840
the characters in the various universes I think it was is a tactical stretch it

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:46.740
was like a tactical game that is why I never bothered with it but it has some

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:50.920
sweet music so should be known that this is not the first time that Namco and

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:53.800
Capcom have kind of gotten in bed together this is you know kind of a

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:58.840
logical type of follow-up so it's a little weird in a way like I don't I'm

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:04.840
gonna admit I'm kind of sad that it's not a Capcom SNK part 3 because that's

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:10.520
what I would really like to see because I prefer my and you know Andy Bogard and

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:16.080
all them from the SNK universe but whatever you know I want them to do I

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:20.800
would like to have I mean as much as a Street Fighter and Tekken seems to be

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:25.040
such a logical choice for them to do a crossover game with because those are

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:30.560
the two biggest franchises of each company I would like I would have

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:35.920
preferred to have like a more generic all-out like how Capcom versus SNK was

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:41.280
you know where you had like they had the card fighters clash game that was just

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:46.840
pretty fun and then you had the fighting game and I like that the company's major

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:51.760
artists did each other's art for them you know like the Capcom artist did the

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:56.200
SNK artist and vice versa I would like to see because I'd like to have Klonoa

01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:00.440
in a fighting game that was the joke I was about to make yeah Klonoa versus

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:05.880
Akuma well even in the trailer at the very end they show like Megaman chasing

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:09.840
a pac-man ghost and then a pac-man chomping after Megaman like it's really

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:14.040
weird and then I'm like are they gonna do something with Megaman universe like

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:18.600
what the hell are these two companies planning like what is this weird like

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:23.320
somebody is sleeping with somebody at the other company like seriously because

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:27.160
like now what's gonna happen next kadamari damashi meets Resident Evil I

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:33.400
mean you've made the zombie moon I should know that's how you make Pluto

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:37.160
cuz Pluto is the dead planet we should do that as a listless some week you know

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:44.480
the Namco cross Capcom series we'd like to see happen next that would just be

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:49.760
all kinds of wrong but this is interesting is Capcom's got a lot of

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:52.960
fighting games coming out because they've got this they've got Marvel

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:58.240
versus Capcom still happening well it's all these like X versus Y Marvel versus

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:04.960
Capcom 3 out there 3 was using my right hand but which I'm still majorly looking

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:10.120
forward to cuz dude my team of Deadpool and Dante all as she 100 Matt in our

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:17.760
chat room at chat.com is a nap calm that's when you read too fast I like

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:23.920
that name nap calm damn co cross Capcom was a massive financial failure I didn't

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:27.200
realize that but that might explain why it never came out to the u.s. I'm looking

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:31.520
at the Wikipedia article that we got linked here and trying to see what's

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:36.640
going on he out was a tactical game I'm trying to see how it was received oh

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.360
there's a lot of characters in the different games there reception it got a

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:45.720
28 out of 40 in Famitsu it was the top-selling game the week of release it

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:51.000
sold approximately 131,000 copies in its first six months of release and then it

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:56.160
got re-released as a PlayStation to the best I don't sound terrible maybe it

01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:00.960
wasn't like oh my gosh blow your hair back but it sounds like it okay rating

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:07.440
coming from Famitsu you know how strict they are on the ratings haven't they

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:12.200
given like only five games a ten more like twelve and in ten dogs was one of

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:16.960
them just saying ten dogs is great for about five minutes which is how long

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:21.240
they must have played it for but usually yeah they've they've got some pretty

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:26.400
strict standards but they've had their moments of weakness that's for sure well

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:30.440
I don't know about you guys but I'm looking for this I I I played Tekken 1

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:34.960
2 3 like I had all those games the PlayStation 1 and then I kind of stopped

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:38.920
playing Tekken like I didn't really ever play four or five maybe I rented four I

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:43.040
don't remember well I remember what I got Tekken 6 from Gamefly and you came

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:46.640
over and we played it for a couple hours that's right I had 40 characters which

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:50.880
is like a ton amount of characters and we were like we don't we don't care it

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:54.560
was kind of bad like yeah isn't that great we just couldn't we yeah we

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:58.840
couldn't get into it I I really am curious to see kind of what

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:02.760
the Tekken cross I mean cuz we all know what Street Fighter cross Tekken is

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:05.380
gonna look like it's gonna be freaking Street Fighter 4 with Tekken characters

01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:09.400
whoopee I'm more curious to see what Tekken cross Street Fighter ends up

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:13.920
looking like and because you know is it gonna be is it gonna kind of not be so

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:18.600
great like Tekken 6 or are they gonna maybe get the Soul Calibur people to

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:21.440
work on it I don't know it'd be interesting to see what happens did you

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:25.560
see the pictures Rob I saw the pictures of Street Fighter cross Tekken but I

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:28.800
didn't see the other way around I don't think there is

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:32.200
because this all happened at comic-con at the Capcom panel which by the way

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:36.080
isn't it weird that they waited for comic-con and didn't say something at

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:39.880
e3 I mean maybe they weren't ready to make an announcement at e3 but I mean

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:43.300
it wasn't that long ago it just seemed comic-con seems like a weird place to

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:47.700
make that type of announcement because you know comic-con all about the comic

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:53.720
books I thought that this particular shot was just epic and she's looking at

01:06:53.720 --> 01:07:02.800
a shot of Ryu fighting Kazuya. Ryu looks like I'm gonna punch you! I have I

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:06.880
can tell you right now with the Tekken cross Street Fighter is gonna look like

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:11.880
huh the Street Fighter EX series I hope not oh god I'm sorry those games were

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:16.320
terrible I did not like them at all ex3 was all right because dude it's all

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:21.800
about skull mania but those weren't even produced by Capcom proper it was done

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:25.720
through an American company I really like those games so I'm surprised

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:30.200
hearing this from you right now what the EX series I thought I think it's really

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:37.520
underrated I liked them all okay well all yours

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:43.840
well if Namco is doing that one in particular then I'm more than certain

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:50.640
that they're gonna be sticking with Namco style for how they do it and

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:55.720
they've always had really tight gameplay for the Tekkens well what was that what

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:59.640
was the SNK game called remember those Capcom versus SNK but SNK put out what

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:04.640
SVC chaos yeah yeah that game wasn't so great not my I mean I love me some SNK

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:09.520
but Capcom I think made the better game it was all right yeah so all right

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:13.520
anyhow let's move on with some more gaming news we're gonna release dates in

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:17.480
a little bit after this next round of news starting off with Loki mm-hmm Sony

01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:23.760
has patented multiplayer via stereoscopic systems basically the way

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.840
this is gonna work they actually had something similar and I'm surprised that

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:33.440
they're able to patent this anyways they have a way now using the kind of

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:39.400
shutter system or whatever that you'll only be able to see your I guess your

01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:43.760
player or whatever on the screen at one time while someone else can actually see

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:48.720
the full screen as well so it'll do split screen by basically having two

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:52.760
different images on the screen at the same time and each player will only be

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:56.640
able to see their own you know version of the screen using those shutter

01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:59.720
glasses they actually have this already in TVs right now because I know you can

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:05.440
actually do that with those 120 megahertz TVs and watch two different

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:08.720
programs at the same time or two different inputs but I guess this would

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:12.840
actually kind of combine it with only one input but it would still be two

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:15.520
different versions of the game or whatever they're playing I don't know

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:21.240
why but that technology sounds painful to me it's really um it's it's a neat

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:24.320
idea but it's really it's not something that they're gonna be like oh my god you

01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:30.760
can do this it'll be kind of cool but at the same time it's kind of a dumb use of

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:34.800
if I've got these 3d glasses that I'm paying for in this 3d TV that I'm

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:40.720
paying for I'm gonna want to use the 3d portion of that and not necessarily the

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:44.440
split-screen portion of that but what if you want to watch one show and your

01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:48.280
sister wants to watch another show I mean now you both can watch the same

01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:53.200
show but wouldn't it be cheaper to get a second TV no it's not that at all it's

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:57.800
this would be just to play like it's a multiplayer game but you're just

01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:00.440
watching two different play or two different players are using the same

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:03.840
screen but couldn't you do that if look at I mean if it's if it's canceling out

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:06.960
one image and only showing you you know basically half the yeah you can do that

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:10.520
with certain TVs but not this system this is a totally different system that

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:14.720
okay so you can do that right now with certain 120 megahertz TVs if you have

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:19.320
that shutter system you can basically do picture-in-picture or you can be stop

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:23.000
being a little pussy and just you know look at half the fucking screen it's

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.200
just spinning like hundreds up hundreds of dollars on a fucking camera or like a

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:34.220
stupid shutter glass system just to do this just buy another damn TV like you

01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:38.420
said but the game system doesn't have the processing power to handle the

01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:42.280
split-screen those PlayStation threes with their what are they called I don't

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:45.920
know the uber cores or whatever those are in the emotion engine no that was

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:54.880
ps2 the ps3s have something else the cell and just sell yeah well here's the

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.920
thing though but it can't handle split-screen yes it can handle split

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.880
screens if it can handle two different screens it's the same fucking thing

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:06.200
actually it's even more processor intensive what they really should have

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:10.000
done Rob is they should have gone back to the original design of the PS remember

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.480
the original design of the ps3 how ridiculous that was with like it's three

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:18.040
HDMI outs and it's dual LAN outs and stuffs like what the fuck do you need

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:21.400
that stuff for but I mean if that's really what they want to do with this

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:25.480
then why not just do that so we can have two fucking TVs or I don't know how

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:28.880
about you just stop being a little whiny bitch about it and just not worry about

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:32.280
it seriously how many fucking split-screen games are out there not

01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:36.240
that much anymore which is really sad it is sad it should be more because there's

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:41.040
a lot of you know like resistance was a fun split-screen game but there's not a

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:44.840
lot of stuff out there Call of Duty you know that'll still do split-screen but

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:49.440
it's not a lot out there and why even bother you know working on this

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:54.840
technology for like a handful of games say you think blur split-screen the

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:57.440
racing game except everyone hates that game for some reason I don't know why

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:01.000
it's not that bad but you know who does have the technology to handle split

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.240
screen flawlessly and who couldn't could bring split screen all our homes the

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:11.600
Skynet just saying I can get behind that all right but I mean if you really if

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:18.960
this is such an issue I mean I just I I don't understand I yeah some of your

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:23.680
screens you know blocked out I've never had the problem where it's like oh my

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:27.880
god this is just so painful I can't play this game anymore in split-screen oh my

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:32.320
day is ruined you know I can't imagine that that would be a problem yeah

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:36.280
because I need to go hey look we can play it to you know a two-player game or

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:40.360
whatever but what's gonna stop someone from say I don't know adjusting the

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:43.840
shutters on their glasses to sneak a peek at what you're doing it's exactly

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:50.080
the same shit all over again I get motion sick with split screens really

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:54.600
you can't just focus on one no mines don't work that way but you also can't

01:12:54.600 --> 01:13:00.200
play first-person shooters so anyways but like when we were doing racing games

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:05.840
on split screens it would actually give me a headache after a while even Mario

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:10.480
Kart on the old Super Nintendo yeah really that's too bad that was like the

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:14.400
king of split screen right there yeah it was because the aspect rate will

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:20.720
especially for the older ones the aspect ratio is changed so badly that it really

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:26.800
starts putting a strain on my eyes too bad alright well I'm moving on to

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.960
something that I don't know if they'll be able to put split screen into this

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:33.800
but it's a new technology ish thing coming to PlayStation home it's a

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:40.600
partnership with codename codename I guess is this indie game label that is

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:46.640
gonna never heard of the content for PlayStation home one of the games whoa

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:53.560
wait yeah I think you put out content like sodium one I know right well what

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:58.600
if one of the first games is called dueling gentleman is the first game I

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:04.200
wonder if that will be like I don't know like dueling gentleman sounds a lot like

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:07.600
like when I think of dual I think of that game wild gunman on the old

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:12.560
Nintendo system ok here's here is wild gunman on the NES if you've never played

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:18.200
it's a light gun game and when the game says draw you push the button on the gun

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:24.680
as fast as you can and on harder rounds you have to pull the trigger faster so

01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:28.480
maybe that's a dueling gentleman will be as it'll be press X button to win

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:34.640
because that's all wild gunman was by the way it was like a $30 $40 game back

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:37.600
in the day alright to be fair I have no idea what the hell this game is about

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:42.520
there is a little bit of info though about this you're gonna be using I guess

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:49.280
strategy in homes plaza to go against other people in home I have no idea what

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:52.800
that is but I guess also peanut galleries and other developer they're

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:56.520
gonna be making minor battle it's a capture the flag type of game and then

01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:01.600
codename is making super awesome mountain RPG it's gonna have tabletop

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:05.840
port board games with fantasy role-playing I could be interesting

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:09.320
bringing like a little bit of tabletop in a home so because they have super and

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:14.720
awesome in the title does not mean it's gonna be super awesome in fact actually

01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:18.880
having super and awesome in the title usually means it's not super awesome a

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:24.680
game by lazy eight called cogs will be in 3d and it will be a dynamic pub

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:30.760
public spectacle in home central plaza really I thought the furry dance-off day

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:36.160
and Sony home was the dynamic public spectacle but maybe that's just me I

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:41.840
don't know oh I got your dynamic public spectacle and any of this is gonna be

01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:47.200
able to be translated into I don't know stuff for my apartment or a club is this

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:52.440
gonna expand the clubs in any way maybe I don't know yeah I don't think they

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.680
haven't said because it's not gonna happen

01:15:54.680 --> 01:16:02.400
didn't sodium one like have a shirt oh my god I totally misinterpreted sodium

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:06.680
one then it's the most awesome it's the super awesomest thing ever cuz I got a

01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:10.360
shirt you couldn't you can win a shirt but but Loki it's not actually a real

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:14.080
shirt it's not like back in the Atari 2600 days or they would actually send

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:17.040
you patches for your jacket if you got a high enough score and like you know

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:21.240
barnstorming or ever and they should do that that's that's what that's what

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:27.040
achievements are their virtual I can't wear my achievements Microsoft get on

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:32.240
that oh wait what if you could wear your achievements you technically can on your

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:35.960
avatars somewhat they have those new unlockable things that you do for

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:40.960
different things that's what I want like on left 4 dead 2 for the 8 360 once you

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:45.040
unlock five or six achievements you would unlock a leopard at 2 t-shirt for

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:49.640
your avatar which you could then wear and go on one versus a hundred and show

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:53.720
off your left 4 dead 2 t-shirt they've done that in a few games but not a lot

01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:56.120
of used it yet and I wonder if it's something we'll start seeing more in the

01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:59.400
next couple years like blur you can get a shirt for your avatar and blur too I

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:02.000
think there's a couple of shirts you can get one of them is really easy to get

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.240
because I got it like I have a sombrero in for Red Dead Redemption I'm which I

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:12.600
noticed the other day I'm like oh okay wonderful

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:18.080
well we'll see if the indie games are worth launching home but for now Dark

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:24.120
Sakura what do you got for us I have more stuff specifically for our buddies

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:30.680
overseas in the UK this is about the halo reach Xbox 360 bundle I don't know

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:37.480
how much of it maps over to the US but I'm focusing on our friends overseas at

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:44.960
any rate um it's gonna be exclusive to game and game station it will be a

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:54.800
$249.99 that's pounds will be out on September 14th it will have the

01:17:54.800 --> 01:18:00.320
limited-edition wireless controller the wireless headset those will be available

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:05.320
in the UK on the 3rd of September and we're actually getting it later than

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:11.380
they are over there the controller is going to be $39.99 the headset will be

01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:22.080
$34.99 and they are going to be limited and available for pre-order now as far

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:28.760
as in the u.s. I believe that we're getting the bundle for $399 on September

01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:33.760
14th so a new controller will be available on yeah maybe fix the fucking

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:42.240
d-pad yet new for the record our wireless controller is going to be 60 bucks and

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:48.560
come with a covenant banshee avatar token for Xbox Live and the headset will

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:54.960
be 50 bucks over here and they will be in late August $60 for a controller like

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:58.280
I realize that's how much they cost now but it's just got controllers are

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:01.600
expensive it's a little ridiculous especially for a controller that's

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:07.520
essentially defective all right all right let's travel around the world and

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:10.320
see what you can waste your money on this week in the world of gaming Loki

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:13.400
will start with you there's a couple things this week that are worth

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:18.040
mentioning obviously Starcraft 2 on PC is gonna be a big thing but you think a

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:22.320
Starcraft 2 the wings of Liberty remember there will be three versions of

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:27.840
this game why I don't I don't see the point because they'll sell it three

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:31.400
times to hold they'll sell it they'll try to sell it three times but I know

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:36.400
think the second and third versions of the game will be that great ok but that

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:42.600
will be coming out this week on PC a game called galaxy racers coming to the

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:48.860
DS thanks to Ubisoft it is just like it sounds a game re-erasing space clash of

01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:54.400
the Titans coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 where you will release the

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:58.800
Kraken or at least fight the Kraken that is released upon you at least that's

01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:01.920
what I gather that movie is about because that's all I ever see in the

01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:10.760
trailers Kraken being released all right Chuck E. Cheese party games coming to the

01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:19.640
Wii here's a hint people it's not really a brand new game per se the company UFO

01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:26.240
interactive they have taken these games called smart girls and smart boys Club

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:30.520
and they've just re-skinned them with Chuck E. Cheese stuff you know that's

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:36.440
really unfair to the dumb boys and the dumb girls of the world I know it's sad

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:41.120
but that will be coming to the Wii Arc Rise Fantasia also coming to the Wii

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:47.800
supposed to be pretty awesome RPG if you're into fighting games blaze blue

01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:52.240
continuum shift will be coming out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 I do believe

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:57.080
PC version is going to be available soon as well although if you know where look

01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:02.840
it's already been out there for months now arcade game used to run on PC

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:11.520
hardware and that's basically it and then my god next week there's a whole

01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:16.760
bunch of junk so I got a question y'all and I want to ask this of chat as well

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:21.240
should I buy Starcraft 2 like I was a part of me that kinda wants it like

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:25.640
despite all my anger at Blizzard the past month in the show like they do make

01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:30.040
some really good games and yeah I'm terrible at RTS is but I know some of my

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:33.480
friends are buying this game and they're not very good either so I'll have people

01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:38.000
to play with right now what look cool about Starcraft 2 as the level editor

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.840
and all the like fun stuff you could do with that like you know the Mario Kart

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:46.760
type game and like stuff like that I think that will be neat well for one I

01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:50.320
want to make sure like I I kinda wanna wait for the reviews of this game to

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:56.240
come out because I want to see what they look like I want to know if my real name

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:59.900
is going to show in the battles like I want to see how far they took real ID in

01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:05.880
Starcraft 2 that be funny because like see like if I were to sign up on this I

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:09.920
don't have an account or anything and no real name so I could just like create a

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:15.480
character called dicks McButt or something like that is like you have to

01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:19.320
sign up for a battle net account to play Starcraft 2 so you know they would want

01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:24.680
you know your real name but you could always put you know Matt Loki is your

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:29.120
name and I guess they'd really be none the wiser they wouldn't be so I don't

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:32.760
know so I'm waiting to see what the game like as much as going to the midnight

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:36.160
release might be kind of fun I'm gonna really resist that temptation and just

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:39.280
like what give it a week and just kind of see what the reception is and then I

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:44.440
guess make my decision from there I personally would wait three months two

01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:47.480
or three months because you know during that first quarter after it comes out

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:51.480
they're all of the balance issues are gonna come out and they're just gonna

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:55.040
patch the hell out of it and nerf all the things that need to be nerfed so

01:22:55.040 --> 01:23:00.680
wait three months and get a more more even version of the game three months I

01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:07.200
know three months in three months dance central will be here and in cataclysm

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:10.800
will be here at DC Universal be on the way I'm gonna have time in three months

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:14.440
for cataclysm won't be here in three months okay it's gonna take at least

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:19.480
four months see Christmas Thanksgiving Christmas when is cataclysm coming out

01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:25.040
technically fall right now sometime November all right but the fall is the

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:31.600
official date so far so far yeah all right let's move on to Japan and look at

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:35.960
some of the release oh look at the some of the release dates of Japan tiger

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:38.800
claws linking me to a story that I want to get to later in our chat room I have

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:43.240
that on the list for later so we'll talk more about Starcraft 2 later in the show

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:47.160
sure zone our chat room says Dix McButt should be on the wiki the orange large

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:52.480
radio wiki maybe that's that can be like your quintessential like online name no

01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:57.760
it's just I was just trying to think of something ridiculous and I'm able to

01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:02.880
think of things that are very ridiculous all the time all right let's move on to

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:08.320

that's it right yes absolutely that's a bundle that is available they in fact I

01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:48.280
don't believe they have full band bundles for this one I think it's just

01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:56.440
well the the game by itself and then I want to say maybe they may have a full

01:30:56.440 --> 01:31:04.360
bundle but I haven't seen it I know that the keyboard game bundle is out there in

01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:08.560
fact I believe that it's already available for pre-order through certain

01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:23.000
websites and with stop and yes keyboard bundle $130 pro guitar $150 or you can

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:27.480
buy the keyboard by itself for $80 what would I do with the keyboard by itself I

01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:30.440
need a game to play well I guess I could use it as a MIDI keyboard but that that's

01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:37.520

to a real keyboard what about that gets harder than $150 yeah I don't need it I

01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:54.600

01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:09.320
go into the vault and find one game that she's been playing and say hey you kids

01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:15.440
in your comic cons and your newfangled stuff need to take a minute to respect

01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:19.520
the games that have come before you better recognize you better recognize

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:25.280
now this game I know that she picked this week isn't super old but it's older

01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:30.080
than you might think sadly it's amazing dark soccer what is the classic game of

01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:37.040
the week this week hydro thunder hydro thunder let me fire up some music here

01:35:37.040 --> 01:36:00.120
from hydro thunder I love the name of that ship damn the torpedoes this one

01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:06.560
that Dan knows at any rate it was part of the thunder series of games this game

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:12.520
came out in 1999 and had a Dreamcast release and then it came out for

01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:17.040
PlayStation and instead of 64 in 2000 and the other thunder games is offered

01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:20.080
thunder four-wheel thunder and Arctic Thunder which Arctic Thunder is pretty

01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:28.160
damn fun anyway it's racing with boats you have places like the Arctic Circle

01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:32.320
and you have New York disaster which is the post-apocalyptic you've got the Greek

01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:38.000
Isles and Thunder Park which is like a whole rally type of setting with water

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:47.600
you've got different boosts all over the place the ones that will enable you to

01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:56.240
either go for a little bit or like get a lot of them the red ones are they give

01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:01.240
you more fuel as opposed to the blue one so you do have a fuel gauge at least as

01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:06.640
far as your boosts are concerned and then with boosting you can actually do

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:15.300
jumps or you can knock boats sort of off the track and it's pretty cool the

01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:20.200
arcade cabinet was the same type of cabinet is cruising USA and offered

01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:30.240
thunder except it didn't have the foot pedals I used a throttle and it had a

01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:38.840
interesting type of volume deal where he just ran over a penguin that bastard

01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:43.800
I'm just saying had a subwoofer in the seat so you could feel like you're

01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:50.440
actually on a boat I'm on a boat with your boats you had the easy ones you had

01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:58.200
four categories there were easy easy medium hard and bonus with easy you had

01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:03.400
damn the torpedoes midway and misbehave they had a big fan instead of a

01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:11.920
propeller the medium boats you had banshee tidal blade thresher and the

01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:17.940
tidal blade is the cover for the dreamcast the hard ones you had cut

01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:25.800
throat a rad hazard that was sort of like UFO and Razorback which was that

01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:30.720
was on the PlayStation 1064 ones and if you pick one of those they say you're

01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:39.040
great whoa your mic cut out again I don't know what it's something is weird

01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:42.640
in that connection I don't know what it is you look at the cord and I'll use the

01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:49.400
other one all right how's this perfect okay um with the bonus boats you had

01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:54.720
tiny tannic which was a small version of the Titanic and you had the blowfish

01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:59.600
and chumdinger which was a fishing boat it would actually bark at the other

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:05.320
boats you also have armed response which is the police boats with a turret guns

01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:08.940
there was all the different tracks like I mentioned with Thunder Park lost

01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:12.800
island the Arctic Circle then going into medium with Lake Powell which is one that

01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:18.160
was really fun it's like a lake in the middle of Utah that's actually the same

01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:23.560
Lake Powell supposed to be there's a Far East Greek Isles and then the hard

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:27.560
tracks there was ship graveyard Venice canals in New York disaster which New

01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:31.840
York disaster was actually kind of my favorite and then the bonus ones you had

01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:37.840
Castle Von Dandy Nile adventure which was the longest tracking game catacombs

01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:44.960
and hydro speedway which was the one that was the rally style there were

01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:50.520
different versions of course like I said those the dreamcast one the PlayStation

01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:55.720
one had a career mode in it the dreamcast though was closest to the

01:39:55.720 --> 01:40:00.680
arcade of any of the consoles Nintendo 64 version was actually amazingly fun

01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:06.320
and really good for what it was it had a four player multiplayer instead of two

01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:11.600
player and you could do that with Nintendo 64 expansion pack and the

01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:16.280
dreamcast version is the one that's on Midway arcade treasures 3 there's also a

01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:20.960
PC version that was out in Europe the dreamcast version was one of the Sega

01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:28.440
all-star titles and there is going to be a sequel out well there's a spiritual

01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:32.840
sequel already out called h2 overdrive which is pretty fun the original team

01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:37.880
that worked on hydro Thunder did h2 overdrive button through all thrills and

01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:46.680
then hydro Thunder hurricane is going to be out on xbox live arcade and Microsoft

01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:51.720
bought the rights after Midway was acquired by Warner Brothers so there you

01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:54.120

01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:31.800
story about the Kmart was going to be start to post reviews of it from their

01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:34.880
website they would actually post them on the shelves the story guys remember us

01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:40.400
talking about this okay well apparently um as well we told our listeners that

01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:43.660
they should start writing these completely nonsensical like stupid

01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:47.040
things and submit them into the Kmart reviews and that would be really funny

01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:50.800
just like flood their reviews a bunch of dumb stuff well we had at least one

01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:56.320

01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:57.560
even worse good times on Kmart reviews all right let's get into the rapid-fire

01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:01.400
news of some actual gaming news that happened this week stuff we have in

01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:07.680
short little bites for you guys Loki yes so guitar hero words of rock will be

01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:11.080
coming out in a couple months here and of course they always have to have

01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:18.640
someone epic really difficult song to play in the game well apparently there

01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:23.280
is going to be one track very similar to some other long songs that have been in

01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:33.240
the game it will include Russia's 20 minute long seven part epic 21 12 and I

01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:38.440
guess it's a few parts that are progressive rock and then I don't know

01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:43.520
I've never heard the song but that's a long ass song 20 minutes that's

01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:47.200
ridiculous it's almost like that one achievement in rock band that you have

01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:50.480
to play like every single song in the game and it takes on it like an hour or

01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:55.720
two yeah that makes me think of um any god it is my my working I don't I think

01:44:55.720 --> 01:45:00.000
barely we just you're it's it's wired for Jamie not you try giving that one to

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:05.360
Jamie and use that one live radio yeah as far as epic songs for rock band or

01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:09.680
since they have a keyboard they should do in a gada da vida which I think is a

01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:15.520
good 23 minutes with the keyboards so yeah good times yeah that song is one

01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:22.680
whole hallucination something else that was at comic-con this week and I don't

01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:27.760
even know why it was at comic-con it's like kencha Hulk type of stuff but

01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:35.480
apparently they had a game from an independent developer called a Bobo's big

01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:41.360
adventure and you may not remember a Bobo but sadly I think I do a Bobo is

01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:49.120
from Double Dragon ah yes and but was big adventure has him going through a

01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:56.040
bunch of 8-bit NES classics kind of parody style it is a PC game but they

01:45:56.040 --> 01:46:01.080
had it displayed on a cabinet I would like to read this brief I'm sure this

01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:06.760
game is extremely legal yes I would like to read this brief description of some

01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:14.120
of the levels here let's see here okay the first stage that this person played

01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:19.680
looked just like Double Dragon starting off he encountered typical enemies and

01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:22.920
fought them off with the exact same control scheme from the original Double

01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:28.200
Dragon game but then the the guys from kung-fu showed up all in a row goombas

01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:32.800
from Super Mario Brothers waddled into the screen and Kid Nicky followed and he

01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:36.240
was trying to fall fight them all off but then Donkey Kong jumped up on the

01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:40.320
surface above and started throwing exploding barrels as head has it was

01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:45.800
like all of NES done was out to get him I these they only felt better when an

01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:51.120
8-bit bystander walked up to a Bobo and he ripped his head off and ate it and

01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:57.440
then used his body to fight a charging skateboard from TNC surf what there's

01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:04.000
another another level called super my Bobo found a bow in a jail cell after

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:08.600
picking up trash and eating it a Bobo had to use the cell toilet something he

01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:12.520
ate must not have agreed with him because a massive vertical column of

01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:17.120
shit came out of his ass and somehow had him flying over the toilet and falling

01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:22.560
down into or down into it yes you're just making this up really this ends up

01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:26.000
to being like a warp pipe the Super Mario Brothers and both finds himself in

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.680
a parody of the water world from that game and he has a Yoshi like tongue that

01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:35.120
enables him to eat and spit enemies into other enemies there's also apparently

01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:43.120
some Megaman I saw in there I feel like a bunch of like 19 year olds got really

01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:47.720
high one night and in between eating Cheetos they just started like talking

01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:52.520
and somebody was like dude dude that's really good like dude show the dude

01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:56.840
that's hella funny dude dude you should write that down dude and like they did

01:47:56.840 --> 01:48:00.920
like things to get posted to new grounds when you're blackout drunk basically

01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:04.760
funny that you should mention that new grounds because that's where this game

01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:10.160
will be featured at some what a surprise as what a goddamn surprise I'm gonna

01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:16.200
fall over and die from that surprise dot-com so yeah but was big adventure

01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:22.680
supposed to be out in December it looks funny I guess I don't know and then

01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:29.440
finally that plot he read sounded like the plot to the poop that took a pee the

01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:35.680
poop that took a pee it was on an episode as narrated by Morgan Freeman

01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:41.320
why it was Morgan Freeman it wasn't Morgan Freeman the poop that took a pee

01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:47.960
he can I Leo Poland a butterscotch anything uh legend of mana is gonna be

01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:53.240
the next game hitting the Japanese PlayStation 1 classics nice on the

01:48:53.240 --> 01:49:05.640
PlayStation Network of course be out next week for 600 in or 650 so I mean

01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:11.800
it's gonna be to other regions soon speaking of poops it took a pee like

01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:16.120
legend of man it's like seriously like my least favorite PlayStation game I was

01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:20.840
so disappointed in that game I realized it has its fans and what have you but I

01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:25.680
was I was expecting what I think was really then keep in mind this was many

01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:28.640
years ago I didn't know there was this whole like import gaming scene

01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:33.520
everything so in my mind what really was second at set to three I thought was

01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:36.400
what I was kind of getting with was going to get with legend of mana and

01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:41.640
then it was like I don't understand what what what is this but you liked it

01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:45.040
didn't you Alan you tell me one day I did I did like it's wrong I played it

01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:47.960
all the way through I did every little stupid class you probably like saga

01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:54.720
frontier too well I had the Japanese it was terrible and it was so hard it was

01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:59.840
so heavy language wise I couldn't play it very well do you like the saga

01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:05.480
series too yeah I got I was really excited about saga frontier because it

01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:09.880
made it sound like chrono trigger with the combo attacks okay yeah and I played

01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:14.280
it and yeah that was pretty awful behind lasted an hour yeah I lasted about an

01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:18.120
hour to us like this game is terrible all right anyhow let's move on to some

01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:23.760
other quick news hey up there in canadia you're gonna be getting Netflix finally

01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:26.840
of course I'm talking about Canada I'm not that stupid

01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:31.280
Canada's finally getting Netflix I actually I gotta be honest I didn't

01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:34.920
realize they didn't already have it like I usually with a lot of this broadcast

01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:39.040
stuff they get the rights cleared pretty quickly but sadly yeah Canada's kind of

01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:44.320
been shut out so they will finally be getting Netflix up there but you should

01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:48.000
be aware if you're French Canadian and you don't speak English well I don't

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:51.800
know why you're listening to this show for one but yeah the French Netflix

01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:55.120
service is not going to be out right away but it will come out eventually so

01:50:55.120 --> 01:51:01.040
you will be able to get this in Canada on the 360 the ps3 and we so they are

01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:04.000
not really they're being a little vague on if it's going to be the exact same

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.840
movies and so forth because the clearance is and so forth but they do

01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:11.840
give you the nice little marketing fluff of Canadian Netflix members will be able

01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:15.660
to instantly watch a broad array of movies and TV episodes right on their

01:51:15.660 --> 01:51:20.200
TVs via a range of consumer electronic devices capable of streaming from

01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:27.120
Netflix as well as PCs and Macs so yeah I you know you're going to be getting it

01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:30.440
but it's probably not going to look the exact same as it does here at least not

01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:36.480
right away so yeah Joystick had emailed Netflix looking for comment and Netflix

01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:40.320
responded to the big blog we're not announcing the Netflix ready devices

01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:43.960
until the service launches but it's fair to assume that several popular brand

01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:47.360
name devices will be capable of streaming from Netflix to TVs at launch

01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:51.280
in addition to the ability to watch instantly on computers and that will add

01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:55.960
to the family of devices over time so hooray for you guys in Canada I suppose

01:51:55.960 --> 01:52:01.880
Plants vs. Zombies is going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade finally early

01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:05.840
September I played I played this on an iPad this week a little bit because yes

01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:12.120

01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:27.360
fans is that they're doing an online version of Street Fighter 3 third strike

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:36.800
which they're calling it Street Fighter 3 third strike online which is an update

01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:40.440
to the Dreamcast one but you want to know what they already made it and I

01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:45.480
already own it it was the for matching service you remember how when everything

01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:49.880
has a long title I usually end for matching service on it that's it it came

01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:55.240
out in Japan already so I've already got it yeah but most people over here never

01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:58.360
heard of it so you know with the success of their online games I'm assuming

01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:02.240

Twitter topics twitter.com slash olr you guys send us tweets every week and we

01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:34.280
respond to them live on air maybe there's stories we didn't get around to

01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:39.360
sharing who knows what it's all about we're gonna start off with death death

01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:44.680
wishing tonight do you guys hate Kotek to the evil CEO he's my least favorite

01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:50.880
human being next to Aquaman do we hate Bobby Kotek hey is a strong word and yes

01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:56.680
but yes all right um TigerClaw305 sent us a link he always sends us great

01:55:56.680 --> 01:56:01.800
links Disney is in talks apparently to buy Playdom. Playdom by the way made such

01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:06.640
awesome Facebook games like sorority life didn't Disney just buy somebody

01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:11.440
Disney bought what Tapulous and so now Disney is in talks with Playdom buy them

01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:15.920
out for five hundred million is what they're saying again these are all

01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:19.840
rumors but Disney's gonna use this company to incorporate its popular

01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:23.760
brands and characters into social games Playdom by the way is based out of

01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:28.280
Mountain View California I never knew that that's not that far away so yeah

01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:32.040
there you go apparently Disney might use its ESPN brands on some of this as well

01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:37.320
could be very interesting Playdom ranks third behind Zynga and Playfish by the

01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:45.840
way just you know of big social game companies let's see some folks retreat

01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:50.000
we're tweeting our congratulatory message to Bobby so grads Bobby

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:55.600
let's see spazz nator says do you think we'll ever see a Mortal Kombat versus

01:56:55.600 --> 01:56:58.720
Street Fighter game there's been a lot of talk tonight about Street Fighter

01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:04.800
cross Tekken what about the two ultimate I guess in some regards maybe even top

01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:08.760
if you dare go there fighting game franchises Street Fighter Mortal Kombat

01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:11.680
could it ever happen what do you guys think good Street Fighter versus Mortal

01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:16.120
Kombat ever happened it could they play nice with Warner I mean obviously

01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:24.240
they're playing nice with other you know publishers so it could happen whether it

01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:28.280
will happen or not I don't know I think someone did a Mugen one where they took

01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:35.080
the the Street Fighter movie ones in the old Mortal Kombat that were all the

01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:39.640
image capture and did a Mugen version Mortal Kombat is sort of all about the

01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:43.280
fatalities and the over-the-topness and you know all those Street Fighter has

01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:45.840
some over-the-top I don't know if I could see it like I can't see the

01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:48.820
Street Fighter characters really doing fatalities and then if you take the

01:57:48.820 --> 01:57:52.520
fatalities on a Mortal Kombat like what's left you know now what if they

01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:58.720
did Mortal Kombat versus crap that eternal champions what you got it how

01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:02.120
long ago is eternal champions eternal champions needs to come back with the

01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:06.600
Senate bills and everything just do a real kill again throw kill is horrible

01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:12.240
yeah I don't see a game where Sakura gets her spine ripped out I just I can't

01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:16.040
I can't there is something wrong with that like how would you feel about that

01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:19.920
dark Sakura if there was a game where you could just like totally rip Sakura's

01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:29.200
arms off well as long as they included a non-black your ear out again it's just

01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:36.960
a dammit though I am I in now yeah okay I was basically saying if they included

01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:41.640
a non blacked-out version of the shingle kusatsu with all kinds of you know

01:58:41.640 --> 01:58:46.080
beating up and you know breaking noses and bones and having it be really

01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:50.080
destructive and leave them as a bloody pulp then maybe I could deal with it I

01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:54.040
don't know there just would have to be too much compromise one way or the other

01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:57.600
I just don't see like Street Fighter and Tekken kind of makes sense and as much

01:58:57.600 --> 01:59:00.720
as I love Soul Calibur like it wouldn't make sense like the Street Fighter

01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:03.680
people don't use weapons weapons are a huge part of Soul Calibur it would make

01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:10.040
sense so but Street Fighter Tekken yeah I get that I get it all right let's see

01:59:10.040 --> 01:59:16.960
other comments on our twitter twitter.com slash o-l-r Matt SJ 100 Matt is

01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:20.800
sending us a tweet is Capcom jumping the shark releasing all of these versus

01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:25.320
games all at once I'm excited but this should have happened ten years ago

01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:30.240
honestly thank Street Fighter 4 I honestly think Street Fighter 4 is the

01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:33.740
reason for a lot of this and I think the really warm reception the community had

01:59:33.740 --> 01:59:37.440
to this kind of made them decide to listen to the fans a little more and now

01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:41.760
they are just just giving fans what they want left and right it's kind of like

01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:46.000
what game do you want oh you want oh well here you go then it's kind of where

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:50.720
Capcom is going lately you know so I don't know dark soccer do you think this

01:59:50.720 --> 01:59:56.640
is too much or not enough or what I think it's just right all right all

01:59:56.640 --> 02:00:01.920
right and last tweet from rock man rock that's not a redundant name at all I

02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:06.940
love that name rock man rock why are you guys so awesome is the tweet why are you

02:00:06.940 --> 02:00:13.320
guys so awesome I was born that way well it's that's very nice I some days I do

02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:17.120
think I'm awesome but some days I don't feel so awesome

02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:22.040
but Rob why not I just you know some days are harder than others but your

02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:25.320
tweets help me get through the day I appreciate it

02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:29.520
twitter.com slash olr if you want to send us some tweets for now more news

02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:38.520
loki yes so apparently their rock star is cracking down on Red Dead Redemption

02:00:38.520 --> 02:00:44.080
cheaters now I have a problem with them saying that because that's not exactly

02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:49.120
what's going on here they're cutting I guess they're cracking down on people

02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:53.920
that are utilizing glitches in the game for example they're saying that people

02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:57.680
are glitching into parts of the map that you're not supposed to be able to glitch

02:00:57.680 --> 02:01:03.720
into like for example there's a house that's in kind of the Mexico part of the

02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:09.800
game or you can actually kind of aim at or walk into the corner of a wall and

02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:14.360
you'll clip through the ground and you can shoot at stuff underneath it and

02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:18.360
apparently people are pissed off that they're getting shot by people that they

02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:22.760
can't shoot back at and so because of that you know they're gonna start

02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:26.160
patching the game or fixing it so they can't clip through these different

02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:31.840
things whatever fine do that people will just find other glitches since the game

02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:37.720
is super glitchy but it's not legitimate cheating say you know where they've

02:01:37.720 --> 02:01:41.400
modded the game to make their guns fire rockets or something like that like that

02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:47.960
happens in Grand Theft Auto like crazy no one's figured out how to do that yet

02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:52.480
because exploits are not hacks there's a huge difference between an exploit and a

02:01:52.480 --> 02:01:56.520
hack exactly and you know I don't understand why people are up in arms

02:01:56.520 --> 02:02:01.880
about this crap because you just don't go where those players are then because

02:02:01.880 --> 02:02:05.840
you can see them on the map they're not invisible and obviously if they're under

02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:10.360
a building or something they keep shooting at you then perhaps you should

02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:17.280
walk away from them I mean there's no real hacks or whatever to say you know

02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:20.920
immediately kill somebody you know with homing bullets or something ridiculous

02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:24.960
like that nothing like that yet but you know when they make a gun that starts

02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:28.840
firing dynamite or something that's different but just because people are

02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:32.760
you know clipping through stuff doesn't really necessarily make it a cheat I

02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:36.080
also agree that exploits are not cheating because like you know I've

02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:39.680
played a lot of these online games like you know kind of like fan games don't

02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:42.720
make fun me okay I like Survivor and Big Brother and a lot of those like a

02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:46.480
reality shows that have very game centric things and you know people put

02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:50.400
together challenges and I love to find loopholes in the challenge rules and win

02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:52.640
every time like that's you know I do that

02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:55.680
unity is very important I do similar stuff in Grand Theft Auto there's

02:02:55.680 --> 02:03:00.440
different exploits you can use they're not necessarily it's not cheating I

02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:04.080
guess because it's still playing within the rules of game and everybody can do

02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:08.200
it just because they don't know about it doesn't that's not my problem that you

02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:11.920
don't you know read up on this stuff like there's a way to fire the sniper

02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:18.720
rifle really fast by crouching and crouching there's ways to fall off a

02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:26.040
large from a large distance and not take any damage by doing a stunt role in mid

02:03:26.040 --> 02:03:30.760
air you know stuff like that but you know it's stuff that I've learned through

02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:36.600
you know just reading online and through when you've seen people do stuff and

02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:38.880
kind of figuring out how they did different things and it makes me a

02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:43.680
better player now granted it's not like I'm using you know modded weapons that

02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:47.480
fire rockets at people like crazy and there's lots of people out there to do

02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:51.480
that there's a difference between utilizing you know the nuances of the

02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:56.960
game you know the different glitches and actually cheating in the game to the

02:03:56.960 --> 02:04:03.520
point that it's an unfair advantage knowledge is not cheating cheating is

02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:07.840
cheap alright and if you cheat in an online game you're kind of a dick anyway

02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:11.960
unless you're cheating with your friends and you all agree that cheating is okay

02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:16.800
that's different well if you're doing that then you know like the modded games

02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:20.360
that will play against each other that's not necessarily cheating it's just

02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:24.360
you're playing with a whole different set of rules now or fun it's it's a mod

02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:28.520
it's not it's not cheating it's like if we played our with our modded weapons

02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:34.560
against other players that would be cheating so a mod it's a mod here Loki

02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:38.120
here's something to entertain you while I do this next story here here you go

02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:43.000
how to entertain you for I am NOT I'm not playing this on an iPhone I'm sorry

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:48.040
I feel dirty for having robot unicorn attack and it's it's it's Loki's

02:04:48.040 --> 02:04:51.040
favorite game and they have an iPhone it's not my favorite game but yes it is

02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:53.160
your favorite game you play it all the time during the show I'm surprised you're

02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:56.680
not playing it tonight and they have it on the iPhone now and it you know you

02:04:56.680 --> 02:05:00.280
just tap the screen to do your jumping and I can't see you this directions I'm

02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:04.400
probably falling everywhere but there you go I played this a lot this week too

02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:10.600
all right good times remember always I want to be I almost forgot to show that

02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:14.560
to Loki was something reminded me of that early I knew it was out other

02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:18.360
people like me I can't believe you made me buy that game because it's you know

02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:21.600
you keep talking about like I haven't played it in like months now you are

02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:25.280
playing it last week on the show I was not playing it last week on the show

02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:29.520
two weeks ago on the show it wasn't two weeks ago either yes it was I'll go in

02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:33.720
the archives and find it and like if you if you turn up the music really loud in

02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:41.000
the background you'll hear oh you should totally make this for your baby's room

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:49.200
what's that it's a toadstool stool sorry and I told you and I'm easily out of it

02:05:49.200 --> 02:05:52.400
easily distracted kind of that's all right well here's something that's very

02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:56.880
distracting it's this Old Spice ad on the left side of this page here with the

02:05:56.880 --> 02:06:00.880
Old Spice guy because you know he's awesome anyhow I know really it's about

02:06:00.880 --> 02:06:05.320
the Mega Man universe a little more information I mean little little more

02:06:05.320 --> 02:06:11.440
information at comic-con this week from Akiko Ido actually talked about this a

02:06:11.440 --> 02:06:16.400
little bit he's the producer I'm sorry actually it's a Kenji Inafune actually

02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:21.440
talked about this he's the producer of Mega Man universe and no he's the

02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:26.320
creator of Mega Man no he's a homeless man I don't know Kenji Inafune is the

02:06:26.320 --> 02:06:32.080
creator of Mega Man and Akiko Ido is the Mega Man universe producer there we go

02:06:32.080 --> 02:06:36.520
can't you tell I'm like totally up on my video game trivia anyway Mega Man

02:06:36.520 --> 02:06:41.080
universe of course is coming out eventually and they say it will let you

02:06:41.080 --> 02:06:46.680
play as the Mega Man of your dreams the concept of Mega Man universe quote came

02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:51.840
from the idea of what Mega Man is and what it means to different people

02:06:51.840 --> 02:06:57.680
everyone has a unique idea of what Mega Man is and they even referred to the

02:06:57.680 --> 02:07:02.040
quote crappy version of Mega Man from the original cartridge that character

02:07:02.040 --> 02:07:07.560
they don't know about they didn't really say like what the game really really is

02:07:07.560 --> 02:07:10.640
but a lot of people are inferring like maybe it's just like that and I think

02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:13.640
Loki said this last week on the show it's kind of like that Nintendo

02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:16.840
championships or whatever they call that game with all the Nintendo characters

02:07:16.840 --> 02:07:23.120
the Nintendo crossover game or Mario crossover right they say that it's gonna

02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:27.040
quote unite Mega Man fans from around the planet to play together in one place

02:07:27.040 --> 02:07:30.640
then they close by saying you haven't heard the last of the Mega Man

02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:34.080
announcements out there and they say they're gonna give an oft requested

02:07:34.080 --> 02:07:38.840
thing to what you guys want and the crowd promptly started shouting Mega Man

02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:45.440
Legends 3 and he just smiled and said thank you and didn't confirm I hope so

02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:49.560
by the way the game we're gonna be we only cuz I will be pissed the game will

02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:53.840
also not be out for a while I don't know what a while is but it's gonna be a

02:07:53.840 --> 02:08:00.040
while I want to know where the universe thing is if that means online or if

02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:03.240
that's because of all the characters in it I think it's gonna have all the

02:08:03.240 --> 02:08:07.280
different games in it be in another galaxy thank you dark Tetsuya Super

02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:12.080
Mario crossover that's what I was thinking of alright dark soccer what do

you got for us stuff and this is for Marvel vs. Capcom actually which is some

02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:24.840

said I am doom that's cool okay super scroll who is a newbie in the versus

02:08:58.320 --> 02:09:03.600
whole deal and he's I guess we're gonna have all the powers of the Fantastic

02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:12.040
Four and Trish mmm Trish and in the teaser trailer there was the outline of

02:09:12.040 --> 02:09:20.280
the beautiful Joe so pretty cool Trish ah is leathery tasty didn't they also

02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:27.960
announce the my jumping ahead I'm sorry what the dog from Okami or did I think

02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:34.080
yeah I saw you is good yeah it's awesome I said that right yeah yeah good times

02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:40.040
all right um yeah that's and also Thor yeah so I guess there's a lot of

02:09:40.040 --> 02:09:45.880
characters they're showing mm-hmm good times look you what he got for us this

02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:50.480
is kind of funny apparently South Peak this is like the lawsuit that really no

02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:58.320
one would care about South Peak is suing Majesco over my baby three so when you

02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:04.960
over my baby apparently who that is my baby mama South Peak games that is

02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:11.400
taking a legal action against Majesco specifically regarding the right to

02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:17.760
publishing my baby titles in the United States this was spurred by an

02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:22.760
announcement last month I guess that Majesco would publish my baby three and

02:10:22.760 --> 02:10:30.480
friends an action South Peak claims Majesco wasn't legally allowed to take

02:10:30.480 --> 02:10:36.440
for its part a South Peak issued this statement on the impeding litigation

02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:42.960
we're exceptionally proud of our success in making the my baby franchise really

02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:48.920
in North America our innovative sales marketing PR strategies brought my baby

02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:54.480
to a huge audience and built no sense of shame built a loyal fan base for future

02:10:54.480 --> 02:11:01.800
products oh wow where okay South Beach continues to hold the rights to

02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:06.920
subsequent my baby games and we intend to vigorously protect those rights

02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:14.960
additionally we've confirmed that while South Peak claims a contractual right to

02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:18.800
publish subsequent my baby games in the u.s.

02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:28.160
noblest owns the my baby IP so it's up to I guess noblest to decide I guess who

02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:36.640
publishes what and yeah so basically they're just complaining about that but

02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:44.880
I don't know I think it's dumb honestly I know that my baby games sell somewhat

02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:49.720
because people people like their sim games and little girls love this stuff

02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:55.920
but I mean honestly we're talking like these games sell maybe maybe 200,000

02:11:55.920 --> 02:11:59.360
units I mean those are like I've judgment numbers there I mean to give

02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:07.680
you an example how how much these fail so I don't know I'm surprised that they

02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:11.080
wouldn't be suing like for say babysitting mama or something like that

02:12:11.080 --> 02:12:16.680
I'm surprised these games are such a big fucking deal in the first place you'd be

02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:21.480
surprised like imagine games they're terrible they have so many that come out

02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:27.640
they sell and even like littlest pet shop which I hate you EA and you're

02:12:27.640 --> 02:12:32.840
fucking three versions of the game they got to put out each year those sell well

02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:40.720
too it's just weird all right well this is also kind of weird but cool I guess

02:12:40.720 --> 02:12:44.400
that it was considered but it didn't happen this is running on a website I've

02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:49.960
not heard of these guys before but gamer annex.com was running this story and it

02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:53.440
kind of caught wind and ended up on a lot of game blogs this week and it was a

02:12:53.440 --> 02:12:58.960
comment that Rahul sued the voodoo PC founder and he's also the current CTO of

02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:03.200
gaming at Hila Packard he actually revealed a couple months ago that there

02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:08.080
was a secret project or an interesting one or a quiet one nonetheless at

02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:12.480
Microsoft it would have allowed PC gamers to actually match up with console

02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:15.920
players so it wouldn't just be like Final Fantasy 11 wouldn't be the only

02:13:15.920 --> 02:13:21.720
game they'll be cross it is not the only game what else is cross platform shadow

02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:27.280
run was cross platform right okay and also I believe there was another

02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:33.720
strategy game that was man I don't remember which one it was there was I

02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:38.400
want to see minesweeper was a kingdom under fire or something like that it was

02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:43.320
some sort of game similar that that was cross-platform by no shadow run was well

02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:47.280
they were testing Gears of War and unreal tournament but it didn't end up

02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:51.760
happening here's why I've heard from reliable this is a quote from our whole

02:13:51.760 --> 02:13:55.160
suit I've heard from reliable sources that during the development they brought

02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:59.480
together the best console gamers to play mediocre PC gamers at the same game and

02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:03.360
guess what happened they pitted console gamers with their console controller

02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:07.640
against PC gamers with their keyboard and mouse the console players got

02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:12.520
destroyed every time so much so that it would be embarrassing to the Xbox team

02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:17.040
in general had Microsoft launched this initiative I know there's a little bit

02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:20.360
of that that sounds fanboy to me especially knowing that these other

02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:24.000
games are out there what what are you coughing about over there when we played

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:27.560
Left 4 Dead online together on our PCs and I found out that you were playing

02:14:27.560 --> 02:14:32.400
with the Xbox controller I was giving you side-eye for that reason why I was

02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:38.440
mouse mouse and keyboard is superior and now this is I was is the story I tell

02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:42.800
you if they had cross-platform playing Grand Theft Auto I would eat up any PC

02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:46.720
player anybody out there I would destroy them but that's not a first-person

02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:50.080
shooter and I think it doesn't matter it still has first-person shooter kind of

02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:56.320
controls I would destroy them all of them I don't give a shit if you're using

02:14:56.320 --> 02:15:01.120
a tomato to control the game I will destroy you feel like there's this whole

02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:05.960
kind of like fanboy war about keyboard and mouse versus Xbox 360 controllers

02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:09.680
that is continuing to be perpetuated on this very program all they need to do is

02:15:09.680 --> 02:15:15.400
just offer keyboard mouse support for these games on the Xbox oh wait but then

02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:20.000
they wouldn't be able to sell $60 controllers I guess but I mean this way

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:24.760
it wouldn't be that damn hard there's USB ports I mean would it be really

02:15:24.760 --> 02:15:28.640
difficult to I don't know map keys in a game or something you can't work well

02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:32.080
you can mouse here's the funny thing you can plug in a keyboard I used to use a

02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:37.840
keyboard on fancy 11 for certain games but in I guess if you know by certain

02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:43.200
accessories there's ways that kind of shoehorn it in there but why they don't

02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:47.240
offer it as an actual solution for you know say Call of Duty and stuff like

02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:51.300
that is beyond me because I think that'd be a great idea but then again they

02:15:51.300 --> 02:15:55.240
wouldn't be able to sell accessories like they do I don't really think it's a

02:15:55.240 --> 02:15:58.320
big deal because most people probably buy a controller anyways they're not

02:15:58.320 --> 02:16:02.440
going to just use strictly keyboard mouse for everything but it'd be kind of

02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:10.880
cool and I wonder if they could actually do that like have support for that I'm

02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:13.400
trying to look at some of our comments in our chat room chat that orders on

02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:16.600
show you a calm legend is aku is saying Loki prepare for an ass-whooping with an

02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:21.240
eight-year-old logitech mouse I think but unfortunately you can't I mean you

02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:25.120
can't with you can't with Grantham auto because it's not a wall obviously

02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:29.560
because it's not crashed no cross-platform and especially if it's on

02:16:29.560 --> 02:16:37.000
360 there's nothing cross-platform anymore that's too bad bonds 006 in our

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:43.840
chat says I will die with a keyboard in my hands I've tried playing keyboard

02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:48.120
mouse I just I don't don't like it I you have to play team fortress 2 with it

02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:51.320
like you can't use a controller in team fortress 2 and it's probably part of the

02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:53.760
reason I'm forced to play a medic because you don't really have to aim

02:16:53.760 --> 02:16:59.440
very well you should lay on the 360 I guess I could but then I'd have to buy

02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:04.080
the game again I already bought it on Steam I remember when Left 4 Dead 2 came

02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:08.200
out last November and there was a lot of drama on a lot of the major blogs like

02:17:08.200 --> 02:17:12.680
joystick and Kotaku who played the 360 version of the game and they gave it

02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:17.240
like mediocre reviews saying it was too hard and then the sites that reviewed it

02:17:17.240 --> 02:17:22.560
on PC said it was fine and I guess the people played it on Xbox 360 just

02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:27.040
couldn't they just kept getting wiped out so I think you know the game was

02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:30.560
developed for both platforms but the keyboard mouse people just had an

02:17:30.560 --> 02:17:34.880
advantage I don't know keep fanning those flames yeah and it's like why did

02:17:34.880 --> 02:17:38.960
you give that game a seven it all came down to the controller according to the

02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:42.360
reviewers again I hate to keep going back to this and it's not a first-person

02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:45.160
shooter but Final Fantasy 11 you could play with the controller in that game

02:17:45.160 --> 02:17:48.960
and Jamie didn't she did quite well with it I mean you have to set up your

02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:54.360
macros in advance but you can do it but I I would I had the triggers on top and

02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:58.520
I would just cycle through my macro see my trigger buttons mm-hmm and Rob Rob

02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:02.640
saw me do it mm-hmm the complete edition was like five bucks on Steam this week I

02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:05.800
saw that it was a part of me that just just kind of wanted to play it for a

02:18:05.800 --> 02:18:09.920
month really it really was gonna come down to if you want to do games that are

02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:13.520
cross-platform like that and you want to have everybody on come the same page you

02:18:13.520 --> 02:18:17.000
make the controls more console friendly I guess because that's what they're

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:22.840
doing with DC universes they're making the stuff kind of translate over you

02:18:22.840 --> 02:18:27.240
know it the controls are simple as it is and so it translates over well to the

02:18:27.240 --> 02:18:31.280
actual controller I I was you know it's funny and I don't know if I should be

02:18:31.280 --> 02:18:35.240
repeating this but I was told that the three that the part of the reason why

02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:39.320
the games are not cross-server at this time is because it played so much

02:18:39.320 --> 02:18:43.400
differently on the PC versus the PlayStation 3 and that one was having an

02:18:43.400 --> 02:18:46.720
advantage over the other and I wonder if it comes down to this whole same issue

02:18:46.720 --> 02:18:52.160
it's the PlayStation controller versus keyboard mouse could be now see I'll

02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:54.760
play Warcraft with a keyboard mouse I couldn't play that with a controller I

02:18:54.760 --> 02:18:58.520
think I don't you think you can play that with a controller I don't know but

02:18:58.520 --> 02:19:03.080
be weird well like see like for example when I played PC games I use an Xbox

02:19:03.080 --> 02:19:08.620
360 controller a lot of times you know Grand Theft Auto and Crysis I played

02:19:08.620 --> 02:19:14.220
with PC or with a 360 controller it worked great for me I never had any

02:19:14.220 --> 02:19:17.600
problems getting killed I don't want to keep on with this debate I want to hear

02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:20.460
what our folks have to say in the mailbag but one more story from Dark

02:19:20.460 --> 02:19:26.320
Sakura about another MMO right yeah for Phantasy Star Universe they're getting a

02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:32.880
pretty big update there is going to be the ambition of the illuminous expansion

02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:39.120
which is a free download and I paid $15 for abortion of the illuminous like two

02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:46.520
years ago bastards the Guardians advanced content content is an automated

02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:50.520
update for the subscribers with new missions weapons items customization

02:19:50.520 --> 02:19:56.520
system and overhaul the games class classes and skills and guardians will

02:19:56.520 --> 02:20:01.920
require ambition of the illuminous to work so that's why it's free pretty much

02:20:01.920 --> 02:20:09.720
and I guess they're basically taking into account all of the problems that

02:20:09.720 --> 02:20:15.560
people had with Phantasy Star Universe that you know all the stuff they took

02:20:15.560 --> 02:20:24.400
away from online that made it so much more fun I do think PSO was more fun you

02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:29.920
think it's worth revisiting maybe hmm I don't know that I want to play it on the

02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:34.160
360 maybe to look at for like a day yeah and they shut down the servers to all

02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:39.320
the other formats didn't they think it's only on 360 now but they offered some

02:20:39.320 --> 02:20:43.960
support for free servers hmm all right well let's get into the mailbag every

02:20:43.960 --> 02:20:48.240
week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orange launch radio.com we pick a few

02:20:48.240 --> 02:20:51.320
of our favorites and make dark soccer read them for you guys live on our

02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:56.760
program mailbag at orange lounge radio.com okay this is from rubber buff the

02:20:56.760 --> 02:21:01.360
first one it I'm not going to fully review the puzzle agent game as it's

02:21:01.360 --> 02:21:05.000
much like professor Layton it's on steam by telltale games who say my max

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:09.960
episodes sold well let's say it's a game where you are in a town with OCD about

02:21:09.960 --> 02:21:15.400
puzzles there's a very little point-and-click where you play trading

02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:20.140
games to advance is mostly all dialogue and puzzles I'm also playing the game

02:21:20.140 --> 02:21:23.680
la-di-da and suddenly the game ends at what is typically the middle of the

02:21:23.680 --> 02:21:28.200
story I'm not upset about the game being too short I'm mad because the game was

02:21:28.200 --> 02:21:32.080
not listed as episodic either that or I completely missed it a game like this is

02:21:32.080 --> 02:21:36.360
typically $5 but they have a single illustrator so perhaps that bumped the

02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:42.120
game up to $10 I'm also into Xbox live arcade game limbo the game reminds me a

02:21:42.120 --> 02:21:45.160
lot of out of this world that's because you were alone and the world feels

02:21:45.160 --> 02:21:49.640
completely alien despite the familiar setting of a forest if sky remembers I

02:21:49.640 --> 02:21:54.520
made a little big planet level in the same style called UFO story and then

02:21:54.520 --> 02:21:59.620
they came it was gray silhouettes foggy and add strange lighting effects limbo

02:21:59.620 --> 02:22:04.400
even had a tire swing at the beginning of the game I'm taking no credit though

02:22:04.400 --> 02:22:08.800
it had to be coincidence plus my little big planet level is nowhere near as good

02:22:08.800 --> 02:22:13.500
as limbo in fact it gets tedious although I'm very proud of the spinning

02:22:13.500 --> 02:22:18.960
boss at the end that foggy gray noir setting is nothing new in games by the

02:22:18.960 --> 02:22:23.000
way it took me a good 80 hours to make that little big planet level a little

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:28.040
bit construction is not for the dabbler a somewhat okay level takes 80 hours I

02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:32.880
wonder what a good or great level to ice I do remember that level and when I read

02:22:32.880 --> 02:22:36.440
the email earlier this week I actually was like oh yeah it kind of did have

02:22:36.440 --> 02:22:39.840
that same kind of look and feel to it it's kind of funny I I totally remember

02:22:39.840 --> 02:22:43.160
what you talk about Robert but he says I'm going to Disney World again

02:22:43.160 --> 02:22:47.680
probably bring me back some pins jerk I want to go to Disney World pins can I go

02:22:47.680 --> 02:22:57.960
to Disney World Rob and I trade pins last one is from Troy hey olr Troy again

02:22:57.960 --> 02:23:03.200
have you guys seen the new Halo Reach Forge mode I don't know how big of the

02:23:03.200 --> 02:23:07.800
FPS fans you guys are but if you like Halo the new Forge is like a little big

02:23:07.800 --> 02:23:13.360
planet for Halo also I went on a super stardust HD week and hopefully made it

02:23:13.360 --> 02:23:17.600
pretty high on the ranking list for the big battle also people who have the

02:23:17.600 --> 02:23:21.400
games are listening really should join the big battle I know I was bored of

02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:25.240
video games so this came up and now I think I left competitive gaming again

02:23:25.240 --> 02:23:30.640
that's it oh well I'm sure the folks that put that all together will be very

02:23:30.640 --> 02:23:38.080
nice to hear that yeah very happy to hear that okay let's move on

02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:42.080
angst this is the part of the show where we get out our angst it's called the F

02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:48.280
use of the week

02:23:59.280 --> 02:24:07.040
okay the first one would be me witness a few to the hole in my hand because okay

02:24:07.040 --> 02:24:11.360
it was fine with this just the stitches cuz it would pull a little bit and it

02:24:11.360 --> 02:24:16.960
was alright but now it's like my hand is a lot more sore than it was last week

02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:20.840
since the stitches came out especially with that hole that now I have to do

02:24:20.840 --> 02:24:27.040
extra stuff to keep it closed and worth thick bandages on my palm it just makes

02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:32.200
my hand hurt a whole lot more and the sad thing with that is that typing on my

02:24:32.200 --> 02:24:39.640
keyboard hurts a lot and like I'll message people a little bit but like

02:24:39.640 --> 02:24:44.320
using my mouse hurts too but if I'm doing the two of them together then it

02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:48.360
really hurts and that's actually made it hard for me to play Star Trek online so

02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:51.160
I haven't been doing all the gaming haven't been really doing that much

02:24:51.160 --> 02:24:56.680
chatting online or anything it's just it's just really sore it's actually the

02:24:56.680 --> 02:25:00.880
whole the weird problem about it is that even though it's sore up at the top of

02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:05.080
my palm the back of my hand is really sore too and I think it's where the

02:25:05.080 --> 02:25:09.800
bruise was left over from where they did the blood drain so I'm just sore and it

02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:16.060
makes me a grumpy grumpy grumpy girl like grumpier than usual that's really

02:25:16.060 --> 02:25:25.240
grumpy alright you need some more vitamin B no I don't need more vitamin B

02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:29.800
I need ice cream look I want ice cream I don't work

02:25:29.800 --> 02:25:39.120
tomorrow just saying Loki um f you to whoever was causing some crime today on

02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:44.360
greenback lane they actually have the whole street blocked off with again tape

02:25:44.360 --> 02:25:51.120
it was ridiculous so I had to go way around it and I just like that and bad

02:25:51.120 --> 02:25:56.280
drivers people stop being stupid like just in general like I'm not talking

02:25:56.280 --> 02:25:58.880
listeners of the show clearly or not stupid because you're listening to this

02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:01.960
show but just like the people out there instead of listening to the show that

02:26:01.960 --> 02:26:06.280
are out there on greenback Avenue shooting each other stop being stupid

02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:14.320
seriously serious all right let's see my f you of the week I'm gonna give an F

02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:18.840
you to Apple I know Loki's in heaven right now but I think it's total

02:26:18.840 --> 02:26:23.680
bullshit that they release this OS that screws up my old phone forcing me to get

02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:29.640
a new phone but the new phone is not available anywhere bullshit I'm actually

02:26:29.640 --> 02:26:33.000
contemplating getting a different phone right now because I'm thinking like I

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:37.080
need the iPad who does everything the phone does but then I'm still I know I'm

02:26:37.080 --> 02:26:41.880
still biting the hand that I want to protest and I'm just a hypocrite and

02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:46.080
blah blah blah blah but let's face it the iPhone is now kind of a gaming

02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:50.400
platform there's a lot of missing out on if I don't have one slices pop what are

02:26:50.400 --> 02:26:55.880
your F use of the week F you to the month of July I'm usually endeared to

02:26:55.880 --> 02:26:59.320
this month because it's my birthday month but a lot of people that I follow

02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:03.760
on live journal that I've been reading for years have been having to deal with

02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:09.080
sudden deaths of like family members and their partners and I have a friend who

02:27:09.080 --> 02:27:13.560
had to have ankle surgery due to complications from his ankle surgery he

02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:19.440
now has pneumonia figure that one out so yeah it's been a really hard month for a

02:27:19.440 --> 02:27:23.320
lot of people that I care about online so that just sucks that I can't really

02:27:23.320 --> 02:27:27.480
be there for them because they live far away if you had a distance and people

02:27:27.480 --> 02:27:32.680
that are far away that you can't like be there for yeah I get that sucks all

02:27:32.680 --> 02:27:38.720
right I have another one quickly my brother's crazy F you to his brain

02:27:38.720 --> 02:27:46.160
disease mine too but in a whole different way you know holy he's a he's

02:27:46.160 --> 02:27:49.400
a special kind of crazy but we won't get into that on this episode of Ricky

02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:53.200
lake alright Loki is some gaming news and then we'll get to the skype line at

02:27:53.200 --> 02:28:01.400
1877 game olr Loki yes not to be outdone by Google YouTube also has an Easter egg

02:28:01.400 --> 02:28:08.040
on it that allows you to play a game apparently if you go to Google or not

02:28:08.040 --> 02:28:12.560
Google YouTube it's owned by Google now so it doesn't matter if you go to

02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:20.000
youtube.com and pull up any video whatever hold down the left arrow on

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:25.440
your keyboard and after a few seconds you should be able to play the game

02:28:25.440 --> 02:28:33.840
snake over the top I got a sneak man I used to love snake on the old cell phones

02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:38.520
fun fun times that's what I need to do I'm gonna go trade in my iPhone and go

02:28:38.520 --> 02:28:42.160
get me like one of those like old ass Nokia phones that have snake on it good

02:28:42.160 --> 02:28:48.320
times it does still work you can probably get snake for iPhone it's not

02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:57.200
the same it's not the same as much as I appreciate why we are one of the

02:28:57.200 --> 02:29:01.400
listeners of the show and I do I do think snake 360 is a good game it's just

02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:05.040
not the same as playing it on the old school cell phone you know what I mean

02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:10.080
you're right one other story for you guys then we're gonna get to the

02:29:10.080 --> 02:29:15.920
skyline 877 game olr yada yada this is about Starcraft 2 this is Starcraft 2

02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:21.200
story they're saying the launch for this is going to be big big huge gigantic

02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:25.040
because you know lots of stores are doing the midnight releases of course

02:29:25.040 --> 02:29:28.920
this game's been what like 10 years in the making blizzard is not saying how

02:29:28.920 --> 02:29:31.480
many copies of the game has been pre-ordered because they don't get into

02:29:31.480 --> 02:29:35.840
that but they are saying that it's it's gonna be big there's these midnight

02:29:35.840 --> 02:29:40.680
launch events everywhere it's a $60 game it's number one and number two on Amazon

02:29:40.680 --> 02:29:44.680
right now because obviously there's a regular and collector's edition it's

02:29:44.680 --> 02:29:49.160
been in the top 100 best-selling games for over three months Walmart staying

02:29:49.160 --> 02:29:55.320
open late GameStops Best Buys and so forth they're the this story that I'm

02:29:55.320 --> 02:29:59.200
reading from the Orange County Register which is not a video game site

02:29:59.200 --> 02:30:03.560
specifically it's more of a blizzard obviously is in Anaheim which is kind of

02:30:03.560 --> 02:30:07.560
Orange County they are talking about this 18 year old who apparently plans to

02:30:07.560 --> 02:30:12.720
wait 72 hours in line for Starcraft 2 when asked why he said it's really hard

02:30:12.720 --> 02:30:15.720
to explain I don't know it's just something I'm crazy enough to enjoy I

02:30:15.720 --> 02:30:19.640
guess if people can stand in line for Twilight for that long I guess they can

02:30:19.640 --> 02:30:25.800
do it for Starcraft 2 anyhow World of Warcraft Wrath of the Lich King sold 2.8

02:30:25.800 --> 02:30:29.600
million copies when it came out in the first 24 hours they think this could

02:30:29.600 --> 02:30:35.440
possibly top it one thing though that is not going to help sell the game is

02:30:35.440 --> 02:30:40.720
reviews there will be no reviews of Starcraft 2 Wings of Liberty before it

02:30:40.720 --> 02:30:45.360
launches on Tuesday the press will be reviewing the game when everybody else

02:30:45.360 --> 02:30:49.760
does I guess the publisher feels that the battle net service and the online

02:30:49.760 --> 02:30:54.520
features is so essential to the game that opening them up early when it's not

02:30:54.520 --> 02:30:58.080
really ready to go for the press to review it could be detrimental to the

02:30:58.080 --> 02:31:02.240
game yeah because people will pirate it like they've already know the copies

02:31:02.240 --> 02:31:05.080
have already come out but you can't play it until the battle that servers are up

02:31:05.080 --> 02:31:10.840
there's gonna be a day one patch for the game in order to give the developer

02:31:10.840 --> 02:31:14.560
quote a little bit more time to sort of get their ducks in a row that's

02:31:14.560 --> 02:31:17.760
basically telling me the game's not really totally ready and it comes out Oh

02:31:17.760 --> 02:31:22.440
Tuesday so kind of what Alan was saying earlier why don't you just wait three

02:31:22.440 --> 02:31:26.560
months for them to just actually get the game working there's a lot of pressure

02:31:26.560 --> 02:31:30.120
on it Blizzard right now because if this game is fails on launch day it's gonna

02:31:30.120 --> 02:31:33.520
be a lot of shit for it I will say this I don't know if I can stand to wait

02:31:33.520 --> 02:31:37.120
three months but I am gonna wait for the reviews of the game I think that's pretty

02:31:37.120 --> 02:31:41.560
bold of Blizzard to say yeah we're not gonna send out our game for review it'll

02:31:41.560 --> 02:31:45.000
sell without it yeah I'm a little confused because I know that a lot of

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:49.040
the major review sites to get their copy two weeks early but they're just not

02:31:49.040 --> 02:31:53.560
allowed to publish the story until release date in which case all the sites

02:31:53.560 --> 02:31:56.240
try to scoop each other so does this mean that they're not getting the game

02:31:56.240 --> 02:31:59.680
at all I don't know they're not really saying for sure but they can't play it

02:31:59.680 --> 02:32:04.280
even if they have it they can't play it well and a lot of times they can do some

02:32:04.280 --> 02:32:08.080
really shady shit with those embargoes too because a lot of times you can break

02:32:08.080 --> 02:32:13.600
the embargo if you gave the game a 90% or better like that shit really happens

02:32:13.600 --> 02:32:17.640
out there and it's kind of sick like and that's why you know we're here about

02:32:17.640 --> 02:32:21.200
really supporting the independent media because we don't have to really play by

02:32:21.200 --> 02:32:25.040
those rules granted we don't get the early copies of the games because of it

02:32:25.040 --> 02:32:29.960
but you know just keep in mind if this site got a world exclusive review and

02:32:29.960 --> 02:32:34.520
it's like the first to run with it if that review is an a or something of the

02:32:34.520 --> 02:32:38.800
equivalent a question it you should question it because they could very well

02:32:38.800 --> 02:32:41.280
be doing it especially if it's a no-name site trying to get the additional

02:32:41.280 --> 02:32:47.520
traffic they could be doing it just to get the traffic kind of sad

02:32:47.520 --> 02:32:53.400
toa gak in our chair him says code your damn games on time or admit failure damn

02:32:53.400 --> 02:32:59.360
these day one patches I don't think the game is going to be like terrible but

02:32:59.360 --> 02:33:03.840
it's going to be interesting to see if the servers can handle at day one it's

02:33:03.840 --> 02:33:08.800
gonna be a big demand big big demand the internet will come to a screeching halt

02:33:08.800 --> 02:33:17.080
this week chaos all right let's open up the Skype line at 1 877 game olr our

02:33:17.080 --> 02:33:21.920

Skype or I think they actually build it in there in there now it's like make a

02:33:29.920 --> 02:33:34.320
test call and you can easily hear if your sound settings are okay because

02:33:34.320 --> 02:33:39.640
when we pick up and no one's there it's a little bit frustrating all right while

what you said about the guy that was online for 72 hours for Starcraft 2 he's

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:26.960
standing in line yes I think that you know that I was on the line for the week

02:34:31.080 --> 02:34:35.480

long okay I get it but you're also black Luigi you have to be out there I mean

02:35:06.360 --> 02:35:11.440
like it's not a Nintendo party without black Luigi I suppose so but I just say

02:35:11.440 --> 02:35:15.840
you can't go out for something like that cuz we've all done this I mean you guys

02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:18.920
got it didn't get on the line for the week she was out there interviewing

02:35:18.920 --> 02:35:23.160
people handing out stuff you know because it was total promotion for our

02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:26.600
show cuz you know we can't afford million dollar ads no I mean we got into

02:35:26.600 --> 02:35:32.400
it extra for waited in the line he was but I waited in line whether we keep in

02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:37.240
mind to this is important if we hadn't waited in line we wouldn't have got one

02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:41.840
there's gonna be plenty of Starcraft 2 available day one it's not gonna sell

02:35:41.840 --> 02:35:46.800
out like crazy you're gonna be able to find it but you know if software is a

02:35:46.800 --> 02:35:50.600
lot easier to make than hardware right

02:35:50.600 --> 02:35:58.280
true true but still I'm just saying you shouldn't get a hard time I'm not giving

02:35:58.280 --> 02:36:01.800
him that hard a time I'm just kind of I just putting that in the same category

02:36:01.800 --> 02:36:12.040
is waiting for Twilight that's that's okay that's I guess tomato all right

02:36:12.040 --> 02:36:16.840
well what else is on your mind before we let you go Rama

02:36:16.840 --> 02:36:21.280
earlier in the show about that but the law that California is trying to pass

02:36:21.280 --> 02:36:25.840
many of the states are jumping on the bandwagon mm-hmm passes is not gonna do

02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:31.760
a lick of damage I've seen plenty of time at best by people that aren't 17

02:36:31.760 --> 02:36:37.240
buying emory games it pops up on the registered check ID they use it to keep

02:36:37.240 --> 02:36:42.440
entered bypass to keep going yeah but now it's gonna be illegal and those

02:36:42.440 --> 02:36:46.200
people could be personally responsible if they do that so that behavior might

02:36:46.200 --> 02:36:53.680
change pretty soon it depends on me I don't think it's going to change unless

02:36:53.680 --> 02:36:58.360

02:38:06.880 --> 02:38:13.000
while I'm doing pretty good I was thinking that to run the being in the

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:20.360
show where you where you're basically like we've had a shit ton of guests lately yes we haven't but I

02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:26.120
thought I'd like to confirm one that's gonna be on the show on August 8th who

02:38:26.120 --> 02:38:31.600
would that be that would be me oh you're coming back huh

02:38:31.600 --> 02:38:37.600
yep I decided to suck it up and fly oh god it's gonna be a bunch of women here

02:38:37.600 --> 02:38:42.560
let's I really hope I really hope I really hope that's not the weekend that

02:38:42.560 --> 02:38:46.960
Nellie has the baby because then Loki won't be here and I'll be surrounded by

02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:52.680
women no I'm just I'm I'm messing around it'll be okay well that's great are you

02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:56.360
now I get asked this question because um I don't know if we talked about it last

02:38:56.360 --> 02:39:00.080
time you were here but you do not like to fly and last time you came out here

02:39:00.080 --> 02:39:05.480
you took Greyhound out here and a little bit of the train too I think what are

02:39:05.480 --> 02:39:11.520
you doing this time are you are I thought there was a train involved

02:39:11.520 --> 02:39:16.040
somehow so what are you doing this time are you doing the but you know pushing

02:39:16.040 --> 02:39:27.800
the numbers won't do anything right I won't suddenly speak in Spanish for

02:39:27.800 --> 02:39:35.680
English press one para espanol maki numero dos all right no uh so so what

02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:40.480
are you doing this time are you doing the the Greyhound thing again what I'm

02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:45.520
going to get out there is I'm flying Southwest from St. Louis to LA taking

02:39:45.520 --> 02:39:50.640
Amtrak overnight from LA to Sacramento and then then on the way back home I'm

02:39:50.640 --> 02:39:55.160
taking the bus well Southwest is basically a Greyhound bus with wings so

02:39:55.160 --> 02:40:02.080
I enjoy that it'll be fine now have you ever flown before like ever no I'll give

02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:06.180
you a tip I want to be on the damn show if you're if you're anxious about it

02:40:06.180 --> 02:40:10.760
Misty and it makes you nervous just take like half a Tylenol PM right before you

02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:14.000
get on the flight and then you'll fall right asleep and it'll it'll help the

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:17.580
anxiety not that I advocate like taking meds and drugs and stuff but you know

02:40:17.580 --> 02:40:22.360
and again if I don't know like if you I'm not your doctor so you might want to

02:40:22.360 --> 02:40:25.760
ask somebody because I don't know what other medications you take and I hate to

02:40:25.760 --> 02:40:29.360
you know have you mix I don't know what else you take and Tylenol may not mix

02:40:29.360 --> 02:40:34.440
but just take a sleep aid that's approved by your doctor and you know

02:40:34.440 --> 02:40:39.320
that that might help with the pain or the not the pain but the anxiety because

02:40:39.320 --> 02:40:42.080
I've had friends that have to do that they get really anxious especially if

02:40:42.080 --> 02:40:46.560
there's gonna be turbulence or anything which flying to LA you I think you get

02:40:46.560 --> 02:40:49.200
to dodge the Rockies a little bit I don't think you'll fly right over them

02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:52.760
and that's where the worst turbulence is but it'll be fine I fly all the time

02:40:52.760 --> 02:40:57.120
it's fine in fact you know what you probably saw on the news not that far

02:40:57.120 --> 02:41:01.040
here from Sacramento there's a horrible Greyhound bus accident and I would have

02:41:01.040 --> 02:41:05.840
been extremely sad if Misty had been on that bus so I think you'll be alright

02:41:05.840 --> 02:41:10.400
with flying. I didn't read that yet but keep in mind my computer's back I'm limited to

02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:17.440
doing shit on my iPod right now hmm well you're gonna be you're gonna be just

02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:22.600
fine with that flight. I do not drink and you know that all right all right I'll let you go so

02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:27.160
you can go beat up some chatters with your fist so we'll see and you can yell

02:41:27.160 --> 02:41:31.520
at them in person when you're here in a couple weeks so we'll see you then all

02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:38.040
right take care. Misty's gonna be on the show. I had to make sure that I was

02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:40.560
actually gonna be here cuz I was worried for me that she was only here for the

02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:44.560
weekend what's that say um she's gonna be on the 8th I think that's the night

02:41:44.560 --> 02:41:48.360
after showgirls it is the night after showgirls so I'll be but I'll be back in

02:41:48.360 --> 02:41:50.780
town on the 8th because I usually come so I'll be here she's here during the

02:41:50.780 --> 02:41:54.200
week I guess so we'll have to all get Indian food or something I don't know

02:41:54.200 --> 02:41:57.440
cuz she foods what are we gonna do with Misty what do you do a Misty for like

02:41:57.440 --> 02:42:04.560
four days I was thinking going to Dave and Buster's and going to our big old

02:42:04.560 --> 02:42:10.240
land maybe and let's go order a dumpster the little ghetto arcade over there

02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:14.040
with Para Para is it'd be fun cuz she really wants to play Para Para be fun

02:42:14.040 --> 02:42:18.600
let's go to another call hi you're on orange lounge radio for English press

02:42:18.600 --> 02:42:25.600
one para espanol no I'm kidding hi who's this hey this is excellent hi x-link

02:42:25.600 --> 02:42:28.920
what's on your mind hey actually I want to call back everything's first off

02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:32.600
about the law I'm I lived here in Florida which is probably supposedly be

02:42:32.600 --> 02:42:36.040
one of the states which I really don't think it's gonna pass personally like

02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:39.000
Rama said I really think that it's gonna go through a lot of loopholes before

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:43.920
anything gets passed look through a lot of these different states a lot of the

02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:49.480
companies too I noticing now are trying to do things so they won't get in

02:42:49.480 --> 02:42:54.440
trouble it god forbid it's something like this would pass recently I bought

02:42:54.440 --> 02:42:58.760
something I bought a computer game from Target the file collection and I was

02:42:58.760 --> 02:43:04.760
surprised that I got ID for it which took me by surprise because the first

02:43:04.760 --> 02:43:07.760
time ever buying a game from say like Target or someplace like that where I

02:43:07.760 --> 02:43:13.240
actually got carded for the game for being mature so it was very shocking to

02:43:13.240 --> 02:43:16.040
say the least but it was very cool though because at least it shows that

02:43:16.040 --> 02:43:19.160
they're trying to take the appropriate steps to make sure something does

02:43:19.160 --> 02:43:23.680
happen but you but I agree with you there is a bad point they're making all

02:43:23.680 --> 02:43:27.580
these steps to block these mature rate games but a lot of times with these are

02:43:27.580 --> 02:43:31.360
a movies they're not doing anything it's like oh they're worth their parents so

02:43:31.360 --> 02:43:35.800
it has to be okay so you know but it's like almost like a double standard in a

02:43:35.800 --> 02:43:39.280
way I'll look at it excellent how do you have time to play Fallout you play just

02:43:39.280 --> 02:43:42.440
as much Wow as I do and I don't have time for other video games like how do

02:43:42.440 --> 02:43:47.240
you do it now I got it mostly for the collection now because I have three

02:43:47.240 --> 02:43:50.900
already so I said well if I got three I might look at one and two and tactics to

02:43:50.900 --> 02:43:53.640
put in with it because I had one or two before a long time ago before

02:43:53.640 --> 02:43:59.480
unfortunately my mom's place which had all my games and was arson so I lost a

02:43:59.480 --> 02:44:06.120
lot of games that I had that's terrible oh man well sorry to hear it but now

02:44:06.120 --> 02:44:09.680
glad you're it's like building the second frontier I like I can't believe

02:44:09.680 --> 02:44:14.240
you're sitting there bashing it it was actually it wasn't great it wasn't the

02:44:14.240 --> 02:44:18.360
best but it would the storyline was alright and besides you can play some

02:44:18.360 --> 02:44:22.000
like going around game I love how you're lowering the bar as you're reviewing it

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:27.440
well wasn't that good when that you know it's you know it's there's always one at

02:44:27.440 --> 02:44:33.720
every party huh you know it's all good I won't judge you for it

02:44:33.720 --> 02:44:39.680
all right that it you got something else all right that's pretty much about it

02:44:39.680 --> 02:44:43.680

lounge reader calm there's Twitter's there's lots of ways to get through to

02:45:08.400 --> 02:45:11.880
the show so that's it we're gonna wrap up no last-minute stories right now I'm

02:45:11.880 --> 02:45:15.960
just kidding what is a look you got for last minute stories dead rising to case

02:45:15.960 --> 02:45:21.000
zero be coming out on Xbox live arcade August 31st of course it'll be kind of a

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:27.240
prequel or in-between sequel for the dead rising series it takes place

02:45:27.240 --> 02:45:35.360
between dead rising a one and two and also you'll be able to kind of level up

02:45:35.360 --> 02:45:41.680
your character and stuff that you earn in that game will also transfer over to

02:45:41.680 --> 02:45:46.320
dead rising to the best thing about it though it will only cost you five

02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:53.720
dollars so that is awesome for what may be considered I've seen anything on

02:45:53.720 --> 02:46:01.240
arcade for five dollars a long time exactly see Netflix is apparently going

02:46:01.240 --> 02:46:06.280
diskless by October so they're gonna eventually have an app or you may say

02:46:06.280 --> 02:46:12.280

us tonight here in studio hope you had a fun time I did show as always how it now

02:47:58.520 --> 02:48:01.200
it's because you sometimes you listen and you comment in chat and sometimes

02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:07.920
you hear how is the show different between the two I don't know behind the

02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:12.600
scenes is just a different perspective I guess I'm a lot less nervous this time

02:48:12.600 --> 02:48:17.480
than I was the first two times it's my third time on the show you do well the

02:48:17.480 --> 02:48:20.680
thing is he's really funny you guys like he makes a lot of really funny chat

02:48:20.680 --> 02:48:23.800
comments that's why I read him like I'm not doing like he gets more chat

02:48:23.800 --> 02:48:27.280
comments and because like you know he's my boyfriend or whatever but he actually

02:48:27.280 --> 02:48:30.800
says a lot of funny stuff and you know so we like getting more of that funny

02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:34.960

02:48:58.620 --> 02:49:04.280
