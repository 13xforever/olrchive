3D YouTube is set for the PlayStation 3

Details come out on Mega Man Universe

Orange Lounge Radio

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We are that video game show dedicated to

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Video games, gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You name it, you talk about it

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Live in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My name is Rob Roberts

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hi!

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
How are you doing, Jamie?

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hi

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You're high?

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
No, actually, um

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Starting the Prop 19 celebration a little early?

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
No, no, no

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I've got Vicodin in me

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I see

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Because I've got a slice in my hand

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes, you had your surgery

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
As we've been talking about for a couple weeks on the show

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Because it was scheduled last week

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But it happened for real Tuesday, right?

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It did, and it was really boring

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But you're here, so obviously you're doing alright

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah, it hurts

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry, well Vicodin's supposed to help that

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
No, Vicodin's supposed to make you not care

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Supposed to?

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Supposed to

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh, it's going to be a fun show, folks

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Well, I was fun yesterday, though

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I was really entertaining, I feel

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm going to get into yesterday in just a minute

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But it would not be a show if I didn't introduce the one and only

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Techmaster, Loke

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It would be a show, I just wouldn't be introduced

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
How are you doing, Loke?

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm doing fine

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Excellent

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
How's the baby room painting going?

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Because I've seen pictures show up

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And for the listeners who might be new to OLR

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Who are just tuning in for the first time

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Loke's wife is expecting really soon, right?

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I think in the next couple weeks

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
August 19th, but she's 35 weeks and 3 days now

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Wow

58
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So, you know

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
She looks like she's ready to pop

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
She's basically ready to pop

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's right

62
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What I'm surprised, to be honest, is our friends

63
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Annie and Jim

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I mean, you know, Annie

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
She's 39 and I don't even

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
She'll be 40 weeks next Wednesday

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Or this coming Wednesday

68
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Wow

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So she's ready to go

70
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That baby's well done

71
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That baby is done

72
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Well, it's her first, right?

73
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes, possibly going to be extra crispy, but

74
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Well, Becky was 10 days overdue with Julian

75
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But yeah, so any day

76
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Basically, they get to the point, though

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The doctor will only let you go up to 42 weeks

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And then they just say, okay, no, you're having the baby

79
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We're inducing you and you're going

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So, no, but Nellie

81
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
She's hoping to have the baby by the end of the month

82
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Preferably at 37 weeks

83
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Which would be a week from this coming Thursday

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And we don't know what's going to happen to OLR

85
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
While you're gone

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Knowing you, you'll be here

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Even if she delivers Sunday morning

88
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I will probably be gone at least a week or two

89
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But it is so funny

90
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Because, like, there's seriously

91
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
People like vultures clamoring for your spot

92
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
While you're gone

93
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Even that one week

94
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Drew's been showing up more and more lately

95
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We got an email tonight

96
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That Jamie's going to read later

97
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That has another suggestion

98
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So it's really funny

99
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's too bad he's not here this week

100
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It really only takes three weeks

101
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But unfortunately

102
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
He was shy one week

103
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So that ain't going to work

104
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Well, we'll figure it out

105
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But the point I was actually trying to make

106
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
For those that didn't know

107
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You are doing your baby room in a

108
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What? New Super Mario Brothers theme, right?

109
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yes, New Super Mario Brothers theme

110
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So we've got

111
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We've been painting a lot

112
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And actually I'm trying to get them uploaded

113
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
On the photo gallery thing

114
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But it's being a little on the slow side

115
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
There's some pictures right now on there

116
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That are really

117
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's a lot of work ago

118
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I mean, there's a lot of stuff we've done

119
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Since the stuff I posted

120
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And I'd say it's about now

121
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Maybe

122
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't know, 60

123
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
60, 75% done

124
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And this is all the base stuff

125
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We still have to go back and actually shade it

126
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So that it looks more 3D looking I guess

127
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But I will probably be posting

128
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Pictures in the chat room

129
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I have uploaded them to Flickr

130
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So I'll be posting a link to that

131
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
In the meantime while we're waiting for them to upload on the website

132
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yeah, I know there were some changes on our website this week

133
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And I'm going to get into

134
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's mostly transparent

135
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Except for this apparently

136
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The picture thing is slowing down

137
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Most of the changes that happened to the website this week

138
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Are transparent

139
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But I'll talk about those in a little bit

140
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
When we get to housekeeping

141
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I actually have a lot of housekeeping tonight

142
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But first I need to give a plug to

143
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
All Games

144
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Because we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio

145
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
www.allgames.com

146
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
6 o'clock Pacific

147
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
9 o'clock Eastern

148
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Thereabouts right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

149
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We were a little late tonight

150
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And that was my bad

151
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Because I got caught in traffic

152
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Coming back from San Francisco

153
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Which actually is going to tie into

154
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Where we're going to start tonight

155
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
We usually do start off the show talking about our gaming weeks

156
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But Dark Soccer and I kind of had a unique event yesterday in our gaming week

157
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We did

158
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And I know Jamie wants to talk all about this

159
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I do

160
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So Dark Soccer

161
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
California Xtreme

162
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Tell the listeners who don't know

163
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Because I find not a lot of people outside of California

164
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Or NorCal even

165
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Seem to know what this is

166
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So tell our listeners what this is all about

167
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Where it's at

168
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Why we go

169
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It was Xtreme

170
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
California Xtreme is a classic arcade and pinball type of expo thing

171
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And they have speakers, do panels, typical convention stuff

172
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But all the games are out there on free play

173
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And they've got pins dating back from the 50's and up

174
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
They even had the Iron Man pinball there

175
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Which by the way was not very exciting

176
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Stern sorry you sucked at this one

177
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I was way more interested in the Dark Knight table they had a picture of

178
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But didn't actually have there

179
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah that's supposed to be pretty hardcore

180
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Dude they had Big Bang Bar though

181
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm glad the people that bring

182
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And it was the real Big Bang Bar not the

183
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Because they got the rights to redo Big Bang Bar

184
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay I gotta rewind because you know how disjointed I'm gonna be tonight

185
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Big Bang Bar was a table they were only like 16 prototypes of

186
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That Capcom's pinball division did before they decided to not do that anymore

187
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And they eventually did the rights did get out

188
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And someone was doing reproductions of them

189
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But this was one of the 16 prototypes

190
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So it was pretty cool

191
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Anyway they had like

192
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
They had the Star Wars pachinko machine

193
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
They had old pong

194
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
They had a game called Touch Me

195
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It was very 70's

196
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Cocktail tables, sit downs

197
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
A really nice Star Wars arcade

198
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It was kind of like going into Microsoft's game room but for real

199
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And journey

200
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Like if it was a real place

201
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
They just take this ballroom and just lots of arcade

202
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And more pinball than I was expecting

203
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I didn't realize how much of it was dominated by pinball

204
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
They had ultra pin there too

205
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The ultra-cade pinball

206
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That was a cool machine I played pinbot on that it was cool

207
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I've played one of those before like I played Black Knight for a while on there

208
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But it's not the same for me

209
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I've wanted to make one of those but it really

210
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's cost prohibitive

211
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's really expensive I have an extra TV that I could use for that

212
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But it's just I don't play that much pinball

213
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And considering how much I play my arcade machine

214
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I don't need to build one of these

215
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Let me go to our chat room at chat.orangelaungerator.com

216
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Because we do get live chat comments as we tape the show

217
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And I'm going to start with Salacious Pop tonight

218
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He was there with us yesterday

219
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Salacious Pop in our chat says

220
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Hi

221
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I played a few rounds of Lethal Weapon 3 pinball

222
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But try as I might I could not unlock the hidden racist misogynist screen

223
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yes I was hoping they would update the pinball machine

224
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So that like when the ball goes down the gutter it would yell at you

225
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I deserve to be blown

226
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But unfortunately no not going to happen

227
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Anyhow sorry classic games good times

228
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Free play

229
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You pay one fee to get in it was 40 bucks to get in

230
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I got in for nothing

231
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I got in as press for Geek Life

232
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yours special

233
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Which by the way there's going to be a big write up on this

234
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Showing up tomorrow morning on both Orange Lounge Radio and on Geek Life

235
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Look at it

236
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I had a geeky time while I was there

237
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Looking at all the classes like I was playing a real gyrus machine

238
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And a real time pilot machine

239
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You can't emulate that so well on the 360

240
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The tempest kept having problems with the vector

241
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The vector display

242
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Crystal castles with a real trackball the way it was meant to be played

243
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The lifeguard trackball forward on the 5200

244
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And I played for the first

245
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I know this is going to surprise people

246
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't believe I had ever played the Empire Strikes Back game

247
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Isn't it great

248
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Star Wars

249
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yes and the Star Wars vector game

250
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Man that game was epic

251
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Oh man I love that game

252
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The one that they had there the sit down one

253
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Had like this really nice bright monitor

254
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And the speakers were just so clear

255
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It was fantastic it didn't sound muddy or anything at all

256
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I thought I got a bad headache playing it and it hurt my hand a lot

257
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Because yeah I didn't really play a whole bunch of stuff while I was there

258
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Because um

259
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And we'll probably go into the surgery thing later

260
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I've got 8 stitches in my right hand

261
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Good times

262
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And while I'm healing really nicely

263
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
They hurt a lot

264
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Because unlike my last surgery when I moved my hand

265
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I've got more range of motion now

266
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But it pulls the stitches

267
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Ew

268
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And yeah well it'll bleed a little bit

269
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's really

270
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But you were able to play some stuff

271
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I played since I played Baby Pac Man

272
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I had to play Baby Pac Man

273
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Me too

274
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And that game for being notoriously hard

275
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I always remembered being kind of good at it

276
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I got to the third stage which is not bad for Baby Pac Man

277
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
They had a Junior Pac Man

278
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Which is like one of the really epic Pac Mans of its day

279
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Of course I played Big Bang Bar

280
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And Iron Man Pinball

281
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I didn't play Journey

282
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I played Star Wars

283
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I played Journey it was awesome

284
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I played Timber twice

285
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Because I love those old school

286
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I played Mouse Trap

287
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And then Mouse Trap though was the big mistake

288
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Because Mouse Trap has a right hand joystick

289
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And I was like

290
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And I forgot about the stupid bird

291
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Because keep in mind when I was playing a lot of Mouse Trap

292
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I was playing it on the ColecoVision

293
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And there's no bird in the ColecoVision

294
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You know what else was there that was very random

295
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That was cool was a 80s or I guess maybe mid 90s laser disc jukebox

296
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So the whole time people are there playing games

297
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
There's these old school songs playing

298
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Everything from like you know

299
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Contemporary-ish songs by like Garbage of You Two

300
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
To like pour some sugar on me

301
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
On the little four cube TV

302
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah it's there every year

303
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
One of those TVs that's made up of little TVs

304
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It was awesome

305
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yeah totally 80s style

306
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But there's more Rob

307
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
There's more

308
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What?

309
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Coin Toss was there

310
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I love the Coin Toss game

311
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's like one of the old 50s games

312
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It was so fantastic

313
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Like one of the pre-course precursors to our pong

314
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But anyway

315
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
There was the Boxcar game

316
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The Sega Boxcar game

317
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh yeah the Minecar

318
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Like you actually push up and down on the big lever

319
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Like an old Minecar

320
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And Top Skater

321
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And DDR something or the other

322
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Extreme

323
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I took some video of Mel and Ali playing

324
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I actually got up there and played DDR

325
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm not allowed to

326
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Man am I out of shape

327
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm not allowed to play DDR until my stitches come out

328
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
No

329
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I can't get my heart rate

330
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I miss much

331
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm not supposed to get my heart rate up y'all

332
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So I can't get very excited tonight

333
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Um

334
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Looking at our chatroom at chat.orangesonsradio.com

335
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Sure

336
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I always say this name wrong

337
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Surezo in our chatroom says

338
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Sounds like a nice spot

339
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Damn I need to plan to get out to California Extreme

340
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Now I think he's kind of local here

341
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I think he's our guy

342
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It was in Santa Clara

343
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That golfs or does the Roseville Golf Line and everything

344
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But I

345
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Would this be something worth traveling to

346
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Like a long distance

347
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Totally

348
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Totally

349
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yeah we were people there from out of country

350
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I think they could

351
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I mean here's the weird thing

352
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's an arcade trade show

353
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So I get that they don't want to like expand on

354
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Probably that core part of it

355
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But you know what would have made that expo even more awesome

356
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Would have been like a classic gaming room

357
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
With like console stuff

358
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That reminds me

359
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And I know that might be outside the scope of what they're trying to do but

360
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Classic Gaming Expo is coming back

361
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Oh yeah

362
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
In Las Vegas

363
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
We need to make plans

364
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
This was different from Classic Gaming Expo though

365
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I can't really explain

366
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Classic Gaming Expo was its own kind of thing

367
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah

368
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Classic Gaming Expo was more like booths and things set up to remember

369
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But this was just straight up a room full of free play games

370
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I love the story though about

371
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Because Dan's little brother Mason came with us

372
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And there was

373
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
They were at this panel and Mason's like who's that

374
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What did that guy do, make Atari?

375
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And Dan's like why yes he actually did

376
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And it was the

377
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Nice

378
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
But I got to meet Steve Ritchie

379
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Who designed at least a couple of the tables that we have in this house

380
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
No Fear

381
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He did the voices for No Fear

382
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So when I was

383
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
When I gave him some of our plastics to sign

384
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And he started doing the voices from No Fear

385
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And I was just

386
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So cool and I talked to his wife

387
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
She was a really sweet lady

388
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And told her about a pinball table that I'm designing

389
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Because I'm actually designing the art and everything

390
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And the layout for a pinball table

391
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I just need someone who can program it

392
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Vidpower in our chat room says

393
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
California Extreme was in the Donkey Kong documentary King of Kong

394
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I don't remember that

395
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Was that the place they go

396
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I thought that was a place on the East Coast

397
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But they go, it's like an expositions going on

398
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And Billy, not Billy, the other guy

399
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Steve tries to top the score at this expo

400
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But he just barely misses it

401
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
He doesn't do it

402
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Well no he did this at conventions since I thought

403
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yeah I don't know

404
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
But anyway

405
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
No Steve Wiebe's been I think at these conventions

406
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And all those types of guys you see in that documentary

407
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Are here at this type of event

408
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Good times

409
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Anyway though

410
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And then there were vendors for pinball parts

411
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And you know

412
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
A stern marketer was there

413
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The guy who brought the Iron Man table

414
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And the guy that plays the 12 string guitar thing

415
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Was there

416
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Because he's there every year

417
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And he's always really cool

418
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I just had this

419
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I googled myself and I walked

420
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I was walking sort of

421
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Catty corner around

422
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And all of a sudden in the distance I hear

423
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Bong, bong, bong, bong

424
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
The Space Invaders thing

425
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And then there's also one of our listeners there

426
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Really cool guy, Carlson

427
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Really cool guy

428
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And I purchased a game for my husband

429
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Got Gunstar Heroes for the Game Gear

430
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I was kind of surprised

431
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Treasure

432
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I was surprised to see him there

433
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Because the last time I had seen him

434
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Was out in Washington D.C.

435
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And he's based in the East Coast

436
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He's mostly the cons out there

437
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But I guess he has a relative that lives out here

438
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So he was at this con

439
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Very random moment

440
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Because I was actually looking at the shirts

441
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
At his booth

442
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And he has this really funny

443
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And I guess this is his own original design

444
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It says like Shaq Fu

445
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I loved that

446
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And I almost

447
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I was thinking about buying it

448
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
But then I got distracted

449
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Because he's like

450
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Hey Rob

451
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And I was like

452
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Oh wow

453
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I remember you from like four years ago

454
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So this is kind of funny

455
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Like running into people

456
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
He recognized me

457
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And I didn't know who he was

458
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Or anything

459
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Well it was funny

460
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I was looking for you

461
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
To go introduce you to him

462
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
When you just found him on your own

463
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I had Melody and I did

464
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Oh good times

465
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I had a quick bundle

466
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You just cut out suddenly

467
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Did your switch go down?

468
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Uh no

469
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't have a switch

470
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Oh weird

471
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I don't know what happened

472
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Well meh

473
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Tonight is going to be a night of technical fun

474
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The soundboard's on Vicodin

475
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Alright well before we get to

476
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The rest of our gaming weeks

477
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Outside of

478
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Oh boy

479
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Outside of just this convention

480
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Is there anything else you want to say about California Extreme?

481
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Maybe the thing you most want to see them do next year?

482
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Do it exactly like they did it

483
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And make it cheaper

484
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And bigger

485
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And bigger

486
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh yeah

487
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Bring back the Kung Fu game

488
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
What game was it there at Kung Fu Master?

489
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It wasn't there

490
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And and and

491
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Damn it

492
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Somebody bring a theater of magic

493
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Because Melody and I were annoyed

494
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Alright

495
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Well uh DarkSakura

496
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I know you had the surgery

497
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I don't know if you've been playing a lot of video games

498
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But outside the expo

499
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Did you play any video games this week?

500
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
How was your gaming week?

501
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm playing Sims right now

502
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Um

503
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I was playing some Sims

504
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Um

505
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I tried to play Star Trek Online

506
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
But it hurt too much

507
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
So I just went on to let my fleetmates know

508
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That I wasn't dead of gangrene of the hand

509
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Um

510
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Um

511
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Damn beat Crackdown finally

512
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It was anticlimactic

513
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
First one or the new one?

514
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Second one

515
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Oh wow

516
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It was anticlimactic

517
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Um

518
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And I also really hate the guy in that game

519
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
He's like

520
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Are you trying to piss me off?

521
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Go back to the tactical location

522
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I just wanted to tell him

523
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Shut up and bite my butt

524
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You sound like you've got

525
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
A wedgie

526
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Um

527
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And um

528
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I know I played something else

529
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I don't remember

530
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You're too high to remember

531
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
No, no

532
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Um

533
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Are you playing the Sims right now?

534
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I said I was playing the Sims

535
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Oh um

536
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I played a little bit of Portal

537
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
A little bit of Portal

538
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Just a little bit?

539
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Just a little bit

540
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's just like

541
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Just enough to get taunted by GLaDOS?

542
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yeah

543
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It was just like

544
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm getting so bored

545
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Not being able to do much of anything

546
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That I'll sit and start to play something

547
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Like with the Sims at least

548
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You know I can do a little bit

549
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And rest my hand

550
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
But if I get in the middle of a battle

551
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
On Star Trek Online

552
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm there until it's done

553
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Cause you can't actually pause it

554
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Unless you're on a

555
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Away mission

556
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yeah, MMOs don't usually have a pause button

557
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Yeah

558
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And the only ones of those you can pause

559
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Are the ones you're on there by yourself

560
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So

561
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Alright

562
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yeah, and it's only 45 seconds, meh

563
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Uh, let's try Loki

564
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
How was your gaming week, Loki?

565
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I didn't play a whole lot cause I was paying

566
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So really the only stuff I played was at work

567
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Gloria Paint!

568
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Literally!

569
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
That's true

570
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
That is true

571
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Um

572
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
No, the only things that I played this week

573
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Was, um, actually Grand Theft Auto

574
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
But, um, kind of funny

575
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
We didn't really play much of the

576
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Battle of the Gay Tony this week

577
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Apparently my co-workers are tired of me

578
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Kicking the crap out of them at

579
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The Battle of the Gay Tony

580
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So they went back to Lost in Dam

581
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So I had to keep the crap out of them

582
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
In Lost in Dam

583
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Um, but it's fun

584
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's a nice little break

585
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I just

586
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I always forgot how slow the characters run

587
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And oh my god they run so damn slow

588
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
In that game

589
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's ridiculous

590
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And

591
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I don't know if they've

592
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You know, remembered it being

593
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's not quite as exciting as I remembered it

594
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Just because when we played it last

595
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It was

596
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
With all sorts of crazy explosions going off

597
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
On our mod games

598
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Which will hopefully come back soon

599
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Once I'm done painting the baby's room

600
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Um

601
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
But yeah, we've been playing lots of that

602
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And that's pretty fun

603
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And then

604
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Uh, Crackdown 2

605
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Played a little bit of that

606
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The only thing I don't like about Crackdown 2

607
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Well

608
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
There's many things I don't like about Crackdown 2

609
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
One of the new things I don't like about Crackdown 2

610
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Was

611
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Um

612
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Our internet at my work is not the greatest

613
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Because we're sharing it with like

614
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
80 computers

615
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I mean it's ridiculous

616
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
But

617
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Usually it's enough to play

618
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Online games

619
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Not a problem

620
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Um

621
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Every now and then we have connection issues

622
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
With trying to get into like say a

623
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Free mode game or something like that

624
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And Grand Theft Auto

625
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But

626
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You know, minor stuff that we can usually get around

627
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Crackdown 2 will not allow me to play a game

628
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
With anybody else

629
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
At my work

630
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Like if my co-workers say I want to play a game with him

631
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's impossible

632
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I can join another person's game

633
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Away from our work

634
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
But it will not allow me to connect to a person that's

635
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Literally next to me

636
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Is that maybe because the game is seeing you guys

637
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Like in the same room

638
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
No

639
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's not

640
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
The reason is

641
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's saying that our um

642
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Connection is too strict or

643
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's basically layman's terms for

644
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Um

645
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Our internet connection is too slow

646
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I do just want to point out though

647
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Loki you do know most people

648
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Don't get to play Xbox at their jobs

649
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Right

650
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Just throwing that out there

651
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I understand that but you know

652
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm just saying during our break

653
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
We wanted to play some co-op Crackdown 2

654
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Which would have been really fun

655
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
But uh

656
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
We can't do that and say we have to play

657
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Lost and Damned

658
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Um

659
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
But I just wish that they

660
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
First off I wish they just had System Link

661
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Back from the first game

662
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
That would solve all the problems right there

663
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Well most of the problems

664
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Cause

665
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Even Red Dead Redemption

666
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And

667
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It was

668
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You know it was a good testament to how

669
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Take Two

670
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And Rockstar Games

671
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Still find ways to fuck up multiplayer

672
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Um

673
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Even in Red Dead Redemption

674
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It sometimes can't find

675
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
The other people

676
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Like we'll be

677
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And that was funny

678
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
We're playing Free Mode in Red Dead Redemption

679
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And we go to try to play like a little

680
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Deathmatch in there cause in

681
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
In the online for Red Dead

682
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You have to basically go these different points

683
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
On the map and then it'll send an invite

684
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
To the other players that are playing

685
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You know the System Link game with you

686
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Um

687
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
That you want to do a

688
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Deathmatch

689
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
So we all

690
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You know say okay yes

691
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Let's enter this Deathmatch

692
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And then it puts us in the three separate

693
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Deathmatches

694
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
With just us

695
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Our one single

696
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You know each person is in their own

697
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Deathmatch

698
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
How the fuck does that happen

699
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I have never seen

700
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
A System Link game

701
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Not figure out how to connect to another

702
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
System Link

703
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Console

704
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It doesn't make any sense

705
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Only Rockstar could do that

706
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
But yeah

707
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So um

708
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
That's about all I played this week

709
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Hopefully gonna play more once we get the

710
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Babies room done cause

711
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You know we're under a deadline here

712
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And uh

713
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
You know I have lots

714
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I have

715
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You know

716
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
A little bit of work left to do

717
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
But um

718
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's looking good

719
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Alright well good luck

720
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
With the rest of that

721
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And uh

722
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Our well wishes to the

723
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Misses as well

724
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And uh

725
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Through all that

726
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
My gaming week

727
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Outside of California Extreme

728
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I've been playing

729
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Um

730
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Mostly the same stuff

731
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I didn't get into a lot of new stuff

732
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I would say the newest thing I played

733
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Was some of the extensions

734
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That they have in game room now

735
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You know some of the recent games

736
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That they released

737
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But of course that's just really

738
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Old stuff

739
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
With new paint on it

740
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Uh

741
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And

742
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I can't tell you how

743
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Horrifically

744
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Games like

745
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Kaboom

746
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And Crystal Castles

747
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And things that ran on the Xbox

748
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Or I mean things that ran on like

749
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Trackballs and

750
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And uh

751
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Paddles

752
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
How horrifically they translate

753
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Into the Xbox 360 controls

754
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But there are some other cool

755
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Stuff on there

756
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
That I was playing

757
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Um

758
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Like Hero

759
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
H-E-R-O

760
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Was still one of my favorite games

761
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Uh

762
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
They did some changes to game room

763
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
This week too

764
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Where now you have like a

765
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Live leaderboard

766
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
As you are playing the game

767
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You watch yourself climb up

768
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
This live leaderboard

769
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
On the right hand side of the screen

770
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
That's actually really cool

771
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
So um

772
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I kinda

773
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Was a fan of that

774
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
That's only a ranked match

775
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
By the way

776
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
So you have to actually own the game

777
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
To be able to see that

778
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
But um

779
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Yeah

780
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Uh

781
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Still more Puzzle Quest 2

782
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Still more Warcraft of course

783
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I revisited

784
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Revisited

785
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Uh

786
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
The pinball games

787
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
That are on

788
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Xbox 360

789
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And Playstation 3

790
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Zen Pinball

791
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And Pinball FX

792
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Uh

793
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Because I was trying to uh

794
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Represent OLR

795
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
In the big battle

796
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Cause

797
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
The response from the listenership

798
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So far has been a little bit tepid

799
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
But I'll get into that in a little bit

800
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Um

801
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So I was trying to help represent

802
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
OLR in that

803
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And I tried

804
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I didn't get at the top of leaderboard

805
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
But at least I

806
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I got on it

807
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So I'm happy with that

808
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And

809
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I hadn't really played

810
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Especially the one on the PS3

811
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I don't think I appreciated enough

812
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
But that Earth Defense Force table

813
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
On PS3

814
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Is actually a lot of fun

815
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And uh

816
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I actually kind of enjoyed

817
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Um

818
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Getting to spend a little time with it

819
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
This week

820
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
As much as I was not

821
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
As wonderful at it

822
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'd be more excited about it

823
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
If it was actually

824
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Earth Defense Force 2017

825
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It is not

826
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
But it's

827
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It's still cool

828
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It's a cool little board

829
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
As far as pinball goes

830
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
But uh

831
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah had a good time with that

832
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So that was

833
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
That was really it

834
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
There wasn't um

835
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
A whole lot of other

836
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Stuff

837
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
In my gaming week

838
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And I pretty much

839
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Echo a lot of what

840
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Dark Sakura said

841
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
With uh

842
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
California Extreme

843
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Uh

844
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Played a lot of fun games there

845
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So uh

846
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Since I brought up

847
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
The Big Battle

848
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Let's go into housekeeping here tonight

849
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Before we get into tonight's gaming news

850
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Uh

851
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Big Battle is

852
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Is all games

853
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Um

854
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Kind of competition

855
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
With these various video games

856
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Uh

857
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Throughout all the different shows

858
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
On all games

859
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Well

860
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Most of them

861
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I don't think all of them

862
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Signed up

863
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Of quite a few

864
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Are participating

865
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
In RPG Grinders

866
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Electric Sisterhood

867
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
All these other shows

868
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
On the network

869
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Sorry I didn't name them all

870
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
But they're all there

871
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Uh

872
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
At thebigbattle.net

873
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And um

874
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It's really just for fun

875
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It's not

876
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Although I hear now

877
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
There's a prize

878
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I got an email this week

879
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
That now there is a prize

880
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So get this

881
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
The winning show

882
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And this is not about the hosts

883
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Of the show doing battle

884
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
With each other

885
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Although I'm choosing to participate

886
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
This is about the listenerships

887
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Representing the shows

888
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
In these battles

889
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Well

890
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
The winning show now

891
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
As I understand it

892
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Is going to get

893
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
A gold Atari 2600

894
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
So it's a

895
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Like I think it's just

896
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Spray painted gold

897
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
But it will be an

898
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Atari trophy

899
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So I know Dark Soccer's

900
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Dying to have one of those

901
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
In the vault

902
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Although

903
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I do think

904
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
If we get a gold Atari 2600

905
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
We should maybe

906
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I don't know

907
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Give it to a listener

908
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
That helped us get it

909
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Maybe?

910
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I don't know

911
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Go for it

912
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
We'll have to decide

913
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Rob if I really wanted

914
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
A gold Atari 2600

915
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I would go find one of ours

916
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And get a can of

917
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Rustoleum

918
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And the meaning behind it

919
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
It doesn't mean it the same

920
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
When you do it that way

921
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I know

922
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
But I'm just saying

923
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
We can give it to somebody

924
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It will be just fine

925
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Well I'll tell you right now

926
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
The way the leaderboards look

927
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
We ain't gonna get it

928
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
We are in second place

929
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
But we're gonna win

930
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
A gold 32X

931
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
But we are way behind

932
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Dead Pixel Live

933
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Dead Pixel Live has 164 points

934
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
We have 42

935
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Which has us in second place

936
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Now how many things

937
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Have already completed already?

938
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Uh

939
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I think three

940
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
But there's still more

941
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Going on right now

942
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
But let me

943
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You know

944
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
It got off to a little

945
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Bit of a slow start

946
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
The whole thing started

947
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Right when E3 was going on

948
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And then you know

949
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
My birthday and the 4th

950
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Were all in there

951
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
You know

952
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It took a little while

953
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I think for us to

954
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Kind of really get in there

955
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
But there's more games

956
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Happening

957
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And I think a lot of the

958
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Early feedback we got was

959
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
You know

960
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I don't have Solnarex

961
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And I don't really have

962
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
The pinball game

963
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
So what's there for me to play?

964
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Derek's been very open to

965
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Putting stuff in there

966
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
So I can tell you

967
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And it looks like

968
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
It's scheduled now

969
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I didn't even know

970
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It got a date

971
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
On August 1st

972
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Super Street Fighter 4

973
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Now I know tons of bitches

974
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Have that game

975
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I'll make Dan play

976
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And can represent

977
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Get Dan to sign up

978
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
At TheBigBattle.net

979
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And represent the OLR

980
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Because seriously

981
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
If we lose

982
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Super Street Fighter 4

983
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Or we don't have

984
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Good representation

985
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Super Street Fighter 4

986
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
We're just going to kiss

987
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
That gold Atari thing goodbye

988
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Because it ain't happening

989
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Like this is a game

990
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
That I know we can do

991
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Well at

992
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I'll blame everybody personally

993
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So yes

994
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I will be

995
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Blaming certain individuals

996
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
That are very very good

997
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
At Super Street Fighter

998
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
If you don't participate in this

999
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Unless you have a really good reason

1000
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I will blame you personally

1001
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
But it's yeah

1002
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
TheBigBattle.net

1003
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And it's August 1st

1004
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And sign up and participate

1005
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
But there are other games

1006
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
If you're not a Street Fighter person

1007
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Forza's going on right now

1008
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And I wonder if we have people

1009
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
In Forza

1010
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Like I'll tell you this

1011
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
So far

1012
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
We can really thank

1013
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Arkadian42

1014
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Really made a good showing

1015
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
For us in pinball

1016
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Like he got us 7 points

1017
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
On Zen Pinball

1018
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And he got us

1019
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Another 7 points

1020
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
On Pinball FX

1021
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I got us like 4 on one

1022
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And 3 on the other

1023
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And let's see

1024
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
We actually have Monty Boggs

1025
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Participated

1026
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And got us 3 points

1027
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
On Pinball FX

1028
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
So thank you

1029
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Arkadian42

1030
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Monty Boggs

1031
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And me

1032
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
The rest of you all

1033
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
You need to go find a game

1034
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
You can help us out with

1035
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'm injured

1036
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Alright

1037
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Fine

1038
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You can sit on the bench

1039
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Due to injury

1040
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
But depending on how long

1041
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
This thing goes

1042
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Up B or a win done

1043
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Look at this

1044
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Look at this

1045
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
3 points

1046
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
On Forza Motorsport 3

1047
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Right now

1048
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Way to go

1049
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Brrr

1050
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
You rock

1051
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Keep up the good work

1052
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And there's also

1053
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Super Stardust HD

1054
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Is the other competition

1055
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Going on right now

1056
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And I

1057
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Oh

1058
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
We

1059
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Holy crap

1060
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
We are leading

1061
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
The leaderboard right now

1062
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
In Super Stardust HD

1063
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Who is Zui?

1064
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Who is a Z-O-O-I?

1065
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I don't recognize

1066
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
That name from chat

1067
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I don't know who Zui is

1068
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
But

1069
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
That's from us to you

1070
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Cause you're currently

1071
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Kicking butt

1072
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Brrr

1073
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Brrr

1074
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
That's from us to HD

1075
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Good job

1076
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And Battlefield

1077
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Bad Company 2

1078
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Is also happening

1079
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
So there it

1080
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Big Battle

1081
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
In chat

1082
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
DarkTetsuya

1083
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Says

1084
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I thought

1085
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I heard a rumor

1086
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
There going to

1087
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It an upcoming

1088
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I heard

1089
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
meaning

1090
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
That

1091
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
In the

1092
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
There ya go

1093
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Other housekeeping I wanted to get to tonight.

1094
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I want to talk about the feed.

1095
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Most people shouldn't notice this, but the podcast feed actually moved

1096
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
this past week and I want to take a minute to thank

1097
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Dekeman and Jason, VX JasonXV,

1098
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
who do a lot of work on our website. And I'll tell you, like, Dekeman,

1099
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
he kind of did this whole thing where he moved our podcast

1100
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
and he's doing it so that way when we, usually when I post

1101
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
a show, it takes like 24 hours for it to show up on the website

1102
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
because someone has to go in there manually and do it, but that won't

1103
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
happen anymore. Like, when I post a show, it will be instant.

1104
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
So, most people are going to be able to get their shows faster and that's going to be

1105
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
really good news. So,

1106
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
yeah, I'm hoping nobody notices

1107
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
the differences, but if you do,

1108
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
just sit tight while we are under construction

1109
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
a little bit. But I'm hoping if you're listening to this show

1110
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
and you're on the podcast feed, then clearly your

1111
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
feed player and all that updated and noticed the change

1112
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
just fine. You don't need to do a darn thing. And for those

1113
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
that did not move, Jason was kind enough to

1114
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
record like a little special message that will show up over there

1115
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
for those folks that know they have to resubscribe. So, I'm hoping

1116
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
that is all better and all that good stuff now.

1117
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
So, that's just some maintenance going on on the website. And also,

1118
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
an excuse for me to thank the guys that make it happen, Dekeman

1119
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
and VX JasonXV. Like, Dekeman put together this whole little, like, training manual.

1120
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Like, here's how you post to the website. Step one, dah dah dah.

1121
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It's like the type of thing I do at my day job. And we pay him

1122
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
nothing because we have nothing. So,

1123
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
it's very much appreciated by all of

1124
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
us, as all of you listening should appreciate it too.

1125
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
How about some actual bonafide gaming news now?

1126
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Are we ready? Thirty minutes into the show, we're going to touch on some gaming news.

1127
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Loki, what is going on in the world of PlayStation?

1128
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Absolutely nothing. No, just kidding.

1129
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Actually, in September, there will be some stuff going on,

1130
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
including the 3D Blu-ray support,

1131
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
which will basically turn your PS3 into not only

1132
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
a Blu-ray player, but a 3D Blu-ray player.

1133
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And as of right now, I believe there is only one

1134
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
3D Blu-ray movie out there. So, if you're looking

1135
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
to see Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs in 3D,

1136
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
you can do that now. Assuming, of course, that you have a 3D TV.

1137
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
But why wouldn't you have a 3D TV if you have

1138
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
that movie?

1139
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And then, of course, with that, there's also going to be some...

1140
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Wait, wait, isn't the regular Blu-ray just happen to be

1141
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
regular and 3D? I don't think you buy a special

1142
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
3D Blu-ray. So you could own the movie

1143
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
and just not have a 3D TV because they're kind of pricey right now, right?

1144
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
No, I do believe that it's actually a different movie.

1145
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
It's a 3D Blu-ray. Wow. Wow, I didn't even know that existed.

1146
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
The regular movie, you can watch with the

1147
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
glasses, the magenta,

1148
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
cyan, or the red-blue stuff.

1149
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
But, no, this actually requires

1150
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
a special... You have to buy your movies all over again, yes.

1151
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Just in case you thought, you know, Blu-ray

1152
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
was enough. If you want them in 3D, you gotta buy them again.

1153
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Oh, great. Because it's, you know,

1154
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Mark Smith of that way. Also, there's gonna be

1155
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
some additional support for, apparently,

1156
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Play TV in Europe is gonna

1157
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
be in 3D as well. Different broadcasts through that,

1158
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
as well as YouTube supporting 3D content

1159
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
over the next 12 months as well. So there'll be

1160
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
3D YouTube stuff. Which...

1161
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
begs the question, and this is my

1162
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
thing. Why?

1163
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
That'd be the second question. Why? The first question is,

1164
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I understand, okay, YouTube, okay, great, we've got

1165
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
3D YouTube, but...

1166
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
as far as I'm aware, there's not really 3D film camera. Like,

1167
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I can't go out there and buy a camera that shoots

1168
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
in 3D. Yet. Well, YouTube

1169
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
isn't just underground stuff right now, you know?

1170
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Like, there's a lot of big studios who use YouTube to push

1171
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
their stuff. I understand that, but, you know,

1172
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I'm not gonna be able to see, you know,

1173
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
some viral video or something like that,

1174
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
you know, in 3D normally. And...

1175
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
why? Like you said,

1176
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
why bother? It's because...

1177
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
This 3D thing is happening too fast for me. But you know

1178
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
why that they're pushing it? Why? It's because Sony is

1179
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
selling 3D TVs. And Sony

1180
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
has movies, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,

1181
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
that happen to be in 3D Blu-ray. They figure,

1182
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
hey, look! Look what we did for Blu-ray already!

1183
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
We beat HD DVDs! Now we can convince

1184
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
people to buy 3D Blu-ray! So they're kinda like riding on a high

1185
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
right now, like they own everything? They're basically thinking, you know what,

1186
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
yeah, we may have fucked up UMD,

1187
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
but hey, we won in Blu-ray, and now we're gonna try our

1188
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
hands at 3D Blu-ray. It'll print money!

1189
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
But I have the... Here's my thing though, is people,

1190
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
some people, not even all

1191
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
people nowadays, are willing to make the jump to Blu-ray

1192
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
because the picture quality is pretty good

1193
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
compared to the DVD. But

1194
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
those people probably just bought HDTVs.

1195
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Those same people are not gonna go, oh, well

1196
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I need to throw away my HDTV, I just bought and buy

1197
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
a really expensive 3D HDTV with

1198
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
really expensive 3D glasses to go with that. Because

1199
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I'm a consumer whore. Most people will not

1200
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
do that. And so, yes, it is a bit

1201
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
early. It's why you're not seeing, you know, Microsoft jumping

1202
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
on the bandwagon with this stuff, because it's way too damn early.

1203
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
You don't need to be putting out 3D games because

1204
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
most people don't have the hardware to play them.

1205
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Going to chat.thatorangehonestready.com and some comments there, TigerClaw

1206
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
says, if the studios have their way, they will release the regular

1207
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Blu-ray version, then a couple months later, the 3D version.

1208
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
The 3D version of Avatar won't be out until 2011, and right now

1209
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
they're planning on re-releasing the movie back in IMAX theaters

1210
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
as a special edition with eight minutes of extra footage.

1211
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Because, you know, it is THE 3D movie.

1212
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
But here's the funny part about that. The whole reason they are

1213
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
doing a lot of 3D in theaters now is to get people back into

1214
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
the movie theaters to watch these 3D movies. If you have the

1215
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
technology at home, thank you, you know, Sony and

1216
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
all these guys, you're basically just shooting the

1217
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
theaters all over again, because now what are they going to do? Well,

1218
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I'm not going to the theater to watch an expensive Blu-ray, you know, 3D movie.

1219
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I can watch those 3D movies at home. And how many people remember this

1220
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
particular parallel happening in the video gaming industry?

1221
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
When, basically, you could get a Dreamcast, which

1222
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
basically ran things like a NAOMI system back

1223
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
in the day. It's just a matter of

1224
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
consumer technology bypassing the mass

1225
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
technology. What comes down to is, really,

1226
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Sony doesn't give a crap about movie theaters, because

1227
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
they don't own movie theaters. They sell movies to these

1228
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
movie theaters, and they could care less if their technology

1229
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
is going to impede on their business.

1230
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Can I just say this real quick, because I think Dark

1231
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Soccer makes a good point, is that I think things like the

1232
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
3DO and the CDI come to mind, those

1233
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
things kind of, to me, feel like they were a little ahead of their time.

1234
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And the technology was really cool,

1235
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
but the games were kind of crap and too much money.

1236
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
You know what I mean?

1237
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I think a lot of that stuff was really ahead of

1238
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
its time. I think all this stuff is a little too

1239
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
soon as well. We've got other people in chat saying,

1240
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Katsune in our chat room, yeah, I just got my HDTV,

1241
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I'm not going to get a 3D TV anytime soon. Probably never.

1242
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And Miyamoto also thinks the 3D thing is happening too soon.

1243
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
But see, the 3DS, I'm a lot cooler with

1244
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
that, because, let me tell you the best thing about the 3DS.

1245
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
There's a little lever on the right side, and when you get sick of 3D, you just

1246
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
turn it down, it goes off. Ta-da!

1247
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
The difference between the 3DS and the

1248
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
PlayStation 3, the PlayStation 3 to see 3D,

1249
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
it requires you to buy a bunch of additional hardware.

1250
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Glasses that are really expensive.

1251
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
The TV that's really expensive.

1252
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
The 3DS, you turn it on.

1253
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And you see 3D. And if you don't want to see 3D, you turn

1254
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
the little slider down. And the great thing about that too

1255
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
is if games, say for example, don't want to use 3D,

1256
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
but they want to have a really high resolution, well

1257
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
not really high resolution, but a pretty high resolution screen,

1258
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
they could do that because now the amount of pixels

1259
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
that are on the second screen are nearly doubled, and it's widescreen.

1260
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So you could do pseudo HD type stuff on there

1261
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
if you want to.

1262
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And at the same time, I guess, Sony

1263
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
on their games, they're also limiting the use of

1264
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
1080p 3D in PlayStation 3 games.

1265
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Apparently, Sony's official guidelines

1266
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
for 3D gaming on the PS3 limit

1267
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
the displayed image to a resolution of 720p.

1268
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Even games that run natively at

1269
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
1080p, like Super Stardust HD, are

1270
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
downscaled to 3D mode to two 720p

1271
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
images, one for each eye.

1272
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And I'm guessing this is because

1273
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
the PS3 probably just can't handle that amount

1274
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
of data going through there.

1275
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
It says it will support 3D Blu-ray movies at that

1276
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
resolution, 1080p,

1277
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
later this year, but

1278
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
upping the resolution

1279
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
to

1280
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
1080p also expenses the

1281
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
60 frames per second. So for example,

1282
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Blu-ray movies run at

1283
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
4 frames per second.

1284
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I don't know.

1285
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
It's interesting. Honestly, with resolution

1286
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
and stuff like that, I don't really think it matters. I mean, if you're looking at

1287
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
high def in 3D, it's not gonna matter. It's gonna look cool.

1288
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Whether it's 1080p or 720p.

1289
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I mean, when you have the glasses on, you don't really give a shit. You're like,

1290
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
oh damn, this is just horrible in this 720p.

1291
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
What am I, like, a peasant here?

1292
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
This is ridiculous.

1293
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
It's not enough pay for me. I need my pay.

1294
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
So,

1295
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
one thing though,

1296
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
kind of going back to this, that I had to laugh about,

1297
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
and this isn't even really the 3D stuff, but it just

1298
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
kind of stuck out to me in my mind during the Sony

1299
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
press conference, because it made no sense to me as far as

1300
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
as an actual feature that you would advertise to your

1301
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
customers. One of the things that they said regarding the PlayStation

1302
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Move is like, because

1303
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
you can only do this on the Sony PlayStation 3,

1304
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
because we use Blu-ray technology, Blu-ray technology

1305
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
will allow us to put both the

1306
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
regular version of the game and the Move version of the game

1307
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
on the same disc. And that was

1308
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
a feature that they threw out there. And I'm like,

1309
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I've never seen people

1310
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
not able to put, you know, two different control schemes

1311
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
on one disc before because of disc space. Oh my god,

1312
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
we can't fit. Why would you even put a separate

1313
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
copy of the game on the disc? That's a little redundant if you ask me.

1314
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I'm trying to think. I think you could go back like

1315
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
15 years to the Super Nintendo

1316
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
and a game called King Arthur something

1317
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
that had the mouse. It was one of the few third-party games that supported the mouse.

1318
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
But you know what, you could also use a controller. Oh my god,

1319
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
two different control schemes on one cartridge.

1320
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
The only game, or only games

1321
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I guess that I would say that had two different control schemes,

1322
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
and because they were, you know, released later on,

1323
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
would be those new play control games because they had the Wii remote.

1324
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
But that was added later and that does not count. I mean, that is not

1325
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
something that they released. That was the equivalent of re-releasing

1326
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
the same movie on Blu-ray 3D. Yeah, exactly.

1327
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
And I'm sorry, but

1328
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
nobody is making that argument, oh well, you know,

1329
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
you're gonna have to buy a separate version of Halo 4,

1330
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
the Kinect version, because we just can't fit it on those

1331
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
pesky DVDs. We have to create a whole other game.

1332
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
That's just stupid.

1333
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Going to another little side conversation in our chatroom,

1334
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
SSJ100Matt is saying, do we really need 3D?

1335
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And some of the response is, no, no, no. It's a stupid gimmick.

1336
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Well, and then the other thing if you want to

1337
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
know, 3D is obviously taking away some sort of processing

1338
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
power from, you know, your games.

1339
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
So, they're gonna have to make the games

1340
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
slightly less, you know, elaborate

1341
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
in order to, you know, allow you to do this 3D stuff.

1342
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Now granted, they're gonna have 3D in like Killzone 3 and I'm sure

1343
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
that's gonna look amazing, but, I mean,

1344
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
is that gonna really affect the performance of the game?

1345
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Is what I want to know because they're not adding any additional

1346
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
hardware to, you know, run this 3D stuff. It's just basically

1347
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
data going through them and if they're having to process twice as much data,

1348
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
one for each eye, then you gotta

1349
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
think that that's got a bottleneck somewhere.

1350
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I just don't think I've ever really experienced 3D

1351
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
where it was like, oh my god, blow my hair back, amazing, like,

1352
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
this is just, like when I went and saw Avatar in 3D,

1353
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I was like, okay, this is cool, but I probably would've

1354
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
liked the movie just the same in 2D. I wasn't like,

1355
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
oh my god, 3D was just everything,

1356
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I was moved to tears, it was better than having my dick sucked,

1357
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
it was amazing, ah, you know, it just wasn't

1358
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
that great, you know?

1359
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
3D was not necessary. I thought it was, I thought it

1360
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
actually added a very good dimension to the movie, but that was, you know,

1361
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
It was neat, but it, wait, you wouldn't have felt the same way about the movie

1362
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
in 2D? I probably would've liked it, but if I had seen them

1363
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
both side by side, my preference would go to the 3D.

1364
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
It's just, if it's gonna cost this much money to upgrade

1365
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
right now too, like, it has to be, like, truly, truly amazing.

1366
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Well, it's not cost effective right now. I mean, it's

1367
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
by no means cost effective. And just wait anyways, because

1368
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
it's only a matter of, like, years before holograms, and then you're gonna have to buy

1369
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
your hologram TV, and one step closer to the holodeck,

1370
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
as we always say, that's gaming's ultimate goal, is the holodeck

1371
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
from Star Trek The Next Generation. Everything

1372
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
is just one step closer to the holodeck.

1373
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I have a holodeck in my backyard. Frisbee says, question,

1374
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
all games suggest that you take a 15 minute break after one hour

1375
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
of playing. How many people will hurt their eyes with this 3D stuff?

1376
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I'm kinda curious what the safety manual and

1377
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
disclaimers are gonna look like on the 3DS. I'm very curious about that.

1378
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Don't play for more than 5 seconds. Well, here's

1379
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
the best part about the 3DS. If it starts bugging your eyes,

1380
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
there's a little slider to turn the 3D off.

1381
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Oh my god. And that's awesome. One

1382
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
of the comments I wanted to read, S.J. 100 Matt in our chatroom said,

1383
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
give it five years, maybe there will be enough support for it. Right now, there's

1384
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
nothing worthwhile. It's all James Cameron's fault.

1385
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Maybe that stupid rant he had in E3 2009 actually meant

1386
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
something. I don't remember that rant, but apparently he got up on stage

1387
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
and talked kind of about, you know, the 3D stuff.

1388
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Just, we weren't ready for it. We're not ready to handle it.

1389
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Although it's kinda- You can't handle that extra D.

1390
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
You can't handle the truth. But look at, okay, look at 3D

1391
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
and what it's done so far to cinema. I mean,

1392
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
we're getting a lot of gimmicky movies. And they-

1393
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
We got a lot of gimmicky movies back when, you know,

1394
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
the red-blue-glass 3D was really popular.

1395
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Just a lot of, like,

1396
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
you know, Final Destination in 3D.

1397
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Oh, look at the head flew towards me. You know, Saw

1398
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
in 3D. Oh, look at the head flying towards me.

1399
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
You know, it's Jaws in 3D.

1400
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Oh, look at the head flying towards me. I mean, it's just, it's basically

1401
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
the same stuff over and over. And a lot of these movies

1402
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
that don't necessarily need 3D, like Clash of the Titans,

1403
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
have the 3D tacked onto it and it looks like shit.

1404
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
So, you know, take that, you know, and add that

1405
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
to, like, say, games, and now you're gonna get 3D games that look like shit.

1406
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
It just occurred to me, I thought of something

1407
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
that was Blow My Hair Back Amazing

1408
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
3D experience, that 3D was

1409
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
intricate and necessary to the presentation that would not have been the same

1410
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
without it. Captain EO.

1411
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I was thinking the same thing. Well, and remember that seventh

1412
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
portal thing, the Marvel thing at Great America?

1413
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Those rides that are like that.

1414
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
The Muppet Show. Captain EO, really.

1415
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Captain EO was first, and Captain EO was, what, 1985?

1416
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
86? Yeah.

1417
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
When Captain EO comes out

1418
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
on these 3D TVs, wake me up.

1419
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Then maybe I'm ready for 3D TVs.

1420
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
In the meantime, let's move on to something else that's

1421
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
completely unnecessary. Yeah, I know they did a Captain EO game.

1422
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
That's what the Michael Jackson game should be.

1423
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
None of this, like, imitates his dance moves. I don't give a shit about that.

1424
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Yeah, just build that stuff in a dance. Captain EO and

1425
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Michael Jackson Moonwalker 2. Amazing.

1426
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Moonwalker HD.

1427
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
SSJ-100 Matt says your other answer is Lawnmower Man.

1428
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Remember when Virtual Reality was like the big

1429
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Virtual Reality.

1430
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
They tried. And stock footage of all the Mind's Eye stuff.

1431
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Ooh, that was really cool.

1432
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Yeah, I remember back in the day when Virtual Reality stuff was

1433
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
really big. God, we were stupid back then.

1434
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Alright, speaking of things that are completely

1435
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
useless and unnecessary, Real ID.

1436
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I had to do that. That's a fantastic tie-in, Rob.

1437
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I'm very proud of you. 3 weeks in a row I'm talking about this.

1438
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And look, again, I'm going to say this. I know a lot of you could give two shits

1439
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
about World of Warcraft, but this is important because where Blizzard

1440
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
goes, other companies will inevitably follow.

1441
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I'm going to keep it brief this week. There's two quick things that happen to Real ID

1442
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
that are newsworthy and necessary to cover.

1443
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
First off, this is kind of one of those, like,

1444
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
part of it's really funny and the other part is

1445
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
actually not funny at all. And that is that, you know,

1446
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
a bunch of people when this Real ID, and going back to when they

1447
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Blizzard was saying, oh, we're going to post

1448
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
your real name to the forum whenever you want to make a

1449
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
post, right? Remember that whole thing they had to retract last week?

1450
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Well, a lot of people complained to the ESRB.

1451
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And a lot of people wrote them and said, this game is violating our privacy.

1452
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
You should go back and re-rate this game.

1453
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Kind of like trying to get at them that way. Well, the ESRB sent

1454
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
an apology letter. Well, not really an apology letter, but they sent out

1455
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
a letter of resolution basically saying, thank you

1456
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
for contacting us. Your concerns were legit.

1457
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
It's our understanding that Blizzard provided an update announcing

1458
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
they're not going to do it, so we're closing your request.

1459
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Just kind of one of those, like, you know, hey, we appreciate

1460
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
your concern, but, you know, it's kind of done

1461
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
with now, right? But we wanted to follow up with you anyway.

1462
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Well, here's the part about it that really

1463
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
sucks. All of the people that wrote in

1464
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
to complain, yeah, all of their names

1465
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
and email addresses were in the to field.

1466
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Because somebody didn't think, oh, I should put those in the

1467
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
BCC field. So all

1468
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
of the people who complained had their

1469
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
email addresses exposed.

1470
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Oh, they're going to sue.

1471
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
And now granted, ESRB wrote

1472
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
an apology, like, not even 24 hours later.

1473
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
They sent out an apology that, and the nice thing was

1474
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
they kind of addressed the irony. They didn't try to beat around the bush.

1475
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
They did say in their apology, the fact that our message

1476
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
addressed an individual's concerns with respect to their privacy

1477
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
underscores how truly disappointing a mistake this was on our part.

1478
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
We work with companies to ensure they are handling people's private

1479
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
information with confidentiality, care, and respect. It is only

1480
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
right that we set a good example and do no levs ourselves.

1481
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
So at least they didn't try to give you a BS corporate answer.

1482
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Well, I mean, to some extent. It was a little washed out.

1483
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
You know when they said they were like, aw, crap.

1484
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Well, first off, you know an intern did this.

1485
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
And secondly, when he hit the send button, you know he went,

1486
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
aw, fuck.

1487
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I'm going home. I gotta go home.

1488
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Please don't crap on interns. I'm planning on being an intern. I am an intern.

1489
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I'm just saying. It's not that I'm crapping on interns.

1490
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Rob, an intern designed the FedEx logo.

1491
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Okay. The Federal Express logo or the FedEx logo?

1492
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
The FedEx logo.

1493
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
It's clever. Regardless of whether it was an intern

1494
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
or the CEO, you know after clicking the send button,

1495
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
they went, aw, fuck.

1496
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
The FedEx logo, all that is is just the Federal Express logo.

1497
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
They just dropped it down the FedEx like Bevmo.

1498
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
The E and the X make an arrow.

1499
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
That's very clever.

1500
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Alright, look. Just drop it. It was a mistake on their part.

1501
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
They apologized for it, but it's just one of those

1502
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
moments where you just cover your face with your palm

1503
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
and shake your head. Anyhow, there's more

1504
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
in the Real ID saga. And this is important

1505
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
because after all the ranting I've done in previous episodes,

1506
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
if Blizzard's gonna come out and say, oops, we made a mistake.

1507
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I think it should be acknowledged. And to some extent,

1508
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
that's what's happened this week. Nathera, who's one of the

1509
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
community managers, did post on the official WoW forums

1510
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
about some Real ID follow-ups. One,

1511
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
my biggest complaint about the system as it was, the Friends of Friends

1512
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
feature. She went on to say,

1513
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
they've been evaluating how Real ID has been used since its release

1514
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
to identify the new functionality that will help improve our players' experience, blah blah blah.

1515
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
The in-game Real ID Friends of Friends list is designed

1516
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
to give players a convenient way to populate the Real ID Friends list,

1517
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
blah blah blah, corporate speak corporate speak. Oh, however,

1518
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
we recognize that some players would prefer not to be displayed on Friends

1519
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
lists in this fashion, so we plan to include an option

1520
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
that will allow players to opt out of appearing on

1521
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
their Real ID Friends, Friends of Friends list.

1522
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
This should be ready by the first StarCraft 2 patch.

1523
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Yay!

1524
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Yay, someone knocked some sense into Blizzard.

1525
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
But, I'm not totally over this yet.

1526
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Am I to the point now where my number one concern

1527
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
with Real ID was addressed? Yes.

1528
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
But, I still get a little nervous

1529
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
because remember last week we had that story about the one

1530
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
line of code that would show your real name out there?

1531
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Now, yes, it was hotfix, blah blah blah, but the fact that it existed

1532
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
in the first place, that still kind of makes me nervous.

1533
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
And I think I have a right to question,

1534
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
just where the hell is Blizzard going with all this?

1535
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
And an awesome point that was brought up to me today

1536
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
was Blizzard hasn't said anything about their next MMO yet.

1537
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
And we're anticipating that we're going to be hearing a lot about it

1538
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
at Blizzcon this year.

1539
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
And after all this mess of the past few months

1540
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
and Real ID and this whole trying to get closer and closer

1541
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
into bed with Facebook, I'm kind of really

1542
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
concerned about what Blizzard has planned for their next MMO.

1543
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
FaceCraft?

1544
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Blizzard goes on to say,

1545
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
what are your plans for Facebook integration?

1546
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
With regard to Facebook, our goal is to help Blizzard gamers on Battle.net

1547
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
more easily connect to their real life friends and family.

1548
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
For the launch of Starcraft 2, we are introducing an optional

1549
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Facebook friend finder feature to help achieve this goal.

1550
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
The friend finder enables players who decide to use it

1551
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
to easily populate their Battle.net friends list

1552
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
by sending Real ID friend requests to the people on their

1553
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Facebook friends list who have Battle.net accounts.

1554
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
We hope players will find this feature convenient, but it's completely optional,

1555
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
blah blah blah blah blah. So in other words, you can

1556
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
now, if you want to go onto

1557
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Facebook and pull all of your friends' Real IDs

1558
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
from your Facebook, you can do that, I think is what they're saying?

1559
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
This way people in China

1560
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
that may have to leave their game

1561
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
to visit friends and family

1562
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
don't have to do that. They can sit there and play their games.

1563
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I do not like this direction that Blizzard

1564
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
is going. They are a gaming company. Stop trying to be

1565
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
a social network. Throughout all of this,

1566
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
what they really should have learned,

1567
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
they really need to sit down

1568
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
in a meeting. They need to come into the office Monday morning,

1569
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
sit down in a meeting, and I feel like I can speak

1570
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
to this with some authority. And stop sniffing glue? Well, that's

1571
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
the first place. But I've been a corporate trainer for the past

1572
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
seven years. I sometimes have to facilitate

1573
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
meetings like this. I think these guys

1574
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
should come in, sit down, and really ask

1575
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
themselves, why are we here?

1576
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
What is the goal of our company? Why do people

1577
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
pay us $15 a month? To make money.

1578
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
That's all they're in for the money.

1579
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Do they pay us $15 a month so that they can

1580
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
have their real life be reminded

1581
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
of their real life and their Facebook friends and all this all the time?

1582
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
No. People pay $15 a month to escape the real world

1583
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
and slay internet dragons. That is why they pay the money.

1584
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Are people leaving the game in droves because of this? No.

1585
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I don't think they are.

1586
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Boy, when that announcement went out, yes they did. There was lots of people

1587
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
that posted screenshots, said they were leaving,

1588
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
etc.

1589
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Oh, I'm going to boycott Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.

1590
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Oh, I'm going to boycott Left 4 Dead 2.

1591
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Just like all these people. What they're going to do is wait for them

1592
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
to say the magic words,

1593
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
and then they'll come right back and then they'll get screwed again.

1594
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Salacious Pop says this beautifully.

1595
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
If they are already a real life friend, I know where they are

1596
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
because I've met them. If I want to be on their Facebook,

1597
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
call and ask. Perfect.

1598
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
You know what? From here on out,

1599
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
until Blizzard has decided that they are

1600
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
not going to get into bed with Facebook so much anymore

1601
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
and keep sucking their dick as they've been so much recently,

1602
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
until Blizzard comes out and says,

1603
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
we are games first, I'm going to be referring to

1604
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Blizzard as Blizzinga, because that is what they are.

1605
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
They are Blizzard meets Zynga.

1606
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
So, Blizzinga from here on out.

1607
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
When I say that on the show, you know who I'm talking about.

1608
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
But until they have decided, you know what, we are a gaming company first

1609
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
and maybe we should not try to get so much into

1610
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
the social network stuff or push it down everybody's throats

1611
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
as hard as we've been, they are Blizzinga.

1612
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
And Blizzinga needs to take a cue

1613
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
from Xbox Live,

1614
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
because I think it's one of the things that Microsoft has done very, very well

1615
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
and the great thing about Xbox Live, it does have that

1616
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
community feeling, you have achievements and messages

1617
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
and you have that Facebook integration if you want it

1618
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
and you can find Facebook friends if you want to.

1619
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
It's done right on Xbox Live, I think.

1620
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I don't understand why they make it like you can't

1621
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
like all of a sudden I have to find my friends out there.

1622
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I mean, there's so many social networking sites out there right now.

1623
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Twitter, Facebook, MySpace if you're still using it

1624
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
and a whole bunch of other sites and games that do this.

1625
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Why do I need their help in connecting with my friends?

1626
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I've already connected with my friends probably a dozen times now.

1627
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
And there is still the phone, there's still mail,

1628
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:54,000
there's still email, there's still a bunch of other ways to talk to your friends.

1629
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I just don't understand, it's like, oh my god,

1630
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I'm cut off from the rest of the world unless

1631
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I use Blizzard to connect with my friends.

1632
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Let's see here, Tigerclaw in our chat room says,

1633
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Sky, maybe they should pull an apple and do a Q&A press conference lol.

1634
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Well that's why Blizzingacon 2010 this year is going to be awesome.

1635
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Because there are going to be some of those people that bought tickets

1636
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
before all this shit happened that are going to the con.

1637
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Those developer Q&As are going to be awesome.

1638
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Like, I hate Blizzcon, like I kind of think it's kind of ridiculous

1639
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
and I have zero interest in going and paying $150 to go to one company's E3 booth.

1640
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
But look, this would be the year to go.

1641
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
It's the point where I'm seriously considering getting the DirecTV feed

1642
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
because those Q&A sessions are going to be awesome.

1643
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Angry nerds in the building with the developers who anger them.

1644
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
They will not be angry.

1645
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Reality television show in the making.

1646
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
They'll be drinking the Kool-Aid, they will be just...

1647
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Tables will be overturned.

1648
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
They'll be taking it and they'll be like, hey look at this wheel we got for you.

1649
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
And they'll be like, oh I forgive you for everything you've done.

1650
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
That's so awesome.

1651
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Oh my God.

1652
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Unicycles now in World of Warcraft.

1653
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
That's just the best thing ever.

1654
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
People are sheep.

1655
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
And you know what?

1656
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
The people that follow Apple products, the people that follow Blizzard products

1657
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,000
and countless other different brands out there that just eat up this shit

1658
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
despite all the crap that they do.

1659
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
They're going to still be playing the game.

1660
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
They're still going to forgive them.

1661
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
And you know what?

1662
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
They leave for World of Warcraft, they'll come back for whatever the fuck

1663
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
next MMO they've got because, oh Blizzard's fun.

1664
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I'll give them another try.

1665
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
No one's going to...

1666
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,000
No one really just up and just says, oh forget it.

1667
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I'm not dealing with them anymore until their next shiny thing comes out.

1668
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
They're just going to be right back where they were before.

1669
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I will say that I have quit MMOs from principle.

1670
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
So...

1671
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
But...

1672
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Go ahead.

1673
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
That's the person I am.

1674
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
If I don't like something, I'm not going to put up with it.

1675
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
But would you go back if your problem changed?

1676
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Probably not.

1677
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Really?

1678
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Probably not.

1679
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Well I mean...

1680
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
It ended up getting a lot worse.

1681
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
It was the whole crap with Ragnarok Online and just how stupid they were getting

1682
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
and how...

1683
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
What my problem was with them was them implementing the in-town raids.

1684
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
And it got worse.

1685
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
I had a list of grievances and they weren't doing anything so I quit.

1686
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I've got to read this comment from chat because I've been wanting to get it out there

1687
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
and it has to do with the same topics.

1688
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
So let's just pop in chat.

1689
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Chat.orangewormsready.com if you want to join us on this Sunday night.

1690
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
It says, I don't think it's disingenuous for someone who boycotted something to come back

1691
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
if the bad policy was lifted.

1692
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
That just means you voted with your wallet and it worked so you came back.

1693
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I agree with him.

1694
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
I agree.

1695
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
This kind of reminds me though, SSJ100Matt says,

1696
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,000
are you people still mad at Blizzard about no LAN support?

1697
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Blizzinga, please.

1698
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Blizzinga, whatever.

1699
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
That's your thing, okay?

1700
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I'm not going to try to remember that because that's stupid.

1701
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Well, the name's stupid.

1702
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I'm just with the work on the name.

1703
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Well, because zinga are the people that make Farmville.

1704
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I understand that.

1705
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I get the reference.

1706
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
We don't need to point more attention to them.

1707
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:14,000
No, I was just saying that he brings out a perfect point

1708
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
because they took out a feature that really pissed off everybody else

1709
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
and they're like, oh, I'm boycotting the game.

1710
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,000
How much you want to bet that Starcraft 2 sells millions of fucking copies

1711
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
and it would be like as if that never happened,

1712
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
as if those features were never removed,

1713
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
that maybe the fans still bought it anyways

1714
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
despite being pissed off at the company.

1715
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
So you're basically saying never forget you were pissed about the LAN thing.

1716
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Never forget.

1717
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I've got more of those.

1718
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
There was something else I saw earlier this week.

1719
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I guess we can talk about it real quick because it sort of ties in with Activision.

1720
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Real quick, because we've got to move on to more stories.

1721
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Real quick, I'm sorry.

1722
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
There's another tangent I have to go on here.

1723
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Okay, real quick.

1724
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Remember how I brought up, and no one seemed to give a fucking shit about it,

1725
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,000
remember I brought up that Activision is starting to price Wii games,

1726
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
remember the Wii games usually are 50 bucks retail at the most,

1727
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
for $60 retail for certain games

1728
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
because they think that they should get some more money

1729
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,000
because music licensing or whatever.

1730
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I forgot. Thank you for reminding me to never forget.

1731
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
And I'm not saying that Activision is the only one to blame too

1732
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
because Beel's Rock Band, same thing happened with that.

1733
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
They were charging $60 for the Wii version of the game.

1734
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Well guess what?

1735
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
It's been another year, no one's really complained, and it's happening again.

1736
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
And guess what? It's not just happening now with music games,

1737
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,000
but the new Tony Hawk game is also going to be $60 on the Wii.

1738
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Why? No one's going to buy it anyways,

1739
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
and now you're giving them another reason not to buy it.

1740
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,000
But also, Guitar Hero, Warriors of Rock, I'm sure DJ Hero 2,

1741
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
those are all $60 price points.

1742
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
You guys need to not forget this stuff

1743
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
because they're going to start sneaking out more games like that.

1744
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
And I know for me that's not a big deal

1745
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
because I don't game that much on the Wii,

1746
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
but for other people it might be a big deal.

1747
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
And if you don't stop it here, they're just going to keep going.

1748
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
What's going to stop them from saying,

1749
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
oh, well now we're adding 3D into our 360 games?

1750
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
They're going to be $70 retail.

1751
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Vote with your wallet.

1752
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Seriously, so...

1753
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I think we should make Loki's never forget a regular segment.

1754
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Ray Ayanami says he doesn't play any Blizzard game anyways.

1755
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
You know, you may not play Starcraft 2 or Diablo 3 or this unannounced MMO,

1756
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
but the reason why we spend so much time on it,

1757
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
and I apologize, I know not everyone's into WoW,

1758
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:40,000
but keep in mind, WoW is that behemoth of an RPG game right now anyway.

1759
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Where they go, a lot of the industry tends to follow.

1760
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Blizzard right now is the Rockefellers back in the day,

1761
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
and you know what happened with them.

1762
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Go back and read a history book.

1763
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
And this came up last week, and I think it's doubly true

1764
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
after a lot of this Blizzard talk this week.

1765
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
The WoW killer is WoW.

1766
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
It's just a matter of when.

1767
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
So anyhow, I will tell you what the WoW killer is not,

1768
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,000
because I was reminded I didn't even mention this during my gaming week.

1769
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I played the Final Fantasy XIV beta this week.

1770
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I spent a little time with it.

1771
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
This is my little tangent I wanted to get on,

1772
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
because I forgot to mention this during my gaming week.

1773
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I played the Final Fantasy XIV beta on Tuesday.

1774
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I'm not sure if I'm actually supposed to be talking about it or not, but...

1775
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Who cares?

1776
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Who cares?

1777
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I'll tell you this, it's not my account, so I'm not under any NDA.

1778
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Ha ha ha.

1779
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
So anyhow, I'm not going to tell you whose it is though.

1780
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I played the beta, and it's awful.

1781
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
It is awful.

1782
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:42,000
It is horrible, awful, laggy, not fun.

1783
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I'm not buying this game when it comes out if it's in this shape.

1784
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Granted, it's a beta, not a demo.

1785
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Betas are buggy, betas are slow.

1786
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
But betas also are supposed to give me an impression, at least,

1787
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
of what I'm to expect in the final product.

1788
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I got dumped into this world with no explanation

1789
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
what I was supposed to do, where I'm supposed to go,

1790
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
how you proceed, all these fancy big words of guild levs

1791
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
and armethith crystals and these quests and all these things,

1792
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
and I realized I could probably go online and figure it out,

1793
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
but I thought the big thing about Final Fantasy XIV

1794
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
was that it was supposed to be more accessible than Final Fantasy XI was.

1795
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,000
It's not in its current shape.

1796
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
This game is supposed to come out September 30th.

1797
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,000
It is not ready. Not ready.

1798
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I'll try it again. I'll try the beta one more time

1799
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
before the actual game is released to see if maybe they added some expositions.

1800
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
I will say this. At first, I was like,

1801
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Ooh, this is pretty. Ooh, this cutscene is so pretty.

1802
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Ooh, my characters in this cutscene.

1803
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Oh, my gosh, this is a beautiful game.

1804
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
This looks so amazing. This character customization is really thorough.

1805
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:56,000
And then I was stuck in the city running around for an hour

1806
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
because I had no idea where the hell I was supposed to be going

1807
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
or what I was supposed to be doing.

1808
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I want to try it.

1809
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
It's bad.

1810
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I still want to try it.

1811
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
It's bad.

1812
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I want to try it though.

1813
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Just so I can see how bad.

1814
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
S2100Matt says,

1815
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
So wait, Rob, what you're describing is Final Fantasy XI.

1816
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Yeah, kinda.

1817
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Yeah.

1818
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
At least with Final Fantasy XI, I don't know.

1819
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Maybe it was because I had friends that played,

1820
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
but I still feel like I was able to figure it out somewhat,

1821
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,000
but I went into combat. I was fighting a rat or something.

1822
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I don't even know, and I got frozen in combat,

1823
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
and the rat wasn't targetable anymore,

1824
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
and I had to abandon the quest,

1825
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
and if I wanted to start the quest again,

1826
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I would have had to run 30 minutes back into town.

1827
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
It was ridiculous.

1828
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Again, I know it's a beta.

1829
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I'm not supposed to be giving my final impressions on the game,

1830
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
but if the beta was supposed to be raising my excitement

1831
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
for somebody that spent three years of his life

1832
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
playing Final Fantasy XI, didn't work.

1833
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
I'll tell you that.

1834
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
That's a shame.

1835
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Yeah, it is a shame. It's a real shame.

1836
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
What's also a shame nowadays

1837
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
is that it will still be released on the 30th,

1838
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,000
and what'll happen then is just,

1839
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,000
oh, well, we'll patch it later.

1840
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Well, I mean, they still have time to patch it, but not much.

1841
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
All right, let's actually get to another story.

1842
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
I'm sorry we've taken up so much time with real ID and stuff,

1843
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
but, you know, this stuff's important.

1844
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Jamie, what do you got for us?

1845
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
What about a story I never played?

1846
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Nice.

1847
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Okay, because a lot of people love games on Facebook,

1848
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
and a lot of people love Zuma.

1849
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I think you said you liked Zuma, didn't you?

1850
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Zuma's pretty fun.

1851
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
It's not my favorite PopCap game,

1852
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
but I don't think there's any PopCap games

1853
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
that are really bad, per se.

1854
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Like, they get the job done.

1855
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
As far as casual games go, they're all crackerific.

1856
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I love Peggle.

1857
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I love Peggle, too.

1858
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,000
At any rate, Zuma Blitz is gonna be coming out on Facebook.

1859
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,000
It's supposed to have in about three weeks a beta,

1860
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
and then we should start seeing tournaments and levels

1861
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,000
and experience points and getting different features

1862
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,000
and treasure chests and virtual currency and blah, blah, blah.

1863
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
So it should be cool.

1864
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I mean, it's gonna go up there with Bejeweled Blitz,

1865
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
and that's got a lot of people playing it.

1866
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I like me some Zuma, and it should be good,

1867
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
and I know a lot of people eat that up,

1868
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
especially on Facebook, so it's gonna be cool.

1869
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
You know, the only thing that I play on Facebook right now

1870
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
is that Hotel City thing.

1871
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
You know who would like that?

1872
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Xtifer.

1873
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
He used to play lots of Zuma.

1874
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
That's right, he did.

1875
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Someone should tell him.

1876
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
He should be listening.

1877
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Blazinga, take note.

1878
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
PopCap knows how to do the Facebook integration thing,

1879
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
just saying.

1880
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,000
And, um, well...

1881
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
No, never mind, we've beaten this horse.

1882
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
It's already dead and bleeding from his pores.

1883
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Give it another whip.

1884
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
You haven't said enough on this.

1885
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
We haven't skinned the horse yet.

1886
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
It's not over until we skin the horse.

1887
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Because my Vicodin's wearing off.

1888
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,000
I really think that, well, I was just thinking about

1889
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
what you said about them really needing to sit down

1890
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
and go over their business model,

1891
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
but what if this is actually a true integrated part

1892
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
of their business model?

1893
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Abandon ship.

1894
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
I'm gonna just go back and say one thing about it.

1895
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Everybody, if you really are displeased with it,

1896
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
do it in numbers.

1897
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Hit them in the bank and do it with people.

1898
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Organize.

1899
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
But then where will I fight my internet dragons?

1900
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
There's other games, Rob.

1901
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Rob?

1902
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
It's just not the same.

1903
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
What did I say last time?

1904
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Principle versus entertainment.

1905
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
What's more important?

1906
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I don't know. I really like entertainment, Jamie.

1907
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Entertainment, Rob?

1908
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Rarely got anything going in motion.

1909
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Well, this is interesting.

1910
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:56,000
THQ apparently is impressed by the 3DS piracy protection.

1911
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Of course, you may remember the piracy has been

1912
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,000
a really big problem for the Nintendo DS,

1913
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:07,000
and tons and tons of games being hurt by the amount of piracy

1914
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
that there is on that system,

1915
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
and because it's so very easy to do.

1916
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Ian Curran, THQ's executive VP of global publishing,

1917
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:23,000
is saying that what excites me even more about the 3DS

1918
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
is that there's technology built into the device

1919
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
to really combat piracy.

1920
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
He added, they combated piracy on the DSI,

1921
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
which they don't believe is cracked yet,

1922
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
but they know they've been hurt across the world,

1923
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:44,000
and they believe that the 3DS has got the technology to stop that.

1924
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
I'm kind of curious what that is, but I guess they can't tell us,

1925
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
or then the pirates would start getting to work.

1926
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Well, here's my observation about that.

1927
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Nintendo thinks that they've stopped piracy on the DSI.

1928
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Really?

1929
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I mean, because I've seen flash carts with the DSI.

1930
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I'm not going to go buy a DSI,

1931
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
because I'm probably going to pick up a 3DS eventually,

1932
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:13,000
but I mean, they haven't stopped piracy on the DSI,

1933
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:18,000
and they're just going to get smarter.

1934
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I mean, since it's basically cartridges it's reading off of,

1935
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
if you can mimic the data that's on there,

1936
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
then I don't see how it can really stop it.

1937
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
I mean, they have anti-piracy measures that they put into the games,

1938
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,000
but it takes like a week or two to crack them at the most,

1939
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
and a lot of them get cracked day one, if not early,

1940
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
because they come out in other regions.

1941
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I guess we won't really truly have the second half to this story

1942
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
until the 3DS is out.

1943
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
We know what that anti-piracy measure is,

1944
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
but it just seems like an echo of what we always hear.

1945
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
It'll probably take a few months,

1946
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,000
but considering the technology is still going to be somewhat backwards compatible

1947
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
because it's going to be playing DS games,

1948
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
it's going to probably be as easy to crack as the DSIs,

1949
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
so it'll be a matter of time.

1950
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I don't think that they've finally solved the problem.

1951
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Well, here's something, and maybe this ties into it.

1952
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
I don't know. This could be interesting,

1953
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,000
but you know the 3DS has something that they talked about briefly called Tag Mode,

1954
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,000
which I always thought was supposed to be a part of the regular DS,

1955
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
but it kind of wasn't.

1956
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
But anyway, what Tag Mode is supposed to be,

1957
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,000
a passive communication feature that lets the DS systems talk to each other

1958
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
and send the data back and forth,

1959
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
which I always thought was some type of, it was in the DS, right,

1960
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
because you could carry Animal Crossing around in your pocket,

1961
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
but of course now you had to have the game on,

1962
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
and you had to be in that mode that sent out the letter in the bottle

1963
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
or whatever it was, that mode. Remember that?

1964
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
You could send the letters in the bottle.

1965
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,000
But anyhow, I'm assuming this Tag Mode doesn't require that.

1966
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Like maybe your DS can be off, and it still will tag.

1967
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Maybe it uses low battery power to still kind of do this when it's asleep.

1968
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Yeah.

1969
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
I don't know.

1970
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,000
But there is a little more information given by Hideki Kono,

1971
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
who is the platform producer of the 3DS,

1972
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
in an interview with Wired Magazine.

1973
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000
He says, in the hardware, we have the capability that when you first play a game

1974
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:16,000
that supports Tag Mode, it will save to a Tag Mode data slot in the hardware system.

1975
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
We're planning to support multiple games at the same time.

1976
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
So that's the difference.

1977
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Mario Kart, Nintendogs, Animal Crossing, and so forth.

1978
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I see, because right now the game does have to be running.

1979
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,000
So there will actually be a Tag Mode viewer where you can manage the data.

1980
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
It will bring consumers a sense of wanting to play a game again

1981
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,000
after they get new data from games that they'd already forgotten about.

1982
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:42,000
What if the piracy is firmware updates delivered through Tag?

1983
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I'm sure that's one way they can do it.

1984
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
That's what I'm thinking.

1985
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Like maybe that's one of the ways they're going to do it,

1986
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
is that you don't have a choice.

1987
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
These things are going to show up on your system

1988
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
because you walked by someone else with the newer firmware.

1989
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Wouldn't that be amazing? I bet that's it.

1990
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
I bet that's one of the antivirus images they have in it.

1991
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Well, one of the original ways that they used to have the flash carts kind of work

1992
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:08,000
is they had some sort of thing with the Wi-Fi where you could do something with it.

1993
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I don't remember.

1994
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I probably sound like an idiot with this.

1995
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,000
But I know there was something that involved Wi-Fi at one point

1996
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
with the original DS flash carts and stuff

1997
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:23,000
when they were first getting those to work with proprietary code and stuff like that.

1998
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
It's possible.

1999
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I think it's kind of a neat feature.

2000
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Speaking of going back to play games that we haven't played in a while,

2001
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
and I'm sure most people out there already know this is possible,

2002
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
but since I don't check up everything on the internet,

2003
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I was unaware that they had these things.

2004
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Apparently there's a track editor for Mario Kart Wii, and that's awesome

2005
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
because there's all sorts of cool tracks out there that people have made.

2006
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
I'm like, ooh, that's exciting.

2007
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
That would actually get me to go back and play Mario Kart.

2008
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Why didn't they include that as a feature in the goddamn game to begin with?

2009
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,000
It would be so epic.

2010
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
But then, of course, they couldn't sell Mario Kart 2.

2011
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Yeah, exactly. That would be in the sequel.

2012
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
I mean, look at LittleBigPlanet, though.

2013
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
I mean, they could easily.

2014
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Or ModNation Racers, which that's the whole thing, basically.

2015
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Exactly.

2016
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Such a missed opportunity.

2017
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Sj100Matt, in commenting on the possible tag mode is the anti-piracy,

2018
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Sj100Matt says, Nintendo isn't that smart.

2019
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Let's see.

2020
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Toygak says, wireless is a battery hog. It better not be on.

2021
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
You can probably turn it off.

2022
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Well, yeah, and there's probably a thing where it uses really, really low battery

2023
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,000
until it detects that DS, and then it uses it for a minute, and then shuts back off.

2024
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Like, I don't see why the technology isn't there to do that,

2025
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
where it slowly drains your battery.

2026
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
But the battery power, you know, it's been, what, five years since the last DS?

2027
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Or, sorry, not the last DS, but the first DS?

2028
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I would think they've probably made the batteries in those things a lot better.

2029
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,000
And it's not like the games probably require that much more battery.

2030
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I mean, yeah, they're 3D, but I don't think it's going to be that much more.

2031
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,000
And Sj100Matt says, yeah, it does sound like the Pokewalker type of technology.

2032
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Sj100Matt also says, maybe they can track me via my 20-digit friend code.

2033
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Didn't they say they're going to...

2034
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Oh, God, I hope they're not going to do friend codes this summer.

2035
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I think they kind of hinted they might be doing away with that.

2036
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Or changing it, I suppose.

2037
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
10-digit friend codes, woohoo!

2038
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
One-digit friend codes.

2039
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
All right, let's move on to another story.

2040
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Dark Sakura's got something for us, and then release dates.

2041
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
And the classic game of the week is not too far away.

2042
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Well, for fans of Josh Stone, she's going to be the next Bond girl, at least, in James Bond Bloodstone.

2043
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Josh Stone. Bloodstone.

2044
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:54,000
She'll be playing Nicole Hunter, who is a socialite, works in diamonds, and said that she thinks it's crazy to be a Bond girl.

2045
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:04,000
So, just talking about having a full-body scan and everything, but it's supposed to be a third-person cover-based shooter with vehicle stuff in there.

2046
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
It's the bizarre creation tool.

2047
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Including cars and speedboats. So, should be fun.

2048
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Her name is Nicole Hunter.

2049
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Nicole Hunter.

2050
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,000
In the game. That's kind of a shitty Bond girl name.

2051
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Like, whatever happened to Pussy Galore? That was awesome.

2052
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:27,000
And you know, even what was her name? Denise Richards was like Christmas something, or it was something really ridiculous.

2053
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Nicole Hunter.

2054
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Nicole Hunter is kind of boring.

2055
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Well, she did, though, describe the character as a posh version of Paris Hilton.

2056
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I thought Paris Hilton was supposed to be kind of posh already.

2057
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
No.

2058
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
I mean, she's kind of trashy.

2059
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
She's posher!

2060
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
She's like, more posher. Oh, okay, that explains it.

2061
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:51,000
I would probably say, I would exchange that word with classy.

2062
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Let's make the character like Paris Hilton.

2063
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,000
She's not posh enough! I can't make her any more posher!

2064
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Of course, if you want to make the character more posher, you should have gotten posh spice.

2065
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
I was saying classy.

2066
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:12,000
At any rate, you know, if they wanted to make her real trailer trash, you know, they probably just could have called her Atmore Motel 6.

2067
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Salacious Pop, thank you. Christmas Jones. She was a nuclear physicist.

2068
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,000
That was Denise Richards in, whatever, like, was it Tomorrow Never Dies?

2069
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,000
She played a character named Christmas Jones. How ridiculous is that name?

2070
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Christmas Jones.

2071
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Nicole Hunter? That's, I don't, like, I don't know, but I probably knew a girl in high school named that.

2072
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Like, that's not that exciting.

2073
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Now we got all these random Bond, Bond girl type names being yelled out here. Honey Rider, Posher Spice, maybe that could be the name.

2074
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Toa Gax says Paris Hilton equals Pussy Here, Pussy There, Pussy Pussy Everywhere.

2075
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
That's kind of how she got famous.

2076
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Bond girl names could be exchangeable with, you know, porn star names too.

2077
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Oh, yeah, Jinx. Wasn't Hal Berry called Jinx?

2078
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
What was her name? I think it was Jinx, because they were going to do a spinoff movie.

2079
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
By the way, you know what my favorite porn star name is?

2080
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
What?

2081
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Alice in Chains. I just thought it was funny.

2082
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,000
And lastly, before we move on to release dates, let's just pop in our chatroom.

2083
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Chat.overtonesloudandstrated.com says, how is Paris Hilton like Kansas?

2084
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Both are flat, white, and easy to enter.

2085
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Strawberry Fields. Really? That was a Bond girl? Strawberry Fields?

2086
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:40,000
See, Strawberry Fields, Pussy Galore, Christmas Jones, Nicole Hunter.

2087
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
It just doesn't work.

2088
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Alright, let's move on. Release dates. Travel around the world and talk about games coming out soon.

2089
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,000
In a store near you. We'll start with the US, Loki.

2090
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:58,000
You know, her name's sort of broken down. It could sound like Hole Hunter, so I mean, you know.

2091
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Sort of.

2092
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
What about Mike Hunter?

2093
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Mike Hunter.

2094
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
That would have been better.

2095
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
I did know a guy named Benjamin Dover.

2096
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Poor guy.

2097
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:14,000
So stuff coming out this week. Not a whole lot, because July is a pretty slow month.

2098
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,000
But there's some generic DS games, of course, coming out.

2099
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Hidden Objects Mystery Stories. That's another Hidden Objects game.

2100
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Yeah, because there's not a lot of those on the DS.

2101
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Apparently Trackmania Turbo, but I somehow doubt that's actually coming out, because I think I got delayed to October.

2102
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Samantha Swift and the Hidden Roses of Athena, which also I believe was delayed forever.

2103
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,000
And I definitely go Trackmania on the Wii, man.

2104
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:49,000
You know, GameStop needs to update their fucking release list. It is terrible.

2105
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Mumbo Jumbo 6-Pack Seccident Edition. It's six games from Mumbo Jumbo that you can buy on PC.

2106
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Hooray!

2107
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Wow, is that it?

2108
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,000
So there's, like, nothing coming out this week. That can't be right.

2109
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Maybe it's just a slow week.

2110
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Well, Hidden Objects Mystery Stories it is.

2111
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,000
I gotta go back to chat. I know the Bond girl thing is getting old, but this comment is too good.

2112
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I'll look at a different list, because that's a pathetic listing.

2113
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Eric H. is in our chat tonight. He's actually the brains behind the big battle over at Dead Pixel Live, so welcome.

2114
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:34,000
He says, Christmas Jones led to the worst end lines of any Bond film. I thought Christmas only came once a year.

2115
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Okay, there is other things this week. I forgot.

2116
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,000
They had him on weird release dates, so it didn't really make sense to me.

2117
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Dark Star One Broken Alliance on Xbox 360, which that game actually reminds me of.

2118
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:56,000
I don't know if anyone remembers this PlayStation 1 game, but Colony Wars, or even, like, Descent Free Space.

2119
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
So that might be kind of cool on 360.

2120
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Ark Rise Fantasia on the Wii, really awesome role-playing game.

2121
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:10,000
And Cats and Dogs Revenge of Kitty Galore on DS.

2122
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:18,000
And I don't think it's on this list, but I remember it, and why the god hell did they make this game in the first place.

2123
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,000
The Bachelor, featuring The Bachelorette, as well on Wii and DS.

2124
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Yes, the Bachelor video game. That is correct. And Zany Golf on Wii.

2125
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Really? Like, what game do you make out of- is that the closest thing we're gonna get in America to a dating sim?

2126
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Um... Maybe?

2127
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,000
I wanna be the Bachelor that rejects them all. Like, didn't that happen on one of them?

2128
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Like, he or she, I don't remember, one of them just said,

2129
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
You know what? You all suck. I don't want any of you.

2130
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Oh, fuck you all. I'm outta here.

2131
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Later. Oh, I played again.

2132
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Losers. I just wanna get laid. Done. I don't need you.

2133
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Christmas only came once a year. On the Xbox 360 in Japan this week.

2134
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Blur Razors comes out in Japan this week. You know, I'm kind of thinking that is actually Blur over there, and it is.

2135
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,000
But they call it Blur- it's Blur Racers. On this website it's incredibly spelled.

2136
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Razors? I know, I thought that was a dumb name.

2137
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Blue Racers!

2138
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Blue Racers with a Z, by the way. That's important. Blur Racers with a Z is out in Japan this week.

2139
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Bruh. Bruh.

2140
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Stop it. 99 Nights 2 comes out in Japan this week.

2141
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:39,000
I saw that on the shelf at the gaming store. I thought about buying it for five seconds, and I was like, what am I thinking?

2142
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:45,000
That's pretty much it on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan, so unfortunately you guys had to wait for some of the games we've had here.

2143
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:54,000
But on PlayStation 3 you get Blur Racers as well, or Ken Tomahou to Gakuno Mono is coming out as well.

2144
01:21:54,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I don't even know what this is. This is an upgraded version of the Cute Fantasy School Life RPGs.

2145
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
This must be a remake of an old game that's now available.

2146
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:08,000
It looks like it involves kind of like the card style battle in the game.

2147
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Kind of mixed with a Dragon Warrior-esque style battle system.

2148
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:18,000
I like how in big letters it says Hito! On that screenshot.

2149
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:24,000
So that's probably not something coming out over here, because that does not look familiar to me at all.

2150
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:30,000
But on the Nintendo Wii this week, one new game, Kage no Tu is coming out this week on the Wii.

2151
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:37,000
This is a Hudson game. You control a light source to solve puzzles and battle monsters.

2152
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:41,000
This is not a game I'm familiar with over here.

2153
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:50,000
No, that's Lost in Shadow that's coming out. It's that really cool, trippy puzzle platform game.

2154
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,000
I did see that at PAX East I think they were showing that.

2155
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Okay, so it's that. It's Kage no Tu over there in Japan.

2156
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Yeah, it's coming out over here in September.

2157
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:13,000
I like how on Play Asia they have a wonderful combo where I can buy blur razors for the PS3 and I can combo with blur razors for the PS3.

2158
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Oh, I'm sorry, that's blur on the PS3 in case I want both versions of the game.

2159
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
You're gonna play American and Japanese. Why not?

2160
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,000
It's the same game.

2161
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
I'm not playing both. It's region free.

2162
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:30,000
On the Nintendo DS, Katekyo Hitman Reborn DS Flame Rumble XX. Yes, that is really the game's name.

2163
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
They have some crazy names over there.

2164
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
They like their subtitles.

2165
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
They love their subtitles. They really do.

2166
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Well, remember how long the one Street Fighter I have is like something, something, something for matching service.

2167
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Remember, the longer the subtitles, the better the game.

2168
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:56,000
TV Anime Fairy Tale Gekitou Madoushi Kessen comes out as well. Is this like an interactive anime?

2169
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
That sounds like a really good game.

2170
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:04,000
It looks like an action game that's just based on an anime. Like the anime plays on the bottom screen and you're kind of controlling the top screen.

2171
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Looks a little silly.

2172
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:12,000
And lastly, going to the PSP for Japanese release dates, Fate slash Extra is the big release this week on the PSP.

2173
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:18,000
It's coming out in regular and limited editions because the only thing they love more in subtitles are limited editions in Japan.

2174
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Yeah, but my limited edition has a bowl and a plate and a knife and a clock.

2175
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Well, this is an RPG on the PSP. It actually looks kind of cool.

2176
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:32,000
It's kind of got a very Phantasy Star look to it. The newer Phantasy Star games, that is.

2177
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Yeah.

2178
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Kind of in its like action-y type attack. I got to say, this looks kind of neat, actually.

2179
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Who's the spy? Marvelous. So it's not even by Sega, but it kind of looks inspired by the newer Phantasy Star games, at least to me, at first glance.

2180
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
There it is, your Japanese release dates. How about the UK?

2181
01:24:48,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Well, in the UK we have some games. We have, um, on the 19th we have Alien Swarm and the 20th Need for Speed World. Those are both PC, by the way.

2182
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:09,000
The 23rd is Dragon Quest IX Sentinels of the Starry Skies, and that's it until... Yeah, that's it.

2183
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Alright. Just a couple quick more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week while we transition into Part B tonight.

2184
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Loki, you got something else for us?

2185
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Guess what? If you've signed up for the PlayStation Plus service, you may be a wonderful contestant in checking out Hulu Plus as well.

2186
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Hey, it's another service with Plus in the name. It's got to be good, right?

2187
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Which will become available to select subscribers of the Sony's PlayStation Plus program starting now.

2188
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Apparently, eventually all subscribers may be able to check out the Hulu Plus service once it finally launches.

2189
01:25:52,000 --> 01:26:00,000
But as of right now, you can download the Hulu Plus software and request an invitation to an exclusive preview.

2190
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:08,000
And if you're chosen, then you can preview the wonderful stuff that Hulu Plus will be allowing you to check out.

2191
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Am I hearing you correctly that you're telling me, if I pay Sony $50 a year, I might get the opportunity.

2192
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:33,000
I might get selected, my name might get pulled out of that hat, and I would be given the opportunity with my $50 a year to pay Hulu $10 a year to watch old crap on TV.

2193
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Am I correct in what I'm hearing?

2194
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
You are correct, and doesn't it sound awesome?

2195
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Sign me the fuck up! All this and core? Wow!

2196
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:51,000
I don't know, I got nothing.

2197
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,000
It was beyond my ability to comment on, Rob.

2198
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Wait, can I tune in Hulu Plus stuff on my TV in my Sony home apartment?

2199
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Probably not.

2200
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Can I possibly, I don't know, put out core magazines in my Sony apartment on home, like on my coffee table or anything like that?

2201
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:22,000
I don't think you can do that, but in the mall they sometimes show clips from core.

2202
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Oh wow, clips! I'm gonna stay there in the mall forever until I see the whole month of core, just so I don't have to pay for it.

2203
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:35,000
And eventually I'll see all the clips, so that's gonna be a worthwhile investment of my time.

2204
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:42,000
You know, there's the OLR clubhouse right now, right? We have a clubhouse at home. Dumbest $5 I ever spent, but I had to do it.

2205
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,000
OLR, we love to explore new ways to interact with our audience and all these social things.

2206
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Some of those ways may not be good.

2207
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Stupid dollars. Look, look, I took the hit for the team, okay? I spent $5 on this clubhouse at home.

2208
01:27:53,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Right now, we're limited to 25 members, and believe it or not, I don't know how this is possible, but I still get requests at least once a week to join the club, and I have to just file them away and ignore them.

2209
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Trust me, you're not missing out on anything.

2210
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Yeah, here's the thing. The clubhouse is a room, and I decorated it with the arcade machines that I won in the Namco demo, and I tried to put some stuff in there, but I can't put anything...

2211
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:32,000
I can't put anything OLR-related in there. I can't put a clip from the show. There's a giant TV that sits at the top of the clubhouse. I can't do anything with it.

2212
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:45,000
I can't put, like, video, you know, because we've shot video before. I can't put that there. I can't put... I can't even put, like, the OLR artwork on the wall. I can do nothing.

2213
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:52,000
So what you're saying is you've transformed your OLR clubhouse into your game room.

2214
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Yes, I did.

2215
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Oh, Sony.

2216
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:05,000
And I paid five bucks for that exclusive opportunity to beta test the clubhouses.

2217
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Feeling a little impotent now?

2218
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:19,000
I'm just shocked. I'm hearing the words come out of my mouth, and I want to smack myself on the back of the head and call me an idiot. I paid five dollars to beta test the clubhouse.

2219
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Here's the funny part about it, though.

2220
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
God, I'm an idiot.

2221
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:34,000
They're still, like, gung-ho with home and saying, oh, it's such a wonderful platform. Oh my god, it's so successful. Doesn't that sound a little bit like, oh my god, sodium one will blow your fucking mind?

2222
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:53,000
UMD is such a wonderful format. It will change the world in, like, portable media. Damn it! Digital content? On a memory stick? Ah! Why didn't we think of that first?

2223
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
It's just so funny.

2224
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Okay, okay. We're going to make this just fucking kick-ass game in home, and we're going to give it away for free, alright? You ready?

2225
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:13,000
You're going to be in a tank, and you go around in this 3D space, and you shoot other tanks. Oh my god, it's a print! Run with it. It's amazing.

2226
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:28,000
And you can, like, post to your... You'll be able to post to your Twitter when you overtake other tanks, and you'll win stuff for your house. But not your real house, your fake house. And shirts.

2227
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Oh, but then you have to pay for additional levels once you get there. And for the record, I never got to the point where I had to buy additional levels because I got bored with the game that quick.

2228
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Look, I just... And for those that think we're being Xbox fanboys right now and giving Sony an unbelievable amount of hate, look, I'll just say this. Never forget Yaris.

2229
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:57,000
So, it can happen to anyone, alright?

2230
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Hey! Speaking of the Xbox, actually, maybe this is a good thing to follow it up with. You know how they're making this awesome new channel called The Destination Arcade?

2231
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Actually, it's not really... It doesn't actually sound that awesome at all. Destination Arcade is, like, this store that you can download to see the store in a whole new way.

2232
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:33,000
I mean, really, that's what it is. Destination Arcade, like, when we release this, you guys, you're gonna get to see the store in a whole new way. You're gonna have this all-new opportunity to buy things.

2233
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Man, that sounds awesome! And everybody's like, fuck yeah, sign me up! Destination Arcade's gonna be the shit!

2234
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Well, guess what? Major Nelson came out and said, okay, so Destination Arcade, you get to download it this week and it's gonna, like, blow your mind, and then August 18th, we're shutting it off!

2235
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,000
So, it's a limited time only!

2236
01:31:53,000 --> 01:32:06,000
We fixed all the problems with, you know, Xbox Live Arcade. We made things easier to find for a limited time, and then you're gonna have to go back to finding things the old hard way. Why bother?

2237
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:28,000
So, there you go. I don't even have to defer to yours. This is just as stupid. You know what this is just like? This is just like, hey, guess what, guys? We know that you've been bitching about the D-Pad forever, and we're gonna release these wonderful limited edition FIFA controllers that are green, that have the D-Pad fixed, but it's only for a limited time. We're going back to the crappy broken D-Pad.

2238
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Okay, apparently, I didn't even know this until just now. Here's the best part. Wait for it, guys. Okay, so Major Nelson had an interview with Shaq News, apparently, and said that, I didn't even know this, I'm hearing this for the first time, said to Shaq News, if you've downloaded it, it will continue to work, but you can only download it until August 18th, apparently.

2239
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:16,000
So, if you wanna be part of this exclusive club, that's like, I don't even know, that's like going to a mall, and like, you could go to Macy's to buy clothes, or you could go to JCPenney, but you know what, you had to sign up for this, during this month-long promotion to go to JCPenney.

2240
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:26,000
And if you didn't sign up during that time, there's gonna be a guard at the door who's just gonna bounce you. Like, did you download this between July and August? Come on in. Fuck you, go to Macy's. We don't want your business.

2241
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:37,000
It's gonna be like this. It's gonna be like, okay, if you've downloaded this program, all the clothes will be on the shelf, but if you haven't downloaded this program, you're gonna have to go to the store where all the clothes are in a giant pile in the middle.

2242
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:47,000
They're just on the floor. It'll be like that old Nick game show, Finders Keepers.

2243
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Just to let everybody know right now, at this point, Rob has doubled over and put his head between his knees.

2244
01:33:53,000 --> 01:34:08,000
I mean, how many news stories have we read tonight that just don't make any fucking sense? Like, what is wrong with all of you? Are you all high? Did they give out drugs in E3 this year?

2245
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Well, why didn't we get to go then? I want drugs.

2246
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:23,000
You don't understand. Blasinga, Sony, Microsoft, you're all stupid. What is wrong? Rob is breathless with disbelief.

2247
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,000
We just figured it out. Our eyes are open.

2248
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:31,000
I just simply cannot. Rob's gonna cry.

2249
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:40,000
That's the perfect thing to do when you've solved problems in making things easier to find. You cancel it. That's perfect. That makes sense to me.

2250
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Not much makes sense anymore in this world.

2251
01:34:45,000 --> 01:35:00,000
So, enjoy this very special store that you can only download for a limited time. And Salacious Pop's asking, so is it like a skin or what? You know, I don't know. I'm just told it's like this super special new way.

2252
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:07,000
It's fairy dust, okay? It's fairy dust.

2253
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
I got nothing.

2254
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:20,000
We're gonna offer this free game for a limited time. It's featuring a car from Toyota called the Yaris. It's gonna blow your mind.

2255
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Alright, you guys. We're gonna put out this vision camera.

2256
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
That was so bad it made me burp.

2257
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:44,000
We're gonna put out this camera and it's gonna allow you to play these awesome fucking games like totem ball. Yeah, it's like pinball, but you like use your hands. Use your hands. You flail. You make the pinball thingy go.

2258
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:51,000
By the way, this is the same company that's putting out a camera this year that you're gonna use your hands to.

2259
01:35:51,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Rob, yeah, let's not. It's too painful. What if it's too late for me to sell back my vision camera for, say, some store credit?

2260
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Salacious Pop in our chatroom says, Major Nelson announces new store, announces that Seattle has the best weed, and that this dude at Rare takes the biggest bong hits he's ever seen.

2261
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:19,000
You know what? I think we need to take, we need to take a, what? Yes, Loki, final. I have a great idea. Yes.

2262
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:27,000
We want to show off the Kinect to get people excited about it. What store can we back connect with?

2263
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:39,000
God, Macy's. Where do all the people that play Kinect gather on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays between noon and 8 p.m.?

2264
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Where are they all at? Where would I go? Would I go to the mini golf? No, fuck the mini golf place. Would I go, would I go to the movies? No, no. Kinect players don't go to the movies. I know. We'll go to Macy's, who doesn't even have an electronics department.

2265
01:36:54,000 --> 01:37:05,000
What the fuck? Oh, that's fun. You're all high.

2266
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:15,000
So let's take a look at the way they did it in the past. Let's see how you used to get high in the 80s, huh? With the trip down memory lane and the classic game of the week.

2267
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:25,000
That's right. We're going to take a moment to see the drug induced effects of video games back in the day. And boy, did Jamie pick a good one tonight for this topic, didn't you, Jamie?

2268
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:40,000
I'm sure that did. I just want to point out, she picks these well before the show starts. It's just, it's just too good tonight.

2269
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:52,000
And I really put this in an honor of classic gaming expo because it's there every year. You mean, um, the California extreme? Whatever that thing was. Yeah, California extreme. The event that let you in free with a media pass? Yeah.

2270
01:37:52,000 --> 01:38:02,000
I know they were great. Well, I'm, I'm covering it at media like and stuff. By the way, she just took another Vicodin folks. So you're in for a real treat in part B.

2271
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Well, my element was wearing off. I was in pain. Um, anyway, um, so yeah, Journey. Uh, Bally Midway put it out in the 80s. Um, and, uh, it was after, you know, Frontiers, which was their 1983 album by Journey, you know, got them really popular.

2272
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:40,000
So, um, it was supposed to go along with the US band tour. Um, and then, um, it was actually, uh, brought in incredible technologies as a second team of developers to, uh, bring it out for Christmas around that time.

2273
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:58,000
And so it's features the, who the band members were at the time, which was Steve Perry and Neil Sean, uh, Steve Smith, Jonathan Cain and Ross Valerie. Um, they have a sort of cartoon bodies, but their faces are really like these digital black and white photographs from while they were on tour.

2274
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Um, and it was supposed to use, um, this, uh, photo technology for another game, but it failed in location testing. So anyway, um, you have to, uh, go through the game to find the different, um, musical instruments or a microphone.

2275
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:34,000
So you play each of the members of the band in these different levels to get their missing musical implement. And now turn this up.

2276
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:51,000
That's in the last level. Um, there's actually a cassette player in the machine, um, that, um, when you get to the last level, it'll play a looped version of separate ways, which is what was playing on there.

2277
01:39:51,000 --> 01:40:04,000
And the last level is that you have to keep fans from, uh, storming the stage and stealing the instruments again. And then of course, when they finally get past you, then, um, you have to go find the things again.

2278
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Um, there, there was another game that Journey was in. It was called Journey Escape for the Atari 2600. This was listed as number nine on the top ten worst licensed game ideas ever for, uh, Game Informer 2007.

2279
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Who doesn't know Dick, apparently, because Journey is awesome. Just saying. I want to see what this Journey Escape thing is. Yeah, Journey Escape. Here's from Emmanuel. You're on a boat with Journey. One of the world's hottest rock groups.

2280
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:57,000
A spectacular performance has just ended. Now it's up to you to guide each Journey band member past hordes of love-crazed groupies, sneaky photographers, and shifty-eyed promoters to the safety of the Journey Escape vehicle. And time to make it to the next concert. Your mighty manager and loyal roadies are there to help, but the escape is up to you.

2281
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Sounds like a ten to me. You have to make it to the Scarab Escape vehicle, the same one that's on the cover. I know, right? It was very different from the arcade game, so if you only played the 2600- The song Escape, though, ironically, is not in the game. But the intro is Don't Stop Believing. There you go. Alright. There it is, your classic game of the week journey. Oh, and by the way, the manager is the Kool-Aid man. What? Oh, the 2600 version?

2282
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:37,000
The manager, inexplicably depicted as the Kool-Aid man. Hey, Kool-Aid man! Oh yeah! Oh no! Naughty, naughty Kool-Aid.

2283
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Alright, we're gonna take a quick break here. It's been kind of a fun Part A tonight. I don't know what's in the air tonight here at OLR Studios, but we're having fun. I hope you guys are, too. Join our chat if you're not already there. Chat.orangelaungeready.com. We got plenty more coming up in Part B tonight. We got our rapid-fire news, and Loki already blew it, but we are gonna talk about the Big Macy's tour. We've got to talk about some of that.

2284
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Also, 1 vs. 100 got canned this week, so you know we gotta talk about that, because it's kind of sad. And yeah, man, there's a lot of stories here tonight that are just, like, bad ideas. This is not Good News Week, everybody. I'm sorry, but hopefully there'll be some good gems tonight.

2285
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Go ahead. To be fair, we're actually not talking about the Macy's tour so much. It's actually a lot. Other places. Oh, there's the Roadshow, too. Alright, we'll mention them both, I'm sure.

2286
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:42,000
And there is some good news, though, we're gonna talk about as well. Mega Man Universe we'll talk about a little bit when we come back, and we'll talk as well about a very, very classic Atari 2600 game getting updated for the new millennium. That should be kind of interesting.

2287
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:48,000
So we'll talk about all that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio. Don't go anywhere, we'll be right back.

2288
01:42:48,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Hello, everybody, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this July the 18th, 2010, where we are taping live at All Games Radio. We're moving into Part B of our show, and I gotta tell you, if you're just tuning in, we've had a pretty funny show so far. Lots of fun chatter in Part A. Just a lot of weird news. It's been a very weird week in gaming, and a lot of strange ideas going on out there.

2289
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:28,000
And the fun is gonna continue here in Part B. If you are just joining us, come into our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and have your say, because the big part of our show that makes our show unique is you.

2290
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:42,000
And your chats and your tweets that we're gonna get to in a minute, and all that good stuff. And I also wanna call this out, your awesome iTunes reviews, when you say nice things about us on the internet that make us feel warm and fuzzy. I wanna read one here in a minute, but I gotta pull it up.

2291
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:51,000
So in the meantime, let's get to some rapid fire news and things that happened throughout the week that we can mention in a few seconds.

2292
01:43:51,000 --> 01:44:14,000
The Expendables, a pretty awesome movie coming out this summer with a bunch of old action stars, is gonna be getting its own Facebook game, and it's very similar to Contra. And everybody loves Contra, and it kinda looks a little similar, I guess, because you can kill a bunch of people on a 2D platformer.

2293
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:25,000
But what you need to do is you just have to like the Expendables fan page in order to get access to the game. I don't know, you should like the movie. Looks awesome.

2294
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Sonic Colors is a new game from Sega coming out this fall, and GameStop has a wonderful pre-order bonus with that. You can get a Sonic the Hedgehog hat.

2295
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Yes, putting it on will make you that much closer to Sonic. And it's kinda neat looking, actually. Not enough for me to say pre-order the game.

2296
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Does it have like a blue spiky thing on it? Oh, it does! That's adorable.

2297
01:44:52,000 --> 01:45:03,000
It's very adorable. So yes, you can check that out, and of course the game is gonna be on Wii and DS sometime this fall, probably around November.

2298
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:16,000
And there is a new Oddworld game in the works being developed by the company Just Add Water. And they did a game called Gravity Crash.

2299
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:26,000
And apparently it's got the, there are multiple projects across multiple platforms starring all your favorite Oddworld characters.

2300
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:39,000
And they haven't said exactly when they're actually coming out, but you should just at least take solace that they are in the works at some point soon.

2301
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:42,000
We'll see some Oddworld games come back.

2302
01:45:42,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Alright, I got some quick stories for you guys. One of them is about Kid Icarus. Kid Icarus? I like Kid Icarus. This is some other news coming out about Kid Icarus Uprising. Of course that's the 3DS game that finally brings back Kid Icarus after not being around ever since that Game Boy game.

2303
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Apparently, in a chat with Games Master, this is a magazine in the UK, Mashahiro Sakurai, who is the game designer at Super Smash Brothers Brawl, says that the online capabilities are currently being tested.

2304
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:21,000
And by the way, yes, he made Brawl and he's making this game. He's saying the online capabilities are currently being tested.

2305
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:30,000
There could be some versus play, but we can't go into any detail. There are a lot of capabilities that expand on what was in the DS that people are taking advantage of.

2306
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Hmm, so it sounds like the online and versus and all that is being toyed with, but we don't know anything for sure just yet, but it's kind of cool because I don't know about you guys, but I just assumed it was like a one player only thing.

2307
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Also, apparently some Capcom games are going to be making their way to the Wii Virtual Console Arcade. Sometimes you forget that the Virtual Console has an arcade, but they're going to be getting some Capcom games in an announcement this week.

2308
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Among some other Capcom announcements, we'll get into it in a little bit. So that's going to be kind of cool, some old school Capcom games.

2309
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:18,000
A place where Capcom games would be welcomed would be Game Room, who saw the release of Fishing Derby, Barnstorming, and Quad Run all on the Atari 2600 this week, as well as the JIRUS for the arcade and Hover Force for the Intellivision.

2310
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Unfortunately, as awesome as it is to have JIRUS in Game Room, it was already on the Xbox Live Arcade, so it's probably the most awesome game that hit this week, but it already had a version released, so unfortunately Game Room didn't have a lot of win there.

2311
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:41,000
However, I will say one place where Game Room wins, and I mentioned this in part A, but I wanted to say this as well, it did have a little upgrade this week that they patched into the game some new little features.

2312
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Like now, if you've been playing a game for a long time, the other avatars will come up behind you and start watching you and applaud you when you finally lose, although I don't know why they applaud you when you lose.

2313
01:47:53,000 --> 01:48:08,000
And then like fireworks when you get a medal, and most importantly, live leaderboards. When you're playing in ranked mode, you see your position in the leaderboard in real time, and you watch yourself conquer, like who's in 900th place, then 800th place, then 700th.

2314
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:20,000
It's actually a really cool little addition, I thought that was neat. I was most excited as someone who's really tried to support Game Room and has sometimes been disappointed, but I'm really happy to see that they are doing updates, it makes me very hopeful for the future.

2315
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Now they just need some more licenses, like the Wii God with Capcom this week, that would be great. So we'll see. DarkSakura.

2316
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Well, something great coming out for iPhone will be Star Wars Battle for Hoth, especially good for fans of the Empire Strikes Back, right? Which people will arguably say is the best Star Trek movie, although I am personally a fan of Return of the Jedi, it's just me.

2317
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:51,000
I think A New Hope was the best one. I know, I'm weird.

2318
01:48:51,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Rob hurt my brain. Anyway, it's gonna be out for $2.99, and it's meant to celebrate the 30 year anniversary of the Empire Strikes Back. Pretty cool, huh?

2319
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:21,000
For Rock Band News, we have the Stooges and Bad Religion, the Stooges Pack 01, which total will be 440 Microsoft Points, or $5.49, includes $19.69, I Wanna Be Your Dog, and No Fun, each of those, well actually, $19.69 and No Fun will be 200 Wii Points a piece.

2320
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:31,000
I was wondering why it's only saying that one of them has a Microsoft Points list. Forget I said that. They're $19.99 a piece.

2321
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Individual songs coming out are both by Bad Religion, New Dark Ages, and No Control, each 160 Microsoft Points, or 200 Wii Points.

2322
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:53,000
And they will, of course, some of them being the Stooges Pack and No Control by Bad Religion will be in Lego Brock Band Store. I love Bad Religion. Gray band.

2323
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Alright, we're gonna get into this. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were done. My bad.

2324
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:58,000
I have three!

2325
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Ah, my bad.

2326
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Rob is ignoring me. I am being marginalized!

2327
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:08,000
I am multi-tasking, and I thought I heard three things.

2328
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:12,000
I'm being marginalized! Cause I'm a woman!

2329
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Yes, because you're a woman.

2330
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:25,000
I know. Anyway, um, now there is this really cool dude who has an even cooler, I would have to say, uh, I guess you're married by now, I don't know.

2331
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Um, but his name is Ray, is Ray Arafanto, who works for Xbox platform team, um, is getting married, or has gotten married, and his wedding ring is fantastic.

2332
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Um, it is a USB platinum wedding ring.

2333
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:53,000
And, um, and on it, it says, um, for a lifetime of memories.

2334
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Isn't that pun-tastic?

2335
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Is it actually like you could plug it in a USB slot with the ring?

2336
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:17,000
No, I don't need it. Actually, you know, I read though, um, Rob, I did read about another one, and I tried to find the pictures of it and I couldn't, about a couple that did have a USB wedding ring, a real USB wedding ring, and on it were, um, photos of their courtship.

2337
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Wow.

2338
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Yeah, that's why I would think, that's kind of what I thought of when you first talked about a USB wedding ring, like somebody's gonna plug one in.

2339
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Yeah, this one's just sort of cut into a USB-looking pattern.

2340
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:45,000
But, um, but no, I did actually find one, um, about a couple that actually did have the, their, uh, ring, their rings each were, uh, photos of their lives together, built into the ring.

2341
01:51:45,000 --> 01:52:08,000
You know, this whole, like, USB, and to some extent mini-USB, and that whole technology is really interesting, like, you know, um, you know those, like, MedicAlert bracelets they used to have back in the day, and they still do, that, like, you know, they're like silver, and they have little snakes, the very identifiable medical thing on it, and it's usually for people, like, who are diabetic, or allergic, or have some type of medical condition, whereas they ever become unconscious, you know, and have to have an ambulance called on them, the ambulance knows something about them.

2342
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
You know, they're putting that stuff on USB now.

2343
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
I'm actually planning on making one for myself.

2344
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:21,000
You see, like, these little, like, USB jewelry type things, and now it's, like, your whole medical records will be on there. Well, not, not your whole thing, but, you know, everything they need to know is there.

2345
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Well, see, that's actually a plan that I have, um, is getting one of those little, um, kind of rubber with the USB clasp, as it were.

2346
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Um, because, I mean, I had to repeat for the staff a couple of times that I'm allergic to penicillin, and amoxicillin, and the psyllins of the family, the mold, you know, and I was just thinking, what if I had fallen unconscious and had a bad infection, they tried to give me penicillin, you know.

2347
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:53,000
So, I think that those are fantastic ideas. I'm actually looking into the cost of just making it myself.

2348
01:52:53,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Either with a micro-USB or doing, um, a micro-SD, to have it embedded in there.

2349
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Uh, bonesis6, 006, bondsis6, there's two Zs, which makes it very strange to pronounce, bonesis6 in our chatroom says a USB dildo.

2350
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:20,000
You know, you could charge it, kind of like you do an iPhone. It's not outside the realm of possibility, I'm sure it's sadly been done.

2351
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:25,000
They have USB AA batteries, that can charge in the...

2352
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Salacious Pop says RFID would seem more intuitive, that's what they use for pets. I didn't even think about that, of course, like if a pet gets lost, that's all you'd need. Crazy.

2353
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Um, alright, we're gonna get into Twitter topics here real quick, but first, I mentioned I was gonna read this.

2354
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:45,000
We are so appreciative when people leave us nice reviews on iTunes, on our listing there, because it helps us spread the word about our show.

2355
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:53,000
This one was especially nice, so I wanted to read this real quick, because it's awesome. It's from HungryMrDrunk, is the name of the user.

2356
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
I know when I get drunk, I get hungry.

2357
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Uh, I have been a hardcore listener, lol, for years, and I can say that every Sunday I only think about running to my PSP to listen to this amazing podcast.

2358
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:08,000
I think it should be syndicated on the radio. After all, they are official game analysts under President Cat.

2359
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:13,000
They got me into music games like DDR and Guitar Hero, and because of them, I became a better gamer.

2360
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Thank you guys for the best eight years of my life.

2361
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Not to mention, we are the official podcast of the universe.

2362
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Actually, it's funny, he actually says in the title, why OLR is the best podcast in the galaxy.

2363
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Although technically it's the official video game podcast of the galaxy.

2364
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
But I like being called best too.

2365
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
It is nice, it's very nice.

2366
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
That was a very sweet thank you person.

2367
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Thank you HungryMrDrunk.

2368
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:38,000
HungryMrDrunk, you should come over and have a beer with me.

2369
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Yes, that's right, I hope you're next week.

2370
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,000
When I'm not on Vicodin.

2371
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Lots of Guinness and Cheetos.

2372
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Alright, let's get into Twitter topics.

2373
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Shall we move into Twitter topics? We shall.

2374
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,000
I guess.

2375
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,000
You guess?

2376
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
I guess.

2377
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Get a fan.

2378
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:56,000
I'm a god Rob, I'm a god.

2379
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
When did you last take a Vicodin?

2380
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
An hour ago.

2381
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
So during the show.

2382
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Yes, it is during the show.

2383
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,000
During the show.

2384
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Let's see.

2385
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Whatever.

2386
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Alright.

2387
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:14,000
You know, I figured out why it's affecting me very strongly.

2388
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Why is that?

2389
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Because keep in mind, I did one of those major detoxes when I went raw.

2390
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:23,000
I quit like almost every bit of medication.

2391
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:26,000
I didn't even take any pain medication or anything.

2392
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:31,000
And so it's hitting me harder than it really used to.

2393
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,000
It is.

2394
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Can I get to the Twitter topic?

2395
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Kitty!

2396
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Sorry.

2397
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:41,000
SSJ100Matt sent me this link. It has nothing to do with anything.

2398
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:44,000
This is why I really don't like to click on YouTubes during the show.

2399
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
But SSJ100Matt is kind of funny.

2400
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
And he sent this link and it's adorable.

2401
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
He says, this new game is coming to the Wii.

2402
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:57,000
And so this box comes up with nine little holes in it.

2403
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:00,000
And then little kitties come out of the holes.

2404
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Get bonked.

2405
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Oh my god, send that to me Rob.

2406
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,000
It's so adorable.

2407
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,000
It's in our chat.

2408
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Are you in chat?

2409
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,000
I'm in chat.

2410
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
SSJ100Matt just posted this.

2411
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
It's adorable.

2412
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
And so this makes for terrible radios.

2413
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
This is awful, terrible, horrible radio.

2414
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,000
I'll put it on Facebook.

2415
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Yeah, let's put it on Facebook.

2416
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Alright.

2417
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Can I get to Twitter topics already?

2418
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Alright.

2419
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

2420
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Follow us, ask us questions, we answer, da da da.

2421
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:31,000
DarkTattooia wants us to plug Retro Review.

2422
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Oh no, he says he's planning one.

2423
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
I don't think I saw it posted yet.

2424
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:38,000
But DarkTattooia does a lot of great work for the site, so thanks very much.

2425
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Let's see, Sturlok wants to give a shameless plug.

2426
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Is this turning into the shameless plug segment?

2427
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,000
I think it is.

2428
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Actually, I really like this article though, so I am going to let him have his shameless plug.

2429
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:50,000
He wrote an article for Geek-Life.com.

2430
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,000
That's us.

2431
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Geek Life.

2432
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:55,000
It's like all the O-L-R people are suddenly moving over there.

2433
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,000
You're defecting.

2434
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,000
No, that's okay.

2435
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:00,000
He actually made this story and I just linked it there in chat.

2436
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,000
It's GeekLife.com.

2437
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
It's called The Blind Gamer Perspective.

2438
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Because Sturlok is actually a blind gamer and you might think, like, how is that even possible?

2439
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
You can't see the sprites on the screen.

2440
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:17,000
But he actually explains it and talks about audio cues and how helpful it is when you have a role-playing game

2441
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
that tells you when you're running into walls.

2442
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Like, makes that bonk, bonk, bonk sound.

2443
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Like, you know, like some of the old Final Fantasy games do.

2444
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:26,000
I thought it was a neat article, so I approve.

2445
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Two thumbs up.

2446
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Tigerclaw gives us some links and one of them is kind of, well, they're both kind of sad, actually.

2447
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Let me read this first one here.

2448
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Starcraft 2 cost a hundred million to make.

2449
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Wow.

2450
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
That apparently is according to the Wall Street Journal.

2451
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Activision Blizzard spent a hundred million dollars on the three-part sequel.

2452
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Where did all that money go?

2453
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Oh, my God.

2454
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:57,000
I guess this game's going to be epic beyond epic.

2455
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Purely development and that has nothing to do with marketing.

2456
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,000
It exceeds Gran Turismo 5's 60 million development cost.

2457
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
They'll make it all bad.

2458
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
That's the sick part.

2459
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Let's see, also from Tigerclaw.

2460
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Killer gets two life sentences in an Xbox motivated murder.

2461
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:18,000
I hate stories like these because usually they have nothing, I mean, no offense to Tigerclaw

2462
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
because he's pulling it from a game blog.

2463
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:27,000
But I just, I hate that this stuff gets tied to gaming at all because it's just that this guy's just sick.

2464
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Some sicko killed people and it somehow involved an Xbox.

2465
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:39,000
His name is Kyle Sebastian Scott, 19 years old, and he killed a 22-year-old in January of last year.

2466
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:46,000
He hit his body in a ravine near a hiking trail in Colorado Springs.

2467
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Apparently he wanted the guy's Xbox and killed the guy.

2468
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Oh, this is even better.

2469
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Jason Holly, the victim, 22 years old, developmentally disabled.

2470
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
Terrible.

2471
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:01,000
And the judge said he trusted you, he would have given you anything, and he did.

2472
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:05,000
You could have taken the Xbox and he would have never told anybody.

2473
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
He was trying to be normal, a buddy, or one of the guys.

2474
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Two life sentences.

2475
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Not enough. Not enough.

2476
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Spazinator's sending us an update.

2477
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,000
Remember he called in last week to talk about his Sony woes?

2478
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Update, update.

2479
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Sony Computer Entertainment of America finally gave back my remaining 55 videos this past Monday.

2480
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Woo, that's a lot.

2481
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
Still rather pissed that it took so damn long.

2482
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:32,000
They actually called me as they were doing it so I could confirm if they had everything.

2483
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Well, that's kind of nice, I guess. At least they did that.

2484
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Jay Jugo on Twitter is listening to some old episodes of OLR. I guess this is a never forget kind of moment.

2485
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Hey guys, here's a funny flashback.

2486
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Procrastination is like masturbation.

2487
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:50,000
It feels good until you realize you fucked yourself.

2488
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Irene said that quote on your sixth episode.

2489
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Just wanted to share that flashback moment with you guys.

2490
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Keep up the great work.

2491
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Nice.

2492
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Old school OLR. They do exist out there.

2493
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
They're out there if you know where to look.

2494
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,000
The pictures are now finally on the website.

2495
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Apparently, well, my initial email bounced because apparently there's too many pictures attached.

2496
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
So now I'm sending them two at a time.

2497
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:18,000
So remember folks, if you're going to upload pictures to the website, do so in small quantities.

2498
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Because the email may not be able to handle it.

2499
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:24,000
But now you can see pictures of Baby Room and they're right there in the header of OrangetownsRudy.com.

2500
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Yes, they are up on top. In fact, I'm just waiting for the last two to refresh on here.

2501
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Take a look.

2502
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
And they're awesome.

2503
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:37,000
Actually, if you look at the gallery, you can see my progress of last week, which was not much progress.

2504
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Dark Tetsuya says, anyone be interested in an OLR game in the same style of the Journey coin-op?

2505
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
I've been wanting to do that for quite some time.

2506
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:51,000
That would be awesome if you could actually do it.

2507
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:54,000
That is no small programming feat.

2508
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
That would be cool.

2509
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Yes, of course. I'd love that.

2510
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
The Journey arcade game is rad.

2511
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,000
It's a classic game of the week now. It's official.

2512
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:08,000
And lastly, Retertainment. What nerd thing makes you think of an old TV show?

2513
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Mine is the red-green show after the duct tape iPhone 4 fix.

2514
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
That's a tough question.

2515
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
What nerd thing makes you think of an old TV show?

2516
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
I brought up Mr. Wizard yesterday.

2517
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Why did I bring up Mr. Wizard?

2518
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Because somebody then tried to say Mr. Wizard hated...

2519
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,000
That was me.

2520
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:29,000
What did I say in response to Mr. Wizard? I don't know.

2521
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:32,000
You said you thought he was dead.

2522
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
He is dead, isn't he?

2523
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,000
I don't know.

2524
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:38,000
I don't know. Forget it.

2525
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Mr. Wizard never really dies.

2526
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:44,000
You see, he's figured out a way to become one with the Force.

2527
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
He's just going to disappear into a robe.

2528
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Well, I just thought about Finders Keepers, thinking about the Xbox store earlier.

2529
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
So I guess it does happen once in a while when I think of old TV shows.

2530
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Is there something nerdy that makes you think of an old TV show?

2531
02:01:55,000 --> 02:02:01,000
The status of the gaming industry and the show Bonkers.

2532
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:05,000
I think that's pretty close there.

2533
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,000
A coworker said this to me the other day, and I like this.

2534
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:11,000
This really has nothing to do with gaming or nerd.

2535
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:18,000
But she said, you know, sometimes my life here feels like the dinosaurs TV show and that little baby.

2536
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Not the mama. Not the mama.

2537
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
I don't know. It's funny to me.

2538
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
That is pretty funny, Rob.

2539
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:28,000
Anything you want to add, Dark Soccer?

2540
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Well, I don't know. Usually I think about my job and all I can think about is...

2541
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:39,000
What was that?

2542
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Running Man.

2543
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Blade Runner?

2544
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
No, Running Man.

2545
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:51,000
One where he's trapped in a game show and to get out he has to escape.

2546
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Richard Dawson was the villain. That was awesome.

2547
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Yes, now I know.

2548
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
The best part about that movie.

2549
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Alright. Let's move on with some more news. Back to gaming news.

2550
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:08,000
That's almost as cool as Mega Race with Don Knotts or something I think was the villain in that.

2551
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Don Knotts was not in that, was he?

2552
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:15,000
There was somebody who was like Don Knotts in that game.

2553
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
In that game?

2554
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:20,000
It was weird. No, Don Knotts was not in the Running Man.

2555
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:26,000
That would have been even more epic. Don Knotts should have been one of the killers in the Running Man.

2556
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
That would have been cool.

2557
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Tigerclaw, by the way, says Mr. Wizard died in 2007. Don Herbert. Just so you know.

2558
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,000
In case you weren't aware, Mr. Wizard...

2559
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:36,000
And he hated kids.

2560
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
He did not hate kids.

2561
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Yes, he did.

2562
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:43,000
He loved kids as much as Mel Gibson loved his wife and daughter.

2563
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Alright, back to news stories.

2564
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Don't get me started. He's an ass-wife.

2565
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Don't even. Just pull back. Move along. Nothing to see here.

2566
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
That name is banned from the show.

2567
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
Move along. Nothing to see here.

2568
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Low-key, back to gaming.

2569
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:06,000
Mega Man Universe is apparently a game that's coming out on the Playstation Network and Xbox Live Arcade.

2570
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:11,000
They had a little teaser trailer that came out this week that featured absolutely no gameplay whatsoever.

2571
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:15,000
But it kind of gave us an idea of what we may expect.

2572
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Apparently, the game will actually combine universes in different Capcom game universes.

2573
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:37,000
The teaser trailer showed, at one point, a stop-motion animation of Ryu, Arthur, from the Ghosts and...

2574
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:41,000
I'm saying it the Western way, okay? The improper way.

2575
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
You're wrong!

2576
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Fine. Ryu and Arthur from the Ghosts and Ghouls and Ghosts and Goblins series.

2577
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
And, of course, Mega Man.

2578
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Facing off against a bunch of Mega Man villains.

2579
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:06,000
So either I'm guessing that Mega Man's going to get powers from these other players or the other game heroes.

2580
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Or he's going to be teaming up, I guess, with...

2581
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Kind of think of the Super Mario crossover, but the Super Capcom crossover with all these different characters from different series facing off against Mega Man characters.

2582
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Or, perhaps, facing off against Capcom universe characters.

2583
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Although, then you would wonder why it's called Mega Man universe and not Capcom universe.

2584
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Can I play this trailer? Because I haven't even seen this yet.

2585
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:38,000
I've been waiting until tonight's show to watch this.

2586
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
This is only about a minute or two, right?

2587
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:41,000
It's short.

2588
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Okay, so I've got to go into the studio right now.

2589
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Capcom! Yay, Capcom!

2590
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Bored down. Here we go.

2591
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Ooh, I approve of the music.

2592
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:59,000
Why is, like, some kid sleeping? That has nothing to do with Mega Man.

2593
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:03,000
It's Toy Story Mega Man.

2594
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Bored down.

2595
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:17,000
Oh, it's 20XX.

2596
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Man, there's something else I forgot at the very end that's kind of cool.

2597
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Cut man.

2598
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:29,000
I'm turning this down a little bit so I can talk for it.

2599
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Well, it looks cool. Too bad this is all, like, a pre-rendered thing that the actual game's not going to look like.

2600
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:37,000
It looks like stop-motion animation.

2601
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:40,000
Sweet!

2602
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:49,000
What?

2603
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:54,000
That little kid's probably on drugs.

2604
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,000
This is going to be, you know what this looks like to me?

2605
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Can I tell you what this honestly, like, I think right now?

2606
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:03,000
No, it looks like the Mega Man fighting game.

2607
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:08,000
But it's going to be like Capcom's own version of Capcom vs. Capcom.

2608
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:13,000
If that makes any sense. That's the first impression I get of what this is.

2609
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Wait a minute.

2610
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,000
He's also quite, like...

2611
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Watch this, this is awesome.

2612
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Okay.

2613
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:36,000
So he's still in bed. Mega Man universe.

2614
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Your world. Mega-fide.

2615
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:52,000
That's great.

2616
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
That was the old Mega Man box art guy?

2617
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Yeah.

2618
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:58,000
They're going to have the Mega Man box art Mega Man.

2619
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:59,000
I don't get it!

2620
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Suck man.

2621
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:07,000
I don't get it. I felt like that was a waste of two minutes of show.

2622
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
Welcome to any two minutes of this show.

2623
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
I don't know. Alpha-Can-Anagram, you asked me a question.

2624
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Why are they fighting only Mega Man bad guys, though?

2625
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
I don't know. I have no idea.

2626
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:16,000
It doesn't...

2627
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:21,000
I seriously think it's like one of those, like the Nintendo, the Super Mario crossover.

2628
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:22,000
It's going to be like that.

2629
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Why can't we just have Rockman power battles?

2630
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
Just do a new one of those.

2631
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Because that wasn't very good.

2632
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
I liked it.

2633
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:31,000
It's like one of the few games...

2634
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:34,000
The arcade version of it. That was so cool.

2635
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Alright.

2636
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:38,000
You just need to do a game just storing bass.

2637
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:44,000
What they need to do is they need to do a Mega Man game that's very similar to the upcoming Castlevania game.

2638
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:50,000
You know, with like 16 players at the same time fighting Mega Man characters.

2639
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Alpha-Can-Anagram says,

2640
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:56,000
Sky, imagine possibly Mega Man mixed with LittleBigPlanet with Mega Man powered up level editor.

2641
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Well, that sounds awesome, but I don't think that's what this is.

2642
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
If it is though, hey, it might be fun.

2643
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Actually, it might be a lot of fun.

2644
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
Is this only supposed to be download though?

2645
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Like it's a live arcade in PlayStation 3?

2646
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
Live arcade in PlayStation Network, yeah.

2647
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Alright.

2648
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Let's move on with some more stories.

2649
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:13,000
And this is something about something the Xbox is losing.

2650
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Microsoft cancelled 1 versus 100.

2651
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,000
That's right.

2652
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
There's not going to be a third season of 1 versus 100.

2653
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:21,000
This is confirmed with Xbox...

2654
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Sorry, Microsoft Game Studios General Manager Dave McCarthy saying,

2655
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:32,000
quote, we're very proud of the 1 versus 100 team and their accomplishments and are excited to apply what we've learned to future programming.

2656
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
And yep, it's on the Xbox.com.

2657
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
A fond farewell.

2658
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,000
That's it.

2659
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Aw, that sucks.

2660
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:43,000
They're going to have Mega Man foam Mega Busters or whatever at Comic Con they're giving away.

2661
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Do you not even care?

2662
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
The 1 versus 100 is gone?

2663
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:47,000
No, I don't care.

2664
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:48,000
All you can think about is Mega Man?

2665
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Ugh.

2666
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Never forget, there is something funny, Xbox Live Prime Time, whatever the fuck happened to that.

2667
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Well, that's my point.

2668
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
That stuff sounded so exciting.

2669
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:03,000
Hey, we're going to have the service that's going to blow away all the competition.

2670
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
And we're going to cancel it.

2671
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:11,000
It's going to make your Xbox Live Gold Account more worthwhile than just paying to play against other people.

2672
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:14,000
But it came down to where they couldn't get advertisers.

2673
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Yeah, that's the buzz I'm hearing too is that it was always a Sprint commercial.

2674
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
In a while you might see another one, but that was mostly it.

2675
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:23,000
So they just couldn't get the advertisers to give away the prizes.

2676
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:24,000
But you know what, I think there would be...

2677
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Call me crazy.

2678
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:30,000
But I think there would be a lot of people that would still play the game, not even for prizes.

2679
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:35,000
I mean, when you went into the non-live rounds, which didn't give away anything but points really,

2680
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:38,000
and supposedly more of a chance to play in the live rounds,

2681
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:42,000
there would still be like 10-20,000 people on at any time.

2682
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:45,000
I mean, you can't tell me that stuff is that expensive to run.

2683
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Really?

2684
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
I mean, I guess they have a question writing staff.

2685
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:52,000
And why can't you get advertisers? I see advertisers for stuff all the time.

2686
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Like, there's different movies that they're promoting on there.

2687
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
There's different stuff.

2688
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Where's Axe Body Spray?

2689
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Just do a crossover. Get the Old Spice guy in there.

2690
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Mountain Dew.

2691
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Old Spice is very up on the new technology stuff. Get him in there.

2692
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
That last marketing campaign was brilliant.

2693
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
Brilliant. Who doesn't love that guy?

2694
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:13,000
My favorite thing, I'm on a horse.

2695
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Did you see all the YouTube videos?

2696
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:15,000
I didn't see the new ones, yeah.

2697
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
Oh, you got to see the marriage proposal. That's the best one.

2698
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Monty Boggs in our chat room says,

2699
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:22,000
Microsoft always promises cool stuff to live and then never does it

2700
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
when they realize it requires work.

2701
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:32,000
You know, it's just disappointing because they didn't really announce what is next.

2702
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:35,000
I think that would soften the blow a little bit if they were like,

2703
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:38,000
well, sadly we're losing 1 versus 100 because, you know, licensing,

2704
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:41,000
they're going to make it a real show again, which by the way is also a rumor

2705
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:44,000
that 1 versus 100 is actually coming back to TV

2706
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
because of the success of Xbox.

2707
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Weird, right?

2708
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
I know, right? I don't think it'll be the same thing.

2709
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
It's not going to be Bob Saget and NBC.

2710
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
I'm thinking like Game Show Network.

2711
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:57,000
I actually, I read blogs about game shows. Leave me alone.

2712
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Hey, Rob, that's one of the reasons we love you.

2713
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
I know.

2714
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:03,000
I just, I don't know.

2715
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:06,000
But if they'd come out and said, okay, we're canceling 1 versus 100,

2716
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:10,000
but we are bringing you, I don't know, The Price is Right

2717
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:15,000
or Family Feud or hell, Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy, anything.

2718
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
I can play The Price is Right.

2719
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
People would be excited about that.

2720
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
And I don't even think you have to give away prizes.

2721
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Give away E-peen and people will still line up.

2722
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Give away achievements. Give away shout-outs on websites, leaderboards.

2723
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
People will play for E-peen.

2724
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Here's the opportunity now.

2725
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:36,000
Make something very similar to, say, PlayStation Home

2726
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
and you can have the prizes in your living room.

2727
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Hey, look at this virtual.

2728
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Oh, my God, why aren't you working for Microsoft?

2729
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
That's brilliant.

2730
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Brilliant.

2731
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:51,000
Win avatar items and themes and cool stuff.

2732
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
You could do it.

2733
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:56,000
You don't have to give away a free game or points.

2734
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:59,000
I want a free game and points and a car.

2735
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Well, I mean, you know, that's nice.

2736
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Maybe give that away to, like, the season-long winner

2737
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:07,000
and it won't cost as much out of the prize budget.

2738
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:10,000
AJ Mix in our chat room. Double Dare featuring Natal.

2739
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Why aren't you people working for Microsoft?

2740
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:15,000
These are brilliant ideas. Brilliant.

2741
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Won't happen.

2742
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:22,000
I don't know. Here's a thought. Make up your own game show.

2743
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:26,000
You know, get somebody out there who's got to be creating these game shows.

2744
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:29,000
Hire him. Make your own damn game show.

2745
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Make a new Xbox Live game show.

2746
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Yeah, I'd love that idea.

2747
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:38,000
You could maybe even, like, broadcast some stuff on MSNBC or something.

2748
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Or, you know, one of the companies that you own.

2749
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Fucking stream it on the internet. Have, like, uh...

2750
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Have something. I don't know.

2751
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
I love this. Monty Boggs.

2752
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
Are you smarter than a fifth grader?

2753
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Were all the little kids in Halo are the fifth graders?

2754
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:57,000
You know, there is a fifth grader game on Xbox Live.

2755
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Are you smarter than a fifth grader?

2756
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
It's on all the systems, I think.

2757
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
But it's not, you know, interactive.

2758
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:06,000
I was really excited about Xbox Prime Time.

2759
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
And it's really disappointing that it's just like,

2760
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Eh, well, you know, it didn't work. Bye.

2761
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
So I really hope they come out and say,

2762
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Yes, we've been working on another project and it's still part of Xbox Prime Time.

2763
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:22,000
But it makes me nervous when they come out at E3 and don't say a damn thing about it.

2764
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
That should have been the sign right there.

2765
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
They didn't say a damn thing about it at E3.

2766
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
It wasn't like, Oh, you hope you liked 1 vs. 100.

2767
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Or, you know, but now we're going to bring you Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune!

2768
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
Or something like that.

2769
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Well, you know, Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune! games were being shown off on the Wii.

2770
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Somewhere else.

2771
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:42,000
Yep, I know there's Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune! games coming up this year.

2772
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:45,000
Actually, the Wii's been getting a lot of those game shows.

2773
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
They have The Price is Right and Press Your Luck.

2774
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
The Wii's the place for game shows right now.

2775
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
It's not live and interactive.

2776
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Oh my god, think of the possibilities.

2777
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
Rob, don't cry.

2778
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
I'm just...

2779
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
It's just...

2780
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
What the fuck are they smoking?

2781
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
I don't know.

2782
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:08,000
You can buy PlayStation Plus and maybe you'll get to pay somebody else to watch Hulu.

2783
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
What's it going to...

2784
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
They don't make any sense.

2785
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
They do not.

2786
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
When are the good ideas going to stick?

2787
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
They just couldn't make money off of 1 vs. 100.

2788
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:22,000
They weren't making enough in advertising to just buy PlayStation Plus.

2789
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
I bet they could have charged...

2790
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Well, they're making the money off Xbox Gold.

2791
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:30,000
They're making the money off Xbox Gold, subscribers.

2792
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
There's other ways they could do it.

2793
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:37,000
I don't believe the subscribers were giving them that much money.

2794
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
It's about selling.

2795
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
I know people who bought it at Xbox just to play that game.

2796
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
They've got to be pissed.

2797
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
They make the money back in other ways.

2798
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
It's dumb. Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.

2799
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Yeah, but that's a different reason to buy an Xbox, too, if you ask me.

2800
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Yeah, but that's a different reason to buy an Xbox, too, if you ask me.

2801
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
So she just pops in chat and says,

2802
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Rob wants a Big Brother port for Wii with a throttle-that-bitch Wiimote mechanic.

2803
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:05,000
I would totally play Survivor on Xbox Live if it was, like, somehow real.

2804
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
What?

2805
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
There's a Survivor game coming out on the Wii.

2806
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
It's going to be stupid.

2807
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
It's not going to be online or anything.

2808
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
It's going to be like the horrible PC games that were out.

2809
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
At least the PC games.

2810
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
I think one of the PC games you could actually play on the internet.

2811
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:22,000
Probably it's going to be a port of the PC game.

2812
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Dumb, dumb, dumb.

2813
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Well, the last PC game came out a long time ago.

2814
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Yeah, that'll probably be a port of the PC game.

2815
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Alright, let's move on.

2816
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:33,000
That's frightening.

2817
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Moving on, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

2818
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Well, there is some stuff.

2819
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:45,000
As soon as my, you know, system decides to stop being crappy.

2820
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:49,000
I was also, you know, completely enamored with the whack-a-kitty.

2821
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:53,000
Thank you, SSJ100Matt, for completely derailing the show.

2822
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
We appreciate you.

2823
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
With your cute kittens.

2824
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
No, because my thing-okay, there it is.

2825
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:04,000
I'm sorry. Well, actually, what was going on was that my window decided to hide itself.

2826
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Yay.

2827
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:08,000
And my brain is broken. Doesn't work.

2828
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Anyway, how about some news about poor, poor Nintendo?

2829
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Can we have some sad music, Rob?

2830
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Some sad music?

2831
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Well, you didn't request this in advance.

2832
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
Well, how about just break out a kazoo?

2833
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Hold on, hold on.

2834
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:32,000
It's because I feel for them.

2835
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Sad music, you got it. Here we go.

2836
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Some sad music for Jamie's story.

2837
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Sigh.

2838
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:46,000
There's an announcement made by the Nintendo UK General Manager.

2839
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
His name is David Yarnton.

2840
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:54,000
That demand for the Wii and the DS has declined.

2841
02:17:54,000 --> 02:18:06,000
He blamed the falling demand for the Wii and DS on the, quote, cycle.

2842
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:10,000
And the recession in saying everybody's in the same boat.

2843
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:14,000
We are not recession proof, he says.

2844
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:18,000
We've probably, as an industry, been better than other industries.

2845
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:23,000
We thought we would be selling more, but we're not, pretty much.

2846
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:29,000
Um, yeah, that's really not the case of worlds in the world so much.

2847
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:32,000
But there's light, Rob, there's light at the end of the tunnel.

2848
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:35,000
We're waiting on the 3DS.

2849
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
That's what they're saying.

2850
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
We had to let that go.

2851
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:52,000
Yeah, they're waiting on the 3DS because you don't need glasses.

2852
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:57,000
Um, and he also, though, denied that Nintendo has been forced to slash prices.

2853
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
But, um, yeah.

2854
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Alas, Nintendo. Alas.

2855
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:15,000
I can't help ending up here drinking ginger ale.

2856
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
What?

2857
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:23,000
Just your perfect cap to destroy, alas, Nintendo.

2858
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
What is wrong with you?

2859
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:39,000
Salacious pop in our chatroom says, now I'm imagining Reggie in tears floating on a wooden plank saying, never let go, Wii. Never let go.

2860
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
And then one of his thumbs break off.

2861
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
Uh, yeah.

2862
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Uh, yeah.

2863
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
Uh, the kinectix-

2864
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:56,000
No, no, no, no, guys, I got, I got, um, I got some, uh, advice here for Nintendo.

2865
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Um, here you go, Nintendo, I have some advice for you, okay?

2866
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Keep holding on, cause you know I'll make it through, I'll make it through. Just stay strong, cause you know I'm here for you, I'm here for you. There's nothing you can say.

2867
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Sorry about that. You just took it too far there. Yeah, I did. You went too far.

2868
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:31,000
Yep. Let the, let the-

2869
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Should've just let it. Yeah, should've just left it with that, I know, I know.

2870
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:37,000
Sequels are never as good as the original, they're really not.

2871
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
I hear that Titanic 2's gonna be awesome, though.

2872
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Um, kinectix-

2873
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Three more hours of the ship sinking.

2874
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:47,000
The ship sinks again.

2875
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:52,000
You think it sunk and everyone died. They really went to a magical town under the water.

2876
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:57,000
We found it! It's Titanic Atlantis!

2877
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:05,000
Atlantastic? Oh, I can do it.

2878
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:21,000
Um, anyways, uh, the kinectix experience tour, coming to your town soon, um, they are traveling around the country, um, on the east coast and on the west coast, showing off a bunch of different kinect games including kinectimals, kinect sports, kinect joyride, kinect adventures,

2879
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:25,000
and Dance Central, the only game without kinect in the title.

2880
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:33,000
And, um, they will be doing this, um, very close until launch of the actual kinect on November 4th.

2881
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:45,000
So, some notable east coast, uh, locations, let's see, um, actually starting earlier of this, or, well, uh, yesterday and today, they were at Macy's!

2882
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:50,000
You probably didn't see them because they were at Macy's, so, but if you-

2883
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
I like Macy's!

2884
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:55,000
If you just happened to go there, then you might have seen it.

2885
02:21:55,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Um, some other notable places, uh, August 4th through the 6th, they're going to be in Canton, Ohio at the Football Hall of Fame Rib Burn-Off.

2886
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Okay, well that makes sense, Football Hall of Fame, okay, that seems to be a good place to go, alright.

2887
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Okay, um, let's see, October, was it, uh, October 1st and 2nd, Orlando, Florida, the Disney Wine and Dine Marathon.

2888
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Disney has a wine and dine marathon? Is that like the wine thing they do at California Adventure?

2889
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:37,000
No, I think that's, like, remember how Disney in, um, Orlando has a lot of those fancy adult places where you can go taste wine in fancy restaurants and shit like that?

2890
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Okay.

2891
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:45,000
Yeah, there. Um, and then October 4th, 14th and the 17th, or through the 17th, uh, you can check it out at the Texas State Fair.

2892
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Or, October 21st through the 24th at the Louisiana State Fair.

2893
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:53,000
Uh, what other state fairs are they going to be hitting up as well?

2894
02:22:53,000 --> 02:23:00,000
Uh, Minnesota State Fair, Tennessee State Fair, uh, I know the California State Fair.

2895
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:05,000
Oh, my, I was going to say, really, because I'm like, the California State Fair is going on right now here in lovely Sacramento.

2896
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Are they going to be there, really?

2897
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:11,000
Yes, July 28th through August 1st at the California State Fair. Almost worth going.

2898
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Almost. Almost worth going and getting subjected to getting shot by a gang. Almost.

2899
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:20,000
Uh, also.

2900
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:28,000
There's two things you can count on at the California State Fair. The smell of animal poop and gang shootings. Every year.

2901
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:37,000
You know, this is a surprise to me, but I never knew that Minnesota was on the west coast, but apparently they're going to be at the Mall of America from July 15th to August 22nd.

2902
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:41,000
That's a pretty long-ass time there. So, Mall of America, that's your place to go.

2903
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:45,000
You'd think they'd have the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America.

2904
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:58,000
Exactly. Um, what other state fair? Colorado State Fair, Utah State Fair, New Mexico State Fair. They're going to be at the Universal City Walk on September 24th through 26th.

2905
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:05,000
And, uh, October 7th through the 11th, San Francisco Fleet Week.

2906
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:10,000
And, uh, oh, the Arizona State Fair.

2907
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:20,000
So, yes, a bunch of different dates. They have it, actually. Um, you can check it out on, um, Facebook. Facebook.com slash connect or the Gamerscore blog.

2908
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Uh, they've got the dates posted there as well, or a lot of the gaming sites, too, in case you're interested in checking it out.

2909
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:33,000
I might be interested in checking out the state fair, but, my God, it's a state fair and I have to go there and it's hot outside.

2910
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:34,000
It's hot.

2911
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:35,000
It's so hot.

2912
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:36,000
It is. It's hot.

2913
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:39,000
And, seriously, the state fair sucks.

2914
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:44,000
Slacious Pop in chat is asking me, can we go this weekend and get deep fried foods and ride on Spin-A-Hurl rides?

2915
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:49,000
And I'm like, honestly, my first reaction is like, no.

2916
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:53,000
No, we can't. I don't know. I, the state fair is okay.

2917
02:24:53,000 --> 02:25:00,000
It might be neat to check out, but, honestly, um, Dance Central will be the only game I might be kind of interested in checking out, but.

2918
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:05,000
How, how would you go? There's no way in hell you're going to be able to take the wife to the state fair. It's way too hot out.

2919
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
I'll just convince the coworkers to go.

2920
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Oh, okay.

2921
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:09,000
That's where I'd go myself.

2922
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
I'll go with you, I guess.

2923
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
I'm not going, dude. Okay, let me put it this way.

2924
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:16,000
Let's break this down here. July 28th through August 1st.

2925
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:21,000
There is a good percentage chance that the baby will be here by then.

2926
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:22,000
I will not be going anywhere.

2927
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
You're going to be too busy changing poopy diapers.

2928
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:29,000
Jamie, save a Vicodin and then take it and we'll go.

2929
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:32,000
If you pay for me to get in, I'll go.

2930
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:33,000
Maybe.

2931
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:34,000
Okay.

2932
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:37,000
Do we still have OLR funds? Maybe the show can pay for us.

2933
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:40,000
Um, yeah, it's sitting right there on top of.

2934
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
We're on assignment. Alright, fine.

2935
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:43,000
Rob.

2936
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:48,000
What? And apparently Alan wants to go, so we could maybe do it next weekend. I can't go this weekend.

2937
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
Well, next weekend I've got plans on Sunday.

2938
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:53,000
But Saturday, Saturday afternoon, I don't.

2939
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
July 28th through the August 1st.

2940
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:56,000
Is next weekend, right?

2941
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
We need to go on August 1st. You know why?

2942
02:25:58,000 --> 02:25:59,000
Why?

2943
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Because that's the last day of the fair and it's weird Al.

2944
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:08,000
Uh, that's, it's, it's a week from next week from this upcoming weekend.

2945
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
So August 1st is what, a Sunday?

2946
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:11,000
It would be.

2947
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:12,000
We have a show that night.

2948
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:13,000
Uh, yeah, Sunday.

2949
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:14,000
We have a show that night.

2950
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Well, it's the 28th though, that's like.

2951
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:19,000
A show live from the state fair, is it possible?

2952
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:20,000
Maybe.

2953
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:21,000
No.

2954
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:22,000
I don't think it is.

2955
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
We can just record, ring the, I found the little recorder.

2956
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:27,000
It's like, it's state fair, it's hot.

2957
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Look, there's a lot of things that I would call off a show for.

2958
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
I've called off a show to go to Disneyland.

2959
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:37,000
I've called off a show to go to various expos.

2960
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:40,000
I would not call off a show to go to the freaking state fair.

2961
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Like, I just, it's just.

2962
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
It's just too tacky.

2963
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:47,000
I've gone to, um, what was it?

2964
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:51,000
It was a, I don't remember what the fair was.

2965
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:58,000
It was some sort of like rib cook-off and like country music fair thing that was down

2966
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:02,000
by a Rayleigh Field to see rock band two.

2967
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:03,000
And I did that one time.

2968
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:06,000
I saw rock band at the state fair actually a couple of years ago.

2969
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:07,000
Yeah.

2970
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:08,000
Yeah.

2971
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:13,000
Was that, that was the same night that I broke up with that asshole.

2972
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
That was the same night.

2973
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Oh my God.

2974
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Wow, this show took a tumble.

2975
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
Where's sad trombone?

2976
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Hey, next story.

2977
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Something a lot happier than horrible experiences at the state fair.

2978
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
I saw a guy land on his head.

2979
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Hopefully, hopefully this won't be the same experience.

2980
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:39,000
A haunted house.

2981
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:43,000
This is an old ass Atari 2600 game.

2982
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:47,000
An old ass Atari 2600 game that was out many years ago.

2983
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
It's actually out on game room now if you want to re-experience it.

2984
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:52,000
They call it the original survival horror game.

2985
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:53,000
Not really.

2986
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:54,000
No.

2987
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:55,000
No.

2988
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:59,000
Basically you like could hit a button and make things illuminate around you and sometimes

2989
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:02,000
scary things would show up like spiders and stuff.

2990
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
But you were trying to collect things.

2991
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:09,000
Well, they are completely revamping this game and it's coming out for the Wii, Xbox Live

2992
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
Arcade and PC.

2993
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:16,000
It's being developed by Imagine Engine who's a kids game designer.

2994
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:20,000
And it's actually about the original character's grandkids going back to the haunted house

2995
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
and it's basically kind of a very similar plot.

2996
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:26,000
And I got to admit, looking at the graphics it looks very kid-ish.

2997
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:33,000
But I guess it's kind of cool that they're bringing out the old games and making new ones.

2998
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:38,000
I hope there's some other old ass Atari games that they maybe do this to.

2999
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:39,000
But I don't know.

3000
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
Maybe this is one of those games you might fire up once and go,

3001
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:42,000
Oh, that's cute.

3002
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:43,000
And then probably never play again.

3003
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
Uh, they're actually...

3004
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
Are there other ones they're talking about?

3005
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:48,000
There's supposed to be other ones.

3006
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:51,000
I thought I had heard something about that there were other games they were thinking about.

3007
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
Centipede.

3008
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:54,000
Really?

3009
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:55,000
Yeah, I saw a game for Centipede.

3010
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:56,000
I'm like, really?

3011
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:57,000
Hmm.

3012
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:58,000
What the hell are they going to do with Centipede?

3013
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
I think this is not Frogger.

3014
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Human Centipede?

3015
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:04,000
No, it's not Human Centipede.

3016
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:05,000
Um, there was another one too.

3017
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
I don't remember what it was.

3018
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:11,000
But Centipede was one of the games.

3019
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:15,000
It was also leaked out on Gamefly.

3020
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:16,000
They had it.

3021
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:20,000
Because everyone trusts Gamefly over me.

3022
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Sad days.

3023
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:27,000
Alright, I think we need to move on with our show and get into the mailbag.

3024
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:37,000
Every week you guys send us emails and we read them here on the program to our much amusement.

3025
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com and we're going to answer your questions that you've emailed us.

3026
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com.

3027
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Sometimes you guys share funny stories and things of that sort.

3028
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
So, let's get to it.

3029
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:49,000
Dark Soccer is going to read some emails.

3030
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:54,000
Um, we've got three to go through and I'm going to start with the shortest of them first.

3031
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:58,000
Well, kind of the second shortest but the other one's got some stuff.

3032
02:29:58,000 --> 02:29:59,000
Hey, OLR!

3033
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
Pliskin here to ask a few questions.

3034
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:06,000
First, if you could be in any video game, which would it be and why?

3035
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:13,000
Um, if I had to, I'd be in Sims 3 so that I could have an infinity code so that I'd never get hungry.

3036
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
Um, I could never age.

3037
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Never.

3038
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:22,000
And I could decide how hot the person I want to look like and everything.

3039
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:31,000
I would be in Animal Crossing so I could get rewarded with refrigerators and dressers and radios for running people's mail to the post office.

3040
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
Loki.

3041
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:40,000
Um, I don't know.

3042
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
I wouldn't really want to be in any game.

3043
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:45,000
Mega Man Universe because that looks retarded.

3044
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
I don't know. I don't have a good answer.

3045
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:48,000
I'd also want to be-

3046
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:51,000
I know, Totem Ball because it is such an awesome game.

3047
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
But you were in Totem Ball!

3048
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:58,000
Oh my god! Mind blown!

3049
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Second, I know you guys bash-

3050
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Wait, wait, wait. I'd also want to be in Pokemon.

3051
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:03,000
Just saying.

3052
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Okay.

3053
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
Score it all. Score it all.

3054
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:15,000
Second, I know you guys bash on Facebook Gaming, but believe it or not, there are some fun games on Facebook like My Hero's Ability and thousands of poker games.

3055
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:16,000
So my question is what gives?

3056
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:20,000
As in, maybe you're into those games, but I don't think we are.

3057
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:23,000
I don't hate all Facebook games. Jamie, you admitted to playing one.

3058
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:29,000
I played Farmville for like a week, okay? A moment of weakness. It was dumb. I was young and naive.

3059
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
I think I played Bejeweled Blitz once.

3060
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:32,000
Yeah, Bejeweled Blitz is cool.

3061
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:40,000
Um, I don't hate on Facebook games a lot. I mean, I think the whole social networking gaming thing is kind of retarded.

3062
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
And that's kind of stupid. It sounds like an old man saying,

3063
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:52,000
Oh, get your fancy electronic shit. Um, but no, it's really, I don't understand what the point is. Like, hey, look, you know, hey, I sent you unicorn. Send me something.

3064
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:58,000
I hate it when people send me shit in Facebook. I delete it. I do not forward anything.

3065
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:05,000
I think that's it. It's not Facebook games we hate. It's Facebook games spam that we hate.

3066
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:09,000
I'm all for free games. I just don't like the spam.

3067
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:18,000
Yeah, that's annoying. Um, it's like those seriously, those chain mails where it's like, oh, send it to five of your friends and lucky things will happen to you.

3068
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:26,000
Um, so I don't hate that. Oh, God, I had a point, but I totally forgot it was in arguing about how Facebook games are.

3069
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Um, oh, what was it? Oh, my hero's ability. Um, or whatever. That reminds me of like that Stephen Lynch song, Superhero, where he starts like naming off, you know, superheroes.

3070
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
It kind of sounds like Pokemon.

3071
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:46,000
Um, Monty Boggs, by the way, is also answering that question about what video game would you want to be in in our chat room at chat.orangehonstray.com.

3072
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:52,000
I would want to be in Deal or No Deal. Constant money. There's a Deal or No Deal Facebook game.

3073
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:56,000
I think that's the most pointless freaking game in the entire world.

3074
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
I think they're all relatively pointless.

3075
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:03,000
Guess the number, but like Deal or No Deal, especially. Guess the number. That's what it is.

3076
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:06,000
But Rob, it's Howie Mandel. How can you go wrong there?

3077
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Don't get me started.

3078
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:09,000
It's Howie.

3079
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:10,000
Is there more to the email?

3080
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
Yes, there is.

3081
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
Yes, all right.

3082
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
Stupid, stupid Facebook.

3083
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:19,000
I am looking forward very much to the Civilization game on Facebook.

3084
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
Because you're a Sith whore.

3085
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:22,000
I am.

3086
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:23,000
And how.

3087
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:26,000
And how, and I can't wait to Sith whore it up with my friends on Facebook. Yay!

3088
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:27,000
More!

3089
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
Third is for Loki.

3090
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:33,000
You know, I'm trying really not to be so grammar crazy and eh.

3091
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
But.

3092
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:36,000
This sucks.

3093
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
Third is for Loki.

3094
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
I found a PSP 1000.

3095
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
I've owned a PSP 1000 for almost a year.

3096
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:45,000
And now all of a sudden the D-Pad is freaking out.

3097
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:49,000
All I want to do is go right dot dot dot.

3098
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:50,000
I used an ellipse okay.

3099
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
All by itself.

3100
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:57,000
Now this wouldn't bother me, but it gives me vertigo when playing Dissidia Final Fantasy.

3101
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Cause the D-Pad controls the camera.

3102
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:05,000
My question is can this be fixed or do I have to shell out money to be a new one?

3103
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
To be a new one.

3104
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:08,000
You want to be a D-Pad when you grow up.

3105
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
Well we know what video game he wants to be in.

3106
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:11,000
Um.

3107
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:12,000
Yeah it can be fixed.

3108
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:16,000
Because the D-Pad is actually on what they call a ribbon bus cable.

3109
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
Which you cannot solder to unfortunately.

3110
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:19,000
I've tried.

3111
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:20,000
And it breaks it.

3112
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:21,000
Um.

3113
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:24,000
But all you have to do is buy the replacement ribbon bus cable.

3114
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
Assuming that that's what's wrong with it.

3115
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:31,000
So probably there's like a kink or something where something broke and so now it's just being held down.

3116
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:32,000
It could be dirty.

3117
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:33,000
You never know.

3118
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:34,000
Um.

3119
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
Basically you just have to bust the system open.

3120
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:37,000
Um.

3121
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
And possibly replace that.

3122
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:40,000
Which those aren't that expensive.

3123
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:43,000
You can probably get a set of ribbon bus cables for.

3124
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:47,000
I think I bought one for ten to twenty dollars.

3125
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:48,000
Maybe.

3126
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:49,000
It should be really cheap.

3127
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
Probably under fifteen dollars.

3128
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:52,000
Um.

3129
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:56,000
So that's all you need to do and you just slide it in there and put it all back together.

3130
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
And it should work.

3131
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:01,000
No guarantees though because I don't know if that's exactly what's wrong.

3132
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:02,000
It could also be.

3133
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:03,000
Um.

3134
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:06,000
There could be some sort of bridging going on somewhere else in there.

3135
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:07,000
Um.

3136
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:11,000
It's hard to say until you bust it open and see what actually is broken in there.

3137
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:12,000
But.

3138
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:13,000
If it's.

3139
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
If it's the actual D-Pad sticking.

3140
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Like the controller button is actually sticking down.

3141
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
It's probably dirty and you just need to clean it out.

3142
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:26,000
I've seen some friends with PSP's that I've fixed for them that are fucking disgusting.

3143
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:29,000
There's just the amount of dirt and grime that's on it.

3144
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:30,000
I just like.

3145
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:31,000
What do you do?

3146
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
Do you like seriously sweat grease?

3147
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:36,000
I mean or sweat like.

3148
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Axle grease or something.

3149
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
It's ridiculous the amount of dirt that's on there.

3150
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:40,000
But yeah.

3151
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:41,000
Cleaning.

3152
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:42,000
Cleaning your PSP.

3153
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:43,000
Try that at first.

3154
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:46,000
If that still doesn't work then you may need to replace that ribbon bus cable.

3155
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:49,000
If that doesn't work you're probably going to need a PSP.

3156
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Um.

3157
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:53,000
I kind of agree with Legend of Zaku in our chat room.

3158
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:56,000
PSP's D-Pad in general is ass.

3159
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
They're better than the.

3160
02:35:58,000 --> 02:35:59,000
Um.

3161
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:00,000
You know.

3162
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
They're better than the Xbox 360 D-Pad.

3163
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:03,000
Exactly.

3164
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:04,000
That's for sure.

3165
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:05,000
Alright.

3166
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:09,000
You guys are being mean to the poor Xbox.

3167
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:10,000
What else is new tonight?

3168
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:11,000
Alright.

3169
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
Was that it for that email or is there more?

3170
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Um.

3171
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:15,000
Final question is for Rob.

3172
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:18,000
How would I go about coming out to my family?

3173
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:19,000
Wow.

3174
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:20,000
Uh.

3175
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:21,000
Wow.

3176
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:24,000
That's a bit of a tangent.

3177
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:25,000
Um.

3178
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:26,000
I.

3179
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:27,000
Okay.

3180
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:28,000
I'm a big fan of skywriting.

3181
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
I can offer a resource.

3182
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:31,000
Yes.

3183
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:32,000
Please.

3184
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:33,000
Um.

3185
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:34,000
The um.

3186
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:35,000
Human rights.

3187
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:36,000
Um.

3188
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:37,000
What's the name of the.

3189
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:38,000
Their equality thing.

3190
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:39,000
The human.

3191
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
They've got the store in San Francisco.

3192
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:42,000
Human rights campaign.

3193
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:43,000
Thank you.

3194
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:49,000
The human rights campaign has actually brochures and free material up on their website if you

3195
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:54,000
do want to actually have something in writing, you know, by a psychologist and stuff.

3196
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
So they do have resources there.

3197
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:57,000
Uh.

3198
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:58,000
Okay.

3199
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:01,000
How do I tackle this question without taking 30 minutes?

3200
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:02,000
Um.

3201
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:03,000
Okay.

3202
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:06,000
First off, if you need additional advice, send me a personal email.

3203
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:07,000
Rob at orangehonestrager.com.

3204
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
I'll address this off the air.

3205
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:10,000
Um.

3206
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:11,000
Because I really don't know anything about this listener.

3207
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:12,000
I don't know how old you are.

3208
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:13,000
I don't know what you're like.

3209
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:16,000
If you have a hostile family situation or what's going on.

3210
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:20,000
Cause I think different situations necessitate different responses.

3211
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:21,000
Um.

3212
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:25,000
I know there's a lot of push out there that say like, you know, come out, come out wherever

3213
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:26,000
you are and all this stuff.

3214
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:30,000
But I, I completely understand that sometimes that is not necessarily the answer.

3215
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:31,000
Um.

3216
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
At the end of the day, who you have in your bedroom is your business.

3217
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:34,000
Um.

3218
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
And I understand your desire to tell your family that.

3219
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:40,000
And I think, you know, if you have that type of family, you should tell them that that's

3220
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:41,000
going to be supportive and loving.

3221
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:42,000
Um.

3222
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
But there are sometimes some, some sticky situations.

3223
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:47,000
So I don't know your family background or what have you.

3224
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:54,000
My advice would be tell your best friend because your best friend will always be there for

3225
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:55,000
you no matter what.

3226
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:58,000
And if they run away because you tell them this, then they're not really your friend

3227
02:37:58,000 --> 02:37:59,000
to begin with.

3228
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
And again, I don't know how old this person is.

3229
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:02,000
They could be 15, they could be 30.

3230
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:06,000
If you are younger, if you're still in high school, I honestly don't think there's any

3231
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:10,000
rush because I think a lot of people in high school and even somewhat college kind of go

3232
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:15,000
through that phase where, you know, they're not sure what's going on.

3233
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:18,000
And I don't think there's any rush to label yourself.

3234
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:23,000
But if you are, you know, older, experienced, whatever, and you know this is, this is it,

3235
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:27,000
and this is the way it's going to be, then, um, you know, tell your friend first.

3236
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:30,000
It'll be much easier to tell friend, friends.

3237
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:34,000
And that way, if your family does have a negative reaction, you have some, somebody else you

3238
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:35,000
can turn to.

3239
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:36,000
Um.

3240
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:39,000
I, I hope that you are fortunate to have a family that is loving and supporting and all

3241
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:40,000
that.

3242
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:45,000
And in most cases it will, but it would be disingenuous of me to sit here and say, just

3243
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:49,000
tell them everything will be fine because in some situations it's not, but you know

3244
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
your family better than I do.

3245
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
So I guess that's really all I can say on that for now.

3246
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:59,000
If you need help, um, contact one of the resources Jamie mentioned or email me directly.

3247
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:00,000
Yeah.

3248
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:01,000
Good job.

3249
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:02,000
I hope.

3250
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:03,000
Yeah.

3251
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:04,000
I don't.

3252
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:05,000
Yeah.

3253
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:06,000
That's, that's, that's a challenging question.

3254
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
I haven't been asked that in the eight years of doing this.

3255
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:14,000
I don't think I've been told by people, you know, which is always a wonderful compliment.

3256
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:19,000
It's an astonishing feeling, you know, like thank you for being, you know, out on the

3257
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:23,000
radio and just, you know, being a guy who likes games, who happens to be gay.

3258
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:26,000
But I don't think I've had that question.

3259
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:27,000
Yeah.

3260
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:33,000
But, um, thank you for asking because I think it takes a lot of guts to even type that out.

3261
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:36,000
So please email me if you need it.

3262
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:39,000
Um, this one's from Rababa.

3263
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:45,000
It says, this is particularly for Jamie and he sends me a link from doitmyself.org of

3264
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:51,000
a TARDIS cake, but it lights up and it's got the inside of the TARDIS through the window,

3265
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
but it's a cake.

3266
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
That is awesome.

3267
02:39:55,000 --> 02:40:00,000
And he concludes his email with, it's probably too involved for most, but it is cool.

3268
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:05,000
I'm going to share the link with our chatters real quick.

3269
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:08,000
I like the TARDIS made of cake.

3270
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:09,000
I would eat that.

3271
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:10,000
Delicious.

3272
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:16,000
I think I just make a cake in the shape of a TARDIS, but I can't bake for crap.

3273
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:19,000
I can't even make pancakes, right Rob?

3274
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
That, that's awful.

3275
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:24,000
Okay, last email.

3276
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
Greetings, OLR.

3277
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:27,000
Rini here.

3278
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:32,000
A few episodes ago, you mentioned having a contingency plan for when Loki needs to care

3279
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
for his newborn bundle of joy.

3280
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:39,000
Although there is always the amusing chance that he may never be gone, I still would like

3281
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:42,000
to suggest a host, a guest host, Scott Rubin.

3282
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:47,000
I'm just listening to the guy, and I think he'd be doing OLR and his All Games fans

3283
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:52,000
a favor by chiming in once with his thoughts on games and gaming news today.

3284
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:56,000
Also, he would make this show run seven hours long and prompt everyone to call in sick due

3285
02:40:56,000 --> 02:41:00,000
to copious, but responsible amounts of drinking, perverted discussions, and not giving a fuck

3286
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
in general.

3287
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
I think I approve of that.

3288
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:08,000
And since Dark Sakura and Sky recently purchased Team Fortress 2, I'd like to make a few

3289
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:12,000
suggestions on classes since Sky isn't so hot with the aiming.

3290
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:15,000
One, learn the maps with Medic.

3291
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:19,000
You can learn where items and paths are while helping your teammates.

3292
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:25,000
Overall, over-heal everyone, but focus on assisting those taking fire, and especially

3293
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:29,000
do not be afraid to turn around and see what's around you.

3294
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:34,000
If you unlock the Uber Saw, feel free to knife Uyghur classes to gain power for your Uber

3295
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:35,000
Charge.

3296
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:36,000
Two, try Pyro.

3297
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:40,000
Can I say, I was actually thinking of being a Medic, because I'm always the White Mage

3298
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:41,000
in these games.

3299
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Always.

3300
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:43,000
Okay.

3301
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:44,000
Two, try Pyro.

3302
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:48,000
Incredibly helpful with this flamethrower because it can airblast to push enemies in

3303
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:52,000
rockets, grenades, or slash grenades while putting out fires on teammates.

3304
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:57,000
Be sneaky and use hit-and-run tactics to let the afterburn make enemies retreat, or at

3305
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
least hold off them a bit.

3306
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
If they're alone or weak, finish them off.

3307
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:04,000
Always check for spies and never use the backburner.

3308
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
That's capitalized never.

3309
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
And that's capitalized always, by the way.

3310
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
Three, try Engineer.

3311
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:15,000
Build teleporters and dispensers to help teammates and play sentries where they can cover an

3312
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:18,000
important point while being shielded by some part of the level.

3313
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:22,000
Unlock the Wrangler and the Gunslinger to deploy many sentries for offensive play.

3314
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:29,000
Don't forget hitting buildings with your wrench doubles their construction speed, and all

3315
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:32,000
but the many sentries can be upgraded to level three.

3316
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:37,000
If your buildings get sapped by spies, always kill the spy first and then get rid of the

3317
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:38,000
sappers.

3318
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:42,000
Don't forget that your wrench has a higher chance to deal critical hits than most other

3319
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
melee weapons.

3320
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:49,000
I was actually going to try Engineer because I found that they have now where you can move

3321
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:50,000
your sentries around.

3322
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:51,000
Your turrets.

3323
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
Apparently everyone's playing Engineer because of it.

3324
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:54,000
Yeah.

3325
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:55,000
That's what I hear.

3326
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:59,000
For more information and strategies, okay, I have to do the voice.

3327
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
Ready?

3328
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:05,000
For more information and strategies, I direct you to the official TF2 Wiki here.

3329
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:13,000
Http colon slash slash wiki dot Team Fortress dot com slash wiki slash main underscore page.

3330
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
Good luck and don't fail, dammit.

3331
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:18,000
Rini is very excited to have us playing Team Fortress 2.

3332
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:21,000
I've seen it on the Twitter as well.

3333
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:22,000
I actually need to revisit it.

3334
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
I didn't really touch it at all this week.

3335
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
Well, I really haven't been able to do much.

3336
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
Well, yeah, you got the hand thing going on, though.

3337
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
Well, we still have to have our game.

3338
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:31,000
We shook on it.

3339
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:34,000
So whenever your hand's better, we're going to get on that.

3340
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:37,000
Do you like my announcer voice?

3341
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
I do.

3342
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:42,000
I could do my wacky morning DJ voice, though.

3343
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
Wouldn't that be fun to do an entire episode?

3344
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:48,000
I can do the annoying female co-host voice.

3345
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
Maybe for the next April Fool's show.

3346
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
Oh, the Scott thing, too.

3347
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:56,000
I think a lot of the All Games folks miss hearing him on the radio.

3348
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
He certainly had a fun show.

3349
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
He's not on the radio anymore?

3350
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:03,000
Well, he does the Appaday thing now.

3351
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
They're doing the TV thing.

3352
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:09,000
Him and Diane Mizona do a show, which is kind of fun, that's online.

3353
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:14,000
Well, I don't know. I'll hear about these random takeover shows,

3354
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:17,000
but I don't think they're podcasts or anything because I never hear them.

3355
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:20,000
So I don't think he's really doing radio frequently.

3356
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
He's not doing regular radio.

3357
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
I'm comfortable in saying that.

3358
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:27,000
It would be awesome to have him on the show, but here's the biggest problem.

3359
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:32,000
Having a co-host via Skype anything is going to suck.

3360
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:37,000
And I realize other shows do it, and they do it really well.

3361
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:40,000
But you have to remember, we've been spoiled over eight years

3362
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
of being in the same room doing the show,

3363
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:45,000
and I think it's honestly what makes our show different at the end of the day.

3364
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:49,000
And I will tell you, the most fun I've had doing radio with Scott

3365
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:52,000
was when we were in the same room, like the E3 Outpost

3366
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:55,000
and the random times we dropped into All Games Interactive

3367
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:56,000
and some of those things.

3368
02:44:56,000 --> 02:45:01,000
When they had that frat house, practically, in Santa Monica.

3369
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
That place was fantabulous.

3370
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:06,000
That place was fantabulous. It was like a frat house.

3371
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
Good times. Good memories are had by all.

3372
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:11,000
And sadly, that place doesn't exist anymore.

3373
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:14,000
If you wanted to drive up to NorCal, though, hell, we'd host him in a heartbeat,

3374
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:18,000
but I think he's probably busy with all his other stuff.

3375
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:21,000
So, again, we don't want to be so quick like,

3376
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
Gosh, Loki!

3377
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:28,000
All we can do is sit here and talk about who's going to replace you for one week.

3378
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:29,000
I don't even care.

3379
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
I know, I know.

3380
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:34,000
It's kind of one of those, we're just going to see who's available that week.

3381
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:35,000
We'll burn that bridge when we get to it.

3382
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:38,000
If we have to pick someone up off Skype, we will,

3383
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
but we have got lots of great people.

3384
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:43,000
I'm sure Alan could come back for a show.

3385
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:44,000
Drew, you know, wants to do it.

3386
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:47,000
It'll be done through an elaborate ceremony featuring roses.

3387
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:50,000
Dan could do it. He's here.

3388
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
That's because he lives here, Rob.

3389
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:55,000
I think the chatters would love it if Extifer would come back for a night.

3390
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:58,000
Maybe Irene. We'll figure something out.

3391
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
You know what?

3392
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:04,000
I really, I really, really, really would like for,

3393
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:08,000
and Dan was actually excited about wanting to be on the show tonight,

3394
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
but the family's leaving town.

3395
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:16,000
But I think that we need to have Dan be a co-host for a night.

3396
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
Well, maybe that'll happen.

3397
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:21,000
I live with the man. He wouldn't let me live it down.

3398
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:22,000
All right.

3399
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
I mean, I love my husband.

3400
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
Let's move on to the next email.

3401
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
That was the email.

3402
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:29,000
Oh, that was it? That was it? All right.

3403
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:33,000
Mailbag. OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us your email in the future.

3404
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:37,000
In the meantime, angst, hatred, boo, hiss, the FUs of the week.

3405
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:58,000
FU to the absolute and utter pain that my hand is in.

3406
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:06,000
Yeah, while I'm healing faster and I've got more range of motion,

3407
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:09,000
it actually hurts worse, if that makes sense,

3408
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
and the little tight stitches.

3409
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:14,000
And I know it's all for a good thing and I'm very happy,

3410
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:20,000
but FU to just being in pain and being tired all the time from it, too.

3411
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
I'm really tired all the time and wanting meat,

3412
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
and I'm not supposed to be eating meat.

3413
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:31,000
So, FU to all that and FU to work stuff I've heard about.

3414
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:36,000
FU to Apple for reasons I think I explained either on Bobby's show

3415
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:37,000
or at the beginning of this show.

3416
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
I can't even remember now. It was all blur.

3417
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:43,000
FU to stress.

3418
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:46,000
I bought a car this week, which is actually awesome and I'm happy,

3419
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:49,000
but now I've got to get rid of the old car and that takes a lot of work.

3420
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
So, yeah.

3421
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
That's it.

3422
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:59,000
FU to one particular person I saw driving on my way to the show today,

3423
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:02,000
completely swerving all around the road,

3424
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
and of course she was texting on cell phones.

3425
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:07,000
Thank you, wonderful, reckless person.

3426
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
Oops. Sorry.

3427
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:14,000
FU to the fact I just started playing the credits music on accident.

3428
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:15,000
And that's it.

3429
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
Can I punctuate that? Can I punctuate that with something?

3430
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:18,000
Sure.

3431
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:23,000
Nobody's text message or phone conversation is as important as Elijah's

3432
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
on the road around you.

3433
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:26,000
Even my mother?

3434
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:27,000
Even.

3435
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:30,000
I think she'd disagree.

3436
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:33,000
Rob, I have told my mother to get off the phone with me

3437
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:36,000
if I found out that she was talking to me while she was driving

3438
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:37,000
without hands-freezing.

3439
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
I'm just saying. Is it okay if I'm stuck in traffic

3440
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
because I totally texted you and Bobby today,

3441
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:44,000
but I was sitting in stopped traffic and I was watching.

3442
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:45,000
I think that's a little bit different.

3443
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:46,000
Okay.

3444
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:50,000
But there's people who do this crap while they're moving on the road,

3445
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:51,000
and that's just not right.

3446
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:57,000
Yeah. I'm not perfect, but safety first.

3447
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:58,000
But you want everyone to think you are.

3448
02:48:58,000 --> 02:48:59,000
I know. Well, you know.

3449
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:03,000
Well, no, I take that back. I am perfect, actually.

3450
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:04,000
Rob.

3451
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:05,000
All right.

3452
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:08,000
Couple more stories for you guys, and then the Skype line.

3453
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:14,000
Brace yourselves, 877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

3454
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
Couple new stories real quick before we get there, though.

3455
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:17,000
Loki.

3456
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:20,000
I guess Kmart wants me to put reviews up for games.

3457
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:27,000
Honestly, wouldn't have known that because I have not been in a Kmart in...

3458
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:28,000
Yes, think about it.

3459
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:31,000
Oh, God, at like ten years now.

3460
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:32,000
So, yes.

3461
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:33,000
You should go. It's fun.

3462
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:34,000
And remember Kmart's one of the... on our Wiki.

3463
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
It's a cultural experience.

3464
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:37,000
It's like stepping back into the 80s.

3465
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:38,000
It is. It is.

3466
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
Hey, remember the 80s?

3467
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:45,000
Remember back in the day when they used to have, like, those touchpad sensors for opening the doors?

3468
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
It wasn't this fancy infrared.

3469
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
It was, you know, you step on a sensor and...

3470
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:53,000
Actually, I think you guys, Kmart has modernized a little bit.

3471
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:57,000
I think they are right now somewhere around 93.

3472
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:58,000
Eh.

3473
02:49:58,000 --> 02:49:59,000
Just so you know.

3474
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
Rob, you're adorable.

3475
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
I just want to let you know.

3476
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:04,000
I know.

3477
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:12,000
Um, apparently they are looking for reader reviews or I guess shopper reviews on different titles.

3478
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:19,000
Um, they said, uh, one thing, uh, we'd like to feature your reviews on our shelves.

3479
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:26,000
Um, it says, but at this time we will not be sending out free games for you to review.

3480
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:27,000
Which is kind of funny.

3481
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:31,000
Wait, what? So, like, on the shelf they'll have, like, papers with reviews printed out or something?

3482
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:32,000
I guess.

3483
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:33,000
What?

3484
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:41,000
They're, um, they're basically looking for reviews, um, to help sell games, I guess.

3485
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:44,000
So, we're supposed to help them market games.

3486
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
But they're not going to publish the negative things then.

3487
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:50,000
So, in other words, they will extract one or two sentences that are glowing about the game.

3488
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:53,000
Like, you fucking kill zombies and it's rad.

3489
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
Like, you know, or whatever.

3490
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
They'll put that on a little tag next to the game.

3491
02:50:57,000 --> 02:51:05,000
Yeah, um, so you can go, like, uh, I guess re-register at MyKMart, um, I don't know, that's MyKMart.com.

3492
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:08,000
People are gonna make shit up just to get their stuff in the store.

3493
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:14,000
Dude, all you gotta do, Kmart, seriously, is do a little work, um, I don't know, go to Metacritic

3494
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:19,000
and there's, like, a list of all these fucking reviews with little synopsises of each review

3495
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:24,000
and little, like, blurbs and stuff that you can print out and put on your shelves.

3496
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:25,000
I guess, or maybe that would be copyright.

3497
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:26,000
Yeah, it might be a copyright thing.

3498
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:27,000
Whatever, so.

3499
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
Then put the Metacritic score.

3500
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
That's what they do on Steam.

3501
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:32,000
You can see the Metacritic score right there.

3502
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:35,000
Unless it's, like, under a certain amount, then it's not, it's just not there.

3503
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
Love it.

3504
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:38,000
I don't, I don't understand.

3505
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
Or have it on your website.

3506
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:45,000
Have people review the, you know, stuff like Amazon or GameStop or whomever.

3507
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
I think it's an interesting idea.

3508
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:48,000
It's just a weird one.

3509
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:49,000
You know what I mean?

3510
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:52,000
Like, it's, it's interesting that they want to put people's reviews up there

3511
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:56,000
and it's, I guess, to encourage a community type thing on the site

3512
02:51:56,000 --> 02:52:00,000
to get people, like, thinking about Kmart, because otherwise you don't.

3513
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:01,000
Whoa.

3514
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
Here's, my mind's blown here.

3515
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:06,000
Apparently Kmart has blogs.

3516
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:07,000
What?

3517
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:08,000
Yes.

3518
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:09,000
Get out.

3519
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:10,000
MyKmart.com.

3520
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
Do they blog about the coffee shops at Kmart?

3521
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:13,000
No, apparently.

3522
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:19,000
This Week in the Icy Machine, Blue Raspberry, yum.

3523
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:24,000
Well, let's see, here's some wonderful, whoa, that's weird.

3524
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:27,000
Here's some wonderful blog posts that we have going on here.

3525
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:30,000
Some of these may even be slightly relevant.

3526
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,000
Which way do you weed?

3527
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:37,000
And this is talking about either using, I guess, a rake or weed spray.

3528
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:41,000
Kevin Butler versus Old Spice, Old Spice Man.

3529
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:45,000
Who wins for being, I guess, most infamous.

3530
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:48,000
Gamer Chat number one was a success.

3531
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:49,000
Thanks to all-

3532
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
Wait, is this, like, only gaming stuff on the blog?

3533
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
No, this is just blogs.myKmart.com.

3534
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:56,000
They have Blue Light Special stuff.

3535
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
They post Blue Light Specials on the blog?

3536
02:52:58,000 --> 02:52:59,000
Yes.

3537
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:00,000
Attention, Twitter.

3538
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:03,000
Blue Light Special on Pepperidge Farm cookies.

3539
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
50% off.

3540
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:08,000
Gamer Chat number one was a success.

3541
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:09,000
I gotta read this.

3542
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:15,000
Thanks to all who joined yesterday's, you know, pound, Gamer Chat Twitter event.

3543
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:18,000
We had a spirited discussion about gaming,

3544
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:23,000
including the best year for video games, people's first games,

3545
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:27,000
and some of this year's surprises, both good and bad.

3546
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:30,000
Oh, but if you weren't able to catch it yesterday,

3547
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:33,000
you can download a, or you can check out a full transcript.

3548
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:38,000
What are some of the topics that you'd like to discuss in the next Gamer Chat?

3549
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:41,000
Oh, oh, wait, what's this?

3550
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:45,000
I, they have a gaming blog, too.

3551
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:48,000
Kmartgamer.com.

3552
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
Are you a Kmart gamer?

3553
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:55,000
Or, I guess it's blogs.myKmart.com slash games.

3554
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:58,000
It's just, it's the same fucking blog with video game tags pulled out.

3555
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:01,000
I see what you're doing.

3556
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:05,000
They talk about, what's your backlog of games?

3557
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:09,000
Oh my God, Kmart, you're so current with your blogs and fun stuff like that.

3558
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
I have to shop at you now.

3559
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:16,000
Kmart is awesome because most every Kmart I've been to totally ignores street dates.

3560
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:18,000
Totally ignores them.

3561
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:20,000
I bet if you went into Kmart and go,

3562
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:23,000
yeah, I saw it on your blog and be like, huh, what's a blog, huh?

3563
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:27,000
On the internet? What the hell's the internet?

3564
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
That's witchcraft.

3565
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:34,000
Did I tell you about the time that like Target was closed for like six months

3566
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,000
and Walmart, I just, I wasn't going to go to Walmart.

3567
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:41,000
So I actually went to Kmart to get like razor blades and it was the most like challenging.

3568
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:44,000
First of all, they have them locked because, you know,

3569
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:48,000
I guess there's rampant thievery of razor blades across the nation.

3570
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:58,000
I had to track someone down to get a key and they give it to just like the old cragly lady.

3571
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:01,000
Here's another wonderful topic.

3572
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
What kind of razor blade did you want?

3573
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:07,000
Did you want the Gillette Mach five or did you want?

3574
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:13,000
I mean, just like, Oh my God, I want to die from June 23rd, 2010 fat guy in a little coat.

3575
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:17,000
Biggest loser special.

3576
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:22,000
You're talking about the biggest loser game.

3577
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:24,000
Wow. My life is now complete.

3578
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:28,000
Now that I have discovered Kmart has a blog, I will read it every day.

3579
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:29,000
You know why? For sure.

3580
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:33,000
Kmart updates their blog more regularly than any of us post on orangehoundsradio.com.

3581
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:36,000
I don't care. Do you want me to post nonsense like this?

3582
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:39,000
I will be happy to post nonsense like this.

3583
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
I played that game. It was wonderful.

3584
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:47,000
Go buy it at Kmart.

3585
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
Look at me making a reference to it.

3586
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:52,000
Would you please sign up for a Kmart account and start reviewing games?

3587
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:57,000
I think we should all sign up for Kmart accounts and start reviewing games on there

3588
02:55:57,000 --> 02:56:02,000
with just like complete nonsensical reviews of things.

3589
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:10,000
Like, you know, like, you know, I was sitting here on the couch and I was playing Naughty Bear

3590
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:15,000
and it was fun, but I was sitting there naked and the dog came up and licked my balls.

3591
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:18,000
So I think this game should be called Naughty Dog.

3592
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:23,000
Like just these complete nonsensical things that have nothing to do with anything.

3593
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:26,000
I would love that very much.

3594
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:30,000
I'm sorry, Rob. My brain started to shut down when you started talking about that.

3595
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:35,000
What you're describing sounds like a lot of effort.

3596
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:39,000
I'm going to do it. I'm going to start a forum thread for awesome Kmart reviews.

3597
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:43,000
And I want all the OL Army to post their awesome Kmart reviews and link them.

3598
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
You mean like butt-tarded?

3599
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:49,000
And just that they have to be like complete. But don't get yourself banned.

3600
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:54,000
Don't say stupid shit. You have to say like really awkward things.

3601
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:57,000
Basically you have to go on tangents a lot.

3602
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
Just like us.

3603
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:04,000
You'll be talking about your Red Dead Redemption review and then somehow talk about how you like horses.

3604
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:09,000
And this one time you rode a horse and then it gave you like, you know, car crash or something like that.

3605
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:15,000
Now that was terrible. But at least the horse's name was like, you know, Biscuit or something.

3606
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:23,000
I was riding my horse Clyde and I skinned a horse in Red Dead Redemption that reminded me of Clyde.

3607
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:26,000
And one time Clyde kicked me in the shin.

3608
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:29,000
And it made me pee.

3609
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:31,000
How about that?

3610
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:35,000
Monty Boggs here. This is great. Now people are posting their reviews. This is great.

3611
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:40,000
Alan Wake makes me want to buy Energizer batteries at Kmart. Buy Alan Wake at Kmart.

3612
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:43,000
Alan Wake from Gamestop wasn't as good. That's pretty good.

3613
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:52,000
Ray Ayanami says, great rail shooter. Now has anyone been far as decided to use even Go1 to do look more like?

3614
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:58,000
I get it.

3615
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:03,000
Let me try to read it again. That's awesome. That's an awesome review.

3616
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:13,000
Great rail shooter. Now has anyone really been far as decided to use even Go1 to do look more like?

3617
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:20,000
I love you guys.

3618
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:28,000
That should be on the tag right there.

3619
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:34,000
That about sums up what I think of Kmart in the reviewing.

3620
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:37,000
You've been far as decided to use even Go1 to do more look like?

3621
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:40,000
That's about right.

3622
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:43,000
That's the point. Dark Dead Studio is like, I don't get it. That's the point.

3623
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:46,000
Like he just he just threw a bunch of words together that make no sense at all.

3624
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:53,000
And it's funny. And I'm laughing so hard. I'm crying. I can't stop.

3625
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:57,000
Yet Dark Soccer is not like throwing up over there like the bad grammars.

3626
02:58:57,000 --> 02:59:01,000
She must be. No, because this is appropriately bad grammar.

3627
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:04,000
OK. Like there is like little cats.

3628
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:09,000
I didn't go around correcting the little cats. I pet them on the head and feed them fish.

3629
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:13,000
All right. One more story for you guys and then we'll get to the calls.

3630
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:20,000
1877 Game OLR username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

3631
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:30,000
The Brick Theater in Brooklyn, New York is putting on some shows and they are video game inspired plays.

3632
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:42,000
Yes, that's right. There's Grand Theft Ovid, which takes the Roman poets Ovid's songs and talks like integrates it with Grand Theft Auto.

3633
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:48,000
Modal Combat uses guitar controllers. And I don't even understand this.

3634
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:52,000
This is just like what? Let me let me look at the official website here.

3635
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:57,000
Let me look here. Go into the Brick Theater website here.

3636
02:59:57,000 --> 03:00:00,000
Gameplay at the Brick is art playable.

3637
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:04,000
Our video game cinematic is Mashima theatrical. Our smartphones a stage.

3638
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:07,000
Is there an architecture that connects these diverse media forums?

3639
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:14,000
What boundaries can be broken within and without the walls of an off off Broadway theater to change your reviews?

3640
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:18,000
They're having. Rock band karaoke night.

3641
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:25,000
Well, that's not a play. Baby Castles, Chiptunes Dance Party, Kool Aid Man and Second Life.

3642
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:31,000
Theater of the Arcade, five classic video games adapted for the stage in this collection of short plays.

3643
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:37,000
The creators of Brick hit suspicious package and this is stupid. Like what?

3644
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:42,000
This makes no sense. It gets a Dan quote, Rob.

3645
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:46,000
What? Really? That's Dan line.

3646
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:50,000
You know what? I'm going to write a review of these plays and it's going to say great rail shooter.

3647
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:57,000
Now, has anyone really been far as decided to use even go what to do look more like?

3648
03:00:57,000 --> 03:01:00,000
Because that's pretty much my reaction when reading this story.

3649
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:03,000
One, eight, seven, seven. Game. O. L. R.

3650
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:07,000
Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio. If you want to give us a call, we'll talk.

3651
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:09,000
One, eight, seven, seven. Game. O. L. R.

3652
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:11,000
username is Skype is Orange Laundry.

3653
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:14,000
The Skype line is now open.

3654
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:20,000
Frisbee is asking what game should I review? You should review blur.

3655
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:24,000
Frisbee, I'd like you to review the game blur. Let's go to the phones.

3656
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:27,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

3657
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:32,000
Hi, it's Ray Iannami. Hi, Ray. Good to see you yesterday at the show.

3658
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:36,000
Yeah, it was really good to see you. Yeah.

3659
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:39,000
So what's on your mind?

3660
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:46,000
So for California Extreme, the games I'm looking for,

3661
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:54,000
The Don't Bunch Diode 2, Blue Space Harrier, Red, among other things.

3662
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:58,000
Wait, there was a space harrier there? There was a space harrier in the back.

3663
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:05,000
Oh, I missed it. Fortunately, the person who said the machine forgot to put in an add a credit button.

3664
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:12,000
So for instance, you had to put in a coin and take the coin out of the coin door just to start a game.

3665
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:18,000
And the second day they closed the coin door. So you had to put it in a corner, which is kind of dumb.

3666
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:22,000
Yeah, it was kind of bothersome when some of those games would run out of credits.

3667
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:27,000
But you know, I can't hate because they're just arcade collectors and they're actually doing a favor,

3668
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:31,000
putting their machines out there. They don't have to do it, so I try not to bitch.

3669
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:34,000
But it was really frustrating when I wanted to play Tapper and it was out of credits.

3670
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:38,000
It's like, wham.

3671
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:43,000
So in other news, I've gone around to playing Deathmatch and Sin and Punishment 2.

3672
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:46,000
Now, what was your real review of Sin and Punishment 2?

3673
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:50,000
Because by the way, that was you I noticed in chat that has now spawned the new OLR quote.

3674
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:53,000
Has anyone really been far as decided to use even Go What To Do Look More Like?

3675
03:02:53,000 --> 03:03:01,000
Well, it's actually an already existing Internet meme. I just thought I'd throw in some random meme to go with my review.

3676
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:05,000
Did you bring 4chan to this show?

3677
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:06,000
Maybe.

3678
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:08,000
Oh, god damn you.

3679
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:10,000
Well, I brought games back to the show.

3680
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:13,000
Oh, okay. Whatever. No, I'm just fucking around.

3681
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:15,000
Kids on the Internet are funny.

3682
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:20,000
I've been playing Sin and Punishment 2 for the past two days.

3683
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:24,000
It's pretty fun. It's a great improvement over the last game.

3684
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:29,000
But I'm going to warrant anyone who wants to get that game even though it's not played the original.

3685
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:32,000
It's fucking hard.

3686
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:38,000
I see. Aren't most of those shooter games pretty hard?

3687
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:49,000
Yeah, I mean, if people aren't too bad by real shooter standards, it's a bosses that get to me mainly.

3688
03:03:49,000 --> 03:04:01,000
I have to do a few tries if we get the patterns down so I don't end up bullshitting through a pattern.

3689
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:05,000
And I've been playing Death Moth as well for the past two weeks.

3690
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:07,000
And how's that?

3691
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:16,000
So Death Moth, for those who haven't heard of it, is a side-scrolling shooter by Kave with gothic loli elements.

3692
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:17,000
Awesome.

3693
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:27,000
And that aside, I especially like this game. I love the fact that you can fire in both directions, which is a luxury that most side-scrollers tend to lack.

3694
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:32,000
Like, you're stuck firing to the right, which is usually the direction you scroll.

3695
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:38,000
And it's also much easier to play than other Bloodhog games.

3696
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:44,000
Even with the in-game difficulty at the highest, I can get to the final stage easily.

3697
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:54,000
But on other shooters, I usually end up only halfway through the game on my first credit.

3698
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:58,000
Hmm. Interesting. You can get that far?

3699
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:05,000
I thought that would be the harder game, because usually those, like, SHMUP games are impossibly difficult.

3700
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:13,000
Death Moth, no, not that... it's not that hard, really. It's been one of the easier cases.

3701
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:19,000
I play as opposed to the Donpax, which I play as much harder.

3702
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:20,000
Alright.

3703
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:24,000
They do call him Bullet Hell for a reason, though.

3704
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:31,000
I fire bombs on the first spot of the Donpax Dial Joe, and that's not something I do in both shooters.

3705
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:40,000
Like, I can easily get through the stage one boss of a vertical shooter just fine without using any bombs.

3706
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:42,000
Okay. Okay.

3707
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:47,000
Well, are there any other games coming up in the near future that you're going to be reviewing in the future on the show?

3708
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:49,000
That you're looking forward to playing?

3709
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:59,000
Um, I'm not sure, because I've spent a whole lot of buying new games until this mess up begins next month, because Death Moth and Standard Placement took a toll on my money.

3710
03:05:59,000 --> 03:06:06,000
I hear ya. Now I have a car payment, so I have to watch my gaming funding as well, so I think a lot of us are in that pinch.

3711
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:15,000
Like, including tax, both of those games cost me $110, so I've already been waiting until this mess up begins, so I'll probably, I don't know, I'll probably pick up a person that's pretty portable.

3712
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:22,000
Alright. Well, we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you very much for your call, and we'll see you at the next big Bay Area expo, okay?

3713
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:24,000
Okay, then. Alright.

3714
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:25,000
Later.

3715
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:31,000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR. Let's go to another call that's coming in right now. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

3716
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:33,000
Uh, this is Recon Elite.

3717
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:36,000
Recon Elite! Welcome to the show. Have you called in before?

3718
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:40,000
Uh, no. I'm a long-time listener, but first-time caller.

3719
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:46,000
I've always wanted someone to say that on this program. Long-time listener, first-time caller. Well, welcome! How you doin'? What's on your mind?

3720
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:48,000
I'm doing good.

3721
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:50,000
How can we help you? What's on your mind?

3722
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:56,000
Yeah, I just wanted to know, um, I have a quick question. I don't know if you guys ever played it before, but Borderlands, what do you think about that?

3723
03:06:56,000 --> 03:06:58,000
Borderlands is awesome!

3724
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:15,000
I have not played Borderlands, but I've watched someone else play it, and it kinda looks like, it has a really neat art style. It's kinda like Oblivion meets this very, like, post-apocalyptic kind of, uh, world. I don't know. Have you played this?

3725
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:16,000
Okay.

3726
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:18,000
With guns! And it's fun!

3727
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:19,000
It's awesome.

3728
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:20,000
It's hilarious.

3729
03:07:20,000 --> 03:07:22,000
I've heard a lot of great things about this game.

3730
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:24,000
Totally get the Isle of Dr. Ned.

3731
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:36,000
At least, though, you totally missed your opportunity to get it on Steam for, like, super cheap, because I almost bought it because it was down to, like, 20 bucks, but, unfortunately, the Uber sale's over. But, let me guess, you're probably gonna get it on console, huh?

3732
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:39,000
Well, it was either one. It didn't bother me too much.

3733
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:40,000
Oh, okay.

3734
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:58,000
Well, the community was big, you know, as in playing it, because the last thing I wanted was to go online on it, and then nobody ain't there, you know. That was my fear.

3735
03:07:58,000 --> 03:08:10,000
You definitely would have people to play with there. And, you know, they've released several expansions for it. I've really heard nothing but good things about it. I just haven't had the time to play it myself, thanks to certain MMOs that I spend a lot of time playing.

3736
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:12,000
That's wild.

3737
03:08:12,000 --> 03:08:13,000
Addict!

3738
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:15,000
I say wow too all the time.

3739
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:18,000
Okay, phew. Okay, then you understand what I go through.

3740
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:19,000
Yeah.

3741
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:36,000
But, yeah, no, I've honestly heard nothing but good things about the game. Here's a thought. If you want to try it out, here's what some people I know are doing. OnLive is this new thing that's out there, and you can sign, they're still doing sign-ups, and I just read something, like, it's extended through Labor Day.

3742
03:08:36,000 --> 03:08:40,000
You can try to get into the beta by signing up. Are you on OnLive?

3743
03:08:40,000 --> 03:08:41,000
Yes.

3744
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:49,000
Okay, you can play demos of games. You can play the first, like, 30 or 45 minutes of a game without buying it, and Borderlands is one of them.

3745
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:52,000
Oh, okay. Oh, that's a nice good suggestion.

3746
03:08:52,000 --> 03:09:10,000
There you go. Go on to OnLive. You know, I gotta say, as weird as I think the OnLive pricing, but here's my suggestion, don't buy it on OnLive, because the whole thing is that, yeah, it's cool that you're playing through another computer that has all the graphics and everything, but you're paying the same price you'd pay at retail for the game.

3747
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:20,000
And it really is only guaranteed to last three years. If OnLive fails, you're going to lose that game. You're basically paying for a three-year rental. So, if you like the game, go get it on Steam.

3748
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:22,000
Okay. Thank you.

3749
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:23,000
That's my suggestion.

3750
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:24,000
I just got one more quick question, and I'll hang up.

3751
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:25,000
Of course.

3752
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:30,000
Do you think Project Natal, what do you think about Project Natal? Do you think it's going to fail, or do you think it's going to succeed?

3753
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:41,000
Well, keep in mind, we're all supposed to call it Kinect now, but I think it's a huge risk on Microsoft's part. A lot of it has to do with how they market it.

3754
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:59,000
The Macy's thing, as much as we give them a hard time about who the hell at Macy's plays Kinect, we know exactly who they're going for. And, you know, all laughing and jokes aside, they're trying to appeal to Mom, or AKA Santa Claus, because they're going kind of directly to make their case there and show the games there.

3755
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:10,000
That's a huge risk on Microsoft's part. I think the price point is everything. I think if they release this for $150, that's really $210 if you want a game.

3756
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:19,000
And I think there's a lot of people that are going to run away from that, but if they can hit that magic number, $99, I think it'll sell twice as much, and it could be a success for them.

3757
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:25,000
Got you. Okay. I just want to end it with that. Love the show. Keep it up. The good work, man. You guys are awesome. I love it.

3758
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:28,000
We love the call. Thank you so much for your enthusiasm. You're awesome.

3759
03:10:28,000 --> 03:10:31,000
And thank you for saying the phrase that we've been waiting to hear.

3760
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:34,000
I know. I've been waiting eight years to hear that. Longtime listener, first time caller.

3761
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:35,000
All right. I got you.

3762
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:36,000
All right. Take care, buddy.

3763
03:10:36,000 --> 03:10:37,000
All right. You have a good night.

3764
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:38,000
Uh-huh. You too.

3765
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:39,000
All right. Bye-bye.

3766
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:45,000
Bye. That's how you know we're like legitimate radio now, because, you know, whenever you listen to a radio talk show, there's always that guy that calls in,

3767
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:49,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Dr. Laura. Longtime listener, first time caller.

3768
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:51,000
Love it.

3769
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:56,000
I don't know why I named Dr. Laura, because she actually really sucks.

3770
03:10:56,000 --> 03:10:58,000
It means we've arrived.

3771
03:10:58,000 --> 03:11:02,000
It is. We made it. We made it. That decree meant something.

3772
03:11:02,000 --> 03:11:04,000
Now the Laverne and Shirley theme is going through my head for some reason?

3773
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:06,000
We're gonna do it.

3774
03:11:06,000 --> 03:11:16,000
By the way, Gold Anthro in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradiocom is kind of offering the counterpoint to what I was just saying about Borderlands.

3775
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:21,000
Meh, Borderlands just isn't the game for me. I played it and was like, this isn't as fun as it sounded.

3776
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:30,000
So, you know, not everybody's a fan, so take that. But I think OnLive is going to be great for demos.

3777
03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:40,000
Like, even I have to pat myself on the back. I think that's a good idea to just go play the first 30 minutes of the game for yourself and make a determination if you want to play, you know, more.

3778
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:45,000
All right. 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3779
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:48,000
Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?

3780
03:11:48,000 --> 03:11:56,000
Uh, sure do. Let's see, let's talk about this really funny hack that they have for Sonic the Hedgehog.

3781
03:11:56,000 --> 03:12:12,000
Sonic 2 XL, it changes the gold rings to onion rings and Sonic gets fat to the point if you eat too many rings without running around enough, you will just sit there and kind of die.

3782
03:12:12,000 --> 03:12:15,000
But he gets a big ol' potbelly. That's kind of funny.

3783
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:25,000
And that's actually a real ROM hack. You can actually download the ROM that's available on the Sonic Retro forums, forums.sonicretro.org.

3784
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:28,000
So check it out there.

3785
03:12:28,000 --> 03:12:42,000
Can I say this real quick? Because bonds006 in chat just spoke up and it reminded me of something he said earlier that I forgot to mention, but apparently he ran into like a New York Times reporter who was doing a story on DDR and BeatMania and stuff.

3786
03:12:42,000 --> 03:12:47,000
He totally pimped our show. Now that's a fan. Now that's a fan.

3787
03:12:47,000 --> 03:12:49,000
Thank you! We love you now.

3788
03:12:49,000 --> 03:12:50,000
I saw that in the chat.

3789
03:12:50,000 --> 03:12:57,000
Yeah, I forgot to mention it earlier. I was going to mention it after the iTunes review, but you know, I'm easily distracted by shiny things. So I apologize.

3790
03:12:57,000 --> 03:13:16,000
You may remember there's a company called Blick that puts out different gamer decals or vinyl decals you can put up on the wall. I'm using them in our nursery. But if you're not interested in New Super Mario Brothers or 8-Bit Mario or Donkey Kong, you can now get your hands on some Atari ones.

3791
03:13:16,000 --> 03:13:30,000
They have Centipede and Asteroids. And they're available for $45 for a full set. They are kind of expensive, but they're kind of neat if that's what you want to put on your wall.

3792
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:36,000
Could have just done that for the baby room. Although I don't know, the Centipede one's a little creepy.

3793
03:13:36,000 --> 03:13:39,000
It's kind of dumb. Asteroids isn't bad. Centipede...

3794
03:13:39,000 --> 03:13:42,000
I think it's... actually are those up on ThinkGeek?

3795
03:13:42,000 --> 03:13:46,000
They've got 8-Bit Mega Man ones coming at some point. That's going to be awesome.

3796
03:13:46,000 --> 03:13:58,000
If I married a gamer nerd someday, you know, like, I think that would be an awesome addition for our house. Like, honestly, I think Dark Soccer should have that up in the vault. I think that looks kind of cool. Although, actually, the way the vault's designed, that wouldn't really work.

3797
03:13:58,000 --> 03:14:14,000
Dan and I actually did have a talk, because I'm sure I've mentioned it on the show before, before we were going to, you know, when we were talking about a kid, we were going to do a Mario theme. And Dan said, uh-uh, Sonic.

3798
03:14:14,000 --> 03:14:23,000
That'll be great, too, because at Loki's house, it'll be Mario, and then you'll have Sonic. What do I get, Crash Bandicoot?

3799
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:28,000
Yes.

3800
03:14:28,000 --> 03:14:35,000
Crash Bandicoot? Crash Bandicoot was fun for, like, three games, and then they just totally, like, beat him into the ground. I'll get Kevin Butler.

3801
03:14:35,000 --> 03:14:42,000
Kevin Butler-themed nursery? That would be creepy.

3802
03:14:42,000 --> 03:14:44,000
Why is the baby crying all the time?

3803
03:14:44,000 --> 03:14:48,000
I don't know what's going on!

3804
03:14:48,000 --> 03:15:03,000
Anything else? Yes. Cave has announced two more SHMUP games coming out. They are going to be releasing, I guess, Gwanji on Xbox Live Arcade.

3805
03:15:03,000 --> 03:15:15,000
Or, I should say, yeah, they're going to be releasing that. What else are they releasing here?

3806
03:15:15,000 --> 03:15:29,000
Oh, here we go. Kai Katana, or Red Katana, is going to be a new Bullet Hell shooter coming out. I believe that's going to be on, I think, the download services, like Xbox Live Arcade.

3807
03:15:29,000 --> 03:15:35,000
And then for the iPhone, they're going to do Dondopachi Daifukkatsu.

3808
03:15:35,000 --> 03:15:38,000
Yay! I totally want Dondopachi on my phone.

3809
03:15:38,000 --> 03:15:53,000
And that'll be coming out of the iPhone this summer. So, that's kind of cool. Let's see. Screenshots here of, uh, that's a private video. Well, fuck you, I don't want to read it then. Or watch it, whatever.

3810
03:15:53,000 --> 03:16:12,000
Apparently, Amazon Germany has listed a Xbox 360 4GB arcade system bundle. Of course, they've already announced that they're going to be doing some sort of arcade system this fall in the US and other territories.

3811
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:23,000
But now we kind of have an idea of what it's going to be. It's going to be probably that slim down system without a hard drive, but a 4GB memory stick, or not memory stick, USB thumb drive that you're going to be able to use with it.

3812
03:16:23,000 --> 03:16:37,000
And that's fine, since, remember, you can actually put in your own laptop drives into the Xbox 360 S, or whatever the hell you're going to call it, just like you can on a Playstation 3.

3813
03:16:37,000 --> 03:16:53,000
That's kind of neat, I guess. But that'll be available this fall. It looks like it's going to be, well, right now it's listing at 148.99 euros.

3814
03:16:53,000 --> 03:17:14,000
So, um... I believe that's it.

3815
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:27,000
I think Apple needs to work on, I don't know, making the iOSes work on their phones first.

3816
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:41,000
I'm raging because I have a 3G, and the iOS 4 upgrade just borked it, and it kind of was pointed out to me, and I think it was a very good observation that they do this to make me upgrade, and it stinks.

3817
03:17:41,000 --> 03:17:43,000
That's all I'm saying.

3818
03:17:43,000 --> 03:17:49,000
And I know, then I shouldn't get an Apple, I shouldn't buy an iPhone, I shouldn't support them. Maybe I won't! I don't know.

3819
03:17:49,000 --> 03:17:53,000
No, we all know I'm going to get that shiny, white, new iPhone, because I want it.

3820
03:17:53,000 --> 03:17:55,000
Alright.

3821
03:17:55,000 --> 03:17:58,000
ST100Matt is currently working on a Kmart review, I'm so excited.

3822
03:17:58,000 --> 03:18:01,000
Okay, that's it, though, for the show now.

3823
03:18:01,000 --> 03:18:06,000
Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show, and listening to us, and downloading us, and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

3824
03:18:06,000 --> 03:18:18,000
We can't do it without your support, you know, we don't have massive advertising or anything like that, it's really word of mouth, and the awesome reviews you guys do, and telling reporters and shit about us, that is word of mouth at its finest.

3825
03:18:18,000 --> 03:18:27,000
Thank you guys so much, we so appreciate it, and you guys are the reason we come back week after week, and don't let the State Fair distract us from doing a show.

3826
03:18:27,000 --> 03:18:30,000
Alright, but Disneyland might, I'm just putting it out there.

3827
03:18:30,000 --> 03:18:36,000
Alright, anyhow, for now, though, we're going to go around and give everybody's final thoughts. Uh, Loki, why don't you start us off tonight with your final thought?

3828
03:18:36,000 --> 03:18:41,000
I want to make some of these custom Mario Kart tracks for the Wii. They look fun.

3829
03:18:41,000 --> 03:18:44,000
And I can make some pretty killer tracks, probably.

3830
03:18:44,000 --> 03:18:49,000
My final thought is, my server on WoW is scheduled for 24 hour maintenance this week.

3831
03:18:49,000 --> 03:18:57,000
Nooooooo! Just kidding, I'm going to play lots of Team Fortress 2, and Left 4 Dead 1, and these other games I've been meaning to play forever.

3832
03:18:57,000 --> 03:18:59,000
Dark Soccer, your final thought?

3833
03:18:59,000 --> 03:19:01,000
My Sim's house is freaking gorgeous.

3834
03:19:01,000 --> 03:19:05,000
You've put a lot of flowers in it, it's a very girly house because you have flowers everywhere.

3835
03:19:05,000 --> 03:19:10,000
Well, it's not very girly, it's this one part of it that's set up as a wild flower garden.

3836
03:19:10,000 --> 03:19:12,000
And those are totally Sakura trees, aren't they?

3837
03:19:12,000 --> 03:19:20,000
Yeah, they are. But the rest of the house is very sort of neo-modern, and my house floats. We all float here.

3838
03:19:20,000 --> 03:19:29,000
Alright, that's it. We're tuning out and signing off. Thank you guys so much again for your support. We'll be back to do it all again next week.

3839
03:19:29,000 --> 03:19:35,000
We'll see you next week with more of Orange, unless Loki's wife has the baby, then he won't be here.

3840
03:19:35,000 --> 03:19:37,000
Because that could happen at any time, so stay tuned.

3841
03:19:37,000 --> 03:19:39,000
I hope she doesn't have anything.

3842
03:19:39,000 --> 03:19:41,000
Yeah, well that's true. She's still got what, another month, right?

3843
03:19:41,000 --> 03:19:44,000
Preferably at least two weeks.

3844
03:19:44,000 --> 03:19:47,000
At least two weeks, alright then. So hopefully two more weeks of Loki at least.

3845
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:54,000
Alright, but that's it. Have a wonderful night everybody. We'll see you soon next time here on Orange Lounge Radio. Good night.

3846
03:20:17,000 --> 03:20:24,000
See you next time.
