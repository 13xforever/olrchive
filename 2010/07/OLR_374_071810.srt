00:00:13,778 --> 00:00:24,774
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, July 18, 2010, 3D YouTube is set for the PlayStation 3, details come out on Mega Man Universe, and one retail chain puts user reviews on the shelves.

2
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:36,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:44,016
[SPEAKER_05]: We are that video game show dedicated to video games, gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, you name it.

4
00:00:44,216 --> 00:00:48,500
[SPEAKER_05]: You talk about it live in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

5
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:49,821
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:55,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:55,607 --> 00:00:56,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

8
00:00:56,327 --> 00:00:56,988
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing, Jamie?

9
00:00:57,642 --> 00:00:58,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

10
00:00:58,643 --> 00:00:59,403
[SPEAKER_05]: You're high?

11
00:00:59,763 --> 00:01:03,526
[SPEAKER_08]: No, actually, um... Starting the Prop 19 celebration a little early?

12
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:04,927
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.

13
00:01:05,628 --> 00:01:06,808
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got Vicodin in me.

14
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:07,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.

15
00:01:07,629 --> 00:01:10,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I've got a slice in my hand.

16
00:01:10,802 --> 00:01:17,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you had your surgery, as we've been talking about for a couple weeks on the show, because it was scheduled last week, but it happened for real Tuesday, right?

17
00:01:17,747 --> 00:01:19,628
[SPEAKER_08]: It did, and it was really boring.

18
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:23,011
[SPEAKER_05]: But you're here, so obviously you're doing alright.

19
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:25,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it hurts.

20
00:01:25,773 --> 00:01:26,153
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

21
00:01:26,193 --> 00:01:27,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Vicodin's supposed to help that.

22
00:01:27,862 --> 00:01:31,345
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Viken and Samosa make you not care.

23
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:32,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Samosa?

24
00:01:32,565 --> 00:01:33,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Samosa.

25
00:01:33,186 --> 00:01:34,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's going to be a fun show, folks.

26
00:01:34,867 --> 00:01:36,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I was fun yesterday, though.

27
00:01:36,648 --> 00:01:38,150
[SPEAKER_08]: I was really entertaining, I feel.

28
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:44,154
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to get into yesterday in just a minute, but it would not be a show if I didn't introduce the one and only Techmaster Loki.

29
00:01:44,818 --> 00:01:47,019
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be a show, I just wouldn't be introduced.

30
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,380
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing, Loki?

31
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,641
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing fine.

32
00:01:50,121 --> 00:01:50,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

33
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:53,303
[SPEAKER_05]: How's the baby room painting going?

34
00:01:53,323 --> 00:02:02,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I've seen pictures show up, and for the listeners who might be new to OLR, who are just tuning in for the first time, Loki's wife is expecting really soon, right?

35
00:02:02,227 --> 00:02:03,588
[SPEAKER_05]: August 19th, but she's 35 weeks and 3 days now.

36
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:03,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

37
00:02:03,928 --> 00:02:04,368
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know...

38
00:02:11,472 --> 00:02:12,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Becky was 10 days overdue with Julian.

39
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:48,515
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so any day, basically they get to the point though, the doctor will only let you go up to 42 weeks and then they just said, okay, now you're having the baby.

40
00:02:48,796 --> 00:02:50,137
[SPEAKER_03]: We're inducing you and you're going.

41
00:02:50,337 --> 00:03:01,009
[SPEAKER_03]: So, no, but Nellie, she's hoping to have the baby by the end of the month, you know, preferably at 37 weeks, which would be a week from this coming Thursday, so.

42
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:04,431
[SPEAKER_05]: and we don't know what's going to happen to OLR while you're gone.

43
00:03:04,512 --> 00:03:07,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Knowing you, you'll be here even if she delivers Sunday morning.

44
00:03:07,514 --> 00:03:09,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I will probably be gone at least a week or two.

45
00:03:09,896 --> 00:03:10,536
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about it.

46
00:03:10,616 --> 00:03:17,561
[SPEAKER_05]: It is so funny because they're seriously like people like vultures clamoring for your spot while you're gone even that one week.

47
00:03:18,682 --> 00:03:21,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, Drew's been showing up more and more lately.

48
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:25,886
[SPEAKER_05]: We got an email tonight that Jamie's going to read later that has another suggestion.

49
00:03:25,946 --> 00:03:26,987
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really funny.

50
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:28,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's too bad he's not here this week.

51
00:03:28,428 --> 00:03:29,889
[SPEAKER_03]: It really only takes three weeks.

52
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,951
[SPEAKER_03]: But unfortunately, he was shy one week.

53
00:03:34,051 --> 00:03:35,512
[SPEAKER_03]: So that ain't going to work.

54
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we'll figure it out.

55
00:03:36,393 --> 00:03:42,218
[SPEAKER_05]: But the point I was actually trying to make, for those that didn't know, you are doing your baby room in a, what, New Super Mario Bros.

56
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:42,819
[SPEAKER_05]: theme, right?

57
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:43,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, New Super Mario Bros.

58
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,000
[SPEAKER_03]: theme.

59
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:53,710
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've been painting a lot, and actually I'm trying to get them uploaded on the photo gallery thing, but it's been a little on the slow side.

60
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,713
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some pictures right now on there that are really...

61
00:03:58,134 --> 00:03:59,555
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of work ago.

62
00:03:59,816 --> 00:04:03,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's a lot of stuff we've done since the stuff that I posted.

63
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:13,208
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd say it's about now maybe, I don't know, 60, 75% done.

64
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:15,210
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is all the base stuff.

65
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,712
[SPEAKER_03]: We still have to go back and actually shade it so that it looks...

66
00:04:18,653 --> 00:04:19,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

67
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:47,558
[SPEAKER_05]: AllGamesRadio.com

68
00:05:05,396 --> 00:05:06,017
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

69
00:05:32,815 --> 00:05:39,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, California Extreme is a classic arcade and pinball type of expo thing.

70
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:46,142
[SPEAKER_08]: And they have, uh, speakers, d-panels, you know, typical convention stuff, but all the games are out there on free play.

71
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:51,745
[SPEAKER_08]: And they've got, like, pins dating back from the 50s and up.

72
00:05:52,745 --> 00:05:57,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, they even had the Iron Man pinball there, which, by the way, was not very exciting, because

73
00:05:57,868 --> 00:05:59,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Stern, sorry, you sucked at this one.

74
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:04,889
[SPEAKER_05]: I was way more interested in the Dark Knight table they had a picture of, but didn't actually have there.

75
00:06:05,049 --> 00:06:07,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's supposed to be pretty hardcore.

76
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Do they have Big Bang Bar, though?

77
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:15,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad the people that bring... And it was the real Big Bang Bar, not the... Because they got the rights to redo Big Bang Bar.

78
00:06:16,312 --> 00:06:19,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I gotta rewind, because you know how disjointed I'm gonna be tonight.

79
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:27,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Big Bang Bar was a table they were only like 16 prototypes of that Capcom's pinball division did before they decided to not do that anymore.

80
00:06:28,134 --> 00:06:56,732
[SPEAKER_08]: and um they eventually did the rights did get out and someone was doing reproductions of them but this was one of the 16 prototypes so it was pretty cool um anyway um they had like they had the Star Wars pachinko machine they had old pong they had a game called touch me it was clearly it was very 70s um cocktail tables sit downs um a really nice Star Wars arcade

81
00:06:56,932 --> 00:06:59,974
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of like going into Microsoft's game room, but for real.

82
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:00,774
[SPEAKER_05]: And Journey.

83
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if it was a real place.

84
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:06,918
[SPEAKER_05]: They just take this ballroom and just lots of arcade and more pinball than I was expecting.

85
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't realize how much of it was dominated by pinball.

86
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,501
[SPEAKER_08]: They had Ultra Pin there, too.

87
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:14,683
[SPEAKER_08]: The Ultra Kade pinball thing.

88
00:07:14,703 --> 00:07:15,544
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a cool machine.

89
00:07:15,584 --> 00:07:16,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Pinbot on that.

90
00:07:16,744 --> 00:07:17,165
[SPEAKER_05]: It was cool.

91
00:07:17,245 --> 00:07:18,485
[SPEAKER_08]: I've played one of those before.

92
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:22,008
[SPEAKER_08]: I played Black Knight for a while on there, but it's not the same for me.

93
00:07:22,168 --> 00:07:24,049
[SPEAKER_03]: I've wanted to make one of those, but it really...

94
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:25,614
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cost prohibitive.

95
00:07:26,215 --> 00:07:27,135
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really expensive.

96
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:38,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I have an extra TV that I could use for that, but it's just, I don't play that much pinball, and considering how much I play my arcade machine, I don't need to build one of these.

97
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:45,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me go to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com because we do get live chat comments as we tape the show, and I'm going to start with Salacious Pop tonight.

98
00:07:46,021 --> 00:07:47,041
[SPEAKER_05]: He was there with us yesterday.

99
00:07:47,081 --> 00:07:48,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Salacious Pop in our chat says, Hi!

100
00:07:48,822 --> 00:07:48,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi!

101
00:07:49,182 --> 00:07:55,488
[SPEAKER_05]: I played a few rounds of Lethal Weapon 3 pinball but try as I might I could not unlock the hidden racist misogynist screed

102
00:07:57,888 --> 00:08:03,892
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hoping they would update the pinball machine so that when the ball goes down the gutter it would yell at you, I deserve to be blown!

103
00:08:04,553 --> 00:08:06,194
[SPEAKER_05]: But unfortunately, no.

104
00:08:06,334 --> 00:08:06,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Not gonna happen.

105
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:09,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, sorry.

106
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:10,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Classic games.

107
00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:11,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

108
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:12,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Free play!

109
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:14,240
[SPEAKER_05]: You pay one fee to get in.

110
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,361
[SPEAKER_05]: It was $40 to get in.

111
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:16,862
[SPEAKER_08]: I got in for nothing.

112
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:20,224
[SPEAKER_08]: I got in as press for Geek Life.

113
00:08:20,524 --> 00:08:25,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, by the way, there's gonna be a big write-up on this showing up tomorrow morning on both Orange Knowledge Radio and on Geek Life.

114
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:29,582
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a geeky time while I was there.

115
00:08:30,283 --> 00:08:33,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I was playing a real gyrus machine and a real time pilot machine.

116
00:08:33,424 --> 00:08:35,645
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't emulate that so well on the 360.

117
00:08:35,705 --> 00:08:42,549
[SPEAKER_08]: The Tempest kept having problems with the vector display.

118
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:45,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Crystal Castles with a real trackball the way it was meant to be played.

119
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,971
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a trackball for it on the 5200.

120
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:52,073
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this is going to surprise people.

121
00:08:52,153 --> 00:08:55,095
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe I had ever played the Empire Strikes Back game.

122
00:08:55,575 --> 00:08:56,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it great?

123
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:56,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Star Wars?

124
00:08:57,056 --> 00:08:57,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

125
00:08:57,476 --> 00:08:58,636
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Star Wars Vector game?

126
00:08:59,457 --> 00:09:00,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, that game was epic.

127
00:09:01,578 --> 00:09:02,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man, I love that game.

128
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:11,142
[SPEAKER_08]: That one, the one that they had there, the sit-down one, had like this really nice bright monitor and the speakers were just so clear.

129
00:09:11,242 --> 00:09:12,422
[SPEAKER_08]: It was fantastic.

130
00:09:12,482 --> 00:09:14,023
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't sound muddy or anything at all.

131
00:09:14,323 --> 00:09:16,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Though I got a bad headache playing it and it hurt my hand a lot.

132
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:24,585
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't really play a whole bunch of stuff while I was there because... And we'll probably go into the surgery thing later.

133
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,226
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got eight stitches in my right hand.

134
00:09:26,426 --> 00:09:26,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

135
00:09:27,086 --> 00:09:37,948
[SPEAKER_08]: And while I'm healing really nicely, they hurt a lot because unlike my last surgery when I moved my hand, I've got more range of motion now, but it pulls the stitches.

136
00:09:38,688 --> 00:09:39,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Ew.

137
00:09:39,168 --> 00:09:41,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, it'll bleed a little bit.

138
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:42,289
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really...

139
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:45,970
[SPEAKER_05]: But you were able to play some stuff.

140
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,530
[SPEAKER_05]: I played some stuff.

141
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,430
[SPEAKER_08]: I played Baby Pac-Man.

142
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,590
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to play Baby Pac-Man.

143
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:48,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Me too.

144
00:09:49,251 --> 00:09:53,172
[SPEAKER_08]: And that game, for being notoriously hard, I always remembered being kind of good at it.

145
00:09:53,272 --> 00:09:56,873
[SPEAKER_08]: And I got to the third stage, which is not bad for Baby Pac-Man.

146
00:09:58,093 --> 00:10:02,095
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a Junior Pac-Man, which is like one of the really epic Pac-Mans of its day.

147
00:10:03,475 --> 00:10:07,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, I played Big Bang Bar and Iron Man Pinball.

148
00:10:08,377 --> 00:10:08,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

149
00:10:10,537 --> 00:10:12,898
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't play Journey.

150
00:10:13,298 --> 00:10:14,199
[SPEAKER_08]: I played Star Wars.

151
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:14,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Journey.

152
00:10:14,859 --> 00:10:15,379
[SPEAKER_05]: It was awesome.

153
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:18,200
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Timber twice because I love those old school.

154
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:34,206
[SPEAKER_08]: I played Mousetrap and then Mousetrap though is the big mistake because Mousetrap has a right hand joystick and I was like and I forgot about the stupid bird because keep in mind when I was playing a lot of Mousetrap I was playing it on the Clicca Vision and there's no bird in the Clicca Vision.

155
00:10:34,588 --> 00:10:35,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there every year?

156
00:10:50,842 --> 00:10:53,825
[SPEAKER_05]: to like pour some sugar on me.

157
00:10:53,845 --> 00:10:55,626
[SPEAKER_08]: On the little four cube TV?

158
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:55,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

159
00:10:56,007 --> 00:10:57,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's there every year.

160
00:10:57,308 --> 00:10:59,530
[SPEAKER_05]: One of those TVs that's made up of little TVs.

161
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,151
[SPEAKER_05]: It was awesome.

162
00:11:00,231 --> 00:11:01,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, totally 80s style.

163
00:11:01,852 --> 00:11:03,414
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's more, Rob.

164
00:11:03,554 --> 00:11:04,154
[SPEAKER_08]: There's more.

165
00:11:04,435 --> 00:11:04,595
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

166
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:05,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Coin Toss was there.

167
00:11:06,657 --> 00:11:07,738
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the Coin Toss game.

168
00:11:07,878 --> 00:11:10,280
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like one of the old 50s games.

169
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,181
[SPEAKER_08]: It was so fantastic.

170
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Like one of the precursors to our Pong.

171
00:11:14,773 --> 00:11:22,395
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, there was the box car game, the Sega box car game.

172
00:11:23,196 --> 00:11:24,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, the mine car.

173
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:27,517
[SPEAKER_05]: You actually push up and down on the big lever like an old mine car.

174
00:11:27,537 --> 00:11:28,357
[SPEAKER_05]: It was funny.

175
00:11:28,377 --> 00:11:32,638
[SPEAKER_08]: And Top Skater and DDR something or the other.

176
00:11:32,838 --> 00:11:33,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Extreme.

177
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:36,039
[SPEAKER_08]: I took some video of Mel and Ali playing.

178
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:37,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually got up there and played DDR.

179
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not allowed to.

180
00:11:39,221 --> 00:11:40,062
[SPEAKER_05]: How mad am I out of shape?

181
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,584
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not allowed to play DDR until my stitches come out.

182
00:11:42,624 --> 00:11:42,845
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

183
00:11:43,105 --> 00:11:43,926
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't get my heart rate up.

184
00:11:43,946 --> 00:11:44,486
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't miss much.

185
00:11:44,686 --> 00:11:48,470
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not supposed to get my heart rate up, y'all, so I can't get very excited tonight.

186
00:11:49,871 --> 00:11:51,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking at our chat room at chat.orangeonsradio.com.

187
00:11:53,815 --> 00:11:54,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I always say this name wrong.

188
00:11:55,055 --> 00:11:57,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Shirzo in our chatroom says, sounds like a nice spot.

189
00:11:57,856 --> 00:11:59,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn, I need to plan to get out to California Extreme.

190
00:12:00,217 --> 00:12:01,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I think he's kind of local here.

191
00:12:01,957 --> 00:12:02,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he's our guy.

192
00:12:02,617 --> 00:12:03,758
[SPEAKER_05]: It was in Santa Clara.

193
00:12:03,778 --> 00:12:05,738
[SPEAKER_05]: That does the Roseville Golf Line and everything.

194
00:12:05,778 --> 00:12:09,059
[SPEAKER_05]: But would this be something worth traveling to?

195
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:09,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.

196
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:10,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally.

197
00:12:10,739 --> 00:12:13,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there were people there from out of country.

198
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,662
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they could... I mean, here's the weird thing.

199
00:12:16,742 --> 00:12:23,346
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an arcade trade show, so I get that they don't want to expand on probably that core part of it.

200
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:29,530
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what would have made that expo even more awesome would have been a classic gaming room with console stuff.

201
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,391
[SPEAKER_08]: That reminds me.

202
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:35,394
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that might be outside the scope of what they're trying to do, but... Classic gaming expo is coming back.

203
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:36,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah?

204
00:12:36,918 --> 00:12:37,599
[SPEAKER_08]: In Las Vegas.

205
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,059
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to make plans.

206
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:41,460
[SPEAKER_05]: This was different from Classic Gaming Expo though.

207
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Classic Gaming Expo was its own kind of thing.

208
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:50,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Classic Gaming Expo was more like booths and things set up to remember but this was just straight up a room full of free play games.

209
00:12:50,584 --> 00:12:59,988
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the story though about because Dan's little brother Mason came with us and they were at this panel and Mason's like, who's that?

210
00:13:00,008 --> 00:13:00,688
[SPEAKER_08]: What did that guy do?

211
00:13:00,748 --> 00:13:01,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Make Atari?

212
00:13:01,428 --> 00:13:03,409
[SPEAKER_08]: And Dan's like, why yes, he actually did.

213
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:04,470
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was the...

214
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:11,513
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to meet Steve Ritchie who designed at least a couple of the tables that we have in this house.

215
00:13:12,554 --> 00:13:13,014
[SPEAKER_08]: No Fear.

216
00:13:13,214 --> 00:13:14,695
[SPEAKER_08]: He did the voices for No Fear.

217
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:20,418
[SPEAKER_08]: I gave him some of our plastics to sign and he started doing the voices from No Fear.

218
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:22,620
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just so cool.

219
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,200
[SPEAKER_08]: I talked to his wife.

220
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,000
[SPEAKER_08]: She's a really sweet lady.

221
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,302
[SPEAKER_08]: I told her about a pinball table that I'm designing.

222
00:13:27,922 --> 00:13:31,324
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually designing the art and everything and the layout for a pinball table.

223
00:13:31,384 --> 00:13:32,525
[SPEAKER_08]: I just need someone who can program it.

224
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:37,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Vid Power in our chatroom says, California Extreme was in the Donkey Kong documentary, King of Kong.

225
00:13:37,499 --> 00:13:38,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember that.

226
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:40,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that the place they go?

227
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,420
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was a place on the East Coast.

228
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:53,083
[SPEAKER_05]: But they go, it's like an exposition's going on, and Billy, not Billy, the other guy, Steve, tries to top the score at this expo, but he just barely misses it.

229
00:13:53,143 --> 00:13:53,663
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't do it.

230
00:13:53,683 --> 00:13:57,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no, he did this at conventions since, I thought.

231
00:13:57,343 --> 00:13:58,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know.

232
00:13:58,424 --> 00:13:59,424
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway...

233
00:14:00,044 --> 00:14:02,105
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Steve Wiebe's been, I think, at these conventions.

234
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:07,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and all those types of guys you see in that documentary are here at this type of event.

235
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:08,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

236
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:17,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, though, and then there were vendors for pinball parts and, you know, a Stern marketer was there, the guy who brought the Iron Man table.

237
00:14:18,753 --> 00:14:25,857
[SPEAKER_08]: And the guy that plays the 12-string guitar thing was there because he's there every year and he's always really cool.

238
00:14:26,537 --> 00:14:55,619
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had this I giggled to myself and I walked I was walking sort of catty corner around and all of a sudden in the distance I hear bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk the Space Invaders thing and then there's also one of our listeners there really cool guy Carlson really cool guy and I purchased a game from him from my husband got him got Gunstar Heroes for the Game Gear

239
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Treasure!

240
00:14:58,391 --> 00:15:01,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I was surprised to see him there because the last time I had seen him was out in Washington, D.C.

241
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:04,176
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's based in the East Coast and is mostly the cons out there.

242
00:15:04,576 --> 00:15:07,319
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess he has a relative that lives out here.

243
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:08,920
[SPEAKER_05]: So he was at this con.

244
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:17,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Very random moment because I was actually looking at the shirts at his booth and he has this really funny, I guess it's his own original design, it says like Shaq Fu

245
00:15:17,307 --> 00:15:46,188
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved that and I almost I like was thinking about buying it but then I got distracted because he's like hey Rob and like I was like oh wow I remember you from like four years ago so this is kind of funny like running into people well he recognized me and I didn't know who he was or anything well it was funny I was looking for you to go introduce you to him when you just found him on your own oh good times you just cut out suddenly did your switch go down

246
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,441
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't have a Switch.

247
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:47,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, weird.

248
00:15:48,622 --> 00:15:49,162
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what happened.

249
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:51,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, meh.

250
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight is going to be a night of technical fun.

251
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:55,508
[SPEAKER_08]: The soundboard's on Vicodin.

252
00:15:55,808 --> 00:16:04,696
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, before we get to the rest of our gaming weeks outside of, oh boy, outside of just this convention, is there anything else you want to say about California Extreme?

253
00:16:04,716 --> 00:16:06,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe the thing you most want to see them do next year?

254
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Do it exactly like they did it and make it cheaper.

255
00:16:12,303 --> 00:16:12,663
[SPEAKER_05]: And bigger.

256
00:16:13,204 --> 00:16:13,624
[SPEAKER_08]: And bigger.

257
00:16:14,484 --> 00:16:16,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, bring back the Kung Fu game.

258
00:16:16,706 --> 00:16:18,567
[SPEAKER_08]: What game wasn't there at Kung Fu Master?

259
00:16:19,248 --> 00:16:19,808
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't there.

260
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:24,291
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and, and, damn it, somebody bring a theater of magic.

261
00:16:24,992 --> 00:16:26,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Melody and I were annoyed.

262
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:27,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

263
00:16:28,594 --> 00:16:30,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, DarkSakura, I know you had the surgery.

264
00:16:30,676 --> 00:16:34,298
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you've been playing a lot of video games, but outside the expo, did you play any video games this week?

265
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:35,119
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your gaming week?

266
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:36,810
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm playing Sims right now.

267
00:16:38,152 --> 00:16:40,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Um... I was playing some Sims.

268
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:49,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Um... I tried to play Star Trek Online, but it hurt too much, so I just went on to let my fleetmates know that I wasn't dead of gangrene of the hand.

269
00:16:50,403 --> 00:16:51,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Um... Um...

270
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan beat Crackdown, finally.

271
00:16:55,577 --> 00:16:56,957
[SPEAKER_08]: It was anticlimactic.

272
00:16:56,977 --> 00:16:57,517
[SPEAKER_08]: First one or the new one?

273
00:16:57,537 --> 00:16:58,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Second one.

274
00:16:58,097 --> 00:16:58,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.

275
00:16:58,538 --> 00:16:59,458
[SPEAKER_08]: It was anticlimactic.

276
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:03,799
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also really hate the guy in that game.

277
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,760
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, are you trying to piss me off?

278
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:09,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Go back to the tactical location.

279
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,062
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to tell him, shut up and bite my butt.

280
00:17:12,122 --> 00:17:15,003
[SPEAKER_08]: You sound like you've got a wedgie.

281
00:17:17,684 --> 00:17:21,145
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know I played something else.

282
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:23,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

283
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:26,694
[SPEAKER_04]: You're too high to remember.

284
00:17:26,994 --> 00:17:27,775
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.

285
00:17:27,795 --> 00:17:29,757
[SPEAKER_08]: You're playing The Sims right now?

286
00:17:29,777 --> 00:17:31,499
[SPEAKER_08]: I said I was playing The Sims.

287
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I played a little bit of Portal.

288
00:17:34,322 --> 00:17:35,083
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit of Portal.

289
00:17:35,423 --> 00:17:36,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a little bit?

290
00:17:36,204 --> 00:17:36,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a little bit.

291
00:17:37,585 --> 00:17:39,868
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like... Just enough to get taunted by GLaDOS?

292
00:17:40,248 --> 00:17:46,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was just like, I'm getting so bored not being able to do much of anything that I'll sit and start to play something.

293
00:17:46,491 --> 00:17:57,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Like with The Sims, at least, you know, I can do a little bit and rest my hand, but if I get in the middle of a battle on Star Trek Online, I'm there until it's done, because you can't actually pause it unless you're on a away mission.

294
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, MMOs don't usually have a pause button.

295
00:17:59,538 --> 00:17:59,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

296
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:03,500
[SPEAKER_08]: The only ones of those you can pause are the ones you're on there by yourself.

297
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:04,660
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

298
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:05,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

299
00:18:05,861 --> 00:18:07,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and it's only 45 seconds, meh.

300
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:09,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's try Loki.

301
00:18:09,771 --> 00:18:10,731
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week, Loki?

302
00:18:11,312 --> 00:18:12,692
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't play a whole lot because I was paying.

303
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,494
[SPEAKER_03]: So, really, the only stuff I played was at work.

304
00:18:15,534 --> 00:18:16,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Gloria Paint!

305
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:17,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Literally!

306
00:18:18,235 --> 00:18:18,696
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

307
00:18:19,216 --> 00:18:20,056
[SPEAKER_03]: That is true.

308
00:18:21,257 --> 00:18:26,140
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the only things that I played this week was... Actually, Grand Theft Auto, but...

309
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:30,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of funny, we didn't really play much of the Battle of the Gay Tony this week.

310
00:18:30,574 --> 00:18:40,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently my co-workers are tired of me kicking the crap out of them at the Battle of the Gay Tony, so they went back to Lost and Damned, so I had to kick the crap out of them in Lost and Damned.

311
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:41,737
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's fun.

312
00:18:41,797 --> 00:18:42,677
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice little break.

313
00:18:42,857 --> 00:18:50,139
[SPEAKER_03]: I just... I always forgot how slow the characters run, and oh my god, they run so damn slow in that game.

314
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,120
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.

315
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,741
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if they've remembered it being...

316
00:18:56,381 --> 00:18:57,262
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

317
00:19:15,135 --> 00:19:16,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Crackdown 2, played a little bit of that.

318
00:19:16,897 --> 00:19:30,827
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing I don't like about Crackdown 2, well, there's many things I don't like about Crackdown 2, but one of the new things I don't like about Crackdown 2 was our internet at my work is not the greatest because we're sharing it with like 80 computers.

319
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:31,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's ridiculous.

320
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Crackdown 2 Crackdown 2 Crackdown 2

321
00:19:55,163 --> 00:19:55,904
[SPEAKER_03]: It's impossible.

322
00:19:56,164 --> 00:20:04,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I can join another person's game away from our work, but it will not allow me to connect to a person that's literally next to me.

323
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that maybe because the game is seeing you guys in the same room?

324
00:20:07,431 --> 00:20:08,292
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not.

325
00:20:08,412 --> 00:20:13,575
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason is it's saying that our connection is too strict.

326
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:18,539
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically layman's terms for our internet connection is too slow.

327
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:25,023
[SPEAKER_05]: I do just want to point out though, Loki, you do know most people don't get to play Xbox at their jobs, right?

328
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:26,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Just throwing that out there.

329
00:20:26,624 --> 00:20:37,608
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that, but I'm just saying during our break, we wanted to play some co-op Crackdown 2, which would have been really fun, but we can't do that and say we have to play Lost and Damned.

330
00:20:39,849 --> 00:20:44,431
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just wish that they... First off, I wish they just had System Link back from the first game.

331
00:20:45,131 --> 00:20:46,612
[SPEAKER_03]: That would solve all the problems right there.

332
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:58,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, most of the problems, because even Red Dead Redemption is a good testament to how Take-Two and Rockstar games still find ways to fuck up multiplayer.

333
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:04,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Even in Red Dead Redemption, it sometimes can't find the other people.

334
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:05,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we'll be...

335
00:21:06,684 --> 00:21:07,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Red Dead Redemption

336
00:21:35,982 --> 00:21:37,263
[SPEAKER_03]: How the fuck does that happen?

337
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:43,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I have never seen a System Link game not figure out how to connect to another System Link console.

338
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:44,605
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't make any sense.

339
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:46,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Only Rockstar could do that.

340
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:51,928
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so that's about all I played this week.

341
00:21:52,749 --> 00:22:01,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully going to play more once we get the Baby's Room done because we're under a deadline here and I have a little bit of work left to do.

342
00:22:03,273 --> 00:22:03,853
[SPEAKER_03]: It's looking good.

343
00:22:04,563 --> 00:22:26,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well good luck with the rest of that, and our well wishes to the misses as well, and through all that My Gaming Week, outside of California Extreme, I've been playing mostly the same stuff, I didn't get into a lot of new stuff I would say the newest thing I played was some of the extensions that they have in Game Room now You know, some of the recent games that they released, but of course that's just really old stuff with new paint on it

344
00:22:26,898 --> 00:22:48,665
[SPEAKER_05]: and I can't tell you how horrifically games like Kaboom and Crystal Castles and things that ran on the Xbox I mean things that ran on like trackballs and paddles how horrifically they translate into the Xbox 360 controls but there are some other cool stuff on there that I was playing like Hero, H-E-R-O was still one of my favorite games

345
00:22:49,205 --> 00:23:06,645
[SPEAKER_05]: they did some changes to game room this week too where now you have like a live leaderboard as you are playing the game you watch yourself climb up this live leaderboard on the right hand side of the screen that's actually really cool so um I kinda was a fan of that that's only a ranked match by the way so you have to actually own the game to be able to see that but um

346
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:09,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Xen, Pinball, and Pinball FX Big Battle

347
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:30,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the response from the listenership so far has been a little bit tepid, but I'll get into that in a little bit.

348
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,751
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was trying to help represent OLR in that, and I tried.

349
00:23:34,011 --> 00:23:37,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't get at the top of leaderboard, but at least I got on it.

350
00:23:37,653 --> 00:23:38,834
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm happy with that.

351
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:42,917
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hadn't really played especially the one on the PS3.

352
00:23:43,237 --> 00:23:48,380
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I appreciated it enough, but that Earth Defense Force table on PS3 is actually a lot of fun.

353
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,264
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually kind of enjoyed getting to spend a little time with it this week as much as I was not...

354
00:23:54,784 --> 00:23:55,064
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

355
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,821
[SPEAKER_05]: So since I brought up the big battle, let's go into housekeeping here tonight before we get into tonight's gaming news.

356
00:24:23,841 --> 00:24:32,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Big battle is all games kind of competition with these various video games throughout all the different shows on all games.

357
00:24:32,703 --> 00:24:33,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, most of them.

358
00:24:33,663 --> 00:24:42,585
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think all of them signed up, but quite a few are participating like Dead Pixel Live, TQ Cast, RPG Grinders, Electric Sisterhood, all these other shows on the network.

359
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:44,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I didn't name them all, but they're all there.

360
00:24:44,885 --> 00:25:09,613
[SPEAKER_05]: at TheBigBattle.net and it's really just for fun it's not although I hear now there's a prize I got an email this week that now there is a prize so get this the winning show and this is not about the hosts of the show doing battle with each other although I'm choosing to participate this is about the listenerships representing the shows in these battles well the winning show now as I understand it is going to get a gold Atari 2600

361
00:25:11,373 --> 00:25:16,495
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like, I think it's just spray painted gold, but it will be an Atari trophy.

362
00:25:17,036 --> 00:25:19,957
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know DarkSakura is dying to have one of those in the vault.

363
00:25:20,317 --> 00:25:26,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, I do think if we get a gold Atari 2600, we should maybe, I don't know, give it to a listener that helped us get it.

364
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe, I don't know.

365
00:25:28,321 --> 00:25:28,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Go for it.

366
00:25:28,721 --> 00:25:29,481
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have to decide.

367
00:25:29,641 --> 00:25:36,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, if I really wanted a gold Atari 2600, I would go find one of ours and get a can of Rust-Oleum.

368
00:25:36,765 --> 00:25:37,985
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the meaning behind it.

369
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:39,946
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't mean the same when you do it that way.

370
00:25:40,186 --> 00:25:42,770
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, but I'm just saying we can give it to somebody.

371
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'll tell you right now, the way the leaderboards look, we ain't gonna get it.

372
00:25:46,174 --> 00:25:47,676
[SPEAKER_05]: We are in second place.

373
00:25:47,956 --> 00:25:49,919
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna win a gold 32X.

374
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:52,362
[SPEAKER_05]: But we are way behind Dead Pixel Live.

375
00:25:52,382 --> 00:25:54,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Dead Pixel Live has 164 points.

376
00:25:54,425 --> 00:25:56,808
[SPEAKER_05]: We have 42, which has us in second place.

377
00:25:57,709 --> 00:26:00,131
[SPEAKER_05]: How many things have already completed already?

378
00:26:01,032 --> 00:26:05,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I think three, but there's still more going on right now.

379
00:26:05,895 --> 00:26:07,516
[SPEAKER_05]: We got off to a little bit of a slow start.

380
00:26:07,576 --> 00:26:13,661
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole thing started right when E3 was going on, and then my birthday and the fourth were all in there.

381
00:26:14,161 --> 00:26:19,385
[SPEAKER_05]: It took a little while, I think, for us to really get in there, but there's more games happening.

382
00:26:19,525 --> 00:26:26,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of the early feedback we got was, I don't have Soldner X, and I don't really have the pinball game, so what's there for me to play?

383
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Derek's been very open to putting stuff in there.

384
00:26:30,051 --> 00:26:32,552
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can tell you, and it looks like it's scheduled now.

385
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:33,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even know it got a date.

386
00:26:33,672 --> 00:26:35,713
[SPEAKER_05]: But it looks like it's going to happen on August 1st.

387
00:26:36,153 --> 00:26:37,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Street Fighter 4.

388
00:26:38,353 --> 00:26:41,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I know tons of you bitches have that game.

389
00:26:41,194 --> 00:26:41,914
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll make Dan play.

390
00:26:41,955 --> 00:26:42,655
[SPEAKER_05]: And can represent.

391
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:45,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Get Dan to sign up at TheBigBattle.net and represent the OLR.

392
00:26:46,016 --> 00:26:46,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Because seriously.

393
00:26:47,396 --> 00:27:10,692
[SPEAKER_05]: If we lose Super Street Fighter 4 or we don't have good representation of Super Street Fighter 4 We're just going to kiss that gold Atari thing goodbye Because it ain't happening This is a game that I know we can do well at I'll blame everybody personally Yes, I will be blaming certain individuals that are very, very good at Super Street Fighter If you don't participate in this, unless you have a really good reason I will blame you personally

394
00:27:12,293 --> 00:27:17,777
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's, yeah, TheBigBattle.net, and it's August 1st, and sign up and participate.

395
00:27:17,797 --> 00:27:18,537
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are other games.

396
00:27:18,577 --> 00:27:22,920
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not a Street Fighter person, Forza's going on right now, and I wonder if we have people in Forza.

397
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I'll tell you this.

398
00:27:24,181 --> 00:27:27,122
[SPEAKER_05]: So far, we can really thank Arcadian42.

399
00:27:27,483 --> 00:27:29,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Really made a good showing for us in Pinball.

400
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:34,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, he got us seven points on Zen Pinball, and he got us another seven points on Pinball FX.

401
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:39,110
[SPEAKER_05]: I got us like four on one and three on the other.

402
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:40,470
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's see.

403
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:44,353
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually have Monty Boggs participated and got us three points on Pinball FX.

404
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:48,575
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, Arcadian42, Monty Boggs, and me.

405
00:27:49,136 --> 00:27:52,458
[SPEAKER_05]: The rest of you all, you need to go find a game you can help us out with.

406
00:27:52,518 --> 00:27:53,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm injured.

407
00:27:53,578 --> 00:27:53,879
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

408
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:54,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine.

409
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:57,621
[SPEAKER_05]: You can sit on the bench due to injury, but depending on how long this thing goes.

410
00:27:57,741 --> 00:27:58,742
[SPEAKER_08]: A B-R-O-N done.

411
00:27:58,902 --> 00:27:59,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at this.

412
00:27:59,282 --> 00:27:59,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at this.

413
00:27:59,582 --> 00:27:59,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at this.

414
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:00,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Burr.

415
00:28:01,443 --> 00:28:04,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Eight points on Forza Motorsport 3 right now.

416
00:28:04,545 --> 00:28:32,107
[SPEAKER_05]: way to go Burr you rock keep up the good work and there's also Super Stardust HD is the other competition going on right now and I oh we holy crap we are leading the leaderboard right now in Super Stardust HD who is Zooey who is a Z-O-O-I I don't recognize that name from chat I don't know who Zooey is but that's from us to you because you're currently kicking butt in Super Stardust HD good job

417
00:28:34,358 --> 00:28:36,280
[SPEAKER_05]: and Battlefield Bad Company 2 is also happening.

418
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,241
[SPEAKER_05]: So there it is.

419
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:38,041
[SPEAKER_05]: BigBattle.net.

[SPEAKER_05]: Have fun.

421
00:28:39,743 --> 00:28:46,548
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya says in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com I thought I heard a rumor there was going to be a music game in an upcoming battle.

422
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:53,995
[SPEAKER_05]: I have heard that same rumor meaning that it's probably going to happen but it probably won't happen until after some of these other competitions happen.

423
00:28:54,475 --> 00:28:55,075
[SPEAKER_05]: So go for it.

424
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:56,637
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

425
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Other housekeeping I wanted to get to tonight.

426
00:29:01,874 --> 00:29:02,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to talk about the feed.

427
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:08,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people shouldn't notice this, but the podcast feed actually moved this past week.

428
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:15,485
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to take a minute to thank Deekman and Jason, VXJasonXV, who do a lot of work on our website.

429
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:16,566
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll tell you, Deekman...

430
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:37,498
[SPEAKER_05]: he kind of did this whole thing where he moved our podcast and he's doing it so that way usually when I post a show it takes like 24 hours for it to show up on the website because someone has to go in there manually and do it but that won't happen anymore like when I post a show it will be instant so most people are going to be able to get their shows faster and that's going to be really good news so

431
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:47,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping nobody notices the differences, but if you do, just sit tight while we are under construction a little bit.

432
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:56,633
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm hoping if you're listening to this show and you're on the podcast feed, then clearly your feed player and all that updated and noticed the change just fine.

433
00:29:56,653 --> 00:29:58,115
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't need to do a darn thing.

434
00:29:58,595 --> 00:30:06,982
[SPEAKER_05]: And for those that did not move, Jason was kind enough to record a little special message that will show up over there for those folks that know they have to resubscribe.

435
00:30:07,302 --> 00:30:34,594
[SPEAKER_05]: so I'm hoping that is all better and all that good stuff now so that's just some maintenance going on on the website and also an excuse for me to thank the guys that make it happen Deekman and VXJSXV like Deekman put together this whole little like training manual like here's how you post to the website step one it's like the type of thing I do at my day job and we pay him nothing because we have nothing so it's very much appreciated by all of us as all of you listening should appreciate it too

436
00:30:35,779 --> 00:30:38,080
[SPEAKER_05]: How about some actual bonafide gaming news now?

437
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,440
[SPEAKER_05]: We ready?

438
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,681
[SPEAKER_05]: 30 minutes into the show, we're gonna touch on some gaming news.

439
00:30:41,442 --> 00:30:44,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what is going on in the world of PlayStation?

440
00:30:44,603 --> 00:30:45,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely nothing.

441
00:30:45,884 --> 00:30:46,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

442
00:30:47,705 --> 00:30:52,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, in September, there will be some stuff going on, including the 3D Blu-ray support.

443
00:30:53,207 --> 00:30:53,647
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

444
00:31:17,522 --> 00:31:24,211
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, with that, there's also going to be some... Wait, wait, isn't the regular Blu-ray just happen to be regular and 3D?

445
00:31:24,231 --> 00:31:26,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you buy a special 3D Blu-ray.

446
00:31:28,143 --> 00:31:32,386
[SPEAKER_05]: So you could own the movie and just not have a 3D TV because they're kind of pricey right now, right?

447
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:35,148
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I do believe that it's actually a different movie.

448
00:31:35,328 --> 00:31:36,449
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a 3D Blu-ray.

449
00:31:36,749 --> 00:31:38,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, I didn't even know that existed.

450
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:47,035
[SPEAKER_03]: The regular movie you can watch, I think, with the glasses, the magenta cyan or the red-blue stuff.

451
00:31:48,076 --> 00:31:54,340
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, this actually requires a special... You have to buy your movies all over again, yes, just in case you thought, you know...

452
00:31:55,885 --> 00:31:56,625
[SPEAKER_03]: BlueRay was enough.

453
00:31:57,266 --> 00:31:58,806
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want them in 3D, you've got to buy them again.

454
00:31:59,026 --> 00:31:59,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, great.

455
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:02,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's, you know, more expensive that way.

456
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:12,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, there's going to be some additional support for, apparently, Play TV in Europe is going to be in 3D as well.

457
00:32:12,712 --> 00:32:18,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Different broadcasts through that, as well as YouTube supporting 3D content over the next 12 months as well.

458
00:32:18,815 --> 00:32:21,976
[SPEAKER_03]: So there'll be 3D YouTube stuff, which...

459
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:26,289
[SPEAKER_03]: It begs the question, and this is my thing.

460
00:32:26,709 --> 00:32:27,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

461
00:32:29,012 --> 00:32:30,173
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be the second question.

462
00:32:30,353 --> 00:32:30,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

463
00:32:30,973 --> 00:32:40,502
[SPEAKER_03]: The first question is, I understand, okay, YouTube, okay, great, we've got 3D YouTube, but as far as I'm aware, there's not really 3D film cameras.

464
00:32:40,582 --> 00:32:44,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I can't go out there and buy a camera that shoots in 3D yet.

465
00:32:46,412 --> 00:32:50,095
[SPEAKER_05]: YouTube isn't just underground stuff right now.

466
00:32:50,355 --> 00:32:53,637
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of big studios who use YouTube to push their stuff.

467
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:57,400
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that, but I'm not going to be able to see...

468
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:04,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Some viral video or something like that, you know, in 3D normally.

469
00:33:04,642 --> 00:33:06,382
[SPEAKER_03]: And why?

470
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:08,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said, why bother?

471
00:33:10,344 --> 00:33:13,445
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because... This 3D thing is happening too fast for me.

472
00:33:13,705 --> 00:33:15,706
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know why that they're pushing it?

473
00:33:15,846 --> 00:33:16,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

474
00:33:16,126 --> 00:33:18,307
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because Sony is selling 3D TVs.

475
00:33:19,547 --> 00:33:25,049
[SPEAKER_03]: And Sony has movies, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, that happen to be in 3D Blu-ray.

476
00:33:25,489 --> 00:33:26,570
[SPEAKER_03]: They figure, hey, look!

477
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Look what we did for Blu-ray already.

478
00:33:29,231 --> 00:33:30,871
[SPEAKER_03]: We beat HD DVDs.

479
00:33:31,371 --> 00:33:33,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we can convince people to buy 3D Blu-ray.

480
00:33:33,892 --> 00:33:35,793
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're kind of like riding on a high right now?

481
00:33:36,113 --> 00:33:38,274
[SPEAKER_03]: They're basically thinking, you know what?

482
00:33:39,134 --> 00:33:45,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we may have fucked up UMD, but hey, we won in Blu-ray, and now we're going to try our hands at 3D Blu-ray.

483
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:46,496
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll print money!

484
00:33:47,477 --> 00:33:49,738
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have the... Here's my thing, though.

485
00:33:49,978 --> 00:33:50,378
[SPEAKER_03]: People...

486
00:33:51,578 --> 00:34:00,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people, not even all people nowadays, are willing to make the jump to Blu-ray because the picture quality is pretty good compared to a DVD.

487
00:34:01,857 --> 00:34:03,399
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

488
00:34:21,397 --> 00:34:23,439
[SPEAKER_03]: and so, yes, it is a bit early.

489
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:28,803
[SPEAKER_03]: It's why you're not seeing, you know, Microsoft jumping on the bandwagon with this stuff because it's way too damn early.

490
00:34:28,823 --> 00:34:33,547
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to be putting out 3D games because most people don't have the hardware to play them.

491
00:34:34,808 --> 00:34:37,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to chat.orangehonestradio.com and some comments there.

492
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:43,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Tiger Claw says, if the studios have their way, they will release the regular Blu-ray version and a couple months later, the 3D version.

493
00:34:43,795 --> 00:34:44,195
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

494
00:35:09,326 --> 00:35:13,028
[SPEAKER_03]: You're basically just shooting the theaters all over again because now what are they going to do?

495
00:35:13,348 --> 00:35:17,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm not going to the theater to watch an expensive 3D movie.

496
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,611
[SPEAKER_03]: I can watch those 3D movies at home.

497
00:35:18,691 --> 00:35:22,073
[SPEAKER_08]: And how many people remember this particular parallel happening in the video gaming industry?

498
00:35:23,094 --> 00:35:29,397
[SPEAKER_08]: When basically you could get a Dreamcast which basically ran things like a Naomi system back in the day.

499
00:35:31,218 --> 00:35:35,941
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a matter of consumer technology bypassing the mass technology.

500
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:42,469
[SPEAKER_03]: What comes down to is really Sony doesn't give a crap about movie theaters because they don't own movie theaters.

501
00:35:42,669 --> 00:35:48,291
[SPEAKER_03]: They sell movies to these movie theaters and they could care less if their technology is going to impede on their business.

502
00:35:50,652 --> 00:35:51,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just say this real quick?

503
00:35:51,632 --> 00:35:53,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think DarkSakura makes a good point.

504
00:35:53,973 --> 00:35:57,314
[SPEAKER_05]: I think things like the 3DO and the CDI come to mind.

505
00:35:57,775 --> 00:36:00,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Those things kind of, to me, feel like they were a little ahead of their time.

506
00:36:01,616 --> 00:36:07,119
[SPEAKER_05]: and like the technology was really cool but the games were kind of crap and too much money.

507
00:36:07,439 --> 00:36:08,039
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

508
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,502
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of that stuff was really ahead of its time.

509
00:36:14,304 --> 00:36:17,765
[SPEAKER_05]: I think all this stuff is a little too soon as well.

510
00:36:17,785 --> 00:36:22,126
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got other people in chat saying, Katsune in our chat room, yeah, I just got my HDTV.

511
00:36:22,206 --> 00:36:24,266
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to get a 3D TV anytime soon.

512
00:36:24,347 --> 00:36:25,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably never.

513
00:36:25,467 --> 00:36:28,007
[SPEAKER_05]: And Miyamoto also thinks the 3D thing is happening too soon.

514
00:36:28,287 --> 00:36:33,889
[SPEAKER_05]: But see, the 3DS, I'm a lot cooler with that because let me tell you the best thing about the 3DS.

515
00:36:34,249 --> 00:36:38,030
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a little lever on the right side and when you get sick of 3D, you just turn it down and it goes off.

516
00:36:38,871 --> 00:37:01,849
[SPEAKER_03]: The difference between the 3DS and the PS3 The PS3 to see 3D, it requires you to buy a bunch of additional hardware Glasses that are really expensive The TV that's really expensive The 3DS, you turn it on and you see 3D And if you don't want to see 3D, you turn the little slider down

517
00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:23,938
[SPEAKER_03]: and the great thing about that too is if you know games say for example don't want to use 3d but they want to have a really high resolution well not really high resolution but a pretty high resolution screen they could do that because now the amount of pixels that are on the second screen are nearly doubled and it's widescreen so you can do pseudo HD type stuff on there if you want to um

518
00:37:25,905 --> 00:37:31,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony's official guidelines for 3D gaming on the PS3 limit the displayed image to a resolution of 720p.

519
00:37:44,815 --> 00:37:54,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Even games that run natively at 1080p, like Super Stardust HD, are downscaled to 3D mode to two 720p images, one for each eye.

520
00:37:55,087 --> 00:37:57,129
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm guessing this is because...

521
00:37:59,071 --> 00:37:59,612
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

522
00:38:19,612 --> 00:38:31,148
[SPEAKER_03]: 1080p also expenses the 60 frames per second so for example Blu-ray movies run at 24 frames per second um

523
00:38:33,163 --> 00:38:34,604
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's interesting.

524
00:38:35,744 --> 00:38:38,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, with resolutions and stuff like that, I don't really think it matters.

525
00:38:38,685 --> 00:38:41,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you're looking at high def in 3D, it's not going to matter.

526
00:38:41,566 --> 00:38:42,226
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to look cool.

527
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:45,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether it's 1080p or 720p.

528
00:38:45,568 --> 00:38:48,329
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when you have the glasses on, you don't really give a shit.

529
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:51,590
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, oh damn, this is just horrible in the 720p.

530
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,731
[SPEAKER_03]: What am I, like, a peasant here?

531
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:57,152
[SPEAKER_03]: This is ridiculous.

532
00:38:58,052 --> 00:38:59,153
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not enough pee for me.

533
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:03,036
[SPEAKER_03]: I need more pee.

534
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:22,530
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing, though, kind of going back to this that I had to laugh about, and this isn't even really the 3D stuff, but it just kind of stuck out to me in my mind during the Sony press conference because it made no sense to me as far as an actual feature that you would advertise to your customers.

535
00:39:23,411 --> 00:39:26,293
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that they said regarding the PlayStation Move is like,

536
00:39:27,313 --> 00:39:28,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

537
00:39:42,703 --> 00:40:03,824
[SPEAKER_03]: and that was a feature that they threw out there and I'm like I've never seen people not able to put you know two different control schemes on one disc before because of disc space oh my god we can't fit why would you even put a separate copy of the game on the disc that's a little redundant if you ask me I'm trying to think I think you could go back like 15 years

538
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Nintendo, King Arthur

539
00:40:25,863 --> 00:40:31,386
[SPEAKER_03]: and because they were released later on would be those new play control games because they have the Wii Remote.

540
00:40:31,406 --> 00:40:33,408
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was added later and that does not count.

541
00:40:33,488 --> 00:40:35,109
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that is not something that they released.

542
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:38,551
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the equivalent of re-releasing the same movie on Blu-ray 3D.

543
00:40:38,751 --> 00:40:39,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

544
00:40:40,131 --> 00:40:44,474
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sorry, but nobody is making that argument.

545
00:40:44,614 --> 00:40:52,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, you know, you're going to have to buy a separate version of Halo 4, the Kinect version because we just can't fit it on those pesky DVDs.

546
00:40:53,499 --> 00:40:54,860
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to create a whole other game.

547
00:40:55,498 --> 00:40:56,218
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just stupid.

548
00:40:57,219 --> 00:41:01,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to another little side conversation in our chat room, SSJ100Matt is saying, do we really need 3D?

549
00:41:02,401 --> 00:41:05,143
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of the response is, no, no, no.

550
00:41:05,323 --> 00:41:06,343
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a stupid gimmick.

551
00:41:06,624 --> 00:41:15,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and then the other thing, if you want to argue it, 3D is obviously taking away some sort of processing power from your games.

552
00:41:15,948 --> 00:41:19,690
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're going to have to make the games slightly less powerful.

553
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:24,373
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta think that that's got a bottleneck somewhere.

554
00:41:24,393 --> 00:41:24,433
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

555
00:41:49,091 --> 00:42:14,249
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't think I've ever really experienced 3D where it was like oh my god blow my hair back amazing like this is just like when I went and saw Avatar in 3D I was like okay this is cool but I probably would have liked the movie just the same in 2D I wasn't like oh my god 3D was just everything I was moved to tears it was better than having my dick sucked it was amazing you know it just wasn't that amazing

556
00:42:14,963 --> 00:42:15,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, you know?

557
00:42:16,705 --> 00:42:17,867
[SPEAKER_05]: 3D was not necessary.

558
00:42:18,087 --> 00:42:25,577
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it actually added a very good dimension to the movie, but that was... It was neat, but... Wait, you wouldn't have felt the same way about the movie in 2D?

559
00:42:25,837 --> 00:42:30,143
[SPEAKER_08]: I probably would have liked it, but if I had seen them both side by side, my preference would go to the 3D.

560
00:42:31,665 --> 00:42:38,406
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's going to cost this much money to upgrade right now too, it has to be truly... Well, it's not cost effective right now.

561
00:42:39,567 --> 00:42:41,207
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's by no means cost effective.

562
00:42:41,407 --> 00:42:45,288
[SPEAKER_03]: And just wait anyways because it's only a matter of years before holograms.

563
00:42:45,348 --> 00:42:47,228
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're going to have to buy your hologram TV.

564
00:42:47,488 --> 00:42:49,749
[SPEAKER_05]: One step closer to the holodeck, as we always say.

565
00:42:49,789 --> 00:42:53,729
[SPEAKER_05]: That's gaming's ultimate goal is the holodeck from Star Trek The Next Generation.

566
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:56,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything is just one step closer to the holodeck.

567
00:42:58,104 --> 00:42:59,365
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a holodeck in my backyard.

568
00:42:59,465 --> 00:43:04,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Frisbee says, question, all games suggest that you take a 15 minute break after one hour of playing.

569
00:43:04,409 --> 00:43:06,751
[SPEAKER_05]: How many people will hurt their eyes with this 3D stuff?

570
00:43:07,191 --> 00:43:11,875
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of curious what the safety manual and disclaimers are going to look like on the 3DS.

571
00:43:12,015 --> 00:43:12,896
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very curious.

572
00:43:12,976 --> 00:43:14,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't play for more than five seconds.

573
00:43:15,678 --> 00:43:17,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the best part about the 3DS.

574
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,144
[SPEAKER_03]: If it starts bugging your eyes, there's a little slider to turn the 3D off.

575
00:43:22,424 --> 00:43:23,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, and that's awesome.

576
00:43:24,931 --> 00:43:30,095
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the comments I wanted to read, SJ100Matt in our chatroom said, Give it five years, maybe there will be enough support for it.

577
00:43:30,395 --> 00:43:31,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now there's nothing worthwhile.

578
00:43:31,836 --> 00:43:33,497
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all James Cameron's fault.

579
00:43:33,898 --> 00:43:37,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that stupid rant he had in E3 2009 actually meant something.

580
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:42,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember that rant, but apparently he got up on stage and talked kind of about the 3D stuff.

581
00:43:44,445 --> 00:43:45,406
[SPEAKER_05]: We weren't ready for it.

582
00:43:45,426 --> 00:43:47,288
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not ready to handle it.

583
00:43:47,648 --> 00:43:50,030
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't handle that extra D. You can't handle the truth.

584
00:43:50,511 --> 00:43:54,314
[SPEAKER_03]: But look at 3D and what it's done so far to cinema.

585
00:43:55,275 --> 00:43:57,176
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting a lot of gimmicky movies.

586
00:43:57,336 --> 00:44:03,982
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got a lot of gimmicky movies back when the red and blue glass 3D was really popular.

587
00:44:05,863 --> 00:44:06,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a lot of like...

588
00:44:08,205 --> 00:44:09,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Destination in 3D.

589
00:44:09,986 --> 00:44:11,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, look at the head flew towards me!

590
00:44:12,408 --> 00:44:13,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Saw in 3D.

591
00:44:13,869 --> 00:44:16,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, look at the head flying towards me!

592
00:44:18,091 --> 00:44:19,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Jaws in 3D.

593
00:44:19,212 --> 00:44:20,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, look at the head flying towards me!

594
00:44:21,013 --> 00:44:24,095
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically the same stuff over and over.

595
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:31,139
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of these movies that don't necessarily need 3D, like Clash of the Titans, have the 3D tacked onto it, and it looks like shit.

596
00:44:31,259 --> 00:44:32,800
[SPEAKER_03]: So, take that...

597
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,324
[SPEAKER_03]: and add that to, say, games, and now you're going to get 3D games that look like shit.

598
00:44:37,804 --> 00:44:49,315
[SPEAKER_05]: It just occurred to me, I thought of something that was, blow my hair back, amazing, 3D experience, that 3D was intricate and necessary to the presentation that would not have been the same without it.

599
00:44:50,176 --> 00:44:50,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Captain EO.

600
00:44:51,217 --> 00:44:52,278
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking the same thing.

601
00:44:52,538 --> 00:44:56,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and remember that seventh portal thing, the Marvel thing at Great America?

602
00:44:57,619 --> 00:44:59,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Those rides that are like that.

603
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,080
[SPEAKER_05]: The Muppet Show.

604
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Captain EO, really.

605
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Captain EO was first, and Captain EO was what, 1985?

606
00:45:05,721 --> 00:45:05,681
86?

607
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:08,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

608
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:15,282
[SPEAKER_05]: When Captain EO comes out on these 3D TVs, wake me up.

609
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:17,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Then maybe I'm ready for 3D TVs.

610
00:45:19,577 --> 00:45:22,538
[SPEAKER_05]: In the meantime, let's move on to something else that's completely unnecessary.

611
00:45:22,558 --> 00:45:23,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you imagine if they did a Captain EO game?

612
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:26,879
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what the Michael Jackson game should be.

613
00:45:27,619 --> 00:45:29,259
[SPEAKER_05]: None of this imitate his dance moves.

614
00:45:29,279 --> 00:45:31,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't give a shit about that.

615
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Captain EO and Michael Jackson Moonwalker 2.

616
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:36,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing.

617
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:37,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Moonwalker HD.

618
00:45:40,281 --> 00:45:43,082
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100 Matt says your other answer is Lawnmower Man.

619
00:45:45,948 --> 00:45:49,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when virtual reality was like the big... Oh my god.

620
00:45:50,011 --> 00:45:50,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Virtual reality.

621
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:53,013
[SPEAKER_08]: They tried.

622
00:45:53,213 --> 00:45:55,494
[SPEAKER_03]: And stock footage of all the Mind's Eye stuff.

623
00:45:55,534 --> 00:45:56,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, that was really cool.

624
00:45:57,716 --> 00:46:01,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I remember back in the day when virtual reality stuff was really big.

625
00:46:02,899 --> 00:46:04,400
[SPEAKER_03]: God, we were stupid back then.

626
00:46:04,861 --> 00:46:05,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

627
00:46:05,901 --> 00:46:09,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of things that are completely useless and unnecessary, Real ID.

628
00:46:09,723 --> 00:46:11,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Had to do that.

629
00:46:11,364 --> 00:46:13,025
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a fantastic tie-in, Rob.

630
00:46:13,085 --> 00:46:13,825
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very proud of you.

631
00:46:14,385 --> 00:46:15,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Three weeks in a row I'm talking about this.

632
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:17,247
[SPEAKER_05]: And look, look, again, I'm going to say this.

633
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:24,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of you could give two shits about World of Warcraft, but this is important because where Blizzard goes, other companies will inevitably follow.

634
00:46:24,771 --> 00:46:25,931
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to keep it brief this week.

635
00:46:25,971 --> 00:46:30,493
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two quick things that happen to Real ID that are newsworthy and necessary to cover.

636
00:46:31,154 --> 00:46:33,255
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, this is kind of one of those like,

637
00:46:34,943 --> 00:46:38,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of it's really funny, and the other part is actually not funny at all.

638
00:46:38,724 --> 00:46:49,588
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is that a bunch of people, when this real ID, and going back to when Blizzard was saying, oh, we're going to post your real name to the forum whenever you want to make a post, right?

639
00:46:49,608 --> 00:46:51,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that whole thing they had to retract last week?

640
00:46:51,908 --> 00:46:54,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a lot of people complained to the ESRB.

641
00:46:54,969 --> 00:46:57,870
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of people wrote them and said, this game is violating our privacy.

642
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:00,011
[SPEAKER_05]: You should go back and re-rate this game.

643
00:47:00,191 --> 00:47:00,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

644
00:47:00,871 --> 00:47:01,531
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

645
00:47:27,805 --> 00:47:51,637
[SPEAKER_05]: well here's the part about it that really sucks all of the people that wrote in to complain yeah all of their names and email addresses were in the to field because somebody didn't think oh I should put those in the BCC field so all of the people who complained had their email addresses exposed

646
00:47:53,531 --> 00:47:55,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they're going to sue.

647
00:47:55,653 --> 00:48:00,737
[SPEAKER_05]: And now, granted, ESRB wrote an apology not even 24 hours later.

648
00:48:00,797 --> 00:48:01,918
[SPEAKER_05]: They sent out an apology.

649
00:48:02,098 --> 00:48:05,801
[SPEAKER_05]: And the nice thing was they kind of addressed the irony.

650
00:48:05,941 --> 00:48:07,263
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't try to beat around the bush.

651
00:48:07,323 --> 00:48:16,250
[SPEAKER_05]: They did say in their apology, "...the fact that our message addressed individuals' concerns with respect to their privacy underscores how truly disappointing a mistake this was on our part.

652
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:21,254
[SPEAKER_05]: We work with companies to ensure they are handling people's private information with confidentiality, care, and respect."

653
00:48:21,574 --> 00:48:24,415
[SPEAKER_05]: It is only right that we set a good example and do no leves ourselves.

654
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:27,376
[SPEAKER_05]: So at least they didn't try to give you a BS corporate answer.

655
00:48:27,516 --> 00:48:28,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, to some extent.

656
00:48:28,557 --> 00:48:29,737
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a little washed out.

657
00:48:29,757 --> 00:48:33,059
[SPEAKER_05]: You know when they said that, like, aw, crap.

658
00:48:33,099 --> 00:48:35,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, first off, you know an intern did this.

659
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,502
[SPEAKER_05]: And secondly, like, when he hit the send button, you know he went, aw, fuck.

660
00:48:40,842 --> 00:48:41,942
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going home.

661
00:48:41,962 --> 00:48:44,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Please, please, please.

662
00:48:44,243 --> 00:48:44,783
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta go.

663
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:46,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Please don't crap on interns.

664
00:48:46,464 --> 00:48:47,625
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm planning on being an intern.

665
00:48:47,785 --> 00:48:48,505
[SPEAKER_08]: I am an intern.

666
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:48,605
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm...

667
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:50,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying.

668
00:48:50,387 --> 00:48:52,309
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that I'm crapping on interns.

669
00:48:52,689 --> 00:48:54,351
[SPEAKER_08]: An intern designed the FedEx logo.

670
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:56,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

671
00:48:56,673 --> 00:48:58,616
[SPEAKER_03]: The Federal Express logo or the FedEx logo?

672
00:48:58,636 --> 00:48:59,356
[SPEAKER_08]: The FedEx logo.

673
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:00,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh.

674
00:49:01,879 --> 00:49:02,700
[SPEAKER_05]: It's clever.

675
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:08,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Regardless of whether it was an intern or the CEO, you know after clicking the send button they went, ah, fuck.

676
00:49:09,961 --> 00:49:10,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

677
00:49:33,444 --> 00:49:35,324
[SPEAKER_05]: There's more in the Real ID saga.

678
00:49:35,964 --> 00:49:44,266
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is important because after all the ranting I've done in previous episodes, if Blizzard's going to come out and say, oops, we made a mistake, we should change it, I think it should be acknowledged.

679
00:49:44,446 --> 00:49:46,607
[SPEAKER_05]: And to some extent, that's what's happened this week.

680
00:49:47,107 --> 00:49:53,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Nethera, who's one of the community managers, did post on the official WoW forums about some Real ID follow-ups.

681
00:49:54,308 --> 00:49:58,709
[SPEAKER_05]: One, my biggest complaint about the system as it was, the Friends of Friends feature.

682
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:06,675
[SPEAKER_05]: She went on to say, they've been evaluating how Real ID has been used since it's released to identify the new functionality that will help improve our players' experience, blah, blah, blah.

683
00:50:07,035 --> 00:50:14,681
[SPEAKER_05]: The in-game Real ID Friends of Friends list is designed to give players a convenient way to populate the Real ID Friends list, blah, blah, blah, corporate speak, corporate speak.

684
00:50:14,961 --> 00:50:27,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, however, we recognize that some players would prefer not to be displayed on friends lists in this fashion, so we plan to include an option that will allow players to opt out of appearing on their real ID friends, friends of friends lists.

685
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:30,873
[SPEAKER_05]: This should be ready by the first StarCraft 2 patch.

686
00:50:31,173 --> 00:50:32,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

687
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay, someone knocked some sense into Blizzard.

688
00:50:37,205 --> 00:50:40,287
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm not totally over this yet.

689
00:50:40,607 --> 00:50:44,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I to the point now where my number one concern with real ID was addressed?

690
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:44,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

691
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:55,036
[SPEAKER_05]: But I still get a little nervous because remember last week we had that story about the one line of code that would show your real name out there?

692
00:50:55,116 --> 00:50:56,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, yes, it was hotfix, blah, blah, blah.

693
00:50:57,093 --> 00:50:58,033
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

694
00:51:18,798 --> 00:51:31,506
[SPEAKER_05]: and after all this mess of the past few months and Real ID and this whole trying to get closer and closer into bed with Facebook I'm kind of really concerned about what Blizzard has planned for their next MMO.

695
00:51:32,687 --> 00:51:33,508
[SPEAKER_03]: FaceCraft?

696
00:51:36,892 --> 00:51:39,354
[SPEAKER_05]: What are your plans for Facebook integration?

697
00:51:39,794 --> 00:51:46,238
[SPEAKER_05]: With regard to Facebook, our goal is to help Blizzard gamers on Battle.net more easily connect to their real-life friends and family.

698
00:51:46,538 --> 00:51:52,162
[SPEAKER_05]: For the launch of StarCraft II, we are introducing an optional Facebook Friend Finder feature to help achieve this goal.

699
00:51:52,523 --> 00:52:02,970
[SPEAKER_05]: The Friend Finder enables players who decide to use it to easily populate their Battle.net friends list by sending real ID friend requests to the people on their Facebook friends list who have Battle.net accounts.

700
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:06,652
[SPEAKER_05]: We hope players will find this feature convenient, but it's completely optional.

701
00:52:06,972 --> 00:52:07,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

702
00:52:07,733 --> 00:52:19,161
[SPEAKER_05]: So in other words, you can now, if you want to go onto Facebook and pull all of your friends' real IDs from your Facebook, you can do that, I think is what they're saying.

703
00:52:20,122 --> 00:52:20,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not want!

704
00:52:21,322 --> 00:52:28,627
[SPEAKER_03]: This way, people in China that may have to leave their game to visit friends and family don't have to do that.

705
00:52:29,528 --> 00:52:31,270
[SPEAKER_03]: They can sit there and play their games.

706
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:34,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not like this direction that Blizzard is going.

707
00:52:34,534 --> 00:52:36,016
[SPEAKER_05]: They are a gaming company.

708
00:52:36,076 --> 00:52:37,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop trying to be a social network.

709
00:52:38,959 --> 00:52:41,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Throughout all of this, what they really should have learned...

710
00:52:45,182 --> 00:52:46,103
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

711
00:53:03,118 --> 00:53:08,886
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys should come in, sit down, and really ask themselves, why are we here?

712
00:53:09,768 --> 00:53:11,290
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the goal of our company?

713
00:53:11,971 --> 00:53:14,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do people pay us $15 a month?

714
00:53:14,595 --> 00:53:15,215
[SPEAKER_05]: To make money.

715
00:53:15,496 --> 00:53:17,839
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all they're for the money.

716
00:53:19,201 --> 00:53:27,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they pay us $15 a month so that they can have their real lives, be reminded of their real life and their Facebook friends and all this all the time?

717
00:53:27,908 --> 00:53:28,088
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

718
00:53:28,448 --> 00:53:32,331
[SPEAKER_05]: People pay $15 a month to escape the real world and slay internet dragons.

719
00:53:32,672 --> 00:53:33,592
[SPEAKER_05]: That is why they pay the money.

720
00:53:33,612 --> 00:53:35,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Are people leaving the game in droves because of this?

721
00:53:36,194 --> 00:53:36,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

722
00:53:37,375 --> 00:53:38,176
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they are.

723
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:38,856
[SPEAKER_05]: We're sorry.

724
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,382
[SPEAKER_03]: and then they'll come right back and then they'll get screwed again.

725
00:54:04,442 --> 00:54:05,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Salacious Pop says this beautifully.

726
00:54:06,223 --> 00:54:10,385
[SPEAKER_05]: If they are already a real life friend, I know where they are because I've met them.

727
00:54:10,525 --> 00:54:13,787
[SPEAKER_05]: If I want to be on their Facebook, I will call and ask.

728
00:54:14,548 --> 00:54:14,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.

729
00:54:16,331 --> 00:54:16,771
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

730
00:54:17,952 --> 00:54:35,920
[SPEAKER_05]: From here on out, until Blizzard has decided that they are not going to get into bed with Facebook so much anymore and keep sucking their dick as they've been so much recently, until Blizzard comes out and says, we are games first, I'm going to be referring to Blizzard as Bazinga.

731
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:37,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that is what they are.

732
00:54:37,721 --> 00:54:39,822
[SPEAKER_05]: They are Blizzard meets Zynga.

733
00:54:40,922 --> 00:54:42,705
[SPEAKER_05]: So Blazinga from here on out.

734
00:54:42,745 --> 00:54:45,308
[SPEAKER_05]: When I say that on the show, you know who I'm talking about.

735
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:57,584
[SPEAKER_05]: But until they have decided, you know what, we are a gaming company first and maybe we should not try to get so much into the social network stuff or push it down everybody's throats as hard as we've been, they are Blazinga.

736
00:54:57,924 --> 00:55:11,036
[SPEAKER_05]: and Blazinga needs to take a cue from Xbox Live because I think it's one of the things that Microsoft has done very, very well in Excel Z. And the great thing about Xbox Live, it does have that community feeling.

737
00:55:11,336 --> 00:55:18,923
[SPEAKER_05]: You have achievements and messages and you have that Facebook integration if you want it and you can find Facebook friends if you want to.

738
00:55:19,363 --> 00:55:22,306
[SPEAKER_05]: It's done right on Xbox Live, I think.

739
00:55:22,466 --> 00:55:27,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand why they make it like you can't... Like all of a sudden I have to find my friends out there.

740
00:55:28,049 --> 00:55:31,411
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's so many social networking sites out there right now.

741
00:55:31,471 --> 00:55:34,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter, Facebook, MySpace if you're still using it.

742
00:55:34,613 --> 00:55:35,693
[SPEAKER_03]: And a whole bunch of other sites.

743
00:55:36,153 --> 00:55:37,254
[SPEAKER_03]: And games that do this.

744
00:55:38,014 --> 00:55:41,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do I need their help in connecting with my friends?

745
00:55:41,356 --> 00:55:44,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already connected with my friends probably a dozen times now.

746
00:55:45,752 --> 00:55:54,159
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, there is still the phone, there's still mail, there's still, you know, email, there's still a bunch of other ways to talk to your friends.

747
00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:03,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't understand, it's like, oh my god, I'm cut off from the rest of the world unless, unless I, I use Blizzard to connect with my friends!

748
00:56:05,648 --> 00:56:06,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see here.

749
00:56:06,609 --> 00:56:11,010
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw in our chatroom says, Sky, maybe they should pull an Apple and do a Q&A press conference, lol.

750
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:15,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's why BlazingaCon 2010 this year is going to be awesome.

751
00:56:16,011 --> 00:56:20,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there are going to be some of those people that bought tickets before all this shit happened that are going to the con.

752
00:56:21,212 --> 00:56:23,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Those developer Q&As are going to be awesome.

753
00:56:24,133 --> 00:56:26,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate BlizzCon.

754
00:56:26,936 --> 00:56:32,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of think it's kind of ridiculous and I have zero interest in going and paying $150 to go to one company's E3 booth.

755
00:56:33,102 --> 00:56:35,904
[SPEAKER_05]: But look, this would be the year to go.

756
00:56:36,024 --> 00:56:42,851
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the point where I'm seriously considering getting the direct TV feed because those Q&A sessions are going to be awesome.

757
00:56:45,157 --> 00:56:48,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Angry nerds in the building with the developers who anger them.

758
00:56:48,699 --> 00:56:49,460
[SPEAKER_05]: They will not be angry.

759
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Reality television show.

760
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:53,362
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll be drinking the Kool-Aid.

761
00:56:53,522 --> 00:56:55,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Tables will be overturned.

762
00:56:55,503 --> 00:56:58,785
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be taking it and they'll be like, hey, look at this we got for you.

763
00:56:58,805 --> 00:57:01,907
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll be like, oh, I forgive you for everything you've done.

764
00:57:02,167 --> 00:57:03,708
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so awesome.

765
00:57:04,089 --> 00:57:04,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

766
00:57:04,929 --> 00:57:07,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Unicycles now in World of Warcraft.

767
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:09,132
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just the best thing ever.

768
00:57:09,992 --> 00:57:11,552
[SPEAKER_03]: People are sheep.

769
00:57:11,812 --> 00:57:12,493
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

770
00:57:12,573 --> 00:57:25,495
[SPEAKER_03]: The people that follow Apple products, the people that follow Blizzard products, and countless other different brands out there that just eat up this shit despite all the crap that they do, they're gonna still be playing the game.

771
00:57:25,515 --> 00:57:26,956
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still gonna forgive them.

772
00:57:27,276 --> 00:57:27,816
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

773
00:57:27,856 --> 00:57:34,698
[SPEAKER_03]: If they leave for World of Warcraft, they'll come back for whatever the fuck next MMO they've got because, oh, Blizzard's fun.

774
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:36,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give them another try.

775
00:57:37,156 --> 00:57:43,719
[SPEAKER_03]: No one's gonna... No one really just up and just says, Oh, forget it.

776
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not dealing with them anymore.

777
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:49,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Until their next shiny thing comes out, they're just gonna be right back where they were before.

778
00:57:49,603 --> 00:57:52,744
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say that I have quit MMOs from principle.

779
00:57:53,625 --> 00:57:55,946
[SPEAKER_08]: So... But... Go ahead.

780
00:57:56,026 --> 00:57:57,507
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's just the type of person I am.

781
00:57:57,647 --> 00:57:59,768
[SPEAKER_08]: If I don't like something, I'm not gonna put up with it.

782
00:58:00,068 --> 00:58:02,529
[SPEAKER_05]: But would you go back if your problem changed?

783
00:58:02,809 --> 00:58:03,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably not.

784
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:04,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

785
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:04,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably not.

786
00:58:04,951 --> 00:58:05,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean...

787
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:06,987
[SPEAKER_08]: What came?

788
00:58:24,754 --> 00:58:24,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

789
00:58:40,834 --> 00:58:41,395
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with him.

790
00:58:41,575 --> 00:58:41,875
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.

791
00:58:42,276 --> 00:58:48,783
[SPEAKER_03]: This kind of reminds me though, SSJ100 Matt says, are you people still mad at Blizzard about no LAN support?

792
00:58:48,803 --> 00:58:49,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Blazinga, please.

793
00:58:50,385 --> 00:58:51,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Blazinga, whatever.

794
00:58:51,346 --> 00:58:52,267
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your thing, okay?

795
00:58:52,367 --> 00:58:55,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to try to remember that because that's stupid.

796
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:57,132
[SPEAKER_03]: The name's stupid.

797
00:58:57,152 --> 00:58:58,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm with the work on the name.

798
00:59:00,055 --> 00:59:01,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Zynga are the people that make Farmville.

799
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:02,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that.

800
00:59:03,056 --> 00:59:04,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I get the reference.

801
00:59:06,018 --> 00:59:08,119
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't need to point more attention to them.

802
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:14,543
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was just saying that he brings out a perfect point.

803
00:59:14,783 --> 00:59:19,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they took out a feature that really pissed off everybody else and they're like, oh, I'm boycotting the game.

804
00:59:20,966 --> 00:59:26,789
[SPEAKER_03]: How much do you want to bet that StarCraft 2 sells millions of fucking copies and it would be like as if

805
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:29,051
[SPEAKER_03]: That never happened.

806
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:37,516
[SPEAKER_03]: As if those features were never removed that maybe the fans still bought it anyways despite being pissed off at the company.

807
00:59:37,596 --> 00:59:42,199
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're basically saying never forget you were pissed about the LAN thing.

808
00:59:42,759 --> 00:59:43,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Never forget!

809
00:59:44,838 --> 00:59:45,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got more of those.

810
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:51,024
[SPEAKER_03]: There was something else I saw earlier this week that reminded me of it.

811
00:59:51,645 --> 00:59:55,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we can talk about it real quick because it sort of ties in with Activision.

812
00:59:55,909 --> 00:59:57,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Real quick because we've got to move on.

813
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:57,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Real quick.

814
00:59:57,791 --> 00:59:58,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

815
00:59:58,792 --> 01:00:00,394
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another tangent I have to go on here.

816
01:00:00,434 --> 01:00:01,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, real quick.

817
01:00:01,875 --> 01:00:22,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember how I brought up, and no one seemed to give a fucking shit about it, remember how I brought up that Activision is starting to price Wii games, remember the Wii games usually are 50 bucks retail at the most, for 60 dollars retail for certain games because they think that they should get some more money because, you know, music licensing or whatever.

818
01:00:23,209 --> 01:00:25,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot, thank you for reminding me to never forget.

819
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:30,435
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not saying that Activision is the only one to blame, too, because Beatles Rock Band, same thing happened with that.

820
01:00:30,455 --> 01:00:33,999
[SPEAKER_03]: They were charging $60 for the Wii version of the game.

821
01:00:34,019 --> 01:00:34,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, guess what?

822
01:00:35,301 --> 01:00:38,764
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been another year, no one's really complained, and it's happening again.

823
01:00:38,925 --> 01:00:39,445
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess what?

824
01:00:39,465 --> 01:00:46,212
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just happening now with music games, but the new Tony Hawk game is also going to be $60 on the Wii.

825
01:00:47,914 --> 01:00:48,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

826
01:00:48,955 --> 01:00:50,295
[SPEAKER_03]: No one's going to buy it anyways.

827
01:00:50,335 --> 01:00:52,136
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you're giving them another reason not to buy it.

828
01:00:52,196 --> 01:00:56,818
[SPEAKER_03]: But also, you know, Guitar Hero, Warriors of Rock, I'm sure DJ Hero 2.

829
01:00:57,439 --> 01:00:59,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are all $60 price points.

830
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:03,402
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys need to not forget this stuff because they're going to start sneaking out more games like that.

831
01:01:03,482 --> 01:01:06,883
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know for me, that's not a big deal because I don't game that much on the Wii.

832
01:01:06,923 --> 01:01:08,724
[SPEAKER_03]: But for other people, it might be a big deal.

833
01:01:09,224 --> 01:01:12,106
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't stop it here, they're just going to keep going.

834
01:01:12,146 --> 01:01:14,767
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going to stop them from saying, oh, well, now we're adding 3D interface.

835
01:01:14,867 --> 01:01:16,247
[SPEAKER_03]: to our 360 games.

836
01:01:16,428 --> 01:01:17,808
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be $70 retail.

837
01:01:18,028 --> 01:01:18,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Vote with your wallet.

838
01:01:19,028 --> 01:01:21,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, so point it out.

839
01:01:21,589 --> 01:01:23,810
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we should make Lokis never forget a regular segment.

840
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:27,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Ray Iannami says he doesn't play any Blizzard game anyways.

841
01:01:27,931 --> 01:01:40,095
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you may not play StarCraft 2 or Diablo 3 or this unannounced MMO, but the reason why we spend so much time on it, and I apologize, I know not everyone's into WoW, but keep in mind, WoW is that behemoth of an RPG game right now anyway.

842
01:01:40,535 --> 01:01:43,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Where they go, a lot of the industry tends to follow.

843
01:01:44,907 --> 01:01:47,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Blizzard right now is the Rockefellers.

844
01:01:48,069 --> 01:01:49,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Back in the day and you know what happened with them.

845
01:01:51,592 --> 01:01:52,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Go back and read a history book.

846
01:01:54,054 --> 01:01:57,917
[SPEAKER_05]: This came up last week and I think it's doubly true after a lot of this Blazinga talk this week.

847
01:01:58,057 --> 01:01:59,639
[SPEAKER_05]: The WoW killer is WoW.

848
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,141
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a matter of when.

849
01:02:03,081 --> 01:02:08,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I will tell you what the WoW killer is not because I was reminded I didn't even mention this during my gaming week.

850
01:02:09,686 --> 01:02:12,147
[SPEAKER_05]: I played the Final Fantasy XIV beta this week.

851
01:02:12,607 --> 01:02:13,728
[SPEAKER_05]: I spent a little time with it.

852
01:02:13,908 --> 01:02:16,989
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my little tangent I wanted to get on because I forgot to mention this during my gaming week.

853
01:02:17,369 --> 01:02:19,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I played the Final Fantasy XIV beta on Tuesday.

854
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:21,590
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if I'm actually supposed to be talking about it or not.

855
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:22,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

856
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:22,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

857
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:24,351
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you this.

858
01:02:24,671 --> 01:02:27,932
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not my account, so I'm not under any NDA.

859
01:02:28,072 --> 01:02:30,073
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyhow, I'm not going to tell you whose it is, though.

860
01:02:31,276 --> 01:02:33,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I played the beta and it's awful.

861
01:02:33,997 --> 01:02:35,177
[SPEAKER_05]: It is awful.

862
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:41,379
[SPEAKER_05]: It is horrible, awful, laggy, not fun.

863
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not buying this game when it comes out if it's in this shape.

864
01:02:45,281 --> 01:02:47,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, it's a beta, not a demo.

865
01:02:48,162 --> 01:02:55,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Betas are buggy, betas are slow, but betas also are supposed to give me an impression at least of what I'm to expect in the final product.

866
01:02:56,385 --> 01:03:19,837
[SPEAKER_05]: I got dumped into this world with no explanation what I was supposed to do, where I'm supposed to go, how you proceed, all these fancy big words of guildlevs and armathith crystals and these quests and all these things, and I realized I could probably go online and figure it out, but I thought the big thing about Final Fantasy XIV was that it was supposed to be

867
01:03:20,217 --> 01:03:22,338
[SPEAKER_05]: more accessible than Final Fantasy 11 was.

868
01:03:22,839 --> 01:03:25,640
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not in its current shape.

869
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:27,781
[SPEAKER_05]: This game is supposed to come out September 30th.

870
01:03:28,102 --> 01:03:29,242
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not ready.

871
01:03:30,083 --> 01:03:30,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Not ready.

872
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll try it again.

873
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:37,642
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll try the beta one more time before the actual game's released to see if maybe they added some expositions.

874
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:38,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say this.

875
01:03:38,862 --> 01:03:40,563
[SPEAKER_05]: At first, I was like, ooh, this is pretty.

876
01:03:40,903 --> 01:03:42,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, this cutscene is so pretty.

877
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:44,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, my character's in this cutscene.

878
01:03:44,164 --> 01:03:46,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh, this is a beautiful game.

879
01:03:46,785 --> 01:03:47,926
[SPEAKER_05]: This looks so amazing.

880
01:03:47,966 --> 01:03:50,707
[SPEAKER_05]: This character customization's really thorough.

881
01:03:51,207 --> 01:03:58,330
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I was stuck in the city running around for an hour because I had no idea where the hell I was supposed to be going.

882
01:03:58,570 --> 01:03:59,410
[SPEAKER_05]: or what I was supposed to be doing.

883
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:00,031
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to try it.

884
01:04:00,411 --> 01:04:00,971
[SPEAKER_08]: It's bad.

885
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:01,772
[SPEAKER_08]: I still want to try it.

886
01:04:01,872 --> 01:04:02,292
[SPEAKER_08]: It's bad.

887
01:04:02,532 --> 01:04:03,172
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to try it, though.

888
01:04:04,773 --> 01:04:05,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Just so I can see how bad.

889
01:04:07,234 --> 01:04:10,316
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Matt says, So wait, Rob, what you're describing is Final Fantasy XI.

890
01:04:10,416 --> 01:04:11,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, kinda.

891
01:04:11,396 --> 01:04:11,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

892
01:04:11,816 --> 01:04:19,260
[SPEAKER_05]: At least with Final Fantasy XI, I don't know, maybe it was because I had friends that played, but I still feel like I was able to figure it out somewhat, but like...

893
01:04:20,583 --> 01:04:46,567
[SPEAKER_05]: I went into combat I was fighting like a rat or something I don't even know and like I got frozen in combat and the rat wasn't targetable anymore and I had to like abandon the quest and if I wanted to start the quest again I would have had to run 30 minutes back into town like it's just it was ridiculous again I know it's a beta I'm not supposed to be giving my final impressions on the game but if the beta was supposed to be like raising my excitement for somebody that spent three years of his life playing Final Fantasy 11 didn't work tell you that

894
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:50,140
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a shame.

895
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is a shame.

896
01:04:51,761 --> 01:04:52,221
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a real shame.

897
01:04:52,241 --> 01:04:56,723
[SPEAKER_03]: What's also a shame nowadays is that it will still be released on the 30th.

898
01:04:57,583 --> 01:05:02,125
[SPEAKER_03]: And what will happen then is just, oh, we'll patch it later.

899
01:05:05,267 --> 01:05:07,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, they still have time to patch it, but not much.

900
01:05:08,028 --> 01:05:09,568
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's actually get to another story.

901
01:05:09,588 --> 01:05:12,630
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry we've taken up so much time with real ID and stuff.

902
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:14,651
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, this stuff's important.

903
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, what do you got for us?

904
01:05:15,999 --> 01:05:17,200
[SPEAKER_08]: One about a story I never played.

905
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:19,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

906
01:05:19,381 --> 01:05:22,063
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's okay, because a lot of people love games on Facebook.

907
01:05:22,423 --> 01:05:23,424
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of people love Zuma.

908
01:05:23,844 --> 01:05:25,245
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you said you liked Zuma, didn't you?

909
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:26,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Zuma's pretty fun.

910
01:05:27,026 --> 01:05:35,251
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not my favorite PopCap game, but I don't think there's any PopCap games that are really bad, per se.

911
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:38,013
[SPEAKER_05]: They get the job done, as far as casual games go.

912
01:05:38,593 --> 01:05:39,514
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all crackerific.

913
01:05:39,554 --> 01:05:40,254
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Peggle.

914
01:05:40,694 --> 01:05:41,475
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Peggle, too.

915
01:05:41,935 --> 01:05:46,477
[SPEAKER_08]: At any rate, Zuma Blitz is going to be coming out on Facebook.

916
01:05:46,577 --> 01:05:51,259
[SPEAKER_08]: They're supposed to have in about three weeks with a beta.

917
01:05:51,899 --> 01:06:02,784
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we should start seeing tournaments and levels and experience points and getting different features and a treasure chest and virtual currency and blah, blah, blah.

918
01:06:03,344 --> 01:06:04,785
[SPEAKER_08]: So it should be cool.

919
01:06:04,885 --> 01:06:07,346
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's going to go up there with Bejeweled Blitz.

920
01:06:08,266 --> 01:06:09,587
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's got a lot of people playing it.

921
01:06:10,806 --> 01:06:13,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I like me some Zuma and it should be good.

922
01:06:14,168 --> 01:06:16,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of people eat that up, especially on Facebook.

923
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:18,390
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be cool.

924
01:06:19,691 --> 01:06:23,593
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing that I play on Facebook right now is that Hotel City thing.

925
01:06:23,613 --> 01:06:24,814
[SPEAKER_03]: You know who would like that?

926
01:06:26,634 --> 01:06:27,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Extifer.

927
01:06:27,415 --> 01:06:28,135
[SPEAKER_03]: He used to play lots of Zuma.

928
01:06:28,155 --> 01:06:29,336
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, he did.

929
01:06:31,077 --> 01:06:31,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone should tell him.

930
01:06:32,417 --> 01:06:33,198
[SPEAKER_05]: He should be listening.

931
01:06:33,498 --> 01:06:35,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Blazinga, take note.

932
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:38,201
[SPEAKER_05]: PopCap knows how to do the Facebook integration thing.

933
01:06:38,261 --> 01:06:38,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying.

934
01:06:41,336 --> 01:06:44,584
[SPEAKER_08]: and um well

935
01:06:46,232 --> 01:06:46,732
[SPEAKER_08]: No, never mind.

936
01:06:46,972 --> 01:06:47,813
[SPEAKER_08]: We've beaten this horse.

937
01:06:48,673 --> 01:06:50,814
[SPEAKER_05]: It's already dead and bleeding from his pores.

938
01:06:50,834 --> 01:06:51,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Give it another whip.

939
01:06:52,455 --> 01:06:53,455
[SPEAKER_05]: You haven't said enough on this.

940
01:06:53,495 --> 01:06:54,956
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't skin the horse yet.

941
01:06:55,256 --> 01:06:56,136
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not over until we skin the horse.

942
01:06:56,156 --> 01:06:57,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Because my Vicodin's wearing off.

943
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:06,301
[SPEAKER_08]: I really think that, well, I was just thinking about what you said about them really needing to sit down and go over their business model.

944
01:07:06,801 --> 01:07:10,883
[SPEAKER_08]: But what if this is actually a true integrated part of their business model?

945
01:07:10,923 --> 01:07:11,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Abandon ship.

946
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:16,081
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to just go back and say one thing about it.

947
01:07:16,181 --> 01:07:20,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody, if you really are displeased with it, do it in numbers.

948
01:07:21,264 --> 01:07:23,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Hit them in the bank and do it with people.

949
01:07:23,885 --> 01:07:24,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Organize.

950
01:07:26,166 --> 01:07:28,147
[SPEAKER_05]: But then where will I fight my internet dragons?

951
01:07:28,767 --> 01:07:29,608
[SPEAKER_08]: There's other games, Rob.

952
01:07:31,549 --> 01:07:32,789
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not the same.

953
01:07:33,009 --> 01:07:34,710
[SPEAKER_08]: What did I say last time?

954
01:07:35,691 --> 01:07:37,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Principle versus entertainment.

955
01:07:37,311 --> 01:07:38,052
[SPEAKER_08]: What's more important?

956
01:07:38,952 --> 01:07:39,232
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

957
01:07:39,252 --> 01:07:40,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like entertainment, Jamie.

958
01:07:43,662 --> 01:07:46,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Entertainment Rob rarely got anything going in motion.

959
01:07:48,407 --> 01:07:49,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is interesting.

960
01:07:50,008 --> 01:07:55,273
[SPEAKER_03]: THQ apparently is impressed by the 3DS piracy protection.

961
01:07:55,934 --> 01:08:03,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you may remember the piracy has been a really big problem for the Nintendo DS and, you know,

962
01:08:04,162 --> 01:08:04,642
[SPEAKER_03]: and many more.

963
01:08:28,631 --> 01:08:57,932
[SPEAKER_03]: he added they combated piracy on the DSi which they don't believe is cracked yet but they know they've been hurt across the world and they believe that the 3DS has got the technology to stop that I'm kind of curious what that is but I guess they can't tell us or the pirates would start getting to work well here's my observation about that Nintendo thinks that they've stopped piracy on the DSi really

964
01:08:58,450 --> 01:09:02,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because I've seen flashcards for the DSi.

965
01:09:02,332 --> 01:09:07,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to go buy a DSi because I'm probably going to pick up a 3DS eventually.

966
01:09:07,213 --> 01:09:13,556
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, they haven't stopped piracy on the DSi, so...

967
01:09:15,896 --> 01:09:19,299
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're just going to get smarter.

968
01:09:19,519 --> 01:09:27,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Since it's basically cartridges it's reading off of, if you can mimic the data that's on there, then I don't see how it can really stop it.

969
01:09:27,346 --> 01:09:30,428
[SPEAKER_03]: They have anti-piracy measures that they put into the games, but

970
01:09:31,229 --> 01:09:34,471
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes like a week or two to crack them at the most.

971
01:09:34,832 --> 01:09:39,835
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of them get cracked day one, if not early, because they come out in other regions.

972
01:09:40,615 --> 01:09:45,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we won't really truly have the second half to this story until 3DS is out.

973
01:09:45,258 --> 01:09:49,221
[SPEAKER_05]: We know what that anti-piracy measure is, but it just seems like an echo of what we always hear.

974
01:09:49,281 --> 01:09:59,928
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll probably take a few months, but considering the technology is still going to be somewhat backwards compatible because it's going to be playing DS games, it's going to probably be as easy to crack as the DSi.

975
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:02,950
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be a matter of time.

976
01:10:03,010 --> 01:10:05,913
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they've finally solved the problem.

977
01:10:08,554 --> 01:10:11,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's something, and maybe this ties into it.

978
01:10:11,337 --> 01:10:11,657
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

979
01:10:11,697 --> 01:10:12,798
[SPEAKER_05]: This could be interesting.

980
01:10:12,878 --> 01:10:22,305
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know the 3DS has something that they talked about briefly called Tag Mode, which I always thought was supposed to be a part of the regular DS, but it kind of wasn't.

981
01:10:22,525 --> 01:10:24,166
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, what Tag Mode's supposed to be

982
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:31,252
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a passive communication feature that lets the DS systems talk to each other and send the data back and forth.

983
01:10:31,612 --> 01:10:34,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I always thought was some type of... It was in the DS, right?

984
01:10:34,133 --> 01:10:36,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you could carry Animal Crossing around in your pocket.

985
01:10:36,714 --> 01:10:44,176
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course now you had to have the game on and you had to be in that mode that sent out the letter in the bottle or whatever it was, that mode.

986
01:10:44,196 --> 01:10:44,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that?

987
01:10:44,916 --> 01:10:46,437
[SPEAKER_05]: You could send the letters in the bottle and...

988
01:10:47,077 --> 01:10:50,580
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyhow, I'm assuming this tag mode doesn't require that?

989
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Like maybe your DS can be off and it still will tag?

990
01:10:53,882 --> 01:10:57,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it uses low battery power to still kind of do this when it's asleep?

991
01:10:57,645 --> 01:10:57,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

992
01:10:57,905 --> 01:10:58,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

993
01:10:58,745 --> 01:11:06,751
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is a little more information given by Hideki Kono, who is the platform producer of the 3DS, in an interview with Wired Magazine.

994
01:11:07,251 --> 01:11:16,218
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, "...in the hardware, we have the capability that when you first play a game that supports tag mode, it will save to a tag mode data slot in the hardware system."

995
01:11:16,658 --> 01:11:19,239
[SPEAKER_05]: We're planning to support multiple games at the same time.

996
01:11:19,519 --> 01:11:20,259
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the difference.

997
01:11:20,279 --> 01:11:22,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario Kart, Nintendogs, Animal Crossing, and so forth.

998
01:11:23,019 --> 01:11:25,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I see, because right now the game does have to be running.

999
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:29,421
[SPEAKER_05]: So there'll actually be a tag mode viewer where you can manage the data.

1000
01:11:30,261 --> 01:11:36,982
[SPEAKER_05]: It will bring consumers a sense of wanting to play a game again after they get new data from games that they'd already forgotten about.

1001
01:11:37,322 --> 01:11:40,243
[SPEAKER_05]: What if the piracy is firmware updates delivered through tag?

1002
01:11:42,057 --> 01:11:43,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that's one way they can do it.

1003
01:11:44,179 --> 01:11:45,080
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm thinking.

1004
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's one of the ways they're going to do it.

1005
01:11:47,481 --> 01:11:48,242
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have a choice.

1006
01:11:48,322 --> 01:11:51,865
[SPEAKER_05]: These things are going to show up on your system because you walked by someone else with the newer firmware.

1007
01:11:54,482 --> 01:11:55,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't that be amazing?

1008
01:11:55,523 --> 01:11:56,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet that's it.

1009
01:11:57,104 --> 01:11:58,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet that's one of the anti-piracy measures they have.

1010
01:11:58,806 --> 01:12:08,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one of the original ways that they used to have the flashcards kind of work is they had some sort of thing with the Wi-Fi where you could do something with that.

1011
01:12:08,234 --> 01:12:08,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

1012
01:12:08,734 --> 01:12:11,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably sound like an idiot with this.

1013
01:12:11,336 --> 01:12:21,364
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know there was something that involved Wi-Fi at one point with the original DS flashcards and stuff when they were first getting those to work with proprietary code and stuff like that.

1014
01:12:22,045 --> 01:12:22,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1015
01:12:23,366 --> 01:12:24,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1016
01:12:41,707 --> 01:12:42,688
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1017
01:13:02,452 --> 01:13:04,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at LittleBigPlanet, though.

1018
01:13:04,634 --> 01:13:08,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Or ModNationRacers, which that's the whole thing, basically.

1019
01:13:08,698 --> 01:13:09,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1020
01:13:10,539 --> 01:13:11,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Such a missed opportunity.

1021
01:13:12,401 --> 01:13:19,186
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Matt, in commenting on the possible maybe tag mode is the anti-piracy, SSJ100Matt says, Nintendo isn't that smart.

1022
01:13:21,708 --> 01:13:22,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1023
01:13:22,669 --> 01:13:24,731
[SPEAKER_05]: ToyGak says, Wireless is a battery hog.

1024
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:25,652
[SPEAKER_05]: It better not be on.

1025
01:13:26,996 --> 01:13:27,996
[SPEAKER_05]: You can probably turn it off.

1026
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:38,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, and maybe there's probably a thing where it uses really, really low battery until it detects that DS, and then it uses it for a minute and then shuts back off.

1027
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:44,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see why the technology isn't there to do that, where it slowly drains your battery.

1028
01:13:44,521 --> 01:13:47,742
[SPEAKER_05]: But the battery power, you know, it's been, what, five years since the last DS?

1029
01:13:49,402 --> 01:13:51,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, not the last DS, but the first DS.

1030
01:13:51,644 --> 01:13:54,249
[SPEAKER_05]: I would think they've probably made the batteries in those things a lot better.

1031
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:57,856
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not like the games probably require that much more battery.

1032
01:13:58,317 --> 01:14:01,524
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, yeah, they're 3D, but I don't think it's gonna be that much more.

1033
01:14:04,188 --> 01:14:07,629
[SPEAKER_05]: and SJ100Matt says, yeah, it does sound like the Pokey Walker type of technology.

1034
01:14:08,249 --> 01:14:11,690
[SPEAKER_05]: SJ100Matt also says, maybe they can track me via my 20-digit friend code.

1035
01:14:12,491 --> 01:14:15,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't they say they're going to... Oh, God, I hope they're not going to do friend codes this time around.

1036
01:14:15,192 --> 01:14:19,813
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they kind of hinted they might be doing away with it or changing it, I suppose.

1037
01:14:19,833 --> 01:14:21,914
[SPEAKER_05]: 10-digit friend codes, woo-hoo.

1038
01:14:22,914 --> 01:14:23,214
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1039
01:14:23,234 --> 01:14:24,315
[SPEAKER_03]: One-digit friend codes.

1040
01:14:25,315 --> 01:14:26,975
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on to another story.

1041
01:14:27,015 --> 01:14:31,837
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura's got something for us and then release dates and the classic game of the week is not too far away.

1042
01:14:32,697 --> 01:14:41,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, for fans of Josh Stone, she's going to be the next Bond girl, at least in James Bond Bloodstone.

1043
01:14:42,639 --> 01:14:43,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Josh Stone.

1044
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:45,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Bloodstone.

1045
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:53,802
[SPEAKER_08]: She'll be playing Nicole Hunter, who is a socialite, works in diamonds, and said that she thinks it's crazy to be a Bond girl.

1046
01:14:54,882 --> 01:15:03,549
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, just talking about having full body scan and everything, but it's supposed to be a third person, um, cover based shooter with vehicle stuff in there.

1047
01:15:03,849 --> 01:15:04,730
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the bizarre creation.

1048
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:06,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Including cars and speedboats.

1049
01:15:07,452 --> 01:15:08,412
[SPEAKER_08]: So, should be fun.

1050
01:15:09,073 --> 01:15:10,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Her name is Nicole Hunter.

1051
01:15:11,895 --> 01:15:14,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Nicole Hunter She described the character as a posh version of Paris Hilton

1052
01:15:37,489 --> 01:15:38,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1053
01:16:00,151 --> 01:16:04,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, if you want to make the character more posher, you should have gotten Posh Spice, not Joss Stone.

1054
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:05,422
[SPEAKER_08]: I was saying classy.

1055
01:16:06,444 --> 01:16:10,593
[SPEAKER_08]: At any rate, if they want to make a real trailer trash, they probably just could have called her Atmore Motel 6.

1056
01:16:12,799 --> 01:16:13,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Salacious Pop, thank you.

1057
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:15,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Christmas Jones.

1058
01:16:15,201 --> 01:16:16,482
[SPEAKER_05]: She was a nuclear physicist.

1059
01:16:16,502 --> 01:16:19,585
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Denise Richards in whatever, like, was it Tomorrow Never Dies?

1060
01:16:19,845 --> 01:16:21,707
[SPEAKER_05]: She played a character named Christmas Jones.

1061
01:16:22,207 --> 01:16:23,849
[SPEAKER_05]: How ridiculous is that name?

1062
01:16:24,329 --> 01:16:25,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Christmas Jones.

1063
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:26,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Nicole Hunter?

1064
01:16:26,191 --> 01:16:28,013
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, I don't, like, I don't know.

1065
01:16:28,173 --> 01:16:29,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably knew a girl in high school named that.

1066
01:16:30,034 --> 01:16:31,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, that's not that exciting.

1067
01:16:34,278 --> 01:16:34,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh...

1068
01:16:37,133 --> 01:16:40,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we got all these random Bond girl type names being yelled out here.

1069
01:16:40,854 --> 01:16:43,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Honey Rider, Posher Spice, maybe that could be the name.

1070
01:16:44,375 --> 01:16:48,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Toagax says Paris Hilton equals pussy here, pussy there, pussy, pussy everywhere.

1071
01:16:50,157 --> 01:16:51,398
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of how she got famous.

1072
01:16:51,458 --> 01:16:55,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Bond girl names could be exchangeable with porn star names too.

1073
01:16:56,914 --> 01:16:57,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, Jinx.

1074
01:16:57,755 --> 01:16:59,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't Hal Berry like Jinx?

1075
01:17:01,017 --> 01:17:01,418
[SPEAKER_05]: What was her name?

1076
01:17:01,438 --> 01:17:03,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was Jinx because they were going to do a spin-off movie.

1077
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:05,721
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, you know what my favorite porn star name is?

1078
01:17:05,942 --> 01:17:06,122
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1079
01:17:06,502 --> 01:17:07,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Allison Chains.

1080
01:17:07,943 --> 01:17:09,865
[SPEAKER_08]: I just thought it was funny.

1081
01:17:10,585 --> 01:17:17,871
[SPEAKER_05]: And lastly, before we move on to release dates, Salacious Pop in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com says, How is Paris Hilton like Kansas?

1082
01:17:18,612 --> 01:17:21,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Both are flat, white, and easy to enter.

1083
01:17:21,895 --> 01:17:21,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Ha!

1084
01:17:25,402 --> 01:17:26,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Strawberry Fields.

1085
01:17:26,704 --> 01:17:26,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1086
01:17:27,025 --> 01:17:27,926
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a Bond girl?

1087
01:17:27,946 --> 01:17:28,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Strawberry Fields?

1088
01:17:33,334 --> 01:17:38,755
[SPEAKER_05]: See Strawberry Fields, Pussy Galore, Christmas Jones, Nicole Hunter.

1089
01:17:39,876 --> 01:17:41,316
[SPEAKER_05]: It just doesn't work.

1090
01:17:41,816 --> 01:17:42,616
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on.

1091
01:17:42,656 --> 01:17:43,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Release dates.

1092
01:17:44,037 --> 01:17:46,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Travel around the world and talk about games coming out soon.

1093
01:17:47,698 --> 01:17:48,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Hit a store near you.

1094
01:17:48,718 --> 01:17:50,038
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll start with the U.S., Loki.

1095
01:17:50,878 --> 01:17:53,719
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, her name's sort of broken down.

1096
01:17:53,739 --> 01:17:57,400
[SPEAKER_03]: It could sound like Hole Hunter, so I mean that, you know.

1097
01:17:59,115 --> 01:18:00,378
[SPEAKER_05]: What about Mike Hunter?

1098
01:18:01,079 --> 01:18:01,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike Hunter.

1099
01:18:02,601 --> 01:18:03,363
[SPEAKER_05]: That would have been better.

1100
01:18:04,252 --> 01:18:06,012
[SPEAKER_08]: I did know a guy named Benjamin Dover.

1101
01:18:07,453 --> 01:18:07,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Poor guy.

1102
01:18:09,953 --> 01:18:11,314
[SPEAKER_03]: So stuff coming out this week.

1103
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:18,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a whole lot because July is a pretty slow month, but there's some generic DS games, of course, coming out.

1104
01:18:18,915 --> 01:18:20,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Hidden Objects Mystery Stories.

1105
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:22,816
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another Hidden Objects game.

1106
01:18:22,996 --> 01:18:24,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because there's not a lot of those on the DS.

1107
01:18:26,817 --> 01:18:31,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently Trackmania Turbo, but I somehow doubt that's actually coming out because I think it's late to October.

1108
01:18:33,999 --> 01:18:55,918
[SPEAKER_03]: uh Samantha Swift and the Hidden Roses of Athena which also I believe was delayed forever uh and I definitely know Trackmania on the Wii man you know GameStop needs update their fucking release list it is terrible um Mumbo Jumbo six pack second edition it's six games from Mumbo Jumbo that you can buy on PC hooray um

1109
01:18:59,738 --> 01:19:00,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, is that it?

1110
01:19:02,362 --> 01:19:03,944
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's like nothing coming out this week.

1111
01:19:03,984 --> 01:19:04,905
[SPEAKER_03]: That can't be right.

1112
01:19:06,046 --> 01:19:07,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's just a slow week.

1113
01:19:08,470 --> 01:19:11,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Hidden Objects Mystery Stories it is.

1114
01:19:14,393 --> 01:19:15,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta go back to chat.

1115
01:19:15,394 --> 01:19:16,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the Bond girl thing's getting old.

1116
01:19:17,114 --> 01:19:19,435
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll look at a different list because that's a pathetic list.

1117
01:19:19,856 --> 01:19:21,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Derek H is in our chat tonight.

1118
01:19:22,297 --> 01:19:25,878
[SPEAKER_05]: He's actually the brains behind the big battle over at Dead Pixel Live, so welcome.

1119
01:19:26,438 --> 01:19:30,580
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, Christmas Jones led to the worst end lines of any Bond film.

1120
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,281
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought Christmas only came once a year.

1121
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:36,743
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm bummed.

1122
01:19:38,525 --> 01:19:40,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there is other things this week.

1123
01:19:40,126 --> 01:19:41,287
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot.

1124
01:19:41,547 --> 01:19:45,389
[SPEAKER_03]: They had them on Wii release dates, so it didn't really make sense to me.

1125
01:19:46,969 --> 01:19:57,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Star 1 Broken Alliance on Xbox 360, which that game actually reminds me, I don't know if anyone remembers this PlayStation 1 game, but Colony Wars, or even like Descent Free Space, so that might be kind of cool on 360.

1126
01:19:58,435 --> 01:20:02,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Arkrise Fantasia on the Wii, really awesome role-playing game.

1127
01:20:04,038 --> 01:20:04,238
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

1128
01:20:06,092 --> 01:20:09,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Cats and Dogs, Revenge of Kitty Galore on DS.

1129
01:20:09,993 --> 01:20:12,614
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think it's on this list, but I remember it.

1130
01:20:13,274 --> 01:20:18,175
[SPEAKER_03]: And why the god hell did they make this game in the first place?

1131
01:20:18,876 --> 01:20:23,217
[SPEAKER_03]: The Bachelor, featuring The Bachelorette as well on Wii and DS.

1132
01:20:23,537 --> 01:20:25,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, The Bachelor video game.

1133
01:20:26,058 --> 01:20:26,798
[SPEAKER_03]: That is correct.

1134
01:20:27,478 --> 01:20:28,358
[SPEAKER_03]: And Zany Golf on Wii.

1135
01:20:29,378 --> 01:20:29,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1136
01:20:30,059 --> 01:20:32,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what game do you make?

1137
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:34,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the closest thing we're going to get in America to a dating sim?

1138
01:20:37,117 --> 01:20:39,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, maybe?

1139
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,782
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to be the bachelor that rejects them all.

1140
01:20:42,022 --> 01:20:43,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, didn't that happen on one of them?

1141
01:20:43,764 --> 01:20:47,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, he or she, I don't remember, one of them just said, you know what?

1142
01:20:47,628 --> 01:20:48,489
[SPEAKER_05]: You all suck.

1143
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:49,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want any of you.

1144
01:20:49,911 --> 01:20:50,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you all.

1145
01:20:50,572 --> 01:20:51,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm out of here.

1146
01:20:52,234 --> 01:20:52,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Later.

1147
01:20:53,823 --> 01:20:54,684
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I play the game.

1148
01:20:54,824 --> 01:20:55,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Losers.

1149
01:20:56,124 --> 01:20:57,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to get laid.

1150
01:20:57,905 --> 01:20:58,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Done.

1151
01:20:59,807 --> 01:21:00,827
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need you.

1152
01:21:00,847 --> 01:21:02,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought Christmas only came once a year.

1153
01:21:04,029 --> 01:21:06,531
[SPEAKER_05]: The Xbox 360 in Japan this week.

1154
01:21:07,111 --> 01:21:09,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Blur Razors comes out in Japan this week.

1155
01:21:09,893 --> 01:21:13,675
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm kind of thinking that is actually Blur over there, and it is.

1156
01:21:14,015 --> 01:21:15,036
[SPEAKER_05]: But they call it Blur.

1157
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:17,637
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Blur Racers on this website.

1158
01:21:17,697 --> 01:21:18,718
[SPEAKER_05]: It's incorrectly spelled.

1159
01:21:19,038 --> 01:21:19,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1160
01:21:19,478 --> 01:21:20,239
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so English.

1161
01:21:20,259 --> 01:21:20,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Blur Racers.

1162
01:21:20,999 --> 01:21:22,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Blur Racers.

1163
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:25,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue Racers with a Z, by the way, that's important.

1164
01:21:25,562 --> 01:21:28,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Blur Racers with a Z is out in Japan this week.

1165
01:21:28,644 --> 01:21:30,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it.

1166
01:21:30,565 --> 01:21:32,847
[SPEAKER_05]: 99 Nights 2 comes out in Japan this week.

1167
01:21:33,387 --> 01:21:35,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that on the shelf at the gaming store.

1168
01:21:35,428 --> 01:21:38,510
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought about buying it for five seconds and I was like, what am I thinking?

1169
01:21:39,871 --> 01:21:42,192
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty much it on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.

1170
01:21:42,252 --> 01:21:45,074
[SPEAKER_05]: So unfortunately, you guys had to wait for some of the games we've had here.

1171
01:21:46,134 --> 01:21:54,118
[SPEAKER_05]: But on PlayStation 3, you get Blur Racers as well, or Kentomahu to Gakuno Mono is coming out as well.

1172
01:21:54,278 --> 01:21:55,699
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know what this is.

1173
01:21:55,739 --> 01:21:59,901
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an upgraded version of the cute fantasy school life RPG.

1174
01:21:59,941 --> 01:22:03,243
[SPEAKER_05]: So this must be a remake of an old game that's now available.

1175
01:22:03,803 --> 01:22:07,965
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like it involves kind of like the card style battle in the game.

1176
01:22:09,126 --> 01:22:09,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Shadow of Summoner

1177
01:22:34,003 --> 01:22:45,414
[SPEAKER_05]: You control a light source to solve puzzles and battle monsters This is not a game I'm familiar with over here No, that's, oh god, Lost in Shadow, that's coming out Is it?

1178
01:22:45,634 --> 01:22:58,705
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that really cool trippy puzzle platform game I did see that at PAX East, I think they were showing that Okay, okay, so it's that, it's Kage no Tool over there in Japan Yeah, it's coming out over here in September Okay

1179
01:22:59,686 --> 01:23:13,557
[SPEAKER_03]: I like how on PlayAsia they have a wonderful combo where I can buy Blur Razors for the PS3 and I can combo with Blur Razors for the PS3.

1180
01:23:13,677 --> 01:23:15,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry, that's Blur on the PS3.

1181
01:23:15,578 --> 01:23:17,139
[SPEAKER_03]: In case I want both versions of the game.

1182
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:18,680
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to play American and Japanese.

1183
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:19,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

1184
01:23:19,121 --> 01:23:19,981
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same game.

1185
01:23:20,181 --> 01:23:20,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

1186
01:23:20,722 --> 01:23:21,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Play them both.

1187
01:23:21,302 --> 01:23:21,963
[SPEAKER_05]: It's region-free.

1188
01:23:22,563 --> 01:23:23,723
[SPEAKER_05]: on the Nintendo DS.

1189
01:23:24,343 --> 01:23:28,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Katekyo Hitman Reborn DS Flame Rumble XX.

1190
01:23:28,564 --> 01:23:30,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that is really the game's name.

1191
01:23:30,365 --> 01:23:32,265
[SPEAKER_05]: They have some crazy names over there.

1192
01:23:32,285 --> 01:23:33,986
[SPEAKER_05]: They like their subtitles.

1193
01:23:34,706 --> 01:23:35,966
[SPEAKER_05]: They love their subtitles.

1194
01:23:35,986 --> 01:23:36,566
[SPEAKER_05]: They really do.

1195
01:23:36,706 --> 01:23:42,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, remember how long the one Street Fighter I have is like something, something, something for matching service.

1196
01:23:43,368 --> 01:23:47,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, the longer the subtitles, the better the game.

1197
01:23:48,212 --> 01:23:54,197
[SPEAKER_05]: TV Anime, Fairy Tale Gekitou, Madushi Kessen comes out as well.

1198
01:23:54,237 --> 01:23:56,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this like an interactive anime?

1199
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:58,041
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like a really good game.

1200
01:23:58,181 --> 01:24:01,003
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like an action game that's just based on an anime.

1201
01:24:01,063 --> 01:24:04,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the anime plays on the bottom screen and you're kind of controlling the top screen.

1202
01:24:04,947 --> 01:24:05,727
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks a little silly.

1203
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:17,872
[SPEAKER_05]: and lastly going to the PSP for Japanese release dates Fate slash Extra is the big release this week on the PSP it's coming out regular and limited editions because the only thing they love more in subtitles are limited editions in Japan

1204
01:24:18,718 --> 01:24:23,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but my limited edition has a bowl and a plate and a knife and a clock.

1205
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:25,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this is an RPG on the PSP.

1206
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:26,940
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually looks kind of cool.

1207
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:30,361
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of got a very Phantasy Star look to it.

1208
01:24:30,461 --> 01:24:32,021
[SPEAKER_05]: The newer Phantasy Star games, that is.

1209
01:24:32,141 --> 01:24:32,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1210
01:24:32,881 --> 01:24:34,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of in its like action-y type attack.

1211
01:24:34,702 --> 01:24:37,763
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta say, this looks kind of neat, actually.

1212
01:24:37,983 --> 01:24:38,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this by?

1213
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:40,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Marvelous.

1214
01:24:40,423 --> 01:24:45,004
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not even by Sega, but it kind of looks inspired by the newer Phantasy Star games, at least to me, at first glance.

1215
01:24:45,484 --> 01:24:46,945
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is, your Japanese release dates.

1216
01:24:46,965 --> 01:24:47,365
[SPEAKER_05]: How about the UK?

1217
01:24:48,462 --> 01:24:50,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, in the UK, we have some games.

1218
01:24:50,983 --> 01:24:59,585
[SPEAKER_08]: We have, um, on the 19th, we have Alien Swarm, and the 20th, Need for Speed World.

1219
01:24:59,685 --> 01:25:01,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are both PC, by the way.

1220
01:25:01,585 --> 01:25:09,007
[SPEAKER_08]: The 23rd is Dragon Quest IX, Sentinels of the Starry Skies, and that's it until, yeah, that's it.

1221
01:25:10,106 --> 01:25:10,386
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1222
01:25:10,866 --> 01:25:16,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a couple quick more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week while we transition into Part B tonight.

1223
01:25:16,628 --> 01:25:18,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you got something else for us.

1224
01:25:18,468 --> 01:25:28,291
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've signed up for the PlayStation Plus service, you may be a wonderful contestant in checking out Hulu Plus as well.

1225
01:25:28,891 --> 01:25:30,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it's another service with plus in the name.

1226
01:25:31,113 --> 01:25:32,093
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gotta be good, right?

1227
01:25:32,814 --> 01:25:40,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Which will become available to select subscribers of the Sony's PlayStation Plus program starting now.

1228
01:25:41,039 --> 01:25:48,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, eventually all subscribers may be able to check out the...

1229
01:25:49,705 --> 01:26:08,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Hulu Plus service once it finally launches but as of right now you can download the Hulu Plus software and request an invitation to an exclusive preview and if you're chosen then you can preview the wonderful stuff that Hulu Plus will be allowing you to check out

1230
01:26:09,489 --> 01:26:33,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I hearing you correctly that you're telling me if I pay Sony $50 a year, I might get the opportunity, I could be the lucky, I might get selected, my name might get pulled out of that hat, and I would be given the opportunity with my $50 a year to pay Hulu $10 a year to watch old crap on TV.

1231
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:36,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I correct in what I'm hearing?

1232
01:26:36,361 --> 01:26:38,382
[SPEAKER_05]: You are correct, and doesn't it sound awesome?

1233
01:26:39,482 --> 01:26:40,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Sign me the fuck up!

1234
01:26:41,283 --> 01:26:42,343
[SPEAKER_05]: All this and core?

1235
01:26:42,603 --> 01:26:43,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow!

1236
01:26:50,286 --> 01:26:52,326
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I got nothing.

1237
01:26:52,827 --> 01:26:54,707
[SPEAKER_08]: It was beyond my ability to comment on, Rob.

1238
01:26:55,307 --> 01:27:00,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, can I tune in Hulu Plus stuff on my TV in my Sony home apartment?

1239
01:27:02,110 --> 01:27:03,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not.

1240
01:27:04,772 --> 01:27:16,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw, well, can I possibly, I don't know, put out Core magazines in my Sony apartment on home, like on my coffee table or anything like that?

1241
01:27:17,743 --> 01:27:21,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you can do that, but in the mall they sometimes show clips from Core.

1242
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:23,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow, clips.

1243
01:27:23,789 --> 01:27:29,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to stay there in the mall forever until I see the whole month of Core, just so I don't have to pay for it.

1244
01:27:29,955 --> 01:27:31,897
[SPEAKER_03]: And eventually I'll see all the clips.

1245
01:27:31,937 --> 01:27:35,441
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to be a worthwhile investment of my time.

1246
01:27:35,681 --> 01:27:38,263
[SPEAKER_05]: You know there's the OLR Clubhouse right now, right?

1247
01:27:38,303 --> 01:27:39,224
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a clubhouse at home.

1248
01:27:39,465 --> 01:27:42,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Dumbest $5 I ever spent, but I had to do it.

1249
01:27:42,888 --> 01:28:09,197
[SPEAKER_05]: OLR we love to explore new ways to interact with our audience and all these social things so I spent some of those ways may not be good stupid dollars look look I took the hit for the team okay I spent five dollars on this clubhouse and home right now we're limited to 25 members and believe it or not I don't know how this is possible but we I can't like I still get requests like at least once a week to join the club and I I can't I have to just file them away and trust me you're not missing out on anything yeah

1250
01:28:09,537 --> 01:28:10,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing.

1251
01:28:10,098 --> 01:28:24,751
[SPEAKER_05]: The clubhouse is a room, and I decorated it with the arcade machines that I won in the Namco demo, and I tried to put some stuff in there, but I can't put anything OLR-related in there.

1252
01:28:24,892 --> 01:28:27,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't put a clip from the show.

1253
01:28:27,774 --> 01:28:30,537
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a giant TV that sits at the top of the clubhouse.

1254
01:28:30,597 --> 01:28:32,239
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't do anything with it.

1255
01:28:32,959 --> 01:28:42,945
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even put the OLR artwork on the wall.

1256
01:28:44,106 --> 01:28:44,786
[SPEAKER_05]: I can do nothing.

1257
01:28:46,768 --> 01:28:51,951
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you're saying is you've transformed your OLR clubhouse into your game room.

1258
01:28:52,791 --> 01:28:53,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I did.

1259
01:28:56,133 --> 01:28:56,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

1260
01:28:59,079 --> 01:29:04,747
[SPEAKER_05]: and I paid five bucks for that exclusive opportunity to beta test the clubhouses.

1261
01:29:08,271 --> 01:29:09,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Feeling a little impotent now.

1262
01:29:11,095 --> 01:29:12,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just shocked.

1263
01:29:12,796 --> 01:29:16,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hearing the words come out of my mouth, and I want to smack myself on the back of the head and call me an idiot.

1264
01:29:17,077 --> 01:29:19,477
[SPEAKER_05]: I paid $5 to beta test the clubhouse.

1265
01:29:19,877 --> 01:29:21,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the funny part about it, though.

1266
01:29:21,058 --> 01:29:21,638
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I'm an idiot.

1267
01:29:22,038 --> 01:29:26,879
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still, like, gung-ho with home and saying, oh, it's such a wonderful platform.

1268
01:29:27,319 --> 01:29:28,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God, it's so successful.

1269
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:30,401
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1270
01:29:53,186 --> 01:29:54,888
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just so funny.

1271
01:29:56,170 --> 01:29:56,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

1272
01:29:57,672 --> 01:30:01,838
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna make this just fucking kick-ass game at home and we're gonna give it away for free, alright?

1273
01:30:01,858 --> 01:30:02,179
[SPEAKER_05]: You ready?

1274
01:30:02,199 --> 01:30:03,080
[SPEAKER_05]: You ready?

1275
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:08,588
[SPEAKER_05]: You're gonna be in a tank and you go around in this 3D space and you shoot other tanks.

1276
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:10,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god!

1277
01:30:10,870 --> 01:30:11,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Print!

1278
01:30:11,791 --> 01:30:12,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Run with it.

1279
01:30:12,452 --> 01:30:13,132
[SPEAKER_05]: It's amazing.

1280
01:30:13,933 --> 01:30:23,220
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can like post to your... You'll be able to post to your Twitter when you overtake other tanks and you'll win stuff for your house.

1281
01:30:24,481 --> 01:30:26,002
[SPEAKER_05]: But not your real house, your fake house.

1282
01:30:27,263 --> 01:30:27,824
[SPEAKER_05]: And shirts.

1283
01:30:28,064 --> 01:30:30,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, but then you have to pay for additional levels once you get there.

1284
01:30:32,648 --> 01:30:37,872
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the record, I never got to the point where I had to buy additional levels because I got bored of the game that quick.

1285
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:49,366
[SPEAKER_05]: And for those that think we're being Xbox fanboys right now and giving Sony an unbelievable amount of hate, look, I'll just say this.

1286
01:30:49,466 --> 01:30:52,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Never forget Yaris.

1287
01:30:53,409 --> 01:30:55,491
[SPEAKER_05]: So it can happen to anyone, all right?

1288
01:30:58,035 --> 01:31:17,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, speaking of the Xbox Actually, maybe this is a good thing to follow it up with You know how they're making this awesome new channel called the Destination Arcade Actually, it's not really It doesn't actually sound that awesome at all Destination Arcade is like this store that you can download to see the store in a whole new way

1289
01:31:20,114 --> 01:31:20,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Destination Arcade

1290
01:31:40,191 --> 01:31:40,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

1291
01:31:40,892 --> 01:31:49,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Major Nelson came out and said, Okay, so Destination Arcade, you're going to download it this week, and it's going to blow your mind, and then August 18th, we're shutting it off!

1292
01:31:50,259 --> 01:31:52,400
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a limited time only!

1293
01:31:53,721 --> 01:31:57,624
[SPEAKER_03]: We fixed all the problems with Xbox Live Arcade, we made things easier to find!

1294
01:31:58,625 --> 01:32:00,306
[SPEAKER_03]: For a limited time!

1295
01:32:00,346 --> 01:32:02,608
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're going to have to go back to finding things the old hard way.

1296
01:32:03,829 --> 01:32:05,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Why bother?

1297
01:32:07,239 --> 01:32:07,940
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

1298
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:09,741
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even have to defer to yours.

1299
01:32:09,841 --> 01:32:11,343
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just as stupid.

1300
01:32:11,363 --> 01:32:12,604
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what this is just like?

1301
01:32:12,804 --> 01:32:14,685
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just like, hey, guess what, guys?

1302
01:32:15,026 --> 01:32:17,708
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that you've been bitching about the D-pad forever.

1303
01:32:18,028 --> 01:32:22,452
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to release these wonderful limited edition FIFA controllers that are green.

1304
01:32:22,472 --> 01:32:24,053
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the D-pad fixed.

1305
01:32:24,273 --> 01:32:25,334
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's only for a limited time.

1306
01:32:25,354 --> 01:32:27,576
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going back to the crappy broken D-pad.

1307
01:32:28,837 --> 01:32:29,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, apparently...

1308
01:32:31,479 --> 01:32:32,981
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even know this until just now.

1309
01:32:33,221 --> 01:32:34,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the best part.

1310
01:32:34,342 --> 01:32:35,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait for it, guys.

1311
01:32:35,342 --> 01:32:35,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1312
01:32:36,423 --> 01:32:41,307
[SPEAKER_05]: So Major Nelson had an interview with Shaq News, apparently, and said that... I didn't even know this.

1313
01:32:41,367 --> 01:32:42,488
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hearing this for the first time.

1314
01:32:43,388 --> 01:32:48,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Said to Shaq News, if you've downloaded it, it will continue to work.

1315
01:32:50,033 --> 01:32:52,555
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can only download it until August 18th, apparently.

1316
01:32:55,497 --> 01:32:58,880
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to be part of this exclusive club, that's like...

1317
01:33:03,049 --> 01:33:05,130
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like going to a mall.

1318
01:33:05,170 --> 01:33:06,910
[SPEAKER_05]: You could go to Macy's to buy clothes.

1319
01:33:07,991 --> 01:33:09,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you could go to JCPenney.

1320
01:33:09,771 --> 01:33:10,191
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what?

1321
01:33:10,231 --> 01:33:15,573
[SPEAKER_05]: You had to sign up during this month-long promotion to go to JCPenney.

1322
01:33:16,513 --> 01:33:21,195
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you didn't sign up during that time, there's going to be a guard at the door who's just going to bounce you.

1323
01:33:21,415 --> 01:33:23,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, did you download this between July and August?

1324
01:33:23,736 --> 01:33:24,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on in.

1325
01:33:25,076 --> 01:33:25,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you.

1326
01:33:25,536 --> 01:33:26,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to Macy's.

1327
01:33:26,336 --> 01:33:26,957
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want your business.

1328
01:33:26,977 --> 01:33:27,817
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be like this.

1329
01:33:27,857 --> 01:33:31,038
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be like, okay, if you've downloaded this program...

1330
01:33:31,678 --> 01:33:32,800
[SPEAKER_03]: All the clothes will be on the shelf.

1331
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:38,568
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you haven't downloaded this program, you're gonna have to go to the store where all the clothes are in a giant pile in the middle of the store.

1332
01:33:39,990 --> 01:33:43,034
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be like that old Nick game show, Finders Keepers.

1333
01:33:47,782 --> 01:33:52,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to let everybody know right now, at this point Rob has doubled over and put his head between his knees.

1334
01:33:53,206 --> 01:33:59,230
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, how many news stories have we read tonight that just don't make any fucking sense?

1335
01:33:59,690 --> 01:34:02,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what is wrong with all of you?

1336
01:34:03,072 --> 01:34:04,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you all high?

1337
01:34:05,533 --> 01:34:08,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they give out drugs at E3 this year?

1338
01:34:08,634 --> 01:34:10,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, why didn't we get to go then?

1339
01:34:10,294 --> 01:34:10,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I want drugs.

1340
01:34:10,674 --> 01:34:11,855
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand.

1341
01:34:11,875 --> 01:34:12,355
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have them.

1342
01:34:12,495 --> 01:34:13,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Blazinga?

1343
01:34:13,755 --> 01:34:14,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony?

1344
01:34:14,696 --> 01:34:15,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft?

1345
01:34:15,916 --> 01:34:17,216
[SPEAKER_04]: You're all stupid.

1346
01:34:17,696 --> 01:34:18,897
[SPEAKER_04]: What is wrong?

1347
01:34:20,817 --> 01:34:23,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob is breathless with disbelief.

1348
01:34:23,058 --> 01:34:25,619
[SPEAKER_04]: We just figured it out.

1349
01:34:25,699 --> 01:34:26,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Our eyes are open.

1350
01:34:26,559 --> 01:34:27,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I just simply cannot.

1351
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:28,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot.

1352
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:30,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob's gonna cry.

1353
01:34:30,762 --> 01:34:35,267
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the perfect thing to do when you've solved problems in making things easier to find.

1354
01:34:36,008 --> 01:34:36,708
[SPEAKER_03]: You cancel it.

1355
01:34:36,789 --> 01:34:37,870
[SPEAKER_03]: That's perfect.

1356
01:34:38,991 --> 01:34:39,932
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense to me.

1357
01:34:42,695 --> 01:34:44,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much makes sense anymore in this world.

1358
01:34:46,078 --> 01:34:51,221
[SPEAKER_05]: So enjoy this very special store that you can only download for a limited time.

1359
01:34:51,721 --> 01:34:55,643
[SPEAKER_05]: And Salacious Pop's asking, so is it like a skin or what?

1360
01:34:55,743 --> 01:34:56,764
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I don't know.

1361
01:34:57,244 --> 01:34:59,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just told it's like this super special new way.

1362
01:34:59,845 --> 01:35:00,566
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fairy dust, okay?

1363
01:35:00,606 --> 01:35:01,586
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fairy dust.

1364
01:35:07,129 --> 01:35:07,730
[SPEAKER_05]: I got nothing.

1365
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:11,752
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna offer this free game for a limited time.

1366
01:35:12,052 --> 01:35:17,055
[SPEAKER_03]: It's featuring a car from Toyota called the Yaris.

1367
01:35:17,776 --> 01:35:19,057
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna blow your mind.

1368
01:35:20,137 --> 01:35:21,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, you guys.

1369
01:35:22,279 --> 01:35:24,440
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna put out this vision camera.

1370
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:26,462
[SPEAKER_08]: That was so bad it made me burp.

1371
01:35:26,722 --> 01:35:32,286
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna put out this camera, and it's gonna allow you to play these awesome fucking games like Totem Ball!

1372
01:35:33,066 --> 01:35:36,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's like pinball, but you use your hands.

1373
01:35:37,629 --> 01:35:39,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Use your hands, you flail.

1374
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:42,314
[SPEAKER_05]: You make the pinball thingy go.

1375
01:35:44,116 --> 01:35:49,922
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, this is the same company that's putting out a camera this year that you're going to use your hands to...

1376
01:35:51,725 --> 01:35:54,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, it's too painful.

1377
01:35:54,188 --> 01:35:58,814
[SPEAKER_03]: What if it's too late for me to sell back my vision camera for, say, some store credit?

1378
01:36:00,756 --> 01:36:09,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Slaces pop and our chatroom says, Major Nelson announces new store, announces that Seattle has the best weed and that this dude at Rare takes the biggest bong hits he's ever seen.

1379
01:36:12,631 --> 01:36:12,971
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1380
01:36:13,091 --> 01:36:14,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need to take a... What?

1381
01:36:15,592 --> 01:36:16,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Loki.

1382
01:36:16,352 --> 01:36:16,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Final.

1383
01:36:16,812 --> 01:36:17,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a great idea.

1384
01:36:18,052 --> 01:36:18,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1385
01:36:18,932 --> 01:36:21,793
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to show off the Kinect to get people excited about it.

1386
01:36:22,453 --> 01:36:25,734
[SPEAKER_03]: What store can we back Kinect with?

1387
01:36:27,294 --> 01:36:28,414
[SPEAKER_03]: God.

1388
01:36:28,434 --> 01:36:29,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Macy's.

1389
01:36:30,974 --> 01:36:37,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do all the people that play Kinect gather on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays between noon and 8 p.m.? ?

1390
01:36:39,451 --> 01:36:40,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are they all at?

1391
01:36:40,452 --> 01:36:41,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Where would I go?

1392
01:36:41,593 --> 01:36:42,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Would I go to the mini golf?

1393
01:36:42,534 --> 01:36:43,655
[SPEAKER_05]: No, fuck the mini golf place.

1394
01:36:43,975 --> 01:36:46,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Would I go to the movies?

1395
01:36:46,517 --> 01:36:46,777
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.

1396
01:36:46,857 --> 01:36:47,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Kinect players don't go to the movies.

1397
01:36:47,918 --> 01:36:48,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1398
01:36:48,479 --> 01:36:52,002
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go to Macy's, who doesn't even have an electronics department.

1399
01:36:54,624 --> 01:36:55,645
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck?

1400
01:36:58,247 --> 01:36:59,208
[SPEAKER_04]: You're all high.

1401
01:37:05,746 --> 01:37:08,087
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's take a look at the way they did it in the past.

1402
01:37:08,127 --> 01:37:10,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see how you used to get high in the 80s, huh?

1403
01:37:10,648 --> 01:37:14,949
[SPEAKER_05]: With the trip down memory lane and the classic game of the week.

1404
01:37:15,029 --> 01:37:15,489
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1405
01:37:15,729 --> 01:37:20,871
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take a moment to see the drug-induced effects of video games back in the day.

1406
01:37:20,911 --> 01:37:25,032
[SPEAKER_05]: And boy, did Jamie pick a good one tonight for this topic, didn't you, Jamie?

1407
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:27,913
[SPEAKER_08]: I sure did.

1408
01:37:28,053 --> 01:37:31,034
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to point out, she picks these well before the show starts.

1409
01:37:31,114 --> 01:37:32,615
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just too good tonight.

1410
01:37:40,089 --> 01:37:43,470
[SPEAKER_08]: and I really put this in honor of Classic Gaming Expo because it's there every year.

1411
01:37:43,490 --> 01:37:46,211
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean the whatever the fuck I went to.

1412
01:37:46,231 --> 01:37:46,931
[SPEAKER_05]: California Extreme.

1413
01:37:47,591 --> 01:37:48,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever that thing was.

1414
01:37:48,811 --> 01:37:49,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, California Extreme.

1415
01:37:49,892 --> 01:37:51,712
[SPEAKER_05]: The event that let you in free with a media pass?

1416
01:37:51,732 --> 01:37:52,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1417
01:37:52,472 --> 01:37:53,713
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, they were great.

1418
01:37:54,673 --> 01:37:58,274
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm covering it media-like and stuff.

1419
01:37:58,954 --> 01:38:03,635
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, she just took another bike and in folks, so you're in for a real treat in part B. My old one was wearing off.

1420
01:38:03,675 --> 01:38:04,956
[SPEAKER_08]: I was in pain.

1421
01:38:06,156 --> 01:38:09,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, so yeah, Journey.

1422
01:38:10,835 --> 01:38:23,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Valley Midway put it out in the 80s, and it was after Frontiers, which was their 1983 album by Journey, got them really popular.

1423
01:38:24,262 --> 01:38:24,482
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1424
01:38:26,630 --> 01:38:28,852
[SPEAKER_08]: It was supposed to go along with the U.S.

1425
01:38:29,053 --> 01:38:40,124
[SPEAKER_08]: band tour, and then it was actually brought in Incredible Technologies, which is the second team of developers, to bring it out for Christmas around that time.

1426
01:38:40,905 --> 01:38:48,934
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it features who the band members were at the time, which were Steve Perry, Neil Sean, Steve Smith, Jonathan Cain, and Ross Valerie.

1427
01:38:50,416 --> 01:38:57,426
[SPEAKER_08]: They have sort of cartoon bodies, but their faces are really like these digital black and white photographs from while they were on tour.

1428
01:39:01,465 --> 01:39:08,488
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was supposed to use this photo technology for another game, but it failed in location testing.

1429
01:39:08,508 --> 01:39:17,851
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, you have to go through the game to find the different musical instruments or a microphone.

1430
01:39:18,552 --> 01:39:24,894
[SPEAKER_08]: So you play each of the members of the band in these different levels to get their missing musical implement.

1431
01:39:26,455 --> 01:39:27,275
[SPEAKER_08]: And now, turn this up.

1432
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:35,399
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1433
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:08,124
[SPEAKER_08]: There was another game that Journey was in.

1434
01:40:08,164 --> 01:40:09,967
[SPEAKER_08]: It was called Journey Escape for the Atari 2600.

1435
01:40:11,974 --> 01:40:19,056
[SPEAKER_08]: This was listed as number 9 on the top 10 worst licensed game ideas ever for Game Informer 2007.

1436
01:40:19,136 --> 01:40:24,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Game Informer doesn't know dick, apparently, because Journey is awesome.

1437
01:40:25,077 --> 01:40:26,997
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see what this Journey Escape thing is.

1438
01:40:27,517 --> 01:40:28,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Journey Escape.

1439
01:40:29,378 --> 01:40:30,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's from Emmanuel.

1440
01:40:30,678 --> 01:40:34,559
[SPEAKER_08]: You're on a boat with Journey, one of the world's hottest rock groups.

1441
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:37,841
[SPEAKER_08]: A spectacular performance has just ended.

1442
01:40:38,301 --> 01:40:50,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's up to you to guide each Journey band member past hordes of love-crazy groupies, sneaky photographers, and shifty-eyed promoters to the safety of the Journey escape vehicle in time to make it to the next concert.

1443
01:40:50,691 --> 01:40:55,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Your mighty manager and loyal roadies are there to help, but the escape is up to you.

1444
01:40:57,236 --> 01:40:58,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like a 10 to me.

1445
01:40:58,457 --> 01:41:01,980
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to make it to the Scarab escape vehicle, the same one that's on the cover.

1446
01:41:03,821 --> 01:41:04,342
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, right?

1447
01:41:05,598 --> 01:41:10,501
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very different from the arcade game, so if you only played the 2600... The song Escape, though, ironically, is not in the game.

1448
01:41:11,441 --> 01:41:13,042
[SPEAKER_08]: But the intro is Don't Stop Believin'.

1449
01:41:14,443 --> 01:41:14,763
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1450
01:41:15,203 --> 01:41:15,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1451
01:41:16,224 --> 01:41:18,124
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is, your classic game of the week.

1452
01:41:18,325 --> 01:41:21,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and by the way, the manager is the Kool-Aid Man.

1453
01:41:23,107 --> 01:41:23,407
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1454
01:41:24,348 --> 01:41:25,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Of the 2600 version?

1455
01:41:25,248 --> 01:41:28,830
[SPEAKER_08]: The manager is inexplicably depicted as the Kool-Aid Man.

1456
01:41:28,850 --> 01:41:30,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Kool-Aid Man!

1457
01:41:31,191 --> 01:41:32,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah!

1458
01:41:32,512 --> 01:41:33,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no!

1459
01:41:35,086 --> 01:41:36,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Naughty, naughty, cool aid.

1460
01:42:00,235 --> 01:42:27,866

01:42:53,643 --> 01:43:01,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this July the 18th, 2010 where we are taping live at All Games Radio.

1463
01:43:01,348 --> 01:43:07,032
[SPEAKER_05]: We're moving into part B of our show and I gotta tell you, if you're just tuning in, we've had a pretty funny show so far.

1464
01:43:07,452 --> 01:43:11,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of fun chatter in part A, just a lot of weird news.

1465
01:43:11,254 --> 01:43:15,137
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a very weird week in gaming and a lot of strange ideas going on out there.

1466
01:43:15,957 --> 01:43:32,661
[SPEAKER_05]: and the fun is going to continue here in part B if you are just joining us come to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and have your say because you know the big part of our show what makes our show unique is you and your chats and your tweets that we're going to get to in a minute and all that good stuff

1467
01:43:33,121 --> 01:43:50,089
[SPEAKER_05]: and I also want to call this out your awesome iTunes reviews when you say like nice things about us on the internet that make us feel warm and fuzzy I want to read one here in a minute but I got to pull it up so in the meantime let's get to some rapid fire news and things that happened throughout the week that you know we can mention in a few seconds

1468
01:43:51,870 --> 01:44:01,137
[SPEAKER_03]: The Expendables, a pretty awesome movie coming out this summer with a bunch of old action stars, is going to be getting its own Facebook game.

1469
01:44:02,598 --> 01:44:04,820
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very similar to Contra.

1470
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:06,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody loves Contra.

1471
01:44:06,801 --> 01:44:13,607
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little similar, I guess, because you can kill a bunch of people on a 2D platformer.

1472
01:44:14,207 --> 01:44:16,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonic Colors Sonic the Hedgehog Hat

1473
01:44:36,579 --> 01:44:37,080
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1474
01:45:04,180 --> 01:45:12,166
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is a new Oddworld game in the works being developed by the company Just Add Water.

1475
01:45:12,986 --> 01:45:16,388
[SPEAKER_03]: And they did a game called Gravity Crash.

1476
01:45:16,929 --> 01:45:26,095
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently it's got the... There are multiple projects across multiple platforms starring all your favorite Oddworld characters.

1477
01:45:27,195 --> 01:45:31,698
[SPEAKER_03]: And they haven't said exactly when they're actually coming out, but...

1478
01:45:32,859 --> 01:45:37,541
[SPEAKER_03]: You should just at least take solace that they are in the works.

1479
01:45:38,341 --> 01:45:41,122
[SPEAKER_03]: At some point soon, we'll see some Oddworld games come back.

1480
01:45:42,743 --> 01:45:44,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I got some quick stories for you guys.

1481
01:45:44,863 --> 01:45:46,404
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them is about Kid Icarus.

1482
01:45:46,744 --> 01:45:47,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Kid Icarus?

1483
01:45:47,344 --> 01:45:47,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Kid Icarus?

1484
01:45:47,945 --> 01:45:48,505
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Kid Icarus.

1485
01:45:49,505 --> 01:45:52,666
[SPEAKER_05]: This is some other news coming out about Kid Icarus Uprising.

1486
01:45:52,726 --> 01:45:59,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, that's the 3DS game that finally brings back Kid Icarus after not being around ever since that Game Boy game.

1487
01:46:00,509 --> 01:46:11,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, in a chat with Games Master, this is a magazine in the UK, Mashihiro Sakurai, who is the game designer at Super Smash Bros.

1488
01:46:11,397 --> 01:46:15,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Brawl, says that the online capabilities are currently being tested.

1489
01:46:21,764 --> 01:46:24,665
[SPEAKER_05]: There could be some versus play, but we can't go into any detail.

1490
01:46:24,925 --> 01:46:29,666
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot of capabilities that expand on what was in the DS that people are taking advantage of.

1491
01:46:30,086 --> 01:46:30,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

1492
01:46:30,746 --> 01:46:37,528
[SPEAKER_05]: So it sounds like the online and versus and all that's being toyed with, but we don't know anything for sure just yet.

1493
01:46:37,548 --> 01:46:42,089
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's kind of cool because I don't know about you guys, but I just assumed it was like a one player only thing.

1494
01:46:43,329 --> 01:46:43,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1495
01:46:44,570 --> 01:46:51,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, apparently some Capcom games are going to be making their way to the Wii Virtual Console Arcade.

1496
01:46:52,941 --> 01:46:58,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes you forget that the Virtual Console has an arcade, but they're going to be getting some Capcom games in an announcement this week.

1497
01:46:58,990 --> 01:47:01,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Among some other Capcom announcements, we'll get into it a little bit.

1498
01:47:01,733 --> 01:47:02,794
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's going to be kind of cool.

1499
01:47:02,814 --> 01:47:03,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Some old school Capcom games.

1500
01:47:04,415 --> 01:47:17,584
[SPEAKER_05]: A place where Capcom games would be welcomed would be Game Room, who saw the release of Fishing Derby, Barnstorming, and Quad Run all on the Atari 2600 this week, as well as the Gyruss for the arcade and Hover Force for the Intellivision.

1501
01:47:17,984 --> 01:47:22,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, as awesome as it is to have Gyruss in Game Room, it was already on the Xbox Live Arcade.

1502
01:47:23,328 --> 01:47:28,271
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's probably the most awesome game that hit this week, but it already had a version released.

1503
01:47:28,811 --> 01:47:31,213
[SPEAKER_05]: So unfortunately, Game Room didn't have a lot of win there.

1504
01:47:31,593 --> 01:47:35,596
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I will say one place where Game Room wins, and I mentioned this in Part A, but I wanted to say this as well.

1505
01:47:35,696 --> 01:47:40,900
[SPEAKER_05]: It did have a little upgrade this week that, you know, they patched into the game some new little features.

1506
01:47:41,241 --> 01:47:50,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Like now, like if you've been playing a game for a long time, the other avatars will come up behind you and start watching you and like applaud you when you finally, you know, I guess lose.

1507
01:47:50,908 --> 01:47:53,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, I don't know why they applaud you when you lose, but I think it's like...

1508
01:47:53,690 --> 01:47:55,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1509
01:48:16,424 --> 01:48:18,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really happy to see that they are doing updates.

1510
01:48:18,886 --> 01:48:20,386
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes me very hopeful for the future.

1511
01:48:20,827 --> 01:48:24,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they just need some more licenses like the we got with Capcom this week.

1512
01:48:24,369 --> 01:48:25,029
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be great.

1513
01:48:25,689 --> 01:48:26,290
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see.

1514
01:48:26,510 --> 01:48:26,970
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

1515
01:48:27,971 --> 01:48:32,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, something great coming out for iPhone will be Star Wars Battle for Hoth.

1516
01:48:34,374 --> 01:48:37,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially good for fans of the Empire Strikes Back, right?

1517
01:48:37,796 --> 01:48:43,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Which people will arguably say is the best Star Trek movie, although I am personally a fan of Return of the Jedi.

1518
01:48:43,940 --> 01:48:44,360
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just me.

1519
01:48:44,932 --> 01:48:47,435
[SPEAKER_05]: I think A New Hope was the best one.

1520
01:48:47,655 --> 01:48:48,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah!

1521
01:48:48,676 --> 01:48:49,157
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I'm weird.

1522
01:48:52,881 --> 01:48:53,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

1523
01:48:54,162 --> 01:48:59,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, it's going to be out for $2.99 and it's meant to celebrate the 30 year anniversary of The Empire Strikes Back.

1524
01:49:00,068 --> 01:49:00,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty cool, huh?

1525
01:49:01,210 --> 01:49:01,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

1526
01:49:02,817 --> 01:49:05,839
[SPEAKER_08]: For Rock Band News, we have The Stooges and Bad Religion.

1527
01:49:06,279 --> 01:49:16,445
[SPEAKER_08]: The Stooges Pack 01, which total will be 440 Microsoft points, or $5.49, includes 1969, I Wanna Be Your Dog, and No Fun.

1528
01:49:17,005 --> 01:49:21,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Each of those, well actually, 1969 and No Fun will be 200 Wii points apiece.

1529
01:49:22,488 --> 01:49:28,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, I was wondering why it's only saying that one of them has a Microsoft points list.

1530
01:49:28,471 --> 01:49:29,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Forget I said that.

1531
01:49:29,492 --> 01:49:30,172
[SPEAKER_08]: They're about 99 apiece.

1532
01:49:32,113 --> 01:49:53,086
[SPEAKER_08]: individual songs coming out are both by Bad Religion, New Dark Ages, and No Control each 160 Microsoft points or 200 Wii points and they will of course some of them being the Stooges Pack and No Control by Bad Religion will be in Lego Rock Band Store I love Bad Religion, great band

1533
01:49:54,461 --> 01:49:55,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we're gonna get into this.

1534
01:49:56,262 --> 01:49:56,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1535
01:49:56,723 --> 01:49:57,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you were done.

1536
01:49:57,423 --> 01:49:57,723
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad.

1537
01:49:57,763 --> 01:49:58,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I have three.

1538
01:49:59,024 --> 01:49:59,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, my bad.

1539
01:50:01,526 --> 01:50:02,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob is ignoring me.

1540
01:50:03,447 --> 01:50:04,969
[SPEAKER_07]: I am being marginalized.

1541
01:50:05,009 --> 01:50:06,570
[SPEAKER_07]: I am multitasking.

1542
01:50:06,850 --> 01:50:08,431
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought I heard three things.

1543
01:50:08,611 --> 01:50:10,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm being marginalized.

1544
01:50:10,352 --> 01:50:11,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm a woman.

1545
01:50:12,994 --> 01:50:13,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, because you're a woman.

1546
01:50:14,978 --> 01:50:15,418
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

1547
01:50:15,839 --> 01:50:16,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

1548
01:50:18,061 --> 01:50:25,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Now there is this really cool dude who has an even cooler, I would have to say, I guess they're married by now, I don't know.

1549
01:50:26,348 --> 01:50:37,757
[SPEAKER_08]: But his name is Ray Arifanto, who works for Xbox platform team, is getting married or has gotten married, and his wedding ring is fantastic.

1550
01:50:40,079 --> 01:50:43,142
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a USB platinum wedding ring.

1551
01:50:45,015 --> 01:50:51,502
[SPEAKER_08]: and on it it says, For a Lifetime of Memories.

1552
01:50:53,704 --> 01:50:54,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that pun-tastic?

1553
01:50:56,111 --> 01:50:59,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it actually like you could plug it in a USB slot with the ring?

1554
01:50:59,572 --> 01:51:00,332
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't need it.

1555
01:51:00,532 --> 01:51:17,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I read, though, Rob, I did read about another one, and I tried to find the pictures of it, and I couldn't, about a couple that did have a USB wedding ring, a real USB wedding ring, and on it were photos of their courtship.

1556
01:51:18,496 --> 01:51:25,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that's kind of what I thought of when you first talked about a USB writing ring, like somebody's going to plug one in.

1557
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:29,481
[SPEAKER_08]: This one's just sort of cut into a USB-looking pattern.

1558
01:51:30,282 --> 01:51:44,929
[SPEAKER_08]: But no, I did actually find one about a couple that actually did have their rings each were photos of their lives together built into the ring.

1559
01:51:45,189 --> 01:51:45,749
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

1560
01:52:10,646 --> 01:52:12,450
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually planning on making one for myself.

1561
01:52:21,843 --> 01:52:28,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, see, that's actually a plan that I have, is getting one of those little kind of rubber with USB clasp, as it were.

1562
01:52:29,450 --> 01:52:40,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, I mean, I had to repeat for the staff a couple of times that I'm allergic to penicillin and amoxicillin and the sillins of the family, the molds, you know.

1563
01:52:40,439 --> 01:52:44,823
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was just thinking, what if I had fallen unconscious and had a bad infection?

1564
01:52:44,843 --> 01:52:46,685
[SPEAKER_08]: They tried to give me penicillin, you know.

1565
01:52:47,826 --> 01:52:49,767
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that those are fantastic ideas.

1566
01:52:49,787 --> 01:52:52,689
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually looking into the cost of just making it myself.

1567
01:52:54,350 --> 01:53:00,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Either with a micro USB or doing a micro SD to have it embedded in there.

1568
01:53:02,615 --> 01:53:03,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Bones is 6, 006.

1569
01:53:04,857 --> 01:53:05,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Bones is 6.

1570
01:53:05,637 --> 01:53:07,819
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two Zs, which makes it very strange to pronounce.

1571
01:53:07,899 --> 01:53:11,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Bones is 6 in our chat room says a USB dildo.

1572
01:53:12,442 --> 01:53:15,804
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you could charge it kind of like you do an iPhone.

1573
01:53:17,106 --> 01:53:19,127
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not outside the realm of possibility.

1574
01:53:19,167 --> 01:53:20,669
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it's sadly been done.

1575
01:53:20,689 --> 01:53:27,895
[SPEAKER_05]: They have USB AA batteries that can charge in the... Salacious Pop says RFID would seem more intuitive.

1576
01:53:27,915 --> 01:53:28,996
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they use for pets.

1577
01:53:29,456 --> 01:53:30,337
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even think about that.

1578
01:53:30,397 --> 01:53:33,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, if a pet gets lost, that's all you'd need.

1579
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:34,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Crazy.

1580
01:53:35,321 --> 01:53:37,702
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we're going to get into Twitter topics here real quick.

1581
01:53:37,722 --> 01:53:39,222
[SPEAKER_05]: But first, I mentioned I was going to read this.

1582
01:53:39,623 --> 01:53:45,204
[SPEAKER_05]: We are so appreciative when people leave us nice reviews on iTunes on our listing there because it helps us spread the word about our show.

1583
01:53:45,585 --> 01:53:49,166
[SPEAKER_05]: This one was especially nice, so I wanted to read this real quick because it's awesome.

1584
01:53:49,746 --> 01:53:52,947
[SPEAKER_05]: It's from HungryMrDrunk is the name of the user.

1585
01:53:54,107 --> 01:53:55,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I know when I get drunk, I get hungry.

1586
01:53:56,308 --> 01:53:58,489
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been a hardcore listener, LOL, for years.

1587
01:53:58,669 --> 01:54:00,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to mention we are the official podcast of the universe.

1588
01:54:18,030 --> 01:54:18,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it's funny.

1589
01:54:19,031 --> 01:54:22,592
[SPEAKER_05]: He actually says in the title, why OLR is the best podcast in the galaxy.

1590
01:54:22,953 --> 01:54:26,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Although technically it's official video game podcast of the galaxy.

1591
01:54:27,195 --> 01:54:28,936
[SPEAKER_08]: But I like being called best too.

1592
01:54:29,396 --> 01:54:29,916
[SPEAKER_05]: It is nice.

1593
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:30,596
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very nice.

1594
01:54:30,636 --> 01:54:32,677
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a very sweet thank you person.

1595
01:54:33,378 --> 01:54:34,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Hungry Mr. Drunk.

1596
01:54:35,359 --> 01:54:37,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Hungry Mr. Drunk, you should come over and have a beer with me.

1597
01:54:37,900 --> 01:54:38,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's right.

1598
01:54:38,440 --> 01:54:41,382
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope your next week brings you lots of Guinness and Cheetos.

1599
01:54:41,722 --> 01:54:42,042
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1600
01:54:42,963 --> 01:54:44,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into Twitter topics.

1601
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:46,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Shall we move into Twitter topics?

1602
01:54:46,264 --> 01:54:46,664
[SPEAKER_05]: We shall.

1603
01:54:46,945 --> 01:54:47,325
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

1604
01:54:48,260 --> 01:54:48,821
[SPEAKER_05]: You gas?

1605
01:54:49,361 --> 01:54:49,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I gas.

1606
01:54:51,084 --> 01:54:51,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Get a fan.

1607
01:54:51,724 --> 01:54:53,587
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a god, Rob.

1608
01:54:53,707 --> 01:54:54,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a god.

1609
01:54:56,630 --> 01:54:57,812
[SPEAKER_08]: When did you last take a bike?

1610
01:54:59,013 --> 01:54:59,834
[SPEAKER_08]: An hour ago?

1611
01:55:00,555 --> 01:55:01,336
[SPEAKER_05]: So during the show?

1612
01:55:01,897 --> 01:55:03,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it is during the show.

1613
01:55:03,419 --> 01:55:04,019
[SPEAKER_05]: During the show.

1614
01:55:05,261 --> 01:55:05,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1615
01:55:05,802 --> 01:55:07,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

1616
01:55:08,991 --> 01:55:10,393
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1617
01:55:26,449 --> 01:55:29,291
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's hitting me harder than it really used to.

1618
01:55:29,311 --> 01:55:31,453
[SPEAKER_08]: It is.

1619
01:55:32,273 --> 01:55:33,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I get to the Twitter topic?

1620
01:55:33,854 --> 01:55:34,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Kitty!

1621
01:55:35,075 --> 01:55:35,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1622
01:55:35,996 --> 01:55:38,337
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Matt sent me this link.

1623
01:55:38,998 --> 01:55:40,619
[SPEAKER_05]: It has nothing to do with anything.

1624
01:55:41,339 --> 01:55:46,062
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why I really don't like to click on YouTubes during the show, but SSJ100Matt's kind of funny.

1625
01:55:46,483 --> 01:55:48,364
[SPEAKER_05]: And he sent this link and it's adorable.

1626
01:55:48,404 --> 01:55:50,225
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, this new game's coming to the Wii.

1627
01:55:50,846 --> 01:55:55,849
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this box comes up with nine little holes in it.

1628
01:55:57,450 --> 01:56:01,112
[SPEAKER_05]: and then little kitties come out of the holes and get boxed.

1629
01:56:03,553 --> 01:56:04,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, send that to me, Rob.

1630
01:56:04,974 --> 01:56:05,774
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so adorable.

1631
01:56:05,814 --> 01:56:06,434
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in our chat.

1632
01:56:06,474 --> 01:56:07,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you in chat?

1633
01:56:08,035 --> 01:56:09,836
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in chat.

1634
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:10,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt just posted this.

1635
01:56:10,877 --> 01:56:11,557
[SPEAKER_05]: It's adorable.

1636
01:56:12,117 --> 01:56:13,978
[SPEAKER_05]: This makes for terrible radio.

1637
01:56:14,258 --> 01:56:15,579
[SPEAKER_05]: This is awful, terrible, horrible radio.

1638
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:16,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll put it on Facebook.

1639
01:56:17,620 --> 01:56:18,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's put it on Facebook.

1640
01:56:19,841 --> 01:56:21,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I get to Twitter topics already?

1641
01:56:22,563 --> 01:56:22,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1642
01:56:24,379 --> 01:56:42,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter.com slash OLR Follow us, ask us questions, we answer Dr. Tsuyu wants us to plug RetroReview Oh no, he says he's planning one I don't think I saw it posted yet But Dr. Tsuyu does a lot of great work for the site, so thanks very much Let's see, Sterlok wants to give a shameless plug Is this turning into the shameless plug segment?

1643
01:56:42,789 --> 01:56:51,214
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it is Actually, I really like this article though, so I am going to let him have his shameless plug He wrote an article for geek-life.com That's us, geek-life.com

1644
01:56:51,434 --> 01:56:52,315
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1645
01:57:06,972 --> 01:57:07,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1646
01:57:27,702 --> 01:57:29,404
[SPEAKER_05]: StarCraft II cost $100 million to make.

1647
01:57:29,424 --> 01:57:29,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1648
01:57:29,804 --> 01:57:31,906
[SPEAKER_05]: That apparently is according to the Wall Street Journal.

1649
01:57:31,926 --> 01:57:34,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Activision Blizzard spent $100 million on the three-part sequel.

1650
01:57:34,148 --> 01:57:36,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did all that money go?

1651
01:57:36,730 --> 01:57:37,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

1652
01:57:54,508 --> 01:58:07,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess this game's gonna be epic beyond epic purely development and that has nothing to do with marketing exceeds Gran Turismo 5's 60 million development cost they'll make it all back that's the sick part

1653
01:58:08,235 --> 01:58:13,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, let's see, also from TigerClaw, Killer gets two life sentences in an Xbox-motivated murder.

1654
01:58:14,698 --> 01:58:26,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate stories like these, because usually they have nothing, I mean, no offense to TigerClaw, because he's pulling it from a game blog, but I just, I hate that this stuff gets tied to gaming at all, because it's just that this guy's just sick.

1655
01:58:27,365 --> 01:58:30,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Some sicko killed people, and it somehow involved an Xbox.

1656
01:58:32,679 --> 01:58:39,422
[SPEAKER_05]: His name is Kyle Sebastian Scott, 19 years old, and he killed a 22-year-old in January of last year.

1657
01:58:39,462 --> 01:58:43,024
[SPEAKER_05]: He hid his body in a ravine near a hiking trail in Colorado Springs.

1658
01:58:46,806 --> 01:58:50,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, he wanted the guy's Xbox and killed the guy.

1659
01:58:50,567 --> 01:58:51,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this is even better.

1660
01:58:52,188 --> 01:58:55,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason Hawley, the victim, 22 years old, developmentally disabled.

1661
01:58:58,363 --> 01:59:01,464
[SPEAKER_05]: And the judge said he trusted you, he would have given you anything, and he did.

1662
01:59:01,844 --> 01:59:04,685
[SPEAKER_05]: You could have taken the Xbox and he would have never told anybody.

1663
01:59:05,125 --> 01:59:07,626
[SPEAKER_05]: He was trying to be normal, a buddy, or one of the guys.

1664
01:59:07,726 --> 01:59:08,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Two life sentences.

1665
01:59:08,967 --> 01:59:09,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Not enough.

1666
01:59:10,648 --> 01:59:11,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Not enough.

1667
01:59:15,222 --> 01:59:16,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Spazinator is sending us an update.

1668
01:59:16,823 --> 01:59:19,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember he called in last week to talk about his Sony woes?

1669
01:59:19,746 --> 01:59:20,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Update, update.

1670
01:59:21,247 --> 01:59:26,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony Computer Entertainment of America finally gave back my remaining 55 videos this past Monday.

1671
01:59:26,672 --> 01:59:27,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo, that's a lot.

1672
01:59:27,773 --> 01:59:29,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Still rather pissed that it took so damn long.

1673
01:59:30,195 --> 01:59:34,258
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually called me as they were doing it so I could confirm if they had everything.

1674
01:59:34,658 --> 01:59:36,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's kind of nice, I guess.

1675
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:37,020
[SPEAKER_05]: At least they did that.

1676
01:59:38,522 --> 01:59:59,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Jay Jugo on Twitter is listening to some old episodes of OLR I guess this is a never forget kind of moment Hey guys, here's a funny flashback Procrastination is like masturbation It feels good until you realize you fucked yourself Irene said that quote on your 6th episode Just wanted to share that flashback moment with you guys Keep up the great work Nice

1677
02:00:01,107 --> 02:00:02,048
[SPEAKER_05]: OldSchoolOLR.

1678
02:00:02,088 --> 02:00:02,989
[SPEAKER_05]: They do exist out there.

1679
02:00:03,009 --> 02:00:04,270
[SPEAKER_05]: They're out there if you know where to look.

1680
02:00:04,410 --> 02:00:06,712
[SPEAKER_03]: The pictures are now finally on the website.

1681
02:00:06,812 --> 02:00:13,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, my initial email bounced because apparently there's too many pictures attached.

1682
02:00:14,279 --> 02:00:15,801
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I'm sending them two at a time.

1683
02:00:16,181 --> 02:00:22,687
[SPEAKER_03]: So remember, folks, if you're going to upload pictures to the website, do so in small quantities because the email may not be able to handle it.

1684
02:00:23,047 --> 02:00:24,389
[SPEAKER_05]: But now you can see pictures of Baby Room.

1685
02:00:24,409 --> 02:00:26,492
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're right there in the header of orangehoundstudio.com, right?

1686
02:00:26,512 --> 02:00:27,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they are up at the top.

1687
02:00:27,594 --> 02:00:30,638
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I'm just waiting for the last two to refresh on here.

1688
02:00:30,918 --> 02:00:31,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a look.

1689
02:00:31,860 --> 02:00:32,581
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're awesome.

1690
02:00:32,701 --> 02:00:37,628
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, if you look at the gallery, you can see my progress of last week, which was not much progress.

1691
02:00:40,607 --> 02:00:46,213
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya says, anyone be interested in an OLR game in the same style of the Journey coin-op?

1692
02:00:46,293 --> 02:00:48,155
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been wanting to do that for quite some time.

1693
02:00:48,676 --> 02:00:51,419
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be awesome if you could actually do it.

1694
02:00:51,579 --> 02:00:53,881
[SPEAKER_05]: That is no small programming feat.

1695
02:00:53,901 --> 02:00:55,203
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be cool.

1696
02:00:56,840 --> 02:00:58,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, of course, I'd love that.

1697
02:00:58,041 --> 02:00:59,442
[SPEAKER_05]: The Journey arcade game is rad.

1698
02:00:59,802 --> 02:01:01,163
[SPEAKER_05]: It's classic game of the week now.

1699
02:01:01,403 --> 02:01:02,103
[SPEAKER_05]: It's official.

1700
02:01:03,284 --> 02:01:04,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Lastly, Redertainment.

1701
02:01:04,544 --> 02:01:07,546
[SPEAKER_05]: What nerd thing makes you think of an old TV show?

1702
02:01:08,127 --> 02:01:11,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine is the red green show after the duct tape iPhone 4 fix.

1703
02:01:13,615 --> 02:01:14,696
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1704
02:01:34,286 --> 02:01:34,686
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1705
02:01:34,786 --> 02:01:35,127
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1706
02:01:35,147 --> 02:01:35,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget it.

1707
02:01:38,129 --> 02:01:39,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Wizard never really dies.

1708
02:01:39,990 --> 02:01:43,152
[SPEAKER_03]: You see, he's figured out a way to become one with the Force.

1709
02:01:44,113 --> 02:01:45,834
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just going to disappear into a robe.

1710
02:01:46,074 --> 02:01:51,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I just thought about Finders Keepers, thinking about the Xbox store earlier, so I guess it does happen once in a while.

1711
02:01:51,297 --> 02:01:52,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I think of old TV shows.

1712
02:01:52,278 --> 02:01:52,438
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1713
02:01:52,458 --> 02:01:54,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there something nerdy that makes you think of an old TV show?

1714
02:01:55,780 --> 02:01:59,143
[SPEAKER_05]: The status of the gaming industry and the show Bonkers.

1715
02:02:01,724 --> 02:02:04,106
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's pretty close there.

1716
02:02:06,245 --> 02:02:08,586
[SPEAKER_05]: A co-worker said this to me the other day, and I like this.

1717
02:02:08,606 --> 02:02:17,949
[SPEAKER_05]: This really has nothing to do with gaming or nerd, but she said, you know, sometimes my life here feels like the dinosaurs TV show and that little baby.

1718
02:02:18,369 --> 02:02:19,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the mama.

1719
02:02:19,309 --> 02:02:20,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the mama.

1720
02:02:20,029 --> 02:02:21,630
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1721
02:02:21,670 --> 02:02:22,270
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny to me.

1722
02:02:22,570 --> 02:02:23,530
[SPEAKER_08]: That is pretty funny, Rob.

1723
02:02:24,931 --> 02:02:27,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything you want to add, DarkSakura?

1724
02:02:28,172 --> 02:02:29,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know.

1725
02:02:29,312 --> 02:02:32,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually I think about my job, and all I can think about is...

1726
02:02:34,819 --> 02:02:35,460
[SPEAKER_08]: What was that?

1727
02:02:38,944 --> 02:02:39,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Running Man.

1728
02:02:41,046 --> 02:02:41,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Blade Runner?

1729
02:02:42,107 --> 02:02:43,469
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Running Man.

1730
02:02:43,509 --> 02:02:48,134
[SPEAKER_08]: The one where he's trapped in a game show and to get out he has to escape.

1731
02:02:51,658 --> 02:02:53,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Richard Dawson was the villain.

1732
02:02:53,720 --> 02:02:54,641
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.

1733
02:02:56,465 --> 02:03:10,056
[SPEAKER_03]: The best part about that movie Alright Let's move on with some more news Back to gaming news That's almost as cool as Mega Race With Don Knotts or something Don Knotts was not in that, was he?

1734
02:03:11,537 --> 02:03:16,001
[SPEAKER_03]: There was somebody who was like Don Knotts in that game In that game

1735
02:03:16,918 --> 02:03:17,619
[SPEAKER_03]: It was weird.

1736
02:03:18,039 --> 02:03:19,660
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Don Knotts was not in The Running Man.

1737
02:03:20,341 --> 02:03:21,562
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have been even more epic.

1738
02:03:22,122 --> 02:03:25,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Don Knotts should have been one of the killers in The Running Man.

1739
02:03:26,165 --> 02:03:27,226
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have been cool.

1740
02:03:28,627 --> 02:03:31,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Tiger Claw, by the way, says Mr. Wizard died in 2007.

1741
02:03:31,910 --> 02:03:32,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Don Herbert.

1742
02:03:32,730 --> 02:03:33,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so you know.

1743
02:03:33,911 --> 02:03:35,092
[SPEAKER_05]: In case you weren't aware, Mr. Wizard is dead.

1744
02:03:35,132 --> 02:03:36,153
[SPEAKER_04]: And he hated kids.

1745
02:03:36,573 --> 02:03:38,034
[SPEAKER_04]: He did not hate kids.

1746
02:03:38,555 --> 02:03:39,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, he did.

1747
02:03:39,936 --> 02:03:43,478
[SPEAKER_03]: He loved kids as much as Mel Gibson loved his wife and girlfriend.

1748
02:03:43,498 --> 02:03:44,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, back to news stories.

1749
02:03:45,980 --> 02:03:49,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Mega Man Universe is a game that's coming out on the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade.

1750
02:04:05,899 --> 02:04:11,103
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a little teaser trailer that came out this week that featured absolutely no gameplay whatsoever.

1751
02:04:11,523 --> 02:04:14,385
[SPEAKER_03]: But it kind of gave us an idea of what we may expect.

1752
02:04:14,785 --> 02:04:25,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, the game will actually, I guess, combine universes in the Capcom, or different Capcom game universes.

1753
02:04:26,433 --> 02:04:34,579
[SPEAKER_03]: The teaser trailer showed, at one point, stop motion animation of Ryu, Arthur, from the Ghosts and... Ryu.

1754
02:04:35,459 --> 02:04:36,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Ryu, Ryu, whatever.

1755
02:04:37,083 --> 02:04:38,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying it the western way, okay?

1756
02:04:39,087 --> 02:04:40,249
[SPEAKER_03]: The improper way.

1757
02:04:40,710 --> 02:04:41,632
[SPEAKER_07]: You're wrong!

1758
02:04:43,010 --> 02:04:49,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine, Ryu, and Arthur from the Ghosts and Ghouls and Ghosts and Goblins series.

1759
02:04:50,374 --> 02:04:51,274
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, Mega Man.

1760
02:04:52,755 --> 02:04:56,137
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, facing off against a bunch of Mega Man villains.

1761
02:04:56,517 --> 02:05:06,042
[SPEAKER_03]: So, either I'm guessing that Mega Man's going to get powers from these other players or the other game heroes...

1762
02:05:06,942 --> 02:05:30,797
[SPEAKER_03]: or he's going to be teaming up I guess with kind of think of like the Super Mario crossover but you know the Super Capcom crossover with all these different characters from different series facing off against Mega Man characters or perhaps you know facing off against Capcom Universe characters although then you would wonder why it's called Mega Man Universe and not Capcom Universe.

1763
02:05:31,497 --> 02:05:32,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Toy Story Mega Man

1764
02:06:03,294 --> 02:06:07,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's 20XX.

1765
02:06:09,479 --> 02:06:21,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, there's something else I forgot at the very end that's kind of cool.

1766
02:06:21,990 --> 02:06:22,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Cutman.

1767
02:06:22,570 --> 02:06:26,534
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll turn this down a little bit so I can talk for a bit.

1768
02:06:29,281 --> 02:06:30,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it looks cool.

1769
02:06:30,142 --> 02:06:33,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Too bad this is all like a pre-rendered thing that the actual game is not going to look like.

1770
02:06:34,004 --> 02:06:35,365
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like stop motion animation.

1771
02:06:37,666 --> 02:06:38,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Sweet.

1772
02:06:40,808 --> 02:06:41,068
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1773
02:06:49,453 --> 02:06:50,914
[SPEAKER_08]: That little kid's probably on drugs.

1774
02:06:54,025 --> 02:06:56,226
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be, you know what this looks like to me?

1775
02:06:56,786 --> 02:06:58,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I tell you what this honestly, like I think right now?

1776
02:06:59,227 --> 02:07:02,208
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it looks like the Mega Man fighting game.

1777
02:07:02,888 --> 02:07:07,289
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's going to be like Capcom's own version of Capcom versus Capcom.

1778
02:07:08,790 --> 02:07:09,670
[SPEAKER_05]: If that makes any sense.

1779
02:07:09,790 --> 02:07:12,151
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the first impression I get of what this is.

1780
02:07:13,111 --> 02:07:13,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute.

1781
02:07:29,156 --> 02:07:29,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1782
02:07:32,557 --> 02:07:33,537
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's still in bed.

1783
02:07:33,597 --> 02:07:34,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Mega Man Universe.

1784
02:07:36,358 --> 02:07:36,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Your world.

1785
02:07:37,398 --> 02:07:38,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Megafied.

1786
02:07:38,899 --> 02:07:39,439
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

1787
02:07:51,832 --> 02:07:54,095
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the old Mega Man box art guy.

1788
02:07:54,155 --> 02:07:54,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1789
02:07:54,555 --> 02:07:56,477
[SPEAKER_03]: They're gonna have the Mega Man box art Mega Man.

1790
02:07:57,859 --> 02:07:58,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get it.

1791
02:07:58,840 --> 02:07:59,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Suck, man.

1792
02:08:01,163 --> 02:08:01,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get it.

1793
02:08:02,124 --> 02:08:03,946
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt like that was a waste of two minutes of show.

1794
02:08:07,728 --> 02:08:09,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to any two minutes of this show.

1795
02:08:37,674 --> 02:08:43,177
[SPEAKER_03]: What they need to do is they need to do a Mega Man game that's very similar to the upcoming Castlevania game.

1796
02:08:43,958 --> 02:08:49,621
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, with like 16 players at the same time fighting Mega Man characters.

1797
02:08:49,901 --> 02:08:55,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Alpha Canandagram says, Sky, imagine possibly Mega Man mixed with LittleBigPlanet with Mega Man powered up level editor.

1798
02:08:55,844 --> 02:08:58,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that sounds awesome, but I don't think that's what this is.

1799
02:08:58,926 --> 02:09:00,787
[SPEAKER_05]: If it is, though, hey, it might be fun.

1800
02:09:01,167 --> 02:09:02,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it might be a lot of fun.

1801
02:09:02,468 --> 02:09:04,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this only supposed to be download, though?

1802
02:09:04,029 --> 02:09:05,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's a live arcade in PlayStation 3?

1803
02:09:05,470 --> 02:09:06,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Live arcade in PlayStation Network.

1804
02:09:06,530 --> 02:09:06,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1805
02:09:07,864 --> 02:09:12,766
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on with some more stories, and this is something about something the Xbox is losing.

1806
02:09:13,166 --> 02:09:14,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft canceled 1 vs. 100.

1807
02:09:15,367 --> 02:09:17,788
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, there's not going to be a third season of 1 vs. 100.

1808
02:09:18,628 --> 02:09:31,573
[SPEAKER_05]: This is confirmed with Microsoft Game Studios General Manager Dave McCarthy, saying, quote, we're very proud of the 1 vs. 100 team and their accomplishments and are excited to apply what we've learned to future programming.

1809
02:09:32,253 --> 02:09:34,254
[SPEAKER_05]: And, yep, it's on the Xbox.com website.

1810
02:09:34,514 --> 02:09:35,535
[SPEAKER_05]: A fond farewell.

1811
02:09:36,056 --> 02:09:36,497
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1812
02:09:36,697 --> 02:09:37,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw, that sucks.

1813
02:09:37,358 --> 02:09:41,863
[SPEAKER_03]: They're gonna have Mega Man foam Mega Busters or whatever at Comic Con.

1814
02:09:41,883 --> 02:09:45,007
[SPEAKER_05]: They're giving away... Do you not even care that 1 vs. 100 is gone?

1815
02:09:45,027 --> 02:09:45,908
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't care.

1816
02:09:45,929 --> 02:09:47,470
[SPEAKER_05]: All you can think about is Mega Man?

1817
02:09:48,412 --> 02:09:48,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Ugh.

1818
02:09:51,148 --> 02:09:55,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Never forget, there was something funny, Xbox Live Primetime, whatever the fuck happened to that.

1819
02:09:55,872 --> 02:09:57,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's my point.

1820
02:09:58,194 --> 02:09:59,455
[SPEAKER_05]: That stuff sounded so exciting.

1821
02:09:59,575 --> 02:10:04,580
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have this service that's going to blow away all the competition, and we're going to cancel it.

1822
02:10:04,700 --> 02:10:10,005
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to make your Xbox Live Gold account more worthwhile than just paying to play against other people.

1823
02:10:11,345 --> 02:10:14,066
[SPEAKER_03]: But it came down to where they couldn't get advertisers.

1824
02:10:14,286 --> 02:10:15,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's the buzz I'm hearing too.

1825
02:10:15,626 --> 02:10:17,666
[SPEAKER_05]: It was always a Sprint commercial.

1826
02:10:17,786 --> 02:10:19,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Once in a while you might see another one, but that was mostly it.

1827
02:10:20,407 --> 02:10:23,227
[SPEAKER_05]: So they just couldn't get the advertisers to give away the prizes.

1828
02:10:23,307 --> 02:10:23,727
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what?

1829
02:10:23,747 --> 02:10:30,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there would be – call me crazy – but I think there would be a lot of people that would still play the game, not even for prizes.

1830
02:10:30,529 --> 02:10:38,310
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean when you went into the non-live rounds, which didn't give away anything but points really and supposedly more of a chance to play in the live rounds –

1831
02:10:38,690 --> 02:10:42,433
[SPEAKER_05]: There would still be like 10-20,000 people on at any time.

1832
02:10:42,633 --> 02:10:45,295
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can't tell me that stuff is that expensive to run.

1833
02:10:45,535 --> 02:10:45,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1834
02:10:46,876 --> 02:10:48,717
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I guess they have a question writing staff or whatever.

1835
02:10:48,737 --> 02:10:49,978
[SPEAKER_03]: And why can't you get advertisers?

1836
02:10:50,018 --> 02:10:51,879
[SPEAKER_03]: I see advertisers for stuff all the time.

1837
02:10:52,220 --> 02:10:54,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, there's different movies that they're promoting on there.

1838
02:10:54,441 --> 02:10:55,862
[SPEAKER_03]: There's different, like, stuff.

1839
02:10:56,523 --> 02:10:57,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's Axe Body Spray?

1840
02:10:57,884 --> 02:10:58,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, fuck, there's that shit all the time.

1841
02:10:58,984 --> 02:10:59,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Just do a crossover.

1842
02:10:59,665 --> 02:11:01,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the Old Spice guy in there.

1843
02:11:02,287 --> 02:11:04,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Old Spice is very up on the new technology stuff.

1844
02:11:04,889 --> 02:11:05,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Get him in there.

1845
02:11:06,656 --> 02:11:08,638
[SPEAKER_03]: That last marketing campaign was brilliant.

1846
02:11:08,838 --> 02:11:09,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Brilliant.

1847
02:11:09,699 --> 02:11:10,059
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it.

1848
02:11:10,079 --> 02:11:10,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Who doesn't love that guy?

1849
02:11:10,760 --> 02:11:12,241
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite thing, I'm on a horse.

1850
02:11:13,382 --> 02:11:14,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you see all the YouTube videos?

1851
02:11:14,483 --> 02:11:15,264
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't see the new ones yet.

1852
02:11:15,304 --> 02:11:16,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you got to see the marriage proposal.

1853
02:11:16,465 --> 02:11:17,086
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the best one.

1854
02:11:18,467 --> 02:11:24,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Monty Boggs in our chat room says, Microsoft always promises cool stuff to live and then never does it when they realize it requires work.

1855
02:11:26,935 --> 02:11:27,276
[SPEAKER_05]: You know...

1856
02:11:29,494 --> 02:11:46,786
[SPEAKER_05]: it's just disappointing because they didn't really announce what is next I think that would soften the blow a little bit if they were like well sadly we're losing 1 vs 100 because of licensing they're going to make it a real show again which by the way is also a rumor that 1 vs 100 is actually coming back to TV because of the success of Xbox weird right?

1857
02:11:48,706 --> 02:11:49,266
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, right?

1858
02:11:49,366 --> 02:11:50,407
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it'll be the same thing.

1859
02:11:50,427 --> 02:11:52,068
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to be Bob Saget and NBC.

1860
02:11:52,389 --> 02:11:53,629
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking like Game Show Network.

1861
02:11:53,970 --> 02:11:56,792
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually, I read blogs about game shows.

1862
02:11:56,812 --> 02:11:57,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Leave me alone.

1863
02:11:57,592 --> 02:12:00,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Rob, that's one of the reasons we love you.

1864
02:12:00,494 --> 02:12:00,714
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1865
02:12:02,575 --> 02:12:03,236
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I don't know.

1866
02:12:03,757 --> 02:12:15,047
[SPEAKER_05]: But if they'd come out and said, okay, we're canceling 100 vs. 100, but we are bringing you, I don't know, The Price is Right, or Family Feud, or hell, Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy, anything.

1867
02:12:15,488 --> 02:12:16,889
[SPEAKER_03]: I can play The Price is Right.

1868
02:12:17,029 --> 02:12:18,551
[SPEAKER_05]: People would be excited about that.

1869
02:12:18,871 --> 02:12:20,773
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't even think you have to give away prizes.

1870
02:12:21,393 --> 02:12:24,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Give away EP and people will still line up.

1871
02:12:24,716 --> 02:12:25,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Give away achievements.

1872
02:12:25,837 --> 02:12:28,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Give away shoutouts on websites, leaderboards.

1873
02:12:28,760 --> 02:12:30,361
[SPEAKER_05]: People will play for EP.

1874
02:12:31,442 --> 02:12:32,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the opportunity now.

1875
02:12:32,823 --> 02:12:37,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Make something very similar to, say, PlayStation Home, and you can have the prizes in your living room.

1876
02:12:37,886 --> 02:12:39,407
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, hey, look at this virtual.

1877
02:12:39,487 --> 02:12:40,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

1878
02:12:40,148 --> 02:12:41,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Why aren't you working for Microsoft?

1879
02:12:41,849 --> 02:12:42,469
[SPEAKER_04]: That's brilliant.

1880
02:12:44,430 --> 02:12:44,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Brilliant.

1881
02:12:45,131 --> 02:12:50,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Win avatar items and themes and cool stuff.

1882
02:12:51,335 --> 02:12:51,975
[SPEAKER_05]: You could do it.

1883
02:12:52,416 --> 02:12:55,878
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to give away a free game or car points.

1884
02:12:56,317 --> 02:12:58,497
[SPEAKER_08]: I want a free game and points and a car.

1885
02:12:59,018 --> 02:13:00,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, you know, that's nice.

1886
02:13:00,818 --> 02:13:05,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe give that away to like the season long winner and it won't cost as much out of the prize budget.

1887
02:13:07,179 --> 02:13:08,380
[SPEAKER_05]: AJ Mix in our chat room.

1888
02:13:08,420 --> 02:13:09,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Double dare featuring Natal.

1889
02:13:10,080 --> 02:13:11,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Why aren't you people working for Microsoft?

1890
02:13:11,740 --> 02:13:12,681
[SPEAKER_05]: These are brilliant ideas.

1891
02:13:12,881 --> 02:13:13,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Brilliant.

1892
02:13:14,941 --> 02:13:15,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Won't happen.

1893
02:13:16,881 --> 02:13:17,202
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1894
02:13:17,262 --> 02:13:17,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a thought.

1895
02:13:17,782 --> 02:13:19,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Make up your own game show.

1896
02:13:22,439 --> 02:13:25,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Get some... Somebody out there has got to be creating these game shows.

1897
02:13:26,403 --> 02:13:27,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Hire him!

1898
02:13:27,704 --> 02:13:28,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Make your own damn game show.

1899
02:13:28,965 --> 02:13:31,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Make a new Xbox Live game show.

1900
02:13:31,087 --> 02:13:32,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd love that idea.

1901
02:13:32,309 --> 02:13:32,969
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

1902
02:13:33,009 --> 02:13:37,934
[SPEAKER_03]: You can maybe even broadcast some stuff on it on MSNBC or something.

1903
02:13:38,014 --> 02:13:39,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Or one of the companies that you own.

1904
02:13:40,596 --> 02:13:42,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking stream it on the internet.

1905
02:13:42,118 --> 02:13:43,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Have like a...

1906
02:13:45,265 --> 02:13:46,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I have something, I don't know.

1907
02:13:46,429 --> 02:13:47,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this, Monty Boggs.

1908
02:13:48,234 --> 02:13:49,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you smarter than a fifth grader?

1909
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Or all the little kids in Halo are the fifth graders?

1910
02:13:54,079 --> 02:13:57,000
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there is a fifth grader game on Xbox Live.

1911
02:13:57,860 --> 02:13:58,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you smarter than a fifth grader?

1912
02:13:59,320 --> 02:14:00,900
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on all the systems, I think.

1913
02:14:01,661 --> 02:14:03,201
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not interactive.

1914
02:14:03,841 --> 02:14:06,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I was really excited about Xbox Primetime.

1915
02:14:06,142 --> 02:14:09,222
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really disappointing that it's just like, well, you know, it didn't work.

1916
02:14:09,282 --> 02:14:09,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

1917
02:14:10,002 --> 02:14:15,964
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really hope they come out and say, yes, we've been working on another project and it's still part of Xbox Primetime.

1918
02:14:16,284 --> 02:14:21,145
[SPEAKER_05]: But it makes me nervous when they come out at E3 and don't say a damn thing about it.

1919
02:14:22,305 --> 02:14:23,566
[SPEAKER_05]: That should have been the sign right there.

1920
02:14:23,706 --> 02:14:24,947
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't say a damn thing about it.

1921
02:14:24,967 --> 02:14:32,533
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't like, oh, you hope you liked 1 vs. 100 or, you know, but now we're going to bring you Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune or something like that.

1922
02:14:33,974 --> 02:14:38,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune games were being shown off on the Wii somewhere else.

1923
02:14:38,998 --> 02:14:42,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, I know there's Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune games coming up this year.

1924
02:14:43,661 --> 02:14:45,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, the Wii's been getting a lot of those game shows.

1925
02:14:45,362 --> 02:14:47,044
[SPEAKER_05]: They have the prices right in Press Your Luck.

1926
02:14:47,344 --> 02:14:48,945
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii's the place for game shows right now.

1927
02:14:50,286 --> 02:14:51,547
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not live and interactive.

1928
02:14:52,125 --> 02:14:53,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, think of the possibilities!

1929
02:14:57,666 --> 02:14:59,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, don't cry.

1930
02:14:59,787 --> 02:15:04,328
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just... It's just... What the fuck are they smoking?

1931
02:15:04,568 --> 02:15:10,889
[SPEAKER_04]: You can buy PlayStation Plus and maybe you'll get to pay somebody else to watch Hulu.

1932
02:15:11,929 --> 02:15:13,950
[SPEAKER_08]: What's it gonna... They don't make any sense.

1933
02:15:14,050 --> 02:15:15,770
[SPEAKER_03]: When are the good ideas gonna stick?

1934
02:15:17,489 --> 02:15:20,351
[SPEAKER_03]: They just couldn't make money off of 1 versus 100.

1935
02:15:21,272 --> 02:15:24,495
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't making enough in advertising to justify it.

1936
02:15:24,735 --> 02:15:29,739
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet they could have charged... Well, they're making the money off Xbox Gold.

1937
02:15:30,119 --> 02:15:32,041
[SPEAKER_05]: They're making the money off Xbox Gold, subscribers.

1938
02:15:33,162 --> 02:15:34,263
[SPEAKER_05]: There's other ways they could do it.

1939
02:15:36,798 --> 02:15:39,420
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe the subscribers were giving them that much money.

1940
02:15:40,541 --> 02:15:41,321
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about selling.

1941
02:15:41,421 --> 02:15:43,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I know people who bought an Xbox just to play that game.

1942
02:15:44,003 --> 02:15:44,864
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got to be pissed.

1943
02:15:45,564 --> 02:15:46,905
[SPEAKER_05]: They make the money back in other ways.

1944
02:15:46,965 --> 02:15:47,786
[SPEAKER_05]: It's dumb.

1945
02:15:48,546 --> 02:15:49,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.

1946
02:15:49,607 --> 02:15:52,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but that's a dumb reason to buy an Xbox too if you ask me.

1947
02:15:53,610 --> 02:15:59,533
[SPEAKER_05]: SalaciousPop in chat says, Rob wants a big brother port for Wii with a throttle that bitch Wii mode mechanic.

1948
02:15:59,933 --> 02:16:05,416
[SPEAKER_05]: I would totally play Survivor on Xbox Live if it was like somehow real.

1949
02:16:05,976 --> 02:16:06,176
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1950
02:16:07,336 --> 02:16:09,117
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a Survivor game coming out on the Wii.

1951
02:16:09,337 --> 02:16:10,578
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna be stupid.

1952
02:16:11,058 --> 02:16:12,659
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not gonna be online or anything.

1953
02:16:12,719 --> 02:16:15,080
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna be like the horrible PC games that were out.

1954
02:16:15,120 --> 02:16:15,980
[SPEAKER_05]: At least the PC games.

1955
02:16:16,241 --> 02:16:18,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one of the PC games you could actually play on the internet.

1956
02:16:19,922 --> 02:16:21,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably is gonna be a port of the PC game.

1957
02:16:22,023 --> 02:16:23,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Dumb, dumb, dumb.

1958
02:16:23,044 --> 02:16:26,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the last PC game came out a long time ago.

1959
02:16:26,465 --> 02:16:28,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that'll probably be a port of the PC game.

1960
02:16:28,626 --> 02:16:29,467
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on.

1961
02:16:31,508 --> 02:16:32,288
[SPEAKER_08]: That's frightening.

1962
02:16:33,309 --> 02:16:35,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1963
02:16:37,431 --> 02:16:39,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there is some stuff.

1964
02:16:41,233 --> 02:16:44,655
[SPEAKER_08]: As soon as my system decides to stop being crappy.

1965
02:16:45,395 --> 02:16:48,837
[SPEAKER_08]: I was also completely enamored with the Wacka Kitty, so...

1966
02:16:50,731 --> 02:16:53,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, SSJ100Matt, for completely derailing the show.

1967
02:16:53,236 --> 02:16:53,937
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate you.

1968
02:16:55,199 --> 02:16:56,081
[SPEAKER_05]: With your cute kittens.

1969
02:16:57,884 --> 02:16:59,367
[SPEAKER_08]: No, because my thing... Okay, there it is.

1970
02:16:59,467 --> 02:16:59,768
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1971
02:16:59,968 --> 02:17:03,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, actually, what was going on was that my window decided to hide itself.

1972
02:17:03,973 --> 02:17:04,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

1973
02:17:05,335 --> 02:17:07,237
[SPEAKER_08]: And my brain is broken.

1974
02:17:07,277 --> 02:17:07,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't work.

1975
02:17:07,998 --> 02:17:14,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, how about some news about poor, poor Nintendo?

1976
02:17:14,886 --> 02:17:16,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we have some sad music, Rob?

1977
02:17:16,928 --> 02:17:17,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Some sad music?

1978
02:17:18,790 --> 02:17:20,032
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't request this in advance.

1979
02:17:20,052 --> 02:17:20,593
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have sad music.

1980
02:17:20,613 --> 02:17:22,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, how about just break out a kazoo?

1981
02:17:22,214 --> 02:17:23,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, hold on.

1982
02:17:28,834 --> 02:17:32,155
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because I feel for them.

1983
02:17:32,255 --> 02:17:32,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Sad music.

1984
02:17:32,855 --> 02:17:33,255
[SPEAKER_05]: You got it.

1985
02:17:33,295 --> 02:17:33,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.

1986
02:17:33,736 --> 02:17:35,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Some sad music for Jamie's story.

1987
02:17:41,298 --> 02:17:53,682
[SPEAKER_08]: There's an announcement made by the Nintendo UK general manager, name is David Yarnton, that demand for the Wii and the DS has declined.

1988
02:17:58,335 --> 02:18:09,618
[SPEAKER_08]: He blamed the falling demand for the Wii and DS on the quote cycle and the recession and saying everybody's in the same boat.

1989
02:18:11,298 --> 02:18:13,439
[SPEAKER_08]: We are not recession proof he says.

1990
02:18:14,839 --> 02:18:18,220
[SPEAKER_08]: We've probably as an industry been better than other industries.

1991
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,761
[SPEAKER_08]: We thought we would be selling more but we're not pretty much.

1992
02:18:25,590 --> 02:18:27,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's really not the case everywhere else in the world so much.

1993
02:18:29,293 --> 02:18:30,694
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's light, Rob.

1994
02:18:30,714 --> 02:18:31,735
[SPEAKER_08]: There's light at the end of the tunnel.

1995
02:18:32,316 --> 02:18:33,677
[SPEAKER_08]: We're waiting on the 3DS.

1996
02:18:35,498 --> 02:18:36,299
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what they're saying.

1997
02:18:45,907 --> 02:18:46,807
[SPEAKER_08]: We had to let that go.

1998
02:18:47,988 --> 02:18:50,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they're waiting on the 3DS because you don't need glasses.

1999
02:18:53,590 --> 02:18:57,972
[SPEAKER_08]: And he also, though, denied that Nintendo has been forced to slash prices.

2000
02:19:02,493 --> 02:19:03,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Alas, Nintendo.

2001
02:19:04,434 --> 02:19:04,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Alas.

2002
02:19:11,796 --> 02:19:12,676
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't help it.

2003
02:19:12,716 --> 02:19:14,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Enough of your drinking ginger ale.

2004
02:19:17,662 --> 02:19:18,022
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

2005
02:19:21,904 --> 02:19:24,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Just your perfect cap to destroy a last Nintendo.

2006
02:19:27,087 --> 02:19:28,248
[SPEAKER_05]: What is wrong with you?

2007
02:19:32,970 --> 02:19:39,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Salacious Pop in our chatroom says, Now I'm imagining Reggie in tears floating on a wooden plank saying, Never let go, Wii.

2008
02:19:39,974 --> 02:19:40,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Never let go.

2009
02:19:43,075 --> 02:19:44,416
[SPEAKER_08]: And then one of his thumbs break off.

2010
02:19:47,947 --> 02:19:52,770
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't give up Keep holding on Cause you know I'll make it through, make it through with you

2011
02:20:17,836 --> 02:20:21,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Just stay strong

2012
02:20:46,175 --> 02:20:47,397
[SPEAKER_03]: The ship sinks again.

2013
02:20:47,457 --> 02:20:49,420
[SPEAKER_03]: You think it sunk and everyone died.

2014
02:20:49,661 --> 02:20:52,225
[SPEAKER_03]: They really went to a magical town under the water.

2015
02:20:52,966 --> 02:20:55,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Where they all lived happily ever after.

2016
02:20:55,310 --> 02:20:57,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Titanic Atlantis.

2017
02:21:06,096 --> 02:21:09,537
[SPEAKER_03]: The Connect Experience Tour coming to your town soon.

2018
02:21:10,037 --> 02:21:23,523
[SPEAKER_03]: They are traveling around the country on the East Coast and on the West Coast showing off a bunch of different Kinect games including Kinectimals, Kinect Sports, Kinect Joyride, Kinect Adventures, and Dance Central.

2019
02:21:23,563 --> 02:21:25,164
[SPEAKER_03]: The only game without Kinect in the title.

2020
02:21:26,025 --> 02:21:32,991
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, they will be doing this, um, very close until launch of the actual Kinect on November 4th.

2021
02:21:33,672 --> 02:21:41,859
[SPEAKER_03]: So, some notable East Coast, uh, locations, let's see, um, actually starting earlier of this, or well...

2022
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:44,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Yesterday and today.

2023
02:21:44,641 --> 02:21:45,481
[SPEAKER_03]: They were at Macy's.

2024
02:21:45,541 --> 02:21:47,741
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably didn't see them because they were at Macy's.

2025
02:21:50,142 --> 02:21:51,402
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Macy's.

2026
02:21:52,022 --> 02:21:54,743
[SPEAKER_03]: If you just happened to go there, then you might have seen it.

2027
02:21:55,623 --> 02:21:56,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other notable places.

2028
02:21:57,784 --> 02:22:02,325
[SPEAKER_03]: August 4th through the 6th, they're going to be in Canton, Ohio at the Football Hall of Fame Rib Burn Off.

2029
02:22:03,885 --> 02:22:04,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well that makes sense.

2030
02:22:05,046 --> 02:22:05,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Football Hall of Fame.

2031
02:22:06,166 --> 02:22:07,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that seems to be a good place to go.

2032
02:22:07,886 --> 02:22:08,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2033
02:22:08,246 --> 02:22:08,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2034
02:22:09,907 --> 02:22:10,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

2035
02:22:11,900 --> 02:22:21,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, October 1st and 2nd, Orlando, Florida, the Disney Wine and Dine Marathon.

2036
02:22:24,622 --> 02:22:26,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Disney has a wine and dine marathon.

2037
02:22:26,143 --> 02:22:28,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like the wine thing they do at California Adventure?

2038
02:22:28,546 --> 02:22:37,474
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think that's like, remember how Disney in Orlando has a lot of those fancy adult places where you can go taste wine and fancy restaurants and shit like that?

2039
02:22:37,554 --> 02:22:37,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2040
02:22:38,035 --> 02:22:38,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there.

2041
02:22:39,076 --> 02:22:45,382
[SPEAKER_03]: And then October 14th and the 17th, or through the 17th, you can check out the Texas State Fair.

2042
02:22:46,062 --> 02:22:49,923
[SPEAKER_03]: or October 21st through the 24th at the Louisiana State Fair.

2043
02:22:50,723 --> 02:22:53,784
[SPEAKER_03]: What other state fairs are they going to be hitting up as well?

2044
02:22:53,824 --> 02:23:00,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Minnesota State Fair, Tennessee State Fair, I know the California State Fair.

2045
02:23:00,766 --> 02:23:02,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, really?

2046
02:23:02,086 --> 02:23:05,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm like, the California State Fair is going on right now here in lovely Sacramento.

2047
02:23:05,767 --> 02:23:06,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they going to be there, really?

2048
02:23:06,788 --> 02:23:10,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, July 28th through August 1st at the California State Fair.

2049
02:23:10,569 --> 02:23:11,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost worth going there.

2050
02:23:12,129 --> 02:23:12,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost.

2051
02:23:13,630 --> 02:23:17,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost worth going and getting subjected to getting shot by a gang.

2052
02:23:18,013 --> 02:23:18,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost.

2053
02:23:20,794 --> 02:23:23,896
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two things you can count on at the California State Fair.

2054
02:23:24,316 --> 02:23:27,138
[SPEAKER_05]: The smell of animal poop and gang shootings.

2055
02:23:28,018 --> 02:23:28,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Every year.

2056
02:23:29,159 --> 02:23:33,240
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this is a surprise to me, but I never knew that Minnesota was on the West Coast.

2057
02:23:33,360 --> 02:23:37,741
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently they're going to be at the Mall of America from July 15th to August 22nd.

2058
02:23:38,161 --> 02:23:39,901
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a pretty long-ass time there.

2059
02:23:39,961 --> 02:23:41,781
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mall of America, that's your place to go.

2060
02:23:42,221 --> 02:23:45,022
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd think they'd have the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America.

2061
02:23:45,322 --> 02:23:46,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

2062
02:23:47,102 --> 02:23:47,802
[SPEAKER_03]: What other state fairs?

2063
02:23:47,822 --> 02:23:51,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado State Fair, Utah State Fair, New Mexico State Fair.

2064
02:23:52,823 --> 02:23:56,484
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be at the Universal City Walk on September 24th through the 26th.

2065
02:23:58,544 --> 02:24:02,107
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, October 7th through the 11th, San Francisco at Fleet Week.

2066
02:24:05,629 --> 02:24:06,450
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um...

2067
02:24:08,618 --> 02:24:09,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the Arizona State Fair.

2068
02:24:10,279 --> 02:24:11,400
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yes, a bunch of different dates.

2069
02:24:11,500 --> 02:24:12,381
[SPEAKER_03]: They have it, actually.

2070
02:24:12,841 --> 02:24:20,186
[SPEAKER_03]: You can check it out on Facebook, facebook.com slash connect, or the Gamerscore blog.

2071
02:24:20,647 --> 02:24:25,851
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got the dates posted there as well, or a lot of the gaming sites do, in case you're interested in checking it out.

2072
02:24:26,731 --> 02:24:32,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I might be interested in checking out the State Fair, but my God, it's a State Fair, and I have to go there, and it's hot outside.

2073
02:24:32,996 --> 02:24:33,616
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hot.

2074
02:24:34,097 --> 02:24:34,377
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so hot.

2075
02:24:34,397 --> 02:24:34,497
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

2076
02:24:34,537 --> 02:24:35,097
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hot.

2077
02:24:35,177 --> 02:24:35,738
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hot.

2078
02:24:36,900 --> 02:24:38,504
[SPEAKER_05]: And seriously, the safer sucks.

2079
02:24:38,945 --> 02:24:44,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Salacious Pop in chat is asking me, can we go this weekend and get deep fried foods and ride on Spinner Hurl rides?

2080
02:24:44,296 --> 02:24:46,701
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, honestly, my first reaction is like, no.

2081
02:24:49,185 --> 02:24:50,106
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we can't.

2082
02:24:50,586 --> 02:24:51,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2083
02:24:51,447 --> 02:24:53,308
[SPEAKER_05]: The State Fair is okay.

2084
02:24:53,348 --> 02:25:00,373
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be neat to check out, but honestly, Dance Central will be the only game I might be kind of interested in checking out.

2085
02:25:01,313 --> 02:25:01,834
[SPEAKER_05]: How would you go?

2086
02:25:01,894 --> 02:25:04,636
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no way in hell you're going to be able to take the wife to the State Fair.

2087
02:25:04,676 --> 02:25:05,416
[SPEAKER_05]: It's way too hot out.

2088
02:25:05,476 --> 02:25:07,257
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just convinced the coworkers to go.

2089
02:25:07,878 --> 02:25:08,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I'd go myself.

2090
02:25:08,758 --> 02:25:10,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go with you, I guess.

2091
02:25:10,840 --> 02:25:11,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going, dude.

2092
02:25:11,800 --> 02:25:12,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let me put it this way.

2093
02:25:13,181 --> 02:25:14,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just break this down here.

2094
02:25:14,662 --> 02:25:16,022
[SPEAKER_03]: July 28th through August 1st.

2095
02:25:16,242 --> 02:25:20,744
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a good percentage chance that the baby will be here by then.

2096
02:25:21,384 --> 02:25:22,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I will not be going anywhere.

2097
02:25:22,364 --> 02:25:24,445
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to be too busy changing poopy diapers.

2098
02:25:24,505 --> 02:25:28,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, save a Vicodin and then take it and we'll go.

2099
02:25:29,687 --> 02:25:30,847
[SPEAKER_08]: If you pay for me to get in, I'll go.

2100
02:25:32,372 --> 02:25:33,853
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2101
02:26:02,689 --> 02:26:07,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that's, it's, it's a week from next, week from this upcoming weekend.

2102
02:26:08,276 --> 02:26:09,717
[SPEAKER_03]: So August 1st is what, a Sunday?

2103
02:26:09,997 --> 02:26:12,560
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be, uh, yeah, Sunday.

2104
02:26:12,861 --> 02:26:13,481
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a show then.

2105
02:26:13,521 --> 02:26:18,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's the 28th though, that's like... A show live from the State Fair, is it possible?

2106
02:26:19,768 --> 02:26:20,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

2107
02:26:20,089 --> 02:26:20,329
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2108
02:26:20,810 --> 02:26:21,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it is.

2109
02:26:21,450 --> 02:26:23,773
[SPEAKER_08]: We can just record, bring the, I found the little recorder.

2110
02:26:25,144 --> 02:26:25,984
[SPEAKER_05]: It's State Fair.

2111
02:26:26,024 --> 02:26:27,925
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hot.

2112
02:26:27,945 --> 02:26:31,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, there's a lot of things that I would call off a show for.

2113
02:26:31,906 --> 02:26:33,847
[SPEAKER_05]: I've called off a show to go to Disneyland.

2114
02:26:34,267 --> 02:26:36,668
[SPEAKER_05]: I've called off a show to go to various expos.

2115
02:26:37,048 --> 02:26:39,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I would not call off a show to go to the freaking State Fair.

2116
02:26:42,330 --> 02:26:43,490
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just too tacky.

2117
02:26:43,751 --> 02:26:46,812
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gone to... What was it?

2118
02:26:46,952 --> 02:26:47,512
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a...

2119
02:26:49,867 --> 02:26:51,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember what the fair was.

2120
02:26:51,167 --> 02:27:01,510
[SPEAKER_03]: It was some sort of rib cook-off and country music fair thing that was down by Rayleigh Field to see Rock Band 2.

2121
02:27:02,350 --> 02:27:03,450
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did that one time.

2122
02:27:03,530 --> 02:27:05,831
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw Rock Band at the state fair, actually, a couple years ago.

2123
02:27:06,311 --> 02:27:07,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2124
02:27:08,191 --> 02:27:12,472
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the same night that I broke up with that asshole.

2125
02:27:12,872 --> 02:27:14,033
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the same night.

2126
02:27:15,013 --> 02:27:15,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

2127
02:27:18,737 --> 02:27:19,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, this show took a tumble.

2128
02:27:22,522 --> 02:27:23,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's sad trombone?

2129
02:27:25,325 --> 02:27:32,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, next story, something a lot happier than horrible experiences at the State Fair.

2130
02:27:33,339 --> 02:27:34,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2131
02:27:55,157 --> 02:27:56,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

2132
02:28:15,983 --> 02:28:20,146
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's actually about the original character's grandkids going back to the haunted house.

2133
02:28:20,626 --> 02:28:22,667
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's basically kind of a very similar plot.

2134
02:28:22,767 --> 02:28:25,969
[SPEAKER_05]: And I gotta admit, looking at the graphics, it looks very kid-ish.

2135
02:28:26,609 --> 02:28:33,133
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess it's kind of cool that they're bringing out the old games and making, you know, kind of new ones.

2136
02:28:33,633 --> 02:28:37,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope there's some other old-ass Atari games that they'd maybe do this to.

2137
02:28:38,275 --> 02:28:38,796
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

2138
02:28:38,816 --> 02:28:43,498
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is one of those games you might fire up once and go, oh, that's cute, and then probably never play again.

2139
02:28:43,518 --> 02:28:44,018
[SPEAKER_05]: They're actually...

2140
02:28:45,319 --> 02:28:46,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there other ones they're talking about?

2141
02:28:46,820 --> 02:28:48,061
[SPEAKER_05]: There's supposed to be other ones.

2142
02:28:48,242 --> 02:28:51,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I had heard something about that there were other games they were thinking about.

2143
02:28:51,204 --> 02:28:52,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Centipede.

2144
02:28:53,106 --> 02:28:53,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

2145
02:28:53,586 --> 02:28:55,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I saw a game for Centipede.

2146
02:28:55,047 --> 02:28:55,988
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, really?

2147
02:28:56,368 --> 02:28:57,950
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell are they going to do with Centipede?

2148
02:28:57,970 --> 02:28:59,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is not Frogger.

2149
02:29:00,072 --> 02:29:00,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Human Centipede?

2150
02:29:01,353 --> 02:29:02,954
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not Human Centipede.

2151
02:29:04,535 --> 02:29:05,556
[SPEAKER_03]: There was another one, too.

2152
02:29:05,616 --> 02:29:06,317
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember what it was.

2153
02:29:07,678 --> 02:29:08,799
[SPEAKER_03]: But Centipede was one of the games.

2154
02:29:10,933 --> 02:29:14,418
[SPEAKER_03]: It was also leaked out on Gamefly.

2155
02:29:15,159 --> 02:29:17,543
[SPEAKER_03]: They had it because everyone trusts Gamefly over me.

2156
02:29:19,946 --> 02:29:20,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Sad days.

2157
02:29:21,709 --> 02:29:22,350
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2158
02:29:22,410 --> 02:29:26,356
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need to move on with our show and get into the mailbag.

2159
02:29:31,676 --> 02:29:36,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week you guys send us emails and we read them here on the program to our much amusement.

2160
02:29:37,738 --> 02:29:42,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com and we're going to answer your questions that you've emailed us.

2161
02:29:42,619 --> 02:29:46,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com or sometimes you guys share funny stories and things of that sort.

2162
02:29:46,761 --> 02:29:48,121
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's get to it.

2163
02:29:48,181 --> 02:29:49,481
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura is going to read some emails.

2164
02:29:50,522 --> 02:29:54,043
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got three to go through and I'm going to start with the shortest of them first.

2165
02:29:55,623 --> 02:29:57,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, kind of the second shortest, but the other one's got some stuff.

2166
02:29:58,240 --> 02:29:58,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, OLR!

2167
02:29:59,140 --> 02:30:01,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Plissken here to ask a few questions.

2168
02:30:02,142 --> 02:30:06,124
[SPEAKER_08]: First, if you could be in any video game, which would it be and why?

2169
02:30:07,585 --> 02:30:13,087
[SPEAKER_08]: If I had to, I'd be in Sims 3 so that I could have an infinity code so that I'd never get hungry.

2170
02:30:14,188 --> 02:30:15,309
[SPEAKER_08]: I could never age.

2171
02:30:15,669 --> 02:30:15,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Never.

2172
02:30:17,750 --> 02:30:22,192
[SPEAKER_08]: And I could decide how hot the person I want to look like and everything.

2173
02:30:23,024 --> 02:30:30,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be in Animal Crossing so I could get rewarded with refrigerators and dressers and radios for running people's mail to the post office.

2174
02:30:31,614 --> 02:30:31,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

2175
02:30:38,682 --> 02:30:39,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2176
02:30:40,560 --> 02:30:41,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't really want to be in any game.

2177
02:30:42,501 --> 02:30:43,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Mega Man Universe.

2178
02:30:43,962 --> 02:30:44,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that looks retarded.

2179
02:30:45,923 --> 02:30:46,303
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2180
02:30:46,323 --> 02:30:47,003
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a good answer.

2181
02:30:47,344 --> 02:30:48,364
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd also want to be in... I know!

2182
02:30:48,424 --> 02:30:49,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Totem Ball!

2183
02:30:49,205 --> 02:30:51,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it is such an awesome game!

2184
02:30:51,886 --> 02:30:53,307
[SPEAKER_05]: But you were in Totem Ball!

2185
02:30:53,487 --> 02:30:54,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god!

2186
02:30:54,507 --> 02:30:55,928
[SPEAKER_05]: My bone!

2187
02:30:58,930 --> 02:31:00,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Second, I know you guys... Wait, wait, wait.

2188
02:31:00,811 --> 02:31:01,871
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd also want to be in Pokemon.

2189
02:31:02,572 --> 02:31:03,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying.

2190
02:31:03,652 --> 02:31:03,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2191
02:31:04,152 --> 02:31:04,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Squirtle.

2192
02:31:04,613 --> 02:31:04,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Squirtle.

2193
02:31:06,505 --> 02:31:15,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Second, I know you guys bash on Facebook Gaming, but believe it or not, there are some fun games on Facebook like My Hero's Ability and thousands of poker games.

2194
02:31:15,310 --> 02:31:16,490
[SPEAKER_08]: So my question is, what gives?

2195
02:31:16,950 --> 02:31:19,512
[SPEAKER_08]: As in, maybe you're into those games, but I don't think we are.

2196
02:31:20,783 --> 02:31:21,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't hate all Facebook games.

2197
02:31:22,024 --> 02:31:23,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, you admitted to playing one.

2198
02:31:23,504 --> 02:31:25,785
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Farmville for like a week, okay?

2199
02:31:26,085 --> 02:31:27,005
[SPEAKER_05]: A moment of weakness.

2200
02:31:27,305 --> 02:31:27,966
[SPEAKER_05]: It was dumb.

2201
02:31:28,626 --> 02:31:29,566
[SPEAKER_05]: I was young and naive.

2202
02:31:29,806 --> 02:31:31,407
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I played Bejeweled Blitz once.

2203
02:31:31,427 --> 02:31:32,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Bejeweled Blitz is cool.

2204
02:31:33,167 --> 02:31:35,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't hate on Facebook games a lot.

2205
02:31:35,708 --> 02:31:40,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think the whole social networking gaming thing is kind of retarded.

2206
02:31:40,750 --> 02:31:41,570
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of stupid.

2207
02:31:41,610 --> 02:31:45,452
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like an old man saying, Oh, get your fancy electronic shit!

2208
02:31:45,812 --> 02:31:48,473
[SPEAKER_03]: But, no, it's really, I don't understand what the point is.

2209
02:31:48,533 --> 02:31:48,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, hey,

2210
02:31:49,053 --> 02:31:51,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, look, you know, hey, I sent you a unicorn.

2211
02:31:51,094 --> 02:31:51,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Send me something.

2212
02:31:52,135 --> 02:31:55,236
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate it when people send me shit in Facebook.

2213
02:31:55,436 --> 02:31:56,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I delete it.

2214
02:31:56,417 --> 02:31:58,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not forward anything.

2215
02:31:58,398 --> 02:31:59,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's it.

2216
02:31:59,678 --> 02:32:01,980
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not Facebook games we hate.

2217
02:32:02,120 --> 02:32:04,881
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Facebook games spam that we hate.

2218
02:32:05,521 --> 02:32:06,782
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all for free games.

2219
02:32:07,682 --> 02:32:08,743
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't like the spam.

2220
02:32:09,623 --> 02:32:10,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's annoying.

2221
02:32:12,085 --> 02:32:17,868
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like those, seriously, those chain mails where it's like, oh, send it to five of your friends and lucky things will happen to you.

2222
02:32:18,528 --> 02:32:18,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2223
02:32:19,406 --> 02:32:19,968
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't hate that.

2224
02:32:21,152 --> 02:32:25,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a point, but I totally forgot it was in arguing about how Facebook games are.

2225
02:32:28,584 --> 02:32:29,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what was it?

2226
02:32:29,324 --> 02:32:32,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, My Hero's Ability, or whatever.

2227
02:32:32,466 --> 02:32:38,469
[SPEAKER_03]: That reminds me of that Stephen Lynch song, Superhero, where he starts naming off superheroes.

2228
02:32:38,549 --> 02:32:39,569
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of sounds like Pokemon.

2229
02:32:40,670 --> 02:32:46,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Monty Boggs, by the way, is also answering that question about what video game would you want to be in in our chat room at chat.orange.radio.com.

2230
02:32:46,712 --> 02:32:49,334
[SPEAKER_05]: I would want to be in Deal or No Deal, Constant Money.

2231
02:32:50,894 --> 02:32:52,355
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a deal or no deal Facebook game.

2232
02:32:53,475 --> 02:32:55,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the most pointless freaking game in the entire world.

2233
02:32:56,056 --> 02:32:57,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're all relatively pointless.

2234
02:32:57,957 --> 02:32:58,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess the number.

2235
02:32:59,097 --> 02:33:00,738
[SPEAKER_05]: But like deal or no deal especially.

2236
02:33:01,218 --> 02:33:02,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess the number.

2237
02:33:02,338 --> 02:33:02,938
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it is.

2238
02:33:03,078 --> 02:33:04,439
[SPEAKER_08]: But Rob, it's Howie Mandel.

2239
02:33:04,579 --> 02:33:05,579
[SPEAKER_08]: How can you go wrong there?

2240
02:33:07,200 --> 02:33:07,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me started.

2241
02:33:08,260 --> 02:33:08,840
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Howie.

2242
02:33:09,081 --> 02:33:09,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there more to the email?

2243
02:33:11,701 --> 02:33:12,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, there is.

2244
02:33:13,962 --> 02:33:15,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Stupid, stupid Facebook.

2245
02:33:16,283 --> 02:33:18,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I am looking forward very much to the Civilization game on Facebook.

2246
02:33:20,183 --> 02:33:21,024
[SPEAKER_08]: I am.

2247
02:33:21,625 --> 02:33:22,205
[SPEAKER_08]: And how.

2248
02:33:22,345 --> 02:33:22,746
[SPEAKER_05]: And how.

2249
02:33:22,786 --> 02:33:25,129
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't wait to sieve whore it up with my friends on Facebook.

2250
02:33:25,169 --> 02:33:25,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

2251
02:33:26,090 --> 02:33:26,571
[SPEAKER_08]: More!

2252
02:33:27,492 --> 02:33:28,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Third is for Loki.

2253
02:33:29,454 --> 02:33:35,482
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I'm trying really not to be so grammar crazy and... But... Sucks.

2254
02:33:36,323 --> 02:33:44,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Third is for Loki, I've owned a PSP-1000 for almost a year, and now all of a sudden the D-pad is freaking out.

2255
02:33:44,829 --> 02:33:51,314
[SPEAKER_08]: All I want to do is go right dot dot dot, I'm using ellipse okay, all by itself.

2256
02:33:51,534 --> 02:33:59,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Now this wouldn't bother me, but it gives me vertigo when playing Dissidia Final Fantasy, because the D-pad controls the camera.

2257
02:34:00,080 --> 02:34:04,343
[SPEAKER_08]: My question is, can this be fixed, or do I have to shell out money to be a new one?

2258
02:34:05,304 --> 02:34:06,087
[SPEAKER_08]: To be anyone.

2259
02:34:07,010 --> 02:34:08,215
[SPEAKER_08]: You wanna be a D-pad when you grow up.

2260
02:34:08,235 --> 02:34:10,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we know what video game he wants to be in.

2261
02:34:11,794 --> 02:34:18,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it can't be fixed because the D-pad is actually on what they call a ribbon bus cable, which you cannot solder to, unfortunately.

2262
02:34:18,877 --> 02:34:20,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I've tried, and it breaks it.

2263
02:34:22,199 --> 02:34:26,241
[SPEAKER_03]: All you have to do is buy the replacement ribbon bus cable, assuming that that's what's wrong with it.

2264
02:34:26,841 --> 02:34:31,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably there's a kink or something where something broke, and so now it's just being held down.

2265
02:34:31,903 --> 02:34:32,563
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be dirty.

2266
02:34:32,923 --> 02:34:33,524
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know.

2267
02:34:34,424 --> 02:34:36,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, you just have to bust the system open.

2268
02:34:37,445 --> 02:35:05,923
[SPEAKER_03]: and possibly replace that which those aren't that expensive you can probably get a set of ribbon bus cables for I think I bought one for $10 to $20 maybe it should be really cheap probably under $15 so that's all you need to do you just slide it in there and put it all back together and it should work no guarantees though because I don't know if that's exactly what's wrong it could also be there could be some sort of bridging going on somewhere else in there

2269
02:35:06,703 --> 02:35:11,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's hard to say until you bust it open and see what actually is broken in there.

2270
02:35:11,285 --> 02:35:20,169
[SPEAKER_03]: But, if it's the actual D-pad sticking, like the controller button is actually sticking down, it's probably dirty and you just need to clean it out.

2271
02:35:20,469 --> 02:35:26,512
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen some friends with PSPs that I've fixed for them that are fucking disgusting.

2272
02:35:26,652 --> 02:35:28,993
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just the amount of dirt and grime that's on it.

2273
02:35:29,073 --> 02:35:30,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, like, what do you do?

2274
02:35:30,634 --> 02:35:33,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you, like, seriously sweat grease?

2275
02:35:33,495 --> 02:35:34,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, or sweat, like...

2276
02:35:36,053 --> 02:35:37,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Axel Grease or something.

2277
02:35:37,174 --> 02:35:39,275
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous the amount of dirt that's on there.

2278
02:35:39,815 --> 02:35:42,777
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, cleaning your PSP, try that first.

2279
02:35:43,037 --> 02:35:46,279
[SPEAKER_03]: If that still doesn't work, then you may need to replace that ribbon bus cable.

2280
02:35:46,559 --> 02:35:48,821
[SPEAKER_03]: If that doesn't work, you're probably going to need a PSP.

2281
02:35:50,461 --> 02:35:52,623
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of agree with Legend of Zaku in our chat room.

2282
02:35:52,683 --> 02:35:54,544
[SPEAKER_05]: PSP's D-pad in general is ass.

2283
02:35:56,547 --> 02:36:02,294
[SPEAKER_03]: They're better than the Xbox 360 D-pad.

2284
02:36:02,474 --> 02:36:02,975
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for sure.

2285
02:36:05,237 --> 02:36:08,061
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are being mean to the poor Xbox.

2286
02:36:09,162 --> 02:36:10,524
[SPEAKER_05]: What else is new tonight?

2287
02:36:11,004 --> 02:36:12,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that it for that email or is there more?

2288
02:36:12,985 --> 02:36:14,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Final question is for Rob.

2289
02:36:14,766 --> 02:36:17,247
[SPEAKER_08]: How would I go about coming out to my family?

2290
02:36:18,807 --> 02:36:19,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

2291
02:36:21,228 --> 02:36:21,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

2292
02:36:22,388 --> 02:36:23,729
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a bit of a tangent.

2293
02:36:25,870 --> 02:36:26,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2294
02:36:26,310 --> 02:36:28,070
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a big fan of skywriting.

2295
02:36:28,530 --> 02:36:29,731
[SPEAKER_08]: I can offer a resource.

2296
02:36:30,331 --> 02:36:30,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, please.

2297
02:36:31,952 --> 02:36:38,337
[SPEAKER_08]: The Human Rights, what's the name of their equality thing?

2298
02:36:38,417 --> 02:36:41,259
[SPEAKER_08]: They've got the store in San Francisco.

2299
02:36:41,339 --> 02:36:42,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Human Rights Campaign.

2300
02:36:42,219 --> 02:36:42,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2301
02:36:42,820 --> 02:36:53,967
[SPEAKER_08]: The Human Rights Campaign has actually brochures and free material up on their website if you do want to actually have something in writing by a psychologist and stuff.

2302
02:36:54,008 --> 02:36:55,749
[SPEAKER_08]: So they do have resources there.

2303
02:36:57,110 --> 02:36:57,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, okay.

2304
02:36:57,690 --> 02:37:00,493
[SPEAKER_05]: How do I tackle this question without taking 30 minutes?

2305
02:37:00,913 --> 02:37:01,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, okay.

2306
02:37:02,735 --> 02:37:07,219
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, if you need additional advice, send me a personal email, robatorangeontrager.com.

2307
02:37:07,499 --> 02:37:08,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll address this off the air.

2308
02:37:09,221 --> 02:37:11,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, cause I really don't know anything about this listener.

2309
02:37:11,243 --> 02:37:12,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how old you are.

2310
02:37:12,244 --> 02:37:15,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what you're like, if you have a hostile family situation or what's going on.

2311
02:37:16,267 --> 02:37:19,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I think different situations necessitate different responses.

2312
02:37:19,851 --> 02:37:19,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

2313
02:37:21,451 --> 02:37:48,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there's a lot of push out there that say like you know come out come out wherever you are and all this stuff but I completely understand that sometimes that is not necessarily the answer at the end of the day who you have in your bedroom is your business and I understand your desire to tell your family that and I think you know if you have that type of family you should tell them that that's going to be supportive and loving but there are sometimes some some sticky situations so I don't know your family background or what have you my advice is

2314
02:37:50,222 --> 02:37:53,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell Your Best Friend Tell Your Best Friend

2315
02:38:05,100 --> 02:38:05,420
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

2316
02:38:34,987 --> 02:38:36,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, good job

2317
02:39:02,941 --> 02:39:03,382
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope.

2318
02:39:04,463 --> 02:39:05,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?

2319
02:39:05,183 --> 02:39:06,385
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a challenging question.

2320
02:39:06,425 --> 02:39:08,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't been asked that in the eight years of doing this.

2321
02:39:08,427 --> 02:39:08,867
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think.

2322
02:39:09,268 --> 02:39:25,184
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been told by people, you know, which is always a wonderful compliment and just an astonishing feeling, you know, like, thank you for being, you know, out on the radio and just, you know, being a guy who likes games who happens to be gay, but I don't think I've had that question.

2323
02:39:26,772 --> 02:39:34,683
[SPEAKER_05]: but thank you for asking because I think it takes a lot of guts to even type that out so please email me if you need it

2324
02:39:36,659 --> 02:39:38,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, this one's from Robaba.

2325
02:39:39,740 --> 02:39:46,161
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, this is particularly for Jamie, and he sends me a link from doitmyself.org of a TARDIS cake.

2326
02:39:46,901 --> 02:39:50,762
[SPEAKER_08]: But it lights up and it's got the inside of the TARDIS through the window.

2327
02:39:51,922 --> 02:39:52,582
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's a cake.

2328
02:39:53,762 --> 02:39:54,542
[SPEAKER_08]: That is awesome.

2329
02:39:55,662 --> 02:39:59,963
[SPEAKER_08]: And he concludes his email with, it's probably too involved for most, but it is cool.

2330
02:40:00,003 --> 02:40:04,064
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to share the link with our chatters real quick.

2331
02:40:06,835 --> 02:40:08,397
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the TARDIS made of cake.

2332
02:40:08,577 --> 02:40:09,157
[SPEAKER_05]: I would eat that.

2333
02:40:10,038 --> 02:40:10,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Delicious.

2334
02:40:11,039 --> 02:40:15,744
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'd just make a cake in the shape of a TARDIS, but I can't bake for crap.

2335
02:40:16,485 --> 02:40:18,146
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't even make pancakes right, Rob.

2336
02:40:19,928 --> 02:40:20,508
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awful.

2337
02:40:21,750 --> 02:40:22,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, last email.

2338
02:40:25,464 --> 02:40:26,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Greetings, OLR.

2339
02:40:26,725 --> 02:40:27,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Rini here.

2340
02:40:28,046 --> 02:40:34,531
[SPEAKER_08]: A few episodes ago, you mentioned having a contingency plan for when Loki needs to care for his newborn bundle of joy.

2341
02:40:35,092 --> 02:40:40,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Although there's always the amusing chance that he may never be gone, I still would like to suggest a host.

2342
02:40:41,016 --> 02:40:42,277
[SPEAKER_08]: A guest host, Scott Rubin.

2343
02:40:42,817 --> 02:40:51,603
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just listening to the guy and I think he'd be doing OLR and his All Games fans a favor by chiming in once with his thoughts on games and gaming news today.

2344
02:40:52,203 --> 02:41:00,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, he would make this show run seven hours long and prompt everyone to call in sick due to copious but responsible amounts of drinking, perverted discussions, and not giving a fuck in general.

2345
02:41:02,490 --> 02:41:12,043
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I approve of that and since DarkSakura and Sky recently purchased Team Fortress 2 I'd like to make a few suggestions on classes since Sky isn't so hot with the aiming 1.

2346
02:41:13,525 --> 02:41:14,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Learn the maps with Medic

2347
02:41:15,785 --> 02:41:19,067
[SPEAKER_08]: You can learn where items and paths are while helping your teammates.

2348
02:41:19,227 --> 02:41:28,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Overheal everyone, but focus on assisting those taking fire, and especially do not be afraid to turn around and see what's around you.

2349
02:41:29,172 --> 02:41:34,595
[SPEAKER_08]: If you unlock the Ubersaw, feel free to knife weaker classes to gain power for your Ubercharge.

2350
02:41:35,667 --> 02:41:36,368
[SPEAKER_05]: 2.

2351
02:41:35,747 --> 02:41:36,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Try Pyro.

2352
02:41:36,608 --> 02:41:37,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I say?

2353
02:41:37,169 --> 02:41:40,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I was actually thinking of being a medic because I'm always the white mage in these games.

2354
02:41:40,892 --> 02:41:41,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Always.

2355
02:41:41,833 --> 02:41:42,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2356
02:41:42,774 --> 02:41:42,754
2.

2357
02:41:43,054 --> 02:41:43,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Try Pyro.

2358
02:41:44,195 --> 02:41:52,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Incredibly helpful with this flamethrower because it can air blast to push enemies and rockets grenades or slash grenades while putting out fires on teammates.

2359
02:41:52,542 --> 02:41:57,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Be sneaky and use hit and run tactics to let the afterburn make enemies retreat or at least

2360
02:41:58,827 --> 02:41:59,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold off them a bit.

2361
02:41:59,868 --> 02:42:01,528
[SPEAKER_08]: If they're alone or weak, finish them off.

2362
02:42:01,688 --> 02:42:04,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Always check for spies and never use the back burner.

2363
02:42:04,729 --> 02:42:06,050
[SPEAKER_08]: That's capitalized, never.

2364
02:42:06,630 --> 02:42:08,050
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's capitalized always, by the way.

2365
02:42:08,630 --> 02:42:09,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Three, try Engineer.

2366
02:42:10,351 --> 02:42:18,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Build teleporters and dispensers to help teammates and place sentries where they can cover an important point while being shielded by some part of the level.

2367
02:42:18,514 --> 02:42:22,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Unlock the Wrangler and the Gunslinger to deploy many sentries for offensive play.

2368
02:42:22,715 --> 02:42:25,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't forget hitting buildings with your wrench...

2369
02:42:25,996 --> 02:42:50,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Double their construction speed and all but the mini sentries can be upgraded to level 3 If your buildings get sapped by spies, always kill the spy first and then get rid of the sappers Don't forget that your wrench has a higher chance to deal critical hits than most other melee weapons I was actually going to try to engineer because I found that they have now where you can move your sentries around Your turrets

2370
02:42:51,536 --> 02:42:53,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently everyone's playing Engineer because of it.

2371
02:42:53,578 --> 02:42:53,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2372
02:42:53,758 --> 02:42:54,218
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I hear.

2373
02:42:54,839 --> 02:42:57,481
[SPEAKER_08]: For more information and strategies... Okay, I have to do the voice.

2374
02:42:59,903 --> 02:43:00,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Ready?

2375
02:43:01,144 --> 02:43:05,067
[SPEAKER_08]: For more information and strategies, I direct you to the official TF2 wiki here.

2376
02:43:05,668 --> 02:43:09,571
[SPEAKER_08]: http://wiki.teamfortress.com good luck and don't fail, damn it.

2377
02:43:15,945 --> 02:43:18,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Rini is very excited to have us playing Team Fortress 2.

2378
02:43:18,707 --> 02:43:20,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it on the Twitter as well.

2379
02:43:21,350 --> 02:43:22,431
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually need to revisit it.

2380
02:43:22,471 --> 02:43:23,872
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't really touch it at all this week.

2381
02:43:24,152 --> 02:43:26,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I really haven't been able to do much.

2382
02:43:26,274 --> 02:43:28,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, you got the hand thing going on, though.

2383
02:43:28,576 --> 02:43:30,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we still have to have our game.

2384
02:43:30,157 --> 02:43:30,798
[SPEAKER_05]: We shook on it.

2385
02:43:30,878 --> 02:43:34,021
[SPEAKER_05]: So whenever your hand's better, we're going to get on that.

2386
02:43:34,321 --> 02:43:36,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you like my announcer voice?

2387
02:43:37,384 --> 02:43:37,624
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

2388
02:43:40,003 --> 02:43:44,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I could do my wacky morning DJ voice though, wouldn't that be fun to do an entire episode?

2389
02:43:44,906 --> 02:43:48,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Ha ha ha, I can do the annoying female co-host voice.

2390
02:43:48,959 --> 02:43:50,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe for the next April Fool's show.

2391
02:43:50,799 --> 02:43:52,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the Scott thing, too.

2392
02:43:53,240 --> 02:43:56,341
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of the All Games folks miss hearing him on the radio.

2393
02:43:56,441 --> 02:43:58,161
[SPEAKER_05]: He certainly had a fun show.

2394
02:43:59,001 --> 02:44:00,142
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not on the radio anymore?

2395
02:44:00,482 --> 02:44:03,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, he does the Appaday thing now.

2396
02:44:03,122 --> 02:44:04,643
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing the TV thing.

2397
02:44:05,443 --> 02:44:08,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Him and Diane Mizzota do a show, which is kind of fun, that's online.

2398
02:44:11,144 --> 02:44:12,386
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2399
02:44:27,262 --> 02:44:32,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Having a co-host via Skype anything is gonna suck.

2400
02:44:33,226 --> 02:44:36,728
[SPEAKER_05]: And I realize other shows do it, and they do it really well.

2401
02:44:37,069 --> 02:44:44,353
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have to remember, we've been spoiled over eight years of being in the same room doing this show, and I think it's honestly what makes our show different at the end of the day.

2402
02:44:44,714 --> 02:44:55,781
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will tell you, the most fun I've had doing radio with Scott was when we were in the same room, like the E3 Outpost and the random times we dropped into All Games Interactive and some of those things.

2403
02:44:56,101 --> 02:44:57,042
[SPEAKER_05]: When they had that,

2404
02:44:57,782 --> 02:44:58,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

2405
02:45:17,335 --> 02:45:21,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so again, we don't want to be so quick.

2406
02:45:21,062 --> 02:45:27,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, gosh, Loki, all we can do is sit here and talk about who's going to replace you for one week.

2407
02:45:28,661 --> 02:45:29,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even care.

2408
02:45:29,581 --> 02:45:31,362
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I know.

2409
02:45:31,642 --> 02:45:32,343
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just kind of one of those.

2410
02:45:32,363 --> 02:45:34,424
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just going to see who's available that week.

2411
02:45:34,444 --> 02:45:35,824
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll burn that bridge when we get to it.

2412
02:45:35,844 --> 02:45:40,086
[SPEAKER_05]: If we have to pick someone up off Skype, we will, but we have got lots of great people.

2413
02:45:41,066 --> 02:45:42,787
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure Alan could come back for a show.

2414
02:45:43,167 --> 02:45:44,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Drew, you know, wants to do it.

2415
02:45:44,548 --> 02:45:47,629
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be done through an elaborate ceremony featuring roses.

2416
02:45:47,709 --> 02:45:49,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan could do it.

2417
02:45:49,570 --> 02:45:50,090
[SPEAKER_05]: He's here.

2418
02:45:50,110 --> 02:45:52,511
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because he lives here, Rob.

2419
02:45:52,552 --> 02:45:55,573
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the chatters would love it if Extifer would come back for a night.

2420
02:45:55,973 --> 02:45:56,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Irene.

2421
02:45:57,374 --> 02:45:58,154
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll figure something out.

2422
02:45:58,991 --> 02:45:59,551
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

2423
02:46:01,212 --> 02:46:09,095
[SPEAKER_08]: I really, really, really would like for... And Dan actually was excited about wanting to be on the show tonight, but the family's leaving town.

2424
02:46:10,656 --> 02:46:15,938
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that we need to have Dan be a co-host for a night.

2425
02:46:16,558 --> 02:46:17,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, maybe that'll happen.

2426
02:46:17,759 --> 02:46:18,679
[SPEAKER_08]: I live with the man.

2427
02:46:18,779 --> 02:46:19,880
[SPEAKER_08]: He wouldn't let me live it down.

2428
02:46:21,320 --> 02:46:21,600
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2429
02:46:22,421 --> 02:46:23,421
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I love my husband.

2430
02:46:24,605 --> 02:46:25,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on to the next

2431
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:57,586
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to the absolute and utter pain that my hand is in.

2432
02:46:57,606 --> 02:47:02,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, while I'm healing faster and...

2433
02:47:04,568 --> 02:47:06,689
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got more range of motion.

2434
02:47:06,809 --> 02:47:09,171
[SPEAKER_08]: It actually hurts worse, if that makes sense.

2435
02:47:10,151 --> 02:47:11,332
[SPEAKER_08]: And the little tight stitches.

2436
02:47:11,512 --> 02:47:13,053
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was all for a good thing.

2437
02:47:13,093 --> 02:47:13,753
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very happy.

2438
02:47:14,434 --> 02:47:20,017
[SPEAKER_08]: But F you to just being in pain and being tired all the time from it too.

2439
02:47:20,057 --> 02:47:21,138
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really tired all the time.

2440
02:47:21,878 --> 02:47:22,498
[SPEAKER_08]: And wanting meat.

2441
02:47:22,678 --> 02:47:23,799
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not supposed to be eating meat.

2442
02:47:24,479 --> 02:47:25,620
[SPEAKER_08]: So F you to all that.

2443
02:47:25,720 --> 02:47:28,922
[SPEAKER_08]: And F you to work stuff I've heard about.

2444
02:47:31,437 --> 02:47:37,239
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to Apple for reasons I think I explained either on Bobby's show or at the beginning of this show.

2445
02:47:37,279 --> 02:47:37,919
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even remember now.

2446
02:47:37,939 --> 02:47:38,500
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all a blur.

2447
02:47:39,420 --> 02:47:43,141
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to Stress.

2448
02:47:43,261 --> 02:47:48,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought a car this week, which is actually awesome and I'm happy, but now I've got to get rid of the old car and that takes a lot of work.

2449
02:47:48,803 --> 02:47:50,264
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

2450
02:47:51,164 --> 02:47:51,424
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

2451
02:47:53,624 --> 02:48:03,709
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to one particular person I saw driving on my way to the show today, completely swerving all around the road, and of course she was texting on her cell phone.

2452
02:48:04,529 --> 02:48:06,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, wonderful, reckless person.

2453
02:48:07,670 --> 02:48:11,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops, sorry, F you to the fact I just started playing the credits music on accident.

2454
02:48:14,131 --> 02:48:15,452
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's it.

2455
02:48:15,672 --> 02:48:16,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I punctuate that with something?

2456
02:48:16,953 --> 02:48:17,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

2457
02:48:17,813 --> 02:48:24,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody's text message or phone conversation is as important as Elijah's on the road around you.

2458
02:48:25,117 --> 02:48:25,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Even my mother?

2459
02:48:26,602 --> 02:48:26,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Even.

2460
02:48:27,202 --> 02:48:28,703
[SPEAKER_05]: I think she'd disagree.

2461
02:48:30,584 --> 02:48:36,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, I've told my mother to get off the phone with me if I found out that she was talking to me while she was driving without hands free.

2462
02:48:36,907 --> 02:48:43,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it okay if I'm stuck in traffic because I totally texted you and Bobby today, but I was sitting in stopped traffic and I was watching.

2463
02:48:43,730 --> 02:48:45,151
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's a little bit different.

2464
02:48:45,731 --> 02:48:51,994
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's people who do this crap while they're moving on the road and that's just not right.

2465
02:48:53,635 --> 02:48:55,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not perfect, but

2466
02:48:56,829 --> 02:48:58,089
[SPEAKER_05]: But you want everyone to think you are.

2467
02:48:58,209 --> 02:48:58,470
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

2468
02:48:58,670 --> 02:48:59,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know.

2469
02:48:59,490 --> 02:49:00,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, I take that back.

2470
02:49:00,690 --> 02:49:01,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I am perfect, actually.

2471
02:49:03,071 --> 02:49:03,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

2472
02:49:04,091 --> 02:49:04,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2473
02:49:05,472 --> 02:49:08,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Couple more stories for you guys and then the Skype line.

2474
02:49:08,113 --> 02:49:09,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Brace yourselves.

2475
02:49:09,633 --> 02:49:14,195
[SPEAKER_05]: 877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2476
02:49:14,235 --> 02:49:15,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Couple new stories real quick before we get there, though.

2477
02:49:16,215 --> 02:49:16,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

2478
02:49:17,036 --> 02:49:20,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess Kmart wants me to put reviews up for games.

2479
02:49:20,617 --> 02:49:24,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, wouldn't have known that because I've not been in a Kmart and

2480
02:49:27,076 --> 02:49:27,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Kmart has modernized a little bit.

2481
02:49:27,877 --> 02:49:31,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they are right now somewhere around 93%

2482
02:49:58,430 --> 02:49:58,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so you know.

2483
02:49:59,812 --> 02:50:00,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, you're adorable.

2484
02:50:01,555 --> 02:50:02,517
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to let you know.

2485
02:50:02,817 --> 02:50:04,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

2486
02:50:05,462 --> 02:50:11,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently they are looking for reader reviews or I guess shopper reviews on different titles.

2487
02:50:14,847 --> 02:50:19,449
[SPEAKER_03]: They said one thing, we'd like to feature your reviews on our shelves.

2488
02:50:19,949 --> 02:50:25,391
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, but at this time we will not be sending out free games for you to review.

2489
02:50:25,811 --> 02:50:26,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is kind of funny.

2490
02:50:26,692 --> 02:50:27,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, what?

2491
02:50:27,112 --> 02:50:30,753
[SPEAKER_05]: So like on the shelf they'll have like papers with reviews printed out or something?

2492
02:50:31,033 --> 02:50:31,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

2493
02:50:31,474 --> 02:50:40,737
[SPEAKER_03]: It says Kmart, they're basically looking for reviews to help sell games, I guess.

2494
02:50:40,777 --> 02:50:42,798
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're supposed to help them market games.

2495
02:50:44,264 --> 02:50:44,744
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2496
02:51:04,871 --> 02:51:08,213
[SPEAKER_03]: People are going to make shit up just to get their stuff in the store.

2497
02:51:30,419 --> 02:51:31,180
[SPEAKER_05]: So they do on Steam.

2498
02:51:31,340 --> 02:51:32,602
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see the Medicare score right there.

2499
02:51:32,682 --> 02:51:35,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless it's like under a certain amount, then it's just not there.

2500
02:51:37,535 --> 02:51:38,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand.

2501
02:51:39,636 --> 02:51:40,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Or have it on your website.

2502
02:51:40,896 --> 02:51:44,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Have people review stuff like Amazon or GameStop or whomever.

2503
02:51:45,498 --> 02:51:47,438
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's an interesting idea.

2504
02:51:47,598 --> 02:51:48,578
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a weird one.

2505
02:51:48,658 --> 02:51:49,439
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

2506
02:51:49,739 --> 02:51:59,222
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting that they want to put people's reviews up there and it's, I guess, to encourage a community type thing on the site to get people thinking about Kmart because otherwise you don't.

2507
02:52:00,262 --> 02:52:01,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoa!

2508
02:52:01,662 --> 02:52:02,923
[SPEAKER_03]: My mind's blown here.

2509
02:52:03,303 --> 02:52:05,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently Kmart has blogs.

2510
02:52:06,864 --> 02:52:07,105
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2511
02:52:07,986 --> 02:52:08,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2512
02:52:08,346 --> 02:52:08,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Get out.

2513
02:52:08,867 --> 02:52:12,232
[SPEAKER_05]: MyKmart.com Do they blog about the coffee shops at Kmart?

2514
02:52:12,332 --> 02:52:16,037
[SPEAKER_05]: No, apparently... This Week in the Icy Machine, Blue Raspberry, yum.

2515
02:52:19,842 --> 02:52:20,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's see.

2516
02:52:20,503 --> 02:52:21,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's some wonderful...

2517
02:52:23,334 --> 02:52:27,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's some wonderful blog posts that we have going on here.

2518
02:52:27,675 --> 02:52:30,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these may even be slightly relevant.

2519
02:52:30,976 --> 02:52:31,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Which way do you weed?

2520
02:52:32,196 --> 02:52:36,878
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is talking about either using, I guess, a rake or weed spray.

2521
02:52:38,278 --> 02:52:41,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Kevin Butler versus Old Spice Man.

2522
02:52:41,439 --> 02:52:42,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wins?

2523
02:52:42,899 --> 02:52:44,461
[SPEAKER_03]: for being, I guess, most infamous.

2524
02:52:45,342 --> 02:52:47,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Gamer Chat number one was a success.

2525
02:52:47,924 --> 02:52:50,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks to all... Wait, is this like only gaming stuff on the blog?

2526
02:52:50,567 --> 02:52:53,409
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this is just blogs.mykmart.com.

2527
02:52:53,429 --> 02:52:54,671
[SPEAKER_03]: They have blue light special stuff.

2528
02:52:56,352 --> 02:52:58,394
[SPEAKER_03]: They post blue light specials on the blog?

2529
02:52:58,815 --> 02:52:59,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2530
02:52:59,575 --> 02:53:03,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Attention Twitter, blue light special on Pepperidge Farm Cookies.

2531
02:53:03,339 --> 02:53:04,260
[SPEAKER_04]: 50% off.

2532
02:53:05,962 --> 02:53:26,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Gamer Chat number 1166 says I gotta read this Thanks to all who joined yesterday's Gamer Chat Twitter event We had a spirited discussion about gaming including the best year for video games people's first games and some of this year's surprises both good and bad

2533
02:53:27,566 --> 02:53:33,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, but if you weren't able to catch it yesterday, you can download or you can check out a full transcript.

2534
02:53:33,848 --> 02:53:36,929
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some of the topics that you'd like to discuss in the next gamer chat?

2535
02:53:38,449 --> 02:53:40,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, oh, wait, what's this?

2536
02:53:41,790 --> 02:53:44,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I, they have a gaming blog too.

2537
02:53:45,691 --> 02:53:46,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Kmartgamer.com

2538
02:53:48,809 --> 02:53:50,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a Kmart gamer?

2539
02:53:50,270 --> 02:53:53,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I guess it's blogs.mykmart.com slash games.

2540
02:53:55,495 --> 02:53:58,337
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same fucking blog with video game tags pulled out.

2541
02:53:58,537 --> 02:53:59,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I see what you're doing.

2542
02:54:01,172 --> 02:54:04,994
[SPEAKER_03]: They talk about what's your backlog of games.

2543
02:54:05,374 --> 02:54:08,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, Kmart, you're so current with your blogs and fun stuff like that.

2544
02:54:09,536 --> 02:54:10,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to shop at you now.

2545
02:54:10,977 --> 02:54:15,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Kmart is awesome because most every Kmart I've been to totally ignores street dates.

2546
02:54:16,719 --> 02:54:17,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally ignores them.

2547
02:54:17,720 --> 02:54:21,681
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet if you went into Kmart and go, yeah, I saw it on your blog, they'd be like, huh?

2548
02:54:21,842 --> 02:54:22,402
[SPEAKER_03]: What's a blog?

2549
02:54:22,462 --> 02:54:22,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

2550
02:54:24,763 --> 02:54:25,443
[SPEAKER_03]: On the internet?

2551
02:54:25,463 --> 02:54:26,564
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell's the internet?

2552
02:54:27,984 --> 02:54:28,745
[SPEAKER_05]: That's witchcraft.

2553
02:54:29,622 --> 02:54:48,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I tell you about the time that, like, Target was closed for, like, six months, and Walmart, I just, I wasn't gonna go to Walmart, so I actually went to Kmart to get, like, razor blades, and it was the most, like, challenging, first of all, they have them locked, cause, you know, I guess there's rampant thievery of razor blades across the nation.

2554
02:54:49,896 --> 02:54:57,841
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to track someone down to get a key, and they give it to just, like, the old craggly lady, and

2555
02:54:59,195 --> 02:55:00,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another wonderful topic.

2556
02:55:01,157 --> 02:55:03,660
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of razor blade did you want?

2557
02:55:03,700 --> 02:55:05,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you want the Gillette Mach 5?

2558
02:55:06,243 --> 02:55:09,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Or did you want... I mean, just like, oh my god, I want to die.

2559
02:55:09,467 --> 02:55:14,873
[SPEAKER_03]: From June 23rd, 2010, Fat Guy in a Little Coat, Biggest Loser Special.

2560
02:55:17,335 --> 02:55:18,637
[SPEAKER_03]: You're talking about the Biggest Loser game.

2561
02:55:21,903 --> 02:55:22,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

2562
02:55:22,583 --> 02:55:26,166
[SPEAKER_03]: My life is now complete now that I have discovered Kmart has a blog.

2563
02:55:26,386 --> 02:55:27,667
[SPEAKER_03]: I will read it every day.

2564
02:55:27,967 --> 02:55:28,467
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

2565
02:55:28,507 --> 02:55:29,628
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.

2566
02:55:29,668 --> 02:55:33,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Kmart updates their blog more regularly than any of us post on OrangeSoundsRadio.com.

2567
02:55:33,510 --> 02:55:34,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

2568
02:55:34,110 --> 02:55:34,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't hate it.

2569
02:55:35,191 --> 02:55:36,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want me to post nonsense like this?

2570
02:55:36,912 --> 02:55:38,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be happy to post nonsense like this.

2571
02:55:38,933 --> 02:55:40,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Toe that, I played that game.

2572
02:55:40,514 --> 02:55:41,515
[SPEAKER_03]: It was wonderful.

2573
02:55:41,775 --> 02:55:43,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Go buy it at Kmart.

2574
02:55:47,708 --> 02:55:49,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at me making reference to it.

2575
02:55:49,289 --> 02:55:52,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you please sign up for a Kmart account and start reviewing games?

2576
02:55:52,912 --> 02:56:01,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we should all sign up for Kmart accounts and start reviewing games on there with just like complete nonsensical reviews of things.

2577
02:56:01,999 --> 02:56:04,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know... Like, you know...

2578
02:56:05,842 --> 02:56:06,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

2579
02:56:26,249 --> 02:56:27,030
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, Rob.

2580
02:56:27,230 --> 02:56:30,074
[SPEAKER_08]: My brain started to shut down when you started talking about that.

2581
02:56:30,094 --> 02:56:34,500
[SPEAKER_03]: What you're describing sounds like a lot of effort.

2582
02:56:35,201 --> 02:56:35,822
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to do it.

2583
02:56:35,982 --> 02:56:39,486
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to start a forum thread for awesome Kmart reviews.

2584
02:56:39,667 --> 02:56:43,011
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want all the OL Army to post their awesome Kmart reviews and link them.

2585
02:56:43,251 --> 02:56:45,954
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2586
02:56:58,021 --> 02:56:59,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like us.

2587
02:56:59,402 --> 02:57:10,970
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be talking about your Red Dead Redemption review and then somehow talk about how you like horses and this one time you rode a horse and then it gave you like, you know, crotch rash or something like that and how that was terrible.

2588
02:57:11,150 --> 02:57:15,333
[SPEAKER_03]: But at least the horse's name was like, you know, Biscuit or something.

2589
02:57:15,393 --> 02:57:27,341
[SPEAKER_07]: I was riding my horse Clyde and I skinned a horse in Red Dead Redemption that reminded me of Clyde and one time Clyde kicked me in the shin and it made me pee.

2590
02:57:29,102 --> 02:57:29,582
[SPEAKER_07]: How about that?

2591
02:57:30,983 --> 02:57:31,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Monty Boggs.

2592
02:57:31,703 --> 02:57:32,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, this is great.

2593
02:57:32,484 --> 02:57:34,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Now people are posting their reviews.

2594
02:57:34,285 --> 02:57:34,725
[SPEAKER_05]: This is great.

2595
02:57:35,225 --> 02:57:38,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan Wake makes me want to buy Energizer batteries at Kmart.

2596
02:57:38,567 --> 02:57:39,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Buy Alan Wake at Kmart.

2597
02:57:39,988 --> 02:57:41,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan Wake from GameStop wasn't as good.

2598
02:57:41,849 --> 02:57:42,390
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty good.

2599
02:57:43,650 --> 02:57:45,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Ray Ayanami says, great rail shooter.

2600
02:57:45,992 --> 02:57:53,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Now has anyone been far as decided to use even Go 1 to do look more like... I get it.

2601
02:57:58,317 --> 02:57:59,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, let me try to read it again.

2602
02:57:59,518 --> 02:58:00,118
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

2603
02:58:00,678 --> 02:58:02,979
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an awesome review of Sin of Punishment 2.

2604
02:58:03,980 --> 02:58:04,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Great rail shooter.

2605
02:58:05,060 --> 02:58:09,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Now has anyone really been far as decided to use even Go What To Do look more like?

2606
02:58:13,685 --> 02:58:14,605
[SPEAKER_08]: I love you guys.

2607
02:58:21,008 --> 02:58:22,809
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be on the tag right there.

2608
02:58:28,114 --> 02:58:31,678
[SPEAKER_03]: That about sums up what I think of Kmartner reviewing.

2609
02:58:34,241 --> 02:58:37,264
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been far as decided to use even go what to do more look like?

2610
02:58:37,625 --> 02:58:38,686
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about right.

2611
02:58:40,187 --> 02:58:40,728
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the point.

2612
02:58:40,768 --> 02:58:42,069
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkDead2D is like, I don't get it.

2613
02:58:42,109 --> 02:58:43,471
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the point.

2614
02:58:43,731 --> 02:58:49,357
[SPEAKER_05]: He just threw a bunch of words together that make no sense at all and it's funny and I'm laughing so hard I'm crying.

2615
02:58:49,437 --> 02:58:50,298
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't stop.

2616
02:58:53,696 --> 02:58:57,262
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura is not throwing up over there at the bad grammar.

2617
02:58:58,023 --> 02:59:00,727
[SPEAKER_08]: No, because this is appropriately bad grammar.

2618
02:59:02,110 --> 02:59:03,332
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like little cats.

2619
02:59:04,854 --> 02:59:06,657
[SPEAKER_08]: I do not go around correcting little cats.

2620
02:59:06,837 --> 02:59:08,500
[SPEAKER_08]: I pet them on the head and feed them fish.

2621
02:59:09,713 --> 02:59:14,495
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, one more story for you guys, and then we'll get to the calls.

2622
02:59:14,515 --> 02:59:15,655
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2624
02:59:20,957 --> 02:59:30,060
[SPEAKER_05]: The Brick Theater in Brooklyn, New York is putting on some shows, and they are video game-inspired plays.

2625
02:59:30,760 --> 02:59:31,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's right.

2626
02:59:32,402 --> 02:59:41,449
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Grand Theft Ovid, which takes the Roman poets' Ovid songs and integrates it with Grand Theft Auto.

2627
02:59:42,210 --> 02:59:45,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Modal Combat uses guitar controllers.

2628
02:59:46,713 --> 02:59:48,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even understand this.

2629
02:59:48,275 --> 02:59:49,556
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just like, what?

2630
02:59:50,777 --> 02:59:52,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me look at the official website here.

2631
02:59:52,298 --> 02:59:52,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me look here.

2632
02:59:52,798 --> 02:59:54,460
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to the Brick Theater website here.

2633
02:59:55,241 --> 02:59:56,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

2634
02:59:57,422 --> 03:00:00,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Gameplay at the Brick Is art playable?

2635
03:00:00,324 --> 03:00:01,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Are video games cinematic?

2636
03:00:01,605 --> 03:00:02,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Is Mashima theatrical?

2637
03:00:02,866 --> 03:00:04,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Are smartphones a stage?

2638
03:00:04,387 --> 03:00:06,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there an architecture that connects these diverse media forums?

2639
03:00:07,268 --> 03:00:12,932
[SPEAKER_05]: What boundaries can be broken within and without the walls of an off-off-Broadway theater to change your reviews?

2640
03:00:14,473 --> 03:00:23,739
[SPEAKER_05]: They're having Rock Band Karaoke Night Well, that's not a play Baby Castles, Chiptunes Dance Party Kool-Aid Man and Second Life

2641
03:00:25,578 --> 03:00:29,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Theater of the Arcade, five classic video games adapted for the stage.

2642
03:00:29,680 --> 03:00:35,142
[SPEAKER_05]: In this collection of short plays, the creators of Brick hit suspicious package and create... This is stupid.

2643
03:00:35,982 --> 03:00:36,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what?

2644
03:00:37,423 --> 03:00:38,563
[SPEAKER_05]: This makes no sense.

2645
03:00:40,844 --> 03:00:42,165
[SPEAKER_08]: It gets a Dan quote, Rob.

2646
03:00:42,465 --> 03:00:42,705
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

2647
03:00:43,585 --> 03:00:43,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

2648
03:00:45,726 --> 03:00:46,407
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a Dan line.

2649
03:00:46,587 --> 03:00:47,027
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

2650
03:00:47,047 --> 03:00:50,828
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to write a review of these plays and it's going to say, great rail shooter.

2651
03:00:50,888 --> 03:00:54,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, has anyone really been far as decided to use even Go What To Do look more like?

2652
03:00:57,537 --> 03:01:00,099
[SPEAKER_05]: because that's pretty much my reaction when reading this story.

2653
03:01:00,119 --> 03:01:05,003
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2657
03:01:11,168 --> 03:01:13,270
[SPEAKER_05]: The Skype line is now open.

2658
03:01:14,411 --> 03:01:16,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Frisbee is asking, what game should I review?

2659
03:01:16,693 --> 03:01:18,995
[SPEAKER_05]: You should review Blur.

2660
03:01:20,216 --> 03:01:21,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Frisbee, I'd like you to review the game Blur.

2661
03:01:23,078 --> 03:01:23,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to the phones.

2662
03:01:24,279 --> 03:01:25,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2663
03:01:25,380 --> 03:01:25,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2664
03:01:27,361 --> 03:01:28,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, it's Ray Ayanami.

2665
03:01:28,802 --> 03:01:29,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Ray.

2666
03:01:29,502 --> 03:01:30,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Good to see you yesterday at the show.

2667
03:01:32,224 --> 03:01:33,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, good to see you too.

2668
03:01:33,324 --> 03:01:34,425
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really good to see you.

2669
03:01:35,866 --> 03:01:36,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2670
03:01:36,887 --> 03:01:37,527
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's on your mind?

2671
03:01:40,048 --> 03:01:53,076
[SPEAKER_02]: So for California Extreme, the games I'm looking for were the Don't Bunch Diojo, Ghoul Space Harrier, Red, among other things.

2672
03:01:54,997 --> 03:01:56,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, there was a space harrier there?

2673
03:01:56,498 --> 03:01:57,918
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a space harrier tucked away in the back.

2674
03:01:58,299 --> 03:01:58,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I missed it.

2675
03:01:58,719 --> 03:02:05,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but unfortunately, I don't know, the person who said the machine forgot to put in a pad credit button.

2676
03:02:05,482 --> 03:02:12,805
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for the first, you had to put in a coin and, like, take the coin out of the coin door just to start a game.

2677
03:02:12,885 --> 03:02:16,467
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second day, they closed the coin door, so you had to put in a quarter, which is kind of dumb.

2678
03:02:19,249 --> 03:02:22,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was kind of bothersome when some of those games would run out of credits.

2679
03:02:22,552 --> 03:02:28,877
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I can't hate because they're just arcade collectors, and they're actually doing a favor, putting their machines out there.

2680
03:02:29,238 --> 03:02:31,460
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have to do it, so I try not to bitch.

2681
03:02:31,500 --> 03:02:34,562
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was really frustrating when, like, I wanted to play Tapper, and it was out of credits.

2682
03:02:34,903 --> 03:02:35,663
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, wham.

2683
03:02:38,706 --> 03:02:43,030
[SPEAKER_02]: So, in other news, I've gotten around to playing Death's Mouth and Sin of Postman 2.

2684
03:02:44,109 --> 03:02:46,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, what was your real review of Sin and Punishment 2?

2685
03:02:46,450 --> 03:02:50,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, by the way, that was you I noticed in chat that has now spawned the new OLR quote.

2686
03:02:50,451 --> 03:02:54,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Has anyone really been far as decided to use even Go What To Do Look More Like?

2687
03:02:54,132 --> 03:02:57,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you bring 4chan to this show?

2688
03:03:05,049 --> 03:03:08,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, goddamn you!

2689
03:03:08,410 --> 03:03:10,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, whatever.

2690
03:03:10,571 --> 03:03:12,611
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm just fucking around.

2691
03:03:13,671 --> 03:03:18,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Kids on the internet are funny.

2692
03:03:18,553 --> 03:03:21,874
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty fun.

2693
03:03:22,034 --> 03:03:23,794
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great improvement over the last game.

2694
03:03:24,514 --> 03:03:30,016
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to warn anyone who wants to get that game, even those who have played the original, it's freaking hard.

2695
03:03:32,435 --> 03:03:32,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.

2696
03:03:33,255 --> 03:03:35,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Aren't most of those shooter games pretty hard?

2697
03:03:38,318 --> 03:03:45,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, if these aren't too bad by real shooter standards, it's the bosses that get to me mainly.

2698
03:03:48,704 --> 03:03:54,947
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have to do a few tries to get the patterns down so I don't end up bullshitting through a pattern.

2699
03:03:55,347 --> 03:03:58,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

2700
03:04:01,383 --> 03:04:03,824
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been playing Deathmoth as well for the past two weeks.

2701
03:04:05,325 --> 03:04:05,825
[SPEAKER_05]: And how's that?

2702
03:04:09,046 --> 03:04:15,629
[SPEAKER_02]: So Deathmoth, for those who have not heard of it, it's a side-scrolling shooter by Cave with gothic loli elements.

2703
03:04:16,449 --> 03:04:16,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

2704
03:04:16,789 --> 03:04:20,531
[SPEAKER_02]: And that aside, I especially like this game.

2705
03:04:20,611 --> 03:04:27,293
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the fact that you can fire in both directions, which is a luxury that most side-scrollers tend to lack.

2706
03:04:27,334 --> 03:04:30,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you're stuck firing to the right, which is usually the direction you scroll.

2707
03:04:33,028 --> 03:04:36,230
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also much easier to play than other Bloodhound games.

2708
03:04:36,430 --> 03:04:44,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Even with the in-game difficulty at the highest, I can get to the final stage easily.

2709
03:04:44,793 --> 03:04:52,797
[SPEAKER_02]: But on other shooters, I usually end up only halfway through the game on my first credit.

2710
03:04:56,249 --> 03:04:56,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

2711
03:04:56,889 --> 03:04:57,770
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get that far?

2712
03:04:58,270 --> 03:05:03,353
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that would be the harder game, because usually those shmup games are impossibly difficult.

2713
03:05:05,274 --> 03:05:07,175
[SPEAKER_02]: They do call them bullet hell for a reason, though.

2714
03:05:23,962 --> 03:05:30,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I fired bombs on the first boss of the Don't Black Style Joe, and that's not something I do in most shooters.

2715
03:05:31,527 --> 03:05:38,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I can easily get through the stage one boss of a vertical shooter just fine without using any bombs.

2716
03:05:40,614 --> 03:05:42,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

2717
03:05:42,695 --> 03:05:48,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, are there any other games coming up in the near future that you're going to be reviewing in the future on the show that you're looking forward to playing?

2718
03:05:49,845 --> 03:05:58,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure, because I've tried a whole lot of buying new games until the semester begins next month, because Deathmoth and Stem of Punishment took a toll on my money.

2719
03:06:00,052 --> 03:06:01,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear ya.

2720
03:06:02,074 --> 03:06:06,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I have a car payment, so I have to watch my gaming funding as well, so I think a lot of us are in that pinch.

2721
03:06:06,057 --> 03:06:12,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, including tax, both of those games cost me $110, so I've already been waiting until the semester begins, so I'll probably, I don't

2722
03:06:15,629 --> 03:06:16,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Reekin Elite Reekin Elite

2723
03:06:37,155 --> 03:06:39,818
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm a long-time listener but first-time caller.

2724
03:06:39,898 --> 03:06:42,001
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always wanted someone to say that on this program.

2725
03:06:42,041 --> 03:06:43,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Long-time listener, first-time caller.

2726
03:06:44,023 --> 03:06:44,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, welcome.

2727
03:06:45,204 --> 03:06:45,845
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing?

2728
03:06:46,165 --> 03:06:46,666
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind?

2729
03:06:46,726 --> 03:06:47,446
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing good.

2730
03:06:48,648 --> 03:06:49,168
[SPEAKER_05]: How can we help you?

2731
03:06:49,188 --> 03:06:49,589
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind?

2732
03:06:50,430 --> 03:06:52,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just wanted to know, I have a quick question.

2733
03:06:52,310 --> 03:06:56,371
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you guys ever played it before, but Borderlands, what do you think about that?

2734
03:06:56,551 --> 03:06:57,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Borderlands is awesome!

2735
03:06:59,232 --> 03:07:06,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not played Borderlands, but I've watched someone else play it, and it kind of looks like, it has a really neat art style.

2736
03:07:06,214 --> 03:07:13,776
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like Oblivion meets this very, like, post-apocalyptic kind of world.

2737
03:07:13,936 --> 03:07:14,296
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2738
03:07:14,356 --> 03:07:14,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you played this?

2739
03:07:15,456 --> 03:07:17,857
[SPEAKER_08]: With guns, and it's fun.

2740
03:07:18,137 --> 03:07:18,657
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome.

2741
03:07:18,877 --> 03:07:19,837
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hilarious.

2742
03:07:20,077 --> 03:07:20,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it was either one.

2743
03:07:20,818 --> 03:07:21,559
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't bother me too much.

2744
03:07:21,579 --> 03:07:23,921
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to know if the community was big, you know, as in...

2745
03:07:42,833 --> 03:07:47,396
[SPEAKER_01]: playing it, because the last thing I wanted was to go online on it and then nobody ain't there.

2746
03:07:47,556 --> 03:07:48,697
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my fear.

2747
03:07:48,977 --> 03:08:01,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to throw out a cheat plug while I can for our Steam community, which is the OL Army on Steam, and I see people on there once in a while playing Borderlands, so you definitely would have people to play with there.

2748
03:08:01,986 --> 03:08:03,627
[SPEAKER_05]: They've released several expansions for it.

2749
03:08:03,647 --> 03:08:05,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I've really heard nothing but good things about it.

2750
03:08:05,268 --> 03:08:10,211
[SPEAKER_05]: I just haven't had the time to play it myself, thanks to certain MMOs that I spend a lot of time playing.

2751
03:08:10,231 --> 03:08:10,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Addict!

2752
03:08:13,593 --> 03:08:15,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I say wow too all the time?

2753
03:08:15,514 --> 03:08:17,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, then you understand what I go through.

2754
03:08:19,776 --> 03:08:23,338
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, no, I've honestly heard nothing but good things about the game.

2755
03:08:23,698 --> 03:08:24,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a thought.

2756
03:08:25,159 --> 03:08:28,361
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to try it out, here's what some people I know are doing.

2757
03:08:29,221 --> 03:08:35,945
[SPEAKER_05]: OnLive is this new thing that's out there, and they're still doing sign-ups, and I just read something like it's extended through Labor Day.

2758
03:08:36,465 --> 03:08:38,686
[SPEAKER_05]: You can try to get into the beta by signing up.

2759
03:08:39,006 --> 03:08:39,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you on OnLive?

2760
03:08:40,667 --> 03:08:40,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2761
03:08:41,204 --> 03:08:44,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you can play demos of games.

2762
03:08:44,070 --> 03:08:48,600
[SPEAKER_05]: You can play the first 30 or 45 minutes of a game without buying it, and Borderlands is one of them.

2763
03:08:49,545 --> 03:08:50,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.

2764
03:08:51,026 --> 03:08:52,426
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a nice, good suggestion.

2765
03:08:52,446 --> 03:08:53,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

2766
03:08:53,146 --> 03:08:53,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2767
03:08:53,707 --> 03:08:54,227
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

2768
03:08:54,307 --> 03:08:55,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Go on to OnLive.

2769
03:08:55,387 --> 03:08:59,609
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I gotta say, as weird as I think the OnLive price is, but here's my suggestion.

2770
03:08:59,649 --> 03:09:13,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't buy it on OnLive, because the whole thing is that, yeah, it's cool that you're playing through another computer that has all the graphics and everything, but you're paying the same price you'd pay at retail for the game, and it really is only guaranteed to last three years.

2771
03:09:13,394 --> 03:09:15,415
[SPEAKER_05]: If OnLive fails, you're gonna lose that game.

2772
03:09:15,735 --> 03:09:17,076
[SPEAKER_05]: You're basically paying for a three-year rental.

2773
03:09:17,336 --> 03:09:17,416
[SPEAKER_05]: So,

2774
03:09:18,136 --> 03:09:19,797
[SPEAKER_05]: If you like the game, go get it on Steam.

2775
03:09:20,777 --> 03:09:21,038
Okay.

2776
03:09:21,478 --> 03:09:21,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2777
03:09:22,238 --> 03:09:22,958
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my suggestion.

2778
03:09:22,998 --> 03:09:24,699
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one more quick question and I'll hang up.

2779
03:09:24,799 --> 03:09:25,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.

2780
03:09:25,260 --> 03:09:28,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think Project Natal... What do you think about Project Natal?

2781
03:09:28,221 --> 03:09:30,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think it's going to fail or do you think it's going to succeed?

2782
03:09:30,422 --> 03:09:33,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, keep in mind we're all supposed to call it Connect now, but...

2783
03:09:35,644 --> 03:09:38,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a huge risk on Microsoft's part.

2784
03:09:38,805 --> 03:09:40,946
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of it has to do with how they market it.

2785
03:09:41,566 --> 03:09:48,269
[SPEAKER_05]: The Macy's thing, as much as we give them a hard time about who the hell at Macy's plays Kinect, we know exactly who they're going for.

2786
03:09:48,769 --> 03:09:58,752
[SPEAKER_05]: All laughing and jokes aside, they're trying to appeal to Mom, or aka Santa Claus, because they're going directly to make their case there and show the games there.

2787
03:09:58,812 --> 03:10:00,993
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a huge risk on Microsoft's part.

2788
03:10:01,633 --> 03:10:01,914
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

2789
03:10:19,617 --> 03:10:19,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Got you.

2790
03:10:20,057 --> 03:10:20,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

2791
03:10:20,797 --> 03:10:21,838
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to end it with that.

2792
03:10:21,998 --> 03:10:22,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Love the show.

2793
03:10:22,938 --> 03:10:23,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it up.

2794
03:10:23,378 --> 03:10:24,079
[SPEAKER_01]: The good work, man.

2795
03:10:24,099 --> 03:10:24,839
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are awesome.

2796
03:10:24,859 --> 03:10:25,219
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.

2797
03:10:25,439 --> 03:10:26,279
[SPEAKER_01]: We love the call.

2798
03:10:26,340 --> 03:10:27,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for your enthusiasm.

2799
03:10:27,760 --> 03:10:28,100
[SPEAKER_05]: You're awesome.

2800
03:10:28,160 --> 03:10:31,321
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you for saying the phrase that we've been waiting to hear.

2801
03:10:31,441 --> 03:10:31,661
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

2802
03:10:31,701 --> 03:10:33,022
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been waiting eight years to hear that.

2803
03:10:33,062 --> 03:10:33,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Long time listener.

2804
03:10:33,642 --> 03:10:34,042
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2805
03:10:34,142 --> 03:10:34,703
[SPEAKER_05]: I got you.

2806
03:10:34,843 --> 03:10:35,143
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2807
03:10:35,323 --> 03:10:35,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, buddy.

2808
03:10:35,903 --> 03:10:36,183
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2809
03:10:36,203 --> 03:10:36,943
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a good night.

2810
03:10:37,224 --> 03:10:37,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-huh.

2811
03:10:37,524 --> 03:10:37,844
[SPEAKER_05]: You too.

2812
03:10:38,704 --> 03:10:38,984
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2813
03:10:39,024 --> 03:10:39,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye-bye.

2814
03:10:39,344 --> 03:10:39,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

2815
03:10:39,985 --> 03:10:45,507
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how you know we're like legitimate radio now because you know whenever you listen to like a radio talk show, there's always that guy that calls in.

2816
03:10:46,967 --> 03:10:47,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Dr. Laura.

2817
03:10:47,807 --> 03:10:48,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Long time listener.

2818
03:10:48,588 --> 03:10:49,268
[SPEAKER_05]: First time caller.

2819
03:10:50,720 --> 03:10:51,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Love it.

2820
03:10:53,584 --> 03:10:56,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why I named Dr. Laura because she actually really sucks.

2821
03:10:56,848 --> 03:10:57,929
[SPEAKER_08]: It means we've arrived.

2822
03:10:58,110 --> 03:10:58,570
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.

2823
03:10:58,610 --> 03:10:59,051
[SPEAKER_05]: We made it.

2824
03:11:00,032 --> 03:11:00,493
[SPEAKER_05]: We made it.

2825
03:11:00,893 --> 03:11:01,915
[SPEAKER_05]: That decree meant something.

2826
03:11:01,975 --> 03:11:04,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the Laverne and Shirley theme is going through my head for some reason.

2827
03:11:05,259 --> 03:11:06,380
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna do it.

2828
03:11:09,885 --> 03:11:16,247
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, Gold Anthro in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com is kind of offering the counterpoint to what I was just saying about Borderlands.

2829
03:11:16,607 --> 03:11:18,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Meh, Borderlands just isn't the game for me.

2830
03:11:18,868 --> 03:11:21,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I played it and was like, this isn't as fun as it sounded.

2831
03:11:21,969 --> 03:11:24,990
[SPEAKER_05]: So, not everybody's a fan, so take that.

2832
03:11:25,250 --> 03:11:28,531
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think OnLive is going to be great for demos.

2833
03:11:30,511 --> 03:11:33,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, even I have to pat myself on the back.

2834
03:11:33,092 --> 03:11:39,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a good idea to just go play the first 30 minutes of the game for yourself and make a determination if you want to play, you know, more.

2835
03:11:41,016 --> 03:11:41,736
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2836
03:11:41,757 --> 03:11:44,858
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2837
03:11:45,378 --> 03:11:46,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?

2838
03:11:48,288 --> 03:11:48,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonic 2 XL

2839
03:12:12,182 --> 03:12:13,524
[SPEAKER_03]: But he gets a big old pot belly.

2840
03:12:13,844 --> 03:12:14,485
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of funny.

2841
03:12:15,126 --> 03:12:16,428
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's actually a real ROM hack.

2842
03:12:16,448 --> 03:12:20,914
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually download the ROM that's available on the Sonic Retro forums.

2843
03:12:21,495 --> 03:12:26,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Forums.sonicretro.org So check it out there.

2844
03:12:28,624 --> 03:12:29,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I say this real quick?

2845
03:12:29,505 --> 03:12:42,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Bonds006 in chat just spoke up and it reminded me of something he said earlier that I forgot to mention, but apparently he ran into a New York Times reporter who was doing a story on DDR and Beat Media and stuff.

2846
03:12:42,680 --> 03:12:44,062
[SPEAKER_05]: He totally pimped our show.

2847
03:12:45,034 --> 03:12:46,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that's a fan!

2848
03:12:46,214 --> 03:12:47,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that's a fan!

2849
03:12:47,035 --> 03:12:48,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you!

2850
03:12:48,035 --> 03:12:49,135
[SPEAKER_08]: We love you now.

2851
03:12:49,155 --> 03:12:50,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw that in the chat room.

2852
03:12:50,616 --> 03:12:51,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I forgot to mention earlier.

2853
03:12:51,856 --> 03:12:55,778
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to mention it after the iTunes review, but I'm easily distracted by shiny things.

2854
03:12:56,498 --> 03:12:57,278
[SPEAKER_05]: So I apologize.

2855
03:12:57,298 --> 03:12:58,578
[SPEAKER_03]: It's alright.

2856
03:12:59,119 --> 03:13:06,321
[SPEAKER_03]: You may remember there's a company called Blick that puts out different gamer decals or vinyl decals you can put up on the wall.

2857
03:13:06,401 --> 03:13:09,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm using them in our nursery.

2858
03:13:09,602 --> 03:13:11,003
[SPEAKER_03]: I could have just done that for the baby room.

2859
03:13:33,604 --> 03:13:35,166
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura should have that up in the vault.

2860
03:13:35,186 --> 03:13:37,428
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that looks kind of cool.

2861
03:13:56,568 --> 03:13:58,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, actually, the way the vault's designed, that wouldn't really work.

2862
03:13:58,569 --> 03:14:03,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Dan and I actually did have a talk, because I'm sure I've mentioned it on the show before.

2863
03:14:04,532 --> 03:14:10,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we were gonna, you know, when we were talking about a kid, we were gonna do a Mario theme.

2864
03:14:11,515 --> 03:14:14,216
[SPEAKER_08]: And Dan said, uh-uh, Sonic.

2865
03:14:17,758 --> 03:14:21,720
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be great, too, because at Loki's house, it'll be Mario, and then you'll have Sonic.

2866
03:14:21,760 --> 03:14:23,241
[SPEAKER_05]: What do I get, Crash Bandicoot?

2867
03:14:25,142 --> 03:14:25,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2868
03:14:26,042 --> 03:14:26,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2869
03:14:28,283 --> 03:14:29,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Crash Bandicoot?

2870
03:14:29,603 --> 03:14:33,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Crash Bandicoot was fun for like three games and then they just totally beat him into the ground.

2871
03:14:33,845 --> 03:14:34,705
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll get Kevin Butler.

2872
03:14:36,105 --> 03:14:37,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Kevin Butler themed nursery?

2873
03:14:37,946 --> 03:14:38,946
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be creepy.

2874
03:14:42,328 --> 03:14:43,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is the baby crying all the time?

2875
03:14:43,908 --> 03:14:46,189
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what's going on.

2876
03:14:49,742 --> 03:14:50,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?

2877
03:14:50,583 --> 03:14:50,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2878
03:14:51,283 --> 03:14:54,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Cave has announced two more shmup games coming out.

2879
03:14:55,344 --> 03:15:03,106
[SPEAKER_03]: They are going to be releasing, I guess, Gwangi on Xbox Live Arcade.

2880
03:15:03,126 --> 03:15:07,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I should say, yeah, they're going to be releasing that.

2881
03:15:07,928 --> 03:15:08,108
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

2882
03:15:10,123 --> 03:15:11,444
[SPEAKER_03]: What else are they releasing here?

2883
03:15:15,446 --> 03:15:16,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, here we go.

2884
03:15:16,486 --> 03:15:23,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Akai Katana, or Red Katana, is going to be a new bullet hell shooter coming out.

2885
03:15:24,390 --> 03:15:29,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that's going to be on, I think, the download services like Xbox Live Arcade.

2886
03:15:29,893 --> 03:15:35,035
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for the iPhone, they're going to do Dondopatchi Daifukatsu.

2887
03:15:35,055 --> 03:15:36,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

2888
03:15:36,296 --> 03:15:38,037
[SPEAKER_08]: I totally want Dondopatchi on my phone.

2889
03:15:38,908 --> 03:15:40,830
[SPEAKER_03]: And that'll be coming out on the iPhone this summer.

2890
03:15:42,992 --> 03:15:44,033
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of cool.

2891
03:15:44,053 --> 03:15:44,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

2892
03:15:45,134 --> 03:15:49,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Screenshots here of... That's a private video.

2893
03:15:49,198 --> 03:15:49,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, fuck you.

2894
03:15:49,798 --> 03:15:50,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to read it then.

2895
03:15:51,620 --> 03:15:52,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Or watch it.

2896
03:15:52,381 --> 03:15:52,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

2897
03:15:55,472 --> 03:16:21,143
[SPEAKER_03]: apparently Amazon Germany has listed a Xbox 360 4GB arcade system bundle of course they've already announced that they're going to be doing some sort of arcade system this fall in the US and other territories but now we kind of have an idea of what it's going to be it's going to be probably that slimmed down system without a hard drive but a 4GB USB thumb drive they're going to be able to use with it

2898
03:16:23,624 --> 03:16:48,469
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's fine since remember you can actually put in your own laptop drives into the Xbox 360 S or whatever the hell you're going to call it just like you can on a Playstation 3 so that's kind of neat I guess but that will be available this fall it looks like it's going to be well right now it's listing at 148.99 euros

2899
03:16:55,104 --> 03:16:55,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

2900
03:17:02,383 --> 03:17:06,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Apple needs to work on, I don't know, like making the iOS's work on their phones first.

2901
03:17:26,980 --> 03:17:27,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

2902
03:17:43,399 --> 03:17:45,040
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that I shouldn't get an Apple.

2903
03:17:45,080 --> 03:17:45,940
[SPEAKER_05]: I shouldn't buy an iPhone.

2904
03:17:45,960 --> 03:17:46,681
[SPEAKER_05]: I shouldn't support them.

2905
03:17:47,441 --> 03:17:48,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I won't.

2906
03:17:48,182 --> 03:17:48,502
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2907
03:17:49,642 --> 03:17:52,724
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we all know I'm going to get that shiny white new iPhone because I want it.

2908
03:17:53,284 --> 03:17:53,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2909
03:17:55,746 --> 03:17:57,687
[SPEAKER_05]: SGA100 Matt is currently working on a Kmart review.

2910
03:17:57,727 --> 03:17:58,307
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so excited.

2911
03:17:58,727 --> 03:18:00,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's it though for the show now.

[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have massive advertising or anything like that.

2915
03:18:11,138 --> 03:18:16,183
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really word of mouth and the awesome reviews you guys do and telling reporters and shit about us.

2916
03:18:16,483 --> 03:18:35,761
[SPEAKER_05]: that is word of mouth at it's finest thank you guys so much we so appreciate it and you guys are the reason we come back week after week and don't let the state fair distract us from doing a show alright but Disneyland might I'm just putting it out there alright anyhow for now though we're going to go around and give everybody's final thoughts Loki why don't you start us off tonight with your final thought

2917
03:18:36,201 --> 03:18:37,082
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, your final thought

2918
03:18:58,925 --> 03:19:00,567
[SPEAKER_08]: My Sims house is freaking gorgeous.

2919
03:19:01,488 --> 03:19:02,909
[SPEAKER_05]: You've put a lot of flowers in it.

2920
03:19:02,949 --> 03:19:04,871
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very girly house because you have flowers everywhere.

2921
03:19:04,911 --> 03:19:05,772
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not very girly.

2922
03:19:06,312 --> 03:19:09,655
[SPEAKER_08]: It's this one part of it that's set up as a wildflower garden.

2923
03:19:10,276 --> 03:19:12,118
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are totally Sakura trees, aren't they?

2924
03:19:12,318 --> 03:19:12,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they are.

2925
03:19:13,599 --> 03:19:17,323
[SPEAKER_08]: But the rest of the house is very sort of neo-modern and my house floats.

2926
03:19:18,644 --> 03:19:19,425
[SPEAKER_08]: We all float here.

2927
03:19:21,047 --> 03:19:21,367
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2928
03:19:21,888 --> 03:19:22,308
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

2929
03:19:22,608 --> 03:19:24,689
[SPEAKER_05]: We're tuning out and signing off.

2930
03:19:24,809 --> 03:19:26,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys so much again for your support.

2931
03:19:26,911 --> 03:19:28,692
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back to do it all again next week.

2932
03:19:28,712 --> 03:19:31,253
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you next week with more of Orange.

2933
03:19:31,493 --> 03:19:36,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless Loki's wife has the baby, then he won't be here because that could happen at any time.

2934
03:19:36,576 --> 03:19:37,177
[SPEAKER_05]: So stay tuned to Twitter.

2935
03:19:37,197 --> 03:19:38,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I hope she doesn't have anything.

2936
03:19:38,077 --> 03:19:39,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, that's true.

2937
03:19:39,238 --> 03:19:40,579
[SPEAKER_05]: She's still got, what, another month, right?

2938
03:19:42,460 --> 03:19:43,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Preferably at least two weeks.

2939
03:19:44,381 --> 03:19:45,062
[SPEAKER_05]: At least two weeks.

2940
03:19:45,102 --> 03:19:45,522
[SPEAKER_05]: All right then.

2941
03:19:45,602 --> 03:19:47,123
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully two more weeks of Loki at least.

2942
03:19:47,483 --> 03:19:47,764
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2943
03:19:48,604 --> 03:19:49,025
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's it.

2944
03:19:49,345 --> 03:19:50,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a wonderful night everybody.

2945
03:19:50,706 --> 03:19:53,387
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you soon next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

03:19:53,648 --> 03:19:53,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Good night.
