25000	28000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello everybody out there on the internet
33000	37000	And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
37000	40000	We are that video game show dedicated to
40000	43000	Video games, gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle
43000	45000	You name it, you talk about it
45000	48000	Live in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com
48000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts
50000	53000	I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host
53000	55000	And only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
55000	56000	Hi!
56000	57000	How are you doing, Jamie?
57000	58000	Hi
58000	59000	You're high?
59000	61000	No, actually, um
61000	63000	Starting the Prop 19 celebration a little early?
63000	65000	No, no, no
65000	67000	I've got Vicodin in me
67000	68000	I see
68000	70000	Because I've got a slice in my hand
70000	72000	Yes, you had your surgery
72000	74000	As we've been talking about for a couple weeks on the show
74000	76000	Because it was scheduled last week
76000	78000	But it happened for real Tuesday, right?
78000	80000	It did, and it was really boring
80000	82000	But you're here, so obviously you're doing alright
82000	84000	Yeah, it hurts
84000	86000	I'm sorry, well Vicodin's supposed to help that
86000	90000	No, Vicodin's supposed to make you not care
90000	91000	Supposed to?
91000	92000	Supposed to
92000	94000	Oh, it's going to be a fun show, folks
94000	96000	Well, I was fun yesterday, though
96000	98000	I was really entertaining, I feel
98000	100000	I'm going to get into yesterday in just a minute
100000	102000	But it would not be a show if I didn't introduce the one and only
102000	104000	Techmaster, Loke
104000	106000	It would be a show, I just wouldn't be introduced
106000	108000	How are you doing, Loke?
108000	109000	I'm doing fine
109000	110000	Excellent
110000	112000	How's the baby room painting going?
112000	114000	Because I've seen pictures show up
114000	116000	And for the listeners who might be new to OLR
116000	118000	Who are just tuning in for the first time
118000	121000	Loke's wife is expecting really soon, right?
121000	123000	I think in the next couple weeks
123000	128000	August 19th, but she's 35 weeks and 3 days now
128000	129000	Wow
129000	130000	So, you know
130000	132000	She looks like she's ready to pop
132000	134000	She's basically ready to pop
134000	135000	That's right
135000	137000	What I'm surprised, to be honest, is our friends
137000	138000	Annie and Jim
138000	140000	I mean, you know, Annie
140000	142000	She's 39 and I don't even
142000	144000	She'll be 40 weeks next Wednesday
144000	145000	Or this coming Wednesday
145000	146000	Wow
146000	147000	So she's ready to go
147000	149000	That baby's well done
149000	151000	That baby is done
151000	153000	Well, it's her first, right?
153000	155000	Yes, possibly going to be extra crispy, but
155000	159000	Well, Becky was 10 days overdue with Julian
159000	161000	But yeah, so any day
161000	164000	Basically, they get to the point, though
164000	166000	The doctor will only let you go up to 42 weeks
166000	168000	And then they just say, okay, no, you're having the baby
168000	170000	We're inducing you and you're going
170000	172000	So, no, but Nellie
172000	175000	She's hoping to have the baby by the end of the month
175000	177000	Preferably at 37 weeks
177000	180000	Which would be a week from this coming Thursday
180000	183000	And we don't know what's going to happen to OLR
183000	184000	While you're gone
184000	186000	Knowing you, you'll be here
186000	187000	Even if she delivers Sunday morning
187000	189000	I will probably be gone at least a week or two
189000	191000	But it is so funny
191000	193000	Because, like, there's seriously
193000	195000	People like vultures clamoring for your spot
195000	197000	While you're gone
197000	199000	Even that one week
199000	201000	Drew's been showing up more and more lately
201000	203000	We got an email tonight
203000	205000	That Jamie's going to read later
205000	206000	That has another suggestion
206000	207000	So it's really funny
207000	209000	It's too bad he's not here this week
209000	211000	It really only takes three weeks
211000	213000	But unfortunately
213000	215000	He was shy one week
215000	216000	So that ain't going to work
216000	217000	Well, we'll figure it out
217000	218000	But the point I was actually trying to make
218000	219000	For those that didn't know
219000	221000	You are doing your baby room in a
221000	223000	What? New Super Mario Brothers theme, right?
223000	224000	Yes, New Super Mario Brothers theme
224000	225000	So we've got
225000	227000	We've been painting a lot
227000	229000	And actually I'm trying to get them uploaded
229000	231000	On the photo gallery thing
231000	234000	But it's being a little on the slow side
234000	236000	There's some pictures right now on there
236000	238000	That are really
238000	240000	It's a lot of work ago
240000	242000	I mean, there's a lot of stuff we've done
242000	244000	Since the stuff I posted
244000	247000	And I'd say it's about now
247000	249000	Maybe
249000	251000	I don't know, 60
251000	253000	60, 75% done
253000	255000	And this is all the base stuff
255000	257000	We still have to go back and actually shade it
257000	260000	So that it looks more 3D looking I guess
260000	263000	But I will probably be posting
263000	266000	Pictures in the chat room
266000	268000	I have uploaded them to Flickr
268000	270000	So I'll be posting a link to that
270000	273000	In the meantime while we're waiting for them to upload on the website
273000	275000	Yeah, I know there were some changes on our website this week
275000	276000	And I'm going to get into
276000	277000	It's mostly transparent
277000	278000	Except for this apparently
278000	279000	The picture thing is slowing down
279000	281000	Most of the changes that happened to the website this week
281000	282000	Are transparent
282000	284000	But I'll talk about those in a little bit
284000	285000	When we get to housekeeping
285000	287000	I actually have a lot of housekeeping tonight
287000	289000	But first I need to give a plug to
289000	290000	All Games
290000	292000	Because we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio
292000	294000	www.allgames.com
294000	296000	6 o'clock Pacific
296000	297000	9 o'clock Eastern
297000	299000	Thereabouts right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
299000	301000	We were a little late tonight
301000	302000	And that was my bad
302000	303000	Because I got caught in traffic
303000	305000	Coming back from San Francisco
305000	307000	Which actually is going to tie into
307000	308000	Where we're going to start tonight
308000	311000	We usually do start off the show talking about our gaming weeks
311000	314000	But Dark Soccer and I kind of had a unique event yesterday in our gaming week
314000	315000	We did
315000	317000	And I know Jamie wants to talk all about this
317000	318000	I do
318000	319000	So Dark Soccer
319000	320000	California Xtreme
320000	322000	Tell the listeners who don't know
322000	324000	Because I find not a lot of people outside of California
324000	325000	Or NorCal even
325000	326000	Seem to know what this is
326000	328000	So tell our listeners what this is all about
328000	329000	Where it's at
329000	330000	Why we go
330000	332000	It was Xtreme
332000	339000	California Xtreme is a classic arcade and pinball type of expo thing
339000	344000	And they have speakers, do panels, typical convention stuff
344000	346000	But all the games are out there on free play
346000	352000	And they've got pins dating back from the 50's and up
352000	355000	They even had the Iron Man pinball there
355000	357000	Which by the way was not very exciting
357000	359000	Stern sorry you sucked at this one
359000	363000	I was way more interested in the Dark Knight table they had a picture of
363000	364000	But didn't actually have there
364000	367000	Yeah that's supposed to be pretty hardcore
367000	369000	Dude they had Big Bang Bar though
369000	370000	I'm glad the people that bring
370000	372000	And it was the real Big Bang Bar not the
372000	376000	Because they got the rights to redo Big Bang Bar
376000	380000	Okay I gotta rewind because you know how disjointed I'm gonna be tonight
380000	383000	Big Bang Bar was a table they were only like 16 prototypes of
383000	387000	That Capcom's pinball division did before they decided to not do that anymore
387000	392000	And they eventually did the rights did get out
392000	394000	And someone was doing reproductions of them
394000	396000	But this was one of the 16 prototypes
396000	399000	So it was pretty cool
399000	402000	Anyway they had like
402000	404000	They had the Star Wars pachinko machine
404000	407000	They had old pong
407000	409000	They had a game called Touch Me
409000	411000	It was very 70's
411000	414000	Cocktail tables, sit downs
414000	417000	A really nice Star Wars arcade
417000	420000	It was kind of like going into Microsoft's game room but for real
420000	421000	And journey
421000	423000	Like if it was a real place
423000	425000	They just take this ballroom and just lots of arcade
425000	427000	And more pinball than I was expecting
427000	429000	I didn't realize how much of it was dominated by pinball
429000	432000	They had ultra pin there too
432000	434000	The ultra-cade pinball
434000	437000	That was a cool machine I played pinbot on that it was cool
437000	440000	I've played one of those before like I played Black Knight for a while on there
440000	442000	But it's not the same for me
442000	444000	I've wanted to make one of those but it really
444000	446000	It's cost prohibitive
446000	450000	It's really expensive I have an extra TV that I could use for that
450000	453000	But it's just I don't play that much pinball
453000	456000	And considering how much I play my arcade machine
456000	458000	I don't need to build one of these
458000	461000	Let me go to our chat room at chat.orangelaungerator.com
461000	464000	Because we do get live chat comments as we tape the show
464000	466000	And I'm going to start with Salacious Pop tonight
466000	467000	He was there with us yesterday
467000	468000	Salacious Pop in our chat says
468000	469000	Hi
469000	472000	I played a few rounds of Lethal Weapon 3 pinball
472000	476000	But try as I might I could not unlock the hidden racist misogynist screen
476000	479000	Yes I was hoping they would update the pinball machine
479000	482000	So that like when the ball goes down the gutter it would yell at you
482000	484000	I deserve to be blown
484000	487000	But unfortunately no not going to happen
487000	491000	Anyhow sorry classic games good times
491000	493000	Free play
493000	495000	You pay one fee to get in it was 40 bucks to get in
495000	497000	I got in for nothing
497000	499000	I got in as press for Geek Life
499000	500000	Yours special
500000	502000	Which by the way there's going to be a big write up on this
502000	506000	Showing up tomorrow morning on both Orange Lounge Radio and on Geek Life
506000	507000	Look at it
507000	509000	I had a geeky time while I was there
509000	512000	Looking at all the classes like I was playing a real gyrus machine
512000	513000	And a real time pilot machine
513000	516000	You can't emulate that so well on the 360
516000	520000	The tempest kept having problems with the vector
520000	522000	The vector display
522000	525000	Crystal castles with a real trackball the way it was meant to be played
525000	528000	The lifeguard trackball forward on the 5200
528000	531000	And I played for the first
531000	532000	I know this is going to surprise people
532000	535000	I don't believe I had ever played the Empire Strikes Back game
535000	536000	Isn't it great
536000	537000	Star Wars
537000	539000	Yes and the Star Wars vector game
539000	541000	Man that game was epic
541000	543000	Oh man I love that game
543000	545000	The one that they had there the sit down one
545000	548000	Had like this really nice bright monitor
548000	551000	And the speakers were just so clear
551000	554000	It was fantastic it didn't sound muddy or anything at all
554000	556000	I thought I got a bad headache playing it and it hurt my hand a lot
556000	559000	Because yeah I didn't really play a whole bunch of stuff while I was there
559000	561000	Because um
561000	564000	And we'll probably go into the surgery thing later
564000	566000	I've got 8 stitches in my right hand
566000	567000	Good times
567000	569000	And while I'm healing really nicely
569000	571000	They hurt a lot
571000	574000	Because unlike my last surgery when I moved my hand
574000	576000	I've got more range of motion now
576000	578000	But it pulls the stitches
578000	579000	Ew
579000	582000	And yeah well it'll bleed a little bit
582000	584000	It's really
584000	586000	But you were able to play some stuff
586000	588000	I played since I played Baby Pac Man
588000	589000	I had to play Baby Pac Man
589000	590000	Me too
590000	592000	And that game for being notoriously hard
592000	594000	I always remembered being kind of good at it
594000	597000	I got to the third stage which is not bad for Baby Pac Man
597000	599000	They had a Junior Pac Man
599000	602000	Which is like one of the really epic Pac Mans of its day
602000	605000	Of course I played Big Bang Bar
605000	607000	And Iron Man Pinball
607000	613000	I didn't play Journey
613000	614000	I played Star Wars
614000	615000	I played Journey it was awesome
615000	617000	I played Timber twice
617000	618000	Because I love those old school
618000	619000	I played Mouse Trap
619000	621000	And then Mouse Trap though was the big mistake
621000	625000	Because Mouse Trap has a right hand joystick
625000	627000	And I was like
627000	628000	And I forgot about the stupid bird
628000	630000	Because keep in mind when I was playing a lot of Mouse Trap
630000	632000	I was playing it on the ColecoVision
632000	634000	And there's no bird in the ColecoVision
634000	636000	You know what else was there that was very random
636000	641000	That was cool was a 80s or I guess maybe mid 90s laser disc jukebox
641000	643000	So the whole time people are there playing games
643000	645000	There's these old school songs playing
645000	647000	Everything from like you know
647000	650000	Contemporary-ish songs by like Garbage of You Two
650000	654000	To like pour some sugar on me
654000	656000	On the little four cube TV
656000	657000	Yeah it's there every year
657000	659000	One of those TVs that's made up of little TVs
659000	660000	It was awesome
660000	661000	Yeah totally 80s style
661000	663000	But there's more Rob
663000	664000	There's more
664000	665000	What?
665000	666000	Coin Toss was there
666000	668000	I love the Coin Toss game
668000	670000	It's like one of the old 50s games
670000	671000	It was so fantastic
671000	674000	Like one of the pre-course precursors to our pong
674000	675000	But anyway
675000	681000	There was the Boxcar game
681000	682000	The Sega Boxcar game
682000	684000	Oh yeah the Minecar
684000	686000	Like you actually push up and down on the big lever
686000	687000	Like an old Minecar
687000	689000	And Top Skater
689000	692000	And DDR something or the other
692000	693000	Extreme
693000	696000	I took some video of Mel and Ali playing
696000	698000	I actually got up there and played DDR
698000	699000	I'm not allowed to
699000	700000	Man am I out of shape
700000	702000	I'm not allowed to play DDR until my stitches come out
702000	703000	No
703000	704000	I can't get my heart rate
704000	705000	I miss much
705000	706000	I'm not supposed to get my heart rate up y'all
706000	708000	So I can't get very excited tonight
708000	709000	Um
709000	712000	Looking at our chatroom at chat.orangesonsradio.com
712000	713000	Sure
713000	715000	I always say this name wrong
715000	716000	Surezo in our chatroom says
716000	717000	Sounds like a nice spot
717000	720000	Damn I need to plan to get out to California Extreme
720000	722000	Now I think he's kind of local here
722000	723000	I think he's our guy
723000	724000	It was in Santa Clara
724000	726000	That golfs or does the Roseville Golf Line and everything
726000	727000	But I
727000	729000	Would this be something worth traveling to
729000	730000	Like a long distance
730000	731000	Totally
731000	732000	Totally
732000	733000	Yeah we were people there from out of country
733000	735000	I think they could
735000	736000	I mean here's the weird thing
736000	739000	It's an arcade trade show
739000	741000	So I get that they don't want to like expand on
741000	743000	Probably that core part of it
743000	746000	But you know what would have made that expo even more awesome
746000	748000	Would have been like a classic gaming room
748000	749000	With like console stuff
749000	750000	That reminds me
750000	753000	And I know that might be outside the scope of what they're trying to do but
753000	755000	Classic Gaming Expo is coming back
755000	756000	Oh yeah
756000	758000	In Las Vegas
758000	759000	We need to make plans
759000	761000	This was different from Classic Gaming Expo though
761000	762000	I can't really explain
762000	764000	Classic Gaming Expo was its own kind of thing
764000	765000	Yeah
765000	768000	Classic Gaming Expo was more like booths and things set up to remember
768000	770000	But this was just straight up a room full of free play games
770000	772000	I love the story though about
772000	776000	Because Dan's little brother Mason came with us
776000	778000	And there was
778000	780000	They were at this panel and Mason's like who's that
780000	781000	What did that guy do, make Atari?
781000	784000	And Dan's like why yes he actually did
784000	785000	And it was the
785000	786000	Nice
786000	788000	But I got to meet Steve Ritchie
788000	792000	Who designed at least a couple of the tables that we have in this house
792000	793000	No Fear
793000	794000	He did the voices for No Fear
794000	795000	So when I was
795000	798000	When I gave him some of our plastics to sign
798000	800000	And he started doing the voices from No Fear
800000	802000	And I was just
802000	803000	So cool and I talked to his wife
803000	804000	She was a really sweet lady
804000	807000	And told her about a pinball table that I'm designing
807000	810000	Because I'm actually designing the art and everything
810000	811000	And the layout for a pinball table
811000	813000	I just need someone who can program it
813000	814000	Vidpower in our chat room says
814000	817000	California Extreme was in the Donkey Kong documentary King of Kong
817000	818000	I don't remember that
818000	820000	Was that the place they go
820000	822000	I thought that was a place on the East Coast
822000	825000	But they go, it's like an expositions going on
825000	827000	And Billy, not Billy, the other guy
827000	831000	Steve tries to top the score at this expo
831000	833000	But he just barely misses it
833000	834000	He doesn't do it
834000	837000	Well no he did this at conventions since I thought
837000	838000	Yeah I don't know
838000	839000	But anyway
839000	842000	No Steve Wiebe's been I think at these conventions
842000	845000	And all those types of guys you see in that documentary
845000	847000	Are here at this type of event
847000	848000	Good times
848000	850000	Anyway though
850000	853000	And then there were vendors for pinball parts
853000	854000	And you know
854000	856000	A stern marketer was there
856000	858000	The guy who brought the Iron Man table
858000	861000	And the guy that plays the 12 string guitar thing
861000	862000	Was there
862000	864000	Because he's there every year
864000	866000	And he's always really cool
866000	867000	I just had this
867000	869000	I googled myself and I walked
869000	871000	I was walking sort of
871000	872000	Catty corner around
872000	874000	And all of a sudden in the distance I hear
874000	876000	Bong, bong, bong, bong
876000	879000	The Space Invaders thing
879000	884000	And then there's also one of our listeners there
884000	887000	Really cool guy, Carlson
887000	889000	Really cool guy
889000	892000	And I purchased a game for my husband
892000	896000	Got Gunstar Heroes for the Game Gear
896000	898000	I was kind of surprised
898000	899000	Treasure
899000	900000	I was surprised to see him there
900000	901000	Because the last time I had seen him
901000	902000	Was out in Washington D.C.
902000	903000	And he's based in the East Coast
903000	904000	He's mostly the cons out there
904000	907000	But I guess he has a relative that lives out here
907000	909000	So he was at this con
909000	910000	Very random moment
910000	912000	Because I was actually looking at the shirts
912000	913000	At his booth
913000	914000	And he has this really funny
914000	915000	And I guess this is his own original design
915000	917000	It says like Shaq Fu
917000	918000	I loved that
918000	919000	And I almost
919000	920000	I was thinking about buying it
920000	921000	But then I got distracted
921000	922000	Because he's like
922000	923000	Hey Rob
923000	924000	And I was like
924000	925000	Oh wow
925000	928000	I remember you from like four years ago
928000	929000	So this is kind of funny
929000	931000	Like running into people
931000	933000	He recognized me
933000	935000	And I didn't know who he was
935000	936000	Or anything
936000	937000	Well it was funny
937000	938000	I was looking for you
938000	939000	To go introduce you to him
939000	941000	When you just found him on your own
941000	942000	I had Melody and I did
942000	943000	Oh good times
943000	944000	I had a quick bundle
944000	945000	You just cut out suddenly
945000	946000	Did your switch go down?
946000	947000	Uh no
947000	948000	I don't have a switch
948000	949000	Oh weird
949000	951000	I don't know what happened
951000	952000	Well meh
952000	954000	Tonight is going to be a night of technical fun
954000	956000	The soundboard's on Vicodin
956000	957000	Alright well before we get to
957000	959000	The rest of our gaming weeks
959000	961000	Outside of
961000	962000	Oh boy
962000	963000	Outside of just this convention
963000	965000	Is there anything else you want to say about California Extreme?
965000	968000	Maybe the thing you most want to see them do next year?
968000	970000	Do it exactly like they did it
970000	972000	And make it cheaper
972000	973000	And bigger
973000	974000	And bigger
974000	975000	Oh yeah
975000	976000	Bring back the Kung Fu game
976000	979000	What game was it there at Kung Fu Master?
979000	980000	It wasn't there
980000	982000	And and and
982000	983000	Damn it
983000	985000	Somebody bring a theater of magic
985000	987000	Because Melody and I were annoyed
987000	988000	Alright
988000	989000	Well uh DarkSakura
989000	990000	I know you had the surgery
990000	992000	I don't know if you've been playing a lot of video games
992000	993000	But outside the expo
993000	994000	Did you play any video games this week?
994000	995000	How was your gaming week?
995000	997000	I'm playing Sims right now
997000	998000	Um
998000	1000000	I was playing some Sims
1000000	1002000	Um
1002000	1004000	I tried to play Star Trek Online
1004000	1005000	But it hurt too much
1005000	1007000	So I just went on to let my fleetmates know
1007000	1009000	That I wasn't dead of gangrene of the hand
1009000	1010000	Um
1010000	1012000	Um
1012000	1015000	Damn beat Crackdown finally
1015000	1016000	It was anticlimactic
1016000	1017000	First one or the new one?
1017000	1018000	Second one
1018000	1019000	Oh wow
1019000	1020000	It was anticlimactic
1020000	1021000	Um
1021000	1024000	And I also really hate the guy in that game
1024000	1025000	He's like
1025000	1027000	Are you trying to piss me off?
1027000	1029000	Go back to the tactical location
1029000	1030000	I just wanted to tell him
1030000	1032000	Shut up and bite my butt
1032000	1034000	You sound like you've got
1034000	1035000	A wedgie
1035000	1037000	Um
1037000	1039000	And um
1039000	1042000	I know I played something else
1042000	1044000	I don't remember
1044000	1046000	You're too high to remember
1046000	1047000	No, no
1047000	1048000	Um
1048000	1049000	Are you playing the Sims right now?
1049000	1051000	I said I was playing the Sims
1051000	1052000	Oh um
1052000	1054000	I played a little bit of Portal
1054000	1055000	A little bit of Portal
1055000	1056000	Just a little bit?
1056000	1057000	Just a little bit
1057000	1058000	It's just like
1058000	1060000	Just enough to get taunted by GLaDOS?
1060000	1061000	Yeah
1061000	1062000	It was just like
1062000	1063000	I'm getting so bored
1063000	1065000	Not being able to do much of anything
1065000	1066000	That I'll sit and start to play something
1066000	1067000	Like with the Sims at least
1067000	1068000	You know I can do a little bit
1068000	1069000	And rest my hand
1069000	1070000	But if I get in the middle of a battle
1070000	1071000	On Star Trek Online
1071000	1072000	I'm there until it's done
1072000	1074000	Cause you can't actually pause it
1074000	1076000	Unless you're on a
1076000	1077000	Away mission
1077000	1079000	Yeah, MMOs don't usually have a pause button
1079000	1080000	Yeah
1080000	1082000	And the only ones of those you can pause
1082000	1084000	Are the ones you're on there by yourself
1084000	1085000	So
1085000	1086000	Alright
1086000	1088000	Yeah, and it's only 45 seconds, meh
1088000	1089000	Uh, let's try Loki
1089000	1091000	How was your gaming week, Loki?
1091000	1093000	I didn't play a whole lot cause I was paying
1093000	1095000	So really the only stuff I played was at work
1095000	1096000	Gloria Paint!
1096000	1098000	Literally!
1098000	1099000	That's true
1099000	1100000	That is true
1100000	1101000	Um
1101000	1103000	No, the only things that I played this week
1103000	1105000	Was, um, actually Grand Theft Auto
1105000	1107000	But, um, kind of funny
1107000	1109000	We didn't really play much of the
1109000	1110000	Battle of the Gay Tony this week
1110000	1112000	Apparently my co-workers are tired of me
1112000	1114000	Kicking the crap out of them at
1114000	1115000	The Battle of the Gay Tony
1115000	1117000	So they went back to Lost in Dam
1117000	1119000	So I had to keep the crap out of them
1119000	1120000	In Lost in Dam
1120000	1121000	Um, but it's fun
1121000	1122000	It's a nice little break
1122000	1123000	I just
1123000	1126000	I always forgot how slow the characters run
1126000	1129000	And oh my god they run so damn slow
1129000	1130000	In that game
1130000	1131000	It's ridiculous
1131000	1132000	And
1132000	1134000	I don't know if they've
1134000	1136000	You know, remembered it being
1136000	1138000	It's not quite as exciting as I remembered it
1138000	1140000	Just because when we played it last
1140000	1141000	It was
1141000	1143000	With all sorts of crazy explosions going off
1143000	1144000	On our mod games
1144000	1146000	Which will hopefully come back soon
1146000	1148000	Once I'm done painting the baby's room
1148000	1149000	Um
1149000	1151000	But yeah, we've been playing lots of that
1151000	1153000	And that's pretty fun
1153000	1154000	And then
1154000	1156000	Uh, Crackdown 2
1156000	1157000	Played a little bit of that
1157000	1158000	The only thing I don't like about Crackdown 2
1158000	1159000	Well
1159000	1161000	There's many things I don't like about Crackdown 2
1161000	1163000	One of the new things I don't like about Crackdown 2
1163000	1164000	Was
1164000	1165000	Um
1165000	1167000	Our internet at my work is not the greatest
1167000	1169000	Because we're sharing it with like
1169000	1171000	80 computers
1171000	1172000	I mean it's ridiculous
1172000	1173000	But
1173000	1175000	Usually it's enough to play
1175000	1176000	Online games
1176000	1177000	Not a problem
1177000	1178000	Um
1178000	1179000	Every now and then we have connection issues
1179000	1181000	With trying to get into like say a
1181000	1182000	Free mode game or something like that
1182000	1183000	And Grand Theft Auto
1183000	1184000	But
1184000	1186000	You know, minor stuff that we can usually get around
1186000	1188000	Crackdown 2 will not allow me to play a game
1188000	1190000	With anybody else
1190000	1191000	At my work
1191000	1194000	Like if my co-workers say I want to play a game with him
1194000	1196000	It's impossible
1196000	1198000	I can join another person's game
1198000	1199000	Away from our work
1199000	1202000	But it will not allow me to connect to a person that's
1202000	1204000	Literally next to me
1204000	1206000	Is that maybe because the game is seeing you guys
1206000	1207000	Like in the same room
1207000	1208000	No
1208000	1209000	It's not
1209000	1210000	The reason is
1210000	1212000	It's saying that our um
1212000	1214000	Connection is too strict or
1214000	1216000	It's basically layman's terms for
1216000	1217000	Um
1217000	1218000	Our internet connection is too slow
1218000	1220000	I do just want to point out though
1220000	1222000	Loki you do know most people
1222000	1224000	Don't get to play Xbox at their jobs
1224000	1225000	Right
1225000	1226000	Just throwing that out there
1226000	1228000	I understand that but you know
1228000	1230000	I'm just saying during our break
1230000	1232000	We wanted to play some co-op Crackdown 2
1232000	1234000	Which would have been really fun
1234000	1235000	But uh
1235000	1236000	We can't do that and say we have to play
1236000	1238000	Lost and Damned
1238000	1239000	Um
1239000	1241000	But I just wish that they
1241000	1243000	First off I wish they just had System Link
1243000	1244000	Back from the first game
1244000	1246000	That would solve all the problems right there
1246000	1247000	Well most of the problems
1247000	1248000	Cause
1248000	1250000	Even Red Dead Redemption
1250000	1251000	And
1251000	1252000	It was
1252000	1253000	You know it was a good testament to how
1253000	1254000	Take Two
1254000	1256000	And Rockstar Games
1256000	1258000	Still find ways to fuck up multiplayer
1258000	1259000	Um
1259000	1261000	Even in Red Dead Redemption
1261000	1263000	It sometimes can't find
1263000	1264000	The other people
1264000	1265000	Like we'll be
1265000	1267000	And that was funny
1267000	1269000	We're playing Free Mode in Red Dead Redemption
1269000	1271000	And we go to try to play like a little
1271000	1272000	Deathmatch in there cause in
1272000	1274000	In the online for Red Dead
1274000	1276000	You have to basically go these different points
1276000	1278000	On the map and then it'll send an invite
1278000	1279000	To the other players that are playing
1279000	1281000	You know the System Link game with you
1281000	1282000	Um
1282000	1283000	That you want to do a
1283000	1284000	Deathmatch
1284000	1285000	So we all
1285000	1286000	You know say okay yes
1286000	1287000	Let's enter this Deathmatch
1287000	1289000	And then it puts us in the three separate
1289000	1290000	Deathmatches
1290000	1292000	With just us
1292000	1293000	Our one single
1293000	1295000	You know each person is in their own
1295000	1296000	Deathmatch
1296000	1297000	How the fuck does that happen
1297000	1298000	I have never seen
1298000	1299000	A System Link game
1299000	1301000	Not figure out how to connect to another
1301000	1302000	System Link
1302000	1303000	Console
1303000	1305000	It doesn't make any sense
1305000	1307000	Only Rockstar could do that
1308000	1309000	But yeah
1309000	1310000	So um
1310000	1312000	That's about all I played this week
1312000	1314000	Hopefully gonna play more once we get the
1314000	1315000	Babies room done cause
1315000	1317000	You know we're under a deadline here
1317000	1318000	And uh
1318000	1319000	You know I have lots
1319000	1320000	I have
1320000	1321000	You know
1321000	1322000	A little bit of work left to do
1322000	1323000	But um
1323000	1324000	It's looking good
1324000	1325000	Alright well good luck
1325000	1326000	With the rest of that
1326000	1327000	And uh
1327000	1328000	Our well wishes to the
1328000	1329000	Misses as well
1329000	1330000	And uh
1330000	1331000	Through all that
1331000	1332000	My gaming week
1332000	1333000	Outside of California Extreme
1333000	1334000	I've been playing
1334000	1335000	Um
1335000	1336000	Mostly the same stuff
1336000	1337000	I didn't get into a lot of new stuff
1337000	1338000	I would say the newest thing I played
1338000	1339000	Was some of the extensions
1339000	1341000	That they have in game room now
1341000	1342000	You know some of the recent games
1342000	1343000	That they released
1343000	1344000	But of course that's just really
1344000	1345000	Old stuff
1345000	1346000	With new paint on it
1346000	1347000	Uh
1347000	1348000	And
1348000	1349000	I can't tell you how
1349000	1350000	Horrifically
1350000	1351000	Games like
1351000	1352000	Kaboom
1352000	1354000	And Crystal Castles
1354000	1356000	And things that ran on the Xbox
1356000	1357000	Or I mean things that ran on like
1357000	1358000	Trackballs and
1358000	1359000	And uh
1359000	1360000	Paddles
1360000	1361000	How horrifically they translate
1361000	1363000	Into the Xbox 360 controls
1363000	1364000	But there are some other cool
1364000	1365000	Stuff on there
1365000	1366000	That I was playing
1366000	1367000	Um
1367000	1368000	Like Hero
1368000	1369000	H-E-R-O
1369000	1370000	Was still one of my favorite games
1370000	1371000	Uh
1371000	1372000	They did some changes to game room
1372000	1373000	This week too
1373000	1374000	Where now you have like a
1374000	1375000	Live leaderboard
1375000	1376000	As you are playing the game
1376000	1377000	You watch yourself climb up
1377000	1378000	This live leaderboard
1378000	1379000	On the right hand side of the screen
1379000	1380000	That's actually really cool
1380000	1381000	So um
1381000	1382000	I kinda
1382000	1383000	Was a fan of that
1383000	1384000	That's only a ranked match
1384000	1385000	By the way
1385000	1386000	So you have to actually own the game
1386000	1387000	To be able to see that
1387000	1388000	But um
1388000	1389000	Yeah
1389000	1390000	Uh
1390000	1391000	Still more Puzzle Quest 2
1391000	1392000	Still more Warcraft of course
1392000	1393000	I revisited
1393000	1394000	Revisited
1394000	1395000	Uh
1395000	1396000	The pinball games
1396000	1397000	That are on
1397000	1398000	Xbox 360
1398000	1399000	And Playstation 3
1399000	1400000	Zen Pinball
1400000	1401000	And Pinball FX
1401000	1402000	Uh
1402000	1403000	Because I was trying to uh
1403000	1404000	Represent OLR
1404000	1406000	In the big battle
1406000	1407000	Cause
1407000	1408000	The response from the listenership
1408000	1409000	So far has been a little bit tepid
1409000	1411000	But I'll get into that in a little bit
1411000	1412000	Um
1412000	1413000	So I was trying to help represent
1413000	1414000	OLR in that
1414000	1415000	And I tried
1415000	1416000	I didn't get at the top of leaderboard
1416000	1417000	But at least I
1417000	1418000	I got on it
1418000	1419000	So I'm happy with that
1419000	1420000	And
1420000	1421000	I hadn't really played
1421000	1423000	Especially the one on the PS3
1423000	1424000	I don't think I appreciated enough
1424000	1426000	But that Earth Defense Force table
1426000	1427000	On PS3
1427000	1428000	Is actually a lot of fun
1428000	1429000	And uh
1429000	1431000	I actually kind of enjoyed
1431000	1432000	Um
1432000	1433000	Getting to spend a little time with it
1433000	1434000	This week
1434000	1435000	As much as I was not
1435000	1436000	As wonderful at it
1436000	1437000	I'd be more excited about it
1437000	1438000	If it was actually
1438000	1439000	Earth Defense Force 2017
1439000	1440000	It is not
1440000	1441000	But it's
1441000	1442000	It's still cool
1442000	1443000	It's a cool little board
1443000	1444000	As far as pinball goes
1444000	1445000	But uh
1445000	1446000	Yeah had a good time with that
1446000	1447000	So that was
1447000	1448000	That was really it
1448000	1449000	There wasn't um
1449000	1450000	A whole lot of other
1450000	1451000	Stuff
1451000	1452000	In my gaming week
1452000	1453000	And I pretty much
1453000	1454000	Echo a lot of what
1454000	1455000	Dark Sakura said
1455000	1456000	With uh
1456000	1457000	California Extreme
1457000	1458000	Uh
1458000	1459000	Played a lot of fun games there
1459000	1460000	So uh
1460000	1461000	Since I brought up
1461000	1462000	The Big Battle
1462000	1463000	Let's go into housekeeping here tonight
1463000	1464000	Before we get into tonight's gaming news
1464000	1465000	Uh
1465000	1466000	Big Battle is
1466000	1467000	Is all games
1467000	1468000	Um
1468000	1469000	Kind of competition
1469000	1470000	With these various video games
1470000	1471000	Uh
1471000	1472000	Throughout all the different shows
1472000	1473000	On all games
1473000	1474000	Well
1474000	1475000	Most of them
1475000	1476000	I don't think all of them
1476000	1477000	Signed up
1477000	1478000	Of quite a few
1478000	1479000	Are participating
1479000	1480000	In RPG Grinders
1480000	1481000	Electric Sisterhood
1481000	1482000	All these other shows
1482000	1483000	On the network
1483000	1484000	Sorry I didn't name them all
1484000	1485000	But they're all there
1485000	1486000	Uh
1486000	1487000	At thebigbattle.net
1487000	1488000	And um
1488000	1489000	It's really just for fun
1489000	1490000	It's not
1490000	1491000	Although I hear now
1491000	1492000	There's a prize
1492000	1493000	I got an email this week
1493000	1494000	That now there is a prize
1494000	1495000	So get this
1495000	1496000	The winning show
1496000	1497000	And this is not about the hosts
1497000	1498000	Of the show doing battle
1498000	1499000	With each other
1499000	1500000	Although I'm choosing to participate
1500000	1502000	This is about the listenerships
1502000	1503000	Representing the shows
1503000	1504000	In these battles
1504000	1505000	Well
1505000	1506000	The winning show now
1506000	1507000	As I understand it
1507000	1508000	Is going to get
1508000	1511000	A gold Atari 2600
1511000	1512000	So it's a
1512000	1513000	Like I think it's just
1513000	1514000	Spray painted gold
1514000	1515000	But it will be an
1515000	1517000	Atari trophy
1517000	1518000	So I know Dark Soccer's
1518000	1519000	Dying to have one of those
1519000	1520000	In the vault
1520000	1521000	Although
1521000	1522000	I do think
1522000	1524000	If we get a gold Atari 2600
1524000	1525000	We should maybe
1525000	1526000	I don't know
1526000	1527000	Give it to a listener
1527000	1528000	That helped us get it
1528000	1529000	Maybe?
1529000	1530000	I don't know
1530000	1531000	Go for it
1531000	1532000	We'll have to decide
1532000	1533000	Rob if I really wanted
1533000	1534000	A gold Atari 2600
1534000	1535000	I would go find one of ours
1535000	1536000	And get a can of
1536000	1537000	Rustoleum
1537000	1538000	And the meaning behind it
1538000	1539000	It doesn't mean it the same
1539000	1540000	When you do it that way
1540000	1541000	I know
1541000	1542000	But I'm just saying
1542000	1543000	We can give it to somebody
1543000	1544000	It will be just fine
1544000	1545000	Well I'll tell you right now
1545000	1546000	The way the leaderboards look
1546000	1547000	We ain't gonna get it
1547000	1548000	We are in second place
1548000	1549000	But we're gonna win
1549000	1550000	A gold 32X
1550000	1551000	But we are way behind
1551000	1552000	Dead Pixel Live
1552000	1554000	Dead Pixel Live has 164 points
1554000	1555000	We have 42
1555000	1557000	Which has us in second place
1557000	1558000	Now how many things
1558000	1560000	Have already completed already?
1560000	1561000	Uh
1561000	1562000	I think three
1562000	1563000	But there's still more
1563000	1564000	Going on right now
1564000	1565000	But let me
1565000	1566000	You know
1566000	1567000	It got off to a little
1567000	1568000	Bit of a slow start
1568000	1569000	The whole thing started
1569000	1570000	Right when E3 was going on
1570000	1571000	And then you know
1571000	1573000	My birthday and the 4th
1573000	1574000	Were all in there
1574000	1575000	You know
1575000	1576000	It took a little while
1576000	1577000	I think for us to
1577000	1578000	Kind of really get in there
1578000	1579000	But there's more games
1579000	1580000	Happening
1580000	1581000	And I think a lot of the
1581000	1582000	Early feedback we got was
1582000	1583000	You know
1583000	1584000	I don't have Solnarex
1584000	1585000	And I don't really have
1585000	1586000	The pinball game
1586000	1587000	So what's there for me to play?
1587000	1588000	Derek's been very open to
1588000	1590000	Putting stuff in there
1590000	1591000	So I can tell you
1591000	1592000	And it looks like
1592000	1593000	It's scheduled now
1593000	1594000	I didn't even know
1594000	1595000	It got a date
1595000	1596000	On August 1st
1596000	1598000	Super Street Fighter 4
1598000	1600000	Now I know tons of bitches
1600000	1601000	Have that game
1601000	1602000	I'll make Dan play
1602000	1603000	And can represent
1603000	1604000	Get Dan to sign up
1604000	1605000	At TheBigBattle.net
1605000	1606000	And represent the OLR
1606000	1607000	Because seriously
1607000	1608000	If we lose
1608000	1610000	Super Street Fighter 4
1610000	1611000	Or we don't have
1611000	1612000	Good representation
1612000	1613000	Super Street Fighter 4
1613000	1614000	We're just going to kiss
1614000	1615000	That gold Atari thing goodbye
1615000	1616000	Because it ain't happening
1616000	1617000	Like this is a game
1617000	1618000	That I know we can do
1618000	1619000	Well at
1619000	1620000	I'll blame everybody personally
1620000	1621000	So yes
1621000	1622000	I will be
1622000	1624000	Blaming certain individuals
1624000	1625000	That are very very good
1625000	1626000	At Super Street Fighter
1626000	1627000	If you don't participate in this
1627000	1629000	Unless you have a really good reason
1629000	1631000	I will blame you personally
1631000	1632000	But it's yeah
1632000	1633000	TheBigBattle.net
1633000	1636000	And it's August 1st
1636000	1637000	And sign up and participate
1637000	1638000	But there are other games
1638000	1639000	If you're not a Street Fighter person
1639000	1641000	Forza's going on right now
1641000	1642000	And I wonder if we have people
1642000	1643000	In Forza
1643000	1644000	Like I'll tell you this
1644000	1645000	So far
1645000	1646000	We can really thank

1649000	1650000	Like he got us 7 points
1650000	1651000	On Zen Pinball
1651000	1652000	And he got us
1652000	1653000	Another 7 points
1653000	1654000	On Pinball FX
1654000	1657000	I got us like 4 on one
1657000	1659000	And 3 on the other
1659000	1660000	And let's see
1660000	1661000	We actually have Monty Boggs
1661000	1662000	Participated

1717000	1718000	Is also happening
1718000	1719000	So there it
1719000	1720000	Big Battle
1720000	1721000	In chat
1722000	1723000	DarkTetsuya
1723000	1725000	Says
1725000	1726000	I thought
1726000	1727000	I heard a rumor
1727000	1728000	There going to
1728000	1729000	It an upcoming
1729000	1730000	I heard
1730000	1731000	meaning
1731000	1734000	That
1734000	1736000	In the
1736000	1737000	There ya go
1737000	1740000	Other housekeeping I wanted to get to tonight.
1740000	1743000	I want to talk about the feed.
1743000	1747000	Most people shouldn't notice this, but the podcast feed actually moved
1747000	1750000	this past week and I want to take a minute to thank
1750000	1754000	Dekeman and Jason, VX JasonXV,
1754000	1757000	who do a lot of work on our website. And I'll tell you, like, Dekeman,
1757000	1760000	he kind of did this whole thing where he moved our podcast
1760000	1763000	and he's doing it so that way when we, usually when I post
1763000	1766000	a show, it takes like 24 hours for it to show up on the website
1766000	1769000	because someone has to go in there manually and do it, but that won't
1769000	1772000	happen anymore. Like, when I post a show, it will be instant.
1772000	1775000	So, most people are going to be able to get their shows faster and that's going to be
1775000	1778000	really good news. So,
1778000	1781000	yeah, I'm hoping nobody notices
1781000	1784000	the differences, but if you do,
1784000	1787000	just sit tight while we are under construction
1787000	1790000	a little bit. But I'm hoping if you're listening to this show
1790000	1793000	and you're on the podcast feed, then clearly your
1793000	1796000	feed player and all that updated and noticed the change
1796000	1799000	just fine. You don't need to do a darn thing. And for those
1799000	1802000	that did not move, Jason was kind enough to
1802000	1805000	record like a little special message that will show up over there
1805000	1808000	for those folks that know they have to resubscribe. So, I'm hoping
1808000	1811000	that is all better and all that good stuff now.
1811000	1814000	So, that's just some maintenance going on on the website. And also,
1814000	1817000	an excuse for me to thank the guys that make it happen, Dekeman
1817000	1820000	and VX JasonXV. Like, Dekeman put together this whole little, like, training manual.
1820000	1823000	Like, here's how you post to the website. Step one, dah dah dah.
1823000	1826000	It's like the type of thing I do at my day job. And we pay him
1826000	1829000	nothing because we have nothing. So,
1829000	1832000	it's very much appreciated by all of
1832000	1835000	us, as all of you listening should appreciate it too.
1835000	1838000	How about some actual bonafide gaming news now?
1838000	1841000	Are we ready? Thirty minutes into the show, we're going to touch on some gaming news.
1841000	1844000	Loki, what is going on in the world of PlayStation?
1844000	1847000	Absolutely nothing. No, just kidding.
1847000	1850000	Actually, in September, there will be some stuff going on,
1850000	1853000	including the 3D Blu-ray support,
1853000	1856000	which will basically turn your PS3 into not only
1856000	1859000	a Blu-ray player, but a 3D Blu-ray player.
1859000	1862000	And as of right now, I believe there is only one
1862000	1865000	3D Blu-ray movie out there. So, if you're looking
1865000	1868000	to see Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs in 3D,
1868000	1871000	you can do that now. Assuming, of course, that you have a 3D TV.
1871000	1874000	But why wouldn't you have a 3D TV if you have
1874000	1877000	that movie?
1877000	1880000	And then, of course, with that, there's also going to be some...
1880000	1883000	Wait, wait, isn't the regular Blu-ray just happen to be
1883000	1886000	regular and 3D? I don't think you buy a special
1886000	1889000	3D Blu-ray. So you could own the movie
1889000	1892000	and just not have a 3D TV because they're kind of pricey right now, right?
1892000	1895000	No, I do believe that it's actually a different movie.
1895000	1898000	It's a 3D Blu-ray. Wow. Wow, I didn't even know that existed.
1898000	1901000	The regular movie, you can watch with the
1901000	1904000	glasses, the magenta,
1904000	1907000	cyan, or the red-blue stuff.
1907000	1910000	But, no, this actually requires
1910000	1913000	a special... You have to buy your movies all over again, yes.
1913000	1916000	Just in case you thought, you know, Blu-ray
1916000	1919000	was enough. If you want them in 3D, you gotta buy them again.
1919000	1922000	Oh, great. Because it's, you know,
1922000	1925000	Mark Smith of that way. Also, there's gonna be
1925000	1928000	some additional support for, apparently,
1928000	1931000	Play TV in Europe is gonna
1931000	1934000	be in 3D as well. Different broadcasts through that,
1934000	1937000	as well as YouTube supporting 3D content
1937000	1940000	over the next 12 months as well. So there'll be
1940000	1943000	3D YouTube stuff. Which...
1943000	1946000	begs the question, and this is my
1946000	1949000	thing. Why?
1949000	1952000	That'd be the second question. Why? The first question is,
1952000	1955000	I understand, okay, YouTube, okay, great, we've got
1955000	1958000	3D YouTube, but...
1958000	1961000	as far as I'm aware, there's not really 3D film camera. Like,
1961000	1964000	I can't go out there and buy a camera that shoots
1964000	1967000	in 3D. Yet. Well, YouTube
1967000	1970000	isn't just underground stuff right now, you know?
1970000	1973000	Like, there's a lot of big studios who use YouTube to push
1973000	1976000	their stuff. I understand that, but, you know,
1976000	1979000	I'm not gonna be able to see, you know,
1979000	1982000	some viral video or something like that,
1982000	1985000	you know, in 3D normally. And...
1985000	1988000	why? Like you said,
1988000	1991000	why bother? It's because...
1991000	1994000	This 3D thing is happening too fast for me. But you know
1994000	1997000	why that they're pushing it? Why? It's because Sony is
1997000	2000000	selling 3D TVs. And Sony
2000000	2003000	has movies, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,
2003000	2006000	that happen to be in 3D Blu-ray. They figure,
2006000	2009000	hey, look! Look what we did for Blu-ray already!
2009000	2012000	We beat HD DVDs! Now we can convince
2012000	2015000	people to buy 3D Blu-ray! So they're kinda like riding on a high
2015000	2018000	right now, like they own everything? They're basically thinking, you know what,
2018000	2021000	yeah, we may have fucked up UMD,
2021000	2024000	but hey, we won in Blu-ray, and now we're gonna try our
2024000	2027000	hands at 3D Blu-ray. It'll print money!
2027000	2030000	But I have the... Here's my thing though, is people,
2030000	2033000	some people, not even all
2033000	2036000	people nowadays, are willing to make the jump to Blu-ray
2036000	2039000	because the picture quality is pretty good
2039000	2042000	compared to the DVD. But
2042000	2045000	those people probably just bought HDTVs.
2045000	2048000	Those same people are not gonna go, oh, well
2048000	2051000	I need to throw away my HDTV, I just bought and buy
2051000	2054000	a really expensive 3D HDTV with
2054000	2057000	really expensive 3D glasses to go with that. Because
2057000	2060000	I'm a consumer whore. Most people will not
2060000	2063000	do that. And so, yes, it is a bit
2063000	2066000	early. It's why you're not seeing, you know, Microsoft jumping
2066000	2069000	on the bandwagon with this stuff, because it's way too damn early.
2069000	2072000	You don't need to be putting out 3D games because
2072000	2075000	most people don't have the hardware to play them.
2075000	2078000	Going to chat.thatorangehonestready.com and some comments there, TigerClaw
2078000	2081000	says, if the studios have their way, they will release the regular
2081000	2084000	Blu-ray version, then a couple months later, the 3D version.
2084000	2087000	The 3D version of Avatar won't be out until 2011, and right now
2087000	2090000	they're planning on re-releasing the movie back in IMAX theaters
2090000	2093000	as a special edition with eight minutes of extra footage.
2093000	2096000	Because, you know, it is THE 3D movie.
2096000	2099000	But here's the funny part about that. The whole reason they are
2099000	2102000	doing a lot of 3D in theaters now is to get people back into
2102000	2105000	the movie theaters to watch these 3D movies. If you have the
2105000	2108000	technology at home, thank you, you know, Sony and
2108000	2111000	all these guys, you're basically just shooting the
2111000	2114000	theaters all over again, because now what are they going to do? Well,
2114000	2117000	I'm not going to the theater to watch an expensive Blu-ray, you know, 3D movie.
2117000	2120000	I can watch those 3D movies at home. And how many people remember this
2120000	2123000	particular parallel happening in the video gaming industry?
2123000	2126000	When, basically, you could get a Dreamcast, which
2126000	2129000	basically ran things like a NAOMI system back
2129000	2132000	in the day. It's just a matter of
2132000	2135000	consumer technology bypassing the mass
2135000	2138000	technology. What comes down to is, really,
2138000	2141000	Sony doesn't give a crap about movie theaters, because
2141000	2144000	they don't own movie theaters. They sell movies to these
2144000	2147000	movie theaters, and they could care less if their technology
2147000	2150000	is going to impede on their business.
2150000	2152000	Can I just say this real quick, because I think Dark
2152000	2155000	Soccer makes a good point, is that I think things like the
2155000	2158000	3DO and the CDI come to mind, those
2158000	2161000	things kind of, to me, feel like they were a little ahead of their time.
2161000	2164000	And the technology was really cool,
2164000	2167000	but the games were kind of crap and too much money.
2167000	2170000	You know what I mean?
2170000	2173000	I think a lot of that stuff was really ahead of
2173000	2176000	its time. I think all this stuff is a little too
2176000	2179000	soon as well. We've got other people in chat saying,
2179000	2182000	Katsune in our chat room, yeah, I just got my HDTV,
2182000	2185000	I'm not going to get a 3D TV anytime soon. Probably never.
2185000	2188000	And Miyamoto also thinks the 3D thing is happening too soon.
2188000	2191000	But see, the 3DS, I'm a lot cooler with
2191000	2194000	that, because, let me tell you the best thing about the 3DS.
2194000	2197000	There's a little lever on the right side, and when you get sick of 3D, you just
2197000	2200000	turn it down, it goes off. Ta-da!
2200000	2203000	The difference between the 3DS and the
2203000	2206000	PlayStation 3, the PlayStation 3 to see 3D,
2206000	2209000	it requires you to buy a bunch of additional hardware.
2209000	2212000	Glasses that are really expensive.
2212000	2215000	The TV that's really expensive.
2215000	2218000	The 3DS, you turn it on.
2218000	2221000	And you see 3D. And if you don't want to see 3D, you turn
2221000	2224000	the little slider down. And the great thing about that too
2224000	2227000	is if games, say for example, don't want to use 3D,
2227000	2230000	but they want to have a really high resolution, well
2230000	2233000	not really high resolution, but a pretty high resolution screen,
2233000	2236000	they could do that because now the amount of pixels
2236000	2239000	that are on the second screen are nearly doubled, and it's widescreen.
2239000	2242000	So you could do pseudo HD type stuff on there
2242000	2245000	if you want to.
2245000	2248000	And at the same time, I guess, Sony
2248000	2251000	on their games, they're also limiting the use of
2251000	2254000	1080p 3D in PlayStation 3 games.
2254000	2257000	Apparently, Sony's official guidelines
2257000	2260000	for 3D gaming on the PS3 limit
2260000	2263000	the displayed image to a resolution of 720p.
2263000	2266000	Even games that run natively at
2266000	2269000	1080p, like Super Stardust HD, are
2269000	2272000	downscaled to 3D mode to two 720p
2272000	2275000	images, one for each eye.
2275000	2278000	And I'm guessing this is because
2278000	2281000	the PS3 probably just can't handle that amount
2281000	2284000	of data going through there.
2284000	2287000	It says it will support 3D Blu-ray movies at that
2287000	2290000	resolution, 1080p,
2290000	2293000	later this year, but
2293000	2296000	upping the resolution
2296000	2299000	to
2299000	2302000	1080p also expenses the
2302000	2305000	60 frames per second. So for example,
2305000	2308000	Blu-ray movies run at
2308000	2311000	4 frames per second.
2311000	2314000	I don't know.
2314000	2317000	It's interesting. Honestly, with resolution
2317000	2320000	and stuff like that, I don't really think it matters. I mean, if you're looking at
2320000	2323000	high def in 3D, it's not gonna matter. It's gonna look cool.
2323000	2326000	Whether it's 1080p or 720p.
2326000	2329000	I mean, when you have the glasses on, you don't really give a shit. You're like,
2329000	2332000	oh damn, this is just horrible in this 720p.
2332000	2335000	What am I, like, a peasant here?
2335000	2338000	This is ridiculous.
2338000	2341000	It's not enough pay for me. I need my pay.
2341000	2344000	So,
2344000	2347000	one thing though,
2347000	2350000	kind of going back to this, that I had to laugh about,
2350000	2353000	and this isn't even really the 3D stuff, but it just
2353000	2356000	kind of stuck out to me in my mind during the Sony
2356000	2359000	press conference, because it made no sense to me as far as
2359000	2362000	as an actual feature that you would advertise to your
2362000	2365000	customers. One of the things that they said regarding the PlayStation
2365000	2368000	Move is like, because
2368000	2371000	you can only do this on the Sony PlayStation 3,
2371000	2374000	because we use Blu-ray technology, Blu-ray technology
2374000	2377000	will allow us to put both the
2377000	2380000	regular version of the game and the Move version of the game
2380000	2383000	on the same disc. And that was
2383000	2386000	a feature that they threw out there. And I'm like,
2386000	2389000	I've never seen people
2389000	2392000	not able to put, you know, two different control schemes
2392000	2395000	on one disc before because of disc space. Oh my god,
2395000	2398000	we can't fit. Why would you even put a separate
2398000	2401000	copy of the game on the disc? That's a little redundant if you ask me.
2401000	2404000	I'm trying to think. I think you could go back like
2404000	2407000	15 years to the Super Nintendo
2407000	2410000	and a game called King Arthur something
2410000	2413000	that had the mouse. It was one of the few third-party games that supported the mouse.
2413000	2416000	But you know what, you could also use a controller. Oh my god,
2416000	2419000	two different control schemes on one cartridge.
2419000	2422000	The only game, or only games
2422000	2425000	I guess that I would say that had two different control schemes,
2425000	2428000	and because they were, you know, released later on,
2428000	2431000	would be those new play control games because they had the Wii remote.
2431000	2434000	But that was added later and that does not count. I mean, that is not
2434000	2437000	something that they released. That was the equivalent of re-releasing
2437000	2440000	the same movie on Blu-ray 3D. Yeah, exactly.
2440000	2443000	And I'm sorry, but
2443000	2446000	nobody is making that argument, oh well, you know,
2446000	2449000	you're gonna have to buy a separate version of Halo 4,
2449000	2452000	the Kinect version, because we just can't fit it on those
2452000	2455000	pesky DVDs. We have to create a whole other game.
2455000	2458000	That's just stupid.
2458000	2461000	Going to another little side conversation in our chatroom,
2461000	2464000	SSJ100Matt is saying, do we really need 3D?
2464000	2467000	And some of the response is, no, no, no. It's a stupid gimmick.
2467000	2470000	Well, and then the other thing if you want to
2470000	2473000	know, 3D is obviously taking away some sort of processing
2473000	2476000	power from, you know, your games.
2476000	2479000	So, they're gonna have to make the games
2479000	2482000	slightly less, you know, elaborate
2482000	2485000	in order to, you know, allow you to do this 3D stuff.
2485000	2488000	Now granted, they're gonna have 3D in like Killzone 3 and I'm sure
2488000	2491000	that's gonna look amazing, but, I mean,
2491000	2494000	is that gonna really affect the performance of the game?
2494000	2497000	Is what I want to know because they're not adding any additional
2497000	2500000	hardware to, you know, run this 3D stuff. It's just basically
2500000	2503000	data going through them and if they're having to process twice as much data,
2503000	2506000	one for each eye, then you gotta
2506000	2509000	think that that's got a bottleneck somewhere.
2509000	2512000	I just don't think I've ever really experienced 3D
2512000	2515000	where it was like, oh my god, blow my hair back, amazing, like,
2515000	2518000	this is just, like when I went and saw Avatar in 3D,
2518000	2521000	I was like, okay, this is cool, but I probably would've
2521000	2524000	liked the movie just the same in 2D. I wasn't like,
2524000	2527000	oh my god, 3D was just everything,
2527000	2530000	I was moved to tears, it was better than having my dick sucked,
2530000	2533000	it was amazing, ah, you know, it just wasn't
2533000	2536000	that great, you know?
2536000	2539000	3D was not necessary. I thought it was, I thought it
2539000	2542000	actually added a very good dimension to the movie, but that was, you know,
2542000	2545000	It was neat, but it, wait, you wouldn't have felt the same way about the movie
2545000	2548000	in 2D? I probably would've liked it, but if I had seen them
2548000	2551000	both side by side, my preference would go to the 3D.
2551000	2554000	It's just, if it's gonna cost this much money to upgrade
2554000	2557000	right now too, like, it has to be, like, truly, truly amazing.
2557000	2560000	Well, it's not cost effective right now. I mean, it's
2560000	2563000	by no means cost effective. And just wait anyways, because
2563000	2566000	it's only a matter of, like, years before holograms, and then you're gonna have to buy
2566000	2569000	your hologram TV, and one step closer to the holodeck,
2569000	2572000	as we always say, that's gaming's ultimate goal, is the holodeck
2572000	2575000	from Star Trek The Next Generation. Everything
2575000	2578000	is just one step closer to the holodeck.
2578000	2581000	I have a holodeck in my backyard. Frisbee says, question,
2581000	2584000	all games suggest that you take a 15 minute break after one hour
2584000	2587000	of playing. How many people will hurt their eyes with this 3D stuff?
2587000	2590000	I'm kinda curious what the safety manual and
2590000	2593000	disclaimers are gonna look like on the 3DS. I'm very curious about that.
2593000	2596000	Don't play for more than 5 seconds. Well, here's
2596000	2599000	the best part about the 3DS. If it starts bugging your eyes,
2599000	2602000	there's a little slider to turn the 3D off.
2602000	2605000	Oh my god. And that's awesome. One
2605000	2608000	of the comments I wanted to read, S.J. 100 Matt in our chatroom said,
2608000	2611000	give it five years, maybe there will be enough support for it. Right now, there's
2611000	2614000	nothing worthwhile. It's all James Cameron's fault.
2614000	2617000	Maybe that stupid rant he had in E3 2009 actually meant
2617000	2620000	something. I don't remember that rant, but apparently he got up on stage
2620000	2623000	and talked kind of about, you know, the 3D stuff.
2623000	2626000	Just, we weren't ready for it. We're not ready to handle it.
2626000	2629000	Although it's kinda- You can't handle that extra D.
2629000	2632000	You can't handle the truth. But look at, okay, look at 3D
2632000	2635000	and what it's done so far to cinema. I mean,
2635000	2638000	we're getting a lot of gimmicky movies. And they-
2638000	2641000	We got a lot of gimmicky movies back when, you know,
2641000	2644000	the red-blue-glass 3D was really popular.
2644000	2647000	Just a lot of, like,
2647000	2650000	you know, Final Destination in 3D.
2650000	2653000	Oh, look at the head flew towards me. You know, Saw
2653000	2656000	in 3D. Oh, look at the head flying towards me.
2656000	2659000	You know, it's Jaws in 3D.
2659000	2662000	Oh, look at the head flying towards me. I mean, it's just, it's basically
2662000	2665000	the same stuff over and over. And a lot of these movies
2665000	2668000	that don't necessarily need 3D, like Clash of the Titans,
2668000	2671000	have the 3D tacked onto it and it looks like shit.
2671000	2674000	So, you know, take that, you know, and add that
2674000	2677000	to, like, say, games, and now you're gonna get 3D games that look like shit.
2677000	2680000	It just occurred to me, I thought of something
2680000	2683000	that was Blow My Hair Back Amazing
2683000	2686000	3D experience, that 3D was
2686000	2689000	intricate and necessary to the presentation that would not have been the same
2689000	2692000	without it. Captain EO.
2692000	2695000	I was thinking the same thing. Well, and remember that seventh
2695000	2698000	portal thing, the Marvel thing at Great America?
2698000	2701000	Those rides that are like that.
2701000	2704000	The Muppet Show. Captain EO, really.
2704000	2707000	Captain EO was first, and Captain EO was, what, 1985?
2707000	2710000	86? Yeah.
2710000	2713000	When Captain EO comes out
2713000	2716000	on these 3D TVs, wake me up.
2716000	2719000	Then maybe I'm ready for 3D TVs.
2719000	2722000	In the meantime, let's move on to something else that's
2722000	2725000	completely unnecessary. Yeah, I know they did a Captain EO game.
2725000	2728000	That's what the Michael Jackson game should be.
2728000	2731000	None of this, like, imitates his dance moves. I don't give a shit about that.
2731000	2734000	Yeah, just build that stuff in a dance. Captain EO and
2734000	2737000	Michael Jackson Moonwalker 2. Amazing.
2737000	2740000	Moonwalker HD.
2740000	2743000	SSJ-100 Matt says your other answer is Lawnmower Man.
2746000	2749000	Remember when Virtual Reality was like the big
2749000	2752000	Virtual Reality.
2752000	2755000	They tried. And stock footage of all the Mind's Eye stuff.
2755000	2758000	Ooh, that was really cool.
2758000	2761000	Yeah, I remember back in the day when Virtual Reality stuff was
2761000	2764000	really big. God, we were stupid back then.
2764000	2767000	Alright, speaking of things that are completely
2767000	2770000	useless and unnecessary, Real ID.
2770000	2773000	I had to do that. That's a fantastic tie-in, Rob.
2773000	2776000	I'm very proud of you. 3 weeks in a row I'm talking about this.
2776000	2779000	And look, again, I'm going to say this. I know a lot of you could give two shits
2779000	2782000	about World of Warcraft, but this is important because where Blizzard
2782000	2785000	goes, other companies will inevitably follow.
2785000	2788000	I'm going to keep it brief this week. There's two quick things that happen to Real ID
2788000	2791000	that are newsworthy and necessary to cover.
2791000	2794000	First off, this is kind of one of those, like,
2794000	2797000	part of it's really funny and the other part is
2797000	2800000	actually not funny at all. And that is that, you know,
2800000	2803000	a bunch of people when this Real ID, and going back to when they
2803000	2806000	Blizzard was saying, oh, we're going to post
2806000	2809000	your real name to the forum whenever you want to make a
2809000	2812000	post, right? Remember that whole thing they had to retract last week?
2812000	2815000	Well, a lot of people complained to the ESRB.
2815000	2818000	And a lot of people wrote them and said, this game is violating our privacy.
2818000	2821000	You should go back and re-rate this game.
2821000	2824000	Kind of like trying to get at them that way. Well, the ESRB sent
2824000	2827000	an apology letter. Well, not really an apology letter, but they sent out
2827000	2830000	a letter of resolution basically saying, thank you
2830000	2833000	for contacting us. Your concerns were legit.
2833000	2836000	It's our understanding that Blizzard provided an update announcing
2836000	2839000	they're not going to do it, so we're closing your request.
2839000	2842000	Just kind of one of those, like, you know, hey, we appreciate
2842000	2845000	your concern, but, you know, it's kind of done
2845000	2848000	with now, right? But we wanted to follow up with you anyway.
2848000	2851000	Well, here's the part about it that really
2851000	2854000	sucks. All of the people that wrote in
2854000	2857000	to complain, yeah, all of their names
2857000	2860000	and email addresses were in the to field.
2860000	2863000	Because somebody didn't think, oh, I should put those in the
2863000	2866000	BCC field. So all
2866000	2869000	of the people who complained had their
2869000	2872000	email addresses exposed.
2872000	2875000	Oh, they're going to sue.
2875000	2878000	And now granted, ESRB wrote
2878000	2881000	an apology, like, not even 24 hours later.
2881000	2884000	They sent out an apology that, and the nice thing was
2884000	2887000	they kind of addressed the irony. They didn't try to beat around the bush.
2887000	2890000	They did say in their apology, the fact that our message
2890000	2893000	addressed an individual's concerns with respect to their privacy
2893000	2896000	underscores how truly disappointing a mistake this was on our part.
2896000	2899000	We work with companies to ensure they are handling people's private
2899000	2902000	information with confidentiality, care, and respect. It is only
2902000	2905000	right that we set a good example and do no levs ourselves.
2905000	2908000	So at least they didn't try to give you a BS corporate answer.
2908000	2911000	Well, I mean, to some extent. It was a little washed out.
2911000	2914000	You know when they said they were like, aw, crap.
2914000	2917000	Well, first off, you know an intern did this.
2917000	2920000	And secondly, when he hit the send button, you know he went,
2920000	2923000	aw, fuck.
2923000	2926000	I'm going home. I gotta go home.
2926000	2929000	Please don't crap on interns. I'm planning on being an intern. I am an intern.
2929000	2932000	I'm just saying. It's not that I'm crapping on interns.
2932000	2935000	Rob, an intern designed the FedEx logo.
2935000	2938000	Okay. The Federal Express logo or the FedEx logo?
2938000	2941000	The FedEx logo.
2941000	2944000	It's clever. Regardless of whether it was an intern
2944000	2947000	or the CEO, you know after clicking the send button,
2947000	2950000	they went, aw, fuck.
2950000	2953000	The FedEx logo, all that is is just the Federal Express logo.
2953000	2956000	They just dropped it down the FedEx like Bevmo.
2956000	2959000	The E and the X make an arrow.
2959000	2962000	That's very clever.
2962000	2965000	Alright, look. Just drop it. It was a mistake on their part.
2965000	2968000	They apologized for it, but it's just one of those
2968000	2971000	moments where you just cover your face with your palm
2971000	2974000	and shake your head. Anyhow, there's more
2974000	2977000	in the Real ID saga. And this is important
2977000	2980000	because after all the ranting I've done in previous episodes,
2980000	2983000	if Blizzard's gonna come out and say, oops, we made a mistake.
2983000	2986000	I think it should be acknowledged. And to some extent,
2986000	2989000	that's what's happened this week. Nathera, who's one of the
2989000	2992000	community managers, did post on the official WoW forums
2992000	2995000	about some Real ID follow-ups. One,
2995000	2998000	my biggest complaint about the system as it was, the Friends of Friends
2998000	3001000	feature. She went on to say,
3001000	3004000	they've been evaluating how Real ID has been used since its release
3004000	3007000	to identify the new functionality that will help improve our players' experience, blah blah blah.
3007000	3010000	The in-game Real ID Friends of Friends list is designed
3010000	3013000	to give players a convenient way to populate the Real ID Friends list,
3013000	3016000	blah blah blah, corporate speak corporate speak. Oh, however,
3016000	3019000	we recognize that some players would prefer not to be displayed on Friends
3019000	3022000	lists in this fashion, so we plan to include an option
3022000	3025000	that will allow players to opt out of appearing on
3025000	3028000	their Real ID Friends, Friends of Friends list.
3028000	3031000	This should be ready by the first StarCraft 2 patch.
3031000	3034000	Yay!
3034000	3037000	Yay, someone knocked some sense into Blizzard.
3037000	3040000	But, I'm not totally over this yet.
3040000	3043000	Am I to the point now where my number one concern
3043000	3046000	with Real ID was addressed? Yes.
3046000	3049000	But, I still get a little nervous
3049000	3052000	because remember last week we had that story about the one
3052000	3055000	line of code that would show your real name out there?
3055000	3058000	Now, yes, it was hotfix, blah blah blah, but the fact that it existed
3058000	3061000	in the first place, that still kind of makes me nervous.
3061000	3064000	And I think I have a right to question,
3064000	3067000	just where the hell is Blizzard going with all this?
3067000	3070000	And an awesome point that was brought up to me today
3070000	3073000	was Blizzard hasn't said anything about their next MMO yet.
3073000	3076000	And we're anticipating that we're going to be hearing a lot about it
3076000	3079000	at Blizzcon this year.
3079000	3082000	And after all this mess of the past few months
3082000	3085000	and Real ID and this whole trying to get closer and closer
3085000	3088000	into bed with Facebook, I'm kind of really
3088000	3091000	concerned about what Blizzard has planned for their next MMO.
3091000	3094000	FaceCraft?
3094000	3097000	Blizzard goes on to say,
3097000	3100000	what are your plans for Facebook integration?
3100000	3103000	With regard to Facebook, our goal is to help Blizzard gamers on Battle.net
3103000	3106000	more easily connect to their real life friends and family.
3106000	3109000	For the launch of Starcraft 2, we are introducing an optional
3109000	3112000	Facebook friend finder feature to help achieve this goal.
3112000	3115000	The friend finder enables players who decide to use it
3115000	3118000	to easily populate their Battle.net friends list
3118000	3121000	by sending Real ID friend requests to the people on their
3121000	3124000	Facebook friends list who have Battle.net accounts.
3124000	3127000	We hope players will find this feature convenient, but it's completely optional,
3127000	3130000	blah blah blah blah blah. So in other words, you can
3130000	3133000	now, if you want to go onto
3133000	3136000	Facebook and pull all of your friends' Real IDs
3136000	3139000	from your Facebook, you can do that, I think is what they're saying?
3139000	3142000	This way people in China
3142000	3145000	that may have to leave their game
3145000	3148000	to visit friends and family
3148000	3151000	don't have to do that. They can sit there and play their games.
3151000	3154000	I do not like this direction that Blizzard
3154000	3157000	is going. They are a gaming company. Stop trying to be
3157000	3160000	a social network. Throughout all of this,
3160000	3163000	what they really should have learned,
3163000	3166000	they really need to sit down
3166000	3169000	in a meeting. They need to come into the office Monday morning,
3169000	3172000	sit down in a meeting, and I feel like I can speak
3172000	3175000	to this with some authority. And stop sniffing glue? Well, that's
3175000	3178000	the first place. But I've been a corporate trainer for the past
3178000	3181000	seven years. I sometimes have to facilitate
3181000	3184000	meetings like this. I think these guys
3184000	3187000	should come in, sit down, and really ask
3187000	3190000	themselves, why are we here?
3190000	3193000	What is the goal of our company? Why do people
3193000	3196000	pay us $15 a month? To make money.
3196000	3199000	That's all they're in for the money.
3199000	3202000	Do they pay us $15 a month so that they can
3202000	3205000	have their real life be reminded
3205000	3208000	of their real life and their Facebook friends and all this all the time?
3208000	3211000	No. People pay $15 a month to escape the real world
3211000	3214000	and slay internet dragons. That is why they pay the money.
3214000	3217000	Are people leaving the game in droves because of this? No.
3217000	3220000	I don't think they are.
3220000	3223000	Boy, when that announcement went out, yes they did. There was lots of people
3223000	3226000	that posted screenshots, said they were leaving,
3226000	3229000	etc.
3229000	3232000	Oh, I'm going to boycott Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.
3232000	3235000	Oh, I'm going to boycott Left 4 Dead 2.
3235000	3238000	Just like all these people. What they're going to do is wait for them
3238000	3241000	to say the magic words,
3241000	3244000	and then they'll come right back and then they'll get screwed again.
3244000	3247000	Salacious Pop says this beautifully.
3247000	3250000	If they are already a real life friend, I know where they are
3250000	3253000	because I've met them. If I want to be on their Facebook,
3253000	3256000	call and ask. Perfect.
3256000	3259000	You know what? From here on out,
3259000	3262000	until Blizzard has decided that they are
3262000	3265000	not going to get into bed with Facebook so much anymore
3265000	3268000	and keep sucking their dick as they've been so much recently,
3268000	3271000	until Blizzard comes out and says,
3271000	3274000	we are games first, I'm going to be referring to
3274000	3277000	Blizzard as Blizzinga, because that is what they are.
3277000	3280000	They are Blizzard meets Zynga.
3280000	3283000	So, Blizzinga from here on out.
3283000	3286000	When I say that on the show, you know who I'm talking about.
3286000	3289000	But until they have decided, you know what, we are a gaming company first
3289000	3292000	and maybe we should not try to get so much into
3292000	3295000	the social network stuff or push it down everybody's throats
3295000	3298000	as hard as we've been, they are Blizzinga.
3298000	3301000	And Blizzinga needs to take a cue
3301000	3304000	from Xbox Live,
3304000	3307000	because I think it's one of the things that Microsoft has done very, very well
3307000	3310000	and the great thing about Xbox Live, it does have that
3310000	3313000	community feeling, you have achievements and messages
3313000	3316000	and you have that Facebook integration if you want it
3316000	3319000	and you can find Facebook friends if you want to.
3319000	3322000	It's done right on Xbox Live, I think.
3322000	3325000	I don't understand why they make it like you can't
3325000	3328000	like all of a sudden I have to find my friends out there.
3328000	3331000	I mean, there's so many social networking sites out there right now.
3331000	3334000	Twitter, Facebook, MySpace if you're still using it
3334000	3337000	and a whole bunch of other sites and games that do this.
3337000	3341000	Why do I need their help in connecting with my friends?
3341000	3344000	I've already connected with my friends probably a dozen times now.
3344000	3348000	And there is still the phone, there's still mail,
3348000	3354000	there's still email, there's still a bunch of other ways to talk to your friends.
3354000	3357000	I just don't understand, it's like, oh my god,
3357000	3360000	I'm cut off from the rest of the world unless
3360000	3363000	I use Blizzard to connect with my friends.
3363000	3367000	Let's see here, Tigerclaw in our chat room says,
3367000	3371000	Sky, maybe they should pull an apple and do a Q&A press conference lol.
3371000	3375000	Well that's why Blizzingacon 2010 this year is going to be awesome.
3375000	3378000	Because there are going to be some of those people that bought tickets
3378000	3381000	before all this shit happened that are going to the con.
3381000	3383000	Those developer Q&As are going to be awesome.
3383000	3388000	Like, I hate Blizzcon, like I kind of think it's kind of ridiculous
3388000	3392000	and I have zero interest in going and paying $150 to go to one company's E3 booth.
3392000	3395000	But look, this would be the year to go.
3395000	3399000	It's the point where I'm seriously considering getting the DirecTV feed
3399000	3403000	because those Q&A sessions are going to be awesome.
3403000	3408000	Angry nerds in the building with the developers who anger them.
3408000	3409000	They will not be angry.
3409000	3411000	Reality television show in the making.
3411000	3413000	They'll be drinking the Kool-Aid, they will be just...
3413000	3415000	Tables will be overturned.
3415000	3418000	They'll be taking it and they'll be like, hey look at this wheel we got for you.
3418000	3421000	And they'll be like, oh I forgive you for everything you've done.
3421000	3423000	That's so awesome.
3423000	3424000	Oh my God.
3424000	3427000	Unicycles now in World of Warcraft.
3427000	3429000	That's just the best thing ever.
3429000	3431000	People are sheep.
3431000	3432000	And you know what?
3432000	3436000	The people that follow Apple products, the people that follow Blizzard products
3436000	3441000	and countless other different brands out there that just eat up this shit
3441000	3443000	despite all the crap that they do.
3443000	3445000	They're going to still be playing the game.
3445000	3447000	They're still going to forgive them.
3447000	3448000	And you know what?
3448000	3451000	They leave for World of Warcraft, they'll come back for whatever the fuck
3451000	3455000	next MMO they've got because, oh Blizzard's fun.
3455000	3457000	I'll give them another try.
3457000	3459000	No one's going to...
3459000	3464000	No one really just up and just says, oh forget it.
3464000	3467000	I'm not dealing with them anymore until their next shiny thing comes out.
3467000	3469000	They're just going to be right back where they were before.
3469000	3473000	I will say that I have quit MMOs from principle.
3473000	3475000	So...
3475000	3476000	But...
3476000	3477000	Go ahead.
3477000	3478000	That's the person I am.
3478000	3480000	If I don't like something, I'm not going to put up with it.
3480000	3483000	But would you go back if your problem changed?
3483000	3484000	Probably not.
3484000	3485000	Really?
3485000	3486000	Probably not.
3486000	3487000	Well I mean...
3487000	3490000	It ended up getting a lot worse.
3490000	3494000	It was the whole crap with Ragnarok Online and just how stupid they were getting
3494000	3495000	and how...
3495000	3499000	What my problem was with them was them implementing the in-town raids.
3499000	3501000	And it got worse.
3501000	3505000	I had a list of grievances and they weren't doing anything so I quit.
3505000	3507000	I've got to read this comment from chat because I've been wanting to get it out there
3507000	3508000	and it has to do with the same topics.
3508000	3509000	So let's just pop in chat.
3509000	3512000	Chat.orangewormsready.com if you want to join us on this Sunday night.
3512000	3515000	It says, I don't think it's disingenuous for someone who boycotted something to come back
3515000	3517000	if the bad policy was lifted.
3517000	3520000	That just means you voted with your wallet and it worked so you came back.
3520000	3521000	I agree with him.
3521000	3522000	I agree.
3522000	3526000	This kind of reminds me though, SSJ100Matt says,
3526000	3529000	are you people still mad at Blizzard about no LAN support?
3529000	3530000	Blizzinga, please.
3530000	3531000	Blizzinga, whatever.
3531000	3532000	That's your thing, okay?
3532000	3534000	I'm not going to try to remember that because that's stupid.
3534000	3537000	Well, the name's stupid.
3537000	3539000	I'm just with the work on the name.
3539000	3542000	Well, because zinga are the people that make Farmville.
3542000	3543000	I understand that.
3543000	3545000	I get the reference.
3545000	3548000	We don't need to point more attention to them.
3548000	3554000	No, I was just saying that he brings out a perfect point
3554000	3558000	because they took out a feature that really pissed off everybody else
3558000	3560000	and they're like, oh, I'm boycotting the game.
3560000	3565000	How much you want to bet that Starcraft 2 sells millions of fucking copies
3565000	3569000	and it would be like as if that never happened,
3569000	3572000	as if those features were never removed,
3572000	3576000	that maybe the fans still bought it anyways
3576000	3578000	despite being pissed off at the company.
3578000	3582000	So you're basically saying never forget you were pissed about the LAN thing.
3582000	3584000	Never forget.
3584000	3586000	I've got more of those.
3586000	3589000	There was something else I saw earlier this week.
3589000	3595000	I guess we can talk about it real quick because it sort of ties in with Activision.
3595000	3597000	Real quick, because we've got to move on to more stories.
3597000	3598000	Real quick, I'm sorry.
3598000	3600000	There's another tangent I have to go on here.
3600000	3601000	Okay, real quick.
3601000	3606000	Remember how I brought up, and no one seemed to give a fucking shit about it,
3606000	3611000	remember I brought up that Activision is starting to price Wii games,
3611000	3614000	remember the Wii games usually are 50 bucks retail at the most,
3614000	3617000	for $60 retail for certain games
3617000	3620000	because they think that they should get some more money
3620000	3623000	because music licensing or whatever.
3623000	3625000	I forgot. Thank you for reminding me to never forget.
3625000	3628000	And I'm not saying that Activision is the only one to blame too
3628000	3630000	because Beel's Rock Band, same thing happened with that.
3630000	3634000	They were charging $60 for the Wii version of the game.
3634000	3635000	Well guess what?
3635000	3639000	It's been another year, no one's really complained, and it's happening again.
3639000	3642000	And guess what? It's not just happening now with music games,
3642000	3647000	but the new Tony Hawk game is also going to be $60 on the Wii.
3647000	3650000	Why? No one's going to buy it anyways,
3650000	3652000	and now you're giving them another reason not to buy it.
3652000	3657000	But also, Guitar Hero, Warriors of Rock, I'm sure DJ Hero 2,
3657000	3659000	those are all $60 price points.
3659000	3661000	You guys need to not forget this stuff
3661000	3663000	because they're going to start sneaking out more games like that.
3663000	3665000	And I know for me that's not a big deal
3665000	3667000	because I don't game that much on the Wii,
3667000	3669000	but for other people it might be a big deal.
3669000	3672000	And if you don't stop it here, they're just going to keep going.
3672000	3673000	What's going to stop them from saying,
3673000	3676000	oh, well now we're adding 3D into our 360 games?
3676000	3678000	They're going to be $70 retail.
3678000	3679000	Vote with your wallet.
3679000	3680000	Seriously, so...
3680000	3684000	I think we should make Loki's never forget a regular segment.
3684000	3688000	Ray Ayanami says he doesn't play any Blizzard game anyways.
3688000	3691000	You know, you may not play Starcraft 2 or Diablo 3 or this unannounced MMO,
3691000	3693000	but the reason why we spend so much time on it,
3693000	3695000	and I apologize, I know not everyone's into WoW,
3695000	3700000	but keep in mind, WoW is that behemoth of an RPG game right now anyway.
3700000	3704000	Where they go, a lot of the industry tends to follow.
3704000	3708000	Blizzard right now is the Rockefellers back in the day,
3708000	3710000	and you know what happened with them.
3710000	3713000	Go back and read a history book.
3713000	3716000	And this came up last week, and I think it's doubly true
3716000	3718000	after a lot of this Blizzard talk this week.
3718000	3720000	The WoW killer is WoW.
3720000	3723000	It's just a matter of when.
3723000	3725000	So anyhow, I will tell you what the WoW killer is not,
3725000	3729000	because I was reminded I didn't even mention this during my gaming week.
3729000	3732000	I played the Final Fantasy XIV beta this week.
3732000	3734000	I spent a little time with it.
3734000	3735000	This is my little tangent I wanted to get on,
3735000	3737000	because I forgot to mention this during my gaming week.
3737000	3739000	I played the Final Fantasy XIV beta on Tuesday.
3739000	3741000	I'm not sure if I'm actually supposed to be talking about it or not, but...
3741000	3742000	Who cares?
3742000	3743000	Who cares?
3743000	3747000	I'll tell you this, it's not my account, so I'm not under any NDA.
3747000	3748000	Ha ha ha.
3748000	3751000	So anyhow, I'm not going to tell you whose it is though.
3751000	3754000	I played the beta, and it's awful.
3754000	3756000	It is awful.
3756000	3762000	It is horrible, awful, laggy, not fun.
3762000	3765000	I'm not buying this game when it comes out if it's in this shape.
3765000	3768000	Granted, it's a beta, not a demo.
3768000	3771000	Betas are buggy, betas are slow.
3771000	3773000	But betas also are supposed to give me an impression, at least,
3773000	3776000	of what I'm to expect in the final product.
3776000	3780000	I got dumped into this world with no explanation
3780000	3783000	what I was supposed to do, where I'm supposed to go,
3783000	3787000	how you proceed, all these fancy big words of guild levs
3787000	3792000	and armethith crystals and these quests and all these things,
3792000	3796000	and I realized I could probably go online and figure it out,
3796000	3799000	but I thought the big thing about Final Fantasy XIV
3799000	3802000	was that it was supposed to be more accessible than Final Fantasy XI was.
3802000	3806000	It's not in its current shape.
3806000	3808000	This game is supposed to come out September 30th.
3808000	3812000	It is not ready. Not ready.
3812000	3814000	I'll try it again. I'll try the beta one more time
3814000	3818000	before the actual game is released to see if maybe they added some expositions.
3818000	3820000	I will say this. At first, I was like,
3820000	3822000	Ooh, this is pretty. Ooh, this cutscene is so pretty.
3822000	3824000	Ooh, my characters in this cutscene.
3824000	3827000	Oh, my gosh, this is a beautiful game.
3827000	3830000	This looks so amazing. This character customization is really thorough.
3830000	3836000	And then I was stuck in the city running around for an hour
3836000	3838000	because I had no idea where the hell I was supposed to be going
3838000	3839000	or what I was supposed to be doing.
3839000	3840000	I want to try it.
3840000	3841000	It's bad.
3841000	3842000	I still want to try it.
3842000	3843000	It's bad.
3843000	3844000	I want to try it though.
3844000	3846000	Just so I can see how bad.
3846000	3848000	S2100Matt says,
3848000	3850000	So wait, Rob, what you're describing is Final Fantasy XI.
3850000	3851000	Yeah, kinda.
3851000	3852000	Yeah.
3852000	3854000	At least with Final Fantasy XI, I don't know.
3854000	3856000	Maybe it was because I had friends that played,
3856000	3859000	but I still feel like I was able to figure it out somewhat,
3859000	3864000	but I went into combat. I was fighting a rat or something.
3864000	3866000	I don't even know, and I got frozen in combat,
3866000	3868000	and the rat wasn't targetable anymore,
3868000	3870000	and I had to abandon the quest,
3870000	3872000	and if I wanted to start the quest again,
3872000	3874000	I would have had to run 30 minutes back into town.
3874000	3876000	It was ridiculous.
3876000	3877000	Again, I know it's a beta.
3877000	3879000	I'm not supposed to be giving my final impressions on the game,
3879000	3881000	but if the beta was supposed to be raising my excitement
3881000	3883000	for somebody that spent three years of his life
3883000	3886000	playing Final Fantasy XI, didn't work.
3886000	3889000	I'll tell you that.
3889000	3890000	That's a shame.
3890000	3892000	Yeah, it is a shame. It's a real shame.
3892000	3894000	What's also a shame nowadays
3894000	3897000	is that it will still be released on the 30th,
3897000	3901000	and what'll happen then is just,
3901000	3905000	oh, well, we'll patch it later.
3905000	3908000	Well, I mean, they still have time to patch it, but not much.
3908000	3910000	All right, let's actually get to another story.
3910000	3913000	I'm sorry we've taken up so much time with real ID and stuff,
3913000	3915000	but, you know, this stuff's important.
3915000	3916000	Jamie, what do you got for us?
3916000	3919000	What about a story I never played?
3919000	3920000	Nice.
3920000	3922000	Okay, because a lot of people love games on Facebook,
3922000	3924000	and a lot of people love Zuma.
3924000	3926000	I think you said you liked Zuma, didn't you?
3926000	3927000	Zuma's pretty fun.
3927000	3929000	It's not my favorite PopCap game,
3929000	3933000	but I don't think there's any PopCap games
3933000	3935000	that are really bad, per se.
3935000	3937000	Like, they get the job done.
3937000	3940000	As far as casual games go, they're all crackerific.
3940000	3941000	I love Peggle.
3941000	3942000	I love Peggle, too.
3942000	3947000	At any rate, Zuma Blitz is gonna be coming out on Facebook.
3947000	3952000	It's supposed to have in about three weeks a beta,
3952000	3955000	and then we should start seeing tournaments and levels
3955000	3959000	and experience points and getting different features
3959000	3963000	and treasure chests and virtual currency and blah, blah, blah.
3963000	3965000	So it should be cool.
3965000	3968000	I mean, it's gonna go up there with Bejeweled Blitz,
3968000	3971000	and that's got a lot of people playing it.
3971000	3974000	I like me some Zuma, and it should be good,
3974000	3975000	and I know a lot of people eat that up,
3975000	3979000	especially on Facebook, so it's gonna be cool.
3979000	3982000	You know, the only thing that I play on Facebook right now
3982000	3984000	is that Hotel City thing.
3984000	3986000	You know who would like that?
3986000	3987000	Xtifer.
3987000	3988000	He used to play lots of Zuma.
3988000	3990000	That's right, he did.
3990000	3992000	Someone should tell him.
3992000	3993000	He should be listening.
3993000	3995000	Blazinga, take note.
3995000	3998000	PopCap knows how to do the Facebook integration thing,
3998000	4001000	just saying.
4001000	4006000	And, um, well...
4006000	4008000	No, never mind, we've beaten this horse.
4008000	4011000	It's already dead and bleeding from his pores.
4011000	4012000	Give it another whip.
4012000	4013000	You haven't said enough on this.
4013000	4015000	We haven't skinned the horse yet.
4015000	4016000	It's not over until we skin the horse.
4016000	4019000	Because my Vicodin's wearing off.
4019000	4023000	I really think that, well, I was just thinking about
4023000	4025000	what you said about them really needing to sit down
4025000	4026000	and go over their business model,
4026000	4029000	but what if this is actually a true integrated part
4029000	4030000	of their business model?
4030000	4033000	Abandon ship.
4033000	4036000	I'm gonna just go back and say one thing about it.
4036000	4039000	Everybody, if you really are displeased with it,
4039000	4041000	do it in numbers.
4041000	4043000	Hit them in the bank and do it with people.
4043000	4046000	Organize.
4046000	4048000	But then where will I fight my internet dragons?
4048000	4051000	There's other games, Rob.
4051000	4052000	Rob?
4052000	4053000	It's just not the same.
4053000	4055000	What did I say last time?
4055000	4057000	Principle versus entertainment.
4057000	4058000	What's more important?
4058000	4063000	I don't know. I really like entertainment, Jamie.
4063000	4065000	Entertainment, Rob?
4065000	4068000	Rarely got anything going in motion.
4068000	4070000	Well, this is interesting.
4070000	4076000	THQ apparently is impressed by the 3DS piracy protection.
4076000	4078000	Of course, you may remember the piracy has been
4078000	4082000	a really big problem for the Nintendo DS,
4082000	4087000	and tons and tons of games being hurt by the amount of piracy
4087000	4089000	that there is on that system,
4089000	4092000	and because it's so very easy to do.
4092000	4097000	Ian Curran, THQ's executive VP of global publishing,
4097000	4103000	is saying that what excites me even more about the 3DS
4103000	4106000	is that there's technology built into the device
4106000	4108000	to really combat piracy.
4108000	4112000	He added, they combated piracy on the DSI,
4112000	4115000	which they don't believe is cracked yet,
4115000	4117000	but they know they've been hurt across the world,
4117000	4124000	and they believe that the 3DS has got the technology to stop that.
4124000	4127000	I'm kind of curious what that is, but I guess they can't tell us,
4127000	4129000	or then the pirates would start getting to work.
4129000	4133000	Well, here's my observation about that.
4133000	4137000	Nintendo thinks that they've stopped piracy on the DSI.
4137000	4138000	Really?
4138000	4143000	I mean, because I've seen flash carts with the DSI.
4143000	4145000	I'm not going to go buy a DSI,
4145000	4147000	because I'm probably going to pick up a 3DS eventually,
4147000	4153000	but I mean, they haven't stopped piracy on the DSI,
4153000	4158000	and they're just going to get smarter.
4158000	4162000	I mean, since it's basically cartridges it's reading off of,
4162000	4164000	if you can mimic the data that's on there,
4164000	4167000	then I don't see how it can really stop it.
4167000	4170000	I mean, they have anti-piracy measures that they put into the games,
4170000	4174000	but it takes like a week or two to crack them at the most,
4174000	4178000	and a lot of them get cracked day one, if not early,
4178000	4180000	because they come out in other regions.
4180000	4183000	I guess we won't really truly have the second half to this story
4183000	4185000	until the 3DS is out.
4185000	4187000	We know what that anti-piracy measure is,
4187000	4189000	but it just seems like an echo of what we always hear.
4189000	4190000	It'll probably take a few months,
4190000	4194000	but considering the technology is still going to be somewhat backwards compatible
4194000	4197000	because it's going to be playing DS games,
4197000	4200000	it's going to probably be as easy to crack as the DSIs,
4200000	4203000	so it'll be a matter of time.
4203000	4208000	I don't think that they've finally solved the problem.
4208000	4211000	Well, here's something, and maybe this ties into it.
4211000	4213000	I don't know. This could be interesting,
4213000	4217000	but you know the 3DS has something that they talked about briefly called Tag Mode,
4217000	4221000	which I always thought was supposed to be a part of the regular DS,
4221000	4223000	but it kind of wasn't.
4223000	4225000	But anyway, what Tag Mode is supposed to be,
4225000	4229000	a passive communication feature that lets the DS systems talk to each other
4229000	4231000	and send the data back and forth,
4231000	4234000	which I always thought was some type of, it was in the DS, right,
4234000	4236000	because you could carry Animal Crossing around in your pocket,
4236000	4239000	but of course now you had to have the game on,
4239000	4243000	and you had to be in that mode that sent out the letter in the bottle
4243000	4245000	or whatever it was, that mode. Remember that?
4245000	4247000	You could send the letters in the bottle.
4247000	4250000	But anyhow, I'm assuming this Tag Mode doesn't require that.
4250000	4254000	Like maybe your DS can be off, and it still will tag.
4254000	4257000	Maybe it uses low battery power to still kind of do this when it's asleep.
4257000	4258000	Yeah.
4258000	4259000	I don't know.
4259000	4263000	But there is a little more information given by Hideki Kono,
4263000	4265000	who is the platform producer of the 3DS,
4265000	4267000	in an interview with Wired Magazine.
4267000	4271000	He says, in the hardware, we have the capability that when you first play a game
4271000	4276000	that supports Tag Mode, it will save to a Tag Mode data slot in the hardware system.
4276000	4279000	We're planning to support multiple games at the same time.
4279000	4280000	So that's the difference.
4280000	4283000	Mario Kart, Nintendogs, Animal Crossing, and so forth.
4283000	4286000	I see, because right now the game does have to be running.
4286000	4290000	So there will actually be a Tag Mode viewer where you can manage the data.
4290000	4293000	It will bring consumers a sense of wanting to play a game again
4293000	4297000	after they get new data from games that they'd already forgotten about.
4297000	4302000	What if the piracy is firmware updates delivered through Tag?
4302000	4304000	I'm sure that's one way they can do it.
4304000	4305000	That's what I'm thinking.
4305000	4307000	Like maybe that's one of the ways they're going to do it,
4307000	4308000	is that you don't have a choice.
4308000	4310000	These things are going to show up on your system
4310000	4314000	because you walked by someone else with the newer firmware.
4314000	4317000	Wouldn't that be amazing? I bet that's it.
4317000	4319000	I bet that's one of the antivirus images they have in it.
4319000	4323000	Well, one of the original ways that they used to have the flash carts kind of work
4323000	4328000	is they had some sort of thing with the Wi-Fi where you could do something with it.
4328000	4329000	I don't remember.
4329000	4331000	I probably sound like an idiot with this.
4331000	4334000	But I know there was something that involved Wi-Fi at one point
4334000	4337000	with the original DS flash carts and stuff
4337000	4343000	when they were first getting those to work with proprietary code and stuff like that.
4343000	4344000	It's possible.
4344000	4347000	I think it's kind of a neat feature.
4347000	4352000	Speaking of going back to play games that we haven't played in a while,
4352000	4356000	and I'm sure most people out there already know this is possible,
4356000	4359000	but since I don't check up everything on the internet,
4359000	4362000	I was unaware that they had these things.
4362000	4365000	Apparently there's a track editor for Mario Kart Wii, and that's awesome
4365000	4368000	because there's all sorts of cool tracks out there that people have made.
4368000	4370000	I'm like, ooh, that's exciting.
4370000	4372000	That would actually get me to go back and play Mario Kart.
4372000	4375000	Why didn't they include that as a feature in the goddamn game to begin with?
4375000	4378000	It would be so epic.
4378000	4380000	But then, of course, they couldn't sell Mario Kart 2.
4380000	4382000	Yeah, exactly. That would be in the sequel.
4382000	4384000	I mean, look at LittleBigPlanet, though.
4384000	4385000	I mean, they could easily.
4385000	4388000	Or ModNation Racers, which that's the whole thing, basically.
4388000	4390000	Exactly.
4390000	4392000	Such a missed opportunity.
4392000	4397000	Sj100Matt, in commenting on the possible tag mode is the anti-piracy,
4397000	4401000	Sj100Matt says, Nintendo isn't that smart.
4401000	4402000	Let's see.
4402000	4406000	Toygak says, wireless is a battery hog. It better not be on.
4406000	4408000	You can probably turn it off.
4408000	4415000	Well, yeah, and there's probably a thing where it uses really, really low battery
4415000	4419000	until it detects that DS, and then it uses it for a minute, and then shuts back off.
4419000	4422000	Like, I don't see why the technology isn't there to do that,
4422000	4424000	where it slowly drains your battery.
4424000	4428000	But the battery power, you know, it's been, what, five years since the last DS?
4428000	4431000	Or, sorry, not the last DS, but the first DS?
4431000	4434000	I would think they've probably made the batteries in those things a lot better.
4434000	4438000	And it's not like the games probably require that much more battery.
4438000	4444000	I mean, yeah, they're 3D, but I don't think it's going to be that much more.
4444000	4448000	And Sj100Matt says, yeah, it does sound like the Pokewalker type of technology.
4448000	4452000	Sj100Matt also says, maybe they can track me via my 20-digit friend code.
4452000	4453000	Didn't they say they're going to...
4453000	4455000	Oh, God, I hope they're not going to do friend codes this summer.
4455000	4458000	I think they kind of hinted they might be doing away with that.
4458000	4460000	Or changing it, I suppose.
4460000	4463000	10-digit friend codes, woohoo!
4463000	4465000	One-digit friend codes.
4465000	4467000	All right, let's move on to another story.
4467000	4470000	Dark Sakura's got something for us, and then release dates.
4470000	4472000	And the classic game of the week is not too far away.
4472000	4482000	Well, for fans of Josh Stone, she's going to be the next Bond girl, at least, in James Bond Bloodstone.
4482000	4485000	Josh Stone. Bloodstone.
4485000	4494000	She'll be playing Nicole Hunter, who is a socialite, works in diamonds, and said that she thinks it's crazy to be a Bond girl.
4494000	4504000	So, just talking about having a full-body scan and everything, but it's supposed to be a third-person cover-based shooter with vehicle stuff in there.
4504000	4505000	It's the bizarre creation tool.
4505000	4509000	Including cars and speedboats. So, should be fun.
4509000	4511000	Her name is Nicole Hunter.
4511000	4512000	Nicole Hunter.
4512000	4515000	In the game. That's kind of a shitty Bond girl name.
4515000	4519000	Like, whatever happened to Pussy Galore? That was awesome.
4519000	4527000	And you know, even what was her name? Denise Richards was like Christmas something, or it was something really ridiculous.
4527000	4529000	Nicole Hunter.
4529000	4531000	Nicole Hunter is kind of boring.
4531000	4536000	Well, she did, though, describe the character as a posh version of Paris Hilton.
4536000	4540000	I thought Paris Hilton was supposed to be kind of posh already.
4540000	4541000	No.
4541000	4542000	I mean, she's kind of trashy.
4542000	4543000	She's posher!
4543000	4546000	She's like, more posher. Oh, okay, that explains it.
4546000	4551000	I would probably say, I would exchange that word with classy.
4551000	4555000	Let's make the character like Paris Hilton.
4555000	4559000	She's not posh enough! I can't make her any more posher!
4559000	4564000	Of course, if you want to make the character more posher, you should have gotten posh spice.
4564000	4566000	I was saying classy.
4566000	4572000	At any rate, you know, if they wanted to make her real trailer trash, you know, they probably just could have called her Atmore Motel 6.
4572000	4576000	Salacious Pop, thank you. Christmas Jones. She was a nuclear physicist.
4576000	4580000	That was Denise Richards in, whatever, like, was it Tomorrow Never Dies?
4580000	4584000	She played a character named Christmas Jones. How ridiculous is that name?
4584000	4585000	Christmas Jones.
4585000	4590000	Nicole Hunter? That's, I don't, like, I don't know, but I probably knew a girl in high school named that.
4590000	4597000	Like, that's not that exciting.
4597000	4604000	Now we got all these random Bond, Bond girl type names being yelled out here. Honey Rider, Posher Spice, maybe that could be the name.
4604000	4610000	Toa Gax says Paris Hilton equals Pussy Here, Pussy There, Pussy Pussy Everywhere.
4610000	4611000	That's kind of how she got famous.
4611000	4616000	Bond girl names could be exchangeable with, you know, porn star names too.
4616000	4620000	Oh, yeah, Jinx. Wasn't Hal Berry called Jinx?
4620000	4623000	What was her name? I think it was Jinx, because they were going to do a spinoff movie.
4623000	4626000	By the way, you know what my favorite porn star name is?
4626000	4627000	What?
4627000	4630000	Alice in Chains. I just thought it was funny.
4630000	4634000	And lastly, before we move on to release dates, let's just pop in our chatroom.
4634000	4638000	Chat.overtonesloudandstrated.com says, how is Paris Hilton like Kansas?
4638000	4645000	Both are flat, white, and easy to enter.
4645000	4653000	Strawberry Fields. Really? That was a Bond girl? Strawberry Fields?
4653000	4660000	See, Strawberry Fields, Pussy Galore, Christmas Jones, Nicole Hunter.
4660000	4662000	It just doesn't work.
4662000	4667000	Alright, let's move on. Release dates. Travel around the world and talk about games coming out soon.
4667000	4671000	In a store near you. We'll start with the US, Loki.
4671000	4678000	You know, her name's sort of broken down. It could sound like Hole Hunter, so I mean, you know.
4678000	4679000	Sort of.
4679000	4681000	What about Mike Hunter?
4681000	4682000	Mike Hunter.
4682000	4684000	That would have been better.
4684000	4687000	I did know a guy named Benjamin Dover.
4687000	4689000	Poor guy.
4689000	4694000	So stuff coming out this week. Not a whole lot, because July is a pretty slow month.
4694000	4698000	But there's some generic DS games, of course, coming out.
4698000	4703000	Hidden Objects Mystery Stories. That's another Hidden Objects game.
4703000	4706000	Yeah, because there's not a lot of those on the DS.
4706000	4714000	Apparently Trackmania Turbo, but I somehow doubt that's actually coming out, because I think I got delayed to October.
4714000	4720000	Samantha Swift and the Hidden Roses of Athena, which also I believe was delayed forever.
4720000	4723000	And I definitely go Trackmania on the Wii, man.
4723000	4729000	You know, GameStop needs to update their fucking release list. It is terrible.
4729000	4735000	Mumbo Jumbo 6-Pack Seccident Edition. It's six games from Mumbo Jumbo that you can buy on PC.
4735000	4737000	Hooray!
4740000	4742000	Wow, is that it?
4742000	4746000	So there's, like, nothing coming out this week. That can't be right.
4746000	4748000	Maybe it's just a slow week.
4748000	4754000	Well, Hidden Objects Mystery Stories it is.
4754000	4758000	I gotta go back to chat. I know the Bond girl thing is getting old, but this comment is too good.
4758000	4760000	I'll look at a different list, because that's a pathetic listing.
4760000	4766000	Eric H. is in our chat tonight. He's actually the brains behind the big battle over at Dead Pixel Live, so welcome.
4766000	4774000	He says, Christmas Jones led to the worst end lines of any Bond film. I thought Christmas only came once a year.
4778000	4781000	Okay, there is other things this week. I forgot.
4781000	4785000	They had him on weird release dates, so it didn't really make sense to me.
4785000	4791000	Dark Star One Broken Alliance on Xbox 360, which that game actually reminds me of.
4791000	4796000	I don't know if anyone remembers this PlayStation 1 game, but Colony Wars, or even, like, Descent Free Space.
4796000	4798000	So that might be kind of cool on 360.
4798000	4802000	Ark Rise Fantasia on the Wii, really awesome role-playing game.
4802000	4810000	And Cats and Dogs Revenge of Kitty Galore on DS.
4810000	4818000	And I don't think it's on this list, but I remember it, and why the god hell did they make this game in the first place.
4818000	4823000	The Bachelor, featuring The Bachelorette, as well on Wii and DS.
4823000	4829000	Yes, the Bachelor video game. That is correct. And Zany Golf on Wii.
4829000	4835000	Really? Like, what game do you make out of- is that the closest thing we're gonna get in America to a dating sim?
4835000	4840000	Um... Maybe?
4840000	4844000	I wanna be the Bachelor that rejects them all. Like, didn't that happen on one of them?
4844000	4847000	Like, he or she, I don't remember, one of them just said,
4847000	4850000	You know what? You all suck. I don't want any of you.
4850000	4852000	Oh, fuck you all. I'm outta here.
4852000	4855000	Later. Oh, I played again.
4855000	4861000	Losers. I just wanna get laid. Done. I don't need you.
4861000	4867000	Christmas only came once a year. On the Xbox 360 in Japan this week.
4867000	4874000	Blur Razors comes out in Japan this week. You know, I'm kind of thinking that is actually Blur over there, and it is.
4874000	4878000	But they call it Blur- it's Blur Racers. On this website it's incredibly spelled.
4878000	4881000	Razors? I know, I thought that was a dumb name.
4881000	4883000	Blue Racers!
4883000	4888000	Blue Racers with a Z, by the way. That's important. Blur Racers with a Z is out in Japan this week.
4888000	4889000	Bruh. Bruh.
4889000	4893000	Stop it. 99 Nights 2 comes out in Japan this week.
4893000	4899000	I saw that on the shelf at the gaming store. I thought about buying it for five seconds, and I was like, what am I thinking?
4899000	4905000	That's pretty much it on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan, so unfortunately you guys had to wait for some of the games we've had here.
4905000	4914000	But on PlayStation 3 you get Blur Racers as well, or Ken Tomahou to Gakuno Mono is coming out as well.
4914000	4920000	I don't even know what this is. This is an upgraded version of the Cute Fantasy School Life RPGs.
4920000	4923000	This must be a remake of an old game that's now available.
4923000	4928000	It looks like it involves kind of like the card style battle in the game.
4928000	4932000	Kind of mixed with a Dragon Warrior-esque style battle system.
4932000	4938000	I like how in big letters it says Hito! On that screenshot.
4938000	4944000	So that's probably not something coming out over here, because that does not look familiar to me at all.
4944000	4950000	But on the Nintendo Wii this week, one new game, Kage no Tu is coming out this week on the Wii.
4950000	4957000	This is a Hudson game. You control a light source to solve puzzles and battle monsters.
4957000	4961000	This is not a game I'm familiar with over here.
4961000	4970000	No, that's Lost in Shadow that's coming out. It's that really cool, trippy puzzle platform game.
4970000	4974000	I did see that at PAX East I think they were showing that.
4974000	4977000	Okay, so it's that. It's Kage no Tu over there in Japan.
4977000	4979000	Yeah, it's coming out over here in September.
4979000	4993000	I like how on Play Asia they have a wonderful combo where I can buy blur razors for the PS3 and I can combo with blur razors for the PS3.
4993000	4997000	Oh, I'm sorry, that's blur on the PS3 in case I want both versions of the game.
4997000	4999000	You're gonna play American and Japanese. Why not?
4999000	5000000	It's the same game.
5000000	5002000	I'm not playing both. It's region free.
5002000	5010000	On the Nintendo DS, Katekyo Hitman Reborn DS Flame Rumble XX. Yes, that is really the game's name.
5010000	5012000	They have some crazy names over there.
5012000	5014000	They like their subtitles.
5014000	5016000	They love their subtitles. They really do.
5016000	5023000	Well, remember how long the one Street Fighter I have is like something, something, something for matching service.
5023000	5028000	Remember, the longer the subtitles, the better the game.
5028000	5036000	TV Anime Fairy Tale Gekitou Madoushi Kessen comes out as well. Is this like an interactive anime?
5036000	5038000	That sounds like a really good game.
5038000	5044000	It looks like an action game that's just based on an anime. Like the anime plays on the bottom screen and you're kind of controlling the top screen.
5044000	5046000	Looks a little silly.
5046000	5052000	And lastly, going to the PSP for Japanese release dates, Fate slash Extra is the big release this week on the PSP.
5052000	5058000	It's coming out in regular and limited editions because the only thing they love more in subtitles are limited editions in Japan.
5058000	5063000	Yeah, but my limited edition has a bowl and a plate and a knife and a clock.
5063000	5067000	Well, this is an RPG on the PSP. It actually looks kind of cool.
5067000	5072000	It's kind of got a very Phantasy Star look to it. The newer Phantasy Star games, that is.
5072000	5073000	Yeah.
5073000	5078000	Kind of in its like action-y type attack. I got to say, this looks kind of neat, actually.
5078000	5085000	Who's the spy? Marvelous. So it's not even by Sega, but it kind of looks inspired by the newer Phantasy Star games, at least to me, at first glance.
5085000	5088000	There it is, your Japanese release dates. How about the UK?
5088000	5101000	Well, in the UK we have some games. We have, um, on the 19th we have Alien Swarm and the 20th Need for Speed World. Those are both PC, by the way.
5101000	5109000	The 23rd is Dragon Quest IX Sentinels of the Starry Skies, and that's it until... Yeah, that's it.
5109000	5116000	Alright. Just a couple quick more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week while we transition into Part B tonight.
5116000	5118000	Loki, you got something else for us?
5118000	5128000	Guess what? If you've signed up for the PlayStation Plus service, you may be a wonderful contestant in checking out Hulu Plus as well.
5128000	5132000	Hey, it's another service with Plus in the name. It's got to be good, right?
5132000	5140000	Which will become available to select subscribers of the Sony's PlayStation Plus program starting now.
5140000	5152000	Apparently, eventually all subscribers may be able to check out the Hulu Plus service once it finally launches.
5152000	5160000	But as of right now, you can download the Hulu Plus software and request an invitation to an exclusive preview.
5160000	5168000	And if you're chosen, then you can preview the wonderful stuff that Hulu Plus will be allowing you to check out.
5168000	5178000	Am I hearing you correctly that you're telling me, if I pay Sony $50 a year, I might get the opportunity.
5178000	5193000	I might get selected, my name might get pulled out of that hat, and I would be given the opportunity with my $50 a year to pay Hulu $10 a year to watch old crap on TV.
5193000	5196000	Am I correct in what I'm hearing?
5196000	5198000	You are correct, and doesn't it sound awesome?
5198000	5203000	Sign me the fuck up! All this and core? Wow!
5203000	5211000	I don't know, I got nothing.
5211000	5215000	It was beyond my ability to comment on, Rob.
5215000	5221000	Wait, can I tune in Hulu Plus stuff on my TV in my Sony home apartment?
5221000	5223000	Probably not.
5223000	5237000	Can I possibly, I don't know, put out core magazines in my Sony apartment on home, like on my coffee table or anything like that?
5237000	5242000	I don't think you can do that, but in the mall they sometimes show clips from core.
5242000	5249000	Oh wow, clips! I'm gonna stay there in the mall forever until I see the whole month of core, just so I don't have to pay for it.
5249000	5255000	And eventually I'll see all the clips, so that's gonna be a worthwhile investment of my time.
5255000	5262000	You know, there's the OLR clubhouse right now, right? We have a clubhouse at home. Dumbest $5 I ever spent, but I had to do it.
5262000	5266000	OLR, we love to explore new ways to interact with our audience and all these social things.
5266000	5268000	Some of those ways may not be good.
5268000	5273000	Stupid dollars. Look, look, I took the hit for the team, okay? I spent $5 on this clubhouse at home.
5273000	5287000	Right now, we're limited to 25 members, and believe it or not, I don't know how this is possible, but I still get requests at least once a week to join the club, and I have to just file them away and ignore them.
5287000	5289000	Trust me, you're not missing out on anything.
5289000	5301000	Yeah, here's the thing. The clubhouse is a room, and I decorated it with the arcade machines that I won in the Namco demo, and I tried to put some stuff in there, but I can't put anything...
5301000	5312000	I can't put anything OLR-related in there. I can't put a clip from the show. There's a giant TV that sits at the top of the clubhouse. I can't do anything with it.
5312000	5325000	I can't put, like, video, you know, because we've shot video before. I can't put that there. I can't put... I can't even put, like, the OLR artwork on the wall. I can do nothing.
5325000	5332000	So what you're saying is you've transformed your OLR clubhouse into your game room.
5332000	5334000	Yes, I did.
5334000	5339000	Oh, Sony.
5339000	5345000	And I paid five bucks for that exclusive opportunity to beta test the clubhouses.
5345000	5350000	Feeling a little impotent now?
5350000	5359000	I'm just shocked. I'm hearing the words come out of my mouth, and I want to smack myself on the back of the head and call me an idiot. I paid five dollars to beta test the clubhouse.
5359000	5361000	Here's the funny part about it, though.
5361000	5362000	God, I'm an idiot.
5362000	5374000	They're still, like, gung-ho with home and saying, oh, it's such a wonderful platform. Oh my god, it's so successful. Doesn't that sound a little bit like, oh my god, sodium one will blow your fucking mind?
5374000	5393000	UMD is such a wonderful format. It will change the world in, like, portable media. Damn it! Digital content? On a memory stick? Ah! Why didn't we think of that first?
5393000	5396000	It's just so funny.
5396000	5404000	Okay, okay. We're going to make this just fucking kick-ass game in home, and we're going to give it away for free, alright? You ready?
5404000	5413000	You're going to be in a tank, and you go around in this 3D space, and you shoot other tanks. Oh my god, it's a print! Run with it. It's amazing.
5413000	5428000	And you can, like, post to your... You'll be able to post to your Twitter when you overtake other tanks, and you'll win stuff for your house. But not your real house, your fake house. And shirts.
5428000	5438000	Oh, but then you have to pay for additional levels once you get there. And for the record, I never got to the point where I had to buy additional levels because I got bored with the game that quick.
5438000	5452000	Look, I just... And for those that think we're being Xbox fanboys right now and giving Sony an unbelievable amount of hate, look, I'll just say this. Never forget Yaris.
5452000	5457000	So, it can happen to anyone, alright?
5457000	5467000	Hey! Speaking of the Xbox, actually, maybe this is a good thing to follow it up with. You know how they're making this awesome new channel called The Destination Arcade?
5467000	5479000	Actually, it's not really... It doesn't actually sound that awesome at all. Destination Arcade is, like, this store that you can download to see the store in a whole new way.
5479000	5493000	I mean, really, that's what it is. Destination Arcade, like, when we release this, you guys, you're gonna get to see the store in a whole new way. You're gonna have this all-new opportunity to buy things.
5493000	5500000	Man, that sounds awesome! And everybody's like, fuck yeah, sign me up! Destination Arcade's gonna be the shit!
5500000	5510000	Well, guess what? Major Nelson came out and said, okay, so Destination Arcade, you get to download it this week and it's gonna, like, blow your mind, and then August 18th, we're shutting it off!
5510000	5513000	So, it's a limited time only!
5513000	5526000	We fixed all the problems with, you know, Xbox Live Arcade. We made things easier to find for a limited time, and then you're gonna have to go back to finding things the old hard way. Why bother?
5526000	5548000	So, there you go. I don't even have to defer to yours. This is just as stupid. You know what this is just like? This is just like, hey, guess what, guys? We know that you've been bitching about the D-Pad forever, and we're gonna release these wonderful limited edition FIFA controllers that are green, that have the D-Pad fixed, but it's only for a limited time. We're going back to the crappy broken D-Pad.
5548000	5575000	Okay, apparently, I didn't even know this until just now. Here's the best part. Wait for it, guys. Okay, so Major Nelson had an interview with Shaq News, apparently, and said that, I didn't even know this, I'm hearing this for the first time, said to Shaq News, if you've downloaded it, it will continue to work, but you can only download it until August 18th, apparently.
5575000	5596000	So, if you wanna be part of this exclusive club, that's like, I don't even know, that's like going to a mall, and like, you could go to Macy's to buy clothes, or you could go to JCPenney, but you know what, you had to sign up for this, during this month-long promotion to go to JCPenney.
5596000	5606000	And if you didn't sign up during that time, there's gonna be a guard at the door who's just gonna bounce you. Like, did you download this between July and August? Come on in. Fuck you, go to Macy's. We don't want your business.
5606000	5617000	It's gonna be like this. It's gonna be like, okay, if you've downloaded this program, all the clothes will be on the shelf, but if you haven't downloaded this program, you're gonna have to go to the store where all the clothes are in a giant pile in the middle.
5617000	5627000	They're just on the floor. It'll be like that old Nick game show, Finders Keepers.
5627000	5633000	Just to let everybody know right now, at this point, Rob has doubled over and put his head between his knees.
5633000	5648000	I mean, how many news stories have we read tonight that just don't make any fucking sense? Like, what is wrong with all of you? Are you all high? Did they give out drugs in E3 this year?
5648000	5651000	Well, why didn't we get to go then? I want drugs.
5651000	5663000	You don't understand. Blasinga, Sony, Microsoft, you're all stupid. What is wrong? Rob is breathless with disbelief.
5663000	5667000	We just figured it out. Our eyes are open.
5667000	5671000	I just simply cannot. Rob's gonna cry.
5671000	5680000	That's the perfect thing to do when you've solved problems in making things easier to find. You cancel it. That's perfect. That makes sense to me.
5680000	5685000	Not much makes sense anymore in this world.
5685000	5700000	So, enjoy this very special store that you can only download for a limited time. And Salacious Pop's asking, so is it like a skin or what? You know, I don't know. I'm just told it's like this super special new way.
5700000	5707000	It's fairy dust, okay? It's fairy dust.
5707000	5709000	I got nothing.
5709000	5720000	We're gonna offer this free game for a limited time. It's featuring a car from Toyota called the Yaris. It's gonna blow your mind.
5720000	5725000	Alright, you guys. We're gonna put out this vision camera.
5725000	5727000	That was so bad it made me burp.
5727000	5744000	We're gonna put out this camera and it's gonna allow you to play these awesome fucking games like totem ball. Yeah, it's like pinball, but you like use your hands. Use your hands. You flail. You make the pinball thingy go.
5744000	5751000	By the way, this is the same company that's putting out a camera this year that you're gonna use your hands to.
5751000	5760000	Rob, yeah, let's not. It's too painful. What if it's too late for me to sell back my vision camera for, say, some store credit?
5760000	5772000	Salacious Pop in our chatroom says, Major Nelson announces new store, announces that Seattle has the best weed, and that this dude at Rare takes the biggest bong hits he's ever seen.
5772000	5779000	You know what? I think we need to take, we need to take a, what? Yes, Loki, final. I have a great idea. Yes.
5779000	5787000	We want to show off the Kinect to get people excited about it. What store can we back connect with?
5787000	5799000	God, Macy's. Where do all the people that play Kinect gather on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays between noon and 8 p.m.?
5799000	5814000	Where are they all at? Where would I go? Would I go to the mini golf? No, fuck the mini golf place. Would I go, would I go to the movies? No, no. Kinect players don't go to the movies. I know. We'll go to Macy's, who doesn't even have an electronics department.
5814000	5825000	What the fuck? Oh, that's fun. You're all high.
5825000	5835000	So let's take a look at the way they did it in the past. Let's see how you used to get high in the 80s, huh? With the trip down memory lane and the classic game of the week.
5835000	5845000	That's right. We're going to take a moment to see the drug induced effects of video games back in the day. And boy, did Jamie pick a good one tonight for this topic, didn't you, Jamie?
5845000	5860000	I'm sure that did. I just want to point out, she picks these well before the show starts. It's just, it's just too good tonight.
5860000	5872000	And I really put this in an honor of classic gaming expo because it's there every year. You mean, um, the California extreme? Whatever that thing was. Yeah, California extreme. The event that let you in free with a media pass? Yeah.
5872000	5882000	I know they were great. Well, I'm, I'm covering it at media like and stuff. By the way, she just took another Vicodin folks. So you're in for a real treat in part B.
5882000	5904000	Well, my element was wearing off. I was in pain. Um, anyway, um, so yeah, Journey. Uh, Bally Midway put it out in the 80s. Um, and, uh, it was after, you know, Frontiers, which was their 1983 album by Journey, you know, got them really popular.
5904000	5920000	So, um, it was supposed to go along with the US band tour. Um, and then, um, it was actually, uh, brought in incredible technologies as a second team of developers to, uh, bring it out for Christmas around that time.
5920000	5938000	And so it's features the, who the band members were at the time, which was Steve Perry and Neil Sean, uh, Steve Smith, Jonathan Cain and Ross Valerie. Um, they have a sort of cartoon bodies, but their faces are really like these digital black and white photographs from while they were on tour.
5938000	5958000	Um, and it was supposed to use, um, this, uh, photo technology for another game, but it failed in location testing. So anyway, um, you have to, uh, go through the game to find the different, um, musical instruments or a microphone.
5958000	5974000	So you play each of the members of the band in these different levels to get their missing musical implement. And now turn this up.
5974000	5991000	That's in the last level. Um, there's actually a cassette player in the machine, um, that, um, when you get to the last level, it'll play a looped version of separate ways, which is what was playing on there.
5991000	6004000	And the last level is that you have to keep fans from, uh, storming the stage and stealing the instruments again. And then of course, when they finally get past you, then, um, you have to go find the things again.
6004000	6021000	Um, there, there was another game that Journey was in. It was called Journey Escape for the Atari 2600. This was listed as number nine on the top ten worst licensed game ideas ever for, uh, Game Informer 2007.
6021000	6035000	Who doesn't know Dick, apparently, because Journey is awesome. Just saying. I want to see what this Journey Escape thing is. Yeah, Journey Escape. Here's from Emmanuel. You're on a boat with Journey. One of the world's hottest rock groups.
6035000	6057000	A spectacular performance has just ended. Now it's up to you to guide each Journey band member past hordes of love-crazed groupies, sneaky photographers, and shifty-eyed promoters to the safety of the Journey Escape vehicle. And time to make it to the next concert. Your mighty manager and loyal roadies are there to help, but the escape is up to you.
6057000	6085000	Sounds like a ten to me. You have to make it to the Scarab Escape vehicle, the same one that's on the cover. I know, right? It was very different from the arcade game, so if you only played the 2600- The song Escape, though, ironically, is not in the game. But the intro is Don't Stop Believing. There you go. Alright. There it is, your classic game of the week journey. Oh, and by the way, the manager is the Kool-Aid man. What? Oh, the 2600 version?
6085000	6097000	The manager, inexplicably depicted as the Kool-Aid man. Hey, Kool-Aid man! Oh yeah! Oh no! Naughty, naughty Kool-Aid.
6097000	6118000	Alright, we're gonna take a quick break here. It's been kind of a fun Part A tonight. I don't know what's in the air tonight here at OLR Studios, but we're having fun. I hope you guys are, too. Join our chat if you're not already there. Chat.orangelaungeready.com. We got plenty more coming up in Part B tonight. We got our rapid-fire news, and Loki already blew it, but we are gonna talk about the Big Macy's tour. We've got to talk about some of that.
6118000	6136000	Also, 1 vs. 100 got canned this week, so you know we gotta talk about that, because it's kind of sad. And yeah, man, there's a lot of stories here tonight that are just, like, bad ideas. This is not Good News Week, everybody. I'm sorry, but hopefully there'll be some good gems tonight.
6136000	6148000	Go ahead. To be fair, we're actually not talking about the Macy's tour so much. It's actually a lot. Other places. Oh, there's the Roadshow, too. Alright, we'll mention them both, I'm sure.
6148000	6162000	And there is some good news, though, we're gonna talk about as well. Mega Man Universe we'll talk about a little bit when we come back, and we'll talk as well about a very, very classic Atari 2600 game getting updated for the new millennium. That should be kind of interesting.
6162000	6168000	So we'll talk about all that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio. Don't go anywhere, we'll be right back.
6168000	6196000	Hello, everybody, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this July the 18th, 2010, where we are taping live at All Games Radio. We're moving into Part B of our show, and I gotta tell you, if you're just tuning in, we've had a pretty funny show so far. Lots of fun chatter in Part A. Just a lot of weird news. It's been a very weird week in gaming, and a lot of strange ideas going on out there.
6196000	6208000	And the fun is gonna continue here in Part B. If you are just joining us, come into our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and have your say, because the big part of our show that makes our show unique is you.
6208000	6222000	And your chats and your tweets that we're gonna get to in a minute, and all that good stuff. And I also wanna call this out, your awesome iTunes reviews, when you say nice things about us on the internet that make us feel warm and fuzzy. I wanna read one here in a minute, but I gotta pull it up.
6222000	6231000	So in the meantime, let's get to some rapid fire news and things that happened throughout the week that we can mention in a few seconds.
6231000	6254000	The Expendables, a pretty awesome movie coming out this summer with a bunch of old action stars, is gonna be getting its own Facebook game, and it's very similar to Contra. And everybody loves Contra, and it kinda looks a little similar, I guess, because you can kill a bunch of people on a 2D platformer.
6254000	6265000	But what you need to do is you just have to like the Expendables fan page in order to get access to the game. I don't know, you should like the movie. Looks awesome.
6265000	6276000	Sonic Colors is a new game from Sega coming out this fall, and GameStop has a wonderful pre-order bonus with that. You can get a Sonic the Hedgehog hat.
6276000	6287000	Yes, putting it on will make you that much closer to Sonic. And it's kinda neat looking, actually. Not enough for me to say pre-order the game.
6287000	6292000	Does it have like a blue spiky thing on it? Oh, it does! That's adorable.
6292000	6303000	It's very adorable. So yes, you can check that out, and of course the game is gonna be on Wii and DS sometime this fall, probably around November.
6303000	6316000	And there is a new Oddworld game in the works being developed by the company Just Add Water. And they did a game called Gravity Crash.
6316000	6326000	And apparently it's got the, there are multiple projects across multiple platforms starring all your favorite Oddworld characters.
6326000	6339000	And they haven't said exactly when they're actually coming out, but you should just at least take solace that they are in the works at some point soon.
6339000	6342000	We'll see some Oddworld games come back.
6342000	6360000	Alright, I got some quick stories for you guys. One of them is about Kid Icarus. Kid Icarus? I like Kid Icarus. This is some other news coming out about Kid Icarus Uprising. Of course that's the 3DS game that finally brings back Kid Icarus after not being around ever since that Game Boy game.
6360000	6375000	Apparently, in a chat with Games Master, this is a magazine in the UK, Mashahiro Sakurai, who is the game designer at Super Smash Brothers Brawl, says that the online capabilities are currently being tested.
6375000	6381000	And by the way, yes, he made Brawl and he's making this game. He's saying the online capabilities are currently being tested.
6381000	6390000	There could be some versus play, but we can't go into any detail. There are a lot of capabilities that expand on what was in the DS that people are taking advantage of.
6390000	6402000	Hmm, so it sounds like the online and versus and all that is being toyed with, but we don't know anything for sure just yet, but it's kind of cool because I don't know about you guys, but I just assumed it was like a one player only thing.
6402000	6418000	Also, apparently some Capcom games are going to be making their way to the Wii Virtual Console Arcade. Sometimes you forget that the Virtual Console has an arcade, but they're going to be getting some Capcom games in an announcement this week.
6418000	6424000	Among some other Capcom announcements, we'll get into it in a little bit. So that's going to be kind of cool, some old school Capcom games.
6424000	6438000	A place where Capcom games would be welcomed would be Game Room, who saw the release of Fishing Derby, Barnstorming, and Quad Run all on the Atari 2600 this week, as well as the JIRUS for the arcade and Hover Force for the Intellivision.
6438000	6451000	Unfortunately, as awesome as it is to have JIRUS in Game Room, it was already on the Xbox Live Arcade, so it's probably the most awesome game that hit this week, but it already had a version released, so unfortunately Game Room didn't have a lot of win there.
6451000	6461000	However, I will say one place where Game Room wins, and I mentioned this in part A, but I wanted to say this as well, it did have a little upgrade this week that they patched into the game some new little features.
6461000	6473000	Like now, if you've been playing a game for a long time, the other avatars will come up behind you and start watching you and applaud you when you finally lose, although I don't know why they applaud you when you lose.
6473000	6488000	And then like fireworks when you get a medal, and most importantly, live leaderboards. When you're playing in ranked mode, you see your position in the leaderboard in real time, and you watch yourself conquer, like who's in 900th place, then 800th place, then 700th.
6488000	6500000	It's actually a really cool little addition, I thought that was neat. I was most excited as someone who's really tried to support Game Room and has sometimes been disappointed, but I'm really happy to see that they are doing updates, it makes me very hopeful for the future.
6500000	6507000	Now they just need some more licenses, like the Wii God with Capcom this week, that would be great. So we'll see. DarkSakura.
6507000	6524000	Well, something great coming out for iPhone will be Star Wars Battle for Hoth, especially good for fans of the Empire Strikes Back, right? Which people will arguably say is the best Star Trek movie, although I am personally a fan of Return of the Jedi, it's just me.
6524000	6531000	I think A New Hope was the best one. I know, I'm weird.
6531000	6541000	Rob hurt my brain. Anyway, it's gonna be out for $2.99, and it's meant to celebrate the 30 year anniversary of the Empire Strikes Back. Pretty cool, huh?
6541000	6561000	For Rock Band News, we have the Stooges and Bad Religion, the Stooges Pack 01, which total will be 440 Microsoft Points, or $5.49, includes $19.69, I Wanna Be Your Dog, and No Fun, each of those, well actually, $19.69 and No Fun will be 200 Wii Points a piece.
6561000	6571000	I was wondering why it's only saying that one of them has a Microsoft Points list. Forget I said that. They're $19.99 a piece.
6571000	6580000	Individual songs coming out are both by Bad Religion, New Dark Ages, and No Control, each 160 Microsoft Points, or 200 Wii Points.
6580000	6593000	And they will, of course, some of them being the Stooges Pack and No Control by Bad Religion will be in Lego Brock Band Store. I love Bad Religion. Gray band.
6593000	6597000	Alright, we're gonna get into this. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were done. My bad.
6597000	6598000	I have three!
6598000	6600000	Ah, my bad.
6600000	6604000	Rob is ignoring me. I am being marginalized!
6604000	6608000	I am multi-tasking, and I thought I heard three things.
6608000	6612000	I'm being marginalized! Cause I'm a woman!
6612000	6614000	Yes, because you're a woman.
6614000	6625000	I know. Anyway, um, now there is this really cool dude who has an even cooler, I would have to say, uh, I guess you're married by now, I don't know.
6625000	6638000	Um, but his name is Ray, is Ray Arafanto, who works for Xbox platform team, um, is getting married, or has gotten married, and his wedding ring is fantastic.
6638000	6644000	Um, it is a USB platinum wedding ring.
6644000	6653000	And, um, and on it, it says, um, for a lifetime of memories.
6653000	6655000	Isn't that pun-tastic?
6655000	6659000	Is it actually like you could plug it in a USB slot with the ring?
6659000	6677000	No, I don't need it. Actually, you know, I read though, um, Rob, I did read about another one, and I tried to find the pictures of it and I couldn't, about a couple that did have a USB wedding ring, a real USB wedding ring, and on it were, um, photos of their courtship.
6677000	6679000	Wow.
6679000	6686000	Yeah, that's why I would think, that's kind of what I thought of when you first talked about a USB wedding ring, like somebody's gonna plug one in.
6686000	6690000	Yeah, this one's just sort of cut into a USB-looking pattern.
6690000	6705000	But, um, but no, I did actually find one, um, about a couple that actually did have the, their, uh, ring, their rings each were, uh, photos of their lives together, built into the ring.
6705000	6728000	You know, this whole, like, USB, and to some extent mini-USB, and that whole technology is really interesting, like, you know, um, you know those, like, MedicAlert bracelets they used to have back in the day, and they still do, that, like, you know, they're like silver, and they have little snakes, the very identifiable medical thing on it, and it's usually for people, like, who are diabetic, or allergic, or have some type of medical condition, whereas they ever become unconscious, you know, and have to have an ambulance called on them, the ambulance knows something about them.
6728000	6730000	You know, they're putting that stuff on USB now.
6730000	6732000	I'm actually planning on making one for myself.
6732000	6741000	You see, like, these little, like, USB jewelry type things, and now it's, like, your whole medical records will be on there. Well, not, not your whole thing, but, you know, everything they need to know is there.
6741000	6748000	Well, see, that's actually a plan that I have, um, is getting one of those little, um, kind of rubber with the USB clasp, as it were.
6748000	6767000	Um, because, I mean, I had to repeat for the staff a couple of times that I'm allergic to penicillin, and amoxicillin, and the psyllins of the family, the mold, you know, and I was just thinking, what if I had fallen unconscious and had a bad infection, they tried to give me penicillin, you know.
6767000	6773000	So, I think that those are fantastic ideas. I'm actually looking into the cost of just making it myself.
6773000	6780000	Either with a micro-USB or doing, um, a micro-SD, to have it embedded in there.
6780000	6791000	Uh, bonesis6, 006, bondsis6, there's two Zs, which makes it very strange to pronounce, bonesis6 in our chatroom says a USB dildo.
6791000	6800000	You know, you could charge it, kind of like you do an iPhone. It's not outside the realm of possibility, I'm sure it's sadly been done.
6800000	6805000	They have USB AA batteries, that can charge in the...
6805000	6814000	Salacious Pop says RFID would seem more intuitive, that's what they use for pets. I didn't even think about that, of course, like if a pet gets lost, that's all you'd need. Crazy.
6814000	6819000	Um, alright, we're gonna get into Twitter topics here real quick, but first, I mentioned I was gonna read this.
6819000	6825000	We are so appreciative when people leave us nice reviews on iTunes, on our listing there, because it helps us spread the word about our show.
6825000	6833000	This one was especially nice, so I wanted to read this real quick, because it's awesome. It's from HungryMrDrunk, is the name of the user.
6833000	6835000	I know when I get drunk, I get hungry.
6835000	6843000	Uh, I have been a hardcore listener, lol, for years, and I can say that every Sunday I only think about running to my PSP to listen to this amazing podcast.
6843000	6848000	I think it should be syndicated on the radio. After all, they are official game analysts under President Cat.
6848000	6853000	They got me into music games like DDR and Guitar Hero, and because of them, I became a better gamer.
6853000	6855000	Thank you guys for the best eight years of my life.
6855000	6858000	Not to mention, we are the official podcast of the universe.
6858000	6863000	Actually, it's funny, he actually says in the title, why OLR is the best podcast in the galaxy.
6863000	6867000	Although technically it's the official video game podcast of the galaxy.
6867000	6869000	But I like being called best too.
6869000	6871000	It is nice, it's very nice.
6871000	6873000	That was a very sweet thank you person.
6873000	6875000	Thank you HungryMrDrunk.
6875000	6878000	HungryMrDrunk, you should come over and have a beer with me.
6878000	6879000	Yes, that's right, I hope you're next week.
6879000	6880000	When I'm not on Vicodin.
6880000	6882000	Lots of Guinness and Cheetos.
6882000	6885000	Alright, let's get into Twitter topics.
6885000	6887000	Shall we move into Twitter topics? We shall.
6887000	6888000	I guess.
6888000	6889000	You guess?
6889000	6891000	I guess.
6891000	6892000	Get a fan.
6892000	6896000	I'm a god Rob, I'm a god.
6896000	6898000	When did you last take a Vicodin?
6898000	6900000	An hour ago.
6900000	6902000	So during the show.
6902000	6904000	Yes, it is during the show.
6904000	6905000	During the show.
6905000	6906000	Let's see.
6906000	6908000	Whatever.
6908000	6910000	Alright.
6910000	6914000	You know, I figured out why it's affecting me very strongly.
6914000	6915000	Why is that?
6915000	6920000	Because keep in mind, I did one of those major detoxes when I went raw.
6920000	6923000	I quit like almost every bit of medication.
6923000	6926000	I didn't even take any pain medication or anything.
6926000	6931000	And so it's hitting me harder than it really used to.
6931000	6932000	It is.
6932000	6934000	Can I get to the Twitter topic?
6934000	6935000	Kitty!
6935000	6936000	Sorry.
6936000	6941000	SSJ100Matt sent me this link. It has nothing to do with anything.
6941000	6944000	This is why I really don't like to click on YouTubes during the show.
6944000	6946000	But SSJ100Matt is kind of funny.
6946000	6948000	And he sent this link and it's adorable.
6948000	6950000	He says, this new game is coming to the Wii.
6950000	6957000	And so this box comes up with nine little holes in it.
6957000	6960000	And then little kitties come out of the holes.
6960000	6963000	Get bonked.
6963000	6965000	Oh my god, send that to me Rob.
6965000	6966000	It's so adorable.
6966000	6967000	It's in our chat.
6967000	6968000	Are you in chat?
6968000	6969000	I'm in chat.
6969000	6971000	SSJ100Matt just posted this.
6971000	6972000	It's adorable.
6972000	6974000	And so this makes for terrible radios.
6974000	6976000	This is awful, terrible, horrible radio.
6976000	6977000	I'll put it on Facebook.
6977000	6979000	Yeah, let's put it on Facebook.
6979000	6980000	Alright.
6980000	6982000	Can I get to Twitter topics already?
6982000	6984000	Alright.
6984000	6986000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
6986000	6988000	Follow us, ask us questions, we answer, da da da.
6988000	6991000	DarkTattooia wants us to plug Retro Review.
6991000	6993000	Oh no, he says he's planning one.
6993000	6995000	I don't think I saw it posted yet.
6995000	6998000	But DarkTattooia does a lot of great work for the site, so thanks very much.
6998000	7001000	Let's see, Sturlok wants to give a shameless plug.
7001000	7003000	Is this turning into the shameless plug segment?
7003000	7004000	I think it is.
7004000	7007000	Actually, I really like this article though, so I am going to let him have his shameless plug.
7007000	7010000	He wrote an article for Geek-Life.com.
7010000	7011000	That's us.
7011000	7012000	Geek Life.
7012000	7015000	It's like all the O-L-R people are suddenly moving over there.
7015000	7016000	You're defecting.
7016000	7017000	No, that's okay.
7017000	7020000	He actually made this story and I just linked it there in chat.
7020000	7021000	It's GeekLife.com.
7021000	7023000	It's called The Blind Gamer Perspective.
7023000	7028000	Because Sturlok is actually a blind gamer and you might think, like, how is that even possible?
7028000	7030000	You can't see the sprites on the screen.
7030000	7037000	But he actually explains it and talks about audio cues and how helpful it is when you have a role-playing game
7037000	7039000	that tells you when you're running into walls.
7039000	7041000	Like, makes that bonk, bonk, bonk sound.
7041000	7043000	Like, you know, like some of the old Final Fantasy games do.
7043000	7046000	I thought it was a neat article, so I approve.
7046000	7047000	Two thumbs up.
7047000	7053000	Tigerclaw gives us some links and one of them is kind of, well, they're both kind of sad, actually.
7053000	7054000	Let me read this first one here.
7054000	7059000	Starcraft 2 cost a hundred million to make.
7059000	7061000	Wow.
7061000	7063000	That apparently is according to the Wall Street Journal.
7063000	7068000	Activision Blizzard spent a hundred million dollars on the three-part sequel.
7068000	7071000	Where did all that money go?
7071000	7074000	Oh, my God.
7074000	7077000	I guess this game's going to be epic beyond epic.
7077000	7080000	Purely development and that has nothing to do with marketing.
7080000	7084000	It exceeds Gran Turismo 5's 60 million development cost.
7084000	7086000	They'll make it all bad.
7086000	7088000	That's the sick part.
7088000	7090000	Let's see, also from Tigerclaw.
7090000	7094000	Killer gets two life sentences in an Xbox motivated murder.
7094000	7098000	I hate stories like these because usually they have nothing, I mean, no offense to Tigerclaw
7098000	7100000	because he's pulling it from a game blog.
7100000	7107000	But I just, I hate that this stuff gets tied to gaming at all because it's just that this guy's just sick.
7107000	7112000	Some sicko killed people and it somehow involved an Xbox.
7112000	7119000	His name is Kyle Sebastian Scott, 19 years old, and he killed a 22-year-old in January of last year.
7119000	7126000	He hit his body in a ravine near a hiking trail in Colorado Springs.
7126000	7130000	Apparently he wanted the guy's Xbox and killed the guy.
7130000	7132000	Oh, this is even better.
7132000	7136000	Jason Holly, the victim, 22 years old, developmentally disabled.
7136000	7138000	Terrible.
7138000	7141000	And the judge said he trusted you, he would have given you anything, and he did.
7141000	7145000	You could have taken the Xbox and he would have never told anybody.
7145000	7147000	He was trying to be normal, a buddy, or one of the guys.
7147000	7149000	Two life sentences.
7149000	7152000	Not enough. Not enough.
7152000	7154000	Spazinator's sending us an update.
7154000	7157000	Remember he called in last week to talk about his Sony woes?
7157000	7158000	Update, update.
7158000	7164000	Sony Computer Entertainment of America finally gave back my remaining 55 videos this past Monday.
7164000	7165000	Woo, that's a lot.
7165000	7167000	Still rather pissed that it took so damn long.
7167000	7172000	They actually called me as they were doing it so I could confirm if they had everything.
7172000	7175000	Well, that's kind of nice, I guess. At least they did that.
7175000	7182000	Jay Jugo on Twitter is listening to some old episodes of OLR. I guess this is a never forget kind of moment.
7182000	7184000	Hey guys, here's a funny flashback.
7184000	7187000	Procrastination is like masturbation.
7187000	7190000	It feels good until you realize you fucked yourself.
7190000	7192000	Irene said that quote on your sixth episode.
7192000	7194000	Just wanted to share that flashback moment with you guys.
7194000	7196000	Keep up the great work.
7196000	7198000	Nice.
7198000	7200000	Old school OLR. They do exist out there.
7200000	7202000	They're out there if you know where to look.
7202000	7205000	The pictures are now finally on the website.
7205000	7212000	Apparently, well, my initial email bounced because apparently there's too many pictures attached.
7212000	7214000	So now I'm sending them two at a time.
7214000	7218000	So remember folks, if you're going to upload pictures to the website, do so in small quantities.
7218000	7221000	Because the email may not be able to handle it.
7221000	7224000	But now you can see pictures of Baby Room and they're right there in the header of OrangetownsRudy.com.
7224000	7229000	Yes, they are up on top. In fact, I'm just waiting for the last two to refresh on here.
7229000	7230000	Take a look.
7230000	7232000	And they're awesome.
7232000	7237000	Actually, if you look at the gallery, you can see my progress of last week, which was not much progress.
7237000	7246000	Dark Tetsuya says, anyone be interested in an OLR game in the same style of the Journey coin-op?
7246000	7248000	I've been wanting to do that for quite some time.
7248000	7251000	That would be awesome if you could actually do it.
7251000	7254000	That is no small programming feat.
7254000	7256000	That would be cool.
7256000	7258000	Yes, of course. I'd love that.
7258000	7260000	The Journey arcade game is rad.
7260000	7263000	It's a classic game of the week now. It's official.
7263000	7268000	And lastly, Retertainment. What nerd thing makes you think of an old TV show?
7268000	7273000	Mine is the red-green show after the duct tape iPhone 4 fix.
7273000	7275000	That's a tough question.
7275000	7277000	What nerd thing makes you think of an old TV show?
7277000	7279000	I brought up Mr. Wizard yesterday.
7279000	7281000	Why did I bring up Mr. Wizard?
7281000	7283000	Because somebody then tried to say Mr. Wizard hated...
7283000	7284000	That was me.
7284000	7289000	What did I say in response to Mr. Wizard? I don't know.
7289000	7292000	You said you thought he was dead.
7292000	7294000	He is dead, isn't he?
7294000	7295000	I don't know.
7295000	7298000	I don't know. Forget it.
7298000	7300000	Mr. Wizard never really dies.
7300000	7304000	You see, he's figured out a way to become one with the Force.
7304000	7306000	He's just going to disappear into a robe.
7306000	7310000	Well, I just thought about Finders Keepers, thinking about the Xbox store earlier.
7310000	7312000	So I guess it does happen once in a while when I think of old TV shows.
7312000	7315000	Is there something nerdy that makes you think of an old TV show?
7315000	7321000	The status of the gaming industry and the show Bonkers.
7321000	7325000	I think that's pretty close there.
7325000	7328000	A coworker said this to me the other day, and I like this.
7328000	7331000	This really has nothing to do with gaming or nerd.
7331000	7338000	But she said, you know, sometimes my life here feels like the dinosaurs TV show and that little baby.
7338000	7341000	Not the mama. Not the mama.
7341000	7343000	I don't know. It's funny to me.
7343000	7345000	That is pretty funny, Rob.
7345000	7348000	Anything you want to add, Dark Soccer?
7348000	7355000	Well, I don't know. Usually I think about my job and all I can think about is...
7355000	7359000	What was that?
7359000	7361000	Running Man.
7361000	7362000	Blade Runner?
7362000	7364000	No, Running Man.
7364000	7371000	One where he's trapped in a game show and to get out he has to escape.
7371000	7376000	Richard Dawson was the villain. That was awesome.
7376000	7377000	Yes, now I know.
7377000	7379000	The best part about that movie.
7379000	7383000	Alright. Let's move on with some more news. Back to gaming news.
7383000	7388000	That's almost as cool as Mega Race with Don Knotts or something I think was the villain in that.
7388000	7391000	Don Knotts was not in that, was he?
7391000	7395000	There was somebody who was like Don Knotts in that game.
7395000	7397000	In that game?
7397000	7400000	It was weird. No, Don Knotts was not in the Running Man.
7400000	7406000	That would have been even more epic. Don Knotts should have been one of the killers in the Running Man.
7406000	7408000	That would have been cool.
7408000	7414000	Tigerclaw, by the way, says Mr. Wizard died in 2007. Don Herbert. Just so you know.
7414000	7415000	In case you weren't aware, Mr. Wizard...
7415000	7416000	And he hated kids.
7416000	7418000	He did not hate kids.
7418000	7420000	Yes, he did.
7420000	7423000	He loved kids as much as Mel Gibson loved his wife and daughter.
7423000	7426000	Alright, back to news stories.
7426000	7429000	Don't get me started. He's an ass-wife.
7429000	7433000	Don't even. Just pull back. Move along. Nothing to see here.
7433000	7435000	That name is banned from the show.
7435000	7437000	Move along. Nothing to see here.
7437000	7440000	Low-key, back to gaming.
7440000	7446000	Mega Man Universe is apparently a game that's coming out on the Playstation Network and Xbox Live Arcade.
7446000	7451000	They had a little teaser trailer that came out this week that featured absolutely no gameplay whatsoever.
7451000	7455000	But it kind of gave us an idea of what we may expect.
7455000	7466000	Apparently, the game will actually combine universes in different Capcom game universes.
7466000	7477000	The teaser trailer showed, at one point, a stop-motion animation of Ryu, Arthur, from the Ghosts and...
7477000	7481000	I'm saying it the Western way, okay? The improper way.
7481000	7483000	You're wrong!
7483000	7490000	Fine. Ryu and Arthur from the Ghosts and Ghouls and Ghosts and Goblins series.
7490000	7492000	And, of course, Mega Man.
7492000	7496000	Facing off against a bunch of Mega Man villains.
7496000	7506000	So either I'm guessing that Mega Man's going to get powers from these other players or the other game heroes.
7506000	7511000	Or he's going to be teaming up, I guess, with...
7511000	7521000	Kind of think of the Super Mario crossover, but the Super Capcom crossover with all these different characters from different series facing off against Mega Man characters.
7521000	7526000	Or, perhaps, facing off against Capcom universe characters.
7526000	7531000	Although, then you would wonder why it's called Mega Man universe and not Capcom universe.
7531000	7535000	Can I play this trailer? Because I haven't even seen this yet.
7535000	7538000	I've been waiting until tonight's show to watch this.
7538000	7540000	This is only about a minute or two, right?
7540000	7541000	It's short.
7541000	7544000	Okay, so I've got to go into the studio right now.
7544000	7548000	Capcom! Yay, Capcom!
7548000	7551000	Bored down. Here we go.
7551000	7554000	Ooh, I approve of the music.
7554000	7559000	Why is, like, some kid sleeping? That has nothing to do with Mega Man.
7559000	7563000	It's Toy Story Mega Man.
7563000	7565000	Bored down.
7565000	7577000	Oh, it's 20XX.
7577000	7581000	Man, there's something else I forgot at the very end that's kind of cool.
7581000	7584000	Cut man.
7584000	7589000	I'm turning this down a little bit so I can talk for it.
7589000	7594000	Well, it looks cool. Too bad this is all, like, a pre-rendered thing that the actual game's not going to look like.
7594000	7597000	It looks like stop-motion animation.
7597000	7600000	Sweet!
7600000	7609000	What?
7609000	7614000	That little kid's probably on drugs.
7614000	7617000	This is going to be, you know what this looks like to me?
7617000	7619000	Can I tell you what this honestly, like, I think right now?
7619000	7623000	No, it looks like the Mega Man fighting game.
7623000	7628000	But it's going to be like Capcom's own version of Capcom vs. Capcom.
7628000	7633000	If that makes any sense. That's the first impression I get of what this is.
7633000	7644000	Wait a minute.
7644000	7645000	He's also quite, like...
7645000	7649000	Watch this, this is awesome.
7649000	7652000	Okay.
7652000	7656000	So he's still in bed. Mega Man universe.
7656000	7659000	Your world. Mega-fide.
7659000	7672000	That's great.
7672000	7674000	That was the old Mega Man box art guy?
7674000	7675000	Yeah.
7675000	7678000	They're going to have the Mega Man box art Mega Man.
7678000	7679000	I don't get it!
7679000	7681000	Suck man.
7681000	7687000	I don't get it. I felt like that was a waste of two minutes of show.
7687000	7689000	Welcome to any two minutes of this show.
7689000	7691000	I don't know. Alpha-Can-Anagram, you asked me a question.
7691000	7693000	Why are they fighting only Mega Man bad guys, though?
7693000	7695000	I don't know. I have no idea.
7695000	7696000	It doesn't...
7696000	7701000	I seriously think it's like one of those, like the Nintendo, the Super Mario crossover.
7701000	7702000	It's going to be like that.
7702000	7704000	Why can't we just have Rockman power battles?
7704000	7706000	Just do a new one of those.
7706000	7708000	Because that wasn't very good.
7708000	7710000	I liked it.
7710000	7711000	It's like one of the few games...
7711000	7714000	The arcade version of it. That was so cool.
7714000	7715000	Alright.
7715000	7718000	You just need to do a game just storing bass.
7718000	7724000	What they need to do is they need to do a Mega Man game that's very similar to the upcoming Castlevania game.
7724000	7730000	You know, with like 16 players at the same time fighting Mega Man characters.
7730000	7731000	Alpha-Can-Anagram says,
7731000	7736000	Sky, imagine possibly Mega Man mixed with LittleBigPlanet with Mega Man powered up level editor.
7736000	7739000	Well, that sounds awesome, but I don't think that's what this is.
7739000	7741000	If it is though, hey, it might be fun.
7741000	7742000	Actually, it might be a lot of fun.
7742000	7744000	Is this only supposed to be download though?
7744000	7745000	Like it's a live arcade in PlayStation 3?
7745000	7747000	Live arcade in PlayStation Network, yeah.
7747000	7748000	Alright.
7748000	7750000	Let's move on with some more stories.
7750000	7753000	And this is something about something the Xbox is losing.
7753000	7755000	Microsoft cancelled 1 versus 100.
7755000	7756000	That's right.
7756000	7758000	There's not going to be a third season of 1 versus 100.
7758000	7761000	This is confirmed with Xbox...
7761000	7765000	Sorry, Microsoft Game Studios General Manager Dave McCarthy saying,
7765000	7772000	quote, we're very proud of the 1 versus 100 team and their accomplishments and are excited to apply what we've learned to future programming.
7772000	7774000	And yep, it's on the Xbox.com.
7774000	7776000	A fond farewell.
7776000	7777000	That's it.
7777000	7778000	Aw, that sucks.
7778000	7783000	They're going to have Mega Man foam Mega Busters or whatever at Comic Con they're giving away.
7783000	7784000	Do you not even care?
7784000	7786000	The 1 versus 100 is gone?
7786000	7787000	No, I don't care.
7787000	7788000	All you can think about is Mega Man?
7788000	7790000	Ugh.
7790000	7796000	Never forget, there is something funny, Xbox Live Prime Time, whatever the fuck happened to that.
7796000	7798000	Well, that's my point.
7798000	7800000	That stuff sounded so exciting.
7800000	7803000	Hey, we're going to have the service that's going to blow away all the competition.
7803000	7805000	And we're going to cancel it.
7805000	7811000	It's going to make your Xbox Live Gold Account more worthwhile than just paying to play against other people.
7811000	7814000	But it came down to where they couldn't get advertisers.
7814000	7818000	Yeah, that's the buzz I'm hearing too is that it was always a Sprint commercial.
7818000	7820000	In a while you might see another one, but that was mostly it.
7820000	7823000	So they just couldn't get the advertisers to give away the prizes.
7823000	7824000	But you know what, I think there would be...
7824000	7826000	Call me crazy.
7826000	7830000	But I think there would be a lot of people that would still play the game, not even for prizes.
7830000	7835000	I mean, when you went into the non-live rounds, which didn't give away anything but points really,
7835000	7838000	and supposedly more of a chance to play in the live rounds,
7838000	7842000	there would still be like 10-20,000 people on at any time.
7842000	7845000	I mean, you can't tell me that stuff is that expensive to run.
7845000	7846000	Really?
7846000	7848000	I mean, I guess they have a question writing staff.
7848000	7852000	And why can't you get advertisers? I see advertisers for stuff all the time.
7852000	7854000	Like, there's different movies that they're promoting on there.
7854000	7856000	There's different stuff.
7856000	7858000	Where's Axe Body Spray?
7858000	7861000	Just do a crossover. Get the Old Spice guy in there.
7861000	7862000	Mountain Dew.
7862000	7866000	Old Spice is very up on the new technology stuff. Get him in there.
7866000	7868000	That last marketing campaign was brilliant.
7868000	7870000	Brilliant. Who doesn't love that guy?
7870000	7873000	My favorite thing, I'm on a horse.
7873000	7874000	Did you see all the YouTube videos?
7874000	7875000	I didn't see the new ones, yeah.
7875000	7877000	Oh, you got to see the marriage proposal. That's the best one.
7877000	7879000	Monty Boggs in our chat room says,
7879000	7882000	Microsoft always promises cool stuff to live and then never does it
7882000	7884000	when they realize it requires work.
7884000	7892000	You know, it's just disappointing because they didn't really announce what is next.
7892000	7895000	I think that would soften the blow a little bit if they were like,
7895000	7898000	well, sadly we're losing 1 versus 100 because, you know, licensing,
7898000	7901000	they're going to make it a real show again, which by the way is also a rumor
7901000	7904000	that 1 versus 100 is actually coming back to TV
7904000	7906000	because of the success of Xbox.
7906000	7908000	Weird, right?
7908000	7910000	I know, right? I don't think it'll be the same thing.
7910000	7912000	It's not going to be Bob Saget and NBC.
7912000	7914000	I'm thinking like Game Show Network.
7914000	7917000	I actually, I read blogs about game shows. Leave me alone.
7917000	7920000	Hey, Rob, that's one of the reasons we love you.
7920000	7922000	I know.
7922000	7923000	I just, I don't know.
7923000	7926000	But if they'd come out and said, okay, we're canceling 1 versus 100,
7926000	7930000	but we are bringing you, I don't know, The Price is Right
7930000	7935000	or Family Feud or hell, Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy, anything.
7935000	7937000	I can play The Price is Right.
7937000	7939000	People would be excited about that.
7939000	7941000	And I don't even think you have to give away prizes.
7941000	7944000	Give away E-peen and people will still line up.
7944000	7948000	Give away achievements. Give away shout-outs on websites, leaderboards.
7948000	7950000	People will play for E-peen.
7950000	7952000	Here's the opportunity now.
7952000	7956000	Make something very similar to, say, PlayStation Home
7956000	7958000	and you can have the prizes in your living room.
7958000	7960000	Hey, look at this virtual.
7960000	7962000	Oh, my God, why aren't you working for Microsoft?
7962000	7964000	That's brilliant.
7964000	7966000	Brilliant.
7966000	7971000	Win avatar items and themes and cool stuff.
7971000	7973000	You could do it.
7973000	7976000	You don't have to give away a free game or points.
7976000	7979000	I want a free game and points and a car.
7979000	7981000	Well, I mean, you know, that's nice.
7981000	7984000	Maybe give that away to, like, the season-long winner
7984000	7987000	and it won't cost as much out of the prize budget.
7987000	7990000	AJ Mix in our chat room. Double Dare featuring Natal.
7990000	7992000	Why aren't you people working for Microsoft?
7992000	7995000	These are brilliant ideas. Brilliant.
7995000	7997000	Won't happen.
7997000	8002000	I don't know. Here's a thought. Make up your own game show.
8002000	8006000	You know, get somebody out there who's got to be creating these game shows.
8006000	8009000	Hire him. Make your own damn game show.
8009000	8011000	Make a new Xbox Live game show.
8011000	8013000	Yeah, I'd love that idea.
8013000	8018000	You could maybe even, like, broadcast some stuff on MSNBC or something.
8018000	8020000	Or, you know, one of the companies that you own.
8020000	8024000	Fucking stream it on the internet. Have, like, uh...
8024000	8026000	Have something. I don't know.
8026000	8028000	I love this. Monty Boggs.
8028000	8030000	Are you smarter than a fifth grader?
8030000	8033000	Were all the little kids in Halo are the fifth graders?
8033000	8037000	You know, there is a fifth grader game on Xbox Live.
8037000	8039000	Are you smarter than a fifth grader?
8039000	8041000	It's on all the systems, I think.
8041000	8043000	But it's not, you know, interactive.
8043000	8046000	I was really excited about Xbox Prime Time.
8046000	8048000	And it's really disappointing that it's just like,
8048000	8050000	Eh, well, you know, it didn't work. Bye.
8050000	8052000	So I really hope they come out and say,
8052000	8056000	Yes, we've been working on another project and it's still part of Xbox Prime Time.
8056000	8062000	But it makes me nervous when they come out at E3 and don't say a damn thing about it.
8062000	8064000	That should have been the sign right there.
8064000	8066000	They didn't say a damn thing about it at E3.
8066000	8068000	It wasn't like, Oh, you hope you liked 1 vs. 100.
8068000	8071000	Or, you know, but now we're going to bring you Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune!
8071000	8073000	Or something like that.
8073000	8077000	Well, you know, Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune! games were being shown off on the Wii.
8077000	8079000	Somewhere else.
8079000	8082000	Yep, I know there's Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune! games coming up this year.
8082000	8085000	Actually, the Wii's been getting a lot of those game shows.
8085000	8087000	They have The Price is Right and Press Your Luck.
8087000	8089000	The Wii's the place for game shows right now.
8089000	8091000	It's not live and interactive.
8091000	8094000	Oh my god, think of the possibilities.
8094000	8096000	Rob, don't cry.
8096000	8098000	I'm just...
8098000	8100000	It's just...
8100000	8102000	What the fuck are they smoking?
8102000	8104000	I don't know.
8104000	8108000	You can buy PlayStation Plus and maybe you'll get to pay somebody else to watch Hulu.
8108000	8110000	What's it going to...
8110000	8112000	They don't make any sense.
8112000	8114000	They do not.
8114000	8116000	When are the good ideas going to stick?
8116000	8118000	They just couldn't make money off of 1 vs. 100.
8118000	8122000	They weren't making enough in advertising to just buy PlayStation Plus.
8122000	8124000	I bet they could have charged...
8124000	8127000	Well, they're making the money off Xbox Gold.
8127000	8130000	They're making the money off Xbox Gold, subscribers.
8130000	8132000	There's other ways they could do it.
8134000	8137000	I don't believe the subscribers were giving them that much money.
8137000	8139000	It's about selling.
8139000	8141000	I know people who bought it at Xbox just to play that game.
8141000	8143000	They've got to be pissed.
8143000	8145000	They make the money back in other ways.
8145000	8147000	It's dumb. Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.
8147000	8150000	Yeah, but that's a different reason to buy an Xbox, too, if you ask me.
8150000	8153000	Yeah, but that's a different reason to buy an Xbox, too, if you ask me.
8153000	8155000	So she just pops in chat and says,
8155000	8159000	Rob wants a Big Brother port for Wii with a throttle-that-bitch Wiimote mechanic.
8159000	8165000	I would totally play Survivor on Xbox Live if it was, like, somehow real.
8165000	8167000	What?
8167000	8169000	There's a Survivor game coming out on the Wii.
8169000	8171000	It's going to be stupid.
8171000	8173000	It's not going to be online or anything.
8173000	8175000	It's going to be like the horrible PC games that were out.
8175000	8177000	At least the PC games.
8177000	8179000	I think one of the PC games you could actually play on the internet.
8179000	8182000	Probably it's going to be a port of the PC game.
8182000	8184000	Dumb, dumb, dumb.
8184000	8186000	Well, the last PC game came out a long time ago.
8186000	8188000	Yeah, that'll probably be a port of the PC game.
8188000	8190000	Alright, let's move on.
8190000	8193000	That's frightening.
8193000	8196000	Moving on, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
8196000	8200000	Well, there is some stuff.
8200000	8205000	As soon as my, you know, system decides to stop being crappy.
8205000	8209000	I was also, you know, completely enamored with the whack-a-kitty.
8209000	8213000	Thank you, SSJ100Matt, for completely derailing the show.
8213000	8215000	We appreciate you.
8215000	8217000	With your cute kittens.
8217000	8219000	No, because my thing-okay, there it is.
8219000	8224000	I'm sorry. Well, actually, what was going on was that my window decided to hide itself.
8224000	8225000	Yay.
8225000	8228000	And my brain is broken. Doesn't work.
8228000	8234000	Anyway, how about some news about poor, poor Nintendo?
8234000	8236000	Can we have some sad music, Rob?
8236000	8238000	Some sad music?
8238000	8240000	Well, you didn't request this in advance.
8240000	8242000	Well, how about just break out a kazoo?
8242000	8244000	Hold on, hold on.
8248000	8252000	It's because I feel for them.
8252000	8254000	Sad music, you got it. Here we go.
8254000	8256000	Some sad music for Jamie's story.
8256000	8260000	Sigh.
8260000	8266000	There's an announcement made by the Nintendo UK General Manager.
8266000	8268000	His name is David Yarnton.
8268000	8274000	That demand for the Wii and the DS has declined.
8274000	8286000	He blamed the falling demand for the Wii and DS on the, quote, cycle.
8286000	8290000	And the recession in saying everybody's in the same boat.
8290000	8294000	We are not recession proof, he says.
8294000	8298000	We've probably, as an industry, been better than other industries.
8298000	8303000	We thought we would be selling more, but we're not, pretty much.
8303000	8309000	Um, yeah, that's really not the case of worlds in the world so much.
8309000	8312000	But there's light, Rob, there's light at the end of the tunnel.
8312000	8315000	We're waiting on the 3DS.
8315000	8317000	That's what they're saying.
8325000	8327000	We had to let that go.
8327000	8332000	Yeah, they're waiting on the 3DS because you don't need glasses.
8332000	8337000	Um, and he also, though, denied that Nintendo has been forced to slash prices.
8337000	8339000	But, um, yeah.
8342000	8345000	Alas, Nintendo. Alas.
8351000	8355000	I can't help ending up here drinking ginger ale.
8357000	8359000	What?
8359000	8363000	Just your perfect cap to destroy, alas, Nintendo.
8365000	8367000	What is wrong with you?
8371000	8379000	Salacious pop in our chatroom says, now I'm imagining Reggie in tears floating on a wooden plank saying, never let go, Wii. Never let go.
8381000	8383000	And then one of his thumbs break off.
8385000	8387000	Uh, yeah.
8387000	8389000	Uh, yeah.
8389000	8391000	Uh, the kinectix-
8391000	8396000	No, no, no, no, guys, I got, I got, um, I got some, uh, advice here for Nintendo.
8396000	8400000	Um, here you go, Nintendo, I have some advice for you, okay?
8400000	8427000	Keep holding on, cause you know I'll make it through, I'll make it through. Just stay strong, cause you know I'm here for you, I'm here for you. There's nothing you can say.
8427000	8430000	Sorry about that. You just took it too far there. Yeah, I did. You went too far.
8430000	8431000	Yep. Let the, let the-
8431000	8434000	Should've just let it. Yeah, should've just left it with that, I know, I know.
8434000	8437000	Sequels are never as good as the original, they're really not.
8438000	8440000	I hear that Titanic 2's gonna be awesome, though.
8440000	8442000	Um, kinectix-
8442000	8445000	Three more hours of the ship sinking.
8446000	8447000	The ship sinks again.
8447000	8452000	You think it sunk and everyone died. They really went to a magical town under the water.
8452000	8457000	We found it! It's Titanic Atlantis!
8462000	8465000	Atlantastic? Oh, I can do it.
8465000	8481000	Um, anyways, uh, the kinectix experience tour, coming to your town soon, um, they are traveling around the country, um, on the east coast and on the west coast, showing off a bunch of different kinect games including kinectimals, kinect sports, kinect joyride, kinect adventures,
8481000	8485000	and Dance Central, the only game without kinect in the title.
8485000	8493000	And, um, they will be doing this, um, very close until launch of the actual kinect on November 4th.
8493000	8505000	So, some notable east coast, uh, locations, let's see, um, actually starting earlier of this, or, well, uh, yesterday and today, they were at Macy's!
8505000	8510000	You probably didn't see them because they were at Macy's, so, but if you-
8510000	8512000	I like Macy's!
8512000	8515000	If you just happened to go there, then you might have seen it.
8515000	8523000	Um, some other notable places, uh, August 4th through the 6th, they're going to be in Canton, Ohio at the Football Hall of Fame Rib Burn-Off.
8523000	8528000	Okay, well that makes sense, Football Hall of Fame, okay, that seems to be a good place to go, alright.
8528000	8542000	Okay, um, let's see, October, was it, uh, October 1st and 2nd, Orlando, Florida, the Disney Wine and Dine Marathon.
8542000	8548000	Disney has a wine and dine marathon? Is that like the wine thing they do at California Adventure?
8548000	8557000	No, I think that's, like, remember how Disney in, um, Orlando has a lot of those fancy adult places where you can go taste wine in fancy restaurants and shit like that?
8557000	8558000	Okay.
8558000	8565000	Yeah, there. Um, and then October 4th, 14th and the 17th, or through the 17th, uh, you can check it out at the Texas State Fair.
8565000	8570000	Or, October 21st through the 24th at the Louisiana State Fair.
8570000	8573000	Uh, what other state fairs are they going to be hitting up as well?
8573000	8580000	Uh, Minnesota State Fair, Tennessee State Fair, uh, I know the California State Fair.
8580000	8585000	Oh, my, I was going to say, really, because I'm like, the California State Fair is going on right now here in lovely Sacramento.
8585000	8586000	Are they going to be there, really?
8586000	8591000	Yes, July 28th through August 1st at the California State Fair. Almost worth going.
8591000	8599000	Almost. Almost worth going and getting subjected to getting shot by a gang. Almost.
8599000	8600000	Uh, also.
8600000	8608000	There's two things you can count on at the California State Fair. The smell of animal poop and gang shootings. Every year.
8608000	8617000	You know, this is a surprise to me, but I never knew that Minnesota was on the west coast, but apparently they're going to be at the Mall of America from July 15th to August 22nd.
8617000	8621000	That's a pretty long-ass time there. So, Mall of America, that's your place to go.
8621000	8625000	You'd think they'd have the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America.
8625000	8638000	Exactly. Um, what other state fair? Colorado State Fair, Utah State Fair, New Mexico State Fair. They're going to be at the Universal City Walk on September 24th through 26th.
8638000	8645000	And, uh, October 7th through the 11th, San Francisco Fleet Week.
8645000	8650000	And, uh, oh, the Arizona State Fair.
8650000	8660000	So, yes, a bunch of different dates. They have it, actually. Um, you can check it out on, um, Facebook. Facebook.com slash connect or the Gamerscore blog.
8660000	8666000	Uh, they've got the dates posted there as well, or a lot of the gaming sites, too, in case you're interested in checking it out.
8666000	8673000	I might be interested in checking out the state fair, but, my God, it's a state fair and I have to go there and it's hot outside.
8673000	8674000	It's hot.
8674000	8675000	It's so hot.
8675000	8676000	It is. It's hot.
8676000	8679000	And, seriously, the state fair sucks.
8679000	8684000	Slacious Pop in chat is asking me, can we go this weekend and get deep fried foods and ride on Spin-A-Hurl rides?
8684000	8689000	And I'm like, honestly, my first reaction is like, no.
8689000	8693000	No, we can't. I don't know. I, the state fair is okay.
8693000	8700000	It might be neat to check out, but, honestly, um, Dance Central will be the only game I might be kind of interested in checking out, but.
8700000	8705000	How, how would you go? There's no way in hell you're going to be able to take the wife to the state fair. It's way too hot out.
8705000	8707000	I'll just convince the coworkers to go.
8707000	8708000	Oh, okay.
8708000	8709000	That's where I'd go myself.
8709000	8711000	I'll go with you, I guess.
8711000	8713000	I'm not going, dude. Okay, let me put it this way.
8713000	8716000	Let's break this down here. July 28th through August 1st.
8716000	8721000	There is a good percentage chance that the baby will be here by then.
8721000	8722000	I will not be going anywhere.
8722000	8724000	You're going to be too busy changing poopy diapers.
8724000	8729000	Jamie, save a Vicodin and then take it and we'll go.
8729000	8732000	If you pay for me to get in, I'll go.
8732000	8733000	Maybe.
8733000	8734000	Okay.
8734000	8737000	Do we still have OLR funds? Maybe the show can pay for us.
8737000	8740000	Um, yeah, it's sitting right there on top of.
8740000	8742000	We're on assignment. Alright, fine.
8742000	8743000	Rob.
8743000	8748000	What? And apparently Alan wants to go, so we could maybe do it next weekend. I can't go this weekend.
8748000	8750000	Well, next weekend I've got plans on Sunday.
8750000	8753000	But Saturday, Saturday afternoon, I don't.
8753000	8755000	July 28th through the August 1st.
8755000	8756000	Is next weekend, right?
8756000	8758000	We need to go on August 1st. You know why?
8758000	8759000	Why?
8759000	8762000	Because that's the last day of the fair and it's weird Al.
8762000	8768000	Uh, that's, it's, it's a week from next week from this upcoming weekend.
8768000	8770000	So August 1st is what, a Sunday?
8770000	8771000	It would be.
8771000	8772000	We have a show that night.
8772000	8773000	Uh, yeah, Sunday.
8773000	8774000	We have a show that night.
8774000	8776000	Well, it's the 28th though, that's like.
8776000	8779000	A show live from the state fair, is it possible?
8779000	8780000	Maybe.
8780000	8781000	No.
8781000	8782000	I don't think it is.
8782000	8784000	We can just record, ring the, I found the little recorder.
8784000	8787000	It's like, it's state fair, it's hot.
8787000	8792000	Look, there's a lot of things that I would call off a show for.
8792000	8794000	I've called off a show to go to Disneyland.
8794000	8797000	I've called off a show to go to various expos.
8797000	8800000	I would not call off a show to go to the freaking state fair.
8800000	8802000	Like, I just, it's just.
8802000	8804000	It's just too tacky.
8804000	8807000	I've gone to, um, what was it?
8807000	8811000	It was a, I don't remember what the fair was.
8811000	8818000	It was some sort of like rib cook-off and like country music fair thing that was down
8818000	8822000	by a Rayleigh Field to see rock band two.
8822000	8823000	And I did that one time.
8823000	8826000	I saw rock band at the state fair actually a couple of years ago.
8826000	8827000	Yeah.
8827000	8828000	Yeah.
8828000	8833000	Was that, that was the same night that I broke up with that asshole.
8833000	8835000	That was the same night.
8835000	8837000	Oh my God.
8837000	8842000	Wow, this show took a tumble.
8842000	8844000	Where's sad trombone?
8844000	8846000	Hey, next story.
8846000	8853000	Something a lot happier than horrible experiences at the state fair.
8853000	8855000	I saw a guy land on his head.
8855000	8858000	Hopefully, hopefully this won't be the same experience.
8858000	8859000	A haunted house.
8859000	8863000	This is an old ass Atari 2600 game.
8863000	8867000	An old ass Atari 2600 game that was out many years ago.
8867000	8869000	It's actually out on game room now if you want to re-experience it.
8869000	8872000	They call it the original survival horror game.
8872000	8873000	Not really.
8873000	8874000	No.
8874000	8875000	No.
8875000	8879000	Basically you like could hit a button and make things illuminate around you and sometimes
8879000	8882000	scary things would show up like spiders and stuff.
8882000	8884000	But you were trying to collect things.
8884000	8889000	Well, they are completely revamping this game and it's coming out for the Wii, Xbox Live
8889000	8891000	Arcade and PC.
8891000	8896000	It's being developed by Imagine Engine who's a kids game designer.
8896000	8900000	And it's actually about the original character's grandkids going back to the haunted house
8900000	8902000	and it's basically kind of a very similar plot.
8902000	8906000	And I got to admit, looking at the graphics it looks very kid-ish.
8906000	8913000	But I guess it's kind of cool that they're bringing out the old games and making new ones.
8913000	8918000	I hope there's some other old ass Atari games that they maybe do this to.
8918000	8919000	But I don't know.
8919000	8921000	Maybe this is one of those games you might fire up once and go,
8921000	8922000	Oh, that's cute.
8922000	8923000	And then probably never play again.
8923000	8925000	Uh, they're actually...
8925000	8927000	Are there other ones they're talking about?
8927000	8928000	There's supposed to be other ones.
8928000	8931000	I thought I had heard something about that there were other games they were thinking about.
8931000	8933000	Centipede.
8933000	8934000	Really?
8934000	8935000	Yeah, I saw a game for Centipede.
8935000	8936000	I'm like, really?
8936000	8937000	Hmm.
8937000	8938000	What the hell are they going to do with Centipede?
8938000	8940000	I think this is not Frogger.
8940000	8941000	Human Centipede?
8941000	8944000	No, it's not Human Centipede.
8944000	8945000	Um, there was another one too.
8945000	8947000	I don't remember what it was.
8947000	8951000	But Centipede was one of the games.
8951000	8955000	It was also leaked out on Gamefly.
8955000	8956000	They had it.
8956000	8960000	Because everyone trusts Gamefly over me.
8960000	8961000	Sad days.
8961000	8967000	Alright, I think we need to move on with our show and get into the mailbag.
8967000	8977000	Every week you guys send us emails and we read them here on the program to our much amusement.
8977000	8982000	Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com and we're going to answer your questions that you've emailed us.
8982000	8984000	Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com.
8984000	8986000	Sometimes you guys share funny stories and things of that sort.
8986000	8988000	So, let's get to it.
8988000	8989000	Dark Soccer is going to read some emails.
8989000	8994000	Um, we've got three to go through and I'm going to start with the shortest of them first.
8994000	8998000	Well, kind of the second shortest but the other one's got some stuff.
8998000	8999000	Hey, OLR!
8999000	9001000	Pliskin here to ask a few questions.
9001000	9006000	First, if you could be in any video game, which would it be and why?
9006000	9013000	Um, if I had to, I'd be in Sims 3 so that I could have an infinity code so that I'd never get hungry.
9013000	9015000	Um, I could never age.
9015000	9016000	Never.
9016000	9022000	And I could decide how hot the person I want to look like and everything.
9022000	9031000	I would be in Animal Crossing so I could get rewarded with refrigerators and dressers and radios for running people's mail to the post office.
9031000	9033000	Loki.
9033000	9040000	Um, I don't know.
9040000	9042000	I wouldn't really want to be in any game.
9042000	9045000	Mega Man Universe because that looks retarded.
9045000	9047000	I don't know. I don't have a good answer.
9047000	9048000	I'd also want to be-
9048000	9051000	I know, Totem Ball because it is such an awesome game.
9051000	9053000	But you were in Totem Ball!
9053000	9058000	Oh my god! Mind blown!
9058000	9060000	Second, I know you guys bash-
9060000	9062000	Wait, wait, wait. I'd also want to be in Pokemon.
9062000	9063000	Just saying.
9063000	9064000	Okay.
9064000	9066000	Score it all. Score it all.
9066000	9075000	Second, I know you guys bash on Facebook Gaming, but believe it or not, there are some fun games on Facebook like My Hero's Ability and thousands of poker games.
9075000	9076000	So my question is what gives?
9076000	9080000	As in, maybe you're into those games, but I don't think we are.
9080000	9083000	I don't hate all Facebook games. Jamie, you admitted to playing one.
9083000	9089000	I played Farmville for like a week, okay? A moment of weakness. It was dumb. I was young and naive.
9089000	9091000	I think I played Bejeweled Blitz once.
9091000	9092000	Yeah, Bejeweled Blitz is cool.
9092000	9100000	Um, I don't hate on Facebook games a lot. I mean, I think the whole social networking gaming thing is kind of retarded.
9100000	9102000	And that's kind of stupid. It sounds like an old man saying,
9102000	9112000	Oh, get your fancy electronic shit. Um, but no, it's really, I don't understand what the point is. Like, hey, look, you know, hey, I sent you unicorn. Send me something.
9112000	9118000	I hate it when people send me shit in Facebook. I delete it. I do not forward anything.
9118000	9125000	I think that's it. It's not Facebook games we hate. It's Facebook games spam that we hate.
9125000	9129000	I'm all for free games. I just don't like the spam.
9129000	9138000	Yeah, that's annoying. Um, it's like those seriously, those chain mails where it's like, oh, send it to five of your friends and lucky things will happen to you.
9138000	9146000	Um, so I don't hate that. Oh, God, I had a point, but I totally forgot it was in arguing about how Facebook games are.
9146000	9158000	Um, oh, what was it? Oh, my hero's ability. Um, or whatever. That reminds me of like that Stephen Lynch song, Superhero, where he starts like naming off, you know, superheroes.
9158000	9160000	It kind of sounds like Pokemon.
9160000	9166000	Um, Monty Boggs, by the way, is also answering that question about what video game would you want to be in in our chat room at chat.orangehonstray.com.
9166000	9172000	I would want to be in Deal or No Deal. Constant money. There's a Deal or No Deal Facebook game.
9172000	9176000	I think that's the most pointless freaking game in the entire world.
9176000	9178000	I think they're all relatively pointless.
9178000	9183000	Guess the number, but like Deal or No Deal, especially. Guess the number. That's what it is.
9183000	9186000	But Rob, it's Howie Mandel. How can you go wrong there?
9186000	9188000	Don't get me started.
9188000	9189000	It's Howie.
9189000	9190000	Is there more to the email?
9190000	9192000	Yes, there is.
9192000	9194000	Yes, all right.
9194000	9196000	Stupid, stupid Facebook.
9196000	9199000	I am looking forward very much to the Civilization game on Facebook.
9199000	9201000	Because you're a Sith whore.
9201000	9202000	I am.
9202000	9203000	And how.
9203000	9206000	And how, and I can't wait to Sith whore it up with my friends on Facebook. Yay!
9206000	9207000	More!
9207000	9209000	Third is for Loki.
9209000	9213000	You know, I'm trying really not to be so grammar crazy and eh.
9213000	9215000	But.
9215000	9216000	This sucks.
9216000	9218000	Third is for Loki.
9218000	9220000	I found a PSP 1000.
9220000	9222000	I've owned a PSP 1000 for almost a year.
9222000	9225000	And now all of a sudden the D-Pad is freaking out.
9225000	9229000	All I want to do is go right dot dot dot.
9229000	9230000	I used an ellipse okay.
9230000	9232000	All by itself.
9232000	9237000	Now this wouldn't bother me, but it gives me vertigo when playing Dissidia Final Fantasy.
9237000	9240000	Cause the D-Pad controls the camera.
9240000	9245000	My question is can this be fixed or do I have to shell out money to be a new one?
9245000	9247000	To be a new one.
9247000	9248000	You want to be a D-Pad when you grow up.
9248000	9250000	Well we know what video game he wants to be in.
9250000	9251000	Um.
9251000	9252000	Yeah it can be fixed.
9252000	9256000	Because the D-Pad is actually on what they call a ribbon bus cable.
9256000	9258000	Which you cannot solder to unfortunately.
9258000	9259000	I've tried.
9259000	9260000	And it breaks it.
9260000	9261000	Um.
9261000	9264000	But all you have to do is buy the replacement ribbon bus cable.
9264000	9266000	Assuming that that's what's wrong with it.
9266000	9271000	So probably there's like a kink or something where something broke and so now it's just being held down.
9271000	9272000	It could be dirty.
9272000	9273000	You never know.
9273000	9274000	Um.
9274000	9276000	Basically you just have to bust the system open.
9276000	9277000	Um.
9277000	9279000	And possibly replace that.
9279000	9280000	Which those aren't that expensive.
9280000	9283000	You can probably get a set of ribbon bus cables for.
9283000	9287000	I think I bought one for ten to twenty dollars.
9287000	9288000	Maybe.
9288000	9289000	It should be really cheap.
9289000	9291000	Probably under fifteen dollars.
9291000	9292000	Um.
9292000	9296000	So that's all you need to do and you just slide it in there and put it all back together.
9296000	9298000	And it should work.
9298000	9301000	No guarantees though because I don't know if that's exactly what's wrong.
9301000	9302000	It could also be.
9302000	9303000	Um.
9303000	9306000	There could be some sort of bridging going on somewhere else in there.
9306000	9307000	Um.
9307000	9311000	It's hard to say until you bust it open and see what actually is broken in there.
9311000	9312000	But.
9312000	9313000	If it's.
9313000	9315000	If it's the actual D-Pad sticking.
9315000	9318000	Like the controller button is actually sticking down.
9318000	9320000	It's probably dirty and you just need to clean it out.
9320000	9326000	I've seen some friends with PSP's that I've fixed for them that are fucking disgusting.
9326000	9329000	There's just the amount of dirt and grime that's on it.
9329000	9330000	I just like.
9330000	9331000	What do you do?
9331000	9333000	Do you like seriously sweat grease?
9333000	9336000	I mean or sweat like.
9336000	9337000	Axle grease or something.
9337000	9339000	It's ridiculous the amount of dirt that's on there.
9339000	9340000	But yeah.
9340000	9341000	Cleaning.
9341000	9342000	Cleaning your PSP.
9342000	9343000	Try that at first.
9343000	9346000	If that still doesn't work then you may need to replace that ribbon bus cable.
9346000	9349000	If that doesn't work you're probably going to need a PSP.
9349000	9350000	Um.
9350000	9353000	I kind of agree with Legend of Zaku in our chat room.
9353000	9356000	PSP's D-Pad in general is ass.
9356000	9358000	They're better than the.
9358000	9359000	Um.
9359000	9360000	You know.
9360000	9362000	They're better than the Xbox 360 D-Pad.
9362000	9363000	Exactly.
9363000	9364000	That's for sure.
9364000	9365000	Alright.
9365000	9369000	You guys are being mean to the poor Xbox.
9369000	9370000	What else is new tonight?
9370000	9371000	Alright.
9371000	9373000	Was that it for that email or is there more?
9373000	9374000	Um.
9374000	9375000	Final question is for Rob.
9375000	9378000	How would I go about coming out to my family?
9378000	9379000	Wow.
9379000	9380000	Uh.
9380000	9381000	Wow.
9381000	9384000	That's a bit of a tangent.
9384000	9385000	Um.
9385000	9386000	I.
9386000	9387000	Okay.
9387000	9388000	I'm a big fan of skywriting.
9388000	9390000	I can offer a resource.
9390000	9391000	Yes.
9391000	9392000	Please.
9392000	9393000	Um.
9393000	9394000	The um.
9394000	9395000	Human rights.
9395000	9396000	Um.
9396000	9397000	What's the name of the.
9397000	9398000	Their equality thing.
9398000	9399000	The human.
9399000	9401000	They've got the store in San Francisco.
9401000	9402000	Human rights campaign.
9402000	9403000	Thank you.
9403000	9409000	The human rights campaign has actually brochures and free material up on their website if you
9409000	9414000	do want to actually have something in writing, you know, by a psychologist and stuff.
9414000	9416000	So they do have resources there.
9416000	9417000	Uh.
9417000	9418000	Okay.
9418000	9421000	How do I tackle this question without taking 30 minutes?
9421000	9422000	Um.
9422000	9423000	Okay.
9423000	9426000	First off, if you need additional advice, send me a personal email.
9426000	9427000	Rob at orangehonestrager.com.
9427000	9429000	I'll address this off the air.
9429000	9430000	Um.
9430000	9431000	Because I really don't know anything about this listener.
9431000	9432000	I don't know how old you are.
9432000	9433000	I don't know what you're like.
9433000	9436000	If you have a hostile family situation or what's going on.
9436000	9440000	Cause I think different situations necessitate different responses.
9440000	9441000	Um.
9441000	9445000	I know there's a lot of push out there that say like, you know, come out, come out wherever
9445000	9446000	you are and all this stuff.
9446000	9450000	But I, I completely understand that sometimes that is not necessarily the answer.
9450000	9451000	Um.
9451000	9453000	At the end of the day, who you have in your bedroom is your business.
9453000	9454000	Um.
9454000	9456000	And I understand your desire to tell your family that.
9456000	9460000	And I think, you know, if you have that type of family, you should tell them that that's
9460000	9461000	going to be supportive and loving.
9461000	9462000	Um.
9462000	9464000	But there are sometimes some, some sticky situations.
9464000	9467000	So I don't know your family background or what have you.
9467000	9474000	My advice would be tell your best friend because your best friend will always be there for
9474000	9475000	you no matter what.
9475000	9478000	And if they run away because you tell them this, then they're not really your friend
9478000	9479000	to begin with.
9479000	9481000	And again, I don't know how old this person is.
9481000	9482000	They could be 15, they could be 30.
9482000	9486000	If you are younger, if you're still in high school, I honestly don't think there's any
9486000	9490000	rush because I think a lot of people in high school and even somewhat college kind of go
9490000	9495000	through that phase where, you know, they're not sure what's going on.
9495000	9498000	And I don't think there's any rush to label yourself.
9498000	9503000	But if you are, you know, older, experienced, whatever, and you know this is, this is it,
9503000	9507000	and this is the way it's going to be, then, um, you know, tell your friend first.
9507000	9510000	It'll be much easier to tell friend, friends.
9510000	9514000	And that way, if your family does have a negative reaction, you have some, somebody else you
9514000	9515000	can turn to.
9515000	9516000	Um.
9516000	9519000	I, I hope that you are fortunate to have a family that is loving and supporting and all
9519000	9520000	that.
9520000	9525000	And in most cases it will, but it would be disingenuous of me to sit here and say, just
9525000	9529000	tell them everything will be fine because in some situations it's not, but you know
9529000	9531000	your family better than I do.
9531000	9533000	So I guess that's really all I can say on that for now.
9533000	9539000	If you need help, um, contact one of the resources Jamie mentioned or email me directly.
9539000	9540000	Yeah.
9540000	9541000	Good job.
9541000	9542000	I hope.
9542000	9543000	Yeah.
9543000	9544000	I don't.
9544000	9545000	Yeah.
9545000	9546000	That's, that's, that's a challenging question.
9546000	9548000	I haven't been asked that in the eight years of doing this.
9548000	9554000	I don't think I've been told by people, you know, which is always a wonderful compliment.
9554000	9559000	It's an astonishing feeling, you know, like thank you for being, you know, out on the
9559000	9563000	radio and just, you know, being a guy who likes games, who happens to be gay.
9563000	9566000	But I don't think I've had that question.
9566000	9567000	Yeah.
9567000	9573000	But, um, thank you for asking because I think it takes a lot of guts to even type that out.
9573000	9576000	So please email me if you need it.
9576000	9579000	Um, this one's from Rababa.
9579000	9585000	It says, this is particularly for Jamie and he sends me a link from doitmyself.org of
9585000	9591000	a TARDIS cake, but it lights up and it's got the inside of the TARDIS through the window,
9591000	9593000	but it's a cake.
9593000	9595000	That is awesome.
9595000	9600000	And he concludes his email with, it's probably too involved for most, but it is cool.
9600000	9605000	I'm going to share the link with our chatters real quick.
9605000	9608000	I like the TARDIS made of cake.
9608000	9609000	I would eat that.
9609000	9610000	Delicious.
9610000	9616000	I think I just make a cake in the shape of a TARDIS, but I can't bake for crap.
9616000	9619000	I can't even make pancakes, right Rob?
9619000	9621000	That, that's awful.
9621000	9624000	Okay, last email.
9624000	9626000	Greetings, OLR.
9626000	9627000	Rini here.
9627000	9632000	A few episodes ago, you mentioned having a contingency plan for when Loki needs to care
9632000	9634000	for his newborn bundle of joy.
9634000	9639000	Although there is always the amusing chance that he may never be gone, I still would like
9639000	9642000	to suggest a host, a guest host, Scott Rubin.
9642000	9647000	I'm just listening to the guy, and I think he'd be doing OLR and his All Games fans
9647000	9652000	a favor by chiming in once with his thoughts on games and gaming news today.
9652000	9656000	Also, he would make this show run seven hours long and prompt everyone to call in sick due
9656000	9660000	to copious, but responsible amounts of drinking, perverted discussions, and not giving a fuck
9660000	9662000	in general.
9662000	9664000	I think I approve of that.
9664000	9668000	And since Dark Sakura and Sky recently purchased Team Fortress 2, I'd like to make a few
9668000	9672000	suggestions on classes since Sky isn't so hot with the aiming.
9672000	9675000	One, learn the maps with Medic.
9675000	9679000	You can learn where items and paths are while helping your teammates.
9679000	9685000	Overall, over-heal everyone, but focus on assisting those taking fire, and especially
9685000	9689000	do not be afraid to turn around and see what's around you.
9689000	9694000	If you unlock the Uber Saw, feel free to knife Uyghur classes to gain power for your Uber
9694000	9695000	Charge.
9695000	9696000	Two, try Pyro.
9696000	9700000	Can I say, I was actually thinking of being a Medic, because I'm always the White Mage
9700000	9701000	in these games.
9701000	9702000	Always.
9702000	9703000	Okay.
9703000	9704000	Two, try Pyro.
9704000	9708000	Incredibly helpful with this flamethrower because it can airblast to push enemies in
9708000	9712000	rockets, grenades, or slash grenades while putting out fires on teammates.
9712000	9717000	Be sneaky and use hit-and-run tactics to let the afterburn make enemies retreat, or at
9717000	9719000	least hold off them a bit.
9719000	9721000	If they're alone or weak, finish them off.
9721000	9724000	Always check for spies and never use the backburner.
9724000	9726000	That's capitalized never.
9726000	9728000	And that's capitalized always, by the way.
9728000	9730000	Three, try Engineer.
9730000	9735000	Build teleporters and dispensers to help teammates and play sentries where they can cover an
9735000	9738000	important point while being shielded by some part of the level.
9738000	9742000	Unlock the Wrangler and the Gunslinger to deploy many sentries for offensive play.
9742000	9749000	Don't forget hitting buildings with your wrench doubles their construction speed, and all
9749000	9752000	but the many sentries can be upgraded to level three.
9752000	9757000	If your buildings get sapped by spies, always kill the spy first and then get rid of the
9757000	9758000	sappers.
9758000	9762000	Don't forget that your wrench has a higher chance to deal critical hits than most other
9762000	9764000	melee weapons.
9764000	9769000	I was actually going to try Engineer because I found that they have now where you can move
9769000	9770000	your sentries around.
9770000	9771000	Your turrets.
9771000	9773000	Apparently everyone's playing Engineer because of it.
9773000	9774000	Yeah.
9774000	9775000	That's what I hear.
9775000	9779000	For more information and strategies, okay, I have to do the voice.
9779000	9781000	Ready?
9781000	9785000	For more information and strategies, I direct you to the official TF2 Wiki here.
9785000	9793000	Http colon slash slash wiki dot Team Fortress dot com slash wiki slash main underscore page.
9793000	9795000	Good luck and don't fail, dammit.
9795000	9798000	Rini is very excited to have us playing Team Fortress 2.
9798000	9801000	I've seen it on the Twitter as well.
9801000	9802000	I actually need to revisit it.
9802000	9804000	I didn't really touch it at all this week.
9804000	9806000	Well, I really haven't been able to do much.
9806000	9808000	Well, yeah, you got the hand thing going on, though.
9808000	9810000	Well, we still have to have our game.
9810000	9811000	We shook on it.
9811000	9814000	So whenever your hand's better, we're going to get on that.
9814000	9817000	Do you like my announcer voice?
9817000	9819000	I do.
9819000	9822000	I could do my wacky morning DJ voice, though.
9822000	9824000	Wouldn't that be fun to do an entire episode?
9824000	9828000	I can do the annoying female co-host voice.
9828000	9830000	Maybe for the next April Fool's show.
9830000	9832000	Oh, the Scott thing, too.
9832000	9836000	I think a lot of the All Games folks miss hearing him on the radio.
9836000	9838000	He certainly had a fun show.
9838000	9840000	He's not on the radio anymore?
9840000	9843000	Well, he does the Appaday thing now.
9843000	9845000	They're doing the TV thing.
9845000	9849000	Him and Diane Mizona do a show, which is kind of fun, that's online.
9849000	9854000	Well, I don't know. I'll hear about these random takeover shows,
9854000	9857000	but I don't think they're podcasts or anything because I never hear them.
9857000	9860000	So I don't think he's really doing radio frequently.
9860000	9862000	He's not doing regular radio.
9862000	9864000	I'm comfortable in saying that.
9864000	9867000	It would be awesome to have him on the show, but here's the biggest problem.
9867000	9872000	Having a co-host via Skype anything is going to suck.
9872000	9877000	And I realize other shows do it, and they do it really well.
9877000	9880000	But you have to remember, we've been spoiled over eight years
9880000	9882000	of being in the same room doing the show,
9882000	9885000	and I think it's honestly what makes our show different at the end of the day.
9885000	9889000	And I will tell you, the most fun I've had doing radio with Scott
9889000	9892000	was when we were in the same room, like the E3 Outpost
9892000	9895000	and the random times we dropped into All Games Interactive
9895000	9896000	and some of those things.
9896000	9901000	When they had that frat house, practically, in Santa Monica.
9901000	9903000	That place was fantabulous.
9903000	9906000	That place was fantabulous. It was like a frat house.
9906000	9908000	Good times. Good memories are had by all.
9908000	9911000	And sadly, that place doesn't exist anymore.
9911000	9914000	If you wanted to drive up to NorCal, though, hell, we'd host him in a heartbeat,
9914000	9918000	but I think he's probably busy with all his other stuff.
9918000	9921000	So, again, we don't want to be so quick like,
9921000	9923000	Gosh, Loki!
9923000	9928000	All we can do is sit here and talk about who's going to replace you for one week.
9928000	9929000	I don't even care.
9929000	9931000	I know, I know.
9931000	9934000	It's kind of one of those, we're just going to see who's available that week.
9934000	9935000	We'll burn that bridge when we get to it.
9935000	9938000	If we have to pick someone up off Skype, we will,
9938000	9940000	but we have got lots of great people.
9940000	9943000	I'm sure Alan could come back for a show.
9943000	9944000	Drew, you know, wants to do it.
9944000	9947000	It'll be done through an elaborate ceremony featuring roses.
9947000	9950000	Dan could do it. He's here.
9950000	9952000	That's because he lives here, Rob.
9952000	9955000	I think the chatters would love it if Extifer would come back for a night.
9955000	9958000	Maybe Irene. We'll figure something out.
9958000	9960000	You know what?
9960000	9964000	I really, I really, really, really would like for,
9964000	9968000	and Dan was actually excited about wanting to be on the show tonight,
9968000	9970000	but the family's leaving town.
9970000	9976000	But I think that we need to have Dan be a co-host for a night.
9976000	9978000	Well, maybe that'll happen.
9978000	9981000	I live with the man. He wouldn't let me live it down.
9981000	9982000	All right.
9982000	9984000	I mean, I love my husband.
9984000	9986000	Let's move on to the next email.
9986000	9988000	That was the email.
9988000	9989000	Oh, that was it? That was it? All right.
9989000	9993000	Mailbag. OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us your email in the future.
9993000	9997000	In the meantime, angst, hatred, boo, hiss, the FUs of the week.
10014000	10018000	FU to the absolute and utter pain that my hand is in.
10018000	10026000	Yeah, while I'm healing faster and I've got more range of motion,
10026000	10029000	it actually hurts worse, if that makes sense,
10029000	10031000	and the little tight stitches.
10031000	10034000	And I know it's all for a good thing and I'm very happy,
10034000	10040000	but FU to just being in pain and being tired all the time from it, too.
10040000	10042000	I'm really tired all the time and wanting meat,
10042000	10044000	and I'm not supposed to be eating meat.
10044000	10051000	So, FU to all that and FU to work stuff I've heard about.
10051000	10056000	FU to Apple for reasons I think I explained either on Bobby's show
10056000	10057000	or at the beginning of this show.
10057000	10059000	I can't even remember now. It was all blur.
10059000	10063000	FU to stress.
10063000	10066000	I bought a car this week, which is actually awesome and I'm happy,
10066000	10069000	but now I've got to get rid of the old car and that takes a lot of work.
10069000	10071000	So, yeah.
10071000	10073000	That's it.
10073000	10079000	FU to one particular person I saw driving on my way to the show today,
10079000	10082000	completely swerving all around the road,
10082000	10084000	and of course she was texting on cell phones.
10084000	10087000	Thank you, wonderful, reckless person.
10087000	10089000	Oops. Sorry.
10089000	10094000	FU to the fact I just started playing the credits music on accident.
10094000	10095000	And that's it.
10095000	10097000	Can I punctuate that? Can I punctuate that with something?
10097000	10098000	Sure.
10098000	10103000	Nobody's text message or phone conversation is as important as Elijah's
10103000	10105000	on the road around you.
10105000	10106000	Even my mother?
10106000	10107000	Even.
10107000	10110000	I think she'd disagree.
10110000	10113000	Rob, I have told my mother to get off the phone with me
10113000	10116000	if I found out that she was talking to me while she was driving
10116000	10117000	without hands-freezing.
10117000	10119000	I'm just saying. Is it okay if I'm stuck in traffic
10119000	10121000	because I totally texted you and Bobby today,
10121000	10124000	but I was sitting in stopped traffic and I was watching.
10124000	10125000	I think that's a little bit different.
10125000	10126000	Okay.
10126000	10130000	But there's people who do this crap while they're moving on the road,
10130000	10131000	and that's just not right.
10131000	10137000	Yeah. I'm not perfect, but safety first.
10137000	10138000	But you want everyone to think you are.
10138000	10139000	I know. Well, you know.
10139000	10143000	Well, no, I take that back. I am perfect, actually.
10143000	10144000	Rob.
10144000	10145000	All right.
10145000	10148000	Couple more stories for you guys, and then the Skype line.
10148000	10154000	Brace yourselves, 877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10154000	10156000	Couple new stories real quick before we get there, though.
10156000	10157000	Loki.
10157000	10160000	I guess Kmart wants me to put reviews up for games.
10160000	10167000	Honestly, wouldn't have known that because I have not been in a Kmart in...
10167000	10168000	Yes, think about it.
10168000	10171000	Oh, God, at like ten years now.
10171000	10172000	So, yes.
10172000	10173000	You should go. It's fun.
10173000	10174000	And remember Kmart's one of the... on our Wiki.
10174000	10176000	It's a cultural experience.
10176000	10177000	It's like stepping back into the 80s.
10177000	10178000	It is. It is.
10178000	10180000	Hey, remember the 80s?
10180000	10185000	Remember back in the day when they used to have, like, those touchpad sensors for opening the doors?
10185000	10187000	It wasn't this fancy infrared.
10187000	10189000	It was, you know, you step on a sensor and...
10189000	10193000	Actually, I think you guys, Kmart has modernized a little bit.
10193000	10197000	I think they are right now somewhere around 93.
10197000	10198000	Eh.
10198000	10199000	Just so you know.
10199000	10201000	Rob, you're adorable.
10201000	10203000	I just want to let you know.
10203000	10204000	I know.
10204000	10212000	Um, apparently they are looking for reader reviews or I guess shopper reviews on different titles.
10212000	10219000	Um, they said, uh, one thing, uh, we'd like to feature your reviews on our shelves.
10219000	10226000	Um, it says, but at this time we will not be sending out free games for you to review.
10226000	10227000	Which is kind of funny.
10227000	10231000	Wait, what? So, like, on the shelf they'll have, like, papers with reviews printed out or something?
10231000	10232000	I guess.
10232000	10233000	What?
10233000	10241000	They're, um, they're basically looking for reviews, um, to help sell games, I guess.
10241000	10244000	So, we're supposed to help them market games.
10244000	10246000	But they're not going to publish the negative things then.
10246000	10250000	So, in other words, they will extract one or two sentences that are glowing about the game.
10250000	10253000	Like, you fucking kill zombies and it's rad.
10253000	10255000	Like, you know, or whatever.
10255000	10257000	They'll put that on a little tag next to the game.
10257000	10265000	Yeah, um, so you can go, like, uh, I guess re-register at MyKMart, um, I don't know, that's MyKMart.com.
10265000	10268000	People are gonna make shit up just to get their stuff in the store.
10268000	10274000	Dude, all you gotta do, Kmart, seriously, is do a little work, um, I don't know, go to Metacritic
10274000	10279000	and there's, like, a list of all these fucking reviews with little synopsises of each review
10279000	10284000	and little, like, blurbs and stuff that you can print out and put on your shelves.
10284000	10285000	I guess, or maybe that would be copyright.
10285000	10286000	Yeah, it might be a copyright thing.
10286000	10287000	Whatever, so.
10287000	10289000	Then put the Metacritic score.
10289000	10291000	That's what they do on Steam.
10291000	10292000	You can see the Metacritic score right there.
10292000	10295000	Unless it's, like, under a certain amount, then it's not, it's just not there.
10295000	10297000	Love it.
10297000	10298000	I don't, I don't understand.
10298000	10300000	Or have it on your website.
10300000	10305000	Have people review the, you know, stuff like Amazon or GameStop or whomever.
10305000	10307000	I think it's an interesting idea.
10307000	10308000	It's just a weird one.
10308000	10309000	You know what I mean?
10309000	10312000	Like, it's, it's interesting that they want to put people's reviews up there
10312000	10316000	and it's, I guess, to encourage a community type thing on the site
10316000	10320000	to get people, like, thinking about Kmart, because otherwise you don't.
10320000	10321000	Whoa.
10321000	10323000	Here's, my mind's blown here.
10323000	10326000	Apparently Kmart has blogs.
10326000	10327000	What?
10327000	10328000	Yes.
10328000	10329000	Get out.
10329000	10330000	MyKmart.com.
10330000	10332000	Do they blog about the coffee shops at Kmart?
10332000	10333000	No, apparently.
10333000	10339000	This Week in the Icy Machine, Blue Raspberry, yum.
10339000	10344000	Well, let's see, here's some wonderful, whoa, that's weird.
10344000	10347000	Here's some wonderful blog posts that we have going on here.
10347000	10350000	Some of these may even be slightly relevant.
10350000	10352000	Which way do you weed?
10352000	10357000	And this is talking about either using, I guess, a rake or weed spray.
10357000	10361000	Kevin Butler versus Old Spice, Old Spice Man.
10361000	10365000	Who wins for being, I guess, most infamous.
10365000	10368000	Gamer Chat number one was a success.
10368000	10369000	Thanks to all-
10369000	10371000	Wait, is this, like, only gaming stuff on the blog?
10371000	10373000	No, this is just blogs.myKmart.com.
10373000	10376000	They have Blue Light Special stuff.
10376000	10378000	They post Blue Light Specials on the blog?
10378000	10379000	Yes.
10379000	10380000	Attention, Twitter.
10380000	10383000	Blue Light Special on Pepperidge Farm cookies.
10383000	10385000	50% off.
10385000	10388000	Gamer Chat number one was a success.
10388000	10389000	I gotta read this.
10389000	10395000	Thanks to all who joined yesterday's, you know, pound, Gamer Chat Twitter event.
10395000	10398000	We had a spirited discussion about gaming,
10398000	10403000	including the best year for video games, people's first games,
10403000	10407000	and some of this year's surprises, both good and bad.
10407000	10410000	Oh, but if you weren't able to catch it yesterday,
10410000	10413000	you can download a, or you can check out a full transcript.
10413000	10418000	What are some of the topics that you'd like to discuss in the next Gamer Chat?
10418000	10421000	Oh, oh, wait, what's this?
10421000	10425000	I, they have a gaming blog, too.
10425000	10428000	Kmartgamer.com.
10428000	10430000	Are you a Kmart gamer?
10430000	10435000	Or, I guess it's blogs.myKmart.com slash games.
10435000	10438000	It's just, it's the same fucking blog with video game tags pulled out.
10438000	10441000	I see what you're doing.
10441000	10445000	They talk about, what's your backlog of games?
10445000	10449000	Oh my God, Kmart, you're so current with your blogs and fun stuff like that.
10449000	10451000	I have to shop at you now.
10451000	10456000	Kmart is awesome because most every Kmart I've been to totally ignores street dates.
10456000	10458000	Totally ignores them.
10458000	10460000	I bet if you went into Kmart and go,
10460000	10463000	yeah, I saw it on your blog and be like, huh, what's a blog, huh?
10463000	10467000	On the internet? What the hell's the internet?
10467000	10469000	That's witchcraft.
10469000	10474000	Did I tell you about the time that like Target was closed for like six months
10474000	10476000	and Walmart, I just, I wasn't going to go to Walmart.
10476000	10481000	So I actually went to Kmart to get like razor blades and it was the most like challenging.
10481000	10484000	First of all, they have them locked because, you know,
10484000	10488000	I guess there's rampant thievery of razor blades across the nation.
10488000	10498000	I had to track someone down to get a key and they give it to just like the old cragly lady.
10498000	10501000	Here's another wonderful topic.
10501000	10503000	What kind of razor blade did you want?
10503000	10507000	Did you want the Gillette Mach five or did you want?
10507000	10513000	I mean, just like, Oh my God, I want to die from June 23rd, 2010 fat guy in a little coat.
10513000	10517000	Biggest loser special.
10517000	10522000	You're talking about the biggest loser game.
10522000	10524000	Wow. My life is now complete.
10524000	10528000	Now that I have discovered Kmart has a blog, I will read it every day.
10528000	10529000	You know why? For sure.
10529000	10533000	Kmart updates their blog more regularly than any of us post on orangehoundsradio.com.
10533000	10536000	I don't care. Do you want me to post nonsense like this?
10536000	10539000	I will be happy to post nonsense like this.
10539000	10541000	I played that game. It was wonderful.
10541000	10547000	Go buy it at Kmart.
10547000	10549000	Look at me making a reference to it.
10549000	10552000	Would you please sign up for a Kmart account and start reviewing games?
10552000	10557000	I think we should all sign up for Kmart accounts and start reviewing games on there
10557000	10562000	with just like complete nonsensical reviews of things.
10562000	10570000	Like, you know, like, you know, I was sitting here on the couch and I was playing Naughty Bear
10570000	10575000	and it was fun, but I was sitting there naked and the dog came up and licked my balls.
10575000	10578000	So I think this game should be called Naughty Dog.
10578000	10583000	Like just these complete nonsensical things that have nothing to do with anything.
10583000	10586000	I would love that very much.
10586000	10590000	I'm sorry, Rob. My brain started to shut down when you started talking about that.
10590000	10595000	What you're describing sounds like a lot of effort.
10595000	10599000	I'm going to do it. I'm going to start a forum thread for awesome Kmart reviews.
10599000	10603000	And I want all the OL Army to post their awesome Kmart reviews and link them.
10603000	10605000	You mean like butt-tarded?
10605000	10609000	And just that they have to be like complete. But don't get yourself banned.
10609000	10614000	Don't say stupid shit. You have to say like really awkward things.
10614000	10617000	Basically you have to go on tangents a lot.
10617000	10619000	Just like us.
10619000	10624000	You'll be talking about your Red Dead Redemption review and then somehow talk about how you like horses.
10624000	10629000	And this one time you rode a horse and then it gave you like, you know, car crash or something like that.
10629000	10635000	Now that was terrible. But at least the horse's name was like, you know, Biscuit or something.
10635000	10643000	I was riding my horse Clyde and I skinned a horse in Red Dead Redemption that reminded me of Clyde.
10643000	10646000	And one time Clyde kicked me in the shin.
10646000	10649000	And it made me pee.
10649000	10651000	How about that?
10651000	10655000	Monty Boggs here. This is great. Now people are posting their reviews. This is great.
10655000	10660000	Alan Wake makes me want to buy Energizer batteries at Kmart. Buy Alan Wake at Kmart.
10660000	10663000	Alan Wake from Gamestop wasn't as good. That's pretty good.
10663000	10672000	Ray Ayanami says, great rail shooter. Now has anyone been far as decided to use even Go1 to do look more like?
10672000	10678000	I get it.
10678000	10683000	Let me try to read it again. That's awesome. That's an awesome review.
10683000	10693000	Great rail shooter. Now has anyone really been far as decided to use even Go1 to do look more like?
10693000	10700000	I love you guys.
10700000	10708000	That should be on the tag right there.
10708000	10714000	That about sums up what I think of Kmart in the reviewing.
10714000	10717000	You've been far as decided to use even Go1 to do more look like?
10717000	10720000	That's about right.
10720000	10723000	That's the point. Dark Dead Studio is like, I don't get it. That's the point.
10723000	10726000	Like he just he just threw a bunch of words together that make no sense at all.
10726000	10733000	And it's funny. And I'm laughing so hard. I'm crying. I can't stop.
10733000	10737000	Yet Dark Soccer is not like throwing up over there like the bad grammars.
10737000	10741000	She must be. No, because this is appropriately bad grammar.
10741000	10744000	OK. Like there is like little cats.
10744000	10749000	I didn't go around correcting the little cats. I pet them on the head and feed them fish.
10749000	10753000	All right. One more story for you guys and then we'll get to the calls.
10753000	10760000	1877 Game OLR username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10760000	10770000	The Brick Theater in Brooklyn, New York is putting on some shows and they are video game inspired plays.
10770000	10782000	Yes, that's right. There's Grand Theft Ovid, which takes the Roman poets Ovid's songs and talks like integrates it with Grand Theft Auto.
10782000	10788000	Modal Combat uses guitar controllers. And I don't even understand this.
10788000	10792000	This is just like what? Let me let me look at the official website here.
10792000	10797000	Let me look here. Go into the Brick Theater website here.
10797000	10800000	Gameplay at the Brick is art playable.
10800000	10804000	Our video game cinematic is Mashima theatrical. Our smartphones a stage.
10804000	10807000	Is there an architecture that connects these diverse media forums?
10807000	10814000	What boundaries can be broken within and without the walls of an off off Broadway theater to change your reviews?
10814000	10818000	They're having. Rock band karaoke night.
10818000	10825000	Well, that's not a play. Baby Castles, Chiptunes Dance Party, Kool Aid Man and Second Life.
10825000	10831000	Theater of the Arcade, five classic video games adapted for the stage in this collection of short plays.
10831000	10837000	The creators of Brick hit suspicious package and this is stupid. Like what?
10837000	10842000	This makes no sense. It gets a Dan quote, Rob.
10842000	10846000	What? Really? That's Dan line.
10846000	10850000	You know what? I'm going to write a review of these plays and it's going to say great rail shooter.
10850000	10857000	Now, has anyone really been far as decided to use even go what to do look more like?
10857000	10860000	Because that's pretty much my reaction when reading this story.
10860000	10863000	One, eight, seven, seven. Game. O. L. R.
10863000	10867000	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio. If you want to give us a call, we'll talk.
10867000	10869000	One, eight, seven, seven. Game. O. L. R.
10869000	10871000	username is Skype is Orange Laundry.
10871000	10874000	The Skype line is now open.
10874000	10880000	Frisbee is asking what game should I review? You should review blur.
10880000	10884000	Frisbee, I'd like you to review the game blur. Let's go to the phones.
10884000	10887000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
10887000	10892000	Hi, it's Ray Iannami. Hi, Ray. Good to see you yesterday at the show.
10892000	10896000	Yeah, it was really good to see you. Yeah.
10896000	10899000	So what's on your mind?
10899000	10906000	So for California Extreme, the games I'm looking for,
10906000	10914000	The Don't Bunch Diode 2, Blue Space Harrier, Red, among other things.
10914000	10918000	Wait, there was a space harrier there? There was a space harrier in the back.
10918000	10925000	Oh, I missed it. Fortunately, the person who said the machine forgot to put in an add a credit button.
10925000	10932000	So for instance, you had to put in a coin and take the coin out of the coin door just to start a game.
10932000	10938000	And the second day they closed the coin door. So you had to put it in a corner, which is kind of dumb.
10938000	10942000	Yeah, it was kind of bothersome when some of those games would run out of credits.
10942000	10947000	But you know, I can't hate because they're just arcade collectors and they're actually doing a favor,
10947000	10951000	putting their machines out there. They don't have to do it, so I try not to bitch.
10951000	10954000	But it was really frustrating when I wanted to play Tapper and it was out of credits.
10954000	10958000	It's like, wham.
10958000	10963000	So in other news, I've gone around to playing Deathmatch and Sin and Punishment 2.
10963000	10966000	Now, what was your real review of Sin and Punishment 2?
10966000	10970000	Because by the way, that was you I noticed in chat that has now spawned the new OLR quote.
10970000	10973000	Has anyone really been far as decided to use even Go What To Do Look More Like?
10973000	10981000	Well, it's actually an already existing Internet meme. I just thought I'd throw in some random meme to go with my review.
10981000	10985000	Did you bring 4chan to this show?
10985000	10986000	Maybe.
10986000	10988000	Oh, god damn you.
10988000	10990000	Well, I brought games back to the show.
10990000	10993000	Oh, okay. Whatever. No, I'm just fucking around.
10993000	10995000	Kids on the Internet are funny.
10995000	11000000	I've been playing Sin and Punishment 2 for the past two days.
11000000	11004000	It's pretty fun. It's a great improvement over the last game.
11004000	11009000	But I'm going to warrant anyone who wants to get that game even though it's not played the original.
11009000	11012000	It's fucking hard.
11012000	11018000	I see. Aren't most of those shooter games pretty hard?
11018000	11029000	Yeah, I mean, if people aren't too bad by real shooter standards, it's a bosses that get to me mainly.
11029000	11041000	I have to do a few tries if we get the patterns down so I don't end up bullshitting through a pattern.
11041000	11045000	And I've been playing Death Moth as well for the past two weeks.
11045000	11047000	And how's that?
11047000	11056000	So Death Moth, for those who haven't heard of it, is a side-scrolling shooter by Kave with gothic loli elements.
11056000	11057000	Awesome.
11057000	11067000	And that aside, I especially like this game. I love the fact that you can fire in both directions, which is a luxury that most side-scrollers tend to lack.
11067000	11072000	Like, you're stuck firing to the right, which is usually the direction you scroll.
11072000	11078000	And it's also much easier to play than other Bloodhog games.
11078000	11084000	Even with the in-game difficulty at the highest, I can get to the final stage easily.
11084000	11094000	But on other shooters, I usually end up only halfway through the game on my first credit.
11094000	11098000	Hmm. Interesting. You can get that far?
11098000	11105000	I thought that would be the harder game, because usually those, like, SHMUP games are impossibly difficult.
11105000	11113000	Death Moth, no, not that... it's not that hard, really. It's been one of the easier cases.
11113000	11119000	I play as opposed to the Donpax, which I play as much harder.
11119000	11120000	Alright.
11120000	11124000	They do call him Bullet Hell for a reason, though.
11124000	11131000	I fire bombs on the first spot of the Donpax Dial Joe, and that's not something I do in both shooters.
11131000	11140000	Like, I can easily get through the stage one boss of a vertical shooter just fine without using any bombs.
11140000	11142000	Okay. Okay.
11142000	11147000	Well, are there any other games coming up in the near future that you're going to be reviewing in the future on the show?
11147000	11149000	That you're looking forward to playing?
11149000	11159000	Um, I'm not sure, because I've spent a whole lot of buying new games until this mess up begins next month, because Death Moth and Standard Placement took a toll on my money.
11159000	11166000	I hear ya. Now I have a car payment, so I have to watch my gaming funding as well, so I think a lot of us are in that pinch.
11166000	11175000	Like, including tax, both of those games cost me $110, so I've already been waiting until this mess up begins, so I'll probably, I don't know, I'll probably pick up a person that's pretty portable.
11175000	11182000	Alright. Well, we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you very much for your call, and we'll see you at the next big Bay Area expo, okay?
11182000	11184000	Okay, then. Alright.
11184000	11185000	Later.
11185000	11191000	Alright, 1877 Game OLR. Let's go to another call that's coming in right now. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
11191000	11193000	Uh, this is Recon Elite.
11193000	11196000	Recon Elite! Welcome to the show. Have you called in before?
11196000	11200000	Uh, no. I'm a long-time listener, but first-time caller.
11200000	11206000	I've always wanted someone to say that on this program. Long-time listener, first-time caller. Well, welcome! How you doin'? What's on your mind?
11206000	11208000	I'm doing good.
11208000	11210000	How can we help you? What's on your mind?
11210000	11216000	Yeah, I just wanted to know, um, I have a quick question. I don't know if you guys ever played it before, but Borderlands, what do you think about that?
11216000	11218000	Borderlands is awesome!
11218000	11235000	I have not played Borderlands, but I've watched someone else play it, and it kinda looks like, it has a really neat art style. It's kinda like Oblivion meets this very, like, post-apocalyptic kind of, uh, world. I don't know. Have you played this?
11235000	11236000	Okay.
11236000	11238000	With guns! And it's fun!
11238000	11239000	It's awesome.
11239000	11240000	It's hilarious.
11240000	11242000	I've heard a lot of great things about this game.
11242000	11244000	Totally get the Isle of Dr. Ned.
11244000	11256000	At least, though, you totally missed your opportunity to get it on Steam for, like, super cheap, because I almost bought it because it was down to, like, 20 bucks, but, unfortunately, the Uber sale's over. But, let me guess, you're probably gonna get it on console, huh?
11256000	11259000	Well, it was either one. It didn't bother me too much.
11259000	11260000	Oh, okay.
11260000	11278000	Well, the community was big, you know, as in playing it, because the last thing I wanted was to go online on it, and then nobody ain't there, you know. That was my fear.
11278000	11290000	You definitely would have people to play with there. And, you know, they've released several expansions for it. I've really heard nothing but good things about it. I just haven't had the time to play it myself, thanks to certain MMOs that I spend a lot of time playing.
11290000	11292000	That's wild.
11292000	11293000	Addict!
11293000	11295000	I say wow too all the time.
11295000	11298000	Okay, phew. Okay, then you understand what I go through.
11298000	11299000	Yeah.
11299000	11316000	But, yeah, no, I've honestly heard nothing but good things about the game. Here's a thought. If you want to try it out, here's what some people I know are doing. OnLive is this new thing that's out there, and you can sign, they're still doing sign-ups, and I just read something, like, it's extended through Labor Day.
11316000	11320000	You can try to get into the beta by signing up. Are you on OnLive?
11320000	11321000	Yes.
11321000	11329000	Okay, you can play demos of games. You can play the first, like, 30 or 45 minutes of a game without buying it, and Borderlands is one of them.
11329000	11332000	Oh, okay. Oh, that's a nice good suggestion.
11332000	11350000	There you go. Go on to OnLive. You know, I gotta say, as weird as I think the OnLive pricing, but here's my suggestion, don't buy it on OnLive, because the whole thing is that, yeah, it's cool that you're playing through another computer that has all the graphics and everything, but you're paying the same price you'd pay at retail for the game.
11350000	11360000	And it really is only guaranteed to last three years. If OnLive fails, you're going to lose that game. You're basically paying for a three-year rental. So, if you like the game, go get it on Steam.
11360000	11362000	Okay. Thank you.
11362000	11363000	That's my suggestion.
11363000	11364000	I just got one more quick question, and I'll hang up.
11364000	11365000	Of course.
11365000	11370000	Do you think Project Natal, what do you think about Project Natal? Do you think it's going to fail, or do you think it's going to succeed?
11370000	11381000	Well, keep in mind, we're all supposed to call it Kinect now, but I think it's a huge risk on Microsoft's part. A lot of it has to do with how they market it.
11381000	11399000	The Macy's thing, as much as we give them a hard time about who the hell at Macy's plays Kinect, we know exactly who they're going for. And, you know, all laughing and jokes aside, they're trying to appeal to Mom, or AKA Santa Claus, because they're going kind of directly to make their case there and show the games there.
11399000	11410000	That's a huge risk on Microsoft's part. I think the price point is everything. I think if they release this for $150, that's really $210 if you want a game.
11410000	11419000	And I think there's a lot of people that are going to run away from that, but if they can hit that magic number, $99, I think it'll sell twice as much, and it could be a success for them.
11419000	11425000	Got you. Okay. I just want to end it with that. Love the show. Keep it up. The good work, man. You guys are awesome. I love it.
11425000	11428000	We love the call. Thank you so much for your enthusiasm. You're awesome.
11428000	11431000	And thank you for saying the phrase that we've been waiting to hear.
11431000	11434000	I know. I've been waiting eight years to hear that. Longtime listener, first time caller.
11434000	11435000	All right. I got you.
11435000	11436000	All right. Take care, buddy.
11436000	11437000	All right. You have a good night.
11437000	11438000	Uh-huh. You too.
11438000	11439000	All right. Bye-bye.
11439000	11445000	Bye. That's how you know we're like legitimate radio now, because, you know, whenever you listen to a radio talk show, there's always that guy that calls in,
11445000	11449000	Hey, hey, hey, hey, Dr. Laura. Longtime listener, first time caller.
11449000	11451000	Love it.
11451000	11456000	I don't know why I named Dr. Laura, because she actually really sucks.
11456000	11458000	It means we've arrived.
11458000	11462000	It is. We made it. We made it. That decree meant something.
11462000	11464000	Now the Laverne and Shirley theme is going through my head for some reason?
11464000	11466000	We're gonna do it.
11466000	11476000	By the way, Gold Anthro in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradiocom is kind of offering the counterpoint to what I was just saying about Borderlands.
11476000	11481000	Meh, Borderlands just isn't the game for me. I played it and was like, this isn't as fun as it sounded.
11481000	11490000	So, you know, not everybody's a fan, so take that. But I think OnLive is going to be great for demos.
11490000	11500000	Like, even I have to pat myself on the back. I think that's a good idea to just go play the first 30 minutes of the game for yourself and make a determination if you want to play, you know, more.
11500000	11505000	All right. 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
11505000	11508000	Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?
11508000	11516000	Uh, sure do. Let's see, let's talk about this really funny hack that they have for Sonic the Hedgehog.
11516000	11532000	Sonic 2 XL, it changes the gold rings to onion rings and Sonic gets fat to the point if you eat too many rings without running around enough, you will just sit there and kind of die.
11532000	11535000	But he gets a big ol' potbelly. That's kind of funny.
11535000	11545000	And that's actually a real ROM hack. You can actually download the ROM that's available on the Sonic Retro forums, forums.sonicretro.org.
11545000	11548000	So check it out there.
11548000	11562000	Can I say this real quick? Because bonds006 in chat just spoke up and it reminded me of something he said earlier that I forgot to mention, but apparently he ran into like a New York Times reporter who was doing a story on DDR and BeatMania and stuff.
11562000	11567000	He totally pimped our show. Now that's a fan. Now that's a fan.
11567000	11569000	Thank you! We love you now.
11569000	11570000	I saw that in the chat.
11570000	11577000	Yeah, I forgot to mention it earlier. I was going to mention it after the iTunes review, but you know, I'm easily distracted by shiny things. So I apologize.
11577000	11596000	You may remember there's a company called Blick that puts out different gamer decals or vinyl decals you can put up on the wall. I'm using them in our nursery. But if you're not interested in New Super Mario Brothers or 8-Bit Mario or Donkey Kong, you can now get your hands on some Atari ones.
11596000	11610000	They have Centipede and Asteroids. And they're available for $45 for a full set. They are kind of expensive, but they're kind of neat if that's what you want to put on your wall.
11610000	11616000	Could have just done that for the baby room. Although I don't know, the Centipede one's a little creepy.
11616000	11619000	It's kind of dumb. Asteroids isn't bad. Centipede...
11619000	11622000	I think it's... actually are those up on ThinkGeek?
11622000	11626000	They've got 8-Bit Mega Man ones coming at some point. That's going to be awesome.
11626000	11638000	If I married a gamer nerd someday, you know, like, I think that would be an awesome addition for our house. Like, honestly, I think Dark Soccer should have that up in the vault. I think that looks kind of cool. Although, actually, the way the vault's designed, that wouldn't really work.
11638000	11654000	Dan and I actually did have a talk, because I'm sure I've mentioned it on the show before, before we were going to, you know, when we were talking about a kid, we were going to do a Mario theme. And Dan said, uh-uh, Sonic.
11654000	11663000	That'll be great, too, because at Loki's house, it'll be Mario, and then you'll have Sonic. What do I get, Crash Bandicoot?
11663000	11668000	Yes.
11668000	11675000	Crash Bandicoot? Crash Bandicoot was fun for, like, three games, and then they just totally, like, beat him into the ground. I'll get Kevin Butler.
11675000	11682000	Kevin Butler-themed nursery? That would be creepy.
11682000	11684000	Why is the baby crying all the time?
11684000	11688000	I don't know what's going on!
11688000	11703000	Anything else? Yes. Cave has announced two more SHMUP games coming out. They are going to be releasing, I guess, Gwanji on Xbox Live Arcade.
11703000	11715000	Or, I should say, yeah, they're going to be releasing that. What else are they releasing here?
11715000	11729000	Oh, here we go. Kai Katana, or Red Katana, is going to be a new Bullet Hell shooter coming out. I believe that's going to be on, I think, the download services, like Xbox Live Arcade.
11729000	11735000	And then for the iPhone, they're going to do Dondopachi Daifukkatsu.
11735000	11738000	Yay! I totally want Dondopachi on my phone.
11738000	11753000	And that'll be coming out of the iPhone this summer. So, that's kind of cool. Let's see. Screenshots here of, uh, that's a private video. Well, fuck you, I don't want to read it then. Or watch it, whatever.
11753000	11772000	Apparently, Amazon Germany has listed a Xbox 360 4GB arcade system bundle. Of course, they've already announced that they're going to be doing some sort of arcade system this fall in the US and other territories.
11772000	11783000	But now we kind of have an idea of what it's going to be. It's going to be probably that slim down system without a hard drive, but a 4GB memory stick, or not memory stick, USB thumb drive that you're going to be able to use with it.
11783000	11797000	And that's fine, since, remember, you can actually put in your own laptop drives into the Xbox 360 S, or whatever the hell you're going to call it, just like you can on a Playstation 3.
11797000	11813000	That's kind of neat, I guess. But that'll be available this fall. It looks like it's going to be, well, right now it's listing at 148.99 euros.
11813000	11834000	So, um... I believe that's it.
11834000	11847000	I think Apple needs to work on, I don't know, making the iOSes work on their phones first.
11847000	11861000	I'm raging because I have a 3G, and the iOS 4 upgrade just borked it, and it kind of was pointed out to me, and I think it was a very good observation that they do this to make me upgrade, and it stinks.
11861000	11863000	That's all I'm saying.
11863000	11869000	And I know, then I shouldn't get an Apple, I shouldn't buy an iPhone, I shouldn't support them. Maybe I won't! I don't know.
11869000	11873000	No, we all know I'm going to get that shiny, white, new iPhone, because I want it.
11873000	11875000	Alright.
11875000	11878000	ST100Matt is currently working on a Kmart review, I'm so excited.
11878000	11881000	Okay, that's it, though, for the show now.
11881000	11886000	Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show, and listening to us, and downloading us, and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
11886000	11898000	We can't do it without your support, you know, we don't have massive advertising or anything like that, it's really word of mouth, and the awesome reviews you guys do, and telling reporters and shit about us, that is word of mouth at its finest.
11898000	11907000	Thank you guys so much, we so appreciate it, and you guys are the reason we come back week after week, and don't let the State Fair distract us from doing a show.
11907000	11910000	Alright, but Disneyland might, I'm just putting it out there.
11910000	11916000	Alright, anyhow, for now, though, we're going to go around and give everybody's final thoughts. Uh, Loki, why don't you start us off tonight with your final thought?
11916000	11921000	I want to make some of these custom Mario Kart tracks for the Wii. They look fun.
11921000	11924000	And I can make some pretty killer tracks, probably.
11924000	11929000	My final thought is, my server on WoW is scheduled for 24 hour maintenance this week.
11929000	11937000	Nooooooo! Just kidding, I'm going to play lots of Team Fortress 2, and Left 4 Dead 1, and these other games I've been meaning to play forever.
11937000	11939000	Dark Soccer, your final thought?
11939000	11941000	My Sim's house is freaking gorgeous.
11941000	11945000	You've put a lot of flowers in it, it's a very girly house because you have flowers everywhere.
11945000	11950000	Well, it's not very girly, it's this one part of it that's set up as a wild flower garden.
11950000	11952000	And those are totally Sakura trees, aren't they?
11952000	11960000	Yeah, they are. But the rest of the house is very sort of neo-modern, and my house floats. We all float here.
11960000	11969000	Alright, that's it. We're tuning out and signing off. Thank you guys so much again for your support. We'll be back to do it all again next week.
11969000	11975000	We'll see you next week with more of Orange, unless Loki's wife has the baby, then he won't be here.
11975000	11977000	Because that could happen at any time, so stay tuned.
11977000	11979000	I hope she doesn't have anything.
11979000	11981000	Yeah, well that's true. She's still got what, another month, right?
11981000	11984000	Preferably at least two weeks.
11984000	11987000	At least two weeks, alright then. So hopefully two more weeks of Loki at least.
11987000	11994000	Alright, but that's it. Have a wonderful night everybody. We'll see you soon next time here on Orange Lounge Radio. Good night.
12017000	12024000	See you next time.
