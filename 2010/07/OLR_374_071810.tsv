13778	24774	Tonight, July 18, 2010, 3D YouTube is set for the PlayStation 3, details come out on Mega Man Universe, and one retail chain puts user reviews on the shelves.
31584	36869	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36969	44016	We are that video game show dedicated to video games, gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, you name it.
44216	48500	You talk about it live in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
48940	49821	My name is Rob Roberts.
49861	55286	I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
55607	56167	Hi.
56327	56988	How are you doing, Jamie?
57642	58162	Hi.
58643	59403	You're high?
59763	63526	No, actually, um... Starting the Prop 19 celebration a little early?
63646	64927	No, no, no.
65628	66808	I've got Vicodin in me.
67229	67609	I see.
67629	70511	Because I've got a slice in my hand.
70802	77487	Yes, you had your surgery, as we've been talking about for a couple weeks on the show, because it was scheduled last week, but it happened for real Tuesday, right?
77747	79628	It did, and it was really boring.
79929	83011	But you're here, so obviously you're doing alright.
83491	85052	Yeah, it hurts.
85773	86153	I'm sorry.
86193	87554	Well, Vicodin's supposed to help that.
87862	91345	No, Viken and Samosa make you not care.
91525	92185	Samosa?
92565	93106	Samosa.
93186	94827	Oh, it's going to be a fun show, folks.
94867	96548	Well, I was fun yesterday, though.
96648	98150	I was really entertaining, I feel.
98490	104154	I'm going to get into yesterday in just a minute, but it would not be a show if I didn't introduce the one and only Techmaster Loki.
104818	107019	It would be a show, I just wouldn't be introduced.
107720	108380	How are you doing, Loki?
108940	109641	I'm doing fine.
110121	110581	Excellent.
111061	113303	How's the baby room painting going?
113323	122047	Because I've seen pictures show up, and for the listeners who might be new to OLR, who are just tuning in for the first time, Loki's wife is expecting really soon, right?
122227	123588	August 19th, but she's 35 weeks and 3 days now.
123708	123908	Wow.
123928	124368	So, you know...
131472	132673	Becky was 10 days overdue with Julian.
159045	168515	But yeah, so any day, basically they get to the point though, the doctor will only let you go up to 42 weeks and then they just said, okay, now you're having the baby.
168796	170137	We're inducing you and you're going.
170337	181009	So, no, but Nellie, she's hoping to have the baby by the end of the month, you know, preferably at 37 weeks, which would be a week from this coming Thursday, so.
181489	184431	and we don't know what's going to happen to OLR while you're gone.
184512	187474	Knowing you, you'll be here even if she delivers Sunday morning.
187514	189675	I will probably be gone at least a week or two.
189896	190536	That's about it.
190616	197561	It is so funny because they're seriously like people like vultures clamoring for your spot while you're gone even that one week.
198682	201104	Like, you know, Drew's been showing up more and more lately.
201384	205886	We got an email tonight that Jamie's going to read later that has another suggestion.
205946	206987	So it's really funny.
207007	208348	Oh, it's too bad he's not here this week.
208428	209889	It really only takes three weeks.
211530	213951	But unfortunately, he was shy one week.
214051	215512	So that ain't going to work.
215632	216373	Well, we'll figure it out.
216393	222218	But the point I was actually trying to make, for those that didn't know, you are doing your baby room in a, what, New Super Mario Bros.
222279	222819	theme, right?
222839	223740	Yes, New Super Mario Bros.
223780	224000	theme.
224200	233710	So we've been painting a lot, and actually I'm trying to get them uploaded on the photo gallery thing, but it's been a little on the slow side.
233990	236713	There's some pictures right now on there that are really...
238134	239555	It's a lot of work ago.
239816	243799	I mean, there's a lot of stuff we've done since the stuff that I posted.
244360	253208	And I'd say it's about now maybe, I don't know, 60, 75% done.
253989	255210	And this is all the base stuff.
255250	257712	We still have to go back and actually shade it so that it looks...
258653	259494	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
287037	287558	AllGamesRadio.com
305396	306017	DarkSakura.com
332815	339359	Um, California Extreme is a classic arcade and pinball type of expo thing.
340179	346142	And they have, uh, speakers, d-panels, you know, typical convention stuff, but all the games are out there on free play.
346662	351745	And they've got, like, pins dating back from the 50s and up.
352745	357608	Um, they even had the Iron Man pinball there, which, by the way, was not very exciting, because
357868	359488	Stern, sorry, you sucked at this one.
359968	364889	I was way more interested in the Dark Knight table they had a picture of, but didn't actually have there.
365049	367650	Yeah, that's supposed to be pretty hardcore.
368050	369430	Do they have Big Bang Bar, though?
369630	375792	I'm glad the people that bring... And it was the real Big Bang Bar, not the... Because they got the rights to redo Big Bang Bar.
376312	379712	Okay, I gotta rewind, because you know how disjointed I'm gonna be tonight.
380533	387334	Big Bang Bar was a table they were only like 16 prototypes of that Capcom's pinball division did before they decided to not do that anymore.
388134	416732	and um they eventually did the rights did get out and someone was doing reproductions of them but this was one of the 16 prototypes so it was pretty cool um anyway um they had like they had the Star Wars pachinko machine they had old pong they had a game called touch me it was clearly it was very 70s um cocktail tables sit downs um a really nice Star Wars arcade
416932	419974	It was kind of like going into Microsoft's game room, but for real.
420254	420774	And Journey.
420854	422275	Like if it was a real place.
423036	426918	They just take this ballroom and just lots of arcade and more pinball than I was expecting.
426958	429580	I didn't realize how much of it was dominated by pinball.
429600	431501	They had Ultra Pin there, too.
431701	434683	The Ultra Kade pinball thing.
434703	435544	That was a cool machine.
435584	436704	I played Pinbot on that.
436744	437165	It was cool.
437245	438485	I've played one of those before.
438505	442008	I played Black Knight for a while on there, but it's not the same for me.
442168	444049	I've wanted to make one of those, but it really...
444594	445614	It's cost prohibitive.
446215	447135	It's really expensive.
447155	458058	I have an extra TV that I could use for that, but it's just, I don't play that much pinball, and considering how much I play my arcade machine, I don't need to build one of these.
458599	465981	Let me go to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com because we do get live chat comments as we tape the show, and I'm going to start with Salacious Pop tonight.
466021	467041	He was there with us yesterday.
467081	468802	Salacious Pop in our chat says, Hi!
468822	468862	Hi!
469182	475488	I played a few rounds of Lethal Weapon 3 pinball but try as I might I could not unlock the hidden racist misogynist screed
477888	483892	I was hoping they would update the pinball machine so that when the ball goes down the gutter it would yell at you, I deserve to be blown!
484553	486194	But unfortunately, no.
486334	486955	Not gonna happen.
488556	489176	Anyhow, sorry.
489536	490297	Classic games.
490937	491358	Good times.
492058	492599	Free play!
493099	494240	You pay one fee to get in.
494320	495361	It was $40 to get in.
495561	496862	I got in for nothing.
497542	500224	I got in as press for Geek Life.
500524	505588	Which, by the way, there's gonna be a big write-up on this showing up tomorrow morning on both Orange Knowledge Radio and on Geek Life.
507401	509582	I had a geeky time while I was there.
510283	513124	I was playing a real gyrus machine and a real time pilot machine.
513424	515645	You can't emulate that so well on the 360.
515705	522549	The Tempest kept having problems with the vector display.
522729	525350	Crystal Castles with a real trackball the way it was meant to be played.
525910	526971	I've got a trackball for it on the 5200.
527051	532073	I know this is going to surprise people.
532153	535095	I don't believe I had ever played the Empire Strikes Back game.
535575	536075	Isn't it great?
536095	536756	Star Wars?
537056	537336	Yes.
537476	538636	And the Star Wars Vector game?
539457	540497	Man, that game was epic.
541578	542498	Oh man, I love that game.
542518	551142	That one, the one that they had there, the sit-down one, had like this really nice bright monitor and the speakers were just so clear.
551242	552422	It was fantastic.
552482	554023	It didn't sound muddy or anything at all.
554323	556444	Though I got a bad headache playing it and it hurt my hand a lot.
557124	564585	I didn't really play a whole bunch of stuff while I was there because... And we'll probably go into the surgery thing later.
564605	566226	I've got eight stitches in my right hand.
566426	566846	Good times.
567086	577948	And while I'm healing really nicely, they hurt a lot because unlike my last surgery when I moved my hand, I've got more range of motion now, but it pulls the stitches.
578688	579008	Ew.
579168	581829	Yeah, well, it'll bleed a little bit.
581889	582289	It's really...
584409	585970	But you were able to play some stuff.
585990	586530	I played some stuff.
586570	587430	I played Baby Pac-Man.
587450	588590	I had to play Baby Pac-Man.
588610	588890	Me too.
589251	593172	And that game, for being notoriously hard, I always remembered being kind of good at it.
593272	596873	And I got to the third stage, which is not bad for Baby Pac-Man.
598093	602095	They had a Junior Pac-Man, which is like one of the really epic Pac-Mans of its day.
603475	607216	Of course, I played Big Bang Bar and Iron Man Pinball.
608377	608457	Um...
610537	612898	I didn't play Journey.
613298	614199	I played Star Wars.
614239	614819	I played Journey.
614859	615379	It was awesome.
615559	618200	I played Timber twice because I love those old school.
618220	634206	I played Mousetrap and then Mousetrap though is the big mistake because Mousetrap has a right hand joystick and I was like and I forgot about the stupid bird because keep in mind when I was playing a lot of Mousetrap I was playing it on the Clicca Vision and there's no bird in the Clicca Vision.
634588	635029	Is there every year?
650842	653825	to like pour some sugar on me.
653845	655626	On the little four cube TV?
655767	655967	Yes.
656007	657148	Yeah, it's there every year.
657308	659530	One of those TVs that's made up of little TVs.
659550	660151	It was awesome.
660231	661552	Yeah, totally 80s style.
661852	663414	But there's more, Rob.
663554	664154	There's more.
664435	664595	What?
665055	665976	Coin Toss was there.
666657	667738	I love the Coin Toss game.
667878	670280	It's like one of the old 50s games.
670320	671181	It was so fantastic.
671541	673443	Like one of the precursors to our Pong.
674773	682395	But anyway, there was the box car game, the Sega box car game.
683196	684296	Oh yeah, the mine car.
684316	687517	You actually push up and down on the big lever like an old mine car.
687537	688357	It was funny.
688377	692638	And Top Skater and DDR something or the other.
692838	693259	Extreme.
693379	696039	I took some video of Mel and Ali playing.
696119	697740	I actually got up there and played DDR.
698500	699201	I'm not allowed to.
699221	700062	How mad am I out of shape?
700242	702584	I'm not allowed to play DDR until my stitches come out.
702624	702845	No.
703105	703926	I can't get my heart rate up.
703946	704486	You didn't miss much.
704686	708470	I'm not supposed to get my heart rate up, y'all, so I can't get very excited tonight.
709871	711313	Looking at our chat room at chat.orangeonsradio.com.
713815	714695	I always say this name wrong.
715055	717756	Shirzo in our chatroom says, sounds like a nice spot.
717856	719877	Damn, I need to plan to get out to California Extreme.
720217	721937	Now, I think he's kind of local here.
721957	722597	I think he's our guy.
722617	723758	It was in Santa Clara.
723778	725738	That does the Roseville Golf Line and everything.
725778	729059	But would this be something worth traveling to?
729459	729919	Totally.
730259	730719	Totally.
730739	733100	Yeah, there were people there from out of country.
733980	736662	I think they could... I mean, here's the weird thing.
736742	743346	It's an arcade trade show, so I get that they don't want to expand on probably that core part of it.
743766	749530	But you know what would have made that expo even more awesome would have been a classic gaming room with console stuff.
749570	750391	That reminds me.
750591	755394	And I know that might be outside the scope of what they're trying to do, but... Classic gaming expo is coming back.
756198	756498	Oh yeah?
756918	757599	In Las Vegas.
758259	759059	We need to make plans.
759179	761460	This was different from Classic Gaming Expo though.
761500	764041	Classic Gaming Expo was its own kind of thing.
764081	770524	Yeah, Classic Gaming Expo was more like booths and things set up to remember but this was just straight up a room full of free play games.
770584	779988	I love the story though about because Dan's little brother Mason came with us and they were at this panel and Mason's like, who's that?
780008	780688	What did that guy do?
780748	781348	Make Atari?
781428	783409	And Dan's like, why yes, he actually did.
783909	784470	And it was the...
785770	791513	I got to meet Steve Ritchie who designed at least a couple of the tables that we have in this house.
792554	793014	No Fear.
793214	794695	He did the voices for No Fear.
794995	800418	I gave him some of our plastics to sign and he started doing the voices from No Fear.
801179	802620	I was just so cool.
802660	803200	I talked to his wife.
803220	804000	She's a really sweet lady.
804721	807302	I told her about a pinball table that I'm designing.
807922	811324	I'm actually designing the art and everything and the layout for a pinball table.
811384	812525	I just need someone who can program it.
813278	817459	Vid Power in our chatroom says, California Extreme was in the Donkey Kong documentary, King of Kong.
817499	818179	I don't remember that.
818779	820300	Was that the place they go?
820860	822420	I thought that was a place on the East Coast.
822820	833083	But they go, it's like an exposition's going on, and Billy, not Billy, the other guy, Steve, tries to top the score at this expo, but he just barely misses it.
833143	833663	He doesn't do it.
833683	837143	Well, no, he did this at conventions since, I thought.
837343	838084	Yeah, I don't know.
838424	839424	But anyway...
840044	842105	No, Steve Wiebe's been, I think, at these conventions.
842125	847568	Yeah, and all those types of guys you see in that documentary are here at this type of event.
848208	848648	Good times.
849769	857973	Anyway, though, and then there were vendors for pinball parts and, you know, a Stern marketer was there, the guy who brought the Iron Man table.
858753	865857	And the guy that plays the 12-string guitar thing was there because he's there every year and he's always really cool.
866537	895619	I just had this I giggled to myself and I walked I was walking sort of catty corner around and all of a sudden in the distance I hear bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk the Space Invaders thing and then there's also one of our listeners there really cool guy Carlson really cool guy and I purchased a game from him from my husband got him got Gunstar Heroes for the Game Gear
897650	898071	Treasure!
898391	901494	I was surprised to see him there because the last time I had seen him was out in Washington, D.C.
901654	904176	And he's based in the East Coast and is mostly the cons out there.
904576	907319	But I guess he has a relative that lives out here.
907499	908920	So he was at this con.
909120	917167	Very random moment because I was actually looking at the shirts at his booth and he has this really funny, I guess it's his own original design, it says like Shaq Fu
917307	946188	I loved that and I almost I like was thinking about buying it but then I got distracted because he's like hey Rob and like I was like oh wow I remember you from like four years ago so this is kind of funny like running into people well he recognized me and I didn't know who he was or anything well it was funny I was looking for you to go introduce you to him when you just found him on your own oh good times you just cut out suddenly did your switch go down
946680	947441	No, I don't have a Switch.
947681	947961	Oh, weird.
948622	949162	I don't know what happened.
950884	951404	Well, meh.
951625	953726	Tonight is going to be a night of technical fun.
954267	955508	The soundboard's on Vicodin.
955808	964696	All right, well, before we get to the rest of our gaming weeks outside of, oh boy, outside of just this convention, is there anything else you want to say about California Extreme?
964716	966157	Maybe the thing you most want to see them do next year?
968380	971562	Do it exactly like they did it and make it cheaper.
972303	972663	And bigger.
973204	973624	And bigger.
974484	976266	Oh yeah, bring back the Kung Fu game.
976706	978567	What game wasn't there at Kung Fu Master?
979248	979808	It wasn't there.
980789	984291	And, and, and, damn it, somebody bring a theater of magic.
984992	986513	Because Melody and I were annoyed.
987153	987454	Alright.
988594	990596	Well, DarkSakura, I know you had the surgery.
990676	994298	I don't know if you've been playing a lot of video games, but outside the expo, did you play any video games this week?
994539	995119	How was your gaming week?
995529	996810	I'm playing Sims right now.
998152	1000514	Um... I was playing some Sims.
1001835	1009202	Um... I tried to play Star Trek Online, but it hurt too much, so I just went on to let my fleetmates know that I wasn't dead of gangrene of the hand.
1010403	1011825	Um... Um...
1013596	1015157	Dan beat Crackdown, finally.
1015577	1016957	It was anticlimactic.
1016977	1017517	First one or the new one?
1017537	1018017	Second one.
1018097	1018418	Oh, wow.
1018538	1019458	It was anticlimactic.
1021739	1023799	And I also really hate the guy in that game.
1024840	1026760	He's like, are you trying to piss me off?
1027501	1029481	Go back to the tactical location.
1030041	1032062	I just wanted to tell him, shut up and bite my butt.
1032122	1035003	You sound like you've got a wedgie.
1037684	1041145	And I know I played something else.
1042990	1043771	I don't remember.
1045152	1046694	You're too high to remember.
1046994	1047775	No, no.
1047795	1049757	You're playing The Sims right now?
1049777	1051499	I said I was playing The Sims.
1052120	1054102	Oh, I played a little bit of Portal.
1054322	1055083	A little bit of Portal.
1055423	1056004	Just a little bit?
1056204	1056945	Just a little bit.
1057585	1059868	It's just like... Just enough to get taunted by GLaDOS?
1060248	1066471	Yeah, it was just like, I'm getting so bored not being able to do much of anything that I'll sit and start to play something.
1066491	1077317	Like with The Sims, at least, you know, I can do a little bit and rest my hand, but if I get in the middle of a battle on Star Trek Online, I'm there until it's done, because you can't actually pause it unless you're on a away mission.
1077477	1079058	Yeah, MMOs don't usually have a pause button.
1079538	1079838	Yeah.
1081139	1083500	The only ones of those you can pause are the ones you're on there by yourself.
1084440	1084660	So.
1085201	1085361	Alright.
1085861	1087482	Yeah, and it's only 45 seconds, meh.
1088910	1089591	Let's try Loki.
1089771	1090731	How was your gaming week, Loki?
1091312	1092692	I didn't play a whole lot because I was paying.
1093133	1095494	So, really, the only stuff I played was at work.
1095534	1096114	Gloria Paint!
1096494	1097075	Literally!
1098235	1098696	That's true.
1099216	1100056	That is true.
1101257	1106140	No, the only things that I played this week was... Actually, Grand Theft Auto, but...
1107033	1110474	Kind of funny, we didn't really play much of the Battle of the Gay Tony this week.
1110574	1120157	Apparently my co-workers are tired of me kicking the crap out of them at the Battle of the Gay Tony, so they went back to Lost and Damned, so I had to kick the crap out of them in Lost and Damned.
1121037	1121737	But it's fun.
1121797	1122677	It's a nice little break.
1122857	1130139	I just... I always forgot how slow the characters run, and oh my god, they run so damn slow in that game.
1130359	1131120	It's ridiculous.
1131740	1135741	And I don't know if they've remembered it being...
1136381	1137262	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1155135	1156556	Crackdown 2, played a little bit of that.
1156897	1170827	The only thing I don't like about Crackdown 2, well, there's many things I don't like about Crackdown 2, but one of the new things I don't like about Crackdown 2 was our internet at my work is not the greatest because we're sharing it with like 80 computers.
1170867	1171688	I mean, it's ridiculous.
1172208	1173629	Crackdown 2 Crackdown 2 Crackdown 2
1195163	1195904	It's impossible.
1196164	1204089	I can join another person's game away from our work, but it will not allow me to connect to a person that's literally next to me.
1204369	1207291	Is that maybe because the game is seeing you guys in the same room?
1207431	1208292	No, it's not.
1208412	1213575	The reason is it's saying that our connection is too strict.
1214256	1218539	It's basically layman's terms for our internet connection is too slow.
1219019	1225023	I do just want to point out though, Loki, you do know most people don't get to play Xbox at their jobs, right?
1225223	1226384	Just throwing that out there.
1226624	1237608	I understand that, but I'm just saying during our break, we wanted to play some co-op Crackdown 2, which would have been really fun, but we can't do that and say we have to play Lost and Damned.
1239849	1244431	But I just wish that they... First off, I wish they just had System Link back from the first game.
1245131	1246612	That would solve all the problems right there.
1246792	1258799	Well, most of the problems, because even Red Dead Redemption is a good testament to how Take-Two and Rockstar games still find ways to fuck up multiplayer.
1259900	1264543	Even in Red Dead Redemption, it sometimes can't find the other people.
1265263	1265783	Like, we'll be...
1266684	1267164	Red Dead Redemption
1295982	1297263	How the fuck does that happen?
1297563	1303585	I have never seen a System Link game not figure out how to connect to another System Link console.
1303625	1304605	It doesn't make any sense.
1305446	1306906	Only Rockstar could do that.
1308407	1311928	But yeah, so that's about all I played this week.
1312749	1321832	Hopefully going to play more once we get the Baby's Room done because we're under a deadline here and I have a little bit of work left to do.
1323273	1323853	It's looking good.
1324563	1346358	Alright, well good luck with the rest of that, and our well wishes to the misses as well, and through all that My Gaming Week, outside of California Extreme, I've been playing mostly the same stuff, I didn't get into a lot of new stuff I would say the newest thing I played was some of the extensions that they have in Game Room now You know, some of the recent games that they released, but of course that's just really old stuff with new paint on it
1346898	1368665	and I can't tell you how horrifically games like Kaboom and Crystal Castles and things that ran on the Xbox I mean things that ran on like trackballs and paddles how horrifically they translate into the Xbox 360 controls but there are some other cool stuff on there that I was playing like Hero, H-E-R-O was still one of my favorite games
1369205	1386645	they did some changes to game room this week too where now you have like a live leaderboard as you are playing the game you watch yourself climb up this live leaderboard on the right hand side of the screen that's actually really cool so um I kinda was a fan of that that's only a ranked match by the way so you have to actually own the game to be able to see that but um
1387125	1389588	Xen, Pinball, and Pinball FX Big Battle
1405666	1410369	Because the response from the listenership so far has been a little bit tepid, but I'll get into that in a little bit.
1411510	1413751	So I was trying to help represent OLR in that, and I tried.
1414011	1417213	I didn't get at the top of leaderboard, but at least I got on it.
1417653	1418834	So I'm happy with that.
1419334	1422917	And I hadn't really played especially the one on the PS3.
1423237	1428380	I don't think I appreciated it enough, but that Earth Defense Force table on PS3 is actually a lot of fun.
1428720	1434264	And I actually kind of enjoyed getting to spend a little time with it this week as much as I was not...
1434784	1435064	DarkSakura.com
1457800	1462821	So since I brought up the big battle, let's go into housekeeping here tonight before we get into tonight's gaming news.
1463841	1472643	Big battle is all games kind of competition with these various video games throughout all the different shows on all games.
1472703	1473643	Well, most of them.
1473663	1482585	I don't think all of them signed up, but quite a few are participating like Dead Pixel Live, TQ Cast, RPG Grinders, Electric Sisterhood, all these other shows on the network.
1482625	1484225	Sorry, I didn't name them all, but they're all there.
1484885	1509613	at TheBigBattle.net and it's really just for fun it's not although I hear now there's a prize I got an email this week that now there is a prize so get this the winning show and this is not about the hosts of the show doing battle with each other although I'm choosing to participate this is about the listenerships representing the shows in these battles well the winning show now as I understand it is going to get a gold Atari 2600
1511373	1516495	So it's like, I think it's just spray painted gold, but it will be an Atari trophy.
1517036	1519957	So I know DarkSakura is dying to have one of those in the vault.
1520317	1526820	Although, I do think if we get a gold Atari 2600, we should maybe, I don't know, give it to a listener that helped us get it.
1527520	1528281	Maybe, I don't know.
1528321	1528701	Go for it.
1528721	1529481	We'll have to decide.
1529641	1536584	Rob, if I really wanted a gold Atari 2600, I would go find one of ours and get a can of Rust-Oleum.
1536765	1537985	It's the meaning behind it.
1538205	1539946	It doesn't mean the same when you do it that way.
1540186	1542770	I know, but I'm just saying we can give it to somebody.
1542830	1545814	Well, I'll tell you right now, the way the leaderboards look, we ain't gonna get it.
1546174	1547676	We are in second place.
1547956	1549919	We're gonna win a gold 32X.
1550239	1552362	But we are way behind Dead Pixel Live.
1552382	1554345	Dead Pixel Live has 164 points.
1554425	1556808	We have 42, which has us in second place.
1557709	1560131	How many things have already completed already?
1561032	1565775	I think three, but there's still more going on right now.
1565895	1567516	We got off to a little bit of a slow start.
1567576	1573661	The whole thing started right when E3 was going on, and then my birthday and the fourth were all in there.
1574161	1579385	It took a little while, I think, for us to really get in there, but there's more games happening.
1579525	1586130	I think a lot of the early feedback we got was, I don't have Soldner X, and I don't really have the pinball game, so what's there for me to play?
1586710	1589951	Derek's been very open to putting stuff in there.
1590051	1592552	So I can tell you, and it looks like it's scheduled now.
1592592	1593632	I didn't even know it got a date.
1593672	1595713	But it looks like it's going to happen on August 1st.
1596153	1597553	Super Street Fighter 4.
1598353	1601154	Now I know tons of you bitches have that game.
1601194	1601914	I'll make Dan play.
1601955	1602655	And can represent.
1602875	1605996	Get Dan to sign up at TheBigBattle.net and represent the OLR.
1606016	1606876	Because seriously.
1607396	1630692	If we lose Super Street Fighter 4 or we don't have good representation of Super Street Fighter 4 We're just going to kiss that gold Atari thing goodbye Because it ain't happening This is a game that I know we can do well at I'll blame everybody personally Yes, I will be blaming certain individuals that are very, very good at Super Street Fighter If you don't participate in this, unless you have a really good reason I will blame you personally
1632293	1637777	But it's, yeah, TheBigBattle.net, and it's August 1st, and sign up and participate.
1637797	1638537	But there are other games.
1638577	1642920	If you're not a Street Fighter person, Forza's going on right now, and I wonder if we have people in Forza.
1642940	1643560	Like, I'll tell you this.
1644181	1647122	So far, we can really thank Arcadian42.
1647483	1649284	Really made a good showing for us in Pinball.
1649564	1654467	Like, he got us seven points on Zen Pinball, and he got us another seven points on Pinball FX.
1655447	1659110	I got us like four on one and three on the other.
1660010	1660470	And let's see.
1660530	1664353	We actually have Monty Boggs participated and got us three points on Pinball FX.
1664373	1668575	So thank you, Arcadian42, Monty Boggs, and me.
1669136	1672458	The rest of you all, you need to go find a game you can help us out with.
1672518	1673218	I'm injured.
1673578	1673879	All right.
1674359	1674599	Fine.
1674639	1677621	You can sit on the bench due to injury, but depending on how long this thing goes.
1677741	1678742	A B-R-O-N done.
1678902	1679242	Look at this.
1679282	1679562	Look at this.
1679582	1679882	Look at this.
1680262	1680643	Burr.
1681443	1684065	Eight points on Forza Motorsport 3 right now.
1684545	1712107	way to go Burr you rock keep up the good work and there's also Super Stardust HD is the other competition going on right now and I oh we holy crap we are leading the leaderboard right now in Super Stardust HD who is Zooey who is a Z-O-O-I I don't recognize that name from chat I don't know who Zooey is but that's from us to you because you're currently kicking butt in Super Stardust HD good job
1714358	1716280	and Battlefield Bad Company 2 is also happening.
1716860	1717241	So there it is.
1717301	1718041	BigBattle.net.
1718081	1718402	Have fun.
1719743	1726548	DarkTetsuya says in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com I thought I heard a rumor there was going to be a music game in an upcoming battle.
1726708	1733995	I have heard that same rumor meaning that it's probably going to happen but it probably won't happen until after some of these other competitions happen.
1734475	1735075	So go for it.
1736236	1736637	There you go.
1738230	1739952	Other housekeeping I wanted to get to tonight.
1741874	1742874	I want to talk about the feed.
1743355	1748279	Most people shouldn't notice this, but the podcast feed actually moved this past week.
1748319	1755485	And I want to take a minute to thank Deekman and Jason, VXJasonXV, who do a lot of work on our website.
1755546	1756566	And I'll tell you, Deekman...
1757507	1777498	he kind of did this whole thing where he moved our podcast and he's doing it so that way usually when I post a show it takes like 24 hours for it to show up on the website because someone has to go in there manually and do it but that won't happen anymore like when I post a show it will be instant so most people are going to be able to get their shows faster and that's going to be really good news so
1779720	1787666	I'm hoping nobody notices the differences, but if you do, just sit tight while we are under construction a little bit.
1787686	1796633	But I'm hoping if you're listening to this show and you're on the podcast feed, then clearly your feed player and all that updated and noticed the change just fine.
1796653	1798115	You don't need to do a darn thing.
1798595	1806982	And for those that did not move, Jason was kind enough to record a little special message that will show up over there for those folks that know they have to resubscribe.
1807302	1834594	so I'm hoping that is all better and all that good stuff now so that's just some maintenance going on on the website and also an excuse for me to thank the guys that make it happen Deekman and VXJSXV like Deekman put together this whole little like training manual like here's how you post to the website step one it's like the type of thing I do at my day job and we pay him nothing because we have nothing so it's very much appreciated by all of us as all of you listening should appreciate it too
1835779	1838080	How about some actual bonafide gaming news now?
1838120	1838440	We ready?
1838700	1840681	30 minutes into the show, we're gonna touch on some gaming news.
1841442	1844043	Loki, what is going on in the world of PlayStation?
1844603	1845664	Absolutely nothing.
1845884	1846764	Just kidding.
1847705	1852547	Actually, in September, there will be some stuff going on, including the 3D Blu-ray support.
1853207	1853647	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1877522	1884211	And then, of course, with that, there's also going to be some... Wait, wait, isn't the regular Blu-ray just happen to be regular and 3D?
1884231	1886434	I don't think you buy a special 3D Blu-ray.
1888143	1892386	So you could own the movie and just not have a 3D TV because they're kind of pricey right now, right?
1892466	1895148	No, I do believe that it's actually a different movie.
1895328	1896449	It's a 3D Blu-ray.
1896749	1898150	Wow, I didn't even know that existed.
1898170	1907035	The regular movie you can watch, I think, with the glasses, the magenta cyan or the red-blue stuff.
1908076	1914340	But no, this actually requires a special... You have to buy your movies all over again, yes, just in case you thought, you know...
1915885	1916625	BlueRay was enough.
1917266	1918806	If you want them in 3D, you've got to buy them again.
1919026	1919527	Oh, great.
1920567	1922828	Because it's, you know, more expensive that way.
1923868	1932232	Also, there's going to be some additional support for, apparently, Play TV in Europe is going to be in 3D as well.
1932712	1938334	Different broadcasts through that, as well as YouTube supporting 3D content over the next 12 months as well.
1938815	1941976	So there'll be 3D YouTube stuff, which...
1944167	1946289	It begs the question, and this is my thing.
1946709	1947010	Why?
1949012	1950173	That would be the second question.
1950353	1950653	Why?
1950973	1960502	The first question is, I understand, okay, YouTube, okay, great, we've got 3D YouTube, but as far as I'm aware, there's not really 3D film cameras.
1960582	1964185	Like, I can't go out there and buy a camera that shoots in 3D yet.
1966412	1970095	YouTube isn't just underground stuff right now.
1970355	1973637	There's a lot of big studios who use YouTube to push their stuff.
1974057	1977400	I understand that, but I'm not going to be able to see...
1980100	1984482	Some viral video or something like that, you know, in 3D normally.
1984642	1986382	And why?
1987403	1988803	Like you said, why bother?
1990344	1993445	It's because... This 3D thing is happening too fast for me.
1993705	1995706	But you know why that they're pushing it?
1995846	1996086	Why?
1996126	1998307	It's because Sony is selling 3D TVs.
1999547	2005049	And Sony has movies, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, that happen to be in 3D Blu-ray.
2005489	2006570	They figure, hey, look!
2007330	2008911	Look what we did for Blu-ray already.
2009231	2010871	We beat HD DVDs.
2011371	2013812	Now we can convince people to buy 3D Blu-ray.
2013892	2015793	So they're kind of like riding on a high right now?
2016113	2018274	They're basically thinking, you know what?
2019134	2025476	Yeah, we may have fucked up UMD, but hey, we won in Blu-ray, and now we're going to try our hands at 3D Blu-ray.
2025656	2026496	It'll print money!
2027477	2029738	But I have the... Here's my thing, though.
2029978	2030378	People...
2031578	2040123	Some people, not even all people nowadays, are willing to make the jump to Blu-ray because the picture quality is pretty good compared to a DVD.
2041857	2043399	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2061397	2063439	and so, yes, it is a bit early.
2063479	2068803	It's why you're not seeing, you know, Microsoft jumping on the bandwagon with this stuff because it's way too damn early.
2068823	2073547	You don't need to be putting out 3D games because most people don't have the hardware to play them.
2074808	2077250	Going to chat.orangehonestradio.com and some comments there.
2077310	2083455	Tiger Claw says, if the studios have their way, they will release the regular Blu-ray version and a couple months later, the 3D version.
2083795	2084195	and DarkSakura.
2109326	2113028	You're basically just shooting the theaters all over again because now what are they going to do?
2113348	2117010	Well, I'm not going to the theater to watch an expensive 3D movie.
2117090	2118611	I can watch those 3D movies at home.
2118691	2122073	And how many people remember this particular parallel happening in the video gaming industry?
2123094	2129397	When basically you could get a Dreamcast which basically ran things like a Naomi system back in the day.
2131218	2135941	It's just a matter of consumer technology bypassing the mass technology.
2136667	2142469	What comes down to is really Sony doesn't give a crap about movie theaters because they don't own movie theaters.
2142669	2148291	They sell movies to these movie theaters and they could care less if their technology is going to impede on their business.
2150652	2151612	Can I just say this real quick?
2151632	2153233	Because I think DarkSakura makes a good point.
2153973	2157314	I think things like the 3DO and the CDI come to mind.
2157775	2160896	Those things kind of, to me, feel like they were a little ahead of their time.
2161616	2167119	and like the technology was really cool but the games were kind of crap and too much money.
2167439	2168039	You know what I mean?
2170640	2173502	I think a lot of that stuff was really ahead of its time.
2174304	2177765	I think all this stuff is a little too soon as well.
2177785	2182126	We've got other people in chat saying, Katsune in our chat room, yeah, I just got my HDTV.
2182206	2184266	I'm not going to get a 3D TV anytime soon.
2184347	2185127	Probably never.
2185467	2188007	And Miyamoto also thinks the 3D thing is happening too soon.
2188287	2193889	But see, the 3DS, I'm a lot cooler with that because let me tell you the best thing about the 3DS.
2194249	2198030	There's a little lever on the right side and when you get sick of 3D, you just turn it down and it goes off.
2198871	2221849	The difference between the 3DS and the PS3 The PS3 to see 3D, it requires you to buy a bunch of additional hardware Glasses that are really expensive The TV that's really expensive The 3DS, you turn it on and you see 3D And if you don't want to see 3D, you turn the little slider down
2222849	2243938	and the great thing about that too is if you know games say for example don't want to use 3d but they want to have a really high resolution well not really high resolution but a pretty high resolution screen they could do that because now the amount of pixels that are on the second screen are nearly doubled and it's widescreen so you can do pseudo HD type stuff on there if you want to um
2245905	2251148	Sony's official guidelines for 3D gaming on the PS3 limit the displayed image to a resolution of 720p.
2264815	2274266	Even games that run natively at 1080p, like Super Stardust HD, are downscaled to 3D mode to two 720p images, one for each eye.
2275087	2277129	And I'm guessing this is because...
2279071	2279612	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2299612	2311148	1080p also expenses the 60 frames per second so for example Blu-ray movies run at 24 frames per second um
2313163	2314604	I don't know, it's interesting.
2315744	2318605	Honestly, with resolutions and stuff like that, I don't really think it matters.
2318685	2321546	I mean, if you're looking at high def in 3D, it's not going to matter.
2321566	2322226	It's going to look cool.
2323447	2325548	Whether it's 1080p or 720p.
2325568	2328329	I mean, when you have the glasses on, you don't really give a shit.
2328349	2331590	You're like, oh damn, this is just horrible in the 720p.
2331950	2334731	What am I, like, a peasant here?
2335031	2337152	This is ridiculous.
2338052	2339153	It's not enough pee for me.
2339333	2343036	I need more pee.
2346178	2362530	One thing, though, kind of going back to this that I had to laugh about, and this isn't even really the 3D stuff, but it just kind of stuck out to me in my mind during the Sony press conference because it made no sense to me as far as an actual feature that you would advertise to your customers.
2363411	2366293	One of the things that they said regarding the PlayStation Move is like,
2367313	2368974	Thank you for watching!
2382703	2403824	and that was a feature that they threw out there and I'm like I've never seen people not able to put you know two different control schemes on one disc before because of disc space oh my god we can't fit why would you even put a separate copy of the game on the disc that's a little redundant if you ask me I'm trying to think I think you could go back like 15 years
2405986	2407488	Super Nintendo, King Arthur
2425863	2431386	and because they were released later on would be those new play control games because they have the Wii Remote.
2431406	2433408	But that was added later and that does not count.
2433488	2435109	I mean, that is not something that they released.
2435329	2438551	That was the equivalent of re-releasing the same movie on Blu-ray 3D.
2438751	2439571	Yeah, exactly.
2440131	2444474	And I'm sorry, but nobody is making that argument.
2444614	2452799	Oh, well, you know, you're going to have to buy a separate version of Halo 4, the Kinect version because we just can't fit it on those pesky DVDs.
2453499	2454860	We have to create a whole other game.
2455498	2456218	That's just stupid.
2457219	2461801	Going to another little side conversation in our chat room, SSJ100Matt is saying, do we really need 3D?
2462401	2465143	And some of the response is, no, no, no.
2465323	2466343	It's a stupid gimmick.
2466624	2475628	Well, and then the other thing, if you want to argue it, 3D is obviously taking away some sort of processing power from your games.
2475948	2479690	So they're going to have to make the games slightly less powerful.
2480110	2484373	You gotta think that that's got a bottleneck somewhere.
2484393	2484433	So...
2509091	2534249	I just don't think I've ever really experienced 3D where it was like oh my god blow my hair back amazing like this is just like when I went and saw Avatar in 3D I was like okay this is cool but I probably would have liked the movie just the same in 2D I wasn't like oh my god 3D was just everything I was moved to tears it was better than having my dick sucked it was amazing you know it just wasn't that amazing
2534963	2535784	Great, you know?
2536705	2537867	3D was not necessary.
2538087	2545577	I thought it actually added a very good dimension to the movie, but that was... It was neat, but... Wait, you wouldn't have felt the same way about the movie in 2D?
2545837	2550143	I probably would have liked it, but if I had seen them both side by side, my preference would go to the 3D.
2551665	2558406	If it's going to cost this much money to upgrade right now too, it has to be truly... Well, it's not cost effective right now.
2559567	2561207	I mean, it's by no means cost effective.
2561407	2565288	And just wait anyways because it's only a matter of years before holograms.
2565348	2567228	And then you're going to have to buy your hologram TV.
2567488	2569749	One step closer to the holodeck, as we always say.
2569789	2573729	That's gaming's ultimate goal is the holodeck from Star Trek The Next Generation.
2574250	2576510	Everything is just one step closer to the holodeck.
2578104	2579365	I have a holodeck in my backyard.
2579465	2584369	Frisbee says, question, all games suggest that you take a 15 minute break after one hour of playing.
2584409	2586751	How many people will hurt their eyes with this 3D stuff?
2587191	2591875	I'm kind of curious what the safety manual and disclaimers are going to look like on the 3DS.
2592015	2592896	I'm very curious.
2592976	2594657	Don't play for more than five seconds.
2595678	2597340	Well, here's the best part about the 3DS.
2597880	2602144	If it starts bugging your eyes, there's a little slider to turn the 3D off.
2602424	2603865	Oh my god, and that's awesome.
2604931	2610095	One of the comments I wanted to read, SJ100Matt in our chatroom said, Give it five years, maybe there will be enough support for it.
2610395	2611736	Right now there's nothing worthwhile.
2611836	2613497	It's all James Cameron's fault.
2613898	2617480	Maybe that stupid rant he had in E3 2009 actually meant something.
2617540	2622144	I don't remember that rant, but apparently he got up on stage and talked kind of about the 3D stuff.
2624445	2625406	We weren't ready for it.
2625426	2627288	We're not ready to handle it.
2627648	2630030	You can't handle that extra D. You can't handle the truth.
2630511	2634314	But look at 3D and what it's done so far to cinema.
2635275	2637176	We're getting a lot of gimmicky movies.
2637336	2643982	And we got a lot of gimmicky movies back when the red and blue glass 3D was really popular.
2645863	2646984	Just a lot of like...
2648205	2649866	Final Destination in 3D.
2649986	2651667	Oh, look at the head flew towards me!
2652408	2653709	Saw in 3D.
2653869	2656990	Oh, look at the head flying towards me!
2658091	2659052	Jaws in 3D.
2659212	2660613	Oh, look at the head flying towards me!
2661013	2664095	It's basically the same stuff over and over.
2664195	2671139	And a lot of these movies that don't necessarily need 3D, like Clash of the Titans, have the 3D tacked onto it, and it looks like shit.
2671259	2672800	So, take that...
2673660	2677324	and add that to, say, games, and now you're going to get 3D games that look like shit.
2677804	2689315	It just occurred to me, I thought of something that was, blow my hair back, amazing, 3D experience, that 3D was intricate and necessary to the presentation that would not have been the same without it.
2690176	2690877	Captain EO.
2691217	2692278	I was thinking the same thing.
2692538	2696619	Well, and remember that seventh portal thing, the Marvel thing at Great America?
2697619	2699059	Those rides that are like that.
2699519	2701080	The Muppet Show.
2701640	2703220	Captain EO, really.
2703780	2705681	Captain EO was first, and Captain EO was what, 1985?
2705721	2705681	86?
2707541	2708161	Yeah.
2711842	2715282	When Captain EO comes out on these 3D TVs, wake me up.
2716083	2717663	Then maybe I'm ready for 3D TVs.
2719577	2722538	In the meantime, let's move on to something else that's completely unnecessary.
2722558	2723858	Can you imagine if they did a Captain EO game?
2725458	2726879	That's what the Michael Jackson game should be.
2727619	2729259	None of this imitate his dance moves.
2729279	2731520	I don't give a shit about that.
2731800	2735020	Captain EO and Michael Jackson Moonwalker 2.
2735620	2736080	Amazing.
2736401	2737381	Moonwalker HD.
2740281	2743082	SSJ100 Matt says your other answer is Lawnmower Man.
2745948	2749991	Remember when virtual reality was like the big... Oh my god.
2750011	2750991	Virtual reality.
2752332	2753013	They tried.
2753213	2755494	And stock footage of all the Mind's Eye stuff.
2755534	2756755	Ooh, that was really cool.
2757716	2761578	Yeah, I remember back in the day when virtual reality stuff was really big.
2762899	2764400	God, we were stupid back then.
2764861	2765201	Alright.
2765901	2769403	Speaking of things that are completely useless and unnecessary, Real ID.
2769723	2771344	Had to do that.
2771364	2773025	That's a fantastic tie-in, Rob.
2773085	2773825	I'm very proud of you.
2774385	2775966	Three weeks in a row I'm talking about this.
2776006	2777247	And look, look, again, I'm going to say this.
2777407	2784711	I know a lot of you could give two shits about World of Warcraft, but this is important because where Blizzard goes, other companies will inevitably follow.
2784771	2785931	I'm going to keep it brief this week.
2785971	2790493	There's two quick things that happen to Real ID that are newsworthy and necessary to cover.
2791154	2793255	First off, this is kind of one of those like,
2794943	2798504	Part of it's really funny, and the other part is actually not funny at all.
2798724	2809588	And that is that a bunch of people, when this real ID, and going back to when Blizzard was saying, oh, we're going to post your real name to the forum whenever you want to make a post, right?
2809608	2811528	Remember that whole thing they had to retract last week?
2811908	2814489	Well, a lot of people complained to the ESRB.
2814969	2817870	And a lot of people wrote them and said, this game is violating our privacy.
2817930	2820011	You should go back and re-rate this game.
2820191	2820511	Right?
2820871	2821531	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2847805	2871637	well here's the part about it that really sucks all of the people that wrote in to complain yeah all of their names and email addresses were in the to field because somebody didn't think oh I should put those in the BCC field so all of the people who complained had their email addresses exposed
2873531	2875433	Oh, they're going to sue.
2875653	2880737	And now, granted, ESRB wrote an apology not even 24 hours later.
2880797	2881918	They sent out an apology.
2882098	2885801	And the nice thing was they kind of addressed the irony.
2885941	2887263	They didn't try to beat around the bush.
2887323	2896250	They did say in their apology, "...the fact that our message addressed individuals' concerns with respect to their privacy underscores how truly disappointing a mistake this was on our part.
2896630	2901254	We work with companies to ensure they are handling people's private information with confidentiality, care, and respect."
2901574	2904415	It is only right that we set a good example and do no leves ourselves.
2904835	2907376	So at least they didn't try to give you a BS corporate answer.
2907516	2908537	Well, I mean, to some extent.
2908557	2909737	It was a little washed out.
2909757	2913059	You know when they said that, like, aw, crap.
2913099	2915160	Well, first off, you know an intern did this.
2916720	2920502	And secondly, like, when he hit the send button, you know he went, aw, fuck.
2920842	2921942	I'm going home.
2921962	2924083	Please, please, please.
2924243	2924783	I gotta go.
2924963	2926424	Please don't crap on interns.
2926464	2927625	I'm planning on being an intern.
2927785	2928505	I am an intern.
2928525	2928605	I'm...
2929326	2930086	I'm just saying.
2930387	2932309	It's not that I'm crapping on interns.
2932689	2934351	An intern designed the FedEx logo.
2936133	2936433	Okay.
2936673	2938616	The Federal Express logo or the FedEx logo?
2938636	2939356	The FedEx logo.
2940337	2940458	Eh.
2941879	2942700	It's clever.
2942720	2948747	Regardless of whether it was an intern or the CEO, you know after clicking the send button they went, ah, fuck.
2949961	2950941	Thanks for watching!
2973444	2975324	There's more in the Real ID saga.
2975964	2984266	And this is important because after all the ranting I've done in previous episodes, if Blizzard's going to come out and say, oops, we made a mistake, we should change it, I think it should be acknowledged.
2984446	2986607	And to some extent, that's what's happened this week.
2987107	2993508	Nethera, who's one of the community managers, did post on the official WoW forums about some Real ID follow-ups.
2994308	2998709	One, my biggest complaint about the system as it was, the Friends of Friends feature.
2999870	3006675	She went on to say, they've been evaluating how Real ID has been used since it's released to identify the new functionality that will help improve our players' experience, blah, blah, blah.
3007035	3014681	The in-game Real ID Friends of Friends list is designed to give players a convenient way to populate the Real ID Friends list, blah, blah, blah, corporate speak, corporate speak.
3014961	3027851	Oh, however, we recognize that some players would prefer not to be displayed on friends lists in this fashion, so we plan to include an option that will allow players to opt out of appearing on their real ID friends, friends of friends lists.
3028091	3030873	This should be ready by the first StarCraft 2 patch.
3031173	3032774	Yay!
3033855	3035757	Yay, someone knocked some sense into Blizzard.
3037205	3040287	But I'm not totally over this yet.
3040607	3044510	Am I to the point now where my number one concern with real ID was addressed?
3044650	3044890	Yes.
3045690	3055036	But I still get a little nervous because remember last week we had that story about the one line of code that would show your real name out there?
3055116	3056717	Now, yes, it was hotfix, blah, blah, blah.
3057093	3058033	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3078798	3091506	and after all this mess of the past few months and Real ID and this whole trying to get closer and closer into bed with Facebook I'm kind of really concerned about what Blizzard has planned for their next MMO.
3092687	3093508	FaceCraft?
3096892	3099354	What are your plans for Facebook integration?
3099794	3106238	With regard to Facebook, our goal is to help Blizzard gamers on Battle.net more easily connect to their real-life friends and family.
3106538	3112162	For the launch of StarCraft II, we are introducing an optional Facebook Friend Finder feature to help achieve this goal.
3112523	3122970	The Friend Finder enables players who decide to use it to easily populate their Battle.net friends list by sending real ID friend requests to the people on their Facebook friends list who have Battle.net accounts.
3123550	3126652	We hope players will find this feature convenient, but it's completely optional.
3126972	3127713	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3127733	3139161	So in other words, you can now, if you want to go onto Facebook and pull all of your friends' real IDs from your Facebook, you can do that, I think is what they're saying.
3140122	3140922	Do not want!
3141322	3148627	This way, people in China that may have to leave their game to visit friends and family don't have to do that.
3149528	3151270	They can sit there and play their games.
3151731	3154474	I do not like this direction that Blizzard is going.
3154534	3156016	They are a gaming company.
3156076	3157998	Stop trying to be a social network.
3158959	3161422	Throughout all of this, what they really should have learned...
3165182	3166103	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3183118	3188886	These guys should come in, sit down, and really ask themselves, why are we here?
3189768	3191290	What is the goal of our company?
3191971	3194434	Why do people pay us $15 a month?
3194595	3195215	To make money.
3195496	3197839	That's all they're for the money.
3199201	3207768	Do they pay us $15 a month so that they can have their real lives, be reminded of their real life and their Facebook friends and all this all the time?
3207908	3208088	No.
3208448	3212331	People pay $15 a month to escape the real world and slay internet dragons.
3212672	3213592	That is why they pay the money.
3213612	3215994	Are people leaving the game in droves because of this?
3216194	3216595	Yes.
3217375	3218176	I don't think they are.
3218416	3218856	We're sorry.
3241900	3244382	and then they'll come right back and then they'll get screwed again.
3244442	3245862	Salacious Pop says this beautifully.
3246223	3250385	If they are already a real life friend, I know where they are because I've met them.
3250525	3253787	If I want to be on their Facebook, I will call and ask.
3254548	3254928	Perfect.
3256331	3256771	You know what?
3257952	3275920	From here on out, until Blizzard has decided that they are not going to get into bed with Facebook so much anymore and keep sucking their dick as they've been so much recently, until Blizzard comes out and says, we are games first, I'm going to be referring to Blizzard as Bazinga.
3276260	3277421	Because that is what they are.
3277721	3279822	They are Blizzard meets Zynga.
3280922	3282705	So Blazinga from here on out.
3282745	3285308	When I say that on the show, you know who I'm talking about.
3285348	3297584	But until they have decided, you know what, we are a gaming company first and maybe we should not try to get so much into the social network stuff or push it down everybody's throats as hard as we've been, they are Blazinga.
3297924	3311036	and Blazinga needs to take a cue from Xbox Live because I think it's one of the things that Microsoft has done very, very well in Excel Z. And the great thing about Xbox Live, it does have that community feeling.
3311336	3318923	You have achievements and messages and you have that Facebook integration if you want it and you can find Facebook friends if you want to.
3319363	3322306	It's done right on Xbox Live, I think.
3322466	3327589	I don't understand why they make it like you can't... Like all of a sudden I have to find my friends out there.
3328049	3331411	I mean, there's so many social networking sites out there right now.
3331471	3334532	Twitter, Facebook, MySpace if you're still using it.
3334613	3335693	And a whole bunch of other sites.
3336153	3337254	And games that do this.
3338014	3341056	Why do I need their help in connecting with my friends?
3341356	3344318	I've already connected with my friends probably a dozen times now.
3345752	3354159	and, you know, there is still the phone, there's still mail, there's still, you know, email, there's still a bunch of other ways to talk to your friends.
3355280	3363327	I just don't understand, it's like, oh my god, I'm cut off from the rest of the world unless, unless I, I use Blizzard to connect with my friends!
3365648	3366188	Let's see here.
3366609	3371010	TigerClaw in our chatroom says, Sky, maybe they should pull an Apple and do a Q&A press conference, lol.
3371310	3375471	Well, that's why BlazingaCon 2010 this year is going to be awesome.
3376011	3380952	Because there are going to be some of those people that bought tickets before all this shit happened that are going to the con.
3381212	3383493	Those developer Q&As are going to be awesome.
3384133	3386836	I hate BlizzCon.
3386936	3392741	I kind of think it's kind of ridiculous and I have zero interest in going and paying $150 to go to one company's E3 booth.
3393102	3395904	But look, this would be the year to go.
3396024	3402851	It's the point where I'm seriously considering getting the direct TV feed because those Q&A sessions are going to be awesome.
3405157	3408439	Angry nerds in the building with the developers who anger them.
3408699	3409460	They will not be angry.
3409500	3411021	Reality television show.
3411041	3413362	They'll be drinking the Kool-Aid.
3413522	3415223	Tables will be overturned.
3415503	3418785	They'll be taking it and they'll be like, hey, look at this we got for you.
3418805	3421907	And they'll be like, oh, I forgive you for everything you've done.
3422167	3423708	That's so awesome.
3424089	3424629	Oh, my God.
3424929	3427170	Unicycles now in World of Warcraft.
3427210	3429132	That's just the best thing ever.
3429992	3431552	People are sheep.
3431812	3432493	And you know what?
3432573	3445495	The people that follow Apple products, the people that follow Blizzard products, and countless other different brands out there that just eat up this shit despite all the crap that they do, they're gonna still be playing the game.
3445515	3446956	They're still gonna forgive them.
3447276	3447816	And you know what?
3447856	3454698	If they leave for World of Warcraft, they'll come back for whatever the fuck next MMO they've got because, oh, Blizzard's fun.
3454918	3456378	I'll give them another try.
3457156	3463719	No one's gonna... No one really just up and just says, Oh, forget it.
3463840	3465000	I'm not dealing with them anymore.
3465040	3469162	Until their next shiny thing comes out, they're just gonna be right back where they were before.
3469603	3472744	I will say that I have quit MMOs from principle.
3473625	3475946	So... But... Go ahead.
3476026	3477507	But that's just the type of person I am.
3477647	3479768	If I don't like something, I'm not gonna put up with it.
3480068	3482529	But would you go back if your problem changed?
3482809	3483510	Probably not.
3483890	3484210	Really?
3484350	3484851	Probably not.
3484951	3485371	Well, I mean...
3486567	3486987	What came?
3504754	3504935	Yeah.
3520834	3521395	I agree with him.
3521575	3521875	I agree.
3522276	3528783	This kind of reminds me though, SSJ100 Matt says, are you people still mad at Blizzard about no LAN support?
3528803	3529724	Blazinga, please.
3530385	3531306	Blazinga, whatever.
3531346	3532267	That's your thing, okay?
3532367	3535070	I'm not going to try to remember that because that's stupid.
3535090	3537132	The name's stupid.
3537152	3538494	I'm with the work on the name.
3540055	3541936	Because Zynga are the people that make Farmville.
3541996	3542896	I understand that.
3543056	3544877	I get the reference.
3546018	3548119	We don't need to point more attention to them.
3549220	3554543	No, I was just saying that he brings out a perfect point.
3554783	3559866	Because they took out a feature that really pissed off everybody else and they're like, oh, I'm boycotting the game.
3560966	3566789	How much do you want to bet that StarCraft 2 sells millions of fucking copies and it would be like as if
3568030	3569051	That never happened.
3569291	3577516	As if those features were never removed that maybe the fans still bought it anyways despite being pissed off at the company.
3577596	3582199	So you're basically saying never forget you were pissed about the LAN thing.
3582759	3583499	Never forget!
3584838	3585799	I've got more of those.
3586540	3591024	There was something else I saw earlier this week that reminded me of it.
3591645	3595469	I guess we can talk about it real quick because it sort of ties in with Activision.
3595909	3597130	Real quick because we've got to move on.
3597190	3597691	Real quick.
3597791	3598191	I'm sorry.
3598792	3600394	There's another tangent I have to go on here.
3600434	3601034	Okay, real quick.
3601875	3622948	Remember how I brought up, and no one seemed to give a fucking shit about it, remember how I brought up that Activision is starting to price Wii games, remember the Wii games usually are 50 bucks retail at the most, for 60 dollars retail for certain games because they think that they should get some more money because, you know, music licensing or whatever.
3623209	3625350	I forgot, thank you for reminding me to never forget.
3625450	3630435	And I'm not saying that Activision is the only one to blame, too, because Beatles Rock Band, same thing happened with that.
3630455	3633999	They were charging $60 for the Wii version of the game.
3634019	3634620	Well, guess what?
3635301	3638764	It's been another year, no one's really complained, and it's happening again.
3638925	3639445	And guess what?
3639465	3646212	It's not just happening now with music games, but the new Tony Hawk game is also going to be $60 on the Wii.
3647914	3648554	Why?
3648955	3650295	No one's going to buy it anyways.
3650335	3652136	And now you're giving them another reason not to buy it.
3652196	3656818	But also, you know, Guitar Hero, Warriors of Rock, I'm sure DJ Hero 2.
3657439	3659340	Those are all $60 price points.
3659560	3663402	You guys need to not forget this stuff because they're going to start sneaking out more games like that.
3663482	3666883	And I know for me, that's not a big deal because I don't game that much on the Wii.
3666923	3668724	But for other people, it might be a big deal.
3669224	3672106	And if you don't stop it here, they're just going to keep going.
3672146	3674767	What's going to stop them from saying, oh, well, now we're adding 3D interface.
3674867	3676247	to our 360 games.
3676428	3677808	They're going to be $70 retail.
3678028	3678668	Vote with your wallet.
3679028	3681429	Seriously, so point it out.
3681589	3683810	I think we should make Lokis never forget a regular segment.
3685030	3687871	Ray Iannami says he doesn't play any Blizzard game anyways.
3687931	3700095	You know, you may not play StarCraft 2 or Diablo 3 or this unannounced MMO, but the reason why we spend so much time on it, and I apologize, I know not everyone's into WoW, but keep in mind, WoW is that behemoth of an RPG game right now anyway.
3700535	3703396	Where they go, a lot of the industry tends to follow.
3704907	3707188	Blizzard right now is the Rockefellers.
3708069	3709670	Back in the day and you know what happened with them.
3711592	3712813	Go back and read a history book.
3714054	3717917	This came up last week and I think it's doubly true after a lot of this Blazinga talk this week.
3718057	3719639	The WoW killer is WoW.
3720780	3722141	It's just a matter of when.
3723081	3728206	I will tell you what the WoW killer is not because I was reminded I didn't even mention this during my gaming week.
3729686	3732147	I played the Final Fantasy XIV beta this week.
3732607	3733728	I spent a little time with it.
3733908	3736989	This is my little tangent I wanted to get on because I forgot to mention this during my gaming week.
3737369	3739449	I played the Final Fantasy XIV beta on Tuesday.
3739490	3741590	I'm not sure if I'm actually supposed to be talking about it or not.
3741730	3742050	Who cares?
3742230	3742571	Who cares?
3743791	3744351	I'll tell you this.
3744671	3747932	It's not my account, so I'm not under any NDA.
3748072	3750073	So anyhow, I'm not going to tell you whose it is, though.
3751276	3753457	I played the beta and it's awful.
3753997	3755177	It is awful.
3755918	3761379	It is horrible, awful, laggy, not fun.
3762440	3764741	I'm not buying this game when it comes out if it's in this shape.
3765281	3767782	Granted, it's a beta, not a demo.
3768162	3775044	Betas are buggy, betas are slow, but betas also are supposed to give me an impression at least of what I'm to expect in the final product.
3776385	3799837	I got dumped into this world with no explanation what I was supposed to do, where I'm supposed to go, how you proceed, all these fancy big words of guildlevs and armathith crystals and these quests and all these things, and I realized I could probably go online and figure it out, but I thought the big thing about Final Fantasy XIV was that it was supposed to be
3800217	3802338	more accessible than Final Fantasy 11 was.
3802839	3805640	It's not in its current shape.
3806180	3807781	This game is supposed to come out September 30th.
3808102	3809242	It is not ready.
3810083	3810483	Not ready.
3812560	3813360	I'll try it again.
3813420	3817642	I'll try the beta one more time before the actual game's released to see if maybe they added some expositions.
3818022	3818522	I will say this.
3818862	3820563	At first, I was like, ooh, this is pretty.
3820903	3822184	Ooh, this cutscene is so pretty.
3822444	3824044	Ooh, my character's in this cutscene.
3824164	3826545	Oh my gosh, this is a beautiful game.
3826785	3827926	This looks so amazing.
3827966	3830707	This character customization's really thorough.
3831207	3838330	And then I was stuck in the city running around for an hour because I had no idea where the hell I was supposed to be going.
3838570	3839410	or what I was supposed to be doing.
3839430	3840031	I want to try it.
3840411	3840971	It's bad.
3841071	3841772	I still want to try it.
3841872	3842292	It's bad.
3842532	3843172	I want to try it, though.
3844773	3845633	Just so I can see how bad.
3847234	3850316	SSJ100Matt says, So wait, Rob, what you're describing is Final Fantasy XI.
3850416	3851096	Yeah, kinda.
3851396	3851696	Yeah.
3851816	3859260	At least with Final Fantasy XI, I don't know, maybe it was because I had friends that played, but I still feel like I was able to figure it out somewhat, but like...
3860583	3886567	I went into combat I was fighting like a rat or something I don't even know and like I got frozen in combat and the rat wasn't targetable anymore and I had to like abandon the quest and if I wanted to start the quest again I would have had to run 30 minutes back into town like it's just it was ridiculous again I know it's a beta I'm not supposed to be giving my final impressions on the game but if the beta was supposed to be like raising my excitement for somebody that spent three years of his life playing Final Fantasy 11 didn't work tell you that
3889540	3890140	That's a shame.
3890400	3891441	Yeah, it is a shame.
3891761	3892221	It's a real shame.
3892241	3896723	What's also a shame nowadays is that it will still be released on the 30th.
3897583	3902125	And what will happen then is just, oh, we'll patch it later.
3905267	3907307	Well, I mean, they still have time to patch it, but not much.
3908028	3909568	All right, let's actually get to another story.
3909588	3912630	I'm sorry we've taken up so much time with real ID and stuff.
3912670	3914651	But, you know, this stuff's important.
3914751	3915571	Jamie, what do you got for us?
3915999	3917200	One about a story I never played.
3918981	3919221	Nice.
3919381	3922063	But that's okay, because a lot of people love games on Facebook.
3922423	3923424	And a lot of people love Zuma.
3923844	3925245	I think you said you liked Zuma, didn't you?
3926005	3926686	Zuma's pretty fun.
3927026	3935251	It's not my favorite PopCap game, but I don't think there's any PopCap games that are really bad, per se.
3935731	3938013	They get the job done, as far as casual games go.
3938593	3939514	They're all crackerific.
3939554	3940254	I love Peggle.
3940694	3941475	I love Peggle, too.
3941935	3946477	At any rate, Zuma Blitz is going to be coming out on Facebook.
3946577	3951259	They're supposed to have in about three weeks with a beta.
3951899	3962784	And then we should start seeing tournaments and levels and experience points and getting different features and a treasure chest and virtual currency and blah, blah, blah.
3963344	3964785	So it should be cool.
3964885	3967346	I mean, it's going to go up there with Bejeweled Blitz.
3968266	3969587	And that's got a lot of people playing it.
3970806	3973848	I like me some Zuma and it should be good.
3974168	3976089	I know a lot of people eat that up, especially on Facebook.
3977310	3978390	It's going to be cool.
3979691	3983593	The only thing that I play on Facebook right now is that Hotel City thing.
3983613	3984814	You know who would like that?
3986634	3987155	Extifer.
3987415	3988135	He used to play lots of Zuma.
3988155	3989336	That's right, he did.
3991077	3991857	Someone should tell him.
3992417	3993198	He should be listening.
3993498	3995419	Blazinga, take note.
3995599	3998201	PopCap knows how to do the Facebook integration thing.
3998261	3998721	Just saying.
4001336	4004584	and um well
4006232	4006732	No, never mind.
4006972	4007813	We've beaten this horse.
4008673	4010814	It's already dead and bleeding from his pores.
4010834	4011514	Give it another whip.
4012455	4013455	You haven't said enough on this.
4013495	4014956	We didn't skin the horse yet.
4015256	4016136	It's not over until we skin the horse.
4016156	4017537	Because my Vicodin's wearing off.
4019958	4026301	I really think that, well, I was just thinking about what you said about them really needing to sit down and go over their business model.
4026801	4030883	But what if this is actually a true integrated part of their business model?
4030923	4031583	Abandon ship.
4033980	4036081	I'm going to just go back and say one thing about it.
4036181	4040964	Everybody, if you really are displeased with it, do it in numbers.
4041264	4043665	Hit them in the bank and do it with people.
4043885	4044445	Organize.
4046166	4048147	But then where will I fight my internet dragons?
4048767	4049608	There's other games, Rob.
4051549	4052789	It's just not the same.
4053009	4054710	What did I say last time?
4055691	4057151	Principle versus entertainment.
4057311	4058052	What's more important?
4058952	4059232	I don't know.
4059252	4060613	I really like entertainment, Jamie.
4063662	4066024	Entertainment Rob rarely got anything going in motion.
4068407	4069948	Well, this is interesting.
4070008	4075273	THQ apparently is impressed by the 3DS piracy protection.
4075934	4083722	Of course, you may remember the piracy has been a really big problem for the Nintendo DS and, you know,
4084162	4084642	and many more.
4108631	4137932	he added they combated piracy on the DSi which they don't believe is cracked yet but they know they've been hurt across the world and they believe that the 3DS has got the technology to stop that I'm kind of curious what that is but I guess they can't tell us or the pirates would start getting to work well here's my observation about that Nintendo thinks that they've stopped piracy on the DSi really
4138450	4142312	I mean, because I've seen flashcards for the DSi.
4142332	4147113	I'm not going to go buy a DSi because I'm probably going to pick up a 3DS eventually.
4147213	4153556	But, I mean, they haven't stopped piracy on the DSi, so...
4155896	4159299	and they're just going to get smarter.
4159519	4167306	Since it's basically cartridges it's reading off of, if you can mimic the data that's on there, then I don't see how it can really stop it.
4167346	4170428	They have anti-piracy measures that they put into the games, but
4171229	4174471	It takes like a week or two to crack them at the most.
4174832	4179835	A lot of them get cracked day one, if not early, because they come out in other regions.
4180615	4185198	I guess we won't really truly have the second half to this story until 3DS is out.
4185258	4189221	We know what that anti-piracy measure is, but it just seems like an echo of what we always hear.
4189281	4199928	It'll probably take a few months, but considering the technology is still going to be somewhat backwards compatible because it's going to be playing DS games, it's going to probably be as easy to crack as the DSi.
4202070	4202950	It'll be a matter of time.
4203010	4205913	I don't think they've finally solved the problem.
4208554	4211296	Well, here's something, and maybe this ties into it.
4211337	4211657	I don't know.
4211697	4212798	This could be interesting.
4212878	4222305	But you know the 3DS has something that they talked about briefly called Tag Mode, which I always thought was supposed to be a part of the regular DS, but it kind of wasn't.
4222525	4224166	But anyway, what Tag Mode's supposed to be
4224770	4231252	It's a passive communication feature that lets the DS systems talk to each other and send the data back and forth.
4231612	4234113	Which I always thought was some type of... It was in the DS, right?
4234133	4236354	Because you could carry Animal Crossing around in your pocket.
4236714	4244176	But of course now you had to have the game on and you had to be in that mode that sent out the letter in the bottle or whatever it was, that mode.
4244196	4244596	Remember that?
4244916	4246437	You could send the letters in the bottle and...
4247077	4250580	But anyhow, I'm assuming this tag mode doesn't require that?
4250600	4253482	Like maybe your DS can be off and it still will tag?
4253882	4257504	Maybe it uses low battery power to still kind of do this when it's asleep?
4257645	4257845	Yeah.
4257905	4258225	I don't know.
4258745	4266751	But there is a little more information given by Hideki Kono, who is the platform producer of the 3DS, in an interview with Wired Magazine.
4267251	4276218	He says, "...in the hardware, we have the capability that when you first play a game that supports tag mode, it will save to a tag mode data slot in the hardware system."
4276658	4279239	We're planning to support multiple games at the same time.
4279519	4280259	So that's the difference.
4280279	4282879	Mario Kart, Nintendogs, Animal Crossing, and so forth.
4283019	4285540	I see, because right now the game does have to be running.
4285940	4289421	So there'll actually be a tag mode viewer where you can manage the data.
4290261	4296982	It will bring consumers a sense of wanting to play a game again after they get new data from games that they'd already forgotten about.
4297322	4300243	What if the piracy is firmware updates delivered through tag?
4302057	4303378	I'm sure that's one way they can do it.
4304179	4305080	That's what I'm thinking.
4305120	4306661	Maybe that's one of the ways they're going to do it.
4307481	4308242	You don't have a choice.
4308322	4311865	These things are going to show up on your system because you walked by someone else with the newer firmware.
4314482	4315443	Wouldn't that be amazing?
4315523	4316223	I bet that's it.
4317104	4318766	I bet that's one of the anti-piracy measures they have.
4318806	4328213	Well, one of the original ways that they used to have the flashcards kind of work is they had some sort of thing with the Wi-Fi where you could do something with that.
4328234	4328714	I don't remember.
4328734	4331016	I probably sound like an idiot with this.
4331336	4341364	But I know there was something that involved Wi-Fi at one point with the original DS flashcards and stuff when they were first getting those to work with proprietary code and stuff like that.
4342045	4342145	Um...
4343366	4344528	Thanks for watching!
4361707	4362688	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4382452	4384594	Look at LittleBigPlanet, though.
4384634	4388618	Or ModNationRacers, which that's the whole thing, basically.
4388698	4389218	Exactly.
4390539	4391580	Such a missed opportunity.
4392401	4399186	SSJ100Matt, in commenting on the possible maybe tag mode is the anti-piracy, SSJ100Matt says, Nintendo isn't that smart.
4401708	4402129	Let's see.
4402669	4404731	ToyGak says, Wireless is a battery hog.
4404791	4405652	It better not be on.
4406996	4407996	You can probably turn it off.
4408637	4418899	Well, yeah, and maybe there's probably a thing where it uses really, really low battery until it detects that DS, and then it uses it for a minute and then shuts back off.
4420180	4424241	I don't see why the technology isn't there to do that, where it slowly drains your battery.
4424521	4427742	But the battery power, you know, it's been, what, five years since the last DS?
4429402	4431083	Sorry, not the last DS, but the first DS.
4431644	4434249	I would think they've probably made the batteries in those things a lot better.
4434530	4437856	And it's not like the games probably require that much more battery.
4438317	4441524	I mean, yeah, they're 3D, but I don't think it's gonna be that much more.
4444188	4447629	and SJ100Matt says, yeah, it does sound like the Pokey Walker type of technology.
4448249	4451690	SJ100Matt also says, maybe they can track me via my 20-digit friend code.
4452491	4455172	Didn't they say they're going to... Oh, God, I hope they're not going to do friend codes this time around.
4455192	4459813	I think they kind of hinted they might be doing away with it or changing it, I suppose.
4459833	4461914	10-digit friend codes, woo-hoo.
4462914	4463214	All right.
4463234	4464315	One-digit friend codes.
4465315	4466975	All right, let's move on to another story.
4467015	4471837	DarkSakura's got something for us and then release dates and the classic game of the week is not too far away.
4472697	4481079	Well, for fans of Josh Stone, she's going to be the next Bond girl, at least in James Bond Bloodstone.
4482639	4483439	Josh Stone.
4484540	4485200	Bloodstone.
4485220	4493802	She'll be playing Nicole Hunter, who is a socialite, works in diamonds, and said that she thinks it's crazy to be a Bond girl.
4494882	4503549	So, um, just talking about having full body scan and everything, but it's supposed to be a third person, um, cover based shooter with vehicle stuff in there.
4503849	4504730	It's the bizarre creation.
4504770	4506251	Including cars and speedboats.
4507452	4508412	So, should be fun.
4509073	4510754	Her name is Nicole Hunter.
4511895	4514456	Nicole Hunter She described the character as a posh version of Paris Hilton
4537489	4538430	Thanks for watching!
4560151	4564480	Of course, if you want to make the character more posher, you should have gotten Posh Spice, not Joss Stone.
4564500	4565422	I was saying classy.
4566444	4570593	At any rate, if they want to make a real trailer trash, they probably just could have called her Atmore Motel 6.
4572799	4573840	Salacious Pop, thank you.
4573900	4575041	Christmas Jones.
4575201	4576482	She was a nuclear physicist.
4576502	4579585	That was Denise Richards in whatever, like, was it Tomorrow Never Dies?
4579845	4581707	She played a character named Christmas Jones.
4582207	4583849	How ridiculous is that name?
4584329	4585290	Christmas Jones.
4585330	4586091	Nicole Hunter?
4586191	4588013	That's, I don't, like, I don't know.
4588173	4589994	I probably knew a girl in high school named that.
4590034	4591055	Like, that's not that exciting.
4594278	4594338	Uh...
4597133	4600754	Now we got all these random Bond girl type names being yelled out here.
4600854	4603875	Honey Rider, Posher Spice, maybe that could be the name.
4604375	4608057	Toagax says Paris Hilton equals pussy here, pussy there, pussy, pussy everywhere.
4610157	4611398	That's kind of how she got famous.
4611458	4615359	Bond girl names could be exchangeable with porn star names too.
4616914	4617635	Oh yeah, Jinx.
4617755	4619376	Wasn't Hal Berry like Jinx?
4621017	4621418	What was her name?
4621438	4623099	I think it was Jinx because they were going to do a spin-off movie.
4623560	4625721	By the way, you know what my favorite porn star name is?
4625942	4626122	What?
4626502	4627163	Allison Chains.
4627943	4629865	I just thought it was funny.
4630585	4637871	And lastly, before we move on to release dates, Salacious Pop in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com says, How is Paris Hilton like Kansas?
4638612	4641014	Both are flat, white, and easy to enter.
4641895	4641975	Ha!
4645402	4646444	Strawberry Fields.
4646704	4646965	Really?
4647025	4647926	That was a Bond girl?
4647946	4648728	Strawberry Fields?
4653334	4658755	See Strawberry Fields, Pussy Galore, Christmas Jones, Nicole Hunter.
4659876	4661316	It just doesn't work.
4661816	4662616	All right, let's move on.
4662656	4663336	Release dates.
4664037	4666597	Travel around the world and talk about games coming out soon.
4667698	4668698	Hit a store near you.
4668718	4670038	We'll start with the U.S., Loki.
4670878	4673719	You know, her name's sort of broken down.
4673739	4677400	It could sound like Hole Hunter, so I mean that, you know.
4679115	4680378	What about Mike Hunter?
4681079	4681920	Mike Hunter.
4682601	4683363	That would have been better.
4684252	4686012	I did know a guy named Benjamin Dover.
4687453	4687873	Poor guy.
4689953	4691314	So stuff coming out this week.
4691854	4698435	Not a whole lot because July is a pretty slow month, but there's some generic DS games, of course, coming out.
4698915	4700896	Hidden Objects Mystery Stories.
4700996	4702816	It's another Hidden Objects game.
4702996	4704876	Yeah, because there's not a lot of those on the DS.
4706817	4711898	Apparently Trackmania Turbo, but I somehow doubt that's actually coming out because I think it's late to October.
4713999	4735918	uh Samantha Swift and the Hidden Roses of Athena which also I believe was delayed forever uh and I definitely know Trackmania on the Wii man you know GameStop needs update their fucking release list it is terrible um Mumbo Jumbo six pack second edition it's six games from Mumbo Jumbo that you can buy on PC hooray um
4739738	4740739	Wow, is that it?
4742362	4743944	So there's like nothing coming out this week.
4743984	4744905	That can't be right.
4746046	4747088	Maybe it's just a slow week.
4748470	4751914	Well, Hidden Objects Mystery Stories it is.
4754393	4755354	I gotta go back to chat.
4755394	4756754	I know the Bond girl thing's getting old.
4757114	4759435	I'll look at a different list because that's a pathetic list.
4759856	4761696	Derek H is in our chat tonight.
4762297	4765878	He's actually the brains behind the big battle over at Dead Pixel Live, so welcome.
4766438	4770580	He says, Christmas Jones led to the worst end lines of any Bond film.
4771120	4773281	I thought Christmas only came once a year.
4776063	4776743	But I'm bummed.
4778525	4780046	Okay, there is other things this week.
4780126	4781287	I forgot.
4781547	4785389	They had them on Wii release dates, so it didn't really make sense to me.
4786969	4797414	Dark Star 1 Broken Alliance on Xbox 360, which that game actually reminds me, I don't know if anyone remembers this PlayStation 1 game, but Colony Wars, or even like Descent Free Space, so that might be kind of cool on 360.
4798435	4802117	Arkrise Fantasia on the Wii, really awesome role-playing game.
4804038	4804238	And...
4806092	4809653	Cats and Dogs, Revenge of Kitty Galore on DS.
4809993	4812614	And I don't think it's on this list, but I remember it.
4813274	4818175	And why the god hell did they make this game in the first place?
4818876	4823217	The Bachelor, featuring The Bachelorette as well on Wii and DS.
4823537	4825357	Yes, The Bachelor video game.
4826058	4826798	That is correct.
4827478	4828358	And Zany Golf on Wii.
4829378	4829759	Really?
4830059	4832119	Like, what game do you make?
4832479	4834920	Is that the closest thing we're going to get in America to a dating sim?
4837117	4839760	Um, maybe?
4839800	4841782	I want to be the bachelor that rejects them all.
4842022	4843344	Like, didn't that happen on one of them?
4843764	4847208	Like, he or she, I don't remember, one of them just said, you know what?
4847628	4848489	You all suck.
4848610	4849511	I don't want any of you.
4849911	4850532	Fuck you all.
4850572	4851092	I'm out of here.
4852234	4852534	Later.
4853823	4854684	That's how I play the game.
4854824	4855424	Losers.
4856124	4857185	I just want to get laid.
4857905	4858386	Done.
4859807	4860827	I don't need you.
4860847	4862508	I thought Christmas only came once a year.
4864029	4866531	The Xbox 360 in Japan this week.
4867111	4869853	Blur Razors comes out in Japan this week.
4869893	4873675	You know, I'm kind of thinking that is actually Blur over there, and it is.
4874015	4875036	But they call it Blur.
4875496	4877637	It's Blur Racers on this website.
4877697	4878718	It's incorrectly spelled.
4879038	4879418	I know.
4879478	4880239	That's so English.
4880259	4880559	Blur Racers.
4880999	4882280	Blur Racers.
4882860	4885522	Blue Racers with a Z, by the way, that's important.
4885562	4888124	Blur Racers with a Z is out in Japan this week.
4888644	4890325	Stop it.
4890565	4892847	99 Nights 2 comes out in Japan this week.
4893387	4895008	I saw that on the shelf at the gaming store.
4895428	4898510	I thought about buying it for five seconds and I was like, what am I thinking?
4899871	4902192	That's pretty much it on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.
4902252	4905074	So unfortunately, you guys had to wait for some of the games we've had here.
4906134	4914118	But on PlayStation 3, you get Blur Racers as well, or Kentomahu to Gakuno Mono is coming out as well.
4914278	4915699	I don't even know what this is.
4915739	4919901	This is an upgraded version of the cute fantasy school life RPG.
4919941	4923243	So this must be a remake of an old game that's now available.
4923803	4927965	It looks like it involves kind of like the card style battle in the game.
4929126	4929626	Shadow of Summoner
4954003	4965414	You control a light source to solve puzzles and battle monsters This is not a game I'm familiar with over here No, that's, oh god, Lost in Shadow, that's coming out Is it?
4965634	4978705	It's that really cool trippy puzzle platform game I did see that at PAX East, I think they were showing that Okay, okay, so it's that, it's Kage no Tool over there in Japan Yeah, it's coming out over here in September Okay
4979686	4993557	I like how on PlayAsia they have a wonderful combo where I can buy Blur Razors for the PS3 and I can combo with Blur Razors for the PS3.
4993677	4995278	Oh, I'm sorry, that's Blur on the PS3.
4995578	4997139	In case I want both versions of the game.
4997159	4998680	You're going to play American and Japanese.
4998700	4999041	Why not?
4999121	4999981	It's the same game.
5000181	5000682	Why not?
5000722	5001222	Play them both.
5001302	5001963	It's region-free.
5002563	5003723	on the Nintendo DS.
5004343	5008264	Katekyo Hitman Reborn DS Flame Rumble XX.
5008564	5010325	Yes, that is really the game's name.
5010365	5012265	They have some crazy names over there.
5012285	5013986	They like their subtitles.
5014706	5015966	They love their subtitles.
5015986	5016566	They really do.
5016706	5022848	Well, remember how long the one Street Fighter I have is like something, something, something for matching service.
5023368	5027512	Remember, the longer the subtitles, the better the game.
5028212	5034197	TV Anime, Fairy Tale Gekitou, Madushi Kessen comes out as well.
5034237	5036399	Is this like an interactive anime?
5036940	5038041	That sounds like a really good game.
5038181	5041003	It looks like an action game that's just based on an anime.
5041063	5044226	Like the anime plays on the bottom screen and you're kind of controlling the top screen.
5044947	5045727	That looks a little silly.
5046608	5057872	and lastly going to the PSP for Japanese release dates Fate slash Extra is the big release this week on the PSP it's coming out regular and limited editions because the only thing they love more in subtitles are limited editions in Japan
5058718	5063019	Yeah, but my limited edition has a bowl and a plate and a knife and a clock.
5063199	5065700	Well, this is an RPG on the PSP.
5065780	5066940	It actually looks kind of cool.
5066980	5070361	It's kind of got a very Phantasy Star look to it.
5070461	5072021	The newer Phantasy Star games, that is.
5072141	5072841	Yeah.
5072881	5074682	Kind of in its like action-y type attack.
5074702	5077763	I gotta say, this looks kind of neat, actually.
5077983	5078583	Who's this by?
5079783	5080283	Marvelous.
5080423	5085004	So it's not even by Sega, but it kind of looks inspired by the newer Phantasy Star games, at least to me, at first glance.
5085484	5086945	There it is, your Japanese release dates.
5086965	5087365	How about the UK?
5088462	5090342	Well, in the UK, we have some games.
5090983	5099585	We have, um, on the 19th, we have Alien Swarm, and the 20th, Need for Speed World.
5099685	5101025	Those are both PC, by the way.
5101585	5109007	The 23rd is Dragon Quest IX, Sentinels of the Starry Skies, and that's it until, yeah, that's it.
5110106	5110386	All right.
5110866	5116568	Just a couple quick more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week while we transition into Part B tonight.
5116628	5118228	Loki, you got something else for us.
5118468	5128291	If you've signed up for the PlayStation Plus service, you may be a wonderful contestant in checking out Hulu Plus as well.
5128891	5130812	Hey, it's another service with plus in the name.
5131113	5132093	It's gotta be good, right?
5132814	5140339	Which will become available to select subscribers of the Sony's PlayStation Plus program starting now.
5141039	5148985	Apparently, eventually all subscribers may be able to check out the...
5149705	5168517	Hulu Plus service once it finally launches but as of right now you can download the Hulu Plus software and request an invitation to an exclusive preview and if you're chosen then you can preview the wonderful stuff that Hulu Plus will be allowing you to check out
5169489	5193019	Am I hearing you correctly that you're telling me if I pay Sony $50 a year, I might get the opportunity, I could be the lucky, I might get selected, my name might get pulled out of that hat, and I would be given the opportunity with my $50 a year to pay Hulu $10 a year to watch old crap on TV.
5194200	5196001	Am I correct in what I'm hearing?
5196361	5198382	You are correct, and doesn't it sound awesome?
5199482	5200763	Sign me the fuck up!
5201283	5202343	All this and core?
5202603	5203023	Wow!
5210286	5212326	I don't know, I got nothing.
5212827	5214707	It was beyond my ability to comment on, Rob.
5215307	5220889	Wait, can I tune in Hulu Plus stuff on my TV in my Sony home apartment?
5222110	5223230	Probably not.
5224772	5236842	Aw, well, can I possibly, I don't know, put out Core magazines in my Sony apartment on home, like on my coffee table or anything like that?
5237743	5241947	I don't think you can do that, but in the mall they sometimes show clips from Core.
5242487	5243428	Oh wow, clips.
5243789	5249414	I'm going to stay there in the mall forever until I see the whole month of Core, just so I don't have to pay for it.
5249955	5251897	And eventually I'll see all the clips.
5251937	5255441	So that's going to be a worthwhile investment of my time.
5255681	5258263	You know there's the OLR Clubhouse right now, right?
5258303	5259224	We have a clubhouse at home.
5259465	5262288	Dumbest $5 I ever spent, but I had to do it.
5262888	5289197	OLR we love to explore new ways to interact with our audience and all these social things so I spent some of those ways may not be good stupid dollars look look I took the hit for the team okay I spent five dollars on this clubhouse and home right now we're limited to 25 members and believe it or not I don't know how this is possible but we I can't like I still get requests like at least once a week to join the club and I I can't I have to just file them away and trust me you're not missing out on anything yeah
5289537	5290038	Here's the thing.
5290098	5304751	The clubhouse is a room, and I decorated it with the arcade machines that I won in the Namco demo, and I tried to put some stuff in there, but I can't put anything OLR-related in there.
5304892	5307414	I can't put a clip from the show.
5307774	5310537	There's a giant TV that sits at the top of the clubhouse.
5310597	5312239	I can't do anything with it.
5312959	5322945	I can't even put the OLR artwork on the wall.
5324106	5324786	I can do nothing.
5326768	5331951	So what you're saying is you've transformed your OLR clubhouse into your game room.
5332791	5333812	Yes, I did.
5336133	5336234	Oh.
5339079	5344747	and I paid five bucks for that exclusive opportunity to beta test the clubhouses.
5348271	5349553	Feeling a little impotent now.
5351095	5352115	I'm just shocked.
5352796	5356977	I'm hearing the words come out of my mouth, and I want to smack myself on the back of the head and call me an idiot.
5357077	5359477	I paid $5 to beta test the clubhouse.
5359877	5361038	Here's the funny part about it, though.
5361058	5361638	God, I'm an idiot.
5362038	5366879	They're still, like, gung-ho with home and saying, oh, it's such a wonderful platform.
5367319	5368880	Oh, my God, it's so successful.
5369580	5370401	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5393186	5394888	It's just so funny.
5396170	5396991	Okay, okay.
5397672	5401838	We're gonna make this just fucking kick-ass game at home and we're gonna give it away for free, alright?
5401858	5402179	You ready?
5402199	5403080	You ready?
5403240	5408588	You're gonna be in a tank and you go around in this 3D space and you shoot other tanks.
5409529	5410150	Oh my god!
5410870	5411191	Print!
5411791	5412271	Run with it.
5412452	5413132	It's amazing.
5413933	5423220	And you can like post to your... You'll be able to post to your Twitter when you overtake other tanks and you'll win stuff for your house.
5424481	5426002	But not your real house, your fake house.
5427263	5427824	And shirts.
5428064	5430626	Oh, but then you have to pay for additional levels once you get there.
5432648	5437872	And for the record, I never got to the point where I had to buy additional levels because I got bored of the game that quick.
5441300	5449366	And for those that think we're being Xbox fanboys right now and giving Sony an unbelievable amount of hate, look, I'll just say this.
5449466	5452989	Never forget Yaris.
5453409	5455491	So it can happen to anyone, all right?
5458035	5477442	Hey, speaking of the Xbox Actually, maybe this is a good thing to follow it up with You know how they're making this awesome new channel called the Destination Arcade Actually, it's not really It doesn't actually sound that awesome at all Destination Arcade is like this store that you can download to see the store in a whole new way
5480114	5480614	Destination Arcade
5500191	5500832	Well, guess what?
5500892	5509918	Major Nelson came out and said, Okay, so Destination Arcade, you're going to download it this week, and it's going to blow your mind, and then August 18th, we're shutting it off!
5510259	5512400	So it's a limited time only!
5513721	5517624	We fixed all the problems with Xbox Live Arcade, we made things easier to find!
5518625	5520306	For a limited time!
5520346	5522608	And then you're going to have to go back to finding things the old hard way.
5523829	5525090	Why bother?
5527239	5527940	So there you go.
5528060	5529741	I don't even have to defer to yours.
5529841	5531343	This is just as stupid.
5531363	5532604	You know what this is just like?
5532804	5534685	This is just like, hey, guess what, guys?
5535026	5537708	We know that you've been bitching about the D-pad forever.
5538028	5542452	And we're going to release these wonderful limited edition FIFA controllers that are green.
5542472	5544053	They have the D-pad fixed.
5544273	5545334	But it's only for a limited time.
5545354	5547576	We're going back to the crappy broken D-pad.
5548837	5549658	Okay, apparently...
5551479	5552981	I didn't even know this until just now.
5553221	5554081	Here's the best part.
5554342	5555102	Wait for it, guys.
5555342	5555562	Okay.
5556423	5561307	So Major Nelson had an interview with Shaq News, apparently, and said that... I didn't even know this.
5561367	5562488	I'm hearing this for the first time.
5563388	5568152	Said to Shaq News, if you've downloaded it, it will continue to work.
5570033	5572555	But you can only download it until August 18th, apparently.
5575497	5578880	So if you want to be part of this exclusive club, that's like...
5583049	5585130	That's like going to a mall.
5585170	5586910	You could go to Macy's to buy clothes.
5587991	5589371	Or you could go to JCPenney.
5589771	5590191	But you know what?
5590231	5595573	You had to sign up during this month-long promotion to go to JCPenney.
5596513	5601195	And if you didn't sign up during that time, there's going to be a guard at the door who's just going to bounce you.
5601415	5603696	Like, did you download this between July and August?
5603736	5604236	Come on in.
5605076	5605516	Fuck you.
5605536	5606316	Go to Macy's.
5606336	5606957	We don't want your business.
5606977	5607817	It's going to be like this.
5607857	5611038	It's going to be like, okay, if you've downloaded this program...
5611678	5612800	All the clothes will be on the shelf.
5613120	5618568	But if you haven't downloaded this program, you're gonna have to go to the store where all the clothes are in a giant pile in the middle of the store.
5619990	5623034	It'll be like that old Nick game show, Finders Keepers.
5627782	5632845	Just to let everybody know right now, at this point Rob has doubled over and put his head between his knees.
5633206	5639230	I mean, how many news stories have we read tonight that just don't make any fucking sense?
5639690	5642091	Like what is wrong with all of you?
5643072	5644212	Are you all high?
5645533	5648094	Did they give out drugs at E3 this year?
5648634	5650174	Well, why didn't we get to go then?
5650294	5650654	I want drugs.
5650674	5651855	I don't understand.
5651875	5652355	We don't have them.
5652495	5653275	Blazinga?
5653755	5654275	Sony?
5654696	5655556	Microsoft?
5655916	5657216	You're all stupid.
5657696	5658897	What is wrong?
5660817	5663038	Rob is breathless with disbelief.
5663058	5665619	We just figured it out.
5665699	5666539	Our eyes are open.
5666559	5667579	I just simply cannot.
5668240	5668640	I cannot.
5669720	5670461	Rob's gonna cry.
5670762	5675267	That's the perfect thing to do when you've solved problems in making things easier to find.
5676008	5676708	You cancel it.
5676789	5677870	That's perfect.
5678991	5679932	That makes sense to me.
5682695	5684458	Not much makes sense anymore in this world.
5686078	5691221	So enjoy this very special store that you can only download for a limited time.
5691721	5695643	And Salacious Pop's asking, so is it like a skin or what?
5695743	5696764	You know, I don't know.
5697244	5699805	I'm just told it's like this super special new way.
5699845	5700566	It's fairy dust, okay?
5700606	5701586	It's fairy dust.
5707129	5707730	I got nothing.
5709170	5711752	We're gonna offer this free game for a limited time.
5712052	5717055	It's featuring a car from Toyota called the Yaris.
5717776	5719057	It's gonna blow your mind.
5720137	5721879	Alright, you guys.
5722279	5724440	We're gonna put out this vision camera.
5724460	5726462	That was so bad it made me burp.
5726722	5732286	We're gonna put out this camera, and it's gonna allow you to play these awesome fucking games like Totem Ball!
5733066	5736128	Yeah, it's like pinball, but you use your hands.
5737629	5739551	Use your hands, you flail.
5740032	5742314	You make the pinball thingy go.
5744116	5749922	By the way, this is the same company that's putting out a camera this year that you're going to use your hands to...
5751725	5754028	Rob, it's too painful.
5754188	5758814	What if it's too late for me to sell back my vision camera for, say, some store credit?
5760756	5769086	Slaces pop and our chatroom says, Major Nelson announces new store, announces that Seattle has the best weed and that this dude at Rare takes the biggest bong hits he's ever seen.
5772631	5772971	You know what?
5773091	5774651	I think we need to take a... What?
5775592	5776192	Yes, Loki.
5776352	5776652	Final.
5776812	5777752	I have a great idea.
5778052	5778292	Yes.
5778932	5781793	We want to show off the Kinect to get people excited about it.
5782453	5785734	What store can we back Kinect with?
5787294	5788414	God.
5788434	5789034	Macy's.
5790974	5797896	Where do all the people that play Kinect gather on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays between noon and 8 p.m. ?
5799451	5800332	Where are they all at?
5800452	5801152	Where would I go?
5801593	5802474	Would I go to the mini golf?
5802534	5803655	No, fuck the mini golf place.
5803975	5806017	Would I go to the movies?
5806517	5806777	No, no.
5806857	5807798	Kinect players don't go to the movies.
5807918	5808198	I know.
5808479	5812002	We'll go to Macy's, who doesn't even have an electronics department.
5814624	5815645	What the fuck?
5818247	5819208	You're all high.
5825746	5828087	So let's take a look at the way they did it in the past.
5828127	5830508	Let's see how you used to get high in the 80s, huh?
5830648	5834949	With the trip down memory lane and the classic game of the week.
5835029	5835489	That's right.
5835729	5840871	We're going to take a moment to see the drug-induced effects of video games back in the day.
5840911	5845032	And boy, did Jamie pick a good one tonight for this topic, didn't you, Jamie?
5845673	5847913	I sure did.
5848053	5851034	I just want to point out, she picks these well before the show starts.
5851114	5852615	It's just too good tonight.
5860089	5863470	and I really put this in honor of Classic Gaming Expo because it's there every year.
5863490	5866211	You mean the whatever the fuck I went to.
5866231	5866931	California Extreme.
5867591	5868591	Whatever that thing was.
5868811	5869832	Yeah, California Extreme.
5869892	5871712	The event that let you in free with a media pass?
5871732	5872152	Yeah.
5872472	5873713	I know, they were great.
5874673	5878274	I'm covering it media-like and stuff.
5878954	5883635	By the way, she just took another bike and in folks, so you're in for a real treat in part B. My old one was wearing off.
5883675	5884956	I was in pain.
5886156	5889157	Anyway, so yeah, Journey.
5890835	5903602	Valley Midway put it out in the 80s, and it was after Frontiers, which was their 1983 album by Journey, got them really popular.
5904262	5904482	So...
5906630	5908852	It was supposed to go along with the U.S.
5909053	5920124	band tour, and then it was actually brought in Incredible Technologies, which is the second team of developers, to bring it out for Christmas around that time.
5920905	5928934	And so it features who the band members were at the time, which were Steve Perry, Neil Sean, Steve Smith, Jonathan Cain, and Ross Valerie.
5930416	5937426	They have sort of cartoon bodies, but their faces are really like these digital black and white photographs from while they were on tour.
5941465	5948488	And it was supposed to use this photo technology for another game, but it failed in location testing.
5948508	5957851	So anyway, you have to go through the game to find the different musical instruments or a microphone.
5958552	5964894	So you play each of the members of the band in these different levels to get their missing musical implement.
5966455	5967275	And now, turn this up.
5974639	5975399	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6006040	6008124	There was another game that Journey was in.
6008164	6009967	It was called Journey Escape for the Atari 2600.
6011974	6019056	This was listed as number 9 on the top 10 worst licensed game ideas ever for Game Informer 2007.
6019136	6024337	Well, Game Informer doesn't know dick, apparently, because Journey is awesome.
6025077	6026997	I want to see what this Journey Escape thing is.
6027517	6028738	Yeah, Journey Escape.
6029378	6030198	Here's from Emmanuel.
6030678	6034559	You're on a boat with Journey, one of the world's hottest rock groups.
6035679	6037841	A spectacular performance has just ended.
6038301	6050231	Now it's up to you to guide each Journey band member past hordes of love-crazy groupies, sneaky photographers, and shifty-eyed promoters to the safety of the Journey escape vehicle in time to make it to the next concert.
6050691	6055015	Your mighty manager and loyal roadies are there to help, but the escape is up to you.
6057236	6058137	Sounds like a 10 to me.
6058457	6061980	You have to make it to the Scarab escape vehicle, the same one that's on the cover.
6063821	6064342	I know, right?
6065598	6070501	It was very different from the arcade game, so if you only played the 2600... The song Escape, though, ironically, is not in the game.
6071441	6073042	But the intro is Don't Stop Believin'.
6074443	6074763	There you go.
6075203	6075543	Alright.
6076224	6078124	There it is, your classic game of the week.
6078325	6081146	Oh, and by the way, the manager is the Kool-Aid Man.
6083107	6083407	What?
6084348	6085208	Of the 2600 version?
6085248	6088830	The manager is inexplicably depicted as the Kool-Aid Man.
6088850	6090331	Hey, Kool-Aid Man!
6091191	6092112	Oh yeah!
6092512	6093052	Oh no!
6095086	6096707	Naughty, naughty, cool aid.
6120235	6147866	1vs100 got canned this week so you know we gotta talk about that cause it's kinda sad and yeah man there's a lot of stories here tonight that are just like bad ideas this is not good news week everybody I'm sorry but hopefully there'll be some good gems tonight go ahead to be fair we're actually not talking about the Macy's tour so much it's actually a lot other places oh there's the road show too we'll mention them both I'm sure
6148346	6167459	and there is some good news though we're going to talk about as well Mega Man Universe we'll talk about a little bit when we come back and we'll talk as well about a very very classic Atari 2600 game getting updated for the new millennium that should be kind of interesting so we'll talk about all that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio don't go anywhere we'll be right back
6173643	6181028	Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this July the 18th, 2010 where we are taping live at All Games Radio.
6181348	6187032	We're moving into part B of our show and I gotta tell you, if you're just tuning in, we've had a pretty funny show so far.
6187452	6191194	Lots of fun chatter in part A, just a lot of weird news.
6191254	6195137	It's been a very weird week in gaming and a lot of strange ideas going on out there.
6195957	6212661	and the fun is going to continue here in part B if you are just joining us come to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and have your say because you know the big part of our show what makes our show unique is you and your chats and your tweets that we're going to get to in a minute and all that good stuff
6213121	6230089	and I also want to call this out your awesome iTunes reviews when you say like nice things about us on the internet that make us feel warm and fuzzy I want to read one here in a minute but I got to pull it up so in the meantime let's get to some rapid fire news and things that happened throughout the week that you know we can mention in a few seconds
6231870	6241137	The Expendables, a pretty awesome movie coming out this summer with a bunch of old action stars, is going to be getting its own Facebook game.
6242598	6244820	It's very similar to Contra.
6245440	6246601	Everybody loves Contra.
6246801	6253607	It's a little similar, I guess, because you can kill a bunch of people on a 2D platformer.
6254207	6256308	Sonic Colors Sonic the Hedgehog Hat
6276579	6277080	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6304180	6312166	And there is a new Oddworld game in the works being developed by the company Just Add Water.
6312986	6316388	And they did a game called Gravity Crash.
6316929	6326095	And apparently it's got the... There are multiple projects across multiple platforms starring all your favorite Oddworld characters.
6327195	6331698	And they haven't said exactly when they're actually coming out, but...
6332859	6337541	You should just at least take solace that they are in the works.
6338341	6341122	At some point soon, we'll see some Oddworld games come back.
6342743	6344823	Alright, I got some quick stories for you guys.
6344863	6346404	One of them is about Kid Icarus.
6346744	6347284	Kid Icarus?
6347344	6347745	Kid Icarus?
6347945	6348505	I like Kid Icarus.
6349505	6352666	This is some other news coming out about Kid Icarus Uprising.
6352726	6359609	Of course, that's the 3DS game that finally brings back Kid Icarus after not being around ever since that Game Boy game.
6360509	6371377	Apparently, in a chat with Games Master, this is a magazine in the UK, Mashihiro Sakurai, who is the game designer at Super Smash Bros.
6371397	6375460	Brawl, says that the online capabilities are currently being tested.
6381764	6384665	There could be some versus play, but we can't go into any detail.
6384925	6389666	There are a lot of capabilities that expand on what was in the DS that people are taking advantage of.
6390086	6390486	Hmm.
6390746	6397528	So it sounds like the online and versus and all that's being toyed with, but we don't know anything for sure just yet.
6397548	6402089	But it's kind of cool because I don't know about you guys, but I just assumed it was like a one player only thing.
6403329	6403469	Yeah.
6404570	6411760	Also, apparently some Capcom games are going to be making their way to the Wii Virtual Console Arcade.
6412941	6418669	Sometimes you forget that the Virtual Console has an arcade, but they're going to be getting some Capcom games in an announcement this week.
6418990	6421273	Among some other Capcom announcements, we'll get into it a little bit.
6421733	6422794	So that's going to be kind of cool.
6422814	6423835	Some old school Capcom games.
6424415	6437584	A place where Capcom games would be welcomed would be Game Room, who saw the release of Fishing Derby, Barnstorming, and Quad Run all on the Atari 2600 this week, as well as the Gyruss for the arcade and Hover Force for the Intellivision.
6437984	6442967	Unfortunately, as awesome as it is to have Gyruss in Game Room, it was already on the Xbox Live Arcade.
6443328	6448271	So it's probably the most awesome game that hit this week, but it already had a version released.
6448811	6451213	So unfortunately, Game Room didn't have a lot of win there.
6451593	6455596	However, I will say one place where Game Room wins, and I mentioned this in Part A, but I wanted to say this as well.
6455696	6460900	It did have a little upgrade this week that, you know, they patched into the game some new little features.
6461241	6470528	Like now, like if you've been playing a game for a long time, the other avatars will come up behind you and start watching you and like applaud you when you finally, you know, I guess lose.
6470908	6473290	Although, I don't know why they applaud you when you lose, but I think it's like...
6473690	6475011	Thank you for watching!
6496424	6498846	I'm really happy to see that they are doing updates.
6498886	6500386	It makes me very hopeful for the future.
6500827	6504349	Now they just need some more licenses like the we got with Capcom this week.
6504369	6505029	That would be great.
6505689	6506290	So we'll see.
6506510	6506970	DarkSakura.
6507971	6512333	Well, something great coming out for iPhone will be Star Wars Battle for Hoth.
6514374	6517456	Especially good for fans of the Empire Strikes Back, right?
6517796	6523800	Which people will arguably say is the best Star Trek movie, although I am personally a fan of Return of the Jedi.
6523940	6524360	It's just me.
6524932	6527435	I think A New Hope was the best one.
6527655	6528196	Yeah!
6528676	6529157	I know, I'm weird.
6532881	6533962	Shut up.
6534162	6539908	Anyway, it's going to be out for $2.99 and it's meant to celebrate the 30 year anniversary of The Empire Strikes Back.
6540068	6540609	Pretty cool, huh?
6541210	6541550	Very cool.
6542817	6545839	For Rock Band News, we have The Stooges and Bad Religion.
6546279	6556445	The Stooges Pack 01, which total will be 440 Microsoft points, or $5.49, includes 1969, I Wanna Be Your Dog, and No Fun.
6557005	6561407	Each of those, well actually, 1969 and No Fun will be 200 Wii points apiece.
6562488	6568171	Although, I was wondering why it's only saying that one of them has a Microsoft points list.
6568471	6569072	Forget I said that.
6569492	6570172	They're about 99 apiece.
6572113	6593086	individual songs coming out are both by Bad Religion, New Dark Ages, and No Control each 160 Microsoft points or 200 Wii points and they will of course some of them being the Stooges Pack and No Control by Bad Religion will be in Lego Rock Band Store I love Bad Religion, great band
6594461	6595482	Alright, we're gonna get into this.
6596262	6596703	Oh, I'm sorry.
6596723	6597383	I thought you were done.
6597423	6597723	My bad.
6597763	6598344	I have three.
6599024	6599545	Ah, my bad.
6601526	6602987	Rob is ignoring me.
6603447	6604969	I am being marginalized.
6605009	6606570	I am multitasking.
6606850	6608431	And I thought I heard three things.
6608611	6610252	I'm being marginalized.
6610352	6611453	Because I'm a woman.
6612994	6613815	Yes, because you're a woman.
6614978	6615418	I know.
6615839	6616099	Anyway.
6618061	6625187	Now there is this really cool dude who has an even cooler, I would have to say, I guess they're married by now, I don't know.
6626348	6637757	But his name is Ray Arifanto, who works for Xbox platform team, is getting married or has gotten married, and his wedding ring is fantastic.
6640079	6643142	It is a USB platinum wedding ring.
6645015	6651502	and on it it says, For a Lifetime of Memories.
6653704	6654965	Isn't that pun-tastic?
6656111	6659192	Is it actually like you could plug it in a USB slot with the ring?
6659572	6660332	No, I don't need it.
6660532	6677056	Actually, I read, though, Rob, I did read about another one, and I tried to find the pictures of it, and I couldn't, about a couple that did have a USB wedding ring, a real USB wedding ring, and on it were photos of their courtship.
6678496	6685519	Wow, that's kind of what I thought of when you first talked about a USB writing ring, like somebody's going to plug one in.
6685880	6689481	This one's just sort of cut into a USB-looking pattern.
6690282	6704929	But no, I did actually find one about a couple that actually did have their rings each were photos of their lives together built into the ring.
6705189	6705749	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
6730646	6732450	I'm actually planning on making one for myself.
6741843	6748269	Well, see, that's actually a plan that I have, is getting one of those little kind of rubber with USB clasp, as it were.
6749450	6760219	Because, I mean, I had to repeat for the staff a couple of times that I'm allergic to penicillin and amoxicillin and the sillins of the family, the molds, you know.
6760439	6764823	And I was just thinking, what if I had fallen unconscious and had a bad infection?
6764843	6766685	They tried to give me penicillin, you know.
6767826	6769767	So I think that those are fantastic ideas.
6769787	6772689	I'm actually looking into the cost of just making it myself.
6774350	6780013	Either with a micro USB or doing a micro SD to have it embedded in there.
6782615	6783836	Bones is 6, 006.
6784857	6785417	Bones is 6.
6785637	6787819	There's two Zs, which makes it very strange to pronounce.
6787899	6791001	Bones is 6 in our chat room says a USB dildo.
6792442	6795804	You know, you could charge it kind of like you do an iPhone.
6797106	6799127	It's not outside the realm of possibility.
6799167	6800669	I'm sure it's sadly been done.
6800689	6807895	They have USB AA batteries that can charge in the... Salacious Pop says RFID would seem more intuitive.
6807915	6808996	That's what they use for pets.
6809456	6810337	I didn't even think about that.
6810397	6813360	Of course, if a pet gets lost, that's all you'd need.
6813840	6814220	Crazy.
6815321	6817702	All right, we're going to get into Twitter topics here real quick.
6817722	6819222	But first, I mentioned I was going to read this.
6819623	6825204	We are so appreciative when people leave us nice reviews on iTunes on our listing there because it helps us spread the word about our show.
6825585	6829166	This one was especially nice, so I wanted to read this real quick because it's awesome.
6829746	6832947	It's from HungryMrDrunk is the name of the user.
6834107	6835388	I know when I get drunk, I get hungry.
6836308	6838489	I have been a hardcore listener, LOL, for years.
6838669	6840391	Not to mention we are the official podcast of the universe.
6858030	6858730	Actually, it's funny.
6859031	6862592	He actually says in the title, why OLR is the best podcast in the galaxy.
6862953	6866754	Although technically it's official video game podcast of the galaxy.
6867195	6868936	But I like being called best too.
6869396	6869916	It is nice.
6870016	6870596	It's very nice.
6870636	6872677	That was a very sweet thank you person.
6873378	6874658	Thank you, Hungry Mr. Drunk.
6875359	6877820	Hungry Mr. Drunk, you should come over and have a beer with me.
6877900	6878420	Yes, that's right.
6878440	6881382	I hope your next week brings you lots of Guinness and Cheetos.
6881722	6882042	All right.
6882963	6884323	Let's get into Twitter topics.
6884864	6886224	Shall we move into Twitter topics?
6886264	6886664	We shall.
6886945	6887325	I guess.
6888260	6888821	You gas?
6889361	6889962	I gas.
6891084	6891704	Get a fan.
6891724	6893587	I'm a god, Rob.
6893707	6894247	I'm a god.
6896630	6897812	When did you last take a bike?
6899013	6899834	An hour ago?
6900555	6901336	So during the show?
6901897	6903399	Yes, it is during the show.
6903419	6904019	During the show.
6905261	6905661	Let's see.
6905802	6907524	Whatever.
6908991	6910393	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6926449	6929291	And so it's hitting me harder than it really used to.
6929311	6931453	It is.
6932273	6933814	Can I get to the Twitter topic?
6933854	6934294	Kitty!
6935075	6935355	Sorry.
6935996	6938337	SSJ100Matt sent me this link.
6938998	6940619	It has nothing to do with anything.
6941339	6946062	This is why I really don't like to click on YouTubes during the show, but SSJ100Matt's kind of funny.
6946483	6948364	And he sent this link and it's adorable.
6948404	6950225	He says, this new game's coming to the Wii.
6950846	6955849	And so this box comes up with nine little holes in it.
6957450	6961112	and then little kitties come out of the holes and get boxed.
6963553	6964894	Oh my god, send that to me, Rob.
6964974	6965774	It's so adorable.
6965814	6966434	It's in our chat.
6966474	6967895	Are you in chat?
6968035	6969836	I'm in chat.
6969856	6970797	Matt just posted this.
6970877	6971557	It's adorable.
6972117	6973978	This makes for terrible radio.
6974258	6975579	This is awful, terrible, horrible radio.
6975599	6976900	I'll put it on Facebook.
6977620	6978501	Let's put it on Facebook.
6979841	6981162	Can I get to Twitter topics already?
6982563	6982763	Alright.
6984379	7002749	Twitter.com slash OLR Follow us, ask us questions, we answer Dr. Tsuyu wants us to plug RetroReview Oh no, he says he's planning one I don't think I saw it posted yet But Dr. Tsuyu does a lot of great work for the site, so thanks very much Let's see, Sterlok wants to give a shameless plug Is this turning into the shameless plug segment?
7002789	7011214	I think it is Actually, I really like this article though, so I am going to let him have his shameless plug He wrote an article for geek-life.com That's us, geek-life.com
7011434	7012315	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7026972	7027852	Thanks for watching!
7047702	7049404	StarCraft II cost $100 million to make.
7049424	7049784	Wow.
7049804	7051906	That apparently is according to the Wall Street Journal.
7051926	7054128	Activision Blizzard spent $100 million on the three-part sequel.
7054148	7056670	Where did all that money go?
7056730	7057050	Oh my god.
7074508	7087494	I guess this game's gonna be epic beyond epic purely development and that has nothing to do with marketing exceeds Gran Turismo 5's 60 million development cost they'll make it all back that's the sick part
7088235	7093338	Uh, let's see, also from TigerClaw, Killer gets two life sentences in an Xbox-motivated murder.
7094698	7106725	I hate stories like these, because usually they have nothing, I mean, no offense to TigerClaw, because he's pulling it from a game blog, but I just, I hate that this stuff gets tied to gaming at all, because it's just that this guy's just sick.
7107365	7110707	Some sicko killed people, and it somehow involved an Xbox.
7112679	7119422	His name is Kyle Sebastian Scott, 19 years old, and he killed a 22-year-old in January of last year.
7119462	7123024	He hid his body in a ravine near a hiking trail in Colorado Springs.
7126806	7130467	Apparently, he wanted the guy's Xbox and killed the guy.
7130567	7131808	Oh, this is even better.
7132188	7135770	Jason Hawley, the victim, 22 years old, developmentally disabled.
7138363	7141464	And the judge said he trusted you, he would have given you anything, and he did.
7141844	7144685	You could have taken the Xbox and he would have never told anybody.
7145125	7147626	He was trying to be normal, a buddy, or one of the guys.
7147726	7148627	Two life sentences.
7148967	7149487	Not enough.
7150648	7151148	Not enough.
7155222	7156643	Spazinator is sending us an update.
7156823	7159125	Remember he called in last week to talk about his Sony woes?
7159746	7160466	Update, update.
7161247	7166612	Sony Computer Entertainment of America finally gave back my remaining 55 videos this past Monday.
7166672	7167372	Woo, that's a lot.
7167773	7169854	Still rather pissed that it took so damn long.
7170195	7174258	They actually called me as they were doing it so I could confirm if they had everything.
7174658	7176180	Well, that's kind of nice, I guess.
7176320	7177020	At least they did that.
7178522	7199618	Jay Jugo on Twitter is listening to some old episodes of OLR I guess this is a never forget kind of moment Hey guys, here's a funny flashback Procrastination is like masturbation It feels good until you realize you fucked yourself Irene said that quote on your 6th episode Just wanted to share that flashback moment with you guys Keep up the great work Nice
7201107	7202048	OldSchoolOLR.
7202088	7202989	They do exist out there.
7203009	7204270	They're out there if you know where to look.
7204410	7206712	The pictures are now finally on the website.
7206812	7213859	Apparently, my initial email bounced because apparently there's too many pictures attached.
7214279	7215801	So now I'm sending them two at a time.
7216181	7222687	So remember, folks, if you're going to upload pictures to the website, do so in small quantities because the email may not be able to handle it.
7223047	7224389	But now you can see pictures of Baby Room.
7224409	7226492	And they're right there in the header of orangehoundstudio.com, right?
7226512	7227513	Yes, they are up at the top.
7227594	7230638	In fact, I'm just waiting for the last two to refresh on here.
7230918	7231339	Take a look.
7231860	7232581	And they're awesome.
7232701	7237628	And actually, if you look at the gallery, you can see my progress of last week, which was not much progress.
7240607	7246213	DarkTetsuya says, anyone be interested in an OLR game in the same style of the Journey coin-op?
7246293	7248155	I've been wanting to do that for quite some time.
7248676	7251419	That would be awesome if you could actually do it.
7251579	7253881	That is no small programming feat.
7253901	7255203	That would be cool.
7256840	7258001	Yes, of course, I'd love that.
7258041	7259442	The Journey arcade game is rad.
7259802	7261163	It's classic game of the week now.
7261403	7262103	It's official.
7263284	7264444	Lastly, Redertainment.
7264544	7267546	What nerd thing makes you think of an old TV show?
7268127	7271529	Mine is the red green show after the duct tape iPhone 4 fix.
7273615	7274696	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7294286	7294686	I don't know.
7294786	7295127	I don't know.
7295147	7295467	Forget it.
7298129	7299550	Mr. Wizard never really dies.
7299990	7303152	You see, he's figured out a way to become one with the Force.
7304113	7305834	He's just going to disappear into a robe.
7306074	7311277	Well, I just thought about Finders Keepers, thinking about the Xbox store earlier, so I guess it does happen once in a while.
7311297	7312078	I think of old TV shows.
7312278	7312438	I know.
7312458	7314480	Is there something nerdy that makes you think of an old TV show?
7315780	7319143	The status of the gaming industry and the show Bonkers.
7321724	7324106	I think that's pretty close there.
7326245	7328586	A co-worker said this to me the other day, and I like this.
7328606	7337949	This really has nothing to do with gaming or nerd, but she said, you know, sometimes my life here feels like the dinosaurs TV show and that little baby.
7338369	7339069	Not the mama.
7339309	7340009	Not the mama.
7340029	7341630	I don't know.
7341670	7342270	It's funny to me.
7342570	7343530	That is pretty funny, Rob.
7344931	7347131	Anything you want to add, DarkSakura?
7348172	7349172	Well, I don't know.
7349312	7352693	Usually I think about my job, and all I can think about is...
7354819	7355460	What was that?
7358944	7359424	Running Man.
7361046	7361547	Blade Runner?
7362107	7363469	No, Running Man.
7363509	7368134	The one where he's trapped in a game show and to get out he has to escape.
7371658	7373540	Richard Dawson was the villain.
7373720	7374641	That was awesome.
7376465	7390056	The best part about that movie Alright Let's move on with some more news Back to gaming news That's almost as cool as Mega Race With Don Knotts or something Don Knotts was not in that, was he?
7391537	7396001	There was somebody who was like Don Knotts in that game In that game
7396918	7397619	It was weird.
7398039	7399660	No, Don Knotts was not in The Running Man.
7400341	7401562	That would have been even more epic.
7402122	7405765	Don Knotts should have been one of the killers in The Running Man.
7406165	7407226	That would have been cool.
7408627	7411810	Tiger Claw, by the way, says Mr. Wizard died in 2007.
7411910	7412490	Don Herbert.
7412730	7413211	Just so you know.
7413911	7415092	In case you weren't aware, Mr. Wizard is dead.
7415132	7416153	And he hated kids.
7416573	7418034	He did not hate kids.
7418555	7419195	Yes, he did.
7419936	7423478	He loved kids as much as Mel Gibson loved his wife and girlfriend.
7423498	7424880	Alright, back to news stories.
7425980	7429564	Mega Man Universe is a game that's coming out on the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade.
7445899	7451103	They had a little teaser trailer that came out this week that featured absolutely no gameplay whatsoever.
7451523	7454385	But it kind of gave us an idea of what we may expect.
7454785	7465572	Apparently, the game will actually, I guess, combine universes in the Capcom, or different Capcom game universes.
7466433	7474579	The teaser trailer showed, at one point, stop motion animation of Ryu, Arthur, from the Ghosts and... Ryu.
7475459	7476762	Ryu, Ryu, whatever.
7477083	7478385	I'm saying it the western way, okay?
7479087	7480249	The improper way.
7480710	7481632	You're wrong!
7483010	7489894	Fine, Ryu, and Arthur from the Ghosts and Ghouls and Ghosts and Goblins series.
7490374	7491274	And, of course, Mega Man.
7492755	7496137	You know, facing off against a bunch of Mega Man villains.
7496517	7506042	So, either I'm guessing that Mega Man's going to get powers from these other players or the other game heroes...
7506942	7530797	or he's going to be teaming up I guess with kind of think of like the Super Mario crossover but you know the Super Capcom crossover with all these different characters from different series facing off against Mega Man characters or perhaps you know facing off against Capcom Universe characters although then you would wonder why it's called Mega Man Universe and not Capcom Universe.
7531497	7532398	Toy Story Mega Man
7563294	7567818	Oh, it's 20XX.
7569479	7581910	Man, there's something else I forgot at the very end that's kind of cool.
7581990	7582510	Cutman.
7582570	7586534	I'll turn this down a little bit so I can talk for a bit.
7589281	7590102	Well, it looks cool.
7590142	7593944	Too bad this is all like a pre-rendered thing that the actual game is not going to look like.
7594004	7595365	It looks like stop motion animation.
7597666	7598186	Sweet.
7600808	7601068	What?
7609453	7610914	That little kid's probably on drugs.
7614025	7616226	This is going to be, you know what this looks like to me?
7616786	7618887	Can I tell you what this honestly, like I think right now?
7619227	7622208	No, it looks like the Mega Man fighting game.
7622888	7627289	But it's going to be like Capcom's own version of Capcom versus Capcom.
7628790	7629670	If that makes any sense.
7629790	7632151	That's the first impression I get of what this is.
7633111	7633691	Wait a minute.
7649156	7649616	Okay.
7652557	7653537	So he's still in bed.
7653597	7654557	Mega Man Universe.
7656358	7656978	Your world.
7657398	7658178	Megafied.
7658899	7659439	That's great.
7671832	7674095	That was the old Mega Man box art guy.
7674155	7674415	Yeah.
7674555	7676477	They're gonna have the Mega Man box art Mega Man.
7677859	7678600	I don't get it.
7678840	7679581	Suck, man.
7681163	7681843	I don't get it.
7682124	7683946	I felt like that was a waste of two minutes of show.
7687728	7689029	Welcome to any two minutes of this show.
7717674	7723177	What they need to do is they need to do a Mega Man game that's very similar to the upcoming Castlevania game.
7723958	7729621	You know, with like 16 players at the same time fighting Mega Man characters.
7729901	7735824	Alpha Canandagram says, Sky, imagine possibly Mega Man mixed with LittleBigPlanet with Mega Man powered up level editor.
7735844	7738546	Well, that sounds awesome, but I don't think that's what this is.
7738926	7740787	If it is, though, hey, it might be fun.
7741167	7742128	Actually, it might be a lot of fun.
7742468	7744009	Is this only supposed to be download, though?
7744029	7745430	Like it's a live arcade in PlayStation 3?
7745470	7746510	Live arcade in PlayStation Network.
7746530	7746731	Yeah.
7747864	7752766	All right, let's move on with some more stories, and this is something about something the Xbox is losing.
7753166	7754867	Microsoft canceled 1 vs. 100.
7755367	7757788	That's right, there's not going to be a third season of 1 vs. 100.
7758628	7771573	This is confirmed with Microsoft Game Studios General Manager Dave McCarthy, saying, quote, we're very proud of the 1 vs. 100 team and their accomplishments and are excited to apply what we've learned to future programming.
7772253	7774254	And, yep, it's on the Xbox.com website.
7774514	7775535	A fond farewell.
7776056	7776497	That's it.
7776697	7777338	Aw, that sucks.
7777358	7781863	They're gonna have Mega Man foam Mega Busters or whatever at Comic Con.
7781883	7785007	They're giving away... Do you not even care that 1 vs. 100 is gone?
7785027	7785908	No, I don't care.
7785929	7787470	All you can think about is Mega Man?
7788412	7788512	Ugh.
7791148	7795812	Never forget, there was something funny, Xbox Live Primetime, whatever the fuck happened to that.
7795872	7797073	Well, that's my point.
7798194	7799455	That stuff sounded so exciting.
7799575	7804580	We're going to have this service that's going to blow away all the competition, and we're going to cancel it.
7804700	7810005	It's going to make your Xbox Live Gold account more worthwhile than just paying to play against other people.
7811345	7814066	But it came down to where they couldn't get advertisers.
7814286	7815586	Yeah, that's the buzz I'm hearing too.
7815626	7817666	It was always a Sprint commercial.
7817786	7819967	Once in a while you might see another one, but that was mostly it.
7820407	7823227	So they just couldn't get the advertisers to give away the prizes.
7823307	7823727	But you know what?
7823747	7830128	I think there would be – call me crazy – but I think there would be a lot of people that would still play the game, not even for prizes.
7830529	7838310	I mean when you went into the non-live rounds, which didn't give away anything but points really and supposedly more of a chance to play in the live rounds –
7838690	7842433	There would still be like 10-20,000 people on at any time.
7842633	7845295	I mean, you can't tell me that stuff is that expensive to run.
7845535	7845795	Really?
7846876	7848717	I mean, I guess they have a question writing staff or whatever.
7848737	7849978	And why can't you get advertisers?
7850018	7851879	I see advertisers for stuff all the time.
7852220	7854401	Like, there's different movies that they're promoting on there.
7854441	7855862	There's different, like, stuff.
7856523	7857844	Where's Axe Body Spray?
7857884	7858964	I mean, fuck, there's that shit all the time.
7858984	7859605	Just do a crossover.
7859665	7861026	Get the Old Spice guy in there.
7862287	7864868	Old Spice is very up on the new technology stuff.
7864889	7865489	Get him in there.
7866656	7868638	That last marketing campaign was brilliant.
7868838	7869198	Brilliant.
7869699	7870059	I love it.
7870079	7870740	Who doesn't love that guy?
7870760	7872241	My favorite thing, I'm on a horse.
7873382	7874463	Did you see all the YouTube videos?
7874483	7875264	I didn't see the new ones yet.
7875304	7876445	Oh, you got to see the marriage proposal.
7876465	7877086	That's the best one.
7878467	7884133	Monty Boggs in our chat room says, Microsoft always promises cool stuff to live and then never does it when they realize it requires work.
7886935	7887276	You know...
7889494	7906786	it's just disappointing because they didn't really announce what is next I think that would soften the blow a little bit if they were like well sadly we're losing 1 vs 100 because of licensing they're going to make it a real show again which by the way is also a rumor that 1 vs 100 is actually coming back to TV because of the success of Xbox weird right?
7908706	7909266	I know, right?
7909366	7910407	I don't think it'll be the same thing.
7910427	7912068	It's not going to be Bob Saget and NBC.
7912389	7913629	I'm thinking like Game Show Network.
7913970	7916792	I actually, I read blogs about game shows.
7916812	7917252	Leave me alone.
7917592	7920094	Hey, Rob, that's one of the reasons we love you.
7920494	7920714	I know.
7922575	7923236	I just, I don't know.
7923757	7935047	But if they'd come out and said, okay, we're canceling 100 vs. 100, but we are bringing you, I don't know, The Price is Right, or Family Feud, or hell, Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy, anything.
7935488	7936889	I can play The Price is Right.
7937029	7938551	People would be excited about that.
7938871	7940773	And I don't even think you have to give away prizes.
7941393	7944056	Give away EP and people will still line up.
7944716	7945757	Give away achievements.
7945837	7948120	Give away shoutouts on websites, leaderboards.
7948760	7950361	People will play for EP.
7951442	7952483	Here's the opportunity now.
7952823	7957866	Make something very similar to, say, PlayStation Home, and you can have the prizes in your living room.
7957886	7959407	You're like, hey, look at this virtual.
7959487	7960108	Oh, my God.
7960148	7961829	Why aren't you working for Microsoft?
7961849	7962469	That's brilliant.
7964430	7964931	Brilliant.
7965131	7970454	Win avatar items and themes and cool stuff.
7971335	7971975	You could do it.
7972416	7975878	You don't have to give away a free game or car points.
7976317	7978497	I want a free game and points and a car.
7979018	7980758	Well, I mean, you know, that's nice.
7980818	7985679	Maybe give that away to like the season long winner and it won't cost as much out of the prize budget.
7987179	7988380	AJ Mix in our chat room.
7988420	7989840	Double dare featuring Natal.
7990080	7991720	Why aren't you people working for Microsoft?
7991740	7992681	These are brilliant ideas.
7992881	7993241	Brilliant.
7994941	7995421	Won't happen.
7996881	7997202	I don't know.
7997262	7997742	Here's a thought.
7997782	7999242	Make up your own game show.
8002439	8005382	Get some... Somebody out there has got to be creating these game shows.
8006403	8007024	Hire him!
8007704	8008945	Make your own damn game show.
8008965	8011027	Make a new Xbox Live game show.
8011087	8012188	Yeah, I'd love that idea.
8012309	8012969	And you know what?
8013009	8017934	You can maybe even broadcast some stuff on it on MSNBC or something.
8018014	8019676	Or one of the companies that you own.
8020596	8022078	Fucking stream it on the internet.
8022118	8023059	Have like a...
8025265	8026228	I have something, I don't know.
8026429	8027672	I love this, Monty Boggs.
8028234	8029839	Are you smarter than a fifth grader?
8030000	8032307	Or all the little kids in Halo are the fifth graders?
8034079	8037000	You know, there is a fifth grader game on Xbox Live.
8037860	8038840	Are you smarter than a fifth grader?
8039320	8040900	It's on all the systems, I think.
8041661	8043201	But it's not interactive.
8043841	8046082	I was really excited about Xbox Primetime.
8046142	8049222	It's really disappointing that it's just like, well, you know, it didn't work.
8049282	8049562	Bye.
8050002	8055964	So I really hope they come out and say, yes, we've been working on another project and it's still part of Xbox Primetime.
8056284	8061145	But it makes me nervous when they come out at E3 and don't say a damn thing about it.
8062305	8063566	That should have been the sign right there.
8063706	8064947	They didn't say a damn thing about it.
8064967	8072533	It wasn't like, oh, you hope you liked 1 vs. 100 or, you know, but now we're going to bring you Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune or something like that.
8073974	8078357	Well, you know, Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune games were being shown off on the Wii somewhere else.
8078998	8082020	Yep, I know there's Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune games coming up this year.
8083661	8085322	Actually, the Wii's been getting a lot of those game shows.
8085362	8087044	They have the prices right in Press Your Luck.
8087344	8088945	The Wii's the place for game shows right now.
8090286	8091547	It's not live and interactive.
8092125	8093885	Oh my god, think of the possibilities!
8097666	8099607	Rob, don't cry.
8099787	8104328	I'm just... It's just... What the fuck are they smoking?
8104568	8110889	You can buy PlayStation Plus and maybe you'll get to pay somebody else to watch Hulu.
8111929	8113950	What's it gonna... They don't make any sense.
8114050	8115770	When are the good ideas gonna stick?
8117489	8120351	They just couldn't make money off of 1 versus 100.
8121272	8124495	They weren't making enough in advertising to justify it.
8124735	8129739	I bet they could have charged... Well, they're making the money off Xbox Gold.
8130119	8132041	They're making the money off Xbox Gold, subscribers.
8133162	8134263	There's other ways they could do it.
8136798	8139420	I don't believe the subscribers were giving them that much money.
8140541	8141321	It's about selling.
8141421	8143843	I know people who bought an Xbox just to play that game.
8144003	8144864	They've got to be pissed.
8145564	8146905	They make the money back in other ways.
8146965	8147786	It's dumb.
8148546	8149427	Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.
8149607	8152049	Yeah, but that's a dumb reason to buy an Xbox too if you ask me.
8153610	8159533	SalaciousPop in chat says, Rob wants a big brother port for Wii with a throttle that bitch Wii mode mechanic.
8159933	8165416	I would totally play Survivor on Xbox Live if it was like somehow real.
8165976	8166176	What?
8167336	8169117	There's a Survivor game coming out on the Wii.
8169337	8170578	It's gonna be stupid.
8171058	8172659	It's not gonna be online or anything.
8172719	8175080	It's gonna be like the horrible PC games that were out.
8175120	8175980	At least the PC games.
8176241	8178522	I think one of the PC games you could actually play on the internet.
8179922	8181583	Probably is gonna be a port of the PC game.
8182023	8183024	Dumb, dumb, dumb.
8183044	8186065	Well, the last PC game came out a long time ago.
8186465	8188406	Yeah, that'll probably be a port of the PC game.
8188626	8189467	All right, let's move on.
8191508	8192288	That's frightening.
8193309	8195470	Moving on, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
8197431	8199712	Well, there is some stuff.
8201233	8204655	As soon as my system decides to stop being crappy.
8205395	8208837	I was also completely enamored with the Wacka Kitty, so...
8210731	8213196	Thank you, SSJ100Matt, for completely derailing the show.
8213236	8213937	We appreciate you.
8215199	8216081	With your cute kittens.
8217884	8219367	No, because my thing... Okay, there it is.
8219467	8219768	I'm sorry.
8219968	8223515	Well, actually, what was going on was that my window decided to hide itself.
8223973	8224233	Yay.
8225335	8227237	And my brain is broken.
8227277	8227757	Doesn't work.
8227998	8234245	Anyway, how about some news about poor, poor Nintendo?
8234886	8236308	Can we have some sad music, Rob?
8236928	8237990	Some sad music?
8238790	8240032	You didn't request this in advance.
8240052	8240593	I don't have sad music.
8240613	8242194	Well, how about just break out a kazoo?
8242214	8243336	Hold on, hold on.
8248834	8252155	It's because I feel for them.
8252255	8252815	Sad music.
8252855	8253255	You got it.
8253295	8253676	Here we go.
8253736	8255096	Some sad music for Jamie's story.
8261298	8273682	There's an announcement made by the Nintendo UK general manager, name is David Yarnton, that demand for the Wii and the DS has declined.
8278335	8289618	He blamed the falling demand for the Wii and DS on the quote cycle and the recession and saying everybody's in the same boat.
8291298	8293439	We are not recession proof he says.
8294839	8298220	We've probably as an industry been better than other industries.
8300000	8302761	We thought we would be selling more but we're not pretty much.
8305590	8307992	Yeah, that's really not the case everywhere else in the world so much.
8309293	8310694	But there's light, Rob.
8310714	8311735	There's light at the end of the tunnel.
8312316	8313677	We're waiting on the 3DS.
8315498	8316299	That's what they're saying.
8325907	8326807	We had to let that go.
8327988	8330911	Yeah, they're waiting on the 3DS because you don't need glasses.
8333590	8337972	And he also, though, denied that Nintendo has been forced to slash prices.
8342493	8343653	Alas, Nintendo.
8344434	8344954	Alas.
8351796	8352676	I can't help it.
8352716	8354537	Enough of your drinking ginger ale.
8357662	8358022	What?
8361904	8364966	Just your perfect cap to destroy a last Nintendo.
8367087	8368248	What is wrong with you?
8372970	8379733	Salacious Pop in our chatroom says, Now I'm imagining Reggie in tears floating on a wooden plank saying, Never let go, Wii.
8379974	8380774	Never let go.
8383075	8384416	And then one of his thumbs break off.
8387947	8392770	I won't give up Keep holding on Cause you know I'll make it through, make it through with you
8417836	8421257	Just stay strong
8446175	8447397	The ship sinks again.
8447457	8449420	You think it sunk and everyone died.
8449661	8452225	They really went to a magical town under the water.
8452966	8455270	Where they all lived happily ever after.
8455310	8457012	Titanic Atlantis.
8466096	8469537	The Connect Experience Tour coming to your town soon.
8470037	8483523	They are traveling around the country on the East Coast and on the West Coast showing off a bunch of different Kinect games including Kinectimals, Kinect Sports, Kinect Joyride, Kinect Adventures, and Dance Central.
8483563	8485164	The only game without Kinect in the title.
8486025	8492991	And, um, they will be doing this, um, very close until launch of the actual Kinect on November 4th.
8493672	8501859	So, some notable East Coast, uh, locations, let's see, um, actually starting earlier of this, or well...
8503200	8504020	Yesterday and today.
8504641	8505481	They were at Macy's.
8505541	8507741	You probably didn't see them because they were at Macy's.
8510142	8511402	I like Macy's.
8512022	8514743	If you just happened to go there, then you might have seen it.
8515623	8516784	Some other notable places.
8517784	8522325	August 4th through the 6th, they're going to be in Canton, Ohio at the Football Hall of Fame Rib Burn Off.
8523885	8524806	Okay, well that makes sense.
8525046	8525946	Football Hall of Fame.
8526166	8527786	Okay, that seems to be a good place to go.
8527886	8528086	Alright.
8528246	8528547	Okay.
8529907	8530027	Um...
8531900	8541845	Let's see, October 1st and 2nd, Orlando, Florida, the Disney Wine and Dine Marathon.
8544622	8546103	Disney has a wine and dine marathon.
8546143	8548366	Is that like the wine thing they do at California Adventure?
8548546	8557474	No, I think that's like, remember how Disney in Orlando has a lot of those fancy adult places where you can go taste wine and fancy restaurants and shit like that?
8557554	8557995	Okay.
8558035	8558495	Yeah, there.
8559076	8565382	And then October 14th and the 17th, or through the 17th, you can check out the Texas State Fair.
8566062	8569923	or October 21st through the 24th at the Louisiana State Fair.
8570723	8573784	What other state fairs are they going to be hitting up as well?
8573824	8580666	Minnesota State Fair, Tennessee State Fair, I know the California State Fair.
8580766	8582066	I was going to say, really?
8582086	8585747	Because I'm like, the California State Fair is going on right now here in lovely Sacramento.
8585767	8586668	Are they going to be there, really?
8586788	8590149	Yes, July 28th through August 1st at the California State Fair.
8590569	8591709	Almost worth going there.
8592129	8592649	Almost.
8593630	8597192	Almost worth going and getting subjected to getting shot by a gang.
8598013	8598553	Almost.
8600794	8603896	There's two things you can count on at the California State Fair.
8604316	8607138	The smell of animal poop and gang shootings.
8608018	8608379	Every year.
8609159	8613240	You know, this is a surprise to me, but I never knew that Minnesota was on the West Coast.
8613360	8617741	But apparently they're going to be at the Mall of America from July 15th to August 22nd.
8618161	8619901	That's a pretty long-ass time there.
8619961	8621781	So Mall of America, that's your place to go.
8622221	8625022	You'd think they'd have the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America.
8625322	8626042	Exactly.
8627102	8627802	What other state fairs?
8627822	8631723	Colorado State Fair, Utah State Fair, New Mexico State Fair.
8632823	8636484	They're going to be at the Universal City Walk on September 24th through the 26th.
8638544	8642107	And, uh, October 7th through the 11th, San Francisco at Fleet Week.
8645629	8646450	And, um...
8648618	8649539	Oh, the Arizona State Fair.
8650279	8651400	So, yes, a bunch of different dates.
8651500	8652381	They have it, actually.
8652841	8660186	You can check it out on Facebook, facebook.com slash connect, or the Gamerscore blog.
8660647	8665851	They've got the dates posted there as well, or a lot of the gaming sites do, in case you're interested in checking it out.
8666731	8672976	I might be interested in checking out the State Fair, but my God, it's a State Fair, and I have to go there, and it's hot outside.
8672996	8673616	It's hot.
8674097	8674377	It's so hot.
8674397	8674497	It is.
8674537	8675097	It's hot.
8675177	8675738	It's hot.
8676900	8678504	And seriously, the safer sucks.
8678945	8684236	Salacious Pop in chat is asking me, can we go this weekend and get deep fried foods and ride on Spinner Hurl rides?
8684296	8686701	And I'm like, honestly, my first reaction is like, no.
8689185	8690106	No, we can't.
8690586	8691187	I don't know.
8691447	8693308	The State Fair is okay.
8693348	8700373	It might be neat to check out, but honestly, Dance Central will be the only game I might be kind of interested in checking out.
8701313	8701834	How would you go?
8701894	8704636	There's no way in hell you're going to be able to take the wife to the State Fair.
8704676	8705416	It's way too hot out.
8705476	8707257	I'm just convinced the coworkers to go.
8707878	8708718	Or I'd go myself.
8708758	8710079	I'll go with you, I guess.
8710840	8711720	I'm not going, dude.
8711800	8712501	Okay, let me put it this way.
8713181	8714321	Let's just break this down here.
8714662	8716022	July 28th through August 1st.
8716242	8720744	There is a good percentage chance that the baby will be here by then.
8721384	8722324	I will not be going anywhere.
8722364	8724445	You're going to be too busy changing poopy diapers.
8724505	8728246	Jamie, save a Vicodin and then take it and we'll go.
8729687	8730847	If you pay for me to get in, I'll go.
8732372	8733853	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8762689	8767795	Uh, that's, it's, it's a week from next, week from this upcoming weekend.
8768276	8769717	So August 1st is what, a Sunday?
8769997	8772560	It would be, uh, yeah, Sunday.
8772861	8773481	We have a show then.
8773521	8778467	Well, it's the 28th though, that's like... A show live from the State Fair, is it possible?
8779768	8780069	Maybe.
8780089	8780329	No.
8780810	8781290	I don't think it is.
8781450	8783773	We can just record, bring the, I found the little recorder.
8785144	8785984	It's State Fair.
8786024	8787925	It's hot.
8787945	8791766	Look, there's a lot of things that I would call off a show for.
8791906	8793847	I've called off a show to go to Disneyland.
8794267	8796668	I've called off a show to go to various expos.
8797048	8799929	I would not call off a show to go to the freaking State Fair.
8802330	8803490	It's just too tacky.
8803751	8806812	I've gone to... What was it?
8806952	8807512	It was a...
8809867	8811027	I don't remember what the fair was.
8811167	8821510	It was some sort of rib cook-off and country music fair thing that was down by Rayleigh Field to see Rock Band 2.
8822350	8823450	And I did that one time.
8823530	8825831	I saw Rock Band at the state fair, actually, a couple years ago.
8826311	8827771	Yeah.
8828191	8832472	That was the same night that I broke up with that asshole.
8832872	8834033	That was the same night.
8835013	8835713	Oh my god.
8838737	8839999	Wow, this show took a tumble.
8842522	8843763	Where's sad trombone?
8845325	8852515	Hey, next story, something a lot happier than horrible experiences at the State Fair.
8853339	8854320	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8875157	8876217	Thanks for watching!
8895983	8900146	And it's actually about the original character's grandkids going back to the haunted house.
8900626	8902667	And it's basically kind of a very similar plot.
8902767	8905969	And I gotta admit, looking at the graphics, it looks very kid-ish.
8906609	8913133	But I guess it's kind of cool that they're bringing out the old games and making, you know, kind of new ones.
8913633	8917775	I hope there's some other old-ass Atari games that they'd maybe do this to.
8918275	8918796	But I don't know.
8918816	8923498	I think this is one of those games you might fire up once and go, oh, that's cute, and then probably never play again.
8923518	8924018	They're actually...
8925319	8926400	Are there other ones they're talking about?
8926820	8928061	There's supposed to be other ones.
8928242	8931124	I thought I had heard something about that there were other games they were thinking about.
8931204	8932165	Centipede.
8933106	8933426	Really?
8933586	8935027	Yeah, I saw a game for Centipede.
8935047	8935988	I'm like, really?
8936368	8937950	What the hell are they going to do with Centipede?
8937970	8939731	I think this is not Frogger.
8940072	8940852	Human Centipede?
8941353	8942954	No, it's not Human Centipede.
8944535	8945556	There was another one, too.
8945616	8946317	I don't remember what it was.
8947678	8948799	But Centipede was one of the games.
8950933	8954418	It was also leaked out on Gamefly.
8955159	8957543	They had it because everyone trusts Gamefly over me.
8959946	8960407	Sad days.
8961709	8962350	All right.
8962410	8966356	I think we need to move on with our show and get into the mailbag.
8971676	8976878	Every week you guys send us emails and we read them here on the program to our much amusement.
8977738	8982559	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com and we're going to answer your questions that you've emailed us.
8982619	8986661	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com or sometimes you guys share funny stories and things of that sort.
8986761	8988121	So let's get to it.
8988181	8989481	DarkSakura is going to read some emails.
8990522	8994043	We've got three to go through and I'm going to start with the shortest of them first.
8995623	8997804	Well, kind of the second shortest, but the other one's got some stuff.
8998240	8998940	Hey, OLR!
8999140	9001342	Plissken here to ask a few questions.
9002142	9006124	First, if you could be in any video game, which would it be and why?
9007585	9013087	If I had to, I'd be in Sims 3 so that I could have an infinity code so that I'd never get hungry.
9014188	9015309	I could never age.
9015669	9015969	Never.
9017750	9022192	And I could decide how hot the person I want to look like and everything.
9023024	9030473	I would be in Animal Crossing so I could get rewarded with refrigerators and dressers and radios for running people's mail to the post office.
9031614	9031894	Loki.
9038682	9039163	I don't know.
9040560	9041801	I wouldn't really want to be in any game.
9042501	9043261	Mega Man Universe.
9043962	9044842	Because that looks retarded.
9045923	9046303	I don't know.
9046323	9047003	I don't have a good answer.
9047344	9048364	I'd also want to be in... I know!
9048424	9049185	Totem Ball!
9049205	9051066	Because it is such an awesome game!
9051886	9053307	But you were in Totem Ball!
9053487	9054467	Oh my god!
9054507	9055928	My bone!
9058930	9060771	Second, I know you guys... Wait, wait, wait.
9060811	9061871	I'd also want to be in Pokemon.
9062572	9063032	Just saying.
9063652	9063912	Okay.
9064152	9064573	Squirtle.
9064613	9064973	Squirtle.
9066505	9075130	Second, I know you guys bash on Facebook Gaming, but believe it or not, there are some fun games on Facebook like My Hero's Ability and thousands of poker games.
9075310	9076490	So my question is, what gives?
9076950	9079512	As in, maybe you're into those games, but I don't think we are.
9080783	9081984	I don't hate all Facebook games.
9082024	9083344	Jamie, you admitted to playing one.
9083504	9085785	I played Farmville for like a week, okay?
9086085	9087005	A moment of weakness.
9087305	9087966	It was dumb.
9088626	9089566	I was young and naive.
9089806	9091407	I think I played Bejeweled Blitz once.
9091427	9092387	Yeah, Bejeweled Blitz is cool.
9093167	9095648	I don't hate on Facebook games a lot.
9095708	9100290	I mean, I think the whole social networking gaming thing is kind of retarded.
9100750	9101570	And that's kind of stupid.
9101610	9105452	It sounds like an old man saying, Oh, get your fancy electronic shit!
9105812	9108473	But, no, it's really, I don't understand what the point is.
9108533	9108773	Like, hey,
9109053	9111034	Hey, look, you know, hey, I sent you a unicorn.
9111094	9111914	Send me something.
9112135	9115236	I hate it when people send me shit in Facebook.
9115436	9116177	I delete it.
9116417	9118358	I do not forward anything.
9118398	9119518	I think that's it.
9119678	9121980	It's not Facebook games we hate.
9122120	9124881	It's Facebook games spam that we hate.
9125521	9126782	I'm all for free games.
9127682	9128743	I just don't like the spam.
9129623	9130864	Yeah, that's annoying.
9132085	9137868	It's like those, seriously, those chain mails where it's like, oh, send it to five of your friends and lucky things will happen to you.
9138528	9138648	Yeah.
9139406	9139968	So I don't hate that.
9141152	9145364	I had a point, but I totally forgot it was in arguing about how Facebook games are.
9148584	9149224	Oh, what was it?
9149324	9152246	Oh, My Hero's Ability, or whatever.
9152466	9158469	That reminds me of that Stephen Lynch song, Superhero, where he starts naming off superheroes.
9158549	9159569	It kind of sounds like Pokemon.
9160670	9166232	Monty Boggs, by the way, is also answering that question about what video game would you want to be in in our chat room at chat.orange.radio.com.
9166712	9169334	I would want to be in Deal or No Deal, Constant Money.
9170894	9172355	There's a deal or no deal Facebook game.
9173475	9175776	I think that's the most pointless freaking game in the entire world.
9176056	9177937	I think they're all relatively pointless.
9177957	9178777	Guess the number.
9179097	9180738	But like deal or no deal especially.
9181218	9182018	Guess the number.
9182338	9182938	That's what it is.
9183078	9184439	But Rob, it's Howie Mandel.
9184579	9185579	How can you go wrong there?
9187200	9187820	Don't get me started.
9188260	9188840	It's Howie.
9189081	9189841	Is there more to the email?
9191701	9192762	Yes, there is.
9193962	9195943	Stupid, stupid Facebook.
9196283	9198964	I am looking forward very much to the Civilization game on Facebook.
9200183	9201024	I am.
9201625	9202205	And how.
9202345	9202746	And how.
9202786	9205129	And I can't wait to sieve whore it up with my friends on Facebook.
9205169	9205770	Yay!
9206090	9206571	More!
9207492	9208473	Third is for Loki.
9209454	9215482	You know, I'm trying really not to be so grammar crazy and... But... Sucks.
9216323	9224409	Third is for Loki, I've owned a PSP-1000 for almost a year, and now all of a sudden the D-pad is freaking out.
9224829	9231314	All I want to do is go right dot dot dot, I'm using ellipse okay, all by itself.
9231534	9239519	Now this wouldn't bother me, but it gives me vertigo when playing Dissidia Final Fantasy, because the D-pad controls the camera.
9240080	9244343	My question is, can this be fixed, or do I have to shell out money to be a new one?
9245304	9246087	To be anyone.
9247010	9248215	You wanna be a D-pad when you grow up.
9248235	9250202	Well, we know what video game he wants to be in.
9251794	9258637	Yeah, it can't be fixed because the D-pad is actually on what they call a ribbon bus cable, which you cannot solder to, unfortunately.
9258877	9260438	I've tried, and it breaks it.
9262199	9266241	All you have to do is buy the replacement ribbon bus cable, assuming that that's what's wrong with it.
9266841	9271843	Probably there's a kink or something where something broke, and so now it's just being held down.
9271903	9272563	It could be dirty.
9272923	9273524	You never know.
9274424	9276465	Basically, you just have to bust the system open.
9277445	9305923	and possibly replace that which those aren't that expensive you can probably get a set of ribbon bus cables for I think I bought one for $10 to $20 maybe it should be really cheap probably under $15 so that's all you need to do you just slide it in there and put it all back together and it should work no guarantees though because I don't know if that's exactly what's wrong it could also be there could be some sort of bridging going on somewhere else in there
9306703	9311225	Um, it's hard to say until you bust it open and see what actually is broken in there.
9311285	9320169	But, if it's the actual D-pad sticking, like the controller button is actually sticking down, it's probably dirty and you just need to clean it out.
9320469	9326512	I've seen some friends with PSPs that I've fixed for them that are fucking disgusting.
9326652	9328993	There's just the amount of dirt and grime that's on it.
9329073	9330554	I just, like, what do you do?
9330634	9333255	Do you, like, seriously sweat grease?
9333495	9334696	I mean, or sweat, like...
9336053	9337114	Axel Grease or something.
9337174	9339275	It's ridiculous the amount of dirt that's on there.
9339815	9342777	But yeah, cleaning your PSP, try that first.
9343037	9346279	If that still doesn't work, then you may need to replace that ribbon bus cable.
9346559	9348821	If that doesn't work, you're probably going to need a PSP.
9350461	9352623	I kind of agree with Legend of Zaku in our chat room.
9352683	9354544	PSP's D-pad in general is ass.
9356547	9362294	They're better than the Xbox 360 D-pad.
9362474	9362975	That's for sure.
9365237	9368061	You guys are being mean to the poor Xbox.
9369162	9370524	What else is new tonight?
9371004	9372166	Was that it for that email or is there more?
9372985	9374146	Final question is for Rob.
9374766	9377247	How would I go about coming out to my family?
9378807	9379407	Wow.
9381228	9381748	Wow.
9382388	9383729	That's a bit of a tangent.
9385870	9386270	Okay.
9386310	9388070	I'm a big fan of skywriting.
9388530	9389731	I can offer a resource.
9390331	9390872	Yes, please.
9391952	9398337	The Human Rights, what's the name of their equality thing?
9398417	9401259	They've got the store in San Francisco.
9401339	9402119	Human Rights Campaign.
9402219	9402560	Thank you.
9402820	9413967	The Human Rights Campaign has actually brochures and free material up on their website if you do want to actually have something in writing by a psychologist and stuff.
9414008	9415749	So they do have resources there.
9417110	9417570	Uh, okay.
9417690	9420493	How do I tackle this question without taking 30 minutes?
9420913	9421314	Um, okay.
9422735	9427219	First off, if you need additional advice, send me a personal email, robatorangeontrager.com.
9427499	9428660	I'll address this off the air.
9429221	9431143	Um, cause I really don't know anything about this listener.
9431243	9432124	I don't know how old you are.
9432244	9435947	I don't know what you're like, if you have a hostile family situation or what's going on.
9436267	9439831	Cause I think different situations necessitate different responses.
9439851	9439911	Um,
9441451	9468540	I know there's a lot of push out there that say like you know come out come out wherever you are and all this stuff but I completely understand that sometimes that is not necessarily the answer at the end of the day who you have in your bedroom is your business and I understand your desire to tell your family that and I think you know if you have that type of family you should tell them that that's going to be supportive and loving but there are sometimes some some sticky situations so I don't know your family background or what have you my advice is
9470222	9473125	Tell Your Best Friend Tell Your Best Friend
9485100	9485420	DarkSakura.com
9514987	9516368	Yeah, good job
9542941	9543382	I hope.
9544463	9545023	Yeah?
9545183	9546385	That's a challenging question.
9546425	9548387	I haven't been asked that in the eight years of doing this.
9548427	9548867	I don't think.
9549268	9565184	I've been told by people, you know, which is always a wonderful compliment and just an astonishing feeling, you know, like, thank you for being, you know, out on the radio and just, you know, being a guy who likes games who happens to be gay, but I don't think I've had that question.
9566772	9574683	but thank you for asking because I think it takes a lot of guts to even type that out so please email me if you need it
9576659	9578359	Um, this one's from Robaba.
9579740	9586161	It says, this is particularly for Jamie, and he sends me a link from doitmyself.org of a TARDIS cake.
9586901	9590762	But it lights up and it's got the inside of the TARDIS through the window.
9591922	9592582	But it's a cake.
9593762	9594542	That is awesome.
9595662	9599963	And he concludes his email with, it's probably too involved for most, but it is cool.
9600003	9604064	I'm going to share the link with our chatters real quick.
9606835	9608397	I like the TARDIS made of cake.
9608577	9609157	I would eat that.
9610038	9610459	Delicious.
9611039	9615744	I think I'd just make a cake in the shape of a TARDIS, but I can't bake for crap.
9616485	9618146	I can't even make pancakes right, Rob.
9619928	9620508	That's awful.
9621750	9622851	Okay, last email.
9625464	9626565	Greetings, OLR.
9626725	9627326	Rini here.
9628046	9634531	A few episodes ago, you mentioned having a contingency plan for when Loki needs to care for his newborn bundle of joy.
9635092	9640256	Although there's always the amusing chance that he may never be gone, I still would like to suggest a host.
9641016	9642277	A guest host, Scott Rubin.
9642817	9651603	I'm just listening to the guy and I think he'd be doing OLR and his All Games fans a favor by chiming in once with his thoughts on games and gaming news today.
9652203	9660988	Also, he would make this show run seven hours long and prompt everyone to call in sick due to copious but responsible amounts of drinking, perverted discussions, and not giving a fuck in general.
9662490	9672043	I think I approve of that and since DarkSakura and Sky recently purchased Team Fortress 2 I'd like to make a few suggestions on classes since Sky isn't so hot with the aiming 1.
9673525	9674746	Learn the maps with Medic
9675785	9679067	You can learn where items and paths are while helping your teammates.
9679227	9688672	Overheal everyone, but focus on assisting those taking fire, and especially do not be afraid to turn around and see what's around you.
9689172	9694595	If you unlock the Ubersaw, feel free to knife weaker classes to gain power for your Ubercharge.
9695667	9696368	2.
9695747	9696368	Try Pyro.
9696608	9697028	Can I say?
9697169	9700732	I was actually thinking of being a medic because I'm always the white mage in these games.
9700892	9701132	Always.
9701833	9702754	Okay.
9702774	9702754	2.
9703054	9703574	Try Pyro.
9704195	9712102	Incredibly helpful with this flamethrower because it can air blast to push enemies and rockets grenades or slash grenades while putting out fires on teammates.
9712542	9717527	Be sneaky and use hit and run tactics to let the afterburn make enemies retreat or at least
9718827	9719728	Hold off them a bit.
9719868	9721528	If they're alone or weak, finish them off.
9721688	9724649	Always check for spies and never use the back burner.
9724729	9726050	That's capitalized, never.
9726630	9728050	And it's capitalized always, by the way.
9728630	9729911	Three, try Engineer.
9730351	9738014	Build teleporters and dispensers to help teammates and place sentries where they can cover an important point while being shielded by some part of the level.
9738514	9742355	Unlock the Wrangler and the Gunslinger to deploy many sentries for offensive play.
9742715	9745076	Don't forget hitting buildings with your wrench...
9745996	9770719	Double their construction speed and all but the mini sentries can be upgraded to level 3 If your buildings get sapped by spies, always kill the spy first and then get rid of the sappers Don't forget that your wrench has a higher chance to deal critical hits than most other melee weapons I was actually going to try to engineer because I found that they have now where you can move your sentries around Your turrets
9771536	9773338	Apparently everyone's playing Engineer because of it.
9773578	9773738	Yeah.
9773758	9774218	That's what I hear.
9774839	9777481	For more information and strategies... Okay, I have to do the voice.
9779903	9780143	Ready?
9781144	9785067	For more information and strategies, I direct you to the official TF2 wiki here.
9785668	9789571	http://wiki.teamfortress.com good luck and don't fail, damn it.
9795945	9798467	Rini is very excited to have us playing Team Fortress 2.
9798707	9800849	I've seen it on the Twitter as well.
9801350	9802431	I actually need to revisit it.
9802471	9803872	I didn't really touch it at all this week.
9804152	9806194	Well, I really haven't been able to do much.
9806274	9808536	Well, yeah, you got the hand thing going on, though.
9808576	9810137	Well, we still have to have our game.
9810157	9810798	We shook on it.
9810878	9814021	So whenever your hand's better, we're going to get on that.
9814321	9816583	Do you like my announcer voice?
9817384	9817624	I do.
9820003	9824286	I could do my wacky morning DJ voice though, wouldn't that be fun to do an entire episode?
9824906	9828289	Ha ha ha, I can do the annoying female co-host voice.
9828959	9830099	Maybe for the next April Fool's show.
9830799	9832260	Oh, the Scott thing, too.
9833240	9836341	I think a lot of the All Games folks miss hearing him on the radio.
9836441	9838161	He certainly had a fun show.
9839001	9840142	He's not on the radio anymore?
9840482	9843062	Well, he does the Appaday thing now.
9843122	9844643	They're doing the TV thing.
9845443	9848904	Him and Diane Mizzota do a show, which is kind of fun, that's online.
9851144	9852386	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9867262	9872406	Having a co-host via Skype anything is gonna suck.
9873226	9876728	And I realize other shows do it, and they do it really well.
9877069	9884353	But you have to remember, we've been spoiled over eight years of being in the same room doing this show, and I think it's honestly what makes our show different at the end of the day.
9884714	9895781	And I will tell you, the most fun I've had doing radio with Scott was when we were in the same room, like the E3 Outpost and the random times we dropped into All Games Interactive and some of those things.
9896101	9897042	When they had that,
9897782	9898503	Thanks for watching!
9917335	9921002	Um, so again, we don't want to be so quick.
9921062	9927354	Like, gosh, Loki, all we can do is sit here and talk about who's going to replace you for one week.
9928661	9929241	I don't even care.
9929581	9931362	I know, I know.
9931642	9932343	It's just kind of one of those.
9932363	9934424	We're just going to see who's available that week.
9934444	9935824	We'll burn that bridge when we get to it.
9935844	9940086	If we have to pick someone up off Skype, we will, but we have got lots of great people.
9941066	9942787	I'm sure Alan could come back for a show.
9943167	9944528	Drew, you know, wants to do it.
9944548	9947629	It'll be done through an elaborate ceremony featuring roses.
9947709	9949290	Dan could do it.
9949570	9950090	He's here.
9950110	9952511	That's because he lives here, Rob.
9952552	9955573	I think the chatters would love it if Extifer would come back for a night.
9955973	9956793	Maybe Irene.
9957374	9958154	We'll figure something out.
9958991	9959551	You know what?
9961212	9969095	I really, really, really would like for... And Dan actually was excited about wanting to be on the show tonight, but the family's leaving town.
9970656	9975938	But I think that we need to have Dan be a co-host for a night.
9976558	9977459	Well, maybe that'll happen.
9977759	9978679	I live with the man.
9978779	9979880	He wouldn't let me live it down.
9981320	9981600	All right.
9982421	9983421	I mean, I love my husband.
9984605	9985306	Let's move on to the next
10014000	10017586	F you to the absolute and utter pain that my hand is in.
10017606	10022353	Yeah, while I'm healing faster and...
10024568	10026689	I've got more range of motion.
10026809	10029171	It actually hurts worse, if that makes sense.
10030151	10031332	And the little tight stitches.
10031512	10033053	And it was all for a good thing.
10033093	10033753	I'm very happy.
10034434	10040017	But F you to just being in pain and being tired all the time from it too.
10040057	10041138	I'm really tired all the time.
10041878	10042498	And wanting meat.
10042678	10043799	And I'm not supposed to be eating meat.
10044479	10045620	So F you to all that.
10045720	10048922	And F you to work stuff I've heard about.
10051437	10057239	F you to Apple for reasons I think I explained either on Bobby's show or at the beginning of this show.
10057279	10057919	I can't even remember now.
10057939	10058500	It was all a blur.
10059420	10063141	F you to Stress.
10063261	10068683	I bought a car this week, which is actually awesome and I'm happy, but now I've got to get rid of the old car and that takes a lot of work.
10068803	10070264	So, yeah.
10071164	10071424	That's it.
10073624	10083709	F you to one particular person I saw driving on my way to the show today, completely swerving all around the road, and of course she was texting on her cell phone.
10084529	10086650	Thank you, wonderful, reckless person.
10087670	10091652	Oops, sorry, F you to the fact I just started playing the credits music on accident.
10094131	10095452	and that's it.
10095672	10096913	Can I punctuate that with something?
10096953	10097173	Sure.
10097813	10104157	Nobody's text message or phone conversation is as important as Elijah's on the road around you.
10105117	10105738	Even my mother?
10106602	10106882	Even.
10107202	10108703	I think she'd disagree.
10110584	10116867	Rob, I've told my mother to get off the phone with me if I found out that she was talking to me while she was driving without hands free.
10116907	10123690	Is it okay if I'm stuck in traffic because I totally texted you and Bobby today, but I was sitting in stopped traffic and I was watching.
10123730	10125151	I think that's a little bit different.
10125731	10131994	But there's people who do this crap while they're moving on the road and that's just not right.
10133635	10135776	I'm not perfect, but
10136829	10138089	But you want everyone to think you are.
10138209	10138470	I know.
10138670	10139410	Well, you know.
10139490	10140590	Well, no, I take that back.
10140690	10141791	I am perfect, actually.
10143071	10143411	Rob.
10144091	10144452	Alright.
10145472	10148073	Couple more stories for you guys and then the Skype line.
10148113	10149613	Brace yourselves.
10149633	10154195	877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10154235	10155975	Couple new stories real quick before we get there, though.
10156215	10156495	Loki.
10157036	10160137	I guess Kmart wants me to put reviews up for games.
10160617	10164018	Honestly, wouldn't have known that because I've not been in a Kmart and
10167076	10167857	Kmart has modernized a little bit.
10167877	10171799	I think they are right now somewhere around 93%
10198430	10198951	Just so you know.
10199812	10200774	Rob, you're adorable.
10201555	10202517	I just wanted to let you know.
10202817	10204440	I know.
10205462	10211772	Apparently they are looking for reader reviews or I guess shopper reviews on different titles.
10214847	10219449	They said one thing, we'd like to feature your reviews on our shelves.
10219949	10225391	It says, but at this time we will not be sending out free games for you to review.
10225811	10226552	Which is kind of funny.
10226692	10227092	Wait, what?
10227112	10230753	So like on the shelf they'll have like papers with reviews printed out or something?
10231033	10231454	I guess.
10231474	10240737	It says Kmart, they're basically looking for reviews to help sell games, I guess.
10240777	10242798	So we're supposed to help them market games.
10244264	10244744	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10264871	10268213	People are going to make shit up just to get their stuff in the store.
10290419	10291180	So they do on Steam.
10291340	10292602	You can see the Medicare score right there.
10292682	10295265	Unless it's like under a certain amount, then it's just not there.
10297535	10298535	I don't understand.
10299636	10300856	Or have it on your website.
10300896	10304957	Have people review stuff like Amazon or GameStop or whomever.
10305498	10307438	I think it's an interesting idea.
10307598	10308578	It's just a weird one.
10308658	10309439	You know what I mean?
10309739	10319222	It's interesting that they want to put people's reviews up there and it's, I guess, to encourage a community type thing on the site to get people thinking about Kmart because otherwise you don't.
10320262	10321502	Whoa!
10321662	10322923	My mind's blown here.
10323303	10325944	Apparently Kmart has blogs.
10326864	10327105	What?
10327986	10328286	Yes.
10328346	10328767	Get out.
10328867	10332232	MyKmart.com Do they blog about the coffee shops at Kmart?
10332332	10336037	No, apparently... This Week in the Icy Machine, Blue Raspberry, yum.
10339842	10340423	Well, let's see.
10340503	10341624	Here's some wonderful...
10343334	10347335	Here's some wonderful blog posts that we have going on here.
10347675	10350076	Some of these may even be slightly relevant.
10350976	10351996	Which way do you weed?
10352196	10356878	And this is talking about either using, I guess, a rake or weed spray.
10358278	10361319	Kevin Butler versus Old Spice Man.
10361439	10362079	Who wins?
10362899	10364461	for being, I guess, most infamous.
10365342	10367604	Gamer Chat number one was a success.
10367924	10370547	Thanks to all... Wait, is this like only gaming stuff on the blog?
10370567	10373409	No, this is just blogs.mykmart.com.
10373429	10374671	They have blue light special stuff.
10376352	10378394	They post blue light specials on the blog?
10378815	10379075	Yes.
10379575	10383319	Attention Twitter, blue light special on Pepperidge Farm Cookies.
10383339	10384260	50% off.
10385962	10406285	Gamer Chat number 1166 says I gotta read this Thanks to all who joined yesterday's Gamer Chat Twitter event We had a spirited discussion about gaming including the best year for video games people's first games and some of this year's surprises both good and bad
10407566	10413128	Oh, but if you weren't able to catch it yesterday, you can download or you can check out a full transcript.
10413848	10416929	What are some of the topics that you'd like to discuss in the next gamer chat?
10418449	10420590	Oh, oh, wait, what's this?
10421790	10424471	I, they have a gaming blog too.
10425691	10426852	Kmartgamer.com
10428809	10430090	Are you a Kmart gamer?
10430270	10433773	Or I guess it's blogs.mykmart.com slash games.
10435495	10438337	It's the same fucking blog with video game tags pulled out.
10438537	10439578	I see what you're doing.
10441172	10444994	They talk about what's your backlog of games.
10445374	10448816	Oh my god, Kmart, you're so current with your blogs and fun stuff like that.
10449536	10450896	I have to shop at you now.
10450977	10455819	Kmart is awesome because most every Kmart I've been to totally ignores street dates.
10456719	10457600	Totally ignores them.
10457720	10461681	I bet if you went into Kmart and go, yeah, I saw it on your blog, they'd be like, huh?
10461842	10462402	What's a blog?
10462462	10462702	Huh?
10464763	10465443	On the internet?
10465463	10466564	What the hell's the internet?
10467984	10468745	That's witchcraft.
10469622	10488375	Did I tell you about the time that, like, Target was closed for, like, six months, and Walmart, I just, I wasn't gonna go to Walmart, so I actually went to Kmart to get, like, razor blades, and it was the most, like, challenging, first of all, they have them locked, cause, you know, I guess there's rampant thievery of razor blades across the nation.
10489896	10497841	I had to track someone down to get a key, and they give it to just, like, the old craggly lady, and
10499195	10500737	Here's another wonderful topic.
10501157	10503660	What kind of razor blade did you want?
10503700	10505502	Did you want the Gillette Mach 5?
10506243	10509226	Or did you want... I mean, just like, oh my god, I want to die.
10509467	10514873	From June 23rd, 2010, Fat Guy in a Little Coat, Biggest Loser Special.
10517335	10518637	You're talking about the Biggest Loser game.
10521903	10522243	Wow.
10522583	10526166	My life is now complete now that I have discovered Kmart has a blog.
10526386	10527667	I will read it every day.
10527967	10528467	You know what?
10528507	10529628	For sure.
10529668	10533450	Kmart updates their blog more regularly than any of us post on OrangeSoundsRadio.com.
10533510	10534050	I don't care.
10534110	10534771	I wouldn't hate it.
10535191	10536732	Do you want me to post nonsense like this?
10536912	10538693	I will be happy to post nonsense like this.
10538933	10540214	Toe that, I played that game.
10540514	10541515	It was wonderful.
10541775	10543336	Go buy it at Kmart.
10547708	10549149	Look at me making reference to it.
10549289	10552792	Would you please sign up for a Kmart account and start reviewing games?
10552912	10561899	I think we should all sign up for Kmart accounts and start reviewing games on there with just like complete nonsensical reviews of things.
10561999	10564341	Like, you know... Like, you know...
10565842	10566703	Thank you for watching!
10586249	10587030	I'm sorry, Rob.
10587230	10590074	My brain started to shut down when you started talking about that.
10590094	10594500	What you're describing sounds like a lot of effort.
10595201	10595822	I'm going to do it.
10595982	10599486	I'm going to start a forum thread for awesome Kmart reviews.
10599667	10603011	And I want all the OL Army to post their awesome Kmart reviews and link them.
10603251	10605954	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10618021	10619122	Just like us.
10619402	10630970	You'll be talking about your Red Dead Redemption review and then somehow talk about how you like horses and this one time you rode a horse and then it gave you like, you know, crotch rash or something like that and how that was terrible.
10631150	10635333	But at least the horse's name was like, you know, Biscuit or something.
10635393	10647341	I was riding my horse Clyde and I skinned a horse in Red Dead Redemption that reminded me of Clyde and one time Clyde kicked me in the shin and it made me pee.
10649102	10649582	How about that?
10650983	10651683	Monty Boggs.
10651703	10652424	Here, this is great.
10652484	10654265	Now people are posting their reviews.
10654285	10654725	This is great.
10655225	10658487	Alan Wake makes me want to buy Energizer batteries at Kmart.
10658567	10659888	Buy Alan Wake at Kmart.
10659988	10661809	Alan Wake from GameStop wasn't as good.
10661849	10662390	That's pretty good.
10663650	10665932	Ray Ayanami says, great rail shooter.
10665992	10673076	Now has anyone been far as decided to use even Go 1 to do look more like... I get it.
10678317	10679478	Wait, let me try to read it again.
10679518	10680118	That's awesome.
10680678	10682979	That's an awesome review of Sin of Punishment 2.
10683980	10684980	Great rail shooter.
10685060	10689783	Now has anyone really been far as decided to use even Go What To Do look more like?
10693685	10694605	I love you guys.
10701008	10702809	That should be on the tag right there.
10708114	10711678	That about sums up what I think of Kmartner reviewing.
10714241	10717264	You've been far as decided to use even go what to do more look like?
10717625	10718686	That's about right.
10720187	10720728	That's the point.
10720768	10722069	DarkDead2D is like, I don't get it.
10722109	10723471	That's the point.
10723731	10729357	He just threw a bunch of words together that make no sense at all and it's funny and I'm laughing so hard I'm crying.
10729437	10730298	I can't stop.
10733696	10737262	DarkSakura is not throwing up over there at the bad grammar.
10738023	10740727	No, because this is appropriately bad grammar.
10742110	10743332	It's like little cats.
10744854	10746657	I do not go around correcting little cats.
10746837	10748500	I pet them on the head and feed them fish.
10749713	10754495	All right, one more story for you guys, and then we'll get to the calls.
10754515	10755655	1-877-GAME-OLR.
10755735	10757796	Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10760957	10770060	The Brick Theater in Brooklyn, New York is putting on some shows, and they are video game-inspired plays.
10770760	10771601	Yes, that's right.
10772402	10781449	There's Grand Theft Ovid, which takes the Roman poets' Ovid songs and integrates it with Grand Theft Auto.
10782210	10785793	Modal Combat uses guitar controllers.
10786713	10788195	I don't even understand this.
10788275	10789556	This is just like, what?
10790777	10792258	Let me look at the official website here.
10792298	10792778	Let me look here.
10792798	10794460	I'm going to the Brick Theater website here.
10795241	10796642	Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
10797422	10800204	Gameplay at the Brick Is art playable?
10800324	10801525	Are video games cinematic?
10801605	10802786	Is Mashima theatrical?
10802866	10804046	Are smartphones a stage?
10804387	10806948	Is there an architecture that connects these diverse media forums?
10807268	10812932	What boundaries can be broken within and without the walls of an off-off-Broadway theater to change your reviews?
10814473	10823739	They're having Rock Band Karaoke Night Well, that's not a play Baby Castles, Chiptunes Dance Party Kool-Aid Man and Second Life
10825578	10829320	Theater of the Arcade, five classic video games adapted for the stage.
10829680	10835142	In this collection of short plays, the creators of Brick hit suspicious package and create... This is stupid.
10835982	10836483	Like, what?
10837423	10838563	This makes no sense.
10840844	10842165	It gets a Dan quote, Rob.
10842465	10842705	What?
10843585	10843986	Really?
10845726	10846407	That's a Dan line.
10846587	10847027	You know what?
10847047	10850828	I'm going to write a review of these plays and it's going to say, great rail shooter.
10850888	10854490	Now, has anyone really been far as decided to use even Go What To Do look more like?
10857537	10860099	because that's pretty much my reaction when reading this story.
10860119	10865003	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10865043	10868046	If you want to give us a call, we'll talk.
10868066	10869307	1-877-GAME-OLR.
10869327	10870808	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10871168	10873270	The Skype line is now open.
10874411	10876593	Frisbee is asking, what game should I review?
10876693	10878995	You should review Blur.
10880216	10881857	Frisbee, I'd like you to review the game Blur.
10883078	10883959	Let's go to the phones.
10884279	10885360	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10885380	10885761	Who's this?
10887361	10888542	Hi, it's Ray Ayanami.
10888802	10889442	Hi, Ray.
10889502	10890883	Good to see you yesterday at the show.
10892224	10893184	Yeah, good to see you too.
10893324	10894425	It was really good to see you.
10895866	10896166	Yeah.
10896887	10897527	So what's on your mind?
10900048	10913076	So for California Extreme, the games I'm looking for were the Don't Bunch Diojo, Ghoul Space Harrier, Red, among other things.
10914997	10916378	Wait, there was a space harrier there?
10916498	10917918	There was a space harrier tucked away in the back.
10918299	10918699	Oh, I missed it.
10918719	10925362	Yeah, but unfortunately, I don't know, the person who said the machine forgot to put in a pad credit button.
10925482	10932805	So, for the first, you had to put in a coin and, like, take the coin out of the coin door just to start a game.
10932885	10936467	And the second day, they closed the coin door, so you had to put in a quarter, which is kind of dumb.
10939249	10942452	Yeah, it was kind of bothersome when some of those games would run out of credits.
10942552	10948877	But, you know, I can't hate because they're just arcade collectors, and they're actually doing a favor, putting their machines out there.
10949238	10951460	They don't have to do it, so I try not to bitch.
10951500	10954562	But it was really frustrating when, like, I wanted to play Tapper, and it was out of credits.
10954903	10955663	It's like, wham.
10958706	10963030	So, in other news, I've gotten around to playing Death's Mouth and Sin of Postman 2.
10964109	10966310	Now, what was your real review of Sin and Punishment 2?
10966450	10970411	Because, by the way, that was you I noticed in chat that has now spawned the new OLR quote.
10970451	10974112	Has anyone really been far as decided to use even Go What To Do Look More Like?
10974132	10977353	Did you bring 4chan to this show?
10985049	10988310	Oh, goddamn you!
10988410	10990431	Okay, whatever.
10990571	10992611	No, I'm just fucking around.
10993671	10998253	Kids on the internet are funny.
10998553	11001874	It's pretty fun.
11002034	11003794	It's a great improvement over the last game.
11004514	11010016	I'm going to warn anyone who wants to get that game, even those who have played the original, it's freaking hard.
11012435	11012835	I see.
11013255	11015096	Aren't most of those shooter games pretty hard?
11018318	11025962	Yeah, I mean, if these aren't too bad by real shooter standards, it's the bosses that get to me mainly.
11028704	11034947	But I have to do a few tries to get the patterns down so I don't end up bullshitting through a pattern.
11035347	11038088	Go ahead.
11041383	11043824	And I've been playing Deathmoth as well for the past two weeks.
11045325	11045825	And how's that?
11049046	11055629	So Deathmoth, for those who have not heard of it, it's a side-scrolling shooter by Cave with gothic loli elements.
11056449	11056749	Awesome.
11056789	11060531	And that aside, I especially like this game.
11060611	11067293	I love the fact that you can fire in both directions, which is a luxury that most side-scrollers tend to lack.
11067334	11070815	Like, you're stuck firing to the right, which is usually the direction you scroll.
11073028	11076230	It's also much easier to play than other Bloodhound games.
11076430	11084033	Even with the in-game difficulty at the highest, I can get to the final stage easily.
11084793	11092797	But on other shooters, I usually end up only halfway through the game on my first credit.
11096249	11096769	Interesting.
11096889	11097770	You can get that far?
11098270	11103353	I thought that would be the harder game, because usually those shmup games are impossibly difficult.
11105274	11107175	They do call them bullet hell for a reason, though.
11123962	11130326	I fired bombs on the first boss of the Don't Black Style Joe, and that's not something I do in most shooters.
11131527	11138152	Like, I can easily get through the stage one boss of a vertical shooter just fine without using any bombs.
11140614	11142475	Okay, okay.
11142695	11148259	Well, are there any other games coming up in the near future that you're going to be reviewing in the future on the show that you're looking forward to playing?
11149845	11158772	I'm not sure, because I've tried a whole lot of buying new games until the semester begins next month, because Deathmoth and Stem of Punishment took a toll on my money.
11160052	11161133	I hear ya.
11162074	11166037	Now I have a car payment, so I have to watch my gaming funding as well, so I think a lot of us are in that pinch.
11166057	11172701	Like, including tax, both of those games cost me $110, so I've already been waiting until the semester begins, so I'll probably, I don't
11175629	11176750	Reekin Elite Reekin Elite
11197155	11199818	No, I'm a long-time listener but first-time caller.
11199898	11202001	I've always wanted someone to say that on this program.
11202041	11203742	Long-time listener, first-time caller.
11204023	11204884	Well, welcome.
11205204	11205845	How are you doing?
11206165	11206666	What's on your mind?
11206726	11207446	I'm doing good.
11208648	11209168	How can we help you?
11209188	11209589	What's on your mind?
11210430	11212290	Yeah, I just wanted to know, I have a quick question.
11212310	11216371	I don't know if you guys ever played it before, but Borderlands, what do you think about that?
11216551	11217952	Borderlands is awesome!
11219232	11226174	I have not played Borderlands, but I've watched someone else play it, and it kind of looks like, it has a really neat art style.
11226214	11233776	It's kind of like Oblivion meets this very, like, post-apocalyptic kind of world.
11233936	11234296	I don't know.
11234356	11234936	Have you played this?
11235456	11237857	With guns, and it's fun.
11238137	11238657	It's awesome.
11238877	11239837	It's hilarious.
11240077	11240798	Well, it was either one.
11240818	11241559	It didn't bother me too much.
11241579	11243921	I just wanted to know if the community was big, you know, as in...
11262833	11267396	playing it, because the last thing I wanted was to go online on it and then nobody ain't there.
11267556	11268697	That was my fear.
11268977	11281966	I'm going to throw out a cheat plug while I can for our Steam community, which is the OL Army on Steam, and I see people on there once in a while playing Borderlands, so you definitely would have people to play with there.
11281986	11283627	They've released several expansions for it.
11283647	11285128	I've really heard nothing but good things about it.
11285268	11290211	I just haven't had the time to play it myself, thanks to certain MMOs that I spend a lot of time playing.
11290231	11290812	Addict!
11293593	11295234	Do I say wow too all the time?
11295514	11297595	Okay, then you understand what I go through.
11299776	11303338	But yeah, no, I've honestly heard nothing but good things about the game.
11303698	11304499	Here's a thought.
11305159	11308361	If you want to try it out, here's what some people I know are doing.
11309221	11315945	OnLive is this new thing that's out there, and they're still doing sign-ups, and I just read something like it's extended through Labor Day.
11316465	11318686	You can try to get into the beta by signing up.
11319006	11319766	Are you on OnLive?
11320667	11320847	Yes.
11321204	11324050	Okay, you can play demos of games.
11324070	11328600	You can play the first 30 or 45 minutes of a game without buying it, and Borderlands is one of them.
11329545	11330906	Oh, okay.
11331026	11332426	That's a nice, good suggestion.
11332446	11333086	Awesome.
11333146	11333607	Thank you.
11333707	11334227	There you go.
11334307	11335087	Go on to OnLive.
11335387	11339609	You know, I gotta say, as weird as I think the OnLive price is, but here's my suggestion.
11339649	11353034	Don't buy it on OnLive, because the whole thing is that, yeah, it's cool that you're playing through another computer that has all the graphics and everything, but you're paying the same price you'd pay at retail for the game, and it really is only guaranteed to last three years.
11353394	11355415	If OnLive fails, you're gonna lose that game.
11355735	11357076	You're basically paying for a three-year rental.
11357336	11357416	So,
11358136	11359797	If you like the game, go get it on Steam.
11360777	11361038	Okay.
11361478	11361998	Thank you.
11362238	11362958	That's my suggestion.
11362998	11364699	I've got one more quick question and I'll hang up.
11364799	11365220	Of course.
11365260	11368201	Do you think Project Natal... What do you think about Project Natal?
11368221	11370282	Do you think it's going to fail or do you think it's going to succeed?
11370422	11373944	Well, keep in mind we're all supposed to call it Connect now, but...
11375644	11378325	I think it's a huge risk on Microsoft's part.
11378805	11380946	A lot of it has to do with how they market it.
11381566	11388269	The Macy's thing, as much as we give them a hard time about who the hell at Macy's plays Kinect, we know exactly who they're going for.
11388769	11398752	All laughing and jokes aside, they're trying to appeal to Mom, or aka Santa Claus, because they're going directly to make their case there and show the games there.
11398812	11400993	It's a huge risk on Microsoft's part.
11401633	11401914	DarkSakura.com
11419617	11419957	Got you.
11420057	11420397	Okay.
11420797	11421838	I just want to end it with that.
11421998	11422638	Love the show.
11422938	11423358	Keep it up.
11423378	11424079	The good work, man.
11424099	11424839	You guys are awesome.
11424859	11425219	I love it.
11425439	11426279	We love the call.
11426340	11427740	Thank you so much for your enthusiasm.
11427760	11428100	You're awesome.
11428160	11431321	And thank you for saying the phrase that we've been waiting to hear.
11431441	11431661	I know.
11431701	11433022	I've been waiting eight years to hear that.
11433062	11433602	Long time listener.
11433642	11434042	All right.
11434142	11434703	I got you.
11434843	11435143	All right.
11435323	11435883	Take care, buddy.
11435903	11436183	All right.
11436203	11436943	You have a good night.
11437224	11437464	Uh-huh.
11437524	11437844	You too.
11438704	11438984	All right.
11439024	11439324	Bye-bye.
11439344	11439564	Bye.
11439985	11445507	That's how you know we're like legitimate radio now because you know whenever you listen to like a radio talk show, there's always that guy that calls in.
11446967	11447747	Hey, Dr. Laura.
11447807	11448528	Long time listener.
11448588	11449268	First time caller.
11450720	11451000	Love it.
11453584	11456508	I don't know why I named Dr. Laura because she actually really sucks.
11456848	11457929	It means we've arrived.
11458110	11458570	It is.
11458610	11459051	We made it.
11460032	11460493	We made it.
11460893	11461915	That decree meant something.
11461975	11464518	Now the Laverne and Shirley theme is going through my head for some reason.
11465259	11466380	We're gonna do it.
11469885	11476247	By the way, Gold Anthro in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com is kind of offering the counterpoint to what I was just saying about Borderlands.
11476607	11478508	Meh, Borderlands just isn't the game for me.
11478868	11481288	I played it and was like, this isn't as fun as it sounded.
11481969	11484990	So, not everybody's a fan, so take that.
11485250	11488531	But I think OnLive is going to be great for demos.
11490511	11493072	Like, even I have to pat myself on the back.
11493092	11499355	I think that's a good idea to just go play the first 30 minutes of the game for yourself and make a determination if you want to play, you know, more.
11501016	11501736	All right.
11501757	11504858	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
11505378	11506839	Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?
11508288	11508708	Sonic 2 XL
11532182	11533524	But he gets a big old pot belly.
11533844	11534485	That's kind of funny.
11535126	11536428	And that's actually a real ROM hack.
11536448	11540914	You can actually download the ROM that's available on the Sonic Retro forums.
11541495	11546402	Forums.sonicretro.org So check it out there.
11548624	11549465	Can I say this real quick?
11549505	11562260	Because Bonds006 in chat just spoke up and it reminded me of something he said earlier that I forgot to mention, but apparently he ran into a New York Times reporter who was doing a story on DDR and Beat Media and stuff.
11562680	11564062	He totally pimped our show.
11565034	11566054	Now that's a fan!
11566214	11567015	Now that's a fan!
11567035	11568015	Thank you!
11568035	11569135	We love you now.
11569155	11570556	I saw that in the chat room.
11570616	11571836	Yeah, I forgot to mention earlier.
11571856	11575778	I was going to mention it after the iTunes review, but I'm easily distracted by shiny things.
11576498	11577278	So I apologize.
11577298	11578578	It's alright.
11579119	11586321	You may remember there's a company called Blick that puts out different gamer decals or vinyl decals you can put up on the wall.
11586401	11589022	I'm using them in our nursery.
11589602	11591003	I could have just done that for the baby room.
11613604	11615166	DarkSakura should have that up in the vault.
11615186	11617428	I think that looks kind of cool.
11636568	11638549	Although, actually, the way the vault's designed, that wouldn't really work.
11638569	11643311	Well, Dan and I actually did have a talk, because I'm sure I've mentioned it on the show before.
11644532	11650335	Before we were gonna, you know, when we were talking about a kid, we were gonna do a Mario theme.
11651515	11654216	And Dan said, uh-uh, Sonic.
11657758	11661720	That'll be great, too, because at Loki's house, it'll be Mario, and then you'll have Sonic.
11661760	11663241	What do I get, Crash Bandicoot?
11665142	11665362	Yes.
11666042	11666562	I don't know.
11668283	11669263	Crash Bandicoot?
11669603	11673525	Crash Bandicoot was fun for like three games and then they just totally beat him into the ground.
11673845	11674705	I'll get Kevin Butler.
11676105	11677706	Kevin Butler themed nursery?
11677946	11678946	That would be creepy.
11682328	11683888	Why is the baby crying all the time?
11683908	11686189	I don't know what's going on.
11689742	11690303	Anything else?
11690583	11690863	Yes.
11691283	11694524	Cave has announced two more shmup games coming out.
11695344	11703106	They are going to be releasing, I guess, Gwangi on Xbox Live Arcade.
11703126	11707368	Or I should say, yeah, they're going to be releasing that.
11707928	11708108	And...
11710123	11711444	What else are they releasing here?
11715446	11716186	Oh, here we go.
11716486	11723610	Akai Katana, or Red Katana, is going to be a new bullet hell shooter coming out.
11724390	11729253	I believe that's going to be on, I think, the download services like Xbox Live Arcade.
11729893	11735035	And then for the iPhone, they're going to do Dondopatchi Daifukatsu.
11735055	11736156	Yay!
11736296	11738037	I totally want Dondopatchi on my phone.
11738908	11740830	And that'll be coming out on the iPhone this summer.
11742992	11744033	So that's kind of cool.
11744053	11744593	Let's see.
11745134	11749158	Screenshots here of... That's a private video.
11749198	11749778	Well, fuck you.
11749798	11750719	I don't want to read it then.
11751620	11752340	Or watch it.
11752381	11752661	Whatever.
11755472	11781143	apparently Amazon Germany has listed a Xbox 360 4GB arcade system bundle of course they've already announced that they're going to be doing some sort of arcade system this fall in the US and other territories but now we kind of have an idea of what it's going to be it's going to be probably that slimmed down system without a hard drive but a 4GB USB thumb drive they're going to be able to use with it
11783624	11808469	and that's fine since remember you can actually put in your own laptop drives into the Xbox 360 S or whatever the hell you're going to call it just like you can on a Playstation 3 so that's kind of neat I guess but that will be available this fall it looks like it's going to be well right now it's listing at 148.99 euros
11815104	11815184	Um...
11822383	11826006	I think Apple needs to work on, I don't know, like making the iOS's work on their phones first.
11846980	11847521	Thanks for watching!
11863399	11865040	And I know that I shouldn't get an Apple.
11865080	11865940	I shouldn't buy an iPhone.
11865960	11866681	I shouldn't support them.
11867441	11868021	Maybe I won't.
11868182	11868502	I don't know.
11869642	11872724	No, we all know I'm going to get that shiny white new iPhone because I want it.
11873284	11873564	Alright.
11875746	11877687	SGA100 Matt is currently working on a Kmart review.
11877727	11878307	I'm so excited.
11878727	11880769	Okay, that's it though for the show now.
11881330	11886154	Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show and listening to us and downloading us and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
11886975	11888816	We can't do it without your support.
11888856	11891098	We don't have massive advertising or anything like that.
11891138	11896183	It's really word of mouth and the awesome reviews you guys do and telling reporters and shit about us.
11896483	11915761	that is word of mouth at it's finest thank you guys so much we so appreciate it and you guys are the reason we come back week after week and don't let the state fair distract us from doing a show alright but Disneyland might I'm just putting it out there alright anyhow for now though we're going to go around and give everybody's final thoughts Loki why don't you start us off tonight with your final thought
11916201	11917082	DarkSakura, your final thought
11938925	11940567	My Sims house is freaking gorgeous.
11941488	11942909	You've put a lot of flowers in it.
11942949	11944871	It's a very girly house because you have flowers everywhere.
11944911	11945772	It's not very girly.
11946312	11949655	It's this one part of it that's set up as a wildflower garden.
11950276	11952118	And those are totally Sakura trees, aren't they?
11952318	11952738	Yeah, they are.
11953599	11957323	But the rest of the house is very sort of neo-modern and my house floats.
11958644	11959425	We all float here.
11961047	11961367	All right.
11961888	11962308	That's it.
11962608	11964689	We're tuning out and signing off.
11964809	11966891	Thank you guys so much again for your support.
11966911	11968692	We'll be back to do it all again next week.
11968712	11971253	We'll see you next week with more of Orange.
11971493	11976556	Unless Loki's wife has the baby, then he won't be here because that could happen at any time.
11976576	11977177	So stay tuned to Twitter.
11977197	11978057	Well, I hope she doesn't have anything.
11978077	11979218	Yeah, well, that's true.
11979238	11980579	She's still got, what, another month, right?
11982460	11983961	Preferably at least two weeks.
11984381	11985062	At least two weeks.
11985102	11985522	All right then.
11985602	11987123	So hopefully two more weeks of Loki at least.
11987483	11987764	All right.
11988604	11989025	But that's it.
11989345	11990546	Have a wonderful night everybody.
11990706	11993387	We'll see you soon next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
