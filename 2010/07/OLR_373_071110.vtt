00:13.917 --> 00:18.524
[SPEAKER_13]: Tonight, July 11th, 2010, could a cell phone be built into the 3DS?

00:18.925 --> 00:25.616
[SPEAKER_13]: A trial date is set for Infinity Ward vs. Activision, and Microsoft teams up with Fast Food to promote a Kinect game.

00:31.673 --> 00:36.576
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.636 --> 00:39.858
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:39.918 --> 00:41.379
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much for tuning in to us tonight.

00:41.719 --> 00:50.745
[SPEAKER_03]: We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show, www.allgames.com.

00:50.765 --> 00:52.566
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk about video games.

00:53.126 --> 00:54.727
[SPEAKER_03]: Gaming Culture, Gamer Lifestyle.

00:55.187 --> 00:56.088
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts.

00:56.108 --> 00:57.508
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be joining you over the next few hours.

00:57.849 --> 01:02.171
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

01:02.591 --> 01:06.874
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, Jamie Summers?

01:08.875 --> 01:16.339
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I noticed, as we promised two weeks ago, because we didn't have a show because of the 4th of July, you did not come in here as Inspector Gadget tonight.

01:16.479 --> 01:18.160
[SPEAKER_03]: Is everything okay with the fingers?

01:18.930 --> 01:22.352
[SPEAKER_12]: My surgery got delayed to Tuesday because of a scheduling issue.

01:23.312 --> 01:24.773
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, good for us though.

01:24.993 --> 01:27.054
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't ship in the bionic parts.

01:29.075 --> 01:36.338
[SPEAKER_12]: No, basically the thing is that my visit with my last surgeon was set up as my consultation.

01:36.358 --> 01:37.639
[SPEAKER_12]: He was just going to refer me into surgery.

01:38.019 --> 01:40.800
[SPEAKER_12]: Except he didn't put surgery in the thing.

01:41.721 --> 01:43.682
[SPEAKER_12]: I've already filled out all my FMLA and everything.

01:43.862 --> 01:45.503
[SPEAKER_12]: So my new doctor is just like...

01:46.303 --> 01:52.766
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll go ahead and write your leave starting Friday, which is what it was supposed to have been.

01:53.867 --> 01:59.109
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I go in Tuesday at 2 o'clock Pacific to have my hand flayed.

01:59.850 --> 02:01.871
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think they're going to put me under this time.

02:02.911 --> 02:04.873
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you don't get to watch.

02:05.093 --> 02:09.697
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, the only logic, the only reason I think this is because they're telling me not to eat beforehand.

02:10.357 --> 02:13.219
[SPEAKER_12]: So usually that's a sign that they're going to clunk you out.

02:13.320 --> 02:15.401
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they'll just numb like a lot of parts.

02:15.521 --> 02:18.504
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you won't be able to feel like the whole like left half of your body for a little while.

02:18.524 --> 02:23.468
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what happened the last time is that they damned off my arm so that there'd be no blood in my hand.

02:23.908 --> 02:24.809
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:39.181 --> 02:40.461
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you just kind of using one hand?

02:41.242 --> 02:54.246
[SPEAKER_12]: For the most part, I mean, because really it was a lot of running around and, you know, and I was actually using, I had the controller in my lap when I wasn't, you know, walking and was pushing the button with a finger.

02:54.506 --> 03:04.769
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of those RPGs like Final Fantasy, Blue Dragon, and so forth really lend themselves easy to like only having one hand because it's like A, attack, A, target creature, A, A, A, A, over and over, you know?

03:04.829 --> 03:08.250
[SPEAKER_12]: You remember that single-handed PlayStation controller, the RPG controller?

03:08.830 --> 03:09.991
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, vaguely, yes.

03:10.011 --> 03:11.331
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I've got one somewhere.

03:11.511 --> 03:12.132
[SPEAKER_03]: Vaguely.

03:12.292 --> 03:12.432
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

03:12.652 --> 03:14.213
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't very popular, I don't think.

03:14.273 --> 03:15.153
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, well, he's not here.

03:15.353 --> 03:17.574
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we just were given one or something.

03:17.734 --> 03:17.974
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

03:18.255 --> 03:19.815
[SPEAKER_02]: Single hand control schemes are always nice.

03:19.835 --> 03:20.716
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember Earthbound?

03:22.056 --> 03:24.357
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we got a lot of other voices I haven't even introduced yet.

03:25.518 --> 03:27.239
[SPEAKER_12]: I do have to, well, I'll talk about it later.

03:27.339 --> 03:30.520
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki as well.

03:32.301 --> 03:33.902
[SPEAKER_03]: He was drinking a shake.

03:34.901 --> 03:35.521
[SPEAKER_04]: It was hot outside.

03:35.541 --> 03:37.622
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't mean to inconvenience you, I'm sorry.

03:37.682 --> 03:41.083
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's hot outside, so it was the coldest thing I could think of.

03:41.103 --> 03:43.603
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just going to make me really thirsty later.

03:44.084 --> 03:44.664
[SPEAKER_03]: The irony.

03:44.844 --> 03:51.926
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it funny when you're hearing about this East Coast heat wave, and they're like, OMG, it's 100 degrees, and I'm like, that's like Wednesday here.

03:52.686 --> 03:56.927
[SPEAKER_12]: My friend in Canada was posting about it being, I think, 80.

03:58.007 --> 04:00.488
[SPEAKER_12]: She gave it to me in Celsius.

04:02.771 --> 04:05.231
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's 80 degrees Celsius, I don't want to be over there.

04:05.491 --> 04:06.992
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very hot, actually.

04:07.852 --> 04:09.252
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that like 180 degrees?

04:09.772 --> 04:10.352
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, forget it.

04:10.752 --> 04:12.433
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

04:12.993 --> 04:17.233
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, I'm joking a little bit because I know the East Coast isn't really built to handle the heat.

04:17.353 --> 04:19.134
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, everything's got air conditioning.

04:19.334 --> 04:20.894
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have a house without central air.

04:20.934 --> 04:21.854
[SPEAKER_03]: That's unheard of.

04:24.015 --> 04:30.776
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it kind of sucked for them, but it does make me laugh when I hear 100 degrees, panic, panic, panic because I'm like, wake me when it's 113.

04:32.436 --> 04:34.397
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent the weekend in the Bay Area.

04:34.457 --> 04:38.458
[SPEAKER_03]: You drive to the Bay Area, it's like cold and windy still.

04:38.858 --> 04:39.659
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.

04:39.739 --> 04:45.821
[SPEAKER_04]: I had friends come up this weekend and they were from Santa Cruz and they said, yeah, it's like a high of 71.

04:46.041 --> 04:49.162
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, that'd be nice.

04:49.722 --> 04:52.804
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're also going to introduce, he's back this week.

04:52.844 --> 04:57.546
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the heck's going on here, but he's here two weeks in a row-ish, because we didn't really do a show last week.

04:57.566 --> 05:00.368
[SPEAKER_03]: But say hello to intern Drew Nami, he's here tonight.

05:00.588 --> 05:02.629
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi guys, just trying to make it a habit again.

05:02.749 --> 05:03.210
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

05:04.210 --> 05:05.551
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I know what you're trying to do.

05:05.631 --> 05:09.153
[SPEAKER_03]: You're trying to squeeze into Loki's chair when he's out on paternity leave.

05:09.193 --> 05:11.574
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you're trying to do, I think.

05:11.614 --> 05:12.715
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't think I don't know what you're up to.

05:13.175 --> 05:15.397
[SPEAKER_02]: I know nothing, nothing.

05:15.957 --> 05:17.318
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki is irreplaceable.

05:18.879 --> 05:19.820
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.843
[SPEAKER_03]: Knowing him, he won't even be gone.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.406
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll be like, you know, I just had the baby this morning, but I'm here.

05:24.646 --> 05:28.551
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I remember when he was the intern, he was on the floor and he didn't get pizza.

05:29.432 --> 05:29.913
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, look.

05:31.752 --> 05:32.392
[SPEAKER_02]: And how have you been?

05:32.452 --> 05:33.252
[SPEAKER_02]: How's life been treating you?

05:33.272 --> 05:35.133
[SPEAKER_03]: How was the 4th of July for you?

05:35.453 --> 05:53.623
[SPEAKER_02]: Just mostly sat and listened to the fireworks go off Watched a couple fireworks displays in WoW and played some Left 4 Dead Watched fireworks in WoW, probably better than the ones I spent $50 on, that's for sure I also watched fireworks in Animal Crossing I missed the fireworks from Final Fantasy 11, remember that?

05:54.143 --> 05:55.325
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's right.

05:55.445 --> 05:56.206
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my gosh.

05:56.226 --> 05:57.427
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of MMOs do that stuff.

05:58.929 --> 05:59.409
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

05:59.429 --> 05:59.709
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

06:00.330 --> 06:00.590
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

06:01.351 --> 06:06.797
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I spent $50 on safe and sane fireworks, which is all we're allowed in this area.

06:06.837 --> 06:08.159
[SPEAKER_03]: So that lasts about, like, what, five minutes?

06:08.179 --> 06:08.259
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

06:08.923 --> 06:14.932
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wait, $50 on safe and sane fireworks and I just get to hear the idiots down the street shooting off bottle rockets.

06:15.072 --> 06:16.093
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe about 20 minutes.

06:16.113 --> 06:17.455
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you gotta love all the signs everywhere.

06:17.535 --> 06:21.141
[SPEAKER_03]: Zero tolerance on illegal fireworks and all the neighbors all over.

06:21.181 --> 06:23.885
[SPEAKER_03]: We won't tolerate it, but we also won't do anything about it.

06:26.263 --> 06:27.564
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was fine.

06:27.584 --> 06:29.426
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a good night.

06:29.466 --> 06:31.268
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope all of you had a good 4th of July as well.

06:31.308 --> 06:34.450
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you're overseas and maybe you didn't really celebrate the 4th.

06:34.510 --> 06:36.612
[SPEAKER_03]: But I hope you had a good week nonetheless.

06:36.973 --> 06:38.934
[SPEAKER_03]: We're back here with Orange Lawns Radio after our week off.

06:40.856 --> 06:41.977
[SPEAKER_03]: Shezro's in our chat room.

06:42.037 --> 06:44.219
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.OrangeLawnsRadio.com saying, Wow, $50?

06:44.620 --> 06:45.120
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck?

06:45.160 --> 06:45.680
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn.

06:45.761 --> 06:46.982
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the exact quote actually.

06:47.342 --> 06:47.842
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck?

06:47.862 --> 06:48.323
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn.

06:49.204 --> 06:49.764
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing though.

06:50.044 --> 06:52.627
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of charities set up booths here.

06:53.047 --> 06:54.128
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

07:22.042 --> 07:23.824
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

07:38.617 --> 08:01.643
[SPEAKER_04]: They had this giant inflatable barrel that looked like an explosive barrel or something They had 50,000 signs that were out there They had signs literally blocks away They had people waving signs to go buy their fireworks And they were offering all sorts of discounts And I was like, no, they suck I'm still not buying them Oh, and they had a bounce house

08:02.674 --> 08:03.736
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.

08:03.876 --> 08:04.478
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of stuff.

08:04.518 --> 08:06.061
[SPEAKER_04]: All the money that they spend on their advertising?

08:06.722 --> 08:07.945
[SPEAKER_04]: Not going to make it up with the fireworks.

08:09.897 --> 08:15.962
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry kids, we were going to donate money to the orphanage, but now we actually have to sell the orphanage to pay for these fireworks.

08:16.063 --> 08:22.688
[SPEAKER_03]: You do have to wonder about a charity organization that spends all this money on that stuff.

08:22.788 --> 08:31.896
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I feel a little more for the handwritten in crayon on the poster board, support our school, I'm more about that stuff.

08:33.557 --> 08:34.518
[SPEAKER_11]: You're very grassroots.

08:35.143 --> 08:36.123
[SPEAKER_03]: I am very grassroots.

08:36.323 --> 08:37.344
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, look at this show.

08:38.664 --> 08:44.045
[SPEAKER_03]: Been going for eight years and still haven't been bought by the man yet.

08:45.966 --> 08:49.087
[SPEAKER_04]: Fireworks are not good just for the 4th of July.

08:49.607 --> 08:50.707
[SPEAKER_04]: He needs them all year round.

08:53.508 --> 08:54.988
[SPEAKER_12]: We had illegal ones.

08:56.109 --> 08:56.929
[SPEAKER_03]: Shame on you.

08:58.689 --> 09:00.470
[SPEAKER_03]: You had a party on the 3rd, right?

09:01.190 --> 09:02.490
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a block party.

09:02.811 --> 09:04.231
[SPEAKER_03]: So you did fireworks the night before?

09:04.770 --> 09:07.691
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I did the night after and the night after that and the night after that.

09:08.472 --> 09:12.594
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember one year I bought like $30, $40 worth of fireworks.

09:12.794 --> 09:13.614
[SPEAKER_03]: Fireworks.

09:13.654 --> 09:14.235
[SPEAKER_03]: Fireworks.

09:14.295 --> 09:14.775
[SPEAKER_03]: Work, work.

09:15.295 --> 09:15.695
[SPEAKER_03]: Fireworks.

09:15.735 --> 09:17.856
[SPEAKER_03]: And I brought them to one of Jamie's house parties.

09:17.976 --> 09:23.019
[SPEAKER_03]: But because there were so many fireworks here, they never got set off.

09:23.059 --> 09:24.700
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went home with a box of fireworks.

09:24.720 --> 09:25.720
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just funny how you're talking.

09:25.740 --> 09:26.000
[SPEAKER_03]: What a shame.

09:26.060 --> 09:27.061
[SPEAKER_03]: I could use them year round.

09:27.181 --> 09:27.541
[SPEAKER_03]: Year round.

09:27.981 --> 09:30.625
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually ended up using them the next year.

09:31.466 --> 09:32.728
[SPEAKER_03]: I sat on them for a whole year.

09:32.788 --> 09:34.391
[SPEAKER_12]: We had real metal sparklers too.

09:34.631 --> 09:34.932
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you?

09:35.533 --> 09:37.996
[SPEAKER_12]: And those little wizard things that go down the street.

09:39.278 --> 09:40.821
[SPEAKER_12]: And bottle rockets and...

09:41.343 --> 09:42.824
[SPEAKER_04]: The ground flowers are awesome.

09:58.979 --> 10:01.060
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe they're just really good about soliciting donations.

10:01.100 --> 10:01.860
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's a good point.

10:03.180 --> 10:04.381
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, wait.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.741
[SPEAKER_03]: They're good at soliciting donations.

10:07.241 --> 10:08.902
[SPEAKER_03]: Why sell the fireworks anyway?

10:09.342 --> 10:11.242
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the money donated.

10:11.603 --> 10:13.623
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt says, Rob, I am the man.

10:13.783 --> 10:14.683
[SPEAKER_03]: How much for the show?

10:15.083 --> 10:20.425
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, I invited Rob, and he didn't respond to it, talking about his party that he had, and he called me a dick.

10:21.265 --> 10:25.008
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, actually, I put myself down as a maybe.

10:25.948 --> 10:34.814
[SPEAKER_03]: For those that don't know, I yelled at SSJ100Matt last week because he called into the show saying he was having a 4th of July party and what classic game should they play and I said I didn't get an invite.

10:35.215 --> 10:37.836
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind I live in California and SSJ100Matt's in New York City.

10:38.337 --> 10:43.640
[SPEAKER_03]: So he did send me an invite on Facebook and I responded maybe because that's what you do to all the invites on Facebook.

10:43.660 --> 10:44.681
[SPEAKER_03]: You put yourself down as a maybe.

10:44.941 --> 10:47.023
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like there's going to be any fireworks there anyway.

10:47.503 --> 10:50.045
[SPEAKER_12]: I usually just say no and then when I show up it's a surprise.

10:52.697 --> 10:54.319
[SPEAKER_03]: Al-Qaeda Al-Qaeda Al-Qaeda

11:09.896 --> 11:11.237
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not a funny prank.

11:11.837 --> 11:12.978
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a hilarious prank.

11:13.138 --> 11:13.718
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not funny.

11:13.758 --> 11:15.619
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one that'll get you killed, but it's funny.

11:17.480 --> 11:29.206
[SPEAKER_03]: What about instead of something kind of hot button like that, you do like just this really like obscure charity organization like trying to launch a horse into space organization.

11:29.346 --> 11:29.946
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that's funny.

11:30.286 --> 11:32.087
[SPEAKER_12]: How about the people that are trying to build a Gundam?

11:33.746 --> 11:36.308
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know why it's not been done yet You get strippers

11:56.090 --> 11:57.031
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

12:22.725 --> 12:24.926
[SPEAKER_04]: They will clean out that fireworks stand.

12:24.966 --> 12:25.446
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

12:25.526 --> 12:25.806
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy.

12:26.066 --> 12:26.526
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about it.

12:26.586 --> 12:29.487
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's the stereotypical person that's going out to buy the fireworks?

12:29.727 --> 12:31.388
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, the older brother.

12:31.408 --> 12:32.448
[SPEAKER_03]: Men that want to blow stuff up.

12:32.468 --> 12:33.649
[SPEAKER_03]: Men that want to blow things up.

12:33.769 --> 12:34.349
[SPEAKER_03]: No offense, Jamie.

12:34.389 --> 12:35.389
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you want to blow things up, too.

12:35.449 --> 12:36.850
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think you'd have fun with strippers.

12:38.190 --> 12:40.851
[SPEAKER_03]: Strippers love... Here's another thing you need to keep in mind.

12:42.132 --> 12:44.613
[SPEAKER_03]: Strippers love other women.

12:45.113 --> 12:47.854
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll get way freakier with other women than they will with men.

12:48.194 --> 12:48.354
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

12:48.894 --> 12:49.854
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you're a gay man.

12:49.914 --> 12:51.395
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this from experience, sadly.

12:52.195 --> 12:55.197
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the whole point of threatening.

12:57.018 --> 12:58.900
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it has to do with the level of threat.

13:00.241 --> 13:05.304
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you, if you have a stand with a bounce house and you have a stand with strippers, I'm going with the stripper stand.

13:05.544 --> 13:07.305
[SPEAKER_02]: How about a stand with strippers and a bounce house?

13:09.011 --> 13:09.551
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

13:33.763 --> 13:45.154
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I've seen those bras hanging up to dry in there I'm like, oh my god A hamster could live in there Alright Actually What?

13:46.736 --> 13:53.763
[SPEAKER_03]: Four hamsters Alright, we love you DarkSakura and we love your breasts Tell us a little bit How was your gaming week?

13:53.783 --> 13:55.545
[SPEAKER_03]: You did get to do some games this week, right?

13:55.891 --> 13:57.933
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I played Star Trek Online.

13:59.414 --> 14:00.915
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's about it.

14:01.515 --> 14:02.376
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, no.

14:05.218 --> 14:07.339
[SPEAKER_12]: No, actually, I think that is all I played was Star Trek Online.

14:07.379 --> 14:11.682
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I made Captain, and then I took a little break.

14:11.943 --> 14:16.386
[SPEAKER_12]: And now I'm trying... I have this goal to reach Admiral by Tuesday morning.

14:16.926 --> 14:18.127
[SPEAKER_12]: And then go have my surgery done.

14:19.648 --> 14:22.931
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm at Captain 5 now.

14:23.471 --> 14:24.171
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I have...

14:26.229 --> 14:27.169
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

14:42.757 --> 14:44.159
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

14:59.498 --> 15:08.645
[SPEAKER_12]: Now the stuff that you actually can buy in the game, like right now they actually unlocked all of the pre-order bonuses that you can buy.

15:08.745 --> 15:09.666
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have everything now.

15:09.786 --> 15:12.688
[SPEAKER_12]: So you now can have a joint trail if you want to and I already paid.

15:13.408 --> 15:19.973
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I think I already paid about the equivalent anyway to have the joint trail because I got another... Anyway, long story.

15:20.694 --> 15:23.676
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um... I, um...

15:25.942 --> 15:26.763
[SPEAKER_12]: I've just been playing that.

15:26.983 --> 15:28.664
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have my... Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

15:28.844 --> 15:29.785
[SPEAKER_12]: I played Peggle.

15:29.805 --> 15:34.049
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of Peggle on my phone.

15:35.850 --> 15:36.310
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

15:36.351 --> 15:36.751
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

15:37.451 --> 15:39.393
[SPEAKER_03]: Any idea what you might play when you're down to one hand?

15:41.515 --> 15:44.757
[SPEAKER_03]: Well... Video game-wise?

15:47.820 --> 15:48.560
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always Peggle.

15:48.580 --> 15:49.101
[SPEAKER_02]: Peggle.

15:50.736 --> 15:52.457
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I could actually play Peggle with my phone.

15:53.278 --> 15:53.598
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

15:53.818 --> 16:01.804
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a good thing about the iPhone, though, is that I can actually do, like, I could, I think I could actually get away with playing S-Baluga.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.305
[SPEAKER_03]: You need an RPG.

16:03.325 --> 16:03.765
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

16:04.565 --> 16:06.207
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just loan you Final Fantasy XIII this week.

16:06.327 --> 16:07.588
[SPEAKER_03]: That way you have an RPG to play.

16:08.148 --> 16:10.469
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can talk about something besides Star Trek Online on this program.

16:10.489 --> 16:12.091
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was going to try to finish Blue Dragon.

16:12.171 --> 16:13.411
[SPEAKER_12]: I knew I forgot to bring something.

16:13.612 --> 16:16.153
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to try to finish Blue Dragon, but... Okay, well, there's that, too.

16:16.353 --> 16:17.434
[SPEAKER_12]: Final Fantasy XIII would be great.

16:17.854 --> 16:18.975
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm really looking forward to playing it.

16:19.395 --> 16:19.636
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

16:20.576 --> 16:49.802
[SPEAKER_03]: and um other than that we've been playing the get rid of shit game fun as you can tell by the state of this room i don't know it seems like look in the closet okay well yeah there's a lot less shit in there who's the who's the cartoony picture up there i don't that's the picture that tiara did for for me of characters okay they're characters i'm like these aren't people i know are they it's a cute picture but it's she does good stuff sorry isn't that awesome radio we're talking about pictures all right but i also hung up my my bat house collage

16:50.602 --> 16:50.903
[SPEAKER_03]: You did.

16:51.063 --> 16:51.543
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I did.

16:52.084 --> 16:55.227
[SPEAKER_12]: And I made this thing which I'm about to put on the board.

16:56.368 --> 16:58.230
[SPEAKER_03]: At least you can take a picture and put it on our website, right?

16:58.250 --> 16:59.190
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to put it on the website, yeah.

16:59.231 --> 16:59.811
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, there you go.

17:00.031 --> 17:02.193
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I felt crafty.

17:03.194 --> 17:06.357
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, let's... As in, I've not been working and I've been bored.

17:06.998 --> 17:07.318
[SPEAKER_09]: Bored.

17:07.999 --> 17:09.540
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's move on to Loki.

17:09.580 --> 17:10.301
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week?

17:11.372 --> 17:18.615
[SPEAKER_04]: My game week was interesting, I guess, because I had a lot of different things I played that I haven't really been playing a lot of.

17:20.816 --> 17:25.878
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, I went back and dusted off a few music games this week, including DJ Hero.

17:26.838 --> 17:31.380
[SPEAKER_04]: Went and played some of the new tracks in the Party Mix thing, including the Lady Gaga...

17:35.473 --> 17:37.855
[SPEAKER_04]: Girls on Film Remix Rock Band

17:56.871 --> 18:07.619
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried playing a little bit more on the medium setting because I was so used to Guitar Freaks and stuff and never really tried experimenting with playing any of the harder difficulties.

18:10.201 --> 18:17.846
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of like how Guitar Freaks, when they ramped up the difficulty, just had more notes on the three keys instead of adding just more keys to it.

18:18.027 --> 18:19.848
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of like that a little bit better.

18:20.488 --> 18:20.929
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um...

18:22.844 --> 18:25.005
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it was still fun.

18:25.925 --> 18:31.248
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, other than music games and stuff, I've been playing a lot of Crackdown 2.

18:32.268 --> 18:35.369
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, it's not that different from Crackdown 1.

18:35.910 --> 18:38.211
[SPEAKER_04]: Except they made leveling up a lot easier.

18:40.532 --> 18:42.993
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that it doesn't take as long, but...

18:44.301 --> 18:45.882
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't really have gangs this time.

18:45.942 --> 18:49.325
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just one big old gang that, you know, kind of attacks you everywhere.

18:49.405 --> 18:53.568
[SPEAKER_04]: And then at night you get these, like, zombie-like freaks or whatever that run around.

18:54.768 --> 18:57.110
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's so many of them and they're so easy to kill.

18:57.750 --> 19:05.036
[SPEAKER_04]: All you really have to do is, you know, like to level up your physical attack or whatever, you just keep hitting B over and over and over again.

19:05.516 --> 19:08.258
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just attacks all of them and you don't really take a lot of damage.

19:08.318 --> 19:11.040
[SPEAKER_04]: And say you do take a lot of damage, you just kind of jump out of the way and...

19:11.780 --> 19:15.901
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait until your health comes back and then go back down there and spam B some more.

19:16.781 --> 19:21.163
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this game's been getting a lot of shit in the reviews for being just like the first game.

19:22.243 --> 19:24.824
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that's fair to knock the game for that?

19:26.564 --> 19:27.124
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

19:27.704 --> 19:29.205
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very similar to the first game.

19:29.245 --> 19:32.346
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, it should be more like the first game than it is right now.

19:32.946 --> 19:36.607
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem I have with it is that basically it's...

19:38.087 --> 19:39.328
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

20:06.500 --> 20:28.759
[SPEAKER_04]: This one, though, is completely linear because, I mean, granted you can kind of run around and do different things, but they want you to hit up, you know, this one point first and you have to turn on these beacons and then once the beacons are charged up you go into kind of a protection mission almost where you have to protect the beacon from the freaks while it, you know, charges up to destroy all of them.

20:29.679 --> 20:35.284
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's good and all, but it's kind of boring because all the missions are very similar.

20:37.490 --> 20:42.551
[SPEAKER_04]: I just... I wish it was more like the first game where you had a bunch of gangs and you could kind of tackle it the way it is.

20:42.631 --> 20:45.472
[SPEAKER_04]: The city itself is almost identical to the first city.

20:45.892 --> 20:52.374
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they've got a lot of... Like, if you've played the first game, you'll definitely recognize a lot of landmarks in there, which is kind of cool.

20:52.734 --> 20:58.255
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the strongholds where these freaks are and stuff are actually where the old bosses were in the first game.

20:58.916 --> 20:59.116
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

21:00.456 --> 21:07.364
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of, it's a little sad that some of the stuff that made the first game so good is kind of taken out.

21:07.404 --> 21:11.969
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the vehicles that transform when your driving skills is up, those aren't there anymore.

21:12.049 --> 21:15.512
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, you just get actual different vehicles that have that stuff.

21:16.013 --> 21:20.758
[SPEAKER_04]: Or all the stuff that was from the download content, the different guns and whatnot are actually in the game.

21:20.798 --> 21:22.040
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to unlock them later on.

21:22.720 --> 21:29.246
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's harder for me to find these different points where you're supposed to be getting gear and stuff.

21:29.306 --> 21:33.169
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you have to choose your loadout and run around.

21:33.209 --> 21:40.395
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally you have to find the actual spots where you've captured spots on the map where you can get more ammo and stuff.

21:40.735 --> 21:46.301
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't matter anyways because these specialized guns that you have, you can't find ammo for them ever because the gang members don't carry them.

21:46.381 --> 21:50.506
[SPEAKER_04]: So once you've run out of your limited amount of ammo, you have to go just use their guns anyways.

21:51.086 --> 21:53.369
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt is also pointing out something that's missing.

21:53.709 --> 21:57.193
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like the first game, he says, minus a Halo beta packed in.

21:57.533 --> 21:59.475
[SPEAKER_03]: That's at chat.hornslaundry.com live.

22:00.676 --> 22:01.397
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

22:22.077 --> 22:23.238
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

22:37.554 --> 22:38.035
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

22:57.418 --> 22:58.819
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

23:21.258 --> 23:22.719
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hear that they're going to patch it.

23:22.819 --> 23:28.965
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to patch it to add this feature back because it is kind of important that it should be there.

23:29.525 --> 23:32.107
[SPEAKER_04]: That excuse is getting old from all these companies.

23:32.207 --> 23:33.689
[SPEAKER_03]: It is really old.

23:33.709 --> 23:37.191
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, we didn't finish the game in time because we needed to hit our release date.

23:37.632 --> 23:39.654
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll patch it to fix it.

23:40.134 --> 23:41.615
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole promises promises.

23:42.116 --> 23:43.617
[SPEAKER_04]: Blame the publishers most of the time.

23:44.983 --> 23:45.844
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

24:07.407 --> 24:08.068
[SPEAKER_04]: Lisa's Game.

24:08.088 --> 24:08.368
[SPEAKER_04]: You think?

24:08.729 --> 24:08.949
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

24:09.029 --> 24:11.152
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably where they'll be, somewhere you haven't looked.

24:11.572 --> 24:15.778
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep in mind, everything that you look for is always in the last place you looked.

24:16.866 --> 24:45.008
[SPEAKER_04]: so this game though does have an option where you can ping the orbs and actually see them on your map briefly so you can hit the up button on the directional pad and it'll actually ping the orbs to see where they're around so for example you're kind of looking for them and you are stuck with like two left you can ping it and see where it's at on your map and kind of give you a better idea where to zero in on it thank god for that but just like some of the other stuff that's in the game it's I don't know it's just very hard to get used to I guess

24:47.657 --> 24:55.123
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and the guy that's talking to you throughout the entire game, kind of announcing things, he's annoying.

24:55.563 --> 24:56.704
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't turn him off.

24:57.845 --> 24:58.506
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is annoying.

24:59.967 --> 25:02.689
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he's like, you should do these road races.

25:02.729 --> 25:04.571
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I don't want to do road races right now.

25:04.731 --> 25:06.332
[SPEAKER_04]: You should do these road races.

25:06.372 --> 25:08.114
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll give you more driving skill.

25:08.414 --> 25:10.576
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, there's a rooftop race you just walked by.

25:10.596 --> 25:11.676
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I don't care.

25:12.137 --> 25:16.460
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you should go to that beacon because it's not going to charge itself.

25:16.620 --> 25:17.341
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, stop

25:22.623 --> 25:24.023
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch out, there's freaks at night.

25:24.103 --> 25:24.343
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

25:24.443 --> 25:27.084
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't figure that out by spending the last 20 days in the game.

25:27.124 --> 25:29.725
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I can't figure out that the freaks come out at night.

25:30.485 --> 25:32.166
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, watch out, there's a stronghold over here.

25:32.226 --> 25:32.466
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

25:32.526 --> 25:33.687
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what that means on the map?

25:33.727 --> 25:35.927
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you've already told me that three times now.

25:36.607 --> 25:38.348
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just very annoying.

25:39.328 --> 25:40.969
[SPEAKER_04]: They should have an option to tick that off.

25:42.003 --> 25:47.910
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell you once when you're starting the game because they kind of do explain everything and then be done with it.

25:48.110 --> 25:51.054
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop bothering me with stuff unless it's actually important.

25:52.390 --> 25:53.831
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else with your Game of the Week, Loki?

25:55.593 --> 25:59.536
[SPEAKER_04]: Some DS stuff, because I was finishing up the trial stuff.

26:01.217 --> 26:11.906
[SPEAKER_04]: So I played Peggle DS, lots of Peggle Knights on there, and a little bit of Zelda Spirit Tracks, just going through the next dungeon where I got some sort of windmill-looking thing.

26:12.246 --> 26:13.627
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, by the way, that game just...

26:15.028 --> 26:21.511
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what it is with some of these Zelda games, but it pretty much seems like the whole dungeon is just a tutorial of how to figure out how to use this item.

26:21.731 --> 26:22.631
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

26:22.731 --> 26:24.252
[SPEAKER_04]: I figured out how to use the item.

26:24.292 --> 26:28.073
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't need to... Hey, look, you can do this puzzle with this.

26:28.173 --> 26:30.034
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hey, look, you can do this now.

26:30.734 --> 26:34.315
[SPEAKER_04]: Just give me the features that the item has and I'll figure the rest out.

26:34.355 --> 26:35.776
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't need to walk me through.

26:35.796 --> 26:38.577
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to hold my hand to figure out how to use this.

26:39.037 --> 26:43.339
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and fuck you, Nintendo, for making me blow on my DS to use this stupid item.

26:44.019 --> 26:45.179
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people don't want to do that.

26:45.919 --> 26:49.560
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because you have a microphone on there doesn't mean you have to use it for stupid shit like that.

26:50.600 --> 26:52.201
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you still on that jury duty thing?

26:52.401 --> 26:53.261
[SPEAKER_03]: Or did that finally finish?

26:54.981 --> 27:02.702
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm imagining you at the courthouse playing your DS just like very slyly having to go and your DS.

27:03.323 --> 27:05.203
[SPEAKER_04]: I did it in the hallway, but yeah.

27:05.563 --> 27:07.083
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we finished up with that.

27:09.404 --> 27:10.924
[SPEAKER_04]: The trial went on for eight days.

27:10.944 --> 27:11.464
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

27:11.604 --> 27:12.825
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, quickly, what was the trial?

27:12.845 --> 27:13.786
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're all dying to know.

27:14.006 --> 27:14.426
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it?

27:14.446 --> 27:15.847
[SPEAKER_04]: Give us all the details.

27:16.047 --> 27:17.188
[SPEAKER_04]: The trial went on for eight days.

27:17.248 --> 27:23.973
[SPEAKER_04]: It was this woman by the name of Julie Mayo who had gotten fired from a printing company in Sacramento here.

27:23.993 --> 27:25.214
[SPEAKER_04]: Which company?

27:25.234 --> 27:26.194
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they're probably hiring.

27:26.895 --> 27:28.136
[SPEAKER_04]: Pacific Standard Press.

27:28.716 --> 27:29.337
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I'm writing it down.

27:30.419 --> 27:34.443
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they seem like a nice company because they did have pretty much everybody on the witness stand.

27:35.624 --> 27:43.892
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyways, she got fired from there, but she's claiming that she got fired because of racial discrimination, because she was Caucasian.

27:44.432 --> 27:47.375
[SPEAKER_04]: She says that this woman by the name of Grace Schneider...

27:48.516 --> 27:51.258
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that Loki's putting all the details out there.

27:51.298 --> 27:52.138
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all public record now.

27:52.158 --> 27:53.939
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's all public record, but it's funny.

27:53.979 --> 28:00.983
[SPEAKER_04]: So this woman, Grace Schneider, who is a Filipino, supposedly called her a white bitch or a fucking white bitch.

28:01.743 --> 28:05.605
[SPEAKER_04]: And because of that, you know, American lithographers... I called my sister that once.

28:05.766 --> 28:06.486
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the difference?

28:06.506 --> 28:15.431
[SPEAKER_04]: Pacific Standard Press, or in this case, the company was at the time known as American Lithographers, basically was supposedly covering it up and all this stuff.

28:16.611 --> 28:24.893
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, oh, and because of that, she has suffered, you know, severe depression, agoraphobia, and post-traumatic stress disorder.

28:25.973 --> 28:37.275
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, by the way, when they were asking you the questions, you know, okay, before they were picking the jury and stuff like that, I was just like, because you can kind of get the impression of what this person is claiming is the problem.

28:37.295 --> 28:39.296
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're just like, what?

28:39.616 --> 28:40.596
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that doesn't make any sense.

28:41.196 --> 28:44.920
[SPEAKER_04]: So, throughout the whole trial, the plaintiff lawyer was completely retarded.

28:44.960 --> 28:48.123
[SPEAKER_04]: Reminded me of Andy Griffith in the Matlock role.

28:49.825 --> 28:55.511
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just guessing from the way you're describing this, this was a not guilty, or what would you call it?

28:55.571 --> 28:56.492
[SPEAKER_03]: Not liable, right?

28:56.832 --> 28:57.993
[SPEAKER_03]: The person who sued lost?

28:58.414 --> 28:59.314
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just guessing.

28:59.334 --> 28:59.655
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

29:04.297 --> 29:10.759
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so basically, this whole trial went on for eight days, and the plaintiff lawyer, he's just completely idiotic.

29:10.819 --> 29:12.760
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the worst lawyer I've ever seen.

29:14.160 --> 29:17.702
[SPEAKER_04]: After they finished the plaintiff's case, the defense only had to say was...

29:18.402 --> 29:19.003
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

29:43.977 --> 29:49.639
[SPEAKER_04]: We went over the questions twice, just to be sure.

29:49.719 --> 29:54.099
[SPEAKER_04]: But most of them were 12-0 in the favor of the defense.

29:55.840 --> 29:56.820
[SPEAKER_04]: It was sad.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.880
[SPEAKER_04]: We were just like, my God.

29:58.900 --> 30:00.441
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was down to like 3 o'clock.

30:00.861 --> 30:06.542
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we didn't get deliberations done by like 4.15, we would have to come back on Friday.

30:06.722 --> 30:07.842
[SPEAKER_04]: We're like, fuck that.

30:07.922 --> 30:09.082
[SPEAKER_04]: We are getting this done now.

30:09.563 --> 30:10.243
[SPEAKER_04]: Was she pissed?

30:12.103 --> 30:17.426
[SPEAKER_04]: She looked frustrated, annoyed, but she was crying and stuff throughout the whole trial.

30:18.046 --> 30:20.047
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't do that one at the end.

30:20.647 --> 30:27.310
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, but her lawyer, which wasn't really her lawyer, it was his partner came in when we had the verdict read.

30:28.030 --> 30:29.751
[SPEAKER_04]: He looked pissed.

30:30.371 --> 30:34.813
[SPEAKER_04]: And he did, of course, pull the jury, which we figured they would because we deliberated in ten minutes.

30:35.774 --> 30:38.195
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, whatever, I'm fucking done today.

30:39.416 --> 30:40.076
[SPEAKER_04]: You get nothing.

30:40.676 --> 30:43.738
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised you weren't playing Phoenix Wright in the hallway.

30:43.778 --> 30:45.699
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that would be ironic, but yeah.

30:45.860 --> 30:59.488
[SPEAKER_04]: No, she... It ended up that she was just a horrible worker and she got fired for very obvious reasons and it made no sense that she was claiming racial discrimination since the people that fired her were white.

30:59.808 --> 31:03.651
[SPEAKER_04]: She was replaced by a white woman and the majority of the company is white.

31:05.498 --> 31:06.519
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry I asked.

31:06.739 --> 31:08.061
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad.

31:08.501 --> 31:09.122
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to know.

31:09.262 --> 31:10.803
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, I had to know after two weeks ago.

31:10.963 --> 31:20.853
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and by the way, I did some research after the trial and she had also sued other people and she has an internet business which is doing a lot better than she claimed that it was doing.

31:21.613 --> 31:22.574
[SPEAKER_04]: So she's a lying bitch.

31:23.635 --> 31:26.178
[SPEAKER_04]: Allegedly.

31:26.858 --> 31:27.899
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need a trial for that.

31:28.820 --> 31:30.401
[SPEAKER_12]: I just totally hate people that do that crap.

31:30.861 --> 31:38.726
[SPEAKER_04]: The plaintiff lawyer kept calling his client Mr. instead of Mrs. He kept screwing up the gender of different people on the witness stand or whatever.

31:38.766 --> 31:39.627
[SPEAKER_04]: Kept repeating stuff.

31:39.907 --> 31:41.748
[SPEAKER_04]: He would fuck up their names all the time.

31:42.129 --> 31:46.732
[SPEAKER_04]: And he misspelled examining on his little board in his closing arguments.

31:47.172 --> 31:47.772
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awesome.

31:48.273 --> 31:48.853
[SPEAKER_03]: Video games.

31:48.913 --> 31:49.874
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to video games.

31:49.914 --> 31:50.214
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

31:50.434 --> 31:51.395
[SPEAKER_03]: Real life Phoenix Wright.

31:51.855 --> 31:53.756
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew, hey, you gonna try and follow that up?

31:53.796 --> 31:54.837
[SPEAKER_03]: What have you been playing this week?

31:56.598 --> 31:57.899
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot top that.

31:57.939 --> 31:58.439
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a little

31:58.919 --> 32:02.160
[SPEAKER_02]: Played a little bit of WoW and a lot of Left 4 Dead 2.

32:03.140 --> 32:09.301
[SPEAKER_02]: Towards the end of the Steam sale, a friend of mine gifted me Grand Theft Auto 4 for PC, so I was playing some of that.

32:09.621 --> 32:11.082
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

32:11.402 --> 32:13.842
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually made my system work for once.

32:17.083 --> 32:18.883
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've just been playing a whole lot of Left 4 Dead 2.

32:19.483 --> 32:20.544
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoy Ellis.

32:20.564 --> 32:21.384
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a motormouth.

32:22.684 --> 32:27.445
[SPEAKER_02]: And aside from that, my gaming week has been pretty boring.

32:28.982 --> 32:30.963
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

32:46.661 --> 32:47.001
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot.

32:47.642 --> 32:51.805
[SPEAKER_02]: I managed to restrain myself since my funding's a little tight.

32:52.445 --> 32:53.366
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I spent about $30, $35.

32:54.247 --> 32:58.690
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought Flat Out Ultimate Carnage for $2.

32:58.970 --> 32:59.290
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

33:00.311 --> 33:03.433
[SPEAKER_02]: Left 4 Dead 2 for $20, and I was pissed when they dropped it down to $10.

33:03.474 --> 33:06.236
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like playing the stock market.

33:06.556 --> 33:07.857
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone gifted me GTA 4.

33:08.097 --> 33:08.938
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's nice.

33:09.338 --> 33:15.683
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got one other game, and I can't remember what it was, but I think I spent in total about $30.

33:15.723 --> 33:15.863
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

33:16.516 --> 33:17.496
[SPEAKER_11]: This game is great.

33:17.536 --> 33:18.497
[SPEAKER_11]: It's called Blood Bowl.

33:19.657 --> 33:22.398
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's Warhammer Sports.

33:22.598 --> 33:23.778
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, I think that's hilarious.

33:24.339 --> 33:26.119
[SPEAKER_02]: It is hilarious, every single bit of it.

33:26.539 --> 33:29.540
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me transition into my week a little bit, and I'll talk about what I bought on Steam.

33:29.820 --> 33:36.562
[SPEAKER_03]: I was gifted the Civ IV Complete Collection for my birthday, because that went down to about, I think it was like $10 at one point, so I got that as a gift, which was awesome.

33:36.863 --> 33:40.124
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did play a little bit of Civ IV this week, got back into Crackalization.

33:40.784 --> 33:42.064
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried, I tried.

33:42.224 --> 33:44.145
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's fun, but it's a lot...

33:45.326 --> 34:11.586
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly think the console versions of Civilization as much as they're hated by some of the core Civ community I think they are really good entry level games so like if you've never played a Civ game before maybe start with the console ones but I don't think the PC ones are that inaccessible they've got good tutorials but I played that a little bit Team Fortress 2 I finally bought I played that a little bit but man I am horrible at first person shooters I was sucking in the tutorial levels it's sad

34:11.926 --> 34:18.710
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, if it was hard before, it's a clusterfuck now that they've pushed the engineer update.

34:19.150 --> 34:19.610
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no.

34:20.231 --> 34:25.654
[SPEAKER_02]: Now engineers can pick up, carry, and set down their sentries.

34:26.775 --> 34:33.839
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the server I was testing it on, I played for two hours, nine engineers on ten-man teams.

34:33.859 --> 34:34.279
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wow.

34:34.679 --> 34:36.060
[SPEAKER_02]: And the tenth man was a spy.

34:36.500 --> 34:37.741
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie and I still have to have our match.

34:37.901 --> 34:38.982
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't get around to that.

34:39.322 --> 34:39.843
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we didn't.

34:39.903 --> 34:40.823
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still learning how to play.

34:41.044 --> 34:43.345
[SPEAKER_12]: See, I would probably play a team of all scouts.

34:43.546 --> 34:46.568
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll have to be after the hand thing.

34:46.748 --> 34:48.589
[SPEAKER_12]: Just because they have the best taunts.

34:49.090 --> 34:52.212
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's one thing that kind of, and maybe you know this, Drew.

34:52.593 --> 34:54.254
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, I didn't spend a lot of time with it.

34:54.714 --> 34:56.936
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't get my 360 controller to work right with it.

34:57.196 --> 34:59.197
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I do something wrong or does it not really work?

35:00.097 --> 35:02.918
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually never tried using a controller for Team Fortress 2.

35:03.199 --> 35:09.921
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I am very against the idea of using a console controller to play a first-person shooter.

35:10.362 --> 35:10.742
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

35:10.922 --> 35:11.742
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing wrong with it.

35:11.882 --> 35:13.303
[SPEAKER_02]: It's personal taste.

35:13.343 --> 35:14.823
[SPEAKER_02]: I find a mouse to be more precise.

35:15.023 --> 35:16.764
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of those great internet debates.

35:16.784 --> 35:23.267
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep in mind, when we were all playing Final Fantasy XI, I was playing with a controller.

35:24.192 --> 35:26.074
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that game was designed for the PS2, really.

35:26.474 --> 35:33.321
[SPEAKER_12]: But I could, you know, break out all my macros like that and people were like, why are you using a controller?

35:34.182 --> 35:41.509
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to say I bought this real quick because it's awesome, even though I didn't get a chance to touch it this week, but I bought the complete XCOM collection for like five bucks.

35:42.691 --> 35:44.332
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted the old school XCOM games.

35:44.452 --> 35:47.273
[SPEAKER_02]: I never had the chance to play through those, but I heard they were good.

35:47.353 --> 35:47.793
[SPEAKER_02]: They're good.

35:48.033 --> 35:49.654
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to play them later.

35:49.674 --> 35:50.254
[SPEAKER_11]: Space Harrier.

35:50.935 --> 35:51.255
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

35:51.635 --> 35:52.635
[SPEAKER_03]: Other games I played this week.

35:52.675 --> 35:54.736
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I played Warcraft because I always fucking play Warcraft.

35:54.756 --> 35:55.637
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want to talk about some other games.

35:56.097 --> 35:57.497
[SPEAKER_03]: LOL Random Game of the Week.

35:57.817 --> 36:00.539
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Star Wars The Force Unleashed.

36:01.019 --> 36:02.399
[SPEAKER_03]: That game's only about, what, two and a half years old?

36:02.459 --> 36:03.500
[SPEAKER_03]: I finally got around to playing it this week.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.804
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the other game I bought.

36:06.844 --> 36:08.365
[SPEAKER_02]: Star Wars Empire at War.

36:08.526 --> 36:10.867
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, I'm glad I could help jog your memory there.

36:11.428 --> 36:24.018
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I played The Force Unleashed, which you might remember the talk about this one because this was the one where Soul Calibur IV had Yoda, Darth Vader, and then The Apprentice, who's also known as Starkiller.

36:24.498 --> 36:26.460
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was his game, was The Force Unleashed.

36:26.500 --> 36:29.903
[SPEAKER_03]: Although you start the game playing as Vader, which I thought was kind of cool.

36:29.943 --> 36:30.283
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like...

36:30.663 --> 36:32.085
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

36:51.604 --> 36:52.084
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

37:10.450 --> 37:14.433
[SPEAKER_03]: The mechanic seemed to be a lot of fling things around.

37:14.493 --> 37:15.954
[SPEAKER_03]: Fling this and fling that.

37:16.754 --> 37:18.075
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also a really hard game.

37:19.817 --> 37:22.578
[SPEAKER_03]: I died within five minutes when I first started.

37:22.598 --> 37:25.480
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, whoa, I gotta approach this a little differently than I've been doing.

37:25.640 --> 37:28.182
[SPEAKER_03]: LucasArts games have never been particularly forgiving.

37:28.683 --> 37:30.904
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would not say it's a bad game by any means.

37:30.944 --> 37:32.405
[SPEAKER_03]: It was neat.

37:32.745 --> 37:35.007
[SPEAKER_03]: I think especially if I was more of a... See, I'm more of a Trekkie.

37:35.167 --> 37:38.869
[SPEAKER_03]: Hate me if you want, but... I think if I was more into Star Wars, I would probably...

37:39.830 --> 37:40.611
[SPEAKER_03]: Really like this.

37:41.051 --> 37:42.892
[SPEAKER_03]: And I liked it enough as it is.

37:42.952 --> 37:43.372
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cool.

37:43.672 --> 37:47.775
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, granted, it's a little old now, but you can probably get it cheap if you're a budget gamer.

37:48.475 --> 37:50.776
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I can't get it cheaper than it was at the time.

37:50.796 --> 37:50.997
[SPEAKER_02]: It was $7.50.

37:55.479 --> 37:57.281
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

38:17.105 --> 38:23.870
[SPEAKER_03]: Puzzle Quest 2 is sort of the LOL Galactrix didn't really happen kind of game because remember there actually was already a Puzzle Quest 2.

38:24.891 --> 38:29.634
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Puzzle Quest 2 back to swords and magic and sorcery type of game.

38:30.115 --> 38:37.100
[SPEAKER_03]: But I noticed right off the bat, and this actually threw me for a loop, they kind of did away with the world map in the first game.

38:37.220 --> 38:39.281
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's more of this isometric...

38:40.242 --> 38:40.842
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

39:02.978 --> 39:03.839
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

39:19.138 --> 39:19.699
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

39:38.375 --> 39:40.016
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

40:03.943 --> 40:18.716
[SPEAKER_03]: and as you level up Iron Knuckles you can either use a sword or a shield depending on your class or possibly a poison if you're an assassin I think sorcerers do like magic or mana pool regeneration things

40:19.136 --> 40:21.418
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sort of like a wild card depending on your class.

40:21.538 --> 40:22.759
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of like that mechanic.

40:22.819 --> 40:24.700
[SPEAKER_03]: It really adds an interesting twist to it.

40:25.140 --> 40:30.204
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really the biggest change between Puzzle Quest 1 and 2 in regards to how the game works.

40:30.664 --> 40:37.128
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's another thing you should also know is that now the size of the board will change depending on what you're battling.

40:37.168 --> 40:40.731
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes you battle these big bears and there's a huge board to go with it.

40:41.131 --> 40:41.891
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kind of like that.

40:41.911 --> 40:43.873
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes some squares will remain inaccessible.

40:44.513 --> 40:48.496
[SPEAKER_03]: There are still some mini games like picking locks, bashing down doors.

40:49.616 --> 40:54.740
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are all pretty much give or take the variations on Bejeweled you've seen before.

40:55.160 --> 41:09.270
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, does anyone remember an Xbox Live game, and I think this is on Facebook and stuff too, called Jewel Quest, where the goal wasn't to match three in a row, but was to make every square on the board gold by matching a piece on that square?

41:09.370 --> 41:10.110
[SPEAKER_11]: I think so.

41:10.290 --> 41:14.313
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that is the Search the Room minigame in Puzzle Quest 2.

41:14.773 --> 41:18.155
[SPEAKER_03]: So lots of little variations that you're kind of used to seeing.

41:19.496 --> 41:47.005
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was neat I enjoyed it and I played a hell of a lot of it so I think that says something about it and you know for 15 bucks on Xbox Live it's a pretty good deal 30 bucks on the DS so not sure what that's all about well I do it costs more to make a cartridge than it does to push something digitally but I could see where the allure of being able to take it with you would be but I'll probably try to play a little bit more on Xbox Live I need to because you know how well I'm doing on my Beat 3 games goal

41:48.506 --> 41:49.166
[SPEAKER_03]: I've beaten zero.

41:50.047 --> 41:50.947
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe I'll beat this one.

41:50.967 --> 41:51.267
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

41:52.828 --> 41:54.649
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, you guys ready to get into some gaming news?

41:55.870 --> 41:56.711
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess.

41:56.731 --> 41:57.091
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally.

41:57.111 --> 41:58.772
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me do some housekeeping real quick here.

42:00.593 --> 42:01.954
[SPEAKER_03]: Join us on our Facebook, please.

42:02.534 --> 42:04.595
[SPEAKER_03]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

42:04.635 --> 42:05.796
[SPEAKER_03]: You can join our community there.

42:05.876 --> 42:08.418
[SPEAKER_03]: We post news when the shows are coming out and so forth.

42:09.298 --> 42:10.139
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also on Twitter.

42:10.239 --> 42:16.623
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter.com slash OLR and you can always interact with us by sending us stories and we do consider those throughout the week for inclusion in the show.

42:17.464 --> 42:19.006
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even going to plug Myspace anymore.

42:19.546 --> 42:20.648
[SPEAKER_03]: Is anyone here using Myspace?

42:20.688 --> 42:20.948
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone?

42:21.149 --> 42:22.911
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone in chat using Myspace?

42:23.051 --> 42:24.173
[SPEAKER_03]: My butt.

42:25.054 --> 42:25.775
[SPEAKER_03]: I should just delete it.

42:27.489 --> 42:28.049
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

42:49.898 --> 42:59.143
[SPEAKER_02]: If you browse GameFAQs, I'll try to leave notes about Orange Lounge Radio's next shows up on the current events message board.

42:59.623 --> 43:00.324
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's awesome.

43:00.464 --> 43:00.864
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

43:01.264 --> 43:03.766
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen people put it in their signatures and stuff too, and I love that.

43:03.806 --> 43:05.707
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so generous of folks to do.

43:06.107 --> 43:06.607
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the wiki

43:23.587 --> 43:25.228
[SPEAKER_12]: Have people actually updated stuff?

43:26.128 --> 43:30.489
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few dedicated, like Dark Tetsuya, AJ Mix, and I think I've seen a few others.

43:30.509 --> 43:34.771
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very dedicated, and they're very good generals of the oil army for keeping that stuff up to date.

43:35.311 --> 43:37.071
[SPEAKER_03]: But it could use more.

43:37.811 --> 43:40.012
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping people... Crack on it.

43:40.112 --> 43:40.652
[SPEAKER_12]: Get to it.

43:42.273 --> 43:43.153
[SPEAKER_03]: We need other contributors.

43:43.193 --> 43:43.433
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

43:44.113 --> 43:45.534
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, a comment in our chat room.

43:45.594 --> 43:47.474
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft says, nobody uses MySpace anymore.

43:47.514 --> 43:48.255
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's how I felt.

43:48.655 --> 43:49.075
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I felt.

43:49.934 --> 43:53.676
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into some actual gaming news here and talk about what's going on in the gaming world.

43:54.016 --> 43:54.516
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what's up?

43:55.216 --> 43:57.577
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is kind of interesting.

43:57.677 --> 44:05.340
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be kind of changing up how people look at Xbox Live Arcade.

44:06.240 --> 44:13.863
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, it reminds me a little bit of the PlayStation Network, kind of, what they're doing.

44:14.783 --> 44:16.483
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Destination Arcade.

44:16.963 --> 44:21.084
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a visual browser of the Xbox Live Arcade stuff.

44:21.544 --> 44:30.266
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a bunch of different things on there, including you can check out the new arrivals, check out some of the new stuff, actually just browse through titles.

44:30.806 --> 44:36.787
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have recommendations based off of different purchases.

44:38.128 --> 44:39.028
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of neat stuff.

44:40.868 --> 44:44.170
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, kind of a way to maybe see some better screenshots.

44:44.430 --> 44:50.733
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, they have this all kind of now, but they're making, I guess, a little bit easier to view.

44:51.073 --> 44:57.516
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know with a lot of the titles that are out there now, it may make it a little difficult to browse for what you're looking for.

44:57.536 --> 45:00.037
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially, God, if you were looking for indie games.

45:00.978 --> 45:03.939
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really difficult to find now.

45:04.739 --> 45:05.940
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope this includes indie games.

45:06.340 --> 45:10.725
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was going to say, have we heard anything about the indie games and the incorporation of that?

45:10.905 --> 45:11.026
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

45:13.496 --> 45:13.836
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

45:14.437 --> 45:22.604
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, I mean, if they're doing this with Xbox Live Arcade and the indie games are almost like Xbox Live Arcade stuff, I don't see why they couldn't include it.

45:23.124 --> 45:34.294
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we haven't heard a lot about this next patch in general, and usually there's a lot of fanfare about what's coming up in these big, you know, it used to be biannual, now it's just, what, annual?

45:34.414 --> 45:35.615
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know how often they do it.

45:35.655 --> 45:37.096
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's kind of like whatever they feel like, isn't it?

45:37.116 --> 45:37.957
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still biannual.

45:37.997 --> 45:40.319
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, this dashboard update...

45:42.040 --> 45:43.500
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not even that.

45:43.580 --> 45:44.821
[SPEAKER_04]: That was just another update.

45:45.641 --> 45:50.162
[SPEAKER_04]: This update, actually, with the visual browser is supposed to be happening, I believe, this month.

45:50.502 --> 45:50.822
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

45:51.422 --> 45:54.223
[SPEAKER_04]: So, any week now.

45:54.523 --> 45:55.963
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it should be coming soon.

45:58.543 --> 46:01.404
[SPEAKER_03]: Have they said anything else about what else we might see implemented?

46:01.444 --> 46:06.165
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my assumption is that all this Kinect stuff is probably the big thing that's going to be in it, but...

46:06.962 --> 46:11.787
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think the Kinect stuff is actually going to be in there until it actually comes out on the 4th.

46:11.807 --> 46:20.215
[SPEAKER_04]: If anything, I would guess that we're going to get that patch pushed to us probably either, I'd say the end of October is when we're going to see the Kinect patch.

46:20.235 --> 46:21.916
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll kind of unlock all that stuff.

46:25.480 --> 46:27.261
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I mean, it looks interesting.

46:27.441 --> 46:31.145
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess there'll be, I don't know, we'll have to check out when it actually comes out.

46:33.117 --> 46:41.231
[SPEAKER_04]: it's nice I guess but honestly I've never had a problem finding stuff on Xbox Live Arcade but I can see where you might if you don't know what you're looking for

46:42.123 --> 46:52.227
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft seems to say in our chatroom here, I'm just kind of summarizing what he's saying, that this whole new interface seems a lot like the Rock Band store, the Guitar Hero store, and the Music Shop.

46:52.927 --> 46:56.769
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't used those in a while because I haven't really been buying download content.

46:56.849 --> 46:58.089
[SPEAKER_04]: I've used the Rock Band one before.

46:58.209 --> 46:59.770
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't used it in a while either, but I've used it before.

46:59.790 --> 47:04.331
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I haven't used it, let's say, in Xbox Live.

47:04.491 --> 47:06.532
[SPEAKER_04]: I've used it in Rock Band 2.

47:07.753 --> 47:09.373
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot different on Xbox Live.

47:09.433 --> 47:11.014
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like this whole standalone app.

47:11.914 --> 47:29.629
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can listen to clips and everything without having to actually launch the game which is interesting but what's also weird is that it shows up in your played games history I think it's really just a mini game in a way, I don't know if that makes sense but I think that's how Xbox kind of recognizes it as a miniature free game if you will

47:32.131 --> 47:35.035
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft also hits us with another good comment here.

47:35.055 --> 47:40.842
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.OrangeLauncher.com says, I think they won't add the indie games since they aren't available outside the US and other countries.

47:41.323 --> 47:42.744
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'll only be for arcade stuff.

47:42.764 --> 47:44.226
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand why they wouldn't be out.

47:44.647 --> 47:46.188
[SPEAKER_04]: They really should open it up to everybody.

47:46.849 --> 47:50.614
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the other features that you can do in this is you can actually recommend games for friends.

47:52.249 --> 47:59.955
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, I thought, now I realize Actdeft is in Mexico, so maybe that is true about Mexico, but I thought Japan had the indie games too, because aren't there some indie games being made over there?

48:00.136 --> 48:06.541
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there's some Japanese indie games that are on the service already, so I assumed that they were in those regions as well.

48:06.701 --> 48:10.465
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just kind of outside of the big regions where you're not seeing this.

48:10.565 --> 48:14.008
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I say big regions, I say Japan, US, UK, basically.

48:14.648 --> 48:15.029
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

48:15.269 --> 48:15.389
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

48:16.593 --> 48:22.938
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, we'll see what happens with this store when it launches or whenever we get a patch date.

48:23.178 --> 48:23.639
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

48:23.999 --> 48:27.462
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, did you know that there's a game called Justin Bieber Revenge?

48:28.382 --> 48:28.743
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

48:29.063 --> 48:33.727
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there's actually a video game called Justin Bieber Revenge.

48:33.847 --> 48:38.430
[SPEAKER_03]: And I imagine that Justin Bieber just takes out an Uzi into that crowd of screaming fangirls.

48:38.791 --> 48:41.953
[SPEAKER_12]: I found a game going through apps real quick that I have to share off topic.

48:42.294 --> 48:43.895
[SPEAKER_12]: Vuvuzela vs. Zombies.

48:46.681 --> 48:48.922
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see Justin Bieber vs. Vuvuzela.

48:49.823 --> 48:58.007
[SPEAKER_04]: The other day when I was driving home, I saw a guy with one of those blowing it out the window of his car.

48:58.027 --> 49:00.409
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, what the hell?

49:00.689 --> 49:02.270
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, it's all the rage, I guess.

49:03.550 --> 49:11.575
[SPEAKER_03]: Destined to become, you know, when they have the I Love the 2010, you know, many years from now, snarky B-list comics commenting on the Vuvuzela.

49:12.526 --> 49:14.868
[SPEAKER_03]: Take that Vuvuzela and shove it up your butt.

49:15.929 --> 49:18.191
[SPEAKER_03]: It just sounds like... It'd probably improve the sound.

49:18.452 --> 49:18.992
[SPEAKER_03]: God.

49:19.733 --> 49:20.734
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here it is.

49:21.154 --> 49:22.275
[SPEAKER_03]: Justin Bieber Revenge.

49:22.355 --> 49:25.859
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, what it really is... You heard of Tap Tap Revenge on the App Store, right?

49:26.359 --> 49:28.501
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Tap Tap Revenge has all these spin-off games.

49:28.902 --> 49:35.488
[SPEAKER_03]: Lady Gaga Revenge, Dave Matthews Band Revenge, and... Nickelback Revenge.

49:37.492 --> 49:54.899
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that should go the other way around Nickelback should not be having revenge on me I should be having revenge on Nickelback for being on the radio or Justin Bieber here's the thing I don't listen to radio stations that play Justin Bieber but unfortunately Nickelback is crap the only time I've ever seen him was when I was waiting for more comedy in Saturday Night Live

49:55.619 --> 49:56.220
[SPEAKER_04]: Disney.com.

50:21.638 --> 50:24.439
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, Disney bought Tapulous.

50:24.859 --> 50:33.503
[SPEAKER_03]: So now they are a part of Disney Interactive Media, which is interesting because we've seen kind of more and more from Disney Interactive Media come out in the past couple years.

50:33.543 --> 50:36.164
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Split Second, Tron is coming out soon.

50:36.504 --> 50:38.465
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little more than just the kiddie games.

50:40.526 --> 50:40.966
[SPEAKER_03]: Predator.

50:42.086 --> 50:42.927
[SPEAKER_04]: Turok was Disney Tap Tap Revenge

51:03.098 --> 51:04.239
[SPEAKER_03]: It's... whatever.

51:04.299 --> 51:11.322
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just an... I've played the game and it's like one of those things that's... Oh yeah, and Black Wolf points out a good one that's important.

51:11.402 --> 51:15.024
[SPEAKER_03]: Epic Mickey, which is a very different direction for the Disney franchise, is also there.

51:15.604 --> 51:16.904
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really when you look at it.

51:17.084 --> 51:17.345
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

51:18.485 --> 51:26.212
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have been if they had kept it to its original wonder awesomeness with all the really twisted shit.

51:26.633 --> 51:31.497
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the end, it's going to be as twisted as the Alice in Wonderland movie was.

51:31.517 --> 51:34.259
[SPEAKER_03]: There's definitely a dark side to it.

51:34.720 --> 51:35.500
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark-sided?

51:36.121 --> 51:36.942
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a little bit of that.

51:37.142 --> 51:37.763
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me put it this way.

51:38.443 --> 51:43.548
[SPEAKER_04]: The equivalent of what Epic Mickey should have been and what it's going to be, it would be like...

51:44.148 --> 51:53.855
[SPEAKER_04]: If the original Epic Mickey is like American McGee's Alice versus what it's going to be is like Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland.

51:53.915 --> 51:55.336
[SPEAKER_02]: Kill the mouse, take his house.

51:55.376 --> 51:56.457
[SPEAKER_02]: Kill the mouse, take his house.

51:57.978 --> 51:58.199
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

51:59.820 --> 52:02.442
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it was supposed to be with Oswald going nuts.

52:02.962 --> 52:03.262
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

52:03.663 --> 52:03.983
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

52:05.764 --> 52:07.585
[SPEAKER_03]: Oswald's in the thing, right?

52:07.645 --> 52:10.347
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but he's not as nuts, apparently.

52:10.888 --> 52:12.269
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have been, you know...

52:13.633 --> 52:14.534
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they need to do.

52:14.654 --> 52:16.915
[SPEAKER_03]: American McGee's, you know, Epic Mickey.

52:18.236 --> 52:21.518
[SPEAKER_03]: AJ Mix in our chatroom actually says the game used to be called Tap Tap Revolution.

52:21.698 --> 52:23.680
[SPEAKER_03]: Going back to this whole Tap Tap Revenge thing.

52:23.960 --> 52:29.023
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, just kind of like a little aside, apparently like Step Mania is now on the iPhone.

52:29.224 --> 52:29.744
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you hear that?

52:29.804 --> 52:30.925
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, I did.

52:30.965 --> 52:32.326
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's Tap Mania.

52:32.986 --> 52:42.733
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, what's really weird about it, like, and I haven't played with the app, so I don't fully understand how this works, but apparently you can load MP3s into the app.

52:44.093 --> 53:11.831
[SPEAKER_03]: but not via the iTunes interface which I can't believe Apple approved that like there seems to be something there like and again I haven't had hands on with it but apparently you can load your own mp3s and step files into this app and that doesn't seem to be something that usually Apple's very supportive of unless it's they're just claiming to do that via like the smzips format or something like that where you can just zip up the whole file and just throw it in there

53:12.891 --> 53:15.432
[SPEAKER_04]: with the steps and the backgrounds and all that fun stuff.

53:15.692 --> 53:16.592
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

53:16.652 --> 53:19.553
[SPEAKER_03]: Blackwolf is saying that it was a homebrew app back in the day.

53:19.653 --> 53:20.934
[SPEAKER_03]: It even worked with your own music.

53:20.994 --> 53:22.754
[SPEAKER_03]: People submitted note charts and it was awesome.

53:23.074 --> 53:25.095
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the app store came out and they went all legit.

53:25.115 --> 53:26.015
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess that's a history.

53:26.055 --> 53:32.957
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now you've got Tapmania is, I guess, the rogue renegade tap-tap revenge or whatever.

53:34.608 --> 53:35.709
[SPEAKER_04]: But does anybody care?

53:35.909 --> 53:42.453
[SPEAKER_03]: All I can say is that apps in general effing suck on my 3G now, ever since iOS 4 came out.

53:42.473 --> 53:45.514
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought iOS 4 was going to be awesome, but it really slowed down the 3G.

53:46.355 --> 53:48.036
[SPEAKER_12]: Mine's been pretty awesome.

53:48.456 --> 53:49.597
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have a 3GS.

53:50.057 --> 53:54.860
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always been my impression of the iPhone, is it was supposed to be awesome, but it just sucked.

53:55.599 --> 53:56.940
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, can we move on?

53:57.380 --> 53:59.862
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Apple, hey, you can even take that back to Apple.

54:00.082 --> 54:03.004
[SPEAKER_03]: Disney bought Tap Revenge, people.

54:03.104 --> 54:05.045
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what comes of that in the future.

54:05.406 --> 54:07.927
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just waiting for Jonas Brothers Revenge.

54:08.007 --> 54:08.508
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't wait.

54:09.388 --> 54:09.809
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't wait.

54:09.989 --> 54:11.270
[SPEAKER_03]: Miley Cyrus Revenge.

54:11.710 --> 54:12.230
[SPEAKER_03]: Goody, goody.

54:12.510 --> 54:13.631
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you got for us, DarkSakra?

54:14.332 --> 54:23.078
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, this is something that has been on the mind of many a World of Warcraft and StarCraft II player about the real ID.

54:23.258 --> 54:23.758
[SPEAKER_12]: Here we go!

54:24.038 --> 54:24.318
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

54:26.384 --> 54:29.849
[SPEAKER_12]: and this news comes from Geek Life, plug, plug.

54:30.891 --> 54:31.973
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Geek Dash Life.

54:32.033 --> 54:32.634
[SPEAKER_03]: That's important.

54:32.954 --> 54:35.297
[SPEAKER_03]: What's Geek Life without the dash take you to?

54:35.598 --> 54:35.938
[SPEAKER_03]: Porn?

54:36.539 --> 54:37.060
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

54:37.180 --> 54:37.661
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna look.

54:38.662 --> 54:39.724
[SPEAKER_03]: But the dash is important.

54:42.573 --> 54:56.196
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, there's a certain thing that happened after one of the forum moderators revealed his name and someone managed to basically put out all of his personal information out in plain view.

54:56.996 --> 54:59.077
[SPEAKER_12]: So they said, yeah, we're not going to do that on the forum.

54:59.237 --> 54:59.557
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

55:00.917 --> 55:01.177
[SPEAKER_12]: Oops.

55:01.517 --> 55:01.877
[SPEAKER_12]: Our bad.

55:02.397 --> 55:04.618
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine for everyone else, just not us.

55:06.687 --> 55:08.890
[SPEAKER_04]: I use the official Star Trek Online ones.

55:19.383 --> 55:21.023
[SPEAKER_03]: Tech support, but it's World of Warcraft.

55:21.083 --> 55:22.003
[SPEAKER_03]: It should never be broken.

55:22.144 --> 55:27.124
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Geek Life is like a podcast or something, but their site's kind of ugly.

55:27.164 --> 55:27.885
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, no offense.

55:27.925 --> 55:29.245
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just very disorganized.

55:29.345 --> 55:30.845
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, but Geek-Life is great.

55:31.005 --> 55:31.505
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, it is.

55:31.565 --> 55:32.325
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fantastic.

55:32.445 --> 55:35.346
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've started doing a blog on there now called Tales from the Vault.

55:35.526 --> 55:35.626
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

55:35.646 --> 55:37.206
[SPEAKER_12]: Which will be mirrored on Orange Island.

55:37.266 --> 55:39.867
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to rant, so let's get through this story because I'm ready to rant.

55:39.887 --> 55:42.367
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I said everything while you were looking up the other sites.

55:42.427 --> 55:43.267
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I was curious.

55:43.868 --> 55:46.208
[SPEAKER_03]: Believe me, I have been closely following...

55:46.548 --> 55:48.149
[SPEAKER_03]: What's been going on with this whole real ID thing?

55:48.169 --> 55:49.390
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to find you, Rob.

55:49.410 --> 55:50.051
[SPEAKER_09]: Just have it, Rob.

55:50.071 --> 55:50.431
[SPEAKER_03]: They will.

55:50.631 --> 55:51.212
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

55:51.512 --> 55:52.733
[SPEAKER_03]: The forums, okay?

55:53.353 --> 55:54.394
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously it was a bad idea.

55:54.774 --> 55:58.717
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, you do have to post there for tech support sometimes and if you want to contact the GMs.

55:58.737 --> 55:59.298
[SPEAKER_03]: You know why?

55:59.578 --> 56:05.583
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when you call Blizzard, you're going to wait on hold for 45 minutes if you can even get through at all.

56:06.243 --> 56:08.024
[SPEAKER_03]: Trolls don't care and it will give them more ammo.

56:31.881 --> 56:37.108
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to get rid of 7 eighths of your posters, at least, by doing that.

56:37.128 --> 56:38.731
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, why do you want to shoot yourself in the foot?

56:39.091 --> 56:41.014
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you want to do advertising on your forums someday?

56:41.034 --> 56:42.676
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got it.

56:42.696 --> 56:43.778
[SPEAKER_03]: They still do advertising.

56:43.878 --> 56:44.338
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

56:45.180 --> 56:48.284
[SPEAKER_02]: It cuts down on bandwidth cost if you lose most of your forum users.

56:49.502 --> 56:50.263
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the genius.

56:50.303 --> 56:50.843
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the genius.

56:50.863 --> 56:51.664
[SPEAKER_02]: They're fucking Blizzard.

56:51.784 --> 56:53.525
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't need to cut back on that.

56:53.625 --> 56:57.688
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, they're running a computer game with 11 million people subscribing.

56:57.988 --> 57:02.011
[SPEAKER_03]: And soon, a huge game that's going to just turn Korea upside down.

57:02.411 --> 57:04.193
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're going to have Diablo 3.

57:04.253 --> 57:06.114
[SPEAKER_03]: Lord knows what's going to happen with that.

57:06.194 --> 57:08.215
[SPEAKER_03]: And isn't Blizzard... They have the bandwidth, Drew.

57:08.256 --> 57:11.918
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't Blizzard a company that they can just make up a mount and just sell it for $25?

57:12.018 --> 57:13.940
[SPEAKER_04]: And people are like, oh, we got a new mount!

57:14.020 --> 57:15.301
[SPEAKER_04]: Sparkle ponies!

57:15.661 --> 57:16.521
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty sick.

57:16.622 --> 57:18.383
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, now, if they had sparkle ponies...

57:18.703 --> 57:19.824
[SPEAKER_03]: They do have Sparkle Ponies!

57:20.064 --> 57:20.745
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I still didn't play.

57:20.965 --> 57:23.627
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well I was going to say, that was a couple months ago.

57:23.667 --> 57:25.029
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, we were promised a pony.

57:25.049 --> 57:25.589
[SPEAKER_03]: $25 Sparkle Ponies.

57:25.889 --> 57:26.370
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, look.

57:26.930 --> 57:27.471
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

57:27.911 --> 57:29.372
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the forum thing was dumb.

57:29.973 --> 57:34.056
[SPEAKER_03]: There were people that were like, yay, no more trolls on the forum, yay, yay.

57:34.117 --> 57:37.980
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's kind of like, okay, well now you can just sit there and talk to yourself, I suppose.

57:38.861 --> 57:41.503
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think the official forums are that bad.

57:42.043 --> 57:44.285
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yes, there's trolls, but...

57:45.802 --> 57:47.843
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, where on the internet aren't there trolls?

57:47.903 --> 57:51.044
[SPEAKER_03]: There's trolls in the reviews for Orange Lounge Radio on iTunes.

57:51.264 --> 57:52.885
[SPEAKER_03]: There's trolls everywhere, you guys.

57:53.145 --> 58:05.090
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand how it's going to cut down on trolls because say I have my real name up there, you know, whether my name is like, you know, Troll Guy or, you know, Matt, I can still troll people.

58:05.211 --> 58:07.632
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, look, they're not doing it anymore.

58:07.672 --> 58:07.852
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

58:08.812 --> 58:12.897
[SPEAKER_02]: Try hanging out on the roleplay forums and tell me there aren't more trolls.

58:13.438 --> 58:15.761
[SPEAKER_02]: Now how in the F are you supposed to roleplay with your real name?

58:16.081 --> 58:16.542
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

58:17.183 --> 58:18.945
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, that's the death knell.

58:18.965 --> 58:19.966
[SPEAKER_03]: That was dumb.

58:20.006 --> 58:21.148
[SPEAKER_03]: That was going to be massive.

58:21.528 --> 58:24.432
[SPEAKER_02]: They already had a replacement site set up for everyone to go to.

58:24.652 --> 58:25.033
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, look.

58:26.254 --> 58:31.960
[SPEAKER_03]: We could talk about the Blizzard employee who got cyber-stalked when he put his real name out there and they spilled all the data.

58:32.300 --> 58:34.082
[SPEAKER_03]: Bottom line is they didn't go through with it.

58:34.182 --> 58:34.803
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

58:34.943 --> 58:37.345
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes about as much sense as a whole LifeLock dude.

58:37.445 --> 58:39.968
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not going to go back into the pros and cons of the forums.

58:40.028 --> 58:44.692
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is what I really want to make sure people understand because there's a lot of misinformation out there.

58:45.273 --> 58:46.134
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

59:14.233 --> 59:20.757
[SPEAKER_03]: This whole Blizzard already did a dumb thing and they're just making it even dumber is the only thing that got pulled back.

59:20.977 --> 59:26.700
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything I said in my rant two weeks ago, you know what changed from all that stuff I ranted about two weeks ago?

59:27.621 --> 59:31.083
[SPEAKER_03]: About the whole friends of friends, about the whole your last name is in the game.

59:31.343 --> 59:33.564
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how much of that changed with this announcement?

59:34.225 --> 59:34.765
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

59:35.466 --> 59:35.946
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

59:37.216 --> 59:47.762
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that that CEO mentioned was that they're not going to implement something they thought about implementing when almost 50,000 people replied on that thread before it got officially released.

59:47.942 --> 59:58.888
[SPEAKER_02]: I have seen administrator posts on the forums and such saying that they're looking to close some security holes in the Real ID system so you wouldn't be able to see friends of friends and such.

59:58.948 --> 59:59.729
[SPEAKER_02]: They're working on it.

01:00:00.209 --> 01:00:11.191
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is testament to the fact that if you complain loud enough, often enough, and in great enough number, you can generally rattle the company into doing what's right.

01:00:11.752 --> 01:00:13.612
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet, Bobby Kotick still has a job.

01:00:14.192 --> 01:00:19.333
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Bobby Blackwolf thinks I'm blaming him because he was one of those people that posted about all that.

01:00:19.753 --> 01:00:21.294
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Bobby, I'm not picking on you.

01:00:21.354 --> 01:00:22.094
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm picking on...

01:00:22.774 --> 01:00:24.675
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:00:49.235 --> 01:00:51.056
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's some people that don't want to hear all this reality stuff.

01:00:51.076 --> 01:00:54.879
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, that would be awesome for stalking celebrities in the game.

01:00:55.759 --> 01:00:56.840
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they wouldn't post on the forums.

01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:57.861
[SPEAKER_04]: But here, here's the thing.

01:00:58.201 --> 01:00:59.622
[SPEAKER_03]: But aren't their names going to be in the game?

01:00:59.722 --> 01:00:59.942
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you?

01:01:00.923 --> 01:01:01.423
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's gone.

01:01:01.523 --> 01:01:01.923
[SPEAKER_03]: That's gone.

01:01:02.604 --> 01:01:03.224
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing, though.

01:01:03.304 --> 01:01:04.285
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing that's important.

01:01:06.107 --> 01:01:06.967
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:01:32.839 --> 01:01:45.809
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there is a rogue add-on out there that wants to insert, and already there's been these false reports and false photoshops and things of this line of code being in popular mods such as Gearscore and Deadly Boss mods.

01:01:45.849 --> 01:01:50.392
[SPEAKER_03]: Luckily those are all bullshit, but what is not bullshit is the fact that the code is out there and it works.

01:01:50.632 --> 01:01:51.893
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, the hole's been closed.

01:01:51.913 --> 01:01:52.854
[SPEAKER_03]: It was hot fixed on the 10th.

01:01:53.496 --> 01:01:55.458
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:02:14.495 --> 01:02:22.600
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, and what's to say there won't be a three-line code or a five-line code that is soon to come out that's also going to exploit this information?

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:29.084
[SPEAKER_03]: My point is, Blizzard has been selling this thing as opt-in and opt-in, and a lot of people that are advocating for this as opt-in.

01:02:29.405 --> 01:02:35.449
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this little exploit that happened this week, patched or not, showed that the system is not opt-in.

01:02:36.229 --> 01:02:36.549
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

01:02:53.567 --> 01:02:56.810
[SPEAKER_03]: You're opting in because they've opted you in to this wonderful feature.

01:02:56.850 --> 01:03:00.192
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now I realize Battle.net wants to get in bed with Blizzard.

01:03:01.233 --> 01:03:02.013
[SPEAKER_03]: They are in bed with Blizzard.

01:03:02.234 --> 01:03:05.076
[SPEAKER_03]: Battle.net wants to get in bed with Facebook so, so badly.

01:03:05.476 --> 01:03:06.157
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the thing.

01:03:06.637 --> 01:03:09.599
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what Facebook is getting a lot of shit over right now.

01:03:10.019 --> 01:03:14.483
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's that movie coming out about Facebook, and they really don't make them look like nice people.

01:03:14.523 --> 01:03:15.884
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen the trailers for the –

01:03:16.104 --> 01:03:17.325
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it looks awesome.

01:03:31.172 --> 01:03:36.156
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be another website, and everyone will migrate to that website.

01:03:36.196 --> 01:03:41.159
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me quickly finish my thought here, and that is that it's not an opt-in program, it's an opt-out program.

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:47.024
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you are believing that it's opt-in, this whole thing that happened this week should tell you different.

01:03:47.524 --> 01:03:49.345
[SPEAKER_03]: and you might be thinking, I don't play WoW.

01:03:49.485 --> 01:03:50.285
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't give a shit.

01:03:50.665 --> 01:03:54.307
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you're going to play StarCraft 2 or Diablo 3, this will apply to you.

01:03:54.847 --> 01:03:58.949
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's not forget, how many MMOs have knocked off WoW at this point?

01:03:59.269 --> 01:04:03.871
[SPEAKER_03]: How many video games in general have knocked off Diablo and StarCraft and Blizzard at this point?

01:04:03.911 --> 01:04:04.891
[SPEAKER_03]: Dangerous precedent.

01:04:05.211 --> 01:04:07.332
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is a highly dangerous precedent.

01:04:07.592 --> 01:04:08.953
[SPEAKER_03]: So you may not care now...

01:04:09.753 --> 01:04:12.457
[SPEAKER_03]: But ask yourself, if this were your favorite game, would you care?

01:04:12.678 --> 01:04:17.926
[SPEAKER_02]: They might change the definition of opt-in to be, you opt-in by playing our game.

01:04:19.448 --> 01:04:23.575
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what, I have to say this, that if they did it on Star Trek Online, I would quit.

01:04:25.183 --> 01:04:25.483
[SPEAKER_12]: I would.

01:04:25.903 --> 01:04:27.544
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a dangerous precedent that they're setting.

01:04:27.904 --> 01:04:29.444
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's hope they do the right thing.

01:04:29.484 --> 01:04:36.286
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hope they allow you to mask your last name, allow you to have the handle, at least hide that friends of friends stuff.

01:04:37.246 --> 01:04:42.147
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish my real name was on Grand Theft Auto because I'd fucking love everybody to know that I'm kicking their ass.

01:04:43.508 --> 01:04:45.628
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I'm ranked 58 now in the world.

01:04:45.848 --> 01:04:47.569
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love this comment from Toa Gak in chat.

01:04:47.649 --> 01:04:49.329
[SPEAKER_03]: Real ideas is secure as the Wii.

01:04:49.649 --> 01:04:49.969
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

01:04:49.989 --> 01:04:51.990
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's your real name out there, folks.

01:04:52.030 --> 01:04:52.650
[SPEAKER_03]: Your real name.

01:04:53.650 --> 01:05:00.073
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when I signed up for WoW four years ago, I assumed that the name I was giving them was for billing and information purposes.

01:05:00.133 --> 01:05:00.654
[SPEAKER_03]: I had no idea.

01:05:00.674 --> 01:05:01.894
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what the agreement said.

01:05:01.994 --> 01:05:03.955
[SPEAKER_03]: No idea that this was going to be the result of it.

01:05:03.995 --> 01:05:04.956
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I can't change my name.

01:05:05.716 --> 01:05:09.798
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have signed up with my internet name and my internet trail Rob Roberts if I knew that in the beginning.

01:05:10.058 --> 01:05:15.801
[SPEAKER_12]: This is what actually I'd like to see happen is I'd really like to see, you know, an organized boycott.

01:05:17.873 --> 01:05:18.614
[SPEAKER_12]: Hit them where it hurts.

01:05:41.417 --> 01:05:44.440
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't put it past them that they did it on purpose knowing that would happen

01:06:04.804 --> 01:06:06.086
[SPEAKER_02]: I love their game.

01:06:06.686 --> 01:06:09.749
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd prefer it to remain a game.

01:06:09.830 --> 01:06:11.171
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so hard, Jamie.

01:06:11.331 --> 01:06:12.132
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a social network.

01:06:12.152 --> 01:06:16.877
[SPEAKER_03]: I really love that game and I have so many friends that I interact with and play it with.

01:06:16.897 --> 01:06:17.938
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll still be your friends.

01:06:18.138 --> 01:06:21.262
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but it's just... I can't explain it.

01:06:22.459 --> 01:06:23.360
[SPEAKER_12]: I know what you mean.

01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:25.121
[SPEAKER_12]: Trust me, I played Ragnarok for how long?

01:06:25.161 --> 01:06:25.482
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

01:06:25.842 --> 01:06:29.385
[SPEAKER_12]: And I quit Ragnarok when they started doing shit I didn't agree with.

01:06:29.445 --> 01:06:35.471
[SPEAKER_12]: And I played in the beta, like the first... Actually, I played part from the alpha.

01:06:36.252 --> 01:06:38.134
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's how long I've been with Ragnarok online.

01:06:38.154 --> 01:06:40.356
[SPEAKER_12]: And when they started doing crap I didn't like, I quit.

01:06:41.176 --> 01:06:42.896
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not opposed to quitting.

01:06:43.076 --> 01:06:44.477
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, ask Alan.

01:06:45.017 --> 01:06:47.377
[SPEAKER_03]: I really kind of had a long chat with him about it.

01:06:47.417 --> 01:06:49.838
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, I was paid through the 14th.

01:06:50.258 --> 01:06:53.458
[SPEAKER_03]: So I said, I'm going to wait and see if Blizzard changes their mind by the 14th.

01:06:53.838 --> 01:06:56.079
[SPEAKER_03]: And sure enough, the scale back happened.

01:06:56.119 --> 01:06:58.199
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, okay, well, now they're moving in the right direction.

01:06:58.259 --> 01:07:01.180
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm kind of like at that point where I'm like, well, let's see what happens.

01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:03.120
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is an expansion coming out.

01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:07.181
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they're going to want my $40 for the expansion, I want it to be an expansion I want.

01:07:07.381 --> 01:07:16.294
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think that there comes a point and this is something that people in the gaming community need to realize there comes a point when you basically sacrifice your ideals for entertainment

01:07:18.497 --> 01:07:23.339
[SPEAKER_03]: Ramakun in chat says Sky, all of this is coming from Activision.

01:07:23.419 --> 01:07:25.220
[SPEAKER_03]: They're pushing for this, not Blizzard.

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:27.040
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care where it's coming from.

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:29.401
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks.

01:07:29.441 --> 01:07:31.922
[SPEAKER_03]: In the end, I don't really care who the boycott is hurting.

01:07:31.982 --> 01:07:35.963
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's not something I believe in, then I'm not opposed to quitting.

01:07:36.123 --> 01:07:38.864
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if that's correct, then it means Blizzard is starting to push back.

01:07:41.305 --> 01:07:42.626
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what I'll tell you will happen.

01:07:43.806 --> 01:07:45.487
[SPEAKER_03]: I might stick with WoW for now.

01:07:46.636 --> 01:07:51.562
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's two MMOs coming out this fall that I am very interested in.

01:07:51.782 --> 01:07:54.285
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy XIV and DC Universe.

01:07:54.466 --> 01:07:56.148
[SPEAKER_12]: You're supposed to play Star Trek Online with me.

01:07:56.188 --> 01:07:59.412
[SPEAKER_03]: And at some point I'm supposed to squeeze Star Trek Online in there too.

01:07:59.712 --> 01:08:01.234
[SPEAKER_12]: You can quit and play with me.

01:08:01.354 --> 01:08:02.836
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not paying for four MMOs.

01:08:03.717 --> 01:08:04.939
[SPEAKER_12]: So quit World of Warcraft and play with me.

01:08:06.363 --> 01:08:06.763
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

01:08:07.104 --> 01:08:11.007
[SPEAKER_12]: You can play with all of my really cool new friends in my fleet.

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:15.310
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, I promised that I would give them a plug, and I'm going to.

01:08:16.551 --> 01:08:17.652
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, go ahead.

01:08:18.433 --> 01:08:23.277
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to give my... Although they're probably mostly all asleep because they're all in the UK.

01:08:23.477 --> 01:08:24.518
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course they are.

01:08:24.578 --> 01:08:25.439
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course they are.

01:08:25.879 --> 01:08:27.601
[SPEAKER_12]: The independent United Fleet.

01:08:27.961 --> 01:08:29.342
[SPEAKER_12]: They are super cool people.

01:08:30.123 --> 01:08:31.003
[SPEAKER_12]: And, well, there's a couple.

01:08:31.224 --> 01:08:34.106
[SPEAKER_12]: There's one from Hawaii and one from New York, I think, so...

01:08:36.213 --> 01:08:37.472
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not the only American there!

01:08:38.661 --> 01:09:06.754
[SPEAKER_03]: one more thing I want to say on Real ID and boycotting WoW and all that here's another thing to consider is that again this isn't just about Warcraft I am really looking forward to Diablo 3 I really like Diablo 2 and I really really want to play Diablo 3 so that's another reason I kind of want Blizzard to do the right thing here because realize that if I have to quit WoW because of this if Blizzard takes it a step further in the wrong direction and I end up quitting WoW over this I'm going to have to quit Diablo 3 as well

01:09:07.094 --> 01:09:10.976
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, well, it's not the same, but you could always have Torchlight.

01:09:11.016 --> 01:09:12.317
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have Torchlight, and it's great.

01:09:12.677 --> 01:09:15.138
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, there's the Torchlight MMO to look forward to next year.

01:09:15.178 --> 01:09:16.959
[SPEAKER_03]: I suppose there's a... We'll always have Torchlight.

01:09:17.119 --> 01:09:20.841
[SPEAKER_12]: SSG100Map backs me up that you can play Star Trek Online with me and Travis.

01:09:22.142 --> 01:09:22.602
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

01:09:22.662 --> 01:09:27.925
[SPEAKER_03]: Travis will do nothing but dare me to do dumb shit in Star Trek Online, just like he does on Twitter.

01:09:27.945 --> 01:09:31.807
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no real way that you can do dumb shit on Star Trek Online.

01:09:31.927 --> 01:09:33.008
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that sounds like a challenge.

01:09:35.354 --> 01:09:39.878
[SPEAKER_12]: Run without armor into a horde of Klingons and watch them kick you in the face.

01:09:39.958 --> 01:09:42.400
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's not forget my first character.

01:09:42.561 --> 01:09:47.746
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was in the beta, my character's name was Captain Sassy of the USS O'Girl.

01:09:50.734 --> 01:09:52.195
[SPEAKER_03]: Captain America is not named Jack, he's Steve.

01:10:16.954 --> 01:10:17.495
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on.

01:10:17.535 --> 01:10:23.540
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to move on to other gaming stories, but real quick, thank you guys who have kind of bared with my hatred of Real ID over the past couple weeks on this show.

01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:28.565
[SPEAKER_03]: I know not everybody's into WoW and all that, but remember, I just want to remind you guys, precedent.

01:10:29.186 --> 01:10:32.389
[SPEAKER_03]: This could have a huge effect on online gaming as we know it.

01:10:32.509 --> 01:10:34.931
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, imagine if Xbox Live required it, your real name.

01:10:35.132 --> 01:10:36.533
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you stick with Xbox Live?

01:10:37.714 --> 01:10:38.554
[SPEAKER_03]: Just throwing it out there, guys.

01:10:38.574 --> 01:10:39.555
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on.

01:10:39.595 --> 01:10:40.675
[SPEAKER_03]: Completely new topic.

01:10:40.695 --> 01:10:43.617
[SPEAKER_12]: There's actually something that Bobby just said in chat that I think is amazing.

01:10:43.657 --> 01:10:43.937
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

01:10:43.957 --> 01:10:44.377
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead and read it.

01:10:44.397 --> 01:10:48.679
[SPEAKER_12]: To draw a parallel, he said, first they came for the WoW people, and I said nothing for I don't play WoW.

01:10:48.879 --> 01:10:54.582
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he said something similar on his Twitter this week about the whole thing, and I think that's a great little analogy.

01:10:54.762 --> 01:11:03.666
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, for anyone who don't know, in the last thing, it's like finally they came for me, and there was no one to say anything for me.

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:05.207
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that...

01:11:06.207 --> 01:11:10.429
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's like you're saying this is going to set a precedent and it's time to stop it in its tracks.

01:11:11.309 --> 01:11:13.650
[SPEAKER_12]: And I still say everyone should quit.

01:11:14.050 --> 01:11:16.151
[SPEAKER_03]: Surezo in chatroom says, it's okay, Rob.

01:11:16.971 --> 01:11:18.532
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranting on WoW is okay with me.

01:11:18.912 --> 01:11:20.212
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's the thing, though, guys.

01:11:20.432 --> 01:11:23.414
[SPEAKER_03]: There were a lot of people on Twitter when I said I was so frustrated with this.

01:11:23.434 --> 01:11:26.435
[SPEAKER_03]: They were like, yay, quit WoW, quit WoW, it's stupid, blah, blah, blah.

01:11:27.315 --> 01:11:28.156
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:11:44.613 --> 01:11:45.814
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

01:12:06.244 --> 01:12:09.847
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's hard to just say, oh, quit.

01:12:10.767 --> 01:12:13.389
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you are saying goodbye to all your friends when you do that.

01:12:13.449 --> 01:12:16.131
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also understand it's just a game.

01:12:16.211 --> 01:12:20.194
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the end of the day, if you believe in something that strongly, then you need to walk away.

01:12:20.274 --> 01:12:22.176
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is what I will do if...

01:12:24.017 --> 01:12:24.817
[SPEAKER_03]: and Push Comes to Show.

01:12:24.877 --> 01:12:34.280
[SPEAKER_12]: If this makes you feel better, Rob, I still keep up with at least four of the people from the free server that I played on in Ragnarok Online and back from the old school days.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:37.621
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep in mind that I quit, what, six years ago?

01:12:38.901 --> 01:12:41.782
[SPEAKER_12]: I still keep up with at least three people from there.

01:12:42.982 --> 01:12:47.123
[SPEAKER_03]: Luckily, most of the people I play with I already know in real life, but there are a few.

01:12:47.183 --> 01:12:49.004
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple that were listeners of the show.

01:12:49.363 --> 01:12:49.503
[SPEAKER_03]: Segue!

01:12:49.523 --> 01:12:49.703
[SPEAKER_03]: Segue!

01:13:04.858 --> 01:13:06.779
[SPEAKER_03]: We're coming to the PSP, real ID.

01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:10.722
[SPEAKER_04]: It affects nobody.

01:13:12.583 --> 01:13:14.184
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, apparently this is great.

01:13:14.564 --> 01:13:16.865
[SPEAKER_04]: Great planning on Sony's part.

01:13:17.165 --> 01:13:19.107
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotta love their forethought in this.

01:13:20.027 --> 01:13:25.232
[SPEAKER_04]: iPad, PSP, and Invisibles may not support the PSP Go in North America.

01:13:27.194 --> 01:13:38.464
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, these games do require the PlayStation Portable Camera, which would have plugged into the USB port on the top of the 3000, 2000, 1000 models.

01:13:41.827 --> 01:13:49.012
[SPEAKER_04]: You may remember, though, that the PSP Go does not have that port on top of its system.

01:13:49.413 --> 01:13:58.620
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, they have some sort of an adapter or converter cable that is released in Japan to be able to use that kind of stuff.

01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:00.841
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not coming out over here.

01:14:03.003 --> 01:14:03.863
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

01:14:05.734 --> 01:14:07.475
[SPEAKER_04]: PSP Go is a big fucking flop.

01:14:29.324 --> 01:14:31.045
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a big fucking flop, and you know why?

01:14:31.065 --> 01:14:32.285
[SPEAKER_03]: But Sony can't say that.

01:14:32.485 --> 01:14:33.406
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course they can.

01:14:33.426 --> 01:14:34.306
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony can't say that.

01:14:34.486 --> 01:14:35.766
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know why it's a big fucking flop?

01:14:36.087 --> 01:14:39.328
[SPEAKER_04]: Have they done any more bundles to try to promote the PSP Go?

01:14:39.428 --> 01:14:39.588
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

01:14:39.868 --> 01:14:42.969
[SPEAKER_04]: The last bundle that came out was a PSP 3000 with Metal Gear Solid.

01:14:42.989 --> 01:14:47.091
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another bundle coming out with Madden.

01:14:47.951 --> 01:14:51.192
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be another bundle coming out, I think, for Kingdom Hearts.

01:14:51.692 --> 01:14:53.633
[SPEAKER_04]: Notice all those are with PSP 3000s.

01:14:53.993 --> 01:14:56.054
[SPEAKER_04]: They are not with the PSP Go.

01:14:57.941 --> 01:15:26.004
[SPEAKER_04]: so is that sort of Sony's way of declaring it dead without declaring it dead well just like they're still willing to say that the UMD format is awesome for movies that it was a successful format I mean they're just they're never willing to admit defeat despite the fact that defeat might be you know very obvious much like the court case I was in for the last three weeks are these games themselves you think are going to be any good

01:15:28.422 --> 01:15:28.562
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

01:15:28.963 --> 01:15:32.608
[SPEAKER_03]: It seemed like for a while there, the PSP had all these pretty cool games coming out on it.

01:15:32.648 --> 01:15:35.593
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, is it just me or are things slowing down on that front?

01:15:36.846 --> 01:15:40.889
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like everything that's on the PSP right now is just ports of PS3 games.

01:15:41.009 --> 01:15:42.231
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, you know, okay.

01:15:42.851 --> 01:15:43.412
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand.

01:15:43.672 --> 01:15:45.293
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to port a lot of stuff to handheld.

01:15:45.754 --> 01:15:46.274
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes sense.

01:15:46.715 --> 01:15:51.499
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, the PSP hasn't had a lot of original stuff, right?

01:15:51.599 --> 01:15:55.783
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there was the Final Fantasy fighting game, but that's the last one I can think of.

01:15:56.864 --> 01:15:58.046
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a pretty good, like what?

01:15:58.146 --> 01:15:59.887
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations, you've won, Jamie.

01:16:00.468 --> 01:16:01.389
[SPEAKER_12]: I hate those things.

01:16:02.662 --> 01:16:03.302
[SPEAKER_04]: But you've won.

01:16:03.742 --> 01:16:06.843
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be congratulated.

01:16:07.743 --> 01:16:08.624
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see here.

01:16:09.004 --> 01:16:12.245
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's been some good exclusive PSP games.

01:16:12.285 --> 01:16:14.125
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of it's like niche RPG stuff.

01:16:14.725 --> 01:16:20.567
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the occasional first party Sony title, which is like a God of War title or something like that.

01:16:21.307 --> 01:16:24.888
[SPEAKER_04]: Motorstorm, Arctic, whatever the hell they call it.

01:16:27.049 --> 01:16:27.850
[SPEAKER_04]: They're okay.

01:16:28.931 --> 01:16:34.397
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, even they're decent, but it's just not like you're not getting really good third-party titles.

01:16:34.437 --> 01:16:39.962
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Metal Gear Solid is going to be pretty good, but just there's not a lot of them out there.

01:16:40.023 --> 01:16:40.243
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

01:16:42.469 --> 01:16:43.330
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:04.382
[SPEAKER_04]: EyePet, Invisibles, if you really had a PSP Go, I don't think you're going to be too sad about that.

01:17:04.402 --> 01:17:13.565
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, really, EyePet, you know, an augment of reality game where you raise a little pet, I don't think a lot of people that own the PSP Go give a shit.

01:17:14.145 --> 01:17:22.648
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Invisibles, you know, a game that's kind of like Monster Rancher, but, you know, you take pictures of stuff and, you know, based on the picture you get these little animals or whatever.

01:17:23.909 --> 01:17:23.989
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh...

01:17:25.493 --> 01:17:50.139
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't give a shit about that either that's just like saying oh it's so sad that we didn't have the GPS function for some game like they had one for one of the golf games where you could go and get information about golf courses and stuff like that if you took your PSP with you nowadays if you want that kind of crap you have an iPhone or an iPod or something like that

01:17:50.919 --> 01:17:51.420
[SPEAKER_03]: Any phone that has apps.

01:18:16.039 --> 01:18:21.385
[SPEAKER_03]: This is coming from Ryuji Yamada in a newspaper report in the Wall Street Journal.

01:18:21.666 --> 01:18:24.589
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the president of NTT Dokomo Inc.

01:18:24.910 --> 01:18:27.373
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the biggest wireless carrier in Japan.

01:18:27.914 --> 01:18:30.317
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the company that had the cool Gatchaman commercials.

01:18:30.397 --> 01:18:30.637
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it

01:18:30.697 --> 01:18:31.538
[SPEAKER_03]: Video Game Makers

01:18:56.076 --> 01:19:01.640
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, I mean, gosh, the 3G in an iPad makes it, what, $120 more expensive?

01:19:02.981 --> 01:19:11.126
[SPEAKER_03]: I think these will be certain versions of these types of hardware, but I don't think you're going to see this in the first phase of the 3DS, but certainly there could be a later phase.

01:19:11.566 --> 01:19:18.291
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like the DSi came out later on, there'll probably be a 3DSi phone or something like that coming out.

01:19:18.811 --> 01:19:21.813
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, in a way, isn't the iPhone kind of the big competitor right now?

01:19:22.791 --> 01:19:23.891
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

01:19:24.712 --> 01:19:28.593
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it or not, the iPhone and iPad are handheld gaming systems right now.

01:19:31.853 --> 01:19:34.634
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't buy that, though.

01:19:34.734 --> 01:19:40.736
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I understand if you put out a lot of games on a platform, I guess we can call it a gaming platform.

01:19:41.576 --> 01:19:42.816
[SPEAKER_04]: The PC is a gaming platform.

01:19:42.836 --> 01:19:44.557
[SPEAKER_04]: There's tons of games on there.

01:19:45.417 --> 01:19:48.998
[SPEAKER_04]: And just because a lot of people buy them, I mean, I guess it's just...

01:19:51.786 --> 01:19:55.248
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm trying to say is people that buy Apple products are very sheepish.

01:19:56.228 --> 01:19:58.449
[SPEAKER_04]: Um... Bah?

01:19:59.870 --> 01:20:00.110
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

01:20:01.511 --> 01:20:09.434
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually sat and compared the stats between that and the BlackBerry and honestly I've used a bunch of different ones and I like my iPhone.

01:20:11.475 --> 01:20:17.538
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, clearly the reason why a lot of people have it is because it's actually a good product.

01:20:17.638 --> 01:20:21.180
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, I do believe in the rule of thumb, wait until the second generation...

01:20:22.665 --> 01:20:25.626
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, have you seen this YouTube that's been floating around this week?

01:20:25.646 --> 01:20:27.026
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's really, really funny.

01:20:27.086 --> 01:20:29.787
[SPEAKER_03]: And look, I am an Apple fan too, and I want an iPhone 4.

01:20:30.087 --> 01:20:32.248
[SPEAKER_03]: But this YouTube was so freaking funny.

01:20:33.448 --> 01:20:34.348
[SPEAKER_06]: How may I help you?

01:20:34.749 --> 01:20:35.349
[SPEAKER_06]: iPhone 4.

01:20:36.049 --> 01:20:36.949
[SPEAKER_06]: Where is the iPhone 4?

01:20:37.929 --> 01:20:38.930
[SPEAKER_06]: I need an iPhone 4.

01:20:39.410 --> 01:20:42.511
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm very sorry, but we are currently sold out.

01:20:43.191 --> 01:20:46.872
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we did finally get some more HTC EVOS in.

01:20:47.212 --> 01:20:47.392
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

01:20:48.052 --> 01:20:48.653
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that?

01:20:49.373 --> 01:20:50.093
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it an iPhone?

01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:52.952
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it is that 4G phone on Sprint.

01:20:53.272 --> 01:20:55.273
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's not an iPhone, why would I want it?

01:20:55.593 --> 01:20:58.716
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's similar to an iPhone, but has a bigger screen.

01:20:59.116 --> 01:20:59.736
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

01:21:00.076 --> 01:21:02.878
[SPEAKER_01]: The internet speeds are around three times faster.

01:21:03.198 --> 01:21:03.819
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

01:21:04.179 --> 01:21:07.341
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a higher resolution camera on both the front and the back.

01:21:07.681 --> 01:21:08.302
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

01:21:08.682 --> 01:21:12.084
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't require you to be on Wi-Fi to use video chat.

01:21:12.364 --> 01:21:12.985
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

01:21:13.345 --> 01:21:16.567
[SPEAKER_01]: Its battery is replaceable, as is the memory card.

01:21:16.887 --> 01:21:17.508
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

01:21:17.848 --> 01:21:24.169
[SPEAKER_01]: It is highly customizable, everything from the widgets to the icons, the fonts and even has video wallpaper.

01:21:24.509 --> 01:21:25.129
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

01:21:25.469 --> 01:21:26.850
[SPEAKER_01]: The monthly bill is cheaper.

01:21:27.190 --> 01:21:27.830
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

01:21:28.170 --> 01:21:29.310
[SPEAKER_01]: It fucking prints money.

01:21:29.710 --> 01:21:30.330
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

01:21:30.690 --> 01:21:35.111
[SPEAKER_01]: It can grant up to three wishes, even if one of those wishes is for an iPhone.

01:21:35.471 --> 01:21:36.091
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

01:21:36.451 --> 01:21:41.932
[SPEAKER_01]: It has an app that will build you an island, and then it fucking transforms into a jet and flies you there.

01:21:42.312 --> 01:21:42.952
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

01:21:43.252 --> 01:21:45.273
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's motherfucking indestructible.

01:21:45.633 --> 01:21:46.853
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care about any of that.

01:21:47.173 --> 01:21:47.973
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, fine.

01:21:48.273 --> 01:21:52.835
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what the hell entices you about the iPhone 4, if you don't mind me asking?

01:21:53.195 --> 01:21:54.015
[SPEAKER_06]: It is an iPhone.

01:21:54.335 --> 01:21:56.376
[SPEAKER_01]: You do realize that doesn't mean anything.

01:21:56.656 --> 01:21:57.156
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a brand.

01:21:57.176 --> 01:22:01.837
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's on Tiny Watch Productions on YouTube, and I just thought that stuff was funny.

01:22:02.457 --> 01:22:05.138
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the whole sheep thing you were talking about, right, Loki?

01:22:05.638 --> 01:22:08.619
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and bad, bad, bad, because I want one.

01:22:11.795 --> 01:22:19.809
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not saying everybody, there's a few people out there that actually do look at the specs and stuff, but a lot of people just go, oh my god, Apple's releasing something, go buy it.

01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:21.311
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the iPad.

01:22:21.852 --> 01:22:22.433
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

01:22:22.754 --> 01:22:23.515
[SPEAKER_04]: The iPad.

01:22:23.535 --> 01:22:23.595
[SPEAKER_04]: The

01:22:25.952 --> 01:22:26.452
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it.

01:22:27.253 --> 01:22:27.713
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it.

01:22:27.913 --> 01:22:30.454
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, there's some arguments back and forth.

01:22:30.474 --> 01:22:38.296
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently the guy who made that video actually works for Best Buy, and there was a little, like, I guess he was fired, but then he wasn't, according to a story on Gizmodo.

01:22:38.316 --> 01:22:39.737
[SPEAKER_04]: But he didn't go back, I don't think.

01:22:39.777 --> 01:22:42.218
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he told them to take his job and shove it.

01:22:42.258 --> 01:22:43.018
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, basically.

01:22:43.598 --> 01:22:44.198
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

01:22:46.779 --> 01:22:50.181
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that whole text-to-video thing is really easy to do now.

01:22:50.281 --> 01:22:50.401
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

01:22:56.366 --> 01:23:00.428
[SPEAKER_03]: I would take the ferret ten times over that stupid Vuvuzela thing.

01:23:00.468 --> 01:23:03.629
[SPEAKER_03]: If that becomes a new thing on the show, I'm going to kill myself.

01:23:04.709 --> 01:23:04.989
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

01:23:07.570 --> 01:23:08.251
[SPEAKER_12]: We found the Tribble.

01:23:08.491 --> 01:23:09.091
[SPEAKER_12]: We found Angus.

01:23:10.188 --> 01:23:11.128
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:23:30.337 --> 01:23:32.398
[SPEAKER_04]: My phone used to be silver.

01:23:32.578 --> 01:23:35.280
[SPEAKER_04]: It is now gray because all the paint has rubbed off on it.

01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:41.523
[SPEAKER_04]: The rubber that used to be on this phone covering the different speaker ports and whatever has dissolved to nothing.

01:23:42.443 --> 01:23:44.725
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the backlights are probably burnt out.

01:23:45.065 --> 01:23:47.406
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't get internet at all.

01:23:47.426 --> 01:23:49.767
[SPEAKER_03]: It still has an old logo.

01:23:49.867 --> 01:23:52.729
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki's phone is so last gen.

01:23:53.129 --> 01:23:54.371
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically what it is.

01:23:54.391 --> 01:23:55.473
[SPEAKER_12]: It's only three gens ago.

01:23:55.693 --> 01:23:57.175
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like more than that.

01:23:57.395 --> 01:23:58.898
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the point, though.

01:23:59.438 --> 01:24:04.125
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why I don't get a new phone and don't upgrade my service and stuff, because it's fucking expensive.

01:24:04.286 --> 01:24:07.831
[SPEAKER_04]: I pay $50 a month for this phone, of which I use...

01:24:08.872 --> 01:24:11.473
[SPEAKER_03]: I pay $80 for mine, granted.

01:24:11.533 --> 01:24:13.414
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't want to know what Dan and I spend.

01:24:13.494 --> 01:24:18.957
[SPEAKER_03]: I pay $80 for mine, granted, but for $30, I mean, I have internet everywhere, Loki.

01:24:19.037 --> 01:24:19.797
[SPEAKER_03]: Internet everywhere.

01:24:20.218 --> 01:24:28.181
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to say this, and the big thing for me is that if I wanted to have a permanent internet tether, all I have to do is jailbreak my iPhone.

01:24:29.102 --> 01:24:31.723
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can go anywhere and use the 3G as my internet.

01:24:32.523 --> 01:24:37.046
[SPEAKER_12]: Or, you know, it has my... Because otherwise, I was actually looking into buying a PDA.

01:24:40.062 --> 01:24:41.443
[SPEAKER_12]: This replaces a PDA for me.

01:24:42.043 --> 01:24:45.584
[SPEAKER_12]: It replaces my phone, my PDA, and I don't have to carry my Game Boy around.

01:24:46.744 --> 01:24:50.465
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use... And my MP3 player.

01:24:50.525 --> 01:24:54.226
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to tell you, here's a really good reason why you want to have internet on your cell phone.

01:24:54.746 --> 01:24:57.027
[SPEAKER_03]: Because with internet on your cell phone... No camera on this either.

01:24:57.227 --> 01:24:57.987
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but here's the thing.

01:24:58.007 --> 01:25:02.368
[SPEAKER_03]: With internet on your cell phone, you can read TMZ while pooping.

01:25:04.992 --> 01:25:08.334
[SPEAKER_12]: You can sneak into the bathroom at work and play Peggle.

01:25:10.536 --> 01:25:12.837
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so you know.

01:25:13.658 --> 01:25:18.802
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of pooping, I just heard a huge gunshot go off in the living room and almost made me poop right here.

01:25:18.822 --> 01:25:19.822
[SPEAKER_02]: He's playing Crackdown 2.

01:25:19.862 --> 01:25:21.464
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Epic Subwoofer, remember?

01:25:24.206 --> 01:25:25.727
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what keeps me from getting an iPhone?

01:25:26.187 --> 01:25:27.528
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't fucking afford it.

01:25:28.168 --> 01:25:30.830
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:25:53.516 --> 01:25:54.697
[SPEAKER_12]: How about dating sims, Rob?

01:25:54.717 --> 01:25:57.058
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the best DRM ever.

01:25:59.179 --> 01:26:10.985
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, for people who have pirated versions of Love Plus, well, when they play their pirated version, they find a little surprise when they shut off their game and turn it back on.

01:26:12.937 --> 01:26:19.668
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, basically, instead of having to, you know, bypass this and that and not being able to play it, they're like, sure, go ahead and play the game.

01:26:20.089 --> 01:26:23.074
[SPEAKER_12]: And you get all your happy love points with the girl, and yay.

01:26:23.455 --> 01:26:24.436
[SPEAKER_12]: Then you start the game back up.

01:26:24.496 --> 01:26:25.238
[SPEAKER_12]: She hates you.

01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:28.991
[SPEAKER_12]: You cannot get her to like you again.

01:26:29.051 --> 01:26:35.236
[SPEAKER_12]: You cannot get any of the girls to like you again because they know you're a pirate and girls don't like pirates.

01:26:35.837 --> 01:26:37.678
[SPEAKER_12]: At least not in dating sim land.

01:26:37.838 --> 01:26:39.540
[SPEAKER_08]: Why won't she love me?

01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:42.502
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're a dirty ass thief, that's why.

01:26:44.287 --> 01:26:50.530
[SPEAKER_12]: and, well, to read some of these quotes on here, I was dating her normally, and when I restarted, she was pissed at me.

01:26:50.890 --> 01:26:53.311
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't get her to like me, and she's always annoyed at me.

01:26:53.591 --> 01:26:55.372
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the ultimate anti-piracy measure.

01:26:56.313 --> 01:26:59.134
[SPEAKER_12]: I tried the friend part of Love Plus again to get some scenes I missed.

01:26:59.454 --> 01:26:59.854
[SPEAKER_12]: You're right.

01:27:00.155 --> 01:27:01.475
[SPEAKER_12]: She wouldn't let us become lovers.

01:27:02.135 --> 01:27:04.497
[SPEAKER_12]: After 100 days, she still won't let me become her boyfriend.

01:27:04.917 --> 01:27:07.238
[SPEAKER_12]: She completely ignores me and won't send me any mails.

01:27:07.298 --> 01:27:09.079
[SPEAKER_03]: She would never let me see her tits.

01:27:09.319 --> 01:27:10.880
[SPEAKER_12]: The events aren't happening either.

01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:11.600
[SPEAKER_12]: Brutal.

01:27:13.038 --> 01:27:16.220
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, if the developer hates you, the girls hate you too.

01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:17.121
[SPEAKER_02]: What a surprise.

01:27:17.661 --> 01:27:20.283
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's written into the game's copy production.

01:27:20.703 --> 01:27:22.565
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, would you show your boobs to a pirate?

01:27:24.986 --> 01:27:25.447
[SPEAKER_12]: Depends.

01:27:25.667 --> 01:27:27.308
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you shown your boobs to a pirate?

01:27:29.321 --> 01:27:29.722
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo-ho.

01:27:29.742 --> 01:27:33.065
[SPEAKER_12]: Depends.

01:27:33.505 --> 01:27:36.188
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep in mind, I've done some interesting things.

01:27:36.288 --> 01:27:37.589
[SPEAKER_12]: Mardi Gras did come from my hometown.

01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:38.570
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know.

01:27:38.610 --> 01:27:40.512
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, let's not go there.

01:27:41.833 --> 01:27:44.376
[SPEAKER_03]: But this reminds me of the... This shirt would be easy to do.

01:27:45.717 --> 01:27:46.558
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, no, no, no.

01:27:46.578 --> 01:27:48.300
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you have to say that while we're trying to do a show?

01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:53.885
[SPEAKER_12]: I was cleaning out my closet and I found this shirt and it's too big for me because it was from when I was 20 pounds heavier.

01:27:54.958 --> 01:27:55.158
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

01:28:13.731 --> 01:28:15.972
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I see that, I'm like, yeah, I have a friend that would do that.

01:28:16.933 --> 01:28:17.893
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Jamie, somebody else.

01:28:18.213 --> 01:28:19.714
[SPEAKER_12]: I would never do that at Disneyland, Rob.

01:28:19.874 --> 01:28:22.296
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at Disneyland, but at Mardi Gras.

01:28:22.636 --> 01:28:25.258
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, no, no, because Mardi Gras does not have boob flashing.

01:28:25.578 --> 01:28:28.199
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it does, but it's sort of like, what the crap are you doing?

01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:30.161
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm showing my boobs.

01:28:31.862 --> 01:28:33.303
[SPEAKER_12]: Seriously, you do it at Mardi Gras.

01:28:33.543 --> 01:28:35.324
[SPEAKER_12]: You're being stupid.

01:28:35.964 --> 01:28:37.145
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't care about your tits.

01:28:37.905 --> 01:28:38.626
[SPEAKER_12]: We want moon pies.

01:28:39.696 --> 01:28:43.438
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm remembering the Gabriel Iglesias skit where they flashed.

01:28:43.719 --> 01:28:46.780
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, and they thought that it were a couple women because they're man boobs.

01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:47.681
[SPEAKER_02]: They look like sexy bitches.

01:28:48.742 --> 01:28:49.602
[SPEAKER_12]: Because they're man boobs.

01:28:49.762 --> 01:28:57.707
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say real quick, it reminded me that whole little story of, I know we've covered it on the show before, the Earthbound copy protection or whatever it was.

01:28:57.827 --> 01:29:00.249
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the game got harder if you pirated it.

01:29:00.309 --> 01:29:03.571
[SPEAKER_03]: There would be like, yeah, four times as many monsters and it deletes itself.

01:29:03.631 --> 01:29:05.312
[SPEAKER_02]: In the last battle, it flashed.

01:29:05.512 --> 01:29:11.497
[SPEAKER_02]: Freezes, you truly cannot comprehend the true form of the attack because it deletes your fucking save file.

01:29:12.058 --> 01:29:12.719
[SPEAKER_02]: That's brutal.

01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:23.769
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I mean, if you're gonna pirate a game... However, I would love to see the people who got that far with it in... You know, I wanna see a ROM hack where you can play it that difficult and beat the game.

01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:24.770
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's been done.

01:29:25.070 --> 01:29:25.270
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:26.191
[SPEAKER_12]: People just...

01:29:27.168 --> 01:29:28.591
[SPEAKER_04]: Get around this copy protection.

01:29:28.631 --> 01:29:29.612
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't take long.

01:29:29.913 --> 01:29:33.619
[SPEAKER_12]: But no, but I think it's fun that that's what they do because they recognize it's going to happen.

01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:37.366
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's just make their lives a little bit of hell until they figure it out.

01:29:37.846 --> 01:29:39.629
[SPEAKER_12]: By then, we'll hit our sales.

01:29:40.371 --> 01:29:40.831
[SPEAKER_12]: We're done.

01:29:41.496 --> 01:30:10.784
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we also had a story not too long ago, probably about four or five months ago, about the whole Batman Arkham Asylum had been pirated, and apparently in the pirated version of the game, one of the, and I'm trying to go from memory here, so forgive me if I screw this up, one of the jump types was missing, or there was a puzzle that couldn't be finished, and a guy went on the forums to complain about it, and the creators of the game, or the forum moderators basically said, yeah, you're playing a pirated version of the game, because we kind of did that on purpose in the pirated version of the game,

01:30:11.064 --> 01:30:12.425
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

01:30:30.814 --> 01:30:56.589
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, that was about as stupid as the guy who complained on the Steam forums that he got banned for what was told to him was an undetectable hack and I shouldn't be banned because it said the hack was undetectable you guys shouldn't have been able to detect it why did I get banned, reverse the ban lol, bye, have a nice day oh, you should probably get your money back for buying that hack

01:30:56.809 --> 01:30:58.210
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just called an idiot.

01:30:58.370 --> 01:31:00.471
[SPEAKER_03]: Somewhere in a lunchroom, nerds are laughing.

01:31:00.491 --> 01:31:02.233
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just an idiot.

01:31:02.453 --> 01:31:07.036
[SPEAKER_12]: This is one thing I actually really do dig about The Sims.

01:31:07.716 --> 01:31:15.622
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not playing a... All my copies are legit and registered, but I download hacks like crazy for them.

01:31:16.922 --> 01:31:26.449
[SPEAKER_12]: The EA actually looks at some of the stuff that people make modded stuff for and actually incorporate those themes into their future releases for their store.

01:31:27.770 --> 01:31:28.610
[SPEAKER_12]: They know what happens.

01:31:28.971 --> 01:31:34.074
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the moral of the story here is buy your games legitimately and maybe you can see some tits.

01:31:35.815 --> 01:31:40.739
[SPEAKER_12]: I think if you pay for your game legitimately and then mod it.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.060
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

01:31:43.601 --> 01:31:48.944
[SPEAKER_12]: The only way that you can get the patches that EA puts out is to basically reinstall everything, which I've done.

01:31:51.006 --> 01:31:52.587
[SPEAKER_12]: But I only do that when I buy new versions.

01:31:53.300 --> 01:32:00.624
[SPEAKER_12]: But still, I like it better when a company understands that it's going to happen, and then they fuck with you.

01:32:00.744 --> 01:32:01.244
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I agree.

01:32:01.364 --> 01:32:03.425
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you buy it, you should be able to hack the shit out of it.

01:32:03.525 --> 01:32:06.547
[SPEAKER_03]: It's your copy of the game, and if you want to tear it apart, go for it.

01:32:07.367 --> 01:32:14.111
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you should hack it to re-upload it to be free and all that, but whatever.

01:32:14.966 --> 01:32:15.787
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on.

01:32:15.867 --> 01:32:17.368
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about release dates.

01:32:17.428 --> 01:32:21.450
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of buying your games legitimately, there's a whole lot of games you can buy legitimately this week.

01:32:21.911 --> 01:32:22.951
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, start us off with the U.S.

01:32:23.231 --> 01:32:26.654
[SPEAKER_04]: Including Chuck E. Cheese's Party Games for the Nintendo DS.

01:32:27.234 --> 01:32:29.576
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there's a franchise most people forgot about.

01:32:30.556 --> 01:32:35.019
[SPEAKER_04]: Little League World Series Baseball 2010 coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.

01:32:38.421 --> 01:32:44.705
[SPEAKER_04]: Then, of course, the Wii version, which includes, I believe, the last year version and this year.

01:32:44.725 --> 01:32:47.107
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering why they called that Double Play.

01:32:48.567 --> 01:32:49.768
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

01:32:54.230 --> 01:32:57.471
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's coming out on Wii and DS, I believe.

01:32:58.571 --> 01:33:04.054
[SPEAKER_04]: NCAA Football 2011 on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.

01:33:05.534 --> 01:33:10.436
[SPEAKER_04]: Pausing Claws Regal Resort, the game with the most retarded cover ever.

01:33:11.257 --> 01:33:16.499
[SPEAKER_04]: It has cats and dogs dressed up like their royalty.

01:33:16.959 --> 01:33:20.961
[SPEAKER_04]: A cat with a tiara, a dog with a crown, and a bunny dressed up like a jester.

01:33:21.161 --> 01:33:21.441
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

01:33:23.018 --> 01:33:27.902
[SPEAKER_04]: Cat's and Dogs Revenge of Kitty Galore Disciples 3 Resistance PC

01:33:43.732 --> 01:33:45.554
[SPEAKER_04]: and then some more junk.

01:33:46.674 --> 01:33:49.036
[SPEAKER_04]: Hidden Objects Mystery Stories.

01:33:49.716 --> 01:33:54.920
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a hidden objects game, obviously, and that'll be out on the Nintendo DS.

01:33:56.341 --> 01:33:56.981
[SPEAKER_04]: That is it.

01:33:57.181 --> 01:33:59.163
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, oh, wait, no, I'm sorry.

01:33:59.843 --> 01:34:01.404
[SPEAKER_04]: Planet Pet Vet Collection.

01:34:01.904 --> 01:34:04.546
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple Pet Vet games that have already been released.

01:34:04.706 --> 01:34:05.767
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and Sorcerer's Apprentice.

01:34:08.014 --> 01:34:09.195
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, movie tie-ins.

01:34:09.215 --> 01:34:11.075
[SPEAKER_02]: The movie doesn't look horrible.

01:34:11.095 --> 01:34:13.356
[SPEAKER_02]: It has Nicolas Cage, therefore I'm not going to see it.

01:34:13.576 --> 01:34:15.537
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it has Nicolas Cage as Nicolas Cage.

01:34:18.318 --> 01:34:24.761
[SPEAKER_03]: Salacious Pop in our chatroom says, Oh, so cats can be CEOs and presidents, but bunnies can't be little kings and princesses.

01:34:24.861 --> 01:34:25.261
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:34:26.502 --> 01:34:27.122
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different.

01:34:28.443 --> 01:34:29.643
[SPEAKER_02]: Why you got to hate on the bunnies, man?

01:34:30.884 --> 01:34:31.524
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I can't.

01:34:31.877 --> 01:34:32.137
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:34:32.678 --> 01:34:35.721
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go over to Japanese release dates and see what's coming out around the world.

01:34:36.462 --> 01:34:37.823
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox 360 in Japan.

01:34:37.883 --> 01:34:38.884
[SPEAKER_03]: PGA Woods.

01:34:39.285 --> 01:34:39.725
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

01:34:39.785 --> 01:34:40.346
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiger Woods.

01:34:40.626 --> 01:34:41.747
[SPEAKER_03]: PGA.

01:34:41.767 --> 01:34:42.568
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much the same thing.

01:34:42.908 --> 01:34:44.350
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11.

01:34:45.651 --> 01:34:49.575
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one that South Park would have you believe has the whole fighting simulation in it.

01:34:49.615 --> 01:34:50.416
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really should have.

01:34:50.576 --> 01:34:53.279
[SPEAKER_03]: It really would have made the game so much more interesting.

01:34:53.859 --> 01:34:56.843
[SPEAKER_03]: On the PlayStation 3, same thing, but there's a couple other games too.

01:34:57.243 --> 01:34:59.926
[SPEAKER_03]: Naruto, Narutimate Storm gets a price reduction.

01:35:00.387 --> 01:35:05.673
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as new games go, there's one coming out from Konami called GQ Powerful Pro Yaku 2010.

01:35:05.793 --> 01:35:06.374
[SPEAKER_03]: This is baseball.

01:35:06.474 --> 01:35:06.714
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

01:35:09.637 --> 01:35:11.238
[SPEAKER_12]: Dragon Quest Monsters Battle Road Victory Game

01:35:34.255 --> 01:35:36.296
[SPEAKER_03]: Fire Emblem Shin Monsu no Nazo Hikari Tutakage no Yu

01:35:58.110 --> 01:35:59.770
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's coming out a little early in Japan.

01:36:00.210 --> 01:36:01.931
[SPEAKER_03]: Love Plus gets a price reduction.

01:36:02.591 --> 01:36:04.771
[SPEAKER_03]: Keshikakukon comes out as well.

01:36:05.192 --> 01:36:07.232
[SPEAKER_03]: And Metal Fight Beyblade.

01:36:07.472 --> 01:36:11.693
[SPEAKER_03]: Bakugami Shushono Shurai comes out from Hudson.

01:36:12.213 --> 01:36:14.454
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if that's a series we know here.

01:36:16.374 --> 01:36:17.914
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an action-based game.

01:36:17.934 --> 01:36:20.255
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it comes with a special little controller or something.

01:36:20.315 --> 01:36:21.935
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a thicker packaging.

01:36:22.595 --> 01:36:24.236
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's like one of those... What is it?

01:36:24.456 --> 01:36:24.896
[SPEAKER_03]: Beyblade?

01:36:25.336 --> 01:36:25.596
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:36:25.616 --> 01:36:25.696
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:36:26.016 --> 01:36:27.977
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a series that's been out over here.

01:36:28.437 --> 01:36:30.458
[SPEAKER_04]: Beyblade is... Spinning Tops.

01:36:31.499 --> 01:36:32.359
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's what those are.

01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:33.980
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that one game?

01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:41.024
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it wasn't Tops, but it was... Where was the game that you were shooting silver... Crossfire.

01:36:41.164 --> 01:36:41.844
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's Crossfire.

01:36:41.864 --> 01:36:43.165
[SPEAKER_14]: Crossfire!

01:36:44.326 --> 01:36:46.487
[SPEAKER_04]: With the really useless pieces that would spin around.

01:36:46.883 --> 01:37:12.758
[SPEAKER_03]: and lastly on the PSP the Castlevania Dracula X Chronicles gets a price reduction but as far as new games go there's Last Ranker comes out Papa Music Portable gets a price reduction Naruto Shippuden Kizuna Drive comes out and Busou Shinki Battle Masters comes out as well from Konami which looks like um is that a shmup because it kind of looks like it from the cover it's one of those robo anime babes it looks like she turns into a plane

01:37:14.537 --> 01:37:16.158
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:37:44.947 --> 01:37:46.448
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like that, too.

01:37:48.209 --> 01:37:50.690
[SPEAKER_12]: Or at least a way that you can de-tag it yourself.

01:37:53.012 --> 01:37:53.752
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you can.

01:37:54.093 --> 01:37:54.313
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

01:37:54.653 --> 01:37:54.813
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:37:54.833 --> 01:37:55.914
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't seen it yet.

01:37:56.574 --> 01:37:59.176
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, so, games.

01:37:59.876 --> 01:38:05.459
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, and this is actually, you know, yesterday, but it's worth saying the Silver Lining came out, woohoo.

01:38:05.579 --> 01:38:07.260
[SPEAKER_12]: On the 13th, Deathspank.

01:38:08.461 --> 01:38:09.121
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't get it.

01:38:09.762 --> 01:38:09.922
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

01:38:09.942 --> 01:38:11.663
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a game on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:38:12.117 --> 01:38:13.359
[SPEAKER_12]: and PlayStation 3.

01:38:16.144 --> 01:38:23.317
[SPEAKER_12]: Destination Arcade and then the 16th Puzzle Quest 2 and Toy Story 3, the video game, which actually I was looking at the preview for that.

01:38:23.337 --> 01:38:24.018
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks kind of fine.

01:38:25.066 --> 01:38:25.546
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

01:38:45.970 --> 01:38:52.535
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there has been a trial date, or at least a couple trial dates, set for the Infinity Ward suit.

01:38:52.575 --> 01:39:04.583
[SPEAKER_04]: You may remember, of course, the founders of Infinity Ward were forcefully departed from their company and are now suing for royalties that were unpaid.

01:39:05.523 --> 01:39:07.484
[SPEAKER_04]: The lawsuit will take place on May 23, 2011.

01:39:11.125 --> 01:39:21.489
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also supposed to be another hearing on August 5 to determine whether a third lawsuit filed by employees of Infinity Ward against Activision should be considered with the other two lawsuits.

01:39:23.409 --> 01:39:36.252
[SPEAKER_04]: On, I guess, March 1st, Activision dismissed both Wes and Zampella, the creators of the Call of Duty series, for alleging insubordination and breach of contract by the two.

01:39:36.932 --> 01:39:47.934
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, they're suing seeking $36 million in unpaid royalties and alleging Activision rigged an investigation into their conduct to find a pretext to fire them.

01:39:48.694 --> 01:40:01.905
[SPEAKER_04]: Activision filed a countersuit against the two and of course since then they've created the Respawn Entertainment Studio and there's I believe at least 40 of the employees that have kind of moved over to their new studio as well

01:40:03.499 --> 01:40:05.621
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I know what Activision could do about it.

01:40:06.702 --> 01:40:09.104
[SPEAKER_02]: They could hire that lawyer you had to deal with.

01:40:09.764 --> 01:40:10.205
[SPEAKER_14]: God.

01:40:10.625 --> 01:40:12.867
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's the case, dude, I'm serious.

01:40:12.987 --> 01:40:21.234
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's the case, that trial will take about three years to complete because that guy is slow and confusing and will not help them out in one bit.

01:40:21.754 --> 01:40:24.576
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure that they can afford a better lawyer than that because...

01:40:26.898 --> 01:40:28.580
[SPEAKER_04]: The defense for us, the jury hibernates.

01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:29.561
[SPEAKER_04]: He was terrible.

01:40:44.534 --> 01:40:46.295
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't we all just get along?

01:40:46.595 --> 01:40:47.055
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

01:40:47.375 --> 01:40:55.898
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I could have recorded that trial just so people can understand the kind of pain and suffering I, you know, was affected by.

01:40:57.158 --> 01:41:00.899
[SPEAKER_04]: I should sue her for the pain and suffering of that trial.

01:41:00.939 --> 01:41:03.720
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was seriously such a waste of time.

01:41:04.631 --> 01:41:09.096
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, I'm sure there's going to be lots of... I can't believe it's actually going to trial.

01:41:09.156 --> 01:41:10.778
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of this stuff usually gets settled.

01:41:11.499 --> 01:41:12.660
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it's on Court TV.

01:41:13.261 --> 01:41:13.881
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe E!

01:41:13.901 --> 01:41:15.063
[SPEAKER_03]: will do some reenactments.

01:41:15.183 --> 01:41:17.465
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember during the Michael Jackson trial when he did the reenactments?

01:41:17.485 --> 01:41:18.446
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the best stuff ever.

01:41:18.707 --> 01:41:19.948
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about gaming companies.

01:41:19.988 --> 01:41:20.809
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody gives a shit.

01:41:20.869 --> 01:41:21.650
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess that's true.

01:41:22.010 --> 01:41:22.491
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know...

01:41:26.624 --> 01:41:47.528
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's move on and talk about this interesting little story about Roger Ebert, which I find kind of interesting because, you know, he was kind of, a few years ago, no, actually it wasn't a few years ago, probably about a year ago, he made this post about video games are not art and can never be art.

01:41:48.189 --> 01:41:50.169
[SPEAKER_03]: He's basically saying, you know, video games are...

01:41:50.749 --> 01:41:51.149
[SPEAKER_03]: Not art!

01:41:51.529 --> 01:41:55.731
[SPEAKER_03]: And he took a lot of crap from people that were like, you know, well, what about Flower?

01:41:55.811 --> 01:41:57.412
[SPEAKER_03]: What about Shadow of the Colossus?

01:41:57.472 --> 01:42:01.954
[SPEAKER_03]: What about, you know, all these other great games that, you know, you're not really giving a fair shot to?

01:42:03.075 --> 01:42:07.977
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Roger Ebert actually came out, and this is actually kind of in the week we were gone, but it was worth mentioning here.

01:42:08.377 --> 01:42:11.400
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, I was a fool for mentioning video games in the first place.

01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:14.482
[SPEAKER_03]: I would never express an opinion on a movie I hadn't seen.

01:42:14.842 --> 01:42:24.450
[SPEAKER_03]: So he did make kind of like a, if you will, like a retraction post, but when I read it, I didn't really see it as a retraction post, more or less as like an olive branch type of post.

01:42:25.291 --> 01:42:25.611
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh...

01:42:41.886 --> 01:43:04.615
[SPEAKER_02]: To supply him with a system and games that they consider to be artful And he still refuses to play them He just isn't going to make a statement about things he doesn't want to experience Yeah, so one thing I think you should kind of make sure you pull away from this He didn't come out and say, okay, they're art He's just saying, you know what, I shouldn't have said anything

01:43:05.003 --> 01:43:05.503
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my bad.

01:43:05.603 --> 01:43:07.205
[SPEAKER_03]: Passive-aggressive bullshit.

01:43:07.345 --> 01:43:09.466
[SPEAKER_12]: If you can't say something nice, don't say anything.

01:43:11.687 --> 01:43:14.209
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's very interesting that he kind of won't play the games.

01:43:14.289 --> 01:43:17.852
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, at the same time, no one has to do anything they don't want to do.

01:43:18.612 --> 01:43:19.793
[SPEAKER_03]: No one has to do anything.

01:43:20.153 --> 01:43:21.294
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there you go.

01:43:22.214 --> 01:43:25.417
[SPEAKER_03]: He's basically come out and said, I'm not going to do it, so you know what?

01:43:25.597 --> 01:43:26.717
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to comment on it.

01:43:27.018 --> 01:43:28.859
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was bad to comment on it in the first place.

01:43:29.815 --> 01:43:33.678
[SPEAKER_03]: And so most people are like, okay, you know, I never hated the guy for what he said.

01:43:33.718 --> 01:43:35.500
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, hate would always be a strong word anyway.

01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:39.043
[SPEAKER_03]: I've rather thought his opinions on movies were very interesting and so forth.

01:43:39.503 --> 01:43:45.348
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I think, yeah, you probably shouldn't make such a bold statement about something you really haven't... I mean, especially...

01:43:46.744 --> 01:43:52.286
[SPEAKER_03]: Games like, you know, The Flowers and The Shadow Colossus and Final Fantasy is a more artful type of games.

01:43:52.306 --> 01:43:55.387
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can't just associate video games with Mortal Kombat.

01:43:55.427 --> 01:44:00.068
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be like just associating movies with Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus.

01:44:00.808 --> 01:44:02.189
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet Ebert wouldn't appreciate that.

01:44:04.660 --> 01:44:20.420
[SPEAKER_02]: it still bugs me a little bit that he's choosing to maintain his level of ignorance rather than accept some enlightenment that's being offered him that's what still bugs me he's refusing to be educated

01:44:21.317 --> 01:44:22.817
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's a lot of people, though.

01:44:22.957 --> 01:44:25.058
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a big failing of humanity.

01:44:25.078 --> 01:44:26.898
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what bugs me about a lot of people.

01:44:26.918 --> 01:44:29.999
[SPEAKER_03]: To be fair, the guy's got a lot of other stuff to worry about.

01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:33.780
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no way to be fair about it.

01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:41.482
[SPEAKER_12]: Ignorance, especially self-imposed ignorance, is, to me, unforgivable.

01:44:41.502 --> 01:44:44.223
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at least he came out and said, I was ignorant and I shouldn't have said anything.

01:44:44.243 --> 01:44:45.203
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe he didn't say that.

01:44:45.263 --> 01:44:46.243
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

01:44:46.263 --> 01:44:47.503
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to choose to remain ignorant.

01:44:47.543 --> 01:44:48.243
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

01:44:48.664 --> 01:44:49.244
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good day.

01:44:49.984 --> 01:44:50.284
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

01:44:52.080 --> 01:45:14.999
[SPEAKER_03]: alright to each their own that's it for the news but we can't end this segment just yet we've got to get to the classic video game of the week that's right here on the show we always take a few minutes to say hey why are you not admiring these games from the past you should take a moment to respect your elders and the elder games that came before you

01:45:15.373 --> 01:45:16.594
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super, super quiet, you guys.

01:45:16.674 --> 01:45:17.935
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's Dragon Slayer.

01:45:17.955 --> 01:45:18.916
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

01:45:42.012 --> 01:45:43.876
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you want to get on to the other stuff.

01:45:43.896 --> 01:45:46.342
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if this one plays a little bit louder.

01:45:46.402 --> 01:45:48.205
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I feel like I have to move right really quickly.

01:45:48.867 --> 01:45:50.150
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this one plays a little louder for me.

01:45:50.612 --> 01:45:53.974
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just... That's a complete, perfect playthrough.

01:45:55.395 --> 01:45:55.995
[SPEAKER_12]: In HD.

01:45:57.016 --> 01:46:13.146
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, the game is Dragon's Lair, which I have a bajillion copies of, including the HD copy, and I have it on Sega CD, and... But this game was out on Laserdisc, animated by Don Bluth.

01:46:14.306 --> 01:46:14.507
[SPEAKER_12]: And...

01:46:17.348 --> 01:46:28.099
[SPEAKER_12]: You basically, as each little section play, you'd have to tap the right direction or the right button and it would bring it up as a little flash on the screen.

01:46:29.730 --> 01:46:34.493
[SPEAKER_12]: So you'd have to move in the correct direction based on what it gave you.

01:46:35.293 --> 01:46:36.734
[SPEAKER_12]: And you'd have to be pretty fast.

01:46:36.774 --> 01:46:45.219
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, right at the beginning... I mean, I can't tell you how many times I fell through the damn bridge right when you're walking into the lair.

01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:48.881
[SPEAKER_12]: It's also out on the iPhone, too, just to say so.

01:46:51.363 --> 01:46:56.786
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, about the game, you play as Dirk the Daring to rescue Princess Daphne from the evil dragon Sludge.

01:46:57.874 --> 01:46:59.415
[SPEAKER_12]: and you go through it.

01:47:00.375 --> 01:47:01.976
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really straightforward.

01:47:02.596 --> 01:47:08.199
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, this was one of the first arcade games that cost 50 cents to play.

01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:12.641
[SPEAKER_12]: And usually most of the other games were a quarter of play.

01:47:15.703 --> 01:47:20.325
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, the game was inspired by the old-text game, Adventure.

01:47:21.225 --> 01:47:23.887
[SPEAKER_12]: And so this is called a graphic adventure.

01:47:25.348 --> 01:47:45.969
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, when, uh, the game came out, it was basically a big sensation, again, not just because of, uh, the fact that it was more expensive, um, but that, uh, it made games, the game itself shut down quite a bit because it was running on a later disc.

01:47:47.122 --> 01:47:50.504
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they basically were overused and really broke down.

01:47:50.524 --> 01:47:54.546
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's actually one of the, you know, probably the most popular game of its type.

01:47:54.666 --> 01:48:02.730
[SPEAKER_12]: Other ones that came out in the series, there was Space Ace and Dragon's Lair 2.

01:48:03.430 --> 01:48:06.231
[SPEAKER_12]: And even, there were a number of other ones that were like that.

01:48:06.631 --> 01:48:13.875
[SPEAKER_12]: They even converted the Lupin movie, the Castle of Cagliostro, into one called Cliffjumper.

01:48:15.356 --> 01:48:16.677
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it was the same company.

01:48:23.656 --> 01:48:24.617
[SPEAKER_12]: I love Space Ace.

01:48:25.537 --> 01:48:31.260
[SPEAKER_12]: There's also Dragon's Lair 3D Return to the Lair, which is a 3D reinterpretation of the game.

01:48:32.781 --> 01:48:40.105
[SPEAKER_12]: They actually had a Dragon's Lair movie scripted and ready to go into production.

01:48:42.447 --> 01:48:48.910
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now, though, and they are doing this completely old-school 2D animation, but it's held up in development right now.

01:48:49.491 --> 01:48:51.092
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a Blu-ray version of Dragon's Lair...

01:48:53.713 --> 01:49:00.280
[SPEAKER_12]: and they basically had to completely go through and remaster everything, clean the cells themselves.

01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:06.787
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember when they did the Macross thing where they actually extended the frames out to wider screens?

01:49:06.967 --> 01:49:07.748
[SPEAKER_12]: They're doing the same thing.

01:49:10.030 --> 01:49:16.677
[SPEAKER_02]: This though is not to be confused with the utterly horrible NES adaptation of Dragon's Lair.

01:49:18.577 --> 01:49:20.098
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the good stuff right here.

01:49:20.218 --> 01:49:29.304
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to do an aside when Jamie's done because there was a home version I played a lot more of than the arcade game growing up, but I'll get into that in a minute.

01:49:29.504 --> 01:49:34.167
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there's also, you probably have heard Princess Daphne in the background.

01:49:35.348 --> 01:49:36.909
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't really look very princess-like.

01:49:36.969 --> 01:49:38.570
[SPEAKER_12]: She actually is just kind of ditzy and squeaky.

01:49:38.590 --> 01:49:39.391
[SPEAKER_11]: She looks like a hoe.

01:49:39.631 --> 01:49:40.292
[SPEAKER_12]: She looks like a whoo.

01:49:41.372 --> 01:49:43.113
[SPEAKER_12]: A hoover, to quote my mother.

01:49:44.454 --> 01:49:55.240
[SPEAKER_12]: But for all the other versions that came, there was... There was actually Escape from Sinja's Castle, which was a non-linear version of it.

01:49:56.261 --> 01:49:57.682
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a puzzle one...

01:50:00.024 --> 01:50:01.685
[SPEAKER_12]: That came out on the old 8-bit systems.

01:50:02.325 --> 01:50:07.288
[SPEAKER_12]: There is the NES one, the Super NES one called Dragon's Lair, which was a platformer version.

01:50:07.388 --> 01:50:09.189
[SPEAKER_12]: Also Space Ace had a platformer version.

01:50:10.129 --> 01:50:14.592
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a Game Boy one called Dragon's Lair The Legend, which really has nothing to do with it.

01:50:17.353 --> 01:50:20.255
[SPEAKER_12]: It's actually a port of an old ZX Spectrum game called Roller Coaster.

01:50:21.495 --> 01:50:26.657
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, the Game Boy Color version is actually pretty much like the original.

01:50:28.018 --> 01:50:47.486
[SPEAKER_12]: There was Dragon's Lair Deluxe Pack, there was an Apple version, the Sega CD version, talking about the old Mac 1 from 1994, and then the emulator Daphne, where you have to have the original Laserdisc and the ROM file to be able to play that, or they have other versions that use MPEG-2 video streams.

01:50:48.386 --> 01:50:52.431
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yeah, there are a lot of versions out, just looking over the list.

01:50:53.112 --> 01:50:58.539
[SPEAKER_12]: Ever since 1983, we've had, I'm just going to run off the list of different systems it's been on.

01:50:59.040 --> 01:50:59.300
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay?

01:50:59.420 --> 01:50:59.641
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:51:00.816 --> 01:51:27.485
[SPEAKER_12]: We've had the Arcade, Coleco Atom, Armstead, CPC, Spectrum, Commodore 64, Atari ST, the Amiga, PC, NES, Game Boy, Mac Plus, Atari ST, more Mac, Sega CD, 3DO, Mega CD, or Sega CD, CDI, Atari Jaguar, Windows 95, let's see...

01:51:30.006 --> 01:51:52.251
[SPEAKER_12]: Game Boy Color, PS2, Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation 2, mobile phone, Blu-ray player, PS3, HD DVD players, iPhone, DSi for DSiWare, DS, PSP, and the Wii as a disc.

01:51:53.591 --> 01:51:54.332
[SPEAKER_12]: So, wow.

01:51:55.152 --> 01:52:02.276
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, the character Dirk was battling mid-life crisis in an episode of Robot Chicken.

01:52:04.277 --> 01:52:04.517
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

01:52:05.537 --> 01:52:07.058
[SPEAKER_12]: And part of the game was parodied in Family Guy.

01:52:10.140 --> 01:52:11.540
[SPEAKER_03]: There really wasn't a lot like it.

01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:15.122
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, there were those other games you mentioned, but I can't think of a lot of games that were really like this.

01:52:15.442 --> 01:52:15.802
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever.

01:52:16.123 --> 01:52:20.645
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ever thought that the concept of the QuickTime event was new... No.

01:52:20.665 --> 01:52:20.705
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

01:52:21.090 --> 01:52:23.613
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Dragon's Lair did it way before.

01:52:25.114 --> 01:52:28.258
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was even quicker.

01:52:28.698 --> 01:52:29.479
[SPEAKER_12]: We're at the end of the game.

01:52:29.819 --> 01:52:32.622
[SPEAKER_03]: If DarkSakura's done with her piece, I want to do a quick aside if I could.

01:52:32.642 --> 01:52:33.183
[SPEAKER_03]: Please do.

01:52:33.223 --> 01:52:40.611
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I played, growing up, an awful lot the Commodore 64 versions of the game, which were different.

01:52:40.891 --> 01:52:42.212
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if we can get some of the music here.

01:52:43.013 --> 01:53:10.594
[SPEAKER_03]: this is kind of like the you know it was much different it took scenes inspired by the arcade game and kind of made them like actiony things like here's that scene where the disc is kind of falling down well instead of you know obviously they couldn't port the movie type stuff at the time so instead they put in these little clouds and you'd have to run away as they're breathing air this game was just as hard if not harder than the arcade game that was out there terribly hard

01:53:10.954 --> 01:53:13.235
[SPEAKER_12]: The SNES one was actually kind of difficult.

01:53:13.315 --> 01:53:15.356
[SPEAKER_12]: I hated the SNES version of Space Ace, by the way.

01:53:15.496 --> 01:53:23.841
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the music in Dragon's Lair and then the sequel, they also had Dragon's Lair 2, Escape from Singe's Castle, had awesome music.

01:53:23.901 --> 01:53:24.361
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to this.

01:53:26.625 --> 01:53:28.246
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, a little theme song got cut off.

01:53:28.266 --> 01:53:30.008
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, it's the whole Rapids area.

01:53:30.028 --> 01:53:30.968
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the whole Rapids area.

01:53:31.208 --> 01:53:34.291
[SPEAKER_03]: But I love the music and the boulders area is awesome.

01:53:34.331 --> 01:53:35.251
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if I can get to that part.

01:53:35.291 --> 01:53:39.014
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go.

01:53:39.695 --> 01:53:44.458
[SPEAKER_03]: This is pretty cool.

01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:49.822
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, I mean, the soundtrack to this game was awesome.

01:53:49.882 --> 01:53:55.206
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it wasn't quite the arcade game, but it was levels kind of inspired by the arcade game every bit as hard.

01:53:55.586 --> 01:53:58.767
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if I were to play this today, I would not be able to get very far.

01:53:58.807 --> 01:54:04.508
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, see, you have to run past the things, but you're slowly moving back the whole time, and that's just, you know, one of the other stages.

01:54:04.969 --> 01:54:09.630
[SPEAKER_03]: And then later on, you get into, you know, like, here's that one room.

01:54:10.450 --> 01:54:11.950
[SPEAKER_12]: Where the thing takes your hat and your sword?

01:54:12.130 --> 01:54:16.852
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a little more like the arcade version, where you have to hit up at certain times.

01:54:17.772 --> 01:54:19.052
[SPEAKER_03]: The soundtrack was just awesome.

01:54:20.413 --> 01:54:21.133
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're into that whole...

01:54:22.156 --> 01:54:23.217
[SPEAKER_03]: Old School Sounding Stuff.

01:54:23.797 --> 01:54:28.701
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my little aside to the Classic Game of the Week is that the Commodore 64 one is definitely worth your attention.

01:54:28.741 --> 01:54:30.782
[SPEAKER_12]: I just figured it was about time we did Dragon's Lair.

01:54:31.042 --> 01:54:31.583
[SPEAKER_03]: It really was.

01:54:31.623 --> 01:54:32.583
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised it's been.

01:54:32.623 --> 01:54:34.945
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we've been doing the Classic Game of the Week for a long time, right?

01:54:34.985 --> 01:54:37.087
[SPEAKER_12]: I have had a feeling that I had already done it.

01:54:37.647 --> 01:54:39.528
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I actually went back and checked the list.

01:54:39.648 --> 01:54:42.510
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, whoever updates, you know, the wiki.

01:54:42.651 --> 01:54:43.571
[SPEAKER_12]: Update the rest of it.

01:54:45.312 --> 01:54:46.273
[SPEAKER_12]: Give Drew your money.

01:54:48.094 --> 01:54:50.276
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's about time.

01:54:50.896 --> 01:54:51.397
[SPEAKER_12]: It's about time.

01:54:51.957 --> 01:54:52.298
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

01:54:53.039 --> 01:54:57.765
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think we're going to wrap up part A of our show here, but guys, there is plenty more show to come.

01:54:57.805 --> 01:55:01.249
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some rapid fire news coming up in the next segment.

01:55:01.269 --> 01:55:01.549
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk...

01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:16.552
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, excuse me, about Red Dead Redemption, Split Second getting ported, Guitar Hero, Rock Band Updates, and then Anime coming to your 360, Dead Rising 2 News, Twitter Topics, so get your Twitter Topics in, and the Mailbag.

01:55:16.612 --> 01:55:22.217
[SPEAKER_03]: It is all coming up right after this when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:55:28.010 --> 01:55:39.155
[SPEAKER_03]: And welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, July the 11th of 2010, where we are taping the 373rd episode of our show.

01:55:39.215 --> 01:55:41.156
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, we've been doing this quite some time.

01:55:41.877 --> 01:55:45.258
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, we're going to get into some quick, quick news here in a moment.

01:55:45.338 --> 01:55:48.880
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, I wanted to just quickly mention, because I didn't impart A, but it's very important.

01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:50.881
[SPEAKER_03]: The big battle is still going on.

01:55:51.201 --> 01:55:56.085
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, it's us versus other all-game shows, or I should say our listeners versus other all-games listeners.

01:55:56.646 --> 01:56:05.714
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the Soldner X competition wrapped up, and sadly, I thought we had at least one person who was going to participate, but for whatever reason, confusion, I don't know, I don't follow.

01:56:06.715 --> 01:56:07.575
[SPEAKER_03]: The scores didn't happen.

01:56:08.376 --> 01:56:09.957
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:56:33.012 --> 01:56:40.973
[SPEAKER_03]: Go in there and then click sign up or register for this competition and that way your name will be in there and they'll come looking for you.

01:56:41.654 --> 01:56:45.334
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully we'll be able to get some scores, some points on the board there.

01:56:45.854 --> 01:56:49.155
[SPEAKER_03]: I see Monty Boggs has participated in Pinball FX.

01:56:49.715 --> 01:56:52.015
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully we'll get some more representation there in the big battle.

01:56:52.055 --> 01:56:53.676
[SPEAKER_03]: You have until Friday the 16th.

01:56:53.756 --> 01:56:55.216
[SPEAKER_03]: July 16th is last day.

01:56:55.236 --> 01:56:55.816
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is that Saturday?

01:56:56.716 --> 01:56:57.136
[SPEAKER_03]: Do my math.

01:56:57.156 --> 01:56:57.396
[SPEAKER_03]: Friday.

01:56:57.416 --> 01:56:57.736
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Friday.

01:56:57.756 --> 01:56:59.917
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have until Friday to get those scores in.

01:56:59.957 --> 01:57:00.557
[SPEAKER_03]: So make sure you...

01:57:01.537 --> 01:57:02.898
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, make sure you get in on the big battle.

01:57:25.095 --> 01:57:32.121
[SPEAKER_04]: and, you know, given the track record of Rockstar, I'm not going to try to speculate when they're going to release some of these.

01:57:32.361 --> 01:57:38.145
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, one we do know for sure is Legends and Killers, which is coming August 2010 for $10.

01:57:38.506 --> 01:57:53.297
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will feature nine new multiplayer map locations, eight new multiplayer characters, including some from Red Dead Revolver, new projectile weapon, the Tomahawk, and corresponding multiplayer and single-player challenges, and new achievements and trophies.

01:57:54.598 --> 01:58:05.221
[SPEAKER_04]: The next one is coming at a date yet to be determined, and it's called Liars and Cheats, and it'll also be for $10.

01:58:05.641 --> 01:58:15.223
[SPEAKER_04]: With that, it's going to include an attack and defend multiplayer competitive mode and challenges, new multiplayer horse races with mounted combat, which sounds cool,

01:58:16.324 --> 01:58:32.059
[SPEAKER_04]: Play as the heroes and the villains of Red Dead Redemption as well as 8 new multiplayer characters, multiplayer versions of Liar's Dice and Poker from the single player game, and a new weapon Explosive Rifle with corresponding multiplayer and single player challenges, new achievements and trophies.

01:58:33.900 --> 01:58:34.060
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

01:58:34.861 --> 01:58:46.964
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, the third expansion would be Free Roam, which includes additional free roam challenges, new action areas and defensive placements, posse scoring and leaderboards, and new anti-griefing measures in free mode.

01:58:47.965 --> 01:58:49.485
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's coming later on.

01:58:49.945 --> 01:58:52.126
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what game would not be awesome without...

01:58:52.706 --> 01:59:18.446
[SPEAKER_04]: Zombies, Undead Nightmare New single player adventure, challenges and quests 8 new multiplayer zombie characters Additional animals to hunt I can only hope there are zombie animals And new dynamic events and more Hopefully more shotguns Every zombie hunter knows a good shotgun goes far Other fun stuff

01:59:20.583 --> 01:59:21.924
[SPEAKER_04]: We may have talked about this a little bit.

01:59:21.944 --> 01:59:23.065
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I've mentioned it before.

01:59:23.786 --> 01:59:32.354
[SPEAKER_04]: The Mega Man 8-bit Deathmatch, which was a mod for Doom 2, has now been released in demo form and is available to the public.

01:59:32.914 --> 01:59:42.183
[SPEAKER_04]: This new mod, of course, kind of reskins Doom with the wonderful 8-bit sprites and includes different Mega Man power-ups as well.

01:59:43.144 --> 01:59:44.345
[SPEAKER_04]: You can find this...

01:59:46.106 --> 01:59:56.832
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, at, uh, HTTP, uh, let's see, cutandstuff.net slash blog slash, uh, question mark, P equals 2218.

01:59:56.932 --> 01:59:57.712
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it's probably one.

01:59:57.732 --> 01:59:59.393
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm sure everybody's writing that down real quick.

01:59:59.793 --> 02:00:04.356
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's, uh, the Cut and Stuff blog, and, uh, they've got a bunch of stuff.

02:00:04.476 --> 02:00:07.337
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you've been missing Mega Man Legends, this is as close as you're ever gonna get.

02:00:08.117 --> 02:00:09.098
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so, uh...

02:00:10.632 --> 02:00:11.092
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.

02:00:11.212 --> 02:00:11.813
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks pretty cool.

02:00:12.853 --> 02:00:17.015
[SPEAKER_04]: And then last but not least, we were talking about some PSP games before the break.

02:00:17.335 --> 02:00:22.258
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the PSP games that's coming out will actually be a port of Split Second.

02:00:22.978 --> 02:00:24.139
[SPEAKER_04]: And that'll be pretty awesome.

02:00:24.159 --> 02:00:28.601
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a cool racing game where you get to detonate a bunch of explosions and cause all sorts of mayhem.

02:00:29.481 --> 02:00:31.162
[SPEAKER_04]: And that'll be coming out this fall.

02:00:33.453 --> 02:00:36.316
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, yet another port on its way to PSP.

02:00:36.637 --> 02:00:37.017
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy that.

02:00:37.898 --> 02:00:39.440
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I got some quick stuff for you too.

02:00:39.500 --> 02:00:41.603
[SPEAKER_03]: Dragon Age 2, finally some details on that.

02:00:41.643 --> 02:00:44.546
[SPEAKER_03]: It was missing from E3, but it's dated for March 2011.

02:00:44.666 --> 02:00:52.195
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of conflicting to the February 1st, 2011 date that was in the Dragon Age Origins Awakening, but hey, at least it's kind of close.

02:00:52.575 --> 02:00:54.356
[SPEAKER_03]: March 2011 is when this is coming out.

02:00:54.696 --> 02:00:56.357
[SPEAKER_03]: Big, big change from the first game.

02:00:57.117 --> 02:00:59.718
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be playing as one character named Hawk.

02:00:59.838 --> 02:01:02.279
[SPEAKER_03]: And that could be either a male or a female.

02:01:02.599 --> 02:01:07.121
[SPEAKER_03]: But no more of this like origin story and all this other stuff that the first Dragon Age had.

02:01:07.202 --> 02:01:10.343
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're basically going to be this one character, be it male or female.

02:01:10.483 --> 02:01:12.964
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Hawk, like Mass Effect where you're Commander Shepard.

02:01:12.984 --> 02:01:13.604
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Commander Shepard.

02:01:13.624 --> 02:01:14.905
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my favorite story in the Citadel.

02:01:15.245 --> 02:01:15.685
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

02:01:15.745 --> 02:01:17.446
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of the same type of thing.

02:01:17.926 --> 02:01:24.548
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess they're trying to do that to make more cinematic type of stuff where they can kind of involve Hawk in the cinematics.

02:01:24.848 --> 02:01:26.488
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually address you by name.

02:01:26.728 --> 02:01:27.248
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

02:01:27.688 --> 02:01:31.790
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's their big plans for the game.

02:01:32.070 --> 02:01:32.930
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that could be good.

02:01:34.450 --> 02:01:42.793
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like that some folks are suggesting you could name your character like Hudson Hawk or Ethan Hawk or all these others.

02:01:42.813 --> 02:01:44.453
[SPEAKER_02]: Hudson Hawk is good, just not Mike.

02:01:45.638 --> 02:01:45.958
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:48.600
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I don't know.

02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:49.801
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the first game.

02:01:49.861 --> 02:01:51.803
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious kind of how the second game is going to play out.

02:01:51.863 --> 02:01:53.684
[SPEAKER_03]: That definitely is a radical shift, though.

02:01:53.724 --> 02:01:58.728
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the first being a little more open in the first game really kind of drew a lot of people to that.

02:01:58.788 --> 02:02:00.109
[SPEAKER_03]: But I still think it'll be cool.

02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.590
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:02:22.699 --> 02:02:24.681
[SPEAKER_03]: They kinda have to have a game to rate it.

02:02:48.228 --> 02:03:15.474
[SPEAKER_03]: but do you remember we were talking on this show before about the NBA Jam catchphrase competition and folks can submit their own catchphrases well it's Boom Shaka Laka well that's already in the game but you have to come up with the next Boom Shaka Laka and these are the I guess the four that made it into the game I think objection sustained when you get a block shot no shoot for you

02:03:16.574 --> 02:03:17.094
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.

02:03:19.256 --> 02:03:22.498
[SPEAKER_03]: And the survey says denied on a block.

02:03:22.858 --> 02:03:24.960
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I have no idea where this one comes from.

02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:27.381
[SPEAKER_03]: Bangalangadooda for a dunk.

02:03:27.862 --> 02:03:28.542
[SPEAKER_03]: Say what?

02:03:28.902 --> 02:03:29.823
[SPEAKER_03]: Bangalangadooda.

02:03:33.092 --> 02:03:35.653
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably from the same place that Boom Shakalaka came from?

02:03:35.693 --> 02:03:36.133
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

02:03:36.193 --> 02:03:37.093
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like the sequel.

02:03:37.633 --> 02:03:38.154
[SPEAKER_03]: The Reject?

02:03:38.194 --> 02:03:41.815
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to hear a little song made out of Boom Shakalaka and Banga Langa Doodah.

02:03:42.955 --> 02:03:45.236
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like the singers in an 80s hair band.

02:03:45.276 --> 02:03:45.576
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

02:03:45.956 --> 02:03:47.276
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

02:03:47.476 --> 02:03:48.577
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like Sha Na Na.

02:03:49.941 --> 02:03:54.264
[SPEAKER_03]: A little more information is coming out about the Michael Jackson-based video game.

02:03:54.324 --> 02:03:57.126
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be called Michael Jackson The Experience.

02:03:58.127 --> 02:04:04.111
[SPEAKER_03]: And you will actually be able to play as Michael Jackson and you get to relive his iconic performances.

02:04:04.531 --> 02:04:07.453
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would be using the Move, the Connect, or the Wii.

02:04:07.753 --> 02:04:10.755
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're basically going to dance along with the prompts on the screen.

02:04:10.815 --> 02:04:13.617
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also sing along on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.

02:04:14.197 --> 02:04:16.739
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use the Connect's built-in mic to do this.

02:04:17.139 --> 02:04:19.721
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also going to be DS and PSP versions of this game.

02:04:20.141 --> 02:04:21.202
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be tapping.

02:04:21.462 --> 02:04:22.823
[SPEAKER_03]: Think Elite Beat Agents.

02:04:23.164 --> 02:04:23.784
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of cool.

02:04:24.164 --> 02:04:26.907
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out in November if you want to check this game out.

02:04:26.947 --> 02:04:30.690
[SPEAKER_03]: And boy would I pay a lot of money for YouTubes of Loki playing this game.

02:04:31.210 --> 02:04:34.393
[SPEAKER_02]: We've already had a good Michael Jackson based game.

02:04:34.473 --> 02:04:36.014
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called Moonwalker.

02:04:37.095 --> 02:04:38.036
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you said a good game.

02:04:39.417 --> 02:04:41.078
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a good game.

02:04:41.118 --> 02:04:42.559
[SPEAKER_03]: Depends what system you played it on.

02:04:42.619 --> 02:04:44.160
[SPEAKER_03]: Depends what system you played it on.

02:04:44.180 --> 02:04:44.361
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

02:04:44.961 --> 02:04:45.421
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

02:04:46.642 --> 02:04:46.843
[SPEAKER_03]: I would...

02:04:48.456 --> 02:04:49.057
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

02:05:07.300 --> 02:05:11.382
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we have some definite news in our music games.

02:05:12.082 --> 02:05:22.266
[SPEAKER_12]: We have for a rock band, we've got stuff by Sweet Billy Pilgrim.

02:05:23.126 --> 02:05:26.928
[SPEAKER_12]: We have Get Out, he's a rocker, Orange Amber.

02:05:28.379 --> 02:05:29.940
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, that's the Vines Pack.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:31.081
[SPEAKER_12]: My apologies, my apologies.

02:05:31.942 --> 02:05:39.529
[SPEAKER_12]: For the Vines Pack, we have Get Out, He's a Rocker, Orange Amber, Out of the Way, and Ride, and then Sweet Billy Pilgrim, Future Perfect Tense.

02:05:40.970 --> 02:05:45.414
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course, these are basically Buck 99 a piece.

02:05:47.776 --> 02:05:48.257
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo, Buck 99!

02:05:49.802 --> 02:06:03.896
[SPEAKER_12]: And for DJ Hero, we actually have some good news that the sales are up to 1.2 million units That's pretty good, even though I've seen them clearance at Fry's Well, so much for all y'all who said it was a flop You know what it took?

02:06:04.196 --> 02:06:10.382
[SPEAKER_12]: Price reduction But it was actually considered the best-selling IP of 2009 by Revenue

02:06:12.421 --> 02:06:16.323
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the key word is by revenue because they're like a hundred and something dollars each.

02:06:17.324 --> 02:06:18.065
[SPEAKER_03]: Way to spin those lyrics.

02:06:18.205 --> 02:06:22.187
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't really start selling until it had a big price drop and then it started selling.

02:06:22.247 --> 02:06:27.090
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, at least they've figured it out for the next release so they're not going to be charging quite as much.

02:06:27.170 --> 02:06:29.732
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a little bit more like Guitar Hero prices.

02:06:30.492 --> 02:06:31.373
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still expensive.

02:06:32.321 --> 02:06:37.243
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, speaking of Guitar Hero, we actually do have download music for Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero.

02:06:38.064 --> 02:06:43.546
[SPEAKER_12]: We have the Queen 2 track pack, which is a crazy little thing called Love, Killer Queen, and Somebody to Love.

02:06:45.127 --> 02:06:47.288
[SPEAKER_12]: That's on July, well, it's already out then, July 6th.

02:06:47.388 --> 02:06:51.090
[SPEAKER_12]: July 13th, Avenged Sevenfold, Afterlife, Almost Easy, and Scream.

02:06:51.110 --> 02:06:55.652
[SPEAKER_12]: July 20th, Disturbed track pack, Down with the Sickness, Stricken, Indestructible, whatever.

02:06:57.593 --> 02:07:22.323
[SPEAKER_12]: that's my impression of Disturbed except for the really good cover I thought it was give this guy a lozenge is what it is except they did a really good cover of Land of Confusion really good song and then Shinedown on July 27th with Devour, Second Chance, Sound of Madness all I heard was Queen and everything after that was blah blah blah

02:07:22.808 --> 02:07:23.409
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

02:07:23.650 --> 02:07:24.431
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a queen.

02:07:25.453 --> 02:07:25.774
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:07:26.395 --> 02:07:31.363
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's it for the Rapid Fire News, then I think it might be time for us to get into some Twitter topics.

02:07:34.565 --> 02:07:35.405
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

02:07:54.193 --> 02:07:55.014
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this one.

02:07:55.054 --> 02:07:56.615
[SPEAKER_03]: This has to do with Google.

02:07:56.655 --> 02:08:00.138
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had no idea about this until TigerClock kind of linked this.

02:08:00.559 --> 02:08:04.762
[SPEAKER_03]: And this has to do with a big investment that Google made in Zynga.

02:08:06.118 --> 02:08:20.063
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, according to this report, and I'm reading from Gamasutra here, Google quietly invested between $100 million and $200 million in Zynga as part of its preparation to launch Google Games later this year.

02:08:20.723 --> 02:08:23.104
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, Google's got to get all up on everything.

02:08:23.424 --> 02:08:26.326
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever happened to Google's philosophy of don't be evil?

02:08:28.126 --> 02:08:30.567
[SPEAKER_02]: Google, Zynga, no

02:08:56.639 --> 02:09:04.682
[SPEAKER_03]: What's interesting, though, that doesn't necessarily mean you're just going to have Farmville, Frontierville, and Fishville, and What the Fuckville all on Google Games.

02:09:05.062 --> 02:09:06.223
[SPEAKER_03]: I love What the Fuckville.

02:09:07.203 --> 02:09:07.944
[SPEAKER_03]: Stripperville.

02:09:08.004 --> 02:09:09.304
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wouldn't play Stripperville?

02:09:09.564 --> 02:09:10.265
[SPEAKER_03]: Hornville.

02:09:11.385 --> 02:09:12.385
[SPEAKER_03]: Needs bounce houses.

02:09:12.665 --> 02:09:18.028
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe there will be new games that come onto Google Games.

02:09:18.088 --> 02:09:18.468
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

02:09:21.397 --> 02:09:28.185
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's anyone that they would want to invest in, you know, better options, I would say, I don't know, Congregate?

02:09:30.127 --> 02:09:31.349
[SPEAKER_02]: Much better place, you know.

02:09:31.669 --> 02:09:33.792
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm just saying... Much better developers, too.

02:09:34.433 --> 02:09:35.975
[SPEAKER_03]: How many freaking people were playing FarmVille?

02:09:36.115 --> 02:09:36.676
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot.

02:09:37.356 --> 02:09:38.538
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people.

02:09:38.578 --> 02:09:39.879
[SPEAKER_03]: More than were playing WoW, right?

02:09:40.660 --> 02:09:44.624
[SPEAKER_03]: Hate if you want, but it's just like hating on the Wii.

02:09:45.005 --> 02:09:46.346
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hate it all you want.

02:09:46.747 --> 02:09:49.390
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, it's still the most popular selling system.

02:09:50.331 --> 02:09:51.732
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a fact.

02:09:52.053 --> 02:09:55.076
[SPEAKER_03]: Facebook isn't even a gaming system.

02:09:55.577 --> 02:09:58.260
[SPEAKER_03]: But more people play games there.

02:09:58.780 --> 02:09:59.561
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just how it is.

02:10:15.602 --> 02:10:42.570
[SPEAKER_03]: I work with a lot of people that play these games a lot of co-workers but you know they don't really know the video games I play it's just I don't know crazy I'd be very curious to see how this all plays out though with Google games because of the fact that you know Google has this philosophy of don't be evil but then again Buzz was kind of evil they made some horrible missteps with Buzz I wish internet companies would just learn their freaking lesson with privacy don't you

02:10:44.073 --> 02:10:45.494
[SPEAKER_03]: One more from Tigerclaw for us.

02:10:46.414 --> 02:10:47.495
[SPEAKER_03]: As I want to mention this.

02:10:47.575 --> 02:10:48.375
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve Wiebe.

02:10:48.915 --> 02:10:49.556
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember him?

02:10:49.856 --> 02:10:50.636
[SPEAKER_03]: The King of Kong?

02:10:50.676 --> 02:10:51.217
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I do.

02:10:51.237 --> 02:10:51.977
[SPEAKER_12]: Did he finally get it?

02:10:52.657 --> 02:10:55.259
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, but he got something else that's pretty cool.

02:10:55.739 --> 02:10:58.600
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to be inducted into the International Video Game Hall of Fame.

02:10:58.740 --> 02:10:59.141
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

02:10:59.521 --> 02:11:03.883
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't forget, it's that doctor or dentist guy, Hank Chien, has it now.

02:11:03.943 --> 02:11:04.903
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even Billy Mitchell.

02:11:04.924 --> 02:11:08.405
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember a few months ago we had that doctor or dentist or whatever?

02:11:08.505 --> 02:11:09.646
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the King of Kong now.

02:11:10.086 --> 02:11:11.228
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve Wiebe, Otumwa, Iowa

02:11:30.491 --> 02:11:32.193
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even pronounce this name.

02:11:32.233 --> 02:11:34.414
[SPEAKER_03]: But you may have heard of this city before.

02:11:34.474 --> 02:11:37.316
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where they're trying to build the International Video Game Hall of Fame.

02:11:37.657 --> 02:11:41.479
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to make this place like the video game capital or whatever.

02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:43.981
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't remember all the stories behind it.

02:11:44.001 --> 02:11:47.644
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was like a really famous photo shoot back in the 80s that took place there.

02:11:47.664 --> 02:11:48.544
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember hearing about.

02:11:49.185 --> 02:11:49.966
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know.

02:11:50.026 --> 02:11:50.186
[SPEAKER_03]: Just...

02:11:50.786 --> 02:11:56.250
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just because no one's claimed it yet, so this town that has nobody, there's no reason to go there.

02:11:56.270 --> 02:11:57.652
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's a story behind it.

02:11:57.912 --> 02:12:04.397
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there is, and I don't care what it is, but I refuse to believe that you're going to be the capital of game.

02:12:04.497 --> 02:12:05.298
[SPEAKER_03]: A chatter will fill me in.

02:12:05.318 --> 02:12:10.962
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the part I remember was that you can't even reach it unless it's like a three-hour drive from a nearby airport.

02:12:11.062 --> 02:12:13.144
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's something else.

02:12:13.404 --> 02:12:14.445
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Iowa, folks.

02:12:16.099 --> 02:12:19.441
[SPEAKER_03]: Someday I will make claim to that same thing and do it better.

02:12:19.921 --> 02:12:22.722
[SPEAKER_03]: Monty Boggs says that's inside the International House of Pancakes.

02:12:23.163 --> 02:12:25.123
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it's the International House of Gaming.

02:12:26.944 --> 02:12:29.485
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisbee asks, isn't that the home of Twin Galaxies?

02:12:30.306 --> 02:12:30.986
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be.

02:12:31.446 --> 02:12:32.527
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be the connection.

02:12:32.567 --> 02:12:33.147
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.

02:12:33.567 --> 02:12:35.748
[SPEAKER_03]: I always thought the guy from Twin Galaxies had an office.

02:12:37.089 --> 02:12:39.470
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why Pennsylvania jumps out of my mind, but it does.

02:12:40.163 --> 02:12:42.446
[SPEAKER_03]: or somewhere in Silicon Valley at least, I don't know.

02:12:43.026 --> 02:12:48.452
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, SpongeTwang sends us a tweet clarifying some stuff about the big battle.

02:12:48.492 --> 02:12:51.836
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently the Battlefield Bad Company 2 competition was rescheduled.

02:12:52.476 --> 02:12:57.001
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, he has noticed a Super Street Fighter 4 banner has leaked its way into the rotation.

02:12:57.041 --> 02:13:00.124
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if Derek just hasn't announced anything yet, but it looks like...

02:13:01.005 --> 02:13:03.007
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Street Fighter 4 Super Street Fighter 4 Super Street Fighter 4

02:13:25.146 --> 02:13:27.767
[SPEAKER_03]: S21 Under Matt says he thinks it's the hometown of Walter Day.

02:13:27.887 --> 02:13:31.969
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, why does that make it the capital of video?

02:13:32.189 --> 02:13:32.669
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, whatever.

02:13:32.709 --> 02:13:33.670
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a whole other rant.

02:13:35.570 --> 02:13:40.672
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuyaLastTweet says, Since I didn't hear anything in Part A, thoughts on DDRX2AC?

02:13:42.871 --> 02:13:42.971
[SPEAKER_03]: L.E.D.

02:13:43.031 --> 02:13:44.373
[SPEAKER_03]: remixed some of the Dance Mania songs

02:14:05.672 --> 02:14:09.417
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of neat, but I hate to say it, I'm kind of over DDR.

02:14:09.977 --> 02:14:13.922
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm more interested in Dance Masters at this point and Dance Central.

02:14:14.743 --> 02:14:15.824
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know.

02:14:16.645 --> 02:14:18.027
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me away, I think I might catch that.

02:14:20.329 --> 02:14:23.433
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR just hasn't been interesting for a little while.

02:14:23.573 --> 02:14:24.034
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry!

02:14:24.554 --> 02:14:25.576
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of how I feel.

02:14:27.634 --> 02:14:32.675
[SPEAKER_03]: I played the, um, um, I can't even think of the name of the damn game.

02:14:33.595 --> 02:14:35.836
[SPEAKER_03]: The Korean push the screen game.

02:14:35.976 --> 02:14:37.176
[SPEAKER_03]: No, push the screen game.

02:14:37.616 --> 02:14:39.577
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Max, Technica, that's it.

02:14:40.857 --> 02:14:44.178
[SPEAKER_03]: I played that and that's more interesting to me right now than DDR, sorry.

02:14:45.198 --> 02:14:46.619
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's it for Twitter topics.

02:14:46.639 --> 02:14:49.819
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to send us some tweets in the future, twitter.com slash OLR.

02:14:49.940 --> 02:14:51.760
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, back to the news, Loki.

02:14:53.294 --> 02:14:56.757
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, soon you'll be able to get some anime on your Xbox.

02:14:57.497 --> 02:15:02.121
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently Microsoft is teaming up with the video streaming portal Crunchyroll.

02:15:03.042 --> 02:15:11.049
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently the expansion is going to be a partnership with Microsoft for the Zune Marketplace.

02:15:11.809 --> 02:15:15.772
[SPEAKER_04]: And this will bring popular anime titles such as The Melancholy of...

02:15:17.013 --> 02:15:25.356
[SPEAKER_04]: Haruhi Suzumiya, and Giant Killing to the Xbox 360, Zune HD, and Windows PCs.

02:15:26.496 --> 02:15:28.737
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of neat.

02:15:28.777 --> 02:15:32.138
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess Giant Killing is notable because it's airing in Japan right now.

02:15:34.150 --> 02:15:39.375
[SPEAKER_04]: And this will be the first time these titles have been available for digital download purchase.

02:15:40.776 --> 02:15:45.880
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting, because doesn't the PS3 have a huge anime library with it?

02:15:46.361 --> 02:15:49.263
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they do have some anime on there.

02:15:49.644 --> 02:15:56.650
[SPEAKER_02]: I could have sworn they tried testing it out with Queen's Blade and then didn't realize it was such an adult-themed anime.

02:15:57.330 --> 02:15:58.512
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw that story, too.

02:15:59.192 --> 02:15:59.953
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.

02:16:01.312 --> 02:16:02.955
[SPEAKER_03]: Did this news come out of Anime Expo?

02:16:02.995 --> 02:16:10.006
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know that was a huge thing that just happened this last week, and maybe that's where some of this is coming from, but I don't know.

02:16:11.143 --> 02:16:14.745
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't watch a lot of anime, so I feel so apathetic about this.

02:16:15.345 --> 02:16:17.226
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything you guys in chat?

02:16:17.246 --> 02:16:18.266
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you guys excited about this?

02:16:18.306 --> 02:16:18.786
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking here.

02:16:18.826 --> 02:16:24.769
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com Ranma says, I don't support bootleg streaming sites.

02:16:26.850 --> 02:16:27.310
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

02:16:28.451 --> 02:16:29.791
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're talking about some other stuff.

02:16:29.871 --> 02:16:31.732
[SPEAKER_03]: The iPhone apps and all that stuff.

02:16:34.835 --> 02:16:39.157
[SPEAKER_03]: Ramakun says all the anime from ADV Films is on Netflix via streaming.

02:16:39.798 --> 02:16:41.838
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another way you can get your anime.

02:16:41.938 --> 02:16:43.779
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, unless you were talking about Crunchyroll.

02:16:43.859 --> 02:16:44.520
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't go there.

02:16:44.540 --> 02:16:45.340
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't really know.

02:16:47.108 --> 02:16:47.408
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:16:48.469 --> 02:16:55.255
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, not to go too far back into the past, but I always say this wrong, and Drunami will correct me.

02:16:55.335 --> 02:16:56.716
[SPEAKER_03]: Kamara in chat?

02:16:56.956 --> 02:16:57.337
[SPEAKER_03]: Kamara.

02:16:57.457 --> 02:17:03.381
[SPEAKER_03]: Kamara in chat posts this little cut and paste about...

02:17:04.162 --> 02:17:05.603
[SPEAKER_03]: Otumwa, Iowa.

02:17:06.204 --> 02:17:19.614
[SPEAKER_03]: As the home of Twin Galaxies, so you guys are right, Otumwa was officially proclaimed the video game capital of the world by a mayoral decree issued on November 30th, 1982 by Otumwa Mayor Jerry Parker.

02:17:20.114 --> 02:17:25.900
[SPEAKER_03]: As a result of this most unusual distinction, the city was officially recognized and congratulated by U.S.

02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:27.622
[SPEAKER_03]: Senator Charles Grassley.

02:17:28.042 --> 02:17:34.108
[SPEAKER_03]: In connection with this proclamation, the city hosted the first North American Video Game Olympics in the fall of 1982.

02:17:34.368 --> 02:17:40.975
[SPEAKER_12]: That'd be like me standing on my house and saying that this is the laminate flooring capital of the world.

02:17:42.316 --> 02:17:52.222
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, this is just a bunch of old fat guys sticking the flag in the ground saying I claim this in the name of Spain.

02:17:52.582 --> 02:17:53.083
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

02:17:53.183 --> 02:17:54.363
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a flag?

02:17:54.523 --> 02:17:56.385
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to check the calendar.

02:17:56.445 --> 02:17:57.745
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it 1982 still?

02:17:57.846 --> 02:17:58.386
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it is not 1982.

02:17:58.486 --> 02:17:59.847
[SPEAKER_03]: It is now the year 2010.

02:17:59.907 --> 02:18:01.268
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

02:18:01.328 --> 02:18:04.430
[SPEAKER_03]: This old fat guy, I'm going to make a proclamation right now.

02:18:05.660 --> 02:18:11.783
[SPEAKER_03]: I hereby rescind that title from however the fuck you pronounce it, Otumwa, Iowa.

02:18:12.244 --> 02:18:15.646
[SPEAKER_03]: I hereby rescind your title.

02:18:16.086 --> 02:18:18.627
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Vuvuzelas agree with me in the grand stance.

02:18:18.727 --> 02:18:20.868
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I make a counter-declaration.

02:18:21.008 --> 02:18:21.469
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, what?

02:18:21.969 --> 02:18:25.551
[SPEAKER_02]: I declare this room to be the gaming podcast capital of the world.

02:18:27.590 --> 02:18:28.371
[SPEAKER_12]: I second that.

02:18:28.591 --> 02:18:35.276
[SPEAKER_03]: I hereby declare Orange Lounge Radio the official video game podcast of the galaxy.

02:18:35.997 --> 02:18:36.597
[SPEAKER_12]: Woohoo!

02:18:36.778 --> 02:18:37.038
[SPEAKER_03]: See?

02:18:37.078 --> 02:18:37.518
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

02:18:37.598 --> 02:18:38.019
[SPEAKER_03]: It works.

02:18:38.839 --> 02:18:39.820
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we're all analysts.

02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:43.443
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is the official video game podcast of the galaxy.

02:18:43.803 --> 02:18:44.184
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

02:18:44.784 --> 02:18:45.064
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree.

02:18:45.304 --> 02:18:46.465
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've written it in decree.

02:18:46.485 --> 02:18:47.867
[SPEAKER_03]: Does somebody have something I can sign?

02:18:48.127 --> 02:18:48.707
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone put it.

02:18:49.108 --> 02:18:49.588
[SPEAKER_03]: A decree.

02:18:49.608 --> 02:18:50.429
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

02:18:50.449 --> 02:18:51.229
[SPEAKER_03]: Write on that paper.

02:18:51.389 --> 02:18:51.930
[SPEAKER_03]: Decree.

02:18:52.230 --> 02:18:53.511
[SPEAKER_03]: We have it seconded.

02:18:53.531 --> 02:18:54.332
[SPEAKER_02]: We have it witnessed.

02:18:54.532 --> 02:18:55.533
[SPEAKER_02]: Now put it up on the wiki.

02:18:56.073 --> 02:19:25.215
[SPEAKER_03]: and then you're going to put it on the pictures thing on Orange Lounge so everybody knows Orange Lounge Radio is the official video game podcast of the galaxy because if some schmo can do this for his hometown in bumfuck Iowa it's the video game capital of the world then this schmo is going to make his own decrees Iowa is not the capital of anything other than boredom and whatever agriculture they have there

02:19:26.457 --> 02:19:26.958
[SPEAKER_03]: and porn.

02:19:26.978 --> 02:19:28.360
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan's yelling porn from the living room.

02:19:28.961 --> 02:19:29.983
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's L.A.

02:19:34.010 --> 02:19:34.331
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:19:36.758 --> 02:19:37.258
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you are.

02:19:37.778 --> 02:19:39.499
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I'm holding up the show here.

02:19:39.599 --> 02:19:40.599
[SPEAKER_03]: Live radio, folks.

02:19:40.899 --> 02:19:41.179
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

02:19:41.559 --> 02:19:42.760
[SPEAKER_02]: This is awesome radio right here.

02:19:42.780 --> 02:19:42.920
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

02:19:42.940 --> 02:19:43.800
[SPEAKER_03]: This is awesome radio.

02:19:43.820 --> 02:19:44.080
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:44.900
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura's writing.

02:19:45.140 --> 02:19:45.780
[SPEAKER_03]: Decree.

02:19:46.300 --> 02:19:49.281
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is the official podcast.

02:19:49.641 --> 02:19:51.882
[SPEAKER_03]: She didn't even bother to put video game podcast.

02:19:51.902 --> 02:19:52.862
[SPEAKER_03]: She just put podcast.

02:19:53.402 --> 02:19:54.542
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the official podcast.

02:19:54.582 --> 02:19:55.663
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, she wrote it in.

02:19:59.764 --> 02:20:00.324
[SPEAKER_03]: She can do that.

02:20:00.384 --> 02:20:00.824
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

02:20:02.632 --> 02:20:07.254
[SPEAKER_04]: This is as legit, if not more legit, than their declaration.

02:20:07.294 --> 02:20:07.934
[SPEAKER_12]: I know a notary.

02:20:09.055 --> 02:20:10.355
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shit.

02:20:11.176 --> 02:20:12.516
[SPEAKER_12]: I would get this notarized.

02:20:13.216 --> 02:20:15.177
[SPEAKER_03]: Drunami, can you be a notary?

02:20:15.997 --> 02:20:16.998
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I mean, I know a real notary.

02:20:17.298 --> 02:20:17.498
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you?

02:20:17.578 --> 02:20:18.518
[SPEAKER_12]: Can we get this notarized?

02:20:18.639 --> 02:20:18.999
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably.

02:20:19.119 --> 02:20:19.399
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

02:20:20.239 --> 02:20:21.079
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, shit.

02:20:23.641 --> 02:20:24.621
[SPEAKER_04]: We need press releases.

02:20:30.001 --> 02:20:31.503
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone whip up a press release.

02:20:32.264 --> 02:20:34.205
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be on Kotaku in a few days.

02:20:34.225 --> 02:20:40.392
[SPEAKER_12]: This is going to be our official copy, but you know I'm going to have to do a nice designed one with little stars and pink hearts.

02:20:42.734 --> 02:20:44.295
[SPEAKER_04]: And a unicorn jumping across it.

02:20:46.037 --> 02:20:48.059
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you press a button, it plays always.

02:20:49.941 --> 02:20:51.342
[SPEAKER_04]: And then put at the bottom, P.S.

02:20:51.463 --> 02:20:53.344
[SPEAKER_04]: We also rescind the claim to...

02:20:55.174 --> 02:20:57.335
[SPEAKER_03]: I signed it with my left hand so you know I'm serious.

02:20:59.835 --> 02:21:00.415
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

02:21:00.555 --> 02:21:01.296
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have to sign that too?

02:21:01.316 --> 02:21:01.776
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you do.

02:21:01.836 --> 02:21:03.356
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to sign it as Loki.

02:21:04.496 --> 02:21:05.317
[SPEAKER_03]: It's official decree.

02:21:05.337 --> 02:21:06.217
[SPEAKER_12]: How about Jamie S?

02:21:06.637 --> 02:21:07.157
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

02:21:07.717 --> 02:21:09.217
[SPEAKER_12]: Because they can't get my whole name.

02:21:10.998 --> 02:21:13.659
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100 Matt says notarize it and frame it in the studio.

02:21:14.339 --> 02:21:16.179
[SPEAKER_12]: And then our witness.

02:21:16.439 --> 02:21:17.720
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to do a witness thing.

02:21:17.740 --> 02:21:18.680
[SPEAKER_12]: And you should just sign with an X.

02:21:21.867 --> 02:21:22.388
[SPEAKER_03]: I see how it is.

02:21:22.428 --> 02:21:23.008
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm chopped liver.

02:21:23.648 --> 02:21:25.009
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew Nami is our official witness.

02:21:27.150 --> 02:21:27.450
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:21:28.170 --> 02:21:28.590
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

02:21:30.111 --> 02:21:30.411
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:21:30.811 --> 02:21:31.231
[SPEAKER_03]: It's official.

02:21:31.271 --> 02:21:33.352
[SPEAKER_12]: Written in silver Sharpie.

02:21:33.472 --> 02:21:34.092
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right.

02:21:34.232 --> 02:21:36.813
[SPEAKER_03]: Official video game podcast of the galaxy.

02:21:37.034 --> 02:21:38.234
[SPEAKER_12]: On torn out notebook paper.

02:21:38.594 --> 02:21:38.874
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

02:21:38.894 --> 02:21:42.996
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize to the other hardworking video game podcasters out there.

02:21:43.036 --> 02:21:44.377
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you guys do great work.

02:21:44.537 --> 02:21:47.318
[SPEAKER_04]: But you just didn't think of it first.

02:21:47.438 --> 02:21:50.139
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in the style of Otumwa, whatever, Iowa.

02:21:52.669 --> 02:21:53.510
[SPEAKER_03]: We just beat you to it.

02:21:53.530 --> 02:21:53.970
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

02:21:54.770 --> 02:22:06.116
[SPEAKER_04]: We should figure out whether Capital or like, you know, hell, we could like corner the market in waffles or something, you know, the official home of waffle lovers or the, you know.

02:22:06.436 --> 02:22:06.876
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, wait.

02:22:07.076 --> 02:22:11.939
[SPEAKER_03]: Amiga777 in chat says, serious guy, tits or get the fuck out.

02:22:12.239 --> 02:22:16.161
[SPEAKER_03]: So DarkSakura, if you wouldn't mind, just kiss the paper with your boobs.

02:22:18.362 --> 02:22:19.542
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kiss the paper with your boobs.

02:22:19.902 --> 02:22:20.283
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

02:22:20.303 --> 02:22:20.543
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

02:22:21.818 --> 02:22:22.318
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hi, Dan.

02:22:22.518 --> 02:22:23.039
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing?

02:22:23.759 --> 02:22:24.099
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit.

02:22:24.659 --> 02:22:25.359
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan just walked in.

02:22:25.399 --> 02:22:26.480
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, how's it going, Dan?

02:22:26.580 --> 02:22:27.120
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, did you hear?

02:22:27.140 --> 02:22:30.482
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear Atuma, Iowa used to have a hell of an arcade.

02:22:30.682 --> 02:22:34.043
[SPEAKER_03]: You are guesting on the official video game podcast of the galaxy.

02:22:34.063 --> 02:22:34.743
[SPEAKER_03]: Of the galaxy.

02:22:34.823 --> 02:22:35.504
[SPEAKER_03]: Of the galaxy.

02:22:37.684 --> 02:22:40.886
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently the laminate floor capital of the world.

02:22:41.966 --> 02:22:43.787
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't stand on the house and declare it yet.

02:22:44.407 --> 02:22:46.248
[SPEAKER_07]: Our laminate floor is awesome.

02:22:46.756 --> 02:22:47.597
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesomely dirty.

02:22:47.617 --> 02:22:48.078
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

02:22:48.118 --> 02:22:50.601
[SPEAKER_12]: Because someone dripped margarita mix in the living room.

02:22:50.761 --> 02:22:51.482
[SPEAKER_07]: Get to mopping.

02:22:52.704 --> 02:22:53.565
[SPEAKER_12]: You spilled it, dude.

02:22:53.625 --> 02:22:54.406
[SPEAKER_07]: With your hair.

02:22:55.408 --> 02:22:56.108
[SPEAKER_12]: Bite my butt.

02:22:56.169 --> 02:23:01.075
[SPEAKER_03]: The chat room is expressing major concern about Bobby and that we have taken the galaxy away from Bobby.

02:23:01.135 --> 02:23:01.676
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, look.

02:23:01.996 --> 02:23:03.859
[SPEAKER_12]: He can have the next galaxy over.

02:23:05.160 --> 02:23:07.963
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby can have... We will give Bobby Pluto.

02:23:08.323 --> 02:23:08.584
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?

02:23:08.924 --> 02:23:09.925
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby can have Pluto.

02:23:10.706 --> 02:23:11.827
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody loves Pluto.

02:23:11.907 --> 02:23:12.628
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a planet?

02:23:12.708 --> 02:23:13.188
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it not?

02:23:13.228 --> 02:23:13.929
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know.

02:23:14.149 --> 02:23:14.770
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't care.

02:23:14.890 --> 02:23:15.671
[SPEAKER_03]: It's yours, Bobby.

02:23:15.831 --> 02:23:16.431
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun with it.

02:23:16.472 --> 02:23:18.193
[SPEAKER_04]: He could have, you know, what is it?

02:23:18.213 --> 02:23:24.199
[SPEAKER_04]: The official video game radio show of... He can be...

02:23:29.378 --> 02:23:34.963
[SPEAKER_12]: If we are the podcast of it, he can have the voice of the galaxy.

02:23:35.183 --> 02:23:35.483
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:23:35.924 --> 02:23:40.048
[SPEAKER_03]: Monty Boggs says, congratulations to Orange Laundry for jumping the shark with such finesse.

02:23:40.328 --> 02:23:40.588
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

02:23:40.848 --> 02:23:42.650
[SPEAKER_03]: We did it with style.

02:23:42.790 --> 02:23:47.555
[SPEAKER_12]: This is going to stay at my desk so I can look at it every day and go, what the fuck were we thinking?

02:23:47.575 --> 02:23:48.175
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:23:48.856 --> 02:23:50.658
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to video game news.

02:23:52.443 --> 02:23:54.444
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had the what the hell are we doing moment.

02:23:55.865 --> 02:23:58.247
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, and I didn't even bother to cut it at the perforation.

02:23:58.287 --> 02:23:59.367
[SPEAKER_12]: I just pulled it right out of the book.

02:23:59.407 --> 02:24:00.068
[SPEAKER_12]: That's ghetto.

02:24:00.108 --> 02:24:04.050
[SPEAKER_03]: Tigerclaw says, Sky, for a second I thought you would say Bobby would have Uranus.

02:24:05.831 --> 02:24:08.073
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I can think of other podcasts that can have that.

02:24:08.413 --> 02:24:08.713
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:24:09.694 --> 02:24:10.654
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's move on.

02:24:12.275 --> 02:24:14.937
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to talk about, back to gaming news, I know, hard to believe.

02:24:15.277 --> 02:24:16.038
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about this.

02:24:16.078 --> 02:24:18.019
[SPEAKER_03]: This has to do with Connectimals.

02:24:18.766 --> 02:24:19.887
[SPEAKER_03]: Burger King Burger King Burger King

02:24:38.904 --> 02:24:47.393
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to actually get little stuffed animals that can be scanned by the Kinect's camera to create the same animal in the game.

02:24:47.854 --> 02:24:51.538
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can have them interact with your regular pet Kinectimal.

02:24:52.139 --> 02:24:52.900
[SPEAKER_03]: And there you go.

02:24:53.941 --> 02:24:59.385
[SPEAKER_03]: So instead of the BK games we were hearing about, now you're going to get little mini-Connectimals or whatever.

02:24:59.566 --> 02:25:06.732
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is, it's just going to be a little card that will easily be scanned and posted on the internet, so you don't even have to buy these.

02:25:07.512 --> 02:25:12.417
[SPEAKER_04]: If they were smart, since the Kinect can scan in objects, they should actually do the stuffed animal.

02:25:12.717 --> 02:25:14.979
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you'd have to actually have a picture of the stuffed animal.

02:25:17.133 --> 02:25:21.137
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, how long is it going to be though before there's just an internet page with all the barcodes?

02:25:22.759 --> 02:25:27.243
[SPEAKER_02]: So after you stuff your face with a triple whopper, you can go and move around a little bit on Kinect.

02:25:27.472 --> 02:25:28.853
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I love about this.

02:25:28.973 --> 02:25:34.657
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, at least it's Connectimals and not Dance Central, but that would crack me up if Dance Central had a tie-in with Burger King.

02:25:34.857 --> 02:25:39.180
[SPEAKER_12]: This was like the old barcode scanner games that were out in Japan, remember?

02:25:39.700 --> 02:25:47.886
[SPEAKER_12]: It was like one particular brand of ramen would make this ultimate monster, and everyone was buying out this one brand of ramen.

02:25:49.216 --> 02:26:09.081
[SPEAKER_04]: E-Reader for life they did the same thing with Viva Pinata and in fact people started hacking the actual codes and unlocked more animals they didn't give away stuff that wasn't in the game or at least it was in the game but never released for the game

02:26:11.044 --> 02:26:14.268
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting though, Microsoft is very aggressive with the marketing for this thing.

02:26:14.308 --> 02:26:16.350
[SPEAKER_03]: They really, really want it to take off.

02:26:16.590 --> 02:26:21.636
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Burger King, Macy's, and, you know, in their own stores.

02:26:22.056 --> 02:26:25.460
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas, you know, where's PlayStation Move advertising?

02:26:27.810 --> 02:26:28.390
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:26:58.214 --> 02:27:13.293
[SPEAKER_12]: appreciate that oh all our plushies alright so now you know what's official you're listening to the official video game podcast of the galaxy well Rock Band 3 has decided to do something nice for all those people who can't hold a tune to save their fucking life um

02:27:15.305 --> 02:27:24.567
[SPEAKER_12]: It, um, has, uh, harmonics and, uh, isotope, um, have, uh, done a real-time pitch correction.

02:27:24.587 --> 02:27:25.647
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, they have autotune.

02:27:26.707 --> 02:27:33.608
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, it's gonna put everybody into the right key when it plays through so that they don't sound like crap.

02:27:33.728 --> 02:27:41.629
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, what I want to do, I have this one friend who, I actually have a couple friends who are intensely tone-deaf enough that it makes my, um, my liver quiver.

02:27:42.710 --> 02:27:42.830
[SPEAKER_12]: Um.

02:27:43.210 --> 02:27:43.870
[SPEAKER_12]: That rhymed.

02:27:44.210 --> 02:27:44.490
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

02:27:46.110 --> 02:27:53.472
[SPEAKER_12]: But I would like to see if I actually can make these people who are so unbelievably tone deaf hold a key.

02:27:54.692 --> 02:27:57.093
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if anyone knows this little fact about me.

02:27:57.733 --> 02:28:03.895
[SPEAKER_12]: I hear perfect pitch and it drives me completely nuts because it's even worse when I sing and hear myself go out of tune.

02:28:05.956 --> 02:28:14.038
[SPEAKER_12]: Listening to somebody else go, just not being able to hold a tune makes me nauseous, literally nauseous.

02:28:15.796 --> 02:28:16.196
[SPEAKER_03]: Outro Music

02:28:41.738 --> 02:28:48.684
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, I think if you want to get really into the science of it and all, autotune is like a post-production thing, and this is a in-production thing.

02:28:48.724 --> 02:28:51.787
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, they're available in almost any recording studio.

02:28:53.228 --> 02:28:55.530
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, how come do you think some people just sound like crap live?

02:28:56.511 --> 02:28:59.093
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bummer, though, you're not going to be able to hear the voices over the internet.

02:28:59.133 --> 02:29:03.557
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, at the same time, maybe that's a blessing, but I think there's some people that wouldn't mind, you know, being able to sing.

02:29:04.077 --> 02:29:07.320
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that with the lag and the time and everything, it's probably not possible, but...

02:29:07.836 --> 02:29:12.680
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, what would be wrong with maybe having the singer start five seconds before the rest of the band?

02:29:12.980 --> 02:29:16.082
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess maybe with the scoring system it wouldn't really work out.

02:29:16.462 --> 02:29:18.544
[SPEAKER_03]: I really, though... Have the voice play on a replay.

02:29:20.005 --> 02:29:20.245
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

02:29:20.706 --> 02:29:24.829
[SPEAKER_12]: I really, though... I think it would be nice if this was an option that you could turn off.

02:29:25.649 --> 02:29:30.653
[SPEAKER_12]: But certainly, you know, I think that the option to turn it on should be on the other player's side.

02:29:31.153 --> 02:29:32.334
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're doing this on the internet.

02:29:33.155 --> 02:29:36.217
[SPEAKER_12]: For people like me, who can't stand to listen to people be out of tune.

02:29:36.963 --> 02:29:37.303
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

02:29:58.145 --> 02:30:12.667
[SPEAKER_03]: although you can always just do party chat and do it that way but you know true you know one little bit will be delayed it's it's because I've played rock band with a singer who didn't put their mic their regular mic on mute and it was delayed and it actually can really throw you off when you're trying to play guitar or something else

02:30:14.349 --> 02:30:28.583
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I had predicted for Rock Band 3 that didn't end up happening, or at least not yet anyway, was that they were going to go more the SingStar route of being able to share your performances and being able to have that community of your YouTube-esque sharing of performances.

02:30:28.623 --> 02:30:28.984
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

02:30:29.024 --> 02:30:31.807
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's still in the cards for the future, although I kind of doubt it at this point.

02:30:32.888 --> 02:30:35.030
[SPEAKER_03]: This would have kind of added to that, though, in a way.

02:30:35.650 --> 02:30:37.252
[SPEAKER_03]: A little more professional touch to it.

02:30:37.332 --> 02:30:37.913
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for watching!

02:30:54.393 --> 02:30:56.534
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe like once, like a rock band thing.

02:30:57.154 --> 02:30:59.595
[SPEAKER_12]: She's got a crazy powerful voice.

02:30:59.615 --> 02:31:01.296
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a little more classically trained, right?

02:31:01.956 --> 02:31:02.456
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.

02:31:02.816 --> 02:31:06.298
[SPEAKER_12]: She does tend to edge more towards the classically trained, but she can belt them out.

02:31:06.358 --> 02:31:08.199
[SPEAKER_12]: She can really sing.

02:31:08.219 --> 02:31:09.039
[SPEAKER_12]: She's got a great voice.

02:31:10.339 --> 02:31:16.982
[SPEAKER_12]: I like having things at the lower level when she's playing because then it won't make her fail the song for having fun with it.

02:31:17.162 --> 02:31:18.124
[SPEAKER_03]: I can sing Madonna.

02:31:18.204 --> 02:31:19.947
[SPEAKER_03]: Just ask the listeners of Understation Live.

02:31:20.087 --> 02:31:24.115
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I can't believe that you and Tiara got me singing Abba Rock Band.

02:31:24.836 --> 02:31:25.576
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that was fun.

02:31:26.097 --> 02:31:27.557
[SPEAKER_12]: Is Tiara listening?

02:31:28.298 --> 02:31:28.998
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think so.

02:31:29.018 --> 02:31:34.600
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiara, Tiara, Tiara, come back to Sacramento because we need to make Jamie play ABBA.

02:31:35.101 --> 02:31:36.261
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not ABBA Rock Band, by the way.

02:31:36.281 --> 02:31:36.862
[SPEAKER_03]: It's SingStar ABBA.

02:31:36.982 --> 02:31:37.682
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I was talking about.

02:31:37.702 --> 02:31:38.542
[SPEAKER_12]: SingStar ABBA.

02:31:39.323 --> 02:31:40.903
[SPEAKER_11]: I just can't believe that I actually did good at it.

02:31:41.604 --> 02:31:42.064
[SPEAKER_11]: It's fun.

02:31:43.204 --> 02:31:45.746
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to get SingStar Queen now that it's discounted.

02:31:45.766 --> 02:31:46.326
[SPEAKER_12]: I would play that.

02:31:47.466 --> 02:31:48.127
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're right.

02:31:48.207 --> 02:31:51.048
[SPEAKER_02]: Expert doesn't give a lot of leeway for stuff like, I don't know, Vibrato.

02:31:52.071 --> 02:31:52.271
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

02:31:52.991 --> 02:31:55.793
[SPEAKER_12]: But you know, remember when Karaoke Revolution was coming out?

02:31:56.133 --> 02:31:56.333
[SPEAKER_14]: Mm-hmm.

02:31:56.593 --> 02:31:58.714
[SPEAKER_12]: And how it was pretty forgiving here?

02:31:59.295 --> 02:32:04.377
[SPEAKER_12]: The Japanese versions, because I've had friends who had the Japanese versions, they are evil.

02:32:05.438 --> 02:32:13.161
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to pronounce everything perfectly, you have to be dead pitch on, you can't just mumble your way through it, and as long as you hit the key, you're fine.

02:32:13.181 --> 02:32:15.042
[SPEAKER_12]: You actually have to fully pronounce everything right.

02:32:15.743 --> 02:32:18.104
[SPEAKER_12]: Because Japanese itself can be pretty precise.

02:32:18.124 --> 02:32:18.344
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

02:32:18.704 --> 02:32:22.087
[SPEAKER_03]: I played that terrible Karaoke Revolution Glee game that was at E3.

02:32:22.287 --> 02:32:23.348
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very forgiving.

02:32:23.428 --> 02:32:28.572
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, I was playing it on the easiest level, but you could just get your way through it and probably pass it.

02:32:28.872 --> 02:32:37.779
[SPEAKER_12]: See, that's one thing that I was thinking about with the different games from area to area where you have... Because I'd have to say Japanese is a very precise language.

02:32:38.479 --> 02:32:38.759
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

02:32:39.840 --> 02:32:54.672
[SPEAKER_12]: English, especially American English, I'm sorry, is just... Well, English all over the place has so many variables that I really think that even the harder difficulties of them should have more of an allowance.

02:32:55.353 --> 02:32:57.955
[SPEAKER_03]: I am really curious to see how this new vocal system plays out, though.

02:32:57.975 --> 02:33:00.217
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm really interested, too, because I know I'm probably going to get it.

02:33:00.597 --> 02:33:00.878
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

02:33:00.898 --> 02:33:01.638
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to get Rock Band.

02:33:01.758 --> 02:33:02.379
[SPEAKER_03]: Rock Band's awesome.

02:33:03.534 --> 02:33:07.036
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, couple more stories for you guys in the mailbag in the FUs of the week.

02:33:07.396 --> 02:33:08.456
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the Skype line.

02:33:08.757 --> 02:33:12.478
[SPEAKER_03]: Your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR in a little bit here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:33:12.538 --> 02:33:13.919
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, some news from Loki.

02:33:15.030 --> 02:33:21.892
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Dead Rising 2, they've announced a special edition for Europe called the Outbreak Pack.

02:33:22.592 --> 02:33:26.234
[SPEAKER_04]: And with it, you're going to be getting some pretty cool tchotchkes, actually.

02:33:26.294 --> 02:33:37.277
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like a zombie figurine, a surfboard head, which I'm only assuming goes on the zombie, and a cone, which also can go on the head of the zombie, I'm assuming.

02:33:38.397 --> 02:33:48.560
[SPEAKER_04]: and looks like a voucher for a premium theme and some other console specific items as well.

02:33:49.140 --> 02:33:51.740
[SPEAKER_03]: I do love the little serve bot head for the zombie.

02:33:51.760 --> 02:33:52.921
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty awesome.

02:33:53.001 --> 02:33:54.621
[SPEAKER_04]: It is pretty awesome.

02:33:55.281 --> 02:33:57.882
[SPEAKER_04]: Corsi announced that this is not coming out over here.

02:33:58.322 --> 02:34:20.487
[SPEAKER_04]: of course not at all thankfully though we do have something coming out over here and this hasn't really been announced yet but I do know what's actually in the special edition it's not that exciting actually it's kind of standard special edition fair a lot of Zombrex themed stuff you know Zombrex being the actual I don't know if it's the virus or the

02:34:21.347 --> 02:34:22.287
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:34:38.435 --> 02:35:04.026
[SPEAKER_04]: also you get an avatar item for the Xbox 360 version and a premium dynamic theme for the Playstation 3 version behind the scenes documentary of the making of Dead Rising 2 and then of course the whole thing comes in a steelbook case that slips on the actual game so that'll be coming out at the end of September now for $79.99

02:35:06.957 --> 02:35:08.000
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of money for a game.

02:35:09.324 --> 02:35:11.229
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you get all that other cool stuff with it, but still.

02:35:12.023 --> 02:35:15.004
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked Dead Rising 1, but I really didn't play enough of it.

02:35:15.024 --> 02:35:18.206
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those games I really need to go back and revisit because it's pretty cool.

02:35:18.606 --> 02:35:21.227
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead Rising 2 is kind of more of the same, but not in a bad way.

02:35:22.688 --> 02:35:24.909
[SPEAKER_03]: Crackdown 2, people are making it sound like more of the same.

02:35:24.949 --> 02:35:27.030
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a bad thing, but I had a lot of fun with Dead Rising 2.

02:35:27.090 --> 02:35:35.373
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised they didn't put Dead Rising theme duct tape or something like that in there because the main part of the game is actually creating objects.

02:35:35.513 --> 02:35:36.114
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:35:37.074 --> 02:35:41.297
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I saw what I see, a baseball bat get duct taped with nails on the demo I played.

02:35:41.497 --> 02:35:41.877
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty cool.

02:35:43.178 --> 02:35:52.723
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I want to talk about this that was floating around some of the blogs this week and it made designer Ben Marsh a little bit famous this week because these aren't real, okay guys?

02:35:53.063 --> 02:35:57.126
[SPEAKER_03]: But he put out some designs there for video game condoms.

02:35:57.686 --> 02:36:02.449
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, it's video game packaging themed condoms for...

02:36:02.609 --> 02:36:07.454
[SPEAKER_03]: All these lovely little video game themed... And I love this.

02:36:07.514 --> 02:36:10.797
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like little variety packs there they have.

02:36:23.468 --> 02:36:34.370
[SPEAKER_03]: But kind of a serious theme here to this because he says here, the packaging aims to create a desire to purchase the product for aesthetic reasons rather than the necessity of condoms.

02:36:34.830 --> 02:36:38.631
[SPEAKER_03]: Simply by owning the product, safer sex is promoted.

02:36:40.952 --> 02:36:41.852
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

02:36:43.152 --> 02:36:44.772
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone have a feeling on this?

02:36:44.812 --> 02:36:46.293
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think this would promote safe sex?

02:36:46.313 --> 02:36:52.434
[SPEAKER_03]: Because people buy it for the joke of it, but then like, you know, if the time comes where it's time to go a-rockin', hey, you're prepared.

02:36:56.400 --> 02:37:00.684
[SPEAKER_04]: It would never fly in the first place because the game companies would never let this be put out.

02:37:00.704 --> 02:37:07.069
[SPEAKER_04]: But assuming that he was able to create a generic enough concept, I suppose people might buy that.

02:37:09.488 --> 02:37:14.730
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, you know, you don't see a lot of gaming related stuff to sex selling.

02:37:14.890 --> 02:37:22.293
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you don't see a lot of people buying, you know, the fake vaginas for those, you know, sex games that they have in Japan.

02:37:22.633 --> 02:37:23.693
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't see people storing those.

02:37:23.713 --> 02:37:24.154
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, look at that.

02:37:24.174 --> 02:37:24.834
[SPEAKER_04]: That's from a game.

02:37:25.714 --> 02:37:26.655
[SPEAKER_04]: People look at you funny.

02:37:27.795 --> 02:37:33.779
[SPEAKER_04]: As people would look at you funny if you had a box for Donkey Shalong on your... Or Bone Zone 2.

02:37:33.979 --> 02:37:36.120
[SPEAKER_03]: Bone Zone 2, yeah.

02:37:37.161 --> 02:37:43.404
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd be fun gag gifts for people, but... It would never make it past the stigma that gamers don't get laid.

02:37:43.784 --> 02:37:49.047
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that whole gag gift thing, I could see myself getting like eight boxes of these for my birthday, and it would be like...

02:37:53.502 --> 02:37:54.863
[SPEAKER_03]: It was funny the first time.

02:37:54.883 --> 02:37:56.144
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven of them would be from Loki.

02:37:56.745 --> 02:37:57.085
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

02:37:58.686 --> 02:37:59.467
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean, though.

02:38:01.148 --> 02:38:03.890
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes with gag gifs, if there's a certain one that speaks to you.

02:38:04.250 --> 02:38:04.891
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'll tell you this.

02:38:05.231 --> 02:38:09.254
[SPEAKER_03]: One time for Christmas, I kid you not, I got the Survivor board game three times.

02:38:11.736 --> 02:38:12.137
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure did.

02:38:12.417 --> 02:38:13.017
[SPEAKER_03]: The hell?

02:38:13.278 --> 02:38:15.419
[SPEAKER_03]: Got the Survivor board game three times one Christmas.

02:38:15.739 --> 02:38:18.582
[SPEAKER_03]: The first year, Survivor was big, and everyone knew I watched it every week.

02:38:20.740 --> 02:38:27.086
[SPEAKER_03]: so alright how about we get to another segment here on the show called the mailbag yay

02:38:30.382 --> 02:38:55.086
[SPEAKER_03]: every week you guys send us your emails mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura dives in head first and picks a few of her favorites and reads them for you here on the show she's back to doing the mailbag this week I do hooray next week I get to do it drugged yay so definitely send her lots of emails for next week mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com by the way I want to say real quick Akuma JP says he's actually seen these in Akihabara Akihabara?

02:38:55.286 --> 02:38:56.027
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry did I say that wrong?

02:38:56.707 --> 02:38:58.287
[SPEAKER_03]: Akihabara yeah you said it about right

02:38:58.507 --> 02:39:01.175
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that big tech store in Japan.

02:39:02.037 --> 02:39:05.567
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a section of... It's a district.

02:39:06.068 --> 02:39:06.670
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

02:39:07.845 --> 02:39:11.526
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, hey OLR crew, AZHP here.

02:39:11.706 --> 02:39:16.527
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure Rob has got this on show roll, but I had to throw my two cents in for what it's worth.

02:39:16.947 --> 02:39:19.568
[SPEAKER_12]: Blizzard is going to use Real ID for their forums now.

02:39:20.028 --> 02:39:23.069
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we already bypassed that, but here's... I'm going to continue.

02:39:23.389 --> 02:39:24.169
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's a quote from Blizzard.

02:39:24.509 --> 02:39:35.332
[SPEAKER_12]: Removing the veil of anonymity, typical to online dialogue, will contribute to a more positive forum environment, promote constructive conversations, and connect the Blizzard community in ways they haven't been connected before.

02:39:35.852 --> 02:39:36.093
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

02:39:36.173 --> 02:39:38.958
[SPEAKER_12]: Do they think that flamers will stop just because their name is being shown?

02:39:39.279 --> 02:39:40.901
[SPEAKER_12]: Belligerent people will still be belligerent.

02:39:41.382 --> 02:39:46.171
[SPEAKER_12]: Only now they'll know just who they are arguing with and can go to their house and stab them if they don't agree.

02:39:47.293 --> 02:39:54.736
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, I thought the point of WoW was that you could get away from your real life, not have it follow you around and haunt your every move in WoW.

02:39:55.896 --> 02:40:03.618
[SPEAKER_12]: What if I don't want my coworkers knowing that I post on the WoW forums while I'm supposed to be on the clock, not that I do, I don't even play WoW.

02:40:04.039 --> 02:40:10.821
[SPEAKER_12]: This is just ridiculous, and I have a feeling that this move is going to be one of the worst Blizzard has ever made.

02:40:11.241 --> 02:40:13.142
[SPEAKER_12]: Just wondering what you guys think about this travesty.

02:40:13.262 --> 02:40:14.902
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope it all goes away soon.

02:40:14.983 --> 02:40:16.003
[SPEAKER_12]: Yours truly is HP.

02:40:16.423 --> 02:40:18.484
[SPEAKER_12]: Written and sent while I'm supposed to be on the clock.

02:40:18.604 --> 02:40:18.944
[SPEAKER_12]: P.S.

02:40:19.344 --> 02:40:22.025
[SPEAKER_12]: This will make DarkSakura laugh or cry, I'm not sure which.

02:40:22.365 --> 02:40:25.126
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically the biggest travesty in superhero mashups ever.

02:40:25.447 --> 02:40:26.967
[SPEAKER_12]: Make sure she sees this on the show.

02:40:34.426 --> 02:40:39.710
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a toy box of bootleg superheroes.

02:40:39.770 --> 02:40:48.917
[SPEAKER_03]: Superheroes Justice League with Spider-Man, Batman, Naruto, and Iron Man.

02:40:49.097 --> 02:40:51.179
[SPEAKER_12]: Malfunction does not compute.

02:40:52.700 --> 02:40:55.922
[SPEAKER_12]: By the way, I have to commend you on your mostly perfect grammar and spelling.

02:40:56.002 --> 02:40:57.563
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, your spelling was pretty good.

02:40:57.583 --> 02:41:00.245
[SPEAKER_12]: You've missed a couple of punctuation points.

02:41:00.385 --> 02:41:03.668
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everybody can agree that Naruto is the greatest superhero ever known.

02:41:05.485 --> 02:41:06.735
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I find something in your throat, Loki?

02:41:07.273 --> 02:41:07.793
[SPEAKER_12]: Where's the Tribble?

02:41:08.514 --> 02:41:08.934
[SPEAKER_12]: Throw the Tribble.

02:41:09.054 --> 02:41:11.595
[SPEAKER_03]: I prefer Goddamn Batman on Twitter, actually.

02:41:11.615 --> 02:41:17.498
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you've ever seen Goddamn Batman, and then there's Gosh Dang Robin or something like that.

02:41:17.618 --> 02:41:18.699
[SPEAKER_03]: You said Goddamn Batman.

02:41:18.739 --> 02:41:20.760
[SPEAKER_03]: There's Goddamn Batman and Gosh Dang Robin.

02:41:21.640 --> 02:41:22.901
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't forget the Juggernaut, bitch.

02:41:23.641 --> 02:41:24.121
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyhow.

02:41:24.982 --> 02:41:34.507
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, we already kind of ran it about Real ID early in the show, but thankfully, AZHP, that part I think that you were really concerned about did go away, but it hasn't all gone away.

02:41:34.587 --> 02:41:35.167
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's not forget.

02:41:35.601 --> 02:41:38.681
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm still gleefully looking at the decree in shiny silver.

02:41:40.151 --> 02:41:43.513
[SPEAKER_03]: How does it feel to be on the official video game podcast of the galaxy?

02:41:43.653 --> 02:41:44.214
[SPEAKER_12]: Hell yeah.

02:41:44.614 --> 02:41:45.995
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, next up.

02:41:47.236 --> 02:41:49.197
[SPEAKER_12]: It's labeled Choose Your Words Carefully.

02:41:49.838 --> 02:42:02.146
[SPEAKER_12]: In this article on IGN UK, Sony's Shuhei Yoshida claims, This year is the first time we are able to cover the cost of the PlayStation 3, he told IGN.

02:42:02.526 --> 02:42:06.109
[SPEAKER_12]: We aren't making huge money from hardware, but we aren't bleeding like we used to.

02:42:06.909 --> 02:42:13.496
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe he is telling the truth, but it says the PS3 is sold at profit, not that the PS3 program is profitable.

02:42:14.497 --> 02:42:17.200
[SPEAKER_12]: I expect this will take another 8-10 years, if at all.

02:42:17.820 --> 02:42:21.684
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just that now each console digs them a little bit out of the debt hole.

02:42:22.985 --> 02:42:26.669
[SPEAKER_12]: I've also got more questions slash complaints about the EA Game Pass thing.

02:42:27.109 --> 02:42:31.773
[SPEAKER_12]: Since I'm typically not an online gamer, shouldn't I get a refund of $10 on that new EA game?

02:42:32.214 --> 02:42:38.039
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, if they allowed me to turn in the code for rebate, it would make the entire thing a lot more reasonable.

02:42:38.179 --> 02:42:45.786
[SPEAKER_12]: In theory, if the code is still unused, the game should be worth $10 more on resale, but how do you prove it is still good?

02:42:46.446 --> 02:42:49.907
[SPEAKER_12]: and I bet the initial pack-in codes will be deleted after year two.

02:42:50.287 --> 02:42:53.387
[SPEAKER_12]: There's really a lot more screwing of the customer than is obvious.

02:42:53.787 --> 02:42:55.168
[SPEAKER_12]: Hope you have a happy Independence Day.

02:42:55.428 --> 02:43:01.729
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, also, if this can actually be considered part of precedence, well, you probably could actually get away with it.

02:43:02.369 --> 02:43:11.771
[SPEAKER_12]: My laptop, for example, if I had never booted Windows on it and installed Linux, I could have gotten a refund from Dell for $200 and my laptop was $350.

02:43:11.831 --> 02:43:11.971
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, wow.

02:43:14.493 --> 02:43:28.736
[SPEAKER_12]: As long as you never load Windows on them, and prove that you have never loaded Windows on it, that you basically launched right into Linux or something, then you get your money back.

02:43:29.036 --> 02:43:40.218
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bummer that the resellers don't have some type of application to see if the code has been run or not, but then again, probably the whole point of this is to really circumvent the resellers, even though GameStop's supposedly on board.

02:43:41.573 --> 02:43:50.060
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but then someone malicious could get that code verifier and start typing in random codes to see if there's one that has been used or not used.

02:43:50.140 --> 02:43:52.802
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll give you invalid or unused code.

02:43:52.862 --> 02:43:54.864
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, oh, hey, look, Frisa.

02:43:56.445 --> 02:44:00.608
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so you guys know here in studio, apparently Winamp has frozen and the stream has died.

02:44:00.708 --> 02:44:01.529
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

02:44:01.649 --> 02:44:03.450
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got to come right back up here.

02:44:03.931 --> 02:44:07.714
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to hope that the rest of the computer doesn't shut down here.

02:44:08.394 --> 02:44:09.896
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're going to try and keep going here.

02:44:10.356 --> 02:44:12.118
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't read the next email just yet, DarkSakura.

02:44:12.519 --> 02:44:13.860
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody needs to stretch for time.

02:44:14.521 --> 02:44:15.802
[SPEAKER_03]: I want someone to go get me some pie.

02:44:15.822 --> 02:44:18.465
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell the podcast listeners something special while we try to go back up.

02:44:18.586 --> 02:44:19.466
[SPEAKER_12]: Something special?

02:44:19.687 --> 02:44:20.708
[SPEAKER_12]: My boobs are amazing.

02:44:22.563 --> 02:44:23.503
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, my feet are dirty.

02:44:24.103 --> 02:44:25.144
[SPEAKER_12]: See, look how dirty my feet are.

02:44:26.064 --> 02:44:26.904
[SPEAKER_12]: My feet are pretty dirty.

02:44:27.124 --> 02:44:28.965
[SPEAKER_03]: We should be back up on all games now.

02:44:29.085 --> 02:44:29.505
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

02:44:30.025 --> 02:44:34.507
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why the stream just decided to... I'm a dirty girl.

02:44:34.687 --> 02:44:35.047
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you are.

02:44:35.647 --> 02:44:37.508
[SPEAKER_03]: You should have heard what DarkSakura told us when we were down.

02:44:37.528 --> 02:44:37.928
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just kidding.

02:44:38.508 --> 02:44:40.809
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why the stream just decided to drop.

02:44:40.829 --> 02:44:43.829
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I do know why because Winamp froze.

02:44:44.050 --> 02:44:45.510
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know why Winamp froze.

02:44:45.630 --> 02:44:46.390
[SPEAKER_03]: That was strange.

02:44:46.830 --> 02:44:47.491
[SPEAKER_03]: Winamp fail.

02:44:47.871 --> 02:44:48.371
[SPEAKER_04]: Llama fail.

02:44:48.971 --> 02:44:49.791
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, apparently.

02:44:49.811 --> 02:44:50.572
[SPEAKER_11]: It had brain freeze.

02:44:50.952 --> 02:44:51.272
[SPEAKER_03]: Lord.

02:44:51.953 --> 02:44:52.933
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I do the next email now?

02:44:53.433 --> 02:44:53.814
[SPEAKER_03]: We're back.

02:44:53.874 --> 02:44:55.574
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you can go on to the next email now that we're back.

02:44:55.775 --> 02:44:56.835
[SPEAKER_12]: This is from Troy.

02:44:57.355 --> 02:45:00.937
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if it's the same person I work with, so I'm not going to make an assumption.

02:45:01.798 --> 02:45:04.079
[SPEAKER_12]: Whoa, your guys' podcast is freaking awesome.

02:45:04.199 --> 02:45:04.939
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a new listener.

02:45:05.119 --> 02:45:09.582
[SPEAKER_12]: I have listened to the last two episodes so far, and I can say that you guys are great podcasters.

02:45:09.922 --> 02:45:11.362
[SPEAKER_12]: A couple things I wanted to ask.

02:45:11.563 --> 02:45:15.625
[SPEAKER_12]: First of all, I would like to know how you came up with the name Orange Dungeons Radio for this video game podcast.

02:45:16.665 --> 02:45:17.827
[SPEAKER_12]: Rewind Short Story

02:45:39.298 --> 02:45:39.959
[SPEAKER_03]: Ninja's Sisterhood

02:45:59.409 --> 02:46:00.310
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that's true.

02:46:00.370 --> 02:46:01.131
[SPEAKER_03]: There's them too.

02:46:01.331 --> 02:46:02.012
[SPEAKER_03]: Electric Sisterhood.

02:46:02.032 --> 02:46:03.153
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it Ninja?

02:46:03.173 --> 02:46:04.394
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Ninja Sister is the host.

02:46:05.355 --> 02:46:06.837
[SPEAKER_03]: Co-host, whatever their deal is.

02:46:07.137 --> 02:46:07.838
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess there's a few.

02:46:07.878 --> 02:46:11.321
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, Orange Lounge doesn't really make most people think video games.

02:46:11.882 --> 02:46:13.103
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to tell a story or me?

02:46:14.104 --> 02:46:14.564
[SPEAKER_12]: Quick thing.

02:46:14.604 --> 02:46:16.266
[SPEAKER_12]: We were a Bimani podcast to start off.

02:46:16.406 --> 02:46:17.667
[SPEAKER_12]: We named it after a Bimani band.

02:46:18.208 --> 02:46:18.788
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge.

02:46:19.209 --> 02:46:19.870
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio.

02:46:20.190 --> 02:46:20.530
[SPEAKER_11]: The end.

02:46:21.171 --> 02:46:21.711
[SPEAKER_11]: While on the Bart.

02:46:23.032 --> 02:46:32.756
[SPEAKER_03]: Although the name Orange Lounge stuck because we wanted to kind of evoke that image of we're lounging around talking about games because the whole idea... It's our brand.

02:46:32.856 --> 02:46:36.097
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's kind of like we used to go to this restaurant called Brookfield's.

02:46:36.177 --> 02:46:37.638
[SPEAKER_03]: It was right in the parking lot of Rosen's Golf Lab.

02:46:37.658 --> 02:46:38.438
[SPEAKER_03]: The old people restaurant.

02:46:38.478 --> 02:46:38.658
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

02:46:38.938 --> 02:46:39.498
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God, I miss that.

02:46:39.538 --> 02:46:43.240
[SPEAKER_03]: After a long night of gaming, we'd just sit around and talk shit about games, and that's what we wanted our show to be.

02:46:43.480 --> 02:46:45.041
[SPEAKER_12]: And Rick would always order his Merlot.

02:46:46.541 --> 02:46:48.702
[SPEAKER_12]: I always remembered that Rick would always order his Merlot.

02:46:49.184 --> 02:46:50.645
[SPEAKER_03]: and those cheese sticks were awesome.

02:46:51.026 --> 02:46:51.526
[SPEAKER_03]: They were.

02:46:51.686 --> 02:46:52.147
[SPEAKER_12]: They were amazing.

02:46:52.167 --> 02:46:52.727
[SPEAKER_03]: They were amazing.

02:46:52.887 --> 02:46:53.528
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so there you go.

02:46:53.548 --> 02:46:54.589
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where Orange Lounge Radio came from.

02:46:54.969 --> 02:46:55.369
[SPEAKER_03]: Bomani.

02:46:55.449 --> 02:46:56.650
[SPEAKER_03]: Traces back to the DDR games.

02:46:57.311 --> 02:47:01.214
[SPEAKER_12]: Second, do you guys have any games to recommend for Xbox PS3?

02:47:02.735 --> 02:47:05.197
[SPEAKER_12]: Singularity recently came out and it looked cool.

02:47:05.278 --> 02:47:06.198
[SPEAKER_12]: Any thoughts on that game?

02:47:06.358 --> 02:47:06.619
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

02:47:06.679 --> 02:47:07.459
[SPEAKER_12]: Love your podcast.

02:47:07.579 --> 02:47:07.900
[SPEAKER_12]: Troy.

02:47:08.615 --> 02:47:10.556
[SPEAKER_03]: I've not played Singularity myself.

02:47:10.977 --> 02:47:16.320
[SPEAKER_03]: What I've heard around The Great Vine is that it's not so great, but I haven't played it myself, so I couldn't tell you.

02:47:16.740 --> 02:47:17.561
[SPEAKER_04]: Got good reviews.

02:47:18.482 --> 02:47:19.582
[SPEAKER_04]: We got mixed reviews, I guess.

02:47:19.602 --> 02:47:25.706
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Game Informer gave it an 8.5 out of 10, if that makes any difference to you.

02:47:26.087 --> 02:47:32.291
[SPEAKER_04]: Just check Metacritic if you want to get a good benchmark where the game is.

02:47:34.172 --> 02:47:37.434
[SPEAKER_04]: Red Dead Redemption, Crackdown 2 if that's your sort of thing.

02:47:38.155 --> 02:47:39.596
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of sports games coming out.

02:47:39.616 --> 02:47:40.516
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Blur was underrated.

02:47:40.536 --> 02:47:42.097
[SPEAKER_12]: It really helps.

02:47:42.317 --> 02:47:47.881
[SPEAKER_12]: Just a future reference to our players, let us know what type of games you're into before you ask us what to suggest.

02:47:47.981 --> 02:47:54.526
[SPEAKER_12]: I know me in particular, I'm probably the most niche person in this room.

02:47:54.766 --> 02:47:58.888
[SPEAKER_12]: I like playing games where you take pictures of magical girls.

02:47:59.929 --> 02:48:01.550
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just thinking about my Cardcaptor Sakura game.

02:48:02.991 --> 02:48:07.054
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I'm playing, you know, I've been playing some World of Goo.

02:48:07.874 --> 02:48:09.515
[SPEAKER_12]: I like my titles weird.

02:48:10.616 --> 02:48:15.459
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, I loved, oh shit, what's the name of that game with that yellow blob?

02:48:17.820 --> 02:48:19.261
[SPEAKER_12]: Why can't I remember the name of that game, Rob?

02:48:19.961 --> 02:48:20.462
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why.

02:48:20.842 --> 02:48:23.323
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I have the... LocoRoco.

02:48:23.363 --> 02:48:24.224
[SPEAKER_12]: LocoRoco, thank you.

02:48:25.892 --> 02:48:26.813
[SPEAKER_12]: I love LocoRoco.

02:48:27.613 --> 02:48:29.394
[SPEAKER_12]: I like all kinds of weirdness in my games.

02:48:30.015 --> 02:48:30.855
[SPEAKER_12]: I am the niche girl.

02:48:30.975 --> 02:48:32.656
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we have to know what kind of games you like to really deal with that.

02:48:32.676 --> 02:48:34.517
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have heard her when Katamari Damacy came out.

02:48:35.238 --> 02:48:36.459
[SPEAKER_12]: I was ready to pee.

02:48:38.220 --> 02:48:39.200
[SPEAKER_12]: It was the most awesome thing.

02:48:39.240 --> 02:48:40.281
[SPEAKER_12]: I could barely contain myself.

02:48:40.720 --> 02:48:47.084
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't own either system, but I'm a fan of the series, so I would actually recommend Tales of Vesperia.

02:48:47.925 --> 02:48:50.266
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can find it, rumor has it they only did one printing.

02:48:50.847 --> 02:48:52.428
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my suggestion for our listener.

02:48:52.468 --> 02:49:02.694
[SPEAKER_03]: If you really are new to these consoles, like I don't know if you're new to these or you've had these for a while, go back to the bargain bin and try to find some games you missed, because I bet there's a lot of shit out there that you've missed.

02:49:02.995 --> 02:49:04.215
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'll give you case in point.

02:49:04.556 --> 02:49:06.457
[SPEAKER_03]: Team Fortress 2, for myself.

02:49:07.037 --> 02:49:09.658
[SPEAKER_03]: Somehow missed that game just after, you know, how long has it been now?

02:49:09.678 --> 02:49:11.619
[SPEAKER_03]: About three years now?

02:49:11.659 --> 02:49:11.939
[SPEAKER_03]: Two years.

02:49:11.979 --> 02:49:12.460
[SPEAKER_03]: Two and a half years?

02:49:12.920 --> 02:49:15.621
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just totally missed that game somehow, but I'm just now getting into it.

02:49:16.021 --> 02:49:18.142
[SPEAKER_12]: You can get the game on eBay, by the way, for $30.

02:49:21.043 --> 02:49:21.303
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:49:21.404 --> 02:49:22.404
[SPEAKER_12]: Just to let Drew know.

02:49:23.284 --> 02:49:25.165
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you for the email, and we love having new listeners.

02:49:25.886 --> 02:49:26.346
[SPEAKER_03]: Spread the word!

02:49:28.647 --> 02:49:30.988
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, next and final email.

02:49:32.268 --> 02:49:33.489
[SPEAKER_12]: This comes from Damani.

02:49:34.727 --> 02:49:38.491
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey OLR, I was just wondering, do you guys play any board games?

02:49:39.272 --> 02:49:42.094
[SPEAKER_12]: I never did until we bought Catan, I guess that's Settlers of Catan.

02:49:42.975 --> 02:49:46.499
[SPEAKER_12]: It's so fun and has all these expansion packs to make it never get old.

02:49:47.320 --> 02:49:51.184
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's all I can think about except how awesome Gliding and Crackdown 2 are.

02:49:52.525 --> 02:49:53.386
[SPEAKER_12]: Please spell properly.

02:49:53.826 --> 02:49:54.407
[SPEAKER_12]: Agent Wiggles

02:50:12.066 --> 02:50:28.602
[SPEAKER_03]: Agent Wiggles, that's amazing I have been known to like board games I was always a big fan of Life I really like this question by the way This is a really good question Out of the many random questions we get I think this is a neat question So board games that you like Um

02:50:29.182 --> 02:50:30.263
[SPEAKER_03]: I was always good at Rummy and Spades.

02:50:51.044 --> 02:50:51.904
[SPEAKER_11]: Those were always my games.

02:50:52.064 --> 02:50:55.145
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as board game goes, I was always a fan of Clue growing up.

02:50:55.165 --> 02:50:55.265
[SPEAKER_03]: Clue!

02:50:55.285 --> 02:50:57.346
[SPEAKER_03]: And Clue Master Detective especially.

02:50:57.426 --> 02:50:59.667
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course I love the movie and all that stuff.

02:50:59.987 --> 02:51:00.767
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like the classics.

02:51:01.247 --> 02:51:07.189
[SPEAKER_03]: I could never get into like Axis and Allies and the really complex board game shit too many pieces.

02:51:07.309 --> 02:51:08.169
[SPEAKER_12]: I did play Risk.

02:51:09.610 --> 02:51:11.350
[SPEAKER_12]: As a small child, I played Risk.

02:51:12.450 --> 02:51:15.291
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's probably why I don't like strategy games now.

02:51:15.992 --> 02:51:17.332
[SPEAKER_12]: Because of all the Risk I played as a kid.

02:51:19.248 --> 02:51:20.429
[SPEAKER_12]: and I love Taboo.

02:51:21.490 --> 02:51:23.872
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's not really so much of a board game.

02:51:23.972 --> 02:51:26.674
[SPEAKER_12]: I love Trivial Pursuits, the Genesis Edition ones.

02:51:27.815 --> 02:51:29.496
[SPEAKER_12]: The harder they are, the better I like them.

02:51:31.285 --> 02:51:36.328
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard because there's really two categories of board games.

02:51:36.368 --> 02:51:40.310
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like your Hasbro, Target, Walmart board games.

02:51:40.790 --> 02:51:50.215
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's your like fucking millions of pieces, hardcore, we don't fuck around board games, like imported from foreign countries and all that.

02:51:50.315 --> 02:51:50.495
[SPEAKER_03]: Like...

02:51:51.375 --> 02:52:10.568
[SPEAKER_12]: and it's kind they're two totally different worlds and so it's hard to know which type of those games you're into I hate Monopoly I think Monopoly is really overrated too because if you're gonna play Monopoly don't make any fucking plans if you're gonna play an entire game of Monopoly and be prepared to hate everybody else

02:52:11.115 --> 02:52:11.976
[SPEAKER_02]: I still like Trivial Pursuit.

02:52:30.948 --> 02:52:31.889
[SPEAKER_12]: I love Trivial Pursuits.

02:52:32.029 --> 02:52:34.030
[SPEAKER_03]: My old roommate and I were going to have a board game night.

02:52:34.050 --> 02:52:35.190
[SPEAKER_03]: We never did get around to doing it.

02:52:35.250 --> 02:52:37.931
[SPEAKER_12]: I would totally be in on a board game night if we wanted to start one.

02:52:38.071 --> 02:52:38.952
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't do it at my place.

02:52:39.552 --> 02:52:45.335
[SPEAKER_03]: I should talk to my friend who owns a house in the south area and see if he would want to do something like that.

02:52:45.635 --> 02:52:51.378
[SPEAKER_02]: The last actual board game I played was electronic assisted board game, The Omega Virus.

02:52:51.418 --> 02:52:52.238
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anyone remember that?

02:52:52.658 --> 02:52:53.639
[SPEAKER_12]: I think so.

02:52:54.139 --> 02:52:55.900
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like early 90s.

02:52:56.240 --> 02:52:59.162
[SPEAKER_12]: That's in that same family of games like the mall game.

02:52:59.182 --> 02:53:02.384
[SPEAKER_12]: But I mean it's not the same type, but you know what I mean.

02:53:02.584 --> 02:53:03.925
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was kind of like mall madness.

02:53:04.125 --> 02:53:07.907
[SPEAKER_03]: When you say electronic assisted board game, I think of electronic battleship.

02:53:08.488 --> 02:53:09.809
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to have electronic battleship.

02:53:09.829 --> 02:53:10.449
[SPEAKER_03]: That game was fucking rad.

02:53:10.469 --> 02:53:11.229
[SPEAKER_03]: You know which one I loved?

02:53:11.429 --> 02:53:12.790
[SPEAKER_12]: You know which game I loved for a board game?

02:53:13.231 --> 02:53:13.731
[SPEAKER_12]: Mousetrap.

02:53:14.685 --> 02:53:16.627
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, except it never worked.

02:53:17.447 --> 02:53:18.248
[SPEAKER_02]: It never worked.

02:53:18.488 --> 02:53:19.930
[SPEAKER_12]: If you tweak parts of them, they don't work.

02:53:20.130 --> 02:53:22.392
[SPEAKER_03]: Serzo in our chatroom says, how about strip poker?

02:53:22.732 --> 02:53:24.213
[SPEAKER_03]: How about munchkin?

02:53:24.233 --> 02:53:24.994
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a classic.

02:53:25.094 --> 02:53:27.036
[SPEAKER_04]: I like playing... What about munchkin?

02:53:27.196 --> 02:53:27.736
[SPEAKER_04]: Catan.

02:53:28.417 --> 02:53:29.398
[SPEAKER_04]: Catan's pretty fun.

02:53:30.498 --> 02:53:35.302
[SPEAKER_04]: Your traditional stuff, we'll play the Game of Life now than Scrabble.

02:53:35.883 --> 02:53:39.846
[SPEAKER_04]: One game, though, I did play with one of my friends a while back, and it was actually a lot of fun.

02:53:39.866 --> 02:53:41.247
[SPEAKER_04]: We really need to play it again.

02:53:41.848 --> 02:53:42.829
[SPEAKER_04]: Cthulhu Rising.

02:53:43.536 --> 02:53:44.677
[SPEAKER_12]: I've heard that's good.

02:53:44.837 --> 02:53:45.638
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

02:53:45.798 --> 02:53:49.701
[SPEAKER_04]: It's you versus, it's basically everybody playing together as a team.

02:53:50.741 --> 02:53:54.504
[SPEAKER_04]: Although we need to cheat the next time we play because it was really fucking hard.

02:53:54.784 --> 02:53:58.547
[SPEAKER_04]: Cthulhu kicked our ass as Cthulhu usually does.

02:53:59.528 --> 02:54:01.009
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminds me of a joke I heard.

02:54:01.249 --> 02:54:01.689
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry about that.

02:54:01.729 --> 02:54:02.470
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone sent me a link.

02:54:02.510 --> 02:54:03.511
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know a video would be on it.

02:54:03.651 --> 02:54:03.951
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

02:54:05.112 --> 02:54:07.473
[SPEAKER_02]: How many Cthulhu investigators does Take Change Lightbulb?

02:54:08.454 --> 02:54:08.814
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them.

02:54:09.034 --> 02:54:09.974
[SPEAKER_02]: You never split the party.

02:54:09.994 --> 02:54:13.415
[SPEAKER_03]: See, now Scherzo's yelling out all those junior high school games.

02:54:13.515 --> 02:54:17.836
[SPEAKER_03]: Spin the Bottle, Two Minutes in the Closet, Truth or Dare.

02:54:17.916 --> 02:54:20.377
[SPEAKER_12]: We're really sticking to board games, okay?

02:54:22.278 --> 02:54:26.099
[SPEAKER_12]: We used to, though, when we would play Monopoly, we would steal the pieces from Clue.

02:54:26.919 --> 02:54:31.360
[SPEAKER_12]: So you could be the lead pipe, or the dagger, or the revolver.

02:54:32.740 --> 02:54:33.360
[SPEAKER_12]: That was always fun.

02:54:33.380 --> 02:54:35.121
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to always fight over who got to be the car.

02:54:36.348 --> 02:54:37.589
[SPEAKER_12]: I never wanted to be the car.

02:54:37.649 --> 02:54:40.531
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to be the boot so I could kick everyone's ass.

02:54:42.933 --> 02:54:45.015
[SPEAKER_02]: This was my logic as a 10-year-old.

02:54:45.055 --> 02:54:46.817
[SPEAKER_02]: This explains so much about Jamie.

02:54:49.138 --> 02:54:50.239
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see what the problem is.

02:54:50.299 --> 02:54:52.981
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I don't have to argue with everybody over who gets the damn car.

02:54:53.082 --> 02:54:54.303
[SPEAKER_12]: It's pewter.

02:54:55.023 --> 02:54:55.684
[SPEAKER_12]: It's pewter.

02:54:56.860 --> 02:54:57.961
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, hold on.

02:54:58.101 --> 02:55:06.147
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll go and get one of my ex's Warhammer figures and I will be the orc with the tank.

02:55:06.467 --> 02:55:07.208
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

02:55:07.508 --> 02:55:10.530
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, Cthulhu Rising needs to be an Xbox Live Arcade game.

02:55:11.391 --> 02:55:12.412
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome.

02:55:13.752 --> 02:55:14.072
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:55:14.593 --> 02:55:17.355
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any other emails this week to read?

02:55:17.635 --> 02:55:18.416
[SPEAKER_03]: We do not.

02:55:18.796 --> 02:55:19.116
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:55:19.457 --> 02:55:23.700
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys should send us emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:55:24.300 --> 02:55:33.508
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, it is time for us to get out a little bit of the angst that happens to be in our system tonight, and it's a little segment we call the FUs of the Week.

02:55:49.119 --> 02:55:50.400
[SPEAKER_10]: Mine is multifaceted.

02:55:51.321 --> 02:55:52.102
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, big words.

02:55:53.123 --> 02:55:54.904
[SPEAKER_10]: Faceted is not a big word, Rob.

02:55:55.064 --> 02:55:56.566
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, it's a little word with a big meaning.

02:55:56.586 --> 02:55:57.406
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know what a facet is?

02:55:57.767 --> 02:55:59.688
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something you put on the kitchen sink, right?

02:56:01.670 --> 02:56:02.331
[SPEAKER_12]: Where's the treble?

02:56:04.312 --> 02:56:04.633
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob?

02:56:06.715 --> 02:56:07.435
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, it vibrates.

02:56:07.475 --> 02:56:10.138
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's put that in my special place.

02:56:10.178 --> 02:56:13.200
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob's got a big hairy ball in his crotch now.

02:56:13.921 --> 02:56:14.682
[SPEAKER_03]: What else is new?

02:56:16.730 --> 02:56:17.631
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone got a weed whacker?

02:56:18.511 --> 02:56:18.851
[SPEAKER_12]: Lord.

02:56:19.852 --> 02:56:20.993
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, anyway.

02:56:23.154 --> 02:56:29.078
[SPEAKER_12]: It's more of a situational thing, not directly to anyone in particular, just the whole having to wait for my surgery thing really blows.

02:56:29.558 --> 02:56:39.245
[SPEAKER_12]: But I do want to thank my surgeon for basically fitting me in on one of his on-call days to get me in so that I can still legitimately claim my FMLA.

02:56:43.137 --> 02:57:00.093
[SPEAKER_12]: Family Medical Leave Act Also F you to the company that purchased mine for basically I know you're going to outsource all the servicing to India so I really hope that you go to hell for

02:57:03.022 --> 02:57:08.344
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, logically, I try to separate what I logically know from what I emotionally feel, you know?

02:57:09.264 --> 02:57:10.605
[SPEAKER_12]: Logically, it's business.

02:57:11.325 --> 02:57:14.486
[SPEAKER_12]: We were the number one servicer, they were the number two servicer.

02:57:14.906 --> 02:57:16.307
[SPEAKER_12]: They had the money to buy us.

02:57:17.207 --> 02:57:19.288
[SPEAKER_12]: They bought us, now they have no competition.

02:57:19.928 --> 02:57:24.910
[SPEAKER_12]: But still, when you look at people who you've been with, you know, for...

02:57:27.064 --> 02:57:30.165
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of these people, I've worked with the entire time I've been with the company for 10 years.

02:57:30.926 --> 02:57:34.647
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just sort of like, wow, that's a big chapter closing.

02:57:34.867 --> 02:57:42.771
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm not really necessarily going to say an F you to Auckland, because even though they are shitty and not keeping jobs in America, pretty much.

02:57:44.231 --> 02:58:05.594
[SPEAKER_12]: which I have a big issue with I do want to say that it really sucks for all the people who actually enjoyed working there who I've known for ages and I just wish everybody the best all my co-workers for those who are listening to the show and no I won't tell you what department I was in Loki

02:58:06.772 --> 02:58:16.237
[SPEAKER_04]: A big ol' fuck you to Julie Mayo of Roseville, California and Martin Jennings of Roseville, California for wasting three weeks of my time.

02:58:17.078 --> 02:58:25.062
[SPEAKER_04]: May you never get any money from any of your litigations and, for the love of God, take some goddamn responsibility for your firing.

02:58:25.462 --> 02:58:30.405
[SPEAKER_04]: You are a horrible employee, you don't get along with people, and you wonder why you got fired.

02:58:31.866 --> 02:58:33.246
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe because you're a fucking idiot.

02:58:33.607 --> 02:58:34.067
[SPEAKER_04]: The end.

02:58:34.187 --> 02:58:34.667
[SPEAKER_03]: Allegedly.

02:58:34.847 --> 02:58:36.168
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been sitting on this one.

02:58:37.824 --> 02:58:38.284
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

02:58:55.254 --> 02:58:56.315
[SPEAKER_03]: My FUs of the week.

02:58:57.515 --> 02:59:02.619
[SPEAKER_03]: Some folks think I'm going to FU the World Cup because I'm Dutch in heritage, but I'm not that upset about it.

02:59:03.139 --> 02:59:04.019
[SPEAKER_12]: My last name's Dutch.

02:59:04.139 --> 02:59:04.820
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just soccer.

02:59:06.601 --> 02:59:07.041
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

02:59:07.481 --> 02:59:08.522
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, we're in the U.S.

02:59:08.582 --> 02:59:10.443
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't get as riled up as other places do.

02:59:10.743 --> 02:59:11.544
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also gamers.

02:59:11.564 --> 02:59:12.945
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really care about sports.

02:59:13.225 --> 02:59:15.146
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give my weekly FU to Real ID.

02:59:15.686 --> 02:59:16.487
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn you.

02:59:16.907 --> 02:59:20.209
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to the fucking Vuvuzela app that Jamie has.

02:59:20.249 --> 02:59:21.350
[SPEAKER_03]: That thing can burn in hell.

02:59:22.290 --> 02:59:23.912
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop giggling like three-year-olds.

02:59:24.433 --> 02:59:30.561
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why the Nintendo DS and PSP are far superior to the Apple iPhone.

02:59:32.183 --> 02:59:32.984
[SPEAKER_04]: No app like that.

02:59:33.024 --> 02:59:33.285
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet.

02:59:33.305 --> 02:59:35.267
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't even say it.

02:59:37.869 --> 02:59:41.792
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like an animal that roams the jungle.

02:59:42.132 --> 02:59:43.373
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's see.

02:59:43.393 --> 02:59:48.496
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give an F you to Owie Phantom Side Pains I've been having lately.

02:59:48.516 --> 02:59:49.197
[SPEAKER_03]: That's no fun.

02:59:49.457 --> 02:59:51.098
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully it's not as bad as what I had before.

02:59:51.138 --> 02:59:51.578
[SPEAKER_03]: That would suck.

02:59:52.659 --> 03:00:01.244
[SPEAKER_03]: And then F you to the fact that I'm probably finally getting rid of my car that I've had longer than I've been doing this show this week.

03:00:01.465 --> 03:00:01.925
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

03:00:02.503 --> 03:00:03.363
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

03:00:03.423 --> 03:00:04.404
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't happened yet.

03:00:04.464 --> 03:00:05.124
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't cheer yet.

03:00:05.144 --> 03:00:05.824
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't happened yet.

03:00:06.725 --> 03:00:07.285
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

03:00:07.965 --> 03:00:12.127
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a frugal person, and if I want to drive my car into the ground, I have every right.

03:00:12.207 --> 03:00:14.908
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have driven that thing into the ground.

03:00:14.948 --> 03:00:15.428
[SPEAKER_03]: Sell it.

03:00:15.448 --> 03:00:16.088
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's going to buy it?

03:00:16.388 --> 03:00:21.010
[SPEAKER_12]: I will play this the entire... It's that goddamn fucking horn.

03:00:21.030 --> 03:00:22.531
[SPEAKER_12]: I will delete this off of my phone.

03:00:22.871 --> 03:00:25.452
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to hold you to that.

03:00:25.672 --> 03:00:27.172
[SPEAKER_12]: Do they even have the spit noises?

03:00:27.212 --> 03:00:27.773
[SPEAKER_12]: That's great.

03:00:28.113 --> 03:00:30.834
[SPEAKER_04]: And then she'll get a bee app that makes the same noise.

03:00:31.670 --> 03:00:32.012
[SPEAKER_13]: Drew.

03:00:34.173 --> 03:00:35.294
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to the heat.

03:00:36.414 --> 03:00:38.496
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been screwing with my computer.

03:00:39.236 --> 03:00:40.717
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been screwing with the AC.

03:00:41.737 --> 03:00:44.459
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it may have been screwing with the fridge in my house.

03:00:44.579 --> 03:00:47.421
[SPEAKER_02]: Big F you to my fridge, which finally died.

03:00:48.181 --> 03:01:00.328
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to go out to a storage container in the middle of the day on a 102 fucking degree day to get the fridge, get into a U-Haul.

03:01:00.588 --> 03:01:02.209
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one fucking broke.

03:01:03.578 --> 03:01:21.949
[SPEAKER_02]: Broke down, as in handle broke off the door Take it out, get all the spoiled food out of the fridge Put, I don't know, one third of our food back in the new fridge Plug it in, and then clean up the entire fucking mess that we made in the process Complain, complain, complain

03:01:22.745 --> 03:01:23.607
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck this heat.

03:01:24.648 --> 03:01:25.610
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all I got.

03:01:25.670 --> 03:01:26.592
[SPEAKER_02]: May as well make it big.

03:01:37.173 --> 03:01:38.775
[SPEAKER_12]: By the way, I said I was going to do this on the show.

03:01:39.256 --> 03:01:42.419
[SPEAKER_12]: This is my impersonation of watching World Cup on Telemundo.

03:01:43.641 --> 03:01:47.926
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, Becky and I, my last week of work, we decided to go get tacos at our usual place.

03:01:48.426 --> 03:01:50.929
[SPEAKER_12]: And we were watching Uruguay versus Netherlands.

03:01:51.931 --> 03:01:52.792
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was great.

03:01:53.252 --> 03:01:55.254
[SPEAKER_12]: But every time, of course, there was a goal.

03:01:55.515 --> 03:01:55.935
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait here.

03:01:56.756 --> 03:01:57.556
[SPEAKER_12]: Where's that camera now?

03:01:57.576 --> 03:02:01.538
[SPEAKER_12]: And then back on your... Goal!

03:02:01.858 --> 03:02:02.058
[SPEAKER_12]: Goal!

03:02:02.259 --> 03:02:03.079
[SPEAKER_12]: Goal!

03:02:03.119 --> 03:02:03.799
[SPEAKER_12]: Goal!

03:02:03.819 --> 03:02:04.099
[SPEAKER_12]: Goal!

03:02:04.139 --> 03:02:04.440
[SPEAKER_12]: Goal!

03:02:04.480 --> 03:02:06.781
[SPEAKER_12]: Goal!

03:02:07.521 --> 03:02:10.342
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my impersonation of watching a World Cup on Telemundo.

03:02:10.602 --> 03:02:11.803
[SPEAKER_03]: You make it sound so riveting.

03:02:12.583 --> 03:02:12.923
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

03:02:13.844 --> 03:02:15.144
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, got some news for us?

03:02:16.545 --> 03:02:16.805
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

03:02:17.245 --> 03:02:22.568
[SPEAKER_04]: The PS3 is becoming white and... Racist.

03:02:24.228 --> 03:02:24.849
[SPEAKER_04]: In Japan.

03:02:24.969 --> 03:02:25.089
[SPEAKER_04]: It's...

03:02:27.290 --> 03:02:28.652
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

03:02:46.272 --> 03:02:56.067
[SPEAKER_04]: and we'll also include a new vertical white stand and of course a white DualShock 3 controller and I'll be retailing for 29,980 yen.

03:03:00.091 --> 03:03:00.651
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking at chat.

03:03:21.698 --> 03:03:21.998
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

03:03:23.639 --> 03:03:26.060
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't they already have the Final Fantasy XIII one that was white?

03:03:26.200 --> 03:03:28.941
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was white with like a pink crap on it.

03:03:29.861 --> 03:03:33.002
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they put a woman on it, so that's why it didn't sell.

03:03:36.264 --> 03:03:38.505
[SPEAKER_03]: I was waiting to get voodoo.

03:03:38.585 --> 03:03:40.405
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura's distracted by EarthBound.

03:03:40.926 --> 03:03:43.086
[SPEAKER_12]: I was looking at the anti-piracy stuff.

03:03:43.166 --> 03:03:43.747
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for the best.

03:03:44.167 --> 03:03:44.467
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

03:03:48.348 --> 03:03:49.729
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have anything else to go with that?

03:03:50.799 --> 03:03:56.063
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they're going to be bundling Resident Evil 5 with the PlayStation Move over there.

03:03:56.483 --> 03:04:01.507
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, in all honesty, is probably a better game anyways than what Move Sports.

03:04:03.028 --> 03:04:04.669
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, Move Sports.

03:04:05.710 --> 03:04:09.072
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop it right now!

03:04:12.754 --> 03:04:17.718
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also supposed to be including, I believe, the gun shooting pack.

03:04:19.224 --> 03:04:31.487
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they have also announced a big three gun shooting perfect pack that will include Time Crisis, Raising Storm, Dead Storm Pirates, and Time Crisis 4, the arcade version.

03:04:32.368 --> 03:04:33.828
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to cost about $136 or 11,980 yen.

03:04:33.848 --> 03:04:37.049
[SPEAKER_04]: But, of course, the Move bundle with Resident Evil 5, the alternative edition.

03:04:37.109 --> 03:04:41.970
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all going to have alternative music in there.

03:04:49.972 --> 03:05:17.738
[SPEAKER_02]: that'll retail for about $7,980 yen or about $90 once again, I'd rather have Resident Evil 5 than the crappy screw it, pack the Resident Evil game with the white PS3 and call it equal opportunity that way everyone gets offended the nice thing about the move and a lot of that stuff is that those games aren't going to require move that's true much different than the Kinect just so you know

03:05:20.131 --> 03:05:46.826
[SPEAKER_04]: but they may have some games that require them actually no there are games that require the move oh well yeah how the fuck are you gonna play move sports or how are you gonna play the sorcery game or how are you gonna play um well there's a lot there's a lot though that don't require it that's true there are a lot that require it the same could be said about the connect though as well there's a lot what there's child of eden and well that's all that's been announced yet yeah

03:05:49.636 --> 03:05:56.302
[SPEAKER_04]: That's alright that they don't require that the PlayStation Move be required to play certain games because it probably will stink.

03:05:57.623 --> 03:05:57.863
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

03:05:58.503 --> 03:06:02.686
[SPEAKER_03]: One more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

03:06:02.847 --> 03:06:08.311
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sorry, this picture that they have photoshopped with the Move in her hand, it looks like a giant sex toy.

03:06:08.791 --> 03:06:12.374
[SPEAKER_04]: A freaking huge giant sex toy with a glowing end on it.

03:06:12.994 --> 03:06:13.355
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you done?

03:06:13.655 --> 03:06:13.915
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

03:06:14.055 --> 03:06:14.315
[SPEAKER_03]: You swear?

03:06:14.335 --> 03:06:14.696
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear.

03:06:14.736 --> 03:06:14.896
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

03:06:15.596 --> 03:06:16.757
[SPEAKER_03]: One more story for you guys tonight.

03:06:17.317 --> 03:06:22.019
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has to do with an OLR favorite game, Eye of Judgment.

03:06:22.780 --> 03:06:25.601
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess you could say a sad end to a story here.

03:06:26.121 --> 03:06:37.567
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the Eye of Judgment, or as we sometimes call it here on Orange Launch Radio, the Brown Eye of Judgment, or that game we really wish would sell one million copies so that Loki would have to put on a tingle suit when he comes to the show.

03:06:37.587 --> 03:06:39.647
[SPEAKER_03]: You might remember he made that bet a long time ago.

03:06:42.188 --> 03:07:09.660
[SPEAKER_03]: apparently the Eye of Judgment servers are going to be shut down on September 30th and that was a notice now it's on the European Playstation forums but you can just pretty much guess that this pretty much is going to carry over to the states as well so offline play will still be available of course but if you play the Eye of Judgment online you will no longer be able to after September 30th I have something to say about that what?

03:07:11.361 --> 03:07:13.946
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sure all ten of you will be sad.

03:07:15.790 --> 03:07:16.150
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

03:07:16.651 --> 03:07:18.515
[SPEAKER_04]: I said I'm sure all ten of you will be sad.

03:07:22.119 --> 03:07:33.987
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this also means something else, you guys, is that we made that bet with Loki, and I know you guys were holding out hope that somehow, someway, maybe a price cut or something would happen where this game would sell a million copies.

03:07:34.427 --> 03:07:45.075
[SPEAKER_03]: But guys, now that the developer is even pulling the plug on Eye of Judgment, I think it's time to finally admit, you guys, the bet, ladies and gentlemen, is over.

03:07:48.055 --> 03:07:52.618
[SPEAKER_02]: And not to mention that they stopped printing the game like years ago.

03:07:52.638 --> 03:07:55.200
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even think they printed one million copies.

03:07:55.440 --> 03:07:58.282
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I can guarantee they did not print one million copies.

03:07:58.562 --> 03:08:03.145
[SPEAKER_03]: We never made it official here on the show, so I kind of felt like we needed to finally say...

03:08:04.546 --> 03:08:05.087
[SPEAKER_03]: It's over.

03:08:05.147 --> 03:08:05.987
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, you guys.

03:08:06.187 --> 03:08:06.568
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.

03:08:06.828 --> 03:08:14.573
[SPEAKER_03]: You lost the bet with Loki, and Loki will not be ever dressing up as Tingle unless you can get him to sign up to something else, which should be your next goal.

03:08:15.594 --> 03:08:22.239
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not able to get him to sign up or do this with the eye of judgment, then you should get him to make a bet somewhere else.

03:08:22.839 --> 03:08:23.600
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just all I'm saying.

03:08:25.333 --> 03:08:25.653
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

03:08:26.314 --> 03:08:27.835
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we ready to take some phone calls?

03:08:28.575 --> 03:08:29.015
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

03:08:29.156 --> 03:08:30.576
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

03:08:30.596 --> 03:08:35.360
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR is our phone number or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

03:08:35.400 --> 03:08:37.701
[SPEAKER_03]: The Skype line is now open for business.

03:08:38.301 --> 03:08:40.763
[SPEAKER_03]: And meanwhile, some last minute stories for you guys.

03:08:41.804 --> 03:08:44.505
[SPEAKER_03]: I was asked by a listener to throw this out here real quick.

03:08:44.966 --> 03:08:48.228
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Max 3 is coming out soon.

03:08:48.688 --> 03:08:53.131
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cute because there's this little dog that you can play with here and it's kind of like

03:08:53.231 --> 03:08:53.912
[SPEAKER_03]: Out in the States 2

03:09:10.620 --> 03:09:15.442
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say it was either on the PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 2, maybe.

03:09:16.062 --> 03:09:18.563
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I remember it's the one with dogs with artillery on it.

03:09:18.603 --> 03:09:19.983
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's so epic.

03:09:20.584 --> 03:09:21.224
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.

03:09:21.664 --> 03:09:22.604
[SPEAKER_04]: Dogs with artillery.

03:09:22.624 --> 03:09:23.705
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the same game.

03:09:23.985 --> 03:09:27.226
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember what it's called over here, but that's how I sold it.

03:09:27.266 --> 03:09:30.207
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, dude, it's dogs with freaking cannons on the back of them.

03:09:30.487 --> 03:09:31.127
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

03:09:50.679 --> 03:09:51.619
[SPEAKER_03]: Our skyline is open.

03:09:51.859 --> 03:09:55.900
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess our freaking feed dropped for some reason.

03:09:55.920 --> 03:09:58.161
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR is the phone number to call.

03:09:58.861 --> 03:10:00.901
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why we're having stream fail problems tonight.

03:10:00.921 --> 03:10:01.782
[SPEAKER_03]: I blame Visual Basic.

03:10:02.642 --> 03:10:03.502
[SPEAKER_03]: I blame the Vuvuzela.

03:10:04.182 --> 03:10:04.442
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

03:10:06.183 --> 03:10:09.123
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you have any last minute stories for us while we wait for some phone calls?

03:10:09.904 --> 03:10:10.464
[SPEAKER_04]: Just one.

03:10:10.664 --> 03:10:16.165
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently the rumor is the new Animal Crossing game for the 3DS will have you as the role of the mayor.

03:10:18.061 --> 03:10:23.925
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting, so you will have to do stuff for the town Where's that rumor coming from?

03:10:24.025 --> 03:10:38.295
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming from apparently a PDF that came out from Nintendo during E3 Which makes sense because they did put out E3 Or they usually put out PDFs with information regarding their titles Alright, let me get to the phone because we do have a call on hold Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

03:10:39.556 --> 03:10:42.678
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, this is Spazinator Hey Spazinator, what's on your mind?

03:10:44.652 --> 03:10:50.694
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is just basically a follow-up call to the call I had made like two weeks ago.

03:10:52.634 --> 03:10:57.215
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick recap, just in case you or the other listeners forgot.

03:10:58.395 --> 03:11:12.679
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, Sony was having me jump through hoops to get my VOs back after having to send my system in for repair, again, for the yellow light of death.

03:11:13.867 --> 03:11:29.174
[SPEAKER_00]: and basically, I don't know if anyone's seen my little rants on Twitter, but here it is basically a week and a half later and I still don't have all my videos back.

03:11:31.355 --> 03:11:39.339
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I literally looked at what they did authorize and

03:11:42.665 --> 03:11:50.209
[SPEAKER_00]: I compare that to all the videos that backed up, and basically I still got like 55 videos outstanding.

03:11:51.230 --> 03:11:54.011
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, what the fuck, you know?

03:11:54.231 --> 03:11:56.572
[SPEAKER_03]: You would think you're not the only person, too, that this happens to.

03:11:57.333 --> 03:12:08.138
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird that they don't have a better process, like at least Microsoft seems to have with the whole, you know, releasing your DRM once a year to be able to re-download it.

03:12:08.158 --> 03:12:09.639
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems a little ridiculous.

03:12:09.659 --> 03:12:10.059
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

03:12:11.590 --> 03:12:17.272
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my main gripe more than anything is that, well, it's kind of two-fold.

03:12:18.132 --> 03:12:31.176
[SPEAKER_00]: A, the first one being that Sony's policy in terms of having this done is supposed to be done within 24 to 48 hours of your call.

03:12:32.357 --> 03:12:39.239
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I made the initial call on the Wednesday before the 4th of July,

03:12:40.115 --> 03:12:47.863
[SPEAKER_00]: I've still got all my videos back by that Friday, and like I just said, I'm still missing 55 videos.

03:12:48.924 --> 03:12:59.195
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second gripe that I have is that the Sony reps over there either don't seem to know what the hell they're doing,

03:12:59.838 --> 03:13:02.559
[SPEAKER_00]: or just don't give a shit one way y'all are.

03:13:19.306 --> 03:13:21.087
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe you should buy hard copies.

03:13:21.347 --> 03:13:27.109
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, does this kind of make you think, wow, this might be the case against digital distribution?

03:13:27.289 --> 03:13:30.030
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are you walking away from this going, oh, you know what?

03:13:30.290 --> 03:13:32.190
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still about digital distribution.

03:13:33.871 --> 03:13:48.216
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, some of the shows I normally get on a regular basis, for example, I buy the weekly recaps of X-Play and Attack of the Show on a regular basis, and

03:13:49.057 --> 03:14:01.245
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen those on hard copy whatsoever unless I get like a DVD burner and record them directly out the air.

03:14:01.685 --> 03:14:02.606
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting, okay.

03:14:03.907 --> 03:14:13.553
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in other shows, you know, I've tried looking at places like Blockbuster, Target, and what that, and...

03:14:14.861 --> 03:14:16.242
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost never see them.

03:14:16.902 --> 03:14:28.268
[SPEAKER_00]: My only other recourse would probably be to go to Microsoft, get them there, or get them on PlayStation Network.

03:14:29.169 --> 03:14:32.310
[SPEAKER_00]: Or find some kind of mail order service and buy them that way.

03:14:33.711 --> 03:14:44.297
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, David's Joe Schmoe shouldn't have to jump through hoops, plead and beg, and

03:14:45.060 --> 03:14:50.051
[SPEAKER_00]: yada yada yada to get all their videos back that they rightfully paid for, you know?

03:14:50.171 --> 03:14:54.701
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all I want is to sit down, watch my videos when I'm at it,

03:14:55.171 --> 03:14:57.212
[SPEAKER_00]: Playing my games and whatnot.

03:14:57.432 --> 03:15:00.333
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really, is there really too much to ask for?

03:15:22.603 --> 03:15:41.729
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's really what it boils down to unfortunately I can't make Sony give the stuff back or what have you so there's not a lot we can do but I'm hoping you're able to get conclusion to this but that just really bites and I think unfortunately your story is going to have to be cautioned for everybody else

03:15:43.052 --> 03:15:48.516
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, one final note before I let you go and get to the next call.

03:15:49.937 --> 03:16:03.967
[SPEAKER_00]: I did make my most recent call to Sony this past Friday and basically bitching to them about what's going on with the videos and

03:16:04.775 --> 03:16:13.378
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, they said it's going to take a couple days longer and I should, you know, get them back by Tuesday.

03:16:14.618 --> 03:16:22.281
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if I don't get them by Tuesday, I'm just going to call them back and I'll tell them how pissed off I am and

03:16:22.915 --> 03:16:29.079
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll certainly take all my business over to Microsoft in terms of digital downloads and whatnot.

03:16:29.319 --> 03:16:32.281
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell them you've got the video game podcast of the galaxy behind your back.

03:16:34.102 --> 03:16:34.402
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

03:16:34.562 --> 03:16:35.042
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks.

03:16:35.663 --> 03:16:35.983
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

03:16:36.043 --> 03:16:38.084
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, have a good one.

03:16:38.324 --> 03:16:38.584
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

03:16:38.845 --> 03:16:42.247
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll keep you posted as to what's going on.

03:16:42.307 --> 03:16:42.727
[SPEAKER_03]: Please do.

03:16:42.747 --> 03:16:44.688
[SPEAKER_03]: And they can follow you on Twitter too at what?

03:16:44.728 --> 03:16:46.990
[SPEAKER_03]: Spazinator underscore PSN, right?

03:16:47.290 --> 03:16:48.170
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is there no underscore?

03:16:48.711 --> 03:16:48.911
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

03:16:48.931 --> 03:16:49.211
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

03:16:49.611 --> 03:16:49.851
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

03:16:50.151 --> 03:16:50.852
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care, Spazinator.

03:16:51.980 --> 03:16:52.520
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, you too.

03:16:52.700 --> 03:16:52.961
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

03:16:53.801 --> 03:16:54.201
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

03:16:54.401 --> 03:16:58.443
[SPEAKER_03]: I see Bonds in chat says my PS3 yellow ringed on me too.

03:16:58.563 --> 03:17:03.106
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess... And Rob, that's the official video game podcast of the galaxy.

03:17:03.186 --> 03:17:03.646
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

03:17:04.066 --> 03:17:04.426
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

03:17:04.687 --> 03:17:06.367
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't violate the decree, did I?

03:17:07.088 --> 03:17:07.928
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a clause in there?

03:17:07.948 --> 03:17:08.248
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

03:17:08.489 --> 03:17:08.729
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good.

03:17:08.749 --> 03:17:09.669
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to clarify that.

03:17:09.689 --> 03:17:09.889
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

03:17:09.929 --> 03:17:10.209
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

03:17:10.389 --> 03:17:11.150
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for clarifying that.

03:17:13.211 --> 03:17:16.212
[SPEAKER_03]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the official video game podcast of the galaxy.

03:17:16.553 --> 03:17:20.995
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

03:17:23.416 --> 03:17:29.258
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, SSJ100Matt has advice for Spaznator saying, if you're going to keep getting bitten by this, then just stop downloading videos on it.

03:17:29.298 --> 03:17:31.800
[SPEAKER_03]: It really isn't worth the hassle every six months with this nonsense.

03:17:32.220 --> 03:17:39.563
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I kind of make this comparison to what I'm going through in World of Warcraft right now is that you invest so much in something...

03:17:40.103 --> 03:17:40.864
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

03:17:59.076 --> 03:18:05.418
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, though, what you've got to do is you've got to let his trouble serve as a lesson for everybody else.

03:18:05.438 --> 03:18:08.979
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

03:18:09.299 --> 03:18:10.819
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, do you have any last-minute stories for us?

03:18:11.820 --> 03:18:12.120
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

03:18:13.660 --> 03:18:18.761
[SPEAKER_04]: Real quick, I guess they're going to be doing a prequel to Dead Space 2 called Dead Space Ignition.

03:18:19.181 --> 03:18:24.643
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be available out on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network slightly before the title is released.

03:18:25.223 --> 03:18:27.605
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

03:18:45.796 --> 03:18:49.820
[SPEAKER_04]: But now we actually have release dates and prices for these titles as well.

03:18:50.420 --> 03:18:54.223
[SPEAKER_04]: So, starting July 21st, Limbo will be making its way out.

03:18:54.804 --> 03:18:57.526
[SPEAKER_04]: July 28th has Hydro Thunder Hurricane.

03:18:58.127 --> 03:19:00.509
[SPEAKER_04]: August 4th, Castlevania, Harmony of Despair.

03:19:01.289 --> 03:19:03.111
[SPEAKER_04]: August 11th, Monday Night Combat.

03:19:03.471 --> 03:19:08.935
[SPEAKER_04]: And August 18th, Lara Croft in The Guardian of Light, or as I call it, Lara Croft in Who Gives a Shit.

03:19:09.756 --> 03:19:12.278
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I hear it's much cooler than you'd think.

03:19:12.618 --> 03:19:14.700
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what I hear about every single one.

03:19:14.720 --> 03:19:15.420
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess what happens?

03:19:15.600 --> 03:19:16.461
[SPEAKER_03]: They all suck.

03:19:16.581 --> 03:19:18.562
[SPEAKER_03]: All I'm just saying, it's not Tomb Raider.

03:19:18.623 --> 03:19:21.525
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more, you're not supposed to say it's Diablo, but it's Diablo.

03:19:22.926 --> 03:19:23.366
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

03:19:23.446 --> 03:19:25.307
[SPEAKER_04]: If I want to play Diablo, I'll play Diablo.

03:19:27.689 --> 03:19:36.135
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are all going to be out for the new 800 Microsoft price point, which is actually now 1,200 Microsoft points, or $15.

03:19:36.175 --> 03:19:36.275
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

03:19:38.257 --> 03:19:38.557
[SPEAKER_04]: PS15 is the new 5

03:19:52.520 --> 03:19:54.281
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not getting a lot of calls on Skype tonight.

03:19:54.301 --> 03:19:55.061
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what's going on.

03:19:55.121 --> 03:19:56.642
[SPEAKER_03]: Is something wrong with our line?

03:19:56.862 --> 03:19:57.462
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the deal?

03:19:57.722 --> 03:19:58.662
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the dealio?

03:19:59.723 --> 03:20:01.764
[SPEAKER_11]: Give us a call already, geez.

03:20:01.784 --> 03:20:02.584
[SPEAKER_03]: 877-GAME-OLR.

03:20:03.144 --> 03:20:05.285
[SPEAKER_04]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

03:20:06.666 --> 03:20:13.829
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another cave shmup game coming to Xbox Live Arcade, Gouange, and it's going to be released worldwide.

03:20:14.649 --> 03:20:18.090
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's go into the call.

03:20:18.410 --> 03:20:19.271
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

03:20:19.291 --> 03:20:19.611
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

03:20:20.698 --> 03:20:22.539
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, good old-fashioned Legend of Zaku here.

03:20:22.559 --> 03:20:24.259
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hello, Legend of Zaku.

03:20:24.299 --> 03:20:24.999
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

03:20:25.019 --> 03:20:26.219
[SPEAKER_12]: Even old-fashioned.

03:20:26.920 --> 03:20:28.260
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, nothing much, really.

03:20:28.320 --> 03:20:33.041
[SPEAKER_08]: Just, like, getting back from, like, excursions with my girlfriend over the weekend.

03:20:33.521 --> 03:20:35.182
[SPEAKER_08]: But not anywhere interesting.

03:20:35.842 --> 03:20:37.562
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know you had a girly friend now.

03:20:37.782 --> 03:20:38.442
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your name?

03:20:39.583 --> 03:20:40.383
[SPEAKER_08]: My name's April.

03:20:40.443 --> 03:20:42.603
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been together for about, like, four months now.

03:20:42.903 --> 03:20:44.984
[SPEAKER_03]: Is she a reporter for a major newspaper?

03:20:45.734 --> 03:20:46.314
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

03:20:46.334 --> 03:20:48.054
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob!

03:20:48.355 --> 03:20:49.955
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was a television station.

03:20:50.075 --> 03:20:50.575
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to.

03:20:50.635 --> 03:20:51.355
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it was a TV.

03:20:51.395 --> 03:20:51.995
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget.

03:20:52.035 --> 03:20:53.916
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, April!

03:20:54.136 --> 03:20:54.616
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

03:20:55.736 --> 03:21:10.939
[SPEAKER_08]: Besides DDRX2 release, another thing that I noticed was that the former Infinity Ward employees are actually ratcheting up their suit against Activision with more details as to how much Activision created a hostile environment for them.

03:21:12.122 --> 03:21:20.226
[SPEAKER_08]: Stuff like, you know, their top executives telling the Infinity Ward folks to get over it regarding the bonuses that they were promised.

03:21:20.986 --> 03:21:23.947
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically being interrogated in secrecy.

03:21:24.487 --> 03:21:30.090
[SPEAKER_08]: Stuff that you would see in some sort of like, you know, stuff that you would see during the Soviet Union days.

03:21:30.750 --> 03:21:34.031
[SPEAKER_08]: Where you had a secret police interrogate people out of nowhere.

03:21:34.672 --> 03:21:35.272
[SPEAKER_08]: And just try to...

03:21:35.512 --> 03:21:39.896
[SPEAKER_03]: Did Activision recently exchange 10 spies for 4 of Infinity Ward's spies?

03:21:39.976 --> 03:21:41.938
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of them was this really hot redhead?

03:21:41.958 --> 03:21:42.698
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps.

03:21:43.019 --> 03:21:44.120
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I saw something on that.

03:21:44.140 --> 03:21:53.768
[SPEAKER_08]: But I guess it's to the point where they literally withheld bonuses unless they churned out another Modern Warfare game to be completed November of next year.

03:21:53.868 --> 03:21:54.489
[SPEAKER_08]: Stuff like that.

03:21:54.709 --> 03:21:58.853
[SPEAKER_08]: They were basically being whored out to spit out nothing but Modern Warfare.

03:21:59.193 --> 03:22:00.615
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's interesting?

03:22:00.875 --> 03:22:00.975
What?

03:22:01.295 --> 03:22:29.327
[SPEAKER_03]: something similar to what you're saying right now was brought up earlier in the show and it was when Loki was talking about Crackdown 2 and you know we mentioned oh Crackdown 2 has been getting a lot of crap because it's just like Crackdown 1 and we were talking about how the developers had to start from scratch and you know they should just have waited and not say they're going to patch it on the back end and then Drew kind of chimed in and said well that was probably the publisher not the developer and it's kind of interesting because this whole thing you're talking about is publisher bullying the developer

03:22:30.612 --> 03:22:31.332
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, exactly.

03:22:31.732 --> 03:22:40.034
[SPEAKER_08]: This goes back to the point of who holds the strings and how much power is being wielded by Activision.

03:22:40.114 --> 03:22:44.155
[SPEAKER_08]: In this sense, they're swinging that big stick of theirs, no pun intended.

03:22:44.235 --> 03:22:46.035
[SPEAKER_08]: Who has the bigger penis?

03:22:46.055 --> 03:22:47.876
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's how it usually is.

03:22:47.936 --> 03:22:49.476
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember Hellgate London?

03:22:50.536 --> 03:22:54.197
[SPEAKER_02]: That had numerous problems with it, but they had to make the Halloween release date.

03:22:56.134 --> 03:23:06.525
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I mean, Infinity Ward met their deadline ahead of schedule, and yet they're basically asking twice as much from them for very little in exchange.

03:23:06.845 --> 03:23:12.230
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going as far as just giving them crumbs of their bonuses.

03:23:12.411 --> 03:23:15.414
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put out a pro tip to all the publishers of the world out there.

03:23:15.534 --> 03:23:17.015
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, in general...

03:23:17.956 --> 03:23:21.778
[SPEAKER_03]: Are gamers going to be pissed if you keep pushing a game back and back and back and back?

03:23:21.918 --> 03:23:25.681
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they're going to be pissed off and there's going to be rabble rabble on the internet.

03:23:25.721 --> 03:23:31.684
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the day, when that game comes out, do you want to actually sell copies of the game?

03:23:31.824 --> 03:23:34.226
[SPEAKER_03]: If so, it should probably be a good game.

03:23:34.566 --> 03:23:36.327
[SPEAKER_03]: So my advice to the publishers of the world...

03:23:36.767 --> 03:23:39.048
[SPEAKER_03]: Take the time to get it right.

03:23:39.369 --> 03:23:43.011
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to go through a little bit of belly aching and pains while you make it right?

03:23:43.091 --> 03:23:47.373
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but at the end of the day, it's going to be worth it because if the game kicks ass, there you go.

03:23:48.654 --> 03:23:51.576
[SPEAKER_03]: How many of you remember, never forget, Super Smash Bros.

03:23:52.116 --> 03:23:58.640
[SPEAKER_03]: Brawl, the new one on the GameCube, on the Wii, was delayed like twice.

03:23:59.161 --> 03:24:01.402
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of them was a huge delay, like six months, right?

03:24:01.422 --> 03:24:04.925
[SPEAKER_08]: They spent more time on it, and as a result, the quality increased.

03:24:04.985 --> 03:24:12.970
[SPEAKER_08]: Now this goes back to my point where Hideo Kojima recently said that Japanese developers are pretty much, they're lacking ambition and creativity.

03:24:13.430 --> 03:24:19.474
[SPEAKER_08]: Something that Activision loves to, you know, this is the same card that Activision plays by milking their franchises to death.

03:24:19.995 --> 03:24:21.536
[SPEAKER_08]: The Japanese are doing likewise.

03:24:24.477 --> 03:24:28.197
[SPEAKER_08]: In other words, if an idea is out of their comfort zone, they're not going to pursue it.

03:24:28.217 --> 03:24:34.759
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more profitable to just create a new sequel of X RPG or X fighting game.

03:24:35.119 --> 03:24:37.739
[SPEAKER_03]: SalaciousPop in our chatroom gives another excellent example.

03:24:37.899 --> 03:24:44.501
[SPEAKER_03]: Arkham Asylum was delayed at least twice, but everyone immediately forgot their angst about it when it hit because it was really good.

03:24:46.661 --> 03:24:50.142
[SPEAKER_03]: I just said last week on the show, I think Final Fantasy XIV should be delayed.

03:24:50.262 --> 03:24:53.223
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the Valves and Blizzards of the world.

03:24:53.243 --> 03:24:58.944
[SPEAKER_02]: They might take forever, but the games they finally do release are worth the wait.

03:24:59.624 --> 03:25:00.765
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, that's the whole point.

03:25:01.165 --> 03:25:09.747
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why, but then, you know, that doesn't fit well, that doesn't bode well with the public companies and shareholders because they want results in the short term.

03:25:10.908 --> 03:25:13.088
[SPEAKER_08]: or else they're going to stop investing money in that company.

03:25:13.588 --> 03:25:20.890
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is where Activision makes its bread and butter by doing sequels in the short term and not really preparing for long-term investments.

03:25:20.910 --> 03:25:21.510
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

03:25:22.350 --> 03:25:24.831
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Zaku, we've got to let you go to see if anyone else is going to call in.

03:25:25.591 --> 03:25:27.511
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't forget DDRX2 came out in Japan.

03:25:27.531 --> 03:25:27.691
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

03:25:27.731 --> 03:25:28.171
[SPEAKER_03]: We heard.

03:25:28.231 --> 03:25:28.591
[SPEAKER_03]: We heard.

03:25:28.631 --> 03:25:30.872
[SPEAKER_03]: Really quick, what did you think of the remixes?

03:25:31.132 --> 03:25:32.872
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't heard them yet, but what do you think of that whole idea?

03:25:32.892 --> 03:25:33.472
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot better.

03:25:33.512 --> 03:25:34.892
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the song was a lot better.

03:25:35.592 --> 03:25:36.713
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's something that blows...

03:25:38.573 --> 03:25:44.901
[SPEAKER_08]: In other words, a lot better than what Supernova and possibly Xtreme has offered to blow ZDRX out of the water initially.

03:25:45.141 --> 03:25:47.263
[SPEAKER_03]: Are MP3s out there on the internet now?

03:25:47.884 --> 03:25:50.267
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear these remix songs?

03:25:50.287 --> 03:25:51.689
[SPEAKER_08]: They've already had videos of it.

03:25:51.729 --> 03:25:55.193
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they still have the stupid tokens and all that garbage to download stuff?

03:25:56.214 --> 03:25:56.695
[SPEAKER_08]: I doubt it.

03:25:56.755 --> 03:25:57.816
[SPEAKER_08]: I lost track anyways.

03:25:58.877 --> 03:26:01.518
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll tell you how long it's been since I've been following TDR.

03:26:01.978 --> 03:26:03.158
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to that site.

03:26:03.178 --> 03:26:05.399
[SPEAKER_08]: They're updating the list as we speak.

03:26:05.419 --> 03:26:06.979
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do I get the songs on here?

03:26:06.999 --> 03:26:08.160
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to play some for the listeners.

03:26:08.200 --> 03:26:08.700
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do I go?

03:26:08.720 --> 03:26:09.920
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be a while.

03:26:10.601 --> 03:26:13.321
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to have to wait a while until they get good line-out recordings.

03:26:14.142 --> 03:26:14.882
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's the videos?

03:26:15.022 --> 03:26:15.622
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's the videos?

03:26:16.022 --> 03:26:18.003
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they here?

03:26:18.123 --> 03:26:19.803
[SPEAKER_08]: It should be one of the top stories.

03:26:20.143 --> 03:26:21.224
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at it.

03:26:21.284 --> 03:26:23.785
[SPEAKER_03]: Dance Dance Revolution X2 released song list update.

03:26:23.805 --> 03:26:24.385
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are the videos?

03:26:24.845 --> 03:26:25.225
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are they?

03:26:26.205 --> 03:26:27.426
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep scrolling down.

03:26:27.446 --> 03:26:28.326
[SPEAKER_08]: There's YouTube links.

03:26:29.320 --> 03:26:30.801
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let me see, let me see, let me see.

03:26:31.221 --> 03:26:32.001
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know how I'll do this.

03:26:32.021 --> 03:26:33.702
[SPEAKER_03]: Control-Find, YouTube.

03:26:33.902 --> 03:26:34.162
[SPEAKER_03]: Aha!

03:26:34.963 --> 03:26:36.163
[SPEAKER_03]: Video with intro of X2.

03:26:36.183 --> 03:26:36.664
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want that.

03:26:37.604 --> 03:26:38.164
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot.

03:26:39.205 --> 03:26:47.048
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them are, the quality on some of them is a little... Oh, God!

03:26:47.108 --> 03:26:48.449
[SPEAKER_03]: The interface looks like Universe 3.

03:26:48.589 --> 03:26:48.849
[SPEAKER_03]: What in...

03:26:58.891 --> 03:27:04.315
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the backgrounds look cute.

03:27:05.856 --> 03:27:07.277
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like your run's really smooth.

03:27:08.398 --> 03:27:12.321
[SPEAKER_08]: You should be happy that they brought back Captain Jack in this one, so now you can play this again.

03:27:14.163 --> 03:27:15.624
[SPEAKER_03]: How about a different Captain Jack song?

03:27:15.664 --> 03:27:17.185
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I agree with SSJ100, Matt.

03:27:17.205 --> 03:27:21.368
[SPEAKER_08]: The original one hasn't made an appearance as extreme, and that's all you can say?

03:27:21.508 --> 03:27:25.792
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like eight years absent from a DDR mix.

03:27:26.397 --> 03:27:28.038
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was in a DDR mix.

03:27:28.058 --> 03:27:28.959
[SPEAKER_03]: How about a new Captain Jackson?

03:27:28.979 --> 03:27:32.201
[SPEAKER_08]: But it hasn't been in a DDR mix in almost eight years.

03:27:32.281 --> 03:27:32.981
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, all right.

03:27:33.282 --> 03:27:34.903
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's been hard to obtain that license.

03:27:35.283 --> 03:27:35.703
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

03:27:35.723 --> 03:27:38.205
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and my fat ass hasn't played DDR in about the same time.

03:27:38.265 --> 03:27:40.206
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I'm letting you go, Zaku.

03:27:40.286 --> 03:27:41.207
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one, okay?

03:27:41.767 --> 03:27:42.587
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, have a good one too.

03:27:42.607 --> 03:27:44.769
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care.

03:27:44.789 --> 03:27:47.090
[SPEAKER_03]: 877-GAME-OLR, his name on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

03:27:47.150 --> 03:27:49.811
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma in our chat says, holy shit, DDRX2 has Super Driver.

03:27:49.851 --> 03:27:50.932
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was that song I was playing.

03:27:51.292 --> 03:27:52.112
[SPEAKER_03]: Right there, Super Driver.

03:27:54.954 --> 03:27:59.856
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently it has like Cascada and all these other cute little songs in there.

03:27:59.876 --> 03:28:01.697
[SPEAKER_03]: 877-GAME-OLR, his name on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

03:28:01.717 --> 03:28:02.778
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really not getting any calls.

03:28:02.858 --> 03:28:04.799
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, is it time to end the show?

03:28:05.279 --> 03:28:06.180
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, oh, it might be.

03:28:06.220 --> 03:28:07.480
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost like 10 o'clock already.

03:28:08.001 --> 03:28:08.821
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that is going to do it for this.

03:28:08.841 --> 03:28:11.022
[SPEAKER_10]: People are ready for sleep, and some people have to work tomorrow.

03:28:11.062 --> 03:28:13.204
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're ready for the skyplanes, or done with the skyplanes.

03:28:13.384 --> 03:28:13.804
[SPEAKER_03]: Not me.

03:28:14.284 --> 03:28:14.645
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

03:28:16.606 --> 03:28:16.906
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

03:28:16.926 --> 03:28:22.469
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to wrap things up here and be on our way out of here tonight, but thank you guys for tuning in tonight.

03:28:23.270 --> 03:28:25.691
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, though, quickly if we have any other last-minute stories, Loki.

03:28:27.546 --> 03:28:29.127
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

03:28:49.443 --> 03:28:52.585
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought because we can't end the show until we get the final thoughts.

03:28:52.925 --> 03:28:56.026
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew Nami, thanks for being here again and hope you had fun.

03:28:57.027 --> 03:28:58.367
[SPEAKER_03]: Expect me over here more often.

03:28:58.987 --> 03:28:59.708
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too much so.

03:28:59.768 --> 03:29:00.748
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a break once in a while.

03:29:00.788 --> 03:29:01.749
[SPEAKER_03]: It's our show, damn it.

03:29:01.849 --> 03:29:02.349
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

03:29:03.329 --> 03:29:04.170
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome whenever you want.

03:29:04.190 --> 03:29:05.630
[SPEAKER_11]: Next time you have to wear the Mickey hat.

03:29:06.131 --> 03:29:09.452
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a final thought for us tonight?

03:29:10.913 --> 03:29:11.933
[SPEAKER_02]: My mind is a blank.

03:29:12.513 --> 03:29:14.054
[SPEAKER_02]: We have more to come next week though.

03:29:14.594 --> 03:29:15.715
[SPEAKER_02]: I have more ideas.

03:29:16.436 --> 03:29:22.727
[SPEAKER_03]: you were telling me can I just say we were talking about OnLive and how that's out but nobody here has really played it yet

03:29:22.918 --> 03:29:27.061
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's been really kind of under the radar and a lot of people consider it to be vaporware.

03:29:27.121 --> 03:29:28.602
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that can be your little task.

03:29:29.402 --> 03:29:29.582
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.

03:29:29.823 --> 03:29:30.183
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

03:29:30.223 --> 03:29:30.683
[SPEAKER_03]: Task.

03:29:31.964 --> 03:29:33.905
[SPEAKER_03]: Something before DarkSakura gets to her final thought.

03:29:33.945 --> 03:29:36.727
[SPEAKER_03]: I meant to bring this up during housekeeping and I completely forgot.

03:29:37.188 --> 03:29:39.749
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe you're still going, but I know I am for sure.

03:29:39.809 --> 03:29:41.050
[SPEAKER_03]: Saturday, California Extreme.

03:29:41.310 --> 03:29:41.891
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yes.

03:29:42.231 --> 03:29:45.293
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've had chatters ask, when are you ever going to California Extreme?

03:29:45.313 --> 03:29:46.734
[SPEAKER_03]: Because years and years, like it's been going.

03:29:47.214 --> 03:29:49.396
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been to California Extreme all the last couple years.

03:29:49.536 --> 03:29:50.196
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been.

03:29:50.637 --> 03:29:51.357
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you go last year?

03:29:51.377 --> 03:29:52.778
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't think you went last year or the year before.

03:29:53.038 --> 03:29:55.101
[SPEAKER_12]: I went last year and I went the year before and I went the year before that.

03:29:55.381 --> 03:29:57.344
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're both going to be there this Saturday.

03:29:57.584 --> 03:29:59.506
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadly, Loki's got a pregnant wife so he can't go.

03:29:59.747 --> 03:30:00.548
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're going to both go.

03:30:00.568 --> 03:30:01.489
[SPEAKER_12]: Carpool, come with us.

03:30:01.909 --> 03:30:05.013
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't because I go early to spend boyfriend time.

03:30:05.334 --> 03:30:06.996
[SPEAKER_03]: But you guys will have fun.

03:30:07.016 --> 03:30:07.576
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll meet up there.

03:30:07.677 --> 03:30:09.459
[SPEAKER_12]: We are also meeting Mel and Melody.

03:30:09.761 --> 03:30:25.497
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, I hope to meet up with them too, so we'll have fun So we're not like participating in the show or anything We're going as spectators just like the rest of you But we'll be around There will be write-ups on both Orange Jones Radio and on Geek Life There may even be some vlogging

03:30:26.218 --> 03:30:50.284
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll see also I just want to throw out there though follow us on Twitter twitter.com slash OLR because if you want to meet up with us at the show that's where we'll be posting updates because I don't even know what's at the show or what the layout's like it's in Santa Clara now oh really if we're going to do a meet up so it's not even at the convention center I'm used to if we're going to do a meet up we'll have to tweet something also it's more expensive to pre-register

03:30:51.400 --> 03:30:52.341
[SPEAKER_03]: Redone Donkey Kong

03:31:16.349 --> 03:31:17.950
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a new Donkey Kong project.

03:31:17.970 --> 03:31:18.730
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Donkey Kong 2.

03:31:20.430 --> 03:31:25.111
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.

03:31:26.872 --> 03:31:29.193
[SPEAKER_12]: I want pie or a milkshake.

03:31:29.773 --> 03:31:30.113
[SPEAKER_03]: Or both.

03:31:30.493 --> 03:31:31.613
[SPEAKER_12]: I blame Loki for that.

03:31:32.513 --> 03:31:34.234
[SPEAKER_12]: But I really want something sweet.

03:31:35.799 --> 03:31:36.640
[SPEAKER_03]: What is in a mango?

03:31:37.240 --> 03:31:41.541
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is I'm going to want more Tylenol in about 30 minutes.

03:31:42.182 --> 03:31:42.682
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some.

03:31:42.962 --> 03:31:43.802
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I have some too.

03:31:45.023 --> 03:31:45.303
[SPEAKER_03]: Issues.

03:31:46.883 --> 03:31:47.704
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your final thought.

03:31:50.365 --> 03:31:51.605
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to paint more of the room.

03:31:52.365 --> 03:31:52.946
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

03:31:53.706 --> 03:32:01.769
[SPEAKER_12]: I did think of you because I found more Mario things that people have made online.

03:32:02.625 --> 03:32:03.466
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

03:32:04.326 --> 03:32:09.689
[SPEAKER_04]: Nellie was supposed to be posting pictures online of the progress I've made, but she has failed to do that.

03:32:09.989 --> 03:32:11.490
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to make the hamper for you.

03:32:12.091 --> 03:32:12.571
[SPEAKER_04]: The hamper?

03:32:12.931 --> 03:32:13.171
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

03:32:14.432 --> 03:32:15.213
[SPEAKER_03]: The diaper hamper?

03:32:16.153 --> 03:32:17.634
[SPEAKER_03]: The poop warp pipe?

03:32:18.975 --> 03:32:19.555
[SPEAKER_12]: The warp pipe.

03:32:19.955 --> 03:32:20.196
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

03:32:21.837 --> 03:32:23.318
[SPEAKER_12]: I have an idea that I've drawn up.

03:32:23.378 --> 03:32:24.898
[SPEAKER_12]: I just have to find the sketchbook I put it in.

03:32:24.918 --> 03:32:25.539
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

03:32:25.559 --> 03:32:25.719
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
