13917	18524	Tonight, July 11th, 2010, could a cell phone be built into the 3DS?
18925	25616	A trial date is set for Infinity Ward vs. Activision, and Microsoft teams up with Fast Food to promote a Kinect game.
31673	36576	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36636	39858	It is the show where every gamer has a voice.
39918	41379	Thanks so much for tuning in to us tonight.
41719	50745	We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show, www.allgames.com.
50765	52566	We're going to talk about video games.
53126	54727	Gaming Culture, Gamer Lifestyle.
55187	56088	My name is Rob Roberts.
56108	57508	I'll be joining you over the next few hours.
57849	62171	Joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
62591	66874	How you doing, Jamie Summers?
68875	76339	Now, I noticed, as we promised two weeks ago, because we didn't have a show because of the 4th of July, you did not come in here as Inspector Gadget tonight.
76479	78160	Is everything okay with the fingers?
78930	82352	My surgery got delayed to Tuesday because of a scheduling issue.
83312	84773	Well, good for us though.
84993	87054	Couldn't ship in the bionic parts.
89075	96338	No, basically the thing is that my visit with my last surgeon was set up as my consultation.
96358	97639	He was just going to refer me into surgery.
98019	100800	Except he didn't put surgery in the thing.
101721	103682	I've already filled out all my FMLA and everything.
103862	105503	So my new doctor is just like...
106303	112766	We'll go ahead and write your leave starting Friday, which is what it was supposed to have been.
113867	119109	And then I go in Tuesday at 2 o'clock Pacific to have my hand flayed.
119850	121871	And I think they're going to put me under this time.
122911	124873	Oh, you don't get to watch.
125093	129697	Well, the only logic, the only reason I think this is because they're telling me not to eat beforehand.
130357	133219	So usually that's a sign that they're going to clunk you out.
133320	135401	Maybe they'll just numb like a lot of parts.
135521	138504	Like you won't be able to feel like the whole like left half of your body for a little while.
138524	143468	That's what happened the last time is that they damned off my arm so that there'd be no blood in my hand.
143908	144809	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
159181	160461	Were you just kind of using one hand?
161242	174246	For the most part, I mean, because really it was a lot of running around and, you know, and I was actually using, I had the controller in my lap when I wasn't, you know, walking and was pushing the button with a finger.
174506	184769	A lot of those RPGs like Final Fantasy, Blue Dragon, and so forth really lend themselves easy to like only having one hand because it's like A, attack, A, target creature, A, A, A, A, over and over, you know?
184829	188250	You remember that single-handed PlayStation controller, the RPG controller?
188830	189991	Oh, vaguely, yes.
190011	191331	I think I've got one somewhere.
191511	192132	Vaguely.
192292	192432	Yeah.
192652	194213	They weren't very popular, I don't think.
194273	195153	Maybe, well, he's not here.
195353	197574	I think we just were given one or something.
197734	197974	Nice.
198255	199815	Single hand control schemes are always nice.
199835	200716	Remember Earthbound?
202056	204357	Alright, we got a lot of other voices I haven't even introduced yet.
205518	207239	I do have to, well, I'll talk about it later.
207339	210520	Alright, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki as well.
212301	213902	He was drinking a shake.
214901	215521	It was hot outside.
215541	217622	I didn't mean to inconvenience you, I'm sorry.
217682	221083	No, it's hot outside, so it was the coldest thing I could think of.
221103	223603	It's just going to make me really thirsty later.
224084	224664	The irony.
224844	231926	Is it funny when you're hearing about this East Coast heat wave, and they're like, OMG, it's 100 degrees, and I'm like, that's like Wednesday here.
232686	236927	My friend in Canada was posting about it being, I think, 80.
238007	240488	She gave it to me in Celsius.
242771	245231	If it's 80 degrees Celsius, I don't want to be over there.
245491	246992	That's very hot, actually.
247852	249252	Isn't that like 180 degrees?
249772	250352	Anyway, forget it.
250752	252433	Here's the thing.
252993	257233	Obviously, I'm joking a little bit because I know the East Coast isn't really built to handle the heat.
257353	259134	Here, everything's got air conditioning.
259334	260894	You don't have a house without central air.
260934	261854	That's unheard of.
264015	270776	I know it kind of sucked for them, but it does make me laugh when I hear 100 degrees, panic, panic, panic because I'm like, wake me when it's 113.
272436	274397	I spent the weekend in the Bay Area.
274457	278458	You drive to the Bay Area, it's like cold and windy still.
278858	279659	It's crazy.
279739	285821	I had friends come up this weekend and they were from Santa Cruz and they said, yeah, it's like a high of 71.
286041	289162	I'm like, that'd be nice.
289722	292804	All right, we're also going to introduce, he's back this week.
292844	297546	I don't know what the heck's going on here, but he's here two weeks in a row-ish, because we didn't really do a show last week.
297566	300368	But say hello to intern Drew Nami, he's here tonight.
300588	302629	Hi guys, just trying to make it a habit again.
302749	303210	I see.
304210	305551	See, I know what you're trying to do.
305631	309153	You're trying to squeeze into Loki's chair when he's out on paternity leave.
309193	311574	That's what you're trying to do, I think.
311614	312715	Don't think I don't know what you're up to.
313175	315397	I know nothing, nothing.
315957	317318	Loki is irreplaceable.
318879	319820	I don't know.
320421	321843	Knowing him, he won't even be gone.
321863	324406	He'll be like, you know, I just had the baby this morning, but I'm here.
324646	328551	Well, I remember when he was the intern, he was on the floor and he didn't get pizza.
329432	329913	Alright, look.
331752	332392	And how have you been?
332452	333252	How's life been treating you?
333272	335133	How was the 4th of July for you?
335453	353623	Just mostly sat and listened to the fireworks go off Watched a couple fireworks displays in WoW and played some Left 4 Dead Watched fireworks in WoW, probably better than the ones I spent $50 on, that's for sure I also watched fireworks in Animal Crossing I missed the fireworks from Final Fantasy 11, remember that?
354143	355325	Oh, that's right.
355445	356206	Oh, my gosh.
356226	357427	A lot of MMOs do that stuff.
358929	359409	Good times.
359429	359709	Good times.
360330	360590	All right.
361351	366797	Yeah, I spent $50 on safe and sane fireworks, which is all we're allowed in this area.
366837	368159	So that lasts about, like, what, five minutes?
368179	368259	Yeah.
368923	374932	Oh wait, $50 on safe and sane fireworks and I just get to hear the idiots down the street shooting off bottle rockets.
375072	376093	Maybe about 20 minutes.
376113	377455	Yeah, you gotta love all the signs everywhere.
377535	381141	Zero tolerance on illegal fireworks and all the neighbors all over.
381181	383885	We won't tolerate it, but we also won't do anything about it.
386263	387564	But it was fine.
387584	389426	I had a good night.
389466	391268	I hope all of you had a good 4th of July as well.
391308	394450	Unless you're overseas and maybe you didn't really celebrate the 4th.
394510	396612	But I hope you had a good week nonetheless.
396973	398934	We're back here with Orange Lawns Radio after our week off.
400856	401977	Shezro's in our chat room.
402037	404219	Chat.OrangeLawnsRadio.com saying, Wow, $50?
404620	405120	What the fuck?
405160	405680	God damn.
405761	406982	That is the exact quote actually.
407342	407842	What the fuck?
407862	408323	God damn.
409204	409764	Here's the thing though.
410044	412627	A lot of charities set up booths here.
413047	414128	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
442042	443824	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
458617	481643	They had this giant inflatable barrel that looked like an explosive barrel or something They had 50,000 signs that were out there They had signs literally blocks away They had people waving signs to go buy their fireworks And they were offering all sorts of discounts And I was like, no, they suck I'm still not buying them Oh, and they had a bounce house
482674	483736	That's crazy.
483876	484478	That's a lot of stuff.
484518	486061	All the money that they spend on their advertising?
486722	487945	Not going to make it up with the fireworks.
489897	495962	Sorry kids, we were going to donate money to the orphanage, but now we actually have to sell the orphanage to pay for these fireworks.
496063	502688	You do have to wonder about a charity organization that spends all this money on that stuff.
502788	511896	I don't know, I feel a little more for the handwritten in crayon on the poster board, support our school, I'm more about that stuff.
513557	514518	You're very grassroots.
515143	516123	I am very grassroots.
516323	517344	Hello, look at this show.
518664	524045	Been going for eight years and still haven't been bought by the man yet.
525966	529087	Fireworks are not good just for the 4th of July.
529607	530707	He needs them all year round.
533508	534988	We had illegal ones.
536109	536929	Shame on you.
538689	540470	You had a party on the 3rd, right?
541190	542490	We had a block party.
542811	544231	So you did fireworks the night before?
544770	547691	And then I did the night after and the night after that and the night after that.
548472	552594	I remember one year I bought like $30, $40 worth of fireworks.
552794	553614	Fireworks.
553654	554235	Fireworks.
554295	554775	Work, work.
555295	555695	Fireworks.
555735	557856	And I brought them to one of Jamie's house parties.
557976	563019	But because there were so many fireworks here, they never got set off.
563059	564700	So I went home with a box of fireworks.
564720	565720	It's just funny how you're talking.
565740	566000	What a shame.
566060	567061	I could use them year round.
567181	567541	Year round.
567981	570625	I actually ended up using them the next year.
571466	572728	I sat on them for a whole year.
572788	574391	We had real metal sparklers too.
574631	574932	Did you?
575533	577996	And those little wizard things that go down the street.
579278	580821	And bottle rockets and...
581343	582824	The ground flowers are awesome.
598979	601060	So maybe they're just really good about soliciting donations.
601100	601860	I guess that's a good point.
603180	604381	Wait, wait, wait.
604521	606741	They're good at soliciting donations.
607241	608902	Why sell the fireworks anyway?
609342	611242	Get the money donated.
611603	613623	SSJ100Matt says, Rob, I am the man.
613783	614683	How much for the show?
615083	620425	And also, I invited Rob, and he didn't respond to it, talking about his party that he had, and he called me a dick.
621265	625008	Actually, actually, I put myself down as a maybe.
625948	634814	For those that don't know, I yelled at SSJ100Matt last week because he called into the show saying he was having a 4th of July party and what classic game should they play and I said I didn't get an invite.
635215	637836	Keep in mind I live in California and SSJ100Matt's in New York City.
638337	643640	So he did send me an invite on Facebook and I responded maybe because that's what you do to all the invites on Facebook.
643660	644681	You put yourself down as a maybe.
644941	647023	It's not like there's going to be any fireworks there anyway.
647503	650045	I usually just say no and then when I show up it's a surprise.
652697	654319	Al-Qaeda Al-Qaeda Al-Qaeda
669896	671237	That is not a funny prank.
671837	672978	It's a hilarious prank.
673138	673718	It's not funny.
673758	675619	It's one that'll get you killed, but it's funny.
677480	689206	What about instead of something kind of hot button like that, you do like just this really like obscure charity organization like trying to launch a horse into space organization.
689346	689946	Now that's funny.
690286	692087	How about the people that are trying to build a Gundam?
693746	696308	I don't know why it's not been done yet You get strippers
716090	717031	DarkSakura.com
742725	744926	They will clean out that fireworks stand.
744966	745446	That's true.
745526	745806	Easy.
746066	746526	Think about it.
746586	749487	Who's the stereotypical person that's going out to buy the fireworks?
749727	751388	It's, you know, the older brother.
751408	752448	Men that want to blow stuff up.
752468	753649	Men that want to blow things up.
753769	754349	No offense, Jamie.
754389	755389	I know you want to blow things up, too.
755449	756850	But I think you'd have fun with strippers.
758190	760851	Strippers love... Here's another thing you need to keep in mind.
762132	764613	Strippers love other women.
765113	767854	They'll get way freakier with other women than they will with men.
768194	768354	Yeah.
768894	769854	Unless you're a gay man.
769914	771395	I know this from experience, sadly.
772195	775197	It's the whole point of threatening.
777018	778900	I think it has to do with the level of threat.
780241	785304	I'm telling you, if you have a stand with a bounce house and you have a stand with strippers, I'm going with the stripper stand.
785544	787305	How about a stand with strippers and a bounce house?
789011	789551	DarkSakura
813763	825154	I know, I've seen those bras hanging up to dry in there I'm like, oh my god A hamster could live in there Alright Actually What?
826736	833763	Four hamsters Alright, we love you DarkSakura and we love your breasts Tell us a little bit How was your gaming week?
833783	835545	You did get to do some games this week, right?
835891	837933	Yeah, I played Star Trek Online.
839414	840915	And that's about it.
841515	842376	Well, no.
845218	847339	No, actually, I think that is all I played was Star Trek Online.
847379	851682	Because I made Captain, and then I took a little break.
851943	856386	And now I'm trying... I have this goal to reach Admiral by Tuesday morning.
856926	858127	And then go have my surgery done.
859648	862931	So I'm at Captain 5 now.
863471	864171	And so I have...
866229	867169	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
882757	884159	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
899498	908645	Now the stuff that you actually can buy in the game, like right now they actually unlocked all of the pre-order bonuses that you can buy.
908745	909666	So I have everything now.
909786	912688	So you now can have a joint trail if you want to and I already paid.
913408	919973	Actually, I think I already paid about the equivalent anyway to have the joint trail because I got another... Anyway, long story.
920694	923676	So, um... I, um...
925942	926763	I've just been playing that.
926983	928664	And I have my... Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
928844	929785	I played Peggle.
929805	934049	A lot of Peggle on my phone.
935850	936310	Good times.
936351	936751	The end.
937451	939393	Any idea what you might play when you're down to one hand?
941515	944757	Well... Video game-wise?
947820	948560	There's always Peggle.
948580	949101	Peggle.
950736	952457	Yeah, I could actually play Peggle with my phone.
953278	953598	Okay.
953818	961804	This is a good thing about the iPhone, though, is that I can actually do, like, I could, I think I could actually get away with playing S-Baluga.
962044	963305	You need an RPG.
963325	963765	You know what?
964565	966207	I'll just loan you Final Fantasy XIII this week.
966327	967588	That way you have an RPG to play.
968148	970469	And you can talk about something besides Star Trek Online on this program.
970489	972091	Well, I was going to try to finish Blue Dragon.
972171	973411	I knew I forgot to bring something.
973612	976153	I was going to try to finish Blue Dragon, but... Okay, well, there's that, too.
976353	977434	Final Fantasy XIII would be great.
977854	978975	I'm really looking forward to playing it.
979395	979636	All right.
980576	1009802	and um other than that we've been playing the get rid of shit game fun as you can tell by the state of this room i don't know it seems like look in the closet okay well yeah there's a lot less shit in there who's the who's the cartoony picture up there i don't that's the picture that tiara did for for me of characters okay they're characters i'm like these aren't people i know are they it's a cute picture but it's she does good stuff sorry isn't that awesome radio we're talking about pictures all right but i also hung up my my bat house collage

1012084	1015227	And I made this thing which I'm about to put on the board.
1016368	1018230	At least you can take a picture and put it on our website, right?
1018250	1019190	I'm going to put it on the website, yeah.
1019231	1019811	Alright, there you go.
1020031	1022193	Because I felt crafty.
1023194	1026357	Alright, let's... As in, I've not been working and I've been bored.
1026998	1027318	Bored.
1027999	1029540	Alright, let's move on to Loki.
1029580	1030301	How was your gaming week?
1031372	1038615	My game week was interesting, I guess, because I had a lot of different things I played that I haven't really been playing a lot of.
1040816	1045878	For example, I went back and dusted off a few music games this week, including DJ Hero.
1046838	1051380	Went and played some of the new tracks in the Party Mix thing, including the Lady Gaga...
1055473	1057855	Girls on Film Remix Rock Band
1076871	1087619	I tried playing a little bit more on the medium setting because I was so used to Guitar Freaks and stuff and never really tried experimenting with playing any of the harder difficulties.
1090201	1097846	I kind of like how Guitar Freaks, when they ramped up the difficulty, just had more notes on the three keys instead of adding just more keys to it.
1098027	1099848	I kind of like that a little bit better.
1100488	1100929	But, um...
1102844	1105005	I don't know, it was still fun.
1105925	1111248	And then, other than music games and stuff, I've been playing a lot of Crackdown 2.
1112268	1115369	And honestly, it's not that different from Crackdown 1.
1115910	1118211	Except they made leveling up a lot easier.
1120532	1122993	Not that it doesn't take as long, but...
1124301	1125882	They don't really have gangs this time.
1125942	1129325	It's just one big old gang that, you know, kind of attacks you everywhere.
1129405	1133568	And then at night you get these, like, zombie-like freaks or whatever that run around.
1134768	1137110	But there's so many of them and they're so easy to kill.
1137750	1145036	All you really have to do is, you know, like to level up your physical attack or whatever, you just keep hitting B over and over and over again.
1145516	1148258	And it just attacks all of them and you don't really take a lot of damage.
1148318	1151040	And say you do take a lot of damage, you just kind of jump out of the way and...
1151780	1155901	Wait until your health comes back and then go back down there and spam B some more.
1156781	1161163	Now, this game's been getting a lot of shit in the reviews for being just like the first game.
1162243	1164824	Do you think that's fair to knock the game for that?
1166564	1167124	Absolutely.
1167704	1169205	It's very similar to the first game.
1169245	1172346	And honestly, it should be more like the first game than it is right now.
1172946	1176607	The problem I have with it is that basically it's...
1178087	1179328	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1206500	1228759	This one, though, is completely linear because, I mean, granted you can kind of run around and do different things, but they want you to hit up, you know, this one point first and you have to turn on these beacons and then once the beacons are charged up you go into kind of a protection mission almost where you have to protect the beacon from the freaks while it, you know, charges up to destroy all of them.
1229679	1235284	And that's good and all, but it's kind of boring because all the missions are very similar.
1237490	1242551	I just... I wish it was more like the first game where you had a bunch of gangs and you could kind of tackle it the way it is.
1242631	1245472	The city itself is almost identical to the first city.
1245892	1252374	I mean, they've got a lot of... Like, if you've played the first game, you'll definitely recognize a lot of landmarks in there, which is kind of cool.
1252734	1258255	And some of the strongholds where these freaks are and stuff are actually where the old bosses were in the first game.
1258916	1259116	But...
1260456	1267364	It's just kind of, it's a little sad that some of the stuff that made the first game so good is kind of taken out.
1267404	1271969	Like the vehicles that transform when your driving skills is up, those aren't there anymore.
1272049	1275512	Instead, you just get actual different vehicles that have that stuff.
1276013	1280758	Or all the stuff that was from the download content, the different guns and whatnot are actually in the game.
1280798	1282040	You have to unlock them later on.
1282720	1289246	And it's harder for me to find these different points where you're supposed to be getting gear and stuff.
1289306	1293169	Now you have to choose your loadout and run around.
1293209	1300395	And then finally you have to find the actual spots where you've captured spots on the map where you can get more ammo and stuff.
1300735	1306301	And it doesn't matter anyways because these specialized guns that you have, you can't find ammo for them ever because the gang members don't carry them.
1306381	1310506	So once you've run out of your limited amount of ammo, you have to go just use their guns anyways.
1311086	1313369	SSJ100Matt is also pointing out something that's missing.
1313709	1317193	It's just like the first game, he says, minus a Halo beta packed in.
1317533	1319475	That's at chat.hornslaundry.com live.
1320676	1321397	Thanks for watching!
1342077	1343238	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1357554	1358035	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1377418	1378819	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1401258	1402719	And I hear that they're going to patch it.
1402819	1408965	They're going to patch it to add this feature back because it is kind of important that it should be there.
1409525	1412107	That excuse is getting old from all these companies.
1412207	1413689	It is really old.
1413709	1417191	Dude, we didn't finish the game in time because we needed to hit our release date.
1417632	1419654	But we'll patch it to fix it.
1420134	1421615	The whole promises promises.
1422116	1423617	Blame the publishers most of the time.
1424983	1425844	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1447407	1448068	Lisa's Game.
1448088	1448368	You think?
1448729	1448949	Yeah.
1449029	1451152	That's probably where they'll be, somewhere you haven't looked.
1451572	1455778	Keep in mind, everything that you look for is always in the last place you looked.
1456866	1485008	so this game though does have an option where you can ping the orbs and actually see them on your map briefly so you can hit the up button on the directional pad and it'll actually ping the orbs to see where they're around so for example you're kind of looking for them and you are stuck with like two left you can ping it and see where it's at on your map and kind of give you a better idea where to zero in on it thank god for that but just like some of the other stuff that's in the game it's I don't know it's just very hard to get used to I guess
1487657	1495123	Oh, and the guy that's talking to you throughout the entire game, kind of announcing things, he's annoying.
1495563	1496704	And I can't turn him off.
1497845	1498506	Which is annoying.
1499967	1502689	Because he's like, you should do these road races.
1502729	1504571	I'm like, I don't want to do road races right now.
1504731	1506332	You should do these road races.
1506372	1508114	They'll give you more driving skill.
1508414	1510576	Hey, there's a rooftop race you just walked by.
1510596	1511676	I'm like, I don't care.
1512137	1516460	Maybe you should go to that beacon because it's not going to charge itself.
1516620	1517341	It's like, stop
1522623	1524023	Watch out, there's freaks at night.
1524103	1524343	Really?
1524443	1527084	I didn't figure that out by spending the last 20 days in the game.
1527124	1529725	You know, I can't figure out that the freaks come out at night.
1530485	1532166	Oh, watch out, there's a stronghold over here.
1532226	1532466	Really?
1532526	1533687	That's what that means on the map?
1533727	1535927	Because you've already told me that three times now.
1536607	1538348	It's just very annoying.
1539328	1540969	They should have an option to tick that off.
1542003	1547910	Tell you once when you're starting the game because they kind of do explain everything and then be done with it.
1548110	1551054	Stop bothering me with stuff unless it's actually important.
1552390	1553831	Anything else with your Game of the Week, Loki?
1555593	1559536	Some DS stuff, because I was finishing up the trial stuff.
1561217	1571906	So I played Peggle DS, lots of Peggle Knights on there, and a little bit of Zelda Spirit Tracks, just going through the next dungeon where I got some sort of windmill-looking thing.
1572246	1573627	Which, by the way, that game just...
1575028	1581511	I don't know what it is with some of these Zelda games, but it pretty much seems like the whole dungeon is just a tutorial of how to figure out how to use this item.
1581731	1582631	I get it.
1582731	1584252	I figured out how to use the item.
1584292	1588073	You don't need to... Hey, look, you can do this puzzle with this.
1588173	1590034	Oh, hey, look, you can do this now.
1590734	1594315	Just give me the features that the item has and I'll figure the rest out.
1594355	1595776	You don't need to walk me through.
1595796	1598577	I don't need to hold my hand to figure out how to use this.
1599037	1603339	Oh, and fuck you, Nintendo, for making me blow on my DS to use this stupid item.
1604019	1605179	Some people don't want to do that.
1605919	1609560	Just because you have a microphone on there doesn't mean you have to use it for stupid shit like that.
1610600	1612201	Are you still on that jury duty thing?
1612401	1613261	Or did that finally finish?
1614981	1622702	Because I'm imagining you at the courthouse playing your DS just like very slyly having to go and your DS.
1623323	1625203	I did it in the hallway, but yeah.
1625563	1627083	No, we finished up with that.
1629404	1630924	The trial went on for eight days.
1630944	1631464	Oh, God.
1631604	1632825	All right, quickly, what was the trial?
1632845	1633786	Because we're all dying to know.
1634006	1634426	What was it?
1634446	1635847	Give us all the details.
1636047	1637188	The trial went on for eight days.
1637248	1643973	It was this woman by the name of Julie Mayo who had gotten fired from a printing company in Sacramento here.
1643993	1645214	Which company?
1645234	1646194	Because they're probably hiring.
1646895	1648136	Pacific Standard Press.
1648716	1649337	Okay, I'm writing it down.
1650419	1654443	No, they seem like a nice company because they did have pretty much everybody on the witness stand.
1655624	1663892	So anyways, she got fired from there, but she's claiming that she got fired because of racial discrimination, because she was Caucasian.
1664432	1667375	She says that this woman by the name of Grace Schneider...
1668516	1671258	I love that Loki's putting all the details out there.
1671298	1672138	It's all public record now.
1672158	1673939	I know it's all public record, but it's funny.
1673979	1680983	So this woman, Grace Schneider, who is a Filipino, supposedly called her a white bitch or a fucking white bitch.
1681743	1685605	And because of that, you know, American lithographers... I called my sister that once.
1685766	1686486	What's the difference?
1686506	1695431	Pacific Standard Press, or in this case, the company was at the time known as American Lithographers, basically was supposedly covering it up and all this stuff.
1696611	1704893	Anyways, oh, and because of that, she has suffered, you know, severe depression, agoraphobia, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
1705973	1717275	Which, by the way, when they were asking you the questions, you know, okay, before they were picking the jury and stuff like that, I was just like, because you can kind of get the impression of what this person is claiming is the problem.
1717295	1719296	And you're just like, what?
1719616	1720596	No, that doesn't make any sense.
1721196	1724920	So, throughout the whole trial, the plaintiff lawyer was completely retarded.
1724960	1728123	Reminded me of Andy Griffith in the Matlock role.
1729825	1735511	I'm just guessing from the way you're describing this, this was a not guilty, or what would you call it?
1735571	1736492	Not liable, right?
1736832	1737993	The person who sued lost?
1738414	1739314	I'm just guessing.
1739334	1739655	Yeah.
1744297	1750759	Yes, so basically, this whole trial went on for eight days, and the plaintiff lawyer, he's just completely idiotic.
1750819	1752760	He's the worst lawyer I've ever seen.
1754160	1757702	After they finished the plaintiff's case, the defense only had to say was...
1758402	1759003	Thanks for watching!
1783977	1789639	We went over the questions twice, just to be sure.
1789719	1794099	But most of them were 12-0 in the favor of the defense.
1795840	1796820	It was sad.
1796920	1798880	We were just like, my God.
1798900	1800441	Because it was down to like 3 o'clock.
1800861	1806542	And if we didn't get deliberations done by like 4.15, we would have to come back on Friday.
1806722	1807842	We're like, fuck that.
1807922	1809082	We are getting this done now.
1809563	1810243	Was she pissed?
1812103	1817426	She looked frustrated, annoyed, but she was crying and stuff throughout the whole trial.
1818046	1820047	Didn't do that one at the end.
1820647	1827310	Oh, but her lawyer, which wasn't really her lawyer, it was his partner came in when we had the verdict read.
1828030	1829751	He looked pissed.
1830371	1834813	And he did, of course, pull the jury, which we figured they would because we deliberated in ten minutes.
1835774	1838195	I was like, whatever, I'm fucking done today.
1839416	1840076	You get nothing.
1840676	1843738	I'm surprised you weren't playing Phoenix Wright in the hallway.
1843778	1845699	I thought that would be ironic, but yeah.
1845860	1859488	No, she... It ended up that she was just a horrible worker and she got fired for very obvious reasons and it made no sense that she was claiming racial discrimination since the people that fired her were white.
1859808	1863651	She was replaced by a white woman and the majority of the company is white.
1865498	1866519	I'm sorry I asked.
1866739	1868061	I'm glad.
1868501	1869122	I had to know.
1869262	1870803	Guys, I had to know after two weeks ago.
1870963	1880853	Oh, and by the way, I did some research after the trial and she had also sued other people and she has an internet business which is doing a lot better than she claimed that it was doing.
1881613	1882574	So she's a lying bitch.
1883635	1886178	Allegedly.
1886858	1887899	We don't need a trial for that.
1888820	1890401	I just totally hate people that do that crap.
1890861	1898726	The plaintiff lawyer kept calling his client Mr. instead of Mrs. He kept screwing up the gender of different people on the witness stand or whatever.
1898766	1899627	Kept repeating stuff.
1899907	1901748	He would fuck up their names all the time.
1902129	1906732	And he misspelled examining on his little board in his closing arguments.
1907172	1907772	It was awesome.
1908273	1908853	Video games.
1908913	1909874	Back to video games.
1909914	1910214	Sorry.
1910434	1911395	Real life Phoenix Wright.
1911855	1913756	Drew, hey, you gonna try and follow that up?
1913796	1914837	What have you been playing this week?
1916598	1917899	I cannot top that.
1917939	1918439	I played a little
1918919	1922160	Played a little bit of WoW and a lot of Left 4 Dead 2.
1923140	1929301	Towards the end of the Steam sale, a friend of mine gifted me Grand Theft Auto 4 for PC, so I was playing some of that.
1929621	1931082	It's okay.
1931402	1933842	It actually made my system work for once.
1937083	1938883	But I've just been playing a whole lot of Left 4 Dead 2.
1939483	1940544	I really enjoy Ellis.
1940564	1941384	He's a motormouth.
1942684	1947445	And aside from that, my gaming week has been pretty boring.
1948982	1950963	DarkSakura.com
1966661	1967001	A lot.
1967642	1971805	I managed to restrain myself since my funding's a little tight.
1972445	1973366	I think I spent about $30, $35.
1974247	1978690	I bought Flat Out Ultimate Carnage for $2.
1978970	1979290	Nice.
1980311	1983433	Left 4 Dead 2 for $20, and I was pissed when they dropped it down to $10.
1983474	1986236	It's like playing the stock market.
1986556	1987857	Someone gifted me GTA 4.
1988097	1988938	Oh, that's nice.
1989338	1995683	And I got one other game, and I can't remember what it was, but I think I spent in total about $30.
1995723	1995863	Nice.
1996516	1997496	This game is great.
1997536	1998497	It's called Blood Bowl.
1999657	2002398	Yeah, it's Warhammer Sports.
2002598	2003778	I know, I think that's hilarious.
2004339	2006119	It is hilarious, every single bit of it.
2006539	2009540	Let me transition into my week a little bit, and I'll talk about what I bought on Steam.
2009820	2016562	I was gifted the Civ IV Complete Collection for my birthday, because that went down to about, I think it was like $10 at one point, so I got that as a gift, which was awesome.
2016863	2020124	So I did play a little bit of Civ IV this week, got back into Crackalization.
2020784	2022064	I tried, I tried.
2022224	2024145	Oh, it's fun, but it's a lot...
2025326	2051586	I honestly think the console versions of Civilization as much as they're hated by some of the core Civ community I think they are really good entry level games so like if you've never played a Civ game before maybe start with the console ones but I don't think the PC ones are that inaccessible they've got good tutorials but I played that a little bit Team Fortress 2 I finally bought I played that a little bit but man I am horrible at first person shooters I was sucking in the tutorial levels it's sad
2051926	2058710	Rob, if it was hard before, it's a clusterfuck now that they've pushed the engineer update.
2059150	2059610	Oh no.
2060231	2065654	Now engineers can pick up, carry, and set down their sentries.
2066775	2073839	So on the server I was testing it on, I played for two hours, nine engineers on ten-man teams.
2073859	2074279	Oh wow.
2074679	2076060	And the tenth man was a spy.
2076500	2077741	Jamie and I still have to have our match.
2077901	2078982	We didn't get around to that.
2079322	2079843	No, we didn't.
2079903	2080823	I'm still learning how to play.
2081044	2083345	See, I would probably play a team of all scouts.
2083546	2086568	It'll have to be after the hand thing.
2086748	2088589	Just because they have the best taunts.
2089090	2092212	Well, here's one thing that kind of, and maybe you know this, Drew.
2092593	2094254	Granted, I didn't spend a lot of time with it.
2094714	2096936	I couldn't get my 360 controller to work right with it.
2097196	2099197	Did I do something wrong or does it not really work?
2100097	2102918	I've actually never tried using a controller for Team Fortress 2.
2103199	2109921	In fact, I am very against the idea of using a console controller to play a first-person shooter.
2110362	2110742	Why?
2110922	2111742	There's nothing wrong with it.
2111882	2113303	It's personal taste.
2113343	2114823	I find a mouse to be more precise.
2115023	2116764	Some of those great internet debates.
2116784	2123267	Keep in mind, when we were all playing Final Fantasy XI, I was playing with a controller.
2124192	2126074	Well, that game was designed for the PS2, really.
2126474	2133321	But I could, you know, break out all my macros like that and people were like, why are you using a controller?
2134182	2141509	I also want to say I bought this real quick because it's awesome, even though I didn't get a chance to touch it this week, but I bought the complete XCOM collection for like five bucks.
2142691	2144332	I just wanted the old school XCOM games.
2144452	2147273	I never had the chance to play through those, but I heard they were good.
2147353	2147793	They're good.
2148033	2149654	So I'm going to play them later.
2149674	2150254	Space Harrier.
2150935	2151255	Let's see.
2151635	2152635	Other games I played this week.
2152675	2154736	Of course, I played Warcraft because I always fucking play Warcraft.
2154756	2155637	But I want to talk about some other games.
2156097	2157497	LOL Random Game of the Week.
2157817	2160539	I played Star Wars The Force Unleashed.
2161019	2162399	That game's only about, what, two and a half years old?
2162459	2163500	I finally got around to playing it this week.
2164162	2166804	That was the other game I bought.
2166844	2168365	Star Wars Empire at War.
2168526	2170867	Oh, well, I'm glad I could help jog your memory there.
2171428	2184018	Oh, I played The Force Unleashed, which you might remember the talk about this one because this was the one where Soul Calibur IV had Yoda, Darth Vader, and then The Apprentice, who's also known as Starkiller.
2184498	2186460	And this was his game, was The Force Unleashed.
2186500	2189903	Although you start the game playing as Vader, which I thought was kind of cool.
2189943	2190283	I was like...
2190663	2192085	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2211604	2212084	Thanks for watching!
2230450	2234433	The mechanic seemed to be a lot of fling things around.
2234493	2235954	Fling this and fling that.
2236754	2238075	It's also a really hard game.
2239817	2242578	I died within five minutes when I first started.
2242598	2245480	I was like, whoa, I gotta approach this a little differently than I've been doing.
2245640	2248182	LucasArts games have never been particularly forgiving.
2248683	2250904	But I would not say it's a bad game by any means.
2250944	2252405	It was neat.
2252745	2255007	I think especially if I was more of a... See, I'm more of a Trekkie.
2255167	2258869	Hate me if you want, but... I think if I was more into Star Wars, I would probably...
2259830	2260611	Really like this.
2261051	2262892	And I liked it enough as it is.
2262952	2263372	It was cool.
2263672	2267775	I mean, granted, it's a little old now, but you can probably get it cheap if you're a budget gamer.
2268475	2270776	Oh, I can't get it cheaper than it was at the time.
2270796	2270997	It was $7.50.
2275479	2277281	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2297105	2303870	Puzzle Quest 2 is sort of the LOL Galactrix didn't really happen kind of game because remember there actually was already a Puzzle Quest 2.
2304891	2309634	This is the Puzzle Quest 2 back to swords and magic and sorcery type of game.
2310115	2317100	But I noticed right off the bat, and this actually threw me for a loop, they kind of did away with the world map in the first game.
2317220	2319281	And now it's more of this isometric...
2320242	2320842	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2342978	2343839	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2359138	2359699	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2378375	2380016	Thanks for watching!
2403943	2418716	and as you level up Iron Knuckles you can either use a sword or a shield depending on your class or possibly a poison if you're an assassin I think sorcerers do like magic or mana pool regeneration things
2419136	2421418	It's sort of like a wild card depending on your class.
2421538	2422759	I kind of like that mechanic.
2422819	2424700	It really adds an interesting twist to it.
2425140	2430204	So that's really the biggest change between Puzzle Quest 1 and 2 in regards to how the game works.
2430664	2437128	But there's another thing you should also know is that now the size of the board will change depending on what you're battling.
2437168	2440731	So sometimes you battle these big bears and there's a huge board to go with it.
2441131	2441891	And I kind of like that.
2441911	2443873	And sometimes some squares will remain inaccessible.
2444513	2448496	There are still some mini games like picking locks, bashing down doors.
2449616	2454740	And they are all pretty much give or take the variations on Bejeweled you've seen before.
2455160	2469270	Like, does anyone remember an Xbox Live game, and I think this is on Facebook and stuff too, called Jewel Quest, where the goal wasn't to match three in a row, but was to make every square on the board gold by matching a piece on that square?
2469370	2470110	I think so.
2470290	2474313	Okay, that is the Search the Room minigame in Puzzle Quest 2.
2474773	2478155	So lots of little variations that you're kind of used to seeing.
2479496	2507005	I thought it was neat I enjoyed it and I played a hell of a lot of it so I think that says something about it and you know for 15 bucks on Xbox Live it's a pretty good deal 30 bucks on the DS so not sure what that's all about well I do it costs more to make a cartridge than it does to push something digitally but I could see where the allure of being able to take it with you would be but I'll probably try to play a little bit more on Xbox Live I need to because you know how well I'm doing on my Beat 3 games goal
2508506	2509166	I've beaten zero.
2510047	2510947	So maybe I'll beat this one.
2510967	2511267	We'll see.
2512828	2514649	Alright, you guys ready to get into some gaming news?
2515870	2516711	I guess.
2516731	2517091	Finally.
2517111	2518772	Let me do some housekeeping real quick here.
2520593	2521954	Join us on our Facebook, please.

2537464	2539006	I'm not even going to plug Myspace anymore.
2539546	2540648	Is anyone here using Myspace?
2540688	2540948	Anyone?
2541149	2542911	Anyone in chat using Myspace?
2543051	2544173	My butt.
2545054	2545775	I should just delete it.
2547489	2548049	Thank you very much.
2569898	2579143	If you browse GameFAQs, I'll try to leave notes about Orange Lounge Radio's next shows up on the current events message board.
2579623	2580324	Oh, that's awesome.
2580464	2580864	Thank you.
2581264	2583766	I've seen people put it in their signatures and stuff too, and I love that.
2583806	2585707	That's so generous of folks to do.
2586107	2586607	I love the wiki
2603587	2605228	Have people actually updated stuff?
2606128	2610489	There's a few dedicated, like Dark Tetsuya, AJ Mix, and I think I've seen a few others.
2610509	2614771	They're very dedicated, and they're very good generals of the oil army for keeping that stuff up to date.
2615311	2617071	But it could use more.
2617811	2620012	So I'm hoping people... Crack on it.
2620112	2620652	Get to it.
2622273	2623153	We need other contributors.
2623193	2623433	All right.
2624113	2625534	And yes, a comment in our chat room.
2625594	2627474	Actdeft says, nobody uses MySpace anymore.
2627514	2628255	Yeah, that's how I felt.
2628655	2629075	That's how I felt.
2629934	2633676	Let's get into some actual gaming news here and talk about what's going on in the gaming world.
2634016	2634516	Loki, what's up?
2635216	2637577	Well, this is kind of interesting.
2637677	2645340	They're going to be kind of changing up how people look at Xbox Live Arcade.
2646240	2653863	And honestly, it reminds me a little bit of the PlayStation Network, kind of, what they're doing.
2654783	2656483	It's called Destination Arcade.
2656963	2661084	It's kind of a visual browser of the Xbox Live Arcade stuff.
2661544	2670266	They have a bunch of different things on there, including you can check out the new arrivals, check out some of the new stuff, actually just browse through titles.
2670806	2676787	They're going to have recommendations based off of different purchases.
2678128	2679028	Lots of neat stuff.
2680868	2684170	Also, kind of a way to maybe see some better screenshots.
2684430	2690733	Now, they have this all kind of now, but they're making, I guess, a little bit easier to view.
2691073	2697516	Because I know with a lot of the titles that are out there now, it may make it a little difficult to browse for what you're looking for.
2697536	2700037	Especially, God, if you were looking for indie games.
2700978	2703939	That's really difficult to find now.
2704739	2705940	Hope this includes indie games.
2706340	2710725	Yeah, I was going to say, have we heard anything about the indie games and the incorporation of that?
2710905	2711026	No.
2713496	2713836	We'll see.
2714437	2722604	Because, I mean, if they're doing this with Xbox Live Arcade and the indie games are almost like Xbox Live Arcade stuff, I don't see why they couldn't include it.
2723124	2734294	Now, we haven't heard a lot about this next patch in general, and usually there's a lot of fanfare about what's coming up in these big, you know, it used to be biannual, now it's just, what, annual?
2734414	2735615	I don't even know how often they do it.
2735655	2737096	Now it's kind of like whatever they feel like, isn't it?
2737116	2737957	It's still biannual.
2737997	2740319	In fact, this dashboard update...
2742040	2743500	Well, not even that.
2743580	2744821	That was just another update.
2745641	2750162	This update, actually, with the visual browser is supposed to be happening, I believe, this month.
2750502	2750822	Oh, wow.
2751422	2754223	So, any week now.
2754523	2755963	I mean, it should be coming soon.
2758543	2761404	Have they said anything else about what else we might see implemented?
2761444	2766165	I mean, my assumption is that all this Kinect stuff is probably the big thing that's going to be in it, but...
2766962	2771787	I don't think the Kinect stuff is actually going to be in there until it actually comes out on the 4th.
2771807	2780215	If anything, I would guess that we're going to get that patch pushed to us probably either, I'd say the end of October is when we're going to see the Kinect patch.
2780235	2781916	That'll kind of unlock all that stuff.
2785480	2787261	But yeah, I mean, it looks interesting.
2787441	2791145	I guess there'll be, I don't know, we'll have to check out when it actually comes out.
2793117	2801231	it's nice I guess but honestly I've never had a problem finding stuff on Xbox Live Arcade but I can see where you might if you don't know what you're looking for
2802123	2812227	Actdeft seems to say in our chatroom here, I'm just kind of summarizing what he's saying, that this whole new interface seems a lot like the Rock Band store, the Guitar Hero store, and the Music Shop.
2812927	2816769	I haven't used those in a while because I haven't really been buying download content.
2816849	2818089	I've used the Rock Band one before.
2818209	2819770	I haven't used it in a while either, but I've used it before.
2819790	2824331	Well, I haven't used it, let's say, in Xbox Live.
2824491	2826532	I've used it in Rock Band 2.
2827753	2829373	It's a lot different on Xbox Live.
2829433	2831014	It's like this whole standalone app.
2831914	2849629	and you can listen to clips and everything without having to actually launch the game which is interesting but what's also weird is that it shows up in your played games history I think it's really just a mini game in a way, I don't know if that makes sense but I think that's how Xbox kind of recognizes it as a miniature free game if you will
2852131	2855035	Actdeft also hits us with another good comment here.
2855055	2860842	Chat.OrangeLauncher.com says, I think they won't add the indie games since they aren't available outside the US and other countries.
2861323	2862744	So it'll only be for arcade stuff.
2862764	2864226	I don't understand why they wouldn't be out.
2864647	2866188	They really should open it up to everybody.
2866849	2870614	One of the other features that you can do in this is you can actually recommend games for friends.
2872249	2879955	Wait, I thought, now I realize Actdeft is in Mexico, so maybe that is true about Mexico, but I thought Japan had the indie games too, because aren't there some indie games being made over there?
2880136	2886541	I know there's some Japanese indie games that are on the service already, so I assumed that they were in those regions as well.
2886701	2890465	So it's just kind of outside of the big regions where you're not seeing this.
2890565	2894008	And when I say big regions, I say Japan, US, UK, basically.
2894648	2895029	I guess.
2895269	2895389	Hmm.
2896593	2902938	Alright, well, we'll see what happens with this store when it launches or whenever we get a patch date.
2903178	2903639	So we'll see.
2903999	2907462	Moving on, did you know that there's a game called Justin Bieber Revenge?
2908382	2908743	What?
2909063	2913727	Yes, there's actually a video game called Justin Bieber Revenge.
2913847	2918430	And I imagine that Justin Bieber just takes out an Uzi into that crowd of screaming fangirls.
2918791	2921953	I found a game going through apps real quick that I have to share off topic.
2922294	2923895	Vuvuzela vs. Zombies.
2926681	2928922	I want to see Justin Bieber vs. Vuvuzela.
2929823	2938007	The other day when I was driving home, I saw a guy with one of those blowing it out the window of his car.
2938027	2940409	I was like, what the hell?
2940689	2942270	I know, it's all the rage, I guess.
2943550	2951575	Destined to become, you know, when they have the I Love the 2010, you know, many years from now, snarky B-list comics commenting on the Vuvuzela.
2952526	2954868	Take that Vuvuzela and shove it up your butt.
2955929	2958191	It just sounds like... It'd probably improve the sound.
2958452	2958992	God.
2959733	2960734	Alright, here it is.
2961154	2962275	Justin Bieber Revenge.
2962355	2965859	Look, what it really is... You heard of Tap Tap Revenge on the App Store, right?
2966359	2968501	Well, Tap Tap Revenge has all these spin-off games.
2968902	2975488	Lady Gaga Revenge, Dave Matthews Band Revenge, and... Nickelback Revenge.
2977492	2994899	I think that should go the other way around Nickelback should not be having revenge on me I should be having revenge on Nickelback for being on the radio or Justin Bieber here's the thing I don't listen to radio stations that play Justin Bieber but unfortunately Nickelback is crap the only time I've ever seen him was when I was waiting for more comedy in Saturday Night Live
2995619	2996220	Disney.com.
3021638	3024439	That's right, Disney bought Tapulous.
3024859	3033503	So now they are a part of Disney Interactive Media, which is interesting because we've seen kind of more and more from Disney Interactive Media come out in the past couple years.
3033543	3036164	We have Split Second, Tron is coming out soon.
3036504	3038465	It's a little more than just the kiddie games.
3040526	3040966	Predator.
3042086	3042927	Turok was Disney Tap Tap Revenge
3063098	3064239	It's... whatever.
3064299	3071322	It's just an... I've played the game and it's like one of those things that's... Oh yeah, and Black Wolf points out a good one that's important.
3071402	3075024	Epic Mickey, which is a very different direction for the Disney franchise, is also there.
3075604	3076904	Not really when you look at it.
3077084	3077345	I mean...
3078485	3086212	It would have been if they had kept it to its original wonder awesomeness with all the really twisted shit.
3086633	3091497	But in the end, it's going to be as twisted as the Alice in Wonderland movie was.
3091517	3094259	There's definitely a dark side to it.
3094720	3095500	Dark-sided?
3096121	3096942	I got a little bit of that.
3097142	3097763	Let me put it this way.
3098443	3103548	The equivalent of what Epic Mickey should have been and what it's going to be, it would be like...
3104148	3113855	If the original Epic Mickey is like American McGee's Alice versus what it's going to be is like Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland.
3113915	3115336	Kill the mouse, take his house.
3115376	3116457	Kill the mouse, take his house.
3117978	3118199	What?
3119820	3122442	That's how it was supposed to be with Oswald going nuts.
3122962	3123262	I see.
3123663	3123983	I get it.
3125764	3127585	Oswald's in the thing, right?
3127645	3130347	Yeah, but he's not as nuts, apparently.
3130888	3132269	It would have been, you know...
3133633	3134534	That's what they need to do.
3134654	3136915	American McGee's, you know, Epic Mickey.
3138236	3141518	AJ Mix in our chatroom actually says the game used to be called Tap Tap Revolution.
3141698	3143680	Going back to this whole Tap Tap Revenge thing.
3143960	3149023	By the way, just kind of like a little aside, apparently like Step Mania is now on the iPhone.
3149224	3149744	Did you hear that?
3149804	3150925	Yep, I did.
3150965	3152326	But it's Tap Mania.
3152986	3162733	But like, what's really weird about it, like, and I haven't played with the app, so I don't fully understand how this works, but apparently you can load MP3s into the app.
3164093	3191831	but not via the iTunes interface which I can't believe Apple approved that like there seems to be something there like and again I haven't had hands on with it but apparently you can load your own mp3s and step files into this app and that doesn't seem to be something that usually Apple's very supportive of unless it's they're just claiming to do that via like the smzips format or something like that where you can just zip up the whole file and just throw it in there
3192891	3195432	with the steps and the backgrounds and all that fun stuff.
3195692	3196592	Wow.
3196652	3199553	Blackwolf is saying that it was a homebrew app back in the day.
3199653	3200934	It even worked with your own music.
3200994	3202754	People submitted note charts and it was awesome.
3203074	3205095	And then the app store came out and they went all legit.
3205115	3206015	So I guess that's a history.
3206055	3212957	Well, now you've got Tapmania is, I guess, the rogue renegade tap-tap revenge or whatever.
3214608	3215709	But does anybody care?
3215909	3222453	All I can say is that apps in general effing suck on my 3G now, ever since iOS 4 came out.
3222473	3225514	I thought iOS 4 was going to be awesome, but it really slowed down the 3G.
3226355	3228036	Mine's been pretty awesome.
3228456	3229597	But you have a 3GS.
3230057	3234860	That's always been my impression of the iPhone, is it was supposed to be awesome, but it just sucked.
3235599	3236940	Alright, can we move on?
3237380	3239862	Or Apple, hey, you can even take that back to Apple.
3240082	3243004	Disney bought Tap Revenge, people.
3243104	3245045	We'll see what comes of that in the future.
3245406	3247927	I'm just waiting for Jonas Brothers Revenge.
3248007	3248508	Can't wait.
3249388	3249809	Can't wait.
3249989	3251270	Miley Cyrus Revenge.
3251710	3252230	Goody, goody.
3252510	3253631	What do you got for us, DarkSakra?
3254332	3263078	Well, this is something that has been on the mind of many a World of Warcraft and StarCraft II player about the real ID.
3263258	3263758	Here we go!
3264038	3264318	Yep.
3266384	3269849	and this news comes from Geek Life, plug, plug.
3270891	3271973	That's Geek Dash Life.
3272033	3272634	That's important.
3272954	3275297	What's Geek Life without the dash take you to?
3275598	3275938	Porn?
3276539	3277060	I don't know.
3277180	3277661	I'm gonna look.
3278662	3279724	But the dash is important.
3282573	3296196	Anyway, there's a certain thing that happened after one of the forum moderators revealed his name and someone managed to basically put out all of his personal information out in plain view.
3296996	3299077	So they said, yeah, we're not going to do that on the forum.
3299237	3299557	Sorry.
3300917	3301177	Oops.
3301517	3301877	Our bad.
3302397	3304618	It's fine for everyone else, just not us.
3306687	3308890	I use the official Star Trek Online ones.
3319383	3321023	Tech support, but it's World of Warcraft.
3321083	3322003	It should never be broken.
3322144	3327124	I think Geek Life is like a podcast or something, but their site's kind of ugly.
3327164	3327885	I mean, no offense.
3327925	3329245	It's just very disorganized.
3329345	3330845	Anyway, but Geek-Life is great.
3331005	3331505	Yes, it is.
3331565	3332325	It's fantastic.
3332445	3335346	And I've started doing a blog on there now called Tales from the Vault.
3335526	3335626	Okay.
3335646	3337206	Which will be mirrored on Orange Island.
3337266	3339867	I want to rant, so let's get through this story because I'm ready to rant.
3339887	3342367	Well, I said everything while you were looking up the other sites.
3342427	3343267	Well, I was curious.
3343868	3346208	Believe me, I have been closely following...
3346548	3348149	What's been going on with this whole real ID thing?
3348169	3349390	They're going to find you, Rob.
3349410	3350051	Just have it, Rob.
3350071	3350431	They will.
3350631	3351212	Here's the thing.
3351512	3352733	The forums, okay?
3353353	3354394	Obviously it was a bad idea.
3354774	3358717	But yes, you do have to post there for tech support sometimes and if you want to contact the GMs.
3358737	3359298	You know why?
3359578	3365583	Because when you call Blizzard, you're going to wait on hold for 45 minutes if you can even get through at all.
3366243	3368024	Trolls don't care and it will give them more ammo.
3391881	3397108	You're going to get rid of 7 eighths of your posters, at least, by doing that.
3397128	3398731	So it's like, why do you want to shoot yourself in the foot?
3399091	3401014	Maybe you want to do advertising on your forums someday?
3401034	3402676	I've got it.
3402696	3403778	They still do advertising.
3403878	3404338	Here's the thing.
3405180	3408284	It cuts down on bandwidth cost if you lose most of your forum users.
3409502	3410263	That's the genius.
3410303	3410843	That's the genius.
3410863	3411664	They're fucking Blizzard.
3411784	3413525	They don't need to cut back on that.
3413625	3417688	Meanwhile, they're running a computer game with 11 million people subscribing.
3417988	3422011	And soon, a huge game that's going to just turn Korea upside down.
3422411	3424193	And then we're going to have Diablo 3.
3424253	3426114	Lord knows what's going to happen with that.
3426194	3428215	And isn't Blizzard... They have the bandwidth, Drew.
3428256	3431918	Isn't Blizzard a company that they can just make up a mount and just sell it for $25?
3432018	3433940	And people are like, oh, we got a new mount!
3434020	3435301	Sparkle ponies!
3435661	3436521	It's pretty sick.
3436622	3438383	Dude, now, if they had sparkle ponies...
3438703	3439824	They do have Sparkle Ponies!
3440064	3440745	No, I still didn't play.
3440965	3443627	Okay, well I was going to say, that was a couple months ago.
3443667	3445029	Hey, we were promised a pony.
3445049	3445589	$25 Sparkle Ponies.
3445889	3446370	Alright, look.
3446930	3447471	Here's the thing.
3447911	3449372	Yes, the forum thing was dumb.
3449973	3454056	There were people that were like, yay, no more trolls on the forum, yay, yay.
3454117	3457980	But it's kind of like, okay, well now you can just sit there and talk to yourself, I suppose.
3458861	3461503	I don't think the official forums are that bad.
3462043	3464285	I mean, yes, there's trolls, but...
3465802	3467843	You know, where on the internet aren't there trolls?
3467903	3471044	There's trolls in the reviews for Orange Lounge Radio on iTunes.
3471264	3472885	There's trolls everywhere, you guys.
3473145	3485090	I don't understand how it's going to cut down on trolls because say I have my real name up there, you know, whether my name is like, you know, Troll Guy or, you know, Matt, I can still troll people.
3485211	3487632	Well, look, they're not doing it anymore.
3487672	3487852	Yeah.
3488812	3492897	Try hanging out on the roleplay forums and tell me there aren't more trolls.
3493438	3495761	Now how in the F are you supposed to roleplay with your real name?
3496081	3496542	Come on.
3497183	3498945	I know, that's the death knell.
3498965	3499966	That was dumb.
3500006	3501148	That was going to be massive.
3501528	3504432	They already had a replacement site set up for everyone to go to.
3504652	3505033	Alright, look.
3506254	3511960	We could talk about the Blizzard employee who got cyber-stalked when he put his real name out there and they spilled all the data.
3512300	3514082	Bottom line is they didn't go through with it.
3514182	3514803	Yay.
3514943	3517345	Makes about as much sense as a whole LifeLock dude.
3517445	3519968	So I'm not going to go back into the pros and cons of the forums.
3520028	3524692	But this is what I really want to make sure people understand because there's a lot of misinformation out there.
3525273	3526134	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3554233	3560757	This whole Blizzard already did a dumb thing and they're just making it even dumber is the only thing that got pulled back.
3560977	3566700	Everything I said in my rant two weeks ago, you know what changed from all that stuff I ranted about two weeks ago?
3567621	3571083	About the whole friends of friends, about the whole your last name is in the game.
3571343	3573564	You know how much of that changed with this announcement?
3574225	3574765	Nothing.
3575466	3575946	Nothing.
3577216	3587762	The only thing that that CEO mentioned was that they're not going to implement something they thought about implementing when almost 50,000 people replied on that thread before it got officially released.
3587942	3598888	I have seen administrator posts on the forums and such saying that they're looking to close some security holes in the Real ID system so you wouldn't be able to see friends of friends and such.
3598948	3599729	They're working on it.
3600209	3611191	But it is testament to the fact that if you complain loud enough, often enough, and in great enough number, you can generally rattle the company into doing what's right.
3611752	3613612	And yet, Bobby Kotick still has a job.
3614192	3619333	Now, Bobby Blackwolf thinks I'm blaming him because he was one of those people that posted about all that.
3619753	3621294	No, Bobby, I'm not picking on you.
3621354	3622094	I'm picking on...
3622774	3624675	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3649235	3651056	I know there's some people that don't want to hear all this reality stuff.
3651076	3654879	Actually, that would be awesome for stalking celebrities in the game.
3655759	3656840	Well, they wouldn't post on the forums.
3656860	3657861	But here, here's the thing.
3658201	3659622	But aren't their names going to be in the game?
3659722	3659942	Do you?
3660923	3661423	No, it's gone.
3661523	3661923	That's gone.
3662604	3663224	Here's the thing, though.
3663304	3664285	Here's the thing that's important.
3666107	3666967	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3692839	3705809	So if there is a rogue add-on out there that wants to insert, and already there's been these false reports and false photoshops and things of this line of code being in popular mods such as Gearscore and Deadly Boss mods.
3705849	3710392	Luckily those are all bullshit, but what is not bullshit is the fact that the code is out there and it works.
3710632	3711893	Rob, the hole's been closed.
3711913	3712854	It was hot fixed on the 10th.
3713496	3715458	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3734495	3742600	Exactly, and what's to say there won't be a three-line code or a five-line code that is soon to come out that's also going to exploit this information?
3742640	3749084	My point is, Blizzard has been selling this thing as opt-in and opt-in, and a lot of people that are advocating for this as opt-in.
3749405	3755449	Well, this little exploit that happened this week, patched or not, showed that the system is not opt-in.
3756229	3756549	DarkSakura.com
3773567	3776810	You're opting in because they've opted you in to this wonderful feature.
3776850	3780192	Well, now I realize Battle.net wants to get in bed with Blizzard.
3781233	3782013	They are in bed with Blizzard.
3782234	3785076	Battle.net wants to get in bed with Facebook so, so badly.
3785476	3786157	But here's the thing.
3786637	3789599	That's what Facebook is getting a lot of shit over right now.
3790019	3794483	And there's that movie coming out about Facebook, and they really don't make them look like nice people.
3794523	3795884	Have you seen the trailers for the –
3796104	3797325	I think it looks awesome.
3811172	3816156	There will be another website, and everyone will migrate to that website.
3816196	3821159	Let me quickly finish my thought here, and that is that it's not an opt-in program, it's an opt-out program.
3821860	3827024	And if you are believing that it's opt-in, this whole thing that happened this week should tell you different.
3827524	3829345	and you might be thinking, I don't play WoW.
3829485	3830285	I don't give a shit.
3830665	3834307	Well, if you're going to play StarCraft 2 or Diablo 3, this will apply to you.
3834847	3838949	And let's not forget, how many MMOs have knocked off WoW at this point?
3839269	3843871	How many video games in general have knocked off Diablo and StarCraft and Blizzard at this point?
3843911	3844891	Dangerous precedent.
3845211	3847332	Yes, it is a highly dangerous precedent.
3847592	3848953	So you may not care now...
3849753	3852457	But ask yourself, if this were your favorite game, would you care?
3852678	3857926	They might change the definition of opt-in to be, you opt-in by playing our game.
3859448	3863575	You know what, I have to say this, that if they did it on Star Trek Online, I would quit.
3865183	3865483	I would.
3865903	3867544	And it's a dangerous precedent that they're setting.
3867904	3869444	So let's hope they do the right thing.
3869484	3876286	Let's hope they allow you to mask your last name, allow you to have the handle, at least hide that friends of friends stuff.
3877246	3882147	I wish my real name was on Grand Theft Auto because I'd fucking love everybody to know that I'm kicking their ass.
3883508	3885628	By the way, I'm ranked 58 now in the world.
3885848	3887569	And I love this comment from Toa Gak in chat.
3887649	3889329	Real ideas is secure as the Wii.
3889649	3889969	Correct.
3889989	3891990	And that's your real name out there, folks.
3892030	3892650	Your real name.
3893650	3900073	Because when I signed up for WoW four years ago, I assumed that the name I was giving them was for billing and information purposes.
3900133	3900654	I had no idea.
3900674	3901894	That's what the agreement said.
3901994	3903955	No idea that this was going to be the result of it.
3903995	3904956	And now I can't change my name.
3905716	3909798	I would have signed up with my internet name and my internet trail Rob Roberts if I knew that in the beginning.
3910058	3915801	This is what actually I'd like to see happen is I'd really like to see, you know, an organized boycott.
3917873	3918614	Hit them where it hurts.
3941417	3944440	I wouldn't put it past them that they did it on purpose knowing that would happen
3964804	3966086	I love their game.
3966686	3969749	I'd prefer it to remain a game.
3969830	3971171	It's so hard, Jamie.
3971331	3972132	It's not a social network.
3972152	3976877	I really love that game and I have so many friends that I interact with and play it with.
3976897	3977938	They'll still be your friends.
3978138	3981262	I know, but it's just... I can't explain it.
3982459	3983360	I know what you mean.
3983540	3985121	Trust me, I played Ragnarok for how long?
3985161	3985482	Yeah, yeah.
3985842	3989385	And I quit Ragnarok when they started doing shit I didn't agree with.
3989445	3995471	And I played in the beta, like the first... Actually, I played part from the alpha.
3996252	3998134	So that's how long I've been with Ragnarok online.
3998154	4000356	And when they started doing crap I didn't like, I quit.
4001176	4002896	I'm not opposed to quitting.
4003076	4004477	In fact, ask Alan.
4005017	4007377	I really kind of had a long chat with him about it.
4007417	4009838	And I said, I was paid through the 14th.
4010258	4013458	So I said, I'm going to wait and see if Blizzard changes their mind by the 14th.
4013838	4016079	And sure enough, the scale back happened.
4016119	4018199	And I said, okay, well, now they're moving in the right direction.
4018259	4021180	So I'm kind of like at that point where I'm like, well, let's see what happens.
4021460	4023120	But there is an expansion coming out.
4023580	4027181	And if they're going to want my $40 for the expansion, I want it to be an expansion I want.
4027381	4036294	I just think that there comes a point and this is something that people in the gaming community need to realize there comes a point when you basically sacrifice your ideals for entertainment
4038497	4043339	Ramakun in chat says Sky, all of this is coming from Activision.
4043419	4045220	They're pushing for this, not Blizzard.
4045600	4047040	I don't care where it's coming from.
4047160	4049401	It sucks.
4049441	4051922	In the end, I don't really care who the boycott is hurting.
4051982	4055963	If it's not something I believe in, then I'm not opposed to quitting.
4056123	4058864	Well, if that's correct, then it means Blizzard is starting to push back.
4061305	4062626	Here's what I'll tell you will happen.
4063806	4065487	I might stick with WoW for now.
4066636	4071562	But there's two MMOs coming out this fall that I am very interested in.
4071782	4074285	Final Fantasy XIV and DC Universe.
4074466	4076148	You're supposed to play Star Trek Online with me.
4076188	4079412	And at some point I'm supposed to squeeze Star Trek Online in there too.
4079712	4081234	You can quit and play with me.
4081354	4082836	I'm not paying for four MMOs.
4083717	4084939	So quit World of Warcraft and play with me.
4086363	4086763	We'll see.
4087104	4091007	You can play with all of my really cool new friends in my fleet.
4092088	4095310	In fact, I promised that I would give them a plug, and I'm going to.
4096551	4097652	Oh, yeah, go ahead.
4098433	4103277	I would like to give my... Although they're probably mostly all asleep because they're all in the UK.
4103477	4104518	Of course they are.
4104578	4105439	Of course they are.
4105879	4107601	The independent United Fleet.
4107961	4109342	They are super cool people.
4110123	4111003	And, well, there's a couple.
4111224	4114106	There's one from Hawaii and one from New York, I think, so...
4116213	4117472	I'm not the only American there!
4118661	4146754	one more thing I want to say on Real ID and boycotting WoW and all that here's another thing to consider is that again this isn't just about Warcraft I am really looking forward to Diablo 3 I really like Diablo 2 and I really really want to play Diablo 3 so that's another reason I kind of want Blizzard to do the right thing here because realize that if I have to quit WoW because of this if Blizzard takes it a step further in the wrong direction and I end up quitting WoW over this I'm going to have to quit Diablo 3 as well
4147094	4150976	Rob, well, it's not the same, but you could always have Torchlight.
4151016	4152317	I do have Torchlight, and it's great.
4152677	4155138	So, yeah, there's the Torchlight MMO to look forward to next year.
4155178	4156959	I suppose there's a... We'll always have Torchlight.
4157119	4160841	SSG100Map backs me up that you can play Star Trek Online with me and Travis.
4162142	4162602	Oh, God.
4162662	4167925	Travis will do nothing but dare me to do dumb shit in Star Trek Online, just like he does on Twitter.
4167945	4171807	There's no real way that you can do dumb shit on Star Trek Online.
4171927	4173008	Oh, that sounds like a challenge.
4175354	4179878	Run without armor into a horde of Klingons and watch them kick you in the face.
4179958	4182400	Let's not forget my first character.
4182561	4187746	When I was in the beta, my character's name was Captain Sassy of the USS O'Girl.
4190734	4192195	Captain America is not named Jack, he's Steve.
4216954	4217495	Let's move on.
4217535	4223540	I want to move on to other gaming stories, but real quick, thank you guys who have kind of bared with my hatred of Real ID over the past couple weeks on this show.
4223580	4228565	I know not everybody's into WoW and all that, but remember, I just want to remind you guys, precedent.
4229186	4232389	This could have a huge effect on online gaming as we know it.
4232509	4234931	I mean, imagine if Xbox Live required it, your real name.
4235132	4236533	Would you stick with Xbox Live?
4237714	4238554	Just throwing it out there, guys.
4238574	4239555	All right, let's move on.
4239595	4240675	Completely new topic.
4240695	4243617	There's actually something that Bobby just said in chat that I think is amazing.
4243657	4243937	What's that?
4243957	4244377	Go ahead and read it.
4244397	4248679	To draw a parallel, he said, first they came for the WoW people, and I said nothing for I don't play WoW.
4248879	4254582	You know, he said something similar on his Twitter this week about the whole thing, and I think that's a great little analogy.
4254762	4263666	Well, for anyone who don't know, in the last thing, it's like finally they came for me, and there was no one to say anything for me.
4263826	4265207	And I think that...
4266207	4270429	You know, it's like you're saying this is going to set a precedent and it's time to stop it in its tracks.
4271309	4273650	And I still say everyone should quit.
4274050	4276151	Surezo in chatroom says, it's okay, Rob.
4276971	4278532	Ranting on WoW is okay with me.
4278912	4280212	And here's the thing, though, guys.
4280432	4283414	There were a lot of people on Twitter when I said I was so frustrated with this.
4283434	4286435	They were like, yay, quit WoW, quit WoW, it's stupid, blah, blah, blah.
4287315	4288156	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4304613	4305814	Thanks for watching!
4326244	4329847	But it's hard to just say, oh, quit.
4330767	4333389	Because you are saying goodbye to all your friends when you do that.
4333449	4336131	But I also understand it's just a game.
4336211	4340194	And at the end of the day, if you believe in something that strongly, then you need to walk away.
4340274	4342176	And that is what I will do if...
4344017	4344817	and Push Comes to Show.
4344877	4354280	If this makes you feel better, Rob, I still keep up with at least four of the people from the free server that I played on in Ragnarok Online and back from the old school days.
4354800	4357621	Keep in mind that I quit, what, six years ago?
4358901	4361782	I still keep up with at least three people from there.
4362982	4367123	Luckily, most of the people I play with I already know in real life, but there are a few.
4367183	4369004	There's a couple that were listeners of the show.
4369363	4369503	Segue!
4369523	4369703	Segue!
4384858	4386779	We're coming to the PSP, real ID.
4388180	4390722	It affects nobody.
4392583	4394184	So yes, apparently this is great.
4394564	4396865	Great planning on Sony's part.
4397165	4399107	Gotta love their forethought in this.
4400027	4405232	iPad, PSP, and Invisibles may not support the PSP Go in North America.
4407194	4418464	Of course, these games do require the PlayStation Portable Camera, which would have plugged into the USB port on the top of the 3000, 2000, 1000 models.
4421827	4429012	You may remember, though, that the PSP Go does not have that port on top of its system.
4429413	4438620	Instead, they have some sort of an adapter or converter cable that is released in Japan to be able to use that kind of stuff.
4439260	4440841	That's not coming out over here.
4443003	4443863	So...
4445734	4447475	PSP Go is a big fucking flop.
4469324	4471045	It is a big fucking flop, and you know why?
4471065	4472285	But Sony can't say that.
4472485	4473406	Of course they can.
4473426	4474306	Sony can't say that.
4474486	4475766	And you know why it's a big fucking flop?
4476087	4479328	Have they done any more bundles to try to promote the PSP Go?
4479428	4479588	No.
4479868	4482969	The last bundle that came out was a PSP 3000 with Metal Gear Solid.
4482989	4487091	There's another bundle coming out with Madden.
4487951	4491192	There's going to be another bundle coming out, I think, for Kingdom Hearts.
4491692	4493633	Notice all those are with PSP 3000s.
4493993	4496054	They are not with the PSP Go.
4497941	4526004	so is that sort of Sony's way of declaring it dead without declaring it dead well just like they're still willing to say that the UMD format is awesome for movies that it was a successful format I mean they're just they're never willing to admit defeat despite the fact that defeat might be you know very obvious much like the court case I was in for the last three weeks are these games themselves you think are going to be any good
4528422	4528562	No.
4528963	4532608	It seemed like for a while there, the PSP had all these pretty cool games coming out on it.
4532648	4535593	Now, is it just me or are things slowing down on that front?
4536846	4540889	It seems like everything that's on the PSP right now is just ports of PS3 games.
4541009	4542231	Which, you know, okay.
4542851	4543412	I understand.
4543672	4545293	You want to port a lot of stuff to handheld.
4545754	4546274	Makes sense.
4546715	4551499	But, I mean, the PSP hasn't had a lot of original stuff, right?
4551599	4555783	I know there was the Final Fantasy fighting game, but that's the last one I can think of.
4556864	4558046	There was a pretty good, like what?
4558146	4559887	Congratulations, you've won, Jamie.
4560468	4561389	I hate those things.
4562662	4563302	But you've won.
4563742	4566843	You should be congratulated.
4567743	4568624	So let's see here.
4569004	4572245	Yeah, there's been some good exclusive PSP games.
4572285	4574125	A lot of it's like niche RPG stuff.
4574725	4580567	There's the occasional first party Sony title, which is like a God of War title or something like that.
4581307	4584888	Motorstorm, Arctic, whatever the hell they call it.
4587049	4587850	They're okay.
4588931	4594397	I mean, even they're decent, but it's just not like you're not getting really good third-party titles.
4594437	4599962	I mean, Metal Gear Solid is going to be pretty good, but just there's not a lot of them out there.
4600023	4600243	I mean...
4602469	4603330	Thanks for watching!
4619620	4624382	EyePet, Invisibles, if you really had a PSP Go, I don't think you're going to be too sad about that.
4624402	4633565	Because, really, EyePet, you know, an augment of reality game where you raise a little pet, I don't think a lot of people that own the PSP Go give a shit.
4634145	4642648	Or Invisibles, you know, a game that's kind of like Monster Rancher, but, you know, you take pictures of stuff and, you know, based on the picture you get these little animals or whatever.
4643909	4643989	Uh...
4645493	4670139	I don't give a shit about that either that's just like saying oh it's so sad that we didn't have the GPS function for some game like they had one for one of the golf games where you could go and get information about golf courses and stuff like that if you took your PSP with you nowadays if you want that kind of crap you have an iPhone or an iPod or something like that
4670919	4671420	Any phone that has apps.
4696039	4701385	This is coming from Ryuji Yamada in a newspaper report in the Wall Street Journal.
4701666	4704589	He's the president of NTT Dokomo Inc.
4704910	4707373	It's the biggest wireless carrier in Japan.
4707914	4710317	That's the company that had the cool Gatchaman commercials.
4710397	4710637	Yeah, it
4710697	4711538	Video Game Makers
4736076	4741640	Well, yeah, I mean, gosh, the 3G in an iPad makes it, what, $120 more expensive?
4742981	4751126	I think these will be certain versions of these types of hardware, but I don't think you're going to see this in the first phase of the 3DS, but certainly there could be a later phase.
4751566	4758291	Just like the DSi came out later on, there'll probably be a 3DSi phone or something like that coming out.
4758811	4761813	I mean, in a way, isn't the iPhone kind of the big competitor right now?
4762791	4763891	It is.
4764712	4768593	Like it or not, the iPhone and iPad are handheld gaming systems right now.
4771853	4774634	You know, I don't buy that, though.
4774734	4780736	I mean, I understand if you put out a lot of games on a platform, I guess we can call it a gaming platform.
4781576	4782816	The PC is a gaming platform.
4782836	4784557	There's tons of games on there.
4785417	4788998	And just because a lot of people buy them, I mean, I guess it's just...
4791786	4795248	What I'm trying to say is people that buy Apple products are very sheepish.
4796228	4798449	Um... Bah?
4799870	4800110	No.
4801511	4809434	I actually sat and compared the stats between that and the BlackBerry and honestly I've used a bunch of different ones and I like my iPhone.
4811475	4817538	So, you know, clearly the reason why a lot of people have it is because it's actually a good product.
4817638	4821180	Now, I do believe in the rule of thumb, wait until the second generation...
4822665	4825626	Alright, have you seen this YouTube that's been floating around this week?
4825646	4827026	Because it's really, really funny.
4827086	4829787	And look, I am an Apple fan too, and I want an iPhone 4.
4830087	4832248	But this YouTube was so freaking funny.
4833448	4834348	How may I help you?
4834749	4835349	iPhone 4.
4836049	4836949	Where is the iPhone 4?
4837929	4838930	I need an iPhone 4.
4839410	4842511	Oh, I'm very sorry, but we are currently sold out.
4843191	4846872	However, we did finally get some more HTC EVOS in.
4847212	4847392	What?
4848052	4848653	What is that?
4849373	4850093	Is it an iPhone?
4850470	4852952	No, it is that 4G phone on Sprint.
4853272	4855273	If it's not an iPhone, why would I want it?
4855593	4858716	Well, it's similar to an iPhone, but has a bigger screen.
4859116	4859736	I don't care.
4860076	4862878	The internet speeds are around three times faster.
4863198	4863819	I don't care.
4864179	4867341	It has a higher resolution camera on both the front and the back.
4867681	4868302	I don't care.
4868682	4872084	And it doesn't require you to be on Wi-Fi to use video chat.
4872364	4872985	I don't care.
4873345	4876567	Its battery is replaceable, as is the memory card.
4876887	4877508	I don't care.
4877848	4884169	It is highly customizable, everything from the widgets to the icons, the fonts and even has video wallpaper.
4884509	4885129	I don't care.
4885469	4886850	The monthly bill is cheaper.
4887190	4887830	I don't care.
4888170	4889310	It fucking prints money.
4889710	4890330	I don't care.
4890690	4895111	It can grant up to three wishes, even if one of those wishes is for an iPhone.
4895471	4896091	I don't care.
4896451	4901932	It has an app that will build you an island, and then it fucking transforms into a jet and flies you there.
4902312	4902952	I don't care.
4903252	4905273	And it's motherfucking indestructible.
4905633	4906853	I don't care about any of that.
4907173	4907973	Okay, fine.
4908273	4912835	Then what the hell entices you about the iPhone 4, if you don't mind me asking?
4913195	4914015	It is an iPhone.
4914335	4916376	You do realize that doesn't mean anything.
4916656	4917156	It's a brand.
4917176	4921837	Alright, that's on Tiny Watch Productions on YouTube, and I just thought that stuff was funny.
4922457	4925138	That's the whole sheep thing you were talking about, right, Loki?
4925638	4928619	Yes, and bad, bad, bad, because I want one.
4931795	4939809	And I'm not saying everybody, there's a few people out there that actually do look at the specs and stuff, but a lot of people just go, oh my god, Apple's releasing something, go buy it.
4940270	4941311	Like the iPad.
4941852	4942433	Come on.
4942754	4943515	The iPad.
4943535	4943595	The
4945952	4946452	I don't get it.
4947253	4947713	I don't get it.
4947913	4950454	By the way, there's some arguments back and forth.
4950474	4958296	Apparently the guy who made that video actually works for Best Buy, and there was a little, like, I guess he was fired, but then he wasn't, according to a story on Gizmodo.
4958316	4959737	But he didn't go back, I don't think.
4959777	4962218	I think he told them to take his job and shove it.
4962258	4963018	Yeah, basically.
4963598	4964198	I don't care.
4966779	4970181	I guess that whole text-to-video thing is really easy to do now.
4970281	4970401	Sorry.
4976366	4980428	I would take the ferret ten times over that stupid Vuvuzela thing.
4980468	4983629	If that becomes a new thing on the show, I'm going to kill myself.
4984709	4984989	Alright.
4987570	4988251	We found the Tribble.
4988491	4989091	We found Angus.
4990188	4991128	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5010337	5012398	My phone used to be silver.
5012578	5015280	It is now gray because all the paint has rubbed off on it.
5015620	5021523	The rubber that used to be on this phone covering the different speaker ports and whatever has dissolved to nothing.
5022443	5024725	Some of the backlights are probably burnt out.
5025065	5027406	It doesn't get internet at all.
5027426	5029767	It still has an old logo.
5029867	5032729	Loki's phone is so last gen.
5033129	5034371	That's basically what it is.
5034391	5035473	It's only three gens ago.
5035693	5037175	This is like more than that.
5037395	5038898	But here's the point, though.
5039438	5044125	The reason why I don't get a new phone and don't upgrade my service and stuff, because it's fucking expensive.
5044286	5047831	I pay $50 a month for this phone, of which I use...
5048872	5051473	I pay $80 for mine, granted.
5051533	5053414	You don't want to know what Dan and I spend.
5053494	5058957	I pay $80 for mine, granted, but for $30, I mean, I have internet everywhere, Loki.
5059037	5059797	Internet everywhere.
5060218	5068181	I have to say this, and the big thing for me is that if I wanted to have a permanent internet tether, all I have to do is jailbreak my iPhone.
5069102	5071723	And I can go anywhere and use the 3G as my internet.
5072523	5077046	Or, you know, it has my... Because otherwise, I was actually looking into buying a PDA.
5080062	5081443	This replaces a PDA for me.
5082043	5085584	It replaces my phone, my PDA, and I don't have to carry my Game Boy around.
5086744	5090465	You can use... And my MP3 player.
5090525	5094226	I just want to tell you, here's a really good reason why you want to have internet on your cell phone.
5094746	5097027	Because with internet on your cell phone... No camera on this either.
5097227	5097987	No, but here's the thing.
5098007	5102368	With internet on your cell phone, you can read TMZ while pooping.
5104992	5108334	You can sneak into the bathroom at work and play Peggle.
5110536	5112837	Just so you know.
5113658	5118802	Speaking of pooping, I just heard a huge gunshot go off in the living room and almost made me poop right here.
5118822	5119822	He's playing Crackdown 2.
5119862	5121464	We had Epic Subwoofer, remember?
5124206	5125727	You know what keeps me from getting an iPhone?
5126187	5127528	I can't fucking afford it.
5128168	5130830	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5153516	5154697	How about dating sims, Rob?
5154717	5157058	This is the best DRM ever.
5159179	5170985	Okay, for people who have pirated versions of Love Plus, well, when they play their pirated version, they find a little surprise when they shut off their game and turn it back on.
5172937	5179668	Um, basically, instead of having to, you know, bypass this and that and not being able to play it, they're like, sure, go ahead and play the game.
5180089	5183074	And you get all your happy love points with the girl, and yay.
5183455	5184436	Then you start the game back up.
5184496	5185238	She hates you.
5187270	5188991	You cannot get her to like you again.
5189051	5195236	You cannot get any of the girls to like you again because they know you're a pirate and girls don't like pirates.
5195837	5197678	At least not in dating sim land.
5197838	5199540	Why won't she love me?
5199560	5202502	Because you're a dirty ass thief, that's why.
5204287	5210530	and, well, to read some of these quotes on here, I was dating her normally, and when I restarted, she was pissed at me.
5210890	5213311	I can't get her to like me, and she's always annoyed at me.
5213591	5215372	It's the ultimate anti-piracy measure.
5216313	5219134	I tried the friend part of Love Plus again to get some scenes I missed.
5219454	5219854	You're right.
5220155	5221475	She wouldn't let us become lovers.
5222135	5224497	After 100 days, she still won't let me become her boyfriend.
5224917	5227238	She completely ignores me and won't send me any mails.
5227298	5229079	She would never let me see her tits.
5229319	5230880	The events aren't happening either.
5231260	5231600	Brutal.
5233038	5236220	Let's see, if the developer hates you, the girls hate you too.
5236360	5237121	What a surprise.
5237661	5240283	And it's written into the game's copy production.
5240703	5242565	DarkSakura, would you show your boobs to a pirate?
5244986	5245447	Depends.
5245667	5247308	Have you shown your boobs to a pirate?
5249321	5249722	Yo-ho.
5249742	5253065	Depends.
5253505	5256188	Keep in mind, I've done some interesting things.
5256288	5257589	Mardi Gras did come from my hometown.
5257669	5258570	I know, I know.
5258610	5260512	Look, let's not go there.
5261833	5264376	But this reminds me of the... This shirt would be easy to do.
5265717	5266558	Well, no, no, no.
5266578	5268300	Why do you have to say that while we're trying to do a show?
5268460	5273885	I was cleaning out my closet and I found this shirt and it's too big for me because it was from when I was 20 pounds heavier.
5274958	5275158	DarkSakura
5293731	5295972	Every time I see that, I'm like, yeah, I have a friend that would do that.
5296933	5297893	Not Jamie, somebody else.
5298213	5299714	I would never do that at Disneyland, Rob.
5299874	5302296	Not at Disneyland, but at Mardi Gras.
5302636	5305258	No, no, no, no, because Mardi Gras does not have boob flashing.
5305578	5308199	I mean, it does, but it's sort of like, what the crap are you doing?
5308220	5310161	I'm showing my boobs.
5311862	5313303	Seriously, you do it at Mardi Gras.
5313543	5315324	You're being stupid.
5315964	5317145	We don't care about your tits.
5317905	5318626	We want moon pies.
5319696	5323438	I'm remembering the Gabriel Iglesias skit where they flashed.
5323719	5326780	Oh yeah, and they thought that it were a couple women because they're man boobs.
5326800	5327681	They look like sexy bitches.
5328742	5329602	Because they're man boobs.
5329762	5337707	I want to say real quick, it reminded me that whole little story of, I know we've covered it on the show before, the Earthbound copy protection or whatever it was.
5337827	5340249	Where the game got harder if you pirated it.
5340309	5343571	There would be like, yeah, four times as many monsters and it deletes itself.
5343631	5345312	In the last battle, it flashed.
5345512	5351497	Freezes, you truly cannot comprehend the true form of the attack because it deletes your fucking save file.
5352058	5352719	That's brutal.
5353940	5363769	Well, I mean, if you're gonna pirate a game... However, I would love to see the people who got that far with it in... You know, I wanna see a ROM hack where you can play it that difficult and beat the game.
5364109	5364770	I think it's been done.
5365070	5365270	Okay.
5365550	5366191	People just...
5367168	5368591	Get around this copy protection.
5368631	5369612	It won't take long.
5369913	5373619	But no, but I think it's fun that that's what they do because they recognize it's going to happen.
5373980	5377366	Let's just make their lives a little bit of hell until they figure it out.
5377846	5379629	By then, we'll hit our sales.
5380371	5380831	We're done.
5381496	5410784	Well, we also had a story not too long ago, probably about four or five months ago, about the whole Batman Arkham Asylum had been pirated, and apparently in the pirated version of the game, one of the, and I'm trying to go from memory here, so forgive me if I screw this up, one of the jump types was missing, or there was a puzzle that couldn't be finished, and a guy went on the forums to complain about it, and the creators of the game, or the forum moderators basically said, yeah, you're playing a pirated version of the game, because we kind of did that on purpose in the pirated version of the game,
5411064	5412425	Thanks for watching!
5430814	5456589	Rob, that was about as stupid as the guy who complained on the Steam forums that he got banned for what was told to him was an undetectable hack and I shouldn't be banned because it said the hack was undetectable you guys shouldn't have been able to detect it why did I get banned, reverse the ban lol, bye, have a nice day oh, you should probably get your money back for buying that hack
5456809	5458210	That's just called an idiot.
5458370	5460471	Somewhere in a lunchroom, nerds are laughing.
5460491	5462233	It's just an idiot.
5462453	5467036	This is one thing I actually really do dig about The Sims.
5467716	5475622	I'm not playing a... All my copies are legit and registered, but I download hacks like crazy for them.
5476922	5486449	The EA actually looks at some of the stuff that people make modded stuff for and actually incorporate those themes into their future releases for their store.
5487770	5488610	They know what happens.
5488971	5494074	I think the moral of the story here is buy your games legitimately and maybe you can see some tits.
5495815	5500739	I think if you pay for your game legitimately and then mod it.
5502000	5503060	I'm sorry.
5503601	5508944	The only way that you can get the patches that EA puts out is to basically reinstall everything, which I've done.
5511006	5512587	But I only do that when I buy new versions.
5513300	5520624	But still, I like it better when a company understands that it's going to happen, and then they fuck with you.
5520744	5521244	Well, I agree.
5521364	5523425	Once you buy it, you should be able to hack the shit out of it.
5523525	5526547	It's your copy of the game, and if you want to tear it apart, go for it.
5527367	5534111	I don't think you should hack it to re-upload it to be free and all that, but whatever.
5534966	5535787	Let's move on.
5535867	5537368	Let's talk about release dates.
5537428	5541450	Speaking of buying your games legitimately, there's a whole lot of games you can buy legitimately this week.
5541911	5542951	Loki, start us off with the U.S.
5543231	5546654	Including Chuck E. Cheese's Party Games for the Nintendo DS.
5547234	5549576	Yes, there's a franchise most people forgot about.
5550556	5555019	Little League World Series Baseball 2010 coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.
5558421	5564705	Then, of course, the Wii version, which includes, I believe, the last year version and this year.
5564725	5567107	I was wondering why they called that Double Play.
5568567	5569768	Interesting.
5574230	5577471	Oh, that's coming out on Wii and DS, I believe.
5578571	5584054	NCAA Football 2011 on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.
5585534	5590436	Pausing Claws Regal Resort, the game with the most retarded cover ever.
5591257	5596499	It has cats and dogs dressed up like their royalty.
5596959	5600961	A cat with a tiara, a dog with a crown, and a bunny dressed up like a jester.
5601161	5601441	What?
5603018	5607902	Cat's and Dogs Revenge of Kitty Galore Disciples 3 Resistance PC
5623732	5625554	and then some more junk.
5626674	5629036	Hidden Objects Mystery Stories.
5629716	5634920	It's a hidden objects game, obviously, and that'll be out on the Nintendo DS.
5636341	5636981	That is it.
5637181	5639163	Oh, oh, wait, no, I'm sorry.
5639843	5641404	Planet Pet Vet Collection.
5641904	5644546	A couple Pet Vet games that have already been released.
5644706	5645767	Oh, and Sorcerer's Apprentice.
5648014	5649195	Yay, movie tie-ins.
5649215	5651075	The movie doesn't look horrible.
5651095	5653356	It has Nicolas Cage, therefore I'm not going to see it.
5653576	5655537	Hey, it has Nicolas Cage as Nicolas Cage.
5658318	5664761	Salacious Pop in our chatroom says, Oh, so cats can be CEOs and presidents, but bunnies can't be little kings and princesses.
5664861	5665261	Okay.
5666502	5667122	It's different.
5668443	5669643	Why you got to hate on the bunnies, man?
5670884	5671524	Because I can't.
5671877	5672137	All right.
5672678	5675721	Let's go over to Japanese release dates and see what's coming out around the world.
5676462	5677823	Xbox 360 in Japan.
5677883	5678884	PGA Woods.
5679285	5679725	I'm sorry.
5679785	5680346	Tiger Woods.
5680626	5681747	PGA.
5681767	5682568	Pretty much the same thing.
5682908	5684350	Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11.
5685651	5689575	That's the one that South Park would have you believe has the whole fighting simulation in it.
5689615	5690416	And it really should have.
5690576	5693279	It really would have made the game so much more interesting.
5693859	5696843	On the PlayStation 3, same thing, but there's a couple other games too.
5697243	5699926	Naruto, Narutimate Storm gets a price reduction.
5700387	5705673	But as far as new games go, there's one coming out from Konami called GQ Powerful Pro Yaku 2010.
5705793	5706374	This is baseball.
5706474	5706714	Yep.
5709637	5711238	Dragon Quest Monsters Battle Road Victory Game
5734255	5736296	Fire Emblem Shin Monsu no Nazo Hikari Tutakage no Yu
5758110	5759770	So that's coming out a little early in Japan.
5760210	5761931	Love Plus gets a price reduction.
5762591	5764771	Keshikakukon comes out as well.
5765192	5767232	And Metal Fight Beyblade.
5767472	5771693	Bakugami Shushono Shurai comes out from Hudson.
5772213	5774454	I'm not sure if that's a series we know here.
5776374	5777914	It's an action-based game.
5777934	5780255	It looks like it comes with a special little controller or something.
5780315	5781935	It's kind of a thicker packaging.
5782595	5784236	I don't know if that's like one of those... What is it?
5784456	5784896	Beyblade?
5785336	5785596	Yeah.
5785616	5785696	Yeah.
5786016	5787977	It's a series that's been out over here.
5788437	5790458	Beyblade is... Spinning Tops.
5791499	5792359	Oh, that's what those are.
5792480	5793980	Remember that one game?
5794120	5801024	Well, it wasn't Tops, but it was... Where was the game that you were shooting silver... Crossfire.
5801164	5801844	Yeah, it's Crossfire.
5801864	5803165	Crossfire!
5804326	5806487	With the really useless pieces that would spin around.
5806883	5832758	and lastly on the PSP the Castlevania Dracula X Chronicles gets a price reduction but as far as new games go there's Last Ranker comes out Papa Music Portable gets a price reduction Naruto Shippuden Kizuna Drive comes out and Busou Shinki Battle Masters comes out as well from Konami which looks like um is that a shmup because it kind of looks like it from the cover it's one of those robo anime babes it looks like she turns into a plane
5834537	5836158	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5864947	5866448	I don't like that, too.
5868209	5870690	Or at least a way that you can de-tag it yourself.
5873012	5873752	I think you can.
5874093	5874313	Really?
5874653	5874813	Yeah.
5874833	5875914	I haven't seen it yet.
5876574	5879176	Anyway, so, games.
5879876	5885459	Well, and this is actually, you know, yesterday, but it's worth saying the Silver Lining came out, woohoo.
5885579	5887260	On the 13th, Deathspank.
5888461	5889121	I don't get it.
5889762	5889922	What?
5889942	5891663	It's a game on Xbox Live Arcade.
5892117	5893359	and PlayStation 3.
5896144	5903317	Destination Arcade and then the 16th Puzzle Quest 2 and Toy Story 3, the video game, which actually I was looking at the preview for that.
5903337	5904018	It looks kind of fine.
5905066	5905546	DarkSakura.com
5925970	5932535	Yes, there has been a trial date, or at least a couple trial dates, set for the Infinity Ward suit.
5932575	5944583	You may remember, of course, the founders of Infinity Ward were forcefully departed from their company and are now suing for royalties that were unpaid.
5945523	5947484	The lawsuit will take place on May 23, 2011.
5951125	5961489	There's also supposed to be another hearing on August 5 to determine whether a third lawsuit filed by employees of Infinity Ward against Activision should be considered with the other two lawsuits.
5963409	5976252	On, I guess, March 1st, Activision dismissed both Wes and Zampella, the creators of the Call of Duty series, for alleging insubordination and breach of contract by the two.
5976932	5987934	And, of course, they're suing seeking $36 million in unpaid royalties and alleging Activision rigged an investigation into their conduct to find a pretext to fire them.
5988694	6001905	Activision filed a countersuit against the two and of course since then they've created the Respawn Entertainment Studio and there's I believe at least 40 of the employees that have kind of moved over to their new studio as well
6003499	6005621	I think I know what Activision could do about it.
6006702	6009104	They could hire that lawyer you had to deal with.
6009764	6010205	God.
6010625	6012867	If that's the case, dude, I'm serious.
6012987	6021234	If that's the case, that trial will take about three years to complete because that guy is slow and confusing and will not help them out in one bit.
6021754	6024576	And I'm sure that they can afford a better lawyer than that because...
6026898	6028580	The defense for us, the jury hibernates.
6028640	6029561	He was terrible.
6044534	6046295	Can't we all just get along?
6046595	6047055	No!
6047375	6055898	I wish I could have recorded that trial just so people can understand the kind of pain and suffering I, you know, was affected by.
6057158	6060899	I should sue her for the pain and suffering of that trial.
6060939	6063720	No, it was seriously such a waste of time.
6064631	6069096	Alright, well, I'm sure there's going to be lots of... I can't believe it's actually going to trial.
6069156	6070778	Most of this stuff usually gets settled.
6071499	6072660	I hope it's on Court TV.
6073261	6073881	Or maybe E!
6073901	6075063	will do some reenactments.
6075183	6077465	Remember during the Michael Jackson trial when he did the reenactments?
6077485	6078446	That was the best stuff ever.
6078707	6079948	It's about gaming companies.
6079988	6080809	Nobody gives a shit.
6080869	6081650	Yeah, I guess that's true.
6082010	6082491	But, you know...
6086624	6107528	Alright, let's move on and talk about this interesting little story about Roger Ebert, which I find kind of interesting because, you know, he was kind of, a few years ago, no, actually it wasn't a few years ago, probably about a year ago, he made this post about video games are not art and can never be art.
6108189	6110169	He's basically saying, you know, video games are...
6110749	6111149	Not art!
6111529	6115731	And he took a lot of crap from people that were like, you know, well, what about Flower?
6115811	6117412	What about Shadow of the Colossus?
6117472	6121954	What about, you know, all these other great games that, you know, you're not really giving a fair shot to?
6123075	6127977	Well, Roger Ebert actually came out, and this is actually kind of in the week we were gone, but it was worth mentioning here.
6128377	6131400	saying, I was a fool for mentioning video games in the first place.
6131820	6134482	I would never express an opinion on a movie I hadn't seen.
6134842	6144450	So he did make kind of like a, if you will, like a retraction post, but when I read it, I didn't really see it as a retraction post, more or less as like an olive branch type of post.
6145291	6145611	Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh...
6161886	6184615	To supply him with a system and games that they consider to be artful And he still refuses to play them He just isn't going to make a statement about things he doesn't want to experience Yeah, so one thing I think you should kind of make sure you pull away from this He didn't come out and say, okay, they're art He's just saying, you know what, I shouldn't have said anything
6185003	6185503	It's my bad.
6185603	6187205	Passive-aggressive bullshit.
6187345	6189466	If you can't say something nice, don't say anything.
6191687	6194209	Yeah, it's very interesting that he kind of won't play the games.
6194289	6197852	But, you know, at the same time, no one has to do anything they don't want to do.
6198612	6199793	No one has to do anything.
6200153	6201294	So, there you go.
6202214	6205417	He's basically come out and said, I'm not going to do it, so you know what?
6205597	6206717	I'm not going to comment on it.
6207018	6208859	And I was bad to comment on it in the first place.
6209815	6213678	And so most people are like, okay, you know, I never hated the guy for what he said.
6213718	6215500	I mean, hate would always be a strong word anyway.
6215540	6219043	I've rather thought his opinions on movies were very interesting and so forth.
6219503	6225348	But, you know, I think, yeah, you probably shouldn't make such a bold statement about something you really haven't... I mean, especially...
6226744	6232286	Games like, you know, The Flowers and The Shadow Colossus and Final Fantasy is a more artful type of games.
6232306	6235387	I mean, you can't just associate video games with Mortal Kombat.
6235427	6240068	That would be like just associating movies with Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus.
6240808	6242189	I bet Ebert wouldn't appreciate that.
6244660	6260420	it still bugs me a little bit that he's choosing to maintain his level of ignorance rather than accept some enlightenment that's being offered him that's what still bugs me he's refusing to be educated
6261317	6262817	And that's a lot of people, though.
6262957	6265058	That's a big failing of humanity.
6265078	6266898	That's what bugs me about a lot of people.
6266918	6269999	To be fair, the guy's got a lot of other stuff to worry about.
6272240	6273780	There's no way to be fair about it.
6274500	6281482	Ignorance, especially self-imposed ignorance, is, to me, unforgivable.
6281502	6284223	Well, at least he came out and said, I was ignorant and I shouldn't have said anything.
6284243	6285203	I mean, maybe he didn't say that.
6285263	6286243	And you know what?
6286263	6287503	I'm going to choose to remain ignorant.
6287543	6288243	Thank you very much.
6288664	6289244	Have a good day.
6289984	6290284	Shut up.
6292080	6314999	alright to each their own that's it for the news but we can't end this segment just yet we've got to get to the classic video game of the week that's right here on the show we always take a few minutes to say hey why are you not admiring these games from the past you should take a moment to respect your elders and the elder games that came before you
6315373	6316594	It's super, super quiet, you guys.
6316674	6317935	Well, it's Dragon Slayer.
6317955	6318916	There you go.
6342012	6343876	So if you want to get on to the other stuff.
6343896	6346342	Let me see if this one plays a little bit louder.
6346402	6348205	Now I feel like I have to move right really quickly.
6348867	6350150	Yeah, this one plays a little louder for me.
6350612	6353974	That's just... That's a complete, perfect playthrough.
6355395	6355995	In HD.
6357016	6373146	So yeah, the game is Dragon's Lair, which I have a bajillion copies of, including the HD copy, and I have it on Sega CD, and... But this game was out on Laserdisc, animated by Don Bluth.
6374306	6374507	And...
6377348	6388099	You basically, as each little section play, you'd have to tap the right direction or the right button and it would bring it up as a little flash on the screen.
6389730	6394493	So you'd have to move in the correct direction based on what it gave you.
6395293	6396734	And you'd have to be pretty fast.
6396774	6405219	I mean, right at the beginning... I mean, I can't tell you how many times I fell through the damn bridge right when you're walking into the lair.
6406760	6408881	It's also out on the iPhone, too, just to say so.
6411363	6416786	Anyway, about the game, you play as Dirk the Daring to rescue Princess Daphne from the evil dragon Sludge.
6417874	6419415	and you go through it.
6420375	6421976	It's really straightforward.
6422596	6428199	Also, this was one of the first arcade games that cost 50 cents to play.
6429540	6432641	And usually most of the other games were a quarter of play.
6435703	6440325	Basically, the game was inspired by the old-text game, Adventure.
6441225	6443887	And so this is called a graphic adventure.
6445348	6465969	Um, when, uh, the game came out, it was basically a big sensation, again, not just because of, uh, the fact that it was more expensive, um, but that, uh, it made games, the game itself shut down quite a bit because it was running on a later disc.
6467122	6470504	Yeah, they basically were overused and really broke down.
6470524	6474546	And it's actually one of the, you know, probably the most popular game of its type.
6474666	6482730	Other ones that came out in the series, there was Space Ace and Dragon's Lair 2.
6483430	6486231	And even, there were a number of other ones that were like that.
6486631	6493875	They even converted the Lupin movie, the Castle of Cagliostro, into one called Cliffjumper.
6495356	6496677	I don't think it was the same company.
6503656	6504617	I love Space Ace.
6505537	6511260	There's also Dragon's Lair 3D Return to the Lair, which is a 3D reinterpretation of the game.
6512781	6520105	They actually had a Dragon's Lair movie scripted and ready to go into production.
6522447	6528910	Right now, though, and they are doing this completely old-school 2D animation, but it's held up in development right now.
6529491	6531092	There's a Blu-ray version of Dragon's Lair...
6533713	6540280	and they basically had to completely go through and remaster everything, clean the cells themselves.
6540720	6546787	Remember when they did the Macross thing where they actually extended the frames out to wider screens?
6546967	6547748	They're doing the same thing.
6550030	6556677	This though is not to be confused with the utterly horrible NES adaptation of Dragon's Lair.
6558577	6560098	This is the good stuff right here.
6560218	6569304	I want to do an aside when Jamie's done because there was a home version I played a lot more of than the arcade game growing up, but I'll get into that in a minute.
6569504	6574167	Well, there's also, you probably have heard Princess Daphne in the background.
6575348	6576909	It doesn't really look very princess-like.
6576969	6578570	She actually is just kind of ditzy and squeaky.
6578590	6579391	She looks like a hoe.
6579631	6580292	She looks like a whoo.
6581372	6583113	A hoover, to quote my mother.
6584454	6595240	But for all the other versions that came, there was... There was actually Escape from Sinja's Castle, which was a non-linear version of it.
6596261	6597682	There was a puzzle one...
6600024	6601685	That came out on the old 8-bit systems.
6602325	6607288	There is the NES one, the Super NES one called Dragon's Lair, which was a platformer version.
6607388	6609189	Also Space Ace had a platformer version.
6610129	6614592	There was a Game Boy one called Dragon's Lair The Legend, which really has nothing to do with it.
6617353	6620255	It's actually a port of an old ZX Spectrum game called Roller Coaster.
6621495	6626657	Um, the Game Boy Color version is actually pretty much like the original.
6628018	6647486	There was Dragon's Lair Deluxe Pack, there was an Apple version, the Sega CD version, talking about the old Mac 1 from 1994, and then the emulator Daphne, where you have to have the original Laserdisc and the ROM file to be able to play that, or they have other versions that use MPEG-2 video streams.
6648386	6652431	So, yeah, there are a lot of versions out, just looking over the list.
6653112	6658539	Ever since 1983, we've had, I'm just going to run off the list of different systems it's been on.
6659040	6659300	Okay?
6659420	6659641	Okay.
6660816	6687485	We've had the Arcade, Coleco Atom, Armstead, CPC, Spectrum, Commodore 64, Atari ST, the Amiga, PC, NES, Game Boy, Mac Plus, Atari ST, more Mac, Sega CD, 3DO, Mega CD, or Sega CD, CDI, Atari Jaguar, Windows 95, let's see...
6690006	6712251	Game Boy Color, PS2, Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation 2, mobile phone, Blu-ray player, PS3, HD DVD players, iPhone, DSi for DSiWare, DS, PSP, and the Wii as a disc.
6713591	6714332	So, wow.
6715152	6722276	And also, the character Dirk was battling mid-life crisis in an episode of Robot Chicken.
6724277	6724517	Nice.
6725537	6727058	And part of the game was parodied in Family Guy.
6730140	6731540	There really wasn't a lot like it.
6731620	6735122	I mean, yeah, there were those other games you mentioned, but I can't think of a lot of games that were really like this.
6735442	6735802	Ever.
6736123	6740645	If you ever thought that the concept of the QuickTime event was new... No.
6740665	6740705	No.
6741090	6743613	No, Dragon's Lair did it way before.
6745114	6748258	And it was even quicker.
6748698	6749479	We're at the end of the game.
6749819	6752622	If DarkSakura's done with her piece, I want to do a quick aside if I could.
6752642	6753183	Please do.
6753223	6760611	Because I played, growing up, an awful lot the Commodore 64 versions of the game, which were different.
6760891	6762212	Let me see if we can get some of the music here.
6763013	6790594	this is kind of like the you know it was much different it took scenes inspired by the arcade game and kind of made them like actiony things like here's that scene where the disc is kind of falling down well instead of you know obviously they couldn't port the movie type stuff at the time so instead they put in these little clouds and you'd have to run away as they're breathing air this game was just as hard if not harder than the arcade game that was out there terribly hard
6790954	6793235	The SNES one was actually kind of difficult.
6793315	6795356	I hated the SNES version of Space Ace, by the way.
6795496	6803841	Some of the music in Dragon's Lair and then the sequel, they also had Dragon's Lair 2, Escape from Singe's Castle, had awesome music.
6803901	6804361	Listen to this.
6806625	6808246	Oh, a little theme song got cut off.
6808266	6810008	Hey, it's the whole Rapids area.
6810028	6810968	Yeah, the whole Rapids area.
6811208	6814291	But I love the music and the boulders area is awesome.
6814331	6815251	Let me see if I can get to that part.
6815291	6819014	Here we go.
6819695	6824458	This is pretty cool.
6827400	6829822	Just, I mean, the soundtrack to this game was awesome.
6829882	6835206	And, you know, it wasn't quite the arcade game, but it was levels kind of inspired by the arcade game every bit as hard.
6835586	6838767	I mean, if I were to play this today, I would not be able to get very far.
6838807	6844508	But yeah, see, you have to run past the things, but you're slowly moving back the whole time, and that's just, you know, one of the other stages.
6844969	6849630	And then later on, you get into, you know, like, here's that one room.
6850450	6851950	Where the thing takes your hat and your sword?
6852130	6856852	And this is a little more like the arcade version, where you have to hit up at certain times.
6857772	6859052	The soundtrack was just awesome.
6860413	6861133	If you're into that whole...
6862156	6863217	Old School Sounding Stuff.
6863797	6868701	So that's my little aside to the Classic Game of the Week is that the Commodore 64 one is definitely worth your attention.
6868741	6870782	I just figured it was about time we did Dragon's Lair.
6871042	6871583	It really was.
6871623	6872583	I'm surprised it's been.
6872623	6874945	I mean, we've been doing the Classic Game of the Week for a long time, right?
6874985	6877087	I have had a feeling that I had already done it.
6877647	6879528	And then I actually went back and checked the list.
6879648	6882510	Thank you, whoever updates, you know, the wiki.
6882651	6883571	Update the rest of it.
6885312	6886273	Give Drew your money.
6888094	6890276	But it's about time.
6890896	6891397	It's about time.
6891957	6892298	Alright.
6893039	6897765	Well, I think we're going to wrap up part A of our show here, but guys, there is plenty more show to come.
6897805	6901249	We have some rapid fire news coming up in the next segment.
6901269	6901549	We'll talk...
6902600	6916552	Oh, excuse me, about Red Dead Redemption, Split Second getting ported, Guitar Hero, Rock Band Updates, and then Anime coming to your 360, Dead Rising 2 News, Twitter Topics, so get your Twitter Topics in, and the Mailbag.
6916612	6922217	It is all coming up right after this when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6928010	6939155	And welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, July the 11th of 2010, where we are taping the 373rd episode of our show.
6939215	6941156	That's right, we've been doing this quite some time.
6941877	6945258	Anyhow, we're going to get into some quick, quick news here in a moment.
6945338	6948880	But first, I wanted to just quickly mention, because I didn't impart A, but it's very important.
6948920	6950881	The big battle is still going on.
6951201	6956085	That's right, it's us versus other all-game shows, or I should say our listeners versus other all-games listeners.
6956646	6965714	I guess the Soldner X competition wrapped up, and sadly, I thought we had at least one person who was going to participate, but for whatever reason, confusion, I don't know, I don't follow.
6966715	6967575	The scores didn't happen.
6968376	6969957	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6993012	7000973	Go in there and then click sign up or register for this competition and that way your name will be in there and they'll come looking for you.
7001654	7005334	So hopefully we'll be able to get some scores, some points on the board there.
7005854	7009155	I see Monty Boggs has participated in Pinball FX.
7009715	7012015	So hopefully we'll get some more representation there in the big battle.
7012055	7013676	You have until Friday the 16th.
7013756	7015216	July 16th is last day.
7015236	7015816	Or is that Saturday?
7016716	7017136	Do my math.
7017156	7017396	Friday.
7017416	7017736	It's Friday.
7017756	7019917	So you have until Friday to get those scores in.
7019957	7020557	So make sure you...
7021537	7022898	Yeah, make sure you get in on the big battle.
7045095	7052121	and, you know, given the track record of Rockstar, I'm not going to try to speculate when they're going to release some of these.
7052361	7058145	But anyways, one we do know for sure is Legends and Killers, which is coming August 2010 for $10.
7058506	7073297	And it will feature nine new multiplayer map locations, eight new multiplayer characters, including some from Red Dead Revolver, new projectile weapon, the Tomahawk, and corresponding multiplayer and single-player challenges, and new achievements and trophies.
7074598	7085221	The next one is coming at a date yet to be determined, and it's called Liars and Cheats, and it'll also be for $10.
7085641	7095223	With that, it's going to include an attack and defend multiplayer competitive mode and challenges, new multiplayer horse races with mounted combat, which sounds cool,
7096324	7112059	Play as the heroes and the villains of Red Dead Redemption as well as 8 new multiplayer characters, multiplayer versions of Liar's Dice and Poker from the single player game, and a new weapon Explosive Rifle with corresponding multiplayer and single player challenges, new achievements and trophies.
7113900	7114060	Um...
7114861	7126964	Let's see, the third expansion would be Free Roam, which includes additional free roam challenges, new action areas and defensive placements, posse scoring and leaderboards, and new anti-griefing measures in free mode.
7127965	7129485	So that's coming later on.
7129945	7132126	And then what game would not be awesome without...
7132706	7158446	Zombies, Undead Nightmare New single player adventure, challenges and quests 8 new multiplayer zombie characters Additional animals to hunt I can only hope there are zombie animals And new dynamic events and more Hopefully more shotguns Every zombie hunter knows a good shotgun goes far Other fun stuff
7160583	7161924	We may have talked about this a little bit.
7161944	7163065	I think I've mentioned it before.
7163786	7172354	The Mega Man 8-bit Deathmatch, which was a mod for Doom 2, has now been released in demo form and is available to the public.
7172914	7182183	This new mod, of course, kind of reskins Doom with the wonderful 8-bit sprites and includes different Mega Man power-ups as well.
7183144	7184345	You can find this...
7186106	7196832	Um, at, uh, HTTP, uh, let's see, cutandstuff.net slash blog slash, uh, question mark, P equals 2218.
7196932	7197712	I'm sure it's probably one.
7197732	7199393	Yeah, I'm sure everybody's writing that down real quick.
7199793	7204356	Yeah, it's, uh, the Cut and Stuff blog, and, uh, they've got a bunch of stuff.
7204476	7207337	And if you've been missing Mega Man Legends, this is as close as you're ever gonna get.
7208117	7209098	Yes, so, uh...
7210632	7211092	Check it out.
7211212	7211813	Looks pretty cool.
7212853	7217015	And then last but not least, we were talking about some PSP games before the break.
7217335	7222258	And one of the PSP games that's coming out will actually be a port of Split Second.
7222978	7224139	And that'll be pretty awesome.
7224159	7228601	It's a cool racing game where you get to detonate a bunch of explosions and cause all sorts of mayhem.
7229481	7231162	And that'll be coming out this fall.
7233453	7236316	Alright, yet another port on its way to PSP.
7236637	7237017	Enjoy that.
7237898	7239440	Hey, I got some quick stuff for you too.
7239500	7241603	Dragon Age 2, finally some details on that.
7241643	7244546	It was missing from E3, but it's dated for March 2011.
7244666	7252195	That's kind of conflicting to the February 1st, 2011 date that was in the Dragon Age Origins Awakening, but hey, at least it's kind of close.
7252575	7254356	March 2011 is when this is coming out.
7254696	7256357	Big, big change from the first game.
7257117	7259718	You're going to be playing as one character named Hawk.
7259838	7262279	And that could be either a male or a female.
7262599	7267121	But no more of this like origin story and all this other stuff that the first Dragon Age had.
7267202	7270343	And you're basically going to be this one character, be it male or female.
7270483	7272964	Like Hawk, like Mass Effect where you're Commander Shepard.
7272984	7273604	I'm Commander Shepard.
7273624	7274905	This is my favorite story in the Citadel.
7275245	7275685	There you go.
7275745	7277446	So it's kind of the same type of thing.
7277926	7284548	And I guess they're trying to do that to make more cinematic type of stuff where they can kind of involve Hawk in the cinematics.
7284848	7286488	And actually address you by name.
7286728	7287248	Exactly.
7287688	7291790	So that's their big plans for the game.
7292070	7292930	I think that could be good.
7294450	7302793	But I like that some folks are suggesting you could name your character like Hudson Hawk or Ethan Hawk or all these others.
7302813	7304453	Hudson Hawk is good, just not Mike.
7305638	7305958	Anyhow.
7307600	7308600	Yeah, so I don't know.
7308640	7309801	I like the first game.
7309861	7311803	I'm curious kind of how the second game is going to play out.
7311863	7313684	That definitely is a radical shift, though.
7313724	7318728	I think the first being a little more open in the first game really kind of drew a lot of people to that.
7318788	7320109	But I still think it'll be cool.
7321030	7321590	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7342699	7344681	They kinda have to have a game to rate it.
7368228	7395474	but do you remember we were talking on this show before about the NBA Jam catchphrase competition and folks can submit their own catchphrases well it's Boom Shaka Laka well that's already in the game but you have to come up with the next Boom Shaka Laka and these are the I guess the four that made it into the game I think objection sustained when you get a block shot no shoot for you
7396574	7397094	I love it.
7399256	7402498	And the survey says denied on a block.
7402858	7404960	And then I have no idea where this one comes from.
7405460	7407381	Bangalangadooda for a dunk.
7407862	7408542	Say what?
7408902	7409823	Bangalangadooda.
7413092	7415653	Probably from the same place that Boom Shakalaka came from?
7415693	7416133	I don't know.
7416193	7417093	It's kind of like the sequel.
7417633	7418154	The Reject?
7418194	7421815	I'd like to hear a little song made out of Boom Shakalaka and Banga Langa Doodah.
7422955	7425236	Sounds like the singers in an 80s hair band.
7425276	7425576	I don't know.
7425956	7427276	Alright, moving on.
7427476	7428577	Sounds like Sha Na Na.
7429941	7434264	A little more information is coming out about the Michael Jackson-based video game.
7434324	7437126	It's going to be called Michael Jackson The Experience.
7438127	7444111	And you will actually be able to play as Michael Jackson and you get to relive his iconic performances.
7444531	7447453	And that would be using the Move, the Connect, or the Wii.
7447753	7450755	And you're basically going to dance along with the prompts on the screen.
7450815	7453617	You can also sing along on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.
7454197	7456739	You can use the Connect's built-in mic to do this.
7457139	7459721	There's also going to be DS and PSP versions of this game.
7460141	7461202	It's going to be tapping.
7461462	7462823	Think Elite Beat Agents.
7463164	7463784	That's kind of cool.
7464164	7466907	It's coming out in November if you want to check this game out.
7466947	7470690	And boy would I pay a lot of money for YouTubes of Loki playing this game.
7471210	7474393	We've already had a good Michael Jackson based game.
7474473	7476014	It was called Moonwalker.
7477095	7478036	I thought you said a good game.
7479417	7481078	It was a good game.
7481118	7482559	Depends what system you played it on.
7482619	7484160	Depends what system you played it on.
7484180	7484361	Alright.
7484961	7485421	I don't know.
7486642	7486843	I would...
7488456	7489057	DarkSakura
7507300	7511382	Well, we have some definite news in our music games.
7512082	7522266	We have for a rock band, we've got stuff by Sweet Billy Pilgrim.
7523126	7526928	We have Get Out, he's a rocker, Orange Amber.
7528379	7529940	I'm sorry, that's the Vines Pack.
7530000	7531081	My apologies, my apologies.
7531942	7539529	For the Vines Pack, we have Get Out, He's a Rocker, Orange Amber, Out of the Way, and Ride, and then Sweet Billy Pilgrim, Future Perfect Tense.
7540970	7545414	And of course, these are basically Buck 99 a piece.
7547776	7548257	Woo, Buck 99!
7549802	7563896	And for DJ Hero, we actually have some good news that the sales are up to 1.2 million units That's pretty good, even though I've seen them clearance at Fry's Well, so much for all y'all who said it was a flop You know what it took?
7564196	7570382	Price reduction But it was actually considered the best-selling IP of 2009 by Revenue
7572421	7576323	Yeah, the key word is by revenue because they're like a hundred and something dollars each.
7577324	7578065	Way to spin those lyrics.
7578205	7582187	It didn't really start selling until it had a big price drop and then it started selling.
7582247	7587090	Yeah, at least they've figured it out for the next release so they're not going to be charging quite as much.
7587170	7589732	It's going to be a little bit more like Guitar Hero prices.
7590492	7591373	It's still expensive.
7592321	7597243	Well, speaking of Guitar Hero, we actually do have download music for Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero.
7598064	7603546	We have the Queen 2 track pack, which is a crazy little thing called Love, Killer Queen, and Somebody to Love.
7605127	7607288	That's on July, well, it's already out then, July 6th.
7607388	7611090	July 13th, Avenged Sevenfold, Afterlife, Almost Easy, and Scream.
7611110	7615652	July 20th, Disturbed track pack, Down with the Sickness, Stricken, Indestructible, whatever.
7617593	7642323	that's my impression of Disturbed except for the really good cover I thought it was give this guy a lozenge is what it is except they did a really good cover of Land of Confusion really good song and then Shinedown on July 27th with Devour, Second Chance, Sound of Madness all I heard was Queen and everything after that was blah blah blah
7642808	7643409	I know.
7643650	7644431	It's a queen.
7645453	7645774	All right.
7646395	7651363	If that's it for the Rapid Fire News, then I think it might be time for us to get into some Twitter topics.
7654565	7655405	DarkSakura.com
7674193	7675014	I like this one.
7675054	7676615	This has to do with Google.
7676655	7680138	And I had no idea about this until TigerClock kind of linked this.
7680559	7684762	And this has to do with a big investment that Google made in Zynga.
7686118	7700063	Apparently, according to this report, and I'm reading from Gamasutra here, Google quietly invested between $100 million and $200 million in Zynga as part of its preparation to launch Google Games later this year.
7700723	7703104	Because, you know, Google's got to get all up on everything.
7703424	7706326	Whatever happened to Google's philosophy of don't be evil?
7708126	7710567	Google, Zynga, no
7736639	7744682	What's interesting, though, that doesn't necessarily mean you're just going to have Farmville, Frontierville, and Fishville, and What the Fuckville all on Google Games.
7745062	7746223	I love What the Fuckville.
7747203	7747944	Stripperville.
7748004	7749304	Who wouldn't play Stripperville?
7749564	7750265	Hornville.
7751385	7752385	Needs bounce houses.
7752665	7758028	Maybe there will be new games that come onto Google Games.
7758088	7758468	Who knows?
7761397	7768185	If there's anyone that they would want to invest in, you know, better options, I would say, I don't know, Congregate?
7770127	7771349	Much better place, you know.
7771669	7773792	Well, I'm just saying... Much better developers, too.
7774433	7775975	How many freaking people were playing FarmVille?
7776115	7776676	A lot.
7777356	7778538	A lot of people.
7778578	7779879	More than were playing WoW, right?
7780660	7784624	Hate if you want, but it's just like hating on the Wii.
7785005	7786346	You can hate it all you want.
7786747	7789390	At the end of the day, it's still the most popular selling system.
7790331	7791732	That is a fact.
7792053	7795076	Facebook isn't even a gaming system.
7795577	7798260	But more people play games there.
7798780	7799561	That's just how it is.
7815602	7842570	I work with a lot of people that play these games a lot of co-workers but you know they don't really know the video games I play it's just I don't know crazy I'd be very curious to see how this all plays out though with Google games because of the fact that you know Google has this philosophy of don't be evil but then again Buzz was kind of evil they made some horrible missteps with Buzz I wish internet companies would just learn their freaking lesson with privacy don't you
7844073	7845494	One more from Tigerclaw for us.
7846414	7847495	As I want to mention this.
7847575	7848375	Steve Wiebe.
7848915	7849556	You remember him?
7849856	7850636	The King of Kong?
7850676	7851217	Yes, I do.
7851237	7851977	Did he finally get it?
7852657	7855259	Well, no, but he got something else that's pretty cool.
7855739	7858600	He's going to be inducted into the International Video Game Hall of Fame.
7858740	7859141	Cool.
7859521	7863883	And don't forget, it's that doctor or dentist guy, Hank Chien, has it now.
7863943	7864903	It's not even Billy Mitchell.
7864924	7868405	Remember a few months ago we had that doctor or dentist or whatever?
7868505	7869646	He's the King of Kong now.
7870086	7871228	Steve Wiebe, Otumwa, Iowa
7890491	7892193	I can't even pronounce this name.
7892233	7894414	But you may have heard of this city before.
7894474	7897316	This is where they're trying to build the International Video Game Hall of Fame.
7897657	7901479	They want to make this place like the video game capital or whatever.
7902120	7903981	And I don't remember all the stories behind it.
7904001	7907644	But there was like a really famous photo shoot back in the 80s that took place there.
7907664	7908544	I remember hearing about.
7909185	7909966	And I don't know.
7910026	7910186	Just...
7910786	7916250	It's just because no one's claimed it yet, so this town that has nobody, there's no reason to go there.
7916270	7917652	No, there's a story behind it.
7917912	7924397	I'm sure there is, and I don't care what it is, but I refuse to believe that you're going to be the capital of game.
7924497	7925298	A chatter will fill me in.
7925318	7930962	Well, the part I remember was that you can't even reach it unless it's like a three-hour drive from a nearby airport.
7931062	7933144	I mean, that's something else.
7933404	7934445	It's Iowa, folks.
7936099	7939441	Someday I will make claim to that same thing and do it better.
7939921	7942722	Monty Boggs says that's inside the International House of Pancakes.
7943163	7945123	Actually, it's the International House of Gaming.
7946944	7949485	Frisbee asks, isn't that the home of Twin Galaxies?
7950306	7950986	Could be.
7951446	7952527	That might be the connection.
7952567	7953147	I'm not sure.
7953567	7955748	I always thought the guy from Twin Galaxies had an office.
7957089	7959470	I don't know why Pennsylvania jumps out of my mind, but it does.
7960163	7962446	or somewhere in Silicon Valley at least, I don't know.
7963026	7968452	Anyhow, SpongeTwang sends us a tweet clarifying some stuff about the big battle.
7968492	7971836	Apparently the Battlefield Bad Company 2 competition was rescheduled.
7972476	7977001	Also, he has noticed a Super Street Fighter 4 banner has leaked its way into the rotation.
7977041	7980124	So I don't know if Derek just hasn't announced anything yet, but it looks like...
7981005	7983007	Super Street Fighter 4 Super Street Fighter 4 Super Street Fighter 4
8005146	8007767	S21 Under Matt says he thinks it's the hometown of Walter Day.
8007887	8011969	Well, why does that make it the capital of video?
8012189	8012669	Oh, whatever.
8012709	8013670	That's a whole other rant.
8015570	8020672	DarkTetsuyaLastTweet says, Since I didn't hear anything in Part A, thoughts on DDRX2AC?
8022871	8022971	L.E.D.
8023031	8024373	remixed some of the Dance Mania songs
8045672	8049417	That's kind of neat, but I hate to say it, I'm kind of over DDR.
8049977	8053922	Like, I'm more interested in Dance Masters at this point and Dance Central.
8054743	8055824	I know, I know.
8056645	8058027	Give me away, I think I might catch that.
8060329	8063433	DDR just hasn't been interesting for a little while.
8063573	8064034	Sorry!
8064554	8065576	It's kind of how I feel.
8067634	8072675	I played the, um, um, I can't even think of the name of the damn game.
8073595	8075836	The Korean push the screen game.
8075976	8077176	No, push the screen game.
8077616	8079577	DJ Max, Technica, that's it.
8080857	8084178	I played that and that's more interesting to me right now than DDR, sorry.
8085198	8086619	Alright, that's it for Twitter topics.
8086639	8089819	If you want to send us some tweets in the future, twitter.com slash OLR.
8089940	8091760	Meanwhile, back to the news, Loki.
8093294	8096757	Yes, soon you'll be able to get some anime on your Xbox.
8097497	8102121	Apparently Microsoft is teaming up with the video streaming portal Crunchyroll.
8103042	8111049	And apparently the expansion is going to be a partnership with Microsoft for the Zune Marketplace.
8111809	8115772	And this will bring popular anime titles such as The Melancholy of...
8117013	8125356	Haruhi Suzumiya, and Giant Killing to the Xbox 360, Zune HD, and Windows PCs.
8126496	8128737	And that's kind of neat.
8128777	8132138	I guess Giant Killing is notable because it's airing in Japan right now.
8134150	8139375	And this will be the first time these titles have been available for digital download purchase.
8140776	8145880	Interesting, because doesn't the PS3 have a huge anime library with it?
8146361	8149263	I think they do have some anime on there.
8149644	8156650	I could have sworn they tried testing it out with Queen's Blade and then didn't realize it was such an adult-themed anime.
8157330	8158512	I saw that story, too.
8159192	8159953	That's funny.
8161312	8162955	Did this news come out of Anime Expo?
8162995	8170006	Because I know that was a huge thing that just happened this last week, and maybe that's where some of this is coming from, but I don't know.
8171143	8174745	I don't watch a lot of anime, so I feel so apathetic about this.
8175345	8177226	Is there anything you guys in chat?
8177246	8178266	Are you guys excited about this?
8178306	8178786	I'm looking here.
8178826	8184769	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com Ranma says, I don't support bootleg streaming sites.
8186850	8187310	Let's see.
8188451	8189791	I think they're talking about some other stuff.
8189871	8191732	The iPhone apps and all that stuff.
8194835	8199157	Ramakun says all the anime from ADV Films is on Netflix via streaming.
8199798	8201838	That's another way you can get your anime.
8201938	8203779	Well, unless you were talking about Crunchyroll.
8203859	8204520	I don't go there.
8204540	8205340	I wouldn't really know.
8207108	8207408	All right.
8208469	8215255	By the way, not to go too far back into the past, but I always say this wrong, and Drunami will correct me.
8215335	8216716	Kamara in chat?
8216956	8217337	Kamara.
8217457	8223381	Kamara in chat posts this little cut and paste about...
8224162	8225603	Otumwa, Iowa.
8226204	8239614	As the home of Twin Galaxies, so you guys are right, Otumwa was officially proclaimed the video game capital of the world by a mayoral decree issued on November 30th, 1982 by Otumwa Mayor Jerry Parker.
8240114	8245900	As a result of this most unusual distinction, the city was officially recognized and congratulated by U.S.
8246280	8247622	Senator Charles Grassley.
8248042	8254108	In connection with this proclamation, the city hosted the first North American Video Game Olympics in the fall of 1982.
8254368	8260975	That'd be like me standing on my house and saying that this is the laminate flooring capital of the world.
8262316	8272222	Well, you know, this is just a bunch of old fat guys sticking the flag in the ground saying I claim this in the name of Spain.
8272582	8273083	You know what?
8273183	8274363	Do you have a flag?
8274523	8276385	I would like to check the calendar.
8276445	8277745	Is it 1982 still?
8277846	8278386	No, it is not 1982.
8278486	8279847	It is now the year 2010.
8279907	8281268	You know what?
8281328	8284430	This old fat guy, I'm going to make a proclamation right now.
8285660	8291783	I hereby rescind that title from however the fuck you pronounce it, Otumwa, Iowa.
8292244	8295646	I hereby rescind your title.
8296086	8298627	And the Vuvuzelas agree with me in the grand stance.
8298727	8300868	No, no, I make a counter-declaration.
8301008	8301469	Yes, what?
8301969	8305551	I declare this room to be the gaming podcast capital of the world.
8307590	8308371	I second that.
8308591	8315276	I hereby declare Orange Lounge Radio the official video game podcast of the galaxy.
8315997	8316597	Woohoo!
8316778	8317038	See?
8317078	8317518	There it is.
8317598	8318019	It works.
8318839	8319820	Because we're all analysts.
8319880	8323443	Orange Lounge Radio is the official video game podcast of the galaxy.
8323803	8324184	There it is.
8324784	8325064	I agree.
8325304	8326465	Because I've written it in decree.
8326485	8327867	Does somebody have something I can sign?
8328127	8328707	Someone put it.
8329108	8329588	A decree.
8329608	8330429	No, no, no.
8330449	8331229	Write on that paper.
8331389	8331930	Decree.
8332230	8333511	We have it seconded.
8333531	8334332	We have it witnessed.
8334532	8335533	Now put it up on the wiki.
8336073	8365215	and then you're going to put it on the pictures thing on Orange Lounge so everybody knows Orange Lounge Radio is the official video game podcast of the galaxy because if some schmo can do this for his hometown in bumfuck Iowa it's the video game capital of the world then this schmo is going to make his own decrees Iowa is not the capital of anything other than boredom and whatever agriculture they have there
8366457	8366958	and porn.
8366978	8368360	Dan's yelling porn from the living room.
8368961	8369983	I think that's L.A.
8374010	8374331	All right.
8376758	8377258	I know you are.
8377778	8379499	That's why I'm holding up the show here.
8379599	8380599	Live radio, folks.
8380899	8381179	Let's see.
8381559	8382760	This is awesome radio right here.
8382780	8382920	I know.
8382940	8383800	This is awesome radio.
8383820	8384080	Let's see.
8384120	8384900	DarkSakura's writing.
8385140	8385780	Decree.
8386300	8389281	Orange Lounge Radio is the official podcast.
8389641	8391882	She didn't even bother to put video game podcast.
8391902	8392862	She just put podcast.
8393402	8394542	Is the official podcast.
8394582	8395663	Okay, she wrote it in.
8399764	8400324	She can do that.
8400384	8400824	That's fine.
8402632	8407254	This is as legit, if not more legit, than their declaration.
8407294	8407934	I know a notary.
8409055	8410355	Oh, shit.
8411176	8412516	I would get this notarized.
8413216	8415177	Drunami, can you be a notary?
8415997	8416998	No, I mean, I know a real notary.
8417298	8417498	Do you?
8417578	8418518	Can we get this notarized?
8418639	8418999	Probably.
8419119	8419399	Okay.
8420239	8421079	Oh, shit.
8423641	8424621	We need press releases.
8430001	8431503	Someone whip up a press release.
8432264	8434205	It'll be on Kotaku in a few days.
8434225	8440392	This is going to be our official copy, but you know I'm going to have to do a nice designed one with little stars and pink hearts.
8442734	8444295	And a unicorn jumping across it.
8446037	8448059	And if you press a button, it plays always.
8449941	8451342	And then put at the bottom, P.S.
8451463	8453344	We also rescind the claim to...
8455174	8457335	I signed it with my left hand so you know I'm serious.
8459835	8460415	There you go.
8460555	8461296	Do I have to sign that too?
8461316	8461776	Yes, you do.
8461836	8463356	And you have to sign it as Loki.
8464496	8465317	It's official decree.
8465337	8466217	How about Jamie S?
8466637	8467157	There you go.
8467717	8469217	Because they can't get my whole name.
8470998	8473659	SSJ100 Matt says notarize it and frame it in the studio.
8474339	8476179	And then our witness.
8476439	8477720	I have to do a witness thing.
8477740	8478680	And you should just sign with an X.
8481867	8482388	I see how it is.
8482428	8483008	I'm chopped liver.
8483648	8485009	Drew Nami is our official witness.
8487150	8487450	All right.
8488170	8488590	There it is.
8490111	8490411	All right.
8490811	8491231	It's official.
8491271	8493352	Written in silver Sharpie.
8493472	8494092	That's right.
8494232	8496813	Official video game podcast of the galaxy.
8497034	8498234	On torn out notebook paper.
8498594	8498874	Sorry.
8498894	8502996	I apologize to the other hardworking video game podcasters out there.
8503036	8504377	I know you guys do great work.
8504537	8507318	But you just didn't think of it first.
8507438	8510139	Just in the style of Otumwa, whatever, Iowa.
8512669	8513510	We just beat you to it.
8513530	8513970	I'm sorry.
8514770	8526116	We should figure out whether Capital or like, you know, hell, we could like corner the market in waffles or something, you know, the official home of waffle lovers or the, you know.
8526436	8526876	Wait, wait, wait.
8527076	8531939	Amiga777 in chat says, serious guy, tits or get the fuck out.
8532239	8536161	So DarkSakura, if you wouldn't mind, just kiss the paper with your boobs.
8538362	8539542	Just kiss the paper with your boobs.
8539902	8540283	There you go.
8540303	8540543	Thank you.
8541818	8542318	Oh, hi, Dan.
8542518	8543039	How you doing?
8543759	8544099	Oh, shit.
8544659	8545359	Dan just walked in.
8545399	8546480	Hey, how's it going, Dan?
8546580	8547120	Hey, did you hear?
8547140	8550482	I hear Atuma, Iowa used to have a hell of an arcade.
8550682	8554043	You are guesting on the official video game podcast of the galaxy.
8554063	8554743	Of the galaxy.
8554823	8555504	Of the galaxy.
8557684	8560886	And apparently the laminate floor capital of the world.
8561966	8563787	I didn't stand on the house and declare it yet.
8564407	8566248	Our laminate floor is awesome.
8566756	8567597	Awesomely dirty.
8567617	8568078	Alright.
8568118	8570601	Because someone dripped margarita mix in the living room.
8570761	8571482	Get to mopping.
8572704	8573565	You spilled it, dude.
8573625	8574406	With your hair.
8575408	8576108	Bite my butt.
8576169	8581075	The chat room is expressing major concern about Bobby and that we have taken the galaxy away from Bobby.
8581135	8581676	Okay, look.
8581996	8583859	He can have the next galaxy over.
8585160	8587963	Bobby can have... We will give Bobby Pluto.
8588323	8588584	Okay?
8588924	8589925	Bobby can have Pluto.
8590706	8591827	Everybody loves Pluto.
8591907	8592628	Is it a planet?
8592708	8593188	Is it not?
8593228	8593929	We don't know.
8594149	8594770	We don't care.
8594890	8595671	It's yours, Bobby.
8595831	8596431	Have fun with it.
8596472	8598193	He could have, you know, what is it?
8598213	8604199	The official video game radio show of... He can be...
8609378	8614963	If we are the podcast of it, he can have the voice of the galaxy.
8615183	8615483	All right.
8615924	8620048	Monty Boggs says, congratulations to Orange Laundry for jumping the shark with such finesse.
8620328	8620588	I know.
8620848	8622650	We did it with style.
8622790	8627555	This is going to stay at my desk so I can look at it every day and go, what the fuck were we thinking?
8627575	8628175	All right.
8628856	8630658	Back to video game news.
8632443	8634444	I just had the what the hell are we doing moment.
8635865	8638247	Oh, and I didn't even bother to cut it at the perforation.
8638287	8639367	I just pulled it right out of the book.
8639407	8640068	That's ghetto.
8640108	8644050	Tigerclaw says, Sky, for a second I thought you would say Bobby would have Uranus.
8645831	8648073	No, I can think of other podcasts that can have that.
8648413	8648713	All right.
8649694	8650654	Anyhow, let's move on.
8652275	8654937	I want to talk about, back to gaming news, I know, hard to believe.
8655277	8656038	Let's talk about this.
8656078	8658019	This has to do with Connectimals.
8658766	8659887	Burger King Burger King Burger King
8678904	8687393	So you're going to actually get little stuffed animals that can be scanned by the Kinect's camera to create the same animal in the game.
8687854	8691538	And then you can have them interact with your regular pet Kinectimal.
8692139	8692900	And there you go.
8693941	8699385	So instead of the BK games we were hearing about, now you're going to get little mini-Connectimals or whatever.
8699566	8706732	The problem is, it's just going to be a little card that will easily be scanned and posted on the internet, so you don't even have to buy these.
8707512	8712417	If they were smart, since the Kinect can scan in objects, they should actually do the stuffed animal.
8712717	8714979	Like, you'd have to actually have a picture of the stuffed animal.
8717133	8721137	Well, I mean, how long is it going to be though before there's just an internet page with all the barcodes?
8722759	8727243	So after you stuff your face with a triple whopper, you can go and move around a little bit on Kinect.
8727472	8728853	That's what I love about this.
8728973	8734657	I mean, at least it's Connectimals and not Dance Central, but that would crack me up if Dance Central had a tie-in with Burger King.
8734857	8739180	This was like the old barcode scanner games that were out in Japan, remember?
8739700	8747886	It was like one particular brand of ramen would make this ultimate monster, and everyone was buying out this one brand of ramen.
8749216	8769081	E-Reader for life they did the same thing with Viva Pinata and in fact people started hacking the actual codes and unlocked more animals they didn't give away stuff that wasn't in the game or at least it was in the game but never released for the game
8771044	8774268	Interesting though, Microsoft is very aggressive with the marketing for this thing.
8774308	8776350	They really, really want it to take off.
8776590	8781636	I mean, Burger King, Macy's, and, you know, in their own stores.
8782056	8785460	Whereas, you know, where's PlayStation Move advertising?
8787810	8788390	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8818214	8833293	appreciate that oh all our plushies alright so now you know what's official you're listening to the official video game podcast of the galaxy well Rock Band 3 has decided to do something nice for all those people who can't hold a tune to save their fucking life um
8835305	8844567	It, um, has, uh, harmonics and, uh, isotope, um, have, uh, done a real-time pitch correction.
8844587	8845647	Basically, they have autotune.
8846707	8853608	Um, it's gonna put everybody into the right key when it plays through so that they don't sound like crap.
8853728	8861629	Now, what I want to do, I have this one friend who, I actually have a couple friends who are intensely tone-deaf enough that it makes my, um, my liver quiver.
8862710	8862830	Um.
8863210	8863870	That rhymed.
8864210	8864490	I know.
8866110	8873472	But I would like to see if I actually can make these people who are so unbelievably tone deaf hold a key.
8874692	8877093	I don't know if anyone knows this little fact about me.
8877733	8883895	I hear perfect pitch and it drives me completely nuts because it's even worse when I sing and hear myself go out of tune.
8885956	8894038	Listening to somebody else go, just not being able to hold a tune makes me nauseous, literally nauseous.
8895796	8896196	Outro Music
8921738	8928684	Plus, I think if you want to get really into the science of it and all, autotune is like a post-production thing, and this is a in-production thing.
8928724	8931787	Basically, they're available in almost any recording studio.
8933228	8935530	I mean, how come do you think some people just sound like crap live?
8936511	8939093	It's a bummer, though, you're not going to be able to hear the voices over the internet.
8939133	8943557	I mean, at the same time, maybe that's a blessing, but I think there's some people that wouldn't mind, you know, being able to sing.
8944077	8947320	I understand that with the lag and the time and everything, it's probably not possible, but...
8947836	8952680	Although, what would be wrong with maybe having the singer start five seconds before the rest of the band?
8952980	8956082	I guess maybe with the scoring system it wouldn't really work out.
8956462	8958544	I really, though... Have the voice play on a replay.
8960005	8960245	Maybe.
8960706	8964829	I really, though... I think it would be nice if this was an option that you could turn off.
8965649	8970653	But certainly, you know, I think that the option to turn it on should be on the other player's side.
8971153	8972334	If you're doing this on the internet.
8973155	8976217	For people like me, who can't stand to listen to people be out of tune.
8976963	8977303	I don't know.
8998145	9012667	although you can always just do party chat and do it that way but you know true you know one little bit will be delayed it's it's because I've played rock band with a singer who didn't put their mic their regular mic on mute and it was delayed and it actually can really throw you off when you're trying to play guitar or something else
9014349	9028583	One thing I had predicted for Rock Band 3 that didn't end up happening, or at least not yet anyway, was that they were going to go more the SingStar route of being able to share your performances and being able to have that community of your YouTube-esque sharing of performances.
9028623	9028984	Who knows?
9029024	9031807	Maybe that's still in the cards for the future, although I kind of doubt it at this point.
9032888	9035030	This would have kind of added to that, though, in a way.
9035650	9037252	A little more professional touch to it.
9037332	9037913	Thank you for watching!
9054393	9056534	Maybe like once, like a rock band thing.
9057154	9059595	She's got a crazy powerful voice.
9059615	9061296	She's a little more classically trained, right?
9061956	9062456	I can't remember.
9062816	9066298	She does tend to edge more towards the classically trained, but she can belt them out.
9066358	9068199	She can really sing.
9068219	9069039	She's got a great voice.
9070339	9076982	I like having things at the lower level when she's playing because then it won't make her fail the song for having fun with it.
9077162	9078124	I can sing Madonna.
9078204	9079947	Just ask the listeners of Understation Live.
9080087	9084115	No, I can't believe that you and Tiara got me singing Abba Rock Band.
9084836	9085576	Oh, that was fun.
9086097	9087557	Is Tiara listening?
9088298	9088998	I don't think so.
9089018	9094600	Tiara, Tiara, Tiara, come back to Sacramento because we need to make Jamie play ABBA.
9095101	9096261	It's not ABBA Rock Band, by the way.
9096281	9096862	It's SingStar ABBA.
9096982	9097682	That's what I was talking about.
9097702	9098542	SingStar ABBA.
9099323	9100903	I just can't believe that I actually did good at it.
9101604	9102064	It's fun.
9103204	9105746	I need to get SingStar Queen now that it's discounted.
9105766	9106326	I would play that.
9107466	9108127	But you're right.
9108207	9111048	Expert doesn't give a lot of leeway for stuff like, I don't know, Vibrato.
9112071	9112271	No.
9112991	9115793	But you know, remember when Karaoke Revolution was coming out?
9116133	9116333	Mm-hmm.
9116593	9118714	And how it was pretty forgiving here?
9119295	9124377	The Japanese versions, because I've had friends who had the Japanese versions, they are evil.
9125438	9133161	You have to pronounce everything perfectly, you have to be dead pitch on, you can't just mumble your way through it, and as long as you hit the key, you're fine.
9133181	9135042	You actually have to fully pronounce everything right.
9135743	9138104	Because Japanese itself can be pretty precise.
9138124	9138344	Right.
9138704	9142087	I played that terrible Karaoke Revolution Glee game that was at E3.
9142287	9143348	It was very forgiving.
9143428	9148572	Granted, I was playing it on the easiest level, but you could just get your way through it and probably pass it.
9148872	9157779	See, that's one thing that I was thinking about with the different games from area to area where you have... Because I'd have to say Japanese is a very precise language.
9158479	9158759	Really?
9159840	9174672	English, especially American English, I'm sorry, is just... Well, English all over the place has so many variables that I really think that even the harder difficulties of them should have more of an allowance.
9175353	9177955	I am really curious to see how this new vocal system plays out, though.
9177975	9180217	I'm really interested, too, because I know I'm probably going to get it.
9180597	9180878	Yeah, I know.
9180898	9181638	I've got to get Rock Band.
9181758	9182379	Rock Band's awesome.
9183534	9187036	Alright, couple more stories for you guys in the mailbag in the FUs of the week.
9187396	9188456	And then the Skype line.
9188757	9192478	Your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR in a little bit here on Orange Lounge Radio.
9192538	9193919	But first, some news from Loki.
9195030	9201892	Yes, Dead Rising 2, they've announced a special edition for Europe called the Outbreak Pack.
9202592	9206234	And with it, you're going to be getting some pretty cool tchotchkes, actually.
9206294	9217277	It looks like a zombie figurine, a surfboard head, which I'm only assuming goes on the zombie, and a cone, which also can go on the head of the zombie, I'm assuming.
9218397	9228560	and looks like a voucher for a premium theme and some other console specific items as well.
9229140	9231740	I do love the little serve bot head for the zombie.
9231760	9232921	That's pretty awesome.
9233001	9234621	It is pretty awesome.
9235281	9237882	Corsi announced that this is not coming out over here.
9238322	9260487	of course not at all thankfully though we do have something coming out over here and this hasn't really been announced yet but I do know what's actually in the special edition it's not that exciting actually it's kind of standard special edition fair a lot of Zombrex themed stuff you know Zombrex being the actual I don't know if it's the virus or the
9261347	9262287	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9278435	9304026	also you get an avatar item for the Xbox 360 version and a premium dynamic theme for the Playstation 3 version behind the scenes documentary of the making of Dead Rising 2 and then of course the whole thing comes in a steelbook case that slips on the actual game so that'll be coming out at the end of September now for $79.99
9306957	9308000	That's a lot of money for a game.
9309324	9311229	I guess you get all that other cool stuff with it, but still.
9312023	9315004	I liked Dead Rising 1, but I really didn't play enough of it.
9315024	9318206	It's one of those games I really need to go back and revisit because it's pretty cool.
9318606	9321227	Dead Rising 2 is kind of more of the same, but not in a bad way.
9322688	9324909	Crackdown 2, people are making it sound like more of the same.
9324949	9327030	It's kind of a bad thing, but I had a lot of fun with Dead Rising 2.
9327090	9335373	I'm surprised they didn't put Dead Rising theme duct tape or something like that in there because the main part of the game is actually creating objects.
9335513	9336114	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
9337074	9341297	I think I saw what I see, a baseball bat get duct taped with nails on the demo I played.
9341497	9341877	Pretty cool.
9343178	9352723	Okay, I want to talk about this that was floating around some of the blogs this week and it made designer Ben Marsh a little bit famous this week because these aren't real, okay guys?
9353063	9357126	But he put out some designs there for video game condoms.
9357686	9362449	That's right, it's video game packaging themed condoms for...
9362609	9367454	All these lovely little video game themed... And I love this.
9367514	9370797	There's like little variety packs there they have.
9383468	9394370	But kind of a serious theme here to this because he says here, the packaging aims to create a desire to purchase the product for aesthetic reasons rather than the necessity of condoms.
9394830	9398631	Simply by owning the product, safer sex is promoted.
9400952	9401852	Interesting.
9403152	9404772	Does anyone have a feeling on this?
9404812	9406293	Do you think this would promote safe sex?
9406313	9412434	Because people buy it for the joke of it, but then like, you know, if the time comes where it's time to go a-rockin', hey, you're prepared.
9416400	9420684	It would never fly in the first place because the game companies would never let this be put out.
9420704	9427069	But assuming that he was able to create a generic enough concept, I suppose people might buy that.
9429488	9434730	But at the same time, you know, you don't see a lot of gaming related stuff to sex selling.
9434890	9442293	I mean, you don't see a lot of people buying, you know, the fake vaginas for those, you know, sex games that they have in Japan.
9442633	9443693	You don't see people storing those.
9443713	9444154	Hey, look at that.
9444174	9444834	That's from a game.
9445714	9446655	People look at you funny.
9447795	9453779	As people would look at you funny if you had a box for Donkey Shalong on your... Or Bone Zone 2.
9453979	9456120	Bone Zone 2, yeah.
9457161	9463404	They'd be fun gag gifts for people, but... It would never make it past the stigma that gamers don't get laid.
9463784	9469047	Yeah, that whole gag gift thing, I could see myself getting like eight boxes of these for my birthday, and it would be like...
9473502	9474863	It was funny the first time.
9474883	9476144	Seven of them would be from Loki.
9476745	9477085	No.
9478686	9479467	You know what I mean, though.
9481148	9483890	Sometimes with gag gifs, if there's a certain one that speaks to you.
9484250	9484891	Like, I'll tell you this.
9485231	9489254	One time for Christmas, I kid you not, I got the Survivor board game three times.
9491736	9492137	Sure did.
9492417	9493017	The hell?
9493278	9495419	Got the Survivor board game three times one Christmas.
9495739	9498582	The first year, Survivor was big, and everyone knew I watched it every week.
9500740	9507086	so alright how about we get to another segment here on the show called the mailbag yay
9510382	9535086	every week you guys send us your emails mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura dives in head first and picks a few of her favorites and reads them for you here on the show she's back to doing the mailbag this week I do hooray next week I get to do it drugged yay so definitely send her lots of emails for next week mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com by the way I want to say real quick Akuma JP says he's actually seen these in Akihabara Akihabara?
9535286	9536027	I'm sorry did I say that wrong?
9536707	9538287	Akihabara yeah you said it about right
9538507	9541175	Okay, that big tech store in Japan.
9542037	9545567	It's a section of... It's a district.
9546068	9546670	Oh, okay.
9547845	9551526	Anyway, hey OLR crew, AZHP here.
9551706	9556527	I'm sure Rob has got this on show roll, but I had to throw my two cents in for what it's worth.
9556947	9559568	Blizzard is going to use Real ID for their forums now.
9560028	9563069	Yeah, we already bypassed that, but here's... I'm going to continue.
9563389	9564169	Here's a quote from Blizzard.
9564509	9575332	Removing the veil of anonymity, typical to online dialogue, will contribute to a more positive forum environment, promote constructive conversations, and connect the Blizzard community in ways they haven't been connected before.
9575852	9576093	Really?
9576173	9578958	Do they think that flamers will stop just because their name is being shown?
9579279	9580901	Belligerent people will still be belligerent.
9581382	9586171	Only now they'll know just who they are arguing with and can go to their house and stab them if they don't agree.
9587293	9594736	Anyway, I thought the point of WoW was that you could get away from your real life, not have it follow you around and haunt your every move in WoW.
9595896	9603618	What if I don't want my coworkers knowing that I post on the WoW forums while I'm supposed to be on the clock, not that I do, I don't even play WoW.
9604039	9610821	This is just ridiculous, and I have a feeling that this move is going to be one of the worst Blizzard has ever made.
9611241	9613142	Just wondering what you guys think about this travesty.
9613262	9614902	I hope it all goes away soon.
9614983	9616003	Yours truly is HP.
9616423	9618484	Written and sent while I'm supposed to be on the clock.
9618604	9618944	P.S.
9619344	9622025	This will make DarkSakura laugh or cry, I'm not sure which.
9622365	9625126	Basically the biggest travesty in superhero mashups ever.
9625447	9626967	Make sure she sees this on the show.
9634426	9639710	It's a toy box of bootleg superheroes.
9639770	9648917	Superheroes Justice League with Spider-Man, Batman, Naruto, and Iron Man.
9649097	9651179	Malfunction does not compute.
9652700	9655922	By the way, I have to commend you on your mostly perfect grammar and spelling.
9656002	9657563	Actually, your spelling was pretty good.
9657583	9660245	You've missed a couple of punctuation points.
9660385	9663668	I think everybody can agree that Naruto is the greatest superhero ever known.
9665485	9666735	Can I find something in your throat, Loki?
9667273	9667793	Where's the Tribble?
9668514	9668934	Throw the Tribble.
9669054	9671595	I prefer Goddamn Batman on Twitter, actually.
9671615	9677498	I don't know if you've ever seen Goddamn Batman, and then there's Gosh Dang Robin or something like that.
9677618	9678699	You said Goddamn Batman.
9678739	9680760	There's Goddamn Batman and Gosh Dang Robin.
9681640	9682901	We can't forget the Juggernaut, bitch.
9683641	9684121	All right, anyhow.
9684982	9694507	Obviously, we already kind of ran it about Real ID early in the show, but thankfully, AZHP, that part I think that you were really concerned about did go away, but it hasn't all gone away.
9694587	9695167	Let's not forget.
9695601	9698681	I'm still gleefully looking at the decree in shiny silver.
9700151	9703513	How does it feel to be on the official video game podcast of the galaxy?
9703653	9704214	Hell yeah.
9704614	9705995	Anyway, next up.
9707236	9709197	It's labeled Choose Your Words Carefully.
9709838	9722146	In this article on IGN UK, Sony's Shuhei Yoshida claims, This year is the first time we are able to cover the cost of the PlayStation 3, he told IGN.
9722526	9726109	We aren't making huge money from hardware, but we aren't bleeding like we used to.
9726909	9733496	I believe he is telling the truth, but it says the PS3 is sold at profit, not that the PS3 program is profitable.
9734497	9737200	I expect this will take another 8-10 years, if at all.
9737820	9741684	It's just that now each console digs them a little bit out of the debt hole.
9742985	9746669	I've also got more questions slash complaints about the EA Game Pass thing.
9747109	9751773	Since I'm typically not an online gamer, shouldn't I get a refund of $10 on that new EA game?
9752214	9758039	I mean, if they allowed me to turn in the code for rebate, it would make the entire thing a lot more reasonable.
9758179	9765786	In theory, if the code is still unused, the game should be worth $10 more on resale, but how do you prove it is still good?
9766446	9769907	and I bet the initial pack-in codes will be deleted after year two.
9770287	9773387	There's really a lot more screwing of the customer than is obvious.
9773787	9775168	Hope you have a happy Independence Day.
9775428	9781729	You know, also, if this can actually be considered part of precedence, well, you probably could actually get away with it.
9782369	9791771	My laptop, for example, if I had never booted Windows on it and installed Linux, I could have gotten a refund from Dell for $200 and my laptop was $350.
9791831	9791971	Oh, wow.
9794493	9808736	As long as you never load Windows on them, and prove that you have never loaded Windows on it, that you basically launched right into Linux or something, then you get your money back.
9809036	9820218	It's a bummer that the resellers don't have some type of application to see if the code has been run or not, but then again, probably the whole point of this is to really circumvent the resellers, even though GameStop's supposedly on board.
9821573	9830060	Yeah, but then someone malicious could get that code verifier and start typing in random codes to see if there's one that has been used or not used.
9830140	9832802	It'll give you invalid or unused code.
9832862	9834864	And they're like, oh, hey, look, Frisa.
9836445	9840608	Just so you guys know here in studio, apparently Winamp has frozen and the stream has died.
9840708	9841529	Yay!
9841649	9843450	So we got to come right back up here.
9843931	9847714	So we're going to hope that the rest of the computer doesn't shut down here.
9848394	9849896	But we're going to try and keep going here.
9850356	9852118	Don't read the next email just yet, DarkSakura.
9852519	9853860	Somebody needs to stretch for time.
9854521	9855802	I want someone to go get me some pie.
9855822	9858465	Tell the podcast listeners something special while we try to go back up.
9858586	9859466	Something special?
9859687	9860708	My boobs are amazing.
9862563	9863503	Also, my feet are dirty.
9864103	9865144	See, look how dirty my feet are.
9866064	9866904	My feet are pretty dirty.
9867124	9868965	We should be back up on all games now.
9869085	9869505	There we go.
9870025	9874507	I don't know why the stream just decided to... I'm a dirty girl.
9874687	9875047	I know you are.
9875647	9877508	You should have heard what DarkSakura told us when we were down.
9877528	9877928	No, I'm just kidding.
9878508	9880809	I don't know why the stream just decided to drop.
9880829	9883829	Well, I do know why because Winamp froze.
9884050	9885510	And I don't know why Winamp froze.
9885630	9886390	That was strange.
9886830	9887491	Winamp fail.
9887871	9888371	Llama fail.
9888971	9889791	Yeah, apparently.
9889811	9890572	It had brain freeze.
9890952	9891272	Lord.
9891953	9892933	Can I do the next email now?
9893433	9893814	We're back.
9893874	9895574	Yes, you can go on to the next email now that we're back.
9895775	9896835	This is from Troy.
9897355	9900937	I don't know if it's the same person I work with, so I'm not going to make an assumption.
9901798	9904079	Whoa, your guys' podcast is freaking awesome.
9904199	9904939	I'm a new listener.
9905119	9909582	I have listened to the last two episodes so far, and I can say that you guys are great podcasters.
9909922	9911362	A couple things I wanted to ask.
9911563	9915625	First of all, I would like to know how you came up with the name Orange Dungeons Radio for this video game podcast.
9916665	9917827	Rewind Short Story
9939298	9939959	Ninja's Sisterhood
9959409	9960310	Oh yeah, that's true.
9960370	9961131	There's them too.
9961331	9962012	Electric Sisterhood.
9962032	9963153	Why is it Ninja?
9963173	9964394	Because Ninja Sister is the host.
9965355	9966837	Co-host, whatever their deal is.
9967137	9967838	So I guess there's a few.
9967878	9971321	But yeah, Orange Lounge doesn't really make most people think video games.
9971882	9973103	You want to tell a story or me?
9974104	9974564	Quick thing.
9974604	9976266	We were a Bimani podcast to start off.
9976406	9977667	We named it after a Bimani band.
9978208	9978788	Orange Lounge.
9979209	9979870	Orange Lounge Radio.
9980190	9980530	The end.
9981171	9981711	While on the Bart.
9983032	9992756	Although the name Orange Lounge stuck because we wanted to kind of evoke that image of we're lounging around talking about games because the whole idea... It's our brand.
9992856	9996097	Yeah, it's kind of like we used to go to this restaurant called Brookfield's.
9996177	9997638	It was right in the parking lot of Rosen's Golf Lab.
9997658	9998438	The old people restaurant.
9998478	9998658	Yeah.
9998938	9999498	Oh, God, I miss that.
9999538	10003240	After a long night of gaming, we'd just sit around and talk shit about games, and that's what we wanted our show to be.
10003480	10005041	And Rick would always order his Merlot.
10006541	10008702	I always remembered that Rick would always order his Merlot.
10009184	10010645	and those cheese sticks were awesome.
10011026	10011526	They were.
10011686	10012147	They were amazing.
10012167	10012727	They were amazing.
10012887	10013528	Okay, so there you go.
10013548	10014589	That's where Orange Lounge Radio came from.
10014969	10015369	Bomani.
10015449	10016650	Traces back to the DDR games.
10017311	10021214	Second, do you guys have any games to recommend for Xbox PS3?
10022735	10025197	Singularity recently came out and it looked cool.
10025278	10026198	Any thoughts on that game?
10026358	10026619	Thanks.
10026679	10027459	Love your podcast.
10027579	10027900	Troy.
10028615	10030556	I've not played Singularity myself.
10030977	10036320	What I've heard around The Great Vine is that it's not so great, but I haven't played it myself, so I couldn't tell you.
10036740	10037561	Got good reviews.
10038482	10039582	We got mixed reviews, I guess.
10039602	10045706	I know Game Informer gave it an 8.5 out of 10, if that makes any difference to you.
10046087	10052291	Just check Metacritic if you want to get a good benchmark where the game is.
10054172	10057434	Red Dead Redemption, Crackdown 2 if that's your sort of thing.
10058155	10059596	There's a lot of sports games coming out.
10059616	10060516	I think Blur was underrated.
10060536	10062097	It really helps.
10062317	10067881	Just a future reference to our players, let us know what type of games you're into before you ask us what to suggest.
10067981	10074526	I know me in particular, I'm probably the most niche person in this room.
10074766	10078888	I like playing games where you take pictures of magical girls.
10079929	10081550	I'm just thinking about my Cardcaptor Sakura game.
10082991	10087054	You know, I'm playing, you know, I've been playing some World of Goo.
10087874	10089515	I like my titles weird.
10090616	10095459	Like, I loved, oh shit, what's the name of that game with that yellow blob?
10097820	10099261	Why can't I remember the name of that game, Rob?
10099961	10100462	I don't know why.
10100842	10103323	Because I have the... LocoRoco.
10103363	10104224	LocoRoco, thank you.
10105892	10106813	I love LocoRoco.
10107613	10109394	I like all kinds of weirdness in my games.
10110015	10110855	I am the niche girl.
10110975	10112656	Yeah, we have to know what kind of games you like to really deal with that.
10112676	10114517	You should have heard her when Katamari Damacy came out.
10115238	10116459	I was ready to pee.
10118220	10119200	It was the most awesome thing.
10119240	10120281	I could barely contain myself.
10120720	10127084	Well, I don't own either system, but I'm a fan of the series, so I would actually recommend Tales of Vesperia.
10127925	10130266	If you can find it, rumor has it they only did one printing.
10130847	10132428	Here's my suggestion for our listener.
10132468	10142694	If you really are new to these consoles, like I don't know if you're new to these or you've had these for a while, go back to the bargain bin and try to find some games you missed, because I bet there's a lot of shit out there that you've missed.
10142995	10144215	Like, I'll give you case in point.
10144556	10146457	Team Fortress 2, for myself.
10147037	10149658	Somehow missed that game just after, you know, how long has it been now?
10149678	10151619	About three years now?
10151659	10151939	Two years.
10151979	10152460	Two and a half years?
10152920	10155621	Yeah, just totally missed that game somehow, but I'm just now getting into it.
10156021	10158142	You can get the game on eBay, by the way, for $30.
10161043	10161303	All right.
10161404	10162404	Just to let Drew know.
10163284	10165165	But thank you for the email, and we love having new listeners.
10165886	10166346	Spread the word!
10168647	10170988	Okay, next and final email.
10172268	10173489	This comes from Damani.
10174727	10178491	Hey OLR, I was just wondering, do you guys play any board games?
10179272	10182094	I never did until we bought Catan, I guess that's Settlers of Catan.
10182975	10186499	It's so fun and has all these expansion packs to make it never get old.
10187320	10191184	And that's all I can think about except how awesome Gliding and Crackdown 2 are.
10192525	10193386	Please spell properly.
10193826	10194407	Agent Wiggles
10212066	10228602	Agent Wiggles, that's amazing I have been known to like board games I was always a big fan of Life I really like this question by the way This is a really good question Out of the many random questions we get I think this is a neat question So board games that you like Um
10229182	10230263	I was always good at Rummy and Spades.
10251044	10251904	Those were always my games.
10252064	10255145	As far as board game goes, I was always a fan of Clue growing up.
10255165	10255265	Clue!
10255285	10257346	And Clue Master Detective especially.
10257426	10259667	And then of course I love the movie and all that stuff.
10259987	10260767	So I like the classics.
10261247	10267189	I could never get into like Axis and Allies and the really complex board game shit too many pieces.
10267309	10268169	I did play Risk.
10269610	10271350	As a small child, I played Risk.
10272450	10275291	And I think that's probably why I don't like strategy games now.
10275992	10277332	Because of all the Risk I played as a kid.
10279248	10280429	and I love Taboo.
10281490	10283872	I mean, it's not really so much of a board game.
10283972	10286674	I love Trivial Pursuits, the Genesis Edition ones.
10287815	10289496	The harder they are, the better I like them.
10291285	10296328	It's hard because there's really two categories of board games.
10296368	10300310	There's like your Hasbro, Target, Walmart board games.
10300790	10310215	And then there's your like fucking millions of pieces, hardcore, we don't fuck around board games, like imported from foreign countries and all that.
10310315	10310495	Like...
10311375	10330568	and it's kind they're two totally different worlds and so it's hard to know which type of those games you're into I hate Monopoly I think Monopoly is really overrated too because if you're gonna play Monopoly don't make any fucking plans if you're gonna play an entire game of Monopoly and be prepared to hate everybody else
10331115	10331976	I still like Trivial Pursuit.
10350948	10351889	I love Trivial Pursuits.
10352029	10354030	My old roommate and I were going to have a board game night.
10354050	10355190	We never did get around to doing it.
10355250	10357931	I would totally be in on a board game night if we wanted to start one.
10358071	10358952	Can't do it at my place.
10359552	10365335	I should talk to my friend who owns a house in the south area and see if he would want to do something like that.
10365635	10371378	The last actual board game I played was electronic assisted board game, The Omega Virus.
10371418	10372238	Does anyone remember that?
10372658	10373639	I think so.
10374139	10375900	I was like early 90s.
10376240	10379162	That's in that same family of games like the mall game.
10379182	10382384	But I mean it's not the same type, but you know what I mean.
10382584	10383925	Yeah, it was kind of like mall madness.
10384125	10387907	When you say electronic assisted board game, I think of electronic battleship.
10388488	10389809	I used to have electronic battleship.
10389829	10390449	That game was fucking rad.
10390469	10391229	You know which one I loved?
10391429	10392790	You know which game I loved for a board game?
10393231	10393731	Mousetrap.
10394685	10396627	Yes, except it never worked.
10397447	10398248	It never worked.
10398488	10399930	If you tweak parts of them, they don't work.
10400130	10402392	Serzo in our chatroom says, how about strip poker?
10402732	10404213	How about munchkin?
10404233	10404994	That's a classic.
10405094	10407036	I like playing... What about munchkin?
10407196	10407736	Catan.
10408417	10409398	Catan's pretty fun.
10410498	10415302	Your traditional stuff, we'll play the Game of Life now than Scrabble.
10415883	10419846	One game, though, I did play with one of my friends a while back, and it was actually a lot of fun.
10419866	10421247	We really need to play it again.
10421848	10422829	Cthulhu Rising.
10423536	10424677	I've heard that's good.
10424837	10425638	It's awesome.
10425798	10429701	It's you versus, it's basically everybody playing together as a team.
10430741	10434504	Although we need to cheat the next time we play because it was really fucking hard.
10434784	10438547	Cthulhu kicked our ass as Cthulhu usually does.
10439528	10441009	It reminds me of a joke I heard.
10441249	10441689	Sorry about that.
10441729	10442470	Someone sent me a link.
10442510	10443511	I didn't know a video would be on it.
10443651	10443951	My bad.
10445112	10447473	How many Cthulhu investigators does Take Change Lightbulb?
10448454	10448814	All of them.
10449034	10449974	You never split the party.
10449994	10453415	See, now Scherzo's yelling out all those junior high school games.
10453515	10457836	Spin the Bottle, Two Minutes in the Closet, Truth or Dare.
10457916	10460377	We're really sticking to board games, okay?
10462278	10466099	We used to, though, when we would play Monopoly, we would steal the pieces from Clue.
10466919	10471360	So you could be the lead pipe, or the dagger, or the revolver.
10472740	10473360	That was always fun.
10473380	10475121	We used to always fight over who got to be the car.
10476348	10477589	I never wanted to be the car.
10477649	10480531	I wanted to be the boot so I could kick everyone's ass.
10482933	10485015	This was my logic as a 10-year-old.
10485055	10486817	This explains so much about Jamie.
10489138	10490239	I don't see what the problem is.
10490299	10492981	And then I don't have to argue with everybody over who gets the damn car.
10493082	10494303	It's pewter.
10495023	10495684	It's pewter.
10496860	10497961	You know, hold on.
10498101	10506147	I'll go and get one of my ex's Warhammer figures and I will be the orc with the tank.
10506467	10507208	Here we go.
10507508	10510530	Dude, Cthulhu Rising needs to be an Xbox Live Arcade game.
10511391	10512412	That would be awesome.
10513752	10514072	All right.
10514593	10517355	Do we have any other emails this week to read?
10517635	10518416	We do not.
10518796	10519116	All right.
10519457	10523700	You guys should send us emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
10524300	10533508	In the meantime, it is time for us to get out a little bit of the angst that happens to be in our system tonight, and it's a little segment we call the FUs of the Week.
10549119	10550400	Mine is multifaceted.
10551321	10552102	Ooh, big words.
10553123	10554904	Faceted is not a big word, Rob.
10555064	10556566	Alright, it's a little word with a big meaning.
10556586	10557406	Do you know what a facet is?
10557767	10559688	It's something you put on the kitchen sink, right?
10561670	10562331	Where's the treble?
10564312	10564633	Rob?
10566715	10567435	Ooh, it vibrates.
10567475	10570138	Let's put that in my special place.
10570178	10573200	Rob's got a big hairy ball in his crotch now.
10573921	10574682	What else is new?
10576730	10577631	Anyone got a weed whacker?
10578511	10578851	Lord.
10579852	10580993	Anyway, anyway.
10583154	10589078	It's more of a situational thing, not directly to anyone in particular, just the whole having to wait for my surgery thing really blows.
10589558	10599245	But I do want to thank my surgeon for basically fitting me in on one of his on-call days to get me in so that I can still legitimately claim my FMLA.
10603137	10620093	Family Medical Leave Act Also F you to the company that purchased mine for basically I know you're going to outsource all the servicing to India so I really hope that you go to hell for
10623022	10628344	I know, logically, I try to separate what I logically know from what I emotionally feel, you know?
10629264	10630605	Logically, it's business.
10631325	10634486	We were the number one servicer, they were the number two servicer.
10634906	10636307	They had the money to buy us.
10637207	10639288	They bought us, now they have no competition.
10639928	10644910	But still, when you look at people who you've been with, you know, for...
10647064	10650165	Some of these people, I've worked with the entire time I've been with the company for 10 years.
10650926	10654647	And it's just sort of like, wow, that's a big chapter closing.
10654867	10662771	So I'm not really necessarily going to say an F you to Auckland, because even though they are shitty and not keeping jobs in America, pretty much.
10664231	10685594	which I have a big issue with I do want to say that it really sucks for all the people who actually enjoyed working there who I've known for ages and I just wish everybody the best all my co-workers for those who are listening to the show and no I won't tell you what department I was in Loki
10686772	10696237	A big ol' fuck you to Julie Mayo of Roseville, California and Martin Jennings of Roseville, California for wasting three weeks of my time.
10697078	10705062	May you never get any money from any of your litigations and, for the love of God, take some goddamn responsibility for your firing.
10705462	10710405	You are a horrible employee, you don't get along with people, and you wonder why you got fired.
10711866	10713246	Maybe because you're a fucking idiot.
10713607	10714067	The end.
10714187	10714667	Allegedly.
10714847	10716168	He's been sitting on this one.
10717824	10718284	Thanks for watching!
10735254	10736315	My FUs of the week.
10737515	10742619	Some folks think I'm going to FU the World Cup because I'm Dutch in heritage, but I'm not that upset about it.
10743139	10744019	My last name's Dutch.
10744139	10744820	It's just soccer.
10746601	10747041	Let's see.
10747481	10748522	Remember, we're in the U.S.
10748582	10750443	We don't get as riled up as other places do.
10750743	10751544	We're also gamers.
10751564	10752945	We don't really care about sports.
10753225	10755146	I'm going to give my weekly FU to Real ID.
10755686	10756487	God damn you.
10756907	10760209	FU to the fucking Vuvuzela app that Jamie has.
10760249	10761350	That thing can burn in hell.
10762290	10763912	Stop giggling like three-year-olds.
10764433	10770561	This is why the Nintendo DS and PSP are far superior to the Apple iPhone.
10772183	10772984	No app like that.
10773024	10773285	Yet.
10773305	10775267	You can't even say it.
10777869	10781792	Sounds like an animal that roams the jungle.
10782132	10783373	Alright, let's see.
10783393	10788496	I want to give an F you to Owie Phantom Side Pains I've been having lately.
10788516	10789197	That's no fun.
10789457	10791098	Hopefully it's not as bad as what I had before.
10791138	10791578	That would suck.
10792659	10801244	And then F you to the fact that I'm probably finally getting rid of my car that I've had longer than I've been doing this show this week.
10801465	10801925	Yay!
10802503	10803363	Yay!
10803423	10804404	It hasn't happened yet.
10804464	10805124	Don't cheer yet.
10805144	10805824	It hasn't happened yet.
10806725	10807285	You know what?
10807965	10812127	I'm a frugal person, and if I want to drive my car into the ground, I have every right.
10812207	10814908	And I have driven that thing into the ground.
10814948	10815428	Sell it.
10815448	10816088	Who's going to buy it?
10816388	10821010	I will play this the entire... It's that goddamn fucking horn.
10821030	10822531	I will delete this off of my phone.
10822871	10825452	I'm going to hold you to that.
10825672	10827172	Do they even have the spit noises?
10827212	10827773	That's great.
10828113	10830834	And then she'll get a bee app that makes the same noise.
10831670	10832012	Drew.
10834173	10835294	F you to the heat.
10836414	10838496	It's been screwing with my computer.
10839236	10840717	It's been screwing with the AC.
10841737	10844459	And I think it may have been screwing with the fridge in my house.
10844579	10847421	Big F you to my fridge, which finally died.
10848181	10860328	We had to go out to a storage container in the middle of the day on a 102 fucking degree day to get the fridge, get into a U-Haul.
10860588	10862209	The first one fucking broke.
10863578	10881949	Broke down, as in handle broke off the door Take it out, get all the spoiled food out of the fridge Put, I don't know, one third of our food back in the new fridge Plug it in, and then clean up the entire fucking mess that we made in the process Complain, complain, complain
10882745	10883607	Fuck this heat.
10884648	10885610	It's all I got.
10885670	10886592	May as well make it big.
10897173	10898775	By the way, I said I was going to do this on the show.
10899256	10902419	This is my impersonation of watching World Cup on Telemundo.
10903641	10907926	Okay, Becky and I, my last week of work, we decided to go get tacos at our usual place.
10908426	10910929	And we were watching Uruguay versus Netherlands.
10911931	10912792	And it was great.
10913252	10915254	But every time, of course, there was a goal.
10915515	10915935	Wait here.
10916756	10917556	Where's that camera now?
10917576	10921538	And then back on your... Goal!
10921858	10922058	Goal!
10922259	10923079	Goal!
10923119	10923799	Goal!
10923819	10924099	Goal!
10924139	10924440	Goal!
10924480	10926781	Goal!
10927521	10930342	That's my impersonation of watching a World Cup on Telemundo.
10930602	10931803	You make it sound so riveting.
10932583	10932923	All right.
10933844	10935144	Loki, got some news for us?
10936545	10936805	Yes.
10937245	10942568	The PS3 is becoming white and... Racist.
10944228	10944849	In Japan.
10944969	10945089	It's...
10947290	10948652	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10966272	10976067	and we'll also include a new vertical white stand and of course a white DualShock 3 controller and I'll be retailing for 29,980 yen.
10980091	10980651	I was looking at chat.
11001698	11001998	Wow.
11003639	11006060	Didn't they already have the Final Fantasy XIII one that was white?
11006200	11008941	Yeah, it was white with like a pink crap on it.
11009861	11013002	Well, they put a woman on it, so that's why it didn't sell.
11016264	11018505	I was waiting to get voodoo.
11018585	11020405	DarkSakura's distracted by EarthBound.
11020926	11023086	I was looking at the anti-piracy stuff.
11023166	11023747	It's for the best.
11024167	11024467	Alright.
11028348	11029729	Do you have anything else to go with that?
11030799	11036063	Also, they're going to be bundling Resident Evil 5 with the PlayStation Move over there.
11036483	11041507	Which, in all honesty, is probably a better game anyways than what Move Sports.
11043028	11044669	Yay, Move Sports.
11045710	11049072	Stop it right now!
11052754	11057718	It's also supposed to be including, I believe, the gun shooting pack.
11059224	11071487	Oh, they have also announced a big three gun shooting perfect pack that will include Time Crisis, Raising Storm, Dead Storm Pirates, and Time Crisis 4, the arcade version.
11072368	11073828	That's going to cost about $136 or 11,980 yen.
11073848	11077049	But, of course, the Move bundle with Resident Evil 5, the alternative edition.
11077109	11081970	It's all going to have alternative music in there.
11089972	11117738	that'll retail for about $7,980 yen or about $90 once again, I'd rather have Resident Evil 5 than the crappy screw it, pack the Resident Evil game with the white PS3 and call it equal opportunity that way everyone gets offended the nice thing about the move and a lot of that stuff is that those games aren't going to require move that's true much different than the Kinect just so you know
11120131	11146826	but they may have some games that require them actually no there are games that require the move oh well yeah how the fuck are you gonna play move sports or how are you gonna play the sorcery game or how are you gonna play um well there's a lot there's a lot though that don't require it that's true there are a lot that require it the same could be said about the connect though as well there's a lot what there's child of eden and well that's all that's been announced yet yeah
11149636	11156302	That's alright that they don't require that the PlayStation Move be required to play certain games because it probably will stink.
11157623	11157863	Alright.
11158503	11162686	One more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
11162847	11168311	And I'm sorry, this picture that they have photoshopped with the Move in her hand, it looks like a giant sex toy.
11168791	11172374	A freaking huge giant sex toy with a glowing end on it.
11172994	11173355	Are you done?
11173655	11173915	I'm done.
11174055	11174315	You swear?
11174335	11174696	I swear.
11174736	11174896	Alright.
11175596	11176757	One more story for you guys tonight.
11177317	11182019	And it has to do with an OLR favorite game, Eye of Judgment.
11182780	11185601	And I guess you could say a sad end to a story here.
11186121	11197567	Yes, the Eye of Judgment, or as we sometimes call it here on Orange Launch Radio, the Brown Eye of Judgment, or that game we really wish would sell one million copies so that Loki would have to put on a tingle suit when he comes to the show.
11197587	11199647	You might remember he made that bet a long time ago.
11202188	11229660	apparently the Eye of Judgment servers are going to be shut down on September 30th and that was a notice now it's on the European Playstation forums but you can just pretty much guess that this pretty much is going to carry over to the states as well so offline play will still be available of course but if you play the Eye of Judgment online you will no longer be able to after September 30th I have something to say about that what?
11231361	11233946	So I'm sure all ten of you will be sad.
11235790	11236150	What's that?
11236651	11238515	I said I'm sure all ten of you will be sad.
11242119	11253987	Well, this also means something else, you guys, is that we made that bet with Loki, and I know you guys were holding out hope that somehow, someway, maybe a price cut or something would happen where this game would sell a million copies.
11254427	11265075	But guys, now that the developer is even pulling the plug on Eye of Judgment, I think it's time to finally admit, you guys, the bet, ladies and gentlemen, is over.
11268055	11272618	And not to mention that they stopped printing the game like years ago.
11272638	11275200	I don't even think they printed one million copies.
11275440	11278282	No, I can guarantee they did not print one million copies.
11278562	11283145	We never made it official here on the show, so I kind of felt like we needed to finally say...
11284546	11285087	It's over.
11285147	11285987	I'm sorry, you guys.
11286187	11286568	Damn.
11286828	11294573	You lost the bet with Loki, and Loki will not be ever dressing up as Tingle unless you can get him to sign up to something else, which should be your next goal.
11295594	11302239	If you're not able to get him to sign up or do this with the eye of judgment, then you should get him to make a bet somewhere else.
11302839	11303600	That's just all I'm saying.
11305333	11305653	All right.
11306314	11307835	Are we ready to take some phone calls?
11308575	11309015	Sure.
11309156	11310576	I think so.
11310596	11315360	1-877-GAME-OLR is our phone number or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
11315400	11317701	The Skype line is now open for business.
11318301	11320763	And meanwhile, some last minute stories for you guys.
11321804	11324505	I was asked by a listener to throw this out here real quick.
11324966	11328228	Metal Max 3 is coming out soon.
11328688	11333131	It's cute because there's this little dog that you can play with here and it's kind of like
11333231	11333912	Out in the States 2
11350620	11355442	I want to say it was either on the PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 2, maybe.
11356062	11358563	Because I remember it's the one with dogs with artillery on it.
11358603	11359983	Because that's so epic.
11360584	11361224	Yes, it is.
11361664	11362604	Dogs with artillery.
11362624	11363705	I think it's the same game.
11363985	11367226	I can't remember what it's called over here, but that's how I sold it.
11367266	11370207	I'm like, dude, it's dogs with freaking cannons on the back of them.
11370487	11371127	Thanks for watching!
11390679	11391619	Our skyline is open.
11391859	11395900	I guess our freaking feed dropped for some reason.
11395920	11398161	1-877-GAME-OLR is the phone number to call.
11398861	11400901	I don't know why we're having stream fail problems tonight.
11400921	11401782	I blame Visual Basic.
11402642	11403502	I blame the Vuvuzela.
11404182	11404442	All right.
11406183	11409123	Loki, you have any last minute stories for us while we wait for some phone calls?
11409904	11410464	Just one.
11410664	11416165	Apparently the rumor is the new Animal Crossing game for the 3DS will have you as the role of the mayor.
11418061	11423925	Interesting, so you will have to do stuff for the town Where's that rumor coming from?
11424025	11438295	It's coming from apparently a PDF that came out from Nintendo during E3 Which makes sense because they did put out E3 Or they usually put out PDFs with information regarding their titles Alright, let me get to the phone because we do have a call on hold Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
11439556	11442678	Hi, this is Spazinator Hey Spazinator, what's on your mind?
11444652	11450694	Well, this is just basically a follow-up call to the call I had made like two weeks ago.
11452634	11457215	Just a quick recap, just in case you or the other listeners forgot.
11458395	11472679	Basically, Sony was having me jump through hoops to get my VOs back after having to send my system in for repair, again, for the yellow light of death.
11473867	11489174	and basically, I don't know if anyone's seen my little rants on Twitter, but here it is basically a week and a half later and I still don't have all my videos back.
11491355	11499339	Basically, I literally looked at what they did authorize and
11502665	11510209	I compare that to all the videos that backed up, and basically I still got like 55 videos outstanding.
11511230	11514011	And I'm like, what the fuck, you know?
11514231	11516572	You would think you're not the only person, too, that this happens to.
11517333	11528138	It's weird that they don't have a better process, like at least Microsoft seems to have with the whole, you know, releasing your DRM once a year to be able to re-download it.
11528158	11529639	It seems a little ridiculous.
11529659	11530059	Yeah.
11531590	11537272	Yeah, my main gripe more than anything is that, well, it's kind of two-fold.
11538132	11551176	A, the first one being that Sony's policy in terms of having this done is supposed to be done within 24 to 48 hours of your call.
11552357	11559239	And since I made the initial call on the Wednesday before the 4th of July,
11560115	11567863	I've still got all my videos back by that Friday, and like I just said, I'm still missing 55 videos.
11568924	11579195	And the second gripe that I have is that the Sony reps over there either don't seem to know what the hell they're doing,
11579838	11582559	or just don't give a shit one way y'all are.
11599306	11601087	Well, maybe you should buy hard copies.
11601347	11607109	I mean, does this kind of make you think, wow, this might be the case against digital distribution?
11607289	11610030	Or are you walking away from this going, oh, you know what?
11610290	11612190	I'm still about digital distribution.
11613871	11628216	Well, you know, some of the shows I normally get on a regular basis, for example, I buy the weekly recaps of X-Play and Attack of the Show on a regular basis, and
11629057	11641245	I've never seen those on hard copy whatsoever unless I get like a DVD burner and record them directly out the air.
11641685	11642606	Interesting, okay.
11643907	11653553	Yeah, in other shows, you know, I've tried looking at places like Blockbuster, Target, and what that, and...
11654861	11656242	I almost never see them.
11656902	11668268	My only other recourse would probably be to go to Microsoft, get them there, or get them on PlayStation Network.
11669169	11672310	Or find some kind of mail order service and buy them that way.
11673711	11684297	But the thing is, David's Joe Schmoe shouldn't have to jump through hoops, plead and beg, and
11685060	11690051	yada yada yada to get all their videos back that they rightfully paid for, you know?
11690171	11694701	I mean, all I want is to sit down, watch my videos when I'm at it,
11695171	11697212	Playing my games and whatnot.
11697432	11700333	I mean, really, is there really too much to ask for?
11722603	11741729	and that's really what it boils down to unfortunately I can't make Sony give the stuff back or what have you so there's not a lot we can do but I'm hoping you're able to get conclusion to this but that just really bites and I think unfortunately your story is going to have to be cautioned for everybody else
11743052	11748516	Yeah, one final note before I let you go and get to the next call.
11749937	11763967	I did make my most recent call to Sony this past Friday and basically bitching to them about what's going on with the videos and
11764775	11773378	Basically, they said it's going to take a couple days longer and I should, you know, get them back by Tuesday.
11774618	11782281	And, you know, if I don't get them by Tuesday, I'm just going to call them back and I'll tell them how pissed off I am and
11782915	11789079	and I'll certainly take all my business over to Microsoft in terms of digital downloads and whatnot.
11789319	11792281	Tell them you've got the video game podcast of the galaxy behind your back.
11794102	11794402	All right.
11794562	11795042	Well, thanks.
11795663	11795983	All right.
11796043	11798084	Well, have a good one.
11798324	11798584	All right.
11798845	11802247	And I'll keep you posted as to what's going on.
11802307	11802727	Please do.
11802747	11804688	And they can follow you on Twitter too at what?
11804728	11806990	Spazinator underscore PSN, right?
11807290	11808170	Or is there no underscore?
11808711	11808911	All right.
11808931	11809211	There it is.
11809611	11809851	All right.
11810151	11810852	Take care, Spazinator.
11811980	11812520	Yep, you too.
11812700	11812961	Later.
11813801	11814201	Interesting.
11814401	11818443	I see Bonds in chat says my PS3 yellow ringed on me too.
11818563	11823106	So I guess... And Rob, that's the official video game podcast of the galaxy.
11823186	11823646	I'm sorry.
11824066	11824426	I'm sorry.
11824687	11826367	I didn't violate the decree, did I?
11827088	11827928	Is there a clause in there?
11827948	11828248	Okay.
11828489	11828729	I'm good.
11828749	11829669	I just want to clarify that.
11829689	11829889	All right.
11829929	11830209	Thank you.
11830389	11831150	Thank you for clarifying that.
11833211	11836212	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the official video game podcast of the galaxy.
11836553	11840995	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
11843416	11849258	Yeah, SSJ100Matt has advice for Spaznator saying, if you're going to keep getting bitten by this, then just stop downloading videos on it.
11849298	11851800	It really isn't worth the hassle every six months with this nonsense.
11852220	11859563	You know, I kind of make this comparison to what I'm going through in World of Warcraft right now is that you invest so much in something...
11860103	11860864	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11879076	11885418	I think, though, what you've got to do is you've got to let his trouble serve as a lesson for everybody else.
11885438	11888979	1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
11889299	11890819	Loki, do you have any last-minute stories for us?
11891820	11892120	Sure.
11893660	11898761	Real quick, I guess they're going to be doing a prequel to Dead Space 2 called Dead Space Ignition.
11899181	11904643	That'll be available out on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network slightly before the title is released.
11905223	11907605	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11925796	11929820	But now we actually have release dates and prices for these titles as well.
11930420	11934223	So, starting July 21st, Limbo will be making its way out.
11934804	11937526	July 28th has Hydro Thunder Hurricane.
11938127	11940509	August 4th, Castlevania, Harmony of Despair.
11941289	11943111	August 11th, Monday Night Combat.
11943471	11948935	And August 18th, Lara Croft in The Guardian of Light, or as I call it, Lara Croft in Who Gives a Shit.
11949756	11952278	Hey, I hear it's much cooler than you'd think.
11952618	11954700	Yeah, that's what I hear about every single one.
11954720	11955420	And guess what happens?
11955600	11956461	They all suck.
11956581	11958562	All I'm just saying, it's not Tomb Raider.
11958623	11961525	It's more, you're not supposed to say it's Diablo, but it's Diablo.
11962926	11963366	You know what?
11963446	11965307	If I want to play Diablo, I'll play Diablo.
11967689	11976135	And those are all going to be out for the new 800 Microsoft price point, which is actually now 1,200 Microsoft points, or $15.
11976175	11976275	Yeah.
11978257	11978557	PS15 is the new 5
11992520	11994281	We're not getting a lot of calls on Skype tonight.
11994301	11995061	I don't know what's going on.
11995121	11996642	Is something wrong with our line?
11996862	11997462	What's the deal?
11997722	11998662	What's the dealio?
11999723	12001764	Give us a call already, geez.
12001784	12002584	877-GAME-OLR.
12003144	12005285	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
12006666	12013829	There's another cave shmup game coming to Xbox Live Arcade, Gouange, and it's going to be released worldwide.
12014649	12018090	All right, let's go into the call.
12018410	12019271	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
12019291	12019611	Who's this?
12020698	12022539	Ah, good old-fashioned Legend of Zaku here.
12022559	12024259	Well, hello, Legend of Zaku.
12024299	12024999	What's on your mind?
12025019	12026219	Even old-fashioned.
12026920	12028260	Yes, nothing much, really.
12028320	12033041	Just, like, getting back from, like, excursions with my girlfriend over the weekend.
12033521	12035182	But not anywhere interesting.
12035842	12037562	I didn't know you had a girly friend now.
12037782	12038442	What's your name?
12039583	12040383	My name's April.
12040443	12042603	We've been together for about, like, four months now.
12042903	12044984	Is she a reporter for a major newspaper?
12045734	12046314	No!
12046334	12048054	Bob!
12048355	12049955	I thought it was a television station.
12050075	12050575	I had to.
12050635	12051355	Oh, it was a TV.
12051395	12051995	I forget.
12052035	12053916	Hi, April!
12054136	12054616	What's on your mind?
12055736	12070939	Besides DDRX2 release, another thing that I noticed was that the former Infinity Ward employees are actually ratcheting up their suit against Activision with more details as to how much Activision created a hostile environment for them.
12072122	12080226	Stuff like, you know, their top executives telling the Infinity Ward folks to get over it regarding the bonuses that they were promised.
12080986	12083947	Basically being interrogated in secrecy.
12084487	12090090	Stuff that you would see in some sort of like, you know, stuff that you would see during the Soviet Union days.
12090750	12094031	Where you had a secret police interrogate people out of nowhere.
12094672	12095272	And just try to...
12095512	12099896	Did Activision recently exchange 10 spies for 4 of Infinity Ward's spies?
12099976	12101938	And one of them was this really hot redhead?
12101958	12102698	Perhaps.
12103019	12104120	I think I saw something on that.
12104140	12113768	But I guess it's to the point where they literally withheld bonuses unless they churned out another Modern Warfare game to be completed November of next year.
12113868	12114489	Stuff like that.
12114709	12118853	They were basically being whored out to spit out nothing but Modern Warfare.
12119193	12120615	You know what's interesting?
12120875	12120975	What?
12121295	12149327	something similar to what you're saying right now was brought up earlier in the show and it was when Loki was talking about Crackdown 2 and you know we mentioned oh Crackdown 2 has been getting a lot of crap because it's just like Crackdown 1 and we were talking about how the developers had to start from scratch and you know they should just have waited and not say they're going to patch it on the back end and then Drew kind of chimed in and said well that was probably the publisher not the developer and it's kind of interesting because this whole thing you're talking about is publisher bullying the developer
12150612	12151332	Yes, exactly.
12151732	12160034	This goes back to the point of who holds the strings and how much power is being wielded by Activision.
12160114	12164155	In this sense, they're swinging that big stick of theirs, no pun intended.
12164235	12166035	Who has the bigger penis?
12166055	12167876	Well, that's how it usually is.
12167936	12169476	Remember Hellgate London?
12170536	12174197	That had numerous problems with it, but they had to make the Halloween release date.
12176134	12186525	I know, I mean, Infinity Ward met their deadline ahead of schedule, and yet they're basically asking twice as much from them for very little in exchange.
12186845	12192230	They're going as far as just giving them crumbs of their bonuses.
12192411	12195414	Let me put out a pro tip to all the publishers of the world out there.
12195534	12197015	I think, in general...
12197956	12201778	Are gamers going to be pissed if you keep pushing a game back and back and back and back?
12201918	12205681	Yes, they're going to be pissed off and there's going to be rabble rabble on the internet.
12205721	12211684	But at the end of the day, when that game comes out, do you want to actually sell copies of the game?
12211824	12214226	If so, it should probably be a good game.
12214566	12216327	So my advice to the publishers of the world...
12216767	12219048	Take the time to get it right.
12219369	12223011	Are you going to go through a little bit of belly aching and pains while you make it right?
12223091	12227373	Yes, but at the end of the day, it's going to be worth it because if the game kicks ass, there you go.
12228654	12231576	How many of you remember, never forget, Super Smash Bros.
12232116	12238640	Brawl, the new one on the GameCube, on the Wii, was delayed like twice.
12239161	12241402	And one of them was a huge delay, like six months, right?
12241422	12244925	They spent more time on it, and as a result, the quality increased.
12244985	12252970	Now this goes back to my point where Hideo Kojima recently said that Japanese developers are pretty much, they're lacking ambition and creativity.
12253430	12259474	Something that Activision loves to, you know, this is the same card that Activision plays by milking their franchises to death.
12259995	12261536	The Japanese are doing likewise.
12264477	12268197	In other words, if an idea is out of their comfort zone, they're not going to pursue it.
12268217	12274759	It's more profitable to just create a new sequel of X RPG or X fighting game.
12275119	12277739	SalaciousPop in our chatroom gives another excellent example.
12277899	12284501	Arkham Asylum was delayed at least twice, but everyone immediately forgot their angst about it when it hit because it was really good.
12286661	12290142	I just said last week on the show, I think Final Fantasy XIV should be delayed.
12290262	12293223	It's like the Valves and Blizzards of the world.
12293243	12298944	They might take forever, but the games they finally do release are worth the wait.
12299624	12300765	Exactly, that's the whole point.
12301165	12309747	That's why, but then, you know, that doesn't fit well, that doesn't bode well with the public companies and shareholders because they want results in the short term.
12310908	12313088	or else they're going to stop investing money in that company.
12313588	12320890	So this is where Activision makes its bread and butter by doing sequels in the short term and not really preparing for long-term investments.
12320910	12321510	All right.
12322350	12324831	Well, Zaku, we've got to let you go to see if anyone else is going to call in.
12325591	12327511	Don't forget DDRX2 came out in Japan.
12327531	12327691	I know.
12327731	12328171	We heard.
12328231	12328591	We heard.
12328631	12330872	Really quick, what did you think of the remixes?
12331132	12332872	I haven't heard them yet, but what do you think of that whole idea?
12332892	12333472	It's a lot better.
12333512	12334892	I think the song was a lot better.
12335592	12336713	I mean, it's something that blows...
12338573	12344901	In other words, a lot better than what Supernova and possibly Xtreme has offered to blow ZDRX out of the water initially.
12345141	12347263	Are MP3s out there on the internet now?
12347884	12350267	Can you hear these remix songs?
12350287	12351689	They've already had videos of it.
12351729	12355193	Do they still have the stupid tokens and all that garbage to download stuff?
12356214	12356695	I doubt it.
12356755	12357816	I lost track anyways.
12358877	12361518	That'll tell you how long it's been since I've been following TDR.
12361978	12363158	Go to that site.
12363178	12365399	They're updating the list as we speak.
12365419	12366979	Where do I get the songs on here?
12366999	12368160	I want to play some for the listeners.
12368200	12368700	Where do I go?
12368720	12369920	It's going to be a while.
12370601	12373321	You're going to have to wait a while until they get good line-out recordings.
12374142	12374882	Where's the videos?
12375022	12375622	Where's the videos?
12376022	12378003	Are they here?
12378123	12379803	It should be one of the top stories.
12380143	12381224	I'm looking at it.
12381284	12383785	Dance Dance Revolution X2 released song list update.
12383805	12384385	Where are the videos?
12384845	12385225	Where are they?
12386205	12387426	Keep scrolling down.
12387446	12388326	There's YouTube links.
12389320	12390801	Okay, let me see, let me see, let me see.
12391221	12392001	Well, I know how I'll do this.
12392021	12393702	Control-Find, YouTube.
12393902	12394162	Aha!
12394963	12396163	Video with intro of X2.
12396183	12396664	I don't want that.
12397604	12398164	There's a lot.
12399205	12407048	Some of them are, the quality on some of them is a little... Oh, God!
12407108	12408449	The interface looks like Universe 3.
12408589	12408849	What in...
12418891	12424315	Oh, the backgrounds look cute.
12425856	12427277	It looks like your run's really smooth.
12428398	12432321	You should be happy that they brought back Captain Jack in this one, so now you can play this again.
12434163	12435624	How about a different Captain Jack song?
12435664	12437185	Yeah, I agree with SSJ100, Matt.
12437205	12441368	The original one hasn't made an appearance as extreme, and that's all you can say?
12441508	12445792	It's like eight years absent from a DDR mix.
12446397	12448038	But it was in a DDR mix.
12448058	12448959	How about a new Captain Jackson?
12448979	12452201	But it hasn't been in a DDR mix in almost eight years.
12452281	12452981	All right, all right.
12453282	12454903	Because it's been hard to obtain that license.
12455283	12455703	We'll see.
12455723	12458205	Yeah, and my fat ass hasn't played DDR in about the same time.
12458265	12460206	All right, I'm letting you go, Zaku.
12460286	12461207	Have a good one, okay?
12461767	12462587	Yeah, have a good one too.
12462607	12464769	Take care.
12464789	12467090	877-GAME-OLR, his name on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
12467150	12469811	Ranma in our chat says, holy shit, DDRX2 has Super Driver.
12469851	12470932	Yeah, that was that song I was playing.
12471292	12472112	Right there, Super Driver.
12474954	12479856	Apparently it has like Cascada and all these other cute little songs in there.
12479876	12481697	877-GAME-OLR, his name on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
12481717	12482778	We're really not getting any calls.
12482858	12484799	I guess, is it time to end the show?
12485279	12486180	I think, oh, it might be.
12486220	12487480	It's almost like 10 o'clock already.
12488001	12488821	I guess that is going to do it for this.
12488841	12491022	People are ready for sleep, and some people have to work tomorrow.
12491062	12493204	I think we're ready for the skyplanes, or done with the skyplanes.
12493384	12493804	Not me.
12494284	12494645	That's it.
12496606	12496906	That's it.
12496926	12502469	We're going to wrap things up here and be on our way out of here tonight, but thank you guys for tuning in tonight.
12503270	12505691	Let's see, though, quickly if we have any other last-minute stories, Loki.
12507546	12509127	Thanks for watching!
12529443	12532585	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought because we can't end the show until we get the final thoughts.
12532925	12536026	Drew Nami, thanks for being here again and hope you had fun.
12537027	12538367	Expect me over here more often.
12538987	12539708	Not too much so.
12539768	12540748	Take a break once in a while.
12540788	12541749	It's our show, damn it.
12541849	12542349	I'm just kidding.
12543329	12544170	You're welcome whenever you want.
12544190	12545630	Next time you have to wear the Mickey hat.
12546131	12549452	Do you have a final thought for us tonight?
12550913	12551933	My mind is a blank.
12552513	12554054	We have more to come next week though.
12554594	12555715	I have more ideas.
12556436	12562727	you were telling me can I just say we were talking about OnLive and how that's out but nobody here has really played it yet
12562918	12567061	Yeah, it's been really kind of under the radar and a lot of people consider it to be vaporware.
12567121	12568602	Well, that can be your little task.
12569402	12569582	Ooh.
12569823	12570183	All right.
12570223	12570683	Task.
12571964	12573905	Something before DarkSakura gets to her final thought.
12573945	12576727	I meant to bring this up during housekeeping and I completely forgot.
12577188	12579749	I believe you're still going, but I know I am for sure.
12579809	12581050	Saturday, California Extreme.
12581310	12581891	Hell yes.
12582231	12585293	And we've had chatters ask, when are you ever going to California Extreme?
12585313	12586734	Because years and years, like it's been going.
12587214	12589396	I've been to California Extreme all the last couple years.
12589536	12590196	I've never been.
12590637	12591357	Did you go last year?
12591377	12592778	I didn't think you went last year or the year before.
12593038	12595101	I went last year and I went the year before and I went the year before that.
12595381	12597344	Well, we're both going to be there this Saturday.
12597584	12599506	Sadly, Loki's got a pregnant wife so he can't go.
12599747	12600548	But we're going to both go.
12600568	12601489	Carpool, come with us.
12601909	12605013	I can't because I go early to spend boyfriend time.
12605334	12606996	But you guys will have fun.
12607016	12607576	We'll meet up there.
12607677	12609459	We are also meeting Mel and Melody.
12609761	12625497	Yep, I hope to meet up with them too, so we'll have fun So we're not like participating in the show or anything We're going as spectators just like the rest of you But we'll be around There will be write-ups on both Orange Jones Radio and on Geek Life There may even be some vlogging
12626218	12650284	we'll see also I just want to throw out there though follow us on Twitter twitter.com slash OLR because if you want to meet up with us at the show that's where we'll be posting updates because I don't even know what's at the show or what the layout's like it's in Santa Clara now oh really if we're going to do a meet up so it's not even at the convention center I'm used to if we're going to do a meet up we'll have to tweet something also it's more expensive to pre-register
12651400	12652341	Redone Donkey Kong
12676349	12677950	There's a new Donkey Kong project.
12677970	12678730	Yeah, Donkey Kong 2.
12680430	12685111	Alright, DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
12686872	12689193	I want pie or a milkshake.
12689773	12690113	Or both.
12690493	12691613	I blame Loki for that.
12692513	12694234	But I really want something sweet.
12695799	12696640	What is in a mango?
12697240	12701541	My final thought is I'm going to want more Tylenol in about 30 minutes.
12702182	12702682	I have some.
12702962	12703802	No, I have some too.
12705023	12705303	Issues.
12706883	12707704	Loki, your final thought.
12710365	12711605	I have to paint more of the room.
12712365	12712946	Yay.
12713706	12721769	I did think of you because I found more Mario things that people have made online.
12722625	12723466	Cool.
12724326	12729689	Nellie was supposed to be posting pictures online of the progress I've made, but she has failed to do that.
12729989	12731490	I would like to make the hamper for you.
12732091	12732571	The hamper?
12732931	12733171	Yeah.
12734432	12735213	The diaper hamper?
12736153	12737634	The poop warp pipe?
12738975	12739555	The warp pipe.
12739955	12740196	Nice.
12741837	12743318	I have an idea that I've drawn up.
12743378	12744898	I just have to find the sketchbook I put it in.
