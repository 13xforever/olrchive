0	18520	Tonight, July 11th, 2010, could a cell phone be built into the 3DS?
18520	24760	A trial date is set for Infinity Ward vs Activision, and Microsoft teams up with Fast Food to promote
24760	29760	a Kinect game.
29760	36080	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
36080	37080	Radio.
37080	39880	It is the show where every gamer has a voice.
39880	41760	Thanks so much for tuning in to us tonight.
41760	47360	We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, at All Games Radio,
47360	49760	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, www.allgames.com.
49760	55200	We're going to talk about video games, gaming culture, gamer lifestyle.
55200	56200	My name is Rob Roberts.
56200	58080	I'll be joining you over the next few hours.
58080	62800	Joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.
62800	68920	How you doing, Jamie Sommers?
68920	73200	Now I noticed, as we promised two weeks ago, because we didn't have a show because of the
73200	76800	4th of July, you did not come in here as Inspector Gadget tonight.
76800	78960	Is everything okay with the finger?
78960	82800	My surgery got delayed to Tuesday because of a scheduling issue.
82800	85520	Well, good for us though, that way you're not high.
85520	88120	You shouldn't ship in the bionic parts.
88120	96040	No, basically, the thing is that my visit with my last surgeon was set up as my consultation.
96040	100840	He was just going to refer me into surgery, except he didn't put surgery in the thing.
100840	101840	Uh oh.
101840	106480	I've already filled out all my FMLA and everything, so my new doctor's just like, uh, we'll go
106480	114040	ahead and write your leave starting Friday, which is what it was supposed to have been.
114040	119840	And then I go in Tuesday at 2 o'clock Pacific to have my hand flayed.
119840	120840	So now-
120840	122120	And I think they're going to put me under this time.
122120	124160	Oh, you don't get to watch!
124160	125160	How sad.
125160	128920	Well, the only logic, the only reason I think this is because they're telling me not to
128920	133360	eat beforehand, so usually that's a sign that they're going to clunk out.
133360	137800	Maybe they'll just numb a lot of parts, like you won't be able to feel the whole left half
137800	138800	of your body for a little while.
138800	142680	Well, see, that's what happened last time is that they damned off my arm so that there'd
142680	143680	be no blood in my hand.
143680	148440	Well, now, here's what I want to know, because obviously we are a video game show, how does
148440	150160	this affect your gaming ability?
150160	154480	Are you going to be not able to play Star Trek Online anymore, or what happens?
154480	159240	Well, last time I had this done, two days later, I was up all night playing Blue Dragon.
159240	161280	Were you just kind of using one hand?
161280	166280	For the most part, I mean, because really it was a lot of running around and, you know,
166280	172000	and I was actually using, I had the controller in my lap when I wasn't, you know, walking
172000	174400	and was pushing the button with a finger.
174400	178760	A lot of those RPGs, like Final Fantasy, Blue Dragon, and so forth, really lend themselves
178760	182760	easy to like only having one hand, because it's like, A, attack, A, target creature,
182760	184880	A, A, A, A, over and over, you know?
184880	188400	You remember that single-handed PlayStation controller, the RPG controller?
188400	189400	Oh, vaguely, yes.
189400	191600	I think I've got one somewhere.
191600	192600	Vaguely.
192600	193600	Yeah.
193600	194600	They weren't very popular, I don't think.
194600	195600	Maybe, well, he's not here.
195600	197840	I think we just were given one or something.
197840	198840	Nice.
198840	200080	Single-hand control schemes are always nice.
200080	201080	Remember Earthbound?
201080	202080	Mm.
202080	204760	All right, we got a lot of other voices I haven't even introduced yet.
204760	205760	What, huh?
205760	207760	I do have to, well, I'll talk about it later.
207760	208760	All right.
208760	213960	Say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki, as well, who's drinking a shake.
213960	215440	It was hot outside.
215440	217680	I didn't mean to inconvenience you, I'm sorry.
217680	222080	No, it was, it's hot outside, so it was the coldest thing I could think of.
222080	223960	It's just gonna make me really thirsty later.
223960	224960	Is it just- The irony.
224960	228780	Is it funny when you're hearing about this East Coast heatwave and they're like, OMG,
228780	232720	it's 100 degrees, and I'm like, that's like Wednesday here.
232720	238120	My friend in Canada was posting about it being, I think, 80.
238120	240120	She gave it to me in Celsius.
240120	245740	Well, if it's 80 degrees Celsius, I don't want to be over there.
245740	249120	That's very hot, actually, isn't that like 180 degrees?
249120	250920	All right, anyway, forget it.
250920	255360	Here's the thing, is that, obviously, I'm joking a little bit, because I know the East
255360	257560	Coast isn't really built to handle the heat.
257560	259360	Here, everything's got air conditioning.
259360	261040	You don't have a house without central air.
261040	266940	That's unheard of, so I know it kind of sucked for them, but it does make me laugh when I
266940	272340	hear like, 100 degrees, panic, panic, panic, because I'm like, wake me when it's 113.
272340	273340	But then you drive to the bay.
273340	274480	I spent the weekend in the bay area.
274480	278200	You drive to the bay area, it's like cold and windy still.
278200	279680	It's crazy.
279680	284640	I had friends come up this weekend, and they were from Santa Cruz, and they said, yeah,
284640	289360	it's like a high of 71, and I'm like, that'd be nice.
289360	292840	All right, we're also going to introduce, he's back this week.
292840	296400	I don't know what the heck's going on here, but he's here two weeks in a row-ish, because
296400	300360	we didn't really do a show last week, but say hello to intern Drew Nami is here tonight.
300360	302640	Hi, guys, just trying to make it a habit again.
302640	303640	I see.
303640	305720	You're, you're, see, I know what you're trying to do.
305720	308960	You're trying to, you're trying to squeeze into Loki's chair when he's out on paternity
308960	309960	leave.
309960	311740	That's what you're trying to do, I think.
311740	313000	Don't think I don't know what you're up to.
313000	316200	I know nothing, nothing.
316200	317200	Loki is irreplaceable.
317200	319520	I may not be, I don't know.
319520	321720	He may not even, yeah, knowing him, he won't even be gone.
321720	324480	He'll be like, yeah, wife just had the baby this morning, but I'm here.
324480	328760	Well, I remember when he was the intern, he was on the floor, and he didn't get pizza.
328760	330240	All right, look.
330240	332600	All right, well, and, and how have you been?
332600	333600	How's life been treating you?
333600	334920	How was the Fourth of July for you?
334920	340060	Um, just mostly sat and listened to the fireworks go off, watched a couple of fireworks displays
340060	343200	in WoW and played some Left 4 Dead.
343200	347000	Watched fireworks in WoW, probably better than the ones I spent $50 on, that's for sure.
347000	349360	You used to watch the fireworks in Animal Crossing.
349360	352120	I miss the fireworks from Final Fantasy 11.
352120	353120	Really?
353120	354120	Remember that?
354120	355120	Oh, that's right.
355120	356120	Oh my gosh.
356120	359000	A lot of MMOs do that stuff.
359000	360000	Good times.
360000	361000	Good times.
361000	366560	All right, uh, yeah, I spent $50 on safe and sane fireworks, which is all we're allowed
366560	367560	in this area.
367560	368560	So that lasted about like, what, five minutes?
368560	369560	Oh, wait.
369560	373720	I spent $50 on safe and sane fireworks, and I just get to hear the idiots down the street
373720	375320	shooting off bottle rockets.
375320	376320	Maybe about 20 minutes.
376320	380440	Yeah, you gotta love all the signs everywhere, zero tolerance on illegal fireworks, and the
380440	381440	neighbors all over the place.
381440	386320	We won't tolerate it, but we also won't do anything about it.
386320	387320	But it was, it was fine.
387320	388320	It was fine.
388320	389320	I had a, I had a good night, so.
389320	390320	It was good.
390320	392720	I hope all of you had a good Fourth of July as well, unless you're overseas, and maybe
392720	397040	you didn't, didn't really celebrate the Fourth, but I hope you had a good week nonetheless.
397040	399880	We're back here with Orange Lawns Radio after our week off.
399880	404680	Um, shezrose in our chat room, chat.orangelawnsradio.com, saying, wow, $50?
404680	405680	What the fuck?
405680	406680	God damn.
406680	407680	That is the exact quote, actually.
407680	408680	What the fuck?
408680	409680	God damn.
409680	410680	Uh, here's the thing, though.
410680	413080	A lot of charities set up booths here.
413080	415560	So I think that jacks up the price a little bit, but that's okay.
415560	416560	Like I-
416560	417560	Screw them.
417560	418560	I don't care.
418560	419560	I'm not buying their crap.
419560	423120	I, I, yes, it was $50, but it went to a preschool, because I don't know about you guys, but I
423120	430000	check first what charity it is, because I, there are some charities out there that get
430000	433840	involved in political things, but I'm, I'm not gonna, I don't want to open that can of
433840	434840	worms.
434840	438040	Well, they, this year they were really obnoxious, because they had all the different stands
438040	439720	set up, and normally that's fine.
439720	442160	You see a lot of stands and whatever.
442160	447520	But this year they had, you know, a few stands, and it was quite a few of them, that went
447520	450640	all out as far as trying to get people to come and buy their stuff.
450640	459160	For example, there was a stand on one of the major, you know, cross streets here, and they
459160	464080	had, you know, this giant inflatable barrel that looked like an explosive barrel or something.
464080	466920	They had 50,000 signs that were out there.
466920	469200	They had signs like literally blocks away.
469200	473920	They had people waving signs to go buy their fireworks, and they were offering all sorts
473920	474920	of discounts.
474920	478480	And I was like, no, they suck.
478480	479880	Still not buying them.
479880	482880	Oh, and they had a bounce house.
482880	483880	That's crazy.
483880	486800	That's a lot of all the money that they spent on their advertising.
486800	491840	Not gonna make it up with the fireworks and like, sorry, kids, you don't have to donate
491840	495120	money to the orphan orphanage, but now we actually have to sell the orphanage to pay
495120	496120	for these fireworks.
496120	502460	You do have to wonder about a charity organization that spends all this money on that stuff.
502460	503460	You know, I don't know.
503460	509720	I, I, I feel a little more for like the handwritten in crayon on the poster board support our
509720	510720	school.
510720	511920	Like I'm, I'm more about that stuff.
511920	512920	I don't know.
512920	513920	I don't, I don't.
513920	514920	But anyway, very grassroots.
514920	516080	I am very grassroots.
516080	517080	Hello.
517080	518080	Look at the show.
518080	523000	Been going for eight years and still haven't been bought by, by the man yet.
523000	524000	So well here.
524000	525000	It's a great thing though.
525000	526000	Hmm.
526000	529280	Fireworks are not good just for the 4th of July.
529280	533520	You can use them all year round.
533520	536360	We had a legal, we had a legal ones.
536360	537360	Shame on you.
537360	538360	Candles.
538360	541200	You had a party like on the 3rd, right?
541200	542200	We had a block party.
542200	543200	I see.
543200	544840	So you did fireworks the night before.
544840	548280	And then I did them the night after and the night after that.
548280	554400	I remember one year I bought like 30, $40 worth of fireworks, fireworks, fireworks,
554400	555400	work, work fireworks.
555400	558120	And I brought them to one of Jamie's house parties.
558120	563080	But because there were so many fireworks here, they never got set off.
563080	564780	So I went home with a box of fireworks.
564780	567880	This is funny how you, you take it year round.
567880	571360	I ended up, I actually ended up using them the next year.
571360	572780	I sat on them for a whole year.
572780	574720	We had real metal sparklers too.
574720	575720	Did you?
575720	581360	And um, those little wizard things that go down the street and um, bottle rockets and.
581360	582760	The groundflowers are awesome.
582760	587240	Uh, going to our chat room yet again, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
587240	588240	Let's see.
588240	591480	Um, Salacious Pop is giving an FYI perhaps.
591480	595000	They could have gotten a lot of it comped since the businesses that donated it could
595000	597960	get rid of overstock that way as a write-off.
597960	599020	Hmm.
599020	601080	So maybe they're just really good about soliciting donations.
601080	602080	I guess that's a good point.
602080	603080	Uh, SSJ100 Matt.
603080	604080	Uh, wait, wait, wait.
604080	607280	They're good at soliciting donations.
607280	608920	Why sell the fireworks anyways?
608920	610960	That's the money donated.
610960	613820	SSJ100 Matt says, Rob, I am the man.
613820	615120	How much for the show?
615120	619360	And also I invited Rob and he didn't respond to it talking about his party that he had
619360	620800	and he called me a dick.
620800	626000	Uh, actually, actually I put myself down as a maybe.
626000	629960	For those that don't know, um, I, I yelled at SSJ100 Matt last week cause he called into
629960	633360	the show saying he was having a fourth of July party and what like classic games should
633360	634360	they play?
634360	635360	And I said, I didn't get an invite.
635360	638360	Keep in mind, I live in California and SSJ100 Matt's in New York city.
638360	642120	So he, he did send me an invite on Facebook and I responded maybe because that's what
642120	643680	you do to all the invites on Facebook.
643680	644960	You put yourself down as a maybe.
644960	647360	It's not like there's going to be any fireworks there anyway.
647360	651960	I usually just say no and then when I show up, it's a surprise.
651960	652960	Alright.
652960	656440	Uh, and then, uh, one other comment here, uh, where is it?
656440	657440	Oh my God.
657440	658440	What?
658440	660440	I thought it was something totally wrong, but it would be hilarious.
660440	662480	All right, but we got to get into gaming weeks after that.
662480	663480	Yes.
663480	664480	Okay.
664480	666720	As like a prank, you know, you set up one of those fireworks stands and you put it's
666720	670000	benefiting Al-Qaeda.
670000	671400	That is not a funny prank.
671400	673200	That's a hilarious prank.
673200	674200	It's not funny.
674200	677560	It gets you killed, but it's funny.
677560	682520	What about instead of something kind of hot button like that, you do like just this really
682520	689320	like obscure charity organization, like trying to launch, um, a horse into space organization.
689320	690320	Now that's fun.
690320	692120	How about the people that are trying to build a Gundam?
692120	694120	I think they already have.
694120	695120	No, no, no.
695120	696120	Okay.
696120	697120	Not the Japanese guys.
697120	698120	No, no, no.
698120	699880	It's an American group trying to build a Mecca.
699880	700880	Yeah.
700880	704840	They were looking for funding at like Alaska or something like that and they were trying
704840	709320	to build an actual working Mecca at, I donate, I donate to them.
709320	712840	I tell you how you sell your fireworks and this is so simple.
712840	714440	I don't know why it's not been done yet.
714440	715440	You get strippers.
715440	716440	Come on.
716440	721740	Seriously, you take you, you take those stupid, you know, charity car washes that they have
721740	725920	out there now and they have them for like, you know, soccer teams and stuff like that.
725920	731240	Well, the same, you know, same time they also have, you know, strippers doing car washes
731240	735640	for different charities and whatnot because they're kind of donating and because people
735640	737480	like seeing strippers in bikinis.
737480	738880	It's a tax write off.
738880	739880	Exactly.
739880	742760	You put them out there in bikinis and sell fireworks.
742760	745100	They will clean out that fireworks stand.
745100	746100	That's true.
746100	747100	Easy.
747100	748100	Think about it.
748100	749840	Who's the stereotypical person that's going out to buy the fireworks?
749840	753800	It's you know, the older brother, men that want to blow things up.
753800	754800	No offense, Jamie.
754800	755800	I know you want to blow things up too.
755800	758520	I think you'd have fun with strippers.
758520	762680	Strippers love, here's another thing you need to keep in mind.
762680	765200	Strippers love other women.
765200	768400	They'll get way freakier with other women than they will with men.
768400	769400	Yeah.
769400	770400	Unless you're a gay man.
770400	772280	I know this from experience, sadly.
772280	778120	It's the whole, the whole point of threatening unless, unless, I think it has to do with
778120	779120	the level of threat.
779120	780120	I see.
780120	783160	I'm telling you, if you have, you know, you have a stand with the bounce house and you
783160	785600	have a stand with strippers, I'm going with the stripper stand.
785600	789840	How about a stand with strippers and a bounce house?
789840	790840	That's dangerous.
790840	791840	To who?
791840	792840	All right.
792840	793840	Um, occasionally.
793840	797600	Yeah, but then you'd have to have work, you'd have to be prepared for workman's claim comps
797600	799880	for back strain.
799880	802840	Occasionally here at Orange Launch Radio, we talk about video games.
802840	803840	They're not very often.
803840	806360	I have a huge rack and I know it hurts, so whatever.
806360	807360	All right.
807360	810120	Can we please get into discussion about how is your gaming week?
810120	811280	My boobs are epic.
811280	813640	Dark Sakura.
813640	817000	I know, I've seen those bras hanging up to dry in there.
817000	821320	I'm like, oh my God, a hamster could live in there.
821320	822320	All right.
822320	823320	Actually.
823320	824320	What?
824320	825320	They have.
825320	826320	Four hamsters.
826320	827320	All right.
827320	829600	We love you, Dark Sakura.
829600	831080	We love your breasts.
831080	832080	Tell us a little bit.
832080	833080	I said why?
833080	834080	How is, how was your gaming week?
834080	835960	You did, you did get to do some games this week, right?
835960	836960	Yeah.
836960	841120	Um, I played Star Trek Online and that's about it.
841120	843120	Um, well, no.
843120	850560	Actually, I think that is all I played with Star Trek Online because I, um, I made captain
850560	855320	and then I took a little break and now, um, I'm trying, I have this goal to reach admiral
855320	859700	by Tuesday morning and then go have my surgery done.
859700	868240	So I'm at captain five now and so I have, um, about, I have five more ranks to go and
868240	872220	then you hit 11 and then spend all your points and then you get everything.
872220	875200	And then episode two is going to be out by the end of the month.
875200	877400	So that means we get, you can get more levels.
877400	879740	They're opening up another admiral rank.
879740	880960	And that's not something you have to buy.
880960	883520	It's like a download thing that's doing it automatically.
883520	884520	Oh, cool.
884520	886320	I mean, like a wild patch basically.
886320	887320	Yeah.
887320	888320	Cool.
888320	891880	Basically what happens with Star Trek Online is that, you know, they, they have their episodes
891880	897240	and then they'll do like little mini updates where they'll do like episode 1.5 or something
897240	899540	and give you a few more goodies.
899540	903880	Now the stuff that you, um, actually can buy in the game, like right now they actually
903880	908800	unlocked all of the, um, the pre-order bonuses that you can buy.
908800	909800	So I have everything now.
909800	911760	So you now can have a joint trail if you want to.
911760	915740	And I already paid, actually, I think I already paid about the equivalent anyway to have the
915740	920720	joint trail because I got, um, another, anyway, long story.
920720	929360	So, um, I, um, I've just been playing that and I have my, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I played
929360	930360	peggle.
930360	935960	A lot of peggle on my phone.
935960	936960	Good times.
936960	937960	The end.
937960	940800	Any idea what you might play when you're down to one hand?
940800	944160	Well, um.
944160	947960	Video game wise?
947960	948960	There's always peggle.
948960	952560	Yeah, I could actually play peggle with my phone.
952560	953560	Okay.
953560	957920	This is a good thing about the iPhone though is that I can actually do, like I could, um,
957920	962120	I think I could actually get away with playing as blue, as big, uh, beluga.
962120	963400	You need an RPG.
963400	964520	You know what?
964520	966440	I'll just loan you Final Fantasy 13 this week.
966440	969960	That way you have an RPG to play and you can talk about something besides Star Trek online
969960	970960	on this program.
970960	971960	I was going to try to finish.
971960	972960	I knew I forgot to bring something.
972960	976280	I was going to try to finish blue dragon, but there's that too.
976280	977720	Final Fantasy 13 would be great.
977720	979440	I'm really looking forward to playing it.
979440	980440	All right.
980440	986000	And, um, other than that, we've been playing the get rid of shit game fun, as you can tell
986000	988120	by the state of this room.
988120	989120	I don't know.
989120	990120	It seems like look in the closet.
990120	991120	Okay.
991120	992120	Well yeah, there's a lot less shit in there.
992120	994000	Who's the, who's the cartoony picture of there?
994000	995000	I don't.
995000	997720	That's a picture that's Yara did for, for me of characters.
997720	998720	Okay.
998720	999720	They're characters.
999720	1000720	I'm like, these aren't people I know.
1000720	1001720	Are they?
1001720	1002920	It's a cute picture, but it's okay.
1002920	1003920	She does good stuff.
1003920	1004920	Sorry.
1004920	1005920	Isn't that awesome radio.
1005920	1006920	We're talking about pictures.
1006920	1007920	All right.
1007920	1010680	But I also hung up my, my bathhouse collage.
1010680	1011680	You did?
1011680	1012680	Yes I did.
1012680	1015360	And I made this thing, which I'm about to put on the board.
1015360	1016360	You can take it.
1016360	1018000	At least you can take a picture and put it on our website.
1018000	1019000	Right.
1019000	1020000	I'm going to put it on the website.
1020000	1021000	Yeah.
1021000	1022000	All right.
1022000	1023000	There you go.
1023000	1024000	But um, cause I felt crafty.
1024000	1025000	All right.
1025000	1027920	Let's as in, I've not been working and I've been bored, bored.
1027920	1028920	So all right.
1028920	1029920	Let's move on to Loki.
1029920	1030920	How was your gaming week?
1030920	1036200	Um, my game week was interesting, I guess, because, um, I had a lot of different things
1036200	1042120	I played that I haven't really been playing a lot of, um, for example, I went back and
1042120	1048240	dusted off a few music games this week, including DJ Hero, um, went and played some of the new
1048240	1056760	tracks in the party mix thing, including the, was it the Lady Gaga, um, uh, Girls on Film
1056760	1059080	remix was kind of interesting.
1059080	1065720	Um, I played that and there's some of the other stuff that I haven't played before,
1065720	1069360	like the other songs, cause I have like all the download content for that.
1069360	1075200	Then played some Rock Band, um, which was fun, lots of songs to choose from there.
1075200	1080920	Um, tried playing a little bit more on the medium setting cause you know, I, I'm just,
1080920	1084880	I was so used to like Guitar Freaks and stuff and never really tried experimenting with
1084880	1088080	playing, um, any of the harder difficulties.
1088080	1093000	Just have a, you know, I kind of like how Guitar Freaks when they ramped up the difficulty
1093000	1096980	just had more notes on the three keys instead of, you know, adding, you know, just more
1096980	1097980	keys to it.
1097980	1105000	I kind of like that a little bit better, but, um, I don't know, it was still fun.
1105000	1112480	Um, and then other than music games and stuff, I've been playing a lot of Crackdown 2 and
1112480	1118800	honestly it's not that different from Crackdown 1 except they made leveling up a lot easier.
1118800	1126000	Um, not that it doesn't take as long, but they don't really have gangs this time.
1126000	1129680	It's just one big old gang that, you know, kind of attacks you everywhere and then at
1129680	1135200	night you get these, like, zombie-like freaks or whatever that run around, but there's so
1135200	1139400	many of them and they're so easy to kill, all you really have to do is, you know, like
1139400	1144600	to level up your physical attack or whatever, you just keep hitting B over and over and
1144600	1148180	over again and it just attacks all of them and you don't really take a lot of damage
1148180	1151920	and it's A, you do take a lot of damage, you just kind of jump out of the way and wait
1151920	1156320	until your health comes back and then go back down there and spam B some more.
1156320	1160880	Now, this game's been getting a lot of shit in the reviews for being just like the first
1160880	1161880	game.
1161880	1162880	Yes.
1162880	1165640	Do you think that's fair to knock the game for that?
1165640	1170960	Um, absolutely, it's very similar to the first game and honestly it should be more like the
1170960	1172960	first game than it is right now.
1172960	1179760	The problem I have with it is that basically it's very linear in the way you have to kind
1179760	1183240	of tackle the game because the first game it was, okay, here's the three gangs that
1183240	1189080	they have and they have these people that are, you know, the gang cell leaders or whatever
1189080	1193180	and then once you kill the leaders you go after the boss and, you know, it was kind
1193180	1196400	of neat because you could, okay, I'm going to tackle this gang first or I'm going to
1196400	1199920	tackle this gang first or hey, I'm going to tackle part of this gang, then go to this
1199920	1202220	gang and go to the last gang, whatever.
1202220	1206600	You could pretty much have the freedom to choose how you would tackle the game.
1206600	1211080	This one though is completely linear because, I mean, granted you can kind of run around
1211080	1215680	and do different things but they want you to hit up, you know, this one point first
1215680	1219500	and you have to turn on these beacons and then once the beacons are charged up you go
1219500	1226040	into kind of a protection mission almost where you have to protect the beacon from the freaks
1226040	1231400	while it, you know, charges up to destroy all of them and that's good and all but it's
1231400	1237240	kind of boring because all the missions are very similar.
1237240	1241560	I wish it was more like the first game where you had a bunch of gangs and you could kind
1241560	1242680	of tackle it the way it is.
1242680	1245840	The city itself is almost identical to the first city.
1245840	1250280	I mean they've got a lot of, like if you've played the first game you'll definitely recognize
1250280	1254240	a lot of landmarks in there which is kind of cool and some of the strongholds where
1254240	1260500	these freaks are and stuff are actually where the old bosses were in the first game but
1260500	1265040	it just kind of, it's a little sad that some of the stuff that, you know, made the first
1265040	1267520	game so good is kind of taken out.
1267520	1272360	Like the vehicles that transform when your driving skills is up, those aren't there anymore.
1272360	1276920	Instead you just get actual different vehicles that have that stuff or all the stuff that
1276920	1280760	was from the download content, the different like guns and whatnot are actually in the
1280760	1281760	game.
1281760	1286920	You have to unlock them later on and it's harder for me to like find these different
1286920	1289360	points where you're supposed to be getting, you know, gear and stuff.
1289360	1294120	Now you have to kind of choose your loadout and run around and then finally you have to
1294120	1299960	find the actual spots where you've captured spots on the map where you can get more ammo
1299960	1300960	and stuff.
1300960	1303480	And it doesn't matter anyways because these specialized guns that you have you can't find
1303480	1307360	ammo for them ever because the gang members don't carry them so once you've run out of
1307360	1310800	your limited amount of ammo you have to go just use their guns anyways.
1310800	1313800	SSG100Matt is also pointing out something that's missing.
1313800	1317400	It's just like the first game he says, minus a Halo Beta packed in.
1317400	1321200	That's at chat.hornsonsrader.com live.
1321200	1325080	But it does have the co-op, you know you can do four player co-op which is kind of fun.
1325080	1328560	They were, one of the things that they were kind of showing off was the magnet grenades
1328560	1331520	and honestly haven't really found those too useful yet.
1331520	1334420	Like they showed off some cool things you can do with them like you can stick one on
1334420	1339080	a gas tank and stick one, another one on a gas tank and fire at one and it'll fling the
1339080	1340640	gas tanks around.
1340640	1345240	But it's just, you know, it's hard to do that and line it up.
1345240	1349640	Oh and then like some of the stuff that they had from the first game that was kind of necessary.
1349640	1354560	Like for example the sniper rifle had a scope on it which is awesome because sniper rifles
1354560	1356040	normally have scopes.
1356040	1359560	Not in the second game because that would make sense.
1359560	1360560	Or targeting.
1360560	1364800	You know the first game you can target different parts of the people's bodies.
1364800	1366640	You can still do that in the second game.
1366640	1370440	The problem is though is say you target the wrong thing.
1370440	1375920	In the first game you can just kind of hit left or right on the analog stick or whatever
1375920	1377620	and it would switch between targets.
1377620	1381060	Now this one you have to keep hitting the target button to see if you can target the
1381060	1382060	correct person.
1382060	1384680	Do you think a lot of these things you're talking about have to do with the transition
1384680	1385680	between developers?
1385680	1388660	Because as I understand it the new development company did not have access to what the first
1388660	1390360	development company had done.
1390360	1392280	Besides what we all see in retail.
1392280	1396360	Well they had access to the retail game and they could play and go okay hey there is a
1396360	1397360	feature in the game.
1397360	1400080	Maybe we should have made note on it to add it to the game.
1400080	1401280	It wouldn't be that difficult.
1401280	1402880	And I hear that they're going to patch it.
1402880	1408240	They're going to patch it to add this feature back because it is kind of important that
1408240	1409640	should be there.
1409640	1411960	That excuse is getting old from all these companies.
1411960	1412960	It is really old.
1412960	1417760	Dude we didn't finish the game in time because we needed to hit our release date.
1417760	1420000	But we'll patch it to fix it.
1420000	1422080	We'll promise us promises.
1422080	1425320	Blame the publishers most of the time.
1425320	1426320	It's an alright game.
1426320	1430760	I do like okay some of the positives though like orb hunting and stuff because there's
1430760	1435000	a lot of orbs and I can tell you right in the first game I have all but like two and
1435000	1436640	I can't find the last two.
1436640	1442120	I mean I could go through a guide and you know search from all down but it's going to
1442120	1445440	be really hard to find near the two last agility orbs.
1445440	1447520	They're probably somewhere I'm not looking.
1447520	1448520	At least this game.
1448520	1449520	You think?
1449520	1450520	Yeah.
1450520	1451520	That's probably where they'll be.
1451520	1452520	Somewhere you haven't looked.
1452520	1456880	Everything that you look for is always in the last place you looked.
1456880	1461420	So this game though does have an option where you can ping the orbs and actually see them
1461420	1466120	on your map briefly so you can hit the up button on the directional pad and it'll actually
1466120	1468040	ping the orbs to see where they're around.
1468040	1471640	So for example you're kind of looking for them and you are stuck with like two left.
1471640	1475400	You can ping it and see where it's at on your map and kind of give you a better idea where
1475400	1477080	there's zero in on it.
1477080	1479240	Thank God for that.
1479240	1483640	But just like some of the other stuff that's in the game it's I don't know it's just very
1483640	1487480	hard to get used to I guess.
1487480	1493240	Oh and the you know the guy that's talking to you throughout the entire game kind of
1493240	1494560	you know announcing things.
1494560	1501560	He's annoying and I can't turn him off which is annoying because he's like you should do
1501560	1502680	these road races.
1502680	1504740	I'm like I don't want to do road races right now.
1504740	1506400	You should do these road races.
1506400	1508400	They'll give you more driving skill.
1508400	1510480	Hey there's a rooftop race you just walked by.
1510480	1512280	I'm like I don't care.
1512280	1516640	Maybe you should go to that you know the beacon because it's not going to charge itself.
1516640	1519400	It's like stop nagging me to do this stuff.
1519400	1520400	I don't care.
1520400	1522740	You already have a wife.
1522740	1524240	Watch out there's freaks at night.
1524240	1527120	Really I didn't figure that out by spending the last 20 days in the game.
1527120	1530040	You know I can't figure out that the freaks come out at night.
1530040	1532360	Oh watch out there's a stronghold over here.
1532360	1536640	Really that's what that means on the map because you've already told me that three times now.
1536640	1539320	It's just very annoying.
1539320	1542080	They should have an option to tick that off.
1542080	1546420	Tell you once when you're starting the game because they kind of do explain everything
1546420	1548340	and then be done with it.
1548340	1552560	Stop bothering me with stuff unless it's actually important.
1552560	1555640	Anything else you gave me week Logie?
1555640	1561240	Some DS stuff because I was you know finishing up the trial stuff.
1561240	1568480	So played Pagle DS lots of Pagle Knights on there and a little bit of Zelda Spirit Tracks
1568480	1572080	just going through the next dungeon where I got some sort of windmill looking thing
1572080	1576600	which by the way that game just I don't know what it is with some of these Zelda games
1576600	1580120	but it pretty much it seems like that the whole dungeon is just a tutorial of how to
1580120	1581600	figure out how to use this item.
1581600	1582600	I get it.
1582600	1584300	Okay I figured out how to use the item.
1584300	1589000	You don't need to you know hey look you can do this puzzle with this you know oh hey look
1589000	1590100	you can do this now.
1590100	1594080	It's like just give me the features that you know the item has and I'll figure the rest
1594080	1595080	out.
1595080	1596080	You don't need to walk me through it.
1596080	1598880	You don't need to hold my hand to figure out how to use this.
1598880	1604080	Oh and fuck you Nintendo for making me blow on my DS to use the stupid item.
1604080	1606000	Some people don't want to do that.
1606000	1608840	Just because you have a microphone on there doesn't mean you have to use it for stupid
1608840	1610580	shit like that.
1610580	1615080	Are you still on that jury duty thing or did that finally finish?
1615080	1620200	Because I'm imagining you at the courthouse playing your DS just like very slyly having
1620200	1621200	to go.
1621200	1622200	And your DS.
1622200	1624200	I did that in the hallway.
1624200	1627140	But yeah no we finished up with that.
1627140	1629360	We had delivered.
1629360	1630800	The trial went on for eight days.
1630800	1631800	Oh god.
1631800	1633840	All right quickly what was the trial because we're all dying to know.
1633840	1634840	What was it?
1634840	1635840	Give us all the details.
1635840	1637240	Okay trials went on for eight days.
1637240	1642940	It was this woman by the name of Julie Mayo who had gotten fired from a printing company
1642940	1644360	in Sacramento here.
1644360	1645360	Which company?
1645360	1646360	Because they're probably hiring.
1646360	1647360	Pacific Standard Press.
1647360	1649360	Okay I'm running it down.
1649360	1653520	No they seemed like a nice company because they did have pretty much everybody you know
1653520	1655640	on the witness stand.
1655640	1660520	So anyways so she got fired from there but she is claiming that she got fired because
1660520	1664440	of racial discrimination because she was Caucasian.
1664440	1668360	She says that this woman by the name of Grace Schneider.
1668360	1671320	I love that just Logie's putting all the details out there.
1671320	1672320	It's all public record.
1672320	1673840	I know it's all public record but it's funny.
1673840	1680280	So this woman Grace Schneider who is a Filipino supposedly called her a white bitch or a fucking
1680280	1681880	white bitch.
1681880	1684320	And because of that you know American lithographers.
1684320	1685880	I called my sister that once.
1685880	1690520	Well Pacific Standard Press or in this case the company was at the time known as American
1690520	1697120	lithographers basically was supposedly covering it up and all this stuff.
1697120	1703400	Anyways oh and because of that she has suffered you know severe depression agoraphobia and
1703400	1707920	post-traumatic stress disorder which by the way when they're asking you the questions
1707920	1712520	you know okay before they're picking the jury and stuff like that.
1712520	1716480	I was just like because you can kind of get the impression of what this person is claiming
1716480	1717480	is the problem.
1717480	1718800	You're just like what.
1718800	1721200	No that doesn't make any sense.
1721200	1724760	So throughout the whole trial the plaintiff lawyer was completely retarded.
1724760	1729720	Reminded me of Andy Griffith in the Matlock role.
1729720	1732300	And I'm just guessing from the way you're describing this.
1732300	1735680	This was a not guilty or not or no what would you call it.
1735680	1736840	Not liable right.
1736840	1738320	The person who sued lost.
1738320	1744740	I'm getting I'm just guessing yes.
1744740	1749360	So basically this this whole trial went on for eight days and the plaintiff lawyer he's
1749360	1753320	just completely idiotic is the worst lawyer I've ever seen.
1753320	1758480	Just after they finished the plaintiff's case it was the defense all they had to say was
1758480	1759480	they got nothing.
1759480	1763640	I mean he seriously did them such a favor it was retarded.
1763640	1766640	All the witnesses they called up not one even sided with her.
1766640	1770680	All of them told a different story the only person who told her story was her.
1770680	1773280	And nobody could corroborate it.
1773280	1782340	Anyways long story short after eight days of trial we deliberated twice in 10 minutes.
1782340	1783340	We knew that was coming.
1783340	1787240	I was just how long did you guys deliberate 10 minutes.
1787240	1791680	And we went over the questions twice just to be sure but most of them were twelve zero
1791680	1797000	and in the favor of the defense there was it was it was sad.
1797000	1800960	We were just like my God because it was down to like three o'clock.
1800960	1806000	And if we didn't get deliberated deliberations done by like 415 we would have to come back
1806000	1807000	on Friday.
1807000	1808000	We're like fuck that.
1808000	1809680	We are getting this done now.
1809680	1812560	Was she was was she pissed.
1812560	1815120	She looked frustrated like annoyed.
1815120	1818320	But she was like crying stuff throughout the whole trial.
1818320	1820520	Didn't do that when she knew at the end.
1820520	1824720	Oh but her lawyer which wasn't really her lawyer it was the his partner came in that
1824720	1832240	when we have the the verdict read he looked pissed and he did of course pulled the jury
1832240	1837280	which we figured they would because we deliberated in 10 minutes but I was like whatever I'm
1837280	1839480	fucking done today.
1839480	1840480	You get nothing.
1840480	1843520	I'm surprised you weren't playing Phoenix Wright in the hall.
1843520	1850440	I thought that would be ironic but yet no she it ended up that she was just a horrible
1850440	1855640	worker and she got fired for you know very you know obvious reasons and it made no sense
1855640	1859840	that she was claiming racial discrimination since the people that fired her were white.
1859840	1865400	She was replaced by a white woman and the majority of the company is white.
1865400	1867600	I'm sorry I asked all right.
1867600	1870880	I'm glad I had to know guys I had to know after two weeks ago.
1870880	1875920	Oh and by the way I did some research after the trial and she had also sued other people
1875920	1880400	and she has an Internet business which is doing a lot better than she claimed that it
1880400	1881640	was doing.
1881640	1886880	So she's a lying bitch allegedly I all right.
1886880	1888760	We don't need a trial for that.
1888760	1890880	I really hate people that do that crap.
1890880	1895800	The plaintiff lawyer kept calling like his client Mr. instead of Mrs. He kept screwing
1895800	1899940	up the gender of different people on the witness stand or whatever kept repeating stuff.
1899940	1904440	He would fuck up their names all the time and he misspelled examining on his little
1904440	1907200	board in this closing closing arguments.
1907200	1908200	It was awesome.
1908200	1912040	We video games back to video games sorry real life Phoenix right.
1912040	1916480	Drew Hey you're going to try and follow that up what do you have been playing this week.
1916480	1923360	I cannot top that I played played a little bit of wow and a lot of Left 4 Dead 2 towards
1923360	1927600	the end of the steam sale a friend of mine give to me Grand Theft Auto 4 for PC.
1927600	1929720	So I was playing some of that.
1929720	1931400	It's OK.
1931400	1938560	It actually made my system work for once but I've just been playing a whole lot of Left
1938560	1939560	4 Dead 2.
1939560	1942880	I really enjoy Ellis he's a motor mouth.
1942880	1949020	And aside from that my gaming group week has been pretty boring.
1949020	1955980	So I really got I really got after all that Loki said I got nothing all right.
1955980	1956980	That's fine.
1956980	1957980	That's fine.
1957980	1961480	Did you take advantage of the Uber steam sale that was going on I see Dark Soccer's on steam
1961480	1965600	right now and I remembered the week we were off they had some Uber sales and I know I
1965600	1972320	bought a lot I bought I managed to restrain myself since my funding is a little tight.
1972320	1978800	I think I spent about thirty thirty five dollars I bought a flat out ultimate carnage for two
1978800	1984760	bucks nice Left 4 Dead 2 for twenty and I was pissed when they dropped it down to ten.
1984760	1993440	It's like playing the stock market someone gifted me GTA 4 and I got one other game and
1993440	1996560	I can't remember what it was but I think I spent in total about thirty bucks.
1996560	2000480	This game is great it's called Blood Bowl.
2000480	2002480	It's Warhammer sports.
2002480	2004280	I know I think that's hilarious.
2004280	2006560	It is hilarious every single bit of it.
2006560	2009720	Let me transition into my week a little bit and I'll talk about what I bought on steam.
2009720	2013400	I was gifted the Civ 4 complete collection for my birthday because that went down to
2013400	2016880	about I think it was like ten dollars at one point so I got that as a gift which was awesome.
2016880	2020040	So I did play a little bit of Civ 4 this week got back into Crackleization.
2020040	2022080	I tried I tried.
2022080	2029160	Oh it's fun but it's a lot I honestly think the console versions of Civilization as much
2029160	2034280	as they're hated by some of the core Civ community I think they are really good entry level games.
2034280	2037960	So like if you've never played a Civ game before maybe start with the console ones but
2037960	2042320	I don't think the PC ones are that inaccessible they've got good tutorials but I played that
2042320	2044120	a little bit.
2044120	2048640	Team Fortress 2 I finally bought I played that a little bit but man I am horrible first
2048640	2053160	person shooters I was sucking in the tutorial levels it's sad.
2053160	2060240	If it was hard before it's a clusterfuck now that they've pushed the engineer update.
2060240	2066800	Now engineers can pick up carry and set down their sentries.
2066800	2074560	So on the server I was testing it on I played for two hours nine engineers on ten man teams
2074560	2076360	and the tenth man was a spy.
2076360	2079840	Jamie and I still have to have our match we didn't we didn't get around to that but I'm
2079840	2083600	I'm still learning how to play so yeah I would probably play as a team of all scouts it'll
2083600	2089440	have to be after the hand thing needs to be because they have the best taunts well here's
2089440	2093920	one thing kind of and maybe you know this Drew I granted I didn't spend a lot of time
2093920	2098080	with it I couldn't get my 360 controller to work right with it do I did I do something
2098080	2102960	wrong or does it not really work I've actually never tried using controller for Team Fortress
2102960	2109760	2 in fact I am very against the idea of using a console controller to play first person
2109760	2114280	shooter why there's nothing wrong with it it's personal taste I find a mouse to be more
2114280	2120280	precise some of those great internet debates well keep it keep in mind and when we were
2120280	2125000	all playing Final Fantasy 11 I was playing with controller well that team was designed
2125000	2132360	for the ps2 really but I could you know break out all my macros like that and people were
2132360	2136640	like why are you using controller I also want to say I bought this real quick because it's
2136640	2139720	awesome even though I didn't get a chance to touch it this week but I bought the complete
2139720	2145080	XCOM collection for like five bucks because the old school I just wanted to I never had
2145080	2148840	the chance to play through those but I heard they were good they're good so I'm gonna play
2148840	2154080	them let's see other games I played this week of course I play Warcraft because I always
2154080	2157560	fucking play Warcraft but I want to talk about some other games lol random game of the week
2157560	2162180	I played Star Wars the force unleashed the game's only about what two and a half years
2162180	2166720	old I finally got around to playing it this week that was that was the other game about
2166720	2171760	Star Wars Empire at War oh well there I'm glad I could help jog your memory there I
2171760	2176520	played the force unleashed which you might remember the talk about this one because this
2176520	2184560	is the one where Soulcalibur 4 had Yoda Darth Vader and then the apprentice Starkiller Starkiller
2184560	2188880	and this was his game was the force unleashed although you start the game playing as a Vader
2188880	2192480	which I thought was kind of cool I was like yeah I'm Darth Vader and I'm just gonna fucking
2192480	2195740	blow everything up with the force yeah I'm gonna blow through this giant wall yeah I'm
2195740	2200480	fucking Darth Vader whoo it was fine I actually was saying that while I was playing you know
2200480	2204440	it's fun but in in and then when you get into the real because the prologue lasts what like
2204440	2208080	15 minutes then you get into the real game and it and you know you're the actual apprentice
2208080	2213920	and there's a lot in the mechanic about gripping things with your you know it's it's what the
2213920	2218280	fanboys want you gripping things from a distance with your hand and like flinging these barrels
2218280	2223400	into the stormtroopers and into all these bad guys it's pretty cool I guess the game
2223400	2228200	got razzed a little bit by the critics and I can kind of see why there was some weird
2228200	2234920	graphical things in it and the mechanic seemed to be a lot of fling things around fling this
2234920	2241360	and fling that and it's it's also a really hard game it's it's I died like within five
2241360	2244840	minutes when I first started I was like whoa I gotta I gotta approach this a little differently
2244840	2249160	and I've been doing Lucasarts games have never been particularly forgiving but I would I
2249160	2253520	would not say it's a bad game by any means it was it was neat I think especially if I
2253520	2257160	was more of a see I'm more of a Trekkie hate me if you want but I think if I was more into
2257160	2263620	Star Wars I would probably really like this and I liked it enough as it is it was cool
2263620	2267000	I mean granted it's it's a little old now but you can probably get it cheap if you're
2267000	2271760	a budget gamer oh I can't get it cheaper than it was at the time it was seven dollars and
2271760	2279060	fifty freaking cents so it was cool I want to play a little more of that I I need to
2279060	2282160	play more I didn't play a whole lot so I want to play more of that I'll tell you what game
2282160	2287080	I played a whole lot of this week Puzzle Quest 2 came out on Xbox Live I believe it's all
2287080	2293920	sold on DS maybe iPhone all if it's not there yet it will be let's face it those Puzzle
2293920	2300500	Quest games show up everywhere so Puzzle Quest 2 is sort of the lol Galactrix didn't really
2300500	2304980	happen kind of game because remember there actually was already a Puzzle Quest 2 this
2304980	2311160	is the Puzzle Quest 2 back to swords and magic and sorcery type of game but I noticed right
2311160	2316360	off the bat this actually threw me for a loop they kind of did away with the world map in
2316360	2322880	the first game and now it's more of this isometric you don't really have free roam but you go
2322880	2329240	from screen to screen kind of like an old ass PC game is kind of the engine and at first
2329240	2335280	I was like I don't know if I like this this is really weird but then I realized by completely
2335280	2340280	changing and renovating the engine they kind of did away with what I didn't like in the
2340280	2344320	first game and that was all the micromanagement you had to do like the upkeep of making sure
2344320	2348440	you're in control of the castles and discovering spells a lot of the micromanagement and all
2348440	2354920	that stuff is gone and they have more of a streamlined dragon warrior-esque feeling RPG
2354920	2359560	if you will although again you don't free roam it's more like point and click but that's
2359560	2364320	not the game right the game unlike those other RPGs the game itself is not moving around
2364320	2370760	the game is the puzzle board and the bejeweled desk matching three in a row game I really
2370760	2374120	like the changes they made here and that's really what makes this sequel I think better
2374120	2380880	than the first game is that they did away with XP and gold as objects in the board you
2380880	2384720	might remember in the old game used to have to match up XP if you want to gain experience
2384720	2389120	you had to match up gold if you wanted gold that's all gone you just gain experience and
2389120	2393400	gold based on how well you do what they've replaced it with is that now there's an actual
2393400	2399280	purple mana so there's five colors instead of four and instead of gold they have these
2399280	2402720	brass knuckles I guess for lack of better more like iron knuckles I guess for lack of
2402720	2411040	a better term and as you level up iron knuckles you can either use a sword or a shield depending
2411040	2416720	on your class or possibly a poison if you're an assassin I think sorcerers do like magic
2416720	2421480	or mana pool regeneration things it's sort of like a wild card depending on your class
2421480	2426120	I kind of like that mechanic it really adds an interesting twist to it so that's really
2426120	2430760	the biggest change between puzzle quest one and two in regards to how the game works but
2430760	2436000	there's another thing you should also know is that now the size of the board will change
2436000	2439760	depending on what you're battling so sometimes you battle these big bears and there's a huge
2439760	2444560	board to go with it and I kind of like that and sometimes some squares will remain inaccessible
2444560	2450440	there are still some mini games like picking locks bashing down doors and they are all
2450440	2456160	pretty much give or take the variations on bejeweled you've seen before like does anyone
2456160	2461480	remember an Xbox live game and I think this is on like Facebook and stuff too called jewel quest
2461480	2466400	where the goal wasn't to match three in a row but was to make every square on the board
2466400	2471940	gold by matching a piece on that square I think so okay that is the search the room
2471940	2477740	mini game in puzzle quest 2 so lots of lots of little variations that you're kind of used
2477740	2484040	to seeing so I thought it was neat I enjoyed it and I played a hell of a lot of it so I
2484040	2488560	think that says something about it and you know for 15 bucks on Xbox live it's it's it's
2488560	2494580	pretty good deal 30 bucks on the DS so not sure what that's all about well I do it costs
2494580	2499120	more to make a cartridge than it does to push something digitally but I could see where
2499120	2502680	the allure of being able to take it with you would be but I'll probably try to play a little
2502680	2506640	bit more on Xbox live I need to because you know how well I'm doing on my beat three games
2506640	2513560	goal I've beaten zero so maybe I'll beat this one we'll see alright you guys ready to get

2556800	2561600	that steam had a whole bunch of Sega Genesis games I just recently got those that was a
2561600	2566000	recent partnership I believe speaking of which don't forget the steam group if you want to

2585400	2589240	to do I do want to point out if you go to our website at orange lounge radio.com there's
2589240	2593440	a little box on the left side called extended play and that's got like everything it's got
2593440	2598760	like our youtube channel our twitter our facebook the steam community olrpsp.com which we haven't
2598760	2606280	talked about forever and the wiki I love the wiki have people actually updated stuff there's
2606280	2610960	a few dedicated like dark Tetsuya AJ mix and I think I've seen a few others they're very
2610960	2614480	dedicated and they're very good generals of the oil army for keeping that stuff up to
2614480	2623080	date but it could use more so I'm hoping people crack on it get to it we need other contributors
2623080	2627560	all right and yes a comment in our chat room act F says nobody uses myspace anymore yeah
2627560	2632160	that's how I felt all right let's let's let's get into some actual gaming news here and
2632160	2637600	talk about what's going on in the gaming world Loki what's up well this is kind of interesting
2637600	2647560	they're going to be kind of changing up how you know people look at Xbox Live Arcade and
2647560	2654760	honestly reminds me a little bit of the PlayStation Network kind of what they're doing but it's
2654760	2661560	called destination arcade it's kind of a visual browser of the Xbox Live Arcade stuff they
2661560	2666560	have a bunch of different things on there including you can check out the new arrivals
2666560	2672300	check out some of the news stuff actually is browser titles they're going to have kind
2672300	2681560	of recommendations based off of different purchases lots of neat stuff also kind of
2681560	2688720	a way to maybe see some more better screenshots now they have this all kind of now but they're
2688720	2692840	making I guess a little bit easier to view because I know with a lot of the titles that
2692840	2697240	are out there now it may make it a little difficult to browse for what you're looking
2697240	2703660	for especially God if you were looking for indie games that's really difficult to find
2703660	2708800	now hope this includes the indie games yeah I was gonna say have you heard anything about
2708800	2715580	like the indie games the incorporation of that no so we'll see because I mean if they're
2715580	2720920	doing this with Xbox Live Arcade and the indie games are almost like Xbox Live Arcade stuff
2720920	2725620	I don't see why they couldn't include it now we haven't heard a lot about this next patch
2725620	2731000	in general and usually there's a lot of fanfare about what's coming up in these big you know
2731000	2735320	it used to be biannual now it's just what annual I don't even know how often they do
2735320	2739680	know it's kind of like whatever they feel like it is still biannual in fact this this
2739680	2746960	thing before well not even that that was just another update this update actually with the
2746960	2754480	visual browser is supposed to be happening I believe this month oh wow so any week now
2754480	2760740	I mean it should be coming soon have they said anything else about what else we might
2760740	2764800	see implemented I mean my assumption is that all this connect stuff is probably the big
2764800	2768600	thing that's gonna be in it but I don't think the connect stuff is actually gonna be in
2768600	2773640	there until it actually comes out on the fourth if anything I would guess that we're gonna
2773640	2779080	get that patch pushed to us probably either I'd say the end of October is when we're gonna
2779080	2787340	see the connect patch they'll kind of unlock all that stuff but yeah I mean it looks interesting
2787340	2793180	I guess they'll be I don't know we'll have to check out when it actually comes out but
2793180	2797880	it's nice I guess but honestly I've never had problem finding stuff on Xbox Live Arcade
2797880	2802720	but I could see where you might if you don't know what you're looking for um act-def seems
2802720	2806640	to say in our chat room here I'm just kind of summarizing what he's saying that this
2806640	2811800	whole new interface seems a lot like the rock band store the guitar hero store and the music
2811800	2815840	shop I haven't used that I haven't used those in a while because I haven't really been buying
2815840	2819100	download content I've used the rock band one before I haven't used it in a while either
2819100	2825360	but I've used it before well I haven't used it let's say in Xbox Live I've used it in
2825360	2830680	rock band 2 but you know it's a lot different on Xbox Live it's like this whole standalone
2830680	2835120	app yeah and you can listen to clips and everything without having to actually launch the game
2835120	2839800	which is interesting but it's what's also weird is that it shows up in your played games
2839800	2844860	history like it I think it's really just a mini game in a way yeah if that makes sense
2844860	2850320	but I think that's how Xbox kind of recognizes it as a miniature free game if you will so
2850320	2855880	um act-def uh also hits us with another good comment here at chat dot orange launcher dot
2855880	2859440	com says I think they won't add the indie games since they aren't available outside
2859440	2863400	the US and other countries so it'll only be for arcade stuff I don't understand why they
2863400	2867500	wouldn't be out they really should open it up to everybody one of the other features
2867500	2871680	that you can do in this is you can actually recommend games for friends so that's kind
2871680	2875680	of cool wait I thought now I realize act-def is in Mexico so maybe that is true about Mexico
2875680	2879240	but I thought um Japan had the indie games too because aren't there some indie games
2879240	2883000	being made over there I know there's some Japanese indie games that are on the service
2883000	2888180	already so I assume that they were in those regions as well so it's just kind of outside
2888180	2892480	of the big regions where you're not seeing this and when I say big regions I say Japan
2892480	2901500	US UK basically I guess all right well we'll see what happens with this store when it launches
2901500	2905920	or whenever we get a patch date so we'll see moving on uh did you know that there's a game
2905920	2912840	called Justin Bieber revenge what yes there's actually a video game called Justin Bieber
2912840	2917760	revenge and I imagine that Justin Bieber just like takes out an Uzi into that crowd of screaming
2917760	2922120	fangirls I found a game going through apps real quick that I have to share off topic
2922120	2931040	vuvuzela versus zombies I want to see Justin Bieber vs. vuvuzela the other day when I was
2931040	2939480	driving home I saw a guy with one of those blowing it out the window of his car I was
2939480	2945080	like what the hell I know it's all the rage I guess I it destined to become you know when
2945080	2950760	they have the I love the 2010 you know many years from now snarky bevels comics commenting
2950760	2957100	on the vuvuzela take that vuvuzela and shove it up your butt it just sounds like it probably
2957100	2963120	improved the sound God all right here it is Justin Bieber revenge look what it really
2963120	2967640	is you heard a tap tap revenge on the App Store right well tap tap revenge has all these
2967640	2977640	spin-off games Lady Gaga revenge Dave Matthews band revenge and Nickelback revenge I think
2977640	2981000	that should go the other way around Nickelback should not be having revenge on me I should
2981000	2985000	be having revenge on Nickelback for being on the radio but I did or Justin Bieber here's
2985000	2989840	the thing I don't listen to radio stations that play Justin Bieber but of course the
2989840	2994440	only time I've ever seen him was when I was waiting for more comedy in Saturday Night
2994440	2999520	Live because they had a break where apparently they just decided not to be funny or anything
2999520	3005160	we're being funny by having him sing but it was just I don't understand I don't see the
3005160	3009000	draw I don't get it all right well here's the thing it's going to be very interesting
3009000	3012520	I think you're going to see a little more Justin Bieber revenge and a little less Nickelback
3012520	3016520	revenge I'm not sure I feel about that in the future because guess what Tapulous the
3016520	3023640	company that makes these games was just bought this week by Disney that's right Disney bought
3023640	3028920	Tapulous so now they are a part of Disney interactive media which is interesting because
3028920	3033120	we've seen kind of more and more from Disney interactive media come out in the past couple
3033120	3037720	years we have split second Tron is coming out soon it's a little more than just the
3037720	3046920	kiddie games so on predator I'm sorry I was like that's not a turok was Disney oh that's
3046920	3053080	right well that's forget it was Sega all right but anyway I it's gonna be interesting to
3053080	3058480	see what this partnership might bring later on and tap tap revenge is not just a play
3058480	3064560	on Dance Dance Revolution that always kind of struck me as funny it's whatever it's just
3064560	3069560	an eye I've played the game and it's like one of those things that's oh yeah I'm black
3069560	3073000	wolf points out a good one that's important epic Mickey which is a very different direction
3073000	3078840	for the Disney franchises is also there not really when you look at it I mean it would
3078840	3085080	have been if it had been kept it to its original wonder you know awesomeness with all the like
3085080	3090020	really twisted shit but in the end it's going to be as twisted as like I think near the
3090020	3096680	Alice in Wonderland movie where there's definitely a dark side to it it's dark sided little bit
3096680	3101560	of that let me put it this way the equivalent of epic Mickey should have been and what it's
3101560	3108320	going to be it would be like if epic the original epic Mickey is like American McGee's Alice
3108320	3114240	versus what it's going to be is like you know Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland kill the
3114240	3121160	mouse take his house kill the mouse take his house what was how it was supposed to be with
3121160	3127560	Oswald going nuts I see I get it isn't what the Oswald's in the in the thing right yeah
3127560	3134000	yeah but if he's not as nuts apparently okay it would have been you know that's what they
3134000	3139560	need to do American McGee's you know epic Mickey AJ mix in our chat room actually says
3139560	3143800	the game used to be called tap tap revolution going back to this old tap tap revenge thing
3143800	3148880	by the way just kind of like a little aside apparently like step mania is now on the iPhone
3148880	3155240	did you hear that yep now they it but it's it's tap mania but like what's really weird
3155240	3159040	about it like and I haven't played with the app so I don't fully understand how this works
3159040	3169400	but apparently you can load mp3s into the app but not via the iTunes interface which
3169400	3175200	I can't believe Apple approved that like there seems to be something there like I again I
3175200	3178600	haven't had hands on with it but apparently you can load your own mp3s and step files
3178600	3183320	into this app and that doesn't seem to be something that usually Apple's very supportive
3183320	3188160	of unless it's they're just claiming to do that via like the SM zips you know format
3188160	3191600	or something like that where you can just zip up the whole file and just throw it in
3191600	3197960	there with the steps and the backgrounds and all that fun stuff oh Black Wolf is saying
3197960	3201160	that it was a homebrew app back in the day it even worked with your own music people
3201160	3204440	submitted note charts and it was awesome and then the app store came out and they went
3204440	3208040	all legit so that I guess that's a history well now you got now you've got tap mania
3208040	3216200	is I guess the rogue renegade tap tap revenge or whatever but does anybody care all I can
3216200	3222480	say is that apps in general effing suck on my 3g now ever since iOS 4 came out like I
3222480	3226520	thought I asked for it was gonna be awesome but it really slowed down the 3g like mine's
3226520	3233000	been pretty awesome that's always been my impression of the iPhone is it was supposed
3233000	3238160	to be awesome but it just sucked all right can we move on I think we got Apple hey you
3238160	3244520	can even take that back to Apple Disney bought tap people we'll see what comes of that in
3244520	3249920	the future I'm just I'm just waiting I'm guessing your brother's revenge can't wait can't wait
3249920	3255200	by the Cyrus revenge goody goody what do you got for us dark Sakura well this is something
3255200	3262320	that has been on the mind of many a World of Warcraft and Starcraft 2 player about the
3262320	3271480	real ID here we go yep and this news comes from geek life plug plug that's geek dash
3271480	3276720	life that's important what's geek what's geek life without the dash take you to porn I don't
3276720	3286240	know I'm gonna look but the dash is important anyway there's a certain thing that happened
3286240	3293480	after one of the forum moderators revealed his name and someone managed to basically
3293480	3298120	put out all of his personal information out in plain view so they said um yeah we're not
3298120	3304560	gonna do that on the forum sorry oops our bad it's fine for everyone else just not us
3304560	3310640	how do people use the official Warcraft forums anyways I don't understand it's like if you
3310640	3316460	don't like it I'm sure that there's other forums out there I mean it tech support I
3316460	3321240	use the official Star Trek online ones tech support but it's World of Warcraft it should
3321240	3326400	never be broken I think well also life is like a podcast or something but their site's
3326400	3330580	kind of ugly I mean no offense it's just very disorganized anyway but geek dash life is
3330580	3335000	great yes it is it's fantastic and I've started doing a blog on there now called tales from
3335000	3338920	the vault okay so be mirrored on the orange I want to rant so let's get through this story
3338920	3342760	because I'm ready to write well I said everything while you were looking up the other site so
3342760	3347880	curious I believe me I have been closely following what's been going on with this whole real
3347880	3352600	ID thing gonna find you Rob have it wrong they will here's the thing the forums okay
3352600	3357520	obviously was a bad idea but yes you do have to post there for tech support sometimes and
3357520	3361520	if you want to contact the GM's you know why because when you call Blizzard you're gonna
3361520	3368000	wait on hold for 45 minutes if you can even get through at all like their text once you
3368000	3372380	get through to somebody their tech support's okay but from the standpoint of like sitting
3372380	3376680	on hold and everything it stinks it really stinks so yeah I mean the forums end up having
3376680	3382600	to be an alternative to that obviously the forums was a stupid idea I mean it was a dumb
3382600	3387580	idea I understand the whole wanting to get rid of trolls things but that wasn't the way
3387580	3393000	to do it roles don't care and it will give them more ammo you're gonna get rid of seven
3393000	3397940	eighths of your posters if at least by doing that so it's like why do you want to shoot
3397940	3402940	yourself in the foot maybe you want to do advertising on your form someday do they still
3402940	3407880	do advertising here's the thing it cuts down on bandwidth cost if you lose most of your
3407880	3413520	forum users that's the genius that's the fucking lizard they don't need to cut back on that
3413520	3417840	meanwhile they're running a computer game with 11 million people subscribing I hard
3417840	3422920	and soon a huge game that's gonna just like turn Korea upside down and then we're gonna
3422920	3427960	have Diablo 3 and don't think I happen with that and isn't Blizzard they have the bandwidth
3427960	3432840	to Blizzard a company that they can just make up a mount and just sell it for $25 and people
3432840	3437920	are like oh we got a new mount and sparkle ponies it's pretty sick dude now if they had
3437920	3441840	sparkle ponies they do have sparkle ponies no I still wouldn't play okay well I was gonna
3441840	3447200	say that that was hey we were promised a pony $25 sparkle ponies all right look here's the
3447200	3452520	thing yes the forum thing was dumb I there were people that were like yay no more trolls
3452520	3456940	on the forum yay yay but it's kind of like okay well now you can just sit there and talk
3456940	3463880	to yourself I suppose I don't think the official forums are that bad I mean yes there's trolls
3463880	3469200	but you know where on the internet aren't there trolls there's trolls in the reviews
3469200	3473960	for orange lounge radio on iTunes there's trolls everywhere you guys I don't understand
3473960	3479160	how it's gonna cut down on trolls because say I have my real name up there you know
3479160	3485200	whether my name is like you know troll guy or you know Matt I can still troll people
3485200	3490360	well look Rob they're they're not doing it anyway yeah try hanging out on the roleplay
3490360	3494680	forums and tell me there aren't more trolls well now how in the F are you supposed to
3494680	3500240	roleplay with your real name come on I know that's that's the death no the dumb that was
3500240	3504820	gonna be massive they already had a replacement site set up for everyone to go to all right
3504820	3510020	look I we could talk about the blizzard employee who got cyberstalked when he put his real
3510020	3513840	name out there and they spill all your data bottom line is they didn't go through with
3513840	3518280	it yay it was makes about as much sense as a whole lifelock dude so I'm not gonna go
3518280	3521400	back into the pros and cons of the forums but this is what I really want to make sure
3521400	3526520	people understand because there's a lot of misinformation out there okay there's a lot
3526520	3529960	of misinformation out there and one of the first ones was and I would see this I saw
3529960	3535140	this on Twitter from other podcasters and people that ought to know better it would
3535140	3541980	say real ID is going away real ID is gone real ID has been eliminated by blizzard real
3541980	3550740	ID is here to stay no no no no no no no real ID didn't go anywhere it's just this implementation
3550740	3556500	didn't happen this extension of real ID didn't happen this whole blizzard already did a dumb
3556500	3561380	thing and they're just making it even dumber is the only thing that got pulled back everything
3561380	3566040	I said in my rant two weeks ago you know what changed from all that stuff I ran it about
3566040	3571200	two weeks ago about the whole friends of friends about the whole your last name is in the game
3571200	3577240	you know you know how much of that changed with this announcement nothing nothing the
3577240	3582580	only thing that that CEO mentioned was that he's they're not going to implement something
3582580	3587000	they thought about implementing when almost 50,000 people replied on that thread before
3587000	3593000	it got officially I have seen administrator posts on the forums and such saying that they're
3593000	3597520	looking to close some security holes in the real ID system so you wouldn't be able to
3597520	3602520	see friends of friends and such they're working on it but it is testament to the fact that
3602520	3608440	if you complain loud enough often enough and in great enough number you can generally rattle
3608440	3614960	the company into doing what's right and yet Bobby Kotick still has a job now Bobby Blackwolf
3614960	3619560	thinks I'm blaming him because he was one of those people that posted about all that
3619560	3624320	no Bobby I'm not picking on you I'm picking on because I know you don't play Warcraft
3624320	3628840	whatever but there's you know people out there that claim to have friends at these companies
3628840	3633720	and friends and all these high places I got friends that work there and I know what's
3633720	3640460	going on well then you ought to know better Oh dark dark Tetsuya in chat so is mr. T gonna
3640460	3644480	start using his real name in the commercial now I know that is his real name look name
3644480	3650440	mister middle name period last name T I know there's some people that don't want to hear
3650440	3655880	all this really that would be awesome for stalking celebrities in the game well they
3655880	3659080	wouldn't post on the forums but here here's the thing but aren't their names going to
3659080	3663480	be in the game do you know it's gone that's gone no here's the thing though here's the
3663480	3671080	thing that's important is that this whole thing overshadowed something way more important
3671080	3675760	that happened in real ID this week so allow me to bring some light to this it was revealed
3675760	3679740	this we don't believe me go to wow.com it's in a story on there and there there are respected
3679740	3686880	wow news site okay there is one line of code when inserted into an add-on will show your
3686880	3694580	real name even if you don't have anybody on your friends list so if there is a rogue add-on
3694580	3699680	out there that wants to insert and and already there's been these false reports and false
3699680	3705000	photoshops and things of this line of code being in popular mod such as gear score and
3705000	3708760	deadly boss mods luckily those are all bullshit but what is not bullshit is the fact that
3708760	3712680	the code is out there and it works rob the hole has been closed it was hot fixed on the
3712680	3718440	tenth yesterday okay okay fair fair enough but it was there in the first place and this
3718440	3723080	is important because blizzard says this whole system they've been saying this whole time
3723080	3728060	that this is opt-in and that it's safe well that exploit showed it wasn't and granted
3728060	3732420	okay whatever this thing's been hot fixed yep yep yep yep yep they need to verify their
3732420	3738180	shit first right exactly and what's to say there won't be a three line code or a five
3738180	3742580	line code that is soon to come out that's also going to exploit this information my
3742580	3747380	point is blizzard has been selling this thing as opt-in and opt-in and a lot of people that
3747380	3752300	are advocating for this is opt-in well this little exploit that happened this week patched
3752300	3758480	or not showed that the system is not opt-in if you really want to shut it off you've got
3758480	3763820	to enable parental controls i'm a 32 year old and i have to enable parental controls
3763820	3769460	on my own account in order to be able to shut off real id that is not opting in that's opting
3769460	3774080	out and not only is it opting out it's opting out in a very complicated way it is opting
3774080	3778780	in because they've opted you in to this wonderful feature well now i realize battle net wants
3778780	3782700	to get in bed with blizzards or i'm sorry they are in bed with blizzard battle net wants
3782700	3787940	to get in bed with facebook so so badly but here's the thing that's what facebook is getting
3787940	3792900	a lot of shit over right now and there's that movie coming out about facebook and they really
3792900	3796780	don't make them look like nice people have you seen the trailers for the i think it looks
3796780	3801380	awesome but they really don't make the facebook people look like nice people like it's not
3801380	3806980	nice it's not a very glamorous remember facebook and possibly blizzard hey you remember what
3806980	3811720	happened to myspace remember how myspace used to be like facebook there will be another
3811720	3817540	website and everyone will migrate to that website let me quickly finish my thought here
3817540	3822160	and that is that you know it's not an opt-in program it's an opt-out program and if you
3822160	3825460	are believing that it's opt-in this whole thing that happened this week should tell
3825460	3830780	you uh different and you might be thinking i don't play wow i don't give a shit well
3830780	3835980	if you're going to play starcraft 2 or diablo 3 this will apply to you and let's not forget
3835980	3841040	how many mmos have knocked off wow at this point how many video games in general have
3841040	3845600	knocked off diablo and starcraft and blizzard at this point dangerous precedent yes it is
3845600	3851120	a highly dangerous precedent so you may not care now but ask yourself if this were your
3851120	3856780	favorite game would you care they might change the definition of opt-in to be you opt-in
3856780	3861920	by playing our game um you know what if i have to say this that if they did it on star
3861920	3867760	trek online i would quit i would and it's a dangerous precedent that they're setting
3867760	3872220	so let's hope they do the right thing let's hope they um allow you to mask your last name
3872220	3876720	allow you to you know have the handle at least hide that friends of friends stuff and just
3876720	3880680	uh i wish my real name was on grand theft auto because i'd fucking love everybody to
3880680	3886240	know that i'm kicking their ass by the way i'm ranked 58 now i in the world and i love
3886240	3890280	this comment from toa gak in chat real ideas as secure as the we correct and that's your
3890280	3896300	real name out there folks your real name because when i signed up for wow four years ago i
3896300	3900280	assumed that the name i was giving them was for billing and information purposes i had
3900280	3904040	no idea what the agreement said no idea that this was going to be the result of it and
3904040	3908240	now i can't change my name i would have signed up with my internet name and my internet trail
3908240	3911440	rob roberts if i knew that in the beginning this is this is what actually i'd like to
3911440	3919120	see happen is i'd really like to see you know an organized boycott hit him where it hurts
3919120	3924860	well that's happening to some extent but you know i don't know it's i'm kind of on the
3924860	3929800	fence with it like i was you know my whole thing last week i kind of believed the whole
3929800	3934680	opt-in thing and that's why i didn't go so far as to say i'm gonna quit that at a da
3934680	3938120	but then when the forum thing happened this week i got really angry and i thought about
3938120	3941800	quitting because that kind of felt like a slap in the face from blizzard to me saying
3941800	3945080	that oh well we're not really listening to the concerns you guys have about real idea
3945080	3948680	in the first place in fact we're taking it a step further and i think what people are
3948680	3953440	forgetting and this is really bothering me that this happened because you know blizzard
3953440	3957640	announced this and then took it back it's making everybody forget the problem that was
3957640	3962280	still there in the first place and the flaws with real ideas it is i wouldn't put it past
3962280	3967280	them that they did it on purpose knowing that would happen i love their game i'd i know
3967280	3972640	i would prefer it to remain a game it's so hard jamie it's not a social network i love
3972640	3977160	that game and and i have so many friends that i interact with and play it with they'll still
3977160	3983440	be your friends and i know but it's it's just i can't explain it i i know what you mean
3983440	3988320	trust me i played ragnarok for how long yeah yeah and i quit ragnarok when they started
3988320	3993840	doing shit i didn't agree with and i played in the beta like the the first actually i
3993840	3998320	played um part apart from the alpha so that's how long i've been with ragnarok online when
3998320	4003000	they started doing crap i didn't like i quit i'm not opposed i'm not opposed to quitting
4003000	4008640	in fact ask ask alan i really kind of had a long chat with him about it and i said i
4008640	4012720	was paid through the 14th so i said i'm gonna wait and see if blizzard changes their mind
4012720	4017200	by the 14th and sure enough the scale back happened and i said okay well now they're
4017200	4020280	moving in the right direction so i'm kind of like at that point where i'm like well
4020280	4024500	let's see what happens but there is an expansion coming out and if they're going to want my
4024500	4028680	40 to the expansion i want it to be an expansion i want i just think that there comes a point
4028680	4032760	and this is something that people in the gaming community need to realize there comes a point
4032760	4039360	which um when you basically sacrifice your ideals for entertainment uh rama kun in chat
4039360	4043400	says chat dot orange on twitter.com by the way says sky all of this is coming from activision
4043400	4049280	they're pushing for this not blizzard i don't care where it's coming from it sucks you know
4049280	4053840	in the end i i don't really care who the boycott is hurting if it's not something i believe
4053840	4057720	in then i'm not i'm not opposed to quitting well if that's correct that means blizzard
4057720	4064020	is starting to push back but i have to it's here's what i'll tell you will happen i might
4064020	4071360	stick with wow for now but there's two mmos coming out this fall that i am very interested
4071360	4077120	in final fantasy 14 and dc universe you're supposed to play star trek and at some point
4077120	4081600	i'm supposed to squeeze star trek online in there too i'm not playing with me i'm not
4081600	4087600	paying for four mmos so quit world of warcraft and play with me we'll see you can you can
4087600	4093320	play with all of my really cool new um friends in my fleet in fact i promised that i would
4093320	4100120	give them a plug and i'm going to so oh yeah go ahead i would like to give my show although
4100120	4104640	they're probably mostly all asleep because they're all in the uk of course they are of
4104640	4110520	course they are the independent united fleet they are super cool people and well there's
4110520	4117180	a couple there's one from hawaii and one from new york i think so i'm not the only american
4117180	4122920	there one more thing i want to say unreal id and boycotting wow and all that i here's
4122920	4127340	another thing to consider is that again this isn't just about warcraft i am really looking
4127340	4133460	forward to diablo 3 i really like diablo 2 and i really really want to play diablo 3
4133460	4137160	so that's another reason i kind of want blizzard to do the right thing here because realize
4137160	4142040	that if i have to quit wow because of this um you know if if blizzard takes it a step
4142040	4145680	further in the wrong direction and i end up quitting wow over this i'm gonna have to quit
4145680	4150920	diablo 3 as well rob which is gonna it's not the same but you could always have torchlight
4150920	4154640	i do have torchlight and it's great so yeah there's the torchlight mmo to look forward
4154640	4159460	to next year i suppose there's a we'll always have torchlight backs me up that you can play
4159460	4164700	star trek online with me and travis oh god travis travis will do nothing but dare me
4164700	4169460	to do dumb shit in star trek online just like he does there's no real way that you can do
4169460	4177380	dumb shit on star trek oh that sounds like a challenge it's run without armor into a
4177380	4182320	horde of klingons and watch them kick you in the face let's not forget my first character
4182320	4190500	and when i was in the beta my character's name was captain sassy of the uss oh girl
4190500	4194660	that was a challenge idea by the way the ship name i've i have seen i have seen plenty i
4194660	4199580	actually ran into a captain jack harkness that's awesome who role plays captain jack
4199580	4207340	harkness on from torchwood on and doctor who all right in the damn star trek online thing
4207340	4213580	i just noticed something how come every captain seems to be named jack go to america is not
4213580	4218660	named jack he's steve um let me let's move on i want to move on to other gaming stories
4218660	4222460	but real quick i thank you guys who have kind of bared with my hatred of real idea over
4222460	4225700	the past couple weeks on the show i know not everybody's into wow and all that but remember
4225700	4231820	i just want to remind you guys precedent this could have a huge effect on online gaming
4231820	4235620	as we know it i mean imagine if xbox live required it your real name would you would
4235620	4239540	you stick with xbox live i just just throwing it out there guys all right let's move on
4239540	4243180	completely there's actually something that bobby just said in chat oh that i think is
4243180	4246220	amazing what's that go ahead and read to draw a parallel i said first they came for the
4246220	4249980	wow people and i said nothing for i don't play wow you know he said something similar
4249980	4254020	on his twitter this week about the whole thing and i think that's a great uh great little
4254020	4259700	analogy for for you know for anyone who don't know you know is that you know finally in
4259700	4263260	the last thing is like finally they came for me and there was you know no one to say anything
4263260	4268420	for me and i think that you know it's like you're saying this is going to set a precedent
4268420	4274540	since it's time to stop it in its tracks and i still say everyone should quit surezo in
4274540	4279740	chat room says it's okay rob ranting on wow is okay with me and here's the thing though
4279740	4283120	guys there's a there were a lot of people on twitter when i said i was so frustrated
4283120	4288240	with this they were like yay quit wow quit wow it's stupid wow but all these people that
4288240	4292140	are egging me on to quit wow probably have some game they really enjoy to play and the
4292140	4296620	thing about wow you guys as as stupid as this is going to sound i i realize this but this
4296620	4300620	is just this is the way it is in the year 2010 okay i have a lot of friends in the bay
4300620	4306700	area that i'm able to like hang out with when we play wow especially one of them happens
4306700	4310020	to be my boyfriend like we quest together and it's adorable you know that's kind of
4310020	4313900	one thing we'll do during the week and i think it's really cool that we're both into that
4313900	4318540	and one reason i kind of didn't want to leave wow is that we wouldn't really have that although
4318540	4321220	we've got plenty of it we could play team fortress 2 or life or dead and all this other
4321220	4324940	stuff and you know it's still we'd still have an awesome you know connection and all that
4324940	4332100	stuff but it you know it's it's hard to just say oh quit you know because you you are saying
4332100	4336220	goodbye to all your friends when you do that but i also understand it's just a game and
4336220	4340300	at the end of the day if you believe in something that strongly then you need to walk away and
4340300	4345620	that is what i will do when you know if if push comes to shove if this makes you feel
4345620	4350820	better rob um i still keep up with at least four people from the free server that i played
4350820	4356340	on in um ragnarok online and back from the old school days keep in mind that i quit what
4356340	4364100	six years ago um i still keep up with at least um three people from there luckily most of
4364100	4367740	the people i play with i already know in real life but there are a few there's there's a
4367740	4370940	couple that were listeners of the show that i've gotten to know really well just because
4370940	4376460	they they came to play wow so you know it's kind of neat anyhow let's move on loki we
4376460	4381280	need like a whole new different change a topic here it's something something else to um take
4381280	4390260	our minds off of all this stuff uh we're coming to the psp real id you know uh it affects
4390260	4397860	nobody um so yes apparently this is great great planning on um sony's part gotta love
4397860	4405060	their forethought in this i pet psp and invisibles may not support the psp go in north america
4405060	4414180	um of course these games do require the um playstation portable camera which would have
4414180	4422300	plugged into the uh usb port on the top of the 3000 2000 1000 models you may remember
4422300	4430860	though that the psp go does not have that port on top of its system instead they have
4430860	4437500	some sort of an adapter or converter cable that um is released in japan to be able to
4437500	4448020	use that kind of stuff that's not coming out over here so yeah it may not be able to you
4448020	4452740	you're obviously not going to be able to purchase the game either via digital download well
4452740	4458220	obviously not in umd because the game system doesn't have a umd drive but um might be a
4458220	4464340	little bit tougher to purchase those for the go i i realize you know i think there's a
4464340	4469180	lot of people that just want sony to come out and admit psp go is a big fucking flop
4469180	4473140	it is a big fucking flopping you know why so he can't say that everybody gotta know
4473140	4477220	that sony can't say that you know what's a big fucking flop have they done any more like
4477220	4482220	bundles to try to promote the psp go no the last bundle that came out was a psp 3000 with
4482220	4488300	familiar solid there's another bundle coming out with um you know madden there's gonna
4488300	4494060	be another bundle coming out i think for kingdom hearts notice all those are with psp 3000s
4494060	4501240	they are not with the psp go so is that sort of sony's way of of declaring it dead without
4501240	4506540	declaring it dead well just like they're still willing to say that the umd format is awesome
4506540	4513020	for movies that it was a successful format i mean they're just they're never willing
4513020	4520020	to admit defeat despite the fact that defeat might be you know very obvious much like the
4520020	4525260	court case i was in for the last three weeks are these games themselves you think you're
4525260	4531340	gonna be any good no it seemed like for a while there the psp had all these like pretty
4531340	4535260	cool games coming out on it now i don't i it's just me or things slowing down on that
4535260	4540760	front we really it seems like everything that's on the psp right now is just ports of ps3
4540760	4544760	games which you know okay you know i i understand you know you want to port a lot of stuff to
4544760	4552180	handheld makes sense but i mean the psp hasn't had a lot of original stuff right like i i
4552180	4556900	know there was the final fantasy fighting game but that's the last one i can think of
4556900	4562900	there's a pretty good like what like the congratulations you've won jamie i hate those things but you've
4562900	4570980	won you should be congratulated um so let's see here yeah there's been you know some good
4570980	4576500	exclusive psp games a lot of it's like niche rpg stuff there's the occasional first party
4576500	4583540	sony title which is you know like i got a war title or something like that uh motorstorm
4583540	4591020	arctic whatever the hell they called it um they're okay i mean even they're decent but
4591020	4595820	it's just not like you're not getting really good third-party tiles i mean mel you're solid
4595820	4602780	it's gonna be pretty good but just there's not a lot of them out there i mean i just
4602780	4606860	know that a lot of my customers don't get excited about psp games anymore not even so
4606860	4611860	much ds games anymore either but i can definitely say there's a lot more ds games coming out
4611860	4619940	than psp games although there's also a lot more crappy ds games coming out but i pin
4619940	4625140	invisimals if you really had a psp go i don't think you're gonna be too sad about that because
4625140	4631340	really i pet you know an augmentive reality game where you raise a little pet i don't
4631340	4635620	think a lot of people that own the psp go give a shit or invisimals you know a game
4635620	4640100	that's kind of like monster rancher but you know you take pictures of stuff and you know
4640100	4646060	based on the picture you get these little animals or whatever uh nothing of that i don't
4646060	4649940	give a shit about that either that's just like saying oh it's so sad that we didn't
4649940	4656820	have the gps function you know for you know some game like they had one for uh one of
4656820	4662900	the uh golf games where you could go and get information about golf courses and stuff like
4662900	4667500	that if you took your psp with you nowadays if you want that kind of crap you have an
4667500	4673540	iphone or an ipod or something like that well let's continue on any any phone that has apps
4673540	4678780	let's continue on with this whole comparison of uh the phones and so forth to the systems
4678780	4685780	because uh apparently uh sony and nintendo both are in talks right now to add 3g network
4685780	4689780	connections to the next batch of handheld game machines maybe this is something in store
4689780	4696260	for the psp2 or even the 3ds or more likely a future in creation of the 3ds um this is
4696260	4702300	coming from ryuji yamada in a newspaper report in the wall street journal he's the president
4702300	4708740	of ntt dokomo inc is the biggest wireless carrier in japan is currently a company that
4708740	4714340	had the cool gachamon commercials yeah currently talking to uh video game hardware makers to
4714340	4720860	try and get these uh portable systems connected to 3g uh there is a quote here from uh ryuji
4720860	4726660	yamada in the various uh articles quote video game makers know that in order for portable
4726660	4731260	game machines to take the next step forward they need wireless communication we are discussing
4731260	4737780	this with various players interesting it's going to be expensive well yeah i mean gosh
4737780	4744700	the 3g and an ipad makes it what 120 more expensive i think these will be certain versions
4744700	4748140	of these types of hardware but i don't i don't think you're going to see this in the first
4748140	4753120	phase of the 3ds but certainly there could be a later phase just like the dsi came out
4753120	4759060	later on there'll probably be a 3ds iphone or something like that coming out i mean in
4759060	4764820	a way isn't the iphone kind of the big competitor right now with the handheld it is it is like
4764820	4771860	it or not the iphone and ipad are our handheld gaming systems right now
4771860	4777220	you know i don't buy that though i mean i understand you know if you put out a lot of
4777220	4781860	games you know on a platform i guess we can call it a gaming platform you know the pc
4781860	4786580	is a gaming platform there's tons of games on there but and just because a lot of people
4786580	4793540	buy them i mean i guess it's just what i'm trying to say is people buy apple products
4793540	4804900	are very um sheepish um ba no i i actually sat sat and compared the stats between that
4804900	4811500	in the blackberry and honestly i've used a bunch of different ones and i like my iphone
4811500	4816660	so you know clearly the reason why a lot of people have it is because it's actually a
4816660	4821180	good product now i do believe in the rule of thumb wait until the second generation
4821180	4825940	all right have you seen this youtube that's been floating around this week because it's
4825940	4830900	really really funny and look i am an apple fan too and i want an iphone 4 but this youtube
4830900	4838100	was so freaking funny mark how may i help you iphone 4 where is the iphone 4 i need
4838100	4845340	an iphone 4 oh i'm very sorry but we are currently sold out however we did finally get some more
4845340	4853660	htce bows in what what is that is it an iphone no it is that 4g phone on sprint if it's not
4853660	4859380	an iphone why would i want it well it's similar to an iphone but has a bigger screen i don't
4859380	4864700	care the internet speeds are around three times faster i don't care it has a higher
4864700	4869860	resolution camera on both the front and the back i don't care and it doesn't require you
4869860	4875980	to be on wi-fi to use video chat i don't care its battery is replaceable as is the memory
4875980	4882000	card i don't care it is highly customizable everything from the widgets to the icons the
4882000	4888060	fonts and even has video wallpaper i don't care the monthly bill is cheaper i don't care
4888060	4893580	it fucking prints money i don't care it can grant up to three wishes even if one of those
4893580	4898980	wishes is for an iphone i don't care it has an app that will build you an island and then
4898980	4904220	it fucking transforms into a jet and flies you there i don't care and it's motherfucking
4904220	4909980	indestructible i don't care about any of that okay fine then what the hell entices you about
4909980	4915860	the iphone 4 if you don't mind me asking it is an iphone you do realize that doesn't mean
4915860	4920580	anything it's a brand all right that's on tiny watch productions on youtube and i i
4920580	4924500	just thought that stuff was funny it's that that's the whole sheet thing you're talking
4924500	4933340	about right loki yes well grab bad bag because i want one and i'm not seeing everybody there's
4933340	4937420	a few people out there that actually do look at the specs and stuff but a lot of people
4937420	4945860	just go oh my god apple's releasing something go by like the ipad come on the ipad the oh
4945860	4950860	i don't get it by the way um there's uh some uh arguments back and forth apparently the
4950860	4955060	guy who made that video actually works for best buy and there was a little like i guess
4955060	4959200	he was fired but then he wasn't um according to a story but he didn't he didn't go back
4959200	4963820	i don't think i think he told them to take to his job and shove it yeah basically i don't
4963820	4971980	care i guess that whole text to video thing is is really easy to do now because that obviously
4971980	4981140	that i would i would take the ferret 10 times over that stupid boo-boo zillow if that becomes
4981140	4990060	a new thing on the show i'm gonna kill myself all right we found the tribble we found angus
4990060	4994740	yeah somewhere in here was a story about cell phones on sony and nintendo would that entice
4994740	4999980	you to buy the system i don't know i kind of don't care no i don't care i don't care
4999980	5004460	that's how i feel here's what really keeps you away from phones like that because you
5004460	5011260	know i will show you my phone rob and just kind of give you an example here my phone
5011260	5016100	used to be silver it is now gray because all the paint has rubbed off on it the rubber
5016100	5019960	that used to be on this phone covering you know the different speaker ports and whatever
5019960	5025900	has dissolved to nothing um some of the back lights are probably burnt out it doesn't get
5025900	5032380	internet at all let me put it this way it still has an old logo loki's phone is so last
5032380	5037700	gen that's basically what it is like three gens ago this is like more than that but here's
5037700	5041840	the here's the point though the reason why i don't get a new phone and don't upgrade
5041840	5046660	my services stuff because it's fucking expensive i pay fifty dollars a month for this phone
5046660	5052340	of which i use i pay maybe twelve dollars or twelve minutes a month i don't want to
5052340	5057700	know what dan and i spend i pay 80 for mine granted but like for 30 dollars i mean i have
5057700	5062120	internet everywhere loki internet everywhere i i have to say this and the big thing for
5062120	5067560	me is that if i wanted to have a permanent internet tether all i have to do is jailbreak
5067560	5074860	my iphone and i can go anywhere and use the 3g as my internet or you know it has my because
5074860	5081900	otherwise i was actually looking into buying a pda you know this replaces a pda for me
5081900	5087500	it replaces my phone my pda enemies don't have to carry my gameboy around you can use
5087500	5092320	and my mp3 player just just to remind i just wanted to tell you here's a really good reason
5092320	5096500	why you want to have internet on your cell phone because with internet on no camera on
5096500	5101900	this either no but here's the thing with internet on your cell phone you can read tmz while
5101900	5107580	pooping i just want to point that out you can sneak into the bathroom at work uh-huh
5107580	5114740	and play peggle just so you know dan i just heard like speaking of pooping i just heard
5114740	5119100	like a huge gunshot go off in the living room and almost maybe poop right here we have playing
5119100	5124220	crackdown too we have epic subwoofer remember all right that's right all right yeah you
5124220	5130460	know what keeps me from getting an iphone i can't fucking afford it okay and just okay
5130460	5135500	okay dude stories on lindsey low hand kind of facilitate release just so you know for
5135500	5145020	the same price as an iphone you can buy a computer all right i can just go into the
5145020	5149480	garage and dig up spare parts and build a computer dark sakura the show has literally
5149480	5154100	gone into the toilet can you uh help move us on to a different topic how about dating
5154100	5161580	sims rob yay this is the best drm ever um okay for people who have pirated versions
5161580	5169380	of love plus well when they play their pirated version they find um a little surprise when
5169380	5176300	they shut off their game and turn it back on um basically instead of having to you know
5176300	5180180	bypass this and that not being able to play like sure go ahead and play the game and you
5180180	5184660	get all your happy love points at the girl and yay then you start the game back up she
5184660	5191100	hates you you cannot get her to like you again you cannot get any of the girls to like you
5191100	5196980	again because they know you're a pirate and girls don't like pirates at least not in dating
5196980	5204540	sim land why won't she love me and because you're a dirty ass thief that's why and well
5204540	5209580	i'm to read some of these quotes on here i was dating her normally and when i restarted
5209580	5213740	she was pissed at me i can't get her to like me and she's always annoyed at me it's the
5213740	5218700	ultimate anti-piracy measure i tried the friend part of love plus again to get some scenes
5218700	5223340	i missed you're right she wouldn't let us become lovers after 100 days she still won't
5223340	5227380	let me become her boyfriend she completely ignores me and won't send me an email she
5227380	5233660	would never let me see your tits the events aren't happening either brutal let's see if
5233660	5238860	the developer hates you the girls hate you too what a surprise and it's written into
5238860	5245780	the game as copy production dark soccer would you show your boobs to a pirate depends have
5245780	5255420	you shown your boobs to a pirate yo-ho depends i've done keep in mind i've i've done some
5255420	5259820	interesting things mardi gras did come from my hometown i i know i know uh look let's
5259820	5266420	not go there um but this reminds me of this shirt would be easy to do it well no no no
5266420	5270060	why are you guys saying that while we're trying to do a show i was i was cleaning out my closet
5270060	5273500	and i found the shirt and it's too big for me because it was from when i was 20 pounds
5273500	5277960	heavier i just want to point out before the show tonight dark soccer was reading a story
5277960	5281660	about all these like disneyland myths or things like that one of the things she was talking
5281660	5285720	about was flash mountain where which i guess is still a website that's operational which
5285720	5290340	is all the ladies at disneyland that like to show their stuff while they're on splash
5290340	5294940	mountain i almost called it flash mountain and i'm every time i see that i'm like yeah
5294940	5298960	i have a friend that would do that not jamie somebody else but i would never do that at
5298960	5303940	disneyland rob not at disneyland but at mardi gras no no no no no because mobile mardi
5303940	5307740	gras does not have boob flashing i mean it does but it's sort of like what the crap are
5307740	5313340	you doing show my boobs right now you're not remembering seriously you didn't really like
5313340	5320380	you're being stupid we don't care about your tits we want moon pies i'm remembering the
5320380	5325620	the gabriel lacey skit were they flashed oh yeah and they thought that it were were a
5325620	5330220	couple women because they look like sexy bitches because they're man boobs i want to see real
5330220	5334140	quick it reminded me that whole little story of i i know we've covered it on the show before
5334140	5340060	the earthbound uh copy protection or whatever it was where the game got harder if you pirated
5340060	5343700	it there would be like yeah four times as many monsters in the last and self in the
5343700	5350220	last battle it freezes you truly cannot comprehend the true form of the attack because it deletes
5350220	5356220	your fucking save file that's brutal well i mean if you're gonna pirate a game however
5356220	5360500	i would love to see the people who got that far with it and you know i want to see a rom
5360500	5365480	hack where you can play it that difficult and beat the game i think it's been done okay
5365480	5370760	people just get around this copy protection it won't take long but no but i think it's
5370760	5374380	fun that that's what they do because they recognize it's gonna happen let's just make
5374380	5378960	their lives a little bit of hell for you know until they figure it out by then we'll hit
5378960	5384380	our sails we're done we also had a story um not too long ago probably about four or five
5384380	5389140	months ago about the whole batman arkham asylum had been pirated and uh apparently in the
5389140	5393960	pirated version of the game one of the and i'm trying to go from memory here so forgive
5393960	5397780	me if i screw this up one of the like jump types was missing or there was a puzzle that
5397780	5402480	couldn't be finished and a guy went on the forums to complain about it and the creators
5402480	5407180	of the game or the forum moderators basically said yeah you're playing a pirated version
5407180	5410400	of the game because uh we kind of you know did that on purpose in the pirated version
5410400	5414940	of the game ban no that's because he complained about it before the game was released and
5414940	5419080	it's kind of that wasn't what the story was it was it was the feature that gave him away
5419080	5424140	yeah that was that it was it was that he was complaining about it before the game was released
5424140	5430380	that was stupid there are people you get advanced copies all the time and and i legitimately
5430380	5436300	too rob that was about as stupid as the uh guy who complained on the steam forums that
5436300	5442140	he got banned for uh what was told to him was an undetectable hack and i shouldn't be
5442140	5447060	banned because it said the hack was undetectable you should guys shouldn't have been able to
5447060	5451720	shouldn't have been able to detect it why do i get banned reverse the ban somewhere
5451720	5455820	in a lull bye have a nice day oh you should probably get your money back from that for
5455820	5460380	buying that hack that's just called an idiot somewhere in a lunchroom nerds are laughing
5460380	5467340	just an idiot it's and this one thing actually you really do dig about the sims that i mean
5467340	5473520	now i'm not playing um a all my copies are legit and registered but i download hacks
5473520	5480460	like crazy for them and the ea actually looks at you know some of the stuff that people
5480460	5485020	you know make uh modded stuff for and actually kind of incorporate those themes into their
5485020	5489900	future releases for their store well they know what happens i think the moral of the
5489900	5495980	story here is buy your games legitimately and maybe you can see some tits yeah i think
5495980	5500420	if you pay for your game legitimately and then you know there's no tits in love mod
5500420	5506580	it i'm sorry i mean the only way that you can get the patches that ea puts out is to
5506580	5511620	basically reinstall everything which i've done you know i i but i only do that when
5511620	5518140	i buy new versions but i mean but still it's i i think i like i like it better when a company
5518140	5521420	understands that it's going to happen and then they fuck with you well i agree once
5521420	5524500	you buy it you should be able to hack the shit out of it it's your copy of the game
5524500	5528020	and if you want to tear it apart go for it as long you know i don't think you should
5528020	5535340	hack it to re-upload it you know with to be free and all that but whatever let's move
5535340	5539200	on let's uh talk about release dates speaking of buying your games legitimately there's
5539200	5543580	a whole lot of games you can buy legitimately this week uh loki start us off with us including

5856700	5863100	from tagging you i hate that too i really wish you could screen that first before you
5863100	5872940	get tagged in pictures i don't like that too or at least a way that you can detag it yourself
5872940	5880860	i think you can really yeah i haven't seen it yet anyway um so games well and this is
5880860	5885500	actually you know yesterday but it's worth saying the silver lining came out woohoo um

5893140	5901940	3 um destination arcade and then the 16th puzzle quest 2 and toy story 3 the video game
5901940	5905780	which actually i was looking at the preview for that looks kind of fine my sister's been
5905780	5910140	playing it on 360 and she says it's pretty fun i actually was listening to another podcast
5910140	5913820	on the drive down here and one of their caller or whatever was saying good things about it
5913820	5919460	too so um it was sounds like it might be better than you think as far as movie tie-in games
5919460	5924500	go i've tried out is that it dark soccer yeah all right well then let's get back into some
5924500	5931240	news loki yes um there has been a trial date or at least a couple trial dates set for the
5931240	5938000	infinity ward suit you may remember of course uh the founders of infinity ward were um forcefully
5938000	5945560	departed from their company and uh are now suing for uh royalties that were unpaid uh
5945560	5952920	the lawsuit will take place on may 23rd uh 2011 and there's also supposed to be another
5952920	5958220	uh hearing on august 5th to determine whether a third lawsuit filed by employees of infinity
5958220	5963940	ward against activision should be considered with the other two lawsuits um on i guess
5963940	5970700	march 1st activision dismissed uh both west and zampella uh the creators of the called
5970700	5977340	ooze series for um alleging insubordination and breach of contract by the two and of course
5977340	5983380	they're suing seeking 36 million dollars in unpaid royalties and alleging activision rigged
5983380	5989040	an investigation into their conduct to um find a pretext to fire them uh activision
5989040	5994780	fired or filed a counter suit against the two and of course since then they've created
5994780	5999700	the uh respawn entertainment studio and there's i believe at least 40 of the employees have
5999700	6005060	uh kind of moved over to their new studio as well i think i know what activision activision
6005060	6010900	could do about it they gotta hire your hire that lawyer you had to deal with god that's
6010900	6015640	the case dude that that i'm serious if that's the case that trial will take about three
6015640	6020980	years to complete cuz that guy is slow and confusing and will not help them out in one
6020980	6025140	bit and not only are that they can afford more money or you know afford a better lawyer
6025140	6032060	than that cuz the theory was going around uh the jury panel is somehow they think that
6032060	6037900	she was related to him the defense rests like jury hibernates like he's uh he's an uncle
6037900	6042920	or something because there's no way you would pay good money for a lawyer like that he was
6042920	6049260	terrible can't we all just get along no i wish i could have recorded that trial just
6049260	6056980	to so people can understand the kind of pain and suffering i you know was affected by um
6056980	6063460	i should sue her for the pain suffering that's wrong no it was seriously such a waste of
6063460	6068340	time all right well uh i'm sure there's gonna be lots of i i can't believe it's actually
6068340	6073660	going to trial most of this stuff usually gets settled i hope it's on court tv or maybe
6073660	6076780	e will do some reenactments remember during the michael jackson trial when he did the
6076780	6080420	reenactments that was the best stuff ever it's about gaming companies nobody gives a
6080420	6092380	shit yeah i guess that's true but you know all right uh let's move on and uh talk about
6092380	6098340	uh this interesting little story about roger ebert um which i find kind of interesting
6098340	6103020	because uh you know he was kind of a few years ago no it actually wasn't a few years ago
6103020	6106900	probably about a year ago he made this post about video games are not art and can never
6106900	6112860	be art he's basically saying you know video games are not art and he took a lot of crap
6112860	6117340	from people that were like you know well what about flower what about shadow of the colossus
6117340	6121060	what about you know all these other great games that you know you're not really giving
6121060	6126220	a fair shot to um well roger ebert actually came out and this is actually kind of in the
6126220	6130140	week we were gone but it was worth mentioning here saying um i was a fool for mentioning
6130140	6134700	video games in the first place i would never express an opinion on a movie i hadn't seen
6134700	6139460	so he did make kind of like a if you will like a retraction post but i didn't when i
6139460	6143620	read it i didn't really see it as a retraction post more or less as like an olive branch
6143620	6148540	type of post would i think would be more of a fair comparison not only not only though
6148540	6154780	did he say that he shouldn't be complaining about things he's never experienced he still
6154780	6161860	doesn't want to even want uh doesn't even want to try and understand people have offered
6161860	6168780	to uh supply him with a system and games that they considered to be artful and he will he
6168780	6173540	still refuses to play them he just isn't going to make a statement about things he doesn't
6173540	6178700	want to uh experience yeah so he's one thing i think you should kind of make sure you pull
6178700	6182740	away from this he didn't come out and say okay they're art he's just saying you know
6182740	6187780	what i shouldn't have said anything it's my bad passive aggressive bullshit if you can't
6187780	6193020	say something nice don't say anything i and yeah it's very interesting that he kind of
6193020	6197460	won't play the games but you know at the same time no one has to do anything they don't
6197460	6203900	want to do no one has to do anything so there you go he's basically come out and said i'm
6203900	6207940	not going to do it so you know what i'm not going to comment on it and i was bad to comment
6207940	6212860	on it in the first place and so most people are like okay you know i never hated the guy
6212860	6216500	for what he said i mean hate would always be a strong word anyway i've you know rather
6216500	6221200	thought his opinions on movies were very interesting and so forth but you know i think yeah you
6221200	6224740	probably shouldn't make such a bold statement about something you really haven't i mean
6224740	6230940	especially games like you know the flowers and the shadow colossus and final fantasies
6230940	6235380	and more artful type of games i mean you can't just associate video games immortal combat
6235380	6241100	that would be like just associating movies with mega shark versus giant octopus i bet
6241100	6248500	ebert wouldn't appreciate that it i it still bugs me a little bit that he's choosing to
6248500	6255220	maintain his level of ignorance rather than uh accept some enlightenment that's being
6255220	6262220	offered him that's what still bugs me he's refusing to be educated and that's a lot of
6262220	6266540	people though that's that's a big failing of humanity that's what bugs me about a lot
6266540	6271500	of people to be fair the guy's got a lot of other stuff to worry about i mean it's not
6271500	6278740	no there's there's no way to be fair about it ignorance especially self-imposed ignorance
6278740	6283740	is to me unforgivable well at least he came out and said i was ignorant i shouldn't have
6283740	6287120	said anything i mean maybe he didn't say that but you know what i'm gonna choose to remain
6287120	6295100	ignorant thank you very much have a good day shut up all right teach their own uh that's
6295100	6300380	it for the news but we can't end this segment just yet we've got to get to the classic video
6300380	6306900	game of the week that's right here on the show we always take a few minutes to uh say
6306900	6312060	hey why are you not uh admiring these games from the past you should take a moment to
6312060	6317300	respect your elders and the elder games that came before you dark sakura what is tonight's
6317300	6321680	classic game of the week i think the only way we can properly do this is to play the
6321680	6323900	intro rob oh well i guess i can do that for you
6323900	6337700	it's a very quiet intro just you know i don't even know if it's going through on the feed
6337700	6342980	it's super super quiet well it's dragon's lair there you go so you want to get on to
6342980	6346980	the other stuff let me see if this one plays a little bit louder now i feel like i have
6346980	6352260	to move right really quickly yeah this one plays a little better that's just um that's
6352260	6359780	a complete uh perfect playthrough in hd so yeah the game is dragon's lair which i have
6359780	6368460	a bajillion copies of including the hd copy and i have it on sega cd and um but this game
6368460	6379860	um was out on laserdisc animated by don bluth and um you um basically as each little section
6379860	6386300	play you'd have to um tap the right direction or the right button and it would bring it
6386300	6393400	up as a little flash on the screen so you'd have to move in the correct direction based
6393400	6398460	on what it gave you and you'd have to be pretty fast i mean right at the beginning i mean
6398460	6404100	i can't tell you how many times i fell through the damn um bridge right when you're walking
6404100	6411740	into the the lair um it's also out on the iphone too just to say so um anyway about
6411740	6417500	the game you play as derk the daring to rescue princess daphne from the evil dragon slinge
6417500	6425380	and you go through it it's really straightforward also um this was one of the first arcade games
6425380	6435540	that cost 50 cents to play usually most the other games were a quarter of play and um
6435540	6442260	basically uh the game was inspired by the old text game adventure and so this is called
6442260	6450980	a graphic adventure um when uh the game came out it was basically a big sensation again
6450980	6461820	not just because of uh the fact that it was more expensive um but that uh it made games
6461820	6467180	this the game itself shut down quite a bit because it was running on a laser disc yeah
6467180	6472860	they basically were overused and really broke down and it's actually one of the you know
6472860	6479220	probably the most popular game of this type other ones that came out in um the uh series
6479220	6485580	there was uh space ace and dragon's lair 2 and even um there were a number of other ones
6485580	6492740	that were like that they even converted um the lupin movie the castle of cagliostro into
6492740	6498460	one called cliff jumper i don't think it was the same company i i can only remember getting
6498460	6505660	past the first three scenes in space ace the animation was so good i love space ace um
6505660	6510820	there's also dragon's lair 3d returned to the lair which is a 3d you know reinterpretation
6510820	6520940	of the game um they actually had um a dragon's lair movie scripted and ready to go into production
6520940	6526300	um right now though and they are doing this completely old school 2d animation but it's
6526300	6533980	um in held up in development right now there's a blu-ray version of dragon's lair um and
6533980	6539380	um they basically though had to completely go through and remaster everything clean the
6539380	6544180	cells themselves remember when they did the macross yeah um thing where they actually
6544180	6550680	extended the frames out to wider screens they're doing the same thing this this though is not
6550680	6558680	to be confused with the utterly horrible uh nes adaptation of dragon's lair this this
6558680	6562540	is the good stuff right here i want to do an aside when jamie's done because there was
6562540	6567060	a home version i replayed a lot more of than the arcade game growing up but i'll get into
6567060	6573660	that a minute um well there's also um you probably have heard princess daphne in the
6573660	6578660	background it doesn't really look very princess like she actually is just kind of ditzy and
6578660	6585220	just like a hoe she was like a who a who-er to quote my mother um but for all the other
6585220	6594500	versions that came there was um it was actually escaped from singe's castle which was a non-linear
6594500	6602220	version of it um there was a puzzle one um that came out on the old eight-bit systems
6602220	6606820	there is um the nes one the superness one called dragon's lair which was a platformer
6606820	6611660	version also space ace had a platformer version um there was a game boy one called dragon's
6611660	6618620	lair the legend which really has nothing to do with it um it's actually a port of an old
6618620	6625080	zx spectrum game called roller coaster um the game boy color version is um actually
6625080	6631280	pretty much like the original um there was dragon's lair deluxe pack there was um an
6631280	6636900	apple version the sega cd version um so talking about the old mac one from 1994 and then the
6636900	6644020	emulator daphne um where you have to have the original laserdisc and the rom file to
6644020	6649420	be able to play that or they have other versions that use mpeg 2 video streams so yeah there
6649420	6656100	are a lot of versions out just looking over the list ever since 1983 we've had i'm just
6656100	6662860	going to run off the list of different systems it's been on okay okay we've had um the arcade
6662860	6674260	uh clico adam armchair uh cpc the spectrum commodore 64 um do atari st the amiga um pc
6674260	6686020	nes game boy mac plus um atari st uh more mac sega cd 3do um mega cd or sega cd uh cdi
6686020	6697440	atari jaguar windows 95 let's see game boy color ps2 um xbox um gamecube playstation
6697440	6709140	2 mobile phone um uh blu-ray player ps3 home hd dvd players iphone dsi for dsi where the
6709140	6720100	ds psp and the we as a disc so wow and also um it had um the character dirt was battling
6720100	6726540	midlife crisis in an episode of robot chicken nice and part of the game was parodied in
6726540	6732540	family guy it was there really wasn't a lot like it i mean yeah there were those other
6732540	6735980	games you mentioned but i can't think of a lot of games that were really like this ever
6735980	6742100	if you ever thought that the concept of the quick time event was new no no dragon's lair
6742100	6749700	did it way before so it was even quicker well if dark soccer we're at the end of the game
6749700	6753740	if dark soccer is done with her piece i want to do a quick aside if i could um because
6753740	6760260	i played growing up an awful lot the commodore 64 versions of the game which were different
6760260	6764380	they were let me see if we can get some of the music here this is kind of like the you
6764380	6770800	know it was much different it took scenes inspired by the arcade game and kind of made
6770800	6775020	them like actiony things like here's that scene where the disc is kind of falling down
6775020	6779580	well instead of you know obviously they couldn't port the movie type stuff at the time so instead
6779580	6783380	they put in these little clouds and you'd have to run away as they're breathing air
6783380	6789260	this game was just as hard if not harder than the um uh arcade game that was out the snest
6789260	6794300	one terribly hard the snest one was actually kind of difficult i hated the snest version
6794300	6798900	of space ace by the way some of the music in um dragon's lair and then the sequel they
6798900	6806580	also had dragon's lair 2 escape from cinja's castle had awesome music listen to this oh
6806580	6810660	a little theme song got cut off hey it's the um the whole rapids area yeah the whole rapids
6810660	6814900	area but i love the music and the boulders area is awesome let me see if i can get to
6814900	6829740	that part here we go this is pretty cool just i mean the soundtrack to this game was awesome
6829740	6833900	and and you know it wasn't quite the arcade game but it was levels kind of inspired by
6833900	6837720	the arcade game every bit as hard i mean if i were to play this today i would i would
6837720	6841760	not be able to get very far but yeah see you have to run past the things but you're slowly
6841760	6845100	moving back the whole time and that's just you know one of the other stages and then
6845100	6851060	later on you get into you know like here's that one room this is where the thing takes
6851060	6855420	your hat and your sword and this is a little more like the arcade version where you have
6855420	6862040	to hit up at certain times but the soundtrack was just awesome if you're into that whole
6862040	6866540	old school sounding stuff so that's my little aside to the classic game of the week is that
6866540	6869760	the commodore 64 one is definitely worth your attention i just figured it was about time
6869760	6873540	we did dragon's lair it really was i'm surprised it's been i mean we've been doing the classic
6873540	6877740	game of the week for a long time right i have had a feeling that i had already done it and
6877740	6882060	then i actually went back and checked the list thank you whoever updates you know the
6882060	6891140	wiki update the rest of it um give true your money and but i it was about time it's about

7033960	7038980	some download content announced for red dead redemption kind of uh working its way through
7038980	7042840	i believe it's supposed to be through the end of september but um they don't really
7042840	7048740	have firm dates on some of the last ones and you know given the uh track record of rockstar
7048740	7053140	i'm not gonna try to speculate when they're gonna release some of these but anyways one
7053140	7059740	we do know for sure is legends and killers um which is coming august 2010 for ten dollars
7059740	7063780	and it will feature nine new multiplayer map locations eight new multiplayer characters
7063780	7069760	including some from red dead revolver new projectile weapon uh the tomahawk and corresponding
7069760	7075300	multiplayer and single player challenges and new achievements and trophies the next one
7075300	7082740	is coming at a date yet to be determined and it's called liars and cheats and it'll also
7082740	7088620	be for ten dollars um with that it's going to include a attack and defend multiplayer
7088620	7094980	competitive mode and challenges new multiplayer horse races with mounted combat which sounds
7094980	7100500	cool uh play as the heroes and the villains of red dead redemption as well as eight new
7100500	7105420	multiplayer characters multiplayer versions of liars dice and poker from the single player
7105420	7110260	game and the new weapon explosive rifle with corresponding multiplayer and single player
7110260	7117080	challenges new achievements and trophies um let's see the third expansion would be free
7117080	7122140	roam which includes additional free roam challenges new action areas and defensive placements
7122140	7128940	posse scoring and leaderboards and new anti-griefing measures in free mode um so that's coming
7128940	7135540	later on and then what game would not be awesome without zombies undead nightmare coming out
7135540	7140460	new single player adventure challenges and quests eight new multiplayer zombie characters
7140460	7145420	additional animals to hunt i can only hope there is zombie animals and a new dynamic
7145420	7154300	events and more hopefully more shotguns because every zombie hunter knows a good shotgun goes
7154300	7162620	far um other fun stuff we may have talked about this a little bit i think i've mentioned
7162620	7169380	it before uh the mega man 8-bit deathmatch which was a mod for doom 2 has now been released
7169380	7176300	in demo form and is available to the public this new mod of course kind of reskins um
7176300	7181820	doom with the wonderful 8-bit sprites and includes a different mega man power-ups as
7181820	7193040	well uh you can find this um at uh http uh let's see cut and stuff dot net slash blog
7193040	7198060	slash uh question mark p equals two two one eight i'm sure it's probably one i'm sure
7198060	7202420	everybody's writing that down real quick yeah it's uh the cutting stuff blog and uh they've
7202420	7206820	got a bunch of stuff and if you've been missing mega man legends this is as close as you're
7206820	7214580	ever gonna get yes so uh check it out looks pretty cool and then last but not least we
7214580	7219420	were talking about some psp games before the break and one of the psp games that's coming
7219420	7224500	out uh will actually be a port of split second and that'll be pretty awesome it's a cool
7224500	7229660	racing game where you get to detonate a bunch of explosions and causal sorts of mayhem and
7229660	7237820	that'll be coming out this fall all right yet another port on its way to psp enjoy that
7237820	7241740	hey i got some quick stuff for you too dragon age 2 finally some details on that it was
7241740	7247180	missing from e3 but it's dated for march 2011 that's kind of conflicting to the february
7247180	7252460	1st 2011 date that was in the dragon age origins awakening but hey at least it's kind of close
7252460	7257420	march 2011 is when this is coming out big big change from the first game um you're gonna
7257420	7262660	be playing as one character named hawk and that could be either a male or a female but
7262660	7266600	no more of this like origin story and and all this other stuff that the first dragon
7266600	7271940	age had and you you're basically going to be this one character be it like uh mass effect
7271940	7275900	where you're commander shepherd yes my favorite store in the citadel there you go so it's
7275900	7280460	kind of the same type of thing um and i guess they're trying to do that to you know make
7280460	7284700	more cinematic type of stuff where they can kind of involve hawk and the cinematics is
7284700	7291420	supposed to actually address you by name exactly so uh that is um that's their big plans for
7291420	7297700	the game i i think that could be good um but i like the some some folks are suggesting
7297700	7302260	uh you know you could name your character like hudson hawk or ethan hawk or you know
7302260	7308500	all these other hudson hawk is good just not mike anyhow uh yeah so i i don't know
7308500	7311980	i like the first game i'm curious kind of how the second game is going to play out it's
7311980	7316180	that definitely is a radical shift though i think uh the first being a little more open
7316180	7319820	in the first game really kind of drew a lot of people to that but i still think it'll
7319820	7325260	be cool another game i think will be cool that i want to play is nba jam and i'm actually
7325260	7330620	excited because according to the germans rating the german ratings board nba jam has been
7330620	7336340	classified for xbox 360 and ps3 now it's kind of weird because those weren't shown at e3
7336340	7341200	they haven't demoed it on those systems but you know these rating board stories usually
7341200	7346380	turn out to be right they kind of have to have a game to rate it well here's my thought
7346380	7353100	is that what if it's the old nba jam or something like that like coming to xbox live arcade
7353100	7358340	possible i doubt it but i mean yeah i could run into licensing issues and all that stuff
7358340	7362620	but maybe it's a port of the old arcade although then again i guess midway would have that
7362620	7368460	and you know now there's no midway maybe it's a little harder than that i don't know but
7368460	7373500	uh do you remember we were talking on this show before about the nba jam catchphrase
7373500	7379540	competition and folks can submit their own catchphrases well it's boom shaka laka well
7379540	7384220	that's already in the game but you have to come up with the next boom shaka laka and
7384220	7392220	uh these are the i guess the four that made it into the game i think um objections sustained
7392220	7401940	when you get a block shot no shoot for you i love it uh and the survey says denied on
7401940	7407580	a block and then uh i have no idea where this one comes from banga langadooda for a dunk
7407580	7415660	say what banga langadooda probably from the same place that boom shaka laka came from
7415660	7419140	i don't know it's kind of like the sequel the reject i'd like to hear a little less
7419140	7424900	a song made out of boom shaka laka and banga langadooda sounds like the singers in an 80s
7424900	7431020	hair band i don't know all right uh moving on sounds like shana a little more information
7431020	7435260	is coming out about the michael jackson based video game it's going to be called michael
7435260	7441660	jackson the experience and you will actually be able to play as michael jackson and you
7441660	7446980	get to relive his iconic performances and that would be using the move the connect or
7446980	7450980	the we and you're basically going to dance along with the prompts on the screen you can
7450980	7456300	also sing along on the xbox 360 or playstation 3 you can use the connects built-in mic to
7456300	7461420	do this there's also going to be ds and psp versions of this game it's going to be tapping
7461420	7466140	think elite beat agents that's kind of cool it's coming out in november if you want to
7466140	7470280	check this game out and boy would i pay a lot of money for youtubes of loki playing
7470280	7475700	this game we've already had a good michael jackson based game it was called moonwalker
7475700	7482180	i thought you said a good game oh it was a good game oh it depends what system you played
7482180	7489360	it on depends what system you played on all right i don't know i i would my favorite michael
7489360	7493560	jackson video game was space channel 5 i don't know about you that was a cameo that doesn't
7493560	7499080	count still i'd rather play space channel 5 than just mimic him you know what i mean
7499080	7504140	like i don't know there's just i would i hope there's more to it than that but we'll see
7504140	7514140	dark sakura well we have some definite news in our music games we have for a rock band
7514140	7525160	we've got um stuff by sweet sorry i get that sweet billy pilgrim we have get out he's a
7525160	7532020	rocker orange amber i'm sorry that's uh the vines pack my apologies my apologies um for
7532020	7536820	the vines pack we have get out he's a rocker orange amber out of the way and ride and then
7536820	7544640	sweet billy pilgrim uh future perfect tense and of course these are um basically buck
7544640	7547940	90 90 piece
7547940	7554580	whoo buck 99 and um for dj hero we actually have some good news that the sales are up
7554580	7560580	to 1.2 million units that's pretty good even though i've seen them clearance at fries well
7560580	7566740	so much for all y'all who said it was a flop you know what it took price reduction but
7566740	7573180	um it was actually considered considered the best-selling ip of 2009 by revenue yeah keyword
7573180	7578580	is by revenue because they're like 100 and some dollars each yeah but wait to spin those
7578580	7582820	really start selling till it had a big price drop and then it started selling yeah at least
7582820	7586620	they've figured it out for the next release so they're not going to be charging quite
7586620	7592380	as much it's going to be a little bit more like guitar hero prices still expensive well
7592380	7596800	speaking of guitar hero we actually do have download music for guitar hero 5 and band
7596800	7602340	hero we have the queen 2 track pack which is crazy little thing called love killer queen
7602340	7608240	and somebody to love um that's on july well it's already out then july 6 july 13th avenged
7608240	7614020	seven fold afterlife almost easy and scream july 20th disturbed tri pack down with a sickness
7614020	7620540	trick and indestructible whatever that's my impression of disturbed except for the really
7620540	7629900	good cover i thought it was it's just what it is except they did a really good cover
7629900	7635780	of land of confusion a really good song um and then shine down on july 27th with devour
7635780	7641820	second chance sound of madness all i heard was queen and everything after that was blah
7641820	7649020	blah blah i know it's queen all right if that's it for the rapid fire news then i think it
7649020	7656340	might be time for us to get into some twitter topics every week we ask for your tweets at
7656340	7662340	twitter.com slash o l r and we read some of our favorite tweets here on the program we
7662340	7667100	didn't we hardly got any tonight maybe i wasn't soliciting early enough in advance oh well
7667100	7671340	uh you can always count on tiger claws submit a few good stories so tiger claw 305 on twitter
7671340	7677320	sends us a few stories here um i like this one this has to do with google and i had no
7677320	7681620	idea about this until tiger claw uh kind of linked this and this has to do with a big
7681620	7688380	investment that google uh made in zinga apparently according to this report and i'm reading from
7688380	7695700	gamasutra here google quietly invested between 100 million and 200 million in zinga as part
7695700	7701580	of its preparation to launch google games later this year because you know google's
7701580	7708820	got to get all up on everything whatever happened to google's philosophy of don't be evil google
7708820	7714900	zinga no that's true zinga's kind of evil but i i would be curious how it would operate
7714900	7719060	into google's philosophy i don't know but here's uh google itself apparently closed
7719060	7723060	the investment and it happened about a month ago and that was on a report from tech crunch
7723060	7728260	um part of the partnership will entail zinga's games serving as the cornerstone for search
7728260	7734100	giant google games platform which is rumored to launch later this year they haven't said
7734100	7738740	any information about it uh what's interesting though that doesn't necessarily mean you're
7738740	7743860	just going to have farmville frontierville and fishville and what the fuckville all on
7743860	7751480	google games i love what the fuckville stripperville who wouldn't play stripperville hornville needs
7751480	7761220	bounce houses maybe there will be new games that come on to google games who knows if
7761220	7766420	if there's anyone that they would want to invest in you know better options i would
7766420	7772780	say i don't know congregate much better place and you know well i'm just saying much better
7772780	7779020	developers too how many freaking people are playing farmville a lot a lot more than we're
7779020	7783740	playing wow right i know hate if you want but this is it's just like it's just like
7783740	7788140	hating on the we you can hate it all you want at the end of the day it's still the most
7788140	7795780	popular selling system you can't that is a fact you facebook isn't even a gaming system
7795780	7801300	but more people play games there than they do on consoles probably i don't have those
7801300	7805500	numbers to back it up but i'm pretty sure uh when you add up all those uh soccer moms
7805500	7809820	playing farmville yeah it's probably more than her fragging on the halo 3 sorry to say
7809820	7819000	it that's just how it is i i work with a lot of people that play these games a lot of co-workers
7819000	7825640	but you know they don't really know the video games i play it's just i don't know crazy
7825640	7829300	i'd be i'd be very curious to see how this all plays out though with google games because
7829300	7833420	of the fact that you know google has this philosophy of don't be evil but then again
7833420	7838500	buzz was kind of evil like there was some they made some horrible missteps with buzz
7838500	7844140	i wish internet companies would just learn their freaking lesson with privacy don't you
7844140	7849860	one more from tiger claw for us as i uh want to mention this steve weeby you remember him
7849860	7854940	the king of kong did he finally get it well no but he got something else that's pretty
7854940	7859320	cool um he's going to be inducted into the international video game hall of fame cool
7859320	7864540	and uh don't forget it's that doctor or dentist guy hank chien has it now it's not even billy
7864540	7868700	mitchell remember a few few months ago that doctor or dentist or whatever he's in he's
7868700	7874660	the king of kong now well anyhow steve weeby though um he's you know still uh he's still
7874660	7879180	obviously acknowledged as a great gamer um he's going to be joining 28 other people including
7879180	7889980	miyamoto and pac-man that's going to be uh i guess built in get this otuma otumwa iowa
7889980	7894340	ottumwa iowa i can't even pronounce this name but you may have heard of this uh city before
7894340	7897700	this is where they're trying to build the international video game hall of fame they
7897700	7902800	want to make this place like the video game capital or whatever i don't and i don't remember
7902800	7906300	all the stories behind it but it wasn't there was like a really famous photo shoot back
7906300	7911060	in the 80s that took place there i remember hearing about and i don't know just it's just
7911060	7916460	because no one's claimed it yet so this town that has nobody there's no reason to go there
7916460	7921900	there's a story behind it i'm sure there is and i don't care what it is but i i refuse
7921900	7925420	to believe that you're going to be the capital of shatter a chatter will fill me in well
7925420	7929900	the part i remember was that you can't even reach it unless it's like a three-hour drive
7929900	7937260	from a nearby airport i mean that's something else it's iowa yeah someday i will make claim
7937260	7941940	to that same thing and do it better monty boggs says that's inside the international
7941940	7948120	house of pancakes actually is the international house of gaming frisbee asks isn't that the
7948120	7953940	home of twin galaxies uh could be that might be the connection i'm not sure i always thought
7953940	7958620	the guy from twin galaxies had an office i don't know why pennsylvania jumps out of my
7958620	7963660	mind but it does or somewhere in silicon silicon valley at least i don't know anyhow sponge
7963660	7968780	twang uh since it's a tweet uh clarifying some stuff about the big battle um apparently
7968780	7973940	the battlefield bad company 2 competition was rescheduled also he has noticed a super
7973940	7977740	street fighter 4 banner has leaked its way into the rotation so i don't know if derek
7977740	7982100	just hasn't announced anything yet but it looks like your super street fighter 4 might
7982100	7987140	be uh be able to battle on that now i know you kids play that game so you got to get
7987140	7990780	it on that if i was super enough for that i'd join in but i don't have super street
7990780	7995180	fighter 4 it doesn't you know oh okay i was gonna say i'm terrible at super street fighter
7995180	7999060	4 but if that's one of the games i'll play it just just to do it you know it's not about
7999060	8005760	winning it's about having fun i put dan the man up on top of the charts s21 under matt
8005760	8011460	says that he thinks it's the hometown of walter day won't why does that make it the capital
8011460	8017580	of video oh whatever that's a whole other rant uh dark tetsuya last tweet says uh since
8017580	8024100	i didn't hear anything in part a thoughts on ddr x2 ac oh yeah i haven't played it yet
8024100	8027100	but i don't think it's out there yet i think it's still being tested apparently a bunch
8027100	8031940	of old school dance mania tracks came back like captain jack is back in the game if you
8031940	8035860	were here by jennifer is back in the game like all these old ass ddr songs are now back
8035860	8042620	in ddr and apparently led remixed some of the dance mania songs wait what that's sweet
8042620	8048180	there's like an if you were here remixed by led that's kind of neat but i hate to say
8048180	8053500	it i'm kind of over ddr like i'm more interested in dance masters at this point and and dance
8053500	8062180	central i know i know get me away i think i might catch that ddr just hasn't been interesting
8062180	8071260	for a little while sorry it's kind of how i feel i played the um um i can't even think
8071260	8077980	of the name of the damn game the korean push the pump it up no push the screen game dj
8077980	8083740	max technica that's it i played that and that's more interesting to me right now than ddr
8083740	8087660	sorry all right that's it for twitter topics if you want to send us some tweets in the
8087660	8094420	future twitter.com slash olr meanwhile back to the news loki yes soon you'll be able to
8094420	8101180	get some anime on your xbox apparently microsoft is teaming up with the video streaming portal
8101180	8109700	crunchyroll and apparently the expansion is going to be a partnership with microsoft for
8109700	8115380	the zune marketplace and this will bring a popular anime title such as the melancholy
8115380	8124860	of um haruhi uh suzamiya and the and uh giant killing to the xbox 360 zune hd and windows
8124860	8131340	pcs and um that's kind of neat i guess giant killing is notable because it's airing in
8131340	8138460	japan right now and this will be the uh first time these title have been available for digital
8138460	8145500	download purchase interesting because um uh doesn't the ps3 have a huge anime library
8145500	8150780	with it i think they they do have some anime um on there i could have sworn they tried
8150780	8156020	testing it out with uh queen's blade and then didn't realize it was such an adult themed
8156020	8163140	anime i saw that story too that's funny was did this news come out of anime expo because
8163140	8167040	i know that was a huge thing that just happened this last week and and maybe that's where
8167040	8173260	some of this is coming from but i don't know i i i don't watch a lot of anime so i i feel
8173260	8178100	so apathetic about this uh is there anything uh you guys in chat are you guys excited about
8178100	8183320	this i'm looking here chat dot orange launch radio dot com um rama says i don't support

8626780	8634060	were we thinking all right back to video game news i just had the what the hell are we doing
8634060	8638700	moment tiger oh and i didn't even bother to cut it at the perforation i just pulled it
8638700	8643160	right out of it that's ghetto tiger claw says sky for a second i thought you would say bobby
8643160	8649900	would have uranus no i can i can think of other podcasts i can have that all right anyhow
8649900	8655420	let's move on uh i want to talk about back to gaming news i know hard to believe let's
8655420	8660900	talk about this this has to do with connectimals you know you guys connectimals they're cute
8660900	8666960	you know cuddly and uh you're gonna soon find out more about them at burger king that's
8666960	8671740	right not only is microsoft and it's kind of a side story apparently microsoft is teaming
8671740	8677420	up with macy's to show connect certain places they're also going to be teaming up with burger
8677420	8683320	king uh so you're going to actually get little stuffed animals that can be scanned by the
8683320	8689780	connects camera to create the same animal in the game and then you can have them interact
8689780	8696200	with your regular pet connectimal and there you go so so instead of the bk games we were
8696200	8699980	hearing about now you're going to get little mini connectimals or whatever the problem
8699980	8705260	is it's just going to be a little card that will easily be scanned and posted on the internet
8705260	8709820	so you don't even have to buy these if they were smart since the connect can you scan
8709820	8713740	in objects they should actually do the stuffed animal like you'd have to actually have a
8713740	8719180	picture of the stuffed animal well i mean how long is it going to be though before there's
8719180	8724520	just an internet page with all the barcodes so after you stuff your face with a triple
8724520	8728800	whopper you can go and move around a little bit on connect that's what i love about this
8728800	8732660	i mean at least it's connectimals and not dance central but that would crack me up if
8732660	8737380	like dance central had a tie-in with burger king this was like the old barcode scanner
8737380	8742820	games that were out in japan remember it was like one particular brand of ramen was like
8742820	8747420	would make these this ultimate monster and everyone was buying out this one brand of
8747420	8756060	ramen e reader for life they did the same thing with vivo pinata and um in fact people
8756060	8760900	started hacking the actual codes and unlocked more animals that didn't they didn't give
8760900	8767580	away um you know stuff that wasn't in the game so or at least it was in the game but
8767580	8773660	never released for the game interesting though microsoft is very aggressive with the marketing
8773660	8779460	for this thing they really really want it to take off i mean burger king macy's and
8779460	8787820	you know in their own stores whereas you know what's where's playstation move advertising
8787820	8791780	granted it's a little early so maybe a little closer to release we'll see a more accelerated
8791780	8798380	campaign maybe commercials on tv and all that other fun stuff but so far microsoft is definitely
8798380	8801760	getting aggressive with this but they kind of have to be i mean if connect fails that's
8801760	8807940	going to be a real sad little footnote in microsoft's history we'll see though meanwhile
8807940	8814620	dark sakura i i i i am just still laughing because i put the picture oh did you use the
8814620	8821900	picture i put it in the chat room nice appreciate that oh our plushies all right so now you
8821900	8825360	know it's official you're listening to the official video game podcast of the galaxy
8825360	8830560	well rock band three has decided to do something nice for all those people who can't hold a
8830560	8843340	tune to save their fucking life um it um has uh harmonics and uh isotope um have uh done
8843340	8849540	a real-time pitch correction basically they have autotune um it's gonna put everybody
8849540	8853980	into the right key when it plays through so that they don't sound like crap now what i
8853980	8858060	want to do i have this one friend who actually have a couple friends who are intensely tone
8858060	8868200	deaf enough that it makes my um my liver quiver um that rhymed i know but um i would like
8868200	8874600	to see if actually can make these people who are so unbelievably tone deaf hold a key is
8874600	8880640	i don't know if anyone knows this little fact about me i hear perfect pitch and it drives
8880640	8886180	me completely nuts because it's even worse when i sing and hear myself got a tune i listening
8886180	8893580	to somebody else go just cannot being able to hold a tune makes me nauseous literally
8893580	8899620	nauseous um how do you feel about this then where everybody's gonna be fixed on the on
8899620	8905660	the fly i love you harmonics and isotope but you know you know it's not gonna fix the fact
8905660	8910780	that you can still hear them in the same yeah they're still gonna make things sound horrible
8910780	8915420	anyway it's not a really an autotune it's more of a because they actually do have autotuners
8915420	8922660	that aren't the the digital sounding autotune they'll do wave modulation plus i think if
8922660	8926020	you want to get really into the science of it and all autotunes like a post-production
8926020	8931260	thing and this is a in production basically they're available in almost any recording
8931260	8937020	studio i mean how come do you think some people just sound like crap live it's a bummer though
8937020	8940140	you're not going to be able to hear the voices over the internet i mean at the same time
8940140	8942980	maybe that's a blessing but i think there's some people that wouldn't mind you know being
8942980	8946320	able to sing i understand that with the lag and the time and everything it's probably
8946320	8951600	not possible although what would be wrong with maybe having the singer start five seconds
8951600	8955380	before the rest of the band just well i guess i guess maybe with the scoring system wouldn't
8955380	8962200	really work out i really have the voice play on a replay hmm maybe i really though um i
8962200	8966820	think it would be nice if this is an option that you could turn off but certainly you
8966820	8971300	know i think that the option to turn it on should be on the other player's side if you're
8971300	8975640	doing this on the internet for people like me who can't stand to listen to people be
8975640	8980700	out of tune i don't think they actually do a person's voice over the internet for like
8980700	8985020	rock band because it can't they don't have the bandwidth to stream that which is the
8985020	8990360	problem um so you never hear voices you do hear guitar and stuff but you never hear voice
8990360	8994660	well because the guitar is just bits and bytes on or off pass or fail basically but uh voice
8994660	8999940	is it's too much bandwidth for it to handle although you could always just do party chat
8999940	9003660	and do it that way but you know true you know one little bit it'll be delayed it's it's
9003660	9007780	because i've played rock band with a singer who didn't put their mic their regular mic
9007780	9011700	on mute and it was delayed and it actually can really throw you off when you're trying
9011700	9016740	to play guitar or something else um one thing i had predicted for rock band three that didn't
9016740	9020240	end up happening or at least not yet anyway was that they were going to go more the sing
9020240	9024740	star route of being able to share your performances and being able to you know have that community
9024740	9029960	of uh your youtube-esque uh sharing of performances who knows maybe that's still in the cards
9029960	9033800	for the future although i kind of doubt it at this point um this would have kind of added
9033800	9038220	to that though in a way a little more professional touch to it i'll tell you one thing i actually
9038220	9044580	did like about um rock band is at least playing it on easier difficulties it gives a person
9044580	9051060	who is actually a singer more room to have fun with the song like for example you've
9051060	9058180	heard becky sing i'm not sure maybe like once so like a rock band thing but she's got a
9058180	9062860	crazy powerful voice she's a little more classically trained right i can't remember she does she
9062860	9067300	does tend to edge more towards the classically trim but she can belt them out she can she
9067300	9073140	can really sing she's got a great voice and i i like having things at the lower level
9073140	9076660	you know when she's playing because then it won't make her fail the song for having fun
9076660	9081580	with it i can see donna just ask the listeners of understation live no i can't believe that
9081580	9088180	you and tiara got me singing abba rock band oh that was fun and that i actually did listening
9088180	9093940	i don't think so tiara tiara tiara come back to sacramento because we need to make jamie
9093940	9097500	play abba it was not abba rock band by the way sing star abba that's what i was talking
9097500	9103100	about sing star abba i just can't believe that i actually did good at it it's fun yeah
9103100	9107820	i need to get uh sing star queen now that it's uh discounted i would play that but you're
9107820	9113140	right expert doesn't give a lot of leeway for stuff like i don't know vibrato no but
9113140	9117700	you know um remember when karaoke revolution was coming out and how it was pretty forgiving
9117700	9123240	here the japanese versions because i've had friends who had the japanese versions they
9123240	9129300	are evil that you have to pronounce everything perfectly you have to be dead pitch on you
9129300	9133200	can't just mumble your way through it and as long as you hit the key you're fine you
9133200	9137460	actually have to fully pronounce everything right because japanese itself can be pretty
9137460	9143380	precise i played that terrible karaoke revolution glee game that was at e3 it was very forgiving
9143380	9147820	granted i was playing it on the easiest level but you you could just uh your way through
9147820	9152020	it and probably pass it see this one thing that i was thinking about in with the different
9152020	9156460	games you know from area to area where you have because i'd have to say japanese is a
9156460	9163020	very precise language really english especially american english i'm sorry is just well english
9163020	9170040	all over the place is just has so many variables that i really think that they they even the
9170040	9176340	harder difficulties of them should have more of a allowance i am really curious to see
9176340	9179620	how this new vocal system plays out though i'm really interested too because i know i'm
9179620	9184100	probably gonna get it yeah i know i gotta get rock band rock band's awesome uh all right
9184100	9187660	couple more stories for you guys than the mailbag and the fus of the week and then the
9187660	9192620	skype line your call is a 1877 game olr and a little bit here at orange lounge radio but
9192620	9199180	first some news from loki uh yes dead rising 2 they've announced a special edition for
9199180	9204900	europe uh called the outbreak pack and uh with it you're gonna be getting uh some pretty
9204900	9212060	cool tchotchkes actually it looks like a zombie figurine a surf bot head which i'm only assuming
9212060	9217960	goes on the zombie and a cone which also can go on the head of the zombie i'm assuming
9217960	9227460	and um looks like uh let's see a voucher for a premium theme and some other console specific
9227460	9232900	items as well i do love the little surf bot head for the zombie that's that's pretty awesome
9232900	9238540	it is pretty awesome um of course they announced that this is not coming out over here of course
9238540	9243580	not at all thankfully though we do have something coming out over here and this hasn't really
9243580	9249980	been announced yet but i do know what's actually in the special edition it's not that exciting
9249980	9255620	actually it's kind of standard special edition fair a lot of zombrex um theme stuff you know
9255620	9263140	zombrex being the actual i don't know if it's the virus or the you know anti-zombie medication
9263140	9267480	or something but a lot of stuff kind of based on that you get a prescription pad which i'm
9267480	9275020	assuming is just a notepad uh you get an investor's brochure uh which is kind of funny uh you
9275020	9285340	get a poster um also you get a avatar item for the xbox 360 version and a premium dynamic
9285340	9292280	theme for the playstation 3 version uh behind the scenes documentary of the making of dead
9292280	9298460	rising 2 and then of course the whole thing comes in a steelbook case that slips on um
9298460	9307160	the actual game so i'll be coming out the end of september now for 79.99 oh that's a
9307160	9311880	lot of money for a game i guess you get all that other cool stuff with it but still i
9311880	9315260	didn't you know i liked dead rising 1 but i really didn't play enough of it that's one
9315260	9319140	of those games i really need to go back and revisit because pretty cool and dead rising
9319140	9324300	2 is kind of more the same but not in a bad way like crackdown 2 people are making selling
9324300	9327500	more of the same it's kind of a bad thing but i had a lot of fun with it i'm surprised
9327500	9332380	they didn't put dead rising like theme duct tape or something like that in there because
9332380	9338040	you know the main part of the game is actually yeah yeah yeah i think i saw what i see a
9338040	9344180	baseball bat get duct taped with nails on the demo i played pretty cool okay uh i want
9344180	9348620	to talk about this that uh was floating around some of the blogs this week and it made designer
9348620	9353660	ben marsh a little bit famous this week because these aren't real okay guys but he put out
9353660	9361300	some designs there for video game condoms that's right it's video game packaging themed
9361300	9371460	condoms with such lovely names as donkey schlong and dong like pong but dong uh sextress um
9371460	9375200	the long dick of zelda i think that says i can't really see what this says super mario
9375200	9381240	land of love all these lovely little uh video game themed and i love this there's like little
9381240	9386640	variety packs there they have but kind of a serious theme here to this because uh he
9386640	9392580	says here the packaging aims to create a desire to purchase the product for aesthetic reasons
9392580	9401020	rather than the necessity of condoms simply by owning the product safer sex is promoted
9401020	9406020	interesting i did does anyone have a feeling on this do you think this would promote safe
9406020	9410220	sex because people buy it for the joke of it but then like you know if the time comes
9410220	9417580	where it's time to go iraq and hey you're prepared um it would never fly in the first
9417580	9421180	place because the game companies would never let this be you know put out but assuming
9421180	9427220	that he was able to create a generic enough concept um i suppose people might buy that
9427220	9434860	um but at the same time you know you don't see a lot of gaming related stuff to sex selling
9434860	9439980	i mean you don't see a lot of people buying you know the fake vaginas for those um you
9439980	9444300	know sex games that they have in japan you'll see people's stories hey look at that that's
9444300	9449100	from a game you know people look at you funny um as people would look at you funny if you
9449100	9457340	had a box for you know donkey schlong on your your bone zone too bone zone too yeah um it'd
9457340	9462780	be fun gag gifts for people but it would never make it past the stigma that gamers don't
9462780	9467260	get laid yeah that whole gag gift thing i could see myself getting like eight boxes
9467260	9475460	of these for my birthday and it would be like it was funny the first time seven of them
9475460	9482540	would be from loki no you know what i mean though sometimes with gag gifts if there's
9482540	9486140	like a certain one that speaks to you like i'll tell you this one time for christmas
9486140	9493860	i kid you not i got the survivor board game three times sure did the hell got the survivor
9493860	9497620	board game three times one christmas the the first year survivor was big and everyone knew
9497620	9503420	i watched it every week so all right how about we get to another segment here on the show
9503420	9513460	called the mailbag yay every week you guys send us your emails mailbag at orange lounge
9513460	9518260	radio dot com and dark soccer dives in head first and picks a few of her favorites and
9518260	9522660	reads them for you here on the show she's back to doing the mailbag this week hooray
9522660	9528020	next week i get to do it drug yay so definitely send her lots of emails for next week mailbag
9528020	9532320	at orange lounge radio dot com by the way i want to say real quick akuma jp says he's
9532320	9539620	actually seen these in akihabara akihabara i'm sorry to say they're wrong okay that'd
9539620	9545980	be that big tech store in japan there's a whole it's it's a section of it's a district
9545980	9554340	oh okay yeah nice anyway hey olr crew azhp here i'm sure rob has got this on show roll
9554340	9558620	but i had to throw my two cents in for what it's worth blizzard is going to use real id
9558620	9563500	for their forums now yeah we already bypassed that but here's i'm going to continue here's
9563500	9567900	a quote from blizzard removing the veil of anonymity typical to online dialogue will
9567900	9572260	contribute to a more positive form environment promote constructive conversations and connect
9572260	9576540	the blizzard community in ways they haven't been connected before really do they think
9576540	9579980	that flamers will stop just because their name is being shown belligerent people will
9579980	9584300	still be belligerent only now they'll know just who they are arguing with and can go
9584300	9589620	to their house and stab them if they don't agree anyway i thought the point of wow was
9589620	9593760	that you could get away from your real life not have it follow you around and haunt your
9593760	9598380	every move and wow what if i don't want my co-workers knowing that i post on the wow
9598380	9603460	forums while i'm supposed to be on the clock not that i do i don't even play wow excuse
9603460	9609780	me this is just ridiculous and i have a feeling that this move is going to be one of the worst
9609780	9613460	blizzard has ever made just wondering what you guys think about this travesty i hope
9613460	9617500	i'll hope it all goes away soon yours truly is hp written and sent while i'm supposed
9617500	9622660	to be on the clock ps this will make dark sakura laugh or cry i'm not sure which basically
9622660	9628740	the biggest travesty in superhero mashups ever make sure she sees this on the show okay
9628740	9636580	all right oh it's clearly is it a video oh no it's a what it's a toy box i'm trying
9636580	9642980	to describe this on the radio bootleg superheroes superheroes justice league with spider-man
9642980	9650300	batman naruto naruto and iron man iron man all together malfunction malfunction does
9650300	9655380	not compute what the fuck by the way i have to commend you on your mostly perfect grammar
9655380	9659020	and spelling actually your spelling was pretty pretty good i think everybody missed a couple
9659020	9663180	of punctuation points i think everybody can agree that naruto is the greatest superhero
9663180	9668940	ever known can i find something you throw it loki where's the triple throw the triple
9668940	9675220	i prefer goddamn batman on twitter actually i don't know if you've ever seen goddamn batman's
9675220	9679340	and then there's gosh dang robin or something like that he's a goddamn batman there's goddamn
9679340	9685260	batman and gosh dang robin we can't forget the juggernaut bitch all righty how obviously
9685260	9690740	we already kind of ran it about real id early in the show but thankfully uh azhp the that
9690740	9694700	part i think you were really concerned about did go away but it hasn't all gone away let's
9694700	9700620	not forget i'm still gleefully looking at the decree and shiny silver how's it feel
9700620	9707340	to be on the official video game podcast of the galaxy hell yeah anyway next up um it's
9707340	9715260	labeled choose your world words carefully in this article on ign uk um sony shuhei yoshida
9715260	9720460	sorry yoshida claims this year is the first time we are able to cover the cost of the
9720460	9725260	playstation 3 he told ign we aren't making huge money from hardware but we aren't bleeding
9725260	9731100	like we used to i believe he is telling the truth but it says the ps3 is sold at profit
9731100	9736660	not that the ps3 program is profitable i expect this will take another eight to ten years
9736660	9742900	if at all it's just that now each console digs them a little bit out of the debt hole
9742900	9747820	i've also got more questions complaints about the ea game pass thing since i'm typically
9747820	9752380	not an online gamer shouldn't i get a refund of ten dollars on that new ea game i mean
9752380	9757100	if they allowed me to re to turn in the code for rebate it would make the entire thing
9757100	9761800	a lot more reasonable in theory if the code is still unused the game should be worth ten
9761800	9767640	dollars on more on resale but how do you prove it is still good and i bet the initial pack
9767640	9771980	in codes will be deleted after a year two there's really a lot more screwing of the
9771980	9777780	customer than is obvious hope you have a happy independence day rubba you know also if the
9777780	9781540	this can actually be considered part of president's way you probably could actually get away with
9781540	9788460	it my laptop for example if i had never booted windows on it and installed linux i could
9788460	9794740	have gotten a refund from dell for 200 bucks and my laptop was 350 oh wow yeah as long
9794740	9802580	as you never load windows on them and prove that you have never loaded windows on it that
9802580	9808220	you basically installed you know what launched right into linux or something then you get
9808220	9811900	your money back it's a bummer that the resellers don't have some type of application to see
9811900	9817220	if the code has been run or not but then again probably the whole point of this is to really
9817220	9822540	circumvent the resellers even though gamestop supposedly on board yeah but then someone
9822540	9827620	could you know malicious could get that code verifier and start typing in random codes
9827620	9831380	to see if there's one that hasn't been used or not used it'll you know give you invalid
9831380	9837740	or unused code and they're like oh hey look free so just so you guys know here in studio
9837740	9843020	apparently winapp has frozen and the stream has died yay so we gotta uh come right back
9843020	9848620	up here so we're gonna hope that um the rest of the computer doesn't shut down here but
9848620	9852740	we're gonna try and keep going here um don't read the next email just yet dark sakura somebody

9877300	9880900	were down no i'm just kidding uh i don't know why the stream just decided to drop well i
9880900	9885840	do know why because everyone winamp froze and i don't know why winamp froze that was

9941760	9946340	that don't have game in the title like i guess there's of course bobby blackwolf doesn't
9946340	9950740	have game in the title dead pixel live i guess doesn't have game in it but it still you know
9950740	9955260	pixel is kind of game what other all-game shows are there under sedation live but they

9974220	9979100	thing we were bimani podcast to start off we named it after a bimani band orange lounge
9979100	9986000	orange lounge radio the end while on the part although we the name orange launch stuck because
9986000	9991340	we wanted to kind of evoke that image of we're lounging around talking about games because
9991340	9995260	the whole idea brand yeah it's kind of like uh you know we used to go to this restaurant
9995260	9999300	called brooke fields it was right in the parking lot of the old people restaurant yeah oh god
9999300	10002420	i'm after a long night of gaming we just sit around and talk shit about games and that's
10002420	10007180	what we wanted our show to be and rick would always order his merlot i always remembered
10007180	10011820	that rick would always order his merlot and those cheese sticks were awesome they were
10011820	10015620	amazing amazing okay so there you go that's where i'll show you came from bimani traces
10015620	10023300	back to the ddr games second do you guys have any games to recommend for xbox ps3 singularity
10023300	10028560	recently came out and it looked cool any thoughts on that game thanks love your podcast troy
10028560	10033220	not played singularity myself um what i've heard around the grapevine is that it's not
10033220	10038720	so great but i haven't played it myself so i can tell you got good reviews um we got
10038720	10044560	mixed reviews i guess uh i know was it a game informer gave it an 8.5 out of 10 if that
10044560	10049300	makes any difference to you just check them you know metacritic if you want to you know
10049300	10054980	get a good you know i guess benchmark where the game is uh yeah like red dead redemption
10054980	10059220	will be good crackdown too if that's your sort of thing uh there's a lot of sports games
10059220	10063220	i think blur was underrated i think it's really good it really helps just a future reference
10063220	10067480	to our players let us know what type of games you're into yeah before you ask us what to
10067480	10072660	suggest because we are i know me in particular i am probably the most niche person in this
10072660	10080220	room i mean i like playing games where you take pictures of of magical girls i'm just
10080220	10085780	thinking about my card capture soccer game you know i'm playing you know i've i've been

10120940	10126380	don't own either system but i'm a fan of the series so i i would actually recommend tales
10126380	10131740	of asparia if you can find it rumor has it they only did one printing here's my suggestion
10131740	10134980	for our listener if you really are new to these consoles like i don't know if you're
10134980	10139620	new to these or you've had these for a while go back to the bargain bin and try to find
10139620	10142900	some games you missed because i bet there's a lot of shit out there that you've missed
10142900	10148220	like i'll give you case in point team fortress 2 for myself somehow missed that game just
10148220	10152220	after you know how long has it been out about three years two years two two two and a half
10152220	10156180	years yeah just totally missed that game somehow but i'm just now getting into it so you can
10156180	10163500	get the game on ebay by the way for 30 bucks all right just to let drew know but thank
10163500	10172380	you for the email we love having new losers spread the word okay next and final email
10172380	10179140	this comes from the money hey olr i was just wondering do you guys play any board games
10179140	10183700	i never did until we bought catan i guess that settlers of catan it's so fun and has
10183700	10188780	all these expansion packs to make it never get old and that's all i can think about except
10188780	10194860	how awesome gliding and crackdown to please spell properly oh and give a shout out to
10194860	10199940	my friend agent wiggles because he is gonna listen to the podcast agent wiggles tell your
10199940	10204820	friend grammar grammar grammar grammar spelling spelling spelling i just i think that guy
10204820	10210560	types on the psp but still you gotta hey i type on an iphone i know i know i like the
10210560	10217140	name agent wiggles agent wiggles that's amazing um i have been known to like a board gamer
10217140	10221260	too i was always a big fan of life i really like this question by the way this is a really
10221260	10226760	good question out of the the many random questions we get i think this is a neat question so
10226760	10232300	board games that you like um i kind of like the classics too i prefer a lot of card games
10232300	10236780	actually my favorite card game is uh millborn i don't know if you've ever played this it
10236780	10243800	looks like miles borns but i think it's french millborn um it's uh like a racing game with
10243800	10248680	cards and you can like give people flat tires and and all that that's my favorite like card
10248680	10252620	game i was always good at run me in spades those are always my games as far as board
10252620	10257500	game goes i was always a fan of clue growing up and clue master detective especially and
10257500	10261500	then of course i love the movie and and all that stuff so i like the classics i could
10261500	10267140	never get into like axis and allies and the really complex board game shit too many pieces
10267140	10274220	i did play risk as a small child i played risk and that thing is probably why i don't
10274220	10281460	like strategy games now because of all the risk i played as a kid and i love taboo i
10281460	10286340	mean it's not really so much of a board game i love trivial pursuits the genesis edition
10286340	10292540	ones the harder they are the better i like them it's hard because there's really that's
10292540	10298980	what she said there's there's two categories of board games there's like your hasbro target
10298980	10304900	walmart board games and then there's your like fucking millions of pieces hardcore we
10304900	10311460	don't fuck around board games like imported from foreign countries and all that like and
10311460	10316540	it's kind they're two totally different worlds and so it's hard to know which type of those
10316540	10322940	games you're into i hate monopoly i think monopolies really overrated too because if
10322940	10327340	you're gonna play monopoly don't make any fucking plans if you're gonna play an entire
10327340	10332780	game of monopoly and be prepared to hate everybody else i keep wondering where apples to apples
10332780	10338620	fits in it's more of a card i put it in the taboo lolsy area it works for me i like apples
10338620	10343740	to apples though i like and actually we played one game that was called was it cranium yeah
10343740	10349220	cranium is fun cranium was awesome i remember that and i miss um pictionary i still like
10349220	10353540	trivial pursuit i love trivial pursuits my old roommate and i were gonna have a board
10353540	10356740	game night we never did get around to doing it i would totally be in on the board game
10356740	10361180	night if we wanted to start one can't do it at my place i should talk to my friend who
10361180	10365620	owns a house in the south area and see if he would want to do something like that the
10365620	10371740	last actual board game i played was uh electronic assisted board game the omega virus does anyone
10371740	10377820	remember that i think so i was like early 90s that that's in that same family of games
10377820	10382480	like the the mall game and yeah when you say it's not the same type you know what i mean
10382480	10386500	when you say like mall madness when you say electronic assisted board game i think of
10386500	10391900	electronic battleship i used to have electronic battleship it was fucking rad you know game
10391900	10398900	i love for a board game mouse trap yes except it never worked it never worked if you tweak
10398900	10404380	parts of them um surso in our chat room says how about strip poker how about munchkin that's
10404380	10411380	a classic i like playing uh munchkin catan catan's pretty fun um you know your traditional
10411380	10416460	stuff we'll play like the game of life and now then scrabble um one game though i did
10416460	10420700	play with uh one of my friends a while back and it was actually a lot of fun really need
10420700	10426980	to play it again uh cthulhu rising i've heard that's good it's awesome it's you versus it's
10426980	10431900	basically everybody playing together as a team um although we need to cheat the next
10431900	10438180	time we play because uh it was really fucking hard cthulhu kicked our ass as cthulhu usually
10438180	10442180	does an elder god it reminds me of a joke i heard sorry about that someone sent me a
10442180	10446540	link i didn't know a video would be on it my bad how many cthulhu investigators does
10446540	10451700	take change light bulb all of them you never split the party see now sure as i was yelling
10451700	10457420	out all those junior high school games spin the bottle oh god two minutes in the closet
10457420	10463620	really sticking to the board games to board games okay we used to we used to though when
10463620	10468340	we would play monopoly we would steal the pieces from clue so i could be the you know
10468340	10473500	so you could be the lead pipe or the dagger or the the revolver that was always we used
10473500	10478140	to always fight over who got to be the car i never wanted to be the car i wanted to be
10478140	10484300	the shoe so i could the boots i could kick everyone's ass this is this is my logic as

10549260	10555620	mine is multifaceted oh big words faceted is not a big word rob all right it's a little
10555620	10561780	word with the big meaning facet is it's something you put on the kitchen sink right where's
10561780	10571500	the treble it vibrates let's put that in my special place rob's got a big hairy ball in
10571500	10583220	his crotch now what else is new anyone got a weed whacker lord anyway anyway um not it's
10583220	10586940	more of a situational thing not directly to anyone in particular just the whole having
10586940	10594300	to wait for my surgery thing really blows but i do want to thank um my surgeon for basically
10594300	10598600	fitting me in on one of his on-call days to get me in so that i can still legitimately

10635340	10642480	money to buy us they bought us now they have no competition but still when you look at
10642480	10648240	people who you've been with you know for like some of these people i've worked with the
10648240	10652700	entire time i've been with the company for 10 years and it's just sort of like wow that's
10652700	10658420	a big chapter closing you know so i'm not really necessarily going to say an fu to um

10898320	10905140	on the show this is my impersonation of watching world cup on telemundo okay becky and i my
10905140	10909680	last week of work we decided to go get tacos at our usual place and we were watching um
10909680	10915380	uruguay versus netherlands and it was great but every time of course there was the goal
10915380	10918180	wait here where's that camera and then in back when you're
10918180	10932340	that's my impersonation of watching world cup on telemedo you make it sound so riveting
10932340	10944180	all right loki got some news for us uh yes uh the ps3 is becoming white and uh racist
10944180	10952060	in japan it's uh it's white and it's offering a larger hard drive um because you know i
10952060	10957460	know those ps3 systems they really have a problem with storage space uh but instead
10957460	10964340	of the current 120 gigabyte ps3 slim you will now be able to get a 160 gigabyte ps3 slim
10964340	10971240	that's in white and uh will also include a new vertical white stand and of course a white
10971240	10981020	dualshock 3 controller and i'll be uh retailing for uh 29 980 yen i can't be the only one
10981020	10985820	who remembers the disastrous ad campaign they did with the psp when they released that night
10985820	10991980	let's not let's just not and then when it fails in japan it will sue the sony claiming
10991980	10996060	that you know it was discriminated against because it was caucasian and i'm sorry if
10996060	11004100	you already mentioned this but i was i was looking at chat wow um didn't they already
11004100	11008860	have the final fantasy 13 one that was white yeah it was white with like a pink crap on
11008860	11012660	it so if you don't want to know well they put a woman on it so that's why it didn't
11012660	11021340	sell i was waiting to get well played dark soccer is distracted by earthbound i was looking
11021340	11029260	at the anti-piracy stuff it's for the best all right uh and do you have anything else
11029260	11035380	to go with that uh yes also they're gonna be bundling resident evil 5 with um the playstation
11035380	11041460	move over there which in all honesty is probably a better game anyways than what moves sports
11041460	11053380	yay move sports but it's also gonna include it right now the uh it's also supposed to
11053380	11061300	be including i believe um the gun shooting pack oh they have also announced a big three
11061300	11068340	gun shooting perfect pack uh that will include time crisis raising storm dead uh dead storm
11068340	11074540	pirates and time crisis for the arcade version uh that's going to cost about 136 dollars
11074540	11083740	or 1 000 or i'm sorry 11 980 yen um but of course the you know the move bundle with resident
11083740	11090180	evil 5 the alternative edition it's all gonna have alternative music in there um that'll
11090180	11099220	retail for about 7980 yen or about 90 once again i rather have resident evil 5 than the
11099220	11104740	crappy screw it pack the resident evil game with the white ps3 and call it equal opportunity
11104740	11109820	well look that way everyone gets offended be quiet the nice thing about um the move
11109820	11115660	and a lot of that stuff is that those games aren't going to require move that's true much
11115660	11121980	different than the connect just so you know they may have some games that require them
11121980	11127780	actually no there are games that require the move oh well yeah how the fuck are you gonna
11127780	11131900	play move sports or how are you gonna play the sorcery game or how are you gonna play
11131900	11136820	um well there's a lot there's a lot though that don't require it that's true there are
11136820	11140980	a lot that require it the same can be said about the connect though as well there's a
11140980	11149380	lot what there's child of eden and well that's all that's been announced yet yeah just saying
11149380	11154340	and that's all right that they don't require that the playstation move be you know required
11154340	11159180	to play certain games because it probably will stink all right one more story for you
11159180	11163840	guys then we're gonna open up the skype line at 1877 game olr and i'm sorry this picture
11163840	11168580	that they have photoshopped with the move in her hand it looks like a giant sex toy
11168580	11174260	a freaking huge giant sex toy with a glowing end on it are you done i'm done you swear
11174260	11180740	all right one more story for you guys tonight uh and it has to do with an olr favorite game
11180740	11187380	eye of judgment and i guess you could say a sad end to a story here yes the eye of judgment
11187380	11191620	or as we sometimes call it here uh on orange launch radio the brown eye of judgment or
11191620	11195980	that game we really wish would sell 1 million copies so that loki would have to put on a
11195980	11199380	tingle suit when he comes to the show you might remember he made that bet a long time
11199380	11210180	ago apparently the eye of judgment servers are going to be shut down on september 30th
11210180	11214780	and that was a notice now now it's on the european playstation forums but you can just
11214780	11218900	pretty much guess that this pretty much is going to carry over to the states as well
11218900	11223940	so offline play will still be available of course but if you play the eye of judgment
11223940	11229300	online you will no longer be able to after september 30th i have something to say about
11229300	11237140	that what so i'm sure all ten of you will be there iphone what's that i said i'm sure
11237140	11244660	all ten of you will be sad well this also means something else you guys is that you
11244660	11249500	know we made that bet with loki and i know you guys were holding out hope uh that somehow
11249500	11253460	some way maybe a price cut or something would happen where this game would sell a million
11253460	11258920	copies but guys now that the developer is even pulling the plug on eye of judgment i
11258920	11268340	think it's time to finally admit you guys the bet ladies and gentlemen is over and not
11268340	11273220	to mention that they stopped printing the game like years ago i don't even think they
11273220	11278900	printed one million copies no i can guarantee they did not print a million copies we never
11278900	11284660	made it official here on the show so i i kind of felt like we needed to finally say it's
11284660	11289660	over i'm sorry you guys damn you lost the bet with loki and loki will not be ever dressing
11289660	11294020	up as tingle unless you can get him to sign up to something else which should be your
11294020	11299760	next goal you know if you if you're not able to get him to uh you know sign up or do this
11299760	11303100	with the eye of judgment then you should get him to make a bet somewhere else that's just
11303100	11311460	all i'm saying all right are we ready to take some phone calls sure i think so uh 1877 game
11311460	11316020	olr is our phone number or our username on skype is orange lounge radio the skype line
11316020	11321940	is now open for business and meanwhile some last minute stories for you guys um i was
11321940	11328460	asked by a listener to um throw this out here real quick um metal max 3 is coming out soon
11328460	11332780	it's cute because there's this little dog that you can play with here and uh it's like
11332780	11336740	kind of like it looks like a little a little bit of an rpg here uh that you can play with
11336740	11341600	your team there it's a ds game metal max 3 it's a sequel i believe there was an old ass
11341600	11346940	nintendo game that was only out in japan called metal max it was out in the states too i distinctly
11346940	11353920	yes it was was it really um i want to say it was either on the playstation 3 or playstation
11353920	11359260	2 maybe because i remember it's the one with dogs with artillery on it because that's so
11359260	11364620	epic it is dogs with artillery i think it's the same game i can't remember what it was
11364620	11369300	called over here but that's how i sold it i'm like dude it's dogs with freaking cannons
11369300	11373700	on the back of them i like some of these artworks too you can be a hunter or a mechanic and
11373700	11377820	there's this chick with like big old wrenches there and uh you could be a big old wrenches
11377820	11384460	that's right or a nurse hello nurse wenches uh wrestlers artists i don't see the dog with
11384460	11388700	artillery but i think that's in the game a little later there so metal max 3 there for
11388700	11393220	last minute stories tonight uh our skyline is open i guess i guess our freaking feed
11393220	11399180	dropped for some reason uh 1877 game olr is the phone number to call i don't know why
11399180	11404060	we're having stream fail problems tonight i blame visual basic i blame the vuvuzela
11404060	11409540	all right loki you have any last minute stories for us while we wait for some phone calls
11409540	11414540	uh just one the apparently the rumor is the new animal crossing game for the 3ds will
11414540	11421260	have you as the role of the mayor interesting so you will you will have to do stuff for
11421260	11426280	the town where's that rumor coming from um it's coming from apparently a pdf that came
11426280	11431500	out from nintendo during e3 which makes sense because they did put out e3 or they usually
11431500	11435780	put out pdfs with um information regarding their titles all right let me get to the phone
11435780	11440140	because we do have a call and hold hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hi uh this
11440140	11446460	is spazzing here hey spazzinator what's on your mind um well this is just uh basically
11446460	11453100	a follow call to the car i you know i had made like two weeks ago um you know just a
11453100	11459260	quick recap just in case you or the other listeners forgot uh forgot um basically sunny
11459260	11468300	was having uh having me jump through uh to get my veal uh back after uh having to send
11468300	11477100	my system in for repair uh again for the yellow lighted desk and basically um i don't know
11477100	11484060	if anyone's seen my lull ramps on twitter but here it is basically a week and a half
11484060	11493740	later and i still don't have all my videos you know back uh-oh basically i uh i literally
11493740	11503380	uh you know i looked at what they did authorize uh you know and uh you know i compare that
11503380	11511380	to all the videos that backed up and basically i still got like 55 videos outstanding and
11511380	11515860	i'm like what the fuck you know uh you would think you're not the only person to that this
11515860	11521580	happens to it's it it's weird that they don't have a better process like at least microsoft
11521580	11527980	seems to have with the whole you know releasing your um drm once a year to be able to re-download
11527980	11536220	it seems a little ridiculous yeah my my main gripe more than anything is that well it's
11536220	11545420	kind of twofold a uh the first one being that you know sony's policy you know is uh having
11545420	11553020	this done uh done it's supposed to be done within 24 to 48 hours of your call and i since
11553020	11559740	i you know made the initial call uh on the wednesday before you know the first of july
11559740	11566100	you know i should have gotten all my videos back by that friday and like i just said i'm
11566100	11573700	still missing 55 videos and the second uh gripe that i have is that you know the sony
11573700	11580300	reps over there you know either don't seem to know what the hell they're doing or just
11580300	11585260	don't give a give a shit one way y'all are you know well they're probably outsourced
11585260	11589580	i hate to say it but they're they're probably some type of outs i mean i don't i don't have
11589580	11594100	any facts to back that up but a lot of times when they're disconnected they are but actually
11594100	11597720	i want to say um this real quick uh from a chat room chat room because we have a lot
11597720	11602060	of chatters that are saying well maybe you should buy hard copies i mean does this kind
11602060	11608020	of make you think wow this might be the case against digital distribution or are you walking
11608020	11612140	away from this going oh you know what i'm still i'm still about digital distribution
11612140	11621020	well you know some of the shows i normally get on a regular basis for example uh i i
11621020	11628780	i buy um the weekly recaps of uh x play and attack of the show on a regular basis and
11628780	11639300	i i've never seen those uh on hard copy whatsoever unless i get like uh a dvd burner and uh you
11639300	11647740	know record them directly out the air interesting okay yeah uh all in other uh shows you know
11647740	11654660	uh you know i've tried looking at places like blockbuster targeting what that uh and uh
11654660	11662240	i almost never see them you know my only other recourse would probably be to go to uh go
11662240	11669180	to microsoft to get them there or get them on playstation networks so uh you know or
11669180	11675780	find some kind of mail order service and buy them that way but but you know you know but
11675780	11683100	the thing is you know i damaged joe joe schmoe shouldn't have to jump through hoops you know
11683100	11689020	please and beg and yada yada yada to get all their videos back that they rightfully
11689020	11695620	paid for you know i mean all i want is to sit down watch my videos when i'm not playing
11695620	11700780	you know playing my games and whatnot i mean it really isn't really too much to ask for
11700780	11704900	well you know spaz nader although there's not a lot we can really do to help um i think
11704900	11710580	there's a lot that at least your troubles hopefully will not be other listeners problems
11710580	11714180	in the future this should be something that i think a lot of people should take into consideration
11714180	11718060	when uh buying this stuff is that you know if they're gonna make you jump through hoops
11718060	11722800	to get your content back maybe you want to think twice before you click buy and that's
11722800	11728780	really what it boils down to unfortunately i i there's i can't i can't make sony give
11728780	11733780	the stuff back or what have you so uh there's not a lot we can do but i'm i'm hoping you're
11733780	11738580	uh able to get conclusion to this but this is really that just really bites and i think
11738580	11744540	uh unfortunately your story is going to have to be caution for everybody else yeah um one
11744540	11751340	final note before i want to go and get to um the next call yeah um i did you know make
11751340	11759160	you know my most recent call to sony uh you know this past friday and basically bitching
11759160	11766180	to them about um you know what's going on with the videos and basically they said it's
11766180	11772820	gonna take a couple days longer and i should should you know you know get them back by
11772820	11779460	tuesday and um you know if i you know i don't want to get them by tuesday i'm just gonna

11814100	11819740	i see uh bonds in chat says my ps3 yellow rained on me too so i guess and rob that's
11819740	11825940	the official video game podcast i'm sorry i'm sorry because i didn't violate the decree
11825940	11830060	did i was there a clause in there okay i'm good just want to clarify that all right thank
11830060	11834940	you thank you for clarifying that real is an orange lounge radio the official video
11834940	11839140	game podcast of the galaxy uh if you want to give us a call 1 877 game olr or our username
11839140	11846340	on skype orange lounge radio yeah sceo 100 matt has advice for spasinator saying if you're
11846340	11849560	going to keep getting bitten by this then just stop downloading videos on it it really
11849560	11853340	isn't worth the hassle every six months with this nonsense you know i kind of make this
11853340	11858220	comparison to what i'm going through in world of warcraft right now is that you invest so
11858220	11863860	much in something sometimes it's easier said than done to just walk away from it you know
11863860	11868420	what i mean although granted spasinators well no actually i don't think you could say that
11868420	11873120	because i pay fifteen dollars a month for wow so spasinators invested a lot of money
11873120	11880760	too i'm sure but so have i so um yeah i i i think though um what you got to do is you've
11880760	11887500	got to let his uh trouble serve as a lesson for everybody else 1 877 game olr username
11887500	11892480	on skype is orange lounge radio look do you have any last minute stories for us um sure
11892480	11897960	um real quick i guess they're going to be doing a prequel to dead space 2 called dead
11897960	11902600	space ignition that'll be available out on xbox live arcade and playstation network slightly
11902600	11910200	before um the title is released sometime um i guess uh fall 2010 so that's kind of neat
11910200	11914600	it seems to be the trend of stuff nowadays you know why i put out you know extended content
11914600	11919740	for the game when you can just release something else and charge people for it um summer of
11919740	11923300	arcade we've already released kind of uh talked about the titles that are going to be coming
11923300	11928360	out on xbox live arcade this summer um but now we actually have release dates and prices

11974720	11981280	microsoft points or fifteen dollars i'm sure it's because those games cost a lot more developed
11981280	11992600	for and not because they're green ps 15 is the new five yeah pretty much that's it we're
11992600	11995740	not getting a lot of calls on skype tonight i don't know what's going on is something

12021920	12027560	of saku well hello legend of saku what's on your mind even old-fashioned um yes nothing
12027560	12033440	much really just like getting back from like excursions with my girlfriend over the weekend
12033440	12038760	but not anywhere interesting i didn't know you had a girly friend now what's your name
12038760	12043560	and the name's april we've been together for about like four months now is she a reporter
12043560	12051260	for a major newspaper no all right ah come on i had television i had to oh it's a tv
12051260	12058040	i forget all right hi april all right well what's on your mind besides uh ddrx to release
12058040	12063640	uh another thing that i noticed was that act you know the former infinity award employees
12063640	12068480	are actually ratcheting up their suit against activision with more details as to how much
12068480	12074320	you know activision created a hostile environment for them stuff like um you know their their
12074320	12079080	top executives telling the infinity award folks to get over it regarding the bonuses
12079080	12085820	that they were promised basically being interrogated in secrecy stuff that you would see in some
12085820	12091000	sort of like you know so stuff that you would see during the soviet union days when you
12091000	12096240	had a secret police interrogate people out of nowhere did they just try did activision
12096240	12101000	recently exchanged 10 spies for four of infinity award spies and one of them was like this
12101000	12105960	really hot redhead is that perhaps i saw something on that but i guess it's for it's to the point
12105960	12111360	where they literally withheld bonuses unless they churned out another modern warfare game
12111360	12116120	to be completed november of next year stuff like that like they were basically being hoard
12116120	12121520	out to to spit out nothing but modern warfare you know you know what's interesting something
12121520	12125000	similar to what you're saying right now was brought up earlier in the show and it was
12125000	12129840	when loki was talking about crackdown 2 and you know we mentioned oh crackdown 2 has been
12129840	12133180	getting a lot of crap because it's just like crackdown 1 and we were talking about how
12133180	12137040	the developers had to start from scratch and you know they should just have waited and
12137040	12140700	not say they're going to patch it on the back end and then drew kind of chimed in and said
12140700	12146080	well that was probably the publisher not the developer and it's kind of interesting because
12146080	12151620	this whole thing you're talking about is publisher bullying the developer yes exactly this is
12151620	12158080	this this goes back to the point of who holds the strings and how much how much power is
12158080	12162760	being wielded by activision in this sense they're they they're swinging that big stick
12162760	12167600	of theirs no pun intended but who has the bigger penis well that that's how it usually
12167600	12173000	is remember uh hellgate london that had numerous problems with it but they had to make the
12173000	12180240	halloween release date which is i know i mean infinity ward met their deadline ahead of
12180240	12185120	schedule and yet they're basically asking a lot you know twice as much from them let
12185120	12190600	me very little in exchange let me put out going as far as like you know just giving
12190600	12194980	them crumbs of their bonuses let me put out a pro tip to all the publishers of the world
12194980	12200660	out there i think in general are gamers going to be pissed if you keep pushing a game back
12200660	12204200	and back and back and back yes there's going to be they're going to be pissed off there's
12204200	12208300	going to be rabble rabble on the internet but at the end of the day when that game comes
12208300	12213820	out do you want to actually sell copies of the game if so it should probably be a good
12213820	12219620	game so my advice to the publishers of the world take the time to get it right are you
12219620	12223460	gonna go through a little bit of belly aching and pains while you make it right yes but
12223460	12227640	at the end of the day it's gonna be worth it because the game kicks ass there you go
12227640	12233080	just like and how many of you remember never forget super smash brothers brawl right the
12233080	12239720	new one on the gamecube or not on the gamecube we was delayed like twice and one of them
12239720	12243460	was a huge delay like six months right they spent more time on it and as a result the
12243460	12248240	quality increased yes now this goes back to my point where hideo kojima recently said
12248240	12253720	that japanese developers are pretty much they're lacking ambition and creativity something
12253720	12258200	that activision loves to you know this is the same card that activision plays by milking
12258200	12264360	their franchises to death the japanese are doing likewise they're not they're as long
12264360	12268240	in other words if an idea is out of their comfort zone they're not going to pursue it
12268240	12273880	they're just it's more profitable to just create a new sequel of x rpg or x fight and
12273880	12278080	y fighting game salacious pop in our chat room gives another excellent example arkham
12278080	12282760	asylum was delayed at least twice but everyone immediately forgot their angst about it when
12282760	12288460	it hit because it was really good chat.org i just said last week on the show i think
12288460	12294020	final fantasy 14 should be delayed like the uh the valves and blizzards they might take
12294020	12300160	forever but but the games they finally do release are worth the wait exactly that's
12300160	12305240	the whole point that's why but then you know that doesn't fit well that doesn't bode well
12305240	12311080	with the public company and shareholders because they want results in the short term or else
12311080	12314800	they're going to stop investing money in that company so this is where activision makes
12314800	12319560	us bread and butter by by doing sequels in the short term and not really preparing for
12319560	12323500	long term invest you know investments all right well zack we got to let you go to see
12323500	12327740	if anyone else is going to call in but uh we don't forget ddrx2 came out in japan we
12327740	12331320	heard we heard what do you think of that really quick what you think of the remixes i haven't
12331320	12334800	heard him yet but what do you think of that whole idea i think the song was a lot better
12334800	12339560	that i mean it's something that that blows it's in other words a lot better than what
12339560	12345040	supernova and possibly extreme has offered to grow zdrx out of the water at initially
12345040	12349840	our mp3 is out there on the internet now can you hear these remix songs go off of body
12349840	12353480	style they've already had like videos of it do they still have the stupid tokens and all
12353480	12359040	that garbage like to download stuff okay good i doubt it that's lost track anyways that'll
12359040	12364480	tell you how long it's been since i've been following uh go to that site they're updating

12428600	12432240	be happy that they brought back captain jack in this one so now you can play this again
12432240	12437160	yeah i wasn't how about a different captain jack song yeah i agree with sj100 matt you
12437160	12441520	the original one hasn't made an appearance as extreme and that's all you could say that's
12441520	12448240	eight it's like eight years absent from a ddr mix but it was in a ddr mix how about
12448240	12453240	a new cap but it hasn't been in a ddr mix in almost eight years all right all right
