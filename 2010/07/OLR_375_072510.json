{"text": " tonight July 25th 2010 worlds collide in two new fighting games announced at comic-con independent games are set to come to home and rock band 3 gets a release date hello my friends out there all over the internet and welcome to another week of orange lounge radio the video game talk show where every gamer has a voice my name is Rob Roberts I'll be with you over the next few hours with my awesome co-host the one and only dark Sakura Jamie summers hi how are you doing I'm amused I made that sound like it was all one name dark Sakura Jamie summers but it's actually dark soccer is your online name and the Jamie summers is your name name my stage name your stage name yes now why are you amused tonight because I'm looking at that will buff out calm which is part of the fail network or the aisle cheeseburger network and really all by the same people I guess it makes sense those are all those guys have I have no idea but this one then I'll link it in the chat room this one pictures of a car wearing panties great I just want to point out what awesome radio you looking at pictures makes all right no no no I'm I'm I I am here my messages are out mm-hmm and but you're still on vitamin V I am on the V I'm hyped up on the bike it in congratulations because my hand still has a hole in it there's a part that the stitches didn't clear up all the way so I put pictures on Facebook to show my mommy which is why I put them on Facebook is to show my mommy and I'm still quite bandaged up although not to the extent I was last time and it hurts as Rob it hurts us have you been able to play any video games at least um yes which we will get to in my gaming week yes which we'll get to in just a minute but I couldn't start the show without introducing the one and only tech master Loki you could it just wouldn't be as good probably not but don't let your ego get too big how you doing Loki I'm doing fine what's new in Loki's world you guys finished the nursery right or you're really close it's he's been inhaling a lot of paint fumes we have just very few things left to do on it it's it's pretty much done it's just like the finishing touches I guess we have to like shade the hills or put a little highlight on them which site to mix some paint with this like blending medium stuff to make it very transparent and then I have to paint one more hill and just like some small stuff but it's basically done I would have taken more pictures but now they said that you know I shouldn't take any more pictures until it's done because it ruins the Wow effect all right well we'll be waiting to be wowed it won't be as much of an epic mount all right let's also introduce we do have a special guest here in studio we've been having a lot of extra people in studio lately that's a good thing we like I'm having another person here to kind of mix things up a little bit tonight is somebody you've heard over the past few episodes say hello to salacious pop hello how are you I'm great can we even hear you tonight I don't know if we're are we hearing test all right yeah we're hearing you it's just kind of quiet I don't know don't be afraid don't be afraid just treat that microphone like it's ice cream all right there you go so what's new in your world how you doing not much yeah got some new games for my birthday that I'll be talking about okay sounds good so we'll get to those in a little bit and for those that may not know you have the unique distinction of also being my boyfriend yes to which I'm sure a lot of the listeners are like oh that poor guy but yeah so we went we went out last night actually we went to see I'm Adam Lambert in concert yes we did speaking of of gays Wow yeah right no here's no I mean is he any good cuz like I just remember like I hope he wins cuz I don't like the other person and then he lost well here's the thing it was my mom's idea okay my mom I'm not surprised my mom is the one that wanted to go and she bought the tickets but then she pulled out and decided not to go because her knees been bothering her lately and she was really scared about walking up and down the stairs and everything and I kind of feel bad but that's just the kind of person my mom is when she kind of makes her mind up there ain't no change in it so we went instead with some other friends and you know I don't know I I thought it was fine but it was weird that people were getting into a fight I don't know what'd you think of the concert I'm not really into American Idol at all and when Adam Lambert was getting hyped up I was like okay I get it but I just wasn't really a fan like I'm not really that into his music but he has a great voice and he put on a great show I like him more now having seen him live than I did from just watching him on TV I want his hair I'd say won me over his wig I'm sure I can't be real that his do can't be real tell us tell tell the listeners real quick about the fight we will get to video games I promise so we were up in the bleachers way in the back and about three rows in front of us off to the left a fight well not a real fight but um these ladies were dancing and standing up and having a good time Lamas yeah glamos we're standing up dancing as one would at a rock concert and this sort of drunk resentful husband who was probably dragged there by his wife really took offense to the fact that they were standing and he decided to call them out and get really belligerent cuz you need to know the crowd was totally like the Real Housewives of Sacramento County I mean Deena Lohan's all over wherever you look yeah I think on the Venn diagram of shame there's definitely some overlap between Adam Lambert fans and like twi-moms I think there are a lot of yeah yeah quite a bit so we got to watch security come in and yes security had gave them a stern talking to put it so there was a point where I was like am I serious because I've gone to a lot of concerts before and I've never seen a fight so it's like am I really gonna see people throw down at Adam Lambert like is this is this real life yeah it's pretty pretty surreal well here's the other thing that you need to know about the concert it was that a Indian casino which we have quite a few of those here in California so it's you know obviously it's on Native American land and they can have gambling and smoking and and all that good stuff so we actually went into casino after the show and I'm kind of shocked at how much the worlds of gaming and gambling are starting to fuse closer together you may not be aware of this but a lot of gaming companies are also in the business of making like gambling devices like Konami is one of the big ones actually they're probably making more money right now on some of their gambling machines and one of the machines that we saw in there was this gigantic wheel of fortune slot machine and it's not like I mean there's been wheel of fortune slot machine for years but there's a huge mungus wall-sized one yes yeah it looks like Derby owners Club to me like remember I thought you were talking about like the five cent of the nickel slots where they had like there's that too but now there's one with a giant monitor and I guess the bonus round on that one you touch letters to complete the puzzle on the giant board and it's multiple players doing it at once it's weird and they have Vanna White like the real Vanna White doing record like she's the bumpers between rounds like good luck everybody and it's really her in HD it's very creepy but what's also creepy like isn't she like 80 years old and she still looks like she's like 30 like she's made a pact with the devil clearly plastic surgery she's just using what you know what some of that stuff different cosmetics from Umbrella corporation you know to keep her cells nice and rejuvenated well you've seen that movie death becomes her she made a porcelain Wow she's ceramic I did I did have to talk to one lady though in the casino because she had her sign with her that said I'm 70 and I love Adam because she reminded me of my mom because my mom's also just about 70 she's 69 anyway okay enough Adam I swear that is like the most Adam Lambert chat you'll ever hear on orange lounge radio I apologize but we do talk about video games we're gonna get into those in just a minute I had to go to our chat room though we love the chatters chat that orange lounge radio.com they're always here with us every Sunday night as we do tape live at all games radio every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific and nine o'clock Eastern www.allgames.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show and of course big major massive super props to Bobby Black Wolf who just turned five years old this week his show not him his show all right and it was actually it was his five year of podcasting because I think he had like a life thesis five thing like we used to have this is gaming related you've got to stop with the pictures okay I'm gonna put it away put it away all right in the chat room all right link it in the chat room so that way our live chatters can see and unfortunately those listening on the podcast well it's just more incentive to join us exactly that's why I do this all right to lure them well let's talk about gaming weeks let's get less Adam more video games dark soccer how was your gaming week mine was fairly epic Rob I did lots of gaming actually such for being an invalid such as Dan and I took the last of our our spare money now we're dirt broke waiting on our government checks to arrive he's on unemployment I'm on disability okay we went to Dave and Buster's it's small oh the new one here in Roseville it's tiny and loud oh my god loud and but we played wait your mic is totally cut out you got to check the the connection is wrong sorry guys live radio Jamie's mic is doing weird stuff go ahead no you're still out I don't know what I pushed I pushed it in Rob I don't know what's going on anyway so it played this tank game that Namco put out I don't remember what's called it was pretty fun I played a lot of games to try to win a blender because I really need a new blender apparently um and we did this typhoon thing which is more like a ride and they had a they do like a minecart one no you your mic you get can you guys switch okay I don't know what's going on with my hey is this well I'm yeah it's much better all right go ahead anyway so we played the tank game that Namco did we played this typhoon thing which is like a bunch of different rides all in one and we did a pinball one which was kind of throws you around a pinball game it was pretty cool because of course we had to do pinball and then we I played more more token stuff and then I started playing Ragnarok online again which because it's easier to do with my hand being kind of messed up but I did play some Star Trek online and I'm at captain eight now what exactly does captain eight mean it means that I've got two more levels until I'm rear Admiral pretty much so those like levels in other MMOs okay okay cuz like you start off because you know they're set up like a military organization they go by rank and then you've got divisions in each rank so so I'm getting up there actually I found out that while a lot of the earlier missions are lame the upper captain level and Admiral level missions are really freaking fun so I've been having a good time it's especially funny watching although I have I've had such a hard time playing when I've just taken my Vicodin because then I can't I totally focus on one thing when I'm on Vicodin it's like I have instead of a DD I have like hyper focus disorder or something and get fixated on one major thing at a time so it's really kind of hard to multitask hence me looking at all these pictures during the show and not being able to look away from them I don't know what you're talking about dork anyway and I did other games what did I do oh yeah I started this what's that professor top hat game professor Layton no not professor Layton it's like a combination of platformer and puzzle game and it's this guy I'm gonna hold on a second is that the new one on Steam no no no no it's a gameplay game and you'd like have to find the golden suit is this really bizarre little game that it's it's also it's awfully cutesy and I was surprised that Dan suggested it to me to play but it's really it's really fun I've been playing a little bit of that and some trying to go back and play Oh end on except I'm right-handed my stitches are on my right hand so well my incision is on my right hand so I can't play a wind on very well especially again when I'm on Vicodin so I gotta tell you guys before the show I said something and Jamie flipped me off and it actually put her in pain because she's like I haven't flipped anyone off since I had my surgery Rob's the first person I flipped off and because the whole thing is that my flexibility is coming back in my hand and I can make a sword of fist and I can sort of extend it except I can't apparently make a fist and extend a finger at the same time cuz then it hurts and maybe you want to cry and I blame Rob because Rob evoked the finger well you wouldn't bet go bake me a pie that's what I asked bake your own damn pie all right I'm a guacamole though you have some guacamole I'm I had but I'm full of chips oh what else I don't remember no I'd be taking effect everybody no I played I played mahjong before class my netbook and I found that my SNES my next emulator works very well for Linux on my netbook so I can play Super Nintendo games before class you should check out the Castlevania puzzle game that just came out on iPhone because although it looked really weird from the screenshots I've been hearing a lot of good things about it I just picked it up actually because I had $40 worth of iTunes credit for my birthday from various gift cards so I picked it up was like four or five bucks I don't remember and it just kind of made me think of you because I know you're big Castlevania fangirl you like puzzle games too I was wanting to play it but I I almost downloaded the Silent Hill game and no no the Silent Hill games junk it's on my phone if you wanna play it it's not that great it's like it's like a first-person thing it's it does it's not like the actual Silent Hill games at all but um and then we've also been redoing the vault Dan and I and we've decided well I decided this and he better go along with it or else that we're gonna play play through Sonic Adventure I like how you have like the dual TVs all set up in there you know they were huh they were Xbox Oh monitors from kiosk from certain stores kiosks okay well no and Dan was just told that he could take everything so we've got like broken Xboxes and broken Wiis and semi working Wiis and a bunch of cables and those monitors and crap so he's putting them to proper use in the vault and I'll put up those pictures of the vault in progress all right so in fact I'll go do that right now I'm gonna find the name of that game because it's gonna bother the crap out of me until I figure it out all right so when Jamie runs in here and yells something completely random that's the aim all right Loki how is your gaming week now you have to stop looking at pictures what are those SD cards you SD card compact flash cards and yes I am shopping for compact flash cards for something I'm working on because I can't go without having six projects at one time although I did cancel one project because I don't really give a crap about making it you know cardboard arcade cabinet anymore what project oh the project under 100 hundred dollars name that sounded cool the other people have already done that they have like one that's actually a maim system that's under $100 and basically this would be the same thing just you know the cabinet would you know be kind of free because it'd be made out of cardboard but I just don't care and I may do it later but you know I know whatever so I have spare parts at home um no but what I was working on was actually can't hear you I want to interject what were you interjecting is Henry hats worth in the puzzling adventure okay I could told you that so yeah what I'm working on right now my friend gave me one of these old I don't even know what they are they're like remember those tiger electronics games and stuff not necessarily like game and watch but something similar that and it's a Frogger game it's set up inside of what looks like a bar top arcade cabinet except it's just plastic and it's really tiny and I was looking at him like cuz then you know the first thing that comes to my mind for anything it's like I wonder if I could put an arcade game inside this thing and so I've kind of challenged myself to do that for no apparent reason what I've seen that before like the little bit like all the it's like it's kind of like an LED game but it's in color you know it's Frogger I think I've seen one of those before aren't they like all red or all orange or something I know they're well not all of them I've seen ones that are multiple colors they have just like an overlay on them that gives them the colors but yeah it's basically that so what I would be doing is I'd be ripping out the guts of the inside or whatever this thing is I'd actually probably be using the joy stick that's on there not really even replacing any of the buttons but just wiring them up to some sort of like I pack type thing probably a mini pack and then running that through which I just bought because I bid snipe someone and won an auction for a nano ITX PC which they're really small but it's actually a little big for what I need it to be put in so I gotta put the board in an angle and hopefully that fits I'm not sure so that'll be fun otherwise I'll use it for something else but I have a three and a half inch monitor that came from I think it's supposed to use for like backup cameras and cars I got dirt cheap that I'm gonna hook it up through because it just takes a standard video in and I'm gonna hook that up to the PC through that and maybe possibly use that as an actual tiny tiny tiny main cabinet that'd be kind of funny and put on my desk at work I shall call him mini maim mini maim no but actual games I play this week just the same typical stuff I've been playing you know before Grand Theft Auto lots of lost in the dammed because that's what my co-workers want to play now because they think they lose less on that which I've been proving them wrong and although we did play a little bit of Battle of the Gay Tony because there was a few days where it's just myself and my other co-worker and there's just no one online at all playing you know Battle of the Gay Tony not I mean there's more people playing that than lost and dammed but there's really no one playing lost and dammed right now which you know I think this is about the right time to finally get those mods working which I'm hopefully going to start working on some more once I get done painting the baby's room which I'm very close right that baby's gonna get here and all your projects just got canceled no they haven't that's what you think you are wrong sir no I'm just saying project baby is gonna take a lot of time it's not gonna take that much time babies just thank you differ they sleep and they feed them any poke at them that's not gonna last yeah let's what we'll be saving this little clip and playing it for Loki a year after that kids born we'll see what he thinks hey I I'm well aware of what babies do and yeah they they wake you up in the middle night and you're tired okay I get that that does not stop me from say spending a few minutes you know here and there to build crap I don't know I need gamer daddies to email the show to give Loki some advice I just I just want to hear from some gamer daddies that's all all right I'm just saying like I don't need there's two of us we don't need to juggle the baby I mean I will be taking care of the baby but if you juggle the baby CPS might get called they might especially since they can't juggle anything so that's not good now I'm not worried about that stuff I don't think it's really gonna change anything I have done a number of people who said that all right we'll stop taking on Loki go ahead come on I'm just saying that I don't think it will affect anything that's fine I don't need 80,000 projects going on at one time but I will find excuses to do that okay so anyways besides all that stuff and of course more crackdown too I'm not really enjoying this game as much as the first one probably because this game is very similar to the first one which you know wouldn't be so bad but it's just they really kind of took away all the open world part of the game because you know the open world stuff is still there but my god is that my guy who's the voiceover guy is such a nagging bitch it's like you should go to this rooftop race fuck that I will do the rooftop race when I feel like it no you should do it now I will do it later do it now are you trying to piss me off oh god I hated that stop killing them you know you know like I'll like jump down and you know the other not agents but like you know the peacekeepers will be there and they'll get injured or like I'll blow up a car and some shrapnel will hit them though stop injuring the peacekeepers they're hard at work or like don't injure the civilians you know they need to like us my favorite that peacekeeper had a wife and family do you want to explain it to them and it's dumb and even when you do piss them off to come at they send a hit squad after you you just go up on the rooftops and they shoot at the building because they can't figure out how to hit you and and then that goes away and they're all hope you learned your lesson I'm like nope didn't learn my lesson I'm gonna do it again we yeah it's alright it's just maybe the announcers the last boss it's not the last boss and what's retarded is from what I hear the game has the same fucking twist in it as the first one and it's completely obvious from the beginning because obviously if you play the first game you understand what the twist is and right from the get-go they kind of give you the big hint hey hey it's probably the same twist again not that I even care it's just that was just a dumb excuse what about the twist in the original Metal Gear game that the big boss that was talking to you on the you know frequency thingy and he'd like was the announcer ended up being the last boss I think so yeah but I don't think this guy's the last boss he's just it's just that the peacekeepers are evil oh my god you know someone that's helping you know as evil that twist has been done like 80,000 times and you know I know it's a spoiler but hey the original crackdown game has been out for a few years now so too bad whatever it just doesn't it doesn't matter than me but it's still fun you know I like playing it it's just it's very you know the missions that you go on are very linear and granted that the first game the missions weren't that different but they did have some bosses that you fought I mean granted they were very simply just have to run up to them and roundhouse kick them a few times and they're dead but you know at least they had bosses I don't know they they could ramp up the difficulty and stuff they could all right well I guess that's it for Loki's gaming week how about Alan you want to talk about your gaming week absolutely how's my mic doing I think you're okay well kind of a just actually you and Jamie should probably switch back again is I think I fixed hers we'll see I don't know bear with us guys live radio let me just okay well we can hear you now okay all right hi okay so my birthday was a couple weeks ago and I picked up or rather I got Bayonetta so I'm finally playing that I know that came out in January a lot of fun been wanting to play it for a while I'm on the third stage so it's pretty much you know Devil May Cry but with a sexy bitch killing everybody puzzle quest 2 and I played puzzle quest 1 on the DS I probably have about 130 hours on my save game so I've been playing the hell out of the second one Wow 130 hours that's a long game yeah I well I pretty much grinded everything to level 99 that was grindable it was very yeah so puzzle quest 2 Wow of course our guild tried to do a trial of the Crusader 10 man it's the hardest rate we've tried and Wow we got about halfway through it before we gave up good progress there and played some left for dead and played some alien swarm what you think alien swarm it's good it's the new four player co-op game that valve put out it is under the valve name it's free so whenever something is not horrible and free it's usually worthy of a little bit of hype the gameplay is basically gauntlet for player top-down massive enemies coming at you and it's so it's gauntlet with crossed with the movie aliens pretty much and there's the medic the tech the sergeant and the special ops and you play online with friends and each each person has a special role and it's a lot of fun I downloaded it oh so we'll have to play you should play with us free yeah you can't argue with free it's two gigs so yeah anything else you gave me a week you want to share with us I think that's all I've played really I played left for dead I'm sure you'll talk about a little bit with you you had never played it before well I had tried it like once a couple years ago but yeah yeah I did load up the team team fortress 2 tutorial so I know that Jamie wanted to play some of that so all right well my gaming week Alan hit on a lot of the same stuff I was playing a lot of these games we were playing together as I was in that Wow raid and all that fun stuff I've been doing more PvP in Wow though I'm one of my characters I'm finally my level 76 bank all warrior I'm finally bringing back to be like a PvP character and I've been having a lot of fun with her she's cool anyway a alien swarm free on steam right now there's really no reason not to get this game it's worth a look it's the time I mean it's not like oh my god like you know like portal awesome or something but it's the type of game you would pay like 10 to 15 dollars for on Xbox Live Arcade it feels a lot like an Xbox Live Arcade game to me but it's not it's a PC game and it's very much I think gauntlet kind of mixed with aliens is good with a little team fortress 2 thrown in there because a lot of the classes kind of seem to come over from that and yeah it's fun and a lot of fun on the multiplayer so check that out I mean there's really no reason not to check out alien swarm unless you're like super anti steam is about the only reason I could think of or your PC really really really blows which might be another reason one thing that I really like about valve is that they will often they're very involved in the mod community for half-life and all that stuff and if you read the info on alien swarm you will read that the developers for it are people from the mod community that valve hired because they like their work so valve actually hires out of you know the the fan the fan service projects that's cool and that's how alien swarm was made is they they hired out of the mod developers all right now some of our chat chatters a chat that orange on twitter.com are joking about free and Yaris amazed that suma says can't argue with free points to Yaris yeah but Yaris was different like I can't explain it like I Yaris really really was I think the commercial tie-in had a lot to do with that like when you pay to have a game made that's basically a giant commercial I think you're kind of set up for disaster a little bit alien swarm is no commercial nothing it's just I honestly I think it's again to try and get steam on more people's computers that's that's really what it boils down to because you know since you launched steam to play the game you're gonna get tempted into these ads where it's you know four dollar sale on you know old game I really want to buy that's that's what it is the same reason why they gave away portal for free why they have these disgustingly low sales is to get steam out there more because the more steam is out there the less other companies will you know that try to take them on will have the chance um other games I played I also played a little bit of team fortress 2 I play more than the tutorial I actually was playing some offline games I'm not ready to fight the people online yet because I'm still scared because I'm not very good at it but I found that I was I was doing okay it's a medic the white mage which I think somebody had suggested in an email last week and it was funny because I said yeah I'll probably do the medic and it's kind of a different role because instead of just running out there like all quake style just running on the front die it's more you know you hang back with your team and actually heal people and you can over heal I kind of liked what they did with it it's it's fun so I'm talking about all these games that are years old because I played Left 4 Dead as well finally got around to playing a little more that Alan and I played a little bit together and that was cool just I don't know I think a lot of you guys have already played it so for me to sit here and describe it after so long it's probably a little ridiculous but I guess if you haven't just kind of imagine a first-person shoe that it takes a little bit of teamwork I mean obviously Left 4 Dead is all about teamwork and it's about the four people you know that are playing although you know you can have everybody else be a computer player but it is a little more fun to play at least with people you know I mean you can go online and play with strangers but it's fun when you play with people you know because then you can kind of you know joke and talk to each other and you know Alan and I kind of you know can communicate really well and say you know he can explain to me you know why we don't run up and say hello to the girl that's crying right shine a light on her wait bad idea no so yeah it's good it's not like Left 4 Dead that was fun who's your favorite character in Left 4 Dead somebody asked me down on Twitter this week and I'm like well I've like played it once do you have a favorite character on Left 4 Dead in the first one probably the biker I totally blanking on his name but the the guy at the handlebar mustache and yeah he's funny and the second one probably the redneck because he's so stupid all right very cool as far as other games I played this week Puzzle Quest 2 gosh it's almost the same games as Alan played this week I don't know if there's like anything unique I played that he didn't play kind of sound game room I don't think you really play game room I play a little bit of that another one of my old favorite Activision classics excuse me frostbite is scheduled for release this week that was kind of a frostbite is like kind of like a ghetto Frogger really really ghetto Frogger so I'll be checking that out because I have fond childhood memories of that one um all right that's gonna do it for our gaming week so we're gonna get into the news and everything that's going on in the gaming world but first we're gonna do some housekeeping real quick I want to bring you guys up to speed on the big battle it's kind of going on all summer long at the big battle net I think it's also available big battle dot all games calm but the big battle dot networks just fine thank you guys so much olr has really made a charge the past few days we are finally starting to dent the lead a little bit that dead pixel live has we have like 51 points we're a pretty solid second place right now and a lot of that has to do with you guys that played super stardust HD this week and again if you haven't heard of the big battle listeners of the shows not necessarily the hosts although I try to participate on at least games I own listeners of the shows play their favorite games against listeners of other shows and it's kind of like a big kind of tournament type of thing high scores and leaderboards and all that I think they're doing one tonight I don't know if maybe it was rescheduled they're doing battlefield bad company was either tonight earlier today sadly that's a game I'll have so I can really follow that one but I tried to get people through the Twitter to sign up but I know that super stardust HD just came to an end and we took first place thanks to our listeners Zoui came in first place with a obscene score of 11 million he was going back and forth with the second place listener from Fantastic Forum on there Riptide did very well there to AZHP made a showing and then we also made a showing on the Forza motorsport 3 competition one of our listeners I think just one charted over there Burr charted for us over there so he came in sixth place but that's certainly better than nothing so a very good job by Burr over there so we really appreciate that some things that are coming up in the near future super Street Fighter 4 trials HD and shatter have both been announced as well so super Street Fighter 4 I'm very excited about that one so we'll be checking those out a lot of you guys have been requesting other types of games PC games is when I've gotten a request for so I don't know how you might be able to do like a team fortress 2 battle but I'll try to look into it and see if we can get maybe Derek schedule so like that would be cool check that out big battle dotnet the big battle dotnet dark Tetsuya one of our staffers that orange on twitter.com he does a lot of good work for the site and keeps it up with fresh content he decided thanks to their classic game of the week last week the journey being the classic in the week last week and it came up that you know he wants to do a game with the olr hosts or the olr people in journey or I should say not in the actual journey game in a journey like game so he actually has started it he's chronicling it in a little web series called project journey and there's actually little screenshots of me and like a breakout kind of game I don't know it's it's I'm curious to see how this turns out yet scared all at once I'm so excited I'm so excited I'm so scared alright alright that's gonna do it for housekeeping tonight facebook.com slash orange launch radio twitter.com slash olr please follow us spread the love of orange launch radio because we don't have advertising dollars let's get in some actual bonafide gaming news tonight there's a lot thanks to comic-con but I think Loki starting us off with something not comic-con related right yes we'll talk a little bit about connect and some of the stuff that was kind of rumored that we kind of you know figured was true but is true so we'll see anyways say announced that one of the things that was rumored that there's gonna be a new Xbox 360 arcade system coming out this fall there is gonna be a new one now it's bundled with a 4 gigabyte internal memory unit kind of like how they were doing with the old arcade systems and so that's kind of neat and then of course you know you can put your own hard drive in there just like you can with the new you know s systems or whatever you want to call them or use the USB because I think a lot of people are now using USB sticks you can also use USB sticks as well on there because there's plenty USB ports on there now and that's kind of cool and yes and then also of course they're gonna be doing a new oh and I'm sorry that will be bundled with connect that $300 one and of course there's also gonna be a new just plain arcade system for $200 that's gonna be coming out in August as well so that's kind of neat that they're gonna be doing that I mean alternatives are wonderful connect is gonna be priced at $150 as if all those retail listings you know we're Microsoft's own website taking pre orders didn't give it away yeah yeah it's such an interesting you know price there didn't didn't call that it does come with a free game which I may have hinted at before the free game is connected ventures kind of like they're a little we play type game so that'll be bundled within of course for 150 bucks and should be coming out well November 4th is that the is connected ventures the one with like the river rafting yes the Pong type game yes Jimmy Fallon that well the Pong type game I think that's in connect sports ok but this had like the like obstacle course thing that they had the river rafting stuff like that so that'd be kind of neat but you know hopefully makes it and we cost average it out makes it a little bit more beneficial I guess so if but if I want this and dance central day one that's gonna cost me what 200 bucks right yes connect games are gonna be $10 cheaper yes I guess only 50 bucks okay so it's gonna be 150 plus 50 plus tax so it's gonna cost me about 220 bucks to get connect to get connected dance central day one yes that's a bit of an investment I don't know do you think um do you think it's a bad idea to price at 150 I mean of course we all want it cheaper duh but you know I mean the reality is when you get that third digit in there I mean they cross that kind of sweet spot as a lot of people were saying of $99 getting into that third digits that can ultimately hurt the sales but no game or not I think it may hurt the sales a little bit because it is pretty expensive but I mean they're trying to make it a little better because they're thrown in the game but when you look at it though with the new console and since it's being bundled with the new console then that really brings down the cost of the camera and I guess the software to $100 so I mean are they losing money on the console or they just you know adding some sort of profit margin in there for the actual you know accessory I can tell you right now obviously it may be $150 retail obviously that's not what they're selling them for you know we probably work in about a 20% margin in there because that's usually I think what accessories go for is they have a 20% margin built-in so if you figure that I mean they have to I guess leave room for the retailers to make some money let me do a quick poll in our chat room quick poll will you buy connect and it's buy in game connected ventures this year for a hundred and fifty dollars that's why I want to know a quick poll in our chat room chat orange laundry calm if you want to answer a quick poll I want to see some yeses and nos and maybe some brief reasons why let's go around the room who plans to buy connect and who says it's a waste of your time dark soccer I like lemonade the hell does that mean but you you collect peripherals so are you gonna buy it on that principle or you like no this is one I don't need it depends on what the money's like I mean that's not really always the big thing for us we'll eventually have it I'm sure we eventually get everything so it's kind like your economic situation is gonna be okay well that's fair 150 right now is kind of steep but I've paid more for less okay Alan something interests you no interest at all none none what if they made it $50 would you buy it yeah I consider it then I'm kind of the same boat as Jamie where it's like not to be Debbie Downer but okay you know well no I bet that's a blah blah economy blah blah nine point five percent unemployment rate like I can't get that right now you guys yeah there's a lot of listeners in the same boat as you guys so I think it's a very realistic answer to say that you know because of economic situations $150 too damn much now is not the time to be asking me to buy this stuff and a lot of people actually say that's why you didn't see new systems this year and you're seeing instead upgrades to existing systems because imagine if it wasn't just $150 for connect but you know $400 for Xbox 720 with a motion feature built in for me day one I'm a little bit on the fence right now like I kind of want to do it just because I really want Dance Central and the dance the dance masters or whatever it is Konami is putting out I kind of want to get both of those day one Loki I got a little so it was a couple things yes I will probably pick it up on day one but I don't know and I don't know why I should because really I've been burned by every single camera peripheral that's been put out there ever since the I toy I mean the very beginning so fine I will bite for a fourth time but this will be the last damn time there's something interesting when you mentioned dance masters or whatever the Konami game guess what I saw listing for the other day that I guess like really I'm surprised that's still coming out is this a secret no I don't know if it's a secret I think it may even be a mislisting because I haven't looked at the actual Konami their release list yet but um dance dance revolution is back on the list of games coming out which I thought was interesting that wouldn't surprise me is that the Xbox and ps3 one yes I wouldn't surprise me they try to get out by the holiday but it now is really a bad time because you know especially on 360 where it's all about you know now you can dance without the mat it's kind of seems like really bad timing mm-hmm they really should have had that out earlier this year before e3 but I forgot to mention this during my gaming week technically not a game I'm playing but holy shit is it awesome I one of my release lists I saw I mean granted it hasn't been announced yet but I don't give a crap because it's so sweet earth defense force 2017 insect Armageddon yes they are making a sequel to the greatest one of the greatest games on the Xbox 360 in my opinion completely underrated but oh I cannot wait day one purchase for me you know and I saw that on your Twitter I was excited for you let's go back to the results of our quick poll at chat orange on twitter.com will you buy connect and it's buy in game connected ventures this year for $150 here's the results from our listeners nope no yes no yes only if a 360 is in that bundle yes because of fucking dance masters maybe I think that would be a good deal oh that's out with the 360 included 80% chance on not this year and then I don't have a job too so I don't even think about it those are the results see I told you guys here's the thing with the connect to is I like how simple it is basically I buy the system and I'm done I don't have to go oh okay now I gotta go buy all these extra accessories you know to get to work and I know that they've had there's a bunch of those price comparison charts and like feature charts that one was released by Microsoft was released by Sony which were hilarious and not the sound Microsoft centric or anything release their chart kind of seemed a little bit more fair with the comparison and what you have to buy you know to equal out a two-player setup and the cost of that versus you know Sony's saying that oh well our systems in 1080p with blu-ray as opposed to just 1080p or your substandard 1080p because it does not have blu-ray technology our system has buttons on it that is an excellent follow-up question for our Chiron let me ask this quick poll question real quick are you buying PlayStation move this year that's what I want to know how much is PlayStation move again it's it's a PlayStation move is if you buy the bundle it's gonna be $100 and it gets you one of the the move controllers the camera and a game but that does not give you in case you know granted you're gonna say oh well not all the games require you know the navigation controller yes that's also like saying not all the Wii games require the nunchuck but most of them do so you're gonna probably want it so you're going to buy another a nunchuck and to buy another move controller if you want two players and another you know navigation controller nunchuck whatever you want to call it and you know those are expensive like 30 bucks I think for the navigation controller and I want to say like 70 for the actual controller around there I could be wrong on the prices but quickly let me run around the room and see who might buy PlayStation move here Dark Sakura PlayStation move this year um really don't know okay same same kind of answer that's fine Alan I don't have a Wii yet and I think that sort of answers the same question no not at all I'm I'll tell I'm gonna say it pretty strongly here I have no interest in PlayStation move right now there's not a single game that's on it that I'm really interested in you could be you could pay charge me $50 for the whole thing the bundle of the controller everything I still wouldn't buy it it's not to say I'm hateful for everything Sony this year because I really want little big planet 2 and there's some other things that don't involve the move that are very interesting pretty much every game that does interest me that has move support I'm I'll be perfectly content with without move that's my kind of issue whereas with Kinect what are the games that interest me most over there things that you just can't do on a controller period and that you know to for all practical purposes those dance games really haven't been done before in this style Loki PlayStation move absolutely not it looks like crap and I can't believe that they made game I mean just the the whole lineup looks like junk I mean in the fact that the controller is just a total grab at the Wii stuff I mean it's basically a Wii with HD graphics and good power to them I guess for trying to come up with a system the other works for them but I don't play my Wii right now and why am I gonna spend more money for Wii type games and granted I know that the Kinect will have Wii type games because that's what they're gonna put out at launch because that's what they do they try to find something gimmicky but you can't do stuff like dance central or whatever on the Wii you can't do it with the controller setup that you have either you're gonna get things that the closest to that you can get is like a just dance type game and I really don't I'm not interested in something like that dar Tetsuya in our chat room says care to make a wager if they'll sell 1 million units of move I'm sure they will at some point because it's gonna be like a new system for them well here's it here's what's interesting you ready to see the results of our quick poll in our chat room chat that orange house radio calm are you buying PlayStation move this year you ready for this thanks to the listeners to chat that orange honestly calm here we go nope I don't think so nope no no I don't even have ps3 as of now hells no hell no no thanks I already have a we only if someone gave me a ps3 I don't have a ps3 I really have no need for a ps3 nor do I want one no and brb not a single person in our chat room and please speak up if I missed you said that they're buying it we at least had about two or three saying they were getting connect but not a single person saying they're getting move that could be very interesting not that I want to make bets cuz I don't want to make bets and we're not gonna do this crap I'm just I think move is gonna fail but they're they're gonna be able to sweep it under the rug very easily whereas connect is way riskier and I don't know if that's gonna do well or not like yeah I want one but I kind of have a bad feeling that dance central may be the only game I ever get here's the problem too with the connect is they haven't really shown off any of the hardcore games yet for it it's all been like the casual stuff they I mean granted with the move they showed hey look we can use it in SOCOM 4 and look we can use it in you know kill zone 2 if you want but they ever or kill zone 3 but they haven't really shown off anything like hey look Halo Reach is gonna you know support the move or like you know Gears of War 3 or something like that or not the move they connect so I don't know it it'll be interesting to see what happens but I I do I don't think it's gonna be like oh my god everybody's gonna run out and get these consoles it's just the same reason why even with the Wii and stuff you know the Wii sells well because it's cheap and I guarantee if this stuff starts doing well like the move in the Kinect that that console will drop in price again to the sweet-spot of $99 or even like $120 and it won't matter anymore because people will be snatching that shit up like crazy and seriously when you think about it if that's the kind of gameplay you're into why the fuck should you spend $400 on a HD console so the graphics are slightly better remember folks it doesn't matter if the you know graphics are better as long as the game is fun I mean if anything look at some of the stuff that like Capcom has done with like the 8-bit retro games those games are fun because they're fun not because they look pretty and that's the whole point is the games need to be fun a need the focus less on how pretty the games are that will only get you so far it's the fun that keeps people around all right well before I get into the next story I'm sure there's gonna be some even though our chat results came up that nobody was interested in move I'm sure there's some folks listening the podcast because we do reach a pretty big audience of the podcast comparatively there's probably somebody out there that's probably sitting there right now going man these guys just hating on Sony man man man no I'm open to and I really actually want to hear from the people that are gonna buy PlayStation move why are you buying PlayStation move and I'm not asking that in a accusatory I'm just kind of I want to know like what is it that interests you about PlayStation move I told you I'm interested in Dance Central that's kind of why I want to get connect what is it on move that interests you for this holiday season and what's motivating you to go out to get a move I'd love to hear from the listeners mailbag orange on twitter.com I was gonna real quickly show talk about just Microsoft's thing when they put out the cost of the different systems and stuff like that oh did you call this that this is gonna come out a Microsoft will put out a chart that says it like I remember you I don't remember you did you did I know you did but this is assuming that you already own the these consoles or whatever here's what it will cost you to equal up to what I guess them the place not the PlayStation the Kinect can give you so of course of connect only supports two people at least for full body capture whatever so for a hundred fifty dollars you get the connects system now to equal that on the PlayStation side you're in need the hundred-dollar starter kit which gets you the camera and the controller you're in need an additional controller which is another $50 and into navigational controllers which are $30 each total cost $210 now if you compare that with the we all you're gonna really need is another remote which is $40 they're saying that we balance board and this is mainly just so that you can play every single game that's available on the week is with you know the connect you're gonna need you know just that camera to play every single game that's gonna be available for connect and then with the you know the movie or any of those navigation controllers to play every single game on there and then an additional nunchuck so they'll cost $160 it's only $10 more than the hundred fifty dollars that's how they're saying that they're a better bargain I guess they're doing some fuzzy math it's some funny because they're also saying if you already have these systems you know it's not including the price price of the systems and then I think it's a little bit shady to to throw in the hundred-dollar balance board seeing saying you need it I get what they're where they're going with it but Microsoft's doing some fuzzy math but that's that's what that's the sales people get paid to do I get you but even like with like the PlayStation chart Sony chart you know what they're talking about the different features and stuff it's just some of the comparisons are ridiculous like for example they have like six different bullet points are that are the camera that you know obviously the the we does not have a camera so all those are no but they're like saying camera yes augmentative reality yes it's basically if you actually look and read all the stuff it's all basically the same as the connect except for you know oh there's no buttons darn you know well what if you don't need buttons on there I know that they were stressing that buttons are really important just like that they were stressing that but or force feedback was an important back when you know they didn't have the licensing for force feedback in the PlayStation 3 controller you know what they should do is they should put out a chart that's a little more honest with the price but they should just say here's what the Xbox will do that the Wii won't do you know the Xbox is in HD the Xbox has access to indie games the Xbox has this library of download content the X-Plays DVDs and don't yes basically you know just be honest yeah it's a little more money but this is what you're getting for all of it you know you it plays DVDs you can do live interactive things like one versus a hundred oh wait no you can't not anymore but you can do Netflix party well I just wondering though the problem I think that they're gonna have with these two new motion systems is that it may be too late you know what I mean it's like the Wii is so inexpensive now and it's only gonna get cheaper you know putting out these additional systems that's basically like saying oh you know you need to buy no system and fuck for $150 why don't you just go buy a Wii I mean cuz you can pretty much do that with that kind of cost so why even bother buying the Kinect when they're just basically saying four hundred dollars I just buy a Wii let me leave leave this story on this comment from our chat room chat dot orange on twitter.com because I think it's interesting frisbee says in response to something Jamie said a minute ago Microsoft does what Nintend should perhaps alright let's move on to our next story and this has to do with stuff going on in the real world that will definitely impact gaming I'm sure you guys have heard about this bill that's gonna go before the Supreme Court and it's a California bill that is basically banning the sale of violent video games to kid to get kid justice one kid actually know the kids and you know it's going to be going before the Supreme Court and because it was overturned by a lower court you know some time ago after it was signed into law well long story short 11 states have now joined in basically saying they support this bill so this is now no longer just a California issue but Connecticut Florida Hawaii Illinois Louisiana Maryland Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Texas and Virginia are now all on this too not to say that if the Supreme Court you know reverses the other decision putting the law into effect not to say that all these states will suddenly also have the law but that should tell you where California goes at least these 11 states are lined up to follow so if you want to have your voice heard you might want to call your congressperson and don't be afraid to do so because that's what they're there for that's what they're paid to do it's also the ECA you can go through the ECA mm-hmm although you know the ECA is a union you can kind of join to support and help fight it but there is nothing quite like contacting your representative directly do you want to say something on this no all right so yeah I definitely would encourage folks to contact people otherwise this is you know and again just to kind of state like you know where the issue is with this is that you know whereas yes kids should not be playing violent video games isn't that really up to the parents to be doing and not really the video game stores and why are video games being held to a different standard than you know movies is it against the law to sell an r-rated movie to a kid like you don't do it like you're not supposed to do it but is it against the law because it's going to be against the law to do video games pretty soon if this happens the last few times I've gone to Best Buy and bought an M rated game from there I've been carded and I know I pretty sure I look over 18 I am over 18 it's no real inconvenience to me but I like I appreciate that they do that and if stores just all adopted that policy I don't really understand why this law is necessary and again it should be you know if parents were doing their due diligence on what their kids were playing and buying or what they bought for their kids it's just it seems really unnecessary J rod in our chat says I don't get why this is an issue children need a parent to get into an r-rated movie or buy a parental advisory music album but is that against the law it's just that same double standard again I actually I somewhat agree with you J rod it's just that you know I think video games are being held to a different standard and that's not very fair because it's just going into that whole stereotype that video games somehow make you a more violent person I just kind of don't like what they're trying to say I don't like what you're trying to say to me all right let's move on with another story dark soccer well this is happier news this actually makes well me in particular very happy we have a couple of games coming out from both Capcom and Namco Bandai Street Fighter cross Tekken and Tekken cross Street Fighter what's the difference huh well Capcom's in charge of the former and that one's gonna be all done in that sort of Street Fighter 4 style that 2.5 D look and of the the Tekken characters will be re-image to fit that same style and a slow screen capture from it with Kazuya and Ryu and it looked really really good the gameplay looks exactly like Street Fighter 4 that will make me intensely happy they have the video of it and of course it's tag team so it's gonna be sweet and that one will have versus training and tag team and it's gonna be a full-on Capcom style now the latter is going to be more of the Tekken style play that has a 3d arenas I don't know if they're gonna be taking the the sort of a Street Fighter EX move list and importing it into Tekken or what or if it's gonna be trying to actually translate the styles of each character into a move list that would fit the way Tekken plays because there's not really any real major projectile moves like that in Tekken except for a couple of interesting moves like and there's the unblockable moves to like Jen's whole electric block thing I think in the later Tekken's the final boss would have a fireball to make them even more cheesier that's right but normally yeah they're regular characters down from what I remember now Tekken was always my big thing especially when Tekken 3 came out I was working in a Namco arcade at the time so of course we had it before everybody else did and I was like ooh I know who that character is coming out you know cuz I was keeping a keeping up with the Japanese character releases at the time we got ours in a different order than they did in Japan hmm yeah Tekken 3 was a huge deal here because it was a launch title with the ps2 yeah so if you're in line at midnight September whatever 2000 for the ps2 you are picking up Tekken 3 SSX big as Tekken Tag Tournament actually yeah Tekken 3 was on the ps1 I'm pretty sure it was with the ps1 in fact they have like a suit up version on the ps2 I think that's what they had yeah but Tekken Tag Tournament was the big thing and actually they fixed a lot of the problems that the Japanese Tekken Tag Tournament had cuz it had this weird thing where the background would almost detach from the foreground and it would really give me a headache after a while playing it but um I've got I imported Tekken 3 when it came out in Japan and actually they they censored the endings between that one in the u.s. one it's pretty funny I kind of wish if Capcom and Namco we're gonna get into bed together again I'll get to that a moment in a moment I kind of wish it was Street Fighter cross Soul Calibur personally cuz I loves me some Soul Calibur but I get it the universe the universe of Tekken and Street Fighter are similar like Soul Calibur would not really fit as well in that universe although Darth Vader and Yoda seemed to do okay yeah well Soul Calibur is taking its own kind of interesting direction you know it's it's kind of shifting in more to the customized character I would love to where's my announcement Soul Calibur 5 because we should be about ready for that don't you think Soul Calibur 4 was a couple years ago I'm just saying now what I really want to see is a Capcom I hope you're listening I want I want to know the rival schools um also let's get into this because it has kind of a funky name and we've heard people say Street Fighter X Tekken because that's what it literally reads like and we've heard like Tekken versus Street Fighter just kind of people replacing it with versus but the name actually comes from a couple years ago and I know we've talked about it on this show is a Japanese game that never came out here there was already a Namco cross Capcom and it was more of like it wasn't more like a strategy game or something just involved the characters in the various universes I think it was is a tactical stretch it was like a tactical game that is why I never bothered with it but it has some sweet music so should be known that this is not the first time that Namco and Capcom have kind of gotten in bed together this is you know kind of a logical type of follow-up so it's a little weird in a way like I don't I'm gonna admit I'm kind of sad that it's not a Capcom SNK part 3 because that's what I would really like to see because I prefer my and you know Andy Bogard and all them from the SNK universe but whatever you know I want them to do I would like to have I mean as much as a Street Fighter and Tekken seems to be such a logical choice for them to do a crossover game with because those are the two biggest franchises of each company I would like I would have preferred to have like a more generic all-out like how Capcom versus SNK was you know where you had like they had the card fighters clash game that was just pretty fun and then you had the fighting game and I like that the company's major artists did each other's art for them you know like the Capcom artist did the SNK artist and vice versa I would like to see because I'd like to have Klonoa in a fighting game that was the joke I was about to make yeah Klonoa versus Akuma well even in the trailer at the very end they show like Megaman chasing a pac-man ghost and then a pac-man chomping after Megaman like it's really weird and then I'm like are they gonna do something with Megaman universe like what the hell are these two companies planning like what is this weird like somebody is sleeping with somebody at the other company like seriously because like now what's gonna happen next kadamari damashi meets Resident Evil I mean you've made the zombie moon I should know that's how you make Pluto cuz Pluto is the dead planet we should do that as a listless some week you know the Namco cross Capcom series we'd like to see happen next that would just be all kinds of wrong but this is interesting is Capcom's got a lot of fighting games coming out because they've got this they've got Marvel versus Capcom still happening well it's all these like X versus Y Marvel versus Capcom 3 out there 3 was using my right hand but which I'm still majorly looking forward to cuz dude my team of Deadpool and Dante all as she 100 Matt in our chat room at chat.com is a nap calm that's when you read too fast I like that name nap calm damn co cross Capcom was a massive financial failure I didn't realize that but that might explain why it never came out to the u.s. I'm looking at the Wikipedia article that we got linked here and trying to see what's going on he out was a tactical game I'm trying to see how it was received oh there's a lot of characters in the different games there reception it got a 28 out of 40 in Famitsu it was the top-selling game the week of release it sold approximately 131,000 copies in its first six months of release and then it got re-released as a PlayStation to the best I don't sound terrible maybe it wasn't like oh my gosh blow your hair back but it sounds like it okay rating coming from Famitsu you know how strict they are on the ratings haven't they given like only five games a ten more like twelve and in ten dogs was one of them just saying ten dogs is great for about five minutes which is how long they must have played it for but usually yeah they've they've got some pretty strict standards but they've had their moments of weakness that's for sure well I don't know about you guys but I'm looking for this I I I played Tekken 1 2 3 like I had all those games the PlayStation 1 and then I kind of stopped playing Tekken like I didn't really ever play four or five maybe I rented four I don't remember well I remember what I got Tekken 6 from Gamefly and you came over and we played it for a couple hours that's right I had 40 characters which is like a ton amount of characters and we were like we don't we don't care it was kind of bad like yeah isn't that great we just couldn't we yeah we couldn't get into it I I really am curious to see kind of what the Tekken cross I mean cuz we all know what Street Fighter cross Tekken is gonna look like it's gonna be freaking Street Fighter 4 with Tekken characters whoopee I'm more curious to see what Tekken cross Street Fighter ends up looking like and because you know is it gonna be is it gonna kind of not be so great like Tekken 6 or are they gonna maybe get the Soul Calibur people to work on it I don't know it'd be interesting to see what happens did you see the pictures Rob I saw the pictures of Street Fighter cross Tekken but I didn't see the other way around I don't think there is because this all happened at comic-con at the Capcom panel which by the way isn't it weird that they waited for comic-con and didn't say something at e3 I mean maybe they weren't ready to make an announcement at e3 but I mean it wasn't that long ago it just seemed comic-con seems like a weird place to make that type of announcement because you know comic-con all about the comic books I thought that this particular shot was just epic and she's looking at a shot of Ryu fighting Kazuya. Ryu looks like I'm gonna punch you! I have I can tell you right now with the Tekken cross Street Fighter is gonna look like huh the Street Fighter EX series I hope not oh god I'm sorry those games were terrible I did not like them at all ex3 was all right because dude it's all about skull mania but those weren't even produced by Capcom proper it was done through an American company I really like those games so I'm surprised hearing this from you right now what the EX series I thought I think it's really underrated I liked them all okay well all yours well if Namco is doing that one in particular then I'm more than certain that they're gonna be sticking with Namco style for how they do it and they've always had really tight gameplay for the Tekkens well what was that what was the SNK game called remember those Capcom versus SNK but SNK put out what SVC chaos yeah yeah that game wasn't so great not my I mean I love me some SNK but Capcom I think made the better game it was all right yeah so all right anyhow let's move on with some more gaming news we're gonna release dates in a little bit after this next round of news starting off with Loki mm-hmm Sony has patented multiplayer via stereoscopic systems basically the way this is gonna work they actually had something similar and I'm surprised that they're able to patent this anyways they have a way now using the kind of shutter system or whatever that you'll only be able to see your I guess your player or whatever on the screen at one time while someone else can actually see the full screen as well so it'll do split screen by basically having two different images on the screen at the same time and each player will only be able to see their own you know version of the screen using those shutter glasses they actually have this already in TVs right now because I know you can actually do that with those 120 megahertz TVs and watch two different programs at the same time or two different inputs but I guess this would actually kind of combine it with only one input but it would still be two different versions of the game or whatever they're playing I don't know why but that technology sounds painful to me it's really um it's it's a neat idea but it's really it's not something that they're gonna be like oh my god you can do this it'll be kind of cool but at the same time it's kind of a dumb use of if I've got these 3d glasses that I'm paying for in this 3d TV that I'm paying for I'm gonna want to use the 3d portion of that and not necessarily the split-screen portion of that but what if you want to watch one show and your sister wants to watch another show I mean now you both can watch the same show but wouldn't it be cheaper to get a second TV no it's not that at all it's this would be just to play like it's a multiplayer game but you're just watching two different play or two different players are using the same screen but couldn't you do that if look at I mean if it's if it's canceling out one image and only showing you you know basically half the yeah you can do that with certain TVs but not this system this is a totally different system that okay so you can do that right now with certain 120 megahertz TVs if you have that shutter system you can basically do picture-in-picture or you can be stop being a little pussy and just you know look at half the fucking screen it's just spinning like hundreds up hundreds of dollars on a fucking camera or like a stupid shutter glass system just to do this just buy another damn TV like you said but the game system doesn't have the processing power to handle the split-screen those PlayStation threes with their what are they called I don't know the uber cores or whatever those are in the emotion engine no that was ps2 the ps3s have something else the cell and just sell yeah well here's the thing though but it can't handle split-screen yes it can handle split screens if it can handle two different screens it's the same fucking thing actually it's even more processor intensive what they really should have done Rob is they should have gone back to the original design of the PS remember the original design of the ps3 how ridiculous that was with like it's three HDMI outs and it's dual LAN outs and stuffs like what the fuck do you need that stuff for but I mean if that's really what they want to do with this then why not just do that so we can have two fucking TVs or I don't know how about you just stop being a little whiny bitch about it and just not worry about it seriously how many fucking split-screen games are out there not that much anymore which is really sad it is sad it should be more because there's a lot of you know like resistance was a fun split-screen game but there's not a lot of stuff out there Call of Duty you know that'll still do split-screen but it's not a lot out there and why even bother you know working on this technology for like a handful of games say you think blur split-screen the racing game except everyone hates that game for some reason I don't know why it's not that bad but you know who does have the technology to handle split screen flawlessly and who couldn't could bring split screen all our homes the Skynet just saying I can get behind that all right but I mean if you really if this is such an issue I mean I just I I don't understand I yeah some of your screens you know blocked out I've never had the problem where it's like oh my god this is just so painful I can't play this game anymore in split-screen oh my day is ruined you know I can't imagine that that would be a problem yeah because I need to go hey look we can play it to you know a two-player game or whatever but what's gonna stop someone from say I don't know adjusting the shutters on their glasses to sneak a peek at what you're doing it's exactly the same shit all over again I get motion sick with split screens really you can't just focus on one no mines don't work that way but you also can't play first-person shooters so anyways but like when we were doing racing games on split screens it would actually give me a headache after a while even Mario Kart on the old Super Nintendo yeah really that's too bad that was like the king of split screen right there yeah it was because the aspect rate will especially for the older ones the aspect ratio is changed so badly that it really starts putting a strain on my eyes too bad alright well I'm moving on to something that I don't know if they'll be able to put split screen into this but it's a new technology ish thing coming to PlayStation home it's a partnership with codename codename I guess is this indie game label that is gonna never heard of the content for PlayStation home one of the games whoa wait yeah I think you put out content like sodium one I know right well what if one of the first games is called dueling gentleman is the first game I wonder if that will be like I don't know like dueling gentleman sounds a lot like like when I think of dual I think of that game wild gunman on the old Nintendo system ok here's here is wild gunman on the NES if you've never played it's a light gun game and when the game says draw you push the button on the gun as fast as you can and on harder rounds you have to pull the trigger faster so maybe that's a dueling gentleman will be as it'll be press X button to win because that's all wild gunman was by the way it was like a $30 $40 game back in the day alright to be fair I have no idea what the hell this game is about there is a little bit of info though about this you're gonna be using I guess strategy in homes plaza to go against other people in home I have no idea what that is but I guess also peanut galleries and other developer they're gonna be making minor battle it's a capture the flag type of game and then codename is making super awesome mountain RPG it's gonna have tabletop port board games with fantasy role-playing I could be interesting bringing like a little bit of tabletop in a home so because they have super and awesome in the title does not mean it's gonna be super awesome in fact actually having super and awesome in the title usually means it's not super awesome a game by lazy eight called cogs will be in 3d and it will be a dynamic pub public spectacle in home central plaza really I thought the furry dance-off day and Sony home was the dynamic public spectacle but maybe that's just me I don't know oh I got your dynamic public spectacle and any of this is gonna be able to be translated into I don't know stuff for my apartment or a club is this gonna expand the clubs in any way maybe I don't know yeah I don't think they haven't said because it's not gonna happen didn't sodium one like have a shirt oh my god I totally misinterpreted sodium one then it's the most awesome it's the super awesomest thing ever cuz I got a shirt you couldn't you can win a shirt but but Loki it's not actually a real shirt it's not like back in the Atari 2600 days or they would actually send you patches for your jacket if you got a high enough score and like you know barnstorming or ever and they should do that that's that's what that's what achievements are their virtual I can't wear my achievements Microsoft get on that oh wait what if you could wear your achievements you technically can on your avatars somewhat they have those new unlockable things that you do for different things that's what I want like on left 4 dead 2 for the 8 360 once you unlock five or six achievements you would unlock a leopard at 2 t-shirt for your avatar which you could then wear and go on one versus a hundred and show off your left 4 dead 2 t-shirt they've done that in a few games but not a lot of used it yet and I wonder if it's something we'll start seeing more in the next couple years like blur you can get a shirt for your avatar and blur too I think there's a couple of shirts you can get one of them is really easy to get because I got it like I have a sombrero in for Red Dead Redemption I'm which I noticed the other day I'm like oh okay wonderful well we'll see if the indie games are worth launching home but for now Dark Sakura what do you got for us I have more stuff specifically for our buddies overseas in the UK this is about the halo reach Xbox 360 bundle I don't know how much of it maps over to the US but I'm focusing on our friends overseas at any rate um it's gonna be exclusive to game and game station it will be a $249.99 that's pounds will be out on September 14th it will have the limited-edition wireless controller the wireless headset those will be available in the UK on the 3rd of September and we're actually getting it later than they are over there the controller is going to be $39.99 the headset will be $34.99 and they are going to be limited and available for pre-order now as far as in the u.s. I believe that we're getting the bundle for $399 on September 14th so a new controller will be available on yeah maybe fix the fucking d-pad yet new for the record our wireless controller is going to be 60 bucks and come with a covenant banshee avatar token for Xbox Live and the headset will be 50 bucks over here and they will be in late August $60 for a controller like I realize that's how much they cost now but it's just got controllers are expensive it's a little ridiculous especially for a controller that's essentially defective all right all right let's travel around the world and see what you can waste your money on this week in the world of gaming Loki will start with you there's a couple things this week that are worth mentioning obviously Starcraft 2 on PC is gonna be a big thing but you think a Starcraft 2 the wings of Liberty remember there will be three versions of this game why I don't I don't see the point because they'll sell it three times to hold they'll sell it they'll try to sell it three times but I know think the second and third versions of the game will be that great ok but that will be coming out this week on PC a game called galaxy racers coming to the DS thanks to Ubisoft it is just like it sounds a game re-erasing space clash of the Titans coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 where you will release the Kraken or at least fight the Kraken that is released upon you at least that's what I gather that movie is about because that's all I ever see in the trailers Kraken being released all right Chuck E. Cheese party games coming to the Wii here's a hint people it's not really a brand new game per se the company UFO interactive they have taken these games called smart girls and smart boys Club and they've just re-skinned them with Chuck E. Cheese stuff you know that's really unfair to the dumb boys and the dumb girls of the world I know it's sad but that will be coming to the Wii Arc Rise Fantasia also coming to the Wii supposed to be pretty awesome RPG if you're into fighting games blaze blue continuum shift will be coming out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 I do believe PC version is going to be available soon as well although if you know where look it's already been out there for months now arcade game used to run on PC hardware and that's basically it and then my god next week there's a whole bunch of junk so I got a question y'all and I want to ask this of chat as well should I buy Starcraft 2 like I was a part of me that kinda wants it like despite all my anger at Blizzard the past month in the show like they do make some really good games and yeah I'm terrible at RTS is but I know some of my friends are buying this game and they're not very good either so I'll have people to play with right now what look cool about Starcraft 2 as the level editor and all the like fun stuff you could do with that like you know the Mario Kart type game and like stuff like that I think that will be neat well for one I want to make sure like I I kinda wanna wait for the reviews of this game to come out because I want to see what they look like I want to know if my real name is going to show in the battles like I want to see how far they took real ID in Starcraft 2 that be funny because like see like if I were to sign up on this I don't have an account or anything and no real name so I could just like create a character called dicks McButt or something like that is like you have to sign up for a battle net account to play Starcraft 2 so you know they would want you know your real name but you could always put you know Matt Loki is your name and I guess they'd really be none the wiser they wouldn't be so I don't know so I'm waiting to see what the game like as much as going to the midnight release might be kind of fun I'm gonna really resist that temptation and just like what give it a week and just kind of see what the reception is and then I guess make my decision from there I personally would wait three months two or three months because you know during that first quarter after it comes out they're all of the balance issues are gonna come out and they're just gonna patch the hell out of it and nerf all the things that need to be nerfed so wait three months and get a more more even version of the game three months I know three months in three months dance central will be here and in cataclysm will be here at DC Universal be on the way I'm gonna have time in three months for cataclysm won't be here in three months okay it's gonna take at least four months see Christmas Thanksgiving Christmas when is cataclysm coming out technically fall right now sometime November all right but the fall is the official date so far so far yeah all right let's move on to Japan and look at some of the release oh look at the some of the release dates of Japan tiger claws linking me to a story that I want to get to later in our chat room I have that on the list for later so we'll talk more about Starcraft 2 later in the show sure zone our chat room says Dix McButt should be on the wiki the orange large radio wiki maybe that's that can be like your quintessential like online name no it's just I was just trying to think of something ridiculous and I'm able to think of things that are very ridiculous all the time all right let's move on to the Japanese release date Xbox 360

classic game of the week as dark Sakura's picked well this is we're getting closer and closer to our 150th game in the classic game of the week episode 400 will be the 150 games we started on 250 because I looked at the wiki today randomly and you started this because you've had some say well let's see back in the early days of the show you didn't really have a segment like that I mean but your regular segments didn't start till we did the podcast and you had what you had the website of the week and my advice column ice column like what to do if you get caught on fire because I was using my my worst-case scenario survivor handbook calendar mm-hmm which was great like how to deliver a baby and how does navigate a landmine and how to ride a camel but I'm like I'm liking your classic game of the week they've been very good incorporate this into something for geek life to who I do Tales from the Vault every Sunday I like how you've worked in yet another plug this week for geek life go you geek dash life calm yeah but that one's the more specific about you know memories around gaming the dash is important because you need to dash on over there yeah huh I know right all right low-key ah so there's this game called rock band three that's supposed to be coming out this year sometime in the fall now we can kind of narrow it down to October 26 I'll be hitting the shelves in North America just in time for your Halloween parties where you need to rock out to stuff and then of course you with that obviously there's gonna be different pre-order bonuses for wherever you decide to pre-order the game if you pre-order the title at Walmart you get a $10 e gift card if you pre-order through Amazon they will unlock an exclusive in-game guitar for you yay that's worth it pre-orders with the GameStop will be able to download three songs for free at launch including my own summer by the Deftones blue Monday by new order and burning down the house by talking heads nice how does it feel I want to sing that song dark soccer you need to have a rock band party when this game comes out okay I'm getting a keyboard for sure now again please assure me mr. guy who works at the distributor please assure me I will be able to get keyboard plus game that's it right yes absolutely that's a bundle that is available they in fact I don't believe they have full band bundles for this one I think it's just well the the game by itself and then I want to say maybe they may have a full bundle but I haven't seen it I know that the keyboard game bundle is out there in fact I believe that it's already available for pre-order through certain websites and with stop and yes keyboard bundle $130 pro guitar $150 or you can buy the keyboard by itself for $80 what would I do with the keyboard by itself I need a game to play well I guess I could use it as a MIDI keyboard but that that's dumb I want to play blue Monday how does it feel and and the what there's the Queen song right became your Rhapsody yeah oh my god I can't wait to play these on pro expert because then once I learned how to do it you can actually go to a real keyboard what about that gets harder than $150 yeah I don't need it I don't need it but there'll be some people that want it there's some people are pretty hardcore all right one more story from me for you guys and that has to do with comic-con obviously there has been like a games invasion at comic-con this year lots and lots of stuff being shown I just wanted to run down for you guys I mean it's almost like a half of comic-con is basically three all over again but even some new stuff as we heard earlier you know with a street fighter cross Tekken and vice versa Activision is there Activision is showing off a spider-man game which I don't think made it toward the cut for our show tonight but apparently I'm hearing a lot of early buzz on the spider-man game that it's gonna blow all the others out of the water absolutely won't take much but there you go they're also showing guitar hero and call of duty as well Capcom's they're showing Marvel vs. Capcom 3 that's obviously they're big big thing that they're pushing understandably but obviously they're gonna work in plugs for dead rising 2 and Okamedan and all this other stuff EA is apparently there too they actually took rock band 3 to the show because you know when I think comic books I think rock band 3 in my living room a Dead Space 2 is there Dragon Age 2 is supposedly there and playable which is more than they had at e3 again yet another game Hudson is there to bomber man live apparently they're showing Konami is there a bit apparently Hideo Kojima is actually judging a cosplay tournament there at the show it's kind of cool so they brought some of their games to the show Namco is showing off Splatterhouse and enslaved Nintendo went to the show they took Metroid other M and Dragon Quest 9 Sony Computer Entertainment went to show off a little bit planet to kill zone 3 in Gran Turismo 5 among other things and of course Warner Brothers had to take super scribble knots to their massive booth they have and then Microsoft and Xbox took their summer of arcade lineup there that of course includes limbo hydro thunder the new Tomb Raider game among other things and th cues there lots and lots of video games square enix I guess is they're showing off Final Fantasy the four heroes alight no word on if they're showing 14 though which by the way I did I did give the beta another try this week and I got other stuff to play this fall sorry no sir he did not like it it looks really good it's pretty gorgeous really pretty but um you know a pretty painting wah wah all right forget it it's like the dumb blonde yes yes Final Fantasy 14 is a dumb blonde I love that comparison it's a bimbo not what I'd like beautiful tits but just nothing upstairs can they get that printed on the back of the box like you know how the you know how they'll take like review snippets for certain games I want that to be like Rob Roberts of Orange Lounge Radio on Final Fantasy 14 beautiful tits just nothing upstairs I like that description I like that too all right hey how about a we stop looking at new games and take a trip down memory lane segment on the show here we call the classic game of the week and every week dark soccer likes to go into the vault and find one game that she's been playing and say hey you kids in your comic cons and your newfangled stuff need to take a minute to respect the games that have come before you better recognize you better recognize now this game I know that she picked this week isn't super old but it's older than you might think sadly it's amazing dark soccer what is the classic game of the week this week hydro thunder hydro thunder let me fire up some music here from hydro thunder I love the name of that ship damn the torpedoes this one that Dan knows at any rate it was part of the thunder series of games this game came out in 1999 and had a Dreamcast release and then it came out for PlayStation and instead of 64 in 2000 and the other thunder games is offered thunder four-wheel thunder and Arctic Thunder which Arctic Thunder is pretty damn fun anyway it's racing with boats you have places like the Arctic Circle and you have New York disaster which is the post-apocalyptic you've got the Greek Isles and Thunder Park which is like a whole rally type of setting with water you've got different boosts all over the place the ones that will enable you to either go for a little bit or like get a lot of them the red ones are they give you more fuel as opposed to the blue one so you do have a fuel gauge at least as far as your boosts are concerned and then with boosting you can actually do jumps or you can knock boats sort of off the track and it's pretty cool the arcade cabinet was the same type of cabinet is cruising USA and offered thunder except it didn't have the foot pedals I used a throttle and it had a interesting type of volume deal where he just ran over a penguin that bastard I'm just saying had a subwoofer in the seat so you could feel like you're actually on a boat I'm on a boat with your boats you had the easy ones you had four categories there were easy easy medium hard and bonus with easy you had damn the torpedoes midway and misbehave they had a big fan instead of a propeller the medium boats you had banshee tidal blade thresher and the tidal blade is the cover for the dreamcast the hard ones you had cut throat a rad hazard that was sort of like UFO and Razorback which was that was on the PlayStation 1064 ones and if you pick one of those they say you're great whoa your mic cut out again I don't know what it's something is weird in that connection I don't know what it is you look at the cord and I'll use the other one all right how's this perfect okay um with the bonus boats you had tiny tannic which was a small version of the Titanic and you had the blowfish and chumdinger which was a fishing boat it would actually bark at the other boats you also have armed response which is the police boats with a turret guns there was all the different tracks like I mentioned with Thunder Park lost island the Arctic Circle then going into medium with Lake Powell which is one that was really fun it's like a lake in the middle of Utah that's actually the same Lake Powell supposed to be there's a Far East Greek Isles and then the hard tracks there was ship graveyard Venice canals in New York disaster which New York disaster was actually kind of my favorite and then the bonus ones you had Castle Von Dandy Nile adventure which was the longest tracking game catacombs and hydro speedway which was the one that was the rally style there were different versions of course like I said those the dreamcast one the PlayStation one had a career mode in it the dreamcast though was closest to the arcade of any of the consoles Nintendo 64 version was actually amazingly fun and really good for what it was it had a four player multiplayer instead of two player and you could do that with Nintendo 64 expansion pack and the dreamcast version is the one that's on Midway arcade treasures 3 there's also a PC version that was out in Europe the dreamcast version was one of the Sega all-star titles and there is going to be a sequel out well there's a spiritual sequel already out called h2 overdrive which is pretty fun the original team that worked on hydro Thunder did h2 overdrive button through all thrills and then hydro Thunder hurricane is going to be out on xbox live arcade and Microsoft bought the rights after Midway was acquired by Warner Brothers so there you have it all right your classic game of the week hydro thunder damn the torpedoes good pick I remember playing this at RV GL to cool off between ddr and this is one game that Dan picked out that I actually went with all right well thank you Dan all right if he's not here but head well you can it will be he should be listening to the show every week right all right I how that's going to do it for a part a here orange on radio but hey we have plenty more show to go we got your Twitter topics coming up in part B you'll be talking Mega Man universe a little more about Starcraft 2 fantasy star universe yes a four-year-old game will be talking about as well because there's some new news and of course our rapid-fire news all when we come back with more of orange lounge radio welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio we are taping live on this Sunday evening July the 25th of 2010 at all games dot-com all games radio which we are a part of where we tape our show because live radio is just how we've done it for the past eight years and I don't think we'd have it any other way although some weeks I don't know some weeks I know we do we love our chatters and and of course they interact with us for the emails and the calls and the tweets that you know all that good stuff so well we'll get into Twitter topics in just a little bit of course we have to do rapid-fire news in just a moment but I want to talk about this real quick remember last week on the show we had a story about the Kmart was going to be start to post reviews of it from their website they would actually post them on the shelves the story guys remember us talking about this okay well apparently um as well we told our listeners that they should start writing these completely nonsensical like stupid things and submit them into the Kmart reviews and that would be really funny just like flood their reviews a bunch of dumb stuff well we had at least one listener submit one review so thank you to that one individual who did SGA 100 Matt sent this in I love it he submitted a review of Red Dead Redemption and it's on the PlayStation 3 and I love this you have to check this out because you Bamani fans will get a kick out of this this game is dynamite rave it's a review by mr. Spanky wow I can't stop falling in love with this game this game has you go west to play the hero and tackle the hysteria of the end of the century while west you can drop out of the story mode at any time and dive into the online multiplayer with your friends be for you head over to buy this be sure to bring your ID to show to the kind lady at Kmart because it's rated M for mature put your faith in me this game is sweet like candy also holic so you should proceed immediately to Kmart's website and upvote that review and write more because that's great I know not everybody's gonna get that joke but for the money folks that's that's awesome for those that don't go write something even worse good times on Kmart reviews all right let's get into the rapid-fire news of some actual gaming news that happened this week stuff we have in short little bites for you guys Loki yes so guitar hero words of rock will be coming out in a couple months here and of course they always have to have someone epic really difficult song to play in the game well apparently there is going to be one track very similar to some other long songs that have been in the game it will include Russia's 20 minute long seven part epic 21 12 and I guess it's a few parts that are progressive rock and then I don't know I've never heard the song but that's a long ass song 20 minutes that's ridiculous it's almost like that one achievement in rock band that you have to play like every single song in the game and it takes on it like an hour or two yeah that makes me think of um any god it is my my working I don't I think barely we just you're it's it's wired for Jamie not you try giving that one to Jamie and use that one live radio yeah as far as epic songs for rock band or since they have a keyboard they should do in a gada da vida which I think is a good 23 minutes with the keyboards so yeah good times yeah that song is one whole hallucination something else that was at comic-con this week and I don't even know why it was at comic-con it's like kencha Hulk type of stuff but apparently they had a game from an independent developer called a Bobo's big adventure and you may not remember a Bobo but sadly I think I do a Bobo is from Double Dragon ah yes and but was big adventure has him going through a bunch of 8-bit NES classics kind of parody style it is a PC game but they had it displayed on a cabinet I would like to read this brief I'm sure this game is extremely legal yes I would like to read this brief description of some of the levels here let's see here okay the first stage that this person played looked just like Double Dragon starting off he encountered typical enemies and fought them off with the exact same control scheme from the original Double Dragon game but then the the guys from kung-fu showed up all in a row goombas from Super Mario Brothers waddled into the screen and Kid Nicky followed and he was trying to fall fight them all off but then Donkey Kong jumped up on the surface above and started throwing exploding barrels as head has it was like all of NES done was out to get him I these they only felt better when an 8-bit bystander walked up to a Bobo and he ripped his head off and ate it and then used his body to fight a charging skateboard from TNC surf what there's another another level called super my Bobo found a bow in a jail cell after picking up trash and eating it a Bobo had to use the cell toilet something he ate must not have agreed with him because a massive vertical column of shit came out of his ass and somehow had him flying over the toilet and falling down into or down into it yes you're just making this up really this ends up to being like a warp pipe the Super Mario Brothers and both finds himself in a parody of the water world from that game and he has a Yoshi like tongue that enables him to eat and spit enemies into other enemies there's also apparently some Megaman I saw in there I feel like a bunch of like 19 year olds got really high one night and in between eating Cheetos they just started like talking and somebody was like dude dude that's really good like dude show the dude that's hella funny dude dude you should write that down dude and like they did like things to get posted to new grounds when you're blackout drunk basically funny that you should mention that new grounds because that's where this game will be featured at some what a surprise as what a goddamn surprise I'm gonna fall over and die from that surprise dot-com so yeah but was big adventure supposed to be out in December it looks funny I guess I don't know and then finally that plot he read sounded like the plot to the poop that took a pee the poop that took a pee it was on an episode as narrated by Morgan Freeman why it was Morgan Freeman it wasn't Morgan Freeman the poop that took a pee he can I Leo Poland a butterscotch anything uh legend of mana is gonna be the next game hitting the Japanese PlayStation 1 classics nice on the PlayStation Network of course be out next week for 600 in or 650 so I mean it's gonna be to other regions soon speaking of poops it took a pee like legend of man it's like seriously like my least favorite PlayStation game I was so disappointed in that game I realized it has its fans and what have you but I was I was expecting what I think was really then keep in mind this was many years ago I didn't know there was this whole like import gaming scene everything so in my mind what really was second at set to three I thought was what I was kind of getting with was going to get with legend of mana and then it was like I don't understand what what what is this but you liked it didn't you Alan you tell me one day I did I did like it's wrong I played it all the way through I did every little stupid class you probably like saga frontier too well I had the Japanese it was terrible and it was so hard it was so heavy language wise I couldn't play it very well do you like the saga series too yeah I got I was really excited about saga frontier because it made it sound like chrono trigger with the combo attacks okay yeah and I played it and yeah that was pretty awful behind lasted an hour yeah I lasted about an hour to us like this game is terrible all right anyhow let's move on to some other quick news hey up there in canadia you're gonna be getting Netflix finally of course I'm talking about Canada I'm not that stupid Canada's finally getting Netflix I actually I gotta be honest I didn't realize they didn't already have it like I usually with a lot of this broadcast stuff they get the rights cleared pretty quickly but sadly yeah Canada's kind of been shut out so they will finally be getting Netflix up there but you should be aware if you're French Canadian and you don't speak English well I don't know why you're listening to this show for one but yeah the French Netflix service is not going to be out right away but it will come out eventually so you will be able to get this in Canada on the 360 the ps3 and we so they are not really they're being a little vague on if it's going to be the exact same movies and so forth because the clearance is and so forth but they do give you the nice little marketing fluff of Canadian Netflix members will be able to instantly watch a broad array of movies and TV episodes right on their TVs via a range of consumer electronic devices capable of streaming from Netflix as well as PCs and Macs so yeah I you know you're going to be getting it but it's probably not going to look the exact same as it does here at least not right away so yeah Joystick had emailed Netflix looking for comment and Netflix responded to the big blog we're not announcing the Netflix ready devices until the service launches but it's fair to assume that several popular brand name devices will be capable of streaming from Netflix to TVs at launch in addition to the ability to watch instantly on computers and that will add to the family of devices over time so hooray for you guys in Canada I suppose Plants vs. Zombies is going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade finally early September I played I played this on an iPad this week a little bit because yes I was looking at an iPad I wanted to buy one then and I thought mmm I really should I already have an iPhone what I really needs an iPhone 4 but you know get into that on the iPhone 4 ok yeah so it's going to be in 1080p and 21 different minigames co-op and co-op and versus mode 1200 Microsoft points so sometime in September Castlevania puzzle encore of the night is now available on the App Store it's actually getting pretty decent reviews so I checked it out I haven't been able to play it myself but just if you were curious it is now available on the App Store so I'll have to check that out at some point sadly I can't do it right now because I'm trying to do a show Dark Sakura in other news we have LittleBigPlanet 2 dated for the 16th of November I'm here in the US the European dates not out yet and the collector's edition will have a plushie Sackboy and bookends and there will be different pre-order and exclusive costumes and five

space tank it's DSi aware also known as Xscape then we've got as soon as it loads because my computer slow minor disturbance and my ner which is for iPhone it's 99 pence Astro dodge which is also for

other cool news for those of us who are Capcom fans is that they're doing an online version of Street Fighter 3 third strike which they're calling it Street Fighter 3 third strike online which is an update to the Dreamcast one but you want to know what they already made it and I already own it it was the for matching service you remember how when everything has a long title I usually end for matching service on it that's it it came out in Japan already so I've already got it yeah but most people over here never heard of it so you know with the success of their online games I'm assuming they're just giving this the old Xbox live arcade update correct yeah pretty much so but it is well that mic sucks Jamie I don't know what to say you know it's probably me because my voice isn't very no I mean you cut completely out it's the cord it's not your voice well shit exactly huh yeah all right I'll take Alan's mic thank you you're being nice for sharing let's move on to some Twitter topics twitter.com slash olr you guys send us tweets every week and we respond to them live on air maybe there's stories we didn't get around to sharing who knows what it's all about we're gonna start off with death death wishing tonight do you guys hate Kotek to the evil CEO he's my least favorite human being next to Aquaman do we hate Bobby Kotek hey is a strong word and yes but yes all right um TigerClaw305 sent us a link he always sends us great links Disney is in talks apparently to buy Playdom. Playdom by the way made such awesome Facebook games like sorority life didn't Disney just buy somebody Disney bought what Tapulous and so now Disney is in talks with Playdom buy them out for five hundred million is what they're saying again these are all rumors but Disney's gonna use this company to incorporate its popular brands and characters into social games Playdom by the way is based out of Mountain View California I never knew that that's not that far away so yeah there you go apparently Disney might use its ESPN brands on some of this as well could be very interesting Playdom ranks third behind Zynga and Playfish by the way just you know of big social game companies let's see some folks retreat we're tweeting our congratulatory message to Bobby so grads Bobby let's see spazz nator says do you think we'll ever see a Mortal Kombat versus Street Fighter game there's been a lot of talk tonight about Street Fighter cross Tekken what about the two ultimate I guess in some regards maybe even top if you dare go there fighting game franchises Street Fighter Mortal Kombat could it ever happen what do you guys think good Street Fighter versus Mortal Kombat ever happened it could they play nice with Warner I mean obviously they're playing nice with other you know publishers so it could happen whether it will happen or not I don't know I think someone did a Mugen one where they took the the Street Fighter movie ones in the old Mortal Kombat that were all the image capture and did a Mugen version Mortal Kombat is sort of all about the fatalities and the over-the-topness and you know all those Street Fighter has some over-the-top I don't know if I could see it like I can't see the Street Fighter characters really doing fatalities and then if you take the fatalities on a Mortal Kombat like what's left you know now what if they did Mortal Kombat versus crap that eternal champions what you got it how long ago is eternal champions eternal champions needs to come back with the Senate bills and everything just do a real kill again throw kill is horrible yeah I don't see a game where Sakura gets her spine ripped out I just I can't I can't there is something wrong with that like how would you feel about that dark Sakura if there was a game where you could just like totally rip Sakura's arms off well as long as they included a non-black your ear out again it's just a dammit though I am I in now yeah okay I was basically saying if they included a non blacked-out version of the shingle kusatsu with all kinds of you know beating up and you know breaking noses and bones and having it be really destructive and leave them as a bloody pulp then maybe I could deal with it I don't know there just would have to be too much compromise one way or the other I just don't see like Street Fighter and Tekken kind of makes sense and as much as I love Soul Calibur like it wouldn't make sense like the Street Fighter people don't use weapons weapons are a huge part of Soul Calibur it would make sense so but Street Fighter Tekken yeah I get that I get it all right let's see other comments on our twitter twitter.com slash o-l-r Matt SJ 100 Matt is sending us a tweet is Capcom jumping the shark releasing all of these versus games all at once I'm excited but this should have happened ten years ago honestly thank Street Fighter 4 I honestly think Street Fighter 4 is the reason for a lot of this and I think the really warm reception the community had to this kind of made them decide to listen to the fans a little more and now they are just just giving fans what they want left and right it's kind of like what game do you want oh you want oh well here you go then it's kind of where Capcom is going lately you know so I don't know dark soccer do you think this is too much or not enough or what I think it's just right all right all right and last tweet from rock man rock that's not a redundant name at all I love that name rock man rock why are you guys so awesome is the tweet why are you guys so awesome I was born that way well it's that's very nice I some days I do think I'm awesome but some days I don't feel so awesome but Rob why not I just you know some days are harder than others but your tweets help me get through the day I appreciate it twitter.com slash olr if you want to send us some tweets for now more news loki yes so apparently their rock star is cracking down on Red Dead Redemption cheaters now I have a problem with them saying that because that's not exactly what's going on here they're cutting I guess they're cracking down on people that are utilizing glitches in the game for example they're saying that people are glitching into parts of the map that you're not supposed to be able to glitch into like for example there's a house that's in kind of the Mexico part of the game or you can actually kind of aim at or walk into the corner of a wall and you'll clip through the ground and you can shoot at stuff underneath it and apparently people are pissed off that they're getting shot by people that they can't shoot back at and so because of that you know they're gonna start patching the game or fixing it so they can't clip through these different things whatever fine do that people will just find other glitches since the game is super glitchy but it's not legitimate cheating say you know where they've modded the game to make their guns fire rockets or something like that like that happens in Grand Theft Auto like crazy no one's figured out how to do that yet because exploits are not hacks there's a huge difference between an exploit and a hack exactly and you know I don't understand why people are up in arms about this crap because you just don't go where those players are then because you can see them on the map they're not invisible and obviously if they're under a building or something they keep shooting at you then perhaps you should walk away from them I mean there's no real hacks or whatever to say you know immediately kill somebody you know with homing bullets or something ridiculous like that nothing like that yet but you know when they make a gun that starts firing dynamite or something that's different but just because people are you know clipping through stuff doesn't really necessarily make it a cheat I also agree that exploits are not cheating because like you know I've played a lot of these online games like you know kind of like fan games don't make fun me okay I like Survivor and Big Brother and a lot of those like a reality shows that have very game centric things and you know people put together challenges and I love to find loopholes in the challenge rules and win every time like that's you know I do that unity is very important I do similar stuff in Grand Theft Auto there's different exploits you can use they're not necessarily it's not cheating I guess because it's still playing within the rules of game and everybody can do it just because they don't know about it doesn't that's not my problem that you don't you know read up on this stuff like there's a way to fire the sniper rifle really fast by crouching and crouching there's ways to fall off a large from a large distance and not take any damage by doing a stunt role in mid air you know stuff like that but you know it's stuff that I've learned through you know just reading online and through when you've seen people do stuff and kind of figuring out how they did different things and it makes me a better player now granted it's not like I'm using you know modded weapons that fire rockets at people like crazy and there's lots of people out there to do that there's a difference between utilizing you know the nuances of the game you know the different glitches and actually cheating in the game to the point that it's an unfair advantage knowledge is not cheating cheating is cheap alright and if you cheat in an online game you're kind of a dick anyway unless you're cheating with your friends and you all agree that cheating is okay that's different well if you're doing that then you know like the modded games that will play against each other that's not necessarily cheating it's just you're playing with a whole different set of rules now or fun it's it's a mod it's not it's not cheating it's like if we played our with our modded weapons against other players that would be cheating so a mod it's a mod here Loki here's something to entertain you while I do this next story here here you go how to entertain you for I am NOT I'm not playing this on an iPhone I'm sorry I feel dirty for having robot unicorn attack and it's it's it's Loki's favorite game and they have an iPhone it's not my favorite game but yes it is your favorite game you play it all the time during the show I'm surprised you're not playing it tonight and they have it on the iPhone now and it you know you just tap the screen to do your jumping and I can't see you this directions I'm probably falling everywhere but there you go I played this a lot this week too all right good times remember always I want to be I almost forgot to show that to Loki was something reminded me of that early I knew it was out other people like me I can't believe you made me buy that game because it's you know you keep talking about like I haven't played it in like months now you are playing it last week on the show I was not playing it last week on the show two weeks ago on the show it wasn't two weeks ago either yes it was I'll go in the archives and find it and like if you if you turn up the music really loud in the background you'll hear oh you should totally make this for your baby's room what's that it's a toadstool stool sorry and I told you and I'm easily out of it easily distracted kind of that's all right well here's something that's very distracting it's this Old Spice ad on the left side of this page here with the Old Spice guy because you know he's awesome anyhow I know really it's about the Mega Man universe a little more information I mean little little more information at comic-con this week from Akiko Ido actually talked about this a little bit he's the producer I'm sorry actually it's a Kenji Inafune actually talked about this he's the producer of Mega Man universe and no he's the creator of Mega Man no he's a homeless man I don't know Kenji Inafune is the creator of Mega Man and Akiko Ido is the Mega Man universe producer there we go can't you tell I'm like totally up on my video game trivia anyway Mega Man universe of course is coming out eventually and they say it will let you play as the Mega Man of your dreams the concept of Mega Man universe quote came from the idea of what Mega Man is and what it means to different people everyone has a unique idea of what Mega Man is and they even referred to the quote crappy version of Mega Man from the original cartridge that character they don't know about they didn't really say like what the game really really is but a lot of people are inferring like maybe it's just like that and I think Loki said this last week on the show it's kind of like that Nintendo championships or whatever they call that game with all the Nintendo characters the Nintendo crossover game or Mario crossover right they say that it's gonna quote unite Mega Man fans from around the planet to play together in one place then they close by saying you haven't heard the last of the Mega Man announcements out there and they say they're gonna give an oft requested thing to what you guys want and the crowd promptly started shouting Mega Man Legends 3 and he just smiled and said thank you and didn't confirm I hope so by the way the game we're gonna be we only cuz I will be pissed the game will also not be out for a while I don't know what a while is but it's gonna be a while I want to know where the universe thing is if that means online or if that's because of all the characters in it I think it's gonna have all the different games in it be in another galaxy thank you dark Tetsuya Super Mario crossover that's what I was thinking of alright dark soccer what do you got for us stuff and this is for Marvel vs. Capcom actually which is some pretty cool stuff I'd like to say four new characters have been confirmed at comic-con we have her Chun Li yeah I like Chun Li I'm like that hater over there hater dr. doom because all must fall before doom the Super Scroll I have to mention real quick I saw a license a custom license plate the other day that said I am doom that's cool okay super scroll who is a newbie in the versus whole deal and he's I guess we're gonna have all the powers of the Fantastic Four and Trish mmm Trish and in the teaser trailer there was the outline of the beautiful Joe so pretty cool Trish ah is leathery tasty didn't they also announce the my jumping ahead I'm sorry what the dog from Okami or did I think yeah I saw you is good yeah it's awesome I said that right yeah yeah good times all right um yeah that's and also Thor yeah so I guess there's a lot of characters they're showing mm-hmm good times look you what he got for us this is kind of funny apparently South Peak this is like the lawsuit that really no one would care about South Peak is suing Majesco over my baby three so when you over my baby apparently who that is my baby mama South Peak games that is taking a legal action against Majesco specifically regarding the right to publishing my baby titles in the United States this was spurred by an announcement last month I guess that Majesco would publish my baby three and friends an action South Peak claims Majesco wasn't legally allowed to take for its part a South Peak issued this statement on the impeding litigation we're exceptionally proud of our success in making the my baby franchise really in North America our innovative sales marketing PR strategies brought my baby to a huge audience and built no sense of shame built a loyal fan base for future products oh wow where okay South Beach continues to hold the rights to subsequent my baby games and we intend to vigorously protect those rights additionally we've confirmed that while South Peak claims a contractual right to publish subsequent my baby games in the u.s. noblest owns the my baby IP so it's up to I guess noblest to decide I guess who publishes what and yeah so basically they're just complaining about that but I don't know I think it's dumb honestly I know that my baby games sell somewhat because people people like their sim games and little girls love this stuff but I mean honestly we're talking like these games sell maybe maybe 200,000 units I mean those are like I've judgment numbers there I mean to give you an example how how much these fail so I don't know I'm surprised that they wouldn't be suing like for say babysitting mama or something like that I'm surprised these games are such a big fucking deal in the first place you'd be surprised like imagine games they're terrible they have so many that come out they sell and even like littlest pet shop which I hate you EA and you're fucking three versions of the game they got to put out each year those sell well too it's just weird all right well this is also kind of weird but cool I guess that it was considered but it didn't happen this is running on a website I've not heard of these guys before but gamer annex.com was running this story and it kind of caught wind and ended up on a lot of game blogs this week and it was a comment that Rahul sued the voodoo PC founder and he's also the current CTO of gaming at Hila Packard he actually revealed a couple months ago that there was a secret project or an interesting one or a quiet one nonetheless at Microsoft it would have allowed PC gamers to actually match up with console players so it wouldn't just be like Final Fantasy 11 wouldn't be the only game they'll be cross it is not the only game what else is cross platform shadow run was cross platform right okay and also I believe there was another strategy game that was man I don't remember which one it was there was I want to see minesweeper was a kingdom under fire or something like that it was some sort of game similar that that was cross-platform by no shadow run was well they were testing Gears of War and unreal tournament but it didn't end up happening here's why I've heard from reliable this is a quote from our whole suit I've heard from reliable sources that during the development they brought together the best console gamers to play mediocre PC gamers at the same game and guess what happened they pitted console gamers with their console controller against PC gamers with their keyboard and mouse the console players got destroyed every time so much so that it would be embarrassing to the Xbox team in general had Microsoft launched this initiative I know there's a little bit of that that sounds fanboy to me especially knowing that these other games are out there what what are you coughing about over there when we played Left 4 Dead online together on our PCs and I found out that you were playing with the Xbox controller I was giving you side-eye for that reason why I was mouse mouse and keyboard is superior and now this is I was is the story I tell you if they had cross-platform playing Grand Theft Auto I would eat up any PC player anybody out there I would destroy them but that's not a first-person shooter and I think it doesn't matter it still has first-person shooter kind of controls I would destroy them all of them I don't give a shit if you're using a tomato to control the game I will destroy you feel like there's this whole kind of like fanboy war about keyboard and mouse versus Xbox 360 controllers that is continuing to be perpetuated on this very program all they need to do is just offer keyboard mouse support for these games on the Xbox oh wait but then they wouldn't be able to sell $60 controllers I guess but I mean this way it wouldn't be that damn hard there's USB ports I mean would it be really difficult to I don't know map keys in a game or something you can't work well you can mouse here's the funny thing you can plug in a keyboard I used to use a keyboard on fancy 11 for certain games but in I guess if you know by certain accessories there's ways that kind of shoehorn it in there but why they don't offer it as an actual solution for you know say Call of Duty and stuff like that is beyond me because I think that'd be a great idea but then again they wouldn't be able to sell accessories like they do I don't really think it's a big deal because most people probably buy a controller anyways they're not going to just use strictly keyboard mouse for everything but it'd be kind of cool and I wonder if they could actually do that like have support for that I'm trying to look at some of our comments in our chat room chat that orders on show you a calm legend is aku is saying Loki prepare for an ass-whooping with an eight-year-old logitech mouse I think but unfortunately you can't I mean you can't with you can't with Grantham auto because it's not a wall obviously because it's not crashed no cross-platform and especially if it's on 360 there's nothing cross-platform anymore that's too bad bonds 006 in our chat says I will die with a keyboard in my hands I've tried playing keyboard mouse I just I don't don't like it I you have to play team fortress 2 with it like you can't use a controller in team fortress 2 and it's probably part of the reason I'm forced to play a medic because you don't really have to aim very well you should lay on the 360 I guess I could but then I'd have to buy the game again I already bought it on Steam I remember when Left 4 Dead 2 came out last November and there was a lot of drama on a lot of the major blogs like joystick and Kotaku who played the 360 version of the game and they gave it like mediocre reviews saying it was too hard and then the sites that reviewed it on PC said it was fine and I guess the people played it on Xbox 360 just couldn't they just kept getting wiped out so I think you know the game was developed for both platforms but the keyboard mouse people just had an advantage I don't know keep fanning those flames yeah and it's like why did you give that game a seven it all came down to the controller according to the reviewers again I hate to keep going back to this and it's not a first-person shooter but Final Fantasy 11 you could play with the controller in that game and Jamie didn't she did quite well with it I mean you have to set up your macros in advance but you can do it but I I would I had the triggers on top and I would just cycle through my macro see my trigger buttons mm-hmm and Rob Rob saw me do it mm-hmm the complete edition was like five bucks on Steam this week I saw that it was a part of me that just just kind of wanted to play it for a month really it really was gonna come down to if you want to do games that are cross-platform like that and you want to have everybody on come the same page you make the controls more console friendly I guess because that's what they're doing with DC universes they're making the stuff kind of translate over you know it the controls are simple as it is and so it translates over well to the actual controller I I was you know it's funny and I don't know if I should be repeating this but I was told that the three that the part of the reason why the games are not cross-server at this time is because it played so much differently on the PC versus the PlayStation 3 and that one was having an advantage over the other and I wonder if it comes down to this whole same issue it's the PlayStation controller versus keyboard mouse could be now see I'll play Warcraft with a keyboard mouse I couldn't play that with a controller I think I don't you think you can play that with a controller I don't know but be weird well like see like for example when I played PC games I use an Xbox 360 controller a lot of times you know Grand Theft Auto and Crysis I played with PC or with a 360 controller it worked great for me I never had any problems getting killed I don't want to keep on with this debate I want to hear what our folks have to say in the mailbag but one more story from Dark Sakura about another MMO right yeah for Phantasy Star Universe they're getting a pretty big update there is going to be the ambition of the illuminous expansion which is a free download and I paid $15 for abortion of the illuminous like two years ago bastards the Guardians advanced content content is an automated update for the subscribers with new missions weapons items customization system and overhaul the games class classes and skills and guardians will require ambition of the illuminous to work so that's why it's free pretty much and I guess they're basically taking into account all of the problems that people had with Phantasy Star Universe that you know all the stuff they took away from online that made it so much more fun I do think PSO was more fun you think it's worth revisiting maybe hmm I don't know that I want to play it on the 360 maybe to look at for like a day yeah and they shut down the servers to all the other formats didn't they think it's only on 360 now but they offered some support for free servers hmm all right well let's get into the mailbag every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orange launch radio.com we pick a few of our favorites and make dark soccer read them for you guys live on our program mailbag at orange lounge radio.com okay this is from rubber buff the first one it I'm not going to fully review the puzzle agent game as it's much like professor Layton it's on steam by telltale games who say my max episodes sold well let's say it's a game where you are in a town with OCD about puzzles there's a very little point-and-click where you play trading games to advance is mostly all dialogue and puzzles I'm also playing the game la-di-da and suddenly the game ends at what is typically the middle of the story I'm not upset about the game being too short I'm mad because the game was not listed as episodic either that or I completely missed it a game like this is typically $5 but they have a single illustrator so perhaps that bumped the game up to $10 I'm also into Xbox live arcade game limbo the game reminds me a lot of out of this world that's because you were alone and the world feels completely alien despite the familiar setting of a forest if sky remembers I made a little big planet level in the same style called UFO story and then they came it was gray silhouettes foggy and add strange lighting effects limbo even had a tire swing at the beginning of the game I'm taking no credit though it had to be coincidence plus my little big planet level is nowhere near as good as limbo in fact it gets tedious although I'm very proud of the spinning boss at the end that foggy gray noir setting is nothing new in games by the way it took me a good 80 hours to make that little big planet level a little bit construction is not for the dabbler a somewhat okay level takes 80 hours I wonder what a good or great level to ice I do remember that level and when I read the email earlier this week I actually was like oh yeah it kind of did have that same kind of look and feel to it it's kind of funny I I totally remember what you talk about Robert but he says I'm going to Disney World again probably bring me back some pins jerk I want to go to Disney World pins can I go to Disney World Rob and I trade pins last one is from Troy hey olr Troy again have you guys seen the new Halo Reach Forge mode I don't know how big of the FPS fans you guys are but if you like Halo the new Forge is like a little big planet for Halo also I went on a super stardust HD week and hopefully made it pretty high on the ranking list for the big battle also people who have the games are listening really should join the big battle I know I was bored of video games so this came up and now I think I left competitive gaming again that's it oh well I'm sure the folks that put that all together will be very nice to hear that yeah very happy to hear that okay let's move on angst this is the part of the show where we get out our angst it's called the F use of the week okay the first one would be me witness a few to the hole in my hand because okay it was fine with this just the stitches cuz it would pull a little bit and it was alright but now it's like my hand is a lot more sore than it was last week since the stitches came out especially with that hole that now I have to do extra stuff to keep it closed and worth thick bandages on my palm it just makes my hand hurt a whole lot more and the sad thing with that is that typing on my keyboard hurts a lot and like I'll message people a little bit but like using my mouse hurts too but if I'm doing the two of them together then it really hurts and that's actually made it hard for me to play Star Trek online so I haven't been doing all the gaming haven't been really doing that much chatting online or anything it's just it's just really sore it's actually the whole the weird problem about it is that even though it's sore up at the top of my palm the back of my hand is really sore too and I think it's where the bruise was left over from where they did the blood drain so I'm just sore and it makes me a grumpy grumpy grumpy girl like grumpier than usual that's really grumpy alright you need some more vitamin B no I don't need more vitamin B I need ice cream look I want ice cream I don't work tomorrow just saying Loki um f you to whoever was causing some crime today on greenback lane they actually have the whole street blocked off with again tape it was ridiculous so I had to go way around it and I just like that and bad drivers people stop being stupid like just in general like I'm not talking listeners of the show clearly or not stupid because you're listening to this show but just like the people out there instead of listening to the show that are out there on greenback Avenue shooting each other stop being stupid seriously serious all right let's see my f you of the week I'm gonna give an F you to Apple I know Loki's in heaven right now but I think it's total bullshit that they release this OS that screws up my old phone forcing me to get a new phone but the new phone is not available anywhere bullshit I'm actually contemplating getting a different phone right now because I'm thinking like I need the iPad who does everything the phone does but then I'm still I know I'm still biting the hand that I want to protest and I'm just a hypocrite and blah blah blah blah but let's face it the iPhone is now kind of a gaming platform there's a lot of missing out on if I don't have one slices pop what are your F use of the week F you to the month of July I'm usually endeared to this month because it's my birthday month but a lot of people that I follow on live journal that I've been reading for years have been having to deal with sudden deaths of like family members and their partners and I have a friend who had to have ankle surgery due to complications from his ankle surgery he now has pneumonia figure that one out so yeah it's been a really hard month for a lot of people that I care about online so that just sucks that I can't really be there for them because they live far away if you had a distance and people that are far away that you can't like be there for yeah I get that sucks all right I have another one quickly my brother's crazy F you to his brain disease mine too but in a whole different way you know holy he's a he's a special kind of crazy but we won't get into that on this episode of Ricky lake alright Loki is some gaming news and then we'll get to the skype line at 1877 game olr Loki yes not to be outdone by Google YouTube also has an Easter egg on it that allows you to play a game apparently if you go to Google or not Google YouTube it's owned by Google now so it doesn't matter if you go to youtube.com and pull up any video whatever hold down the left arrow on your keyboard and after a few seconds you should be able to play the game snake over the top I got a sneak man I used to love snake on the old cell phones fun fun times that's what I need to do I'm gonna go trade in my iPhone and go get me like one of those like old ass Nokia phones that have snake on it good times it does still work you can probably get snake for iPhone it's not the same it's not the same as much as I appreciate why we are one of the listeners of the show and I do I do think snake 360 is a good game it's just not the same as playing it on the old school cell phone you know what I mean you're right one other story for you guys then we're gonna get to the skyline 877 game olr yada yada this is about Starcraft 2 this is Starcraft 2 story they're saying the launch for this is going to be big big huge gigantic because you know lots of stores are doing the midnight releases of course this game's been what like 10 years in the making blizzard is not saying how many copies of the game has been pre-ordered because they don't get into that but they are saying that it's it's gonna be big there's these midnight launch events everywhere it's a $60 game it's number one and number two on Amazon right now because obviously there's a regular and collector's edition it's been in the top 100 best-selling games for over three months Walmart staying open late GameStops Best Buys and so forth they're the this story that I'm reading from the Orange County Register which is not a video game site specifically it's more of a blizzard obviously is in Anaheim which is kind of Orange County they are talking about this 18 year old who apparently plans to wait 72 hours in line for Starcraft 2 when asked why he said it's really hard to explain I don't know it's just something I'm crazy enough to enjoy I guess if people can stand in line for Twilight for that long I guess they can do it for Starcraft 2 anyhow World of Warcraft Wrath of the Lich King sold 2.8 million copies when it came out in the first 24 hours they think this could possibly top it one thing though that is not going to help sell the game is reviews there will be no reviews of Starcraft 2 Wings of Liberty before it launches on Tuesday the press will be reviewing the game when everybody else does I guess the publisher feels that the battle net service and the online features is so essential to the game that opening them up early when it's not really ready to go for the press to review it could be detrimental to the game yeah because people will pirate it like they've already know the copies have already come out but you can't play it until the battle that servers are up there's gonna be a day one patch for the game in order to give the developer quote a little bit more time to sort of get their ducks in a row that's basically telling me the game's not really totally ready and it comes out Oh Tuesday so kind of what Alan was saying earlier why don't you just wait three months for them to just actually get the game working there's a lot of pressure on it Blizzard right now because if this game is fails on launch day it's gonna be a lot of shit for it I will say this I don't know if I can stand to wait three months but I am gonna wait for the reviews of the game I think that's pretty bold of Blizzard to say yeah we're not gonna send out our game for review it'll sell without it yeah I'm a little confused because I know that a lot of the major review sites to get their copy two weeks early but they're just not allowed to publish the story until release date in which case all the sites try to scoop each other so does this mean that they're not getting the game at all I don't know they're not really saying for sure but they can't play it even if they have it they can't play it well and a lot of times they can do some really shady shit with those embargoes too because a lot of times you can break the embargo if you gave the game a 90% or better like that shit really happens out there and it's kind of sick like and that's why you know we're here about really supporting the independent media because we don't have to really play by those rules granted we don't get the early copies of the games because of it but you know just keep in mind if this site got a world exclusive review and it's like the first to run with it if that review is an a or something of the equivalent a question it you should question it because they could very well be doing it especially if it's a no-name site trying to get the additional traffic they could be doing it just to get the traffic kind of sad toa gak in our chair him says code your damn games on time or admit failure damn these day one patches I don't think the game is going to be like terrible but it's going to be interesting to see if the servers can handle at day one it's gonna be a big demand big big demand the internet will come to a screeching halt this week chaos all right let's open up the Skype line at 1 877 game olr our username on Skype is orange lounge radio that's all one word please if you were using Skype for the first time make sure you give echo one two three a call on Skype or I think they actually build it in there in there now it's like make a test call and you can easily hear if your sound settings are okay because when we pick up and no one's there it's a little bit frustrating all right while we wait for some calls to come in do we have any last-minute stories in house I do not looky I do but I'll have to look them up I thought yes I'm ready to go you're too busy shopping I am shopping well luckily we're getting a call you're being saved by a phone call hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this hey it's wrong everyone hey Rama you're the master of zerg rushing our phones what's up the first thing I want to bring up is what you said about the guy that was online for 72 hours for Starcraft 2 he's standing in line yes I think that you know that I was on the line for the week and I was out there for you about a day and a half there were people out there my older brother was out there no my younger brother that this is Thursday for okay Wow by the way don't adjust your sound Rama is cutting in and out we're not sure why I don't know if it's your speakers or mate they might buy and some make this quick and just get going for Torrance okay go ahead I'm not running in porn torrents I'm not Loki all right I don't want my porn I downloaded off Houston okay anyway Rama yes you were you were in line just as long okay I get it but you're also black Luigi you have to be out there I mean like it's not a Nintendo party without black Luigi I suppose so but I just say you can't go out for something like that cuz we've all done this I mean you guys got it didn't get on the line for the week she was out there interviewing people handing out stuff you know because it was total promotion for our show cuz you know we can't afford million dollar ads no I mean we got into it extra for waited in the line he was but I waited in line whether we keep in mind to this is important if we hadn't waited in line we wouldn't have got one there's gonna be plenty of Starcraft 2 available day one it's not gonna sell out like crazy you're gonna be able to find it but you know if software is a lot easier to make than hardware right true true but still I'm just saying you shouldn't get a hard time I'm not giving him that hard a time I'm just kind of I just putting that in the same category is waiting for Twilight that's that's okay that's I guess tomato all right well what else is on your mind before we let you go Rama earlier in the show about that but the law that California is trying to pass many of the states are jumping on the bandwagon mm-hmm passes is not gonna do a lick of damage I've seen plenty of time at best by people that aren't 17 buying emory games it pops up on the registered check ID they use it to keep entered bypass to keep going yeah but now it's gonna be illegal and those people could be personally responsible if they do that so that behavior might change pretty soon it depends on me I don't think it's going to change unless saying the ruling that at the source quite doing this is going to get fined for it you know what I'm saying let's try this way I bet you can agree with this Rama if a 16 year old wants to get a dirty game that 16 year old will get the dirty game lobby damned right pretty much then there you have it so it's up to the parents to make sure that the 16 year olds don't get the games you don't want them playing Rama I better let you go so we can get some more calls and you can see what's up with your connection problem but thanks so much for your call as always you have a good one take care amiga 777 in our chat rooms asking what's black Luigi that's what we call Rama cuz he's black and he cosplays as Luigi and he always seems to get on camera whenever you know he's at one of these Nintendo events like when he on CNN or something for the Wii event I don't know but he's black Luigi alright let's take some more calls at 1 8 7 7 game olr our username on skype is orange lounge radio she gets some time time to round up some stories Loki yeah well too bad because we got another call coming in I didn't want to see all right then hi you're on orange launch radio who's this this is new Steve misty well how are you we haven't heard from you in a while I'm doing pretty good I was thinking that to run the being in the show where you where you're basically like we've had a shit ton of guests lately yes we haven't but I thought I'd like to confirm one that's gonna be on the show on August 8th who would that be that would be me oh you're coming back huh yep I decided to suck it up and fly oh god it's gonna be a bunch of women here let's I really hope I really hope I really hope that's not the weekend that Nellie has the baby because then Loki won't be here and I'll be surrounded by women no I'm just I'm I'm messing around it'll be okay well that's great are you now I get asked this question because um I don't know if we talked about it last time you were here but you do not like to fly and last time you came out here you took Greyhound out here and a little bit of the train too I think what are you doing this time are you are I thought there was a train involved somehow so what are you doing this time are you doing the but you know pushing the numbers won't do anything right I won't suddenly speak in Spanish for English press one para espanol maki numero dos all right no uh so so what are you doing this time are you doing the the Greyhound thing again what I'm going to get out there is I'm flying Southwest from St. Louis to LA taking Amtrak overnight from LA to Sacramento and then then on the way back home I'm taking the bus well Southwest is basically a Greyhound bus with wings so I enjoy that it'll be fine now have you ever flown before like ever no I'll give you a tip I want to be on the damn show if you're if you're anxious about it Misty and it makes you nervous just take like half a Tylenol PM right before you get on the flight and then you'll fall right asleep and it'll it'll help the anxiety not that I advocate like taking meds and drugs and stuff but you know and again if I don't know like if you I'm not your doctor so you might want to ask somebody because I don't know what other medications you take and I hate to you know have you mix I don't know what else you take and Tylenol may not mix but just take a sleep aid that's approved by your doctor and you know that that might help with the pain or the not the pain but the anxiety because I've had friends that have to do that they get really anxious especially if there's gonna be turbulence or anything which flying to LA you I think you get to dodge the Rockies a little bit I don't think you'll fly right over them and that's where the worst turbulence is but it'll be fine I fly all the time it's fine in fact you know what you probably saw on the news not that far here from Sacramento there's a horrible Greyhound bus accident and I would have been extremely sad if Misty had been on that bus so I think you'll be alright with flying. I didn't read that yet but keep in mind my computer's back I'm limited to doing shit on my iPod right now hmm well you're gonna be you're gonna be just fine with that flight. I do not drink and you know that all right all right I'll let you go so you can go beat up some chatters with your fist so we'll see and you can yell at them in person when you're here in a couple weeks so we'll see you then all right take care. Misty's gonna be on the show. I had to make sure that I was actually gonna be here cuz I was worried for me that she was only here for the weekend what's that say um she's gonna be on the 8th I think that's the night after showgirls it is the night after showgirls so I'll be but I'll be back in town on the 8th because I usually come so I'll be here she's here during the week I guess so we'll have to all get Indian food or something I don't know cuz she foods what are we gonna do with Misty what do you do a Misty for like four days I was thinking going to Dave and Buster's and going to our big old land maybe and let's go order a dumpster the little ghetto arcade over there with Para Para is it'd be fun cuz she really wants to play Para Para be fun let's go to another call hi you're on orange lounge radio for English press one para espanol no I'm kidding hi who's this hey this is excellent hi x-link what's on your mind hey actually I want to call back everything's first off about the law I'm I lived here in Florida which is probably supposedly be one of the states which I really don't think it's gonna pass personally like Rama said I really think that it's gonna go through a lot of loopholes before anything gets passed look through a lot of these different states a lot of the companies too I noticing now are trying to do things so they won't get in trouble it god forbid it's something like this would pass recently I bought something I bought a computer game from Target the file collection and I was surprised that I got ID for it which took me by surprise because the first time ever buying a game from say like Target or someplace like that where I actually got carded for the game for being mature so it was very shocking to say the least but it was very cool though because at least it shows that they're trying to take the appropriate steps to make sure something does happen but you but I agree with you there is a bad point they're making all these steps to block these mature rate games but a lot of times with these are a movies they're not doing anything it's like oh they're worth their parents so it has to be okay so you know but it's like almost like a double standard in a way I'll look at it excellent how do you have time to play Fallout you play just as much Wow as I do and I don't have time for other video games like how do you do it now I got it mostly for the collection now because I have three already so I said well if I got three I might look at one and two and tactics to put in with it because I had one or two before a long time ago before unfortunately my mom's place which had all my games and was arson so I lost a lot of games that I had that's terrible oh man well sorry to hear it but now glad you're it's like building the second frontier I like I can't believe you're sitting there bashing it it was actually it wasn't great it wasn't the best but it would the storyline was alright and besides you can play some like going around game I love how you're lowering the bar as you're reviewing it well wasn't that good when that you know it's you know it's there's always one at every party huh you know it's all good I won't judge you for it all right that it you got something else all right that's pretty much about it all right well thank you as always X link you have a wonderful week always YouTube we'll try to farm Cara tonight okay oh sounds like fun tell the guild bye just bye bye all right that's gonna do it for the skype line tonight thank you guys so much for your phone calls here at orange lounge radio we appreciate it if you didn't get through why don't you leave us a voicemail on the skype line or of course you know I send us an email mailbag at orange lounge reader calm there's Twitter's there's lots of ways to get through to the show so that's it we're gonna wrap up no last-minute stories right now I'm just kidding what is a look you got for last minute stories dead rising to case zero be coming out on Xbox live arcade August 31st of course it'll be kind of a prequel or in-between sequel for the dead rising series it takes place between dead rising a one and two and also you'll be able to kind of level up your character and stuff that you earn in that game will also transfer over to dead rising to the best thing about it though it will only cost you five dollars so that is awesome for what may be considered I've seen anything on arcade for five dollars a long time exactly see Netflix is apparently going diskless by October so they're gonna eventually have an app or you may say that's probably when the exclusivity contract ran out for having the in-dash stuff Rockman 3's got some more tracks announced for it everybody wants to rule the world by tears for fears Rock Lobster by the b-52s awesome foolin by Def Leppard beautiful people by Marilyn Manson hey man nice shot by filter cold as ice by foreigner and then also dance central has three songs announced for drop it like it's hot by Snoop Dogg push it by salt and pepper and bust a move by young MC that's it do you think Rock Lobster might sound something like this wait one sit down I want to sing a little song that kept me going when I had troubles we were at the beach everybody had matching towels somebody went under a dock and there they saw a rock but it wasn't a rock it was a rock lobster that's what's it sound like at my house that's bad back not that all right I'm over it all right well that's gonna do it for last minute stories tonight then let's go around no no bird is the word I'm not going there again but surely you've heard I already put that in as a cage match okay so I almost want to play it but I'm not gonna I promise all right quick let's end the show before I play it we're gonna go around everybody get everybody's final thoughts but not before I thank salacious pop for joining us tonight here in studio hope you had a fun time I did show as always how it now it's because you sometimes you listen and you comment in chat and sometimes you hear how is the show different between the two I don't know behind the scenes is just a different perspective I guess I'm a lot less nervous this time than I was the first two times it's my third time on the show you do well the thing is he's really funny you guys like he makes a lot of really funny chat comments that's why I read him like I'm not doing like he gets more chat comments and because like you know he's my boyfriend or whatever but he actually says a lot of funny stuff and you know so we like getting more of that funny stuff here on the show
