00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Details come out on Mega Man Universe

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
And one retail chain puts user reviews on the shelves

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
We are that video game show dedicated to

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Video games, gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
You name it, you talk about it

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Live in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
My name is Rob Roberts

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
And only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Hi!

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
How are you doing, Jamie?

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Hi

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
You're high?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
No, actually, um

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Starting the Prop 19 celebration a little early?

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
No, no, no

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
I've got Vicodin in me

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
I see

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Because I've got a slice in my hand

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Yes, you had your surgery

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
As we've been talking about for a couple weeks on the show

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Because it was scheduled last week

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
But it happened for real Tuesday, right?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
It did, and it was really boring

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
But you're here, so obviously you're doing alright

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Yeah, it hurts

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
I'm sorry, well Vicodin's supposed to help that

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
No, Vicodin's supposed to make you not care

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Supposed to?

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Supposed to

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Oh, it's going to be a fun show, folks

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Well, I was fun yesterday, though

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
I was really entertaining, I feel

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
I'm going to get into yesterday in just a minute

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
But it would not be a show if I didn't introduce the one and only

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Techmaster, Loke

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
It would be a show, I just wouldn't be introduced

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
How are you doing, Loke?

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
I'm doing fine

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Excellent

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
How's the baby room painting going?

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Because I've seen pictures show up

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
And for the listeners who might be new to OLR

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Who are just tuning in for the first time

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Loke's wife is expecting really soon, right?

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
I think in the next couple weeks

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
August 19th, but she's 35 weeks and 3 days now

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Wow

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
So, you know

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
She looks like she's ready to pop

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
She's basically ready to pop

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
That's right

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
What I'm surprised, to be honest, is our friends

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Annie and Jim

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
I mean, you know, Annie

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
She's 39 and I don't even

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
She'll be 40 weeks next Wednesday

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Or this coming Wednesday

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Wow

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
So she's ready to go

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
That baby's well done

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
That baby is done

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Well, it's her first, right?

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Yes, possibly going to be extra crispy, but

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Well, Becky was 10 days overdue with Julian

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
But yeah, so any day

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Basically, they get to the point, though

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
The doctor will only let you go up to 42 weeks

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
And then they just say, okay, no, you're having the baby

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
We're inducing you and you're going

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
So, no, but Nellie

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
She's hoping to have the baby by the end of the month

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Preferably at 37 weeks

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Which would be a week from this coming Thursday

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
And we don't know what's going to happen to OLR

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
While you're gone

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Knowing you, you'll be here

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Even if she delivers Sunday morning

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
I will probably be gone at least a week or two

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
But it is so funny

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Because, like, there's seriously

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
People like vultures clamoring for your spot

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
While you're gone

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Even that one week

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Drew's been showing up more and more lately

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
We got an email tonight

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
That Jamie's going to read later

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
That has another suggestion

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
So it's really funny

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
It's too bad he's not here this week

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
It really only takes three weeks

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
But unfortunately

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
He was shy one week

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
So that ain't going to work

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Well, we'll figure it out

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
But the point I was actually trying to make

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
For those that didn't know

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
You are doing your baby room in a

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
What? New Super Mario Brothers theme, right?

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Yes, New Super Mario Brothers theme

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
So we've got

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
We've been painting a lot

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
And actually I'm trying to get them uploaded

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
On the photo gallery thing

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
But it's being a little on the slow side

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
There's some pictures right now on there

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
That are really

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
It's a lot of work ago

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I mean, there's a lot of stuff we've done

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Since the stuff I posted

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
And I'd say it's about now

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Maybe

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
I don't know, 60

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
60, 75% done

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
And this is all the base stuff

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
We still have to go back and actually shade it

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
So that it looks more 3D looking I guess

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
But I will probably be posting

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Pictures in the chat room

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
I have uploaded them to Flickr

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
So I'll be posting a link to that

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
In the meantime while we're waiting for them to upload on the website

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Yeah, I know there were some changes on our website this week

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
And I'm going to get into

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
It's mostly transparent

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Except for this apparently

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
The picture thing is slowing down

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Most of the changes that happened to the website this week

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Are transparent

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
But I'll talk about those in a little bit

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
When we get to housekeeping

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
I actually have a lot of housekeeping tonight

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
But first I need to give a plug to

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
All Games

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Because we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
www.allgames.com

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
6 o'clock Pacific

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
9 o'clock Eastern

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Thereabouts right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
We were a little late tonight

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
And that was my bad

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Because I got caught in traffic

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Coming back from San Francisco

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Which actually is going to tie into

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Where we're going to start tonight

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
We usually do start off the show talking about our gaming weeks

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
But Dark Soccer and I kind of had a unique event yesterday in our gaming week

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
We did

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
And I know Jamie wants to talk all about this

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
I do

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
So Dark Soccer

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
California Xtreme

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Tell the listeners who don't know

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Because I find not a lot of people outside of California

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Or NorCal even

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Seem to know what this is

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
So tell our listeners what this is all about

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Where it's at

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Why we go

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
It was Xtreme

05:32.000 --> 05:39.000
California Xtreme is a classic arcade and pinball type of expo thing

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
And they have speakers, do panels, typical convention stuff

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
But all the games are out there on free play

05:46.000 --> 05:52.000
And they've got pins dating back from the 50's and up

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
They even had the Iron Man pinball there

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Which by the way was not very exciting

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Stern sorry you sucked at this one

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
I was way more interested in the Dark Knight table they had a picture of

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
But didn't actually have there

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Yeah that's supposed to be pretty hardcore

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Dude they had Big Bang Bar though

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
I'm glad the people that bring

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
And it was the real Big Bang Bar not the

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
Because they got the rights to redo Big Bang Bar

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
Okay I gotta rewind because you know how disjointed I'm gonna be tonight

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Big Bang Bar was a table they were only like 16 prototypes of

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
That Capcom's pinball division did before they decided to not do that anymore

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
And they eventually did the rights did get out

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
And someone was doing reproductions of them

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
But this was one of the 16 prototypes

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
So it was pretty cool

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
Anyway they had like

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
They had the Star Wars pachinko machine

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
They had old pong

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
They had a game called Touch Me

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
It was very 70's

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
Cocktail tables, sit downs

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
A really nice Star Wars arcade

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
It was kind of like going into Microsoft's game room but for real

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
And journey

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Like if it was a real place

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
They just take this ballroom and just lots of arcade

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
And more pinball than I was expecting

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
I didn't realize how much of it was dominated by pinball

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
They had ultra pin there too

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
The ultra-cade pinball

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
That was a cool machine I played pinbot on that it was cool

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
I've played one of those before like I played Black Knight for a while on there

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
But it's not the same for me

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
I've wanted to make one of those but it really

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
It's cost prohibitive

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
It's really expensive I have an extra TV that I could use for that

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
But it's just I don't play that much pinball

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
And considering how much I play my arcade machine

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
I don't need to build one of these

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
Let me go to our chat room at chat.orangelaungerator.com

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
Because we do get live chat comments as we tape the show

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
And I'm going to start with Salacious Pop tonight

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
He was there with us yesterday

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Salacious Pop in our chat says

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Hi

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
I played a few rounds of Lethal Weapon 3 pinball

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
But try as I might I could not unlock the hidden racist misogynist screen

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
Yes I was hoping they would update the pinball machine

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
So that like when the ball goes down the gutter it would yell at you

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I deserve to be blown

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
But unfortunately no not going to happen

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
Anyhow sorry classic games good times

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Free play

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
You pay one fee to get in it was 40 bucks to get in

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
I got in for nothing

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
I got in as press for Geek Life

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Yours special

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Which by the way there's going to be a big write up on this

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
Showing up tomorrow morning on both Orange Lounge Radio and on Geek Life

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Look at it

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
I had a geeky time while I was there

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
Looking at all the classes like I was playing a real gyrus machine

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
And a real time pilot machine

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
You can't emulate that so well on the 360

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
The tempest kept having problems with the vector

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
The vector display

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Crystal castles with a real trackball the way it was meant to be played

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
The lifeguard trackball forward on the 5200

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
And I played for the first

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
I know this is going to surprise people

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
I don't believe I had ever played the Empire Strikes Back game

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Isn't it great

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Star Wars

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Yes and the Star Wars vector game

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Man that game was epic

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Oh man I love that game

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
The one that they had there the sit down one

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
Had like this really nice bright monitor

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
And the speakers were just so clear

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
It was fantastic it didn't sound muddy or anything at all

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
I thought I got a bad headache playing it and it hurt my hand a lot

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
Because yeah I didn't really play a whole bunch of stuff while I was there

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Because um

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
And we'll probably go into the surgery thing later

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
I've got 8 stitches in my right hand

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Good times

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
And while I'm healing really nicely

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
They hurt a lot

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
Because unlike my last surgery when I moved my hand

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
I've got more range of motion now

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
But it pulls the stitches

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Ew

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
And yeah well it'll bleed a little bit

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
It's really

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
But you were able to play some stuff

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
I played since I played Baby Pac Man

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
I had to play Baby Pac Man

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Me too

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
And that game for being notoriously hard

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
I always remembered being kind of good at it

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
I got to the third stage which is not bad for Baby Pac Man

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
They had a Junior Pac Man

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Which is like one of the really epic Pac Mans of its day

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
Of course I played Big Bang Bar

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
And Iron Man Pinball

10:07.000 --> 10:13.000
I didn't play Journey

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
I played Star Wars

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
I played Journey it was awesome

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I played Timber twice

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Because I love those old school

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
I played Mouse Trap

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
And then Mouse Trap though was the big mistake

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
Because Mouse Trap has a right hand joystick

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
And I was like

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
And I forgot about the stupid bird

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Because keep in mind when I was playing a lot of Mouse Trap

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
I was playing it on the ColecoVision

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
And there's no bird in the ColecoVision

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
You know what else was there that was very random

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
That was cool was a 80s or I guess maybe mid 90s laser disc jukebox

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
So the whole time people are there playing games

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
There's these old school songs playing

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Everything from like you know

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
Contemporary-ish songs by like Garbage of You Two

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
To like pour some sugar on me

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
On the little four cube TV

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Yeah it's there every year

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
One of those TVs that's made up of little TVs

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
It was awesome

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Yeah totally 80s style

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
But there's more Rob

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
There's more

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
What?

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Coin Toss was there

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
I love the Coin Toss game

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
It's like one of the old 50s games

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
It was so fantastic

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
Like one of the pre-course precursors to our pong

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
But anyway

11:15.000 --> 11:21.000
There was the Boxcar game

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
The Sega Boxcar game

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Oh yeah the Minecar

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Like you actually push up and down on the big lever

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Like an old Minecar

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
And Top Skater

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
And DDR something or the other

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Extreme

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
I took some video of Mel and Ali playing

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I actually got up there and played DDR

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
I'm not allowed to

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Man am I out of shape

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I'm not allowed to play DDR until my stitches come out

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
No

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
I can't get my heart rate

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
I miss much

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
I'm not supposed to get my heart rate up y'all

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
So I can't get very excited tonight

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Um

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
Looking at our chatroom at chat.orangesonsradio.com

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Sure

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
I always say this name wrong

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Surezo in our chatroom says

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Sounds like a nice spot

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
Damn I need to plan to get out to California Extreme

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Now I think he's kind of local here

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
I think he's our guy

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
It was in Santa Clara

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
That golfs or does the Roseville Golf Line and everything

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
But I

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Would this be something worth traveling to

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Like a long distance

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Totally

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Totally

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Yeah we were people there from out of country

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
I think they could

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
I mean here's the weird thing

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
It's an arcade trade show

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
So I get that they don't want to like expand on

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Probably that core part of it

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
But you know what would have made that expo even more awesome

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Would have been like a classic gaming room

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
With like console stuff

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
That reminds me

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
And I know that might be outside the scope of what they're trying to do but

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Classic Gaming Expo is coming back

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Oh yeah

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
In Las Vegas

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
We need to make plans

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
This was different from Classic Gaming Expo though

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
I can't really explain

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Classic Gaming Expo was its own kind of thing

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Yeah

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
Classic Gaming Expo was more like booths and things set up to remember

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
But this was just straight up a room full of free play games

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
I love the story though about

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
Because Dan's little brother Mason came with us

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
And there was

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
They were at this panel and Mason's like who's that

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
What did that guy do, make Atari?

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
And Dan's like why yes he actually did

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
And it was the

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Nice

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
But I got to meet Steve Ritchie

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
Who designed at least a couple of the tables that we have in this house

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
No Fear

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
He did the voices for No Fear

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
So when I was

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
When I gave him some of our plastics to sign

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
And he started doing the voices from No Fear

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
And I was just

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
So cool and I talked to his wife

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
She was a really sweet lady

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
And told her about a pinball table that I'm designing

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
Because I'm actually designing the art and everything

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
And the layout for a pinball table

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
I just need someone who can program it

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Vidpower in our chat room says

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
California Extreme was in the Donkey Kong documentary King of Kong

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
I don't remember that

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Was that the place they go

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
I thought that was a place on the East Coast

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
But they go, it's like an expositions going on

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
And Billy, not Billy, the other guy

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
Steve tries to top the score at this expo

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
But he just barely misses it

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
He doesn't do it

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
Well no he did this at conventions since I thought

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Yeah I don't know

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
But anyway

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
No Steve Wiebe's been I think at these conventions

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
And all those types of guys you see in that documentary

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Are here at this type of event

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Good times

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Anyway though

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
And then there were vendors for pinball parts

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
And you know

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
A stern marketer was there

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
The guy who brought the Iron Man table

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
And the guy that plays the 12 string guitar thing

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Was there

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Because he's there every year

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
And he's always really cool

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
I just had this

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
I googled myself and I walked

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
I was walking sort of

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Catty corner around

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
And all of a sudden in the distance I hear

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Bong, bong, bong, bong

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
The Space Invaders thing

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
And then there's also one of our listeners there

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
Really cool guy, Carlson

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Really cool guy

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
And I purchased a game for my husband

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
Got Gunstar Heroes for the Game Gear

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
I was kind of surprised

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Treasure

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
I was surprised to see him there

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Because the last time I had seen him

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Was out in Washington D.C.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
And he's based in the East Coast

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
He's mostly the cons out there

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
But I guess he has a relative that lives out here

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
So he was at this con

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Very random moment

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Because I was actually looking at the shirts

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
At his booth

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
And he has this really funny

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
And I guess this is his own original design

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
It says like Shaq Fu

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
I loved that

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
And I almost

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
I was thinking about buying it

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
But then I got distracted

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Because he's like

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Hey Rob

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
And I was like

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Oh wow

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
I remember you from like four years ago

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
So this is kind of funny

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Like running into people

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
He recognized me

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
And I didn't know who he was

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Or anything

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Well it was funny

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
I was looking for you

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
To go introduce you to him

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
When you just found him on your own

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
I had Melody and I did

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Oh good times

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
I had a quick bundle

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
You just cut out suddenly

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Did your switch go down?

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Uh no

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
I don't have a switch

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Oh weird

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
I don't know what happened

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Well meh

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Tonight is going to be a night of technical fun

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
The soundboard's on Vicodin

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Alright well before we get to

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
The rest of our gaming weeks

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Outside of

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Oh boy

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Outside of just this convention

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Is there anything else you want to say about California Extreme?

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
Maybe the thing you most want to see them do next year?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Do it exactly like they did it

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
And make it cheaper

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
And bigger

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
And bigger

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Oh yeah

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Bring back the Kung Fu game

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
What game was it there at Kung Fu Master?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
It wasn't there

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
And and and

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Damn it

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Somebody bring a theater of magic

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Because Melody and I were annoyed

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Alright

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Well uh DarkSakura

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
I know you had the surgery

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
I don't know if you've been playing a lot of video games

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
But outside the expo

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Did you play any video games this week?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
How was your gaming week?

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
I'm playing Sims right now

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Um

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
I was playing some Sims

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Um

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
I tried to play Star Trek Online

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
But it hurt too much

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
So I just went on to let my fleetmates know

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
That I wasn't dead of gangrene of the hand

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Um

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Um

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
Damn beat Crackdown finally

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
It was anticlimactic

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
First one or the new one?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Second one

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Oh wow

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
It was anticlimactic

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Um

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
And I also really hate the guy in that game

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
He's like

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Are you trying to piss me off?

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Go back to the tactical location

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
I just wanted to tell him

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Shut up and bite my butt

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
You sound like you've got

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
A wedgie

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Um

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
And um

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
I know I played something else

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
I don't remember

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
You're too high to remember

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
No, no

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Um

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Are you playing the Sims right now?

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
I said I was playing the Sims

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Oh um

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I played a little bit of Portal

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
A little bit of Portal

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Just a little bit?

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Just a little bit

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
It's just like

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Just enough to get taunted by GLaDOS?

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Yeah

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
It was just like

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
I'm getting so bored

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Not being able to do much of anything

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
That I'll sit and start to play something

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Like with the Sims at least

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
You know I can do a little bit

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
And rest my hand

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
But if I get in the middle of a battle

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
On Star Trek Online

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
I'm there until it's done

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Cause you can't actually pause it

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Unless you're on a

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Away mission

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Yeah, MMOs don't usually have a pause button

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Yeah

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
And the only ones of those you can pause

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Are the ones you're on there by yourself

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
So

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Alright

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Yeah, and it's only 45 seconds, meh

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Uh, let's try Loki

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
How was your gaming week, Loki?

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
I didn't play a whole lot cause I was paying

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
So really the only stuff I played was at work

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Gloria Paint!

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Literally!

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
That's true

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
That is true

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Um

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
No, the only things that I played this week

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Was, um, actually Grand Theft Auto

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
But, um, kind of funny

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
We didn't really play much of the

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Battle of the Gay Tony this week

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Apparently my co-workers are tired of me

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Kicking the crap out of them at

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
The Battle of the Gay Tony

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
So they went back to Lost in Dam

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
So I had to keep the crap out of them

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
In Lost in Dam

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Um, but it's fun

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
It's a nice little break

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
I just

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
I always forgot how slow the characters run

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
And oh my god they run so damn slow

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
In that game

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
It's ridiculous

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
And

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
I don't know if they've

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
You know, remembered it being

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
It's not quite as exciting as I remembered it

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Just because when we played it last

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
It was

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
With all sorts of crazy explosions going off

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
On our mod games

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Which will hopefully come back soon

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Once I'm done painting the baby's room

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Um

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
But yeah, we've been playing lots of that

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
And that's pretty fun

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
And then

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Uh, Crackdown 2

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Played a little bit of that

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
The only thing I don't like about Crackdown 2

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Well

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
There's many things I don't like about Crackdown 2

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
One of the new things I don't like about Crackdown 2

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Was

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Um

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Our internet at my work is not the greatest

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Because we're sharing it with like

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
80 computers

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
I mean it's ridiculous

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
But

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Usually it's enough to play

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Online games

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Not a problem

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
Um

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Every now and then we have connection issues

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
With trying to get into like say a

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Free mode game or something like that

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
And Grand Theft Auto

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
But

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
You know, minor stuff that we can usually get around

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Crackdown 2 will not allow me to play a game

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
With anybody else

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
At my work

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Like if my co-workers say I want to play a game with him

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
It's impossible

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
I can join another person's game

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Away from our work

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
But it will not allow me to connect to a person that's

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Literally next to me

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Is that maybe because the game is seeing you guys

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Like in the same room

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
No

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
It's not

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
The reason is

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
It's saying that our um

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Connection is too strict or

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
It's basically layman's terms for

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Um

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Our internet connection is too slow

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
I do just want to point out though

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Loki you do know most people

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Don't get to play Xbox at their jobs

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Right

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Just throwing that out there

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
I understand that but you know

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
I'm just saying during our break

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
We wanted to play some co-op Crackdown 2

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Which would have been really fun

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
But uh

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
We can't do that and say we have to play

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Lost and Damned

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Um

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
But I just wish that they

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
First off I wish they just had System Link

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Back from the first game

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
That would solve all the problems right there

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Well most of the problems

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Cause

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Even Red Dead Redemption

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
And

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
It was

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
You know it was a good testament to how

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Take Two

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
And Rockstar Games

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Still find ways to fuck up multiplayer

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Um

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Even in Red Dead Redemption

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
It sometimes can't find

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
The other people

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Like we'll be

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
And that was funny

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
We're playing Free Mode in Red Dead Redemption

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
And we go to try to play like a little

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Deathmatch in there cause in

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
In the online for Red Dead

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
You have to basically go these different points

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
On the map and then it'll send an invite

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
To the other players that are playing

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
You know the System Link game with you

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Um

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
That you want to do a

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Deathmatch

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
So we all

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
You know say okay yes

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Let's enter this Deathmatch

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
And then it puts us in the three separate

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Deathmatches

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
With just us

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Our one single

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
You know each person is in their own

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Deathmatch

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
How the fuck does that happen

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
I have never seen

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
A System Link game

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Not figure out how to connect to another

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
System Link

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Console

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
It doesn't make any sense

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Only Rockstar could do that

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
But yeah

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
So um

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
That's about all I played this week

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Hopefully gonna play more once we get the

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Babies room done cause

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
You know we're under a deadline here

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
And uh

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
You know I have lots

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
I have

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
You know

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
A little bit of work left to do

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
But um

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
It's looking good

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Alright well good luck

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
With the rest of that

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
And uh

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Our well wishes to the

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Misses as well

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
And uh

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Through all that

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
My gaming week

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Outside of California Extreme

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
I've been playing

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Um

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Mostly the same stuff

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
I didn't get into a lot of new stuff

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
I would say the newest thing I played

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Was some of the extensions

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
That they have in game room now

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
You know some of the recent games

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
That they released

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
But of course that's just really

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Old stuff

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
With new paint on it

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Uh

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
And

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
I can't tell you how

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Horrifically

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Games like

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
Kaboom

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
And Crystal Castles

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
And things that ran on the Xbox

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Or I mean things that ran on like

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Trackballs and

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
And uh

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Paddles

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
How horrifically they translate

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Into the Xbox 360 controls

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
But there are some other cool

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Stuff on there

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
That I was playing

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Um

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Like Hero

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
H-E-R-O

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Was still one of my favorite games

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Uh

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
They did some changes to game room

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
This week too

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Where now you have like a

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Live leaderboard

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
As you are playing the game

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
You watch yourself climb up

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
This live leaderboard

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
On the right hand side of the screen

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
That's actually really cool

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
So um

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
I kinda

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Was a fan of that

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
That's only a ranked match

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
By the way

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
So you have to actually own the game

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
To be able to see that

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
But um

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Yeah

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Uh

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Still more Puzzle Quest 2

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Still more Warcraft of course

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
I revisited

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Revisited

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Uh

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
The pinball games

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
That are on

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Xbox 360

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
And Playstation 3

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
Zen Pinball

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
And Pinball FX

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Uh

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Because I was trying to uh

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Represent OLR

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
In the big battle

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Cause

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
The response from the listenership

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
So far has been a little bit tepid

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
But I'll get into that in a little bit

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Um

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
So I was trying to help represent

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
OLR in that

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
And I tried

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
I didn't get at the top of leaderboard

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
But at least I

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
I got on it

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
So I'm happy with that

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
And

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
I hadn't really played

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Especially the one on the PS3

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
I don't think I appreciated enough

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
But that Earth Defense Force table

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
On PS3

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Is actually a lot of fun

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
And uh

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
I actually kind of enjoyed

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Um

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Getting to spend a little time with it

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
This week

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
As much as I was not

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
As wonderful at it

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
I'd be more excited about it

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
If it was actually

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Earth Defense Force 2017

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
It is not

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
But it's

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
It's still cool

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
It's a cool little board

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
As far as pinball goes

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
But uh

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Yeah had a good time with that

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
So that was

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
That was really it

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
There wasn't um

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
A whole lot of other

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Stuff

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
In my gaming week

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
And I pretty much

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Echo a lot of what

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Dark Sakura said

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
With uh

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
California Extreme

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Uh

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Played a lot of fun games there

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
So uh

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Since I brought up

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
The Big Battle

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Let's go into housekeeping here tonight

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Before we get into tonight's gaming news

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Uh

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Big Battle is

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Is all games

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Um

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Kind of competition

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
With these various video games

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Uh

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Throughout all the different shows

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
On all games

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Well

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Most of them

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
I don't think all of them

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Signed up

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Of quite a few

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Are participating

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
In RPG Grinders

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Electric Sisterhood

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
All these other shows

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
On the network

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Sorry I didn't name them all

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
But they're all there

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Uh

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
At thebigbattle.net

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
And um

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
It's really just for fun

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
It's not

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Although I hear now

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
There's a prize

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
I got an email this week

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
That now there is a prize

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
So get this

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
The winning show

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
And this is not about the hosts

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Of the show doing battle

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
With each other

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Although I'm choosing to participate

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
This is about the listenerships

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Representing the shows

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
In these battles

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Well

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
The winning show now

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
As I understand it

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Is going to get

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
A gold Atari 2600

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
So it's a

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Like I think it's just

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Spray painted gold

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
But it will be an

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Atari trophy

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
So I know Dark Soccer's

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Dying to have one of those

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
In the vault

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
Although

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
I do think

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
If we get a gold Atari 2600

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
We should maybe

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
I don't know

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Give it to a listener

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
That helped us get it

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Maybe?

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
I don't know

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Go for it

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
We'll have to decide

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Rob if I really wanted

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
A gold Atari 2600

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
I would go find one of ours

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
And get a can of

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Rustoleum

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
And the meaning behind it

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
It doesn't mean it the same

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
When you do it that way

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
I know

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
But I'm just saying

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
We can give it to somebody

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
It will be just fine

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Well I'll tell you right now

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
The way the leaderboards look

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
We ain't gonna get it

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
We are in second place

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
But we're gonna win

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
A gold 32X

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
But we are way behind

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Dead Pixel Live

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Dead Pixel Live has 164 points

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
We have 42

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Which has us in second place

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Now how many things

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Have already completed already?

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
Uh

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
I think three

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
But there's still more

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Going on right now

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
But let me

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
You know

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
It got off to a little

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
Bit of a slow start

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
The whole thing started

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Right when E3 was going on

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
And then you know

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
My birthday and the 4th

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Were all in there

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
You know

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
It took a little while

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
I think for us to

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Kind of really get in there

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
But there's more games

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Happening

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
And I think a lot of the

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
Early feedback we got was

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
You know

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
I don't have Solnarex

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
And I don't really have

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
The pinball game

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
So what's there for me to play?

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Derek's been very open to

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Putting stuff in there

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
So I can tell you

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
And it looks like

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
It's scheduled now

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
I didn't even know

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
It got a date

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
On August 1st

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Super Street Fighter 4

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Now I know tons of bitches

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Have that game

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
I'll make Dan play

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
And can represent

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Get Dan to sign up

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
At TheBigBattle.net

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
And represent the OLR

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
Because seriously

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
If we lose

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Super Street Fighter 4

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Or we don't have

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Good representation

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Super Street Fighter 4

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
We're just going to kiss

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
That gold Atari thing goodbye

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Because it ain't happening

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Like this is a game

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
That I know we can do

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Well at

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
I'll blame everybody personally

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
So yes

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
I will be

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Blaming certain individuals

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
That are very very good

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
At Super Street Fighter

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
If you don't participate in this

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Unless you have a really good reason

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
I will blame you personally

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
But it's yeah

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
TheBigBattle.net

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
And it's August 1st

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
And sign up and participate

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
But there are other games

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
If you're not a Street Fighter person

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Forza's going on right now

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
And I wonder if we have people

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
In Forza

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Like I'll tell you this

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
So far

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
We can really thank

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Arkadian42

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Really made a good showing

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
For us in pinball

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
Like he got us 7 points

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
On Zen Pinball

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
And he got us

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Another 7 points

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
On Pinball FX

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
I got us like 4 on one

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
And 3 on the other

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
And let's see

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
We actually have Monty Boggs

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Participated

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
And got us 3 points

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
On Pinball FX

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
So thank you

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
Arkadian42

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
Monty Boggs

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
And me

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
The rest of you all

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
You need to go find a game

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
You can help us out with

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
I'm injured

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
Alright

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
Fine

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
You can sit on the bench

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
Due to injury

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
But depending on how long

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
This thing goes

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Up B or a win done

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Look at this

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Look at this

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
3 points

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
On Forza Motorsport 3

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Right now

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Way to go

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
Brrr

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
You rock

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Keep up the good work

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
And there's also

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Super Stardust HD

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Is the other competition

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
Going on right now

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
And I

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Oh

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
We

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Holy crap

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
We are leading

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
The leaderboard right now

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
In Super Stardust HD

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Who is Zui?

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Who is a Z-O-O-I?

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
I don't recognize

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
That name from chat

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
I don't know who Zui is

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
But

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
That's from us to you

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
Cause you're currently

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Kicking butt

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
Brrr

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Brrr

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
That's from us to HD

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
Good job

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
And Battlefield

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
Bad Company 2

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Is also happening

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
So there it

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
Big Battle

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
In chat

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
DarkTetsuya

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Says

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
I thought

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
I heard a rumor

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
There going to

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
It an upcoming

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
I heard

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
meaning

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
That

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
In the

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
There ya go

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
Other housekeeping I wanted to get to tonight.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
I want to talk about the feed.

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
Most people shouldn't notice this, but the podcast feed actually moved

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
this past week and I want to take a minute to thank

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
Dekeman and Jason, VX JasonXV,

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
who do a lot of work on our website. And I'll tell you, like, Dekeman,

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
he kind of did this whole thing where he moved our podcast

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
and he's doing it so that way when we, usually when I post

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
a show, it takes like 24 hours for it to show up on the website

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
because someone has to go in there manually and do it, but that won't

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
happen anymore. Like, when I post a show, it will be instant.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
So, most people are going to be able to get their shows faster and that's going to be

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
really good news. So,

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
yeah, I'm hoping nobody notices

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
the differences, but if you do,

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
just sit tight while we are under construction

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
a little bit. But I'm hoping if you're listening to this show

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
and you're on the podcast feed, then clearly your

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
feed player and all that updated and noticed the change

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
just fine. You don't need to do a darn thing. And for those

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
that did not move, Jason was kind enough to

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
record like a little special message that will show up over there

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
for those folks that know they have to resubscribe. So, I'm hoping

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
that is all better and all that good stuff now.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
So, that's just some maintenance going on on the website. And also,

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
an excuse for me to thank the guys that make it happen, Dekeman

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
and VX JasonXV. Like, Dekeman put together this whole little, like, training manual.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
Like, here's how you post to the website. Step one, dah dah dah.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
It's like the type of thing I do at my day job. And we pay him

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
nothing because we have nothing. So,

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
it's very much appreciated by all of

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
us, as all of you listening should appreciate it too.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
How about some actual bonafide gaming news now?

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
Are we ready? Thirty minutes into the show, we're going to touch on some gaming news.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
Loki, what is going on in the world of PlayStation?

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
Absolutely nothing. No, just kidding.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
Actually, in September, there will be some stuff going on,

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
including the 3D Blu-ray support,

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
which will basically turn your PS3 into not only

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
a Blu-ray player, but a 3D Blu-ray player.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
And as of right now, I believe there is only one

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
3D Blu-ray movie out there. So, if you're looking

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
to see Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs in 3D,

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
you can do that now. Assuming, of course, that you have a 3D TV.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
But why wouldn't you have a 3D TV if you have

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
that movie?

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
And then, of course, with that, there's also going to be some...

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
Wait, wait, isn't the regular Blu-ray just happen to be

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
regular and 3D? I don't think you buy a special

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
3D Blu-ray. So you could own the movie

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
and just not have a 3D TV because they're kind of pricey right now, right?

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
No, I do believe that it's actually a different movie.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
It's a 3D Blu-ray. Wow. Wow, I didn't even know that existed.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
The regular movie, you can watch with the

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
glasses, the magenta,

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
cyan, or the red-blue stuff.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
But, no, this actually requires

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
a special... You have to buy your movies all over again, yes.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
Just in case you thought, you know, Blu-ray

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
was enough. If you want them in 3D, you gotta buy them again.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
Oh, great. Because it's, you know,

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
Mark Smith of that way. Also, there's gonna be

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
some additional support for, apparently,

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
Play TV in Europe is gonna

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
be in 3D as well. Different broadcasts through that,

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
as well as YouTube supporting 3D content

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
over the next 12 months as well. So there'll be

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
3D YouTube stuff. Which...

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
begs the question, and this is my

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
thing. Why?

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
That'd be the second question. Why? The first question is,

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
I understand, okay, YouTube, okay, great, we've got

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
3D YouTube, but...

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
as far as I'm aware, there's not really 3D film camera. Like,

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
I can't go out there and buy a camera that shoots

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
in 3D. Yet. Well, YouTube

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
isn't just underground stuff right now, you know?

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
Like, there's a lot of big studios who use YouTube to push

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
their stuff. I understand that, but, you know,

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
I'm not gonna be able to see, you know,

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
some viral video or something like that,

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
you know, in 3D normally. And...

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
why? Like you said,

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
why bother? It's because...

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
This 3D thing is happening too fast for me. But you know

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
why that they're pushing it? Why? It's because Sony is

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
selling 3D TVs. And Sony

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
has movies, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
that happen to be in 3D Blu-ray. They figure,

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
hey, look! Look what we did for Blu-ray already!

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
We beat HD DVDs! Now we can convince

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
people to buy 3D Blu-ray! So they're kinda like riding on a high

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
right now, like they own everything? They're basically thinking, you know what,

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
yeah, we may have fucked up UMD,

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
but hey, we won in Blu-ray, and now we're gonna try our

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
hands at 3D Blu-ray. It'll print money!

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
But I have the... Here's my thing though, is people,

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
some people, not even all

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
people nowadays, are willing to make the jump to Blu-ray

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
because the picture quality is pretty good

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
compared to the DVD. But

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
those people probably just bought HDTVs.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
Those same people are not gonna go, oh, well

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
I need to throw away my HDTV, I just bought and buy

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
a really expensive 3D HDTV with

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
really expensive 3D glasses to go with that. Because

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
I'm a consumer whore. Most people will not

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
do that. And so, yes, it is a bit

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
early. It's why you're not seeing, you know, Microsoft jumping

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
on the bandwagon with this stuff, because it's way too damn early.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
You don't need to be putting out 3D games because

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
most people don't have the hardware to play them.

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
Going to chat.thatorangehonestready.com and some comments there, TigerClaw

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
says, if the studios have their way, they will release the regular

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
Blu-ray version, then a couple months later, the 3D version.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
The 3D version of Avatar won't be out until 2011, and right now

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
they're planning on re-releasing the movie back in IMAX theaters

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
as a special edition with eight minutes of extra footage.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
Because, you know, it is THE 3D movie.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
But here's the funny part about that. The whole reason they are

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
doing a lot of 3D in theaters now is to get people back into

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
the movie theaters to watch these 3D movies. If you have the

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
technology at home, thank you, you know, Sony and

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
all these guys, you're basically just shooting the

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
theaters all over again, because now what are they going to do? Well,

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
I'm not going to the theater to watch an expensive Blu-ray, you know, 3D movie.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
I can watch those 3D movies at home. And how many people remember this

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
particular parallel happening in the video gaming industry?

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
When, basically, you could get a Dreamcast, which

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
basically ran things like a NAOMI system back

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
in the day. It's just a matter of

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
consumer technology bypassing the mass

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
technology. What comes down to is, really,

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
Sony doesn't give a crap about movie theaters, because

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
they don't own movie theaters. They sell movies to these

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
movie theaters, and they could care less if their technology

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
is going to impede on their business.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Can I just say this real quick, because I think Dark

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
Soccer makes a good point, is that I think things like the

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
3DO and the CDI come to mind, those

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
things kind of, to me, feel like they were a little ahead of their time.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
And the technology was really cool,

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
but the games were kind of crap and too much money.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
You know what I mean?

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
I think a lot of that stuff was really ahead of

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
its time. I think all this stuff is a little too

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
soon as well. We've got other people in chat saying,

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
Katsune in our chat room, yeah, I just got my HDTV,

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
I'm not going to get a 3D TV anytime soon. Probably never.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
And Miyamoto also thinks the 3D thing is happening too soon.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
But see, the 3DS, I'm a lot cooler with

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
that, because, let me tell you the best thing about the 3DS.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
There's a little lever on the right side, and when you get sick of 3D, you just

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
turn it down, it goes off. Ta-da!

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
The difference between the 3DS and the

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
PlayStation 3, the PlayStation 3 to see 3D,

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
it requires you to buy a bunch of additional hardware.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
Glasses that are really expensive.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
The TV that's really expensive.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
The 3DS, you turn it on.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
And you see 3D. And if you don't want to see 3D, you turn

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
the little slider down. And the great thing about that too

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
is if games, say for example, don't want to use 3D,

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
but they want to have a really high resolution, well

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
not really high resolution, but a pretty high resolution screen,

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
they could do that because now the amount of pixels

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
that are on the second screen are nearly doubled, and it's widescreen.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
So you could do pseudo HD type stuff on there

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
if you want to.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
And at the same time, I guess, Sony

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
on their games, they're also limiting the use of

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
1080p 3D in PlayStation 3 games.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
Apparently, Sony's official guidelines

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
for 3D gaming on the PS3 limit

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
the displayed image to a resolution of 720p.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
Even games that run natively at

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
1080p, like Super Stardust HD, are

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
downscaled to 3D mode to two 720p

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
images, one for each eye.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
And I'm guessing this is because

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
the PS3 probably just can't handle that amount

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
of data going through there.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
It says it will support 3D Blu-ray movies at that

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
resolution, 1080p,

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
later this year, but

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
upping the resolution

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
to

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
1080p also expenses the

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
60 frames per second. So for example,

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
Blu-ray movies run at

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
4 frames per second.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
I don't know.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
It's interesting. Honestly, with resolution

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
and stuff like that, I don't really think it matters. I mean, if you're looking at

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
high def in 3D, it's not gonna matter. It's gonna look cool.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
Whether it's 1080p or 720p.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
I mean, when you have the glasses on, you don't really give a shit. You're like,

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
oh damn, this is just horrible in this 720p.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
What am I, like, a peasant here?

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
This is ridiculous.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
It's not enough pay for me. I need my pay.

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
So,

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
one thing though,

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
kind of going back to this, that I had to laugh about,

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
and this isn't even really the 3D stuff, but it just

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
kind of stuck out to me in my mind during the Sony

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
press conference, because it made no sense to me as far as

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
as an actual feature that you would advertise to your

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
customers. One of the things that they said regarding the PlayStation

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
Move is like, because

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
you can only do this on the Sony PlayStation 3,

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
because we use Blu-ray technology, Blu-ray technology

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
will allow us to put both the

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
regular version of the game and the Move version of the game

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
on the same disc. And that was

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
a feature that they threw out there. And I'm like,

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
I've never seen people

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
not able to put, you know, two different control schemes

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
on one disc before because of disc space. Oh my god,

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
we can't fit. Why would you even put a separate

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
copy of the game on the disc? That's a little redundant if you ask me.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
I'm trying to think. I think you could go back like

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
15 years to the Super Nintendo

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
and a game called King Arthur something

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
that had the mouse. It was one of the few third-party games that supported the mouse.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
But you know what, you could also use a controller. Oh my god,

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
two different control schemes on one cartridge.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
The only game, or only games

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
I guess that I would say that had two different control schemes,

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
and because they were, you know, released later on,

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
would be those new play control games because they had the Wii remote.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
But that was added later and that does not count. I mean, that is not

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
something that they released. That was the equivalent of re-releasing

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
the same movie on Blu-ray 3D. Yeah, exactly.

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
And I'm sorry, but

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
nobody is making that argument, oh well, you know,

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
you're gonna have to buy a separate version of Halo 4,

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
the Kinect version, because we just can't fit it on those

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
pesky DVDs. We have to create a whole other game.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
That's just stupid.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
Going to another little side conversation in our chatroom,

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
SSJ100Matt is saying, do we really need 3D?

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
And some of the response is, no, no, no. It's a stupid gimmick.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
Well, and then the other thing if you want to

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
know, 3D is obviously taking away some sort of processing

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
power from, you know, your games.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
So, they're gonna have to make the games

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
slightly less, you know, elaborate

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
in order to, you know, allow you to do this 3D stuff.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
Now granted, they're gonna have 3D in like Killzone 3 and I'm sure

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
that's gonna look amazing, but, I mean,

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
is that gonna really affect the performance of the game?

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
Is what I want to know because they're not adding any additional

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
hardware to, you know, run this 3D stuff. It's just basically

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
data going through them and if they're having to process twice as much data,

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
one for each eye, then you gotta

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
think that that's got a bottleneck somewhere.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
I just don't think I've ever really experienced 3D

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
where it was like, oh my god, blow my hair back, amazing, like,

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
this is just, like when I went and saw Avatar in 3D,

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
I was like, okay, this is cool, but I probably would've

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
liked the movie just the same in 2D. I wasn't like,

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
oh my god, 3D was just everything,

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
I was moved to tears, it was better than having my dick sucked,

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
it was amazing, ah, you know, it just wasn't

42:13.000 --> 42:16.000
that great, you know?

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
3D was not necessary. I thought it was, I thought it

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
actually added a very good dimension to the movie, but that was, you know,

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
It was neat, but it, wait, you wouldn't have felt the same way about the movie

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
in 2D? I probably would've liked it, but if I had seen them

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
both side by side, my preference would go to the 3D.

42:31.000 --> 42:34.000
It's just, if it's gonna cost this much money to upgrade

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
right now too, like, it has to be, like, truly, truly amazing.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
Well, it's not cost effective right now. I mean, it's

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
by no means cost effective. And just wait anyways, because

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
it's only a matter of, like, years before holograms, and then you're gonna have to buy

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
your hologram TV, and one step closer to the holodeck,

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
as we always say, that's gaming's ultimate goal, is the holodeck

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
from Star Trek The Next Generation. Everything

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
is just one step closer to the holodeck.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
I have a holodeck in my backyard. Frisbee says, question,

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
all games suggest that you take a 15 minute break after one hour

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
of playing. How many people will hurt their eyes with this 3D stuff?

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
I'm kinda curious what the safety manual and

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
disclaimers are gonna look like on the 3DS. I'm very curious about that.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
Don't play for more than 5 seconds. Well, here's

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
the best part about the 3DS. If it starts bugging your eyes,

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
there's a little slider to turn the 3D off.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
Oh my god. And that's awesome. One

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
of the comments I wanted to read, S.J. 100 Matt in our chatroom said,

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
give it five years, maybe there will be enough support for it. Right now, there's

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
nothing worthwhile. It's all James Cameron's fault.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
Maybe that stupid rant he had in E3 2009 actually meant

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
something. I don't remember that rant, but apparently he got up on stage

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
and talked kind of about, you know, the 3D stuff.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
Just, we weren't ready for it. We're not ready to handle it.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
Although it's kinda- You can't handle that extra D.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
You can't handle the truth. But look at, okay, look at 3D

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
and what it's done so far to cinema. I mean,

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
we're getting a lot of gimmicky movies. And they-

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
We got a lot of gimmicky movies back when, you know,

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
the red-blue-glass 3D was really popular.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
Just a lot of, like,

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
you know, Final Destination in 3D.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
Oh, look at the head flew towards me. You know, Saw

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
in 3D. Oh, look at the head flying towards me.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
You know, it's Jaws in 3D.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
Oh, look at the head flying towards me. I mean, it's just, it's basically

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
the same stuff over and over. And a lot of these movies

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
that don't necessarily need 3D, like Clash of the Titans,

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
have the 3D tacked onto it and it looks like shit.

44:31.000 --> 44:34.000
So, you know, take that, you know, and add that

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
to, like, say, games, and now you're gonna get 3D games that look like shit.

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
It just occurred to me, I thought of something

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
that was Blow My Hair Back Amazing

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
3D experience, that 3D was

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
intricate and necessary to the presentation that would not have been the same

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
without it. Captain EO.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
I was thinking the same thing. Well, and remember that seventh

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
portal thing, the Marvel thing at Great America?

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
Those rides that are like that.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
The Muppet Show. Captain EO, really.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
Captain EO was first, and Captain EO was, what, 1985?

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
86? Yeah.

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
When Captain EO comes out

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
on these 3D TVs, wake me up.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
Then maybe I'm ready for 3D TVs.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
In the meantime, let's move on to something else that's

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
completely unnecessary. Yeah, I know they did a Captain EO game.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
That's what the Michael Jackson game should be.

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
None of this, like, imitates his dance moves. I don't give a shit about that.

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
Yeah, just build that stuff in a dance. Captain EO and

45:34.000 --> 45:37.000
Michael Jackson Moonwalker 2. Amazing.

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
Moonwalker HD.

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
SSJ-100 Matt says your other answer is Lawnmower Man.

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
Remember when Virtual Reality was like the big

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
Virtual Reality.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
They tried. And stock footage of all the Mind's Eye stuff.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
Ooh, that was really cool.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
Yeah, I remember back in the day when Virtual Reality stuff was

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
really big. God, we were stupid back then.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
Alright, speaking of things that are completely

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
useless and unnecessary, Real ID.

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
I had to do that. That's a fantastic tie-in, Rob.

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
I'm very proud of you. 3 weeks in a row I'm talking about this.

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
And look, again, I'm going to say this. I know a lot of you could give two shits

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
about World of Warcraft, but this is important because where Blizzard

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
goes, other companies will inevitably follow.

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
I'm going to keep it brief this week. There's two quick things that happen to Real ID

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
that are newsworthy and necessary to cover.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
First off, this is kind of one of those, like,

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
part of it's really funny and the other part is

46:37.000 --> 46:40.000
actually not funny at all. And that is that, you know,

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
a bunch of people when this Real ID, and going back to when they

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
Blizzard was saying, oh, we're going to post

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
your real name to the forum whenever you want to make a

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
post, right? Remember that whole thing they had to retract last week?

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
Well, a lot of people complained to the ESRB.

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
And a lot of people wrote them and said, this game is violating our privacy.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
You should go back and re-rate this game.

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
Kind of like trying to get at them that way. Well, the ESRB sent

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
an apology letter. Well, not really an apology letter, but they sent out

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
a letter of resolution basically saying, thank you

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
for contacting us. Your concerns were legit.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
It's our understanding that Blizzard provided an update announcing

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
they're not going to do it, so we're closing your request.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
Just kind of one of those, like, you know, hey, we appreciate

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
your concern, but, you know, it's kind of done

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
with now, right? But we wanted to follow up with you anyway.

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
Well, here's the part about it that really

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
sucks. All of the people that wrote in

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
to complain, yeah, all of their names

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
and email addresses were in the to field.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
Because somebody didn't think, oh, I should put those in the

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
BCC field. So all

47:46.000 --> 47:49.000
of the people who complained had their

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
email addresses exposed.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
Oh, they're going to sue.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
And now granted, ESRB wrote

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
an apology, like, not even 24 hours later.

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
They sent out an apology that, and the nice thing was

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
they kind of addressed the irony. They didn't try to beat around the bush.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
They did say in their apology, the fact that our message

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
addressed an individual's concerns with respect to their privacy

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
underscores how truly disappointing a mistake this was on our part.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
We work with companies to ensure they are handling people's private

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
information with confidentiality, care, and respect. It is only

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
right that we set a good example and do no levs ourselves.

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
So at least they didn't try to give you a BS corporate answer.

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
Well, I mean, to some extent. It was a little washed out.

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
You know when they said they were like, aw, crap.

48:34.000 --> 48:37.000
Well, first off, you know an intern did this.

48:37.000 --> 48:40.000
And secondly, when he hit the send button, you know he went,

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
aw, fuck.

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
I'm going home. I gotta go home.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
Please don't crap on interns. I'm planning on being an intern. I am an intern.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
I'm just saying. It's not that I'm crapping on interns.

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
Rob, an intern designed the FedEx logo.

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
Okay. The Federal Express logo or the FedEx logo?

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
The FedEx logo.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
It's clever. Regardless of whether it was an intern

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
or the CEO, you know after clicking the send button,

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
they went, aw, fuck.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
The FedEx logo, all that is is just the Federal Express logo.

49:13.000 --> 49:16.000
They just dropped it down the FedEx like Bevmo.

49:16.000 --> 49:19.000
The E and the X make an arrow.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
That's very clever.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
Alright, look. Just drop it. It was a mistake on their part.

49:25.000 --> 49:28.000
They apologized for it, but it's just one of those

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
moments where you just cover your face with your palm

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
and shake your head. Anyhow, there's more

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
in the Real ID saga. And this is important

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
because after all the ranting I've done in previous episodes,

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
if Blizzard's gonna come out and say, oops, we made a mistake.

49:43.000 --> 49:46.000
I think it should be acknowledged. And to some extent,

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
that's what's happened this week. Nathera, who's one of the

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
community managers, did post on the official WoW forums

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
about some Real ID follow-ups. One,

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
my biggest complaint about the system as it was, the Friends of Friends

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
feature. She went on to say,

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
they've been evaluating how Real ID has been used since its release

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
to identify the new functionality that will help improve our players' experience, blah blah blah.

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
The in-game Real ID Friends of Friends list is designed

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
to give players a convenient way to populate the Real ID Friends list,

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
blah blah blah, corporate speak corporate speak. Oh, however,

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
we recognize that some players would prefer not to be displayed on Friends

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
lists in this fashion, so we plan to include an option

50:22.000 --> 50:25.000
that will allow players to opt out of appearing on

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
their Real ID Friends, Friends of Friends list.

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
This should be ready by the first StarCraft 2 patch.

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
Yay!

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
Yay, someone knocked some sense into Blizzard.

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
But, I'm not totally over this yet.

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
Am I to the point now where my number one concern

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
with Real ID was addressed? Yes.

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
But, I still get a little nervous

50:49.000 --> 50:52.000
because remember last week we had that story about the one

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
line of code that would show your real name out there?

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
Now, yes, it was hotfix, blah blah blah, but the fact that it existed

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
in the first place, that still kind of makes me nervous.

51:01.000 --> 51:04.000
And I think I have a right to question,

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
just where the hell is Blizzard going with all this?

51:07.000 --> 51:10.000
And an awesome point that was brought up to me today

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
was Blizzard hasn't said anything about their next MMO yet.

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
And we're anticipating that we're going to be hearing a lot about it

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
at Blizzcon this year.

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
And after all this mess of the past few months

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
and Real ID and this whole trying to get closer and closer

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
into bed with Facebook, I'm kind of really

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
concerned about what Blizzard has planned for their next MMO.

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
FaceCraft?

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
Blizzard goes on to say,

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
what are your plans for Facebook integration?

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
With regard to Facebook, our goal is to help Blizzard gamers on Battle.net

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
more easily connect to their real life friends and family.

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
For the launch of Starcraft 2, we are introducing an optional

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
Facebook friend finder feature to help achieve this goal.

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
The friend finder enables players who decide to use it

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
to easily populate their Battle.net friends list

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
by sending Real ID friend requests to the people on their

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
Facebook friends list who have Battle.net accounts.

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
We hope players will find this feature convenient, but it's completely optional,

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
blah blah blah blah blah. So in other words, you can

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
now, if you want to go onto

52:13.000 --> 52:16.000
Facebook and pull all of your friends' Real IDs

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
from your Facebook, you can do that, I think is what they're saying?

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
This way people in China

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
that may have to leave their game

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
to visit friends and family

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
don't have to do that. They can sit there and play their games.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
I do not like this direction that Blizzard

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
is going. They are a gaming company. Stop trying to be

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
a social network. Throughout all of this,

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
what they really should have learned,

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
they really need to sit down

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
in a meeting. They need to come into the office Monday morning,

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
sit down in a meeting, and I feel like I can speak

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
to this with some authority. And stop sniffing glue? Well, that's

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
the first place. But I've been a corporate trainer for the past

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
seven years. I sometimes have to facilitate

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
meetings like this. I think these guys

53:04.000 --> 53:07.000
should come in, sit down, and really ask

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
themselves, why are we here?

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
What is the goal of our company? Why do people

53:13.000 --> 53:16.000
pay us $15 a month? To make money.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
That's all they're in for the money.

53:19.000 --> 53:22.000
Do they pay us $15 a month so that they can

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
have their real life be reminded

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
of their real life and their Facebook friends and all this all the time?

53:28.000 --> 53:31.000
No. People pay $15 a month to escape the real world

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
and slay internet dragons. That is why they pay the money.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
Are people leaving the game in droves because of this? No.

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
I don't think they are.

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
Boy, when that announcement went out, yes they did. There was lots of people

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
that posted screenshots, said they were leaving,

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
etc.

53:49.000 --> 53:52.000
Oh, I'm going to boycott Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
Oh, I'm going to boycott Left 4 Dead 2.

53:55.000 --> 53:58.000
Just like all these people. What they're going to do is wait for them

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
to say the magic words,

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
and then they'll come right back and then they'll get screwed again.

54:04.000 --> 54:07.000
Salacious Pop says this beautifully.

54:07.000 --> 54:10.000
If they are already a real life friend, I know where they are

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
because I've met them. If I want to be on their Facebook,

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
call and ask. Perfect.

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
You know what? From here on out,

54:19.000 --> 54:22.000
until Blizzard has decided that they are

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
not going to get into bed with Facebook so much anymore

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
and keep sucking their dick as they've been so much recently,

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
until Blizzard comes out and says,

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
we are games first, I'm going to be referring to

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
Blizzard as Blizzinga, because that is what they are.

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
They are Blizzard meets Zynga.

54:40.000 --> 54:43.000
So, Blizzinga from here on out.

54:43.000 --> 54:46.000
When I say that on the show, you know who I'm talking about.

54:46.000 --> 54:49.000
But until they have decided, you know what, we are a gaming company first

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
and maybe we should not try to get so much into

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
the social network stuff or push it down everybody's throats

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
as hard as we've been, they are Blizzinga.

54:58.000 --> 55:01.000
And Blizzinga needs to take a cue

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
from Xbox Live,

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
because I think it's one of the things that Microsoft has done very, very well

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
and the great thing about Xbox Live, it does have that

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
community feeling, you have achievements and messages

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
and you have that Facebook integration if you want it

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
and you can find Facebook friends if you want to.

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
It's done right on Xbox Live, I think.

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
I don't understand why they make it like you can't

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
like all of a sudden I have to find my friends out there.

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
I mean, there's so many social networking sites out there right now.

55:31.000 --> 55:34.000
Twitter, Facebook, MySpace if you're still using it

55:34.000 --> 55:37.000
and a whole bunch of other sites and games that do this.

55:37.000 --> 55:41.000
Why do I need their help in connecting with my friends?

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
I've already connected with my friends probably a dozen times now.

55:44.000 --> 55:48.000
And there is still the phone, there's still mail,

55:48.000 --> 55:54.000
there's still email, there's still a bunch of other ways to talk to your friends.

55:54.000 --> 55:57.000
I just don't understand, it's like, oh my god,

55:57.000 --> 56:00.000
I'm cut off from the rest of the world unless

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
I use Blizzard to connect with my friends.

56:03.000 --> 56:07.000
Let's see here, Tigerclaw in our chat room says,

56:07.000 --> 56:11.000
Sky, maybe they should pull an apple and do a Q&A press conference lol.

56:11.000 --> 56:15.000
Well that's why Blizzingacon 2010 this year is going to be awesome.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
Because there are going to be some of those people that bought tickets

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
before all this shit happened that are going to the con.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Those developer Q&As are going to be awesome.

56:23.000 --> 56:28.000
Like, I hate Blizzcon, like I kind of think it's kind of ridiculous

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
and I have zero interest in going and paying $150 to go to one company's E3 booth.

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
But look, this would be the year to go.

56:35.000 --> 56:39.000
It's the point where I'm seriously considering getting the DirecTV feed

56:39.000 --> 56:43.000
because those Q&A sessions are going to be awesome.

56:43.000 --> 56:48.000
Angry nerds in the building with the developers who anger them.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
They will not be angry.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Reality television show in the making.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
They'll be drinking the Kool-Aid, they will be just...

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Tables will be overturned.

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
They'll be taking it and they'll be like, hey look at this wheel we got for you.

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
And they'll be like, oh I forgive you for everything you've done.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
That's so awesome.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
Oh my God.

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
Unicycles now in World of Warcraft.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
That's just the best thing ever.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
People are sheep.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
And you know what?

57:12.000 --> 57:16.000
The people that follow Apple products, the people that follow Blizzard products

57:16.000 --> 57:21.000
and countless other different brands out there that just eat up this shit

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
despite all the crap that they do.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
They're going to still be playing the game.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
They're still going to forgive them.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
And you know what?

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
They leave for World of Warcraft, they'll come back for whatever the fuck

57:31.000 --> 57:35.000
next MMO they've got because, oh Blizzard's fun.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
I'll give them another try.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
No one's going to...

57:39.000 --> 57:44.000
No one really just up and just says, oh forget it.

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
I'm not dealing with them anymore until their next shiny thing comes out.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
They're just going to be right back where they were before.

57:49.000 --> 57:53.000
I will say that I have quit MMOs from principle.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
So...

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
But...

57:56.000 --> 57:57.000
Go ahead.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.000
That's the person I am.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
If I don't like something, I'm not going to put up with it.

58:00.000 --> 58:03.000
But would you go back if your problem changed?

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
Probably not.

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
Really?

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
Probably not.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
Well I mean...

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
It ended up getting a lot worse.

58:10.000 --> 58:14.000
It was the whole crap with Ragnarok Online and just how stupid they were getting

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
and how...

58:15.000 --> 58:19.000
What my problem was with them was them implementing the in-town raids.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
And it got worse.

58:21.000 --> 58:25.000
I had a list of grievances and they weren't doing anything so I quit.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
I've got to read this comment from chat because I've been wanting to get it out there

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
and it has to do with the same topics.

58:28.000 --> 58:29.000
So let's just pop in chat.

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
Chat.orangewormsready.com if you want to join us on this Sunday night.

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
It says, I don't think it's disingenuous for someone who boycotted something to come back

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
if the bad policy was lifted.

58:37.000 --> 58:40.000
That just means you voted with your wallet and it worked so you came back.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
I agree with him.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
I agree.

58:42.000 --> 58:46.000
This kind of reminds me though, SSJ100Matt says,

58:46.000 --> 58:49.000
are you people still mad at Blizzard about no LAN support?

58:49.000 --> 58:50.000
Blizzinga, please.

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
Blizzinga, whatever.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
That's your thing, okay?

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
I'm not going to try to remember that because that's stupid.

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
Well, the name's stupid.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
I'm just with the work on the name.

58:59.000 --> 59:02.000
Well, because zinga are the people that make Farmville.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
I understand that.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
I get the reference.

59:05.000 --> 59:08.000
We don't need to point more attention to them.

59:08.000 --> 59:14.000
No, I was just saying that he brings out a perfect point

59:14.000 --> 59:18.000
because they took out a feature that really pissed off everybody else

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
and they're like, oh, I'm boycotting the game.

59:20.000 --> 59:25.000
How much you want to bet that Starcraft 2 sells millions of fucking copies

59:25.000 --> 59:29.000
and it would be like as if that never happened,

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
as if those features were never removed,

59:32.000 --> 59:36.000
that maybe the fans still bought it anyways

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
despite being pissed off at the company.

59:38.000 --> 59:42.000
So you're basically saying never forget you were pissed about the LAN thing.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Never forget.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
I've got more of those.

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
There was something else I saw earlier this week.

59:49.000 --> 59:55.000
I guess we can talk about it real quick because it sort of ties in with Activision.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Real quick, because we've got to move on to more stories.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
Real quick, I'm sorry.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
There's another tangent I have to go on here.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Okay, real quick.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Remember how I brought up, and no one seemed to give a fucking shit about it,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.000
remember I brought up that Activision is starting to price Wii games,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
remember the Wii games usually are 50 bucks retail at the most,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
for $60 retail for certain games

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
because they think that they should get some more money

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000
because music licensing or whatever.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
I forgot. Thank you for reminding me to never forget.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000
And I'm not saying that Activision is the only one to blame too

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
because Beel's Rock Band, same thing happened with that.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000
They were charging $60 for the Wii version of the game.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Well guess what?

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
It's been another year, no one's really complained, and it's happening again.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
And guess what? It's not just happening now with music games,

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.000
but the new Tony Hawk game is also going to be $60 on the Wii.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Why? No one's going to buy it anyways,

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
and now you're giving them another reason not to buy it.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.000
But also, Guitar Hero, Warriors of Rock, I'm sure DJ Hero 2,

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
those are all $60 price points.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
You guys need to not forget this stuff

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
because they're going to start sneaking out more games like that.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
And I know for me that's not a big deal

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
because I don't game that much on the Wii,

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
but for other people it might be a big deal.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
And if you don't stop it here, they're just going to keep going.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000
What's going to stop them from saying,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
oh, well now we're adding 3D into our 360 games?

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
They're going to be $70 retail.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Vote with your wallet.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Seriously, so...

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
I think we should make Loki's never forget a regular segment.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Ray Ayanami says he doesn't play any Blizzard game anyways.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
You know, you may not play Starcraft 2 or Diablo 3 or this unannounced MMO,

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
but the reason why we spend so much time on it,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
and I apologize, I know not everyone's into WoW,

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000
but keep in mind, WoW is that behemoth of an RPG game right now anyway.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Where they go, a lot of the industry tends to follow.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Blizzard right now is the Rockefellers back in the day,

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
and you know what happened with them.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Go back and read a history book.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000
And this came up last week, and I think it's doubly true

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
after a lot of this Blizzard talk this week.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
The WoW killer is WoW.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
It's just a matter of when.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
So anyhow, I will tell you what the WoW killer is not,

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000
because I was reminded I didn't even mention this during my gaming week.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I played the Final Fantasy XIV beta this week.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
I spent a little time with it.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
This is my little tangent I wanted to get on,

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
because I forgot to mention this during my gaming week.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
I played the Final Fantasy XIV beta on Tuesday.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
I'm not sure if I'm actually supposed to be talking about it or not, but...

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Who cares?

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Who cares?

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000
I'll tell you this, it's not my account, so I'm not under any NDA.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Ha ha ha.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
So anyhow, I'm not going to tell you whose it is though.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000
I played the beta, and it's awful.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
It is awful.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:42.000
It is horrible, awful, laggy, not fun.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I'm not buying this game when it comes out if it's in this shape.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Granted, it's a beta, not a demo.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Betas are buggy, betas are slow.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
But betas also are supposed to give me an impression, at least,

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
of what I'm to expect in the final product.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.000
I got dumped into this world with no explanation

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
what I was supposed to do, where I'm supposed to go,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000
how you proceed, all these fancy big words of guild levs

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000
and armethith crystals and these quests and all these things,

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000
and I realized I could probably go online and figure it out,

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000
but I thought the big thing about Final Fantasy XIV

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
was that it was supposed to be more accessible than Final Fantasy XI was.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.000
It's not in its current shape.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
This game is supposed to come out September 30th.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000
It is not ready. Not ready.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
I'll try it again. I'll try the beta one more time

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
before the actual game is released to see if maybe they added some expositions.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
I will say this. At first, I was like,

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Ooh, this is pretty. Ooh, this cutscene is so pretty.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Ooh, my characters in this cutscene.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Oh, my gosh, this is a beautiful game.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000
This looks so amazing. This character customization is really thorough.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:56.000
And then I was stuck in the city running around for an hour

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
because I had no idea where the hell I was supposed to be going

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
or what I was supposed to be doing.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I want to try it.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
It's bad.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
I still want to try it.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
It's bad.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I want to try it though.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Just so I can see how bad.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
S2100Matt says,

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
So wait, Rob, what you're describing is Final Fantasy XI.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Yeah, kinda.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Yeah.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
At least with Final Fantasy XI, I don't know.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Maybe it was because I had friends that played,

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
but I still feel like I was able to figure it out somewhat,

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
but I went into combat. I was fighting a rat or something.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
I don't even know, and I got frozen in combat,

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
and the rat wasn't targetable anymore,

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
and I had to abandon the quest,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
and if I wanted to start the quest again,

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
I would have had to run 30 minutes back into town.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
It was ridiculous.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Again, I know it's a beta.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
I'm not supposed to be giving my final impressions on the game,

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
but if the beta was supposed to be raising my excitement

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
for somebody that spent three years of his life

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
playing Final Fantasy XI, didn't work.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
I'll tell you that.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
That's a shame.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Yeah, it is a shame. It's a real shame.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
What's also a shame nowadays

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
is that it will still be released on the 30th,

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
and what'll happen then is just,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000
oh, well, we'll patch it later.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Well, I mean, they still have time to patch it, but not much.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
All right, let's actually get to another story.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
I'm sorry we've taken up so much time with real ID and stuff,

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
but, you know, this stuff's important.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Jamie, what do you got for us?

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
What about a story I never played?

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Nice.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Okay, because a lot of people love games on Facebook,

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
and a lot of people love Zuma.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
I think you said you liked Zuma, didn't you?

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Zuma's pretty fun.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
It's not my favorite PopCap game,

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
but I don't think there's any PopCap games

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
that are really bad, per se.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Like, they get the job done.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
As far as casual games go, they're all crackerific.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
I love Peggle.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
I love Peggle, too.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.000
At any rate, Zuma Blitz is gonna be coming out on Facebook.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000
It's supposed to have in about three weeks a beta,

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000
and then we should start seeing tournaments and levels

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000
and experience points and getting different features

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.000
and treasure chests and virtual currency and blah, blah, blah.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
So it should be cool.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
I mean, it's gonna go up there with Bejeweled Blitz,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
and that's got a lot of people playing it.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
I like me some Zuma, and it should be good,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
and I know a lot of people eat that up,

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000
especially on Facebook, so it's gonna be cool.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
You know, the only thing that I play on Facebook right now

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
is that Hotel City thing.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
You know who would like that?

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Xtifer.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
He used to play lots of Zuma.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
That's right, he did.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Someone should tell him.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000
He should be listening.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Blazinga, take note.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
PopCap knows how to do the Facebook integration thing,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.000
just saying.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.000
And, um, well...

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
No, never mind, we've beaten this horse.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
It's already dead and bleeding from his pores.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Give it another whip.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
You haven't said enough on this.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
We haven't skinned the horse yet.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
It's not over until we skin the horse.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Because my Vicodin's wearing off.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.000
I really think that, well, I was just thinking about

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
what you said about them really needing to sit down

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
and go over their business model,

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
but what if this is actually a true integrated part

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000
of their business model?

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Abandon ship.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
I'm gonna just go back and say one thing about it.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Everybody, if you really are displeased with it,

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
do it in numbers.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Hit them in the bank and do it with people.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Organize.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
But then where will I fight my internet dragons?

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
There's other games, Rob.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Rob?

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
It's just not the same.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
What did I say last time?

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Principle versus entertainment.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
What's more important?

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.000
I don't know. I really like entertainment, Jamie.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Entertainment, Rob?

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Rarely got anything going in motion.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Well, this is interesting.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:56.000
THQ apparently is impressed by the 3DS piracy protection.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Of course, you may remember the piracy has been

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000
a really big problem for the Nintendo DS,

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:07.000
and tons and tons of games being hurt by the amount of piracy

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
that there is on that system,

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000
and because it's so very easy to do.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Ian Curran, THQ's executive VP of global publishing,

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:23.000
is saying that what excites me even more about the 3DS

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
is that there's technology built into the device

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
to really combat piracy.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000
He added, they combated piracy on the DSI,

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
which they don't believe is cracked yet,

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
but they know they've been hurt across the world,

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:44.000
and they believe that the 3DS has got the technology to stop that.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I'm kind of curious what that is, but I guess they can't tell us,

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
or then the pirates would start getting to work.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Well, here's my observation about that.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Nintendo thinks that they've stopped piracy on the DSI.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Really?

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I mean, because I've seen flash carts with the DSI.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
I'm not going to go buy a DSI,

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
because I'm probably going to pick up a 3DS eventually,

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:13.000
but I mean, they haven't stopped piracy on the DSI,

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.000
and they're just going to get smarter.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000
I mean, since it's basically cartridges it's reading off of,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
if you can mimic the data that's on there,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
then I don't see how it can really stop it.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000
I mean, they have anti-piracy measures that they put into the games,

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.000
but it takes like a week or two to crack them at the most,

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000
and a lot of them get cracked day one, if not early,

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
because they come out in other regions.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
I guess we won't really truly have the second half to this story

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
until the 3DS is out.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
We know what that anti-piracy measure is,

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
but it just seems like an echo of what we always hear.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
It'll probably take a few months,

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.000
but considering the technology is still going to be somewhat backwards compatible

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000
because it's going to be playing DS games,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
it's going to probably be as easy to crack as the DSIs,

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
so it'll be a matter of time.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000
I don't think that they've finally solved the problem.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Well, here's something, and maybe this ties into it.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
I don't know. This could be interesting,

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.000
but you know the 3DS has something that they talked about briefly called Tag Mode,

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.000
which I always thought was supposed to be a part of the regular DS,

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
but it kind of wasn't.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
But anyway, what Tag Mode is supposed to be,

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000
a passive communication feature that lets the DS systems talk to each other

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
and send the data back and forth,

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
which I always thought was some type of, it was in the DS, right,

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
because you could carry Animal Crossing around in your pocket,

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
but of course now you had to have the game on,

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000
and you had to be in that mode that sent out the letter in the bottle

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
or whatever it was, that mode. Remember that?

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
You could send the letters in the bottle.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000
But anyhow, I'm assuming this Tag Mode doesn't require that.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Like maybe your DS can be off, and it still will tag.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Maybe it uses low battery power to still kind of do this when it's asleep.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Yeah.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000
I don't know.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000
But there is a little more information given by Hideki Kono,

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
who is the platform producer of the 3DS,

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
in an interview with Wired Magazine.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000
He says, in the hardware, we have the capability that when you first play a game

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.000
that supports Tag Mode, it will save to a Tag Mode data slot in the hardware system.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000
We're planning to support multiple games at the same time.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000
So that's the difference.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Mario Kart, Nintendogs, Animal Crossing, and so forth.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
I see, because right now the game does have to be running.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000
So there will actually be a Tag Mode viewer where you can manage the data.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000
It will bring consumers a sense of wanting to play a game again

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.000
after they get new data from games that they'd already forgotten about.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000
What if the piracy is firmware updates delivered through Tag?

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
I'm sure that's one way they can do it.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000
That's what I'm thinking.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Like maybe that's one of the ways they're going to do it,

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000
is that you don't have a choice.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
These things are going to show up on your system

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000
because you walked by someone else with the newer firmware.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Wouldn't that be amazing? I bet that's it.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
I bet that's one of the antivirus images they have in it.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Well, one of the original ways that they used to have the flash carts kind of work

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.000
is they had some sort of thing with the Wi-Fi where you could do something with it.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I don't remember.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
I probably sound like an idiot with this.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
But I know there was something that involved Wi-Fi at one point

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
with the original DS flash carts and stuff

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:23.000
when they were first getting those to work with proprietary code and stuff like that.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000
It's possible.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000
I think it's kind of a neat feature.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Speaking of going back to play games that we haven't played in a while,

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000
and I'm sure most people out there already know this is possible,

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
but since I don't check up everything on the internet,

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
I was unaware that they had these things.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Apparently there's a track editor for Mario Kart Wii, and that's awesome

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
because there's all sorts of cool tracks out there that people have made.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
I'm like, ooh, that's exciting.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
That would actually get me to go back and play Mario Kart.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Why didn't they include that as a feature in the goddamn game to begin with?

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000
It would be so epic.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
But then, of course, they couldn't sell Mario Kart 2.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Yeah, exactly. That would be in the sequel.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
I mean, look at LittleBigPlanet, though.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000
I mean, they could easily.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Or ModNation Racers, which that's the whole thing, basically.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Exactly.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Such a missed opportunity.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Sj100Matt, in commenting on the possible tag mode is the anti-piracy,

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Sj100Matt says, Nintendo isn't that smart.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Let's see.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Toygak says, wireless is a battery hog. It better not be on.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
You can probably turn it off.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Well, yeah, and there's probably a thing where it uses really, really low battery

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000
until it detects that DS, and then it uses it for a minute, and then shuts back off.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Like, I don't see why the technology isn't there to do that,

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
where it slowly drains your battery.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000
But the battery power, you know, it's been, what, five years since the last DS?

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Or, sorry, not the last DS, but the first DS?

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000
I would think they've probably made the batteries in those things a lot better.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.000
And it's not like the games probably require that much more battery.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:04.000
I mean, yeah, they're 3D, but I don't think it's going to be that much more.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000
And Sj100Matt says, yeah, it does sound like the Pokewalker type of technology.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Sj100Matt also says, maybe they can track me via my 20-digit friend code.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Didn't they say they're going to...

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Oh, God, I hope they're not going to do friend codes this summer.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I think they kind of hinted they might be doing away with that.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Or changing it, I suppose.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
10-digit friend codes, woohoo!

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
One-digit friend codes.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
All right, let's move on to another story.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Dark Sakura's got something for us, and then release dates.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
And the classic game of the week is not too far away.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Well, for fans of Josh Stone, she's going to be the next Bond girl, at least, in James Bond Bloodstone.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Josh Stone. Bloodstone.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:54.000
She'll be playing Nicole Hunter, who is a socialite, works in diamonds, and said that she thinks it's crazy to be a Bond girl.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:04.000
So, just talking about having a full-body scan and everything, but it's supposed to be a third-person cover-based shooter with vehicle stuff in there.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.000
It's the bizarre creation tool.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Including cars and speedboats. So, should be fun.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Her name is Nicole Hunter.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Nicole Hunter.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000
In the game. That's kind of a shitty Bond girl name.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Like, whatever happened to Pussy Galore? That was awesome.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:27.000
And you know, even what was her name? Denise Richards was like Christmas something, or it was something really ridiculous.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Nicole Hunter.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Nicole Hunter is kind of boring.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Well, she did, though, describe the character as a posh version of Paris Hilton.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000
I thought Paris Hilton was supposed to be kind of posh already.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000
No.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000
I mean, she's kind of trashy.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000
She's posher!

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000
She's like, more posher. Oh, okay, that explains it.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.000
I would probably say, I would exchange that word with classy.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Let's make the character like Paris Hilton.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.000
She's not posh enough! I can't make her any more posher!

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Of course, if you want to make the character more posher, you should have gotten posh spice.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
I was saying classy.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:12.000
At any rate, you know, if they wanted to make her real trailer trash, you know, they probably just could have called her Atmore Motel 6.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Salacious Pop, thank you. Christmas Jones. She was a nuclear physicist.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000
That was Denise Richards in, whatever, like, was it Tomorrow Never Dies?

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000
She played a character named Christmas Jones. How ridiculous is that name?

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Christmas Jones.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Nicole Hunter? That's, I don't, like, I don't know, but I probably knew a girl in high school named that.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Like, that's not that exciting.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Now we got all these random Bond, Bond girl type names being yelled out here. Honey Rider, Posher Spice, maybe that could be the name.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Toa Gax says Paris Hilton equals Pussy Here, Pussy There, Pussy Pussy Everywhere.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000
That's kind of how she got famous.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Bond girl names could be exchangeable with, you know, porn star names too.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Oh, yeah, Jinx. Wasn't Hal Berry called Jinx?

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
What was her name? I think it was Jinx, because they were going to do a spinoff movie.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
By the way, you know what my favorite porn star name is?

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000
What?

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Alice in Chains. I just thought it was funny.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000
And lastly, before we move on to release dates, let's just pop in our chatroom.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Chat.overtonesloudandstrated.com says, how is Paris Hilton like Kansas?

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Both are flat, white, and easy to enter.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Strawberry Fields. Really? That was a Bond girl? Strawberry Fields?

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:40.000
See, Strawberry Fields, Pussy Galore, Christmas Jones, Nicole Hunter.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
It just doesn't work.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Alright, let's move on. Release dates. Travel around the world and talk about games coming out soon.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.000
In a store near you. We'll start with the US, Loki.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:58.000
You know, her name's sort of broken down. It could sound like Hole Hunter, so I mean, you know.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Sort of.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
What about Mike Hunter?

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Mike Hunter.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
That would have been better.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000
I did know a guy named Benjamin Dover.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Poor guy.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:14.000
So stuff coming out this week. Not a whole lot, because July is a pretty slow month.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:18.000
But there's some generic DS games, of course, coming out.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Hidden Objects Mystery Stories. That's another Hidden Objects game.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Yeah, because there's not a lot of those on the DS.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Apparently Trackmania Turbo, but I somehow doubt that's actually coming out, because I think I got delayed to October.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Samantha Swift and the Hidden Roses of Athena, which also I believe was delayed forever.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000
And I definitely go Trackmania on the Wii, man.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:49.000
You know, GameStop needs to update their fucking release list. It is terrible.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Mumbo Jumbo 6-Pack Seccident Edition. It's six games from Mumbo Jumbo that you can buy on PC.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Hooray!

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Wow, is that it?

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000
So there's, like, nothing coming out this week. That can't be right.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Maybe it's just a slow week.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Well, Hidden Objects Mystery Stories it is.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.000
I gotta go back to chat. I know the Bond girl thing is getting old, but this comment is too good.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
I'll look at a different list, because that's a pathetic listing.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Eric H. is in our chat tonight. He's actually the brains behind the big battle over at Dead Pixel Live, so welcome.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:34.000
He says, Christmas Jones led to the worst end lines of any Bond film. I thought Christmas only came once a year.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Okay, there is other things this week. I forgot.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.000
They had him on weird release dates, so it didn't really make sense to me.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Dark Star One Broken Alliance on Xbox 360, which that game actually reminds me of.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:56.000
I don't know if anyone remembers this PlayStation 1 game, but Colony Wars, or even, like, Descent Free Space.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
So that might be kind of cool on 360.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Ark Rise Fantasia on the Wii, really awesome role-playing game.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:10.000
And Cats and Dogs Revenge of Kitty Galore on DS.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:18.000
And I don't think it's on this list, but I remember it, and why the god hell did they make this game in the first place.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.000
The Bachelor, featuring The Bachelorette, as well on Wii and DS.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Yes, the Bachelor video game. That is correct. And Zany Golf on Wii.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Really? Like, what game do you make out of- is that the closest thing we're gonna get in America to a dating sim?

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Um... Maybe?

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000
I wanna be the Bachelor that rejects them all. Like, didn't that happen on one of them?

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Like, he or she, I don't remember, one of them just said,

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
You know what? You all suck. I don't want any of you.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Oh, fuck you all. I'm outta here.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Later. Oh, I played again.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Losers. I just wanna get laid. Done. I don't need you.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Christmas only came once a year. On the Xbox 360 in Japan this week.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Blur Razors comes out in Japan this week. You know, I'm kind of thinking that is actually Blur over there, and it is.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.000
But they call it Blur- it's Blur Racers. On this website it's incredibly spelled.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Razors? I know, I thought that was a dumb name.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Blue Racers!

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Blue Racers with a Z, by the way. That's important. Blur Racers with a Z is out in Japan this week.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Bruh. Bruh.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Stop it. 99 Nights 2 comes out in Japan this week.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:39.000
I saw that on the shelf at the gaming store. I thought about buying it for five seconds, and I was like, what am I thinking?

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:45.000
That's pretty much it on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan, so unfortunately you guys had to wait for some of the games we've had here.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:54.000
But on PlayStation 3 you get Blur Racers as well, or Ken Tomahou to Gakuno Mono is coming out as well.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:00.000
I don't even know what this is. This is an upgraded version of the Cute Fantasy School Life RPGs.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000
This must be a remake of an old game that's now available.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:08.000
It looks like it involves kind of like the card style battle in the game.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Kind of mixed with a Dragon Warrior-esque style battle system.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:18.000
I like how in big letters it says Hito! On that screenshot.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:24.000
So that's probably not something coming out over here, because that does not look familiar to me at all.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:30.000
But on the Nintendo Wii this week, one new game, Kage no Tu is coming out this week on the Wii.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:37.000
This is a Hudson game. You control a light source to solve puzzles and battle monsters.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.000
This is not a game I'm familiar with over here.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:50.000
No, that's Lost in Shadow that's coming out. It's that really cool, trippy puzzle platform game.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:54.000
I did see that at PAX East I think they were showing that.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Okay, so it's that. It's Kage no Tu over there in Japan.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Yeah, it's coming out over here in September.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I like how on Play Asia they have a wonderful combo where I can buy blur razors for the PS3 and I can combo with blur razors for the PS3.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Oh, I'm sorry, that's blur on the PS3 in case I want both versions of the game.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
You're gonna play American and Japanese. Why not?

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000
It's the same game.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
I'm not playing both. It's region free.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:30.000
On the Nintendo DS, Katekyo Hitman Reborn DS Flame Rumble XX. Yes, that is really the game's name.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
They have some crazy names over there.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
They like their subtitles.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
They love their subtitles. They really do.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Well, remember how long the one Street Fighter I have is like something, something, something for matching service.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Remember, the longer the subtitles, the better the game.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:56.000
TV Anime Fairy Tale Gekitou Madoushi Kessen comes out as well. Is this like an interactive anime?

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
That sounds like a really good game.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:04.000
It looks like an action game that's just based on an anime. Like the anime plays on the bottom screen and you're kind of controlling the top screen.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Looks a little silly.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:12.000
And lastly, going to the PSP for Japanese release dates, Fate slash Extra is the big release this week on the PSP.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:18.000
It's coming out in regular and limited editions because the only thing they love more in subtitles are limited editions in Japan.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Yeah, but my limited edition has a bowl and a plate and a knife and a clock.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Well, this is an RPG on the PSP. It actually looks kind of cool.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:32.000
It's kind of got a very Phantasy Star look to it. The newer Phantasy Star games, that is.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Yeah.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Kind of in its like action-y type attack. I got to say, this looks kind of neat, actually.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Who's the spy? Marvelous. So it's not even by Sega, but it kind of looks inspired by the newer Phantasy Star games, at least to me, at first glance.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
There it is, your Japanese release dates. How about the UK?

01:24:48.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Well, in the UK we have some games. We have, um, on the 19th we have Alien Swarm and the 20th Need for Speed World. Those are both PC, by the way.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:09.000
The 23rd is Dragon Quest IX Sentinels of the Starry Skies, and that's it until... Yeah, that's it.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Alright. Just a couple quick more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week while we transition into Part B tonight.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Loki, you got something else for us?

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Guess what? If you've signed up for the PlayStation Plus service, you may be a wonderful contestant in checking out Hulu Plus as well.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Hey, it's another service with Plus in the name. It's got to be good, right?

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Which will become available to select subscribers of the Sony's PlayStation Plus program starting now.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Apparently, eventually all subscribers may be able to check out the Hulu Plus service once it finally launches.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:26:00.000
But as of right now, you can download the Hulu Plus software and request an invitation to an exclusive preview.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:08.000
And if you're chosen, then you can preview the wonderful stuff that Hulu Plus will be allowing you to check out.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Am I hearing you correctly that you're telling me, if I pay Sony $50 a year, I might get the opportunity.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:33.000
I might get selected, my name might get pulled out of that hat, and I would be given the opportunity with my $50 a year to pay Hulu $10 a year to watch old crap on TV.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Am I correct in what I'm hearing?

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
You are correct, and doesn't it sound awesome?

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Sign me the fuck up! All this and core? Wow!

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:51.000
I don't know, I got nothing.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.000
It was beyond my ability to comment on, Rob.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Wait, can I tune in Hulu Plus stuff on my TV in my Sony home apartment?

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Probably not.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Can I possibly, I don't know, put out core magazines in my Sony apartment on home, like on my coffee table or anything like that?

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:22.000
I don't think you can do that, but in the mall they sometimes show clips from core.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Oh wow, clips! I'm gonna stay there in the mall forever until I see the whole month of core, just so I don't have to pay for it.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:35.000
And eventually I'll see all the clips, so that's gonna be a worthwhile investment of my time.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:42.000
You know, there's the OLR clubhouse right now, right? We have a clubhouse at home. Dumbest $5 I ever spent, but I had to do it.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000
OLR, we love to explore new ways to interact with our audience and all these social things.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Some of those ways may not be good.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Stupid dollars. Look, look, I took the hit for the team, okay? I spent $5 on this clubhouse at home.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Right now, we're limited to 25 members, and believe it or not, I don't know how this is possible, but I still get requests at least once a week to join the club, and I have to just file them away and ignore them.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Trust me, you're not missing out on anything.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Yeah, here's the thing. The clubhouse is a room, and I decorated it with the arcade machines that I won in the Namco demo, and I tried to put some stuff in there, but I can't put anything...

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:32.000
I can't put anything OLR-related in there. I can't put a clip from the show. There's a giant TV that sits at the top of the clubhouse. I can't do anything with it.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:45.000
I can't put, like, video, you know, because we've shot video before. I can't put that there. I can't put... I can't even put, like, the OLR artwork on the wall. I can do nothing.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:52.000
So what you're saying is you've transformed your OLR clubhouse into your game room.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Yes, I did.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Oh, Sony.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:05.000
And I paid five bucks for that exclusive opportunity to beta test the clubhouses.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Feeling a little impotent now?

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:19.000
I'm just shocked. I'm hearing the words come out of my mouth, and I want to smack myself on the back of the head and call me an idiot. I paid five dollars to beta test the clubhouse.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Here's the funny part about it, though.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.000
God, I'm an idiot.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:34.000
They're still, like, gung-ho with home and saying, oh, it's such a wonderful platform. Oh my god, it's so successful. Doesn't that sound a little bit like, oh my god, sodium one will blow your fucking mind?

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:53.000
UMD is such a wonderful format. It will change the world in, like, portable media. Damn it! Digital content? On a memory stick? Ah! Why didn't we think of that first?

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.000
It's just so funny.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Okay, okay. We're going to make this just fucking kick-ass game in home, and we're going to give it away for free, alright? You ready?

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:13.000
You're going to be in a tank, and you go around in this 3D space, and you shoot other tanks. Oh my god, it's a print! Run with it. It's amazing.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:28.000
And you can, like, post to your... You'll be able to post to your Twitter when you overtake other tanks, and you'll win stuff for your house. But not your real house, your fake house. And shirts.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Oh, but then you have to pay for additional levels once you get there. And for the record, I never got to the point where I had to buy additional levels because I got bored with the game that quick.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Look, I just... And for those that think we're being Xbox fanboys right now and giving Sony an unbelievable amount of hate, look, I'll just say this. Never forget Yaris.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:57.000
So, it can happen to anyone, alright?

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Hey! Speaking of the Xbox, actually, maybe this is a good thing to follow it up with. You know how they're making this awesome new channel called The Destination Arcade?

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Actually, it's not really... It doesn't actually sound that awesome at all. Destination Arcade is, like, this store that you can download to see the store in a whole new way.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:33.000
I mean, really, that's what it is. Destination Arcade, like, when we release this, you guys, you're gonna get to see the store in a whole new way. You're gonna have this all-new opportunity to buy things.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Man, that sounds awesome! And everybody's like, fuck yeah, sign me up! Destination Arcade's gonna be the shit!

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Well, guess what? Major Nelson came out and said, okay, so Destination Arcade, you get to download it this week and it's gonna, like, blow your mind, and then August 18th, we're shutting it off!

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000
So, it's a limited time only!

01:31:53.000 --> 01:32:06.000
We fixed all the problems with, you know, Xbox Live Arcade. We made things easier to find for a limited time, and then you're gonna have to go back to finding things the old hard way. Why bother?

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:28.000
So, there you go. I don't even have to defer to yours. This is just as stupid. You know what this is just like? This is just like, hey, guess what, guys? We know that you've been bitching about the D-Pad forever, and we're gonna release these wonderful limited edition FIFA controllers that are green, that have the D-Pad fixed, but it's only for a limited time. We're going back to the crappy broken D-Pad.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Okay, apparently, I didn't even know this until just now. Here's the best part. Wait for it, guys. Okay, so Major Nelson had an interview with Shaq News, apparently, and said that, I didn't even know this, I'm hearing this for the first time, said to Shaq News, if you've downloaded it, it will continue to work, but you can only download it until August 18th, apparently.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:16.000
So, if you wanna be part of this exclusive club, that's like, I don't even know, that's like going to a mall, and like, you could go to Macy's to buy clothes, or you could go to JCPenney, but you know what, you had to sign up for this, during this month-long promotion to go to JCPenney.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:26.000
And if you didn't sign up during that time, there's gonna be a guard at the door who's just gonna bounce you. Like, did you download this between July and August? Come on in. Fuck you, go to Macy's. We don't want your business.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:37.000
It's gonna be like this. It's gonna be like, okay, if you've downloaded this program, all the clothes will be on the shelf, but if you haven't downloaded this program, you're gonna have to go to the store where all the clothes are in a giant pile in the middle.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:47.000
They're just on the floor. It'll be like that old Nick game show, Finders Keepers.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Just to let everybody know right now, at this point, Rob has doubled over and put his head between his knees.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:34:08.000
I mean, how many news stories have we read tonight that just don't make any fucking sense? Like, what is wrong with all of you? Are you all high? Did they give out drugs in E3 this year?

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Well, why didn't we get to go then? I want drugs.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:23.000
You don't understand. Blasinga, Sony, Microsoft, you're all stupid. What is wrong? Rob is breathless with disbelief.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.000
We just figured it out. Our eyes are open.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.000
I just simply cannot. Rob's gonna cry.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:40.000
That's the perfect thing to do when you've solved problems in making things easier to find. You cancel it. That's perfect. That makes sense to me.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Not much makes sense anymore in this world.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:35:00.000
So, enjoy this very special store that you can only download for a limited time. And Salacious Pop's asking, so is it like a skin or what? You know, I don't know. I'm just told it's like this super special new way.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:07.000
It's fairy dust, okay? It's fairy dust.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
I got nothing.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:20.000
We're gonna offer this free game for a limited time. It's featuring a car from Toyota called the Yaris. It's gonna blow your mind.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Alright, you guys. We're gonna put out this vision camera.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
That was so bad it made me burp.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:44.000
We're gonna put out this camera and it's gonna allow you to play these awesome fucking games like totem ball. Yeah, it's like pinball, but you like use your hands. Use your hands. You flail. You make the pinball thingy go.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:51.000
By the way, this is the same company that's putting out a camera this year that you're gonna use your hands to.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Rob, yeah, let's not. It's too painful. What if it's too late for me to sell back my vision camera for, say, some store credit?

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Salacious Pop in our chatroom says, Major Nelson announces new store, announces that Seattle has the best weed, and that this dude at Rare takes the biggest bong hits he's ever seen.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:19.000
You know what? I think we need to take, we need to take a, what? Yes, Loki, final. I have a great idea. Yes.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:27.000
We want to show off the Kinect to get people excited about it. What store can we back connect with?

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:39.000
God, Macy's. Where do all the people that play Kinect gather on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays between noon and 8 p.m.?

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Where are they all at? Where would I go? Would I go to the mini golf? No, fuck the mini golf place. Would I go, would I go to the movies? No, no. Kinect players don't go to the movies. I know. We'll go to Macy's, who doesn't even have an electronics department.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:05.000
What the fuck? Oh, that's fun. You're all high.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:15.000
So let's take a look at the way they did it in the past. Let's see how you used to get high in the 80s, huh? With the trip down memory lane and the classic game of the week.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:25.000
That's right. We're going to take a moment to see the drug induced effects of video games back in the day. And boy, did Jamie pick a good one tonight for this topic, didn't you, Jamie?

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:40.000
I'm sure that did. I just want to point out, she picks these well before the show starts. It's just, it's just too good tonight.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:52.000
And I really put this in an honor of classic gaming expo because it's there every year. You mean, um, the California extreme? Whatever that thing was. Yeah, California extreme. The event that let you in free with a media pass? Yeah.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:38:02.000
I know they were great. Well, I'm, I'm covering it at media like and stuff. By the way, she just took another Vicodin folks. So you're in for a real treat in part B.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Well, my element was wearing off. I was in pain. Um, anyway, um, so yeah, Journey. Uh, Bally Midway put it out in the 80s. Um, and, uh, it was after, you know, Frontiers, which was their 1983 album by Journey, you know, got them really popular.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:40.000
So, um, it was supposed to go along with the US band tour. Um, and then, um, it was actually, uh, brought in incredible technologies as a second team of developers to, uh, bring it out for Christmas around that time.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:58.000
And so it's features the, who the band members were at the time, which was Steve Perry and Neil Sean, uh, Steve Smith, Jonathan Cain and Ross Valerie. Um, they have a sort of cartoon bodies, but their faces are really like these digital black and white photographs from while they were on tour.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Um, and it was supposed to use, um, this, uh, photo technology for another game, but it failed in location testing. So anyway, um, you have to, uh, go through the game to find the different, um, musical instruments or a microphone.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:34.000
So you play each of the members of the band in these different levels to get their missing musical implement. And now turn this up.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:51.000
That's in the last level. Um, there's actually a cassette player in the machine, um, that, um, when you get to the last level, it'll play a looped version of separate ways, which is what was playing on there.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:40:04.000
And the last level is that you have to keep fans from, uh, storming the stage and stealing the instruments again. And then of course, when they finally get past you, then, um, you have to go find the things again.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Um, there, there was another game that Journey was in. It was called Journey Escape for the Atari 2600. This was listed as number nine on the top ten worst licensed game ideas ever for, uh, Game Informer 2007.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Who doesn't know Dick, apparently, because Journey is awesome. Just saying. I want to see what this Journey Escape thing is. Yeah, Journey Escape. Here's from Emmanuel. You're on a boat with Journey. One of the world's hottest rock groups.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:57.000
A spectacular performance has just ended. Now it's up to you to guide each Journey band member past hordes of love-crazed groupies, sneaky photographers, and shifty-eyed promoters to the safety of the Journey Escape vehicle. And time to make it to the next concert. Your mighty manager and loyal roadies are there to help, but the escape is up to you.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Sounds like a ten to me. You have to make it to the Scarab Escape vehicle, the same one that's on the cover. I know, right? It was very different from the arcade game, so if you only played the 2600- The song Escape, though, ironically, is not in the game. But the intro is Don't Stop Believing. There you go. Alright. There it is, your classic game of the week journey. Oh, and by the way, the manager is the Kool-Aid man. What? Oh, the 2600 version?

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:37.000
The manager, inexplicably depicted as the Kool-Aid man. Hey, Kool-Aid man! Oh yeah! Oh no! Naughty, naughty Kool-Aid.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Alright, we're gonna take a quick break here. It's been kind of a fun Part A tonight. I don't know what's in the air tonight here at OLR Studios, but we're having fun. I hope you guys are, too. Join our chat if you're not already there. Chat.orangelaungeready.com. We got plenty more coming up in Part B tonight. We got our rapid-fire news, and Loki already blew it, but we are gonna talk about the Big Macy's tour. We've got to talk about some of that.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Also, 1 vs. 100 got canned this week, so you know we gotta talk about that, because it's kind of sad. And yeah, man, there's a lot of stories here tonight that are just, like, bad ideas. This is not Good News Week, everybody. I'm sorry, but hopefully there'll be some good gems tonight.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Go ahead. To be fair, we're actually not talking about the Macy's tour so much. It's actually a lot. Other places. Oh, there's the Roadshow, too. Alright, we'll mention them both, I'm sure.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:42.000
And there is some good news, though, we're gonna talk about as well. Mega Man Universe we'll talk about a little bit when we come back, and we'll talk as well about a very, very classic Atari 2600 game getting updated for the new millennium. That should be kind of interesting.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:48.000
So we'll talk about all that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio. Don't go anywhere, we'll be right back.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Hello, everybody, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this July the 18th, 2010, where we are taping live at All Games Radio. We're moving into Part B of our show, and I gotta tell you, if you're just tuning in, we've had a pretty funny show so far. Lots of fun chatter in Part A. Just a lot of weird news. It's been a very weird week in gaming, and a lot of strange ideas going on out there.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:28.000
And the fun is gonna continue here in Part B. If you are just joining us, come into our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and have your say, because the big part of our show that makes our show unique is you.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:42.000
And your chats and your tweets that we're gonna get to in a minute, and all that good stuff. And I also wanna call this out, your awesome iTunes reviews, when you say nice things about us on the internet that make us feel warm and fuzzy. I wanna read one here in a minute, but I gotta pull it up.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:51.000
So in the meantime, let's get to some rapid fire news and things that happened throughout the week that we can mention in a few seconds.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:44:14.000
The Expendables, a pretty awesome movie coming out this summer with a bunch of old action stars, is gonna be getting its own Facebook game, and it's very similar to Contra. And everybody loves Contra, and it kinda looks a little similar, I guess, because you can kill a bunch of people on a 2D platformer.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:25.000
But what you need to do is you just have to like the Expendables fan page in order to get access to the game. I don't know, you should like the movie. Looks awesome.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Sonic Colors is a new game from Sega coming out this fall, and GameStop has a wonderful pre-order bonus with that. You can get a Sonic the Hedgehog hat.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Yes, putting it on will make you that much closer to Sonic. And it's kinda neat looking, actually. Not enough for me to say pre-order the game.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Does it have like a blue spiky thing on it? Oh, it does! That's adorable.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:45:03.000
It's very adorable. So yes, you can check that out, and of course the game is gonna be on Wii and DS sometime this fall, probably around November.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:16.000
And there is a new Oddworld game in the works being developed by the company Just Add Water. And they did a game called Gravity Crash.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:26.000
And apparently it's got the, there are multiple projects across multiple platforms starring all your favorite Oddworld characters.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:39.000
And they haven't said exactly when they're actually coming out, but you should just at least take solace that they are in the works at some point soon.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:42.000
We'll see some Oddworld games come back.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Alright, I got some quick stories for you guys. One of them is about Kid Icarus. Kid Icarus? I like Kid Icarus. This is some other news coming out about Kid Icarus Uprising. Of course that's the 3DS game that finally brings back Kid Icarus after not being around ever since that Game Boy game.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Apparently, in a chat with Games Master, this is a magazine in the UK, Mashahiro Sakurai, who is the game designer at Super Smash Brothers Brawl, says that the online capabilities are currently being tested.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:21.000
And by the way, yes, he made Brawl and he's making this game. He's saying the online capabilities are currently being tested.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:30.000
There could be some versus play, but we can't go into any detail. There are a lot of capabilities that expand on what was in the DS that people are taking advantage of.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Hmm, so it sounds like the online and versus and all that is being toyed with, but we don't know anything for sure just yet, but it's kind of cool because I don't know about you guys, but I just assumed it was like a one player only thing.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Also, apparently some Capcom games are going to be making their way to the Wii Virtual Console Arcade. Sometimes you forget that the Virtual Console has an arcade, but they're going to be getting some Capcom games in an announcement this week.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Among some other Capcom announcements, we'll get into it in a little bit. So that's going to be kind of cool, some old school Capcom games.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:18.000
A place where Capcom games would be welcomed would be Game Room, who saw the release of Fishing Derby, Barnstorming, and Quad Run all on the Atari 2600 this week, as well as the JIRUS for the arcade and Hover Force for the Intellivision.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Unfortunately, as awesome as it is to have JIRUS in Game Room, it was already on the Xbox Live Arcade, so it's probably the most awesome game that hit this week, but it already had a version released, so unfortunately Game Room didn't have a lot of win there.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:41.000
However, I will say one place where Game Room wins, and I mentioned this in part A, but I wanted to say this as well, it did have a little upgrade this week that they patched into the game some new little features.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Like now, if you've been playing a game for a long time, the other avatars will come up behind you and start watching you and applaud you when you finally lose, although I don't know why they applaud you when you lose.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:08.000
And then like fireworks when you get a medal, and most importantly, live leaderboards. When you're playing in ranked mode, you see your position in the leaderboard in real time, and you watch yourself conquer, like who's in 900th place, then 800th place, then 700th.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:20.000
It's actually a really cool little addition, I thought that was neat. I was most excited as someone who's really tried to support Game Room and has sometimes been disappointed, but I'm really happy to see that they are doing updates, it makes me very hopeful for the future.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Now they just need some more licenses, like the Wii God with Capcom this week, that would be great. So we'll see. DarkSakura.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Well, something great coming out for iPhone will be Star Wars Battle for Hoth, especially good for fans of the Empire Strikes Back, right? Which people will arguably say is the best Star Trek movie, although I am personally a fan of Return of the Jedi, it's just me.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:51.000
I think A New Hope was the best one. I know, I'm weird.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Rob hurt my brain. Anyway, it's gonna be out for $2.99, and it's meant to celebrate the 30 year anniversary of the Empire Strikes Back. Pretty cool, huh?

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:21.000
For Rock Band News, we have the Stooges and Bad Religion, the Stooges Pack 01, which total will be 440 Microsoft Points, or $5.49, includes $19.69, I Wanna Be Your Dog, and No Fun, each of those, well actually, $19.69 and No Fun will be 200 Wii Points a piece.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:31.000
I was wondering why it's only saying that one of them has a Microsoft Points list. Forget I said that. They're $19.99 a piece.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Individual songs coming out are both by Bad Religion, New Dark Ages, and No Control, each 160 Microsoft Points, or 200 Wii Points.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:53.000
And they will, of course, some of them being the Stooges Pack and No Control by Bad Religion will be in Lego Brock Band Store. I love Bad Religion. Gray band.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Alright, we're gonna get into this. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were done. My bad.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.000
I have three!

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Ah, my bad.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Rob is ignoring me. I am being marginalized!

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:08.000
I am multi-tasking, and I thought I heard three things.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.000
I'm being marginalized! Cause I'm a woman!

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Yes, because you're a woman.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:25.000
I know. Anyway, um, now there is this really cool dude who has an even cooler, I would have to say, uh, I guess you're married by now, I don't know.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Um, but his name is Ray, is Ray Arafanto, who works for Xbox platform team, um, is getting married, or has gotten married, and his wedding ring is fantastic.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Um, it is a USB platinum wedding ring.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:53.000
And, um, and on it, it says, um, for a lifetime of memories.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Isn't that pun-tastic?

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Is it actually like you could plug it in a USB slot with the ring?

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:17.000
No, I don't need it. Actually, you know, I read though, um, Rob, I did read about another one, and I tried to find the pictures of it and I couldn't, about a couple that did have a USB wedding ring, a real USB wedding ring, and on it were, um, photos of their courtship.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Wow.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:26.000
Yeah, that's why I would think, that's kind of what I thought of when you first talked about a USB wedding ring, like somebody's gonna plug one in.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Yeah, this one's just sort of cut into a USB-looking pattern.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:45.000
But, um, but no, I did actually find one, um, about a couple that actually did have the, their, uh, ring, their rings each were, uh, photos of their lives together, built into the ring.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:52:08.000
You know, this whole, like, USB, and to some extent mini-USB, and that whole technology is really interesting, like, you know, um, you know those, like, MedicAlert bracelets they used to have back in the day, and they still do, that, like, you know, they're like silver, and they have little snakes, the very identifiable medical thing on it, and it's usually for people, like, who are diabetic, or allergic, or have some type of medical condition, whereas they ever become unconscious, you know, and have to have an ambulance called on them, the ambulance knows something about them.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
You know, they're putting that stuff on USB now.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
I'm actually planning on making one for myself.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:21.000
You see, like, these little, like, USB jewelry type things, and now it's, like, your whole medical records will be on there. Well, not, not your whole thing, but, you know, everything they need to know is there.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Well, see, that's actually a plan that I have, um, is getting one of those little, um, kind of rubber with the USB clasp, as it were.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Um, because, I mean, I had to repeat for the staff a couple of times that I'm allergic to penicillin, and amoxicillin, and the psyllins of the family, the mold, you know, and I was just thinking, what if I had fallen unconscious and had a bad infection, they tried to give me penicillin, you know.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:53.000
So, I think that those are fantastic ideas. I'm actually looking into the cost of just making it myself.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Either with a micro-USB or doing, um, a micro-SD, to have it embedded in there.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Uh, bonesis6, 006, bondsis6, there's two Zs, which makes it very strange to pronounce, bonesis6 in our chatroom says a USB dildo.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:20.000
You know, you could charge it, kind of like you do an iPhone. It's not outside the realm of possibility, I'm sure it's sadly been done.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:25.000
They have USB AA batteries, that can charge in the...

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Salacious Pop says RFID would seem more intuitive, that's what they use for pets. I didn't even think about that, of course, like if a pet gets lost, that's all you'd need. Crazy.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Um, alright, we're gonna get into Twitter topics here real quick, but first, I mentioned I was gonna read this.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:45.000
We are so appreciative when people leave us nice reviews on iTunes, on our listing there, because it helps us spread the word about our show.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:53.000
This one was especially nice, so I wanted to read this real quick, because it's awesome. It's from HungryMrDrunk, is the name of the user.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
I know when I get drunk, I get hungry.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Uh, I have been a hardcore listener, lol, for years, and I can say that every Sunday I only think about running to my PSP to listen to this amazing podcast.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:08.000
I think it should be syndicated on the radio. After all, they are official game analysts under President Cat.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:13.000
They got me into music games like DDR and Guitar Hero, and because of them, I became a better gamer.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Thank you guys for the best eight years of my life.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Not to mention, we are the official podcast of the universe.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Actually, it's funny, he actually says in the title, why OLR is the best podcast in the galaxy.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Although technically it's the official video game podcast of the galaxy.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
But I like being called best too.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
It is nice, it's very nice.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
That was a very sweet thank you person.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Thank you HungryMrDrunk.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:38.000
HungryMrDrunk, you should come over and have a beer with me.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Yes, that's right, I hope you're next week.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:40.000
When I'm not on Vicodin.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Lots of Guinness and Cheetos.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Alright, let's get into Twitter topics.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Shall we move into Twitter topics? We shall.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:48.000
I guess.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:49.000
You guess?

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
I guess.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Get a fan.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:56.000
I'm a god Rob, I'm a god.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
When did you last take a Vicodin?

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
An hour ago.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
So during the show.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Yes, it is during the show.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:05.000
During the show.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Let's see.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Whatever.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Alright.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.000
You know, I figured out why it's affecting me very strongly.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Why is that?

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Because keep in mind, I did one of those major detoxes when I went raw.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:23.000
I quit like almost every bit of medication.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:26.000
I didn't even take any pain medication or anything.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:31.000
And so it's hitting me harder than it really used to.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.000
It is.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Can I get to the Twitter topic?

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Kitty!

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Sorry.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:41.000
SSJ100Matt sent me this link. It has nothing to do with anything.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:44.000
This is why I really don't like to click on YouTubes during the show.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
But SSJ100Matt is kind of funny.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
And he sent this link and it's adorable.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
He says, this new game is coming to the Wii.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:57.000
And so this box comes up with nine little holes in it.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:00.000
And then little kitties come out of the holes.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Get bonked.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Oh my god, send that to me Rob.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:06.000
It's so adorable.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:07.000
It's in our chat.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Are you in chat?

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:09.000
I'm in chat.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
SSJ100Matt just posted this.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:12.000
It's adorable.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
And so this makes for terrible radios.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
This is awful, terrible, horrible radio.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:17.000
I'll put it on Facebook.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Yeah, let's put it on Facebook.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:20.000
Alright.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Can I get to Twitter topics already?

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Alright.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Follow us, ask us questions, we answer, da da da.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:31.000
DarkTattooia wants us to plug Retro Review.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Oh no, he says he's planning one.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
I don't think I saw it posted yet.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:38.000
But DarkTattooia does a lot of great work for the site, so thanks very much.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Let's see, Sturlok wants to give a shameless plug.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Is this turning into the shameless plug segment?

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:44.000
I think it is.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Actually, I really like this article though, so I am going to let him have his shameless plug.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:50.000
He wrote an article for Geek-Life.com.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:51.000
That's us.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Geek Life.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:55.000
It's like all the O-L-R people are suddenly moving over there.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.000
You're defecting.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.000
No, that's okay.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.000
He actually made this story and I just linked it there in chat.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:01.000
It's GeekLife.com.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
It's called The Blind Gamer Perspective.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:08.000
Because Sturlok is actually a blind gamer and you might think, like, how is that even possible?

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
You can't see the sprites on the screen.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:17.000
But he actually explains it and talks about audio cues and how helpful it is when you have a role-playing game

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
that tells you when you're running into walls.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Like, makes that bonk, bonk, bonk sound.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Like, you know, like some of the old Final Fantasy games do.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:26.000
I thought it was a neat article, so I approve.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Two thumbs up.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Tigerclaw gives us some links and one of them is kind of, well, they're both kind of sad, actually.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Let me read this first one here.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Starcraft 2 cost a hundred million to make.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Wow.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
That apparently is according to the Wall Street Journal.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:48.000
Activision Blizzard spent a hundred million dollars on the three-part sequel.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Where did all that money go?

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Oh, my God.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.000
I guess this game's going to be epic beyond epic.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.000
Purely development and that has nothing to do with marketing.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:04.000
It exceeds Gran Turismo 5's 60 million development cost.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
They'll make it all bad.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
That's the sick part.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
Let's see, also from Tigerclaw.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Killer gets two life sentences in an Xbox motivated murder.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:18.000
I hate stories like these because usually they have nothing, I mean, no offense to Tigerclaw

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
because he's pulling it from a game blog.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:27.000
But I just, I hate that this stuff gets tied to gaming at all because it's just that this guy's just sick.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Some sicko killed people and it somehow involved an Xbox.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:39.000
His name is Kyle Sebastian Scott, 19 years old, and he killed a 22-year-old in January of last year.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:46.000
He hit his body in a ravine near a hiking trail in Colorado Springs.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Apparently he wanted the guy's Xbox and killed the guy.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Oh, this is even better.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Jason Holly, the victim, 22 years old, developmentally disabled.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Terrible.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:01.000
And the judge said he trusted you, he would have given you anything, and he did.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:05.000
You could have taken the Xbox and he would have never told anybody.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
He was trying to be normal, a buddy, or one of the guys.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Two life sentences.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Not enough. Not enough.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Spazinator's sending us an update.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:17.000
Remember he called in last week to talk about his Sony woes?

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Update, update.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Sony Computer Entertainment of America finally gave back my remaining 55 videos this past Monday.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Woo, that's a lot.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Still rather pissed that it took so damn long.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:32.000
They actually called me as they were doing it so I could confirm if they had everything.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:35.000
Well, that's kind of nice, I guess. At least they did that.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Jay Jugo on Twitter is listening to some old episodes of OLR. I guess this is a never forget kind of moment.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Hey guys, here's a funny flashback.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Procrastination is like masturbation.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:50.000
It feels good until you realize you fucked yourself.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
Irene said that quote on your sixth episode.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Just wanted to share that flashback moment with you guys.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
Keep up the great work.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
Nice.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Old school OLR. They do exist out there.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
They're out there if you know where to look.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:05.000
The pictures are now finally on the website.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Apparently, well, my initial email bounced because apparently there's too many pictures attached.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
So now I'm sending them two at a time.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:18.000
So remember folks, if you're going to upload pictures to the website, do so in small quantities.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Because the email may not be able to handle it.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:24.000
But now you can see pictures of Baby Room and they're right there in the header of OrangetownsRudy.com.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Yes, they are up on top. In fact, I'm just waiting for the last two to refresh on here.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Take a look.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
And they're awesome.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:37.000
Actually, if you look at the gallery, you can see my progress of last week, which was not much progress.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:46.000
Dark Tetsuya says, anyone be interested in an OLR game in the same style of the Journey coin-op?

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
I've been wanting to do that for quite some time.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:51.000
That would be awesome if you could actually do it.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:54.000
That is no small programming feat.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
That would be cool.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Yes, of course. I'd love that.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
The Journey arcade game is rad.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:03.000
It's a classic game of the week now. It's official.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:08.000
And lastly, Retertainment. What nerd thing makes you think of an old TV show?

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:13.000
Mine is the red-green show after the duct tape iPhone 4 fix.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
That's a tough question.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
What nerd thing makes you think of an old TV show?

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
I brought up Mr. Wizard yesterday.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
Why did I bring up Mr. Wizard?

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Because somebody then tried to say Mr. Wizard hated...

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:24.000
That was me.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:29.000
What did I say in response to Mr. Wizard? I don't know.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:32.000
You said you thought he was dead.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
He is dead, isn't he?

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:35.000
I don't know.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:38.000
I don't know. Forget it.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Mr. Wizard never really dies.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:44.000
You see, he's figured out a way to become one with the Force.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
He's just going to disappear into a robe.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Well, I just thought about Finders Keepers, thinking about the Xbox store earlier.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
So I guess it does happen once in a while when I think of old TV shows.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Is there something nerdy that makes you think of an old TV show?

02:01:55.000 --> 02:02:01.000
The status of the gaming industry and the show Bonkers.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:05.000
I think that's pretty close there.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:08.000
A coworker said this to me the other day, and I like this.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.000
This really has nothing to do with gaming or nerd.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:18.000
But she said, you know, sometimes my life here feels like the dinosaurs TV show and that little baby.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:21.000
Not the mama. Not the mama.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
I don't know. It's funny to me.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
That is pretty funny, Rob.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:28.000
Anything you want to add, Dark Soccer?

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Well, I don't know. Usually I think about my job and all I can think about is...

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:39.000
What was that?

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Running Man.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Blade Runner?

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
No, Running Man.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:51.000
One where he's trapped in a game show and to get out he has to escape.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Richard Dawson was the villain. That was awesome.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Yes, now I know.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
The best part about that movie.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Alright. Let's move on with some more news. Back to gaming news.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:08.000
That's almost as cool as Mega Race with Don Knotts or something I think was the villain in that.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.000
Don Knotts was not in that, was he?

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:15.000
There was somebody who was like Don Knotts in that game.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
In that game?

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:20.000
It was weird. No, Don Knotts was not in the Running Man.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:26.000
That would have been even more epic. Don Knotts should have been one of the killers in the Running Man.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
That would have been cool.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:34.000
Tigerclaw, by the way, says Mr. Wizard died in 2007. Don Herbert. Just so you know.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:35.000
In case you weren't aware, Mr. Wizard...

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:36.000
And he hated kids.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
He did not hate kids.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Yes, he did.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:43.000
He loved kids as much as Mel Gibson loved his wife and daughter.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:46.000
Alright, back to news stories.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:49.000
Don't get me started. He's an ass-wife.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Don't even. Just pull back. Move along. Nothing to see here.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
That name is banned from the show.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
Move along. Nothing to see here.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Low-key, back to gaming.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:06.000
Mega Man Universe is apparently a game that's coming out on the Playstation Network and Xbox Live Arcade.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:11.000
They had a little teaser trailer that came out this week that featured absolutely no gameplay whatsoever.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:15.000
But it kind of gave us an idea of what we may expect.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:26.000
Apparently, the game will actually combine universes in different Capcom game universes.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:37.000
The teaser trailer showed, at one point, a stop-motion animation of Ryu, Arthur, from the Ghosts and...

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:41.000
I'm saying it the Western way, okay? The improper way.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
You're wrong!

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:50.000
Fine. Ryu and Arthur from the Ghosts and Ghouls and Ghosts and Goblins series.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
And, of course, Mega Man.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Facing off against a bunch of Mega Man villains.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:06.000
So either I'm guessing that Mega Man's going to get powers from these other players or the other game heroes.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Or he's going to be teaming up, I guess, with...

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Kind of think of the Super Mario crossover, but the Super Capcom crossover with all these different characters from different series facing off against Mega Man characters.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:26.000
Or, perhaps, facing off against Capcom universe characters.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:31.000
Although, then you would wonder why it's called Mega Man universe and not Capcom universe.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:35.000
Can I play this trailer? Because I haven't even seen this yet.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:38.000
I've been waiting until tonight's show to watch this.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
This is only about a minute or two, right?

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:41.000
It's short.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Okay, so I've got to go into the studio right now.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Capcom! Yay, Capcom!

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:51.000
Bored down. Here we go.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:54.000
Ooh, I approve of the music.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:59.000
Why is, like, some kid sleeping? That has nothing to do with Mega Man.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:03.000
It's Toy Story Mega Man.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
Bored down.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Oh, it's 20XX.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:21.000
Man, there's something else I forgot at the very end that's kind of cool.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:24.000
Cut man.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:29.000
I'm turning this down a little bit so I can talk for it.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Well, it looks cool. Too bad this is all, like, a pre-rendered thing that the actual game's not going to look like.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:37.000
It looks like stop-motion animation.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:40.000
Sweet!

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:49.000
What?

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:54.000
That little kid's probably on drugs.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:57.000
This is going to be, you know what this looks like to me?

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
Can I tell you what this honestly, like, I think right now?

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:03.000
No, it looks like the Mega Man fighting game.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:08.000
But it's going to be like Capcom's own version of Capcom vs. Capcom.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:13.000
If that makes any sense. That's the first impression I get of what this is.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:24.000
Wait a minute.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:25.000
He's also quite, like...

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:29.000
Watch this, this is awesome.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Okay.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:36.000
So he's still in bed. Mega Man universe.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Your world. Mega-fide.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:52.000
That's great.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
That was the old Mega Man box art guy?

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Yeah.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:58.000
They're going to have the Mega Man box art Mega Man.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:59.000
I don't get it!

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Suck man.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:07.000
I don't get it. I felt like that was a waste of two minutes of show.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
Welcome to any two minutes of this show.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
I don't know. Alpha-Can-Anagram, you asked me a question.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
Why are they fighting only Mega Man bad guys, though?

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
I don't know. I have no idea.

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:16.000
It doesn't...

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:21.000
I seriously think it's like one of those, like the Nintendo, the Super Mario crossover.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:22.000
It's going to be like that.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
Why can't we just have Rockman power battles?

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Just do a new one of those.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
Because that wasn't very good.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
I liked it.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:31.000
It's like one of the few games...

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:34.000
The arcade version of it. That was so cool.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:35.000
Alright.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:38.000
You just need to do a game just storing bass.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:44.000
What they need to do is they need to do a Mega Man game that's very similar to the upcoming Castlevania game.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:50.000
You know, with like 16 players at the same time fighting Mega Man characters.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Alpha-Can-Anagram says,

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Sky, imagine possibly Mega Man mixed with LittleBigPlanet with Mega Man powered up level editor.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Well, that sounds awesome, but I don't think that's what this is.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
If it is though, hey, it might be fun.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:02.000
Actually, it might be a lot of fun.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
Is this only supposed to be download though?

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Like it's a live arcade in PlayStation 3?

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
Live arcade in PlayStation Network, yeah.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:08.000
Alright.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Let's move on with some more stories.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:13.000
And this is something about something the Xbox is losing.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Microsoft cancelled 1 versus 100.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:16.000
That's right.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
There's not going to be a third season of 1 versus 100.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:21.000
This is confirmed with Xbox...

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:25.000
Sorry, Microsoft Game Studios General Manager Dave McCarthy saying,

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:32.000
quote, we're very proud of the 1 versus 100 team and their accomplishments and are excited to apply what we've learned to future programming.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
And yep, it's on the Xbox.com.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
A fond farewell.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:37.000
That's it.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Aw, that sucks.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:43.000
They're going to have Mega Man foam Mega Busters or whatever at Comic Con they're giving away.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Do you not even care?

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
The 1 versus 100 is gone?

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:47.000
No, I don't care.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:48.000
All you can think about is Mega Man?

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Ugh.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Never forget, there is something funny, Xbox Live Prime Time, whatever the fuck happened to that.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
Well, that's my point.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
That stuff sounded so exciting.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:03.000
Hey, we're going to have the service that's going to blow away all the competition.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
And we're going to cancel it.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:11.000
It's going to make your Xbox Live Gold Account more worthwhile than just paying to play against other people.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:14.000
But it came down to where they couldn't get advertisers.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:18.000
Yeah, that's the buzz I'm hearing too is that it was always a Sprint commercial.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
In a while you might see another one, but that was mostly it.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:23.000
So they just couldn't get the advertisers to give away the prizes.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:24.000
But you know what, I think there would be...

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Call me crazy.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:30.000
But I think there would be a lot of people that would still play the game, not even for prizes.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:35.000
I mean, when you went into the non-live rounds, which didn't give away anything but points really,

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:38.000
and supposedly more of a chance to play in the live rounds,

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:42.000
there would still be like 10-20,000 people on at any time.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:45.000
I mean, you can't tell me that stuff is that expensive to run.

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:46.000
Really?

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
I mean, I guess they have a question writing staff.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:52.000
And why can't you get advertisers? I see advertisers for stuff all the time.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Like, there's different movies that they're promoting on there.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
There's different stuff.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Where's Axe Body Spray?

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Just do a crossover. Get the Old Spice guy in there.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Mountain Dew.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Old Spice is very up on the new technology stuff. Get him in there.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
That last marketing campaign was brilliant.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
Brilliant. Who doesn't love that guy?

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:13.000
My favorite thing, I'm on a horse.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Did you see all the YouTube videos?

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:15.000
I didn't see the new ones, yeah.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
Oh, you got to see the marriage proposal. That's the best one.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
Monty Boggs in our chat room says,

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:22.000
Microsoft always promises cool stuff to live and then never does it

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
when they realize it requires work.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:32.000
You know, it's just disappointing because they didn't really announce what is next.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:35.000
I think that would soften the blow a little bit if they were like,

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:38.000
well, sadly we're losing 1 versus 100 because, you know, licensing,

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:41.000
they're going to make it a real show again, which by the way is also a rumor

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:44.000
that 1 versus 100 is actually coming back to TV

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
because of the success of Xbox.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
Weird, right?

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
I know, right? I don't think it'll be the same thing.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
It's not going to be Bob Saget and NBC.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
I'm thinking like Game Show Network.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:57.000
I actually, I read blogs about game shows. Leave me alone.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Hey, Rob, that's one of the reasons we love you.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
I know.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.000
I just, I don't know.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:06.000
But if they'd come out and said, okay, we're canceling 1 versus 100,

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:10.000
but we are bringing you, I don't know, The Price is Right

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:15.000
or Family Feud or hell, Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy, anything.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
I can play The Price is Right.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
People would be excited about that.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
And I don't even think you have to give away prizes.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:24.000
Give away E-peen and people will still line up.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:28.000
Give away achievements. Give away shout-outs on websites, leaderboards.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
People will play for E-peen.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Here's the opportunity now.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:36.000
Make something very similar to, say, PlayStation Home

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
and you can have the prizes in your living room.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
Hey, look at this virtual.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Oh, my God, why aren't you working for Microsoft?

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
That's brilliant.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Brilliant.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:51.000
Win avatar items and themes and cool stuff.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
You could do it.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:56.000
You don't have to give away a free game or points.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:59.000
I want a free game and points and a car.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
Well, I mean, you know, that's nice.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Maybe give that away to, like, the season-long winner

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:07.000
and it won't cost as much out of the prize budget.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:10.000
AJ Mix in our chat room. Double Dare featuring Natal.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Why aren't you people working for Microsoft?

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:15.000
These are brilliant ideas. Brilliant.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Won't happen.

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:22.000
I don't know. Here's a thought. Make up your own game show.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:26.000
You know, get somebody out there who's got to be creating these game shows.

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:29.000
Hire him. Make your own damn game show.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Make a new Xbox Live game show.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Yeah, I'd love that idea.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:38.000
You could maybe even, like, broadcast some stuff on MSNBC or something.

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
Or, you know, one of the companies that you own.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Fucking stream it on the internet. Have, like, uh...

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Have something. I don't know.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
I love this. Monty Boggs.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
Are you smarter than a fifth grader?

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:53.000
Were all the little kids in Halo are the fifth graders?

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:57.000
You know, there is a fifth grader game on Xbox Live.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Are you smarter than a fifth grader?

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
It's on all the systems, I think.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
But it's not, you know, interactive.

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:06.000
I was really excited about Xbox Prime Time.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
And it's really disappointing that it's just like,

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Eh, well, you know, it didn't work. Bye.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
So I really hope they come out and say,

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Yes, we've been working on another project and it's still part of Xbox Prime Time.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:22.000
But it makes me nervous when they come out at E3 and don't say a damn thing about it.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
That should have been the sign right there.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
They didn't say a damn thing about it at E3.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
It wasn't like, Oh, you hope you liked 1 vs. 100.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:31.000
Or, you know, but now we're going to bring you Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune!

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
Or something like that.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:37.000
Well, you know, Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune! games were being shown off on the Wii.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Somewhere else.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:42.000
Yep, I know there's Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune! games coming up this year.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:45.000
Actually, the Wii's been getting a lot of those game shows.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
They have The Price is Right and Press Your Luck.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
The Wii's the place for game shows right now.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
It's not live and interactive.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:54.000
Oh my god, think of the possibilities.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
Rob, don't cry.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
I'm just...

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
It's just...

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
What the fuck are they smoking?

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
I don't know.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:08.000
You can buy PlayStation Plus and maybe you'll get to pay somebody else to watch Hulu.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
What's it going to...

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
They don't make any sense.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
They do not.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
When are the good ideas going to stick?

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
They just couldn't make money off of 1 vs. 100.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:22.000
They weren't making enough in advertising to just buy PlayStation Plus.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
I bet they could have charged...

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Well, they're making the money off Xbox Gold.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:30.000
They're making the money off Xbox Gold, subscribers.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
There's other ways they could do it.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:37.000
I don't believe the subscribers were giving them that much money.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
It's about selling.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
I know people who bought it at Xbox just to play that game.

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
They've got to be pissed.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
They make the money back in other ways.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
It's dumb. Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Yeah, but that's a different reason to buy an Xbox, too, if you ask me.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:53.000
Yeah, but that's a different reason to buy an Xbox, too, if you ask me.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
So she just pops in chat and says,

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:59.000
Rob wants a Big Brother port for Wii with a throttle-that-bitch Wiimote mechanic.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:05.000
I would totally play Survivor on Xbox Live if it was, like, somehow real.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
What?

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
There's a Survivor game coming out on the Wii.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
It's going to be stupid.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
It's not going to be online or anything.

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
It's going to be like the horrible PC games that were out.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
At least the PC games.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
I think one of the PC games you could actually play on the internet.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:22.000
Probably it's going to be a port of the PC game.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Dumb, dumb, dumb.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Well, the last PC game came out a long time ago.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Yeah, that'll probably be a port of the PC game.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
Alright, let's move on.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:33.000
That's frightening.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Moving on, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Well, there is some stuff.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:45.000
As soon as my, you know, system decides to stop being crappy.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:49.000
I was also, you know, completely enamored with the whack-a-kitty.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:53.000
Thank you, SSJ100Matt, for completely derailing the show.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
We appreciate you.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
With your cute kittens.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
No, because my thing-okay, there it is.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:04.000
I'm sorry. Well, actually, what was going on was that my window decided to hide itself.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:05.000
Yay.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:08.000
And my brain is broken. Doesn't work.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Anyway, how about some news about poor, poor Nintendo?

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
Can we have some sad music, Rob?

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Some sad music?

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Well, you didn't request this in advance.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
Well, how about just break out a kazoo?

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
Hold on, hold on.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:32.000
It's because I feel for them.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Sad music, you got it. Here we go.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
Some sad music for Jamie's story.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Sigh.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:46.000
There's an announcement made by the Nintendo UK General Manager.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
His name is David Yarnton.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:54.000
That demand for the Wii and the DS has declined.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:18:06.000
He blamed the falling demand for the Wii and DS on the, quote, cycle.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:10.000
And the recession in saying everybody's in the same boat.

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:14.000
We are not recession proof, he says.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:18.000
We've probably, as an industry, been better than other industries.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:23.000
We thought we would be selling more, but we're not, pretty much.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:29.000
Um, yeah, that's really not the case of worlds in the world so much.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:32.000
But there's light, Rob, there's light at the end of the tunnel.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:35.000
We're waiting on the 3DS.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
That's what they're saying.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
We had to let that go.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:52.000
Yeah, they're waiting on the 3DS because you don't need glasses.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:57.000
Um, and he also, though, denied that Nintendo has been forced to slash prices.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
But, um, yeah.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Alas, Nintendo. Alas.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:15.000
I can't help ending up here drinking ginger ale.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
What?

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:23.000
Just your perfect cap to destroy, alas, Nintendo.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
What is wrong with you?

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:39.000
Salacious pop in our chatroom says, now I'm imagining Reggie in tears floating on a wooden plank saying, never let go, Wii. Never let go.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
And then one of his thumbs break off.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
Uh, yeah.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
Uh, yeah.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
Uh, the kinectix-

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:56.000
No, no, no, no, guys, I got, I got, um, I got some, uh, advice here for Nintendo.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Um, here you go, Nintendo, I have some advice for you, okay?

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Keep holding on, cause you know I'll make it through, I'll make it through. Just stay strong, cause you know I'm here for you, I'm here for you. There's nothing you can say.

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Sorry about that. You just took it too far there. Yeah, I did. You went too far.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:31.000
Yep. Let the, let the-

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Should've just let it. Yeah, should've just left it with that, I know, I know.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:37.000
Sequels are never as good as the original, they're really not.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
I hear that Titanic 2's gonna be awesome, though.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Um, kinectix-

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:45.000
Three more hours of the ship sinking.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:47.000
The ship sinks again.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:52.000
You think it sunk and everyone died. They really went to a magical town under the water.

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:57.000
We found it! It's Titanic Atlantis!

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:05.000
Atlantastic? Oh, I can do it.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:21.000
Um, anyways, uh, the kinectix experience tour, coming to your town soon, um, they are traveling around the country, um, on the east coast and on the west coast, showing off a bunch of different kinect games including kinectimals, kinect sports, kinect joyride, kinect adventures,

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:25.000
and Dance Central, the only game without kinect in the title.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:33.000
And, um, they will be doing this, um, very close until launch of the actual kinect on November 4th.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:45.000
So, some notable east coast, uh, locations, let's see, um, actually starting earlier of this, or, well, uh, yesterday and today, they were at Macy's!

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:50.000
You probably didn't see them because they were at Macy's, so, but if you-

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
I like Macy's!

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:55.000
If you just happened to go there, then you might have seen it.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:22:03.000
Um, some other notable places, uh, August 4th through the 6th, they're going to be in Canton, Ohio at the Football Hall of Fame Rib Burn-Off.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:08.000
Okay, well that makes sense, Football Hall of Fame, okay, that seems to be a good place to go, alright.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Okay, um, let's see, October, was it, uh, October 1st and 2nd, Orlando, Florida, the Disney Wine and Dine Marathon.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Disney has a wine and dine marathon? Is that like the wine thing they do at California Adventure?

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:37.000
No, I think that's, like, remember how Disney in, um, Orlando has a lot of those fancy adult places where you can go taste wine in fancy restaurants and shit like that?

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:38.000
Okay.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:45.000
Yeah, there. Um, and then October 4th, 14th and the 17th, or through the 17th, uh, you can check it out at the Texas State Fair.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Or, October 21st through the 24th at the Louisiana State Fair.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:53.000
Uh, what other state fairs are they going to be hitting up as well?

02:22:53.000 --> 02:23:00.000
Uh, Minnesota State Fair, Tennessee State Fair, uh, I know the California State Fair.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:05.000
Oh, my, I was going to say, really, because I'm like, the California State Fair is going on right now here in lovely Sacramento.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:06.000
Are they going to be there, really?

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:11.000
Yes, July 28th through August 1st at the California State Fair. Almost worth going.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Almost. Almost worth going and getting subjected to getting shot by a gang. Almost.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:20.000
Uh, also.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:28.000
There's two things you can count on at the California State Fair. The smell of animal poop and gang shootings. Every year.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:37.000
You know, this is a surprise to me, but I never knew that Minnesota was on the west coast, but apparently they're going to be at the Mall of America from July 15th to August 22nd.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:41.000
That's a pretty long-ass time there. So, Mall of America, that's your place to go.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:45.000
You'd think they'd have the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:58.000
Exactly. Um, what other state fair? Colorado State Fair, Utah State Fair, New Mexico State Fair. They're going to be at the Universal City Walk on September 24th through 26th.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:05.000
And, uh, October 7th through the 11th, San Francisco Fleet Week.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:10.000
And, uh, oh, the Arizona State Fair.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:20.000
So, yes, a bunch of different dates. They have it, actually. Um, you can check it out on, um, Facebook. Facebook.com slash connect or the Gamerscore blog.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Uh, they've got the dates posted there as well, or a lot of the gaming sites, too, in case you're interested in checking it out.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:33.000
I might be interested in checking out the state fair, but, my God, it's a state fair and I have to go there and it's hot outside.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:34.000
It's hot.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:35.000
It's so hot.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:36.000
It is. It's hot.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:39.000
And, seriously, the state fair sucks.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:44.000
Slacious Pop in chat is asking me, can we go this weekend and get deep fried foods and ride on Spin-A-Hurl rides?

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:49.000
And I'm like, honestly, my first reaction is like, no.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:53.000
No, we can't. I don't know. I, the state fair is okay.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:25:00.000
It might be neat to check out, but, honestly, um, Dance Central will be the only game I might be kind of interested in checking out, but.

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:05.000
How, how would you go? There's no way in hell you're going to be able to take the wife to the state fair. It's way too hot out.

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
I'll just convince the coworkers to go.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Oh, okay.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:09.000
That's where I'd go myself.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
I'll go with you, I guess.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
I'm not going, dude. Okay, let me put it this way.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:16.000
Let's break this down here. July 28th through August 1st.

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:21.000
There is a good percentage chance that the baby will be here by then.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:22.000
I will not be going anywhere.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
You're going to be too busy changing poopy diapers.

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:29.000
Jamie, save a Vicodin and then take it and we'll go.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:32.000
If you pay for me to get in, I'll go.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:33.000
Maybe.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:34.000
Okay.

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:37.000
Do we still have OLR funds? Maybe the show can pay for us.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:40.000
Um, yeah, it's sitting right there on top of.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
We're on assignment. Alright, fine.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:43.000
Rob.

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:48.000
What? And apparently Alan wants to go, so we could maybe do it next weekend. I can't go this weekend.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
Well, next weekend I've got plans on Sunday.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:53.000
But Saturday, Saturday afternoon, I don't.

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
July 28th through the August 1st.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:56.000
Is next weekend, right?

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
We need to go on August 1st. You know why?

02:25:58.000 --> 02:25:59.000
Why?

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Because that's the last day of the fair and it's weird Al.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:08.000
Uh, that's, it's, it's a week from next week from this upcoming weekend.

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
So August 1st is what, a Sunday?

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:11.000
It would be.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:12.000
We have a show that night.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:13.000
Uh, yeah, Sunday.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:14.000
We have a show that night.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
Well, it's the 28th though, that's like.

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:19.000
A show live from the state fair, is it possible?

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:20.000
Maybe.

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:21.000
No.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:22.000
I don't think it is.

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
We can just record, ring the, I found the little recorder.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:27.000
It's like, it's state fair, it's hot.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Look, there's a lot of things that I would call off a show for.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
I've called off a show to go to Disneyland.

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:37.000
I've called off a show to go to various expos.

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:40.000
I would not call off a show to go to the freaking state fair.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Like, I just, it's just.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
It's just too tacky.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:47.000
I've gone to, um, what was it?

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:51.000
It was a, I don't remember what the fair was.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:58.000
It was some sort of like rib cook-off and like country music fair thing that was down

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:02.000
by a Rayleigh Field to see rock band two.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:03.000
And I did that one time.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:06.000
I saw rock band at the state fair actually a couple of years ago.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:07.000
Yeah.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Yeah.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:13.000
Was that, that was the same night that I broke up with that asshole.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
That was the same night.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
Oh my God.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Wow, this show took a tumble.

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
Where's sad trombone?

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Hey, next story.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:33.000
Something a lot happier than horrible experiences at the state fair.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
I saw a guy land on his head.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Hopefully, hopefully this won't be the same experience.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:39.000
A haunted house.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:43.000
This is an old ass Atari 2600 game.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:47.000
An old ass Atari 2600 game that was out many years ago.

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
It's actually out on game room now if you want to re-experience it.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:52.000
They call it the original survival horror game.

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:53.000
Not really.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:54.000
No.

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:55.000
No.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:59.000
Basically you like could hit a button and make things illuminate around you and sometimes

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:02.000
scary things would show up like spiders and stuff.

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
But you were trying to collect things.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:09.000
Well, they are completely revamping this game and it's coming out for the Wii, Xbox Live

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
Arcade and PC.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:16.000
It's being developed by Imagine Engine who's a kids game designer.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:20.000
And it's actually about the original character's grandkids going back to the haunted house

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
and it's basically kind of a very similar plot.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:26.000
And I got to admit, looking at the graphics it looks very kid-ish.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:33.000
But I guess it's kind of cool that they're bringing out the old games and making new ones.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:38.000
I hope there's some other old ass Atari games that they maybe do this to.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:39.000
But I don't know.

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
Maybe this is one of those games you might fire up once and go,

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:42.000
Oh, that's cute.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:43.000
And then probably never play again.

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
Uh, they're actually...

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
Are there other ones they're talking about?

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:48.000
There's supposed to be other ones.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:51.000
I thought I had heard something about that there were other games they were thinking about.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
Centipede.

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:54.000
Really?

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:55.000
Yeah, I saw a game for Centipede.

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:56.000
I'm like, really?

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:57.000
Hmm.

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:58.000
What the hell are they going to do with Centipede?

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
I think this is not Frogger.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:01.000
Human Centipede?

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:04.000
No, it's not Human Centipede.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:05.000
Um, there was another one too.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
I don't remember what it was.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:11.000
But Centipede was one of the games.

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:15.000
It was also leaked out on Gamefly.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:16.000
They had it.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Because everyone trusts Gamefly over me.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:21.000
Sad days.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:27.000
Alright, I think we need to move on with our show and get into the mailbag.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:37.000
Every week you guys send us emails and we read them here on the program to our much amusement.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com and we're going to answer your questions that you've emailed us.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Sometimes you guys share funny stories and things of that sort.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
So, let's get to it.

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:49.000
Dark Soccer is going to read some emails.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:54.000
Um, we've got three to go through and I'm going to start with the shortest of them first.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:58.000
Well, kind of the second shortest but the other one's got some stuff.

02:29:58.000 --> 02:29:59.000
Hey, OLR!

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
Pliskin here to ask a few questions.

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:06.000
First, if you could be in any video game, which would it be and why?

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:13.000
Um, if I had to, I'd be in Sims 3 so that I could have an infinity code so that I'd never get hungry.

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
Um, I could never age.

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:16.000
Never.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:22.000
And I could decide how hot the person I want to look like and everything.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:31.000
I would be in Animal Crossing so I could get rewarded with refrigerators and dressers and radios for running people's mail to the post office.

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
Loki.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:40.000
Um, I don't know.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
I wouldn't really want to be in any game.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:45.000
Mega Man Universe because that looks retarded.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
I don't know. I don't have a good answer.

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:48.000
I'd also want to be-

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:51.000
I know, Totem Ball because it is such an awesome game.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
But you were in Totem Ball!

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:58.000
Oh my god! Mind blown!

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Second, I know you guys bash-

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Wait, wait, wait. I'd also want to be in Pokemon.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:03.000
Just saying.

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Okay.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
Score it all. Score it all.

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:15.000
Second, I know you guys bash on Facebook Gaming, but believe it or not, there are some fun games on Facebook like My Hero's Ability and thousands of poker games.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:16.000
So my question is what gives?

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:20.000
As in, maybe you're into those games, but I don't think we are.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:23.000
I don't hate all Facebook games. Jamie, you admitted to playing one.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:29.000
I played Farmville for like a week, okay? A moment of weakness. It was dumb. I was young and naive.

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
I think I played Bejeweled Blitz once.

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:32.000
Yeah, Bejeweled Blitz is cool.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:40.000
Um, I don't hate on Facebook games a lot. I mean, I think the whole social networking gaming thing is kind of retarded.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
And that's kind of stupid. It sounds like an old man saying,

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:52.000
Oh, get your fancy electronic shit. Um, but no, it's really, I don't understand what the point is. Like, hey, look, you know, hey, I sent you unicorn. Send me something.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:58.000
I hate it when people send me shit in Facebook. I delete it. I do not forward anything.

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:05.000
I think that's it. It's not Facebook games we hate. It's Facebook games spam that we hate.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:09.000
I'm all for free games. I just don't like the spam.

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:18.000
Yeah, that's annoying. Um, it's like those seriously, those chain mails where it's like, oh, send it to five of your friends and lucky things will happen to you.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:26.000
Um, so I don't hate that. Oh, God, I had a point, but I totally forgot it was in arguing about how Facebook games are.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:38.000
Um, oh, what was it? Oh, my hero's ability. Um, or whatever. That reminds me of like that Stephen Lynch song, Superhero, where he starts like naming off, you know, superheroes.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
It kind of sounds like Pokemon.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:46.000
Um, Monty Boggs, by the way, is also answering that question about what video game would you want to be in in our chat room at chat.orangehonstray.com.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:52.000
I would want to be in Deal or No Deal. Constant money. There's a Deal or No Deal Facebook game.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:56.000
I think that's the most pointless freaking game in the entire world.

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
I think they're all relatively pointless.

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:03.000
Guess the number, but like Deal or No Deal, especially. Guess the number. That's what it is.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:06.000
But Rob, it's Howie Mandel. How can you go wrong there?

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
Don't get me started.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:09.000
It's Howie.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:10.000
Is there more to the email?

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
Yes, there is.

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
Yes, all right.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
Stupid, stupid Facebook.

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:19.000
I am looking forward very much to the Civilization game on Facebook.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
Because you're a Sith whore.

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:22.000
I am.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:23.000
And how.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:26.000
And how, and I can't wait to Sith whore it up with my friends on Facebook. Yay!

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:27.000
More!

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
Third is for Loki.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:33.000
You know, I'm trying really not to be so grammar crazy and eh.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
But.

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:36.000
This sucks.

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
Third is for Loki.

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
I found a PSP 1000.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
I've owned a PSP 1000 for almost a year.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:45.000
And now all of a sudden the D-Pad is freaking out.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:49.000
All I want to do is go right dot dot dot.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:50.000
I used an ellipse okay.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
All by itself.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:57.000
Now this wouldn't bother me, but it gives me vertigo when playing Dissidia Final Fantasy.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:00.000
Cause the D-Pad controls the camera.

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:05.000
My question is can this be fixed or do I have to shell out money to be a new one?

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
To be a new one.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:08.000
You want to be a D-Pad when you grow up.

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
Well we know what video game he wants to be in.

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:11.000
Um.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:12.000
Yeah it can be fixed.

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:16.000
Because the D-Pad is actually on what they call a ribbon bus cable.

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
Which you cannot solder to unfortunately.

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:19.000
I've tried.

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:20.000
And it breaks it.

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:21.000
Um.

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:24.000
But all you have to do is buy the replacement ribbon bus cable.

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
Assuming that that's what's wrong with it.

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:31.000
So probably there's like a kink or something where something broke and so now it's just being held down.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:32.000
It could be dirty.

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:33.000
You never know.

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:34.000
Um.

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
Basically you just have to bust the system open.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:37.000
Um.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
And possibly replace that.

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:40.000
Which those aren't that expensive.

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:43.000
You can probably get a set of ribbon bus cables for.

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:47.000
I think I bought one for ten to twenty dollars.

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:48.000
Maybe.

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:49.000
It should be really cheap.

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
Probably under fifteen dollars.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:52.000
Um.

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:56.000
So that's all you need to do and you just slide it in there and put it all back together.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
And it should work.

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:01.000
No guarantees though because I don't know if that's exactly what's wrong.

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:02.000
It could also be.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:03.000
Um.

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:06.000
There could be some sort of bridging going on somewhere else in there.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:07.000
Um.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:11.000
It's hard to say until you bust it open and see what actually is broken in there.

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:12.000
But.

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:13.000
If it's.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
If it's the actual D-Pad sticking.

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Like the controller button is actually sticking down.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
It's probably dirty and you just need to clean it out.

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:26.000
I've seen some friends with PSP's that I've fixed for them that are fucking disgusting.

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:29.000
There's just the amount of dirt and grime that's on it.

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:30.000
I just like.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:31.000
What do you do?

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
Do you like seriously sweat grease?

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:36.000
I mean or sweat like.

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:37.000
Axle grease or something.

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
It's ridiculous the amount of dirt that's on there.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:40.000
But yeah.

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:41.000
Cleaning.

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:42.000
Cleaning your PSP.

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:43.000
Try that at first.

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:46.000
If that still doesn't work then you may need to replace that ribbon bus cable.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:49.000
If that doesn't work you're probably going to need a PSP.

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:50.000
Um.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:53.000
I kind of agree with Legend of Zaku in our chat room.

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:56.000
PSP's D-Pad in general is ass.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
They're better than the.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:35:59.000
Um.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:00.000
You know.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
They're better than the Xbox 360 D-Pad.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:03.000
Exactly.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:04.000
That's for sure.

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:05.000
Alright.

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:09.000
You guys are being mean to the poor Xbox.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:10.000
What else is new tonight?

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:11.000
Alright.

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
Was that it for that email or is there more?

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Um.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:15.000
Final question is for Rob.

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:18.000
How would I go about coming out to my family?

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:19.000
Wow.

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:20.000
Uh.

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:21.000
Wow.

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:24.000
That's a bit of a tangent.

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:25.000
Um.

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:26.000
I.

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:27.000
Okay.

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:28.000
I'm a big fan of skywriting.

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
I can offer a resource.

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:31.000
Yes.

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:32.000
Please.

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:33.000
Um.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:34.000
The um.

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:35.000
Human rights.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:36.000
Um.

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:37.000
What's the name of the.

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:38.000
Their equality thing.

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:39.000
The human.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
They've got the store in San Francisco.

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:42.000
Human rights campaign.

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:43.000
Thank you.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:49.000
The human rights campaign has actually brochures and free material up on their website if you

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:54.000
do want to actually have something in writing, you know, by a psychologist and stuff.

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
So they do have resources there.

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:57.000
Uh.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:58.000
Okay.

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:01.000
How do I tackle this question without taking 30 minutes?

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:02.000
Um.

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:03.000
Okay.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:06.000
First off, if you need additional advice, send me a personal email.

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:07.000
Rob at orangehonestrager.com.

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
I'll address this off the air.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Um.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:11.000
Because I really don't know anything about this listener.

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:12.000
I don't know how old you are.

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:13.000
I don't know what you're like.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:16.000
If you have a hostile family situation or what's going on.

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:20.000
Cause I think different situations necessitate different responses.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:21.000
Um.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:25.000
I know there's a lot of push out there that say like, you know, come out, come out wherever

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:26.000
you are and all this stuff.

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:30.000
But I, I completely understand that sometimes that is not necessarily the answer.

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:31.000
Um.

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
At the end of the day, who you have in your bedroom is your business.

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:34.000
Um.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
And I understand your desire to tell your family that.

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:40.000
And I think, you know, if you have that type of family, you should tell them that that's

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:41.000
going to be supportive and loving.

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:42.000
Um.

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
But there are sometimes some, some sticky situations.

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:47.000
So I don't know your family background or what have you.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:54.000
My advice would be tell your best friend because your best friend will always be there for

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:55.000
you no matter what.

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:58.000
And if they run away because you tell them this, then they're not really your friend

02:37:58.000 --> 02:37:59.000
to begin with.

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
And again, I don't know how old this person is.

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:02.000
They could be 15, they could be 30.

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:06.000
If you are younger, if you're still in high school, I honestly don't think there's any

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:10.000
rush because I think a lot of people in high school and even somewhat college kind of go

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:15.000
through that phase where, you know, they're not sure what's going on.

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:18.000
And I don't think there's any rush to label yourself.

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:23.000
But if you are, you know, older, experienced, whatever, and you know this is, this is it,

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:27.000
and this is the way it's going to be, then, um, you know, tell your friend first.

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:30.000
It'll be much easier to tell friend, friends.

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:34.000
And that way, if your family does have a negative reaction, you have some, somebody else you

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:35.000
can turn to.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:36.000
Um.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:39.000
I, I hope that you are fortunate to have a family that is loving and supporting and all

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:40.000
that.

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:45.000
And in most cases it will, but it would be disingenuous of me to sit here and say, just

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:49.000
tell them everything will be fine because in some situations it's not, but you know

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
your family better than I do.

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
So I guess that's really all I can say on that for now.

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:59.000
If you need help, um, contact one of the resources Jamie mentioned or email me directly.

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:00.000
Yeah.

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:01.000
Good job.

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:02.000
I hope.

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:03.000
Yeah.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:04.000
I don't.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:05.000
Yeah.

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:06.000
That's, that's, that's a challenging question.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
I haven't been asked that in the eight years of doing this.

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:14.000
I don't think I've been told by people, you know, which is always a wonderful compliment.

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:19.000
It's an astonishing feeling, you know, like thank you for being, you know, out on the

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:23.000
radio and just, you know, being a guy who likes games, who happens to be gay.

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:26.000
But I don't think I've had that question.

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:27.000
Yeah.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:33.000
But, um, thank you for asking because I think it takes a lot of guts to even type that out.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:36.000
So please email me if you need it.

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:39.000
Um, this one's from Rababa.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:45.000
It says, this is particularly for Jamie and he sends me a link from doitmyself.org of

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:51.000
a TARDIS cake, but it lights up and it's got the inside of the TARDIS through the window,

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
but it's a cake.

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
That is awesome.

02:39:55.000 --> 02:40:00.000
And he concludes his email with, it's probably too involved for most, but it is cool.

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:05.000
I'm going to share the link with our chatters real quick.

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:08.000
I like the TARDIS made of cake.

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:09.000
I would eat that.

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:10.000
Delicious.

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:16.000
I think I just make a cake in the shape of a TARDIS, but I can't bake for crap.

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:19.000
I can't even make pancakes, right Rob?

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
That, that's awful.

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:24.000
Okay, last email.

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
Greetings, OLR.

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:27.000
Rini here.

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:32.000
A few episodes ago, you mentioned having a contingency plan for when Loki needs to care

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
for his newborn bundle of joy.

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:39.000
Although there is always the amusing chance that he may never be gone, I still would like

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:42.000
to suggest a host, a guest host, Scott Rubin.

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:47.000
I'm just listening to the guy, and I think he'd be doing OLR and his All Games fans

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:52.000
a favor by chiming in once with his thoughts on games and gaming news today.

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:56.000
Also, he would make this show run seven hours long and prompt everyone to call in sick due

02:40:56.000 --> 02:41:00.000
to copious, but responsible amounts of drinking, perverted discussions, and not giving a fuck

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
in general.

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
I think I approve of that.

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:08.000
And since Dark Sakura and Sky recently purchased Team Fortress 2, I'd like to make a few

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:12.000
suggestions on classes since Sky isn't so hot with the aiming.

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:15.000
One, learn the maps with Medic.

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:19.000
You can learn where items and paths are while helping your teammates.

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:25.000
Overall, over-heal everyone, but focus on assisting those taking fire, and especially

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:29.000
do not be afraid to turn around and see what's around you.

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:34.000
If you unlock the Uber Saw, feel free to knife Uyghur classes to gain power for your Uber

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:35.000
Charge.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:36.000
Two, try Pyro.

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:40.000
Can I say, I was actually thinking of being a Medic, because I'm always the White Mage

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:41.000
in these games.

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:42.000
Always.

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:43.000
Okay.

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:44.000
Two, try Pyro.

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:48.000
Incredibly helpful with this flamethrower because it can airblast to push enemies in

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:52.000
rockets, grenades, or slash grenades while putting out fires on teammates.

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:57.000
Be sneaky and use hit-and-run tactics to let the afterburn make enemies retreat, or at

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
least hold off them a bit.

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
If they're alone or weak, finish them off.

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:04.000
Always check for spies and never use the backburner.

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
That's capitalized never.

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
And that's capitalized always, by the way.

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
Three, try Engineer.

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:15.000
Build teleporters and dispensers to help teammates and play sentries where they can cover an

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:18.000
important point while being shielded by some part of the level.

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:22.000
Unlock the Wrangler and the Gunslinger to deploy many sentries for offensive play.

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:29.000
Don't forget hitting buildings with your wrench doubles their construction speed, and all

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:32.000
but the many sentries can be upgraded to level three.

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:37.000
If your buildings get sapped by spies, always kill the spy first and then get rid of the

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:38.000
sappers.

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:42.000
Don't forget that your wrench has a higher chance to deal critical hits than most other

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
melee weapons.

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:49.000
I was actually going to try Engineer because I found that they have now where you can move

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:50.000
your sentries around.

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:51.000
Your turrets.

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
Apparently everyone's playing Engineer because of it.

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:54.000
Yeah.

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:55.000
That's what I hear.

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:59.000
For more information and strategies, okay, I have to do the voice.

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
Ready?

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:05.000
For more information and strategies, I direct you to the official TF2 Wiki here.

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:13.000
Http colon slash slash wiki dot Team Fortress dot com slash wiki slash main underscore page.

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
Good luck and don't fail, dammit.

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:18.000
Rini is very excited to have us playing Team Fortress 2.

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:21.000
I've seen it on the Twitter as well.

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:22.000
I actually need to revisit it.

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
I didn't really touch it at all this week.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
Well, I really haven't been able to do much.

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
Well, yeah, you got the hand thing going on, though.

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
Well, we still have to have our game.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:31.000
We shook on it.

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:34.000
So whenever your hand's better, we're going to get on that.

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:37.000
Do you like my announcer voice?

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
I do.

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:42.000
I could do my wacky morning DJ voice, though.

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
Wouldn't that be fun to do an entire episode?

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:48.000
I can do the annoying female co-host voice.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
Maybe for the next April Fool's show.

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
Oh, the Scott thing, too.

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:56.000
I think a lot of the All Games folks miss hearing him on the radio.

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
He certainly had a fun show.

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
He's not on the radio anymore?

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:03.000
Well, he does the Appaday thing now.

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
They're doing the TV thing.

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:09.000
Him and Diane Mizona do a show, which is kind of fun, that's online.

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:14.000
Well, I don't know. I'll hear about these random takeover shows,

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:17.000
but I don't think they're podcasts or anything because I never hear them.

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:20.000
So I don't think he's really doing radio frequently.

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
He's not doing regular radio.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
I'm comfortable in saying that.

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:27.000
It would be awesome to have him on the show, but here's the biggest problem.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:32.000
Having a co-host via Skype anything is going to suck.

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:37.000
And I realize other shows do it, and they do it really well.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:40.000
But you have to remember, we've been spoiled over eight years

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
of being in the same room doing the show,

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:45.000
and I think it's honestly what makes our show different at the end of the day.

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:49.000
And I will tell you, the most fun I've had doing radio with Scott

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:52.000
was when we were in the same room, like the E3 Outpost

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:55.000
and the random times we dropped into All Games Interactive

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:56.000
and some of those things.

02:44:56.000 --> 02:45:01.000
When they had that frat house, practically, in Santa Monica.

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
That place was fantabulous.

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:06.000
That place was fantabulous. It was like a frat house.

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
Good times. Good memories are had by all.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:11.000
And sadly, that place doesn't exist anymore.

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:14.000
If you wanted to drive up to NorCal, though, hell, we'd host him in a heartbeat,

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:18.000
but I think he's probably busy with all his other stuff.

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:21.000
So, again, we don't want to be so quick like,

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
Gosh, Loki!

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:28.000
All we can do is sit here and talk about who's going to replace you for one week.

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:29.000
I don't even care.

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
I know, I know.

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:34.000
It's kind of one of those, we're just going to see who's available that week.

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:35.000
We'll burn that bridge when we get to it.

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:38.000
If we have to pick someone up off Skype, we will,

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
but we have got lots of great people.

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:43.000
I'm sure Alan could come back for a show.

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:44.000
Drew, you know, wants to do it.

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:47.000
It'll be done through an elaborate ceremony featuring roses.

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:50.000
Dan could do it. He's here.

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
That's because he lives here, Rob.

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:55.000
I think the chatters would love it if Extifer would come back for a night.

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:58.000
Maybe Irene. We'll figure something out.

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
You know what?

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:04.000
I really, I really, really, really would like for,

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:08.000
and Dan was actually excited about wanting to be on the show tonight,

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
but the family's leaving town.

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:16.000
But I think that we need to have Dan be a co-host for a night.

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
Well, maybe that'll happen.

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:21.000
I live with the man. He wouldn't let me live it down.

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:22.000
All right.

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
I mean, I love my husband.

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
Let's move on to the next email.

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
That was the email.

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:29.000
Oh, that was it? That was it? All right.

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:33.000
Mailbag. OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us your email in the future.

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:37.000
In the meantime, angst, hatred, boo, hiss, the FUs of the week.

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:58.000
FU to the absolute and utter pain that my hand is in.

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:06.000
Yeah, while I'm healing faster and I've got more range of motion,

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:09.000
it actually hurts worse, if that makes sense,

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
and the little tight stitches.

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:14.000
And I know it's all for a good thing and I'm very happy,

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:20.000
but FU to just being in pain and being tired all the time from it, too.

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
I'm really tired all the time and wanting meat,

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
and I'm not supposed to be eating meat.

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:31.000
So, FU to all that and FU to work stuff I've heard about.

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:36.000
FU to Apple for reasons I think I explained either on Bobby's show

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:37.000
or at the beginning of this show.

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
I can't even remember now. It was all blur.

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:43.000
FU to stress.

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:46.000
I bought a car this week, which is actually awesome and I'm happy,

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:49.000
but now I've got to get rid of the old car and that takes a lot of work.

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
So, yeah.

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
That's it.

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:59.000
FU to one particular person I saw driving on my way to the show today,

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:02.000
completely swerving all around the road,

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
and of course she was texting on cell phones.

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:07.000
Thank you, wonderful, reckless person.

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
Oops. Sorry.

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:14.000
FU to the fact I just started playing the credits music on accident.

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:15.000
And that's it.

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
Can I punctuate that? Can I punctuate that with something?

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:18.000
Sure.

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:23.000
Nobody's text message or phone conversation is as important as Elijah's

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
on the road around you.

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:26.000
Even my mother?

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:27.000
Even.

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:30.000
I think she'd disagree.

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:33.000
Rob, I have told my mother to get off the phone with me

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:36.000
if I found out that she was talking to me while she was driving

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:37.000
without hands-freezing.

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
I'm just saying. Is it okay if I'm stuck in traffic

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
because I totally texted you and Bobby today,

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:44.000
but I was sitting in stopped traffic and I was watching.

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:45.000
I think that's a little bit different.

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:46.000
Okay.

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:50.000
But there's people who do this crap while they're moving on the road,

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:51.000
and that's just not right.

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:57.000
Yeah. I'm not perfect, but safety first.

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:58.000
But you want everyone to think you are.

02:48:58.000 --> 02:48:59.000
I know. Well, you know.

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:03.000
Well, no, I take that back. I am perfect, actually.

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:04.000
Rob.

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:05.000
All right.

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:08.000
Couple more stories for you guys, and then the Skype line.

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:14.000
Brace yourselves, 877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
Couple new stories real quick before we get there, though.

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:17.000
Loki.

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:20.000
I guess Kmart wants me to put reviews up for games.

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:27.000
Honestly, wouldn't have known that because I have not been in a Kmart in...

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:28.000
Yes, think about it.

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:31.000
Oh, God, at like ten years now.

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:32.000
So, yes.

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:33.000
You should go. It's fun.

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:34.000
And remember Kmart's one of the... on our Wiki.

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
It's a cultural experience.

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:37.000
It's like stepping back into the 80s.

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:38.000
It is. It is.

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
Hey, remember the 80s?

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:45.000
Remember back in the day when they used to have, like, those touchpad sensors for opening the doors?

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
It wasn't this fancy infrared.

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
It was, you know, you step on a sensor and...

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:53.000
Actually, I think you guys, Kmart has modernized a little bit.

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:57.000
I think they are right now somewhere around 93.

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:58.000
Eh.

02:49:58.000 --> 02:49:59.000
Just so you know.

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
Rob, you're adorable.

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
I just want to let you know.

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:04.000
I know.

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:12.000
Um, apparently they are looking for reader reviews or I guess shopper reviews on different titles.

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:19.000
Um, they said, uh, one thing, uh, we'd like to feature your reviews on our shelves.

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:26.000
Um, it says, but at this time we will not be sending out free games for you to review.

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:27.000
Which is kind of funny.

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:31.000
Wait, what? So, like, on the shelf they'll have, like, papers with reviews printed out or something?

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:32.000
I guess.

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:33.000
What?

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:41.000
They're, um, they're basically looking for reviews, um, to help sell games, I guess.

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:44.000
So, we're supposed to help them market games.

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
But they're not going to publish the negative things then.

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:50.000
So, in other words, they will extract one or two sentences that are glowing about the game.

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:53.000
Like, you fucking kill zombies and it's rad.

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
Like, you know, or whatever.

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
They'll put that on a little tag next to the game.

02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:05.000
Yeah, um, so you can go, like, uh, I guess re-register at MyKMart, um, I don't know, that's MyKMart.com.

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:08.000
People are gonna make shit up just to get their stuff in the store.

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:14.000
Dude, all you gotta do, Kmart, seriously, is do a little work, um, I don't know, go to Metacritic

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:19.000
and there's, like, a list of all these fucking reviews with little synopsises of each review

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:24.000
and little, like, blurbs and stuff that you can print out and put on your shelves.

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:25.000
I guess, or maybe that would be copyright.

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:26.000
Yeah, it might be a copyright thing.

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:27.000
Whatever, so.

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
Then put the Metacritic score.

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
That's what they do on Steam.

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:32.000
You can see the Metacritic score right there.

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:35.000
Unless it's, like, under a certain amount, then it's not, it's just not there.

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
Love it.

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:38.000
I don't, I don't understand.

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
Or have it on your website.

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:45.000
Have people review the, you know, stuff like Amazon or GameStop or whomever.

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
I think it's an interesting idea.

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:48.000
It's just a weird one.

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:49.000
You know what I mean?

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:52.000
Like, it's, it's interesting that they want to put people's reviews up there

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:56.000
and it's, I guess, to encourage a community type thing on the site

02:51:56.000 --> 02:52:00.000
to get people, like, thinking about Kmart, because otherwise you don't.

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:01.000
Whoa.

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
Here's, my mind's blown here.

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:06.000
Apparently Kmart has blogs.

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:07.000
What?

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:08.000
Yes.

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:09.000
Get out.

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:10.000
MyKmart.com.

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
Do they blog about the coffee shops at Kmart?

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:13.000
No, apparently.

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:19.000
This Week in the Icy Machine, Blue Raspberry, yum.

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:24.000
Well, let's see, here's some wonderful, whoa, that's weird.

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:27.000
Here's some wonderful blog posts that we have going on here.

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:30.000
Some of these may even be slightly relevant.

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
Which way do you weed?

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:37.000
And this is talking about either using, I guess, a rake or weed spray.

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:41.000
Kevin Butler versus Old Spice, Old Spice Man.

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:45.000
Who wins for being, I guess, most infamous.

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:48.000
Gamer Chat number one was a success.

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:49.000
Thanks to all-

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
Wait, is this, like, only gaming stuff on the blog?

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
No, this is just blogs.myKmart.com.

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:56.000
They have Blue Light Special stuff.

02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:58.000
They post Blue Light Specials on the blog?

02:52:58.000 --> 02:52:59.000
Yes.

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:00.000
Attention, Twitter.

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:03.000
Blue Light Special on Pepperidge Farm cookies.

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
50% off.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:08.000
Gamer Chat number one was a success.

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:09.000
I gotta read this.

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:15.000
Thanks to all who joined yesterday's, you know, pound, Gamer Chat Twitter event.

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:18.000
We had a spirited discussion about gaming,

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:23.000
including the best year for video games, people's first games,

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:27.000
and some of this year's surprises, both good and bad.

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:30.000
Oh, but if you weren't able to catch it yesterday,

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:33.000
you can download a, or you can check out a full transcript.

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:38.000
What are some of the topics that you'd like to discuss in the next Gamer Chat?

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:41.000
Oh, oh, wait, what's this?

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:45.000
I, they have a gaming blog, too.

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:48.000
Kmartgamer.com.

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000
Are you a Kmart gamer?

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:55.000
Or, I guess it's blogs.myKmart.com slash games.

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:58.000
It's just, it's the same fucking blog with video game tags pulled out.

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:01.000
I see what you're doing.

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:05.000
They talk about, what's your backlog of games?

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:09.000
Oh my God, Kmart, you're so current with your blogs and fun stuff like that.

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
I have to shop at you now.

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:16.000
Kmart is awesome because most every Kmart I've been to totally ignores street dates.

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:18.000
Totally ignores them.

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:20.000
I bet if you went into Kmart and go,

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:23.000
yeah, I saw it on your blog and be like, huh, what's a blog, huh?

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:27.000
On the internet? What the hell's the internet?

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000
That's witchcraft.

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:34.000
Did I tell you about the time that like Target was closed for like six months

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.000
and Walmart, I just, I wasn't going to go to Walmart.

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:41.000
So I actually went to Kmart to get like razor blades and it was the most like challenging.

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:44.000
First of all, they have them locked because, you know,

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:48.000
I guess there's rampant thievery of razor blades across the nation.

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:58.000
I had to track someone down to get a key and they give it to just like the old cragly lady.

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:01.000
Here's another wonderful topic.

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000
What kind of razor blade did you want?

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:07.000
Did you want the Gillette Mach five or did you want?

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:13.000
I mean, just like, Oh my God, I want to die from June 23rd, 2010 fat guy in a little coat.

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:17.000
Biggest loser special.

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:22.000
You're talking about the biggest loser game.

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000
Wow. My life is now complete.

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:28.000
Now that I have discovered Kmart has a blog, I will read it every day.

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:29.000
You know why? For sure.

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:33.000
Kmart updates their blog more regularly than any of us post on orangehoundsradio.com.

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:36.000
I don't care. Do you want me to post nonsense like this?

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:39.000
I will be happy to post nonsense like this.

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
I played that game. It was wonderful.

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:47.000
Go buy it at Kmart.

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000
Look at me making a reference to it.

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:52.000
Would you please sign up for a Kmart account and start reviewing games?

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:57.000
I think we should all sign up for Kmart accounts and start reviewing games on there

02:55:57.000 --> 02:56:02.000
with just like complete nonsensical reviews of things.

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:10.000
Like, you know, like, you know, I was sitting here on the couch and I was playing Naughty Bear

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:15.000
and it was fun, but I was sitting there naked and the dog came up and licked my balls.

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:18.000
So I think this game should be called Naughty Dog.

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:23.000
Like just these complete nonsensical things that have nothing to do with anything.

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:26.000
I would love that very much.

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:30.000
I'm sorry, Rob. My brain started to shut down when you started talking about that.

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:35.000
What you're describing sounds like a lot of effort.

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:39.000
I'm going to do it. I'm going to start a forum thread for awesome Kmart reviews.

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:43.000
And I want all the OL Army to post their awesome Kmart reviews and link them.

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000
You mean like butt-tarded?

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:49.000
And just that they have to be like complete. But don't get yourself banned.

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:54.000
Don't say stupid shit. You have to say like really awkward things.

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:57.000
Basically you have to go on tangents a lot.

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
Just like us.

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:04.000
You'll be talking about your Red Dead Redemption review and then somehow talk about how you like horses.

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:09.000
And this one time you rode a horse and then it gave you like, you know, car crash or something like that.

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:15.000
Now that was terrible. But at least the horse's name was like, you know, Biscuit or something.

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:23.000
I was riding my horse Clyde and I skinned a horse in Red Dead Redemption that reminded me of Clyde.

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:26.000
And one time Clyde kicked me in the shin.

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:29.000
And it made me pee.

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000
How about that?

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:35.000
Monty Boggs here. This is great. Now people are posting their reviews. This is great.

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:40.000
Alan Wake makes me want to buy Energizer batteries at Kmart. Buy Alan Wake at Kmart.

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:43.000
Alan Wake from Gamestop wasn't as good. That's pretty good.

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:52.000
Ray Ayanami says, great rail shooter. Now has anyone been far as decided to use even Go1 to do look more like?

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:58.000
I get it.

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:03.000
Let me try to read it again. That's awesome. That's an awesome review.

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:13.000
Great rail shooter. Now has anyone really been far as decided to use even Go1 to do look more like?

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:20.000
I love you guys.

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:28.000
That should be on the tag right there.

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:34.000
That about sums up what I think of Kmart in the reviewing.

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:37.000
You've been far as decided to use even Go1 to do more look like?

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:40.000
That's about right.

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:43.000
That's the point. Dark Dead Studio is like, I don't get it. That's the point.

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:46.000
Like he just he just threw a bunch of words together that make no sense at all.

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:53.000
And it's funny. And I'm laughing so hard. I'm crying. I can't stop.

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:57.000
Yet Dark Soccer is not like throwing up over there like the bad grammars.

02:58:57.000 --> 02:59:01.000
She must be. No, because this is appropriately bad grammar.

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:04.000
OK. Like there is like little cats.

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:09.000
I didn't go around correcting the little cats. I pet them on the head and feed them fish.

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:13.000
All right. One more story for you guys and then we'll get to the calls.

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:20.000
1877 Game OLR username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:30.000
The Brick Theater in Brooklyn, New York is putting on some shows and they are video game inspired plays.

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:42.000
Yes, that's right. There's Grand Theft Ovid, which takes the Roman poets Ovid's songs and talks like integrates it with Grand Theft Auto.

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:48.000
Modal Combat uses guitar controllers. And I don't even understand this.

02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:52.000
This is just like what? Let me let me look at the official website here.

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:57.000
Let me look here. Go into the Brick Theater website here.

02:59:57.000 --> 03:00:00.000
Gameplay at the Brick is art playable.

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:04.000
Our video game cinematic is Mashima theatrical. Our smartphones a stage.

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:07.000
Is there an architecture that connects these diverse media forums?

03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:14.000
What boundaries can be broken within and without the walls of an off off Broadway theater to change your reviews?

03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:18.000
They're having. Rock band karaoke night.

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:25.000
Well, that's not a play. Baby Castles, Chiptunes Dance Party, Kool Aid Man and Second Life.

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:31.000
Theater of the Arcade, five classic video games adapted for the stage in this collection of short plays.

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:37.000
The creators of Brick hit suspicious package and this is stupid. Like what?

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:42.000
This makes no sense. It gets a Dan quote, Rob.

03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:46.000
What? Really? That's Dan line.

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:50.000
You know what? I'm going to write a review of these plays and it's going to say great rail shooter.

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:57.000
Now, has anyone really been far as decided to use even go what to do look more like?

03:00:57.000 --> 03:01:00.000
Because that's pretty much my reaction when reading this story.

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:03.000
One, eight, seven, seven. Game. O. L. R.

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:07.000
Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio. If you want to give us a call, we'll talk.

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000
One, eight, seven, seven. Game. O. L. R.

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000
username is Skype is Orange Laundry.

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:14.000
The Skype line is now open.

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:20.000
Frisbee is asking what game should I review? You should review blur.

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:24.000
Frisbee, I'd like you to review the game blur. Let's go to the phones.

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:27.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:32.000
Hi, it's Ray Iannami. Hi, Ray. Good to see you yesterday at the show.

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:36.000
Yeah, it was really good to see you. Yeah.

03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:39.000
So what's on your mind?

03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:46.000
So for California Extreme, the games I'm looking for,

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:54.000
The Don't Bunch Diode 2, Blue Space Harrier, Red, among other things.

03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:58.000
Wait, there was a space harrier there? There was a space harrier in the back.

03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:05.000
Oh, I missed it. Fortunately, the person who said the machine forgot to put in an add a credit button.

03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:12.000
So for instance, you had to put in a coin and take the coin out of the coin door just to start a game.

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:18.000
And the second day they closed the coin door. So you had to put it in a corner, which is kind of dumb.

03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:22.000
Yeah, it was kind of bothersome when some of those games would run out of credits.

03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:27.000
But you know, I can't hate because they're just arcade collectors and they're actually doing a favor,

03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:31.000
putting their machines out there. They don't have to do it, so I try not to bitch.

03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:34.000
But it was really frustrating when I wanted to play Tapper and it was out of credits.

03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:38.000
It's like, wham.

03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:43.000
So in other news, I've gone around to playing Deathmatch and Sin and Punishment 2.

03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:46.000
Now, what was your real review of Sin and Punishment 2?

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:50.000
Because by the way, that was you I noticed in chat that has now spawned the new OLR quote.

03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:53.000
Has anyone really been far as decided to use even Go What To Do Look More Like?

03:02:53.000 --> 03:03:01.000
Well, it's actually an already existing Internet meme. I just thought I'd throw in some random meme to go with my review.

03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:05.000
Did you bring 4chan to this show?

03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:06.000
Maybe.

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:08.000
Oh, god damn you.

03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:10.000
Well, I brought games back to the show.

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:13.000
Oh, okay. Whatever. No, I'm just fucking around.

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:15.000
Kids on the Internet are funny.

03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:20.000
I've been playing Sin and Punishment 2 for the past two days.

03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:24.000
It's pretty fun. It's a great improvement over the last game.

03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:29.000
But I'm going to warrant anyone who wants to get that game even though it's not played the original.

03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:32.000
It's fucking hard.

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:38.000
I see. Aren't most of those shooter games pretty hard?

03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:49.000
Yeah, I mean, if people aren't too bad by real shooter standards, it's a bosses that get to me mainly.

03:03:49.000 --> 03:04:01.000
I have to do a few tries if we get the patterns down so I don't end up bullshitting through a pattern.

03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:05.000
And I've been playing Death Moth as well for the past two weeks.

03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:07.000
And how's that?

03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:16.000
So Death Moth, for those who haven't heard of it, is a side-scrolling shooter by Kave with gothic loli elements.

03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:17.000
Awesome.

03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:27.000
And that aside, I especially like this game. I love the fact that you can fire in both directions, which is a luxury that most side-scrollers tend to lack.

03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:32.000
Like, you're stuck firing to the right, which is usually the direction you scroll.

03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:38.000
And it's also much easier to play than other Bloodhog games.

03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:44.000
Even with the in-game difficulty at the highest, I can get to the final stage easily.

03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:54.000
But on other shooters, I usually end up only halfway through the game on my first credit.

03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:58.000
Hmm. Interesting. You can get that far?

03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:05.000
I thought that would be the harder game, because usually those, like, SHMUP games are impossibly difficult.

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:13.000
Death Moth, no, not that... it's not that hard, really. It's been one of the easier cases.

03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:19.000
I play as opposed to the Donpax, which I play as much harder.

03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:20.000
Alright.

03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:24.000
They do call him Bullet Hell for a reason, though.

03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:31.000
I fire bombs on the first spot of the Donpax Dial Joe, and that's not something I do in both shooters.

03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:40.000
Like, I can easily get through the stage one boss of a vertical shooter just fine without using any bombs.

03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:42.000
Okay. Okay.

03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:47.000
Well, are there any other games coming up in the near future that you're going to be reviewing in the future on the show?

03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:49.000
That you're looking forward to playing?

03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:59.000
Um, I'm not sure, because I've spent a whole lot of buying new games until this mess up begins next month, because Death Moth and Standard Placement took a toll on my money.

03:05:59.000 --> 03:06:06.000
I hear ya. Now I have a car payment, so I have to watch my gaming funding as well, so I think a lot of us are in that pinch.

03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:15.000
Like, including tax, both of those games cost me $110, so I've already been waiting until this mess up begins, so I'll probably, I don't know, I'll probably pick up a person that's pretty portable.

03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:22.000
Alright. Well, we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you very much for your call, and we'll see you at the next big Bay Area expo, okay?

03:06:22.000 --> 03:06:24.000
Okay, then. Alright.

03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:25.000
Later.

03:06:25.000 --> 03:06:31.000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR. Let's go to another call that's coming in right now. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:33.000
Uh, this is Recon Elite.

03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:36.000
Recon Elite! Welcome to the show. Have you called in before?

03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:40.000
Uh, no. I'm a long-time listener, but first-time caller.

03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:46.000
I've always wanted someone to say that on this program. Long-time listener, first-time caller. Well, welcome! How you doin'? What's on your mind?

03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:48.000
I'm doing good.

03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:50.000
How can we help you? What's on your mind?

03:06:50.000 --> 03:06:56.000
Yeah, I just wanted to know, um, I have a quick question. I don't know if you guys ever played it before, but Borderlands, what do you think about that?

03:06:56.000 --> 03:06:58.000
Borderlands is awesome!

03:06:58.000 --> 03:07:15.000
I have not played Borderlands, but I've watched someone else play it, and it kinda looks like, it has a really neat art style. It's kinda like Oblivion meets this very, like, post-apocalyptic kind of, uh, world. I don't know. Have you played this?

03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:16.000
Okay.

03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:18.000
With guns! And it's fun!

03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:19.000
It's awesome.

03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:20.000
It's hilarious.

03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:22.000
I've heard a lot of great things about this game.

03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:24.000
Totally get the Isle of Dr. Ned.

03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:36.000
At least, though, you totally missed your opportunity to get it on Steam for, like, super cheap, because I almost bought it because it was down to, like, 20 bucks, but, unfortunately, the Uber sale's over. But, let me guess, you're probably gonna get it on console, huh?

03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:39.000
Well, it was either one. It didn't bother me too much.

03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:40.000
Oh, okay.

03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:58.000
Well, the community was big, you know, as in playing it, because the last thing I wanted was to go online on it, and then nobody ain't there, you know. That was my fear.

03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:10.000
You definitely would have people to play with there. And, you know, they've released several expansions for it. I've really heard nothing but good things about it. I just haven't had the time to play it myself, thanks to certain MMOs that I spend a lot of time playing.

03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:12.000
That's wild.

03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:13.000
Addict!

03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:15.000
I say wow too all the time.

03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:18.000
Okay, phew. Okay, then you understand what I go through.

03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:19.000
Yeah.

03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:36.000
But, yeah, no, I've honestly heard nothing but good things about the game. Here's a thought. If you want to try it out, here's what some people I know are doing. OnLive is this new thing that's out there, and you can sign, they're still doing sign-ups, and I just read something, like, it's extended through Labor Day.

03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:40.000
You can try to get into the beta by signing up. Are you on OnLive?

03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:41.000
Yes.

03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:49.000
Okay, you can play demos of games. You can play the first, like, 30 or 45 minutes of a game without buying it, and Borderlands is one of them.

03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:52.000
Oh, okay. Oh, that's a nice good suggestion.

03:08:52.000 --> 03:09:10.000
There you go. Go on to OnLive. You know, I gotta say, as weird as I think the OnLive pricing, but here's my suggestion, don't buy it on OnLive, because the whole thing is that, yeah, it's cool that you're playing through another computer that has all the graphics and everything, but you're paying the same price you'd pay at retail for the game.

03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:20.000
And it really is only guaranteed to last three years. If OnLive fails, you're going to lose that game. You're basically paying for a three-year rental. So, if you like the game, go get it on Steam.

03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:22.000
Okay. Thank you.

03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:23.000
That's my suggestion.

03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:24.000
I just got one more quick question, and I'll hang up.

03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:25.000
Of course.

03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:30.000
Do you think Project Natal, what do you think about Project Natal? Do you think it's going to fail, or do you think it's going to succeed?

03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:41.000
Well, keep in mind, we're all supposed to call it Kinect now, but I think it's a huge risk on Microsoft's part. A lot of it has to do with how they market it.

03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:59.000
The Macy's thing, as much as we give them a hard time about who the hell at Macy's plays Kinect, we know exactly who they're going for. And, you know, all laughing and jokes aside, they're trying to appeal to Mom, or AKA Santa Claus, because they're going kind of directly to make their case there and show the games there.

03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:10.000
That's a huge risk on Microsoft's part. I think the price point is everything. I think if they release this for $150, that's really $210 if you want a game.

03:10:10.000 --> 03:10:19.000
And I think there's a lot of people that are going to run away from that, but if they can hit that magic number, $99, I think it'll sell twice as much, and it could be a success for them.

03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:25.000
Got you. Okay. I just want to end it with that. Love the show. Keep it up. The good work, man. You guys are awesome. I love it.

03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:28.000
We love the call. Thank you so much for your enthusiasm. You're awesome.

03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:31.000
And thank you for saying the phrase that we've been waiting to hear.

03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:34.000
I know. I've been waiting eight years to hear that. Longtime listener, first time caller.

03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:35.000
All right. I got you.

03:10:35.000 --> 03:10:36.000
All right. Take care, buddy.

03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:37.000
All right. You have a good night.

03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:38.000
Uh-huh. You too.

03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:39.000
All right. Bye-bye.

03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:45.000
Bye. That's how you know we're like legitimate radio now, because, you know, whenever you listen to a radio talk show, there's always that guy that calls in,

03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:49.000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Dr. Laura. Longtime listener, first time caller.

03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:51.000
Love it.

03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:56.000
I don't know why I named Dr. Laura, because she actually really sucks.

03:10:56.000 --> 03:10:58.000
It means we've arrived.

03:10:58.000 --> 03:11:02.000
It is. We made it. We made it. That decree meant something.

03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:04.000
Now the Laverne and Shirley theme is going through my head for some reason?

03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:06.000
We're gonna do it.

03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:16.000
By the way, Gold Anthro in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradiocom is kind of offering the counterpoint to what I was just saying about Borderlands.

03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:21.000
Meh, Borderlands just isn't the game for me. I played it and was like, this isn't as fun as it sounded.

03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:30.000
So, you know, not everybody's a fan, so take that. But I think OnLive is going to be great for demos.

03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:40.000
Like, even I have to pat myself on the back. I think that's a good idea to just go play the first 30 minutes of the game for yourself and make a determination if you want to play, you know, more.

03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:45.000
All right. 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:48.000
Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?

03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:56.000
Uh, sure do. Let's see, let's talk about this really funny hack that they have for Sonic the Hedgehog.

03:11:56.000 --> 03:12:12.000
Sonic 2 XL, it changes the gold rings to onion rings and Sonic gets fat to the point if you eat too many rings without running around enough, you will just sit there and kind of die.

03:12:12.000 --> 03:12:15.000
But he gets a big ol' potbelly. That's kind of funny.

03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:25.000
And that's actually a real ROM hack. You can actually download the ROM that's available on the Sonic Retro forums, forums.sonicretro.org.

03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:28.000
So check it out there.

03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:42.000
Can I say this real quick? Because bonds006 in chat just spoke up and it reminded me of something he said earlier that I forgot to mention, but apparently he ran into like a New York Times reporter who was doing a story on DDR and BeatMania and stuff.

03:12:42.000 --> 03:12:47.000
He totally pimped our show. Now that's a fan. Now that's a fan.

03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:49.000
Thank you! We love you now.

03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:50.000
I saw that in the chat.

03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:57.000
Yeah, I forgot to mention it earlier. I was going to mention it after the iTunes review, but you know, I'm easily distracted by shiny things. So I apologize.

03:12:57.000 --> 03:13:16.000
You may remember there's a company called Blick that puts out different gamer decals or vinyl decals you can put up on the wall. I'm using them in our nursery. But if you're not interested in New Super Mario Brothers or 8-Bit Mario or Donkey Kong, you can now get your hands on some Atari ones.

03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:30.000
They have Centipede and Asteroids. And they're available for $45 for a full set. They are kind of expensive, but they're kind of neat if that's what you want to put on your wall.

03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:36.000
Could have just done that for the baby room. Although I don't know, the Centipede one's a little creepy.

03:13:36.000 --> 03:13:39.000
It's kind of dumb. Asteroids isn't bad. Centipede...

03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:42.000
I think it's... actually are those up on ThinkGeek?

03:13:42.000 --> 03:13:46.000
They've got 8-Bit Mega Man ones coming at some point. That's going to be awesome.

03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:58.000
If I married a gamer nerd someday, you know, like, I think that would be an awesome addition for our house. Like, honestly, I think Dark Soccer should have that up in the vault. I think that looks kind of cool. Although, actually, the way the vault's designed, that wouldn't really work.

03:13:58.000 --> 03:14:14.000
Dan and I actually did have a talk, because I'm sure I've mentioned it on the show before, before we were going to, you know, when we were talking about a kid, we were going to do a Mario theme. And Dan said, uh-uh, Sonic.

03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:23.000
That'll be great, too, because at Loki's house, it'll be Mario, and then you'll have Sonic. What do I get, Crash Bandicoot?

03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:28.000
Yes.

03:14:28.000 --> 03:14:35.000
Crash Bandicoot? Crash Bandicoot was fun for, like, three games, and then they just totally, like, beat him into the ground. I'll get Kevin Butler.

03:14:35.000 --> 03:14:42.000
Kevin Butler-themed nursery? That would be creepy.

03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:44.000
Why is the baby crying all the time?

03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:48.000
I don't know what's going on!

03:14:48.000 --> 03:15:03.000
Anything else? Yes. Cave has announced two more SHMUP games coming out. They are going to be releasing, I guess, Gwanji on Xbox Live Arcade.

03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:15.000
Or, I should say, yeah, they're going to be releasing that. What else are they releasing here?

03:15:15.000 --> 03:15:29.000
Oh, here we go. Kai Katana, or Red Katana, is going to be a new Bullet Hell shooter coming out. I believe that's going to be on, I think, the download services, like Xbox Live Arcade.

03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:35.000
And then for the iPhone, they're going to do Dondopachi Daifukkatsu.

03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:38.000
Yay! I totally want Dondopachi on my phone.

03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:53.000
And that'll be coming out of the iPhone this summer. So, that's kind of cool. Let's see. Screenshots here of, uh, that's a private video. Well, fuck you, I don't want to read it then. Or watch it, whatever.

03:15:53.000 --> 03:16:12.000
Apparently, Amazon Germany has listed a Xbox 360 4GB arcade system bundle. Of course, they've already announced that they're going to be doing some sort of arcade system this fall in the US and other territories.

03:16:12.000 --> 03:16:23.000
But now we kind of have an idea of what it's going to be. It's going to be probably that slim down system without a hard drive, but a 4GB memory stick, or not memory stick, USB thumb drive that you're going to be able to use with it.

03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:37.000
And that's fine, since, remember, you can actually put in your own laptop drives into the Xbox 360 S, or whatever the hell you're going to call it, just like you can on a Playstation 3.

03:16:37.000 --> 03:16:53.000
That's kind of neat, I guess. But that'll be available this fall. It looks like it's going to be, well, right now it's listing at 148.99 euros.

03:16:53.000 --> 03:17:14.000
So, um... I believe that's it.

03:17:14.000 --> 03:17:27.000
I think Apple needs to work on, I don't know, making the iOSes work on their phones first.

03:17:27.000 --> 03:17:41.000
I'm raging because I have a 3G, and the iOS 4 upgrade just borked it, and it kind of was pointed out to me, and I think it was a very good observation that they do this to make me upgrade, and it stinks.

03:17:41.000 --> 03:17:43.000
That's all I'm saying.

03:17:43.000 --> 03:17:49.000
And I know, then I shouldn't get an Apple, I shouldn't buy an iPhone, I shouldn't support them. Maybe I won't! I don't know.

03:17:49.000 --> 03:17:53.000
No, we all know I'm going to get that shiny, white, new iPhone, because I want it.

03:17:53.000 --> 03:17:55.000
Alright.

03:17:55.000 --> 03:17:58.000
ST100Matt is currently working on a Kmart review, I'm so excited.

03:17:58.000 --> 03:18:01.000
Okay, that's it, though, for the show now.

03:18:01.000 --> 03:18:06.000
Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show, and listening to us, and downloading us, and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:18.000
We can't do it without your support, you know, we don't have massive advertising or anything like that, it's really word of mouth, and the awesome reviews you guys do, and telling reporters and shit about us, that is word of mouth at its finest.

03:18:18.000 --> 03:18:27.000
Thank you guys so much, we so appreciate it, and you guys are the reason we come back week after week, and don't let the State Fair distract us from doing a show.

03:18:27.000 --> 03:18:30.000
Alright, but Disneyland might, I'm just putting it out there.

03:18:30.000 --> 03:18:36.000
Alright, anyhow, for now, though, we're going to go around and give everybody's final thoughts. Uh, Loki, why don't you start us off tonight with your final thought?

03:18:36.000 --> 03:18:41.000
I want to make some of these custom Mario Kart tracks for the Wii. They look fun.

03:18:41.000 --> 03:18:44.000
And I can make some pretty killer tracks, probably.

03:18:44.000 --> 03:18:49.000
My final thought is, my server on WoW is scheduled for 24 hour maintenance this week.

03:18:49.000 --> 03:18:57.000
Nooooooo! Just kidding, I'm going to play lots of Team Fortress 2, and Left 4 Dead 1, and these other games I've been meaning to play forever.

03:18:57.000 --> 03:18:59.000
Dark Soccer, your final thought?

03:18:59.000 --> 03:19:01.000
My Sim's house is freaking gorgeous.

03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:05.000
You've put a lot of flowers in it, it's a very girly house because you have flowers everywhere.

03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:10.000
Well, it's not very girly, it's this one part of it that's set up as a wild flower garden.

03:19:10.000 --> 03:19:12.000
And those are totally Sakura trees, aren't they?

03:19:12.000 --> 03:19:20.000
Yeah, they are. But the rest of the house is very sort of neo-modern, and my house floats. We all float here.

03:19:20.000 --> 03:19:29.000
Alright, that's it. We're tuning out and signing off. Thank you guys so much again for your support. We'll be back to do it all again next week.

03:19:29.000 --> 03:19:35.000
We'll see you next week with more of Orange, unless Loki's wife has the baby, then he won't be here.

03:19:35.000 --> 03:19:37.000
Because that could happen at any time, so stay tuned.

03:19:37.000 --> 03:19:39.000
I hope she doesn't have anything.

03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:41.000
Yeah, well that's true. She's still got what, another month, right?

03:19:41.000 --> 03:19:44.000
Preferably at least two weeks.

03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:47.000
At least two weeks, alright then. So hopefully two more weeks of Loki at least.

03:19:47.000 --> 03:19:54.000
Alright, but that's it. Have a wonderful night everybody. We'll see you soon next time here on Orange Lounge Radio. Good night.

03:20:17.000 --> 03:20:24.000
See you next time.
