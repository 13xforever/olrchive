Alright, welcome back everybody to Rob Roberts and pals here on the Orange Lounge Radio feed.
It's our E3 wrap-up show, the final day.
Yes, sadly, E3 2010 is all done, and today we're not coming to you from a hotel room.
Actually, right now we are in the parking lot of In-N-Out Burger, where I've taken the one and only Bobby Blackwolf to his first In-N-Out experience.
And Bobby, hyped?
Too much?
Not enough?
What did you think of In-N-Out?
It was a burger.
DarkSakura.com
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, but I really do urge you to tune in to the Bobby Blackwolf Show, who's right beforehand at 5 Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern.
Rock Band 3
That blew me away.
All the stuff they added.
I didn't realize how much they added.
I know you guys covered it already.
So I'm not really going to add to it right now.
But I will say one of the things I was able to... I played the keyboard and I played Pro Mode on Medium.
Which basically means that you have two notes at a time.
So two note chords and everything.
And one thing that they don't tell a lot of people, and one thing that you don't realize, is that they actually do have bumps on the keys.
To denote where the color changes.
So you don't have to look at the keyboard when they shift.
Because you can actually feel where the colors are.
So I thought that was... That's like one little tiny thing.
They don't really mention it.
They don't say it.
But that adds a lot.
So there was that, and I also did an interview, and it's going to be on E3Coverage.com, and I actually stumped the guy about the MIDI port, because the Guitar Hero drum set has a MIDI input.
Kind of like what they're saying, but it's not going to work for the Pro mode.
You could use it for the basic, but you're not going to be able to use it in the Pro modes of anything.
So that was interesting, and they are considering...
Portal 2 is hilarious Portal 2 is hilarious
He admitted that to me.
They are talking to him, asking him who he wants to work with to do it.
So he is definitely going to be a part of it for the music side.
But they've kept the humor and the gameplay elements they've added with the liquids, where you can either jump or slide really fast.
And some of the other objects that they've introduced really look like it's going to be a great title.
It's going to be a standalone title.
So I'm really looking forward to that.
One thing non-gaming that I saw today that probably won't interest the OLR audience as much, but it's more of a glimpse of what they can do in the future, is I actually got a behind-the-scenes demo of Kinect with the dashboard.
So showing the video chat and stuff where the Kinect camera seamlessly will zoom in and out based on who's in the frame.
So like if you're sitting on the couch alone, it'll be zoomed in on you.
If somebody sits next to you on the couch, it will automatically zoom out and put them in the picture, take the two of you into the picture and stuff like that, if that's the kind of thing you'd like to use.
But really, ESPN integration, it's not just watching ESPN3, which ESPN3 is their online...
The Ocho!
It's like the Ocho.
Basically, it's all the stuff that they have regionally that air on regional stuff, but not good enough for the national.
So you can watch anything online, like college football, if it's an out-of-market team for you, or if it's a very small school or something, they probably still have it on ESPN3.
And you don't just watch it.
They actually ask you...
who you're rooting for and it actually keeps track and here comes another plane the plane, the plane so it actually keeps track they showed us USC vs. Ohio State you're going to watch that college football game the first thing they ask you is who are you rooting for and then it tells you how many people percentages of people watching that on Xbox Live are rooting for that team and then it'll do trivia questions if you want that feature on and you're competing against the other fans while you're watching the game
and just stuff like that, you know, if they integrated that into ESPN, maybe other things, they would be able to integrate that same thing.
Do you think maybe for like, you know, women and the gays, as they say, we could get the Oscars in the same type of situation?
Although I'm so over the Oscars personally.
I think that would be awesome, where they would have people guess who might win and stuff, and who would get the award.
Who wore it best!
Yeah, and things like that.
There's very good opportunity there for that, and I was very impressed with that.
I got to use a little bit on the dashboard and stuff.
You still have to take very slow, deliberate movements.
You're not at the minority report level yet.
You can't just flick around or something because you'll wind up hitting something you don't want to hit.
They were taking very deliberate movements to do it.
But I'm very, I'm excited, I'm one of the few people excited for Kinect for all, you know, for just the dashboard.
Can I actually go back a little bit and talk about the video chat real quick?
Because, you know, obviously the, not the iToy, the Xbox Vision that we had before, you know, kind of had the video chat.
And, you know, I realize this is way upgraded, you know, better quality, it can zoom in and out and all this stuff, but
One thing I found about the video chat is that I rarely used it because it's kind of, you know, it's not like a cell phone where a cell phone's always on you and you pick it up, hit a button, you're good to go.
You know, I would think with a video chat, you both have to be on the 360 and then you have to, you know, kind of want to connect and so forth.
You know, I don't know.
It's like I get iPhone video chat, you know, if they ever get it on 3G, but
I kind of sit here going, okay, that sounds cool, but am I ever really going to use Connect Video Chat except the one time to say I did?
You might not.
Families might.
Now realize it's not just 360 to 360.
It's going to be with Windows Live Messenger.
And I believe they even said right at launch.
So you'll be able to talk to somebody if they have Windows Live Messenger on their computer and a webcam, you will be able to talk to them.
Okay, now that's a big thing I wasn't considering before.
I could see that now, then maybe like, you know, college kids trying to talk to parents or grandmas that are, you know, getting internet enabled in this day and age.
That makes a lot more sense.
And they also have Bing integrated with it where you could actually select... We're gonna wait for the plane.
The plane, the plane!
There we go, there goes the plane.
You can actually select top videos of entertainment stuff and you can both watch it at the same time.
They call them conversation starters.
So if you don't know what to talk about, somebody can select this video and it pops up in the center and so you're on each side and you can talk about that video.
I can see it now, us doing an entire episode of Orange Lounge Radio just of the Bing topic selections.
Oh my god, what an amazing podcast that would be.
Just the Bing video chat podcast.
Come on, you guys.
You know there's somebody.
Patent pending.
It's mine.
Don't take it.
I will sue you.
We could do it together.
Hey, there you go.
I could do it at my place.
You could do it at yours.
We'll record.
I've got the capture equipment.
Awesome.
And we could make it a video podcast.
There we go.
One other game I played, which was actually a music-based game, Power Gig.
I actually played this.
Now, this is the game, and somebody even asked me about it, I think, on my Sunday night show last week.
They were like, what do you think of Power Gig?
I'm like, oh, if it teaches you how to play guitar, it'll be great.
This one doesn't.
It uses a real guitar.
It looks like a real guitar, feels like a real guitar, but it's really still the same as Rock Band.
And
They actually, I didn't realize they had a drum peripheral.
The drum peripheral is air drums.
It's like, and since this is your crowd I can say this and they'll get it, it's like Para Para Paradise.
So you have drumsticks with sensors in them that break the plane of the pads, of the sensors shooting, or the lasers shooting up or whatever.
And basically there's four floor sensors that I guess are sending lasers upwards and the drumstick is sensing them and that's how it does
I don't play that way.
I play...
For any music geeks out there, I play matched grip, like you would in marching band.
That's how I play drum sets.
I don't really do the thumb-up grip, which is called French grip.
See, I'm a nerd, band nerd.
But a lot of drum set players do, so that's why they do it that way.
But you have to do it that way.
Because if the sensor's not going down, it's not going to register.
And I was having a problem getting one of the pads, the hi-hat pad, to register at all.
It wasn't registering most of the time, so it was not a very fun experience, but they said it was still beta hardware, and it's not the final version.
Can I just say though, and kind of go back a little bit again, since you invoked the name Parapara, something that kind of occurred to me today on the floor, maybe last night after we taped, I don't know,
But I realize I'm kind of, this E3 is really making me eat a fat slice of humble pie because for years, literally years on this program, I've kind of sat here and said, just give up.
Power of Paradise is never coming out in the U.S.
So you're not going to get it.
It's not happening.
People aren't going to get it here.
So shut up already.
It's not going to come out here.
Enjoy its cultness and the fact that it's a very niche thing.
Embrace it.
Have fun with it.
Boy, did I get proved wrong.
It's the most interesting thing to happen, but I swear, you guys, Dance Masters is, it's par par paradise.
I mean, you know, if you do the Night of Fire thing, it's the same thing.
They found a way to kind of get away with it here.
Now, granted, it's not exactly that, but that's as close, now, I will say this, and I will know I'm right.
I will know I'm right.
Take it or leave it, because this is the closest you're ever going to get.
For those that are Paradise fans, which I know we have some of those in the show.
As years old as that is, the camera thing will be pretty cool, I think.
The game itself looks neat, but a very interesting head-to-head that's going to happen with the Harmonix game, too.
Anyway, I don't mean to go back to old topics, but anything else you want to talk about, Bobby?
I'm trying to think.
I did get to play Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
I'm not really going to talk that much about the game because I only played it once or twice and it was button mashing and I lost.
I lost to Justin, the editor, the other guy that does E3 coverage.
I beat him in dancing though, so I'm a better dancer.
But I will say that in the interview with E3Coverage.com that I did, I did invoke Curly Mustaches and Pringles and the Knicks.
So if you're a fan, I invoke all of those in that interview.
And I played Wii Party, because it was a short line, and played the board game, which is kind of like Mario Party without the coins.
and played that for a little bit.
And it was kind of interesting.
Basically, the minigames are to determine the role order.
So that's just one of the many things in Wii Party.
It could be... I'm going to rent it, at least.
And, let's see, now I'm just stalling because I'm trying to think if there was anything else that I saw.
I don't think so.
I mean, Portal 2, hilarious.
OnLive, I didn't realize that OnLive is live now.
Like, it went live probably about an hour ago.
6 p.m.
Pacific is when they said it's going live for everybody.
and I think if you're a founding member you get one year free of OnLive for the PC and it worked on the show floor.
They claimed that the server was up in Silicon Valley.
I don't know if I believe them but if it's free for a year I might as well I might check it out and see it on my own home connection.
This is going to be huge for Mac gamers which I know is kind of an oxymoron but
I'm just kidding, guys.
The MacGamers, I mean, getting to kind of do all this streaming, this is going to open up a huge door, I think.
I would think that's where OnLive is going to be most successful.
But just watching it on the floor, you know, I didn't get the extensive demo you did, but I was like, is this for real?
Because it does look pretty smooth and pretty nice.
I mean, it's kind of one of those things that you know on the show floor, everybody's putting on their nicest, you know, front.
So I kind of wouldn't mind trying it on my home computer and see if it runs as well.
Um, Bobby, I know we're going to wrap up, get you to your flight and all that stuff.
And if people want to hear more, they can tune into you, you know, your Sunday night show or the one I always forget to plug because, you know, we're not on right after it, but it's also a great show.
The effing show, the fnglive.net, which is a video show that you guys do.
You're actually doing one Friday night, which really by the time most people hear this, knowing what time I'm getting home tonight, I'll probably be
Probably be tonight by the time most people hear this.
So tune into that as well at, I believe, 5 Pacific, 8 Eastern once again.
So check that out.
One last question for Bobby, though.
Kind of the thing that surprised you most about... And you've been to a lot of E3s.
You've been to about three times as many of them as I have.
Thing that surprised you most about E3 2010, Bobby?
Oh, God, you're putting me on the spot here.
It's kind of hard to say because I didn't see all that much because of the appointments and stuff.
With Microsoft, it was all interviews.
I never touched a game in the Microsoft booth.
Maybe what surprised me had nothing to do with anything on the show floor, although the game that shocked me was Driver San Francisco.
I didn't realize that would be that good.
But that could also be a good demo just like Split Second.
But it's more that I need to find a way to balance appointments and then having free time to go roam.
I literally only had about two and a half hours the entire week that didn't have appointments that I could actually roam the show floor.
Fourth day!
Yes.
I could use a fourth day.
I know everybody that works E3 is like, Oh God, no, I don't want a fourth day.
Oh my god, but everybody could fill up a fourth day of appointments too.
So it's too short.
But when I wasn't media and I was just showing up as exhibits only attendee as a developer, I was usually bored by the middle of day two.
And I finish up, Rock Band was my last thing that I saw.
And I'm like,
I could go another day.
I'm not done yet.
I'm sure there's going to be something I'm going to miss, and I'm going to kick myself for missing it, like Civ V. But yeah, I need more time.
I think that was the surprise, is that I need more time.
Alright, good answer.
I was totally putting you on the spot.
That was a good answer.
So thank you so much, Bobby, and we'll talk as always on Sunday night.
Now, of course, Shane and I are still going to talk some games too, but we're going to go drop Bobby off at the airport, so we'll just do a little break here in the podcast-a-roo, and we'll be back sometime after the grapevine on I-5.
So stay tuned.
Okay, so we're back for the second half, although I'm kind of a terrible liar.
and it's almost 24 hours after we did that first half but we decided doing a podcast while trying to drive probably wasn't the best of ideas as boring as i5 is so yeah we took the safe route and came home and then of course we were really tired and that's stuff we want to do today but we still wanted to at least wrap up some of the stuff we saw on E3 day three while it's still fresh in our minds although I find that I'm on like game overload I played so much and I've been playing games since I got home because
Shane's like, you gotta play Alan Wake, and I have been, and it's been scary and all that, but I'll talk more about that on Sunday's show.
But anyway, while Shane is still here in California, we want to at least kind of go through some of the games we saw at E3 Day 3, and then of course we'll resume, you know, with all the rest of the news on Sunday night's show.
So, say hello to Shane, everybody, who's back with us here on this Rob Robertson Pals Thursday, kind of Friday edition.
It's actually been over 24 hours since we were supposed to do it because it's now almost 11 here and we stopped at like 7 yesterday, but hi.
You know, through the magic of radio, people would have never known, but that's alright.
Alright Shane, let's get to the games.
Give us some games that you want to talk about.
Alright, I actually wrote these all down in a random order, so I'll go in a random order.
No, I won't.
Castlevania Lords of Shadow.
It's the new Castlevania game coming out for the 360 and the PS3.
Pretty much a God of War style game.
The demo definitely made me want to play more of it because it had some interesting features like there's a part where you're on mounted combat and when you get knocked off because I'm terrible at it you have to fight through enemies before your little sparkle horse comes back so you can start riding again.
Very graphically pretty.
Kind of reminded me of like looking at a painting.
So had some slowdown issues but it's okay I liked it.
Yeah, I'm hoping some of the framerate issues was just because it's still a beta and some of these things are really hard to judge from early demo builds.
But the only thing that kind of got me about the game was that I think a lot of people who weren't happy with the direction Castlevania took in the PS1 and PS2 versions are going to be really disappointed
I think by what they're doing here because it didn't really feel like a Castlevania game to me.
In fact, if I remember right, I read somewhere that this game originally started as a totally different game and then they kind of, I guess, retconned the Castlevania thing into it.
Now, it was not a bad game by any means.
I actually thought it was really cool and pretty and enjoyable, but I think some people that were expecting the old-style, you know, whipping Castlevania games are going to be in for a surprise, because Shane's right, it plays a lot more like God of War, kind of Bayonetta, it felt like a little bit to me, too, with some of the cutscenes.
But, again, very pretty, and I still think probably going to be worth your time checking out when it comes out.
Now, if you do want kind of that old-school 2D experience, I got a little time with the arcade version
Game, which is the Harmony of Despair Castlevania game, which I think we had talked about a little bit the day before, but I actually hands-on played it on the last day of E3, and I enjoyed it.
Shane, I don't think felt so favorably about it, but I kind of like the whole Neo Geo effect of the zoom in and out.
If you ever played the fighting games on the OGO, how it kind of like zooms way in and out and stuff on the action, you can kind of control that in the Castlevania game.
And it was very inspired by Symphony of the Night, which I thought was cool.
So it's basically a race from start to finish.
You have like 10 minutes to kind of get through the castle.
And I know the demo castle I played was kind of hard because it seemed like there really was only one path through the castle.
but I couldn't figure it out.
Unfortunately the demo on the floor didn't give a lot of exposition as to what all the features were and the people at least where I was at.
I played it at Microsoft's booth and I don't think the people there were as on the up and up on what the game was all about so unfortunately
I was a little bit kind of like lost, I guess, as to all the features.
But, you know, I enjoyed what I played.
And, you know, I'm pretty sure the arcade game will probably cost $10, maybe $15.
And it'll probably be worth it.
I will probably pay and at least check out the full version.
If not, at least the trial, for heaven's sake.
Fable 3 was another game I checked out at Microsoft's booth.
And Fable 3, again, the demo...
Didn't really give you a lot, at least for me, of what is really different about the game from Fable 2.
I noticed a lot of the gold trail was kind of back from the other Fable games.
And the difference I saw was that you could dress up in a giant chicken suit for one of the quests.
But they weren't running it on Kinect or whatever.
Because, right, Fable 3 is supposed to have some Kinect stuff, supposedly.
But they weren't really showing any of that on the floor.
So I've got to be honest.
I didn't see a whole lot that was really different from Fable 2, and most of the people I talked to, same thing, but, I mean, that's not really a bad thing, Fable 2 was a great game, it was one of the better games that came out that year it came out, so, more of the same in this case, not necessarily a bad thing, and I'm sure there's some other stuff, like, you know, it seemed to be like there was a couple more interactions and things you could choose from, so, I mean, that part of it's cool, so...
That was pretty much my impressions of Fable 3.
I'll check that out when it comes out too.
So while Rob was playing Fable 3, I was just around the corner playing Crackdown 2.
And seriously, it was just Crackdown.
That's all it was.
And it was a 30 minute demo, which I actually didn't spend the whole 30 minutes playing, but I definitely could have easily.
It was still fun.
It was hilarious.
And there were agility orbs, and that's all you need in a Crackdown game.
I didn't play a whole lot of the first game, so this might be a new feature, but you can capture points and then call helicopters down to give you more weapons.
And the more proficient you are with guns, the better weapons you get.
So it actually really made me want to get one of those sleek new 360s.
So I was happy with it, and I guess it comes out in a couple months, or next month.
What's wrong with the old 360s?
Why can't you just get one of the old 360s?
They aren't the shiny new ones.
Plus, I would like to have a wireless adapter and this one's built in instead of paying an extra hundred dollars.
Dollars?
Dollars.
So in other words, what they really should have had the first time.
Yes, and if it breaks it can't red ring technically because there are no red lights inside.
So if it breaks it's going to be three green rings of death.
or hopefully they've just built it this time so it doesn't break.
But that's another issue altogether.
I'm digressing a little bit.
So what is next on our list?
Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
You know, the demo was limited.
It only had about, what, 8, 10 characters?
I don't remember.
I mean, I guess that's still a lot.
10 characters was as many as they had in the original Street Fighter, right?
No, the original Street Fighter was just 8.
Anyway.
Okay.
It was cool.
It was very stylistic, you know, as a lot of you guys have seen in the trailers.
To me, it plays just like Marvel vs. Capcom 2.
Keep in mind, I'm not on my up and up on fighting games, so I'm not the best authority to talk about these types of games.
But to me, it played a lot like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, but definitely had that more like kind of like Cell style that you've seen in a lot of the commercials.
Not as much of the 2D, 3D switching as I would have thought based on the trailer and the fact that it kind of was supposed to be a little more Street Fighter 4, I thought.
So, graphically, you know, it's kind of like a souped-up arcade release, but I think it's going to be pleasing for the fans.
And some of the supers do the 3D thing a little bit, at least it was in the demo, but again, early, early, early build, and then had huge lines going for it all day at the Capcom booth.
The trick to getting to play the game quickly was to go to Microsoft's booth, or even Sony's booth, and play the game there, which is what we did.
I really liked it.
I'm not a huge fan of the Marvel vs. Capcom games.
I already like Capcom vs. SNK.
But the one thing I noticed about it is because of the size of the characters and the screen amount that you have to play in, it felt like the game was going a little too fast compared to the other ones.
Sometimes it was kind of hard to keep up with what was going on.
and as a button masher because I don't know how to play Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and I picked, I think, all new characters except for Iron Man.
Chris Redfield sucks.
Like, utterly, utterly terrible character.
Slow and just awful.
But Dante was really cool.
I will definitely, when I play this game, will be playing as Dante.
Awesome.
Yeah, I pretty much played with standard characters.
Felicia, Morgan...
Ryu, all that fun stuff.
All right, so I finally made good on my promise to get some hands-on with the PlayStation Move.
Unfortunately, the line to get to all the really good games was really long.
But some of the like littler games that didn't have quite the, you know, like the bowling game and some other stuff didn't have quite the long lines to get to them.
So the game I got to play was the Toy Story game, which, you know, it's not a bad game.
There's certainly an audience for it.
It's definitely directed at a younger audience.
Thanks for watching!
You know, it's more of a point the move at the screen.
It doesn't even use the second controller.
It's just the one stick and you just kind of aim it at the screen and shoot.
Very logical.
But you know, I was able to at least kind of get my hands on it.
I like the way that controller kind of felt to hold.
It is a little weird with the whole like lollipop look that it has.
And it's kind of funny because when you shoot a certain square in the Toy Story game, it'll activate rapid fire.
So you just hold down the button to shoot the balls everywhere at the targets.
But your little ball on the top of your controller starts spazzing out and turning all these rainbow colors.
It's all pretty.
So kids will get a kick out of it if you have one of those households where
you know mom and dad really like to play their more hardcore PlayStation games but you want some stuff for the kids too I think that's going to fit in very nicely with the collection or if you're you know a Disney nut or you really like Midway Mania it was it was cute although I didn't I gotta be honest I was talking to the demo guy about a bunch of like other things besides just the game so I couldn't tell you like how extensive the game's gonna be but you know what it's it's a Toy Story game it's you know what you're gonna get
On the other hand, when I got to play The Move, I went to a more, I don't know, real game, and I ended up playing Time Crisis, the new one.
I don't remember the subtitle.
Oh well.
It was great.
The Move controller works really well for Time Crisis.
It's a very, very quick game.
in response time when you move it around.
I was getting headshots left and right.
I had no problems playing it.
In fact, I kind of played, I guess you could consider it twice, because I played with two different people next to me.
I just didn't want to leave.
And I always totally outdid the other people.
But I did talk to the rep that was there, and he told me that the game is not only going to have the on-rails shooter like we all know from Time Crisis, but it will also have one part of the game where you can just move around and shoot things too.
So you're not stuck to those rails.
And also, he informed me that the retail copy will come with a move-enhanced version of Time Crisis 4.
So you kind of get three games in one.
Which is great, because Time Crisis 4, if it's free, it's good.
I mean, it's a terrible, terrible Time Crisis game.
But this new one is really fun, so I'm excited.
One of the cool things real quick about it was that the button on the top of the controller acted like your foot pedal in the arcade so you would release it when you want to reload and keep your shield up and then you would hold it down and then press the trigger button on the underside of the controller when you'd want to fire.
Now if you take Time Crisis off the rails though, is it still really Time Crisis?
I don't know I can't see me playing that off the rails section of the game that much because it did sound like they were two completely separate parts of the game like you can just play the rails game or you can play the free roaming one I don't know how the free roaming one will work and it'll require for sure at least the what the Sony nunchuck whatever it's called to move around because I don't think you can really move around with just the move controller
The Navigation Controller, if I'm not mistaken, is what they call it.
I like to call it the, I think it was like Balancing Rock from WarioWare, Smooth Moose, because those little intro things are hilarious.
And here's the microphone back.
Alright, so we went over to Nintendo's booth for a little bit and caught up on some of the stuff besides the 3DS.
Although we did spend a heck of a lot of time with the 3DS again, which I'll let Shane start in a minute, but I do want to talk about the other games we got our hands on real quick.
Some of the stuff we've been kind of teasing on the Sunday show a little bit, Wii Party, which I know Loki was kind of making fun of because, oh my gosh, another minigame collection on the Wii.
Who would have thought?
But this appears to be probably one of the bigger Wii titles they're going to push this holiday, at least for the family unit.
And it did seem like there were tons of minigames, but not necessarily like the same stuff you would see in other games.
It seemed like you would have these

Well, it's not my fault you're terrible at Wii Party and you don't take direction well.
But anyway, we were playing this thing where there was a boat and you didn't want to tip the boat over.
But you had to play little mini-games to get the people that you would put on the boat.
And if you passed the mini-game, they would be the same weight.
But if you didn't pass the mini-game, they would be fat and skinny.
and that's bad.
You don't want that.
But it's really funny when the boat tips over and everybody falls in.
That was my favorite part.
So it was almost like worth it to lose miserably.
So that was Wii Party.
I'm going to be honest.
I don't know if this is one I would necessarily buy because I don't have a lot of parties at my one bedroom apartment.
But I think for the people, if you are getting a lot of use out of Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort and the other major Nintendo releases for party games, this is kind of a next logical step that I'm sure will end up in a lot of households.
I liked Wii Party a whole lot.
My only thing about it is if they try to charge $50 for it and not throw in like an extra controller or something, it's not worth it.
It was really fun, but like $25 fun.
Nothing higher than that.
But after we moved on from Wii Party, we went to the Mario Sports Mix game, which was interestingly enough on the tile screen showed that it was
in part developed by Square Enix, so what the crap.
It had volleyball and basketball on it, and we played volleyball, and Rob was terrible.
But I was really good because I got us some points, and I was very good at blocking the shots from coming over.
It was fun.
The volleyball was a blast.
I kind of wish we had demoed the basketball too, but the volleyball had really simple controls, and it was a good time.
It's unfortunate that Shane would lie like that and say that I'm so terrible when I was the only one running around grabbing all the power-ups, but that's okay.
Here's the thing though, I gotta be honest, the game was almost a little too simple for me.
This is really a kid's game, and you know, it's fine for that audience, but you know, I think for the rest of us,
I think a lot of people are just going to see it as like, woo, more of the Wii Sports type of stuff.
You know, again, if you have that mixed household that has the kids and the teenagers maybe even that would get a kick out of this, it would probably be worth it.
Before the quote-unquote hardcore gamer, which is probably most of the folks that listen to this show, I couldn't really take Mario Sports Mix seriously.
And, you know, they try to incorporate some of the Mario elements into it, like the red shells, you know, and cute little things like that, but I couldn't take it seriously.
Which I think is unfortunate because I think it'd be a good relaxing game.
Again, not a $50 game, which they will charge for it, but a pretty good one just to kind of hang out and do nothing.
Well, if I want to play a relaxing game, I'll just play Wii Relax, which was totally absent from E3 this year.
Who would have thought?
It was like Nintendo knew to keep Cammy Dunaway and the Wii Vitality Sensor away from E3 so nobody would get mad at them, which is great.
But moving on to the most important part of the show, I think, we went back through the 3DS line.
which was fantastic to actually get to go back through and really spend some quality time with some of the games, demos, and videos.
I will say that they had a DJ Hero game on there, which I didn't even really realize.
I know they had mentioned it before, but I didn't know it was up there to play.
I was so pumped when I saw it.
I hopped right over, and it is an amazing game.
It's all the bottom screen, the touchscreen.
You have three tracks still, but you only have the little note circles in the middle.
So you just tap the screen wherever you want for that.
And then to slide...
You are a crossfader to the left or right.
You slide the stylus on the screen.
And it was really good.
And the 3D effects made it kind of neat to see the track, so to speak, come at you as you're playing.
And you played the DJ Hero, didn't you?
No, no, he's shaking his head, so I guess I won't have the mic back over.
I also played the Professor Layton game.
It was like Mirror of Something working title, so whatever.
Professor Layton 3DS, there we go.
It was cool.
It was Professor Layton, but instead of the typical static screen where you touch things to find clues, you have a 3D screen on top and you can use this magnifying glass on the bottom screen.
You move it around and your magnifying glass will change into an orange filled magnifying glass if you find something to technically click on.
That was cool.
The puzzle that you got while playing was just the standard Professor Layton puzzle.
I had to put a robot together.
So it wasn't anything big.
And I didn't really use the 3D.
But that was okay, because it was still really fun in Professor Layton.
I also played Pilotwings.
It was just a short demo.
I flew a plane through some rings.
It kind of felt like Wii Sports Resort, more so than Pilotwings, but that's what they've been making recently.
So, hey, here's Rob.
Sorry, I ran to the other room real quick.
Can I comment real quick, though, on Professor Layton?
Because I also checked this out.
I don't play the Professor Layton games, though.
It was...
Let me explain though, when you were up there demoing the 3DS, it was just a lot, probably all those women you saw at the press conference were now sitting up on the 3DS stage where you would go up there and they all had DSs tied to them, but the only kind of like problem was there were no signs saying what game was where.
So you kind of would just walk up to women and see what game they had, you know, which, you know, it's hard to kind of walk away too once you kind of get sucked into a game.
So I checked out Professor Layton even though I don't know the DS games at all like Shane does.
But I will say the one thing I noticed was that the 3D effects were probably the most sharp of almost anything that I demoed.
You know, my 3D can sometimes be really picky, but I thought Layton had probably some of the best 3D that I saw.
Even though it wasn't like gimmicky 3D, like pop-out things shooting at you, I thought it was just kind of some of the sharpest 3D.
And I think the art style of Professor Layton really is a good match for the way they did the 3D.
It was almost like a pop-up book, so to speak.
So I was saying, yeah, Pilotwings, it's just kind of Wii Sports Resort.
It was fun.
Then I played Ridge Racer.
Didn't really care for it.
I think it's the first handheld Ridge Racer I did not like.
But you played some of Ridge Racer, didn't you?
Yeah, I mean, the controls were kind of dopey, like, and just it was not realistic at all when you would run into walls.
I'm trying not to be too harsh, though, because, you know, early, early, early, I think it's more of a concept than anything like the actual game.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I really, really think it's unfair to judge a whole game based off these very, very conceptual demos.
This just wasn't one that made me jump up and down like some of the other concept demos did.
I would say we have to say maybe conceptual demos because we don't know when these games are coming out and some of them actually felt pretty polished for demos.
I guess that's true.
If this is the game, though, I would totally pass on it until the Mario Kart game comes out, as far as I'm concerned.
Let's see, one of the games I checked out was Kingdom Hearts, although it was not really a game.
It was just kind of a concept thing where you would watch pre-rendered video.
So really all I can say about it was that it was kind of like watching the opening on the PS2.
I mean, it was...
The 3D was, you know, there wasn't a lot going on, but I was more impressed that, wow, this is like PlayStation 2 style graphics on the DS.
That was, you know, not quite at that caliber, but almost.
Definitely a step above where it was at before, so that was pretty awesome.
One of the other games I played that I think Shane didn't was Samurai Warriors, which was like half video, half playable demo.
And that was cool.
I mean, the playable demo was very simple.
It was just kill 50 warriors really quick.
But the 3D was, they used a lot of it.
And, you know, not just the depth and running around killing the warriors, but then like, you know, little anime overlays would come up when you do special moves and those kind of pop out.
And I thought that was pretty cool.
and a game I know I played that Rob didn't was Nintendogs plus cats.
Unfortunately they didn't have the cats but they did have a couple breeds of dogs.
I actually did switch between breeds just to see if there's any real differences.
It was Nintendogs.
Probably the coolest thing about it was when I threw the ball and the ball went 3D into the back and then he came running
Back With It, and you know, it was 3D and Nintendogs.
It's going to be boring after a few days, but you know, the first couple days you'll really enjoy it.
I also saw a few videos, and I'll just quickly hit on those.
Paper Mario, beautiful game.
It is like a pop-up book.
It was really cool.
Metal Gear, amazing.
I hear a lot of people think it's one of the best videos on the floor.
I can agree.
You could move the camera around.
It'll look like a PS2 game, but in 3D.
It's really neat.
I saw Dead or Alive on videos, just really briefly, because I was like, I don't care about Dead or Alive.
But graphically, it looked pretty nice.
And then the worst video goes to Resident Evil, because for some reason...
I could not find the right angle to look at it I looked at it straight on like every other demo and sometimes it would be you know in focus and sometimes it would be crazy couldn't understand why but that was my entire 3d oh no wait I took pictures with the 3d camera they had that off to the side I had to hunt for it and those were really cool you can actually adjust
Like, you know, with the slider, how the 3D looks, but there was also like an option to toggle how the actual 3D looks instead of just making a flat image, you could kind of change the perception on the 3D image itself.
I'm kind of pissed I didn't see that, because that was one of the few things I really, really wanted to see.
Let's see, out of those that you talked about, I also saw the Resident Evil one, and I also had a difficult time really seeing the 3D in it, but graphically, wow.
Wowie wow, I mean, I don't know if that was pre-rendered video, I'm assuming it was, but if not, wowie wow.
Otherwise, I think the only other game I can think of off the top of my head was Sims 3 that I saw on the DS and the only real feature they were showing off was again about picture taking.
You could actually take a picture of yourself using the camera and it would model your face on the character.
I don't think though, I haven't played the DS one that's out there now, but I'm pretty sure it has that same feature, at least for the DSi.
So, you know, whatever's.
Until I heard that the line was four hours towards the end of the day, I did want to go back because I somehow missed the Star Fox demo.
I really, really wanted to play that because I heard nothing but good things.
So I apologize to anybody that wants to hear it.
I really wanted to play it, but just missed it.
Ditto.
I just wanted to get my hands on as much stuff as possible.
Even if it was games I wasn't super familiar with, I just wanted to see as much 3D as possible.
Some of the pre-rendered videos, though, they had were really impressive.
What they kind of did to really help the line situation was that they actually had gals walking around the line a little bit, kind of showing off the DSs they had.
So you could actually see the three DSs before you really got on the stage.
But all they would show was just like some pre-rendered concept videos.
But man, there was one, and I know Shane feels differently about this one, but there was one with like a champagne cork popping up.
and like all the confetti and streamers would pop out of the bottle.
And it was the one thing where I really felt like the images were not going in a hall or whatever, like the depth is going back.
I felt like the images were really popping out.
Like it was really astounding.
My favorite thing from that video, and you're right, I did not like the champagne bottle popping with the streamers.
Not because I thought it was terrible looking, it just kind of made me a little bit dizzy feeling because of the way my eyes were focusing on it.
But they had a pre-rendered picture that you can move around of Pikmin, and I love Pikmin, and that made me really, really, really need a Pikmin game for this 3DS.
I'm sure you'll get it.
There's like everything else coming out.
So, alright, what else to kind of wrap up here besides 3DS did we get our hands on?
The what?
The Square Booth?
Oh, we want to talk a little Final Fantasy XIV?
The four, okay, Shane's telling me to talk about the Four Heroes of Light.
Well, I didn't play a whole lot of it.
I mean, I don't really know what it's today.
It felt like the other Final Fantasy games that are on the DS right now.
I guess the big thing is H.A.T.S.,
you put on hats and it changes your jobs and anybody can be like any job so I guess maybe it's got like a five thing going with it but I really didn't spend enough time with a floor demo to really comment any further I think if you like the Final Fantasy 3 and 4 on DS this is probably right up your alley
I played it a little bit too.
Unfortunately, the demo I picked up, somebody had just finished playing and they died.
So one of my characters was dead and I had no magic to use, so it was really boring to me.
But for me, the 3DS versions of the Final Fantasy games felt too slow, and this one was no exception, so I was not really digging it.
You're just a hater.
But I will say this.
I thought it was really cute how in the demo they definitely had programmed it as an E3 demo.
It really reminded me of a few years ago there was a Katamari Damacy game coming out that was specifically for E3 and the king would talk about E3 and stuff.
That was kind of similar to this little demo they had.
The little characters in the village talked about, you know, we worked really hard on this demo.
We hope you enjoy it.
It was really funny.
I like cute little things like that.
It makes the demo games feel that much more special.
That's like the ghost trick demo that we played.
They had a lot of references to how it was just a demo, that the retail version would be different, and that was fun.
And oh my god, the dog in that game is adorable.
I know we've already talked about it, but it was great.
Now let's bring this podcast down a little bit.
I went to play Final Fantasy XIV.
The good news is the character creation is fun.
It's got some really nice options.
Especially if you played XI, you know you were very limited in what you can do.
But this one gives you not a whole bunch more options, but far more than you ever had in Final Fantasy XI.
I had highlights in my hair that were blue.
I could change...
to many different hairstyles, many different eye colors, many different skin colors.
They also had adjustable voices, adjustable features like scars and stuff like that, and nose and chins and mouth options.
It was crazy.
The bad news is the combat is awful.
Absolutely terrible.
They told us that the beta build that we were playing was different from the current alpha that players are playing right now.
The combat is one of the most clunky combat schemes I've ever seen, and I played Final Fantasy XI, so I know clunky combat.
So what they had us do was get into a party and start this thing called a guild leave, which was awesome.
It's a quest where you can select different styles of play like solo, duo, party, something else, and like all your servers.
something like that for difficulty so you can get better rewards or maybe do a quicker quest and still do the same quest but they had three of us join up as a group and we had to go kill crabs
So we found the crabs after some terrible walking with bad cameras, but they said the cameras will be fixed, so hopefully that's true.
Found the crabs.
The first thing you have to do before you initiate battle is unsheathe your weapon.
Not a big deal.
Then you have to target your enemy by clicking on it.
and so on.
So once you do that and you make sure your enemy's targeted, you will unleash attacks.
The combat though is so fast that you just don't have time to really think about what you're doing.
And there's no on-screen text besides in your little chat log to tell you if you're too far away or if you can't perform that action.
constantly I thought I had the enemy targeted but I accidentally clicked on myself so nothing was happening but I didn't really realize this because there were not enough on-screen commands to tell me I was doing something wrong I really really hope they fix that because I mean I'll still get the game I won't be able to help myself but
It's going to make the game a little less fun for me if I can't even attack an enemy.
Granted, I was a class I never would have played to begin with, the gladiator class.
I definitely would have been the mage or the lancer had I known I just had to sit at a different chair.
But, I don't know, I don't have high hopes for the combat, especially since it's just not that great.
Here's the thing, I think Shane is being a little harsh on the game.
I will say this, just I observed, because Shane wouldn't let me play, but the game was beautiful, oh my god, it was so pretty to look at, especially for an MMO, I thought it was great.
I just think that, I think this is a game that is very hard for Square to demo at an expo like E3.
I think a game like this takes a big learning curve, and I think that's part of the reason Shane had a lot of problems, is that I think he got thrown right into this thing,
and kind of was being told okay do this now this now this now this you know I'm almost kind of like you know what the dude should have just sat there and played it we should have watched I mean I think it was just too much for Shane to kind of like have to do it once I think when you play the actual game you'll kind of learn how to do it piece by piece like remember how the biggest complaint about 13 it takes forever to unfold well you know a lot of it's teaching you a little piece of the game at a time and I just think the way they demoed it
Kind of bit them a little bit.
I think when the actual game comes out, it won't bug Shane as much.
That's just personal knowledge.
Yeah, and I can kind of agree with that.
I still would like to see a little bit more of the interface change.
Like, if I'm too far away from an enemy, I don't need a little box in the corner telling me that.
I need something on screen.
Might be because I'm used to WoW, but that effective...
The other thing that I would like to see changed and could probably have helped a lot is the pointer on screen was not very smooth.
Like you would move your mouse and then the pointer would move very slowly.
Not responsive compared to what you're moving on the mouse.
If they can speed that up, get it to a 1 to 1 ratio on your movement speed, it'd probably help a little bit more.
But by the time I was able to click on the button to go use my TP, the fight was over, and it kind of sucked.
Again, though, I think that's a problem with the demo, not the game.
I've heard it's the same for the alpha, but it might still be alpha-related.
Well, I will say this, you know, as somebody who sunk a couple years into Final Fantasy XI, conceptually, I really like a lot of the things they did with XIV.
Like, I just think I can really see where they've tried to make an effort to have things more solo-able, like with these guild lives, with the different levels of difficulty.
I thought that was really cool, and I just, I loved how
The quest start was right there.
The quest turn in was right there when you finished.
Everything was very instant gratification.
Those of you that have played XI know it's a lot of walking and running around and slow moving game.
It definitely feels like they've kind of picked up the pace a little bit in XIV.
Conceptually, I was really a fan of the stuff they implemented that I saw.
Another cool thing, because I'm not all boohoo on this game, especially after today we watched the trailer on Rob's TV.
And like I told him, I was like, well, this trailer just changed my mind.
I'm going to play again.
And it was just cut scenes.
But another cool thing about the guild leaves is that if you're someone that likes to grind in games and just not read anything, any enemies you have to kill for guild leaves have little guild leave markers next to their name.
So you know you can avoid everybody else and just focus on those same enemies.
though that does bring me to another thing I forgot to mention is that when we were killing the crabs because that's what we had to do one crab before it died started to run away and those suckers move fast and I could not catch up and part of the way you regain health is you sheath your weapon well you've got to stop to sheath your weapon the animation forces you to so he's still running away I'm trying to sheath my weapon so it stops me he's getting farther ahead and
I probably would not have known where to go unless the representative had told me where to go because I lost sight of him.
Something to keep in mind though, didn't you want the crabs to run ahead?
Because didn't they take you to a room that had the other monsters in it that you needed to kill?
It almost seemed like that was part of it.
It did seem like it was part of it, but one thing, and I'm not sure because I was one of the people that didn't read the leave at all because it wasn't on my screen.
Until we actually got to that room where we had to kill water elementals too, the water elementals did not appear as part of the quest as what I had to kill.
It wasn't until I got to that room where their name appeared below my crabs I've killed
So, I don't know if that triggered more to the quest, or if it just didn't show up until I got closer to those enemies.
Hmm, interesting.
Alright, well, let's move on from Final Fantasy XIV and talk about some of the other games we saw.
I know Civilization V was another game we had a little time to sit down and have a demo done for us.
We didn't get to play it.
But it was a really gorgeous game.
Of course they had it running on their best system, but you can...
The Hexagonal Shift is kind of new.
There's a new...
thing that they put in there, and I'm terrible, I forgot the name of it, and I should have taped the thing yesterday so I could remember, but they reminded me of like talent trees in Diablo or WoW, where as you put your points in these certain trees, it kind of has this effect on your civilization, which I thought was kind of neat.
Thank you for watching!
It's not that I don't care for the Civilization series, it's more that I don't do strategy games.
I don't have the patience nor the, I'm guessing, brainpower to do them.
But I'm glad I watched the Civ 5 demo because it actually looked really interesting.
It looked kind of like a SimCity style game, and I know it's not.
but there were so many aspects that you can focus on in that game instead of just all out battling it look like that it might be something I give a shot it was funny and like I said with Dead Rising I'm scared of zombies but the game was funny so I'm probably going to play it Civ 5 I'm scared of strategy games but it was funny so I'm probably going to try it alright whatever makes it work huh
Alright, I guess the very last game there is to talk about is Puzzle Quest 2!
Yeah, I know, we saved the best for last.
No, I mean, it was cute.
Although, yeah, the main battle is more of the same.
But, hey, hold on.
There seems to be a lot more mini games.
That's one of the first things I noticed.
Like, you know, in the original Puzzle Quest, there were games that you would do to, like, take over the cities and all that stuff.
It seems like they've built more of those types of games in Puzzle Quest 2, and that's one of the biggest differences I noticed off the bat.
And you can play those mini games on demand, which was cool, too.
I'm kind of dumb, because I just remembered a really good thing to have tested out on Puzzle Quest 2 was the campaign mode, because I know it was there.
I just went to Quick Battle, but yeah, it was more of the same.
Graphically, nothing really changed.
We played the DS version, just so you know.
We had people next to us playing the 361, whatever.
Quick Battle was just, you know, pick a character, fight a goblin, win.
Except I lost the first one.
I won the second one.
But I forgot to try the campaign mode because that's the thing that was supposed to be overhauled.
So that sucks.
Guess we'll have to wait until the full release.
Oh well.
Alright, so before we wrap up, Shane, I'll ask you kind of the same thing that I asked Bobby and put him on the spot with.
What was the thing that most surprised you about E3?
Um, this is actually easy.
The 3DS.
And we all knew it was coming.
Didn't know in what form.
And, you know, I was one of the skeptical people.
I knew I'd buy it regardless because it's Nintendo handheld.
You can't go wrong.
But I was surprised by the...
I don't know how much it really changed some of those games to me.
Seeing DJ Hero with the track coming at you was such an interesting idea compared to just seeing it flat, kind of scrolling down the screen.
Seeing freaking Nintendogs, you know, not the best of demos, but just kind of seeing that they had this 3D version of it and, you know, being able to see the ball go in the distance and then come back in his mouth.
It was just really interesting.
I was really surprised by how much I ended up liking that little system.
for me probably two things number one I think what most people are probably thinking and surprise them about E3 even sitting at home Microsoft's and Nintendo's switching places this year where Microsoft was totally catering to the casual crowd and Nintendo finally gave I think what a lot of us were bitching about the past two years what we finally wanted yeah Kid Icarus namely you know in the 3DS and just Reggie getting out there and going and here's a game and here's a game and here's a game and now you shut the fuck up about how bad the Wii is
that's really what his press conference was it's pretty cool um and you know and then Microsoft just kind of you know really kind of putting all their chips on the casual market so we'll see how it pays off for him I don't know I'm interested in some of the extra gaming I gotta say the exercise gaming or whatever it's called not feeling so much on the casual titles that are coming out for Kinect so we'll see if the gamble pays off and then Sony's just Sony's just kind of doing their thing and you know now Valve's there and now they're gonna have motion and
but unfortunately for Sony I don't think there's a whole lot on the motion controller I feel like I have to have I'm not going to buy one because there's nothing I really want to play that needs the motion controller but I will buy LittleBigPlanet 2 that's for damn sure
I'd like to comment real quick about the role reversal.
This E3, everybody knows that before this E3 it's Microsoft vs. Sony with Nintendo doing their own thing.
Now it seems like it's Microsoft vs. Nintendo with Sony doing their own thing.
It's very interesting how everything just kind of switched with Microsoft still being like...
I'm going to bite off you and not care about these other people.
Just like they were doing with Sony to Nintendo and now Nintendo to Sony.
And in your comment in regards to the move, I always feel like if I can find one game that I know I will play a lot of for a system or accessory, I will get it.
And that will be Time Crisis.
That's enough for me to justify at least a move controller.
Maybe not the move Balancing Stone or whatever it's called.
Oh, we'll see.
Maybe there'll be a game that'll change my mind.
Maybe it's Sing Star Dance.
Who knows, but I somehow doubt it.
Alright, the thing that most surprised me otherwise, DC Universe.
I was like so, I just was loving that game and it's not, I was really caught by surprise.
I thought it was just going to be like another MMO I wouldn't really give a second thought to, although I thought the cross-platform was cool.
Um, but yeah, I definitely want to check that game out when it comes out now.
But you know what always happens to games we call one of the best of E3.
I'm not saying DC Universe is necessarily best of E3.
I think that prize would really go to 3DS, but, um, you know, uh, it usually happens with our best of E3 picks.
They come out and they're not so great.
Remember Nintendogs, anybody?
Um, okay, so, Shane, what about the thing that disappointed you the most?
Would it be, like, Microsoft, like a lot of people at home are thinking, or...
No, I wouldn't say it was Microsoft, because I'm not a huge fan of theirs anyway.
I was actually kind of happy with them in terms of their new hardware.
Finally getting that wireless adapter built inside instead of having another $100 attachment to pay for.
I would say what really disappointed me, this E3, was the lack of playable demos for big games.
If you didn't have an appointment, you couldn't play Guitar Hero, you couldn't play DJ Hero 2, you couldn't play the new Call of Duty, you couldn't play anything at Bethesda.
Portal 2 wasn't even anywhere in playable form and that's a huge title.
There was no announcements for Dragon Age 2, which has already gotten a release date.
Thank you Dragon Age Awakening for bundling that in and teasing me.
So I was just disappointed at the lack of playable big titles, or even titles that have been previously mentioned and were nowhere on the floor.
I'll pretty much agree with what Shane's saying as far as the biggest disappointment, but I'll just sum it up all in one game.
The one game I would have really liked to play on the show floor, that Child of Eden game, looked pretty badass, and I really wanted to check that out, and I was extremely disappointed I wouldn't be able to.
Also, there was a huge line for Metroid Other M, because it's the one thing in Nintendo I didn't end up playing, because I didn't want to sit in that line.
So, I'll just have to check it out when the game comes out.
So, you know, we've kind of had 3DS dominate a lot of the conversation we've had over the past couple days.
So Shane, I'll give you one more reason to talk about it.
When do you think this system is going to come out and how much?
Place your bets.
Okay, so it's Nintendo.
They've never done a system that's been over $300.
They've never done a handheld that's been over $200.
Actually, $190 I think is the max they've gone with this DSi XL.
I will say...
I would hope the system comes out at $200 because I don't think they'll go lower than that.
But I would expect the system to come out at $250 because of the technology and all the stuff it can do.
As for when it comes out, they've already said it'll be by the end of the fiscal year, which will be March 2011.
I will say, and it'll be wrong, but I'll say in America we'll get it this holiday.
My only reasoning for that is because Nintendo has nothing for this holiday at all.
They have nothing to compete with the Move, nothing to compete with Kinect.
I think the only real holiday titles they have coming are Donkey Kong, which I don't think is big enough to support the Wii, and Wii Party, which is definitely not big enough to support the Wii this holiday.
and then for DS, Golden Sun.
And I'm not even sure if that's towards the holiday or if it's just standard fall.
So I'm going to go with $250 realistically and this holiday.
I'm going to say Nintendo goes all the way to March 2011.
Actually, no, I'm going to say February 2011.
Maybe they'll do like a Valentine's Day thing.
I don't know.
I'm going to say February 2011.
I will also say $250, but you will get a bundle in game and movie.
I think they're going to try to sweeten the pot with some nice bundles.
Although the game will not be Kid Icarus, so don't get your hopes up.
The game will be something else, and the movie will be one of those Disney things that are being demoed out on the floor.
Although, well, maybe not.
I guess it might have to be something Nintendo related, but we'll see.
I think they'll do that.
Or maybe like
You know what it'll be?
It'll be a bunch of like 3D movie trailers.
There'll be like one cartridge that's just like 3D experience and it's gonna be all these movies and things we saw on the show floor just in one cartridge.
I bet it'll be that and then like a game.
And then I'm saying February 2011, and I'm just going to say Reggie's going to try to push all those Wii titles for the holiday season.
I think, I disagree with Shane, I think Wii Party, as much as we don't think is enough to sustain them through their holiday season, I think that's going to be their big holiday push.
And then for the hardcore crowd, they're going to be like, hey, you got GoldenEye, and you got Kirby over here, and all this other stuff.
So I think, yeah, GoldenEye was this year, right?
The demo we played felt really done, so...
I would think Goldeneye's maybe this year.
I hear that the Zelda demo felt really done too, and that's not until next year.
Thanks, Nintendo.
Oh, I was going to say, I thought you meant Zelda on the 3DS, and I was going to go, well, there's maybe your pack-in game.
That, no, because they can make tons of money off of that.
I was thinking maybe Nintendogs, and I'm like, nope, that'll make a ton of money.
There's nothing that Nintendo showed that they would pack in.
Maybe another Metroid Prime First Hunt or something.
Again, I think it's going to be the 3D buffet.
It's basically all the demos we saw on one cartridge.
I wouldn't put it past them, though, to do Nintendogs plus cats.
Why not?
They did a Nintendogs bundle before.
maybe but I think that was after the game had already come out and it was for like a special Thanksgiving bundle I feel like they could make too much money off that and I didn't think about this but the price of the games I wonder if they'll be higher than the DS or not because they're on new it is a new format it looks like the cartridges do look a little different I have a picture it's not the same of course they'll be more expensive of course
About $5 to $10 more expensive.
No, I can do $5, I can't do $10.
I do not want $50 handheld games.
I'm sick of $40 ones already.
Alright, let's wrap up.
The thing you most want to see at E3 2011, or one thing you want to see changed for E3 2011.
What I want to see changed?
Not what game I want to see?
Either.
I'll do both.
I want less closed doors.
You know, if it's a press event, all the press should be able to see whatever.
You shouldn't have to make an appointment.
You should have a press-only area, but not an appointment.
Second thing I want to see, or game I want to see?
Uncharted 3.
I don't even know.
Next year I want to see them reopen Kensha Hall and not use it as a parking lot.
That would be pretty cool.
Help thin out the crowds a little bit and give the indies and foreign companies more place to grow.
I think it would be really cool.
And I would like to see some of the game companies that are too good for booths these days come back.
That's what I would like to see happen.
And yeah, I'm kind of with Shane.
I get the appointment thing though I understand especially with something like 14 I think they should have done that by appointment I think they should have not I think it should have been more like the Civ 5 thing where someone else demoed it but that's just me I get it sometimes so anyway that's it we're going to wrap up and call it a podcast thank you guys for listening to these special podcasts I know the audio quality has been kind of crap compared to the shows I know you guys miss Jamie's Classic Game of the Week and Loki's Rants but don't worry it is all coming back this Sunday night
We're going to have DarkSakura and Loki and myself all kind of wrapping up E3 all over again and picking up on some of the other news that happened while the event was going on.
So that's going to do it.
Thank you so much for tuning in.
Tune loading?
Did I say tune loading?
I think I was about to say it.
Tuning in and downloading the little show.
Rob Robertson Pals, our E3 specials.
