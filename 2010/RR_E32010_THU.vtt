00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Alright, welcome back everybody to Rob Roberts and Cals here on the Orange Moms Radio feed.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.480
It's our E3 wrap up show.

00:11.480 --> 00:15.960
The final day, yes sadly E3 2010 is all done.

00:15.960 --> 00:18.720
And today we're not coming to you from a hotel room.

00:18.720 --> 00:22.920
Actually right now we are in the parking lot of In-N-Out Burger where I've taken the one

00:22.920 --> 00:27.520
and only Bobby Blackwolf to his first In-N-Out experience.

00:27.520 --> 00:30.360
And Bobby, hyped.

00:30.360 --> 00:31.360
Too much, not enough.

00:31.360 --> 00:33.260
What did you think of In-N-Out?

00:33.260 --> 00:36.920
It was a burger.

00:36.920 --> 00:42.080
It's better than Wendy's and McDonald's and stuff but I'm, you know, being from the east

00:42.080 --> 00:44.560
coast I'm partial to five guys myself.

00:44.560 --> 00:47.800
I was expecting him to go, mmm that is a tasty burger.

00:47.800 --> 00:50.200
He did a little bit, he did have a little bit of that I gotta say.

00:50.200 --> 00:54.640
Alright, there's your Orange Lounge Foodio for those of you guys that have had your withdrawals

00:54.640 --> 00:55.640
during the week.

00:55.640 --> 00:59.880
We will be back of course Sunday to do the E3 wrap up with Dark Sakura and Loki.

00:59.880 --> 01:04.840
That'll all be Sunday night at All Games Radio, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

01:04.840 --> 01:09.300
But I really do urge you to tune in to the Bobby Blackwolf show who's right beforehand

01:09.300 --> 01:11.780
at 5 Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern.

01:11.780 --> 01:14.720
I don't know if that gets picked up on the mic but there was literally a plane flying

01:14.720 --> 01:15.720
over us just now.

01:15.720 --> 01:19.720
We're right by the airport to take Bobby over to the airport.

01:19.720 --> 01:22.440
We'll give you a quick little preview though of what's coming up on Bobby's show because

01:22.440 --> 01:27.200
we wanted to start the recording today before Bobby had to get on a plane and go and kind

01:27.200 --> 01:29.640
of ask Bobby, you know, what did you think of your final day?

01:29.640 --> 01:34.400
What kind of stuff did you see and what were your impressions on some of the games, Bobby?

01:34.400 --> 01:37.400
Okay, so Rock Band 3.

01:37.400 --> 01:39.360
That blew me away.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.360
All the stuff that they added.

01:40.360 --> 01:41.480
I didn't realize how much they added.

01:41.480 --> 01:46.300
I know you guys covered it already so I'm not really going to add to it right now but

01:46.300 --> 01:50.160
I will say one of the things I was able to, I played the keyboard and I played pro mode

01:50.160 --> 01:54.820
on medium, which basically means that they add, you have two notes at a time.

01:54.820 --> 01:59.080
So two note chords and everything and one thing that they don't tell a lot of people

01:59.080 --> 02:05.360
and one thing that you don't realize is that they actually do have bumps on the keys to

02:05.360 --> 02:11.640
denote where the color changes so you don't have to look at the keyboard when they shift

02:11.640 --> 02:14.360
because you can actually feel where the colors are.

02:14.360 --> 02:18.200
So I thought that was, that's like one little tiny thing, they don't really mention it,

02:18.200 --> 02:22.280
they don't say it but that adds a lot.

02:22.280 --> 02:27.920
So there was that and I also did an interview and it's going to be on E3coverage.com and

02:27.920 --> 02:33.800
I actually stumped the guy about the MIDI port because the Guitar Hero drum set has

02:33.800 --> 02:41.320
a MIDI input, kind of like what they're saying but it's not going to work for the pro mode.

02:41.320 --> 02:43.880
You could use it for the basic but you're not going to be able to use it in the pro

02:43.880 --> 02:45.600
modes of anything.

02:45.600 --> 02:51.720
So that was interesting and they are considering, it's right on the line of the Rock Band Stagekit

02:51.720 --> 02:55.080
for all five of us that have it, having Rock Band Stagekit access.

02:55.080 --> 02:58.360
So there you go, Rock Band 3, I was very impressed with it.

02:58.360 --> 03:00.520
Portal 2 is hilarious.

03:00.520 --> 03:09.240
I got to sit in on the 15 minute demo of that and they have kept the humor, they are talking

03:09.240 --> 03:14.080
to Jonathan Coulton, he admitted that to me, they are talking to him, asking him who he

03:14.080 --> 03:20.240
wants to work with to do it so he is definitely going to be a part of it for the music side.

03:20.240 --> 03:26.160
But they've kept the humor and the gameplay elements they've added with the liquids where

03:26.160 --> 03:32.120
you can either jump or slide really fast and some of the other objects that they've introduced

03:32.120 --> 03:37.600
really look like it's going to be a great title, it's going to be a stand alone title

03:37.600 --> 03:40.240
and so I'm really looking forward to that.

03:40.240 --> 03:47.160
One thing non-gaming that I saw today that probably won't interest the OLR audience as

03:47.160 --> 03:53.300
much but it's more of a glimpse of what they can do in the future is I actually got a behind

03:53.300 --> 03:57.720
the scenes demo of Kinect with the dashboard.

03:57.720 --> 04:03.740
So showing the video chat and stuff where the Kinect camera seamlessly will zoom in

04:03.740 --> 04:05.960
and out based on who's in the frame.

04:05.960 --> 04:09.300
So like if you're sitting on the couch alone it will be zoomed in on you, if somebody sits

04:09.300 --> 04:13.360
next to you on the couch it will automatically zoom out and put them in the picture, take

04:13.360 --> 04:16.700
the two of you into the picture and stuff like that, if that's the kind of thing you'd

04:16.700 --> 04:18.160
like to use.

04:18.160 --> 04:26.820
But really, ESPN integration, it's not just watching ESPN3, which ESPN3 is their online

04:26.820 --> 04:28.720
internet because ESPN doesn't...

04:28.720 --> 04:29.900
The Ocho!

04:29.900 --> 04:31.480
It's like the Ocho.

04:31.480 --> 04:36.760
Basically it's all the stuff that they have regionally that err on like regional stuff

04:36.760 --> 04:39.480
but not good enough for the national.

04:39.480 --> 04:44.440
So you can watch anything online like college football, like if it's an out-of-market team

04:44.440 --> 04:49.480
for you or if it's like a very small school or something, they probably still have it

04:49.480 --> 04:51.080
on ESPN3.

04:51.080 --> 04:57.680
And you don't just watch it, they actually ask you who you're rooting for and it actually

04:57.680 --> 04:58.680
keeps track...

04:58.680 --> 04:59.680
And here comes another plane.

04:59.680 --> 05:00.680
The plane!

05:00.680 --> 05:01.680
The plane!

05:01.680 --> 05:02.680
The plane!

05:02.680 --> 05:03.680
The plane!

05:03.680 --> 05:04.680
So it actually keeps track.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.860
They showed us USC versus Ohio State, you're gonna watch that college football game.

05:07.860 --> 05:11.040
The first thing they ask you is, who are you rooting for?

05:11.040 --> 05:16.040
And then it tells you how many people, percentages of people watching that on Xbox Live are rooting

05:16.040 --> 05:21.160
for that team and then it'll do trivia questions if you want that feature on and you're competing

05:21.160 --> 05:24.600
against the other fans while you're watching the game.

05:24.600 --> 05:29.960
And just stuff like that, if they integrated that into ESPN, maybe other things, they would

05:29.960 --> 05:31.880
be able to integrate that same thing.

05:31.880 --> 05:35.400
Do you think maybe for like, you know, women and the gays, as they say, we could get the

05:35.400 --> 05:39.000
Oscars in the same type of situation?

05:39.000 --> 05:41.760
Although I'm so over the Oscars, personally.

05:41.760 --> 05:46.200
I think that would be awesome where they would, you know, have people guess who might win

05:46.200 --> 05:47.760
and stuff and who would get the award.

05:47.760 --> 05:48.760
Who wore it best!

05:48.760 --> 05:49.760
Who wore...

05:49.760 --> 05:50.760
Yeah, and things like that.

05:50.760 --> 05:56.240
So, you know, there's very good opportunity there for that and I was very impressed with

05:56.240 --> 06:01.600
that and I got to use a little bit on the dashboard and stuff and it's gonna...

06:01.600 --> 06:04.580
You still have to take very slow, deliberate movements.

06:04.580 --> 06:07.160
You're not at the Minority Report level yet.

06:07.160 --> 06:10.520
You can't just flick around or something because you'll wind up hitting something you don't

06:10.520 --> 06:11.560
want to hit.

06:11.560 --> 06:15.440
They were taking very deliberate movements to do it.

06:15.440 --> 06:16.440
But I'm very...

06:16.440 --> 06:17.440
I'm excited.

06:17.440 --> 06:21.160
I'm one of the few people excited for Kinect for all, you know, for just the dashboard.

06:21.160 --> 06:24.860
Can I actually go back a little bit and talk about the video chat real quick?

06:24.860 --> 06:27.640
Because you know, obviously the...

06:27.640 --> 06:31.320
Not the iToy, the Xbox Vision that we had before, you know, kind of had the video chat.

06:31.320 --> 06:34.840
And you know, I realize this is way upgraded, you know, better quality, it can zoom in and

06:34.840 --> 06:35.840
out and all this stuff.

06:35.840 --> 06:39.120
But you know, one thing I found about the video chat is that I rarely used it because

06:39.120 --> 06:43.240
it's kind of, you know, it's not like a cell phone where a cell phone is always on you

06:43.240 --> 06:45.800
and you pick it up, hit a button, you're good to go.

06:45.800 --> 06:50.000
You know, I would think with a video chat, you both have to be on the 360 and then you

06:50.000 --> 06:52.560
have to, you know, kind of want to Kinect and so forth.

06:52.560 --> 06:53.560
You know, I don't know.

06:53.560 --> 06:54.560
I see...

06:54.560 --> 06:58.440
It's like I get iPhone video chat, you know, if they ever get it on 3G.

06:58.440 --> 07:04.400
But you know, I kind of sit here going, okay, that sounds cool, but am I ever really going

07:04.400 --> 07:09.080
to use Kinect video chat except the one time to say I did?

07:09.080 --> 07:10.680
You might not.

07:10.680 --> 07:11.680
Families might.

07:11.680 --> 07:14.520
Now realize it's not just 360 to 360.

07:14.520 --> 07:17.840
It's going to be with Windows Live Messenger, not at...

07:17.840 --> 07:20.720
And I believe they even said right at launch.

07:20.720 --> 07:24.800
So you'll be able to talk to somebody if they have Windows Live Messenger on their computer

07:24.800 --> 07:28.800
and a webcam, they will be able... you will be able to talk to them.

07:28.800 --> 07:31.920
Okay, now that's a big thing I wasn't considering before.

07:31.920 --> 07:35.900
I could see that now then maybe like, you know, college kids trying to talk to parents

07:35.900 --> 07:38.800
or grandmas that are, you know, getting internet enabled in this day and age.

07:38.800 --> 07:39.800
That makes a lot more sense.

07:39.800 --> 07:45.920
And they also have Bing integrated with it where you could actually select...

07:45.920 --> 07:46.920
We're going to wait for the plane.

07:46.920 --> 07:47.920
The plane!

07:47.920 --> 07:48.920
The plane!

07:48.920 --> 07:49.920
There we go.

07:49.920 --> 07:50.920
There goes the plane.

07:50.920 --> 07:55.440
So you can actually select like top videos of like, you know, entertainment stuff and

07:55.440 --> 07:57.160
you can both watch it at the same time.

07:57.160 --> 07:59.200
They call them conversation starters.

07:59.200 --> 08:03.200
So if you don't know what to talk about, somebody can select this video and it pops up in the

08:03.200 --> 08:08.000
center and so you're on each side and you can talk about that video.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
I can see it now us doing an entire episode of Orange Lounge Radio just of the Bing topic

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
selections.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.680
Oh my god, what an amazing podcast that would be.

08:16.680 --> 08:19.000
Just the Bing video chat podcast.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.280
Come on you guys, you know there's somebody...

08:21.280 --> 08:22.440
Patent pending.

08:22.440 --> 08:23.440
It's mine.

08:23.440 --> 08:24.440
Don't take it.

08:24.440 --> 08:26.000
I will sue you.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
We could do it together.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Hey, there you go.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.520
I could do it at my place, you could do it at yours.

08:30.520 --> 08:31.520
We'll record...

08:31.520 --> 08:32.520
I've got the capture equipment.

08:32.520 --> 08:33.520
Awesome.

08:33.520 --> 08:35.440
And we could make it a video podcast.

08:35.440 --> 08:37.760
There we go.

08:37.760 --> 08:42.840
One other game I played which was actually a music based game, Power Gig.

08:42.840 --> 08:44.920
I actually played this.

08:44.920 --> 08:49.240
Now this is the game and somebody even asked me about it I think on my Sunday night show

08:49.240 --> 08:50.240
last week.

08:50.240 --> 08:51.480
They'd be like, what do you think of Power Gig?

08:51.480 --> 08:54.560
I'm like, well if it teaches you how to play guitar, it'll be great.

08:54.560 --> 08:56.760
This one doesn't.

08:56.760 --> 09:01.440
It uses a real guitar, it looks like a real guitar, feels like a real guitar, but it's

09:01.440 --> 09:05.520
really still the same as Rock Band.

09:05.520 --> 09:10.320
And they actually, I didn't realize they had a drum peripheral.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.300
The drum peripheral is air drums.

09:12.300 --> 09:15.920
It's like, and since this is your crowd I can say this and they'll get it, it's like

09:15.920 --> 09:17.680
Power Power Paradise.

09:17.680 --> 09:25.480
So you have drumsticks with sensors in them that break the plane of the pads, of the sensors

09:25.480 --> 09:29.500
shooting, or the lasers shooting up or whatever.

09:29.500 --> 09:35.220
And basically there's four floor sensors that I guess are sending lasers upwards and the

09:35.220 --> 09:42.960
drumstick is sensing them and that's how it does, that's how it determines which one you're

09:42.960 --> 09:43.960
hitting.

09:43.960 --> 09:48.240
You have a bass drum pedal that sits on to the right and then you have a button, you

09:48.240 --> 09:54.440
have a pedal for your left foot that activates what they're using for star power.

09:54.440 --> 09:58.560
But basically you have to hold the sticks a very specific way, which is not the way

09:58.560 --> 10:00.380
I normally hold sticks.

10:00.380 --> 10:04.080
You have to have your thumb up because they have a little thumb groove in the drumstick

10:04.080 --> 10:05.880
and it has to be up and I don't play that way.

10:05.880 --> 10:12.320
I play, for any music geeks out there, I play matched grip, like you would in marching band.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.320
That's how I play drum sets.

10:13.320 --> 10:16.920
I don't really do the thumb up grip, which is called French grip.

10:16.920 --> 10:19.160
See I'm a nerd, band nerd.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.400
But a lot of drum set players do, so that's why they do it that way.

10:22.400 --> 10:25.680
But you have to do it that way.

10:25.680 --> 10:28.220
Because if the sensor's not going down it's not going to register.

10:28.220 --> 10:32.600
And I was having a problem getting one of the pads, the hi-hat pad to register at all.

10:32.600 --> 10:35.120
It wasn't registering most of the time, so it was not a very fun experience.

10:35.120 --> 10:39.440
But they said it was still beta hardware and it's not the final version.

10:39.440 --> 10:43.280
Can I just say though, and kind of go back a little bit again, since you invoked the

10:43.280 --> 10:47.960
name Para Para, something that kind of occurred to me today on the floor, maybe last night

10:47.960 --> 10:52.920
after we taped, I don't know, but I realize I'm kind of, this E3 is really making me eat

10:52.920 --> 10:57.760
a fat slice of humble pie because for years, literally years on this program, I've kind

10:57.760 --> 11:02.420
of sat here and said, just give up, Para Para Paradise is never coming out in the US, so

11:02.420 --> 11:06.440
you're not going to get it, it's not happening, people aren't going to get it here, so shut

11:06.440 --> 11:08.960
up already, it's not going to come out here.

11:08.960 --> 11:14.320
Enjoy its cultness and the fact that it's a very niche thing, embrace it, have fun with

11:14.320 --> 11:15.320
it.

11:15.320 --> 11:17.320
Boy did I get proved wrong.

11:17.320 --> 11:23.760
It's the most interesting thing to happen, but I swear you guys, Dance Masters is, it's

11:23.760 --> 11:24.760
Para Para Paradise.

11:24.760 --> 11:27.600
I mean, if you do the Night of Fire thing, it's the same thing.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.840
They found a way to kind of get away with it here.

11:29.840 --> 11:35.480
Now granted, it's not exactly that, but that's as close, now I will say this, and I will

11:35.480 --> 11:39.960
know I'm right, I will know I'm right, take it or leave it because this is the closest

11:39.960 --> 11:43.960
you're ever going to get for those that are Para Para Paradise fans, which I know we have

11:43.960 --> 11:50.400
some of those in the show, as years old as that is, the camera thing will be pretty cool

11:50.400 --> 11:51.400
I think.

11:51.400 --> 11:56.120
The game itself looks neat, but very interesting head to head that's going to happen with the

11:56.120 --> 12:00.080
Harmonix game too, anyway, I don't mean to go back to old topics, but anything else you

12:00.080 --> 12:01.080
want to talk about?

12:01.080 --> 12:02.080
Bobby?

12:02.080 --> 12:09.880
I'm trying to think, I did get to play Marvel Vs. Capcom 3, and for those that, I'm just

12:09.880 --> 12:12.960
going to, I'm not really going to talk that much about the game, because I only played

12:12.960 --> 12:17.480
it really once or twice, and it was button mashing and I lost, so I lost to Justin, the

12:17.480 --> 12:20.680
editor, the other guy that does E3 coverage, who was not happy.

12:20.680 --> 12:23.720
I beat him in dancing though, so I'm a better dancer.

12:23.720 --> 12:29.920
But I will say that in the interview with E3coverage.com that I did, I did invoke Curly

12:29.920 --> 12:34.520
Mustaches and Pringles and the Knicks.

12:34.520 --> 12:40.160
So if you're a fan, I invoke all of those in that interview.

12:40.160 --> 12:48.320
But I played, let's see, I don't even, I played Wii Party, because it was a short line, and

12:48.320 --> 12:52.320
played the board game, which is kind of like Mario Party without the coins.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.040
Played that for a little bit.

12:54.040 --> 12:57.800
And it was kind of interesting, basically the mini games are to determine the roll order.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.960
So that's just one of the many things in Wii Party.

12:59.960 --> 13:04.280
It could be, I'm going to rent it at least.

13:04.280 --> 13:07.880
And let's see, now I'm just stalling, because I'm trying to think if there was anything

13:07.880 --> 13:09.840
else that I saw.

13:09.840 --> 13:13.400
I don't think so, I'm in a Portal 2, hilarious.

13:13.400 --> 13:17.040
On Live, I didn't realize that On Live is live now.

13:17.040 --> 13:20.560
Like it went live probably about an hour ago, 6 PM Pacific is when they said it's going

13:20.560 --> 13:22.120
live for everybody.

13:22.120 --> 13:26.040
And I think if you're a founding member, you get one year free of On Live for the PC.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.840
And it worked on the show floor.

13:27.840 --> 13:32.040
They claimed that the server was up in Silicon Valley.

13:32.040 --> 13:36.640
I don't know if I believe them, but if it's free for a year, I might as well, I might

13:36.640 --> 13:40.040
check it out and see it on my own home connection.

13:40.040 --> 13:44.620
This is going to be huge for MacGamers, which I know is kind of an oxymoron, but no, I'm

13:44.620 --> 13:45.840
just kidding guys.

13:45.840 --> 13:49.720
The MacGamers, I mean, getting to kind of do all this streaming, this is going to open

13:49.720 --> 13:51.640
up a huge door, I think.

13:51.640 --> 13:54.940
I would think that's where On Live is going to be most successful, but just watching it

13:54.940 --> 13:59.600
on the floor, I didn't get the extensive demo you did, but I was like, is this for real?

13:59.600 --> 14:03.200
Because it does look pretty smooth and pretty nice.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.920
It's kind of one of those things that, you know on the show floor, everybody's putting

14:06.920 --> 14:09.080
on their nicest front.

14:09.080 --> 14:13.520
So I kind of wouldn't mind trying it on my home computer and see if it runs as well.

14:13.520 --> 14:17.640
Bobby, I know we're going to wrap up, get you to your flight and all that stuff.

14:17.640 --> 14:20.920
And if people want to hear more, they can tune into your Sunday night show or the one

14:20.920 --> 14:25.480
I always forget to plug because we're not on right after it, but it's also a great show.

14:25.480 --> 14:30.400
The effing show, the fnglive.net, which is a video show that you guys do.

14:30.400 --> 14:34.080
You're actually doing one Friday night, which really, by the time most people hear this,

14:34.080 --> 14:37.320
knowing what time I'm getting home tonight, it'll probably be tonight by the time most

14:37.320 --> 14:38.920
people hear this.

14:38.920 --> 14:43.320
So tune into that as well at, I believe, 5 Pacific, 8 Eastern once again.

14:43.320 --> 14:44.820
So check that out.

14:44.820 --> 14:46.760
One last question for Bobby though.

14:46.760 --> 14:51.480
One of the thing that surprised you most about, and you've been to a lot of E3s, you've been

14:51.480 --> 14:53.960
to about three times as many of them as I have.

14:53.960 --> 14:57.960
Thing that surprised you most about E3 2010, Bobby?

14:57.960 --> 15:06.280
Oh God, you're putting me on the spot here.

15:06.280 --> 15:11.160
It's kind of hard to say because I didn't see all that much because of the appointments

15:11.160 --> 15:12.160
and stuff.

15:12.160 --> 15:15.320
And you know, with Microsoft, it was all interviews.

15:15.320 --> 15:19.080
Like I never touched a game in the Microsoft booth and stuff.

15:19.080 --> 15:23.720
Maybe it was what surprised me had nothing to do with anything on the show floor, although

15:23.720 --> 15:26.840
the game that shocked me was Driver San Francisco.

15:26.840 --> 15:29.620
I didn't realize that would be that good.

15:29.620 --> 15:33.840
But that could also be a good demo just like a split second.

15:33.840 --> 15:42.120
But it's more that I need to find a way to balance appointments and then having free

15:42.120 --> 15:43.720
time to go roam.

15:43.720 --> 15:48.320
I literally only had about two and a half hours the entire week that didn't have appointments

15:48.320 --> 15:50.160
that I could actually roam the show floor.

15:50.160 --> 15:51.160
Fourth day.

15:51.160 --> 15:52.160
Yes.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.160
I could use a fourth day.

15:53.160 --> 15:57.800
I know everybody that works E3 is like, oh God, no, I don't want a fourth day.

15:57.800 --> 15:58.800
I don't.

15:58.800 --> 15:59.800
Oh my God.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.560
But everybody could fill up a fourth day of appointments too.

16:02.560 --> 16:06.240
So it's, you know, it seems it's too short.

16:06.240 --> 16:11.680
But when I wasn't media and I was just showing up as, you know, exhibits only attendee as

16:11.680 --> 16:15.680
a developer, I was usually bored by the middle of day two.

16:15.680 --> 16:21.440
And I, you know, finish up, you know, Rock Band was my last thing that I saw.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.760
You know, and I'm like, I could go another day.

16:23.760 --> 16:24.760
You know, I'm not done yet.

16:24.760 --> 16:25.760
I haven't.

16:25.760 --> 16:27.760
I mean, I'm sure there's going to be something I'm going to miss and I'm going to kick myself

16:27.760 --> 16:28.760
for missing it.

16:28.760 --> 16:34.280
Like, you know, Civ V. But yeah, I'm, I need more time.

16:34.280 --> 16:36.920
I think that was the surprise is that I need more time.

16:36.920 --> 16:37.920
All right.

16:37.920 --> 16:38.920
Good answer.

16:38.920 --> 16:39.920
I was totally putting you on the spot.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.180
That was a good answer.

16:41.180 --> 16:42.240
So thank you so much, Bobby.

16:42.240 --> 16:44.560
And we'll talk as always on Sunday night.

16:44.560 --> 16:47.960
Now, of course, Shane and I are still going to talk some games too, but we're going to

16:47.960 --> 16:49.240
go drop Bobby off at the airport.

16:49.240 --> 16:54.360
So we'll just do a little break here in the podcast-a-roo and we'll be back sometime after

16:54.360 --> 16:55.780
the grapevine on i5.

16:55.780 --> 16:57.120
So stay tuned.

16:57.120 --> 16:58.120
Okay.

16:58.120 --> 17:02.720
So we're back for the second half, although I'm kind of a terrible liar and it's almost

17:02.720 --> 17:05.520
24 hours after we did that first half.

17:05.520 --> 17:09.840
But we decided doing a podcast while trying to drive probably wasn't the best of ideas,

17:09.840 --> 17:12.000
as boring as i5 is.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.600
So yeah, we took the safe route and came home and then of course we were really tired and

17:15.600 --> 17:19.280
that's stuff we want to do today, but we still wanted to at least wrap up some of the stuff

17:19.280 --> 17:25.360
we saw on E3 day three while it's still fresh in our minds, although I find that I'm on

17:25.360 --> 17:26.360
like game overload.

17:26.360 --> 17:27.360
I played so much.

17:27.360 --> 17:30.320
And I've been playing games since I got home because Shane's like, you got to play Alan

17:30.320 --> 17:31.320
Wake.

17:31.320 --> 17:34.320
And I have been, and it's been scary and all that, but I'll talk more about that on Sunday

17:34.320 --> 17:35.320
show.

17:35.320 --> 17:40.160
But anyway, um, while Shane is still here in California, we want to, um, at least kind

17:40.160 --> 17:44.600
of go through some of the games we saw at E3 day three.

17:44.600 --> 17:48.760
And then of course we'll resume, um, you know, with all the rest of the news on Sunday night

17:48.760 --> 17:49.760
show.

17:49.760 --> 17:54.440
So say hello to Shane, everybody who is back with us here on this, uh, Rob Robertson pals

17:54.440 --> 17:56.880
Thursday kind of Friday edition.

17:56.880 --> 18:02.200
It's actually been over 24 hours since we were supposed to do it because it's now almost

18:02.200 --> 18:07.960
11 here and we stopped at like seven yesterday, but hi.

18:07.960 --> 18:11.320
You know, through the magic of radio, people would have never known, but that's all right.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.280
All right, Shane, let's get to the games.

18:13.280 --> 18:15.000
Give us some games that you want to talk about.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
All right.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.800
I actually wrote these all down in a random order, so I'll go in a random order.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.360
Um, no, I won't.

18:21.360 --> 18:22.960
Castlevania Lords of Shadow.

18:22.960 --> 18:27.480
It's the new Castlevania game coming out for the 360 and the PS3.

18:27.480 --> 18:32.640
Um, pretty much a God of War style game.

18:32.640 --> 18:38.240
The demo definitely made me want to play more of it, um, cause it had some interesting features

18:38.240 --> 18:41.880
like there's a part where you're on mounted combat and when you get knocked off, because

18:41.880 --> 18:46.680
I'm terrible at it, you have to fight through enemies before your little sparkle horse comes

18:46.680 --> 18:48.920
back so you can start writing again.

18:48.920 --> 18:53.720
Um, very graphically pretty, uh, kind of reminded me of like looking at a painting.

18:53.720 --> 18:57.560
Um, so had some slow down issues, but it's okay, I liked it.

18:57.560 --> 19:01.280
Yeah, I'm hoping some of the frame rate issues was just because it's still a beta and you

19:01.280 --> 19:05.360
know, some of these things are really hard to judge from, um, early demo builds.

19:05.360 --> 19:09.880
But um, I, the only thing that kind of got me about the game was that I think, you know,

19:09.880 --> 19:14.600
a lot of people who weren't happy with the direction Castlevania took in the like PS1

19:14.600 --> 19:22.240
and PS2 versions are, um, going to be, um, you know, really disappointed, I think by

19:22.240 --> 19:25.680
what they're doing here because it didn't really feel like a Castlevania game to me.

19:25.680 --> 19:30.800
In fact, if I remember right, I read somewhere that this game originally started as a totally

19:30.800 --> 19:35.120
different game and then they kind of, I guess retconned the Castlevania thing into it.

19:35.120 --> 19:37.440
Now it's not a, it was not a bad game by any means.

19:37.440 --> 19:42.000
I actually thought it was really cool and pretty and, and, um, enjoyable, but I think

19:42.000 --> 19:47.280
some people that were expecting the old style, you know, whipping Castlevania games are going

19:47.280 --> 19:50.360
to be in for a surprise cause Shane's right, it plays a lot more like God of War, kind

19:50.360 --> 19:53.720
of Bayonetta, it felt like a little bit to me too, um, with some of the cut scenes.

19:53.720 --> 19:57.240
But again, very pretty and I still think, um, probably going to be worth your time checking

19:57.240 --> 19:58.240
out when it comes out.

19:58.240 --> 20:02.500
Um, now if you do want kind of that old school 2D experience, I got a little time with the

20:02.500 --> 20:07.760
arcade, um, game, which is the, uh, what, Harmony of Despair, Castlevania game, which

20:07.760 --> 20:11.640
I think we had talked about a little bit the day before, but I actually hands on played

20:11.640 --> 20:15.560
it, um, on the last day of E3 and I enjoyed it.

20:15.560 --> 20:19.920
Shane, I don't think, uh, felt so favorably about it, um, but I kind of liked the whole

20:19.920 --> 20:24.160
Neo Geo effect of the zoom in and out, like if you ever played the fighting games on Neo

20:24.160 --> 20:27.560
Geo, how it kind of like zooms way in and out and stuff on the action, you can kind

20:27.560 --> 20:31.520
of control that in the Castlevania game, um, and it was very, um, you know, inspired by

20:31.520 --> 20:34.940
Symphony of the Night, which I thought was cool, um, so it's basically a race from start

20:34.940 --> 20:39.120
to finish, you have like 10 minutes to kind of get through the castle and I know the demo

20:39.120 --> 20:42.540
castle I played was kind of hard cause it seemed like there really was only one path

20:42.540 --> 20:44.840
through the castle, but I couldn't figure it out.

20:44.840 --> 20:48.280
Um, unfortunately the demo on the floor didn't give a lot of exposition as to what all the

20:48.280 --> 20:52.120
features were and the people at least where I was at, I played it at Microsoft's booth

20:52.120 --> 20:56.360
and I don't think the people there were as on the up and up on, you know, what the game

20:56.360 --> 21:01.960
was all about, so, unfortunately, um, I was a little bit kind of like lost I guess as

21:01.960 --> 21:06.560
to all the features, but you know, I enjoyed what I played, um, and you know, I'm pretty

21:06.560 --> 21:11.280
sure the arcade game will probably cost $10, maybe $15 and it'll probably be worth it,

21:11.280 --> 21:14.940
I will probably pay it at least to check out the full version, if not at least the trial

21:14.940 --> 21:15.940
for heaven's sake.

21:15.940 --> 21:22.320
Uh, Fable 3 was another game I checked out at Microsoft's booth and Fable 3, um, again

21:22.320 --> 21:28.520
the demo didn't really give you a lot, at least for me, of like what is really different

21:28.520 --> 21:33.820
about the game from Fable 2, I noticed a lot of, you know, the gold trail was kind of back

21:33.820 --> 21:38.040
from the other Fable games and the difference I saw was that you could dress up in a giant

21:38.040 --> 21:42.760
chicken suit for one of the quests, um, but you know, they weren't running it on Kinect

21:42.760 --> 21:47.200
or whatever, because right, Fable 3 is supposed to have some Kinect stuff, supposedly, but

21:47.200 --> 21:50.680
they weren't really showing any of that on the floor, so I gotta be honest, I didn't

21:50.680 --> 21:53.800
see a whole lot that was really different from Fable 2 and most of the people I talked

21:53.800 --> 21:58.640
to, same thing, but, I mean, that's not really a bad thing, Fable 2 was a great game, it

21:58.640 --> 22:02.120
was one of the better games that came out that year, it came out, so, more of the same

22:02.120 --> 22:06.440
in this case, not necessarily a bad thing, um, and I'm sure there's some other stuff

22:06.440 --> 22:10.680
I, like, you know, it seemed to be like there was a couple more interactions and things

22:10.680 --> 22:14.840
you could choose from, so, I mean, that part of it's cool, so, that was pretty much my

22:14.840 --> 22:18.960
impressions of Fable 3, I'll check that out when it comes out too.

22:18.960 --> 22:24.240
So while Rob was playing Fable 3, I was just around the corner, uh, playing Crackdown 2,

22:24.240 --> 22:29.200
and seriously, it was just Crackdown, that's all it was, and it was a 30 minute demo, which,

22:29.200 --> 22:33.200
um, I actually didn't spend the whole 30 minutes playing, but I definitely could have, um,

22:33.200 --> 22:38.820
easily, it was still fun, it was hilarious, um, and there were agility orbs, and that's

22:38.820 --> 22:44.880
all you need in a Crackdown game, um, I didn't play a whole lot of the first game, um, so

22:44.880 --> 22:49.420
this might be a new feature, but you can capture points, and then call helicopters down to

22:49.420 --> 22:53.960
give you more weapons, and the more proficient you are with, like, guns, the better weapons

22:53.960 --> 23:01.440
you get, so, uh, it actually really made me want to get one of those sleek new 360s, um,

23:01.440 --> 23:06.200
so I was happy with it, uh, and I guess it comes out in a couple months, or next month.

23:06.200 --> 23:10.000
What's wrong with the old 360s? Why can't you just get one of the old 360s? They aren't

23:10.000 --> 23:17.160
the shiny new ones, um, plus, I would like to have a wireless adapter, um, and this one's

23:17.160 --> 23:23.040
built in instead of paying an extra hundred dollars. Dollars? Dollars. So in other words,

23:23.040 --> 23:28.360
what they really should have had the first time. Yes, and if it breaks, it can't red

23:28.360 --> 23:32.040
ring technically, because there are no red lights inside, so if it breaks, it's gonna

23:32.040 --> 23:37.920
be three green rings of death. Or hopefully they've just built it this time, so it doesn't

23:37.920 --> 23:42.860
break, but that's another issue altogether, I'm digressing a little bit. So, what is next

23:42.860 --> 23:48.400
on our list? Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Um, you know, the demo was limited, it only had about,

23:48.400 --> 23:51.880
what, eight, ten characters, I don't remember, but that one, I mean, I guess that's still

23:51.880 --> 23:55.680
a lot, ten characters was as many as they had in the, like, original Street Fighter,

23:55.680 --> 24:00.200
right? No, the original Street Fighter was just eight. Anyway, um, it was cool, it was,

24:00.200 --> 24:04.960
um, very stylistic, um, you know, as a lot of you guys have seen in the trailers. To

24:04.960 --> 24:09.640
me it plays just like Marvel vs. Capcom 2. Keep in mind, I'm not on my up and up on fighting

24:09.640 --> 24:13.560
games, so I'm not the best authority to talk about these types of games, but to me it played

24:13.560 --> 24:17.320
a lot like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, but definitely had that more, like, kinda like Cell style

24:17.320 --> 24:22.360
that you've seen in a lot of the commercials. Not as much of the 2D, 3D switching as I would

24:22.360 --> 24:26.440
have thought based on the trailer and the fact that it kinda was supposed to be a little

24:26.440 --> 24:32.400
more Street Fighter IV, I thought. Um, so graphically, you know, it's kinda like a souped

24:32.400 --> 24:36.600
up arcade release, but I think it's gonna be, uh, pleasing for the fans. And some of

24:36.600 --> 24:41.400
the supers do the 3D thing a little bit, at least it was in the demo, but again, early,

24:41.400 --> 24:46.400
early, early build, and then, uh, had huge lines going for it all day at the Capcom booth.

24:46.400 --> 24:50.880
Um, the trick to getting to play the game quickly was to go to Microsoft's booth or

24:50.880 --> 24:54.880
even Sony's booth and play the game there, which is what we did.

24:54.880 --> 24:59.280
I really liked it. Um, I'm not a huge fan of the Marvel vs. Capcom games, or I already

24:59.280 --> 25:04.560
like Capcom vs. SNK, but, um, the one thing I noticed about it is because of the size

25:04.560 --> 25:11.160
of the characters and the screen, um, amount that you have to play in, it felt like the

25:11.160 --> 25:15.320
game was going a little too fast compared to the other ones. Um, sometimes it was kinda

25:15.320 --> 25:20.800
hard to keep up with what was going on. And, um, as a button masher, cause I don't know

25:20.800 --> 25:26.000
how to play Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and I picked, I think all new characters except for Iron

25:26.000 --> 25:34.840
Man, um, Chris Redfield sucks. Like, utterly, utterly terrible character. Um, slow and just

25:34.840 --> 25:39.880
awful. But Dante was really cool. I will definitely, when I play this game, will be playing as

25:39.880 --> 25:40.880
Dante.

25:40.880 --> 25:47.160
Awesome. Yeah, I pretty much played with standard characters. Felicia, Morgan, Ryu, all that

25:47.160 --> 25:51.800
fun stuff. Alright, so I finally, um, made good on my promise to get some hands-on with

25:51.800 --> 25:56.800
the PlayStation Move. Unfortunately, the line to get to all the really good games was really

25:56.800 --> 26:01.200
long. Um, but some of the, like, littler games that didn't have quite the, you know, like

26:01.200 --> 26:04.880
the bowling game and some other stuff, didn't have quite the long lines to get to them.

26:04.880 --> 26:09.400
So the game I got to play was the Toy Story game, which, you know, it's not a bad game.

26:09.400 --> 26:12.680
There's certainly an audience for it. It's definitely directed at a younger audience.

26:12.680 --> 26:16.640
It plays a lot like the Midway Mania game that came out earlier on the Wii. Um, but

26:16.640 --> 26:19.880
it's Toy Story 3, I should point out. It's, I guess, a game for Toy Story 3. But it pretty

26:19.880 --> 26:24.200
much plays just like Midway Mania, the ride, or the, um, other game that came out on the

26:24.200 --> 26:29.120
Wii. Um, you know, it's more of a point the move at the screen. It doesn't even use the

26:29.120 --> 26:32.280
second controller. It's just the one stick and you just kind of aim it at the screen

26:32.280 --> 26:36.680
and shoot. Very logical. But, you know, I was able to at least kind of get my hands

26:36.680 --> 26:41.280
on it. I like the way that controller kind of felt to hold. Um, it is a little weird

26:41.280 --> 26:45.860
with the whole, like, lollipop look that it has. And it's kind of funny because, um, when

26:45.860 --> 26:50.080
you shoot, uh, a certain square in the Toy Story game, it'll activate rapid fire. So

26:50.080 --> 26:53.840
you just hold that on the button to shoot, you know, the balls everywhere at the targets.

26:53.840 --> 26:57.320
But your little, uh, ball on the top of your controller starts spazzing out and turning

26:57.320 --> 27:01.000
all these rainbow colors. It's all pretty. So, you know, kids will get a kick out of

27:01.000 --> 27:05.040
it if you have one of those households where, you know, mom and dad really like to play

27:05.040 --> 27:09.560
their more hardcore PlayStation games, but you want some stuff for the kids too. I think

27:09.560 --> 27:12.880
that's going to fit in very nicely with the collection. Or if you're, you know, a Disney

27:12.880 --> 27:17.840
nut or you really like Midway Mania. Um, it was, it was cute. Although I didn't, I gotta

27:17.840 --> 27:23.480
be honest, I was talking to the demo guy about a bunch of like other things besides just

27:23.480 --> 27:28.280
the game. Um, so I couldn't tell you like how extensive the game's going to be, but

27:28.280 --> 27:32.640
you know what? It's, it's a Toy Story game. It's, you know what you're going to get.

27:32.640 --> 27:38.520
I am, on the other hand, um, when I got to play the move, I went to a more, I don't know,

27:38.520 --> 27:44.200
real game and I ended up playing Time Crisis, the new one. I don't remember the subtitle.

27:44.200 --> 27:49.760
Oh well. Um, it was great. Uh, the move controller works really well for Time Crisis. Uh, it's

27:49.760 --> 27:54.800
very, very quick in response time when you move it around. I was getting headshots left

27:54.800 --> 27:59.680
and right. Um, I had no problems playing it. In fact, I kind of played, I guess you could

27:59.680 --> 28:03.520
consider it twice because I played with two different people next to me. I just didn't

28:03.520 --> 28:09.280
want to leave and I always totally outdid the, the other people. Um, but I did talk

28:09.280 --> 28:13.840
to the rep that was there and he told me that the game is not only going to have the on-rails

28:13.840 --> 28:18.640
shooter like we all know from Time Crisis, but it will also have one, um, part of the

28:18.640 --> 28:24.200
game where you can just move around and shoot things too. So you're not stuck to those rails.

28:24.200 --> 28:30.680
And also he informed me that the retail copy will come with a move enhanced version of

28:30.680 --> 28:36.520
Time Crisis 4. So you kind of get three games in one. Um, which is great because, uh, Time

28:36.520 --> 28:41.560
Crisis 4, if it's free, it's good. I mean, it's a terrible, terrible Time Crisis game,

28:41.560 --> 28:46.620
but this new one is really fun. So I'm excited. Um, one of the cool things real quick about

28:46.620 --> 28:52.120
it was that the button on the top of the controller acted like your foot pedal in the arcade.

28:52.120 --> 28:57.520
So you would, uh, release it when you want to reload and keep your, um, shield up and

28:57.520 --> 29:01.720
then you would hold it down and then press the trigger button on the underside of the

29:01.720 --> 29:06.160
controller when you'd want to fire. Now, if you take Time Crisis off the rails, though,

29:06.160 --> 29:12.920
is it still really Time Crisis? I don't know. I can't see me playing that, uh, off the rails,

29:12.920 --> 29:17.140
um, section of the game that much because it did sound like they were two completely

29:17.140 --> 29:22.120
separate, uh, parts of the game. Like you can just play the rails game or you can play

29:22.120 --> 29:27.240
the, uh, free roaming one. I don't know how the free roaming one will work and it'll require

29:27.240 --> 29:34.600
for sure at least the, what, the Sony nunchuck, whatever it's called, um, to move around because

29:34.600 --> 29:39.920
I don't think you can really move around with just the move controller. The navigation controller,

29:39.920 --> 29:45.360
if I'm not mistaken, is what they call it. I like to call it, um, the, the, I think it

29:45.360 --> 29:51.680
was like balancing rock from, uh, um, uh, WarioWare, uh, smooth moves because those

29:51.680 --> 29:57.400
little intro things are hilarious. Um, and here's the microphone back. Alright, so we

29:57.400 --> 30:01.040
went over to Nintendo's booth for a little bit and, uh, caught up on some of the stuff

30:01.040 --> 30:05.520
besides the 3DS. Although we did spend a heck of a lot of time with the 3DS again, uh, which

30:05.520 --> 30:07.960
I'll let Shane start in a minute, but I do want to talk about the other games we got

30:07.960 --> 30:11.440
our hands on real quick. Some of the stuff we've been kind of teasing on the Sunday show

30:11.440 --> 30:15.720
a little bit, Wii Party, which I know, um, Loki was kind of making fun of because, oh

30:15.720 --> 30:19.160
my gosh, another mini game collection on the Wii. Who would have thought? But, uh, this

30:19.160 --> 30:22.840
appears to be probably one of the bigger Wii titles they're going to push this holiday,

30:22.840 --> 30:27.280
at least for the family unit. And it did seem like there were tons of mini games, but not

30:27.280 --> 30:31.640
necessarily like the same stuff you would see in other games. It seemed like you would

30:31.640 --> 30:36.480
have these larger games that consisted of a subset of mini games. I mean, kind of like

30:36.480 --> 30:40.720
Mario Party, I guess, if you think about it. Although a lot faster and, um, a little less

30:40.720 --> 30:43.600
cutthroat as I think Bobby might have said in the first half of the show, but I can't

30:43.600 --> 30:46.560
remember because it's been over 24 hours. But the game Shane and I played was funny

30:46.560 --> 30:50.840
because it was like a boat balancing game. I would like to point out real quick about

30:50.840 --> 30:59.120
the cutthroatedness of this game. We argued. Because he did not put his Mii on the right

30:59.120 --> 31:04.640
spot and then tried to blame me. And it wasn't my fault in the least. Well, it's not my fault

31:04.640 --> 31:08.600
you're terrible at Wii Party and, like, you don't take direction. Well, um, but anyway,

31:08.600 --> 31:12.520
that's, we were playing this thing where, like, there was a boat and you didn't want

31:12.520 --> 31:17.880
to tip the boat over. But you had to play little mini games to get the people that you

31:17.880 --> 31:21.800
would put on the boat. And if you passed the mini game, they would be the same weight.

31:21.800 --> 31:25.480
But if you didn't pass the mini game, they would be, like, fat and skinny. And that's

31:25.480 --> 31:29.620
bad. You don't want that. Um, but it's really funny when the boat tips over and everybody

31:29.620 --> 31:34.040
falls in. That was my favorite part. So it was almost, like, worth it to lose miserably.

31:34.040 --> 31:37.440
So that was Wii Party. I'm gonna be honest. I don't know if this is one I would necessarily

31:37.440 --> 31:42.560
buy because I don't have a lot of parties at my one bedroom apartment. But, you know,

31:42.560 --> 31:47.120
I think for the people, if you are getting a lot of use out of Wii Sports and Wii Sports

31:47.120 --> 31:51.560
Resort and the other, you know, major Nintendo releases for party games, this is kind of

31:51.560 --> 31:57.920
a next logical step that I'm sure will end up in a lot of households. Um, I liked Wii

31:57.920 --> 32:03.900
Party a whole lot. My only thing about it is if they try to charge $50 for it and not

32:03.900 --> 32:10.520
throw in, like, an extra controller or something, it's not worth it. Um, it was really fun,

32:10.520 --> 32:17.800
but, like, $25 fun. Nothing higher than that. Um, but after we moved on from, uh, Wii Party,

32:17.800 --> 32:22.960
we went to the Mario Sports Mix game, which was, interestingly enough, on the title screen,

32:22.960 --> 32:29.520
showed that it was, in part, developed by Square Enix. So, what the crap. Um, it had

32:29.520 --> 32:34.440
volleyball and basketball on it, and we played volleyball, and Rob was terrible. But I was

32:34.440 --> 32:38.240
really good, because I got us some points, and I was very good at blocking the shots

32:38.240 --> 32:43.760
from coming over. It was fun. The volleyball was a blast. Um, I kind of wish we had demoed

32:43.760 --> 32:48.960
the basketball, too, but the volleyball had really simple controls, and, um, it was a

32:48.960 --> 32:53.900
good time. Um, it's unfortunate that Shane would lie like that and say that I'm so terrible

32:53.900 --> 32:58.720
when I was the only one running around grabbing all the power-ups, but that's okay. Um, here's

32:58.720 --> 33:02.040
the thing, though. I gotta be honest. The game was almost a little too simple for me.

33:02.040 --> 33:07.040
This is really a kid's game. Um, and you know, it's fine for that audience, but, you know,

33:07.040 --> 33:11.440
I think for the rest of us, I think a lot of people are just gonna see it as, like,

33:11.440 --> 33:15.680
woo, more of the Wii Sports type of stuff. You know, again, if you have that mixed household

33:15.680 --> 33:20.160
that has the kids and the teenagers, maybe even, that would get a kick out of this, it

33:20.160 --> 33:23.880
would probably be worth it. Before the quote-quote hardcore gamer, which is probably most of

33:23.880 --> 33:28.800
the folks that listen to this show, I couldn't really take Mario Sports Mix seriously. And,

33:28.800 --> 33:32.920
um, you know, they try to incorporate some of the Mario elements into it, like the red

33:32.920 --> 33:40.560
shells, you know, and cute little things like that, but I couldn't take it seriously. Which

33:40.560 --> 33:45.960
I think is unfortunate, because I think it'd be a good relaxing game. Um, again, not a

33:45.960 --> 33:50.520
fifty dollar game, which they will charge for it, but a pretty good one just to kinda

33:50.520 --> 33:55.240
hang out and do nothing. Well, if I wanna play a relaxing game, I'll just play Wii Relax,

33:55.240 --> 34:00.680
which was totally absent from E3 this year. Who would've thought? It was like Nintendo

34:00.680 --> 34:07.600
knew to keep, uh, Kami Dunaway and the Wii, uh, Vitality Sensor away from E3, so nobody

34:07.600 --> 34:14.140
would get mad at them. Um, which is great. But moving on to the most, uh, important part

34:14.140 --> 34:20.280
of the show, I think, um, we went back through the 3DS line, which was fantastic to actually

34:20.280 --> 34:25.080
get to go back through and really spend some quality time with, uh, some of the games,

34:25.080 --> 34:33.480
um, demos and videos. Uh, I will, uh, say that they had a, uh, DJ Hero game on there,

34:33.480 --> 34:37.440
which I didn't even really realize. I know they had mentioned it before, but I thought

34:37.440 --> 34:41.400
they weren't, I didn't know it was up there to play. I was so pumped when I saw it, I

34:41.400 --> 34:48.100
hopped right over, and it is an amazing game. Um, it's all the bottom screen, uh, the touchscreen.

34:48.100 --> 34:53.960
You have 3D tracks still, but you only have, um, the little note circles in the middle,

34:53.960 --> 34:59.040
so you just tap the screen wherever you want for that. And then to slide, uh, your crossfader

34:59.040 --> 35:03.320
to the left or right, you slide the stylus on the screen. And it was really good, and

35:03.320 --> 35:09.840
the 3D effects made it kinda neat to see the, uh, the tracks, so to speak, come at you as

35:09.840 --> 35:15.640
you're playing. Um, and you played the DJ Hero, didn't you? Nope, nope, he's shaking

35:15.640 --> 35:22.040
his head, so I guess I won't hand the mic back over. Um, I also played the, uh, Professor

35:22.040 --> 35:28.000
Layton game. It was like Mirror of Something working title, so whatever. Professor Layton

35:28.000 --> 35:34.720
3DS, there we go. Um, it was cool. It was Professor Layton, but, uh, instead of the

35:34.720 --> 35:41.480
typical static screen where you touch things to find clues, you have a, uh, 3D screen on

35:41.480 --> 35:46.480
top and you can use this magnifying glass on the bottom screen. You move it around and

35:46.480 --> 35:51.480
your magnifying glass will change into, like, an orange filled magnifying glass if you find

35:51.480 --> 35:58.160
something to technically click on. Um, that was cool. Uh, the puzzle that you got while

35:58.160 --> 36:05.240
playing was, um, you know, uh, just a standard Professor Layton puzzle. I had to put a robot

36:05.240 --> 36:12.040
together, um, so it wasn't anything big and I didn't really use the 3D, but that was okay

36:12.040 --> 36:17.980
because it was still really fun and Professor Layton. Um, I also played Pilotwings. Uh,

36:17.980 --> 36:24.120
it was just a short demo. I flew a plane through some rings. Uh, it kind of felt like Wii Sports

36:24.120 --> 36:29.480
Resort, uh, more so than Pilotwings, but, you know, that's what they've been making

36:29.480 --> 36:34.220
recently. So, hey, here's Rob. Sorry, I ran out of room real quick. Can I, um, comment

36:34.220 --> 36:37.120
real quick, though, on Professor Layton because I also checked this out. I don't play the

36:37.120 --> 36:41.000
Professor Layton games, though. It was, let me explain, though. When you were up there

36:41.000 --> 36:46.120
demoing the 3DS, it was just a lot, probably all those women you saw at the press conference

36:46.120 --> 36:50.840
were now sitting up on the 3DS stage where you would go up there and they all had DS's

36:50.840 --> 36:55.120
tied to them, but the only kind of, like, problem was there were no signs saying what

36:55.120 --> 36:59.460
game was where. So you kind of would just walk up to women and see what game they had,

36:59.460 --> 37:03.600
you know. Um, which, you know, it's hard to kind of walk away, too, once you kind of get

37:03.600 --> 37:08.120
sucked into a game. Uh, so I checked out Professor Layton, even though I don't know the DS games

37:08.120 --> 37:12.080
at all, like Shane does, but I will say the one thing I noticed was that the 3D effects

37:12.080 --> 37:17.760
were probably the most sharp of almost anything that I demoed. Um, you know, in, in, you know,

37:17.760 --> 37:23.040
my 3D can sometimes be really picky, uh, but I thought Layton had probably some of the

37:23.040 --> 37:28.260
best 3D that I saw. Even though it wasn't, like, gimmicky 3D, like, pop-out things shooting

37:28.260 --> 37:33.360
at you, um, I thought it was just kind of some of the sharpest 3D.

37:33.360 --> 37:38.120
And I think the, um, art style of Professor Layton really is, um, a good match for the

37:38.120 --> 37:46.120
way they did the 3D. It was almost like a pop-up book, so to speak. Um, so I was saying,

37:46.120 --> 37:51.480
yeah, Pilotwings, it's just kind of Wii Sports Resort. It was fun. Um, then, uh, I played

37:51.480 --> 37:55.460
Ridge Racer. Didn't really care for it. I think it's the first handheld Ridge Racer

37:55.460 --> 37:59.640
I did not like. Um, but you played some of Ridge Racer, didn't you?

37:59.640 --> 38:04.720
Yeah, I mean, the controls were kind of dopey-like and just, it was not realistic at all when

38:04.720 --> 38:08.800
you would run into walls. I'm trying not to be too harsh, though, because, you know, early,

38:08.800 --> 38:13.320
early, early, I think it's more of a concept than anything like the actual game. Again,

38:13.320 --> 38:18.000
the 3D effects were pretty cool, though. Um, it took a minute to kind of get it right because,

38:18.000 --> 38:22.160
you know, I think there's a lot going on that your eyes kind of have to catch with the 3D,

38:22.160 --> 38:25.240
but once it kind of clicks, like, I think the 3D effect, obviously, you know, racing

38:25.240 --> 38:29.680
game, um, was really good. But I was more impressed with the visuals and the Mario Kart

38:29.680 --> 38:33.360
concept pre-rendered footage that they had running somewhere else. But at least this

38:33.360 --> 38:37.520
one was playable. But, like, when you would run into walls, your car would just kind of

38:37.520 --> 38:44.200
like turn 20 degrees to one side. It was so not smooth at all. But, again, I really, really

38:44.200 --> 38:48.160
think it's unfair to, like, judge a whole game based off these very, very conceptual

38:48.160 --> 38:52.080
demos. This just wasn't one that made me jump up and down like some of the other concept

38:52.080 --> 38:53.720
demos did.

38:53.720 --> 38:57.320
I would say we have to say maybe conceptual demos because we don't know when these games

38:57.320 --> 39:03.480
are coming out and some of them actually felt pretty polished for demos.

39:03.480 --> 39:08.440
I guess that's true. If this is the game, though, um, it's, uh, I would totally pass

39:08.440 --> 39:13.560
on it until the Mario Kart game comes out as far as I'm concerned. Um, let's see, one

39:13.560 --> 39:17.560
of the games I checked out was Kingdom Hearts, um, although it was not really a game. It

39:17.560 --> 39:22.440
was just kind of a concept thing, uh, where you would watch pre-rendered video. Um, so

39:22.440 --> 39:25.480
really all I can say about it was that it was kind of like watching the opening on the

39:25.480 --> 39:31.400
PS2. I mean, it was, um, the 3D was, you know, there wasn't a lot going on, but it was, I

39:31.400 --> 39:36.000
was more impressed that, wow, this is like PlayStation 2 style graphics on the DS. That

39:36.000 --> 39:41.520
was, um, you know, not, not quite at that caliber, but almost definitely a step above

39:41.520 --> 39:43.880
where it was at before. So that was pretty awesome.

39:43.880 --> 39:48.000
Um, one of the other games I played that I think Shane didn't was Samurai Warriors, which

39:48.000 --> 39:52.760
was like half video, half playable demo. Um, and that was, that was cool. I mean, the playable

39:52.760 --> 39:57.080
demo was very simple. It was just kill, uh, 50 warriors really quick, but the 3D was,

39:57.080 --> 40:00.920
um, they used a lot of it and, uh, you know, not just the depth and running around killing

40:00.920 --> 40:05.040
the warriors, but then like, you know, little anime overlays would come up when you do special

40:05.040 --> 40:08.880
moves and those kind of pop out. And I thought that was pretty cool.

40:08.880 --> 40:17.240
Um, and a game I know I played that, uh, Rob didn't was Nintendogs plus cats. Um, unfortunately

40:17.240 --> 40:22.140
they didn't have the cats, but they did have a couple breeds of dogs. I actually did switch

40:22.140 --> 40:27.880
between breeds just to see if there's any real differences. It was Nintendogs. Um, probably

40:27.880 --> 40:32.480
the coolest thing about it was when I threw the ball and the ball went, you know, 3D into

40:32.480 --> 40:38.280
the back and then he came running back with it and, you know, it was 3D and Nintendogs.

40:38.280 --> 40:41.680
It's going to be boring after a few days, but you know, the first couple of days you'll

40:41.680 --> 40:48.640
really enjoy it. Um, I also saw a few videos and I'll just quickly hit on those. Uh, Paper

40:48.640 --> 40:55.960
Mario, beautiful game. Um, it is like a pop-up book. It was really cool. Um, Metal Gear,

40:55.960 --> 41:00.360
amazing. Uh, I hear a lot of people think it's one of the best videos on the floor.

41:00.360 --> 41:05.080
I can agree. You could move the camera around. It looked like a PS2 game, but in 3D it was

41:05.080 --> 41:11.240
really neat. Um, I saw Dead or Alive on videos just really briefly cause I was like, I don't

41:11.240 --> 41:16.320
care about Dead or Alive, but graphically it looked pretty nice. Um, and then the worst

41:16.320 --> 41:22.680
video goes to Resident Evil because for some reason I could not find the right angle to

41:22.680 --> 41:29.520
look at it. I looked at it straight on like every other demo and sometimes it would be,

41:29.520 --> 41:35.240
you know, in focus and sometimes it would be crazy. Couldn't understand why. Um, but

41:35.240 --> 41:41.680
that was my, uh, entire 3D. Oh no, wait. I took pictures with the 3D camera. Um, they

41:41.680 --> 41:47.080
had that off to the side. I had to hunt for it and those were really cool. Um, you can

41:47.080 --> 41:52.720
actually adjust, uh, like, you know, with the slider how the 3D looks, but there was

41:52.720 --> 41:57.840
also like an option to toggle how the actual 3D looks. Instead of just making a flat image,

41:57.840 --> 42:04.800
you could kind of change, um, the perception, um, on the 3D image itself. I'm kind of pissed

42:04.800 --> 42:07.960
I didn't see that because that was one of the few things I really, really wanted to

42:07.960 --> 42:12.520
see. Um, let's see, out of those that you talked about, I also saw the Resident Evil

42:12.520 --> 42:18.000
1 and I also had a difficult time really seeing the 3D in it, but graphically, wow, wowee

42:18.000 --> 42:22.880
wow. I mean, I don't know if that was pre-rendered video, I'm assuming it was, but if not, wowee

42:22.880 --> 42:27.360
wow. Um, otherwise, I think the only other game I can think of off the top of my head

42:27.360 --> 42:32.000
was, uh, Sims 3, um, that I saw on the DS and, you know, the only real feature they

42:32.000 --> 42:35.920
were showing off was again about picture taking. Um, you could actually take a picture of yourself

42:35.920 --> 42:39.800
using the camera and it would like model your face on the character. I don't think though

42:39.800 --> 42:43.520
that's a, I haven't played the DS one that's out there now, but I'm pretty sure it has

42:43.520 --> 42:48.520
that same feature, at least for the DSi. Um, so, you know, whatevers.

42:48.520 --> 42:53.200
Uh, until I heard that the line was four hours towards the end of the day, I did want to

42:53.200 --> 42:58.240
go back because I somehow missed the Star Fox demo and I really, really wanted to play

42:58.240 --> 43:02.880
that because I heard nothing but good things. Um, so I apologize to anybody that wants to

43:02.880 --> 43:06.000
hear it. I really wanted to play it, but just missed it.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.400
Ditto. I just, you know, just wanted to get my hands on as much stuff as possible. Even

43:10.400 --> 43:15.200
if it was games I wasn't super familiar with, I just wanted to just see as much 3D as possible.

43:15.200 --> 43:19.880
Um, some of the pre-rendered videos though they had were really impressive. Um, what

43:19.880 --> 43:24.880
they kind of did to really help the line situation was that they actually had gals walking around

43:24.880 --> 43:29.240
the line a little bit, kind of showing off the DSs they had. So you could actually see

43:29.240 --> 43:33.160
the 3DS before you really got on the stage, but all they would show was just like some

43:33.160 --> 43:37.400
pre-rendered concept videos. But man, there was one, and I know Shane feels differently

43:37.400 --> 43:41.240
about this one, but there was one with like a champagne cork popping up and like all the

43:41.240 --> 43:46.280
confetti and streamers would pop out of the bottle. And it was the one thing where I really

43:46.280 --> 43:52.520
felt like the images were not going in a hall or whatever, like the depth is going back.

43:52.520 --> 43:58.720
I felt like the images were really popping out, like it was really astounding.

43:58.720 --> 44:03.720
My favorite thing from that video, and you're right, I did not like the champagne bottle

44:03.720 --> 44:09.960
um, popping with the streamers. It just, not because of, I thought it was terrible looking,

44:09.960 --> 44:14.660
it just kind of made me a little bit dizzy feeling because of the way my eyes were focusing

44:14.660 --> 44:20.960
on it. But um, they had a pre-rendered picture that you can move around of Pikmin, and I

44:20.960 --> 44:27.960
love Pikmin, and that made me really really really need a Pikmin game for this 3DS.

44:50.960 --> 44:55.240
It felt like the other Final Fantasy games that are on the DS right now. I guess the

44:55.240 --> 45:00.600
big thing is hats. You put on hats and it changes your jobs, and anybody can be like

45:00.600 --> 45:04.600
any job, so I guess maybe it's got like a 5 thing going with it, but I really didn't

45:04.600 --> 45:10.160
spend enough time with a floor demo to really comment any further. I think if you like the

45:10.160 --> 45:15.160
Final Fantasy 3 and 4 on DS, this is probably right up your alley.

45:15.160 --> 45:19.720
I played it a little bit too. Unfortunately the demo I picked up, somebody had just finished

45:19.720 --> 45:25.840
playing, and they died. So one of my characters was dead and I had no magic to use, so it

45:25.840 --> 45:34.840
was really boring to me. But, for me, the 3DS versions of the Final Fantasy games felt

45:34.840 --> 45:39.720
too slow, and this one was no exception, so I was not really digging it.

45:39.720 --> 45:44.800
You're just a hater. But I will say this, I thought it was really cute how in the demo

45:44.800 --> 45:49.320
they definitely had programmed it as an E3 demo. It really reminded me of a few years

45:49.320 --> 45:54.120
ago there was a Katamari Damacy game coming out that was specifically for E3 and the king

45:54.120 --> 45:58.720
would talk about E3 and stuff. That was kind of similar to this little demo they had. The

45:58.720 --> 46:02.520
little characters in the village talked about, you know, we worked really hard on this demo,

46:02.520 --> 46:07.560
we hope you enjoy it. It was really funny. I like cute little things like that. It makes

46:07.560 --> 46:10.960
the demo games feel that much more special.

46:10.960 --> 46:16.040
That's like the ghost trick demo that we played. They had a lot of references to how it was

46:16.040 --> 46:21.160
just a demo, that the retail version would be different, and that was fun. Oh my god,

46:21.160 --> 46:27.160
the dog in that game is adorable. I know we've already talked about it, but it was great.

46:27.160 --> 46:33.520
Now let's bring this podcast down a little bit. I went to play Final Fantasy XIV. The

46:33.520 --> 46:39.120
good news is the character creation is fun. It's got some really nice options, especially

46:39.120 --> 46:43.520
if you played XI, you know you were very limited in what you can do, but this one gives you

46:43.520 --> 46:50.240
not a whole bunch more options, but far more than you ever had in Final Fantasy XI. I had

46:50.240 --> 46:57.420
highlights in my hair that were blue. I could change to many different hairstyles, many

46:57.420 --> 47:05.240
different eye colors, many different skin colors. They also had adjustable voices, adjustable

47:05.240 --> 47:12.280
features like scars and stuff like that, and nose and chins and mouth options. It was crazy.

47:12.280 --> 47:18.600
The bad news is the combat is awful. Absolutely terrible. They told us that the beta build

47:18.600 --> 47:22.800
that we were playing was different from the current alpha that players are playing right

47:22.800 --> 47:29.560
now. The combat is one of the most clunky combat schemes I've ever seen, and I played

47:29.560 --> 47:36.120
Final Fantasy XI, so I know clunky combat. So what they had us do was get into a party

47:36.120 --> 47:40.280
and start this thing called a guild leave, which was awesome. It's a quest where you

47:40.280 --> 47:49.840
can select different styles of play, like solo, duo, party, something else, and all

47:49.840 --> 47:56.920
your server, something like that, for difficulty, so you could get better rewards or maybe do

47:56.920 --> 48:05.040
a quicker quest and still do the same quest. They had three of us join up as a group, and

48:05.040 --> 48:11.140
we had to go kill crabs. So we found the crabs after some terrible walking with bad cameras,

48:11.140 --> 48:15.680
but they said the cameras would be fixed, so hopefully that's true. Found the crabs!

48:15.680 --> 48:20.040
The first thing you have to do before you initiate battle is unsheathe your weapon.

48:20.040 --> 48:25.800
Not a big deal. Then you have to target your enemy by clicking on it. Kind of getting annoying.

48:25.800 --> 48:30.640
Then you run up to the enemy, and you have this stamina bar that's not unlike the Final

48:30.640 --> 48:36.080
Fantasy XIII gauge, where you could queue up actions, and once the bar is filled up,

48:36.080 --> 48:41.820
it'll take those actions. So once you do that, and you make sure your enemy is targeted,

48:41.820 --> 48:47.980
you will unleash attacks. The combat, though, is so fast that you just don't have time to

48:47.980 --> 48:57.600
really think about what you're doing. There's no on-screen text besides in your little chat

48:57.600 --> 49:02.040
log to tell you if you're too far away or if you can't perform that action. Constantly

49:02.040 --> 49:05.800
I thought I had the enemy targeted, but I accidentally clicked on myself, so nothing

49:05.800 --> 49:09.920
was happening. But I didn't really realize this, because there were not enough on-screen

49:09.920 --> 49:15.640
commands to tell me I was doing something wrong. I really, really hope they fix that

49:15.640 --> 49:22.760
because, I mean, I'll still get the game. I won't be able to help myself. But it's going

49:22.760 --> 49:27.640
to make the game a little less fun for me if I can't even attack an enemy. Granted,

49:27.640 --> 49:31.880
I was a class I never would have played to begin with, the gladiator class. I definitely

49:31.880 --> 49:35.080
would have been the mage or the lancer had I known. I just had to sit at a different

49:35.080 --> 49:43.440
chair. But I don't know. I don't have high hopes for the combat, especially since it's

49:43.440 --> 49:46.760
just not that great.

49:46.760 --> 49:50.200
Here's the thing. I think Shane is being a little harsh on the game. I will say this.

49:50.200 --> 49:54.840
I observed, because Shane wouldn't let me play. But the game was beautiful. Oh my god,

49:54.840 --> 50:01.480
it was so pretty to look at, especially for an MMO. I thought it was great. I think this

50:01.480 --> 50:07.680
is a game that is very hard for Square to demo at an expo like E3. I think a game like

50:07.680 --> 50:12.100
this takes a big learning curve, and I think that's part of the reason Shane had a lot

50:12.100 --> 50:17.280
of problems is that I think he got thrown right into this thing and was being told,

50:17.280 --> 50:20.280
okay, do this, now this, now this, now this. You know, I'm almost kind of like, you know

50:20.280 --> 50:23.240
what, the dude should have just sat there and played it and we should have watched.

50:23.240 --> 50:27.600
I mean, I think it was just too much for Shane to kind of like have to do it once. I think

50:27.600 --> 50:30.720
when you play the actual game, you'll kind of learn how to do it piece by piece. Like

50:30.720 --> 50:34.960
remember how the biggest complaint about 13, it takes forever to unfold? Well, you know,

50:34.960 --> 50:38.960
a lot of it's teaching you a little piece of the game at a time. And I just think the

50:38.960 --> 50:44.520
way they demoed it kind of bit him a little bit. I think when the actual game comes out,

50:44.520 --> 50:47.680
it won't bug Shane as much. That's just personal logic.

50:47.680 --> 50:52.600
Yeah, and I can kind of agree with that. I still would like to see a little bit more

50:52.600 --> 50:58.780
of the interface changed. Like if I'm too far away from an enemy, I don't need a little

50:58.780 --> 51:02.700
box in the corner telling me that. I need something on screen. Might be because I'm

51:02.700 --> 51:10.980
used to WoW, but that effectively gets me to realize that I'm too far away. The other

51:10.980 --> 51:19.420
thing that I would like to see changed and could probably have helped a lot is the pointer

51:19.420 --> 51:24.560
on screen was not very smooth. Like you would move your mouse and then the pointer would

51:24.560 --> 51:30.040
move very slowly, not responsive compared to what you're moving on the mouse. If they

51:30.040 --> 51:34.540
can speed that up, get it kind of like to a 1 to 1 ratio, your movement speed, it'd

51:34.540 --> 51:38.960
probably help a little bit more. But by the time I was able to like click on the button

51:38.960 --> 51:45.040
to go use my TP, the fight was over and it kind of sucked.

51:45.040 --> 51:48.560
Again though, I think that's a problem with the demo, not the game.

51:48.560 --> 51:51.960
I've heard it's the same for the alpha, but it might still be alpha related.

51:51.960 --> 51:58.720
Well, I will say this, as somebody who's sunk a couple years into Final Fantasy XI, conceptually

51:58.720 --> 52:03.520
I really like a lot of the things they did with XIV. I just think I can really see where

52:03.520 --> 52:12.480
they've tried to make an effort to have things more solo-able, like with these guild lives

52:12.480 --> 52:17.720
with the different levels of difficulty. I thought that was really cool and I just loved

52:17.720 --> 52:22.880
how the quest start was right there, the quest turn in was right there when you finished,

52:22.880 --> 52:27.160
everything was very instant gratification. Those of you that have played XI know it's

52:27.160 --> 52:33.000
a lot of walking and running around and slow moving game. It definitely feels like they've

52:33.000 --> 52:37.920
kind of picked up the pace a little bit in XIV. Conceptually, I was really a fan of the

52:37.920 --> 52:40.800
stuff they implemented that I saw.

52:40.800 --> 52:45.520
Another cool thing, because I'm not all boo-hoo on this game, especially after today we watched

52:45.520 --> 52:49.640
the trailer on Rob's TV and like I told him, I was like, well, this trailer just changed

52:49.640 --> 52:55.280
my mind, I'm going to play again. It was just cut scenes. Another cool thing about the guild

52:55.280 --> 53:01.720
leaves is that if you're someone that likes to grind in games and just not read anything,

53:01.720 --> 53:06.360
any enemies you have to kill for guild leaves have little guild leave markers next to their

53:06.360 --> 53:11.800
name so you know you can avoid everybody else and just focus on those same enemies. Though

53:11.800 --> 53:14.880
that does bring me to another thing I forgot to mention is that when we were killing the

53:14.880 --> 53:19.960
crabs, because that's what we had to do, one crab, before it died, started to run away

53:19.960 --> 53:25.720
and those suckers moved fast and they could not catch up. Part of the way you regain health

53:25.720 --> 53:30.060
is you sheath your weapon. Well, you've got to stop to sheath your weapon, the animation

53:30.060 --> 53:34.640
forces you to. So he's still running away, I'm trying to sheath my weapon, so it stops

53:34.640 --> 53:40.760
me, he's getting farther ahead, and I probably would not have known where to go unless the

53:40.760 --> 53:48.760
representative had to tell me where to go because I lost sight of him. Something to

53:48.760 --> 53:52.380
keep in mind though, didn't you want the crabs to run ahead? Because didn't they take you

53:52.380 --> 53:55.960
to a room that had the other monsters in it that you needed to kill? It almost seemed

53:55.960 --> 54:02.200
like that was part of it. It did seem like it was part of it but one thing, and I'm not

54:02.200 --> 54:06.400
sure because I was one of the people that didn't read the leave at all because it wasn't

54:06.400 --> 54:11.880
on my screen, until we actually got to that room where we had to kill water elementals

54:11.880 --> 54:18.400
too, the water elementals did not appear as part of the quest as what I had to kill. It

54:18.400 --> 54:24.920
wasn't until I got to that room where their name appeared below my crabs I've killed.

54:24.920 --> 54:29.920
So I don't know if that triggered more to the quest or if it just didn't show up until

54:29.920 --> 54:36.720
I got closer to those enemies. Hmm, interesting. Alright, well let's move on from Final Fantasy

54:36.720 --> 54:41.320
XIV and talk about some of the other games we saw. I know Civilization V was another

54:41.320 --> 54:45.160
game we had a little time to sit down and have a demo done for us, we didn't get to

54:45.160 --> 54:50.840
play it, but it was a really gorgeous game. Of course they had it running on their best

54:50.840 --> 54:57.960
system, but you can really see the level of detail. Fully animated leaders of the other

54:57.960 --> 55:01.760
worlds for those that have played other Civilization games before. What I really like they've done

55:01.760 --> 55:06.160
with it is that now they're all voice over too in their native languages. So Napoleon

55:06.160 --> 55:10.120
actually speaks French at you, although of course there's English subtitles, and so on.

55:10.120 --> 55:18.960
Right on down to Monzuma speaks old antiquated languages. Very cool stuff. The hexagonal

55:18.960 --> 55:24.020
shift is kind of new. There's a new thing that they put in there, and I'm terrible I

55:24.020 --> 55:27.640
forgot the name of it and I should have taped the thing yesterday so I can remember, but

55:27.640 --> 55:33.360
they reminded me of like talent trees in Diablo or WoW, where as you put your points in these

55:33.360 --> 55:37.480
certain trees it kind of has this effect on your civilization, which I thought was kind

55:37.480 --> 55:42.680
of neat. So yeah Civ V I'll definitely be looking at, but you know I know you Civ fans,

55:42.680 --> 55:45.920
you know, if you played enough Civ III and IV you're going to get this game no matter

55:45.920 --> 55:51.880
what I tell you. So I think though they're really trying and it was again very pretty

55:51.880 --> 55:55.240
to look at. Now Shane, you don't really care for the Civ series, but I made you sit through

55:55.240 --> 56:01.160
the demo anyway. It's not that I don't care for the Civilization series, it's more that

56:01.160 --> 56:07.660
I don't do strategy games. I don't have the patience, nor the I'm guessing brain power

56:07.660 --> 56:15.480
to do them, but I'm glad I watched the Civ V demo because it actually looked really interesting.

56:15.480 --> 56:20.580
It looked kind of like a SimCity style game and I know it's not, but there were so many

56:20.580 --> 56:25.560
aspects that you can focus on in that game instead of just all out battling it looked

56:25.560 --> 56:30.360
like that. It might be something I give a shot. It was funny and like I said with Dead

56:30.360 --> 56:34.280
Rising I'm scared of zombies, but the game was funny so I'm probably going to play it.

56:34.280 --> 56:41.040
Civ V I'm scared of strategy games, but it was funny so I'm probably going to try it.

56:41.040 --> 56:46.800
Alright whatever makes it work, huh? Alright I guess the very last game there is to talk

56:46.800 --> 56:54.380
about is Puzzle Quest 2. Yeah I know we saved the best for last. No I mean it was cute.

56:54.380 --> 56:59.040
Although yeah the main battle is more of the same, but hey hold on. There seems to be a

56:59.040 --> 57:02.200
lot more mini games. That's one of the first things I noticed. Like you know in the original

57:02.200 --> 57:07.440
Puzzle Quest there were games that you would do to take over the cities and all that stuff.

57:07.440 --> 57:11.280
It seems like they've built more of those types of games in Puzzle Quest 2 and that's

57:11.280 --> 57:14.400
one of the biggest differences I noticed off the bat. And you can play those mini games

57:14.400 --> 57:20.000
on demand which was cool too. I'm kind of dumb because I just remembered a really good

57:20.000 --> 57:24.640
thing I've tested out on Puzzle Quest 2 was the campaign mode because I know it was there.

57:24.640 --> 57:29.640
I just went to quick battle, but yeah it was more of the same. Graphically nothing really

57:29.640 --> 57:35.320
changed. We played the DS version just so you know. We had people next to us playing

57:35.320 --> 57:43.020
the 360 one, whatever. Quick battle was just pick a character, fight a goblin, win. Except

57:43.020 --> 57:48.320
I lost the first one. Won the second one. But I forgot to try the campaign mode because

57:48.320 --> 57:54.720
that's the thing that was supposed to be overhauled. So that sucks. Guess we'll have to wait until

57:54.720 --> 58:00.280
the full release. Oh well. Alright so before we wrap up, Shane I'll ask you kind of the

58:00.280 --> 58:03.120
same thing that I asked Bobby and put him on the spot with. What was the thing that

58:03.120 --> 58:11.600
most surprised you about E3? This is actually easy. The 3DS. And we all knew it was coming.

58:11.600 --> 58:16.040
Didn't know in what form. And you know I was one of the skeptical people. I knew I'd buy

58:16.040 --> 58:21.800
it regardless because it's a Nintendo handheld. You can't go wrong. But I was surprised by

58:21.800 --> 58:29.280
the I don't know how much it really changed some of those games to me. Like seeing DJ

58:29.280 --> 58:35.080
Hero with the track coming at you was such an interesting idea compared to just seeing

58:35.080 --> 58:43.120
it flat. Kind of scrolling down the screen. Seeing freaking Nintendogs. Not the best of

58:43.120 --> 58:49.920
demos but just kind of seeing that they had this 3D version of it and being able to see

58:49.920 --> 58:55.760
the ball go in the distance and then come back in his mouth. It was just really interesting.

58:55.760 --> 59:03.280
I was really surprised by how much I ended up liking that little system. For me probably

59:03.280 --> 59:07.680
two things. Number one I think what most people are probably thinking and surprised them about

59:07.680 --> 59:13.000
E3 even sitting at home. Microsoft's and Nintendo's switching places this year where Microsoft

59:13.000 --> 59:17.440
was totally catering to the casual crowd and Nintendo finally gave I think what a lot of

59:17.440 --> 59:22.160
us were bitching about the past two years what we finally wanted. Yeah Kid Icarus namely

59:22.160 --> 59:26.620
in the 3DS and just Reggie getting out there and going and here's a game and here's a game

59:26.620 --> 59:30.840
and here's a game and now you shut the fuck up about how bad the Wii is. That's really

59:30.840 --> 59:38.060
what his press conference was. Pretty cool. And then Microsoft just kind of really kind

59:38.060 --> 59:42.400
of putting all their chips on the casual market so we'll see how it pays off for them. I don't

59:42.400 --> 59:46.120
know I'm interested in some of the extra gaming. I gotta say the exercise gaming or whatever

59:46.120 --> 59:50.200
it's called. Not feeling so much on the casual titles that are coming out for Kinect. So

59:50.200 --> 59:54.440
we'll see if the gamble pays off. Sony's just kind of doing their thing and you know now

59:54.440 --> 59:58.840
Valve's there and now they're going to have motion but unfortunately for Sony I don't

59:58.840 --> 01:00:02.620
think there's a whole lot on the motion controller I feel like I have to have. I'm not going

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:06.720
to buy one because there's nothing I really want to play that needs the motion controller

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:11.280
but I will buy LittleBigPlanet 2 that's for damn sure. I'd like to comment real quick

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:17.800
about the role reversal. This E3 everybody knows that before this E3 it's Microsoft vs

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:22.600
Sony with Nintendo doing their own thing. Now it seems like it's Microsoft vs Nintendo

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:28.360
with Sony doing their own thing. It's very interesting how everything just kind of switched

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:32.880
with Microsoft still being like you know I'm going to bite off you and not care about these

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:39.140
other people. Just like they were doing with Sony to Nintendo and now Nintendo to Sony.

01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:43.980
And in your comment in regards to the move I always feel like if I can find one game

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:48.560
that I know I will play a lot of for a system or accessory I will get it and that will be

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:54.920
time crisis. That's enough for me to justify at least a move controller maybe not the move

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:59.920
you know balancing stone or whatever it's called. Well we'll see maybe there will be

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:03.760
a game that will change my mind. Maybe it's Sing Star Dance who knows but I somehow doubt

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:10.800
it. Alright the thing that most surprised me otherwise DC Universe. I was like so I

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:14.880
just was loving that game and it's not. I was really caught by surprise. I thought it

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:18.960
was just going to be like another MMO I wouldn't really give a second thought to although I

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:23.640
thought the cross platform was cool. But yeah I definitely want to check that game out when

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:27.480
it comes out now. But you know what always happens to games we call one of the best of

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:31.040
E3. I'm not saying DC Universe is necessarily best of E3. I think that prize would really

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:37.760
go to 3DS but you know it usually happens with our best of E3 picks. They come out and

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:45.040
they're not so great. Remember Nintendogs anybody? Okay so Shane what about the thing

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:49.160
that disappointed you the most? Would it be like Microsoft like a lot of people at home

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:54.720
are thinking or? No I wouldn't say it was Microsoft because I'm not a huge fan of theirs

01:01:54.720 --> 01:02:01.480
anyway I was actually you know kind of happy with them in terms of their new hardware.

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:05.520
Finally getting that wireless adapter built inside instead of having another hundred dollar

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:14.060
attachment to pay for. I would say what really disappointed me this E3 was the lack of playable

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:19.800
demos for big games that will sell tons of copies. If you didn't have an appointment

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:24.160
you couldn't play Guitar Hero. You couldn't play DJ Hero 2. You couldn't play the new

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:29.560
Call of Duty. You couldn't play anything at Bethesda. Portal 2 wasn't even anywhere in

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:36.360
playable form and that's a huge title. There was no announcements for Dragon Age 2 which

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:41.280
has already gotten a release date. Thank you Dragon Age Awakening for bundling that in

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:48.880
and teasing me. So I was just disappointed at the lack of playable big titles or even

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:55.420
titles that have been previously mentioned and were nowhere on the floor. I'll pretty

01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:58.800
much agree with what Shane's saying as far as the biggest disappointment but I'll just

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:02.640
sum it up all in one game. The one game I would have really liked to play on the show

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:08.520
floor, that Child of Eden game looked pretty bad ass and I really wanted to check that

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:12.840
out and I was extremely disappointed I wouldn't be able to. Also there was a huge line for

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.760
Metroid Other M because it's the one thing in Nintendo I didn't end up playing because

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:20.640
I didn't want to sit in that line. I'll just have to check it out when the game comes out.

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:25.520
So you know we've kind of had 3DS dominate a lot of the conversation we've had over the

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:29.320
past couple days. So Shane I'll give you one more reason to talk about it. When do you

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:35.640
think the system is going to come out and how much? Place your bets. Okay so it's Nintendo.

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:39.320
They've never done a system that's been over $300. They've never done a handheld that's

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:46.040
been over $200. Actually $190 I think is the max they've gone with this DSi XL. I will

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:51.720
say that I would hope the system comes out at $200 because I don't think they'll go lower

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:57.280
than that. But I would expect the system to come out at $250 because of the technology

01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:02.720
and all the stuff it can do. As for when it comes out they've already said it'll be by

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:09.720
the end of the fiscal year which will be March 2011. I will say and it'll be wrong but I'll

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:16.120
say in America we'll get it this holiday. My only reasoning for that is because Nintendo

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:21.280
has nothing for this holiday at all. They have nothing to compete with the move. Nothing

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:27.920
to compete with Kinect. I think the only real holiday titles they have coming are Donkey

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:33.520
Kong which I don't think is big enough to support the Wii, and Wii Party which is definitely

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:39.320
not big enough to support the Wii this holiday, and then for DS Golden Sun. And I'm not even

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:43.700
sure if that's towards the holiday or if it's just standard fall. So I'm going to go with

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:52.800
$250 realistically and this holiday. I'm going to say Nintendo goes all the way to March

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:57.040
2011. Actually no I'm going to say February 2011. Maybe they'll do like a Valentine's

01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:03.120
Day thing I don't know. I'm going to say February 2011. I will also say $250 but you will get

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:07.200
a bundle in game and movie. I think you're going to get they're going to try to sweeten

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:11.420
the pot with some nice bundles. Although the game will not be Kid Icarus so don't get your

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:16.180
own tropes up. The game will be something else and the movie will be one of those Disney

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:19.320
things that are being demoed out on the floor. Although well maybe not. I guess it might

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:24.120
have to be something Nintendo related but we'll see. I think they'll do that or maybe

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:29.200
like you know what it'll be? It'll be a bunch of like 3D movie trailers. There'll be like

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:34.520
one cartridge that's just like 3D experience and it's going to be all these movies and

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:37.680
things we saw on the show floor just in one cartridge. I bet it will be that and then

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:44.680
like a game. And then I'm saying February 2011 and I'm just going to say Reggie's going

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:49.640
to try to push all those Wii titles for the holiday season. I think I disagree with Shane.

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:54.000
I think Wii Party as much as we don't think is enough to sustain them through their holiday

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.400
season. I think that's going to be their big holiday push. And then for the hardcore crowd

01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:02.560
they're going to be like hey you got Goldeneye and you got the Kirby over here and all this

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:08.400
other stuff. Yeah Goldeneye was this year right? The demo we played felt really done

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:13.920
so I would think Goldeneye is maybe this year. I hear that the Zelda demo felt really done

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:19.440
too and that's not until next year. Thanks Nintendo. Oh I was going to say I thought

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:25.160
you meant Zelda on the 3DS and I was going to go well there's maybe your pack in game.

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:29.240
That no because they can make tons of money off of that. I was thinking maybe Nintendogs

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:33.960
and like nope that will make a ton of money. There's nothing that Nintendo showed that

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:40.040
they would pack in. Maybe another Metroid Prime first hunt or something. Again I think

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:45.920
it's going to be the 3D buffet. It's basically all the demos we saw on one cartridge. I wouldn't

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:49.520
put it past them though to do Nintendogs plus cats. Why not? They did a Nintendogs bundle

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:56.520
before. Maybe but I think that was after the game had already come out and it was for like

01:06:56.520 --> 01:07:01.900
a special thanksgiving bundle. I feel like they could make too much money off of that.

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:04.380
And I didn't even think about this but the price of the games. I wonder if they'll be

01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:08.600
higher than the DS or not because they're on new. It is a new format it looks like the

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:13.720
cartridges do look a little different. I have a picture. It's not the same. Of course they'll

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:20.720
be more expensive of course. About 5 to 10 dollars more expensive. No I can do 5 I can't

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:27.720
do 10. I do not want $50 handheld games. I'm sick of $40 ones already. Alright let's wrap

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:34.720
up. The thing you most want to see at E3 2011 or what one thing you want to see changed

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:42.000
for E3 2011? What I want to see changed? Not what game I want to see? Either. I'll do both.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:49.000
I want less closed doors. You know if it's a press event all the press should be able

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.480
to see whatever. You shouldn't have to make an appointment. You should have a press only

01:07:53.480 --> 01:08:00.000
area but not an appointment. Second thing I want to see? Or game I want to see? Uncharted

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:06.880
3. I don't even know. Next year I want to see them reopen Kensha Hall and not use it

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:10.440
as a parking lot. That would be pretty cool. Help thin out the crowds a little bit and

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:15.500
give the indies and foreign companies more place to grow. That would be really cool.

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:21.400
And I would like to see some of the game companies that are too good for booths these days come

01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:27.520
back. That's what I would like to see happen. Yeah I'm kind of with Shane. I get the appointment

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:31.080
thing though. I understand. Especially with something like 14. I think they should have

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:35.400
done that by appointment. I think it should have been more like the Civ 5 thing where

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:41.840
someone else demoed it. But that's just me. I get it sometimes. So anyway that's it. We're

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:46.040
going to wrap up and call it a podcast. Thank you guys for listening to these special podcasts.

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:48.920
I know the audio quality has been kind of crap compared to the shows. I know you guys

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:52.900
miss Jamie's Classic Game of the Week and Loki's Rants. But don't worry. It is all coming

01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:57.480
back this Sunday night. We're going to have DarkSakura and Loki and myself all kind of

01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:01.260
wrapping up E3 all over again and picking up on some of the other news that happened

01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:06.040
while the event was going on. So that's going to do it. Thank you so much for tuning in

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:14.980
and downloading the little show. Rob Robertson Pals, our E3 specials. See you Sunday night

01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:36.960
for more Orange Lounge Radio. Goodbye.
