Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and the Lowkey

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, January 10th, 2010, Microsoft shows us their game room at CES,

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
a popular Nintendo Wii game is no longer being published,

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
and could NBA Jam be making a comeback?

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
We are that program dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you for the next three hours.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
Also, as always, the one and only lovely DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Hi.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
How are you?

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Frustrated.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
I'm sorry to hear that. Why are you frustrated?

00:52.000 --> 00:59.000
Because I realized that I started stitching in two wide stitches, well, actually stitches too many,

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
on this tube scarf I was making, so now I have a doll-sized tube dress.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Well, you know, if you decide that you don't want it, you could always set it on fire.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
That would be pretty amazing.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
But that would mean setting my stuff on fire.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Well, you know, at least you could watch it go down in a blaze of glory.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Also, say hello to the one and only pyromaniac tech master, Lowkey.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Hello.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
How are you?

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
I'm fine.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Have you set fire to anything this week?

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
No.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Not this time. All right.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
Well, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com,

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
That's at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
So thanks, of course, to the folks at All Games Radio for letting us steal their bandwidth, as they do every Sunday night.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
We do have a lot of news to get into tonight, but of course we always started off with a little bit of how was our gaming week.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
But we're going to mix it up a little bit tonight because we did something special this week.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I know a lot of you guys have been listening to this show for a little while.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
But if it is your first time listening, hello, welcome.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
You know, it's just like three friends who met a long time ago at an arcade, believe it or not.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
Playing DDR was the game we used to play back in the day and decided to start a radio show about games.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
And here we are almost eight years later still doing our show.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Pretty amazing.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Anyhow.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Translation?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Give us jobs.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Professional jobs.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Here's the thing.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
We don't hang out a lot like we used to during the week.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
You know, this show is kind of the way we all hang out.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
I mean, once in a while there's a party or something's going on.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
And it's not like we avoid each other.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
It's just we're all busy.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
You know, I work a day job.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Dark Sakura has school and other things she's got to do.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
I'm avoiding you.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
And Loki, you know, just bought a house.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
And they both have the married life going on.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
And I'm driving to the Bay Area for stuff all the time.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
We don't see each other an awful lot during the week.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
But this week was a little different.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
We actually went on an O.L.R. date.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
Dark Sakura, myself, and Loki all went to see Avatar.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
As many of you have apparently because it's what?

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
It's already like the number three highest grossing movie ever.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
And it looks like, based on the take this week,

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
there's a very good chance it's going to take over the Batman movie.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
They're saying it could even take over Titanic.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
So a lot of you have seen the movie.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
So I don't know if we're going to sit here and review it

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
because, you know, most of you have already seen it it sounds like.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
But how about our thoughts on the movie?

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
Because we did get to see it in 3D,

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
which I thought was, you know, kind of different

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
because I don't see a lot of movies in 3D.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
I mean, it's kind of a new thing.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
The only other movie I've seen in 3D was Up,

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
which, you know, didn't use the 3D as heavily.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Like, I didn't think the 3D kind of added a lot to Up.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
But certainly Avatar kind of added some stuff to it.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Loki, what did you think of Avatar?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
This is your second time seeing it, right?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Yes, it is.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
By the way, keep it spoiler free

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
because some of our chatters have not seen it yet and want to.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Have you seen Pocahontas?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
You've seen Avatar.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
I call it Space Pocahontas.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Or FernGully.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
FernGully means Pocahontas in space with Smurfs.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
No, I like just...

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Even the technology behind the whole movie is pretty awesome.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
Like, a lot of the 3D stuff, it's not so much, you know,

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Hey, look, we made a 3D movie,

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
so we're going to have tons of stuff flying at your face.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Or, you know, we're going to scare you.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Ooh, look, it's coming towards you.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
You know, nothing like that.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
It's just really cool looking.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Like, a lot of the shots, you know, look very realistic.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
And it's kind of amazing when you think about it

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
that all the backgrounds and everything in the movie

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
are really computer generated.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
And, I mean, a lot of it you kind of forget that it is

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
because it looks really good.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
But the storyline, I mean, it's just all right.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
It's not, you know, you don't really go to see this movie

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
because, you know, it's such a deep storyline.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
It's just very predictable, but it's got great characters in it,

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
and it's just a fun movie.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Darsagra, what did you think?

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Well, I had very low expectations,

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
and then my expectations were sort of pooped on.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
I thought it was really good.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
I'm going to see it again, because you know me.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
If I like a movie once, I'll see it twice.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
How many times did you see Silent Hill in the theaters?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Like, four or five?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Four.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
I saw Star Trek eight times.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Oh, my God.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
But keep in mind, when it got to the cheapo theater,

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
I was just going every week.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Oh, I gotcha.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Although, actually, I think five of my times seeing it

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
were in the full-price theater.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
So, if that's any indication.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
I think that the 3D was implemented very, very nicely.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Instead of, like Loki said, of it being,

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
ah, 3D, ah, it was more immersive.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Like, there were a few things that did surprise me

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
as far as just, you know,

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
I really have no other comparison to put this to,

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
but you know, the head tracking mode for Wii,

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
that little hack, it made me think of that.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Because it almost felt sometimes like you could peek around

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
the screen and see stuff inside of it,

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
or if you moved closer, you'd get a wider view.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
It was that kind of immersion.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
And it actually did not give me a headache,

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
because the other movies I've seen in 3D was

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
I saw Nightmare Before Christmas twice in IMAX, in 3D.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
And that gave me kind of a headache and made me pass out.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
You know, I was explaining that I have a problem with 3D,

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
because I tend to get really motion sick.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
But I think I only got motion sick once,

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
and that was in the flying, one of the big flying scenes.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
And other than that, I mean,

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
especially since I wear glasses

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
and was wearing the 3D glasses over my glasses,

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
I didn't really have as bad of a problem as I expected to,

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
except when I took the 3D glasses off,

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
I had a big adjustment,

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
because I'm looking through two lenses

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
trying to get the 3D effect out of it.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
But story-wise, yeah, predictable.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
We saw this coming.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
But it was predictable in a gratifying way,

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
I want to say, if that makes sense.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Like, oh, yeah, that's a little bit more

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
than what I thought would happen with it.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Or, yeah, that's how that should go.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
I'm fine with that.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
But I liked it.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I was already looking up stuff online.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
There's gonna be a sequel, which I'm looking forward to,

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
although I'm wondering what direction

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
they're gonna go with it.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
But, yeah, actually, I'm really impressed.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
As a language nerd, I was very impressed

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
with the construction of the language.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Yeah, I guess they built that language for the movie.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Like, some professor at a university did it.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
Yeah, a linguistics professor created the language.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
And it actually...

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Some of the other ones that I've studied,

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
it uses, actually, the grammar structures

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
very similar to American Sign Language.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
And I notice it actually has things in common

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
with Japanese and with American Sign Language

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
in terms of your object order.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
So I was actually pretty, pretty pleased with that.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Reading just so much more into it,

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
I have to say that I'm impressed overall

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
with the work that went into it.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
And with the fluidity of the motion capture,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
that was very impressive, and I know that that was

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
a pretty new technology that they used with it, too.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
I also went back and read an interview

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
as to why people were blue.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Because, and to paraphrase the quote,

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
it's that, well, it was to contrast

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
with the skin tones of humans, first of all,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
to enhance the bioluminescence,

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
because everything on the planet was bioluminescent.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
And also, because they'd already done Little Green Men.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
They wanted them to be blue.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Nice.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Yeah. So, overall, I have to say,

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
I like a movie that a lot of thought and energy

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
had been put into, and it was very clear

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
that a lot of work went into this,

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
and you could see it in the final production, so.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
And that, and I wanted to punch that guy in the face.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
Not the Marine.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
The Colonel guy.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Yeah, because he actually, he's what I expected him to be.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
I wanted no redemption out of him.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I'm not trying to spoil it,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
and I know most of you have seen it.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
I wanted no redemption out of him.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
I wanted him to be a hard ass to the end, and he sure was.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
But it was the corporate guy.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
Because you could almost see him thinking about it.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
And then, ooh, dollars.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
So, and I've seen him in other stuff,

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
and I can't think of what.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
That you gotta IMDB it.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Yeah.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
So, yeah.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
You might remember, I kind of came out before this movie,

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
and I was like, I just hope it tanks.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Like, it looks terrible from the trailer,

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
and James Cameron's kind of an arrogant ass,

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
and, you know, just after Titanic,

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
I just kind of wanted to see the movie tank.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
So I went in with very low expectations.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Like, I was kind of like Dark Saga.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
All right, what the hell.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
I'll go.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
I got three hours to kill.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Let's go see the damn movie.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
I was wrong.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
It was good.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
It was a good movie.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Props to Cameron.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
You did it again.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
It was good.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
Was it like OMG Oscar winning story and all this?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
No.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
I mean, the story you've kind of heard before,

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
but it's effective.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
And I know here we are, a video game podcast,

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
talking about movies,

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
but I want to kind of bring this back to video games a little bit,

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
because honestly, I kind of thought the movie

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
was just a giant video game.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
Like, the graphics were really good in Avatar.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
You know, and that's kind of one of the things.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
I was like, wow, the landscape is really pretty.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
The way the Navi were done was really pretty,

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
and just everything about the movie was really, really pretty.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
And so the game had great graphics.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
And even the story, I got to be honest,

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
the story, without getting into spoilery,

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
I was really reminded of Final Fantasy VII.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
There was a lot of tie-ins to me with Final Fantasy VII,

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
and you have to admit,

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
there was an epic boss battle at the end of the movie,

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
which is to be expected.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
I really was epic.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
Also, that guy, I actually remember him from My Name is Earl.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Ah, there you go.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
So, it was very epic.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
I think in some ways,

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
and this is going to sound like a much bigger compliment

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
than maybe the movie actually deserves,

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
but I actually think in some ways,

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
this movie is going to be like this generation's Wizard of Oz.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Like, because if you think about it,

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
The Wizard of Oz was actually not like that great of a movie,

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
but it's one of those ones we kind of all remember

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
because it was that musical that we all remember,

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
and it was that color.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
It was the first color movie we all kind of remember.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Obviously, not all of us were alive when that movie first came out,

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
but it meant a lot for color.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
And I think Avatar is going to be a lot of that for 3D,

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
even though it might not be the best or most original story in the world.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
I think they're going to look back on this years from now

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
and say this is when 3D started being a big thing.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
But I'm kind of, I'm a little worried about it

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
because I got to say, the 3D kind of bugged me.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
Like, it wasn't, and I didn't think it was gimmicky or anything like that,

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
but the 3D bugged me because I had to take those glasses off

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
like every 10 minutes because I actually was like hurting my eyes.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
And the same thing kind of happened when I was watching Up.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
Like, I just, I can't sit there and do the 3D the whole time.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
It's kind of a pain on my eyes.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
So that was the only, I mean, it looked nice, don't get me wrong,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
and I thought it definitely was kind of like something I haven't seen before,

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
but I'm a little worried because, you know, Consumer Electronics Show is this week,

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
obviously, bringing it back to gaming a little bit,

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
and although there was some gaming news we'll get to later a little bit,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
it was more about the tech and the gadgets.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
That's what CES is about.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
One of the big, big things they're talking about this year, 3D television.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
Is 3D TV is like the big thing, and this actually kind of worries me

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
because I'm like, I kind of don't want my TV to be 3D

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
because it hurts to watch.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
I seriously doubt that's going to be the case

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
because it would require, you know, the glasses and everything.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
They should have, it would probably be an option.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
But they're talking about ESPN and 3D and all this stuff.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
Like, I realize, you know, nobody's going to make me tune to that network,

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
but it's definitely kind of the wave of the future,

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
and I hope they find a way to make it less painful.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
So, go to our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
AlphaKananagram says, Sky said the game had good graphics. LMFAO.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Yeah, I mean, seriously, I found the movie to be very much like a video game.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
It was kind of a cliche plot, but it was executed very well.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
I'm not saying it was executed very, very well.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
I actually think, what's her name?

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
That Zoe Saldana, the one that was Uhura in Star Trek.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
She would, dude, she should like get nominated for an Oscar.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
Honestly, I honestly mean that. She was amazingly good.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Yeah.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
But, and Sigourney Weaver, oh my God, love her.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
I do have to tell you, the movie scene, the full thing's going to be in the DVD release.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Could he?

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
But, I'm not going to praise all the actors

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
because I can't fucking stand Michelle Rodriguez.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
I cannot stand her. She brought the movie down for me.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
But at least she wasn't in a lot of scenes.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Yeah, she definitely was like a supporting actress.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Yeah.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Yeah.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
But I'm just not a fan of her, so I, bleh.

13:16.000 --> 13:22.000
You know that there cannot be a Cameron movie without the angry Hispanic chick.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
You know what?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
I don't think there was one in Titanic.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
Yeah, but aliens high.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
So, anyway, reading some of the comments from chat.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
SSJ100Matt says, I wouldn't go that far.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
It was okay, but I don't see it lasting the test of time like Wizard of Oz.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
It's, I think it's too early to say.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Like, again, I don't think people are going to go back and go,

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
oh, this is like just a phenomenal fucking movie.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Like, The Lord of the Rings will be.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
I think they're going to look back on that one time.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
I don't know. I went back to The Wizard of Oz after a while

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
because I used to, you know, I used to like that movie

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
and I find it really grating on my ears now

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
and just a really annoying, awful movie.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
So, I don't know if Wizard of Oz has, you know, lasted the test of time either

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
because you watch it and you're like, wow, this kind of sucks.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
Now, however, The Return to Oz, I think that's a way better movie anyways

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
because there's no singing in it.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
I think the singing really brought it down.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
Well, Return to Oz was based off the books in particular.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
As they should do some more movies based off the books.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
SSJ100Matt in chat says also, I don't think the 3D added all that much to it.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
It was nice without it.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
I kind of agree. I think I would have still felt the same about the movie

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
had I seen it in 2D.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
But 3D did give that little extra kick.

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
You know, that little extra wow factor that really brought the graphics,

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
so to speak, home.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Like, that planet was beautiful.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
And I'm actually excited to play the game.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
And sure enough, Loki managed to...

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Not only did he get us free tickets to the movie.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Thank you very much, Loki. We appreciate it.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
Now he scrounged up a copy of Avatar the Game on PlayStation 3.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
So, Dark Soccer and I are going to kind of trade it back and forth

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
since I'm going to be traveling this next week.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
She's going to borrow it and then I'm going to take it.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
So, you're going to have a 3D TV because that is in 3D if you have a 3D TV?

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
That's what I hear. You know what? I'll pass anyway.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
Well, no. I think that my TV is capable.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Do you have the glasses for it?

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
I stole the ones from the theater.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
Yeah, but different TVs have different 3D...

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
Unless your TV supports real D, then those glasses will work with that.

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
If they don't, or if it doesn't, then you may need shutter glasses or something like that.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
We've actually got shutter glasses for the...

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
Oh, crap. The Master System.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
Well, speaking of 3D, my boyfriend bought Coraline on Blu-ray,

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
and that comes with the red and blue, I think, because we were watching it a little bit.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
It's green and magenta.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
I didn't watch the whole movie. I haven't seen the movie yet,

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
but he wanted to see a couple clips to see how it played out.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
And it was okay, but again, my eyes just don't take well.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
In the theater, though, the 3D in Coraline was awesome.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
But they did the same type of thing they did in Avatar, right?

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
The real 3D, or whatever it's called, right?

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
Real D, yeah. I think real D would be the best option,

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
because, man, those shutter glasses are expensive.

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
They're like $200 a piece, and if you're gonna get some for your friends and stuff like that,

16:09.000 --> 16:15.000
forget about it. But real D, man, those glasses are so damn cheap to manufacture,

16:15.000 --> 16:21.000
it's almost as cheap as the red-blue glasses, but you don't have the color distortion in it.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
Alright, so I know you're all joking that, hey, we're turning into movie lounge radio all of a sudden,

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
but hey, there's a reason we're talking about this, because Avatar has done so well

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
that I think, honestly, the CES, this 3D TV, Avatar's gonna be a big release.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
You know they're gonna try to make it 3D somehow on its release.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
Whatever they do with the home version, whether it be the red-blue or the real D,

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
but you'd have to have a TV. I don't know what the hell they're gonna do.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
And I think it will come over to games.

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
Where the movie goes, games will soon go, and this might be something that's in the PlayStation 4,

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
the Xbox 720, and whatever other hypothetical system you wanna come up with.

16:58.000 --> 17:04.000
I just kinda hope, again, that they find a way to make it easier on the eyes,

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
and that they don't rely on it as a crutch, that it gets too gimmicky.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
You know, it's gonna be the gimmick for the first year it comes out,

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
they're gonna overdo it with everything, and then they're gonna slack back off,

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
just like with everything else.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Let's talk about our gaming weeks. Enough movies.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Let's actually talk about the video games we've been playing this week.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
Dark Soccer, what kind of games have you been playing this week?

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
Well, mostly watching Dan play Borderlands.

17:30.000 --> 17:37.000
I played Lumines on Steam, and then was very disappointed to realize that Shining wasn't in it.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
And, of course, Peggle.

17:40.000 --> 17:46.000
I finally beat one of those crappy extra point levels, you know, that I was yelling at.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
And once I did it, I actually managed to beat another one after that,

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
but now I'm on the million point level, and I'm like, oh, whatever.

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
Also, I've got Silent Hill, Shattered Memories, but I haven't had a chance to play it,

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
because, again, I haven't been able to get Dan's butt off of Borderlands.

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
And he hasn't got me Bayonetta yet, which makes me weep.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
You've got to get him to get that for you.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
All right.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Real quick, to go back to what we were talking about before,

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
remember how they were talking about 3D TV at CES?

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
Well, the format that they're kind of working towards is Realty, actually,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
so that would be kind of cool.

18:26.000 --> 18:32.000
And they're, I guess, partnering with Sony, JVC, Samsung, Toshiba, Panasonic, and DirecTV.

18:32.000 --> 18:37.000
So, that would be the best way to go, I think,

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
because, like I said, glasses are cheap, not intrusive.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Anyways, so games.

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
I actually got to play some of the stuff I've been meaning to play and putting off for a while.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
I finally played Borderlands, and it's awesome.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Very fun game.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
I've actually played it for a few hours.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
I'm only level seven right now, but I did finish killing Nineto,

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
which is one of the characters in the game.

19:03.000 --> 19:10.000
And, I don't know, the game itself reminds me a lot of Final Fantasy XI with guns,

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
because a lot of the enemies and stuff, they have certain spawn points in the game,

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
and you see them kind of just wandering around and stuff like that,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
like you would in Final Fantasy VII,

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
just without all the other people running around with you.

19:23.000 --> 19:29.000
And you have kind of different zones you can kind of zone into to kill different creatures and whatnot.

19:29.000 --> 19:35.000
And it just reminds me so much with the quests and the findings of Final Fantasy XI.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Although, at the same time, it's a little bit more like Diablo,

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
because there's a lot of, like, okay, you find these random chests on the ground,

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
you can open them up, and there's money there,

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
or the enemies drop ammo and money and all that fun stuff.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Plus, there's all the random weapons in the game,

19:49.000 --> 19:55.000
since there's literally three-quarters of a million weapons in the game.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
So there's all these different unique weapons.

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
It's got this pistol that sets things on fire, so that's pretty awesome.

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
But it's just really cool, and I'm really disappointed that it took me so long to play the game,

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
but I definitely will be playing it for a long time,

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
and probably will download the download content later on,

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
as soon as I get a little further in the game.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Must play the island of Dr. Ned.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
It's all about shooting brains out of their skulls.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Seriously.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Awesome.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
You guys are making me want to play this game, like, very badly.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Get it, Rob? Play it. I can't play it, you know.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
When I talk about my gaming week, I'll tell you why I can't play Borderlands yet,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
because I'm too distracted.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
The other thing is, um, non-kind of gaming.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Well, I've also been playing Grand Theft Auto.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
I actually played some Grand Theft Auto this weekend,

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
because I was trying to just play some more online games,

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
just with some other people other than my coworkers and stuff,

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
because I've been kicking the crap out of my coworkers a lot,

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
to the point where they're getting really frustrated with me,

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
and the people online that we play with get really frustrated with me,

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
and they end up dropping because I just kicked the crap out of them.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
And, you know, not to sound like, oh, I'm the best person ever.

21:03.000 --> 21:08.000
I doubt that I am, but this weekend, though, playing with just random games,

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
you know, other people hosting games, their settings, whatever they want to do,

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
I still kicked the crap out of everybody.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
So modest.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
And a lot of them dropped.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
And there's even people that were blatantly cheating, you know,

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
using lag switches and turbo controllers and stuff like that,

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
and I still kicked the crap out of them.

21:24.000 --> 21:30.000
So, I mean, I don't know what to do, and everybody keeps dropping.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I really hate that everybody drops out of the games.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
I mean, seriously, just try a little bit.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
You know, maybe you'll learn something, get a little bit better,

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
instead of just quitting because you just can't seem to kill somebody.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
I don't know.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Whatever.

21:45.000 --> 21:50.000
But, so, yeah, I've been working my way up the ranks.

21:50.000 --> 21:56.000
Right now, I think I'm in the, I know I'm in the top 300 on Lost and Damned

21:56.000 --> 22:01.000
out of ranked death matches, probably up 250 by now.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
But I've been working my way up to number one,

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
so hopefully I'll hit that at some point.

22:05.000 --> 22:11.000
I know I'm up there, whereas my other coworkers are in the 700s to 1,000s.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
So I'm just looking for a challenge out there,

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
and I really hope that people that play online would stop dropping

22:19.000 --> 22:25.000
because it's ridiculous and very frustrating.

22:25.000 --> 22:32.000
And, let's see, other than Xbox 360 stuff, I worked on the cabinet a little bit more.

22:32.000 --> 22:37.000
I played a little bit Tubin this week because Jim came over and he wanted to play Tubin.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
So I tried that, and man, that's hard to control.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
I forgot how hard that game was.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
So that was kind of cool.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
And then next week, I should be getting some Xbox 360 repair kits

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
for the Red Ring of Death stuff, mainly just because I didn't really want to send out.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
I have six systems just waiting to be repaired,

22:56.000 --> 23:02.000
and one of them I can actually send back to Microsoft, the other few of them.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
I'm just going to try to repair real quick.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
If it doesn't work, then oh well, I'll just send it out to somebody to repair it.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
But I had one that I repaired, and it worked for a while.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
So, you know, I'll give it a shot.

23:17.000 --> 23:29.000
And I also got a, what is it, a Cyclops, a Cygnus 2 mod chip for one of my 360s.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
So I'm going to play with that, assuming I can get it soldered on there.

23:32.000 --> 23:38.000
Because, I don't know, I had good luck with my Wii mod chip.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
I was able to solder that.

23:40.000 --> 23:46.000
Not so much with my PSP when I tried modding that into the arcade cabinet.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
So I'm 50-50 right now.

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
Maybe Dan can help you, because he repairs the pinball tables all the time.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
He's really good with soldering.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I think I'm going to give it a go.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
I don't think it'll be too difficult. I have to see how small the points are.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
A PSP is damn hard.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Even with a magnifying glass, I couldn't see the points on there,

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
because they were so close together.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
I think on a 360 board, it's a little bit more spread apart.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
So it should be alright.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
And they have crap on their board where nothing wants to solder to it anyway.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
I don't know if it came up on last week's show,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
because I think the exchange happened before the show.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
But I gave Loki my old 360, the one that broke, for him to try to fix.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
I hope it's one that comes out okay.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
And I told Loki he could keep it if he fixes it, because I have a new one now.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
So he could use it for his Grand Theft Auto death matches, work, whatever he's going to do with it.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Whatever machine he wants to build, I don't care.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Get rid of it is really what it is.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Literally, people keep giving me 360s.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
They're all, hey, it's broken, I bought another one, here you go.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
I'm like, awesome!

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
I'll tell you what, if you get one working, I'll totally buy a mod chip if you want to get rid of one.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
What do you mean, buy a mod chip?

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
Like, if you get rid of any of them, then I'll mod it.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
Well, it all depends on what firmware some of them are.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
I know my sister's console, the one she was using,

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
if I could get that fixed, is an old enough firmware where I can run the mod chip on it.

25:05.000 --> 25:12.000
The other one's not so sure because we were using those and they were pretty much updated.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
So those may not work.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
I just have to look at them.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
But there may be one or two of them that might work.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
At least one, I know.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
So that's why I only got one mod chip.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
Well, yeah, I'll find.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Alright.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Anyway, my gaming week, I played a lot.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
A lot, a lot of stuff this week, so let me try to run down it really quick.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
I played off a listener tip last week.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
It came in on Twitter.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
Somebody told me there was this game on the Windows Live,

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
the Games for Windows Live that's free if you download it.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Tinker is the name of the game.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
And I played it.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
And when we brought it up on the show last week,

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
we were talking about how the game has achievements

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
and we weren't sure how it interfaces with Xbox Live.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
Dude, it interfaces really good with Xbox Live.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
Those achievements do count towards your gamer score.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
It will even come up, like if I look on my recent games on the Xbox 360,

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
I see Tinker.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
I see a card for it with all the achievements.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
And I can look at it just like as any other game on my 360.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
I kind of thought that was cool.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
And then when I was actually playing the game,

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
you could access like an Xbox Live-ish type of interface

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
where I could see my friends that were online playing Xbox Live.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
And I'm sure if they were looking at me,

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
they would see me playing the Tinker game.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
As far as Tinker itself, okay, it's a free game.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
And that's pretty much what it's worth.

26:24.000 --> 26:29.000
I mean, it's a puzzle game that's not very different than things we've seen before.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
It kind of takes the scene of like a child's room

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
and kind of takes this 3D isometric approach

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
to get the robot from point A to B, but you have to use switches.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
And there's toy guns and dominoes and dice and things that get in the way.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
Eh, it's free. It's worth just playing for a little bit.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Hey, if you're an achievement score whore,

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
go download it for like 30 gamerscore pretty easy

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
just by beating the tutorial levels.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
It's not that hard to do.

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
So, you know, it was cute, but I wouldn't have paid a lot of money for it

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
because it's a puzzle we've seen before.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
And I don't like the 3D thing because in later levels

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
they're like, you have to turn the camera around to be able to see everything.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
But when you turn the camera around, it's not very seamless.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
It's just kind of like flips the screen 90 degrees by redeploying.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
Like it doesn't actually show the screen rotating like I think we've come to expect.

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
It just kind of switches the display to, you know, turning it 90 degrees.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
A little bit disappointed with that.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
So, you know, whatever. It's free, so why not?

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
But I'm hearing, though, if you kind of run an older OS

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
or you might have some problems with a game for Windows Live.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
So, there you go.

27:33.000 --> 27:37.000
I spent a little bit of time just playing some various Xbox Live arcade games

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
because there were some that I hadn't really played a whole lot of.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
Like Sonic 2 and R-Type, a lot of the classically redone ones.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
I have to admit, R-Type, when you play it in crazy camera mode

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
where it's all like that tilted 3D, it's kind of cool.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Hard to play, but cool.

27:51.000 --> 27:56.000
Isn't, though, just the remixed versions, the HD versions?

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
I was pretty impressed. Yeah, it's nice.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
But R-Type is still fucking hard.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
I forgot to say the other game that we had going on.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
What's that?

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Was Raiden 4, and you should give that a try.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
It actually was really fun.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
I will.

28:07.000 --> 28:12.000
Also, I played quite a bit of Bayonetta on the 360.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
Checked out the game this week, and I love it.

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
It's great. It's over the top. It's excess.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
We were kind of watching the introduction movie,

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
just laughing and laughing, because it's so over the top.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
It's so unnecessary, but great.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
I can't even explain it.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
The game is a bit of a button masher.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
I mean, you just kind of punch, punch, kick, kick, dodge,

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
but I don't think it really has to be.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
If you kind of know what you're doing,

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
you do have to time your dodges right.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
You do have to perform certain types of moves at certain points,

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
but you can kind of get away, especially in the first few levels,

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
of doing a bunch of button mashing.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
Keep in mind, I'm also playing on normal.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
I think the easier modes are kind of brought down to a point

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
where you really can just, like, slam on one button,

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
and you do all sorts of tricks.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
But in the end, I kind of felt that the game is rewarding,

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
and there was a lot more depth to it

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
than I was getting the impression from from the demo.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
I honestly have to say, this is one of the better games I've played on the 360.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
I am having that much fun with it.

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
It's fun. It's excess. It's over the top. It's stupid.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
It's what a video game should be.

29:15.000 --> 29:20.000
I think it's great, and there's a lot of very tongue-in-cheek humor in it.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
There's references to other Sega games in it.

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
I love the fact that, and I'm not really spoiling too much,

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
because this is in the first two minutes of the game,

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
when they're kind of doing the credits,

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
all the names of the people are on tombstones,

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
and then the director's name came up, right?

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Same guy that did, like, Devil May Cry and all that,

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
and it opens with somebody peeing on his grave.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
Like, what a good, like, tongue-in-cheek, not-taking-yourself-seriously type of thing.

29:44.000 --> 29:50.000
I had a lot of fun with the game, and many lols were had, and I want to play more of it.

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
The only really downside is that I didn't notice, like, any type of, like,

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
multiplayer or how it really interfaced with live.

29:57.000 --> 30:02.000
I mean, I guess there's leaderboards and stuff, but I had a really good time with it.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
It's very arcade-y.

30:03.000 --> 30:08.000
If you like arcade games, like, I almost expect I should be putting in a quarter to play this game.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Some of the boss battles are quite epic.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
But, yeah, it's a little bit of a button masher, but a lot of arcade games were.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
So if you like those quarter-munching arcade games, I think you will like this.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
And, um, yeah, actdeft in our chatroom chat that orangehonestradio.com says,

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Bayonetta has rings, like Sonic the Hedgehog rings.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
They're called Halos, but yeah, they work just like the Sonic rings, really.

30:26.000 --> 30:31.000
I totally see this as being, like, the diva of the Xbox.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Well, keep in mind it's multiplatform.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
They're on PS3 as well.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
The diva of the game world, then.

30:37.000 --> 30:41.000
It would be a tragedy if there is no sequel announced to this game.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
I really hope they do a sequel in the same vein.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
And I'm not even, like, that far into it.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
I'm only a couple hours in.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
I need to play more.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
I just haven't had a lot of time this weekend.

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
Because I was playing another game, and it's one I don't think I can talk about,

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
because there was a non-disclosure agreement, I clicked through really quickly without reading.

30:58.000 --> 31:04.000
I will just say that it's a very popular closed beta that's going on right now for an upcoming PC game.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
But I can't tell you what game it is.

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
And I would not base my review off a game off a closed beta.

31:10.000 --> 31:15.000
But I thought that this game, it's a game that there's kind of a lot of hype behind it.

31:15.000 --> 31:20.000
And I, including myself, I've hyped this game up before previously.

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
I'm not sure the game lived up 100% to the hype.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
But there were certain things about it that I really liked.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
And there were certain parts of the game I was kind of like,

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
Oh, this is slow. Get on with it.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
I'm not having any fun right now.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Just kind of, let's get past this part.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Let's blow shit up and move on.

31:39.000 --> 31:47.000
So, however, one other thing I want to say about it is that PC games, you know what?

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
They really have these demanding system requirements.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
I was not able to play this game on my own computer.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
And my own computer is only like a year old.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
I had to go play it on my boyfriend's computer,

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
because he has a better system than I do and a better video card and all that.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
And even still, it was a little bit choppy.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
However, I have to remember in a closed beta,

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
sometimes these things are sending data to the server all the time.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
It might be running a little bit slow on purpose.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
So I can't, again, base a review off of it.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
But I'm not as excited as I was.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
I probably will still pick up the full version just to check it out.

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
But at the same time, I still have WoW and all these other games to play

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
and all this other stuff.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
So, we'll see.

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
Also, they've got to fix the interface in this particular game I'm thinking of,

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
because it's a game where you can chat with other players,

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
because that's the type of game it is.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
I couldn't stay on top of chat, because the box is so frickin' small,

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
like no text fits in it at all.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
So, there you go.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Anyhow, that was my thoughts on that.

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
More thoughts on that when the beta is unleashed to the public,

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
which is happening next week, which is very good news.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
All right, let's see.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
That's pretty much it for our gaming weeks.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Let's move on to a little bit of housekeeping news.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
Okay, live listeners, I have a little bit of bad news, guys.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
We're not going to be live for the next two weeks in our normal time slot,

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
and it's really all my fault, and I apologize for that.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Next week is a three-day week for a lot of folks in America,

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
because of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
I'm actually taking a trip to Seattle,

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
and I am not flying back till Monday,

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
so I won't even be here at all that weekend.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
So, we will be taking next week off completely.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
There will be no show next week at all.

33:21.000 --> 33:26.000
There might be a best of that hits the feed if it's done in time,

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
so stay tuned to our podcast feed.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
However, the week after on the 24th, again, I won't be here,

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
but that's just because I have Sunday evening plans,

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
and I'll admit, because it is a little bit gaming-related, actually,

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
I'm going to see Utada Hikaru live at one of her shows.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
She's in San Francisco on the 24th,

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
and I forgot it was a Sunday when I bought the tickets,

33:44.000 --> 33:48.000
but what a rare opportunity to see a Japanese superstar in a small venue.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
She's playing the film more, which is not a very big venue at all,

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
so I'm going to go see that.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Sorry, I'm not going to apologize for it,

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
because I'm really looking forward to it,

33:56.000 --> 34:00.000
but we're actually going to take kind of a bad situation for the show

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
and make it good, because for a long time,

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
we've been promising an earlier show for our overseas listeners,

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
so what we're going to do on the 24th,

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
we're going to tape a show at 10 a.m.,

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
which will be 6 o'clock Greenwich time,

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
which is in the same time zone as London.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
I have to make sure that's okay with all games.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
That's not official yet.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
I have to run that by the powers that be at all games.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
However, since there's no other live show on that early,

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
I don't see it being a problem,

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
but I just have to make sure all the sign-offs are approved on that,

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
so stay tuned to our Twitter,

34:31.000 --> 34:35.000
but we are looking at doing the overseas show that Sunday.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Also, if you just want to get up early,

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
if you happen to be up at 10 o'clock Pacific,

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
or that would only be about 1 in the afternoon Eastern,

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
we will be doing a show that week,

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
and that will still go to the podcast feed as always,

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
so there you go.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Let's see.

34:49.000 --> 35:00.000
Sorry, I apologize for the dead air.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
I'm just trying to catch up on everything going on.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
They're talking about the game

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
because they all know what I'm talking about,

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
but I don't want to say just because.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
There's been previews of it everywhere left and right,

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
but it's just one of those things I just would rather not

35:12.000 --> 35:17.000
without me knowing exactly what I can and can't say.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
It looks like that best of might be ready.

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
We just have to get our intros done for it, so we'll see.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
Anyway, yes, so no show next week at all.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
It won't be on the podcast feed or anything,

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
although there might be a best of,

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
which if it's a best of,

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
it's not going to be stuff you've heard

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
in the past couple weeks.

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
It's going to be stuff from the first couple years of OLR.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
It's old shit, so to many of you,

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
you won't have heard it before,

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
so it'll be like a new show.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Then, of course, we'll do the early show,

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
10 a.m. Pacific next Sunday pending,

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
but that would, of course, be six o'clock Greenwich time

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
for those of you overseas,

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
so those of you who should be excited about that

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
because we've been promising that for quite a while.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
All right, that's it for housekeeping.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
Of course, twitter.com slash OLR,

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
facebook.com slash OrangeLawnsRadio join us there.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Let's get into some gaming news.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Loki, what was some of the big news this week?

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Well, there's lots of stuff this week.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
We're going to start things off talking a little bit

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
about Microsoft's Game Room,

36:11.000 --> 36:16.000
and basically, I don't know if you would call this

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
their answer to home.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
I don't really know if it's that.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
You may remember a while back,

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
we talked about a survey that went out

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
that kind of talked about a place where you'd be able

36:28.000 --> 36:32.000
to walk your avatars around and play arcade games.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Well, that's what this is.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
They're going to have a bunch of different arcade games.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Some of the stuff they showed off

36:37.000 --> 36:43.000
were, I know that there was different Atari 2600 games on there.

36:43.000 --> 36:49.000
They had other things including like, you know, Centipede.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
I'm trying to remember the other games that were on there

36:51.000 --> 36:55.000
that were pretty cool.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
But basically, they have all these...

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
There's some television stuff too.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Yeah, television.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
There's some Konami games on there.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
You know, all sorts of fun stuff.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
Here we go.

37:04.000 --> 37:08.000
Asteroids, Atari Football, Lunar Lander,

37:08.000 --> 37:13.000
Millipede, Outlaw, Pitfall, Red Baron, Road Fighter,

37:13.000 --> 37:17.000
Scramble, Tempest, all that kind of stuff that you would...

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Say I picked up at least two games there

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
that I've already bought on Xbox Live before.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Scramble and Tempest.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
So what's going to be unique about this is

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
you're going to be able to get your own gaming space

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
basically in these areas.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
You'll be able to customize little rooms

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
with a different theme,

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
what games you want in there,

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
what other wall ornaments and whatnot

37:36.000 --> 37:40.000
you want to stick in there.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Then they're also going to have games for purchase.

37:42.000 --> 37:48.000
Since this is going to be available on Xbox 360 and on PC,

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
they're going to have different things you can do.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
For example, you can purchase a game for 400 Microsoft points

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
or $5 that will basically license the game

37:56.000 --> 38:00.000
for unlimited play on Xbox 360 and PC.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
If you don't want to pay that,

38:01.000 --> 38:05.000
you can spend $3 or 240 Microsoft points

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
and get you a virtual arcade cabinet on one platform

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
at either Xbox 360 or PC,

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
probably the option I'll be going with.

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
And then also for people that want to just spend lots of money

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
or just... I don't really know why you'd do this,

38:20.000 --> 38:25.000
but for the old retro type of 40 Microsoft points or 50 cents

38:25.000 --> 38:30.000
will allow you to get you two quarters worth of playtime

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
on select titles for the authentic arcade experience, they call it.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
And the game room itself is actually being developed

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
by the third-party studio Chrome Studios,

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
who are behind Viva Pinata Party Animals,

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
Star Wars Republic Heroes, among many other things.

38:45.000 --> 38:49.000
They're planning on starting the service with 30 original arcade titles

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
with 1,000 planned for the next three years.

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
And also they're going to be available from a variety of publishers,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
including Atari, Activision, and television.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
And Konami.

39:01.000 --> 39:06.000
And apparently there's some more studios involved with it as well.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
They're going to have...

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
They're going to be presented in 1080p,

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
which I don't know why you'd do that, because they're old retro games.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Big fucking deal, yeah.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
They're going to have support for...

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
Well, they'll look sharp.

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
I mean, let's face it, if you hook up those old systems to the TV,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
the TVs now are not... I mean, if you even can,

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
TVs now can't... some of those systems can't even hook up to them.

39:27.000 --> 39:31.000
You know, they'll look sharp, that's for sure.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
Yeah. They'll support multiplayer for up to two players,

39:34.000 --> 39:38.000
as well as cross-platform leaderboards and achievements.

39:38.000 --> 39:43.000
And apparently that's launching this spring, so relatively soon.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
And the thing, though, about it, though,

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
is you can't freely walk around the game room like you can with home.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
It's basically your avatars are just there.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
At least when they're showing it off,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
they don't have the collision detection and everything done yet.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
So I don't know if you're going to be able to walk around just aimlessly and stuff,

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
but right now you kind of switch from room to room,

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
and there's different arcade games you can play.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
The thing I don't like about this is if I have to purchase the games

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
I've already purchased before again,

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
because now it's going to have these other features.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
I think if you have... you know, say you bought Frogger or something like that,

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
you know, on Xbox Live Arcade,

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
you should be able to have your Frogger arcade cabinet in the game.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
It's probably not going to work that way, but hey, probably not.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
You know, and it's... at least it's only three bucks.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
That's not too bad.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
What do you think about the whole fact that you can play it on your PC, though,

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
if you pay five bucks?

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Or I guess you get, what, three dollars for one platform,

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
five dollars for both platforms?

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
You know, PC for me, it's really a hard sale

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
because I have a MAME cabinet,

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
and sadly enough, you know, MAME ROMs are really easy to find,

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
and especially stuff that old can run on anything.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
I mean, anything.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
A crappy netbook, a crappy PC from like eight years ago

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
will still run, you know, those ROMs just fine.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
But no EP in this competition if you do it that way

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
because the whole leaderboards, medals, and all this stuff, right?

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
But, see, I don't know if I'm really going to be into this

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
because, like I said, I have MAME,

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
so why should I spend the money on this?

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
I mean, yeah, I get achievement points, but, you know,

41:16.000 --> 41:20.000
I kind of got over the whole achievement point whoring stuff

41:20.000 --> 41:25.000
because it's just, you know, the cost to buy games and stuff

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
just to get achievement points, it's just, it's not worth it.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Well, this is their way of legitimizing MAME, really.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
I mean, they're trying to, you know,

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
MAME is still not legal, folks. You're not supposed to have it.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Well, let me put it this way, okay?

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
Here's one way at least they'll have a step up above home.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
There's not going to be fucking lines for games.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
I don't have to like, you know, walk up to an arcade machine and go,

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
I'm sorry, you can't play this game right now because there's other people playing it.

41:50.000 --> 41:56.000
That's retarded when it comes to, you know, an online network like that.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
I mean, come on, you're launching a program.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
I understand that, you know, there's a fictional arcade game here,

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
but, dude, what the hell?

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
Why should I have to wait to play a game?

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
You know, Microsoft, well, let me ask Dark Soccer

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
because I know she's a classic gaming enthusiast.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
What do you think about this whole game room thing?

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
I like it. I mean, it'd be great to have on Xbox

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
because I do go back and play old stuff.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
I don't think I would necessarily do it as much on PC.

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
I mean, I think it's nice, especially for people who were into, you know,

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
the classic gaming, like, what was that rental thing that you did, GameTap?

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Yeah, GameTap, yeah.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
You know, and I've pulled a few stuff off of Steam, like I play Loom,

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
but that's really it.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
I wonder if we'll see any, like, new controllers and stuff.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Like, for one, they need to fix a D-pad.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
I mean, they've needed to fix a D-pad since day one.

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
But two, it'd be kind of neat to see, like, a trackball or something like that

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
that's kind of hooked up to the analog or something

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
where you could, you know, do some of the games.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Like, I know they had Crystal Castles on there.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
That's one of their launch games, yeah.

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
And see, the other thing, too, is that I have a lot of these games

43:00.000 --> 43:04.000
on the classic systems, and I do have the right controllers for them.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
And I admit it, not everyone's going to have everything,

43:07.000 --> 43:11.000
that everyone's, you know, got the vault or has been as nuts as Dan

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
and I have been about collecting the stuff.

43:13.000 --> 43:19.000
But me personally, I don't have a legitimate need to do the extra spending on it.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
I don't.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
And the other thing I think also, too, that people have been complaining about

43:23.000 --> 43:27.000
is, like, why should I pay $3 a game for these old Atari games

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
when I could just get a flashback for, like, 20 bucks

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
and it's got, like, 40 games on there?

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
There's also the community feature, I think, that has to be pointed out

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
is the fact that, you know, you set up your game room

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
so that your friends can come kind of to your game room and play the games.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
They haven't said, do they get to play them for free

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
or do they still have to pay, like, the quarters or what's the deal?

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
Or are they playing demos?

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Yeah, are they doing demos? What's the deal?

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
I mean, they haven't really given us the details there,

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
but there certainly is that whole idea of building up a collection,

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
which is your game room, and kind of checking out what other people have.

43:55.000 --> 43:59.000
And with a thousand planned games, I mean, there's certainly going to be that element of,

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
oh, you have never played this game before?

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
Come to my game room and look at it real quick.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
You know what they need to do, and this will be hilarious,

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
is have these trophies that you can earn or whatever achievements

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
with, like, little trophies that you can earn for your game room,

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
and have it so you can display your trophies,

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
and be home to the whole trophy display.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Well, I want to get back to that point in a minute,

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
but let me go to this real quick in our chat room, chat.orangetonstrategy.com.

44:21.000 --> 44:25.000
Tigerclaw in our chat says, why not have it so you can view the game as a spectator?

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
Think of it like this.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
You're at the arcade and there's a bunch of people playing the same game that you want to play.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
You look over their shoulders and watch the person in front play that game.

44:32.000 --> 44:36.000
And GS68 says, yeah, watching someone kick ass at so-and-so game in person

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
is better than watching a video on YouTube.

44:38.000 --> 44:43.000
Imagine if you could go into game room and watch somebody try to do a big Donkey Kong score.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Well, obviously, that wouldn't be one of the games, because it's a Nintendo game.

44:45.000 --> 44:49.000
But, you know, hypothetically, do one of these games, you know, and try to go for a huge high score,

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
which, by the way, should also be pointed out in that game room.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
There are certain games they're never going to have,

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
because, like, Nintendo did some of those old arcade games,

44:55.000 --> 44:59.000
and, you know, there's just other publishers that probably are never going to let Microsoft have their stuff.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
But they have a pretty good collection, I think, so far.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
I think there's still a lot to be determined, although we are getting some details.

45:05.000 --> 45:09.000
You know, one of these videos, one of the guys that was hawking the game room says

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
that the noises you hear in the background of the arcade

45:12.000 --> 45:16.000
is dynamically generated based on the games that are in your game room.

45:16.000 --> 45:21.000
So if you have joust, you'll hear joust noises as part of that.

45:21.000 --> 45:27.000
Well, you know, actually, that idea was used in something else that Dan showed me before.

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
And I don't want to, I know it wasn't related to me in particular,

45:30.000 --> 45:34.000
but there's this guy who did a CG arcade.

45:34.000 --> 45:40.000
And actually had gone around and recorded the games in action,

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
as well as the games, like their splash screens and that type of thing, the tracked modes,

45:44.000 --> 45:49.000
and then had them running so that as you moved through the CG version of this arcade,

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
you were hearing things as you passed along, you know.

45:52.000 --> 45:56.000
So I think that's going to be great. I'm really going to like that.

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
Of course, I think that you should also have the option of turning them off.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
You know, because sometimes...

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
You might. We don't know. Usually they're not going to advertise,

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
but you can turn this off. They don't really demo that, you know.

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
But, I mean, but back to it, I think that that's a nice touch.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
Some comments from our chatroom.

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
MacDeaf says, Sky, you can play a game in the game room like a real arcade

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
for 40 Microsoft points for one game.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
I heard it was two games for four, because it's two quarters, but I don't know.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
I mean, we'll see the specifics soon.

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
But, yeah, I mean, there's two different pricing methodologies.

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
If you think, oh, this is a game I'm only going to play once,

46:27.000 --> 46:31.000
you can only spend 40 Microsoft points, play it once, and that's it.

46:31.000 --> 46:37.000
I find that interesting pricing mechanic to be an interesting kind of change about this.

46:37.000 --> 46:42.000
SJ100Matt says, can we put a Microsoft space buck token on machines to play next?

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
I don't think you're going to have the line there.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
It's going to be your own thing.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Here's my honest thought about game room,

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
and I've kind of been processing this all week, because, you know,

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
as a classic gaming enthusiast, I am a little bit excited about game room.

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
Yes, I could do all this stuff on Mania, but I really like the community ideas,

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
and I have friends that are going to be really into this,

47:00.000 --> 47:04.000
and I see myself having competitions for high scores on certain games in game room.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
I see this happening.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
But here's the interesting thing about it.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
We've said this a lot on Orange Andrea.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
One thing Microsoft does very well, because we've watched them kind of grow.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
When we first started this show, I think the Xbox was just coming out.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
It was 2002.

47:17.000 --> 47:23.000
Microsoft has become very good at taking other people's ideas and making them better.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
It's part of their business.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
And the interesting thing about game room, guys, think about it.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
This is not only a rip-off of Nintendo.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Well, I shouldn't say rip-off.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
It's not only inspired by Nintendo.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
It's inspired by Sony.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
Dude, this is Virtual Console and home.

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
This is Microsoft's way of one-upping both of those.

47:42.000 --> 47:45.000
What has everybody been asking for for Virtual Console?

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
I should be able to play it online with my friends in, like, a two-player mode.

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
Guess what? You can do that with game room.

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
I think the games in Virtual Console should have some HD effects

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
and should have leaderboards in them

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
and should have achievements in them.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Guess what? Game room is going to do that for these games.

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
I think home should have a fucking point to it.

48:03.000 --> 48:07.000
That I load up my games seamlessly through the home interface.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
Or that if I earn things in games, I'll be able to show it off.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Guess what? Game room is going to do that.

48:12.000 --> 48:17.000
Game room has kind of taken all these ideas that the community wanted from Virtual Console

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
and the things that community wanted from home

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
and put it into this game room.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
I think it's kind of interesting.

48:23.000 --> 48:27.000
Now, I don't think game room is as close to home

48:27.000 --> 48:31.000
because I still think there's other stuff that Sony Home kind of will do and does

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
that's much different than game room.

48:33.000 --> 48:38.000
But I think game room is what we all thought home would be, in a way.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
Even though, yes, it's very important to point out,

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
you're not going to be able to walk very fluidly through it.

48:44.000 --> 48:48.000
No, so far. That was just being what they were showing off at CES, they said,

48:48.000 --> 48:51.000
because they don't have the collision detection stuff worked out yet.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
This thing is coming up out in the spring.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
I don't see it suddenly...

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
Well, spring for Microsoft is anywhere between, you know...

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
It could be May, yeah.

48:59.000 --> 49:04.000
It's basically, you know, April and May, so who knows?

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Yeah, SSG100Matt says,

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Simpsons in X-Men Arcade!

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
I know you might be kind of messing around,

49:10.000 --> 49:14.000
but dude, imagine it if X-Men Arcade did show up in game room

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
and you could play it online with six people.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
I mean, that's going to be huge if that happens.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
I mean, the Ninja Turtle games are pretty popular, right?

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
The Ninja Turtle arcade game was one of Microsoft's best sellers.

49:25.000 --> 49:28.000
Tons of people were playing that online, probably still are.

49:28.000 --> 49:33.000
Black Wolf says, he's going so far as to say it'll come out during E3.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
Possibly.

49:34.000 --> 49:39.000
Or like, Daytona.

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
The racing controller and stuff, that'd be awesome.

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
Alright, so anyway, I guess more to see on game room,

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
but I'm excited at the possibilities.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Dude, as a classic gaming enthusiast,

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
I don't mind that they're trying to legitimize MAME

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
and give us a reason to pay for it.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
And I would not buy every game, hell no.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
But there are some games I remember quite fondly that,

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
yeah, I might drop five bucks to play them on my PC.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Because when you say play it on my PC, I think,

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
ooh, my laptop and everywhere it goes with me

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
that I have an internet connection, which is when I travel.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
That will be kind of cool to have on the road.

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
And compete in the leaderboards and the medals and all that,

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
and that's something I can't really do in MAME.

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
So it's not that much.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
Five bucks is not that much.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
So, anyhow, we'll see what happens.

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
Moving on to another classic game, getting a redo.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Mega Man 10 is on its way.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
And Mega Man 10, of course, they've been trying to keep

50:30.000 --> 50:33.000
the eight robot master names a secret, but guess what?

50:33.000 --> 50:36.000
The game is playable on the CES floor.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Well, I guess not on the floor, but maybe by appointment.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Either way, the game is showing at CES.

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
And although they are asking journalists not to name the bosses

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
and not to show video of it, I guess there was a German video

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
that showed up that it accidentally snuck in there.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Probably they didn't intend to do it,

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
but you know the bright-eyed fans found it.

50:53.000 --> 50:57.000
And now the names of the boss monsters in Mega Man 10 have shown up.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
So, of course, you already knew about Sheep Man,

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
which I thought was kind of funny,

51:01.000 --> 51:04.000
but you will also be able to fight Blade Man, Solar Man,

51:04.000 --> 51:10.000
Chill Man, Commando Man, Nitro Man, Strike Man, and Pump Man.

51:10.000 --> 51:14.000
And when I hear Pump Man, I'm sorry, I think about the shoes, the pumps.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
No female characters, then?

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
Not yet, but keep in mind that's only eight, right?

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
That's eight. Well, no, I guess there's only eight on the screen,

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
because I'm thinking nine.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
So, no, it doesn't look like there's going to be a woman in this one,

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
although anything can happen.

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
Maybe Dr. Wily is now, you know, to check.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Who knows? Anything is possible.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
No, I guess that's interesting.

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
Yeah, we had Splash Woman last time, which was the first female boss ever,

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
and now no women this time, it sounds like.

51:40.000 --> 51:44.000
But I just like Pump Man. I'm sorry, it makes me think of the shoes.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
It cracks me up.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
I wonder if that's like a Dig Dug Pump Man or what the deal is there.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
And Bobby Black Wolf says,

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
Commando Man, he fights you with no underwear?

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
I don't know if that's quite what they're going for with it,

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
but you never know.

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
And, like, literally four people all at once in chat are like,

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Pump Man? Question mark.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
At least he's not Pump It Up Man.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
And Lord Moon asks, what's he pumping?

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
That's a good question.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
I'm imagining it's like a Dig Dug boss.

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
I really don't know.

52:11.000 --> 52:15.000
Like, uh, we are here to pump you up.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
I don't know.

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
He fires steroid needles at you.

52:19.000 --> 52:23.000
All right, anyhow, Dr. Sakura, what else is going on in gaming?

52:23.000 --> 52:27.000
Well, the Greenpeace report came out.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
You know how much stock I put in a lot of these.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Are those the people that tie themselves to boats and stuff?

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
Yes.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
So fun.

52:33.000 --> 52:38.000
But they have highlighted Nintendo as the most environmentally unfriendly

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
of electronic companies.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
They put out Greenpeace's Guide to Green Electronics,

52:44.000 --> 52:52.000
and it scored 1.4 out of 10 for its chemical and energy and waste policies,

52:52.000 --> 52:56.000
and was the lowest of all the ones that were done out of 18.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
They had a zero on e-waste,

52:58.000 --> 53:02.000
because they didn't reduce greenhouse gas emissions,

53:02.000 --> 53:08.000
even though they promised that there's greenhouse gas emissions from a Wii.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
I never knew my Wii was slowly put away.

53:10.000 --> 53:14.000
Maybe it's manufacturing the Wii is what they're talking about.

53:14.000 --> 53:21.000
It did get some points for having PVC-free internal wiring.

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
It's been monitoring other harmful chemicals,

53:24.000 --> 53:29.000
but it hasn't completely eliminated the use of PVC.

53:29.000 --> 53:36.000
It also got some points for the DSiec adapter and for disclosing CO2 emissions.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
But yeah, it still got bad.

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
Microsoft got 2.4 points, so it was actually just above Nintendo.

53:42.000 --> 53:48.000
And of the major three, Sony was the most green,

53:48.000 --> 53:52.000
and seventh place with a score of 5.1.

53:52.000 --> 53:58.000
Honestly, really the tops of the ones were Nokia,

53:58.000 --> 54:04.000
Sony, Ericsson, Toshiba, and Apple got a big special mention

54:04.000 --> 54:08.000
for completely eliminating chemicals from the computer systems.

54:08.000 --> 54:13.000
Honestly, I really don't care for Greenpeace as a facility all that much,

54:13.000 --> 54:19.000
because of some inaccuracies in their own.

54:19.000 --> 54:23.000
I'm not going to get on the sociopolitical platform right now.

54:23.000 --> 54:28.000
People know there's a lot of stuff that I've said,

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
because they're just not accurate.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
They try to put the spin on it for their own thing,

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
but I'm not going to go into that.

54:34.000 --> 54:39.000
I do, however, think that it's just pretty interesting

54:39.000 --> 54:44.000
seeing where I think the concern is going.

54:44.000 --> 54:48.000
I'm all for being more green and environmentally friendly and all that,

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
solar power, wind power, et cetera, et cetera.

54:50.000 --> 54:54.000
I do think one thing to study to show is that even though,

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
if I remember right, I saw the chart,

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Microsoft is by no means a green-friendly company,

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
but they're higher up on the scale than Nintendo.

55:00.000 --> 55:03.000
If they can make some cutbacks, I think, why can't Nintendo?

55:03.000 --> 55:06.000
That's kind of like my thing is that they're both in the same business.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
If Sony does really good, what changes?

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
I don't know the technical side of things so well,

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
but what are they doing in the manufacturing

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
that Nintendo and Microsoft can't do?

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
What can't they do?

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
I'm not going to go all hippie on you,

55:21.000 --> 55:27.000
but I'm all for looking for ways to be cost-effective yet green.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Well, to be perfectly honest,

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
I think people have gone way too overboard with the whole green thing

55:31.000 --> 55:35.000
because really I think a lot of it is probably going to get me some booze.

55:35.000 --> 55:38.000
I really think a lot of it has to do with more ways to make money

55:38.000 --> 55:44.000
and more marketing, more ways of...

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
I don't want to do the conspiracy thing

55:46.000 --> 55:50.000
and say that it's them trying to control the way we think.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
You know what I mean?

55:51.000 --> 55:55.000
But I think that it is a degree of social conditioning.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
What's interesting, and I don't want to go too far with this

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
because it's not about games,

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
but a lot of people buy their video games there.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
I will say this.

56:01.000 --> 56:04.000
I heard a story on the news this week that Walmart in our area,

56:04.000 --> 56:08.000
Sacramento, at three test stores have eliminated plastic bags altogether.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
And if you either bring your own bag

56:10.000 --> 56:15.000
or they will sell you the blue reusable bags for 15 cents.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
And this is in their efforts to cut back on the plastic waste.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
And I think in theory it sounds like a good idea.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
But I know me.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
I don't usually plan my trips to Walmart that well.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
It's more of a spur of the moment if I ever actually go to Walmart.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
I don't usually shop at Walmart.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
I usually go to Target.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
But if it's happening at Walmart, it might happen at Target.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
So I have to kind of think in those terms.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
I would have a collection of those 15-cent bags

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
piled up to the ceiling in my house

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
because I would never remember to take them

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
and I would end up throwing them away and shit.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
You know what I mean?

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
Look at your feet.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
I know. You've got a couple of them there.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
But those I always empty out.

56:45.000 --> 56:49.000
And I actually keep three or four of them in my car at any given point in time.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
So I actually do use them.

56:51.000 --> 56:56.000
But honestly because I don't like throwing out the trash that often.

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
Really.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
I think Dan do it.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
I call bullshit on the whole Walmart thing.

57:01.000 --> 57:04.000
And the reason why is because they're just looking for a way to make money.

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
Look at it.

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
They buy all these plastic bags

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
that they're going to have to give away for free at their store.

57:10.000 --> 57:11.000
Look at it.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Now we can say that we're being green

57:13.000 --> 57:17.000
and we can sell you bags to carry your crap home in.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
IKEA makes you buy bags.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
The grocery store, they do the reverse.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
If you bring your own bag, they take off five cents.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Also, IKEA is like a pompous store too.

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
You know, fucking all high and mighty.

57:28.000 --> 57:34.000
Smelling their own farts as South Park could put it.

57:34.000 --> 57:38.000
Seriously, I mean, they have a bunch of shit there that's way too damn expensive.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Lord Moon in our chat says,

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
Just remember they're in your car.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
Just remember they're in your car.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
You know, in theory, that's a really good idea,

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
but yet I still see myself failing.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
Here's what I'm going to do instead.

57:46.000 --> 57:47.000
I'm not going to go shop at Walmart.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
At least not that Walmart.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
They're testing it.

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
They're testing it.

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
It's not in place yet.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
They're testing it at three stores here.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
Yeah, I know.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
What I do with a lot of those bags too,

57:58.000 --> 58:01.000
and this is something I've started doing about,

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
let's say, three semesters ago,

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
is when I take different classes,

58:05.000 --> 58:08.000
I actually have my books and my supplies for different classes

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
in the different bags,

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
because I don't always take the same classes every day.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
I mean, I'm going to have overlap this semester,

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
but when they're all in my car,

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
I just grab the bag I need and go,

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
and I don't have to worry about changing out my books or anything.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
I actually reuse the plastic bags.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.000
I'll take my lunches to work,

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
and I don't have a fancy thermos or nothing.

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
I don't need all that fancy shit.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
I put it in a plastic bag and take it to work.

58:29.000 --> 58:33.000
Or even if I'm taking bathroom supplies on a trip with me for travel,

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
I'll put it in a plastic bag.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
It's stuff for the bathroom.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
It doesn't need to be in a fancy plush case.

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
The other thing I use plastic bags for is when I dye my hair,

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
because I tend to splash everywhere.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
A lot of people line the kitty liner with it.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Well, I get cat bag liners

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
because Jeremy has a big box for his stinky ass.

58:49.000 --> 58:54.000
But I actually line my sink with plastic bags

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
so that I don't stain the sink,

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
since this technically isn't really our house.

58:58.000 --> 59:01.000
I wanted to go back and read some of the comments on Mega Man 10

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
because there was some funny stuff in chat,

59:03.000 --> 59:07.000
and I think Bochi Kawa hit the nail on the head earlier in our chatroom,

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
chat.orangehatcherday.com.

59:08.000 --> 59:11.000
I think pump means like water pump,

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
and that's actually not a bad guess

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
because usually there's some type of water boss in the game,

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
and that's probably the one that's good.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
I like Tiger Claw's comment too.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Pump could mean the first robot could be muscle bound.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
At least they didn't call him Plump Man.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
GS68 says,

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
If there ever is a final Mega Man game,

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
the last boss should simply be called The Man.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
LOL, last Mega Man game.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
You're funny.

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
Jay Dizzle commenting on this story says,

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
They have to disclose CO2 emissions,

59:36.000 --> 59:39.000
so I can't fart without telling my supervisor.

59:39.000 --> 59:43.000
Those comments from chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
One other thing, and I do have to bring this up.

59:45.000 --> 59:50.000
We actually do need a certain degree of CO2 in the air

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
for environmental balance,

59:52.000 --> 59:55.000
and I think that people tend to take it a little bit too far.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
I mean, I understand.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Yeah, we need to cut back on stuff.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
There's certain things that are going on environmentally

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
that, yeah, we do have to be more mindful of,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
but I really do think that people are taking it way too far.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
They're reading more into things

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000
and making, certainly, a catastrophe out of something that really isn't.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
You know?

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Alright.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
We've got more gaming news

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
and then our Classic Game of the Week before too long here.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Logie?

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Yeah.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Well, if you have some EA games that are a tad bit old and dusty,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
you may not be able to play those online soon enough

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000
because they are going to be shutting down some of their older game servers.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
And some of the games that they have,

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000
actually, some of the games on the list aren't too old.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000
For example, Facebreaker, which came out about a year ago,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
is being shut down.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Some other ones on the list,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Madden 08 and Madden 09.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
08 is being shut down.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:59.000
These are on February 2nd on the Wii and PC, and 09 on Xbox, the original Xbox,

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Wii and on PSP.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Also, some other older sports games,

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:13.000
March Madness 07, NBA Live 07, 08, 09,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000
at least on the Wii, and that's in Europe only,

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000
NCAA Football, NASCAR.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000
NASCAR 09 I've come surprised on because they actually don't have a new NASCAR game,

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
so that's interesting.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.000
That is only on PS2, PS3, and Xbox 360, though, in Europe only.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Let's see, and then of course they're going to be doing some more April 1st,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:45.000
and that's going to be the rest of Madden NFL 07, Madden NFL 08,

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
which, I mean, come on.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Madden NFL 07, that's from 06, so that's a good four years old,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
almost four years old by the time that they shut it down.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I mean, on the original Xbox.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
I don't know. I'm not too surprised, but maybe some people are.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
But hell, buy Madden 09 or something.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000
I'm sure it's dirt cheap by now.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000
And a few Tyler Woods games also.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
It's always kind of sad when they shut servers down,

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
but at the same time, you know, I get it with the sports games.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Most of those folks upgrade. They're just not cost effective to run.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
You know what I mean?

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Yes. Another game also, not exactly an EA game,

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
that's also having their server shut down.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:37.000
In fact, actually shutting down, I don't know if it's already happened already,

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000
but ChromeHounds, apparently, the server shut down.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Yeah, I can see why. That game really got boring really fast.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000
And apparently, this happened way back.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Oh, apparently this week is when it actually shut down.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Apparently, they announced the shutdown back in August,

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
but they finally shut the servers off this week.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
So, that's too bad.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000
But, eh, we have a farm in core now.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.000
And we're going to be having, soon enough, the new front mission game,

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000
which is going to be all sorts of awesome.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Bobby in chat, because you might remember Bobby was talking about

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
ChromeHounds a lot when that game first came out.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
He said, ChromeHounds shut down last week.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.000
All my friends did one last hurrah last weekend. I wasn't home.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Well, it's always sad when the games that you like, their servers shut down.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Like, I remember when the Amplitude servers shut down.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
I had a cry, but, you know, some of the games were just old.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
I wonder if ChromeHounds was System Link as well,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
because that might not be so bad.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
At least you could do, like, LAN or something like that.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000
They don't really have a lot of System Link games anymore, anyways.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000
But, I wonder if that was one of them that was.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Well, that's probably kind of a pain in the ass to do, too,

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
the whole System Link thing, you know?

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Well, there's people that like doing LAN stuff, and I mean, yeah,

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000
it may be a pain in the ass, but, I don't know.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
That'd be kind of neat, though, if it was System Link.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:11.000
And... it's not. Bummer.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
All right, some more news for you guys,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000
and this has to do with another thing getting shut down,

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000
but not quite an actually authorized video game.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
No, Nintendo has put the smackdown on a fan film

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
that was being made for quite some time, actually.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I guess this film had been taken, like, four years to make,

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
but considering there's a bunch of people that did it in their free time,

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
the Zelda movie was called The Hero of Time,

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
and they actually put it out on the internet.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000
I got some mixed reviews, but, you know, I mean, it was a fan thing.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.000
I wouldn't expect anything that's, like, you know, Hollywood caliber stuff.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
You know, folks were at least kind of appreciative that the movie,

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I guess, had been made, but not Nintendo,

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
because the movie's official site on New Year's Day, actually,

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
so this is a little bit over a week old,

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
but the community site actually had to take the movie down

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
because the studio came to an agreement with Nintendo.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
They actually say, quote,

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
We understand Nintendo's right to protect its characters and trademarks,

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
and understand how in order to keep their property unspoiled

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
by fan interpretations of the franchise,

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Nintendo needs to protect itself, even from fan works with good intentions.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I'm sure our next project will be right around the corner.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
No, it's not Majora's Mask.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000
So, yeah, they won't be making a movie out of that.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000
You know, although you might go,

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Nintendo's the big bad guy coming around kind of shutting off all these fan projects,

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
I get why they had to do it,

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000
because unfortunately not everyone might think that this is an unauthorized movie,

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
because think about how, like, you know, that whole game of telephone works,

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
especially so on the internet.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
One thing gets passed along to another person.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Somebody's going to say, hey, dude, have you seen the Zelda movie?

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Let me hand this to you.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000
This is the fucking Legend of Zelda movie, and then it's not good.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:03.000
And if they don't protect their actual trademarks, then they will no longer have, you know, those trademarks, basically,

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:09.000
because if, you know, they become unprotected, then, you know, anybody can rip that stuff off.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000
The other thing, though, to kind of go with that, though, is it's already on YouTube, of course, in parts.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
The thing is, once they hit the internet, though, that's the other side of it,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
is that once something hits the internet, it's done.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I mean, there's no, like, it's not like you can say,

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
oh, well, now nobody will ever see this.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Nope, once it hits the internet, it's done.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Everybody has it if they want to know where to go look.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000
And, yeah, it's on YouTube.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Tigerclaw just linked us to it in our chat room.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
And you can actually see we're playing, like, just a little clip here.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000
And I watched the first few clips.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
In the studio.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
And it's kind of boring.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Is it?

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Let's just look at it a little bit here.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
I don't know, some chick's crying in the forest.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000
I don't know if that's Zelda.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Maybe that's supposed to be, like, Link when he's born or something.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I mean, it looks like something that would have been on TV in the 1980s.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
I was going to say, it has, like, the same kind of production quality

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
as, like, the Highlander.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
It looks like Beauty and the Beast to me.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Yeah.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Do you remember that old-ass show, Beauty and the Beast,

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
with what's-her-name that went on to be in the Terminator?

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Linda Hamilton.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000
That's it, Linda Hamilton.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Dude, I love that show, by the way.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Anyhow, sorry.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
I guess that was a little prologue there.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Yeah, it's all over YouTube, so take a look if you want.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Anyway, release date's coming up after another story from Dark Sakura.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Dropping stuff everywhere.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
She doesn't drop all her stuff everywhere.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
You all right?

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Can you continue?

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Is this a workman's comp issue?

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
All right.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
There are four letters I'd like to say to you.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Hello?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Oh, wait, no, too many.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000
S-T-F-U.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
And that's with all the love in my heart.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Well, EA actually has hired somebody, so not everyone's losing their job.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
They hired Mark Tramiel.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
You know what Mark Tramiel gave us?

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
NBA Jam.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Boom Shakalaka.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:13.000
So basically, since they're trying to revive NBA Jam for Wii,

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
why not hire the guy who made it?

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.000
I think that's a good idea.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000
So maybe we'll see what happens.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
I'm all for an NBA Jam revival.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000
That was a fun game back in the arcades.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000
I always thought it was the kind of thing that would come to Xbox Live Arcade or PSN,

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
but okay, the Wii.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
I guess I can accept that, depending on what they do with it,

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.000
as long as they don't make it over the top with the motion control and all that stuff.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
I don't know.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I guess we'll see.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000
You can still play as Bill Clinton.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Or, you know, Liu Kang.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Alright, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates of some upcoming video games.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.000
NBA Jam I don't think is one of them yet, but I bet you that's an E3 title.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
That's something we'll see at E3. We'll see.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Yep.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Well, this week we actually have some decent stuff coming out,

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
starting off with Army of Two, the 40th day,

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.000
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and on PSP.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000
The PSP one, though, is supposed to be more like Contra, so that's kind of cool.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Vancouver 2010, the official video game of the Olympic Winter Games.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
That's a long-ass title.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Coming out on Xbox 360 and also on PS3 as well.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Skycrawler's Innocent Aces on the Wii, coming from Exceed.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000
We've got a Sims 2 kind of re-release collection.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:45.000
The Sims 2 Fun with Pets collection, which includes three of the expansions.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
You said Sims 2 Fun with Pets?

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Sims 2 Fun with Pets.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Even though Sims 3 is out now.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
It's just a compilation.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Can you torture the pets in the same way that you torture humans?

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Well, it's got Sims 2 Pets and Sims 2 Family Fun and Sims 2...

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Not that I would ever do that.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000
I want Pets and Sims 3. I'm waiting for it.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
I want to present all sides of the issue.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Yeah, it's the Sims 2 Pets, Sims 2 H&M Family Fun stuff, and Sims 2 Mansion and Garden stuff.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
So you can get that.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
There's actually another Sims 3 expansion coming in March.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
I don't remember what it's called, though, unfortunately.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Daniel X coming out on the DS.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Which I think that's based off a movie or TV show, I can't remember.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Twin Sector on the PC.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Sands of Destruction coming out from Sega.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000
That's on the DS.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Pretty cool role-playing game.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.000
God, why do you let me down Konami?

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Their brand new music rhythm game, which is crap, called Walk It Out.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Yes, it's a game for the Wii about walking.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Awesome, because this is way better than any other good music game that could possibly release.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Let's release another one that's about walking.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:17.000
And finally, a week from today, Glory of Hercules coming out on the Nintendo DS from Nintendo.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.000
The first time that that series has been over here.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Pretty soon, Konami's going to put out a music game called Let's Push the Power Button.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Bobbing your head to the music.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
What is love? Baby, don't hurt me.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Hey, going to Japan and looking at the Japanese release dates.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Batman, Arkham Asylum, yes, it's taken a little while to come to Japan.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
But of course, they're probably having to redub everything in Japanese.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.000
So that is getting its release this week on the Xbox 360 and I believe the PlayStation 3 as well.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Operation Flashpoint, Dragon Rising, also making its way to the Xbox 360 and the PS3.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
The PS3 is getting a price reduction on BioShock.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
It's coming in a little while, but that would be the Japanese localized version there.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
That's coming out there.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000
On the Nintendo Wii, Biohazard, the Dark Side Chronicles.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000
And that, of course, would be Resident Evil over here in the US.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.000
So that would be Resident Evil, Dark Side Chronicles making its way out on the Wii this week in Japan.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Nothing of note really on the PlayStation 2.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
On the DS, there's a game called Last Window.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Myonaka no Yakusoku comes out this week on the DS.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
I'm trying to see what kind of game that is.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000
It's by Nintendo. It's some type of first party game.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000
It looks to be kind of like one of those investigative games.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000
It's a sequel to Hotel Dusk, I think.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Oh! It does look like that.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000
That's what it is.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Last Window, that would make sense.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Okay, so it's like a sequel to that in Japan.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000
I know part of the name is Promise, so I don't understand the rest of it.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
That could have to do with the story, so that makes sense.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Alright, very cool.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Also coming out, it's kind of a slow week in Japan.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
I don't know if they're having the same busy first quarter we are.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
But on the Sony PSP, it's got a few things.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Tekken 6 is getting a release on the PSP in Japan this week.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Spectral vs. Generation gets a price reduction this week.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:10.000
And Kentushi Gladiator Begins is a game that's coming out from the company Acquire.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000
And it looks to be, you know, it's got kind of the gladiator on the front.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:20.000
It does look like it's kind of a gladiator Roman times and all that inspired game,

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000
like a fighting game. Kind of a little bit God of War-ish,

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000
but a little bit closer in the camera and a little bit closer combat,

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
it looks like, from the screenshots we're looking at.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
I don't know if that's something they're planning on bringing over here.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Oh, by the way, if you do like Bleach, Soul Carnival gets a price reduction on the PSP this week as well.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
That does it for Japanese releases. How about the UK?

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
For the UK, I've just got a few.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:47.000
We have Army of Two, the 40th day on Xbox 360 and PS3 and PSP.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
We have Astro Boy for Wii DS and PSP.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Vancouver 2010, the official video game of the Olympic Winter Games.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000
On PS3, PC, and Xbox 360. Sit.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Looking at some of the comments in our chat room, chat.orangeonsrader.com,

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
some people getting in on the walk it out fun.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Bochikawa says, I want to see clap fun on the Wii.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Game Guru says, Konami's press start to win, where you press start and you win.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
No, it should be the standby to win the game.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Wow. Amalthea, I hope I'm saying that right, saying they should have the walking the dog game soon.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000
That would be cool, like all these old 80's dances and stuff.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Everybody walk the dinosaur.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Here's the thing though, actually, speaking of all that dancing, a co-worker of mine,

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.000
I don't know a lot of hardcore gamers at work, although this guy in particular does play a lot of video games.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.000
He told me that just dance on the Wii is actually a lot of fun.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000
And some of the OLR people have said that too.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000
It's a horrible game, but I've been selling a ton of it.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Apparently it's kind of like a Dark Horse type of game that's selling very well.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
It's not a Konami game though, right?

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Apparently just dance is kind of a Dark Horse game right now.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:03.000
They also have this other one coming out called Dance Sensation that's going to be very similar to that in March.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:07.000
But it does have the bird, the zirphine bird.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Bird, bird, bird. The bird is a word.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000
I still want X-Tango.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000
And of course Tiger Claw takes things straight to the toilet saying, how about jack it out?

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Of course he means a jack in the box, right?

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Turn the crank.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Wink, wink, no judge.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
He means turning the crank, but not the kind of...

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Anyhow, how about more gaming news?

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Actually I have a better name for that particular version of it.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Please.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Ceiling Cat is watching you play this game.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
They should really just call it Walk It Off.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
You'll be fap to win.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
They should just call it Walk It Off.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Someone gets brutally injured and they have to walk it off.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Amathia also chimes in and says, why don't they transfer the Taiko drum games to the Wii? It would be perfect.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000
I believe they did. They have a little inflatable drum even, but it's in Japan.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
They didn't bring it over here.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.000
So you might have to write Namco and bug them.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Or you're probably going to have to mod your Wii and import the Japanese version.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.000
But yeah, there's a cute little inflatable drum and everything.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.000
But those games, if I remember right, are pretty heavily Japanese.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Like, you know, they're not translated in English, so yeah.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Good luck navigating it.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Alright, couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:25.000
And it shouldn't be too hard to figure out what Dark Soccer has picked this week, but it's a good one nonetheless.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Alright, well there's some news coming about what maybe announced at E3 perhaps this year.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Satoru Iwata has offered some information regarding the next DS system.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:49.000
And this is the next, not necessarily next revision of the system.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:17:02.000
They're saying that the true next Nintendo handheld system, this is from an interview with a Asahi Shimbun newspaper, I'm assuming in Japan.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:13.000
It says it will have highly detailed graphics and it will be a necessity to have a sensor with the ability to read movements of people playing.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:19.000
In other words, it's going to have a tilt sensor, sort of like the iPhone.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:27.000
And I guess they also, you know, have done some experiments with motion control gaming and stuff on the DS.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Well, neat.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Also, another rumor that's still going around is some sort of 3G-like service for the DS.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:49.000
And something that they're going to have DS Wi-Fi hotspots or something like that, that you're going to be able to connect with people or download content or something like that.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Also, they said there's going to be a new Zelda game sort of revealed, I guess, revealed this year at E3. I guess it was sort of revealed last year.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.000
But, you know, it's actually going to be released by the end of 2010.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Well, remember they had like the screenshots and stuff.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Well, they had some artwork, I think.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:16.000
And then the Wii Vitality sensor, of course, is going to also have some software and stuff unveiled at E3.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:25.000
However, though, if you think about it, they don't really need the tilt sensors and stuff in the DS or the new DS2 or whatever you're going to call it.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:32.000
There's actually been some demos put out by Engine Software. It's a studio that develops different games.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:41.000
They have a demo of a game called Tilt that kind of looks a little bit like Marvel Blast Ultra or like Monkey Ball or something like that.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:47.000
And it does tilt sensors, or I guess motion control, based on the camera.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Because, you remember, the DSi has a camera built into it and can detect movement.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000
So, you can basically do that.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:04.000
You know, it acts like tilting the actual system without needing actual motion sensors inside the system.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
You can do it with the camera.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:12.000
So, I don't think it's a necessity that they need to add motion sensors to the system.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.000
I mean, they can never do this stuff with the DS.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:24.000
And they actually apparently have the, I don't know, would call it drivers, I guess, the libraries for this technology.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:32.000
This company has it available for, I guess, they're working on a DSiWare game that's going to incorporate this new technology.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:38.000
So, that'd be cool to see. But, I don't know, do we really need motion sensors with a portable system?

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
I don't know if that's the case.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000
I can understand it with the iPhone because there's no actual buttons on it.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000
I mean, so how else are you going to control stuff?

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.000
But, I don't know, maybe we'll see the buttons go away.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.000
That'd be kind of crappy, though.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Alright, it's very interesting, though, that there's a new DS kind of definitely in the works, it sounds like, for E3.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.000
That could be their big announcement this year is that, hey, new DS.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Wouldn't that piss everybody off because now they have this DS XL or whatever?

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000
But not in America.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Not in America.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Maybe they don't plan on bringing it here because of that.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
But they just brought out the DSi, what, a year ago?

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
I know, I know.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Hey, you know what, though? Apple puts out a new phone every year.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
I mean, is that different? I don't know.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Yeah, but that's just the specs slightly upgraded. This is going to be a whole new system.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:31.000
I don't know, it's... stop. Just make some good games for it.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Have you really utilized this new technology and all these different upgrades yet?

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:40.000
I mean, have they really done anything with the cameras other than, hey, look, now you can put your face in this.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Oh, wow, awesome.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000
You know, actually, Nintendo hasn't really done anything with the camera other than, you know...

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:52.000
The DSi needs an app like the unicorn thing on the iPhone, where you can take pictures of people and turn them into unicorns.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
It's seriously one of the best iPhone apps ever.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.000
It's U-Y-O-U in a corn. Look it up, it's awesome.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:05.000
I don't know about that, but seriously, what's the point in adding... they had all these, like...

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Oh, yeah, there's two cameras in it now, and you can do all this stuff with the music.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:16.000
You can manipulate music and whatnot, and they've got all these iPhone... or not iPhone, like, different little applications and stuff.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
And then they move on to something else, but they haven't even really done anything with it.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.000
It's like the IR port in the PSP is completely useless.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.000
I'd just be perfectly happy if they had, you know, a built-in Mario Paint mode.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.000
All right, we've got to keep the show moving. I do want to say real quick, though...

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Giovedea in chat had a really good suggestion for the game's name that was inspired by Tiger Claw.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
You know, the whole turning the crank game?

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000
She says they ought to just call it Beat It, and you could already have some soundtrack in it.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Oh, yeah, this game's hot.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000
I just scarred all of our listeners.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:56.000
All right, hey, one other music game that might be for real, for serious. No, really.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Def Leppard, the game.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Apparently, it's coming from a Rooters report, Rooters being one of the big news agencies with Associated Press, of course.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Apparently, the publishing company Primary Wave made a deal with Def Leppard to make a cartoon series and a video game that will be based on the band.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:17.000
The video game project is being called Unusual. Don't know what that means.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:25.000
But that's just all a rumor right now, so it's not some type of Def Leppard rock band or anything like that.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Perhaps Revolution Def?

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Eh? Eh?

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Sequel, maybe? Yes? It's unusual. That would be unusual.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:39.000
I have to say this, and I'm going to take a lot of shit for this, just like when I said it about other bands.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Def Leppard is not a big enough band to get their own game.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
I don't think Green Day is, either, though, and apparently they're getting their own game.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:55.000
But only really certain bands that have really stood the test of time and spanned multiple decades with consistent number one hits deserve their own game.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Journey is just a personal favorite.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Well, they had 80s and 90s, and they still have that Filipino guy now with them.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Like, Elvis might be big enough.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Or U2, I think, was a really good idea. I think U2 could get their own game.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:13.000
If it was an Elvis game, though, you'd have to have sensors on your hips.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000
I kind of want to see the focus away from these band-specific music games.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
It's getting to be a little much.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Van Halen, let's face it, was not that great.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
It's an excuse to release another game.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
That's really what it is, because you can sell extra copies.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Let's keep in mind, back it up a minute, because keep in mind, this Def Leppard thing has nothing to do with Harmonix or Activision.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.000
It's another company, so if there is a music game coming out, it's different.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
That could be anything.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000
I don't know, though. I think it's all talk.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
I don't think it'll happen.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I think if they do the test marketing and sampling, they're going to find there's not enough interest for it.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
And why would Def Leppard say, you know,

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:55.000
oh, let's go with another company for a music game instead of jumping on an established franchise,

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:01.000
where they would get the marketing support and the popularity from the rock band or guitar hero franchises.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
I just don't get why they would just go,

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000
eh, whatever, we don't need all that stuff, we're Def Leppard.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000
I did like their last album.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Yeah, but I don't think it's like sold platinum copies, you know?

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
They're kind of more of a nostalgia band at this point.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Do you see what this is, though?

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Bon Jovi's new album. It was a gift.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000
I don't like Bon Jovi.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Dude, I love Bon Jovi.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Anyhow, this is the part of the show, speaking of blasts from the past,

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.000
where we like to open up the vault and take a trip down memory lane

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:33.000
and, you know, respect the classics with a little segment we do here on OLR

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
called the Classic Game of the Week.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Dark Soccer is going to jump into the vault and find a game that she says,

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.000
you know what, you kids today that don't listen to your Def Leppard

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.000
and Bon Jovi like you should, you need to go back

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
and look at this classic game from the past.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Dark Soccer, what is the Classic Game of the Week this week?

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
The classic game is NBA Jam.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Of course.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.000
And because there is no actual music really played much in the game

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:00.000
while you're playing, I just found arcade samples, so...

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Boom, Shakalaka!

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Yeah.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
He's on fire!

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Anyway, NBA Jam came out in 1993 for the arcade,

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:19.000
and it spawned a series, and actually it was written in assembly,

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
and of course, as I said in an earlier story,

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:27.000
it was designed and programmed by Mark Turmel.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:34.000
It used a lot of the big names from the 92, 93 NBA system,

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.000
and then, of course, for the console releases, it used the 93, 94,

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:47.000
and there have been later versions that came out on Sega CD, Game Boy, and Game Gear.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.000
So, but of course there were certain licensing things,

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000
like they couldn't get Michael Jordan for the Bulls at the time,

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.000
so they did get Scottie Pippen at the time.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.000
They also got certain ones were missing from the home versions,

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:06.000
like Gary Payton and Shaquille O'Neal.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:11.000
There's also, of course, as we mentioned, a possibility of it being out on Wii.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.000
So, some of the pretty cool stuff, though, is this game,

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000
and this was what I think is really the notable part of it,

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:24.000
is that the games had their digitized likenesses of the players included in the game,

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000
so that you could see their faces while they played.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.000
And then if you got three baskets in a row, you were on fire,

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:38.000
and so you could be unlimited turbo, no goaltending,

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:46.000
you could shoot better until the other team scored.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Also, you didn't have fouls, free throws, that type of thing.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.000
And you've got your spectacular dunk shots,

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000
so it was really more of a fantasy basketball type game.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:06.000
As far as Easter eggs that were in the game, you could...

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Like, the Genesis actually had one, and I remember this one,

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:16.000
super clean floors, where if you run too fast, you could slide and fall.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.000
And then there were the hidden characters, like you could play as Bill Clinton.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.000
You could play the Charlotte Hornets mascot.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:30.000
And then there were early versions of NBA Jam Tournament Edition

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000
that you let you play as Mortal Kombat characters.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:41.000
And I actually remembered playing beta versions of the game.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.000
By the way, you should play the Tournament Edition one that I linked up.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Oh, I just keep hopping from music to music.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
That one's fine.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.000
I like the Tournament Edition halftime music that I linked up in.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.000
I'll get it.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Okay, but anyway, they actually were taken out because of the violence

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
that the Mortal Kombat characters represented.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:08.000
However, like I said, I played beta versions of it that everyone was in.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000
There were a lot of...

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:18.000
For NBA Jam and Mortal Kombat 2, there were a lot of beta versions

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
of the games on the East Coast.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
So I got to check those out at the time.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000
It was that year I went to New York.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.000
So I got to see them a lot on the way up the East Coast.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
It was pretty cool.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:34.000
So yeah, just to go over some of the people in the arcade version,

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:40.000
you had Shaquille O'Neal, you had Isaiah Thomas, you had Reggie Miller,

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Harvey Grant.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.000
For the SNES Genesis one, like some of the other people in there

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:53.000
like Alonzo Warnings, Scottie Pippen, Patrick Ewing, Sega CD.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Bless you, by the way.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:02.000
You had a lot of the same people, just newer updates to them.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
And then, of course, you had the Game Gear ones.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Really a lot of the same people, though there were a few that,

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.000
for licensing issues, were out.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:20.000
You also had Charles Barkley, you had all the big people.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
I don't know if anyone kept up with basketball back then.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
I actually did.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
So it was pretty cool.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.000
There were sequels.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000
There was an NBA Jam Tournament Edition.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.000
There were all kinds of different ports.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:41.000
There was actually an Atari Jaguar version of it.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.000
There was NBA Jam Extreme in 1996, which was a 3D version

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:51.000
that had Marv Albert doing the commentary.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:56.000
There was...

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:01.000
It actually was revised as NBA Hang Time.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Do you remember that one?

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000
I do.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Wasn't the same.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000
There was a college version that's called College Slam.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:16.000
And then there were, of course, all the other sports games that Midway did.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.000
They did a two-on-two open ice challenge.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:25.000
But then it came out as Wayne Gretzky 3D hockey and NFL Blitz.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Blitz, I think, was another one in the thing.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
And then I think more of a spiritual successor, though, to NBA Jam

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:37.000
was the NBA Showtime series that came out, the NBA on NBC.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Hoops was supposed to be on there.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:46.000
But anyway, that's really it.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.000
All right.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.000
By the way, I got linked to something awesome from XLink in our chat room.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
He linked me to this thing that's great.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000
For instance, watch this.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Hey, Jamie, what did you have for breakfast today?

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
I didn't.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Boom shakalaka!

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000
That's cool.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Is there the, uh, it's in the shoes?

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Or is it the shoes?

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Oh my! He's on fire!

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
No.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Propel town!

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Actually, one of my favorite ones was, um, Couldn't Buy a Bucket.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Heating out!

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Ugly shot!

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Yeah.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Fantastic!

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
All right, I'll cut it out, but I just-

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.000
It's funny, though, that you'd get a kick out of Marv Albert being in one of these.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Eh, it's kind of funny, but I just-

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:36.000
You know, I'm not a big, big fan of, um, sports games, usually.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
You know, I just- I don't watch a lot, you know, whatever.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
But I loved NBA Jam.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.000
I played the crap out of that game.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Oh, yeah.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
And if I do watch any sports, it's probably basketball.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
It's the one I like more than anything.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:51.000
All right, well, anyhow, we got plenty more of gaming news coming up later in the show here.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
We're gonna take a quick break, though, for our live folks.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
And for you podcast folks, just sit on tight.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
We'll be right back after a little interlude.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
But when we come back after the break, we got a lot, a lot of rapid-fire news tonight.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Some quick stuff.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Your Twitter topics.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Uh, we're gonna talk a little bit about some Blizzard rumors.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.000
A game that apparently is no longer being published or shipped.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Um, a Wii Wand with MotionPlus built in.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:14.000
And plenty more when we come back from a quick break.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Excuse me.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
We're live. I have the hiccups. I can't handle it.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
All right, so I'm glad we're taking a break right now.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.000
And we'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:35.000
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio here on this Sunday night, January the 10th of 2010.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Uh, we are here, of course, every Sunday night at All Games Radio.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:42.000
www.allgames.com, taping Orange Lounge Radio.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Tonight is episode number 352.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.000
If you are just joining us, just a quick live programming note.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:52.000
We will not be live for the next two weeks due to various personal conflicts.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000
However, we will be pre-taping a show at least in two weeks.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000
But we are taking the Martin Luther King holiday off completely.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
I just want to make sure you guys know.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:03.000
But stay tuned to our podcast feed and all that fun stuff.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Anyhow, we got plenty more news to cover tonight, though.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
And then, of course, phone calls and so forth.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
So let's get into some rapid-fire news tonight.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Loki.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Yes, Dragon Age Origins is getting a brand new expansion in March.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000
The new expansion is called Awakening.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
And it'll be coming out March 16th.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:29.000
It's going to be the first retail expansion for Dragon Age Origins.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Apparently going to be available for $40.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
And I'm not sure if that's actually coming out.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
I think that's also on $360 as well.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:40.000
I mean, that's kind of expensive. $40?

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Well, if it's a lot of content, it could be nice.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:47.000
That better be a damn... I mean, a lot of content.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.000
I mean, look at all the expansions that they had for, you know...

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Oblivion.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
For, you know, Fallout 3.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.000
I mean, those were, you know, about $10 each or $20 each.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000
I don't know. We'll see.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000
It'll be interesting.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Anyways, so March 16th, if you're looking forward to that.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Left 4 Dead is kind of getting a demake.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:19.000
They have an 8-bit version of Left 4 Dead that's been made by a guy named Eric Ruth.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.000
And the game looks like it should be on the NES.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
It supports up to two players.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000
And it's basically a PC version that is available to download right now.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
So you can go find that.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:37.000
I believe they have it available on... he has his own website on Google.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:44.000
sites.google.com slash site slash eric david ruth

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Is it a hack of a game?

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.000
No.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Slash game dash left 4 dead.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000
And that's just like how you would spell the actual title.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.000
And that's available. Otherwise you could do a search in Google and probably find it.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000
But it's pretty cool looking.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:03.000
I thought it was an NES ROM hack at first, but no. It's a PC game.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Oh, I get it. Okay.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Gotta put it on my cabinet though.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Why not?

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000
It's two player.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Also, Rock Band on Playstation 3 is being patched.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Or Rock Band 2 I should say.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Being patched on the PS3 to make way for the Rock Band Network.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
And that's kind of cool.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000
They're gonna actually have the Rock Band Network store in the interface.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:31.000
I guess selling songs directly added by Rock Band fans.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.000
And musicians and record labels through the new Rock Band Network.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Although I'm surprised. Is this even available right now for the Xbox?

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:43.000
I don't believe so. I believe they're able to start making their songs.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:48.000
But I don't think they're actually... I think still in like a beta type stage.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Or a closed beta basically.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.000
That's too bad. I wanna play some new ones.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:36:04.000
And apparently there's the updates also adding a more robust handling of chord hammer-ons and pull-offs found in the Beatles Rock Band.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Support for SingStar wireless microphones.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:14.000
And support for velocity sensitivity with the Ion Drum Rocker drums I guess.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:19.000
And the ability to sort songs in quick play by the number of stars you've earned in each song.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:22.000
So that should be coming very soon.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:30.000
And then also Half-Life 2 on PC has a mod added to it now to update the graphics.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:37.000
This is gonna be kind of on par with what we saw in Half-Life Episode 2.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Kind of like what we saw in the orange box that they released.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.000
And the mod adds a bunch of new detail into the game.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.000
More realistic graphics, new models, whatnot.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.000
About damn time.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Yeah, it looks pretty sweet.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Apparently right now I believe it's just he's working on Episode 1 as well right now.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:02.000
So that should be coming soon.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:07.000
But it basically adds HDR, high dynamic range, lighting.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Also new updated models, textures, and 32 Steam achievements as well.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.000
And so that's available I believe right now.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:23.000
So you can probably find that on your favorite mod site or yeah it's on the Steam powered forums.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
So there's a link on there somewhere.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Half-Life 2 is a pretty epic game.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.000
I think that it should fit the play.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.000
I'm almost surprised that they haven't released an update themselves.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Because it does look really good with the new graphics.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:40.000
I'm surprised that Valve hasn't done it themselves.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
But hey, someone else did.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
And that's it.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Alright, well Loki brought up music games and certainly Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero still in the picture with some weekly download packs believe it or not.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000
They're still going strong there with the weekly download packs.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:58.000
January 7th, some Blues Masters types of songs.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Tyler Bryant, Joe Bonamassa, and Scott McKeon have some new songs coming out.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.000
January 14th is the Vampire Weekend, so if you're a fan of them.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Holiday, Cousins, and The Kids Don't Stand a Chance will all hit Band Hero and Guitar Hero 5 on the 14th.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.000
January 21st is a metal track pack.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
You get Shadows Fall with Still I Rise.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Amon Amoroth with Twilight of the Thunder God.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.000
And get this, Deathlok with Laser Cannon Death Sentence.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
So if you're a fan of Metalocalypse, you'll like that.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Dude, I fully threw up the horns for that.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000
And then on the 28th, Creedence Clearwater Revival.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Yeah, Proud Mary and Bad Moon Rising and Traveling Band.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Sweet!

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
No, I totally am going to get those.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000
That's a very diverse lineup. We'll put it that way.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Rock Band, not to be ignored, is doing their weekly announcement as well.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.000
And this will be available this week on the 12th of the 14th, depending on what system you're on.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.000
It's Alice in Chains.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Some new songs by them.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Grind, Heaven Beside You, Last of My Kind, We Die Young, and Your Decision.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
So if you're an Alice in Chains fan, you're happy this week.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:03.000
And Microsoft has announced that Project Natal is coming this holiday season, 2010.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:06.000
That was straight from the CES 2010 keynote.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.000
I don't think that really surprises anyone though, but they are committing to that time frame.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
It will be out, holiday 2010.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.000
No official name though. It is still being called Project Natal.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000
That may end up being its name.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Maybe just Natal, I don't know.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:21.000
But they are still calling it that, at least in their press conferences.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Hopefully they don't call it something stupid like Wii.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
We'll see.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:33.000
And lastly, from me, Dr. Pepper, yes the soft drink, is going to be giving away some free EA download content with their purchases.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:39.000
So apparently, if you actually purchase Dr. Pepper, every bottle apparently wins something.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:45.000
You can actually get whatever system and download content you want for stuff from Mass Effect 2,

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Battlefield Heroes, The Sims 3, Spore, and Battlefield Bad Company 2.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Apparently they're all going to have unique download content.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.000
So I notice they're mostly newer games, with the exception of Spore, which has been out a little while.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
But I'm sure they wouldn't mind selling a few extra copies of that.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000
So, there you go. Dr. Sakura.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Well, Squeenix actually put out from the North American group that they are putting Mir out in the spring.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Not sure if Europe is included as well, but it's by the guy who did, well, by the group that did Cavia.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:28.000
The group Cavia, sorry, I'm so tongue-tied, that did Bullet Witch and Resident Evil and Umbrella Chronicles.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:35.000
There is, though, a PS3 exclusive version that's only going to be out in Japan called Nier Replicant.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:41.000
And I'm actually really looking forward to this game, so I can't wait till we get it.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Well, I'm going to have to wait, but I'll look forward to it.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:52.000
And then also, Squeenix is bringing out Death by Cube on Xbox Live Arcade on the 20th of this month.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:58.000
It's another twin-stick, multi-directional shooter type of game.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Excuse me.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:06.000
And it's actually going to be based off of a bit of Robotron and Smash TV, so that'll be pretty good.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Those are fun games. More money, more prizes, I love it.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Not to be confused with Death by Companion Cube.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:16.000
No. Or Cube, as in the movie. Anyway.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Heavy Rain also has an official release date, but it's not the 16th.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
It is the 23rd.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:30.000
It was actually confirmed also by Sony.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:39.000
So, if you pre-order the game, you get free launch date access to the first downloadable Heavy Rain Chronicles episode,

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:43.000
and otherwise it will be coming out later and you can pay five bucks for it then.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:52.000
The European release date for that is February 14th for Mainland and February 26th for UK and Ireland.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:57.000
And then, we have Xbox Live stuff.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Well, more Xbox Live stuff.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:10.000
They're actually saying that the Japanese developed games are more popular than most of the US ones, except for Castle Crashers,

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:19.000
but the ones that have been getting the most sales have been Virtualon and Ikaruga and Triggerheart Excellica.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:26.000
So, actually, if you want to look at the top ten Xbox Live arcade games, just for 2009 in order,

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:33.000
there's Virtualon, Oratorio Tengram, Battlefield 1943, Castle Crashers, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Trials HD,

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:38.000
R-Type Dimension, Shadow Complex, Ikaruga, King of Fighters 98, and Mega Man 9.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:46.000
But, overall time, number one is Castle Crashers, Virtualon, Oratorio Tengram, Ikaruga, Bomberman Live, Battlefield 1943,

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Triggerheart Excellica, Uno, Dracula X, Fatal Fury Special, and Res HD.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:55.000
And I believe that's from Japan, though. Not here in the US.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Because I think here the list would read something like, you know, Uno. Probably.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Anyhow. Alright, if that does it for the rapid fire news tonight, then let's get to some Twitter topics.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:12.000
I did want to say real quick, just to make a comment about the Xbox Live stats in Japan,

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:20.000
I am very proud of a game that I actually played quite often, and unfortunately didn't get as much love as I would have liked it over here.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:26.000
On Games On Demand, the top game downloaded in 2009 from Japan,

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Earth Defense Force 3, better known as Earth Defense Force 2017 over here.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:34.000
The greatest game featuring giant ants.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Not as good as Bayonetta, though, I'm telling you. I'm telling you.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:42.000
So good, in fact, I actually have four copies of this game.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Wow.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:47.000
I have saved three, I was eventually going to give them out on the show at some point.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Nice.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
I haven't done it yet, but they're collecting dust, so.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Soon.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Let's get to Twitter topics tonight. We ask you guys every week to send your tweets to OLR on Twitter,

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.000
about things you think we maybe missed, or topics you want us to discuss.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:04.000
We have a few tweets tonight, a lot of story referrals tonight.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:08.000
ActDef says, I got a couple Twitter topics for you, one of them is coming up later in the show,

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.000
but the other one has to do with Gran Turismo 5 details.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Apparently some more details came out about the game,

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.000
and it's in the February edition of the PlayStation Official Magazine.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Over 1,000 vehicles, modeled cockpits, physical and mechanical damage modeling,

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.000
indie cars and tracks included, NASCAR cars and tracks included,

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:30.000
up to 16 players online, high definition video uploads directly to YouTube.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
That's interesting.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Multi-display rendering, head tracking, full weather and night racing on all tracks,

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.000
night and day cycle on all tracks, that's going to be a pretty intense game.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Gran Turismo 5, I'm sure that's going to be a huge thing they're going to show at E3 this year.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Moving on.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
I doubt it, it's coming out in February.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Is it that soon?

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
No, not February, like April.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Oh wow, I didn't realize it was that soon.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Dang.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Alright, cool.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Is that just in Japan, or is that over here too?

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.000
That's over here.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Wow.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
Ionotropic sent us a tweet.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Final Fantasy XIII apparently is the biggest swindle ever,

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:07.000
and links us to this topic of a thing that we ran on Destructoid.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.000
It was a really negative review that came from a Hong Kong magazine.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.000
I guess, and I'm trying to see what the name of the magazine is here,

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.000
I don't see it, but it was some magazine in Hong Kong.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.000
They called Final Fantasy XIII the biggest joke of 2009,

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:24.000
saying the game is completely linary until the open area is near the end.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
You can't even backtrack.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Of all the RPGs I've played in recent years,

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.000
this is the first which have been so linear that it is little more

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.000
than riding an amusement park ride.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Ouch.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
They gave the game a 4 out of 10.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.000
They gave the scenario a 2, saying it's a tearjerker.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.000
The system a 1, saying it's such a crude system.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
They gave the graphics a 9 and the sound a 7,

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000
but then the enthusiasm was a 1.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.000
So, I don't know if they...

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Sounds like they just rate it low to get attention.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.000
I don't know, well it worked.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
So, there you go.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:00.000
That was from a Hong Kong magazine that I don't see the name of here.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Maybe somebody has it in chat.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:06.000
More links from our Twitter peoples.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:09.000
SSJ100Matt sent us a tweet that talks about a new hack glitch

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
on Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Apparently some players have now turned into Super Speed.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:19.000
So, I guess now if you get a certain hack from Modern Warfare 2,

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:22.000
you can run around just as fast as possible.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:27.000
And if you cheat online with this, you are an asshole.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Let's see.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Tigerclaw305 links us to this story about Rockstar San Diego.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:35.000
The wives, apparently, of many of the employees are demanding

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.000
better work conditions for spouses.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.000
This is kind of interesting.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Apparently it's an open letter that was posted on a Gamasutra blog.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Ouch.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Rockstar San Diego meets the Midnight Club series of games

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:50.000
and they're working on the Red Dead Revolver sequel right now.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Apparently some of the blog things are addressed in the blog.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.000
12 plus hour workdays, six day work weeks,

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.000
cuts to medical benefits, a decline in bonuses,

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.000
and all that other stuff.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
So apparently, unfortunately, the workers are not getting compensated

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
the way they should be.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
And fortunately, in this economy, it's not that easy to quit.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:10.000
But at the same time, that doesn't mean you abuse the workers.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
I think if they really do have an issue, though,

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000
they should take it up with the state board.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:16.000
If they're working 12 hours, they're getting time and a half

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.000
and then double time plus.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:22.000
So I wouldn't be too alarmed about that.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:25.000
And you do have the option.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.000
I mean, this is California.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
We're in the freaking worker's paradise here.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:32.000
But when it's mandatory hours, and unfortunately this economy,

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
it's not just easy to say, quick, go find something else.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.000
There isn't a lot out there right now.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:39.000
But it technically is not legal to force a mandatory overtime.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Oh, they do it. Companies do it.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.000
They do it.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:44.000
But if you protest it, they don't have to schedule you for it.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Because trust me, I have been scheduled for mandatory overtime

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
and I'm like, sorry, I have something else that I'm doing

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
and gotten out of it.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
So it's law.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.000
They cannot make you do mandatory overtime.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.000
I don't know.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Blackwell seems to think that California's one of the states

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:02.000
that didn't give overtime to those doing computer programming.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
I don't know if there were exceptions.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.000
I mean, I don't work in that field, so I wouldn't know as closely.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:08.000
But I don't think there's really exceptions to that.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:11.000
The only way they can get out of that is if you're salaried.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Yeah.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:15.000
And even so, I know at my work, they actually,

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:19.000
they are really, really anal on addressing your hours

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:22.000
because they do crack down really hard

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.000
if you've made someone work more than eight hours in a day.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Spazinator, PSN on Twitter, sends a tweet.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:33.000
How about the reports of Natal possibly being gimped as a cost-cutting measure?

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.000
I don't know if you can gimp something you don't really know about.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:39.000
I mean, this system has not really been put out there for the masses to consume.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
I mean, they didn't put it on the show floor at E3.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
It was only behind closed doors

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
and believed only in a demonstration capacity.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.000
So they might gimp it, but you'll never know.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.000
The only reason they're saying it's gimped is because they took,

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:54.000
there was a processor built into the camera before,

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:58.000
but to reduce costs, they're now using the actual Xbox 360 processor

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:02.000
because that's going to take 10 to 15% of the system resources

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.000
to process the Natal capture stuff.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.000
I see.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
So they're saying that the games are going to have some of their processing.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
They're going to suffer because of that.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.000
You know what, though?

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Again, it's...

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Yeah, but would you rather, okay, would you rather that the games,

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:19.000
maybe they'll have to cut corners a little bit in the games

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:26.000
and say Natal's like, I don't know, $79, $59 or whatever,

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:31.000
versus they don't cut corners in the game, project Natal is $200.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Plus that forces developers to make their games for Natal.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Like, they can't just throw on Natal controls onto existing games.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.000
I kind of like that aspect about it, actually.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:44.000
It forces programmers to make games for Natal.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.000
You know what I mean?

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Yeah, we'll see.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.000
It's pulling the Nintendo on them if it's forcing them to do it

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:54.000
because, well, for the longest time, Nintendo had their own proprietary...

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:57.000
True, true. That was a big thing back in the day with the cartridges.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Bobby Black Wolf sends us a tweet wanting us to talk about Duke Nukem Forever.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.000
You jerk.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
And you know why I said that.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
And if you don't know why I said that, you can listen to Bobby's show,

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
the Bobby Black Wolf show, and our little phone call at the end.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:14.000
And why I do not believe Duke Nukem Forever is worthy of news coverage at all.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Yet. Right now.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
At this time, no.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Until they put something actually playable out there on the E3 show floor,

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:24.000
and no more... I'm sick and tired of these video teases and things

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
that just end up changing in a couple years anyway.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Like, put your goddamn money where your mouth is.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
I'm sick of talking about it.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
And look, I just spent a minute now talking about it,

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
so please, let's move on with more stories.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Alright.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Well, there's some other fun stuff, including,

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Sony is apparently increasing the storage capacity of Blu-ray Discs.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:50.000
You know, the previous discs, of course, used by the PS3 were 25 gigabytes.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Now they're being expanded to 33.4 gigabytes,

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:59.000
meaning that, well, you can store a lot more stuff on there.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:06.000
And also seeing that soon dual-layer Blu-ray Discs will become common,

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.000
and you'll be able to fit 66.8 gigabytes worth of data.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.000
All that means is you're never going to see multi-disc games for the PS3.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:17.000
It's just going to be, you know, all on the 360.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
And longer cutscenes.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Longer cutscenes, more high-definition graphics, more language options.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:28.000
It still doesn't fix the fact that the Blu-ray drive is kind of slow.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
That's a little bit of a problem.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:33.000
But hey, uncompressed, you know, textures,

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000
you know, all sorts of fun stuff to save on processing power.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Could that mean larger installs down the line because the disc will hold more?

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
I'm going to have to install more to my drive?

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Maybe.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:46.000
That's neat, though, that they can kind of do that

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
and not have to release a new PlayStation 3.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
I mean, I do kind of think that's a nice little feature,

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
is that they can kind of patch that in.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
That will come in handy.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Especially when, you know, Final Fantasy 15 or whatever is on its way out

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
and they want to do Uber cutscenes with it.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Huge, huge rumor right now, speaking of, like, Uber games.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Apparently, it's a rumor that Blizzard is currently working on a first-person MMO.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:09.000
It's coming from a French gaming site, No Frag,

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.000
saying they have a reliable source.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Everybody does.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:18.000
That Blizzard's next game, you know, after Diablo and after StarCraft,

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
will be a first-person MMO.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.000
You know, Blizzard apparently has been working on a new IP.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
We kind of know that based off the fact that they've had some job postings

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:29.000
and so forth in the past, and that it's an MMO based on, again, the job postings.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:33.000
So, you know, maybe there is some credibility to this.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
It could be interesting if it is a first person.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:38.000
They are saying the game will take place in a futuristic world

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
and players have two lives.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:44.000
The first is kind of a Sims Online type of hub,

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:47.000
and then the second life is where you do fighting

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
and other first-person-y type stuff.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Apparently, it's weird and metaphysical.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
So that could be interesting, a new IP.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
I'm glad they're trying to branch out and do something new.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.000
It's kind of risky.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:00.000
But, you know, I was just talking about this with some people last night,

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:03.000
is that, you know, World of Warcraft is dominating as it is.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:07.000
You know, Blizzard has to be thinking about their next steps in the MMO universe,

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:11.000
because if they want a game to come out when WoW gets old,

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
they need to be working on it already.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:17.000
You know, because WoW is going to age out in maybe five years,

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
maybe less, I don't know,

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
and they need to be thinking about the successor to that.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
But, of course, this doesn't sound like World of Warcraft 2.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
This sounds like something else completely new.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Could be interesting.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
Could be targeting a different audience altogether.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
I don't know.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:33.000
I can tell you the top-secret game I played this week

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
was also two very different types of modes in it.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
So maybe that's the direction of MMOs.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
I don't know. Maybe?

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Well, in other news, this is actually kind of sad.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:47.000
There is a game that is no longer going to be shipped,

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
no longer going to be published.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Nintendo has put the clothes on it, even though it's only been out for four months.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:59.000
The Metroid Prime Collector's Edition is gone.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:02.000
The only way you're going to get it is used.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
It's been gone for a while, actually.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
But it's officially gone.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Yeah, somebody finally contacted Nintendo this week.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
What do you know, Loki?

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Well, it's been moratorium for a while.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:15.000
I just figured they'd stop making it.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
They do that sometimes with some of their older games.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
But it's been looking out for four months.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Yeah, that's weird.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Yeah, but it's just a re-release of Prime 3 and the other two games.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:29.000
I get that, but at the same time, what they did to Prime 1 and 2 was new.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
The whole widescreen of Wii controls.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Well, now they can re-release them separately, maybe.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
I don't know.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Give them an excuse.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Hey, look, we're putting out new games.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Maybe Nintendo is finally being punished for just rehashing their GameCube shit

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
and releasing it with this new play control.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Well, they've stopped doing the new play control stuff.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
At least I haven't seen any coming out.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Do you know how some of those other ones sold?

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Prime 3 did okay, I think.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Well, the trilogy did alright for a little bit.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
The other ones, I mean, it depends.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Some people picked up Pikmin and that kind of stuff.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:08.000
They sold a little bit for a while, but it dropped off really quick.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:12.000
It wasn't like people were buying Pikmin like it was the new Pikmin game or something like that.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Maybe it ended up being cost-effective. Who knows?

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Let's see, Tigerclaw in our chat says maybe they'll do a greatest hits thing for those games.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
She could buy the Wii version separate.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:25.000
Even if they release those at 20 bucks apiece, the collector's edition was a better deal.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:28.000
To get all three of them for what, like 40 or whatever it was?

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Pretty much.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
The only reason I didn't get it is because I already owned three

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:34.000
and I wasn't that attached to the Metroid series where I wanted to buy 1 and 2.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Because I just...

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.000
It's not high def.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Don't you have the GameCube versions anyways?

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:43.000
No, those were my roommate's games at the time.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Those were Extra First games, not mine.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
He was the big fan of Metroid.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
I do have the third one though. I did like Metroid Prime 3.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
I just, you know, I wasn't as into it.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:54.000
I think this other M is going to be more up my alley.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
I like the 2D thing.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:00.000
See, I was thinking that, it's like you were saying, not being cost-effective.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:03.000
A lot of people maybe already had these games, were disillusioned.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:11.000
If profit doesn't match output for cost, then it makes perfect sense for them to get rid of it.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:14.000
I hate to say it, Nintendo should be slapped on the wrist for that.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:18.000
I mean, I think they were trying to milk the cash cow there without changing the games enough.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:22.000
I mean, what they did with Metroid and the white series, it was a little better.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:23.000
And I think they did that for some of the other games.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:24.000
It just wasn't enough.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Where's the online play?

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
You did it in the DS one.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
This is not enough.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Anyhow, more news.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Some other fun stuff.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Let's see.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Let's see here. Sorry about that.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Another thing that came out of CES.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:50.000
The Xbox 360 media room.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:53.000
It's kind of like an IPTV thing that they've got.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:59.000
And I believe they talked a little bit about that, or at least it was rumored at last CES.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
That they were possibly going to go that way.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:09.000
But this is going to be something that's going to be offered with, or I should say, for AT&T U-verse subscribers.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:15.000
And they'll allow you to have access to some of these new channels that are going to be available through that.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:20.000
And I guess right now, I don't know, I think U-verse is in my area.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:23.000
But I haven't really jumped on that yet.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:26.000
I don't know if they have the U-verse internet in my area.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
I think that's what it is.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:32.000
Anyways, and they're going to have that coming out later this year.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:36.000
And apparently any of the subscribers to U-verse will have access to this.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.000
I think you also probably have to have their internet as well.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
But it's kind of neat.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:47.000
They didn't really say a whole lot about it, but there's going to be a lot of limitations on there.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:52.000
You're not going to be able to record any of the programming on there with a DVR.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:57.000
You're not going to be able to get access to all the different stations and stuff.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:03.000
I mean, if it doesn't cost anything additional, then that wouldn't be too horrible, I guess.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:06.000
I don't know.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.000
I like that at least there's starting to be more choices.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Because I felt like for TV for the longest time, if you want a cable-type thing, you really only have Comcast.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Now there's this AT&T thing that's... I'm all for competition, you know?

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Yeah, I need the FiOS stuff to get here.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Because that's going to be awesome.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Twice the speed that Comcast downloads.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Alright, speaking of an all-in-one, everything built in on the Wii,

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Nyko, of course, releases some third-party controllers for the Wii.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:40.000
I usually see them at E3. They do the big inflatable Wii controls and stuff.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Well, the Luan that they released last time was pretty sweet with the ability to link up with their gun controller or whatever like that.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:51.000
It'd be directly attached to it and stuff.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:55.000
It's a little device that pushes the button on the controller.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Well, this year, what they're putting out is a $40 wand.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
The wand is the name of their controller.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:06.000
It is a Wiimote, basically, that includes MotionPlus inside it.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:11.000
And it also does all the transport stuff that Loki's talking about, what the wand did before.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:17.000
But apparently now you will get to have the WiimotionPlus built in, so you don't have to buy an extra adapter for it.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:22.000
That's pretty awesome, and for the same price as a normal remote, why wouldn't you buy that?

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
The controller doesn't look that bad.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
No, it's not a bad looking thing at all.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.000
It looks like the same layout and everything.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:33.000
I mean, unless you have to have the Nintendo made one. I don't know why.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
I'm surprised Nintendo...

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:36.000
Might not be a bad deal.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
I wonder if they're taking this well.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Well, maybe you just want Wii Play really bad. I don't know.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Alright, one segment I want to get to really bad is the part where our listeners email us.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:50.000
It's the mailbag segment that we do every week here on the show.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
So Dark Sakura's going to dive in headfirst to our mailbag.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Again, the address to send us emails.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:58.000
mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Again, that's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Don't be shy. Email us.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Mailbag's been kind of dry the past few weeks. I don't know.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:06.000
We'll see if there's anything there tonight. Dark Sakura?

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
The first one comes from Redertainment.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:15.000
Dear OLR, I was listening to the 12609 show we talked about the Xbox Live avatar pets and thought you might like to be made aware of something.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Last summer, Major Nelson sent out a tweet compelling people to get the word out that Final Fantasy 13 is on Xbox 360.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:26.000
I was among the people who participated in this free marketing campaign.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Recently, Microsoft sent out tokens to people who participated in the campaign, including me.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:34.000
This token got me a free avatar pet, a chocobo.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:39.000
A tiny yellow chocobo, which is indistinguishable from a newborn chick.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:43.000
All this chocobo does is show up, fly around my head, and delight my avatar.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:46.000
If I had not gotten this for free, I would not have paid for it.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
However, I am grateful to have it.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:54.000
I'm sure this means chocobo 360 avatar pets will enhance my enjoyment of Final Fantasy 13 on PS3.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Staycare Redertainment.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:00.000
This message has been brought to you by the simple truth of Dark Sakura.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Boobies are fun in need.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
Boobies are great fun.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:07.000
They are.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
We only got one other email.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:13.000
Hey OLR, the mailbag has been dry the past few months so I thought I would write.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:18.000
I've been listening to the show for a few years and had to stop listening live due to me moving to a rural area.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:22.000
And I have shitty satellite internet.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Sucks because I had three months of live left.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Oh well, I was listening to your first episode of the new year and the whole Windows mobile integrating to Xbox Live.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:34.000
You guys didn't think much of it, but think about it.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Most video game characters use some sort of device in game.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:43.000
Your phone could replace any one of those devices from Snakes, Kodak, Nettle Your Solid coming to Xbox I guess.

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:46.000
To a PIP boy or whatever.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Plus with Natal, which I actually don't think will be most things they promise it to be, it could be interesting.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Anyway, I read in my RSS feed today that Microsoft just allowed Razer, you know the ones who make the morbidly expensive PC peripherals, to make and sell a controller and headset.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Seriously, what the fuck.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.000
They just stopped Natal from getting on their share of the market.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:16.000
I understand that it's a different category of product, but it still seems like a dick move on Microsoft's part.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:20.000
If you don't mind a short rant, continue. If you get careless, please skip to the end.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:21.000
It's not that long.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Okay, you're still reading this, so what the heck.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.000
I'm kind of pissed about how cheap people are getting about their games.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Not so much the development aspect of it, but the materials they actually give you.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
First, the cases started getting super cheap.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:37.000
See this BluRay case, the same style is also coming out to Xbox 360 boxes very soon.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Let me pull it up.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:39.000
Oh yeah.

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
You see these?

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:44.000
Oh yeah, I heard about that, that the boxes are going to change. Okay.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:47.000
I'm actually going to link this in chat real quick while I'm thinking about it.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:54.000
And going back to the email.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Another thing that follows this trend is releasing bonus content is download content, yeah.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Yeah, yeah, this is the digital agent all, but it's not really fair to people like me who can't get online.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:12.000
I just got Gears 2 GOTY edition and the included quote,

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:16.000
multiplayer maps, which I could care less about in the extra campaign chapter,

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:21.000
which is the reason I waited for the GOTY edition, were just a code for me to download online.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Even Gears 1 platform had the bonus content on a disc.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:28.000
If I have to shell out 60 bucks for a game, at least give me what I deserve.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Anyway, this email is getting pretty lengthy, so I'll stop it here.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Keep Up The Great Show from Tiberius Jones.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:37.000
Well, thank you very much for the email.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:38.000
I recognize that name.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:42.000
Somebody used to email us a while ago, so I guess that explains why it stopped happening.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Good to hear from you again.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
Yeah.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
You know, I get the whole mobile integration thing,

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:53.000
but I think a lot of the things you were kind of referencing there would like the whole like see something on your phone.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:56.000
I don't think there's the processing power behind it.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:59.000
I mean, do you remember when they came out and announced the PlayStation 3?

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:03.000
They were like, it's going to interface with the PSP, and you can use it as like their rear view mirror in Ridge Racer.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Ridge Racer!

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.000
That was lame.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:06.000
That never happened.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:07.000
It was a stupid idea, too.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:14.000
But I will say, they have done some neat integration where I can log on to my PlayStation 3 from my PSP

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:18.000
and like look at videos and even play some certain games across the internet.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
So some of that integration would be cool,

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:25.000
but I just think a mobile phone doesn't have that same oomph that a dedicated gaming device does.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:28.000
Kind of back to something similar that I did say last week,

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:32.000
I think what you would see that's a little more practical is that, you know, the phone has some type of game

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:36.000
that enhances the experience of a console game.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Like, you know, Fable II Pub Games comes to mind,

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:43.000
but not anything really, I think, that integrated.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
I just don't think mobile phones have that kind of power.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
But I could be wrong.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:48.000
My iPhone has fun gaming.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Yeah, but even iPhone games have their own problems.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
A lot of frame rate issues in a lot of those games, you know.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Maybe it's just my phone. I don't know.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
Alright, well thanks for the e-mails.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
If you have more mail, you can always send us e-mails.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:05.000
But in the meantime, while we wait for your e-mails,

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
we're going to need to get a little bit angsty on the show.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Thankfully, we don't have any stupid moron to inspire our FUs this week,

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:29.000
but that doesn't mean we're not going to let out the angst.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:32.000
I have one. The waiting game. That's it.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.000
Loki.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:38.000
My FU goes to people that play on Xbox Live

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:42.000
and decide to drop because you suck or you're losing.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
I mean, come on.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:48.000
At least in Grand Theft Auto, any score that you're getting

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:52.000
is still going to count toward your rank, even if you suck.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
I don't understand what the point is in dropping

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:55.000
because you know what happens when you drop?

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:59.000
I rate you down anyways, so fuck you.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:03.000
More people should use that rating system, honestly.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:06.000
I have been now everybody that drops, and trust me, it's a lot.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
It's a few per game every time,

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:12.000
and it's rare when we get people to actually stick in there.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Occasionally, we drop, but that's because our internet connection at work sucks,

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:19.000
and it just randomly kicks us out,

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:22.000
not us quitting on purpose like some people do.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
Unfortunately, you probably get rated down for quitting on purpose,

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:25.000
even though you didn't.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:28.000
No, I am rated down 8% by people,

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
and it's for aggressive.

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:34.000
They said it's unsportsmanlike behavior or something like that,

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
basically saying that I'm being too aggressive.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:39.000
That's usually for trash talking, but I don't use a headset.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:40.000
Fascinating.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
There is no trash talking.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:43.000
I'm just kicking their ass.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:44.000
What a bunch of dicks.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:45.000
Babies.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:49.000
Seriously, look at the pussies whining to their mommy.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
There should be some type of check and balance for that

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
for people who abuse that system.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:54.000
I don't really have a lot of FUs.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Just FU to like chaos.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.000
Otherwise, things are fine.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
I don't have a lot to be angsty about.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:04.000
All right, a couple more stories for you guys,

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
and then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR,

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:10.000
but there's some stories still, so Loki.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
This is kind of interesting.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:17.000
There's a new patent that Microsoft, I guess, is a part of

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:23.000
that's for muscle control controllers, I guess.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
The EMG muscle controllers.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:30.000
What it is is basically a device that you would put on your arm

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:36.000
or something that would detect the impulses from your nerves

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
going to your different muscles.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:42.000
So, for example, one of the examples that they show

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:47.000
is someone playing Guitar Hero using just their hand.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:50.000
It's basically the movements and the motions of pushing

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:53.000
the different fret buttons are actually causing

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:59.000
the different fret buttons to hit in the game.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
This could be something that may be tied in with Natal

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:02.000
later on or something like that.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Yeah, I was going to say, the way you describe it,

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.000
it sounds like a Natal thing.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:08.000
Natal should be the thing that sees my fingers

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:11.000
and how I'm moving and all that.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
That's kind of the way they're advertising it.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
It almost sounds like it shouldn't have to be this whole

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:18.000
separate thing, but Natal should just know I have a guitar.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:19.000
I don't know.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:20.000
Yeah.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:23.000
So, I don't know.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:26.000
But apparently, Natal is supposed to detect movement

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:30.000
of at least 31 different parts of your body.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:33.000
So, I don't know if it's really necessary.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
Maybe something else that they're working on.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:36.000
Whatever.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:40.000
If it works, it's cheap.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
I don't know if Air Guitar Hero would be as fun.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
There's something about the plastic guitar that is charming.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
I think it's just proof of concept stuff.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:51.000
I don't think they would actually use it for something like that.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:55.000
True, because Guitar Hero is a third-party game anyway.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
It's not something that's really done by Microsoft.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:58.000
It would feel weird.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:03.000
It would feel really weird just kind of moving your fingers.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:07.000
One more story for you guys, and it's about the PlayStation Network.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Another survey, and I've seen a story like this before,

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:13.000
but this is yet another survey that's talking about

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:16.000
subscription-based features on the PlayStation Network.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:19.000
This is a survey that went out to UK PlayStation Network members,

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:25.000
asking them about possible subscription models for the service.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:28.000
The market research company that's running this is called IPsauce,

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:33.000
IPsauce, and some of the benefits that they mention in here.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:34.000
Let's see.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:35.000
Full title trials.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:36.000
First hour is free.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
So, imagine if you could actually download a full game

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
and play it for an hour for free.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
Cross-game voice chat access.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
I know that's come up before.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:47.000
Member demo sharing a full game.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Not quite sure what that means.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Maybe that means that you could send a demo to somebody,

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
but maybe that's probably this full title trial.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:58.000
Something that strikes me as interesting, token wagering.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Is that like legalized gambling of some sort?

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:03.000
Something like that sounds like strange.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
User-to-user challenges.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Maybe like user-generated trophies.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Early access to all store content.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Well, that's really no different than what they do on Xbox.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
And then this is also what I think is very interesting.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Free access to PS1 classics, PSP minis, and PS3 PSP themes.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
So, imagine if you got a subscription service

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:27.000
to suddenly let you play all the PS1 games you wanted.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:30.000
I wonder if that would be something you would want to go.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Anyway, some of the price options that they're talking about,

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:40.000
as low as 2.99 pounds, which would be about $5 US,

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:44.000
up to $14.99 in the pounds, which would be about $25.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
That would be a monthly fee.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
Also, some annual fees listed there,

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:53.000
up between $32 to $160 would be the range there.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Now, these don't necessarily mean it's true.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Again, the marketing firm could have come up with some of this,

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
but it means Sony's thinking about it.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
But at the same time, and I've said this before

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:04.000
when the story's come up before,

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:07.000
it's not like Sony doesn't already have pay for bonus content.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
It's called Core.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:10.000
But it's interesting.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Some of these features they're talking about,

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
especially the token wagering,

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
I want to know more about what that's all about,

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
and the whole subscription-based PS1 classics.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:20.000
It would be nice if you'd do some PS2 in there as well,

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
being a part of this.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Loki, do you think some of this might be worth paying for,

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
or are you just saying, yeah, forget it?

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
I'm not paying for any of this crap.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:31.000
I don't play the PlayStation Network enough as it is,

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
or play on the PlayStation Network.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
In fact, I don't think I've ever played on the PlayStation Network

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:36.000
with someone else.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Maybe in Little Big Planet once.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
But I'm not paying for any of this.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.000
I'm sorry.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
It does not seem like anything I'm interested in,

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:44.000
and I don't care how much it is.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:45.000
I'm not paying for it.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Game Guru says,

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
again, if PlayStation Network goes subscription-based,

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:52.000
there will likely be no reason for gamers to choose it over Xbox Live.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:53.000
I don't know.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
I think you might be jumping the gun a little bit,

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:58.000
because they're not talking about taking anything away.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
So I don't think they're talking about

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
that now you're going to have to pay to play games online.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.000
I don't think you could...

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
I don't know if that would be possible,

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
because of the games that are already out there.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
I don't think you could tell those games to suddenly not play online.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:10.000
I don't know.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:14.000
But maybe they're talking about trying to enhance it.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
And this could all just tie into core.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
A core membership.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:19.000
Who knows?

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:22.000
And Nat Elias, I hope I said that right,

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:25.000
says, as long as there's a free alternative, I'm cool with it.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:28.000
So again, the survey doesn't say anything about taking anything away.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:31.000
So I don't think PlayStation Network, as you know it today, will change.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
But maybe they'll just try to get more money out of you

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
by throwing extra stuff your way.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:36.000
I just don't care.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:40.000
I'm just not playing that much on the PlayStation Network

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
to where this would be beneficial to me.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:48.000
I mean, if a PlayStation 3 was all I had, then maybe.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
But I think people are so used to free now

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:56.000
that trying to get them to pay extra for this might not work.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
And it obviously is going to be coming,

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
because all these stupid surveys come true.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
We've seen too many of these now.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:03.000
Something's coming.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
And we'll hear about it at E3.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:06.000
Yes, we will.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
All right, we are going to open up the Skype line.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:11.000
1-877-GAME-OLR is where you can send your phone calls.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, all one word.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
If you've never called the show before,

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:21.000
please dial ECHO 1-2-3 first before you give us a call.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
That's ECHO 1-2-3.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:26.000
And then that way you can make sure your connection is working right.

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Let's go to the phones.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Hi, this is GS68.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:34.000
Hi, GS68. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:37.000
I got an FC Mobile 2 this weekend.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:40.000
I just had to give it a try.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:44.000
My thoughts on it went down the more I played it, to be honest.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Really?

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
Like, for one, the system's pretty thick.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:51.000
I mean, I'll kind of excuse that,

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:55.000
since it needs the thickness to accommodate the NES cartridges.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:59.000
But, like, after about playing for about five minutes,

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:02.000
my hands started to get sore.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:05.000
I could feel the soreness lingering, like,

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
hours after I had played it.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:10.000
So is it just not, I don't know, ergonomically well-made,

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
or what's the deal?

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:15.000
It's probably just not ergonomically well-made with it being very thick.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
I see.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:20.000
And then the D-pad is, like, not too great either.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Like, for one, it's PSP style D-pad,

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:25.000
and I hate those kind of D-pads.

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:29.000
Also, the D-pad piece is split in half diagonally.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:33.000
So sometimes it's more action-type of games,

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:36.000
like Xanax and Legend of Zelda.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
But on the plus side, that means they can do some weird glitches,

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:41.000
like pressing left and right at the same time in Zelda 2,

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
causing Link to slide around all over the place.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
Fun.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:48.000
And then it comes with wireless controllers,

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:51.000
and I tried those, and those were more comfortable to hold,

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:54.000
but I found the D-pads were pretty crappy, too.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:58.000
Like, instead of having what I call PSP D-pad syndrome,

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
they now have 360 D-pad syndrome,

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
where they have the tendency to press the wrong direction.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Yeah.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
Boy, those 360 D-pads are pretty terrible.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
Why is it so hard to make a D-pad?

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
That's my question.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
I don't know.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
Although, I don't know. I didn't have the same experience as you.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
I didn't find the D-pad to be that terrible on the FC Mobile,

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
but that's just me.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:23.000
Maybe the quality varies from unit to unit. I don't know.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:27.000
I also have really fat thumbs that could play into it. I don't know.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
No idea.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
What kind of games are you playing?

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
The classic stuff. I know you said Zelda,

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
but what other classics are you enjoying?

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
I was also playing Xanac,

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:40.000
which is a shoot-em-up by the same people behind the Guardian Legend.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Nice. Guardian Legend is a must.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Anything else in your gaming week you want to share with us?

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:51.000
Yeah, I got around to playing Castle of Unity Adventure Reapers.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:55.000
Oh, I played that a little bit on Wii, as well. What'd you think?

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:58.000
I like it so far.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:02.000
I mean, it's about time we finally got a new classic-vania game,

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
as some of the families like to call it.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:07.000
Yeah, it feels very much like a classic Castlevania game.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:11.000
It was like a very Castlevania 3-esque game, which makes sense.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
It's a remake of the Game Boy games.

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:16.000
But, you know, yeah, I kind of felt the same way.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:22.000
And what I like is that you can choose between normal jumping and classic jumping.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:26.000
And, honestly, I like classic jumping better, because when I play normal,

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:30.000
like, jumping things are kind of weird, especially for classic-vania games.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
Like, it tends to throw me off.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:33.000
Like, I'll try to...

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:37.000
Like, I'll jump, and I'll press D by the other way and hit the whip button,

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:40.000
so that way I can whip in the opposite direction when I'm jumping,

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:44.000
but I'm moving backwards instead, which kind of throws me off

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:47.000
and causes me to do stuff I didn't intend to do.

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:50.000
It's still challenging, though. Castlevania is still a very challenging game.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
But, yeah, a lot of folks might have missed that that came out.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:55.000
There's been a lot of those rebirth-type of games that came out between,

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:59.000
what, Contra, I think, Gradius, and now this Castlevania.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:02.000
Oh, and I've been noticing that some people have been complaining

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:05.000
about the lack of a save feature or suspend feature.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
There is a stage select.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:11.000
If you go to the tile menu, select Game Start and hold right for a few seconds,

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
and go to Stage Select.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
Oh, nice. Little pro tip.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:18.000
That's, like, the type of thing I would have read in Nintendo Power.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:22.000
All right, well, GS68, have fun with your FC Mobile,

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
and maybe hopefully it'll get a little more comfortable,

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
and good luck with Castlevania.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:27.000
All right.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:28.000
All right, take care, buddy.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.000
You too.

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:30.000
Bye-bye.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
877-GAMO-LR is the number to call her.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:36.000
Her username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
Let's go to the phones.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Hey, what's up? It's Rama.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:43.000
What's up, Rama?

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Not too much, not too much.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Call to give a nice little game review.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:48.000
Yeah, what game?

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Pop It Music for the Week.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:54.000
Really? Now, I've heard a lot of kind of bullshit about this game,

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:59.000
but looking at your Twitter, you seem to be a little more positive on this, yeah?

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Yeah, because you have to understand, on the average gamer,

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:05.000
and I've come to determine it, because a lot of these Be Money games,

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:10.000
when people kind of shit on said Be Money game that comes to the U.S.,

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:14.000
9 out of 10, they're just mad because the Japanese music

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:18.000
that they loved in the arcade or import versions out on the U.S. release.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:22.000
Okay, I gotcha. You know, I didn't mind.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:25.000
I thought some of the early DDR releases were kind of crap,

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:28.000
but I think one of the best DDR releases they ever did

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
was one of the American ones, Ultra Mix 2.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
I think that was probably one of the best DDRs they ever did,

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:35.000
and I don't think BeatMania for the U.S. was terrible.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
I think they tried to do some cool things with it.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
It's a bummer they didn't get to do a sequel.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:43.000
Yeah, I enjoyed BeatMania for PS. I really enjoyed that, so you know.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
But now Poppin' Music I was a little apprehensive about,

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:50.000
because A, it's the Wii, and B, Beaten Groovy was so fucking terrible,

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:54.000
but how does Poppin' Music make it better?

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:58.000
First things first, we never mention Beaten Groovy again.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
It's on the list of band names.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
I apologize.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:05.000
No problem. Poppin' Music Wii is a little bit different.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:10.000
Instead of like 7 and 9 button control, if I remember correctly,

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:15.000
you have 5 button control, and you use the Wiimote and the chuck,

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:21.000
and you have to pretty much shake in a direction in order to hit the colors.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:27.000
Now, if you shake the controllers to your side, that's hitting the outer green buttons.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:32.000
If you shake on like a 45 degree angle, or straight ahead,

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:37.000
you hit the middle blue buttons, and if you move the Wiimote or the chuck

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:42.000
with one, you know, to your left or to your right, you hit the center red button.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:47.000
Also, if you hit them both together, cross like an X, you can also hit it at the red button as well.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
That sounds terrible. I'm sorry.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:53.000
Well, how does it play? I mean, it might sound bad, but does it play well?

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:58.000
To me, it's kind of like a cross between playing Para Para or Samba de Amigo.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
I can see the samba. I can see that.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:05.000
How's the song list? Is it very Japanese-centric, or did they Americanize it? What did they do?

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:11.000
They Americanized it, but there's some downloadable content which does have Japanese songs on it.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Like, one of my favorite songs is Miracle Moon.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:19.000
So I'm really excited about getting a chance to download that song, actually.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
Oh, they have download content?

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:22.000
Yeah.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Oh, wow. Okay. Cool.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Are there a lot of songs that longtime Bamani fans will recognize?

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:30.000
I know Miracle Moon, obviously. Other stuff like that?

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:35.000
I don't remember a couple of the other ones, but there are some familiar ones in there.

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:42.000
I did write on my Twitter about some of the bands' names I saw when I was browsing through the downloadable content.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:45.000
Is there a lot of downloadable content?

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:59.000
I believe there's like 20 downloadable songs. There's 10 different topics. Each topic has two songs.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:06.000
And pretty much the majority of them are Japanese songs from pop and music games, and I think BeatMania, but don't hold me to that.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:13.000
Well, thanks for the reminder that the game was even out, because I forgot, so I guess maybe it's not as bad as a lot of people are saying it's going to be, huh?

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:21.000
Yeah, you gotta thank Twitter for that. If it was for one of my friends who was at best by matching it, I wouldn't have known to go over to go purchase it.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:25.000
Interesting. Anything else in your gaming league you want to talk about?

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:34.000
That's pretty much it. I will be playing Lost Odyssey later tonight before I go to bed, but I'll say this much.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Pop and music was 29. I personally thought it was a good game to purchase. If it was more than that, I probably would not have bothered.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:54.000
And there's also a two-player and four-player mode. Four-player mode is pretty much you have all nine of the buttons out, and I think four-player mode has all the buttons, but each person takes a remote to hit the correct button.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
Interesting.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Yeah.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Alright, well, DJ Rama, we're going to let you go.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:05.000
I actually wanted to say, I was thinking about you right before you called, seriously.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
We must be on the same wavelength.

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Seriously, about last time you were here and we went to Japantown.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:12.000
Yeah.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:15.000
I mean, no, not Japantown, where we were at Fonamy.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:16.000
Right, yeah.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:20.000
Because it was something about the dealer's room, and then beep, and you called, and then I forgot what it was.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:24.000
I thought it was funny.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:28.000
I'm just reminded when we played on Dance Maniacs together. That was the first time I ever played that.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:32.000
That game is fun. Crazy fun. I love playing in marathon mode.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:37.000
Well, if things go according to plan they show, it may just happen again.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:38.000
Hope so.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
Definitely.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:45.000
Well, we hope to see you soon, DJ Rama, and tell them we'll just rely on the phone calls, okay?

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:46.000
You got it.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Alright, take care, buddy. Have fun now popping music-ing away.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:50.000
I will.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:51.000
Later.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:54.000
1877 Game OLR username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:57.000
I guess we'll do about one more call here tonight before we go.

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:00.000
It's Legend of Zaku.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Hey, Zaku. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:07.000
Nothing much. Just killing another Sunday evening before going back to work.

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:11.000
I hear you. We don't mind people killing time with us. What's on your mind?

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Nothing much. Just taking care of the usual stuff, the little gems that I found from Consumer Electronics Show regarding gaming.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:22.000
Especially the 3D setups that they had for certain games.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:27.000
What do you think about this whole 3D TV? We talked about it a little bit earlier in the show with Avatar and stuff. What do you think?

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:33.000
I mean, if 3D is going to make a comeback, it better be implemented right this time.

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:37.000
Not that red and blue stuff. Not that red and blue shit.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:42.000
It has to be 3D that you can actually see in the actual colors.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:45.000
Well, the technology has come a long way, to be fair.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:50.000
I mean, you have to keep in mind, not every game is meant for 3D anyways.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:59.000
Case in point, some of them, like Gran Turismo 5, which they did a tech demo over the course of the Expo where they had it in 3D and it added nothing.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:02.000
And absolutely nothing to the experience.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:09.000
Whereas games such as Gears or, I think it was, I want to say it was some other games.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:16.000
I think one of them, yeah, the new one coming out, Dark Void, that one had a 3D demo, you know, CES.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:20.000
And that one pretty much made the experience a lot better.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:24.000
So the mileage may vary, pretty much.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:28.000
What about Game Room? What did you think about that?

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Oh, the new thing for Xbox Live?

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:40.000
Oh, yeah, I heard about that. I mean, I've been detached from my 360 for quite some time, but I did hear about the...

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:45.000
I don't know, I guess it's just Microsoft trying to emulate home.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
That's the way I see it.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
I think it's kind of a combination of home and virtual console.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:52.000
I hear a lot of people comparing it to home, but I think there's also a lot of virtual console.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
I think some of the things people have been asking for...

02:24:54.000 --> 02:25:02.000
The way you see it is just them rendering a virtual arcade that Sony could easily dreamt of already baked into their home app.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:08.000
That's pretty much it. All they're doing, Microsoft is just dressing up and taking from what Sony's already done.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
And making it better.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
You know, already in the past.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:23.000
And another thing I want to talk about, you said earlier that certain phones were designed for the social networking aspects within video games.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:32.000
Right now, there's a shift going on within mobile devices.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:40.000
Obviously, the iPhone was the catalyst for it, but you have platforms like Android, Windows Mobile, Blackberry...

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:45.000
All of them are not your cheap, run-of-the-mills cell phone platform, and they're pretty robust.

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:50.000
I mean, I would know, because I work with most of them professionally.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:57.000
So their world's better than the phones that I used to work in when I graduated college almost four years ago.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:04.000
I got that, but again, I look at something like the PSP, which is a dedicated game system, and they still have yet to pull off the...

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:11.000
And I'm not talking about... I get if they build something separate on the phone that ties into the game somehow.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:14.000
Again, I give the pub games example.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:21.000
But this whole, like, you are going to actually... Because in the email it kind of talked about, imagine you're Solid Snake and you can whip out your phone and something happens on your phone.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:26.000
I'm like, I don't see that level of integration happening on phones, period, yet.

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:29.000
I mean, it can be done. I mean, it all depends on the platform.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:39.000
Case in point, Android. For example, you can actually run multiple apps, apps that actually support push, that can run while your phone is running in the background.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:46.000
So let's say you do get an alert from something like you described with Solid Snake.

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:50.000
It will just pop up on your phone, vibrate in it, and inform you.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:57.000
Same can also be done with iPhone if they opened up the platform and had support for multiple apps.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:01.000
But Android is a good example of how you can accomplish what you just described.

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:06.000
Hmm. Well, it'll be interesting to see if it takes off. I just don't know.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:09.000
Especially with the iPhone dominating everything.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:15.000
If they can pull off Facebook and Twitter and all the other social networking sites on any given mobile platform,

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:25.000
even the good ones like Android or Blackberry, then it can be done. It just has to be executed.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:33.000
But social networking is not as much bandwidth as a freaking game running video to your phone, you know?

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:37.000
Well, it can be done. You're underestimating the power of cell phones now.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Perhaps.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:45.000
Obviously, you would have won the argument several years ago, but the game is different now.

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:57.000
It's a different mobile environment. When you have phones that have tens of megabytes of memory to run apps and high-speed connections and bigger screens.

02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:01.000
I can understand that, and especially Japan has been ahead of the game in that market for a while,

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:05.000
but how much of those really penetrated the entire marketplace?

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:13.000
The G1 is pretty much a good baseline Android phone that's slated to get 2.0, so it still has some fighting in it.

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:19.000
Plus any other Android phone, and obviously the iPhone, the Blackberry, and the Palm Bree.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:22.000
I'm naming these off my head right now.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:29.000
So there's a lot that could be done. It's just a matter of the execution and the design.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:35.000
In other words, it's not impossible, and it shouldn't be ruled out.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:43.000
It just has to be planned to work well within the confines of how it ought to function.

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:47.000
Alright, I will see you there. I appreciate the perspective.

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:52.000
I won't say it's impossible, but I'll still say probably not anytime soon.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Anytime soon is very close right now. When Android comes very close to second place behind the iPhone,

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:10.000
you'll have the install base and the wherewithal to execute it, even with Blackberries out there.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:16.000
By the end of this year, I should have won the argument, more or less.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:20.000
We shall see, and if I'm wrong, then I'm wrong. It sounds like it'll be a good thing for gaming.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
If Rob's wrong, he has to wear the tingle costume.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Fuck that shit. No way.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:28.000
I mean, right now, you're probably going to get a refresh anyways with a new model,

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:33.000
so they may end up selling you a Blackberry or an Android phone or something like that.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:37.000
And those are very powerful. Those are much powerful than your standard run-of-the-mill.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:41.000
Alright. Alright, well, Zachary, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up,

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
but thanks so much for the call, okay? We appreciate the other perspective.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:44.000
Alright, have a good one.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:45.000
Good luck. Later.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Bye.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:49.000
Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight. Sorry to those that didn't get through.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:50.000
Something else occurred to me?

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:51.000
Yeah, what's up?

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:55.000
You know, there are actually regular cell phones that would be powerful enough to do stuff like that in Japan.

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:58.000
Well, yeah, but, you know, not anything I'm going to see.

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:06.000
But there's been a tendency now for companies to compete with the smartphones by implementing some of the stuff they've got out in the K-tie already, so...

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:11.000
I get what he's saying, that it's possible, but unfortunately, you know, I just, I don't,

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:15.000
I guess he seems to think it's going to happen a lot sooner than I'm giving it credit for.

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:18.000
Maybe the technology's moving a little faster than I'm thinking,

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:25.000
but I kind of go, you know, you have to have a lot of people who are going to use it in order to make it effective to build, if that makes sense.

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:26.000
That makes sense.

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:27.000
That's my little concern.

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
But I get what Zaku's saying.

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:36.000
He's saying probably I'm not giving the technical side of it enough appreciation, so, and maybe the way it came off I wasn't, so that's fair enough.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:39.000
Alright, anyhow, that's going to do it for tonight's show.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Once we do last minute stories, I want to skip those.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:45.000
Dark Soccer, Loki, any of you guys have last minute stories tonight?

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
Or do we cover it all?

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:50.000
The Mega Man fan movie's going to be coming out soon.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:55.000
This was shown off in a trailer back in November 2008.

02:30:55.000 --> 02:31:03.000
And apparently it will be coming out, available on the internet soon enough.

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:12.000
I'm trying to see when exactly, it's going to be, it's going to be 109 minutes long.

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:22.000
And I guess it will be available probably on the website for the film, which is megaman.ninjin.com.

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
That's N-I-N-G-I-N.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:29.000
And they actually have some stuff from that.

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:33.000
I guess it was being shown at MAGFest 2010.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:38.000
It was a rough cut that they showed, and that happened actually today.

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:42.000
So, um, soon enough I guess.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:43.000
It looks kind of interesting.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:49.000
The guy that had been playing Wily though kind of looks, looks like he needs to wash his face.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:52.000
Are they going to learn anything from the Zelda experience?

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:55.000
I'm just saying, like, you know, do you think maybe there's going to be a problem?

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:59.000
That Nintendo or Capcom in this case will say,

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:04.000
Hey, pull this off the internet, and then it will actually still be on the internet, and nothing will be accomplished.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:07.000
Yep, I'm sure they'll learn a lot from that.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:10.000
Fine.

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
I see your point.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:16.000
Nothing will happen.

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:17.000
Is that it?

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:20.000
Um, this is kind of interesting.

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:35.000
There was a comment, I guess, Gamasutra ran a feature on third-party publisher reactions to the abysmal sales of uninteresting games, or various party games.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:38.000
One of the comments was, one thing for sure, the focus has changed.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:49.000
Stores like Target and Best Buy have reportedly told game publishers not to even bother approaching them with collections of minigames, which they will no longer pick up.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:52.000
Good for them!

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:57.000
I think that's a great thing, and you know, honestly, I've been seeing a lot more of that just from my customers.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:01.000
And honestly, I kind of figured that anyways, and I steer them away from that crap.

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
Only good stuff.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:12.000
But sadly enough though, even the good stuff I recommend, like the No More Heroes and that kind of thing, in Madworld, just doesn't do well.

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:17.000
That's a bummer, because stupid parents out there want to buy that fucking minigame crap.

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:20.000
This is what's wrong with gaming nowadays.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
The Wii, the Wii is everything that is wrong with gaming.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
The Wii ruined everything!

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:25.000
Exactly.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:29.000
But they still have, you know, there's certain games that come out on the Wii that you have to have.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:33.000
Like, I feel justified owning a Wii, because there is some real good shit that comes out for it.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:36.000
Like New Super Mario Bros. Wii was fantastic.

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:39.000
Crazy stuff.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:43.000
Hey, one of our chatters is calling us in on a last minute story, and actually this is something I do remember reading.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
I just neglected to put it on the show the night.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:48.000
But Jay Dizzle in our chatroom at chat.orangessontraday.com is saying,

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:51.000
Crayon physics is on sale till the 15th.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:52.000
You can pay as much as you want.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:55.000
It's doing that whole thing where you can pay what you feel the game is worth.

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
You got some people paying a penny for it.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:00.000
Maybe they're hoping some people will pay $150.

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:03.000
You know, like happened, I think, when World of Goo did that.

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:08.000
So, you know, I would say maybe like $5, $10, whatever you believe is appropriate.

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:12.000
Or maybe I'll probably go buy it and pay $6.66.

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
I think that would be fun.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
Or $6.90.

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:20.000
No, you should pay $4.20.

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
$5.37.

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
Anything? Oh, $5.30.

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:25.000
$5.73.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
Let's see what you did there.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:28.000
Nice.

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
Any other last minute stories tonight, Loki?

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:31.000
That's it.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:32.000
All right.

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:33.000
That's going to do it.

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:37.000
We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts before we wrap it up tonight.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
So, Dark Soccer, what's your final thought tonight?

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:43.000
I finally learned to knit a scarf without messing up my rows.

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:44.000
Congrats.

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
See, it doesn't look nice.

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:50.000
My final thought is LA tomorrow, Seattle Friday.

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
I've got a busy week ahead.

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:53.000
Loki, your final thought?

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:57.000
My final thought is I wish people would stop quitting out of my games on Grand Theft Auto.

02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:02.000
And, you know, I don't know what I've got to do.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:03.000
I'm even nice.

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:09.000
Usually when I'm like $1,000 ahead, I'll just fuck around so that, you know, at least I'm not, like, pissing people off.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:12.000
Although there was at one time that I was trying to get a high streak.

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
I got a 17 streak.

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:17.000
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:20.000
Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and downloading our show and supporting it.

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:23.000
Remember, if you like what you hear, all we ask, tell a couple friends about the show.

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:28.000
Help us spread the word because we don't have big budget dollars to advertise and all that stuff about our show.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
So, we really appreciate the word of mouth.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:31.000
Really appreciate it.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:38.000
I'm also being asked to remind you guys that our buddies at Understation Live are collecting the top 25 games of all time.

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:44.000
So, please, if you have a little time today, make a top 25 list of your favorite games of all time.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
No criteria, but what is your favorite?

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:54.000
And email them to uslmadness, that's u-s-l-m-a-d-n-e-s-s at gmail.com and help our buddies out over at Understation Live.

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:57.000
Remember a programming note, there is no show next week.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:00.000
Podcast listeners, you will see a new show in two weeks.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:09.000
And for those of you that do listen live, it will be 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern, which means 6 o'clock London and Greenwich.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:12.000
So, you overseas folks are hopefully in for a treat.

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:15.000
I want lots of accents next week on the Skype line.

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:16.000
One more plot though, remember.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:17.000
Yeah, yes, please.

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:29.000
Tara and I are doing, or Maron Marvel and I are doing a podcast, although we may or may not have one this week, for Monday Comics Mania, which you can see at AvengersTowerAllInWord.com.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
Oh my god, comics.

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:34.000
Yeah, you get to hear Rob's cameo.

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:35.000
Very nice.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:39.000
When do I get to come be a guest on the show and I'll talk about, I don't know, I'll go, I'll read, you know what I will do?

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:43.000
One week I will read a comic, just so I can actually be on your show.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
Get to my house early.

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:46.000
Alright, fair enough.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:51.000
Alright, that's it guys. Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting us. We really appreciate it.

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:56.000
Hey, have a great couple of weeks. We'll be back. There will be a show on the feed on the 24th.

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
And again, for those of you guys that want to listen early, we'll be here.

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:04.000
Stay tuned to our Twitter, our Facebook for all of the updates and AllGames.com should be running copies of that too.

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:07.000
So, we'll see you in a little while. Bye guys.

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:14.000
