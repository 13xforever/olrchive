00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and the Lowkey

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, January 10th, 2010, Microsoft shows us their game room at CES,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
a popular Nintendo Wii game is no longer being published,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and could NBA Jam be making a comeback?

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We are that program dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you for the next three hours.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Also, as always, the one and only lovely DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hi.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How are you?

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Frustrated.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry to hear that. Why are you frustrated?

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Because I realized that I started stitching in two wide stitches, well, actually stitches too many,

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
on this tube scarf I was making, so now I have a doll-sized tube dress.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Well, you know, if you decide that you don't want it, you could always set it on fire.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That would be pretty amazing.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But that would mean setting my stuff on fire.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, you know, at least you could watch it go down in a blaze of glory.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Also, say hello to the one and only pyromaniac tech master, Lowkey.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hello.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
How are you?

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm fine.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Have you set fire to anything this week?

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Not this time. All right.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Well, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com,

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That's at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So thanks, of course, to the folks at All Games Radio for letting us steal their bandwidth, as they do every Sunday night.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We do have a lot of news to get into tonight, but of course we always started off with a little bit of how was our gaming week.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But we're going to mix it up a little bit tonight because we did something special this week.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I know a lot of you guys have been listening to this show for a little while.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But if it is your first time listening, hello, welcome.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You know, it's just like three friends who met a long time ago at an arcade, believe it or not.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Playing DDR was the game we used to play back in the day and decided to start a radio show about games.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And here we are almost eight years later still doing our show.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Pretty amazing.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Anyhow.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Translation?

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Give us jobs.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Professional jobs.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Here's the thing.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We don't hang out a lot like we used to during the week.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You know, this show is kind of the way we all hang out.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I mean, once in a while there's a party or something's going on.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And it's not like we avoid each other.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's just we're all busy.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You know, I work a day job.

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Dark Sakura has school and other things she's got to do.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm avoiding you.

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And Loki, you know, just bought a house.

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And they both have the married life going on.

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And I'm driving to the Bay Area for stuff all the time.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We don't see each other an awful lot during the week.

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But this week was a little different.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We actually went on an O.L.R. date.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Dark Sakura, myself, and Loki all went to see Avatar.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
As many of you have apparently because it's what?

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's already like the number three highest grossing movie ever.

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And it looks like, based on the take this week,

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
there's a very good chance it's going to take over the Batman movie.

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
They're saying it could even take over Titanic.

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So a lot of you have seen the movie.

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So I don't know if we're going to sit here and review it

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
because, you know, most of you have already seen it it sounds like.

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But how about our thoughts on the movie?

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Because we did get to see it in 3D,

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
which I thought was, you know, kind of different

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
because I don't see a lot of movies in 3D.

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I mean, it's kind of a new thing.

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The only other movie I've seen in 3D was Up,

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
which, you know, didn't use the 3D as heavily.

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Like, I didn't think the 3D kind of added a lot to Up.

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But certainly Avatar kind of added some stuff to it.

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Loki, what did you think of Avatar?

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This is your second time seeing it, right?

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yes, it is.

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
By the way, keep it spoiler free

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
because some of our chatters have not seen it yet and want to.

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Have you seen Pocahontas?

83
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You've seen Avatar.

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I call it Space Pocahontas.

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Or FernGully.

86
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
FernGully means Pocahontas in space with Smurfs.

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No, I like just...

88
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Even the technology behind the whole movie is pretty awesome.

89
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Like, a lot of the 3D stuff, it's not so much, you know,

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Hey, look, we made a 3D movie,

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
so we're going to have tons of stuff flying at your face.

92
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Or, you know, we're going to scare you.

93
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Ooh, look, it's coming towards you.

94
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You know, nothing like that.

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's just really cool looking.

96
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Like, a lot of the shots, you know, look very realistic.

97
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And it's kind of amazing when you think about it

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
that all the backgrounds and everything in the movie

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
are really computer generated.

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And, I mean, a lot of it you kind of forget that it is

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
because it looks really good.

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But the storyline, I mean, it's just all right.

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's not, you know, you don't really go to see this movie

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
because, you know, it's such a deep storyline.

105
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's just very predictable, but it's got great characters in it,

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and it's just a fun movie.

107
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Darsagra, what did you think?

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Well, I had very low expectations,

109
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and then my expectations were sort of pooped on.

110
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I thought it was really good.

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm going to see it again, because you know me.

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
If I like a movie once, I'll see it twice.

113
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
How many times did you see Silent Hill in the theaters?

114
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Like, four or five?

115
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Four.

116
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I saw Star Trek eight times.

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh, my God.

118
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But keep in mind, when it got to the cheapo theater,

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I was just going every week.

120
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh, I gotcha.

121
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Although, actually, I think five of my times seeing it

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
were in the full-price theater.

123
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So, if that's any indication.

124
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I think that the 3D was implemented very, very nicely.

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Instead of, like Loki said, of it being,

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
ah, 3D, ah, it was more immersive.

127
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Like, there were a few things that did surprise me

128
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
as far as just, you know,

129
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I really have no other comparison to put this to,

130
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
but you know, the head tracking mode for Wii,

131
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
that little hack, it made me think of that.

132
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Because it almost felt sometimes like you could peek around

133
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
the screen and see stuff inside of it,

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
or if you moved closer, you'd get a wider view.

135
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It was that kind of immersion.

136
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And it actually did not give me a headache,

137
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
because the other movies I've seen in 3D was

138
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I saw Nightmare Before Christmas twice in IMAX, in 3D.

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And that gave me kind of a headache and made me pass out.

140
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You know, I was explaining that I have a problem with 3D,

141
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
because I tend to get really motion sick.

142
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But I think I only got motion sick once,

143
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and that was in the flying, one of the big flying scenes.

144
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And other than that, I mean,

145
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
especially since I wear glasses

146
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and was wearing the 3D glasses over my glasses,

147
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I didn't really have as bad of a problem as I expected to,

148
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
except when I took the 3D glasses off,

149
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I had a big adjustment,

150
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
because I'm looking through two lenses

151
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
trying to get the 3D effect out of it.

152
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But story-wise, yeah, predictable.

153
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We saw this coming.

154
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But it was predictable in a gratifying way,

155
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I want to say, if that makes sense.

156
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Like, oh, yeah, that's a little bit more

157
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
than what I thought would happen with it.

158
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Or, yeah, that's how that should go.

159
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm fine with that.

160
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But I liked it.

161
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I was already looking up stuff online.

162
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
There's gonna be a sequel, which I'm looking forward to,

163
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
although I'm wondering what direction

164
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
they're gonna go with it.

165
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But, yeah, actually, I'm really impressed.

166
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
As a language nerd, I was very impressed

167
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
with the construction of the language.

168
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah, I guess they built that language for the movie.

169
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Like, some professor at a university did it.

170
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah, a linguistics professor created the language.

171
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And it actually...

172
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Some of the other ones that I've studied,

173
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
it uses, actually, the grammar structures

174
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
very similar to American Sign Language.

175
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And I notice it actually has things in common

176
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
with Japanese and with American Sign Language

177
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
in terms of your object order.

178
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So I was actually pretty, pretty pleased with that.

179
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Reading just so much more into it,

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I have to say that I'm impressed overall

181
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
with the work that went into it.

182
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And with the fluidity of the motion capture,

183
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
that was very impressive, and I know that that was

184
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
a pretty new technology that they used with it, too.

185
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I also went back and read an interview

186
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
as to why people were blue.

187
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Because, and to paraphrase the quote,

188
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
it's that, well, it was to contrast

189
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
with the skin tones of humans, first of all,

190
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
to enhance the bioluminescence,

191
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
because everything on the planet was bioluminescent.

192
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And also, because they'd already done Little Green Men.

193
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
They wanted them to be blue.

194
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Nice.

195
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yeah. So, overall, I have to say,

196
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I like a movie that a lot of thought and energy

197
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
had been put into, and it was very clear

198
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
that a lot of work went into this,

199
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
and you could see it in the final production, so.

200
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And that, and I wanted to punch that guy in the face.

201
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Not the Marine.

202
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The Colonel guy.

203
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Yeah, because he actually, he's what I expected him to be.

204
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I wanted no redemption out of him.

205
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm not trying to spoil it,

206
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and I know most of you have seen it.

207
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I wanted no redemption out of him.

208
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I wanted him to be a hard ass to the end, and he sure was.

209
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But it was the corporate guy.

210
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Because you could almost see him thinking about it.

211
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And then, ooh, dollars.

212
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So, and I've seen him in other stuff,

213
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and I can't think of what.

214
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That you gotta IMDB it.

215
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yeah.

216
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So, yeah.

217
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You might remember, I kind of came out before this movie,

218
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
and I was like, I just hope it tanks.

219
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Like, it looks terrible from the trailer,

220
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and James Cameron's kind of an arrogant ass,

221
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and, you know, just after Titanic,

222
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I just kind of wanted to see the movie tank.

223
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So I went in with very low expectations.

224
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Like, I was kind of like Dark Saga.

225
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
All right, what the hell.

226
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'll go.

227
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I got three hours to kill.

228
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Let's go see the damn movie.

229
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I was wrong.

230
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It was good.

231
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It was a good movie.

232
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Props to Cameron.

233
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You did it again.

234
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It was good.

235
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Was it like OMG Oscar winning story and all this?

236
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
No.

237
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I mean, the story you've kind of heard before,

238
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
but it's effective.

239
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And I know here we are, a video game podcast,

240
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
talking about movies,

241
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
but I want to kind of bring this back to video games a little bit,

242
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
because honestly, I kind of thought the movie

243
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
was just a giant video game.

244
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Like, the graphics were really good in Avatar.

245
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You know, and that's kind of one of the things.

246
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I was like, wow, the landscape is really pretty.

247
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The way the Navi were done was really pretty,

248
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
and just everything about the movie was really, really pretty.

249
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And so the game had great graphics.

250
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And even the story, I got to be honest,

251
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
the story, without getting into spoilery,

252
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I was really reminded of Final Fantasy VII.

253
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
There was a lot of tie-ins to me with Final Fantasy VII,

254
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and you have to admit,

255
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
there was an epic boss battle at the end of the movie,

256
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
which is to be expected.

257
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I really was epic.

258
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Also, that guy, I actually remember him from My Name is Earl.

259
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Ah, there you go.

260
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So, it was very epic.

261
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I think in some ways,

262
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and this is going to sound like a much bigger compliment

263
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
than maybe the movie actually deserves,

264
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
but I actually think in some ways,

265
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
this movie is going to be like this generation's Wizard of Oz.

266
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Like, because if you think about it,

267
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The Wizard of Oz was actually not like that great of a movie,

268
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
but it's one of those ones we kind of all remember

269
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
because it was that musical that we all remember,

270
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
and it was that color.

271
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It was the first color movie we all kind of remember.

272
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Obviously, not all of us were alive when that movie first came out,

273
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
but it meant a lot for color.

274
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And I think Avatar is going to be a lot of that for 3D,

275
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
even though it might not be the best or most original story in the world.

276
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I think they're going to look back on this years from now

277
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and say this is when 3D started being a big thing.

278
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But I'm kind of, I'm a little worried about it

279
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
because I got to say, the 3D kind of bugged me.

280
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Like, it wasn't, and I didn't think it was gimmicky or anything like that,

281
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
but the 3D bugged me because I had to take those glasses off

282
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
like every 10 minutes because I actually was like hurting my eyes.

283
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And the same thing kind of happened when I was watching Up.

284
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Like, I just, I can't sit there and do the 3D the whole time.

285
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's kind of a pain on my eyes.

286
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So that was the only, I mean, it looked nice, don't get me wrong,

287
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and I thought it definitely was kind of like something I haven't seen before,

288
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
but I'm a little worried because, you know, Consumer Electronics Show is this week,

289
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
obviously, bringing it back to gaming a little bit,

290
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
and although there was some gaming news we'll get to later a little bit,

291
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
it was more about the tech and the gadgets.

292
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That's what CES is about.

293
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
One of the big, big things they're talking about this year, 3D television.

294
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Is 3D TV is like the big thing, and this actually kind of worries me

295
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
because I'm like, I kind of don't want my TV to be 3D

296
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
because it hurts to watch.

297
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I seriously doubt that's going to be the case

298
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
because it would require, you know, the glasses and everything.

299
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
They should have, it would probably be an option.

300
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But they're talking about ESPN and 3D and all this stuff.

301
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Like, I realize, you know, nobody's going to make me tune to that network,

302
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
but it's definitely kind of the wave of the future,

303
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and I hope they find a way to make it less painful.

304
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So, go to our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

305
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
AlphaKananagram says, Sky said the game had good graphics. LMFAO.

306
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah, I mean, seriously, I found the movie to be very much like a video game.

307
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It was kind of a cliche plot, but it was executed very well.

308
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm not saying it was executed very, very well.

309
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I actually think, what's her name?

310
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That Zoe Saldana, the one that was Uhura in Star Trek.

311
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
She would, dude, she should like get nominated for an Oscar.

312
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Honestly, I honestly mean that. She was amazingly good.

313
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yeah.

314
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But, and Sigourney Weaver, oh my God, love her.

315
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I do have to tell you, the movie scene, the full thing's going to be in the DVD release.

316
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Could he?

317
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
But, I'm not going to praise all the actors

318
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
because I can't fucking stand Michelle Rodriguez.

319
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I cannot stand her. She brought the movie down for me.

320
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But at least she wasn't in a lot of scenes.

321
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yeah, she definitely was like a supporting actress.

322
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yeah.

323
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah.

324
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
But I'm just not a fan of her, so I, bleh.

325
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You know that there cannot be a Cameron movie without the angry Hispanic chick.

326
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You know what?

327
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I don't think there was one in Titanic.

328
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yeah, but aliens high.

329
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So, anyway, reading some of the comments from chat.

330
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
SSJ100Matt says, I wouldn't go that far.

331
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It was okay, but I don't see it lasting the test of time like Wizard of Oz.

332
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's, I think it's too early to say.

333
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Like, again, I don't think people are going to go back and go,

334
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
oh, this is like just a phenomenal fucking movie.

335
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Like, The Lord of the Rings will be.

336
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I think they're going to look back on that one time.

337
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I don't know. I went back to The Wizard of Oz after a while

338
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
because I used to, you know, I used to like that movie

339
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
and I find it really grating on my ears now

340
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
and just a really annoying, awful movie.

341
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So, I don't know if Wizard of Oz has, you know, lasted the test of time either

342
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
because you watch it and you're like, wow, this kind of sucks.

343
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Now, however, The Return to Oz, I think that's a way better movie anyways

344
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
because there's no singing in it.

345
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I think the singing really brought it down.

346
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Well, Return to Oz was based off the books in particular.

347
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
As they should do some more movies based off the books.

348
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
SSJ100Matt in chat says also, I don't think the 3D added all that much to it.

349
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It was nice without it.

350
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I kind of agree. I think I would have still felt the same about the movie

351
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
had I seen it in 2D.

352
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But 3D did give that little extra kick.

353
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You know, that little extra wow factor that really brought the graphics,

354
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
so to speak, home.

355
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Like, that planet was beautiful.

356
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And I'm actually excited to play the game.

357
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And sure enough, Loki managed to...

358
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Not only did he get us free tickets to the movie.

359
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Thank you very much, Loki. We appreciate it.

360
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Now he scrounged up a copy of Avatar the Game on PlayStation 3.

361
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So, Dark Soccer and I are going to kind of trade it back and forth

362
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
since I'm going to be traveling this next week.

363
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
She's going to borrow it and then I'm going to take it.

364
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So, you're going to have a 3D TV because that is in 3D if you have a 3D TV?

365
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That's what I hear. You know what? I'll pass anyway.

366
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Well, no. I think that my TV is capable.

367
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Do you have the glasses for it?

368
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I stole the ones from the theater.

369
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yeah, but different TVs have different 3D...

370
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Unless your TV supports real D, then those glasses will work with that.

371
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
If they don't, or if it doesn't, then you may need shutter glasses or something like that.

372
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
We've actually got shutter glasses for the...

373
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Oh, crap. The Master System.

374
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Well, speaking of 3D, my boyfriend bought Coraline on Blu-ray,

375
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
and that comes with the red and blue, I think, because we were watching it a little bit.

376
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's green and magenta.

377
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I didn't watch the whole movie. I haven't seen the movie yet,

378
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
but he wanted to see a couple clips to see how it played out.

379
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And it was okay, but again, my eyes just don't take well.

380
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
In the theater, though, the 3D in Coraline was awesome.

381
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But they did the same type of thing they did in Avatar, right?

382
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The real 3D, or whatever it's called, right?

383
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Real D, yeah. I think real D would be the best option,

384
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
because, man, those shutter glasses are expensive.

385
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
They're like $200 a piece, and if you're gonna get some for your friends and stuff like that,

386
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
forget about it. But real D, man, those glasses are so damn cheap to manufacture,

387
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
it's almost as cheap as the red-blue glasses, but you don't have the color distortion in it.

388
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Alright, so I know you're all joking that, hey, we're turning into movie lounge radio all of a sudden,

389
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
but hey, there's a reason we're talking about this, because Avatar has done so well

390
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
that I think, honestly, the CES, this 3D TV, Avatar's gonna be a big release.

391
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You know they're gonna try to make it 3D somehow on its release.

392
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Whatever they do with the home version, whether it be the red-blue or the real D,

393
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
but you'd have to have a TV. I don't know what the hell they're gonna do.

394
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And I think it will come over to games.

395
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Where the movie goes, games will soon go, and this might be something that's in the PlayStation 4,

396
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
the Xbox 720, and whatever other hypothetical system you wanna come up with.

397
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I just kinda hope, again, that they find a way to make it easier on the eyes,

398
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
and that they don't rely on it as a crutch, that it gets too gimmicky.

399
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You know, it's gonna be the gimmick for the first year it comes out,

400
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
they're gonna overdo it with everything, and then they're gonna slack back off,

401
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
just like with everything else.

402
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Let's talk about our gaming weeks. Enough movies.

403
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Let's actually talk about the video games we've been playing this week.

404
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Dark Soccer, what kind of games have you been playing this week?

405
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Well, mostly watching Dan play Borderlands.

406
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I played Lumines on Steam, and then was very disappointed to realize that Shining wasn't in it.

407
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And, of course, Peggle.

408
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I finally beat one of those crappy extra point levels, you know, that I was yelling at.

409
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And once I did it, I actually managed to beat another one after that,

410
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
but now I'm on the million point level, and I'm like, oh, whatever.

411
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Also, I've got Silent Hill, Shattered Memories, but I haven't had a chance to play it,

412
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
because, again, I haven't been able to get Dan's butt off of Borderlands.

413
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And he hasn't got me Bayonetta yet, which makes me weep.

414
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You've got to get him to get that for you.

415
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
All right.

416
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

417
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Real quick, to go back to what we were talking about before,

418
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
remember how they were talking about 3D TV at CES?

419
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Well, the format that they're kind of working towards is Realty, actually,

420
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
so that would be kind of cool.

421
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And they're, I guess, partnering with Sony, JVC, Samsung, Toshiba, Panasonic, and DirecTV.

422
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So, that would be the best way to go, I think,

423
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
because, like I said, glasses are cheap, not intrusive.

424
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Anyways, so games.

425
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I actually got to play some of the stuff I've been meaning to play and putting off for a while.

426
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I finally played Borderlands, and it's awesome.

427
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Very fun game.

428
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I've actually played it for a few hours.

429
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm only level seven right now, but I did finish killing Nineto,

430
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
which is one of the characters in the game.

431
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And, I don't know, the game itself reminds me a lot of Final Fantasy XI with guns,

432
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
because a lot of the enemies and stuff, they have certain spawn points in the game,

433
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
and you see them kind of just wandering around and stuff like that,

434
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
like you would in Final Fantasy VII,

435
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
just without all the other people running around with you.

436
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And you have kind of different zones you can kind of zone into to kill different creatures and whatnot.

437
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And it just reminds me so much with the quests and the findings of Final Fantasy XI.

438
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Although, at the same time, it's a little bit more like Diablo,

439
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
because there's a lot of, like, okay, you find these random chests on the ground,

440
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
you can open them up, and there's money there,

441
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
or the enemies drop ammo and money and all that fun stuff.

442
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Plus, there's all the random weapons in the game,

443
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
since there's literally three-quarters of a million weapons in the game.

444
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
So there's all these different unique weapons.

445
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's got this pistol that sets things on fire, so that's pretty awesome.

446
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
But it's just really cool, and I'm really disappointed that it took me so long to play the game,

447
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
but I definitely will be playing it for a long time,

448
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
and probably will download the download content later on,

449
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
as soon as I get a little further in the game.

450
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Must play the island of Dr. Ned.

451
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's all about shooting brains out of their skulls.

452
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Seriously.

453
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Awesome.

454
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You guys are making me want to play this game, like, very badly.

455
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Get it, Rob? Play it. I can't play it, you know.

456
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
When I talk about my gaming week, I'll tell you why I can't play Borderlands yet,

457
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
because I'm too distracted.

458
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The other thing is, um, non-kind of gaming.

459
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Well, I've also been playing Grand Theft Auto.

460
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I actually played some Grand Theft Auto this weekend,

461
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
because I was trying to just play some more online games,

462
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
just with some other people other than my coworkers and stuff,

463
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
because I've been kicking the crap out of my coworkers a lot,

464
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
to the point where they're getting really frustrated with me,

465
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
and the people online that we play with get really frustrated with me,

466
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
and they end up dropping because I just kicked the crap out of them.

467
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And, you know, not to sound like, oh, I'm the best person ever.

468
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I doubt that I am, but this weekend, though, playing with just random games,

469
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
you know, other people hosting games, their settings, whatever they want to do,

470
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I still kicked the crap out of everybody.

471
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So modest.

472
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And a lot of them dropped.

473
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And there's even people that were blatantly cheating, you know,

474
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
using lag switches and turbo controllers and stuff like that,

475
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
and I still kicked the crap out of them.

476
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So, I mean, I don't know what to do, and everybody keeps dropping.

477
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I really hate that everybody drops out of the games.

478
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I mean, seriously, just try a little bit.

479
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
You know, maybe you'll learn something, get a little bit better,

480
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
instead of just quitting because you just can't seem to kill somebody.

481
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I don't know.

482
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Whatever.

483
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
But, so, yeah, I've been working my way up the ranks.

484
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Right now, I think I'm in the, I know I'm in the top 300 on Lost and Damned

485
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
out of ranked death matches, probably up 250 by now.

486
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
But I've been working my way up to number one,

487
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
so hopefully I'll hit that at some point.

488
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I know I'm up there, whereas my other coworkers are in the 700s to 1,000s.

489
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
So I'm just looking for a challenge out there,

490
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
and I really hope that people that play online would stop dropping

491
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
because it's ridiculous and very frustrating.

492
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And, let's see, other than Xbox 360 stuff, I worked on the cabinet a little bit more.

493
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I played a little bit Tubin this week because Jim came over and he wanted to play Tubin.

494
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So I tried that, and man, that's hard to control.

495
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I forgot how hard that game was.

496
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
So that was kind of cool.

497
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And then next week, I should be getting some Xbox 360 repair kits

498
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
for the Red Ring of Death stuff, mainly just because I didn't really want to send out.

499
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I have six systems just waiting to be repaired,

500
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
and one of them I can actually send back to Microsoft, the other few of them.

501
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm just going to try to repair real quick.

502
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
If it doesn't work, then oh well, I'll just send it out to somebody to repair it.

503
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
But I had one that I repaired, and it worked for a while.

504
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
So, you know, I'll give it a shot.

505
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And I also got a, what is it, a Cyclops, a Cygnus 2 mod chip for one of my 360s.

506
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So I'm going to play with that, assuming I can get it soldered on there.

507
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Because, I don't know, I had good luck with my Wii mod chip.

508
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I was able to solder that.

509
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Not so much with my PSP when I tried modding that into the arcade cabinet.

510
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So I'm 50-50 right now.

511
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Maybe Dan can help you, because he repairs the pinball tables all the time.

512
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
He's really good with soldering.

513
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I think I'm going to give it a go.

514
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I don't think it'll be too difficult. I have to see how small the points are.

515
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
A PSP is damn hard.

516
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Even with a magnifying glass, I couldn't see the points on there,

517
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
because they were so close together.

518
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I think on a 360 board, it's a little bit more spread apart.

519
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
So it should be alright.

520
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And they have crap on their board where nothing wants to solder to it anyway.

521
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I don't know if it came up on last week's show,

522
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
because I think the exchange happened before the show.

523
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
But I gave Loki my old 360, the one that broke, for him to try to fix.

524
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I hope it's one that comes out okay.

525
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And I told Loki he could keep it if he fixes it, because I have a new one now.

526
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
So he could use it for his Grand Theft Auto death matches, work, whatever he's going to do with it.

527
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Whatever machine he wants to build, I don't care.

528
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Get rid of it is really what it is.

529
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Literally, people keep giving me 360s.

530
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
They're all, hey, it's broken, I bought another one, here you go.

531
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I'm like, awesome!

532
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I'll tell you what, if you get one working, I'll totally buy a mod chip if you want to get rid of one.

533
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
What do you mean, buy a mod chip?

534
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Like, if you get rid of any of them, then I'll mod it.

535
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Well, it all depends on what firmware some of them are.

536
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I know my sister's console, the one she was using,

537
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
if I could get that fixed, is an old enough firmware where I can run the mod chip on it.

538
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:12,000
The other one's not so sure because we were using those and they were pretty much updated.

539
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So those may not work.

540
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I just have to look at them.

541
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
But there may be one or two of them that might work.

542
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
At least one, I know.

543
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
So that's why I only got one mod chip.

544
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Well, yeah, I'll find.

545
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Alright.

546
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Anyway, my gaming week, I played a lot.

547
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
A lot, a lot of stuff this week, so let me try to run down it really quick.

548
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I played off a listener tip last week.

549
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
It came in on Twitter.

550
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Somebody told me there was this game on the Windows Live,

551
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
the Games for Windows Live that's free if you download it.

552
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Tinker is the name of the game.

553
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And I played it.

554
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And when we brought it up on the show last week,

555
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
we were talking about how the game has achievements

556
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
and we weren't sure how it interfaces with Xbox Live.

557
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Dude, it interfaces really good with Xbox Live.

558
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Those achievements do count towards your gamer score.

559
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It will even come up, like if I look on my recent games on the Xbox 360,

560
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I see Tinker.

561
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I see a card for it with all the achievements.

562
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
And I can look at it just like as any other game on my 360.

563
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I kind of thought that was cool.

564
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And then when I was actually playing the game,

565
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
you could access like an Xbox Live-ish type of interface

566
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
where I could see my friends that were online playing Xbox Live.

567
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And I'm sure if they were looking at me,

568
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
they would see me playing the Tinker game.

569
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
As far as Tinker itself, okay, it's a free game.

570
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And that's pretty much what it's worth.

571
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I mean, it's a puzzle game that's not very different than things we've seen before.

572
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
It kind of takes the scene of like a child's room

573
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
and kind of takes this 3D isometric approach

574
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
to get the robot from point A to B, but you have to use switches.

575
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And there's toy guns and dominoes and dice and things that get in the way.

576
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Eh, it's free. It's worth just playing for a little bit.

577
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Hey, if you're an achievement score whore,

578
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
go download it for like 30 gamerscore pretty easy

579
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
just by beating the tutorial levels.

580
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It's not that hard to do.

581
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
So, you know, it was cute, but I wouldn't have paid a lot of money for it

582
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
because it's a puzzle we've seen before.

583
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And I don't like the 3D thing because in later levels

584
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
they're like, you have to turn the camera around to be able to see everything.

585
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
But when you turn the camera around, it's not very seamless.

586
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
It's just kind of like flips the screen 90 degrees by redeploying.

587
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Like it doesn't actually show the screen rotating like I think we've come to expect.

588
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It just kind of switches the display to, you know, turning it 90 degrees.

589
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
A little bit disappointed with that.

590
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
So, you know, whatever. It's free, so why not?

591
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
But I'm hearing, though, if you kind of run an older OS

592
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
or you might have some problems with a game for Windows Live.

593
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So, there you go.

594
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I spent a little bit of time just playing some various Xbox Live arcade games

595
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
because there were some that I hadn't really played a whole lot of.

596
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Like Sonic 2 and R-Type, a lot of the classically redone ones.

597
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I have to admit, R-Type, when you play it in crazy camera mode

598
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
where it's all like that tilted 3D, it's kind of cool.

599
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Hard to play, but cool.

600
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Isn't, though, just the remixed versions, the HD versions?

601
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I was pretty impressed. Yeah, it's nice.

602
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
But R-Type is still fucking hard.

603
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I forgot to say the other game that we had going on.

604
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
What's that?

605
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Was Raiden 4, and you should give that a try.

606
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It actually was really fun.

607
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I will.

608
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Also, I played quite a bit of Bayonetta on the 360.

609
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Checked out the game this week, and I love it.

610
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It's great. It's over the top. It's excess.

611
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
We were kind of watching the introduction movie,

612
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
just laughing and laughing, because it's so over the top.

613
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
It's so unnecessary, but great.

614
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I can't even explain it.

615
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
The game is a bit of a button masher.

616
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I mean, you just kind of punch, punch, kick, kick, dodge,

617
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
but I don't think it really has to be.

618
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
If you kind of know what you're doing,

619
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
you do have to time your dodges right.

620
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
You do have to perform certain types of moves at certain points,

621
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
but you can kind of get away, especially in the first few levels,

622
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
of doing a bunch of button mashing.

623
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Keep in mind, I'm also playing on normal.

624
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I think the easier modes are kind of brought down to a point

625
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
where you really can just, like, slam on one button,

626
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
and you do all sorts of tricks.

627
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
But in the end, I kind of felt that the game is rewarding,

628
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
and there was a lot more depth to it

629
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
than I was getting the impression from from the demo.

630
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I honestly have to say, this is one of the better games I've played on the 360.

631
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I am having that much fun with it.

632
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
It's fun. It's excess. It's over the top. It's stupid.

633
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It's what a video game should be.

634
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I think it's great, and there's a lot of very tongue-in-cheek humor in it.

635
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
There's references to other Sega games in it.

636
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I love the fact that, and I'm not really spoiling too much,

637
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
because this is in the first two minutes of the game,

638
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
when they're kind of doing the credits,

639
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
all the names of the people are on tombstones,

640
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
and then the director's name came up, right?

641
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Same guy that did, like, Devil May Cry and all that,

642
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
and it opens with somebody peeing on his grave.

643
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Like, what a good, like, tongue-in-cheek, not-taking-yourself-seriously type of thing.

644
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I had a lot of fun with the game, and many lols were had, and I want to play more of it.

645
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
The only really downside is that I didn't notice, like, any type of, like,

646
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
multiplayer or how it really interfaced with live.

647
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I mean, I guess there's leaderboards and stuff, but I had a really good time with it.

648
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
It's very arcade-y.

649
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
If you like arcade games, like, I almost expect I should be putting in a quarter to play this game.

650
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Some of the boss battles are quite epic.

651
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
But, yeah, it's a little bit of a button masher, but a lot of arcade games were.

652
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
So if you like those quarter-munching arcade games, I think you will like this.

653
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
And, um, yeah, actdeft in our chatroom chat that orangehonestradio.com says,

654
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Bayonetta has rings, like Sonic the Hedgehog rings.

655
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
They're called Halos, but yeah, they work just like the Sonic rings, really.

656
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I totally see this as being, like, the diva of the Xbox.

657
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Well, keep in mind it's multiplatform.

658
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
They're on PS3 as well.

659
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
The diva of the game world, then.

660
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
It would be a tragedy if there is no sequel announced to this game.

661
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I really hope they do a sequel in the same vein.

662
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And I'm not even, like, that far into it.

663
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I'm only a couple hours in.

664
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I need to play more.

665
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I just haven't had a lot of time this weekend.

666
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Because I was playing another game, and it's one I don't think I can talk about,

667
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
because there was a non-disclosure agreement, I clicked through really quickly without reading.

668
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I will just say that it's a very popular closed beta that's going on right now for an upcoming PC game.

669
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
But I can't tell you what game it is.

670
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And I would not base my review off a game off a closed beta.

671
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
But I thought that this game, it's a game that there's kind of a lot of hype behind it.

672
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And I, including myself, I've hyped this game up before previously.

673
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I'm not sure the game lived up 100% to the hype.

674
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
But there were certain things about it that I really liked.

675
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And there were certain parts of the game I was kind of like,

676
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Oh, this is slow. Get on with it.

677
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I'm not having any fun right now.

678
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Just kind of, let's get past this part.

679
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Let's blow shit up and move on.

680
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:47,000
So, however, one other thing I want to say about it is that PC games, you know what?

681
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
They really have these demanding system requirements.

682
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I was not able to play this game on my own computer.

683
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And my own computer is only like a year old.

684
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I had to go play it on my boyfriend's computer,

685
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
because he has a better system than I do and a better video card and all that.

686
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And even still, it was a little bit choppy.

687
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
However, I have to remember in a closed beta,

688
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
sometimes these things are sending data to the server all the time.

689
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
It might be running a little bit slow on purpose.

690
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
So I can't, again, base a review off of it.

691
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
But I'm not as excited as I was.

692
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I probably will still pick up the full version just to check it out.

693
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
But at the same time, I still have WoW and all these other games to play

694
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
and all this other stuff.

695
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So, we'll see.

696
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Also, they've got to fix the interface in this particular game I'm thinking of,

697
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
because it's a game where you can chat with other players,

698
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
because that's the type of game it is.

699
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I couldn't stay on top of chat, because the box is so frickin' small,

700
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
like no text fits in it at all.

701
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
So, there you go.

702
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Anyhow, that was my thoughts on that.

703
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
More thoughts on that when the beta is unleashed to the public,

704
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
which is happening next week, which is very good news.

705
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
All right, let's see.

706
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
That's pretty much it for our gaming weeks.

707
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Let's move on to a little bit of housekeeping news.

708
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Okay, live listeners, I have a little bit of bad news, guys.

709
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
We're not going to be live for the next two weeks in our normal time slot,

710
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
and it's really all my fault, and I apologize for that.

711
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Next week is a three-day week for a lot of folks in America,

712
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
because of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.

713
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I'm actually taking a trip to Seattle,

714
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
and I am not flying back till Monday,

715
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
so I won't even be here at all that weekend.

716
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So, we will be taking next week off completely.

717
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
There will be no show next week at all.

718
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
There might be a best of that hits the feed if it's done in time,

719
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
so stay tuned to our podcast feed.

720
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
However, the week after on the 24th, again, I won't be here,

721
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
but that's just because I have Sunday evening plans,

722
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
and I'll admit, because it is a little bit gaming-related, actually,

723
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I'm going to see Utada Hikaru live at one of her shows.

724
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
She's in San Francisco on the 24th,

725
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
and I forgot it was a Sunday when I bought the tickets,

726
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
but what a rare opportunity to see a Japanese superstar in a small venue.

727
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
She's playing the film more, which is not a very big venue at all,

728
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
so I'm going to go see that.

729
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Sorry, I'm not going to apologize for it,

730
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
because I'm really looking forward to it,

731
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
but we're actually going to take kind of a bad situation for the show

732
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
and make it good, because for a long time,

733
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
we've been promising an earlier show for our overseas listeners,

734
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
so what we're going to do on the 24th,

735
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
we're going to tape a show at 10 a.m.,

736
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
which will be 6 o'clock Greenwich time,

737
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
which is in the same time zone as London.

738
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I have to make sure that's okay with all games.

739
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
That's not official yet.

740
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I have to run that by the powers that be at all games.

741
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
However, since there's no other live show on that early,

742
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I don't see it being a problem,

743
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
but I just have to make sure all the sign-offs are approved on that,

744
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
so stay tuned to our Twitter,

745
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
but we are looking at doing the overseas show that Sunday.

746
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Also, if you just want to get up early,

747
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
if you happen to be up at 10 o'clock Pacific,

748
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
or that would only be about 1 in the afternoon Eastern,

749
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
we will be doing a show that week,

750
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
and that will still go to the podcast feed as always,

751
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
so there you go.

752
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Let's see.

753
00:34:49,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Sorry, I apologize for the dead air.

754
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I'm just trying to catch up on everything going on.

755
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
They're talking about the game

756
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
because they all know what I'm talking about,

757
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
but I don't want to say just because.

758
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
There's been previews of it everywhere left and right,

759
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
but it's just one of those things I just would rather not

760
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
without me knowing exactly what I can and can't say.

761
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
It looks like that best of might be ready.

762
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
We just have to get our intros done for it, so we'll see.

763
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Anyway, yes, so no show next week at all.

764
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
It won't be on the podcast feed or anything,

765
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
although there might be a best of,

766
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
which if it's a best of,

767
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
it's not going to be stuff you've heard

768
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
in the past couple weeks.

769
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
It's going to be stuff from the first couple years of OLR.

770
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It's old shit, so to many of you,

771
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
you won't have heard it before,

772
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
so it'll be like a new show.

773
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Then, of course, we'll do the early show,

774
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
10 a.m. Pacific next Sunday pending,

775
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
but that would, of course, be six o'clock Greenwich time

776
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
for those of you overseas,

777
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
so those of you who should be excited about that

778
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
because we've been promising that for quite a while.

779
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
All right, that's it for housekeeping.

780
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Of course, twitter.com slash OLR,

781
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
facebook.com slash OrangeLawnsRadio join us there.

782
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Let's get into some gaming news.

783
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Loki, what was some of the big news this week?

784
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Well, there's lots of stuff this week.

785
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
We're going to start things off talking a little bit

786
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
about Microsoft's Game Room,

787
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
and basically, I don't know if you would call this

788
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
their answer to home.

789
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I don't really know if it's that.

790
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
You may remember a while back,

791
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
we talked about a survey that went out

792
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
that kind of talked about a place where you'd be able

793
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
to walk your avatars around and play arcade games.

794
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Well, that's what this is.

795
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
They're going to have a bunch of different arcade games.

796
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Some of the stuff they showed off

797
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,000
were, I know that there was different Atari 2600 games on there.

798
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,000
They had other things including like, you know, Centipede.

799
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I'm trying to remember the other games that were on there

800
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
that were pretty cool.

801
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
But basically, they have all these...

802
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
There's some television stuff too.

803
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Yeah, television.

804
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
There's some Konami games on there.

805
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
You know, all sorts of fun stuff.

806
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Here we go.

807
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Asteroids, Atari Football, Lunar Lander,

808
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Millipede, Outlaw, Pitfall, Red Baron, Road Fighter,

809
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Scramble, Tempest, all that kind of stuff that you would...

810
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Say I picked up at least two games there

811
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
that I've already bought on Xbox Live before.

812
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Scramble and Tempest.

813
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
So what's going to be unique about this is

814
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
you're going to be able to get your own gaming space

815
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
basically in these areas.

816
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
You'll be able to customize little rooms

817
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
with a different theme,

818
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
what games you want in there,

819
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
what other wall ornaments and whatnot

820
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
you want to stick in there.

821
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Then they're also going to have games for purchase.

822
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Since this is going to be available on Xbox 360 and on PC,

823
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
they're going to have different things you can do.

824
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
For example, you can purchase a game for 400 Microsoft points

825
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
or $5 that will basically license the game

826
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
for unlimited play on Xbox 360 and PC.

827
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
If you don't want to pay that,

828
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
you can spend $3 or 240 Microsoft points

829
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
and get you a virtual arcade cabinet on one platform

830
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
at either Xbox 360 or PC,

831
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
probably the option I'll be going with.

832
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And then also for people that want to just spend lots of money

833
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
or just... I don't really know why you'd do this,

834
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
but for the old retro type of 40 Microsoft points or 50 cents

835
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
will allow you to get you two quarters worth of playtime

836
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
on select titles for the authentic arcade experience, they call it.

837
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And the game room itself is actually being developed

838
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
by the third-party studio Chrome Studios,

839
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
who are behind Viva Pinata Party Animals,

840
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Star Wars Republic Heroes, among many other things.

841
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
They're planning on starting the service with 30 original arcade titles

842
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
with 1,000 planned for the next three years.

843
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And also they're going to be available from a variety of publishers,

844
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
including Atari, Activision, and television.

845
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
And Konami.

846
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And apparently there's some more studios involved with it as well.

847
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
They're going to have...

848
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
They're going to be presented in 1080p,

849
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
which I don't know why you'd do that, because they're old retro games.

850
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Big fucking deal, yeah.

851
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
They're going to have support for...

852
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Well, they'll look sharp.

853
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I mean, let's face it, if you hook up those old systems to the TV,

854
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
the TVs now are not... I mean, if you even can,

855
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
TVs now can't... some of those systems can't even hook up to them.

856
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
You know, they'll look sharp, that's for sure.

857
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Yeah. They'll support multiplayer for up to two players,

858
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
as well as cross-platform leaderboards and achievements.

859
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
And apparently that's launching this spring, so relatively soon.

860
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And the thing, though, about it, though,

861
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
is you can't freely walk around the game room like you can with home.

862
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
It's basically your avatars are just there.

863
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
At least when they're showing it off,

864
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
they don't have the collision detection and everything done yet.

865
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
So I don't know if you're going to be able to walk around just aimlessly and stuff,

866
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
but right now you kind of switch from room to room,

867
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
and there's different arcade games you can play.

868
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
The thing I don't like about this is if I have to purchase the games

869
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I've already purchased before again,

870
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
because now it's going to have these other features.

871
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I think if you have... you know, say you bought Frogger or something like that,

872
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
you know, on Xbox Live Arcade,

873
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
you should be able to have your Frogger arcade cabinet in the game.

874
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
It's probably not going to work that way, but hey, probably not.

875
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
You know, and it's... at least it's only three bucks.

876
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
That's not too bad.

877
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
What do you think about the whole fact that you can play it on your PC, though,

878
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
if you pay five bucks?

879
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Or I guess you get, what, three dollars for one platform,

880
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
five dollars for both platforms?

881
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
You know, PC for me, it's really a hard sale

882
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
because I have a MAME cabinet,

883
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
and sadly enough, you know, MAME ROMs are really easy to find,

884
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
and especially stuff that old can run on anything.

885
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I mean, anything.

886
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
A crappy netbook, a crappy PC from like eight years ago

887
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
will still run, you know, those ROMs just fine.

888
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
But no EP in this competition if you do it that way

889
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
because the whole leaderboards, medals, and all this stuff, right?

890
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

891
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
But, see, I don't know if I'm really going to be into this

892
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
because, like I said, I have MAME,

893
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
so why should I spend the money on this?

894
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I mean, yeah, I get achievement points, but, you know,

895
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I kind of got over the whole achievement point whoring stuff

896
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
because it's just, you know, the cost to buy games and stuff

897
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
just to get achievement points, it's just, it's not worth it.

898
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Well, this is their way of legitimizing MAME, really.

899
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I mean, they're trying to, you know,

900
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
MAME is still not legal, folks. You're not supposed to have it.

901
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Well, let me put it this way, okay?

902
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Here's one way at least they'll have a step up above home.

903
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
There's not going to be fucking lines for games.

904
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I don't have to like, you know, walk up to an arcade machine and go,

905
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I'm sorry, you can't play this game right now because there's other people playing it.

906
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,000
That's retarded when it comes to, you know, an online network like that.

907
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I mean, come on, you're launching a program.

908
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I understand that, you know, there's a fictional arcade game here,

909
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
but, dude, what the hell?

910
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Why should I have to wait to play a game?

911
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
You know, Microsoft, well, let me ask Dark Soccer

912
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
because I know she's a classic gaming enthusiast.

913
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
What do you think about this whole game room thing?

914
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I like it. I mean, it'd be great to have on Xbox

915
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
because I do go back and play old stuff.

916
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I don't think I would necessarily do it as much on PC.

917
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I mean, I think it's nice, especially for people who were into, you know,

918
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
the classic gaming, like, what was that rental thing that you did, GameTap?

919
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Yeah, GameTap, yeah.

920
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
You know, and I've pulled a few stuff off of Steam, like I play Loom,

921
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
but that's really it.

922
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I wonder if we'll see any, like, new controllers and stuff.

923
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Like, for one, they need to fix a D-pad.

924
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I mean, they've needed to fix a D-pad since day one.

925
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
But two, it'd be kind of neat to see, like, a trackball or something like that

926
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
that's kind of hooked up to the analog or something

927
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
where you could, you know, do some of the games.

928
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Like, I know they had Crystal Castles on there.

929
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
That's one of their launch games, yeah.

930
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
And see, the other thing, too, is that I have a lot of these games

931
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
on the classic systems, and I do have the right controllers for them.

932
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And I admit it, not everyone's going to have everything,

933
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
that everyone's, you know, got the vault or has been as nuts as Dan

934
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
and I have been about collecting the stuff.

935
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,000
But me personally, I don't have a legitimate need to do the extra spending on it.

936
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I don't.

937
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
And the other thing I think also, too, that people have been complaining about

938
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
is, like, why should I pay $3 a game for these old Atari games

939
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
when I could just get a flashback for, like, 20 bucks

940
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
and it's got, like, 40 games on there?

941
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
There's also the community feature, I think, that has to be pointed out

942
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
is the fact that, you know, you set up your game room

943
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
so that your friends can come kind of to your game room and play the games.

944
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
They haven't said, do they get to play them for free

945
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
or do they still have to pay, like, the quarters or what's the deal?

946
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Or are they playing demos?

947
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Yeah, are they doing demos? What's the deal?

948
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I mean, they haven't really given us the details there,

949
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
but there certainly is that whole idea of building up a collection,

950
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
which is your game room, and kind of checking out what other people have.

951
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
And with a thousand planned games, I mean, there's certainly going to be that element of,

952
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
oh, you have never played this game before?

953
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Come to my game room and look at it real quick.

954
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
You know what they need to do, and this will be hilarious,

955
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
is have these trophies that you can earn or whatever achievements

956
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
with, like, little trophies that you can earn for your game room,

957
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
and have it so you can display your trophies,

958
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
and be home to the whole trophy display.

959
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Well, I want to get back to that point in a minute,

960
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
but let me go to this real quick in our chat room, chat.orangetonstrategy.com.

961
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Tigerclaw in our chat says, why not have it so you can view the game as a spectator?

962
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Think of it like this.

963
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
You're at the arcade and there's a bunch of people playing the same game that you want to play.

964
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
You look over their shoulders and watch the person in front play that game.

965
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
And GS68 says, yeah, watching someone kick ass at so-and-so game in person

966
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
is better than watching a video on YouTube.

967
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Imagine if you could go into game room and watch somebody try to do a big Donkey Kong score.

968
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Well, obviously, that wouldn't be one of the games, because it's a Nintendo game.

969
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
But, you know, hypothetically, do one of these games, you know, and try to go for a huge high score,

970
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
which, by the way, should also be pointed out in that game room.

971
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
There are certain games they're never going to have,

972
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
because, like, Nintendo did some of those old arcade games,

973
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
and, you know, there's just other publishers that probably are never going to let Microsoft have their stuff.

974
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
But they have a pretty good collection, I think, so far.

975
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I think there's still a lot to be determined, although we are getting some details.

976
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
You know, one of these videos, one of the guys that was hawking the game room says

977
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
that the noises you hear in the background of the arcade

978
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
is dynamically generated based on the games that are in your game room.

979
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,000
So if you have joust, you'll hear joust noises as part of that.

980
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Well, you know, actually, that idea was used in something else that Dan showed me before.

981
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And I don't want to, I know it wasn't related to me in particular,

982
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
but there's this guy who did a CG arcade.

983
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And actually had gone around and recorded the games in action,

984
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
as well as the games, like their splash screens and that type of thing, the tracked modes,

985
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
and then had them running so that as you moved through the CG version of this arcade,

986
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
you were hearing things as you passed along, you know.

987
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
So I think that's going to be great. I'm really going to like that.

988
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Of course, I think that you should also have the option of turning them off.

989
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
You know, because sometimes...

990
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
You might. We don't know. Usually they're not going to advertise,

991
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
but you can turn this off. They don't really demo that, you know.

992
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
But, I mean, but back to it, I think that that's a nice touch.

993
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Some comments from our chatroom.

994
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
MacDeaf says, Sky, you can play a game in the game room like a real arcade

995
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
for 40 Microsoft points for one game.

996
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I heard it was two games for four, because it's two quarters, but I don't know.

997
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I mean, we'll see the specifics soon.

998
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
But, yeah, I mean, there's two different pricing methodologies.

999
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
If you think, oh, this is a game I'm only going to play once,

1000
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
you can only spend 40 Microsoft points, play it once, and that's it.

1001
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I find that interesting pricing mechanic to be an interesting kind of change about this.

1002
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,000
SJ100Matt says, can we put a Microsoft space buck token on machines to play next?

1003
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I don't think you're going to have the line there.

1004
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
It's going to be your own thing.

1005
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Here's my honest thought about game room,

1006
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
and I've kind of been processing this all week, because, you know,

1007
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
as a classic gaming enthusiast, I am a little bit excited about game room.

1008
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Yes, I could do all this stuff on Mania, but I really like the community ideas,

1009
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
and I have friends that are going to be really into this,

1010
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
and I see myself having competitions for high scores on certain games in game room.

1011
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I see this happening.

1012
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
But here's the interesting thing about it.

1013
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
We've said this a lot on Orange Andrea.

1014
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
One thing Microsoft does very well, because we've watched them kind of grow.

1015
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
When we first started this show, I think the Xbox was just coming out.

1016
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
It was 2002.

1017
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Microsoft has become very good at taking other people's ideas and making them better.

1018
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
It's part of their business.

1019
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
And the interesting thing about game room, guys, think about it.

1020
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
This is not only a rip-off of Nintendo.

1021
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Well, I shouldn't say rip-off.

1022
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
It's not only inspired by Nintendo.

1023
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
It's inspired by Sony.

1024
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Dude, this is Virtual Console and home.

1025
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
This is Microsoft's way of one-upping both of those.

1026
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
What has everybody been asking for for Virtual Console?

1027
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I should be able to play it online with my friends in, like, a two-player mode.

1028
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Guess what? You can do that with game room.

1029
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I think the games in Virtual Console should have some HD effects

1030
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
and should have leaderboards in them

1031
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
and should have achievements in them.

1032
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Guess what? Game room is going to do that for these games.

1033
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I think home should have a fucking point to it.

1034
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
That I load up my games seamlessly through the home interface.

1035
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Or that if I earn things in games, I'll be able to show it off.

1036
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Guess what? Game room is going to do that.

1037
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Game room has kind of taken all these ideas that the community wanted from Virtual Console

1038
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
and the things that community wanted from home

1039
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
and put it into this game room.

1040
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I think it's kind of interesting.

1041
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Now, I don't think game room is as close to home

1042
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
because I still think there's other stuff that Sony Home kind of will do and does

1043
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
that's much different than game room.

1044
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
But I think game room is what we all thought home would be, in a way.

1045
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Even though, yes, it's very important to point out,

1046
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
you're not going to be able to walk very fluidly through it.

1047
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
No, so far. That was just being what they were showing off at CES, they said,

1048
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
because they don't have the collision detection stuff worked out yet.

1049
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
This thing is coming up out in the spring.

1050
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I don't see it suddenly...

1051
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Well, spring for Microsoft is anywhere between, you know...

1052
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
It could be May, yeah.

1053
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,000
It's basically, you know, April and May, so who knows?

1054
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Yeah, SSG100Matt says,

1055
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Simpsons in X-Men Arcade!

1056
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I know you might be kind of messing around,

1057
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
but dude, imagine it if X-Men Arcade did show up in game room

1058
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
and you could play it online with six people.

1059
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I mean, that's going to be huge if that happens.

1060
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I mean, the Ninja Turtle games are pretty popular, right?

1061
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
The Ninja Turtle arcade game was one of Microsoft's best sellers.

1062
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Tons of people were playing that online, probably still are.

1063
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Black Wolf says, he's going so far as to say it'll come out during E3.

1064
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Possibly.

1065
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Or like, Daytona.

1066
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
The racing controller and stuff, that'd be awesome.

1067
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Alright, so anyway, I guess more to see on game room,

1068
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
but I'm excited at the possibilities.

1069
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Dude, as a classic gaming enthusiast,

1070
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I don't mind that they're trying to legitimize MAME

1071
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
and give us a reason to pay for it.

1072
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
And I would not buy every game, hell no.

1073
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
But there are some games I remember quite fondly that,

1074
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
yeah, I might drop five bucks to play them on my PC.

1075
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Because when you say play it on my PC, I think,

1076
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
ooh, my laptop and everywhere it goes with me

1077
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
that I have an internet connection, which is when I travel.

1078
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
That will be kind of cool to have on the road.

1079
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
And compete in the leaderboards and the medals and all that,

1080
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
and that's something I can't really do in MAME.

1081
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
So it's not that much.

1082
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Five bucks is not that much.

1083
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
So, anyhow, we'll see what happens.

1084
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Moving on to another classic game, getting a redo.

1085
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Mega Man 10 is on its way.

1086
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
And Mega Man 10, of course, they've been trying to keep

1087
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
the eight robot master names a secret, but guess what?

1088
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
The game is playable on the CES floor.

1089
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Well, I guess not on the floor, but maybe by appointment.

1090
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Either way, the game is showing at CES.

1091
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
And although they are asking journalists not to name the bosses

1092
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
and not to show video of it, I guess there was a German video

1093
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
that showed up that it accidentally snuck in there.

1094
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Probably they didn't intend to do it,

1095
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
but you know the bright-eyed fans found it.

1096
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
And now the names of the boss monsters in Mega Man 10 have shown up.

1097
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
So, of course, you already knew about Sheep Man,

1098
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
which I thought was kind of funny,

1099
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
but you will also be able to fight Blade Man, Solar Man,

1100
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Chill Man, Commando Man, Nitro Man, Strike Man, and Pump Man.

1101
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
And when I hear Pump Man, I'm sorry, I think about the shoes, the pumps.

1102
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
No female characters, then?

1103
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Not yet, but keep in mind that's only eight, right?

1104
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
That's eight. Well, no, I guess there's only eight on the screen,

1105
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
because I'm thinking nine.

1106
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
So, no, it doesn't look like there's going to be a woman in this one,

1107
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
although anything can happen.

1108
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Maybe Dr. Wily is now, you know, to check.

1109
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Who knows? Anything is possible.

1110
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
No, I guess that's interesting.

1111
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Yeah, we had Splash Woman last time, which was the first female boss ever,

1112
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
and now no women this time, it sounds like.

1113
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
But I just like Pump Man. I'm sorry, it makes me think of the shoes.

1114
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
It cracks me up.

1115
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I wonder if that's like a Dig Dug Pump Man or what the deal is there.

1116
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
And Bobby Black Wolf says,

1117
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Commando Man, he fights you with no underwear?

1118
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I don't know if that's quite what they're going for with it,

1119
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
but you never know.

1120
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
And, like, literally four people all at once in chat are like,

1121
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Pump Man? Question mark.

1122
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
At least he's not Pump It Up Man.

1123
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
And Lord Moon asks, what's he pumping?

1124
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
That's a good question.

1125
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I'm imagining it's like a Dig Dug boss.

1126
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I really don't know.

1127
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Like, uh, we are here to pump you up.

1128
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I don't know.

1129
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
He fires steroid needles at you.

1130
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
All right, anyhow, Dr. Sakura, what else is going on in gaming?

1131
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Well, the Greenpeace report came out.

1132
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
You know how much stock I put in a lot of these.

1133
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Are those the people that tie themselves to boats and stuff?

1134
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Yes.

1135
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
So fun.

1136
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,000
But they have highlighted Nintendo as the most environmentally unfriendly

1137
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
of electronic companies.

1138
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
They put out Greenpeace's Guide to Green Electronics,

1139
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:52,000
and it scored 1.4 out of 10 for its chemical and energy and waste policies,

1140
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
and was the lowest of all the ones that were done out of 18.

1141
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
They had a zero on e-waste,

1142
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
because they didn't reduce greenhouse gas emissions,

1143
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,000
even though they promised that there's greenhouse gas emissions from a Wii.

1144
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I never knew my Wii was slowly put away.

1145
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Maybe it's manufacturing the Wii is what they're talking about.

1146
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:21,000
It did get some points for having PVC-free internal wiring.

1147
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
It's been monitoring other harmful chemicals,

1148
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,000
but it hasn't completely eliminated the use of PVC.

1149
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:36,000
It also got some points for the DSiec adapter and for disclosing CO2 emissions.

1150
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
But yeah, it still got bad.

1151
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Microsoft got 2.4 points, so it was actually just above Nintendo.

1152
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:48,000
And of the major three, Sony was the most green,

1153
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
and seventh place with a score of 5.1.

1154
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Honestly, really the tops of the ones were Nokia,

1155
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Sony, Ericsson, Toshiba, and Apple got a big special mention

1156
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
for completely eliminating chemicals from the computer systems.

1157
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Honestly, I really don't care for Greenpeace as a facility all that much,

1158
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:19,000
because of some inaccuracies in their own.

1159
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I'm not going to get on the sociopolitical platform right now.

1160
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,000
People know there's a lot of stuff that I've said,

1161
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
because they're just not accurate.

1162
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
They try to put the spin on it for their own thing,

1163
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
but I'm not going to go into that.

1164
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I do, however, think that it's just pretty interesting

1165
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
seeing where I think the concern is going.

1166
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I'm all for being more green and environmentally friendly and all that,

1167
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
solar power, wind power, et cetera, et cetera.

1168
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I do think one thing to study to show is that even though,

1169
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
if I remember right, I saw the chart,

1170
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Microsoft is by no means a green-friendly company,

1171
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
but they're higher up on the scale than Nintendo.

1172
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
If they can make some cutbacks, I think, why can't Nintendo?

1173
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
That's kind of like my thing is that they're both in the same business.

1174
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
If Sony does really good, what changes?

1175
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I don't know the technical side of things so well,

1176
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
but what are they doing in the manufacturing

1177
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
that Nintendo and Microsoft can't do?

1178
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
What can't they do?

1179
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I'm not going to go all hippie on you,

1180
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:27,000
but I'm all for looking for ways to be cost-effective yet green.

1181
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Well, to be perfectly honest,

1182
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I think people have gone way too overboard with the whole green thing

1183
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
because really I think a lot of it is probably going to get me some booze.

1184
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I really think a lot of it has to do with more ways to make money

1185
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:44,000
and more marketing, more ways of...

1186
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I don't want to do the conspiracy thing

1187
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
and say that it's them trying to control the way we think.

1188
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
You know what I mean?

1189
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
But I think that it is a degree of social conditioning.

1190
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
What's interesting, and I don't want to go too far with this

1191
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
because it's not about games,

1192
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
but a lot of people buy their video games there.

1193
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I will say this.

1194
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I heard a story on the news this week that Walmart in our area,

1195
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Sacramento, at three test stores have eliminated plastic bags altogether.

1196
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
And if you either bring your own bag

1197
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
or they will sell you the blue reusable bags for 15 cents.

1198
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
And this is in their efforts to cut back on the plastic waste.

1199
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
And I think in theory it sounds like a good idea.

1200
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
But I know me.

1201
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I don't usually plan my trips to Walmart that well.

1202
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
It's more of a spur of the moment if I ever actually go to Walmart.

1203
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I don't usually shop at Walmart.

1204
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I usually go to Target.

1205
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
But if it's happening at Walmart, it might happen at Target.

1206
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
So I have to kind of think in those terms.

1207
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I would have a collection of those 15-cent bags

1208
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
piled up to the ceiling in my house

1209
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
because I would never remember to take them

1210
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
and I would end up throwing them away and shit.

1211
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
You know what I mean?

1212
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Look at your feet.

1213
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
I know. You've got a couple of them there.

1214
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
But those I always empty out.

1215
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
And I actually keep three or four of them in my car at any given point in time.

1216
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
So I actually do use them.

1217
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,000
But honestly because I don't like throwing out the trash that often.

1218
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Really.

1219
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I think Dan do it.

1220
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I call bullshit on the whole Walmart thing.

1221
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
And the reason why is because they're just looking for a way to make money.

1222
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Look at it.

1223
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
They buy all these plastic bags

1224
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
that they're going to have to give away for free at their store.

1225
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Look at it.

1226
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Now we can say that we're being green

1227
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
and we can sell you bags to carry your crap home in.

1228
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
IKEA makes you buy bags.

1229
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
The grocery store, they do the reverse.

1230
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
If you bring your own bag, they take off five cents.

1231
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Also, IKEA is like a pompous store too.

1232
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
You know, fucking all high and mighty.

1233
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Smelling their own farts as South Park could put it.

1234
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Seriously, I mean, they have a bunch of shit there that's way too damn expensive.

1235
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Lord Moon in our chat says,

1236
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Just remember they're in your car.

1237
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Just remember they're in your car.

1238
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
You know, in theory, that's a really good idea,

1239
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
but yet I still see myself failing.

1240
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Here's what I'm going to do instead.

1241
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I'm not going to go shop at Walmart.

1242
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
At least not that Walmart.

1243
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
They're testing it.

1244
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
They're testing it.

1245
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
It's not in place yet.

1246
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
They're testing it at three stores here.

1247
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Yeah, I know.

1248
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
What I do with a lot of those bags too,

1249
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
and this is something I've started doing about,

1250
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
let's say, three semesters ago,

1251
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
is when I take different classes,

1252
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I actually have my books and my supplies for different classes

1253
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
in the different bags,

1254
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
because I don't always take the same classes every day.

1255
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I mean, I'm going to have overlap this semester,

1256
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
but when they're all in my car,

1257
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I just grab the bag I need and go,

1258
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
and I don't have to worry about changing out my books or anything.

1259
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I actually reuse the plastic bags.

1260
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I'll take my lunches to work,

1261
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
and I don't have a fancy thermos or nothing.

1262
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I don't need all that fancy shit.

1263
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I put it in a plastic bag and take it to work.

1264
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Or even if I'm taking bathroom supplies on a trip with me for travel,

1265
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I'll put it in a plastic bag.

1266
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
It's stuff for the bathroom.

1267
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
It doesn't need to be in a fancy plush case.

1268
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
The other thing I use plastic bags for is when I dye my hair,

1269
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
because I tend to splash everywhere.

1270
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
A lot of people line the kitty liner with it.

1271
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Well, I get cat bag liners

1272
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
because Jeremy has a big box for his stinky ass.

1273
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,000
But I actually line my sink with plastic bags

1274
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
so that I don't stain the sink,

1275
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
since this technically isn't really our house.

1276
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I wanted to go back and read some of the comments on Mega Man 10

1277
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
because there was some funny stuff in chat,

1278
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
and I think Bochi Kawa hit the nail on the head earlier in our chatroom,

1279
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
chat.orangehatcherday.com.

1280
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I think pump means like water pump,

1281
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
and that's actually not a bad guess

1282
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
because usually there's some type of water boss in the game,

1283
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
and that's probably the one that's good.

1284
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I like Tiger Claw's comment too.

1285
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Pump could mean the first robot could be muscle bound.

1286
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
At least they didn't call him Plump Man.

1287
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
GS68 says,

1288
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
If there ever is a final Mega Man game,

1289
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
the last boss should simply be called The Man.

1290
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
LOL, last Mega Man game.

1291
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
You're funny.

1292
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Jay Dizzle commenting on this story says,

1293
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
They have to disclose CO2 emissions,

1294
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
so I can't fart without telling my supervisor.

1295
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Those comments from chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

1296
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
One other thing, and I do have to bring this up.

1297
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:50,000
We actually do need a certain degree of CO2 in the air

1298
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
for environmental balance,

1299
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
and I think that people tend to take it a little bit too far.

1300
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I mean, I understand.

1301
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Yeah, we need to cut back on stuff.

1302
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
There's certain things that are going on environmentally

1303
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
that, yeah, we do have to be more mindful of,

1304
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
but I really do think that people are taking it way too far.

1305
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
They're reading more into things

1306
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
and making, certainly, a catastrophe out of something that really isn't.

1307
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
You know?

1308
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Alright.

1309
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
We've got more gaming news

1310
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
and then our Classic Game of the Week before too long here.

1311
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Logie?

1312
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Yeah.

1313
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Well, if you have some EA games that are a tad bit old and dusty,

1314
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
you may not be able to play those online soon enough

1315
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,000
because they are going to be shutting down some of their older game servers.

1316
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
And some of the games that they have,

1317
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:38,000
actually, some of the games on the list aren't too old.

1318
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,000
For example, Facebreaker, which came out about a year ago,

1319
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
is being shut down.

1320
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Some other ones on the list,

1321
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Madden 08 and Madden 09.

1322
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
08 is being shut down.

1323
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:59,000
These are on February 2nd on the Wii and PC, and 09 on Xbox, the original Xbox,

1324
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Wii and on PSP.

1325
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Also, some other older sports games,

1326
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:13,000
March Madness 07, NBA Live 07, 08, 09,

1327
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
at least on the Wii, and that's in Europe only,

1328
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
NCAA Football, NASCAR.

1329
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:25,000
NASCAR 09 I've come surprised on because they actually don't have a new NASCAR game,

1330
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
so that's interesting.

1331
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:33,000
That is only on PS2, PS3, and Xbox 360, though, in Europe only.

1332
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Let's see, and then of course they're going to be doing some more April 1st,

1333
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:45,000
and that's going to be the rest of Madden NFL 07, Madden NFL 08,

1334
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
which, I mean, come on.

1335
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Madden NFL 07, that's from 06, so that's a good four years old,

1336
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
almost four years old by the time that they shut it down.

1337
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I mean, on the original Xbox.

1338
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I don't know. I'm not too surprised, but maybe some people are.

1339
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
But hell, buy Madden 09 or something.

1340
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I'm sure it's dirt cheap by now.

1341
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,000
And a few Tyler Woods games also.

1342
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
It's always kind of sad when they shut servers down,

1343
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
but at the same time, you know, I get it with the sports games.

1344
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Most of those folks upgrade. They're just not cost effective to run.

1345
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
You know what I mean?

1346
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Yes. Another game also, not exactly an EA game,

1347
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
that's also having their server shut down.

1348
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:37,000
In fact, actually shutting down, I don't know if it's already happened already,

1349
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
but ChromeHounds, apparently, the server shut down.

1350
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Yeah, I can see why. That game really got boring really fast.

1351
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:51,000
And apparently, this happened way back.

1352
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Oh, apparently this week is when it actually shut down.

1353
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Apparently, they announced the shutdown back in August,

1354
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
but they finally shut the servers off this week.

1355
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
So, that's too bad.

1356
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
But, eh, we have a farm in core now.

1357
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,000
And we're going to be having, soon enough, the new front mission game,

1358
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,000
which is going to be all sorts of awesome.

1359
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Bobby in chat, because you might remember Bobby was talking about

1360
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
ChromeHounds a lot when that game first came out.

1361
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
He said, ChromeHounds shut down last week.

1362
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:28,000
All my friends did one last hurrah last weekend. I wasn't home.

1363
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Well, it's always sad when the games that you like, their servers shut down.

1364
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Like, I remember when the Amplitude servers shut down.

1365
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
I had a cry, but, you know, some of the games were just old.

1366
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I wonder if ChromeHounds was System Link as well,

1367
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
because that might not be so bad.

1368
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
At least you could do, like, LAN or something like that.

1369
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
They don't really have a lot of System Link games anymore, anyways.

1370
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
But, I wonder if that was one of them that was.

1371
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Well, that's probably kind of a pain in the ass to do, too,

1372
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
the whole System Link thing, you know?

1373
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Well, there's people that like doing LAN stuff, and I mean, yeah,

1374
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,000
it may be a pain in the ass, but, I don't know.

1375
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
That'd be kind of neat, though, if it was System Link.

1376
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:11,000
And... it's not. Bummer.

1377
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
All right, some more news for you guys,

1378
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,000
and this has to do with another thing getting shut down,

1379
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,000
but not quite an actually authorized video game.

1380
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
No, Nintendo has put the smackdown on a fan film

1381
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
that was being made for quite some time, actually.

1382
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I guess this film had been taken, like, four years to make,

1383
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
but considering there's a bunch of people that did it in their free time,

1384
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
the Zelda movie was called The Hero of Time,

1385
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
and they actually put it out on the internet.

1386
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I got some mixed reviews, but, you know, I mean, it was a fan thing.

1387
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I wouldn't expect anything that's, like, you know, Hollywood caliber stuff.

1388
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
You know, folks were at least kind of appreciative that the movie,

1389
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I guess, had been made, but not Nintendo,

1390
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
because the movie's official site on New Year's Day, actually,

1391
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
so this is a little bit over a week old,

1392
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
but the community site actually had to take the movie down

1393
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
because the studio came to an agreement with Nintendo.

1394
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
They actually say, quote,

1395
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
We understand Nintendo's right to protect its characters and trademarks,

1396
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
and understand how in order to keep their property unspoiled

1397
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
by fan interpretations of the franchise,

1398
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Nintendo needs to protect itself, even from fan works with good intentions.

1399
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I'm sure our next project will be right around the corner.

1400
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
No, it's not Majora's Mask.

1401
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
So, yeah, they won't be making a movie out of that.

1402
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
You know, although you might go,

1403
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Nintendo's the big bad guy coming around kind of shutting off all these fan projects,

1404
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I get why they had to do it,

1405
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,000
because unfortunately not everyone might think that this is an unauthorized movie,

1406
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000
because think about how, like, you know, that whole game of telephone works,

1407
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
especially so on the internet.

1408
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
One thing gets passed along to another person.

1409
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Somebody's going to say, hey, dude, have you seen the Zelda movie?

1410
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Let me hand this to you.

1411
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
This is the fucking Legend of Zelda movie, and then it's not good.

1412
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:03,000
And if they don't protect their actual trademarks, then they will no longer have, you know, those trademarks, basically,

1413
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:09,000
because if, you know, they become unprotected, then, you know, anybody can rip that stuff off.

1414
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:14,000
The other thing, though, to kind of go with that, though, is it's already on YouTube, of course, in parts.

1415
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
The thing is, once they hit the internet, though, that's the other side of it,

1416
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
is that once something hits the internet, it's done.

1417
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I mean, there's no, like, it's not like you can say,

1418
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
oh, well, now nobody will ever see this.

1419
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Nope, once it hits the internet, it's done.

1420
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Everybody has it if they want to know where to go look.

1421
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
And, yeah, it's on YouTube.

1422
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Tigerclaw just linked us to it in our chat room.

1423
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
And you can actually see we're playing, like, just a little clip here.

1424
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
And I watched the first few clips.

1425
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
In the studio.

1426
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
And it's kind of boring.

1427
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Is it?

1428
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Let's just look at it a little bit here.

1429
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I don't know, some chick's crying in the forest.

1430
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I don't know if that's Zelda.

1431
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Maybe that's supposed to be, like, Link when he's born or something.

1432
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I mean, it looks like something that would have been on TV in the 1980s.

1433
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I was going to say, it has, like, the same kind of production quality

1434
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
as, like, the Highlander.

1435
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
It looks like Beauty and the Beast to me.

1436
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Yeah.

1437
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Do you remember that old-ass show, Beauty and the Beast,

1438
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
with what's-her-name that went on to be in the Terminator?

1439
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Linda Hamilton.

1440
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
That's it, Linda Hamilton.

1441
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Dude, I love that show, by the way.

1442
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Anyhow, sorry.

1443
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I guess that was a little prologue there.

1444
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Yeah, it's all over YouTube, so take a look if you want.

1445
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Anyway, release date's coming up after another story from Dark Sakura.

1446
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Dropping stuff everywhere.

1447
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
She doesn't drop all her stuff everywhere.

1448
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
You all right?

1449
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Can you continue?

1450
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Is this a workman's comp issue?

1451
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
All right.

1452
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
There are four letters I'd like to say to you.

1453
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Hello?

1454
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Oh, wait, no, too many.

1455
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
S-T-F-U.

1456
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
And that's with all the love in my heart.

1457
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Well, EA actually has hired somebody, so not everyone's losing their job.

1458
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
They hired Mark Tramiel.

1459
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
You know what Mark Tramiel gave us?

1460
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
NBA Jam.

1461
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Boom Shakalaka.

1462
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:13,000
So basically, since they're trying to revive NBA Jam for Wii,

1463
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
why not hire the guy who made it?

1464
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I think that's a good idea.

1465
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
So maybe we'll see what happens.

1466
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
I'm all for an NBA Jam revival.

1467
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
That was a fun game back in the arcades.

1468
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I always thought it was the kind of thing that would come to Xbox Live Arcade or PSN,

1469
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
but okay, the Wii.

1470
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I guess I can accept that, depending on what they do with it,

1471
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:42,000
as long as they don't make it over the top with the motion control and all that stuff.

1472
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
I don't know.

1473
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I guess we'll see.

1474
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
You can still play as Bill Clinton.

1475
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Or, you know, Liu Kang.

1476
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates of some upcoming video games.

1477
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,000
NBA Jam I don't think is one of them yet, but I bet you that's an E3 title.

1478
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
That's something we'll see at E3. We'll see.

1479
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Yep.

1480
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Well, this week we actually have some decent stuff coming out,

1481
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
starting off with Army of Two, the 40th day,

1482
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:15,000
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and on PSP.

1483
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
The PSP one, though, is supposed to be more like Contra, so that's kind of cool.

1484
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Vancouver 2010, the official video game of the Olympic Winter Games.

1485
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
That's a long-ass title.

1486
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Coming out on Xbox 360 and also on PS3 as well.

1487
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Skycrawler's Innocent Aces on the Wii, coming from Exceed.

1488
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:39,000
We've got a Sims 2 kind of re-release collection.

1489
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:45,000
The Sims 2 Fun with Pets collection, which includes three of the expansions.

1490
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
You said Sims 2 Fun with Pets?

1491
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Sims 2 Fun with Pets.

1492
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Even though Sims 3 is out now.

1493
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
It's just a compilation.

1494
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Can you torture the pets in the same way that you torture humans?

1495
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Well, it's got Sims 2 Pets and Sims 2 Family Fun and Sims 2...

1496
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Not that I would ever do that.

1497
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I want Pets and Sims 3. I'm waiting for it.

1498
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
I want to present all sides of the issue.

1499
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Yeah, it's the Sims 2 Pets, Sims 2 H&M Family Fun stuff, and Sims 2 Mansion and Garden stuff.

1500
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
So you can get that.

1501
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
There's actually another Sims 3 expansion coming in March.

1502
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
I don't remember what it's called, though, unfortunately.

1503
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Daniel X coming out on the DS.

1504
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Which I think that's based off a movie or TV show, I can't remember.

1505
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Twin Sector on the PC.

1506
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Sands of Destruction coming out from Sega.

1507
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
That's on the DS.

1508
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Pretty cool role-playing game.

1509
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:52,000
God, why do you let me down Konami?

1510
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Their brand new music rhythm game, which is crap, called Walk It Out.

1511
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Yes, it's a game for the Wii about walking.

1512
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Awesome, because this is way better than any other good music game that could possibly release.

1513
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Let's release another one that's about walking.

1514
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:17,000
And finally, a week from today, Glory of Hercules coming out on the Nintendo DS from Nintendo.

1515
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:22,000
The first time that that series has been over here.

1516
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Pretty soon, Konami's going to put out a music game called Let's Push the Power Button.

1517
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Bobbing your head to the music.

1518
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
What is love? Baby, don't hurt me.

1519
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Hey, going to Japan and looking at the Japanese release dates.

1520
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Batman, Arkham Asylum, yes, it's taken a little while to come to Japan.

1521
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
But of course, they're probably having to redub everything in Japanese.

1522
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:47,000
So that is getting its release this week on the Xbox 360 and I believe the PlayStation 3 as well.

1523
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Operation Flashpoint, Dragon Rising, also making its way to the Xbox 360 and the PS3.

1524
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,000
The PS3 is getting a price reduction on BioShock.

1525
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,000
It's coming in a little while, but that would be the Japanese localized version there.

1526
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
That's coming out there.

1527
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
On the Nintendo Wii, Biohazard, the Dark Side Chronicles.

1528
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
And that, of course, would be Resident Evil over here in the US.

1529
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,000
So that would be Resident Evil, Dark Side Chronicles making its way out on the Wii this week in Japan.

1530
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Nothing of note really on the PlayStation 2.

1531
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
On the DS, there's a game called Last Window.

1532
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Myonaka no Yakusoku comes out this week on the DS.

1533
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I'm trying to see what kind of game that is.

1534
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,000
It's by Nintendo. It's some type of first party game.

1535
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
It looks to be kind of like one of those investigative games.

1536
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:33,000
It's a sequel to Hotel Dusk, I think.

1537
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Oh! It does look like that.

1538
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
That's what it is.

1539
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Last Window, that would make sense.

1540
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Okay, so it's like a sequel to that in Japan.

1541
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I know part of the name is Promise, so I don't understand the rest of it.

1542
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
That could have to do with the story, so that makes sense.

1543
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Alright, very cool.

1544
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Also coming out, it's kind of a slow week in Japan.

1545
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I don't know if they're having the same busy first quarter we are.

1546
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
But on the Sony PSP, it's got a few things.

1547
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Tekken 6 is getting a release on the PSP in Japan this week.

1548
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Spectral vs. Generation gets a price reduction this week.

1549
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:10,000
And Kentushi Gladiator Begins is a game that's coming out from the company Acquire.

1550
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
And it looks to be, you know, it's got kind of the gladiator on the front.

1551
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:20,000
It does look like it's kind of a gladiator Roman times and all that inspired game,

1552
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
like a fighting game. Kind of a little bit God of War-ish,

1553
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
but a little bit closer in the camera and a little bit closer combat,

1554
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
it looks like, from the screenshots we're looking at.

1555
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I don't know if that's something they're planning on bringing over here.

1556
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Oh, by the way, if you do like Bleach, Soul Carnival gets a price reduction on the PSP this week as well.

1557
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
That does it for Japanese releases. How about the UK?

1558
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
For the UK, I've just got a few.

1559
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:47,000
We have Army of Two, the 40th day on Xbox 360 and PS3 and PSP.

1560
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,000
We have Astro Boy for Wii DS and PSP.

1561
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Vancouver 2010, the official video game of the Olympic Winter Games.

1562
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
On PS3, PC, and Xbox 360. Sit.

1563
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Looking at some of the comments in our chat room, chat.orangeonsrader.com,

1564
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
some people getting in on the walk it out fun.

1565
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Bochikawa says, I want to see clap fun on the Wii.

1566
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Game Guru says, Konami's press start to win, where you press start and you win.

1567
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
No, it should be the standby to win the game.

1568
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Wow. Amalthea, I hope I'm saying that right, saying they should have the walking the dog game soon.

1569
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
That would be cool, like all these old 80's dances and stuff.

1570
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Everybody walk the dinosaur.

1571
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Here's the thing though, actually, speaking of all that dancing, a co-worker of mine,

1572
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:37,000
I don't know a lot of hardcore gamers at work, although this guy in particular does play a lot of video games.

1573
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
He told me that just dance on the Wii is actually a lot of fun.

1574
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
And some of the OLR people have said that too.

1575
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
It's a horrible game, but I've been selling a ton of it.

1576
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Apparently it's kind of like a Dark Horse type of game that's selling very well.

1577
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
It's not a Konami game though, right?

1578
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Apparently just dance is kind of a Dark Horse game right now.

1579
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:03,000
They also have this other one coming out called Dance Sensation that's going to be very similar to that in March.

1580
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,000
But it does have the bird, the zirphine bird.

1581
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Bird, bird, bird. The bird is a word.

1582
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,000
I still want X-Tango.

1583
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:19,000
And of course Tiger Claw takes things straight to the toilet saying, how about jack it out?

1584
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Of course he means a jack in the box, right?

1585
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Turn the crank.

1586
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Wink, wink, no judge.

1587
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
He means turning the crank, but not the kind of...

1588
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Anyhow, how about more gaming news?

1589
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Actually I have a better name for that particular version of it.

1590
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Please.

1591
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Ceiling Cat is watching you play this game.

1592
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
They should really just call it Walk It Off.

1593
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
You'll be fap to win.

1594
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
They should just call it Walk It Off.

1595
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Someone gets brutally injured and they have to walk it off.

1596
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Amathia also chimes in and says, why don't they transfer the Taiko drum games to the Wii? It would be perfect.

1597
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,000
I believe they did. They have a little inflatable drum even, but it's in Japan.

1598
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
They didn't bring it over here.

1599
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,000
So you might have to write Namco and bug them.

1600
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Or you're probably going to have to mod your Wii and import the Japanese version.

1601
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,000
But yeah, there's a cute little inflatable drum and everything.

1602
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,000
But those games, if I remember right, are pretty heavily Japanese.

1603
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Like, you know, they're not translated in English, so yeah.

1604
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Good luck navigating it.

1605
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Alright, couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

1606
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:25,000
And it shouldn't be too hard to figure out what Dark Soccer has picked this week, but it's a good one nonetheless.

1607
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Alright, well there's some news coming about what maybe announced at E3 perhaps this year.

1608
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Satoru Iwata has offered some information regarding the next DS system.

1609
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:49,000
And this is the next, not necessarily next revision of the system.

1610
01:16:49,000 --> 01:17:02,000
They're saying that the true next Nintendo handheld system, this is from an interview with a Asahi Shimbun newspaper, I'm assuming in Japan.

1611
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:13,000
It says it will have highly detailed graphics and it will be a necessity to have a sensor with the ability to read movements of people playing.

1612
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:19,000
In other words, it's going to have a tilt sensor, sort of like the iPhone.

1613
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:27,000
And I guess they also, you know, have done some experiments with motion control gaming and stuff on the DS.

1614
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Well, neat.

1615
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Also, another rumor that's still going around is some sort of 3G-like service for the DS.

1616
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:49,000
And something that they're going to have DS Wi-Fi hotspots or something like that, that you're going to be able to connect with people or download content or something like that.

1617
01:17:49,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Also, they said there's going to be a new Zelda game sort of revealed, I guess, revealed this year at E3. I guess it was sort of revealed last year.

1618
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
But, you know, it's actually going to be released by the end of 2010.

1619
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Well, remember they had like the screenshots and stuff.

1620
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Well, they had some artwork, I think.

1621
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:16,000
And then the Wii Vitality sensor, of course, is going to also have some software and stuff unveiled at E3.

1622
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:25,000
However, though, if you think about it, they don't really need the tilt sensors and stuff in the DS or the new DS2 or whatever you're going to call it.

1623
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:32,000
There's actually been some demos put out by Engine Software. It's a studio that develops different games.

1624
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:41,000
They have a demo of a game called Tilt that kind of looks a little bit like Marvel Blast Ultra or like Monkey Ball or something like that.

1625
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:47,000
And it does tilt sensors, or I guess motion control, based on the camera.

1626
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Because, you remember, the DSi has a camera built into it and can detect movement.

1627
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
So, you can basically do that.

1628
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:04,000
You know, it acts like tilting the actual system without needing actual motion sensors inside the system.

1629
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
You can do it with the camera.

1630
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:12,000
So, I don't think it's a necessity that they need to add motion sensors to the system.

1631
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
I mean, they can never do this stuff with the DS.

1632
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:24,000
And they actually apparently have the, I don't know, would call it drivers, I guess, the libraries for this technology.

1633
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:32,000
This company has it available for, I guess, they're working on a DSiWare game that's going to incorporate this new technology.

1634
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:38,000
So, that'd be cool to see. But, I don't know, do we really need motion sensors with a portable system?

1635
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
I don't know if that's the case.

1636
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,000
I can understand it with the iPhone because there's no actual buttons on it.

1637
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,000
I mean, so how else are you going to control stuff?

1638
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,000
But, I don't know, maybe we'll see the buttons go away.

1639
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
That'd be kind of crappy, though.

1640
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Alright, it's very interesting, though, that there's a new DS kind of definitely in the works, it sounds like, for E3.

1641
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
That could be their big announcement this year is that, hey, new DS.

1642
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Wouldn't that piss everybody off because now they have this DS XL or whatever?

1643
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
But not in America.

1644
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Not in America.

1645
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Maybe they don't plan on bringing it here because of that.

1646
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
But they just brought out the DSi, what, a year ago?

1647
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I know, I know.

1648
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Hey, you know what, though? Apple puts out a new phone every year.

1649
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
I mean, is that different? I don't know.

1650
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Yeah, but that's just the specs slightly upgraded. This is going to be a whole new system.

1651
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:31,000
I don't know, it's... stop. Just make some good games for it.

1652
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Have you really utilized this new technology and all these different upgrades yet?

1653
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:40,000
I mean, have they really done anything with the cameras other than, hey, look, now you can put your face in this.

1654
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Oh, wow, awesome.

1655
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,000
You know, actually, Nintendo hasn't really done anything with the camera other than, you know...

1656
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:52,000
The DSi needs an app like the unicorn thing on the iPhone, where you can take pictures of people and turn them into unicorns.

1657
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
It's seriously one of the best iPhone apps ever.

1658
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:00,000
It's U-Y-O-U in a corn. Look it up, it's awesome.

1659
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:05,000
I don't know about that, but seriously, what's the point in adding... they had all these, like...

1660
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Oh, yeah, there's two cameras in it now, and you can do all this stuff with the music.

1661
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:16,000
You can manipulate music and whatnot, and they've got all these iPhone... or not iPhone, like, different little applications and stuff.

1662
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,000
And then they move on to something else, but they haven't even really done anything with it.

1663
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,000
It's like the IR port in the PSP is completely useless.

1664
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I'd just be perfectly happy if they had, you know, a built-in Mario Paint mode.

1665
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
All right, we've got to keep the show moving. I do want to say real quick, though...

1666
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Giovedea in chat had a really good suggestion for the game's name that was inspired by Tiger Claw.

1667
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
You know, the whole turning the crank game?

1668
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,000
She says they ought to just call it Beat It, and you could already have some soundtrack in it.

1669
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Oh, yeah, this game's hot.

1670
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
I just scarred all of our listeners.

1671
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:56,000
All right, hey, one other music game that might be for real, for serious. No, really.

1672
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Def Leppard, the game.

1673
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Apparently, it's coming from a Rooters report, Rooters being one of the big news agencies with Associated Press, of course.

1674
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Apparently, the publishing company Primary Wave made a deal with Def Leppard to make a cartoon series and a video game that will be based on the band.

1675
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:17,000
The video game project is being called Unusual. Don't know what that means.

1676
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:25,000
But that's just all a rumor right now, so it's not some type of Def Leppard rock band or anything like that.

1677
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Perhaps Revolution Def?

1678
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Eh? Eh?

1679
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Sequel, maybe? Yes? It's unusual. That would be unusual.

1680
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:39,000
I have to say this, and I'm going to take a lot of shit for this, just like when I said it about other bands.

1681
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Def Leppard is not a big enough band to get their own game.

1682
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
I don't think Green Day is, either, though, and apparently they're getting their own game.

1683
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:55,000
But only really certain bands that have really stood the test of time and spanned multiple decades with consistent number one hits deserve their own game.

1684
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Journey is just a personal favorite.

1685
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Well, they had 80s and 90s, and they still have that Filipino guy now with them.

1686
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Like, Elvis might be big enough.

1687
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Or U2, I think, was a really good idea. I think U2 could get their own game.

1688
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:13,000
If it was an Elvis game, though, you'd have to have sensors on your hips.

1689
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
I kind of want to see the focus away from these band-specific music games.

1690
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
It's getting to be a little much.

1691
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Van Halen, let's face it, was not that great.

1692
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
It's an excuse to release another game.

1693
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,000
That's really what it is, because you can sell extra copies.

1694
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Let's keep in mind, back it up a minute, because keep in mind, this Def Leppard thing has nothing to do with Harmonix or Activision.

1695
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,000
It's another company, so if there is a music game coming out, it's different.

1696
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
That could be anything.

1697
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,000
I don't know, though. I think it's all talk.

1698
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
I don't think it'll happen.

1699
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I think if they do the test marketing and sampling, they're going to find there's not enough interest for it.

1700
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
And why would Def Leppard say, you know,

1701
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:55,000
oh, let's go with another company for a music game instead of jumping on an established franchise,

1702
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:01,000
where they would get the marketing support and the popularity from the rock band or guitar hero franchises.

1703
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
I just don't get why they would just go,

1704
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:07,000
eh, whatever, we don't need all that stuff, we're Def Leppard.

1705
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
I did like their last album.

1706
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Yeah, but I don't think it's like sold platinum copies, you know?

1707
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
They're kind of more of a nostalgia band at this point.

1708
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Do you see what this is, though?

1709
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Bon Jovi's new album. It was a gift.

1710
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
I don't like Bon Jovi.

1711
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Dude, I love Bon Jovi.

1712
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Anyhow, this is the part of the show, speaking of blasts from the past,

1713
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,000
where we like to open up the vault and take a trip down memory lane

1714
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:33,000
and, you know, respect the classics with a little segment we do here on OLR

1715
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
called the Classic Game of the Week.

1716
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Dark Soccer is going to jump into the vault and find a game that she says,

1717
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:41,000
you know what, you kids today that don't listen to your Def Leppard

1718
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,000
and Bon Jovi like you should, you need to go back

1719
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
and look at this classic game from the past.

1720
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Dark Soccer, what is the Classic Game of the Week this week?

1721
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
The classic game is NBA Jam.

1722
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Of course.

1723
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,000
And because there is no actual music really played much in the game

1724
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:00,000
while you're playing, I just found arcade samples, so...

1725
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Boom, Shakalaka!

1726
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Yeah.

1727
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
He's on fire!

1728
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Anyway, NBA Jam came out in 1993 for the arcade,

1729
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,000
and it spawned a series, and actually it was written in assembly,

1730
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
and of course, as I said in an earlier story,

1731
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:27,000
it was designed and programmed by Mark Turmel.

1732
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:34,000
It used a lot of the big names from the 92, 93 NBA system,

1733
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,000
and then, of course, for the console releases, it used the 93, 94,

1734
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:47,000
and there have been later versions that came out on Sega CD, Game Boy, and Game Gear.

1735
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:51,000
So, but of course there were certain licensing things,

1736
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
like they couldn't get Michael Jordan for the Bulls at the time,

1737
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,000
so they did get Scottie Pippen at the time.

1738
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,000
They also got certain ones were missing from the home versions,

1739
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:06,000
like Gary Payton and Shaquille O'Neal.

1740
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:11,000
There's also, of course, as we mentioned, a possibility of it being out on Wii.

1741
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:15,000
So, some of the pretty cool stuff, though, is this game,

1742
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
and this was what I think is really the notable part of it,

1743
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:24,000
is that the games had their digitized likenesses of the players included in the game,

1744
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,000
so that you could see their faces while they played.

1745
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,000
And then if you got three baskets in a row, you were on fire,

1746
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:38,000
and so you could be unlimited turbo, no goaltending,

1747
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:46,000
you could shoot better until the other team scored.

1748
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Also, you didn't have fouls, free throws, that type of thing.

1749
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
And you've got your spectacular dunk shots,

1750
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,000
so it was really more of a fantasy basketball type game.

1751
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:06,000
As far as Easter eggs that were in the game, you could...

1752
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Like, the Genesis actually had one, and I remember this one,

1753
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:16,000
super clean floors, where if you run too fast, you could slide and fall.

1754
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,000
And then there were the hidden characters, like you could play as Bill Clinton.

1755
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,000
You could play the Charlotte Hornets mascot.

1756
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:30,000
And then there were early versions of NBA Jam Tournament Edition

1757
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
that you let you play as Mortal Kombat characters.

1758
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:41,000
And I actually remembered playing beta versions of the game.

1759
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,000
By the way, you should play the Tournament Edition one that I linked up.

1760
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Oh, I just keep hopping from music to music.

1761
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
That one's fine.

1762
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,000
I like the Tournament Edition halftime music that I linked up in.

1763
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
I'll get it.

1764
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Okay, but anyway, they actually were taken out because of the violence

1765
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
that the Mortal Kombat characters represented.

1766
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:08,000
However, like I said, I played beta versions of it that everyone was in.

1767
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,000
There were a lot of...

1768
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:18,000
For NBA Jam and Mortal Kombat 2, there were a lot of beta versions

1769
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
of the games on the East Coast.

1770
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
So I got to check those out at the time.

1771
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
It was that year I went to New York.

1772
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
So I got to see them a lot on the way up the East Coast.

1773
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
It was pretty cool.

1774
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:34,000
So yeah, just to go over some of the people in the arcade version,

1775
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:40,000
you had Shaquille O'Neal, you had Isaiah Thomas, you had Reggie Miller,

1776
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Harvey Grant.

1777
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,000
For the SNES Genesis one, like some of the other people in there

1778
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:53,000
like Alonzo Warnings, Scottie Pippen, Patrick Ewing, Sega CD.

1779
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Bless you, by the way.

1780
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:02,000
You had a lot of the same people, just newer updates to them.

1781
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
And then, of course, you had the Game Gear ones.

1782
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Really a lot of the same people, though there were a few that,

1783
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,000
for licensing issues, were out.

1784
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:20,000
You also had Charles Barkley, you had all the big people.

1785
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
I don't know if anyone kept up with basketball back then.

1786
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
I actually did.

1787
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
So it was pretty cool.

1788
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,000
There were sequels.

1789
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,000
There was an NBA Jam Tournament Edition.

1790
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:37,000
There were all kinds of different ports.

1791
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:41,000
There was actually an Atari Jaguar version of it.

1792
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:45,000
There was NBA Jam Extreme in 1996, which was a 3D version

1793
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:51,000
that had Marv Albert doing the commentary.

1794
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:56,000
There was...

1795
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:01,000
It actually was revised as NBA Hang Time.

1796
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Do you remember that one?

1797
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I do.

1798
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Wasn't the same.

1799
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,000
There was a college version that's called College Slam.

1800
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:16,000
And then there were, of course, all the other sports games that Midway did.

1801
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,000
They did a two-on-two open ice challenge.

1802
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:25,000
But then it came out as Wayne Gretzky 3D hockey and NFL Blitz.

1803
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Blitz, I think, was another one in the thing.

1804
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
And then I think more of a spiritual successor, though, to NBA Jam

1805
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:37,000
was the NBA Showtime series that came out, the NBA on NBC.

1806
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Hoops was supposed to be on there.

1807
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:46,000
But anyway, that's really it.

1808
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,000
All right.

1809
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,000
By the way, I got linked to something awesome from XLink in our chat room.

1810
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
He linked me to this thing that's great.

1811
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
For instance, watch this.

1812
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Hey, Jamie, what did you have for breakfast today?

1813
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I didn't.

1814
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Boom shakalaka!

1815
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,000
That's cool.

1816
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Is there the, uh, it's in the shoes?

1817
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Or is it the shoes?

1818
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Oh my! He's on fire!

1819
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
No.

1820
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Propel town!

1821
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Actually, one of my favorite ones was, um, Couldn't Buy a Bucket.

1822
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Heating out!

1823
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Ugly shot!

1824
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Yeah.

1825
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Fantastic!

1826
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
All right, I'll cut it out, but I just-

1827
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:29,000
It's funny, though, that you'd get a kick out of Marv Albert being in one of these.

1828
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Eh, it's kind of funny, but I just-

1829
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:36,000
You know, I'm not a big, big fan of, um, sports games, usually.

1830
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
You know, I just- I don't watch a lot, you know, whatever.

1831
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
But I loved NBA Jam.

1832
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000
I played the crap out of that game.

1833
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Oh, yeah.

1834
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
And if I do watch any sports, it's probably basketball.

1835
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
It's the one I like more than anything.

1836
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:51,000
All right, well, anyhow, we got plenty more of gaming news coming up later in the show here.

1837
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
We're gonna take a quick break, though, for our live folks.

1838
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
And for you podcast folks, just sit on tight.

1839
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
We'll be right back after a little interlude.

1840
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,000
But when we come back after the break, we got a lot, a lot of rapid-fire news tonight.

1841
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Some quick stuff.

1842
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Your Twitter topics.

1843
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Uh, we're gonna talk a little bit about some Blizzard rumors.

1844
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
A game that apparently is no longer being published or shipped.

1845
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Um, a Wii Wand with MotionPlus built in.

1846
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
And plenty more when we come back from a quick break.

1847
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Excuse me.

1848
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
We're live. I have the hiccups. I can't handle it.

1849
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
All right, so I'm glad we're taking a break right now.

1850
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,000
And we'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1851
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:35,000
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio here on this Sunday night, January the 10th of 2010.

1852
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Uh, we are here, of course, every Sunday night at All Games Radio.

1853
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,000
www.allgames.com, taping Orange Lounge Radio.

1854
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Tonight is episode number 352.

1855
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,000
If you are just joining us, just a quick live programming note.

1856
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:52,000
We will not be live for the next two weeks due to various personal conflicts.

1857
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,000
However, we will be pre-taping a show at least in two weeks.

1858
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,000
But we are taking the Martin Luther King holiday off completely.

1859
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
I just want to make sure you guys know.

1860
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,000
But stay tuned to our podcast feed and all that fun stuff.

1861
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Anyhow, we got plenty more news to cover tonight, though.

1862
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
And then, of course, phone calls and so forth.

1863
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
So let's get into some rapid-fire news tonight.

1864
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Loki.

1865
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Yes, Dragon Age Origins is getting a brand new expansion in March.

1866
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
The new expansion is called Awakening.

1867
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
And it'll be coming out March 16th.

1868
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:29,000
It's going to be the first retail expansion for Dragon Age Origins.

1869
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Apparently going to be available for $40.

1870
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
And I'm not sure if that's actually coming out.

1871
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
I think that's also on $360 as well.

1872
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,000
I mean, that's kind of expensive. $40?

1873
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Well, if it's a lot of content, it could be nice.

1874
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:47,000
That better be a damn... I mean, a lot of content.

1875
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,000
I mean, look at all the expansions that they had for, you know...

1876
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Oblivion.

1877
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
For, you know, Fallout 3.

1878
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:57,000
I mean, those were, you know, about $10 each or $20 each.

1879
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:01,000
I don't know. We'll see.

1880
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
It'll be interesting.

1881
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Anyways, so March 16th, if you're looking forward to that.

1882
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Left 4 Dead is kind of getting a demake.

1883
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:19,000
They have an 8-bit version of Left 4 Dead that's been made by a guy named Eric Ruth.

1884
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
And the game looks like it should be on the NES.

1885
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
It supports up to two players.

1886
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
And it's basically a PC version that is available to download right now.

1887
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
So you can go find that.

1888
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:37,000
I believe they have it available on... he has his own website on Google.

1889
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:44,000
sites.google.com slash site slash eric david ruth

1890
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Is it a hack of a game?

1891
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
No.

1892
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Slash game dash left 4 dead.

1893
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,000
And that's just like how you would spell the actual title.

1894
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:58,000
And that's available. Otherwise you could do a search in Google and probably find it.

1895
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
But it's pretty cool looking.

1896
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:03,000
I thought it was an NES ROM hack at first, but no. It's a PC game.

1897
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Oh, I get it. Okay.

1898
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Gotta put it on my cabinet though.

1899
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Why not?

1900
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
It's two player.

1901
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Also, Rock Band on Playstation 3 is being patched.

1902
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Or Rock Band 2 I should say.

1903
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Being patched on the PS3 to make way for the Rock Band Network.

1904
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
And that's kind of cool.

1905
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,000
They're gonna actually have the Rock Band Network store in the interface.

1906
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:31,000
I guess selling songs directly added by Rock Band fans.

1907
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:35,000
And musicians and record labels through the new Rock Band Network.

1908
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Although I'm surprised. Is this even available right now for the Xbox?

1909
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:43,000
I don't believe so. I believe they're able to start making their songs.

1910
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:48,000
But I don't think they're actually... I think still in like a beta type stage.

1911
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Or a closed beta basically.

1912
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
That's too bad. I wanna play some new ones.

1913
01:35:53,000 --> 01:36:04,000
And apparently there's the updates also adding a more robust handling of chord hammer-ons and pull-offs found in the Beatles Rock Band.

1914
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Support for SingStar wireless microphones.

1915
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:14,000
And support for velocity sensitivity with the Ion Drum Rocker drums I guess.

1916
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:19,000
And the ability to sort songs in quick play by the number of stars you've earned in each song.

1917
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,000
So that should be coming very soon.

1918
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:30,000
And then also Half-Life 2 on PC has a mod added to it now to update the graphics.

1919
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:37,000
This is gonna be kind of on par with what we saw in Half-Life Episode 2.

1920
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Kind of like what we saw in the orange box that they released.

1921
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:45,000
And the mod adds a bunch of new detail into the game.

1922
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
More realistic graphics, new models, whatnot.

1923
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
About damn time.

1924
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Yeah, it looks pretty sweet.

1925
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Apparently right now I believe it's just he's working on Episode 1 as well right now.

1926
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:02,000
So that should be coming soon.

1927
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:07,000
But it basically adds HDR, high dynamic range, lighting.

1928
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Also new updated models, textures, and 32 Steam achievements as well.

1929
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,000
And so that's available I believe right now.

1930
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:23,000
So you can probably find that on your favorite mod site or yeah it's on the Steam powered forums.

1931
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
So there's a link on there somewhere.

1932
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Half-Life 2 is a pretty epic game.

1933
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,000
I think that it should fit the play.

1934
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,000
I'm almost surprised that they haven't released an update themselves.

1935
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Because it does look really good with the new graphics.

1936
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:40,000
I'm surprised that Valve hasn't done it themselves.

1937
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
But hey, someone else did.

1938
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
And that's it.

1939
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Alright, well Loki brought up music games and certainly Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero still in the picture with some weekly download packs believe it or not.

1940
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
They're still going strong there with the weekly download packs.

1941
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:58,000
January 7th, some Blues Masters types of songs.

1942
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Tyler Bryant, Joe Bonamassa, and Scott McKeon have some new songs coming out.

1943
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:07,000
January 14th is the Vampire Weekend, so if you're a fan of them.

1944
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Holiday, Cousins, and The Kids Don't Stand a Chance will all hit Band Hero and Guitar Hero 5 on the 14th.

1945
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,000
January 21st is a metal track pack.

1946
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
You get Shadows Fall with Still I Rise.

1947
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Amon Amoroth with Twilight of the Thunder God.

1948
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:24,000
And get this, Deathlok with Laser Cannon Death Sentence.

1949
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
So if you're a fan of Metalocalypse, you'll like that.

1950
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Dude, I fully threw up the horns for that.

1951
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,000
And then on the 28th, Creedence Clearwater Revival.

1952
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Yeah, Proud Mary and Bad Moon Rising and Traveling Band.

1953
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Sweet!

1954
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
No, I totally am going to get those.

1955
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,000
That's a very diverse lineup. We'll put it that way.

1956
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Rock Band, not to be ignored, is doing their weekly announcement as well.

1957
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:48,000
And this will be available this week on the 12th of the 14th, depending on what system you're on.

1958
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
It's Alice in Chains.

1959
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Some new songs by them.

1960
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Grind, Heaven Beside You, Last of My Kind, We Die Young, and Your Decision.

1961
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
So if you're an Alice in Chains fan, you're happy this week.

1962
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:03,000
And Microsoft has announced that Project Natal is coming this holiday season, 2010.

1963
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:06,000
That was straight from the CES 2010 keynote.

1964
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,000
I don't think that really surprises anyone though, but they are committing to that time frame.

1965
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
It will be out, holiday 2010.

1966
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,000
No official name though. It is still being called Project Natal.

1967
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
That may end up being its name.

1968
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Maybe just Natal, I don't know.

1969
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:21,000
But they are still calling it that, at least in their press conferences.

1970
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Hopefully they don't call it something stupid like Wii.

1971
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
We'll see.

1972
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:33,000
And lastly, from me, Dr. Pepper, yes the soft drink, is going to be giving away some free EA download content with their purchases.

1973
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:39,000
So apparently, if you actually purchase Dr. Pepper, every bottle apparently wins something.

1974
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:45,000
You can actually get whatever system and download content you want for stuff from Mass Effect 2,

1975
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Battlefield Heroes, The Sims 3, Spore, and Battlefield Bad Company 2.

1976
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Apparently they're all going to have unique download content.

1977
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:59,000
So I notice they're mostly newer games, with the exception of Spore, which has been out a little while.

1978
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
But I'm sure they wouldn't mind selling a few extra copies of that.

1979
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,000
So, there you go. Dr. Sakura.

1980
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Well, Squeenix actually put out from the North American group that they are putting Mir out in the spring.

1981
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Not sure if Europe is included as well, but it's by the guy who did, well, by the group that did Cavia.

1982
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:28,000
The group Cavia, sorry, I'm so tongue-tied, that did Bullet Witch and Resident Evil and Umbrella Chronicles.

1983
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:35,000
There is, though, a PS3 exclusive version that's only going to be out in Japan called Nier Replicant.

1984
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:41,000
And I'm actually really looking forward to this game, so I can't wait till we get it.

1985
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Well, I'm going to have to wait, but I'll look forward to it.

1986
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:52,000
And then also, Squeenix is bringing out Death by Cube on Xbox Live Arcade on the 20th of this month.

1987
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:58,000
It's another twin-stick, multi-directional shooter type of game.

1988
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Excuse me.

1989
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:06,000
And it's actually going to be based off of a bit of Robotron and Smash TV, so that'll be pretty good.

1990
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Those are fun games. More money, more prizes, I love it.

1991
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Not to be confused with Death by Companion Cube.

1992
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:16,000
No. Or Cube, as in the movie. Anyway.

1993
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Heavy Rain also has an official release date, but it's not the 16th.

1994
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
It is the 23rd.

1995
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:30,000
It was actually confirmed also by Sony.

1996
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:39,000
So, if you pre-order the game, you get free launch date access to the first downloadable Heavy Rain Chronicles episode,

1997
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:43,000
and otherwise it will be coming out later and you can pay five bucks for it then.

1998
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:52,000
The European release date for that is February 14th for Mainland and February 26th for UK and Ireland.

1999
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:57,000
And then, we have Xbox Live stuff.

2000
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Well, more Xbox Live stuff.

2001
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:10,000
They're actually saying that the Japanese developed games are more popular than most of the US ones, except for Castle Crashers,

2002
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:19,000
but the ones that have been getting the most sales have been Virtualon and Ikaruga and Triggerheart Excellica.

2003
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:26,000
So, actually, if you want to look at the top ten Xbox Live arcade games, just for 2009 in order,

2004
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:33,000
there's Virtualon, Oratorio Tengram, Battlefield 1943, Castle Crashers, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Trials HD,

2005
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:38,000
R-Type Dimension, Shadow Complex, Ikaruga, King of Fighters 98, and Mega Man 9.

2006
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:46,000
But, overall time, number one is Castle Crashers, Virtualon, Oratorio Tengram, Ikaruga, Bomberman Live, Battlefield 1943,

2007
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Triggerheart Excellica, Uno, Dracula X, Fatal Fury Special, and Res HD.

2008
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:55,000
And I believe that's from Japan, though. Not here in the US.

2009
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Because I think here the list would read something like, you know, Uno. Probably.

2010
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Anyhow. Alright, if that does it for the rapid fire news tonight, then let's get to some Twitter topics.

2011
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:12,000
I did want to say real quick, just to make a comment about the Xbox Live stats in Japan,

2012
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:20,000
I am very proud of a game that I actually played quite often, and unfortunately didn't get as much love as I would have liked it over here.

2013
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:26,000
On Games On Demand, the top game downloaded in 2009 from Japan,

2014
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Earth Defense Force 3, better known as Earth Defense Force 2017 over here.

2015
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:34,000
The greatest game featuring giant ants.

2016
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Not as good as Bayonetta, though, I'm telling you. I'm telling you.

2017
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:42,000
So good, in fact, I actually have four copies of this game.

2018
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Wow.

2019
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:47,000
I have saved three, I was eventually going to give them out on the show at some point.

2020
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Nice.

2021
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
I haven't done it yet, but they're collecting dust, so.

2022
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Soon.

2023
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Let's get to Twitter topics tonight. We ask you guys every week to send your tweets to OLR on Twitter,

2024
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:01,000
about things you think we maybe missed, or topics you want us to discuss.

2025
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:04,000
We have a few tweets tonight, a lot of story referrals tonight.

2026
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:08,000
ActDef says, I got a couple Twitter topics for you, one of them is coming up later in the show,

2027
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,000
but the other one has to do with Gran Turismo 5 details.

2028
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Apparently some more details came out about the game,

2029
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:17,000
and it's in the February edition of the PlayStation Official Magazine.

2030
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Over 1,000 vehicles, modeled cockpits, physical and mechanical damage modeling,

2031
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,000
indie cars and tracks included, NASCAR cars and tracks included,

2032
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:30,000
up to 16 players online, high definition video uploads directly to YouTube.

2033
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
That's interesting.

2034
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Multi-display rendering, head tracking, full weather and night racing on all tracks,

2035
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,000
night and day cycle on all tracks, that's going to be a pretty intense game.

2036
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Gran Turismo 5, I'm sure that's going to be a huge thing they're going to show at E3 this year.

2037
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Moving on.

2038
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
I doubt it, it's coming out in February.

2039
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Is it that soon?

2040
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
No, not February, like April.

2041
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Oh wow, I didn't realize it was that soon.

2042
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Dang.

2043
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Alright, cool.

2044
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Is that just in Japan, or is that over here too?

2045
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
That's over here.

2046
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Wow.

2047
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Ionotropic sent us a tweet.

2048
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Final Fantasy XIII apparently is the biggest swindle ever,

2049
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:07,000
and links us to this topic of a thing that we ran on Destructoid.

2050
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:11,000
It was a really negative review that came from a Hong Kong magazine.

2051
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,000
I guess, and I'm trying to see what the name of the magazine is here,

2052
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:17,000
I don't see it, but it was some magazine in Hong Kong.

2053
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:20,000
They called Final Fantasy XIII the biggest joke of 2009,

2054
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:24,000
saying the game is completely linary until the open area is near the end.

2055
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
You can't even backtrack.

2056
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Of all the RPGs I've played in recent years,

2057
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
this is the first which have been so linear that it is little more

2058
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:34,000
than riding an amusement park ride.

2059
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Ouch.

2060
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
They gave the game a 4 out of 10.

2061
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:40,000
They gave the scenario a 2, saying it's a tearjerker.

2062
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:43,000
The system a 1, saying it's such a crude system.

2063
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
They gave the graphics a 9 and the sound a 7,

2064
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:48,000
but then the enthusiasm was a 1.

2065
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,000
So, I don't know if they...

2066
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Sounds like they just rate it low to get attention.

2067
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,000
I don't know, well it worked.

2068
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
So, there you go.

2069
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:00,000
That was from a Hong Kong magazine that I don't see the name of here.

2070
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Maybe somebody has it in chat.

2071
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,000
More links from our Twitter peoples.

2072
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,000
SSJ100Matt sent us a tweet that talks about a new hack glitch

2073
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
on Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.

2074
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Apparently some players have now turned into Super Speed.

2075
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:19,000
So, I guess now if you get a certain hack from Modern Warfare 2,

2076
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:22,000
you can run around just as fast as possible.

2077
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:27,000
And if you cheat online with this, you are an asshole.

2078
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Let's see.

2079
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Tigerclaw305 links us to this story about Rockstar San Diego.

2080
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:35,000
The wives, apparently, of many of the employees are demanding

2081
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,000
better work conditions for spouses.

2082
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,000
This is kind of interesting.

2083
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Apparently it's an open letter that was posted on a Gamasutra blog.

2084
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Ouch.

2085
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Rockstar San Diego meets the Midnight Club series of games

2086
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:50,000
and they're working on the Red Dead Revolver sequel right now.

2087
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Apparently some of the blog things are addressed in the blog.

2088
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,000
12 plus hour workdays, six day work weeks,

2089
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,000
cuts to medical benefits, a decline in bonuses,

2090
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,000
and all that other stuff.

2091
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
So apparently, unfortunately, the workers are not getting compensated

2092
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
the way they should be.

2093
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
And fortunately, in this economy, it's not that easy to quit.

2094
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:10,000
But at the same time, that doesn't mean you abuse the workers.

2095
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
I think if they really do have an issue, though,

2096
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,000
they should take it up with the state board.

2097
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:16,000
If they're working 12 hours, they're getting time and a half

2098
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,000
and then double time plus.

2099
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:22,000
So I wouldn't be too alarmed about that.

2100
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,000
And you do have the option.

2101
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:26,000
I mean, this is California.

2102
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
We're in the freaking worker's paradise here.

2103
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:32,000
But when it's mandatory hours, and unfortunately this economy,

2104
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
it's not just easy to say, quick, go find something else.

2105
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
There isn't a lot out there right now.

2106
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:39,000
But it technically is not legal to force a mandatory overtime.

2107
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Oh, they do it. Companies do it.

2108
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,000
They do it.

2109
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:44,000
But if you protest it, they don't have to schedule you for it.

2110
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Because trust me, I have been scheduled for mandatory overtime

2111
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
and I'm like, sorry, I have something else that I'm doing

2112
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
and gotten out of it.

2113
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
So it's law.

2114
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:56,000
They cannot make you do mandatory overtime.

2115
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
I don't know.

2116
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Blackwell seems to think that California's one of the states

2117
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:02,000
that didn't give overtime to those doing computer programming.

2118
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
I don't know if there were exceptions.

2119
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,000
I mean, I don't work in that field, so I wouldn't know as closely.

2120
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,000
But I don't think there's really exceptions to that.

2121
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:11,000
The only way they can get out of that is if you're salaried.

2122
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Yeah.

2123
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,000
And even so, I know at my work, they actually,

2124
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:19,000
they are really, really anal on addressing your hours

2125
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:22,000
because they do crack down really hard

2126
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:26,000
if you've made someone work more than eight hours in a day.

2127
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Spazinator, PSN on Twitter, sends a tweet.

2128
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:33,000
How about the reports of Natal possibly being gimped as a cost-cutting measure?

2129
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,000
I don't know if you can gimp something you don't really know about.

2130
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,000
I mean, this system has not really been put out there for the masses to consume.

2131
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
I mean, they didn't put it on the show floor at E3.

2132
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
It was only behind closed doors

2133
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
and believed only in a demonstration capacity.

2134
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:48,000
So they might gimp it, but you'll never know.

2135
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,000
The only reason they're saying it's gimped is because they took,

2136
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:54,000
there was a processor built into the camera before,

2137
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:58,000
but to reduce costs, they're now using the actual Xbox 360 processor

2138
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:02,000
because that's going to take 10 to 15% of the system resources

2139
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,000
to process the Natal capture stuff.

2140
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,000
I see.

2141
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
So they're saying that the games are going to have some of their processing.

2142
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
They're going to suffer because of that.

2143
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,000
You know what, though?

2144
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Again, it's...

2145
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Yeah, but would you rather, okay, would you rather that the games,

2146
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:19,000
maybe they'll have to cut corners a little bit in the games

2147
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:26,000
and say Natal's like, I don't know, $79, $59 or whatever,

2148
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:31,000
versus they don't cut corners in the game, project Natal is $200.

2149
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Plus that forces developers to make their games for Natal.

2150
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Like, they can't just throw on Natal controls onto existing games.

2151
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,000
I kind of like that aspect about it, actually.

2152
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:44,000
It forces programmers to make games for Natal.

2153
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,000
You know what I mean?

2154
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Yeah, we'll see.

2155
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,000
It's pulling the Nintendo on them if it's forcing them to do it

2156
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:54,000
because, well, for the longest time, Nintendo had their own proprietary...

2157
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,000
True, true. That was a big thing back in the day with the cartridges.

2158
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Bobby Black Wolf sends us a tweet wanting us to talk about Duke Nukem Forever.

2159
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,000
You jerk.

2160
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
And you know why I said that.

2161
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
And if you don't know why I said that, you can listen to Bobby's show,

2162
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
the Bobby Black Wolf show, and our little phone call at the end.

2163
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:14,000
And why I do not believe Duke Nukem Forever is worthy of news coverage at all.

2164
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Yet. Right now.

2165
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
At this time, no.

2166
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Until they put something actually playable out there on the E3 show floor,

2167
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,000
and no more... I'm sick and tired of these video teases and things

2168
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
that just end up changing in a couple years anyway.

2169
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Like, put your goddamn money where your mouth is.

2170
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
I'm sick of talking about it.

2171
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
And look, I just spent a minute now talking about it,

2172
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
so please, let's move on with more stories.

2173
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Alright.

2174
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Well, there's some other fun stuff, including,

2175
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Sony is apparently increasing the storage capacity of Blu-ray Discs.

2176
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:50,000
You know, the previous discs, of course, used by the PS3 were 25 gigabytes.

2177
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Now they're being expanded to 33.4 gigabytes,

2178
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:59,000
meaning that, well, you can store a lot more stuff on there.

2179
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:06,000
And also seeing that soon dual-layer Blu-ray Discs will become common,

2180
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:10,000
and you'll be able to fit 66.8 gigabytes worth of data.

2181
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,000
All that means is you're never going to see multi-disc games for the PS3.

2182
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:17,000
It's just going to be, you know, all on the 360.

2183
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
And longer cutscenes.

2184
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Longer cutscenes, more high-definition graphics, more language options.

2185
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:28,000
It still doesn't fix the fact that the Blu-ray drive is kind of slow.

2186
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
That's a little bit of a problem.

2187
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,000
But hey, uncompressed, you know, textures,

2188
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,000
you know, all sorts of fun stuff to save on processing power.

2189
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Could that mean larger installs down the line because the disc will hold more?

2190
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
I'm going to have to install more to my drive?

2191
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Maybe.

2192
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:46,000
That's neat, though, that they can kind of do that

2193
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
and not have to release a new PlayStation 3.

2194
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
I mean, I do kind of think that's a nice little feature,

2195
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
is that they can kind of patch that in.

2196
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
That will come in handy.

2197
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Especially when, you know, Final Fantasy 15 or whatever is on its way out

2198
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
and they want to do Uber cutscenes with it.

2199
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Huge, huge rumor right now, speaking of, like, Uber games.

2200
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Apparently, it's a rumor that Blizzard is currently working on a first-person MMO.

2201
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,000
It's coming from a French gaming site, No Frag,

2202
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:12,000
saying they have a reliable source.

2203
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Everybody does.

2204
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:18,000
That Blizzard's next game, you know, after Diablo and after StarCraft,

2205
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
will be a first-person MMO.

2206
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,000
You know, Blizzard apparently has been working on a new IP.

2207
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
We kind of know that based off the fact that they've had some job postings

2208
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:29,000
and so forth in the past, and that it's an MMO based on, again, the job postings.

2209
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:33,000
So, you know, maybe there is some credibility to this.

2210
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
It could be interesting if it is a first person.

2211
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,000
They are saying the game will take place in a futuristic world

2212
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
and players have two lives.

2213
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:44,000
The first is kind of a Sims Online type of hub,

2214
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,000
and then the second life is where you do fighting

2215
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
and other first-person-y type stuff.

2216
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Apparently, it's weird and metaphysical.

2217
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
So that could be interesting, a new IP.

2218
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
I'm glad they're trying to branch out and do something new.

2219
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,000
It's kind of risky.

2220
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:00,000
But, you know, I was just talking about this with some people last night,

2221
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,000
is that, you know, World of Warcraft is dominating as it is.

2222
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:07,000
You know, Blizzard has to be thinking about their next steps in the MMO universe,

2223
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:11,000
because if they want a game to come out when WoW gets old,

2224
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
they need to be working on it already.

2225
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:17,000
You know, because WoW is going to age out in maybe five years,

2226
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
maybe less, I don't know,

2227
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
and they need to be thinking about the successor to that.

2228
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
But, of course, this doesn't sound like World of Warcraft 2.

2229
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
This sounds like something else completely new.

2230
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Could be interesting.

2231
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Could be targeting a different audience altogether.

2232
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
I don't know.

2233
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,000
I can tell you the top-secret game I played this week

2234
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
was also two very different types of modes in it.

2235
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
So maybe that's the direction of MMOs.

2236
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
I don't know. Maybe?

2237
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Well, in other news, this is actually kind of sad.

2238
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:47,000
There is a game that is no longer going to be shipped,

2239
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
no longer going to be published.

2240
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Nintendo has put the clothes on it, even though it's only been out for four months.

2241
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:59,000
The Metroid Prime Collector's Edition is gone.

2242
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:02,000
The only way you're going to get it is used.

2243
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
It's been gone for a while, actually.

2244
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
But it's officially gone.

2245
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Yeah, somebody finally contacted Nintendo this week.

2246
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
What do you know, Loki?

2247
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Well, it's been moratorium for a while.

2248
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,000
I just figured they'd stop making it.

2249
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
They do that sometimes with some of their older games.

2250
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
But it's been looking out for four months.

2251
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Yeah, that's weird.

2252
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Yeah, but it's just a re-release of Prime 3 and the other two games.

2253
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:29,000
I get that, but at the same time, what they did to Prime 1 and 2 was new.

2254
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
The whole widescreen of Wii controls.

2255
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Well, now they can re-release them separately, maybe.

2256
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
I don't know.

2257
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Give them an excuse.

2258
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Hey, look, we're putting out new games.

2259
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Maybe Nintendo is finally being punished for just rehashing their GameCube shit

2260
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
and releasing it with this new play control.

2261
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Well, they've stopped doing the new play control stuff.

2262
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
At least I haven't seen any coming out.

2263
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Do you know how some of those other ones sold?

2264
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Prime 3 did okay, I think.

2265
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Well, the trilogy did alright for a little bit.

2266
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
The other ones, I mean, it depends.

2267
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Some people picked up Pikmin and that kind of stuff.

2268
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:08,000
They sold a little bit for a while, but it dropped off really quick.

2269
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:12,000
It wasn't like people were buying Pikmin like it was the new Pikmin game or something like that.

2270
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Maybe it ended up being cost-effective. Who knows?

2271
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Let's see, Tigerclaw in our chat says maybe they'll do a greatest hits thing for those games.

2272
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
She could buy the Wii version separate.

2273
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Even if they release those at 20 bucks apiece, the collector's edition was a better deal.

2274
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:28,000
To get all three of them for what, like 40 or whatever it was?

2275
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Pretty much.

2276
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
The only reason I didn't get it is because I already owned three

2277
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:34,000
and I wasn't that attached to the Metroid series where I wanted to buy 1 and 2.

2278
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Because I just...

2279
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,000
It's not high def.

2280
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Don't you have the GameCube versions anyways?

2281
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,000
No, those were my roommate's games at the time.

2282
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Those were Extra First games, not mine.

2283
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
He was the big fan of Metroid.

2284
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
I do have the third one though. I did like Metroid Prime 3.

2285
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
I just, you know, I wasn't as into it.

2286
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:54,000
I think this other M is going to be more up my alley.

2287
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
I like the 2D thing.

2288
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,000
See, I was thinking that, it's like you were saying, not being cost-effective.

2289
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,000
A lot of people maybe already had these games, were disillusioned.

2290
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:11,000
If profit doesn't match output for cost, then it makes perfect sense for them to get rid of it.

2291
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:14,000
I hate to say it, Nintendo should be slapped on the wrist for that.

2292
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:18,000
I mean, I think they were trying to milk the cash cow there without changing the games enough.

2293
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:22,000
I mean, what they did with Metroid and the white series, it was a little better.

2294
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,000
And I think they did that for some of the other games.

2295
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:24,000
It just wasn't enough.

2296
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Where's the online play?

2297
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
You did it in the DS one.

2298
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
This is not enough.

2299
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Anyhow, more news.

2300
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Some other fun stuff.

2301
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Let's see.

2302
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Let's see here. Sorry about that.

2303
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Another thing that came out of CES.

2304
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:50,000
The Xbox 360 media room.

2305
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:53,000
It's kind of like an IPTV thing that they've got.

2306
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:59,000
And I believe they talked a little bit about that, or at least it was rumored at last CES.

2307
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
That they were possibly going to go that way.

2308
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:09,000
But this is going to be something that's going to be offered with, or I should say, for AT&T U-verse subscribers.

2309
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:15,000
And they'll allow you to have access to some of these new channels that are going to be available through that.

2310
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:20,000
And I guess right now, I don't know, I think U-verse is in my area.

2311
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,000
But I haven't really jumped on that yet.

2312
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:26,000
I don't know if they have the U-verse internet in my area.

2313
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
I think that's what it is.

2314
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Anyways, and they're going to have that coming out later this year.

2315
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:36,000
And apparently any of the subscribers to U-verse will have access to this.

2316
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:40,000
I think you also probably have to have their internet as well.

2317
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
But it's kind of neat.

2318
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:47,000
They didn't really say a whole lot about it, but there's going to be a lot of limitations on there.

2319
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:52,000
You're not going to be able to record any of the programming on there with a DVR.

2320
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:57,000
You're not going to be able to get access to all the different stations and stuff.

2321
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:03,000
I mean, if it doesn't cost anything additional, then that wouldn't be too horrible, I guess.

2322
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:06,000
I don't know.

2323
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:09,000
I like that at least there's starting to be more choices.

2324
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Because I felt like for TV for the longest time, if you want a cable-type thing, you really only have Comcast.

2325
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Now there's this AT&T thing that's... I'm all for competition, you know?

2326
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Yeah, I need the FiOS stuff to get here.

2327
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Because that's going to be awesome.

2328
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Twice the speed that Comcast downloads.

2329
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Alright, speaking of an all-in-one, everything built in on the Wii,

2330
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Nyko, of course, releases some third-party controllers for the Wii.

2331
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:40,000
I usually see them at E3. They do the big inflatable Wii controls and stuff.

2332
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Well, the Luan that they released last time was pretty sweet with the ability to link up with their gun controller or whatever like that.

2333
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:51,000
It'd be directly attached to it and stuff.

2334
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:55,000
It's a little device that pushes the button on the controller.

2335
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Well, this year, what they're putting out is a $40 wand.

2336
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
The wand is the name of their controller.

2337
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:06,000
It is a Wiimote, basically, that includes MotionPlus inside it.

2338
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:11,000
And it also does all the transport stuff that Loki's talking about, what the wand did before.

2339
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:17,000
But apparently now you will get to have the WiimotionPlus built in, so you don't have to buy an extra adapter for it.

2340
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:22,000
That's pretty awesome, and for the same price as a normal remote, why wouldn't you buy that?

2341
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
The controller doesn't look that bad.

2342
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
No, it's not a bad looking thing at all.

2343
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:29,000
It looks like the same layout and everything.

2344
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:33,000
I mean, unless you have to have the Nintendo made one. I don't know why.

2345
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
I'm surprised Nintendo...

2346
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Might not be a bad deal.

2347
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
I wonder if they're taking this well.

2348
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Well, maybe you just want Wii Play really bad. I don't know.

2349
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Alright, one segment I want to get to really bad is the part where our listeners email us.

2350
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:50,000
It's the mailbag segment that we do every week here on the show.

2351
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
So Dark Sakura's going to dive in headfirst to our mailbag.

2352
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Again, the address to send us emails.

2353
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:58,000
mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

2354
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Again, that's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

2355
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Don't be shy. Email us.

2356
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Mailbag's been kind of dry the past few weeks. I don't know.

2357
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:06,000
We'll see if there's anything there tonight. Dark Sakura?

2358
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
The first one comes from Redertainment.

2359
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Dear OLR, I was listening to the 12609 show we talked about the Xbox Live avatar pets and thought you might like to be made aware of something.

2360
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Last summer, Major Nelson sent out a tweet compelling people to get the word out that Final Fantasy 13 is on Xbox 360.

2361
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:26,000
I was among the people who participated in this free marketing campaign.

2362
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Recently, Microsoft sent out tokens to people who participated in the campaign, including me.

2363
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:34,000
This token got me a free avatar pet, a chocobo.

2364
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:39,000
A tiny yellow chocobo, which is indistinguishable from a newborn chick.

2365
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:43,000
All this chocobo does is show up, fly around my head, and delight my avatar.

2366
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:46,000
If I had not gotten this for free, I would not have paid for it.

2367
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
However, I am grateful to have it.

2368
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:54,000
I'm sure this means chocobo 360 avatar pets will enhance my enjoyment of Final Fantasy 13 on PS3.

2369
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Staycare Redertainment.

2370
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:00,000
This message has been brought to you by the simple truth of Dark Sakura.

2371
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Boobies are fun in need.

2372
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Boobies are great fun.

2373
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:07,000
They are.

2374
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
We only got one other email.

2375
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Hey OLR, the mailbag has been dry the past few months so I thought I would write.

2376
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:18,000
I've been listening to the show for a few years and had to stop listening live due to me moving to a rural area.

2377
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:22,000
And I have shitty satellite internet.

2378
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Sucks because I had three months of live left.

2379
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Oh well, I was listening to your first episode of the new year and the whole Windows mobile integrating to Xbox Live.

2380
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:34,000
You guys didn't think much of it, but think about it.

2381
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Most video game characters use some sort of device in game.

2382
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Your phone could replace any one of those devices from Snakes, Kodak, Nettle Your Solid coming to Xbox I guess.

2383
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:46,000
To a PIP boy or whatever.

2384
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Plus with Natal, which I actually don't think will be most things they promise it to be, it could be interesting.

2385
02:01:55,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Anyway, I read in my RSS feed today that Microsoft just allowed Razer, you know the ones who make the morbidly expensive PC peripherals, to make and sell a controller and headset.

2386
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Seriously, what the fuck.

2387
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:11,000
They just stopped Natal from getting on their share of the market.

2388
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:16,000
I understand that it's a different category of product, but it still seems like a dick move on Microsoft's part.

2389
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:20,000
If you don't mind a short rant, continue. If you get careless, please skip to the end.

2390
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,000
It's not that long.

2391
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
Okay, you're still reading this, so what the heck.

2392
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:26,000
I'm kind of pissed about how cheap people are getting about their games.

2393
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Not so much the development aspect of it, but the materials they actually give you.

2394
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
First, the cases started getting super cheap.

2395
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:37,000
See this BluRay case, the same style is also coming out to Xbox 360 boxes very soon.

2396
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Let me pull it up.

2397
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,000
Oh yeah.

2398
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
You see these?

2399
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Oh yeah, I heard about that, that the boxes are going to change. Okay.

2400
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:47,000
I'm actually going to link this in chat real quick while I'm thinking about it.

2401
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:54,000
And going back to the email.

2402
02:02:54,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Another thing that follows this trend is releasing bonus content is download content, yeah.

2403
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Yeah, yeah, this is the digital agent all, but it's not really fair to people like me who can't get online.

2404
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:12,000
I just got Gears 2 GOTY edition and the included quote,

2405
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:16,000
multiplayer maps, which I could care less about in the extra campaign chapter,

2406
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:21,000
which is the reason I waited for the GOTY edition, were just a code for me to download online.

2407
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Even Gears 1 platform had the bonus content on a disc.

2408
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:28,000
If I have to shell out 60 bucks for a game, at least give me what I deserve.

2409
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Anyway, this email is getting pretty lengthy, so I'll stop it here.

2410
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Keep Up The Great Show from Tiberius Jones.

2411
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Well, thank you very much for the email.

2412
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,000
I recognize that name.

2413
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Somebody used to email us a while ago, so I guess that explains why it stopped happening.

2414
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Good to hear from you again.

2415
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Yeah.

2416
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
You know, I get the whole mobile integration thing,

2417
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:53,000
but I think a lot of the things you were kind of referencing there would like the whole like see something on your phone.

2418
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:56,000
I don't think there's the processing power behind it.

2419
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:59,000
I mean, do you remember when they came out and announced the PlayStation 3?

2420
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:03,000
They were like, it's going to interface with the PSP, and you can use it as like their rear view mirror in Ridge Racer.

2421
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Ridge Racer!

2422
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
That was lame.

2423
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:06,000
That never happened.

2424
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,000
It was a stupid idea, too.

2425
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:14,000
But I will say, they have done some neat integration where I can log on to my PlayStation 3 from my PSP

2426
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:18,000
and like look at videos and even play some certain games across the internet.

2427
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
So some of that integration would be cool,

2428
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:25,000
but I just think a mobile phone doesn't have that same oomph that a dedicated gaming device does.

2429
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Kind of back to something similar that I did say last week,

2430
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:32,000
I think what you would see that's a little more practical is that, you know, the phone has some type of game

2431
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:36,000
that enhances the experience of a console game.

2432
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Like, you know, Fable II Pub Games comes to mind,

2433
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:43,000
but not anything really, I think, that integrated.

2434
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
I just don't think mobile phones have that kind of power.

2435
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
But I could be wrong.

2436
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:48,000
My iPhone has fun gaming.

2437
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Yeah, but even iPhone games have their own problems.

2438
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
A lot of frame rate issues in a lot of those games, you know.

2439
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Maybe it's just my phone. I don't know.

2440
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Alright, well thanks for the e-mails.

2441
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
If you have more mail, you can always send us e-mails.

2442
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2443
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:05,000
But in the meantime, while we wait for your e-mails,

2444
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
we're going to need to get a little bit angsty on the show.

2445
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Thankfully, we don't have any stupid moron to inspire our FUs this week,

2446
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:29,000
but that doesn't mean we're not going to let out the angst.

2447
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:32,000
I have one. The waiting game. That's it.

2448
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Loki.

2449
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:38,000
My FU goes to people that play on Xbox Live

2450
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:42,000
and decide to drop because you suck or you're losing.

2451
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
I mean, come on.

2452
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:48,000
At least in Grand Theft Auto, any score that you're getting

2453
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:52,000
is still going to count toward your rank, even if you suck.

2454
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
I don't understand what the point is in dropping

2455
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:55,000
because you know what happens when you drop?

2456
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:59,000
I rate you down anyways, so fuck you.

2457
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:03,000
More people should use that rating system, honestly.

2458
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,000
I have been now everybody that drops, and trust me, it's a lot.

2459
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
It's a few per game every time,

2460
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:12,000
and it's rare when we get people to actually stick in there.

2461
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Occasionally, we drop, but that's because our internet connection at work sucks,

2462
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:19,000
and it just randomly kicks us out,

2463
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:22,000
not us quitting on purpose like some people do.

2464
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Unfortunately, you probably get rated down for quitting on purpose,

2465
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:25,000
even though you didn't.

2466
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:28,000
No, I am rated down 8% by people,

2467
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
and it's for aggressive.

2468
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:34,000
They said it's unsportsmanlike behavior or something like that,

2469
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
basically saying that I'm being too aggressive.

2470
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:39,000
That's usually for trash talking, but I don't use a headset.

2471
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:40,000
Fascinating.

2472
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
There is no trash talking.

2473
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:43,000
I'm just kicking their ass.

2474
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:44,000
What a bunch of dicks.

2475
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Babies.

2476
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Seriously, look at the pussies whining to their mommy.

2477
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
There should be some type of check and balance for that

2478
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
for people who abuse that system.

2479
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:54,000
I don't really have a lot of FUs.

2480
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Just FU to like chaos.

2481
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Otherwise, things are fine.

2482
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
I don't have a lot to be angsty about.

2483
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:04,000
All right, a couple more stories for you guys,

2484
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
and then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR,

2485
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:10,000
but there's some stories still, so Loki.

2486
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
This is kind of interesting.

2487
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:17,000
There's a new patent that Microsoft, I guess, is a part of

2488
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:23,000
that's for muscle control controllers, I guess.

2489
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
The EMG muscle controllers.

2490
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:30,000
What it is is basically a device that you would put on your arm

2491
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:36,000
or something that would detect the impulses from your nerves

2492
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
going to your different muscles.

2493
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:42,000
So, for example, one of the examples that they show

2494
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:47,000
is someone playing Guitar Hero using just their hand.

2495
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:50,000
It's basically the movements and the motions of pushing

2496
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:53,000
the different fret buttons are actually causing

2497
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:59,000
the different fret buttons to hit in the game.

2498
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
This could be something that may be tied in with Natal

2499
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:02,000
later on or something like that.

2500
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Yeah, I was going to say, the way you describe it,

2501
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,000
it sounds like a Natal thing.

2502
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Natal should be the thing that sees my fingers

2503
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:11,000
and how I'm moving and all that.

2504
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
That's kind of the way they're advertising it.

2505
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
It almost sounds like it shouldn't have to be this whole

2506
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:18,000
separate thing, but Natal should just know I have a guitar.

2507
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:19,000
I don't know.

2508
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:20,000
Yeah.

2509
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:23,000
So, I don't know.

2510
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:26,000
But apparently, Natal is supposed to detect movement

2511
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:30,000
of at least 31 different parts of your body.

2512
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:33,000
So, I don't know if it's really necessary.

2513
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Maybe something else that they're working on.

2514
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:36,000
Whatever.

2515
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:40,000
If it works, it's cheap.

2516
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
I don't know if Air Guitar Hero would be as fun.

2517
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
There's something about the plastic guitar that is charming.

2518
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
I think it's just proof of concept stuff.

2519
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:51,000
I don't think they would actually use it for something like that.

2520
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:55,000
True, because Guitar Hero is a third-party game anyway.

2521
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
It's not something that's really done by Microsoft.

2522
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:58,000
It would feel weird.

2523
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:03,000
It would feel really weird just kind of moving your fingers.

2524
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:07,000
One more story for you guys, and it's about the PlayStation Network.

2525
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Another survey, and I've seen a story like this before,

2526
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:13,000
but this is yet another survey that's talking about

2527
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:16,000
subscription-based features on the PlayStation Network.

2528
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:19,000
This is a survey that went out to UK PlayStation Network members,

2529
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:25,000
asking them about possible subscription models for the service.

2530
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:28,000
The market research company that's running this is called IPsauce,

2531
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:33,000
IPsauce, and some of the benefits that they mention in here.

2532
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Let's see.

2533
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Full title trials.

2534
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:36,000
First hour is free.

2535
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
So, imagine if you could actually download a full game

2536
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
and play it for an hour for free.

2537
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Cross-game voice chat access.

2538
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
I know that's come up before.

2539
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Member demo sharing a full game.

2540
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Not quite sure what that means.

2541
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Maybe that means that you could send a demo to somebody,

2542
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
but maybe that's probably this full title trial.

2543
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Something that strikes me as interesting, token wagering.

2544
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Is that like legalized gambling of some sort?

2545
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:03,000
Something like that sounds like strange.

2546
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
User-to-user challenges.

2547
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Maybe like user-generated trophies.

2548
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Early access to all store content.

2549
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Well, that's really no different than what they do on Xbox.

2550
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
And then this is also what I think is very interesting.

2551
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Free access to PS1 classics, PSP minis, and PS3 PSP themes.

2552
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
So, imagine if you got a subscription service

2553
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:27,000
to suddenly let you play all the PS1 games you wanted.

2554
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:30,000
I wonder if that would be something you would want to go.

2555
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Anyway, some of the price options that they're talking about,

2556
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:40,000
as low as 2.99 pounds, which would be about $5 US,

2557
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:44,000
up to $14.99 in the pounds, which would be about $25.

2558
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
That would be a monthly fee.

2559
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
Also, some annual fees listed there,

2560
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:53,000
up between $32 to $160 would be the range there.

2561
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Now, these don't necessarily mean it's true.

2562
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Again, the marketing firm could have come up with some of this,

2563
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
but it means Sony's thinking about it.

2564
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
But at the same time, and I've said this before

2565
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:04,000
when the story's come up before,

2566
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:07,000
it's not like Sony doesn't already have pay for bonus content.

2567
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
It's called Core.

2568
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:10,000
But it's interesting.

2569
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Some of these features they're talking about,

2570
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
especially the token wagering,

2571
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
I want to know more about what that's all about,

2572
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
and the whole subscription-based PS1 classics.

2573
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:20,000
It would be nice if you'd do some PS2 in there as well,

2574
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
being a part of this.

2575
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Loki, do you think some of this might be worth paying for,

2576
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
or are you just saying, yeah, forget it?

2577
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
I'm not paying for any of this crap.

2578
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:31,000
I don't play the PlayStation Network enough as it is,

2579
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
or play on the PlayStation Network.

2580
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
In fact, I don't think I've ever played on the PlayStation Network

2581
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:36,000
with someone else.

2582
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Maybe in Little Big Planet once.

2583
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
But I'm not paying for any of this.

2584
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,000
I'm sorry.

2585
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
It does not seem like anything I'm interested in,

2586
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:44,000
and I don't care how much it is.

2587
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:45,000
I'm not paying for it.

2588
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:46,000
Game Guru says,

2589
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
again, if PlayStation Network goes subscription-based,

2590
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:52,000
there will likely be no reason for gamers to choose it over Xbox Live.

2591
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,000
I don't know.

2592
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
I think you might be jumping the gun a little bit,

2593
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:58,000
because they're not talking about taking anything away.

2594
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
So I don't think they're talking about

2595
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
that now you're going to have to pay to play games online.

2596
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:03,000
I don't think you could...

2597
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
I don't know if that would be possible,

2598
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
because of the games that are already out there.

2599
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
I don't think you could tell those games to suddenly not play online.

2600
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,000
I don't know.

2601
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:14,000
But maybe they're talking about trying to enhance it.

2602
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
And this could all just tie into core.

2603
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
A core membership.

2604
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:19,000
Who knows?

2605
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:22,000
And Nat Elias, I hope I said that right,

2606
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:25,000
says, as long as there's a free alternative, I'm cool with it.

2607
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:28,000
So again, the survey doesn't say anything about taking anything away.

2608
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:31,000
So I don't think PlayStation Network, as you know it today, will change.

2609
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
But maybe they'll just try to get more money out of you

2610
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
by throwing extra stuff your way.

2611
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:36,000
I just don't care.

2612
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:40,000
I'm just not playing that much on the PlayStation Network

2613
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
to where this would be beneficial to me.

2614
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:48,000
I mean, if a PlayStation 3 was all I had, then maybe.

2615
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
But I think people are so used to free now

2616
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:56,000
that trying to get them to pay extra for this might not work.

2617
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
And it obviously is going to be coming,

2618
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
because all these stupid surveys come true.

2619
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
We've seen too many of these now.

2620
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:03,000
Something's coming.

2621
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
And we'll hear about it at E3.

2622
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Yes, we will.

2623
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
All right, we are going to open up the Skype line.

2624
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:11,000
1-877-GAME-OLR is where you can send your phone calls.

2625
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, all one word.

2626
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
If you've never called the show before,

2627
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:21,000
please dial ECHO 1-2-3 first before you give us a call.

2628
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
That's ECHO 1-2-3.

2629
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:26,000
And then that way you can make sure your connection is working right.

2630
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Let's go to the phones.

2631
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2632
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Hi, this is GS68.

2633
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:34,000
Hi, GS68. What's on your mind, buddy?

2634
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:37,000
I got an FC Mobile 2 this weekend.

2635
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:40,000
I just had to give it a try.

2636
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:44,000
My thoughts on it went down the more I played it, to be honest.

2637
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Really?

2638
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Like, for one, the system's pretty thick.

2639
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:51,000
I mean, I'll kind of excuse that,

2640
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:55,000
since it needs the thickness to accommodate the NES cartridges.

2641
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:59,000
But, like, after about playing for about five minutes,

2642
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:02,000
my hands started to get sore.

2643
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:05,000
I could feel the soreness lingering, like,

2644
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
hours after I had played it.

2645
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:10,000
So is it just not, I don't know, ergonomically well-made,

2646
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
or what's the deal?

2647
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:15,000
It's probably just not ergonomically well-made with it being very thick.

2648
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
I see.

2649
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:20,000
And then the D-pad is, like, not too great either.

2650
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Like, for one, it's PSP style D-pad,

2651
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:25,000
and I hate those kind of D-pads.

2652
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Also, the D-pad piece is split in half diagonally.

2653
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:33,000
So sometimes it's more action-type of games,

2654
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:36,000
like Xanax and Legend of Zelda.

2655
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
But on the plus side, that means they can do some weird glitches,

2656
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:41,000
like pressing left and right at the same time in Zelda 2,

2657
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
causing Link to slide around all over the place.

2658
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
Fun.

2659
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:48,000
And then it comes with wireless controllers,

2660
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:51,000
and I tried those, and those were more comfortable to hold,

2661
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:54,000
but I found the D-pads were pretty crappy, too.

2662
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:58,000
Like, instead of having what I call PSP D-pad syndrome,

2663
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
they now have 360 D-pad syndrome,

2664
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
where they have the tendency to press the wrong direction.

2665
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Yeah.

2666
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Boy, those 360 D-pads are pretty terrible.

2667
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Why is it so hard to make a D-pad?

2668
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
That's my question.

2669
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
I don't know.

2670
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
Although, I don't know. I didn't have the same experience as you.

2671
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
I didn't find the D-pad to be that terrible on the FC Mobile,

2672
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
but that's just me.

2673
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:23,000
Maybe the quality varies from unit to unit. I don't know.

2674
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:27,000
I also have really fat thumbs that could play into it. I don't know.

2675
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
No idea.

2676
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
What kind of games are you playing?

2677
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
The classic stuff. I know you said Zelda,

2678
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
but what other classics are you enjoying?

2679
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
I was also playing Xanac,

2680
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:40,000
which is a shoot-em-up by the same people behind the Guardian Legend.

2681
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Nice. Guardian Legend is a must.

2682
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:47,000
Anything else in your gaming week you want to share with us?

2683
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Yeah, I got around to playing Castle of Unity Adventure Reapers.

2684
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Oh, I played that a little bit on Wii, as well. What'd you think?

2685
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:58,000
I like it so far.

2686
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:02,000
I mean, it's about time we finally got a new classic-vania game,

2687
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
as some of the families like to call it.

2688
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Yeah, it feels very much like a classic Castlevania game.

2689
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:11,000
It was like a very Castlevania 3-esque game, which makes sense.

2690
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
It's a remake of the Game Boy games.

2691
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:16,000
But, you know, yeah, I kind of felt the same way.

2692
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:22,000
And what I like is that you can choose between normal jumping and classic jumping.

2693
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:26,000
And, honestly, I like classic jumping better, because when I play normal,

2694
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:30,000
like, jumping things are kind of weird, especially for classic-vania games.

2695
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Like, it tends to throw me off.

2696
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Like, I'll try to...

2697
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:37,000
Like, I'll jump, and I'll press D by the other way and hit the whip button,

2698
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:40,000
so that way I can whip in the opposite direction when I'm jumping,

2699
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:44,000
but I'm moving backwards instead, which kind of throws me off

2700
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:47,000
and causes me to do stuff I didn't intend to do.

2701
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:50,000
It's still challenging, though. Castlevania is still a very challenging game.

2702
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
But, yeah, a lot of folks might have missed that that came out.

2703
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:55,000
There's been a lot of those rebirth-type of games that came out between,

2704
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:59,000
what, Contra, I think, Gradius, and now this Castlevania.

2705
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Oh, and I've been noticing that some people have been complaining

2706
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:05,000
about the lack of a save feature or suspend feature.

2707
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
There is a stage select.

2708
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:11,000
If you go to the tile menu, select Game Start and hold right for a few seconds,

2709
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
and go to Stage Select.

2710
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
Oh, nice. Little pro tip.

2711
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:18,000
That's, like, the type of thing I would have read in Nintendo Power.

2712
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:22,000
All right, well, GS68, have fun with your FC Mobile,

2713
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
and maybe hopefully it'll get a little more comfortable,

2714
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
and good luck with Castlevania.

2715
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:27,000
All right.

2716
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:28,000
All right, take care, buddy.

2717
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:29,000
You too.

2718
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:30,000
Bye-bye.

2719
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
877-GAMO-LR is the number to call her.

2720
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Her username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2721
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
Let's go to the phones.

2722
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2723
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Hey, what's up? It's Rama.

2724
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:43,000
What's up, Rama?

2725
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
Not too much, not too much.

2726
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Call to give a nice little game review.

2727
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Yeah, what game?

2728
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Pop It Music for the Week.

2729
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:54,000
Really? Now, I've heard a lot of kind of bullshit about this game,

2730
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:59,000
but looking at your Twitter, you seem to be a little more positive on this, yeah?

2731
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Yeah, because you have to understand, on the average gamer,

2732
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:05,000
and I've come to determine it, because a lot of these Be Money games,

2733
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:10,000
when people kind of shit on said Be Money game that comes to the U.S.,

2734
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:14,000
9 out of 10, they're just mad because the Japanese music

2735
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:18,000
that they loved in the arcade or import versions out on the U.S. release.

2736
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Okay, I gotcha. You know, I didn't mind.

2737
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:25,000
I thought some of the early DDR releases were kind of crap,

2738
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:28,000
but I think one of the best DDR releases they ever did

2739
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
was one of the American ones, Ultra Mix 2.

2740
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
I think that was probably one of the best DDRs they ever did,

2741
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:35,000
and I don't think BeatMania for the U.S. was terrible.

2742
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
I think they tried to do some cool things with it.

2743
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
It's a bummer they didn't get to do a sequel.

2744
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:43,000
Yeah, I enjoyed BeatMania for PS. I really enjoyed that, so you know.

2745
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
But now Poppin' Music I was a little apprehensive about,

2746
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:50,000
because A, it's the Wii, and B, Beaten Groovy was so fucking terrible,

2747
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:54,000
but how does Poppin' Music make it better?

2748
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:58,000
First things first, we never mention Beaten Groovy again.

2749
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
It's on the list of band names.

2750
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
I apologize.

2751
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:05,000
No problem. Poppin' Music Wii is a little bit different.

2752
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Instead of like 7 and 9 button control, if I remember correctly,

2753
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:15,000
you have 5 button control, and you use the Wiimote and the chuck,

2754
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:21,000
and you have to pretty much shake in a direction in order to hit the colors.

2755
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Now, if you shake the controllers to your side, that's hitting the outer green buttons.

2756
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:32,000
If you shake on like a 45 degree angle, or straight ahead,

2757
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:37,000
you hit the middle blue buttons, and if you move the Wiimote or the chuck

2758
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:42,000
with one, you know, to your left or to your right, you hit the center red button.

2759
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:47,000
Also, if you hit them both together, cross like an X, you can also hit it at the red button as well.

2760
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
That sounds terrible. I'm sorry.

2761
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Well, how does it play? I mean, it might sound bad, but does it play well?

2762
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:58,000
To me, it's kind of like a cross between playing Para Para or Samba de Amigo.

2763
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
I can see the samba. I can see that.

2764
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:05,000
How's the song list? Is it very Japanese-centric, or did they Americanize it? What did they do?

2765
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:11,000
They Americanized it, but there's some downloadable content which does have Japanese songs on it.

2766
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Like, one of my favorite songs is Miracle Moon.

2767
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:19,000
So I'm really excited about getting a chance to download that song, actually.

2768
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Oh, they have download content?

2769
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Yeah.

2770
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Oh, wow. Okay. Cool.

2771
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Are there a lot of songs that longtime Bamani fans will recognize?

2772
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:30,000
I know Miracle Moon, obviously. Other stuff like that?

2773
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:35,000
I don't remember a couple of the other ones, but there are some familiar ones in there.

2774
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:42,000
I did write on my Twitter about some of the bands' names I saw when I was browsing through the downloadable content.

2775
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Is there a lot of downloadable content?

2776
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:59,000
I believe there's like 20 downloadable songs. There's 10 different topics. Each topic has two songs.

2777
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:06,000
And pretty much the majority of them are Japanese songs from pop and music games, and I think BeatMania, but don't hold me to that.

2778
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:13,000
Well, thanks for the reminder that the game was even out, because I forgot, so I guess maybe it's not as bad as a lot of people are saying it's going to be, huh?

2779
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:21,000
Yeah, you gotta thank Twitter for that. If it was for one of my friends who was at best by matching it, I wouldn't have known to go over to go purchase it.

2780
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Interesting. Anything else in your gaming league you want to talk about?

2781
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:34,000
That's pretty much it. I will be playing Lost Odyssey later tonight before I go to bed, but I'll say this much.

2782
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Pop and music was 29. I personally thought it was a good game to purchase. If it was more than that, I probably would not have bothered.

2783
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:54,000
And there's also a two-player and four-player mode. Four-player mode is pretty much you have all nine of the buttons out, and I think four-player mode has all the buttons, but each person takes a remote to hit the correct button.

2784
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
Interesting.

2785
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:57,000
Yeah.

2786
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Alright, well, DJ Rama, we're going to let you go.

2787
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:05,000
I actually wanted to say, I was thinking about you right before you called, seriously.

2788
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
We must be on the same wavelength.

2789
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Seriously, about last time you were here and we went to Japantown.

2790
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Yeah.

2791
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:15,000
I mean, no, not Japantown, where we were at Fonamy.

2792
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Right, yeah.

2793
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:20,000
Because it was something about the dealer's room, and then beep, and you called, and then I forgot what it was.

2794
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:24,000
I thought it was funny.

2795
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:28,000
I'm just reminded when we played on Dance Maniacs together. That was the first time I ever played that.

2796
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:32,000
That game is fun. Crazy fun. I love playing in marathon mode.

2797
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Well, if things go according to plan they show, it may just happen again.

2798
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Hope so.

2799
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Definitely.

2800
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:45,000
Well, we hope to see you soon, DJ Rama, and tell them we'll just rely on the phone calls, okay?

2801
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:46,000
You got it.

2802
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Alright, take care, buddy. Have fun now popping music-ing away.

2803
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:50,000
I will.

2804
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:51,000
Later.

2805
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:54,000
1877 Game OLR username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2806
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:57,000
I guess we'll do about one more call here tonight before we go.

2807
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2808
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:00,000
It's Legend of Zaku.

2809
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Hey, Zaku. What's on your mind, buddy?

2810
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:07,000
Nothing much. Just killing another Sunday evening before going back to work.

2811
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:11,000
I hear you. We don't mind people killing time with us. What's on your mind?

2812
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Nothing much. Just taking care of the usual stuff, the little gems that I found from Consumer Electronics Show regarding gaming.

2813
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Especially the 3D setups that they had for certain games.

2814
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:27,000
What do you think about this whole 3D TV? We talked about it a little bit earlier in the show with Avatar and stuff. What do you think?

2815
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:33,000
I mean, if 3D is going to make a comeback, it better be implemented right this time.

2816
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:37,000
Not that red and blue stuff. Not that red and blue shit.

2817
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:42,000
It has to be 3D that you can actually see in the actual colors.

2818
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:45,000
Well, the technology has come a long way, to be fair.

2819
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:50,000
I mean, you have to keep in mind, not every game is meant for 3D anyways.

2820
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:59,000
Case in point, some of them, like Gran Turismo 5, which they did a tech demo over the course of the Expo where they had it in 3D and it added nothing.

2821
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:02,000
And absolutely nothing to the experience.

2822
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:09,000
Whereas games such as Gears or, I think it was, I want to say it was some other games.

2823
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:16,000
I think one of them, yeah, the new one coming out, Dark Void, that one had a 3D demo, you know, CES.

2824
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:20,000
And that one pretty much made the experience a lot better.

2825
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:24,000
So the mileage may vary, pretty much.

2826
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:28,000
What about Game Room? What did you think about that?

2827
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Oh, the new thing for Xbox Live?

2828
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:40,000
Oh, yeah, I heard about that. I mean, I've been detached from my 360 for quite some time, but I did hear about the...

2829
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:45,000
I don't know, I guess it's just Microsoft trying to emulate home.

2830
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
That's the way I see it.

2831
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
I think it's kind of a combination of home and virtual console.

2832
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:52,000
I hear a lot of people comparing it to home, but I think there's also a lot of virtual console.

2833
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
I think some of the things people have been asking for...

2834
02:24:54,000 --> 02:25:02,000
The way you see it is just them rendering a virtual arcade that Sony could easily dreamt of already baked into their home app.

2835
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:08,000
That's pretty much it. All they're doing, Microsoft is just dressing up and taking from what Sony's already done.

2836
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
And making it better.

2837
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
You know, already in the past.

2838
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:23,000
And another thing I want to talk about, you said earlier that certain phones were designed for the social networking aspects within video games.

2839
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Right now, there's a shift going on within mobile devices.

2840
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:40,000
Obviously, the iPhone was the catalyst for it, but you have platforms like Android, Windows Mobile, Blackberry...

2841
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:45,000
All of them are not your cheap, run-of-the-mills cell phone platform, and they're pretty robust.

2842
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:50,000
I mean, I would know, because I work with most of them professionally.

2843
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:57,000
So their world's better than the phones that I used to work in when I graduated college almost four years ago.

2844
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:04,000
I got that, but again, I look at something like the PSP, which is a dedicated game system, and they still have yet to pull off the...

2845
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:11,000
And I'm not talking about... I get if they build something separate on the phone that ties into the game somehow.

2846
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Again, I give the pub games example.

2847
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:21,000
But this whole, like, you are going to actually... Because in the email it kind of talked about, imagine you're Solid Snake and you can whip out your phone and something happens on your phone.

2848
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:26,000
I'm like, I don't see that level of integration happening on phones, period, yet.

2849
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:29,000
I mean, it can be done. I mean, it all depends on the platform.

2850
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:39,000
Case in point, Android. For example, you can actually run multiple apps, apps that actually support push, that can run while your phone is running in the background.

2851
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:46,000
So let's say you do get an alert from something like you described with Solid Snake.

2852
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:50,000
It will just pop up on your phone, vibrate in it, and inform you.

2853
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:57,000
Same can also be done with iPhone if they opened up the platform and had support for multiple apps.

2854
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:01,000
But Android is a good example of how you can accomplish what you just described.

2855
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:06,000
Hmm. Well, it'll be interesting to see if it takes off. I just don't know.

2856
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:09,000
Especially with the iPhone dominating everything.

2857
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:15,000
If they can pull off Facebook and Twitter and all the other social networking sites on any given mobile platform,

2858
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:25,000
even the good ones like Android or Blackberry, then it can be done. It just has to be executed.

2859
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:33,000
But social networking is not as much bandwidth as a freaking game running video to your phone, you know?

2860
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:37,000
Well, it can be done. You're underestimating the power of cell phones now.

2861
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Perhaps.

2862
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:45,000
Obviously, you would have won the argument several years ago, but the game is different now.

2863
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:57,000
It's a different mobile environment. When you have phones that have tens of megabytes of memory to run apps and high-speed connections and bigger screens.

2864
02:27:57,000 --> 02:28:01,000
I can understand that, and especially Japan has been ahead of the game in that market for a while,

2865
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:05,000
but how much of those really penetrated the entire marketplace?

2866
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:13,000
The G1 is pretty much a good baseline Android phone that's slated to get 2.0, so it still has some fighting in it.

2867
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:19,000
Plus any other Android phone, and obviously the iPhone, the Blackberry, and the Palm Bree.

2868
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:22,000
I'm naming these off my head right now.

2869
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:29,000
So there's a lot that could be done. It's just a matter of the execution and the design.

2870
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:35,000
In other words, it's not impossible, and it shouldn't be ruled out.

2871
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:43,000
It just has to be planned to work well within the confines of how it ought to function.

2872
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:47,000
Alright, I will see you there. I appreciate the perspective.

2873
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:52,000
I won't say it's impossible, but I'll still say probably not anytime soon.

2874
02:28:52,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Anytime soon is very close right now. When Android comes very close to second place behind the iPhone,

2875
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:10,000
you'll have the install base and the wherewithal to execute it, even with Blackberries out there.

2876
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:16,000
By the end of this year, I should have won the argument, more or less.

2877
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:20,000
We shall see, and if I'm wrong, then I'm wrong. It sounds like it'll be a good thing for gaming.

2878
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
If Rob's wrong, he has to wear the tingle costume.

2879
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Fuck that shit. No way.

2880
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:28,000
I mean, right now, you're probably going to get a refresh anyways with a new model,

2881
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:33,000
so they may end up selling you a Blackberry or an Android phone or something like that.

2882
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:37,000
And those are very powerful. Those are much powerful than your standard run-of-the-mill.

2883
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:41,000
Alright. Alright, well, Zachary, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up,

2884
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
but thanks so much for the call, okay? We appreciate the other perspective.

2885
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:44,000
Alright, have a good one.

2886
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:45,000
Good luck. Later.

2887
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Bye.

2888
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:49,000
Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight. Sorry to those that didn't get through.

2889
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Something else occurred to me?

2890
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:51,000
Yeah, what's up?

2891
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:55,000
You know, there are actually regular cell phones that would be powerful enough to do stuff like that in Japan.

2892
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:58,000
Well, yeah, but, you know, not anything I'm going to see.

2893
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:06,000
But there's been a tendency now for companies to compete with the smartphones by implementing some of the stuff they've got out in the K-tie already, so...

2894
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:11,000
I get what he's saying, that it's possible, but unfortunately, you know, I just, I don't,

2895
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:15,000
I guess he seems to think it's going to happen a lot sooner than I'm giving it credit for.

2896
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Maybe the technology's moving a little faster than I'm thinking,

2897
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:25,000
but I kind of go, you know, you have to have a lot of people who are going to use it in order to make it effective to build, if that makes sense.

2898
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:26,000
That makes sense.

2899
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:27,000
That's my little concern.

2900
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
But I get what Zaku's saying.

2901
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:36,000
He's saying probably I'm not giving the technical side of it enough appreciation, so, and maybe the way it came off I wasn't, so that's fair enough.

2902
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:39,000
Alright, anyhow, that's going to do it for tonight's show.

2903
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:42,000
Once we do last minute stories, I want to skip those.

2904
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:45,000
Dark Soccer, Loki, any of you guys have last minute stories tonight?

2905
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
Or do we cover it all?

2906
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:50,000
The Mega Man fan movie's going to be coming out soon.

2907
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:55,000
This was shown off in a trailer back in November 2008.

2908
02:30:55,000 --> 02:31:03,000
And apparently it will be coming out, available on the internet soon enough.

2909
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:12,000
I'm trying to see when exactly, it's going to be, it's going to be 109 minutes long.

2910
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:22,000
And I guess it will be available probably on the website for the film, which is megaman.ninjin.com.

2911
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
That's N-I-N-G-I-N.

2912
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:29,000
And they actually have some stuff from that.

2913
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:33,000
I guess it was being shown at MAGFest 2010.

2914
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:38,000
It was a rough cut that they showed, and that happened actually today.

2915
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:42,000
So, um, soon enough I guess.

2916
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:43,000
It looks kind of interesting.

2917
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:49,000
The guy that had been playing Wily though kind of looks, looks like he needs to wash his face.

2918
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:52,000
Are they going to learn anything from the Zelda experience?

2919
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:55,000
I'm just saying, like, you know, do you think maybe there's going to be a problem?

2920
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:59,000
That Nintendo or Capcom in this case will say,

2921
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:04,000
Hey, pull this off the internet, and then it will actually still be on the internet, and nothing will be accomplished.

2922
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:07,000
Yep, I'm sure they'll learn a lot from that.

2923
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:10,000
Fine.

2924
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
I see your point.

2925
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:16,000
Nothing will happen.

2926
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:17,000
Is that it?

2927
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:20,000
Um, this is kind of interesting.

2928
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:35,000
There was a comment, I guess, Gamasutra ran a feature on third-party publisher reactions to the abysmal sales of uninteresting games, or various party games.

2929
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:38,000
One of the comments was, one thing for sure, the focus has changed.

2930
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:49,000
Stores like Target and Best Buy have reportedly told game publishers not to even bother approaching them with collections of minigames, which they will no longer pick up.

2931
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:52,000
Good for them!

2932
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:57,000
I think that's a great thing, and you know, honestly, I've been seeing a lot more of that just from my customers.

2933
02:32:57,000 --> 02:33:01,000
And honestly, I kind of figured that anyways, and I steer them away from that crap.

2934
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
Only good stuff.

2935
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:12,000
But sadly enough though, even the good stuff I recommend, like the No More Heroes and that kind of thing, in Madworld, just doesn't do well.

2936
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:17,000
That's a bummer, because stupid parents out there want to buy that fucking minigame crap.

2937
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:20,000
This is what's wrong with gaming nowadays.

2938
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
The Wii, the Wii is everything that is wrong with gaming.

2939
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
The Wii ruined everything!

2940
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:25,000
Exactly.

2941
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:29,000
But they still have, you know, there's certain games that come out on the Wii that you have to have.

2942
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:33,000
Like, I feel justified owning a Wii, because there is some real good shit that comes out for it.

2943
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:36,000
Like New Super Mario Bros. Wii was fantastic.

2944
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:39,000
Crazy stuff.

2945
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:43,000
Hey, one of our chatters is calling us in on a last minute story, and actually this is something I do remember reading.

2946
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
I just neglected to put it on the show the night.

2947
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:48,000
But Jay Dizzle in our chatroom at chat.orangessontraday.com is saying,

2948
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:51,000
Crayon physics is on sale till the 15th.

2949
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:52,000
You can pay as much as you want.

2950
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:55,000
It's doing that whole thing where you can pay what you feel the game is worth.

2951
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
You got some people paying a penny for it.

2952
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Maybe they're hoping some people will pay $150.

2953
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:03,000
You know, like happened, I think, when World of Goo did that.

2954
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:08,000
So, you know, I would say maybe like $5, $10, whatever you believe is appropriate.

2955
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:12,000
Or maybe I'll probably go buy it and pay $6.66.

2956
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
I think that would be fun.

2957
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
Or $6.90.

2958
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:20,000
No, you should pay $4.20.

2959
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
$5.37.

2960
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Anything? Oh, $5.30.

2961
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:25,000
$5.73.

2962
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
Let's see what you did there.

2963
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:28,000
Nice.

2964
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
Any other last minute stories tonight, Loki?

2965
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:31,000
That's it.

2966
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:32,000
All right.

2967
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:33,000
That's going to do it.

2968
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:37,000
We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts before we wrap it up tonight.

2969
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
So, Dark Soccer, what's your final thought tonight?

2970
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:43,000
I finally learned to knit a scarf without messing up my rows.

2971
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Congrats.

2972
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
See, it doesn't look nice.

2973
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:50,000
My final thought is LA tomorrow, Seattle Friday.

2974
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
I've got a busy week ahead.

2975
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:53,000
Loki, your final thought?

2976
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:57,000
My final thought is I wish people would stop quitting out of my games on Grand Theft Auto.

2977
02:34:57,000 --> 02:35:02,000
And, you know, I don't know what I've got to do.

2978
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:03,000
I'm even nice.

2979
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:09,000
Usually when I'm like $1,000 ahead, I'll just fuck around so that, you know, at least I'm not, like, pissing people off.

2980
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:12,000
Although there was at one time that I was trying to get a high streak.

2981
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
I got a 17 streak.

2982
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:17,000
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2983
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and downloading our show and supporting it.

2984
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:23,000
Remember, if you like what you hear, all we ask, tell a couple friends about the show.

2985
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:28,000
Help us spread the word because we don't have big budget dollars to advertise and all that stuff about our show.

2986
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
So, we really appreciate the word of mouth.

2987
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:31,000
Really appreciate it.

2988
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:38,000
I'm also being asked to remind you guys that our buddies at Understation Live are collecting the top 25 games of all time.

2989
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:44,000
So, please, if you have a little time today, make a top 25 list of your favorite games of all time.

2990
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
No criteria, but what is your favorite?

2991
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:54,000
And email them to uslmadness, that's u-s-l-m-a-d-n-e-s-s at gmail.com and help our buddies out over at Understation Live.

2992
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:57,000
Remember a programming note, there is no show next week.

2993
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:00,000
Podcast listeners, you will see a new show in two weeks.

2994
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:09,000
And for those of you that do listen live, it will be 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern, which means 6 o'clock London and Greenwich.

2995
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:12,000
So, you overseas folks are hopefully in for a treat.

2996
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:15,000
I want lots of accents next week on the Skype line.

2997
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:16,000
One more plot though, remember.

2998
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:17,000
Yeah, yes, please.

2999
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:29,000
Tara and I are doing, or Maron Marvel and I are doing a podcast, although we may or may not have one this week, for Monday Comics Mania, which you can see at AvengersTowerAllInWord.com.

3000
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
Oh my god, comics.

3001
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:34,000
Yeah, you get to hear Rob's cameo.

3002
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:35,000
Very nice.

3003
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:39,000
When do I get to come be a guest on the show and I'll talk about, I don't know, I'll go, I'll read, you know what I will do?

3004
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:43,000
One week I will read a comic, just so I can actually be on your show.

3005
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
Get to my house early.

3006
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:46,000
Alright, fair enough.

3007
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:51,000
Alright, that's it guys. Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting us. We really appreciate it.

3008
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:56,000
Hey, have a great couple of weeks. We'll be back. There will be a show on the feed on the 24th.

3009
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
And again, for those of you guys that want to listen early, we'll be here.

3010
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:04,000
Stay tuned to our Twitter, our Facebook for all of the updates and AllGames.com should be running copies of that too.

3011
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:07,000
