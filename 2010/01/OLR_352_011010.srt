1
00:00:15,435 --> 00:00:15,716
[SPEAKER_07]: to 2010.

2
00:00:16,377 --> 00:00:24,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft shows us their game room at CES, a popular Nintendo Wii game is no longer being published, and could NBA Jam be making a comeback?

3
00:00:31,192 --> 00:00:31,793
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

4
00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:50,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Frustrated.

5
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:51,434
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry to hear that.

6
00:00:51,474 --> 00:00:52,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are you frustrated?

7
00:00:52,454 --> 00:00:56,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I realized that I started stitching in two wide stitches.

8
00:00:56,977 --> 00:01:01,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, stitches too many on this tube scarf I was making.

9
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:04,440
[SPEAKER_05]: So now I have a doll-sized tube dress.

10
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:08,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, if you decide that you don't want it, you could always set it on fire.

11
00:01:08,863 --> 00:01:09,743
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be pretty amazing.

12
00:01:10,223 --> 00:01:12,444
[SPEAKER_05]: But that would mean setting my stuff on fire.

13
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:15,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, at least you could watch it go down in a blaze of glory.

14
00:01:17,293 --> 00:01:20,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Also say hello to the one and only Pyromaniac Techmaster Loki!

15
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:20,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

16
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:21,561
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you?

17
00:01:22,242 --> 00:01:22,863
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm fine.

18
00:01:22,903 --> 00:01:24,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you set fire to anything this week?

19
00:01:25,611 --> 00:01:26,771
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not this time.

20
00:01:52,657 --> 00:01:53,437
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

21
00:02:11,906 --> 00:02:14,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Translation, give us jobs.

22
00:02:15,228 --> 00:02:16,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Professional jobs.

23
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:17,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing.

24
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,413
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't hang out a lot like we used to during the week.

25
00:02:22,493 --> 00:02:24,514
[SPEAKER_10]: This show is kind of the way we all hang out.

26
00:02:25,095 --> 00:02:27,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Once in a while, there's a party or something's going on.

27
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,518
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like we avoid each other.

28
00:02:29,538 --> 00:02:30,818
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just we're all busy.

29
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:31,879
[SPEAKER_10]: I work a day job.

30
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:34,181
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura has school and other things she's got to do.

31
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:34,601
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm avoiding you.

32
00:02:36,195 --> 00:02:42,120
[SPEAKER_10]: and Loki just bought a house and they both have the married life going on and I'm driving to the Bay Area for stuff all the time.

33
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:44,482
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't see each other an awful lot during the week.

34
00:02:45,103 --> 00:02:46,444
[SPEAKER_10]: But this week was a little different.

35
00:02:46,504 --> 00:02:48,106
[SPEAKER_10]: We actually went on an OLR date.

36
00:02:49,417 --> 00:03:17,790
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, myself, and Loki all went to see Avatar as many of you have apparently because it's already like the number three highest grossing movie ever and it looks like based on the take this week there's a very good chance it's going to take over the Batman movie they're saying it could even take over Titanic so a lot of you have seen the movie so I don't know if we're going to sit here and review it because most of you have already seen it it sounds like but how about our thoughts on the movie because we did get to see it in 3D

37
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:23,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Which I thought was, you know, kind of different because I don't see a lot of movies in 3D.

38
00:03:23,274 --> 00:03:24,335
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's kind of a new thing.

39
00:03:24,655 --> 00:03:29,039
[SPEAKER_10]: The only other movie I've seen in 3D was Up, which, you know, didn't use the 3D as heavily.

40
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:34,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I didn't think the 3D kind of added a lot to Up, but certainly Avatar kind of added some stuff to it.

41
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:35,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, what did you think of Avatar?

42
00:03:35,724 --> 00:03:36,965
[SPEAKER_10]: This is your second time seeing it, right?

43
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:37,786
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it is.

44
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:43,330
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, keep it spoiler free because some of our chatters have not seen it yet and want to.

45
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:45,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you seen Pocahontas?

46
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,480
[SPEAKER_09]: You've seen Avatar.

47
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,341
[SPEAKER_09]: I call it Space Pocahontas.

48
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:50,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Ferngully.

49
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:54,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Ferngully meets Pocahontas in space with Smurfs.

50
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:59,924
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I like just... Even the technology behind the whole movie is pretty awesome.

51
00:03:59,984 --> 00:04:08,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a lot of the 3D stuff, it's not so much, you know, Hey, look, we made a 3D movie, so we're going to have tons of stuff flying at your face.

52
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:09,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Or, you know...

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,162
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

54
00:04:27,697 --> 00:04:28,537
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, what did you think?

55
00:04:28,557 --> 00:04:31,879
[SPEAKER_09]: I had very low expectations and then my expectations were sort of pooped on.

56
00:04:55,549 --> 00:04:56,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was really good.

57
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:21,466
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that the 3D was implemented very, very nicely.

58
00:05:21,526 --> 00:05:28,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of, like Loki said, of it being 3D, it was more immersive.

59
00:05:29,048 --> 00:05:40,110
[SPEAKER_05]: There were a few things, though, that did surprise me as far as just... I really have no other comparison to put this to, but the head tracking mode for Wii, that little hack...

60
00:05:40,690 --> 00:06:07,664
[SPEAKER_05]: it made me think of that because it almost felt sometimes like you could peek around the screen and see stuff inside of it or if you moved closer you'd get a wider view it was that kind of immersion and it actually did not give me a headache because the other movies I've seen in 3D was I saw Nightmare Before Christmas twice in IMAX in 3D and that gave me kind of a headache and made me pass out I was explaining that I have a problem with 3D because I tend to get really motion sick

61
00:06:08,684 --> 00:06:14,770
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I think I only got motion sick once, and that was in the flying, one of the big flying scenes.

62
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:35,648
[SPEAKER_05]: And, other than that, I mean, especially since I wear glasses and was wearing the 3D glasses over my glasses, I didn't really have as bad of a problem as I expected to, except when I took the 3D glasses off, I had a big adjustment because, you know, I'm looking through two lenses trying to get the 3D effect out of it.

63
00:06:36,328 --> 00:06:38,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Story-wise, yeah, predictable.

64
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:46,071
[SPEAKER_05]: We saw this coming, but it was predictable in a gratifying way, I want to say, if that makes sense.

65
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:50,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a little bit more than what I thought would happen with it.

66
00:06:51,172 --> 00:06:52,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's how that should go.

67
00:06:52,672 --> 00:06:54,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm fine with that.

68
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:56,533
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked it.

69
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I was already looking up stuff online.

70
00:06:58,374 --> 00:06:59,094
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be a sequel.

71
00:07:00,134 --> 00:07:27,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I'm looking forward to Although I'm wondering what direction they're going to go with it But yeah, actually I'm really impressed As a language nerd, I was very impressed with the construction of the language Yeah, I guess they built that language for the movie Like some professor at a university did it Yeah, a linguistics professor created the language And it actually, with some of the other ones that I've studied It uses, actually the grammar structure is very similar to American Sign Language

72
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:35,684
[SPEAKER_05]: and I noticed it actually has things in common with Japanese and with American Sign Language in terms of your object order.

73
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:38,786
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was actually pretty pleased with that.

74
00:07:40,207 --> 00:07:45,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Reading just so much more into it, I have to say that I'm impressed overall with the work that went into it.

75
00:07:46,391 --> 00:07:52,195
[SPEAKER_05]: And with the fluidity of the motion capture, that was very impressive and I know that that was a pretty new technology that they used with it too.

76
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:57,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I also went back and read an interview as to why people were blue.

77
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:08,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, and to paraphrase the quote, it's that, well, it was to contrast with the skin tones of humans, first of all, to enhance the bioluminescence, because everything on the planet was bioluminescent.

78
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:11,549
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, because they'd already done Little Green Men.

79
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,011
[SPEAKER_05]: They wanted them to be blue.

80
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:14,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

81
00:08:14,532 --> 00:08:14,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

82
00:08:14,992 --> 00:08:24,280
[SPEAKER_05]: So, overall, I have to say, I like a movie that a lot of thought and energy had been put into, and it was very clear that a lot of work went into this, and you could see it in the final production, so...

83
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,289
[SPEAKER_05]: And that and I wanted to punch that guy in the face.

84
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:32,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the Marine.

85
00:08:32,873 --> 00:08:33,473
[SPEAKER_10]: The Colonel guy.

86
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:36,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because he actually, he's what I expected him to be.

87
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,638
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted no redemption out of him.

88
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not trying to spoil anything.

89
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,120
[SPEAKER_05]: I know most of you have seen it.

90
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:43,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted no redemption out of him.

91
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:46,524
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted him to be a hard ass to the end and he sure was.

92
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:48,926
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was the corporate guy.

93
00:08:49,246 --> 00:08:52,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you could almost see him thinking about it.

94
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,290
[SPEAKER_05]: and then, ooh, dollars.

95
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:58,031
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've seen him in other stuff and I can't think of what.

96
00:08:59,011 --> 00:08:59,892
[SPEAKER_10]: You gotta IMDB it.

97
00:09:00,232 --> 00:09:01,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

98
00:09:01,912 --> 00:09:06,033
[SPEAKER_10]: You might remember, I kind of came out before this movie and I was like, I just hope it tanks.

99
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:13,515
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, it looks terrible from the trailer and James Cameron's kind of an arrogant ass and, you know, just after Titanic, I just kind of wanted to see the movie tank.

100
00:09:14,295 --> 00:09:16,216
[SPEAKER_10]: So I went in with very low expectations.

101
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I was kind of like DarkSakura.

102
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:17,476
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like...

103
00:09:18,116 --> 00:09:19,277
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, what the hell?

104
00:09:19,577 --> 00:09:20,098
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll go.

105
00:09:20,218 --> 00:09:21,899
[SPEAKER_10]: I got three hours to kill.

106
00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:23,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go see the damn movie.

107
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:25,102
[SPEAKER_10]: I was wrong.

108
00:09:25,402 --> 00:09:26,342
[SPEAKER_10]: It was good.

109
00:09:26,663 --> 00:09:27,924
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a good movie.

110
00:09:28,524 --> 00:09:29,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Props to Cameron.

111
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:30,406
[SPEAKER_10]: You did it again.

112
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:31,827
[SPEAKER_10]: It was good.

113
00:09:32,307 --> 00:09:36,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it like OMG Oscar-winning story and all this?

114
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:37,091
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

115
00:09:37,151 --> 00:09:39,713
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the story you've kind of heard before, but it's effective.

116
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:56,524
[SPEAKER_10]: and I know here we are a video game podcast talking about movies but I want to kind of bring this back to video games a little bit because honestly I kind of thought the movie was just a giant video game like the graphics were really good in Avatar you know and that's kind of one of the things I was like wow the landscape is really pretty the um the

117
00:09:57,404 --> 00:10:01,568
[SPEAKER_10]: The way the Navi were done was really pretty, and just everything about the movie was really, really pretty.

118
00:10:02,108 --> 00:10:08,954
[SPEAKER_10]: And so the game had great graphics, and even the story, I gotta be honest, the story, without getting into spoilery, I was really reminded of Final Fantasy VII.

119
00:10:09,395 --> 00:10:17,502
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a lot of tie-ins to me with Final Fantasy VII, and you have to admit, there was an epic boss battle at the end of the movie, which is to be expected.

120
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:18,382
[SPEAKER_05]: It really was epic.

121
00:10:18,462 --> 00:10:21,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, that guy, I actually remember him from My Name is Earl.

122
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:22,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, there you go.

123
00:10:24,132 --> 00:10:25,613
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was very epic.

124
00:10:25,913 --> 00:10:37,379
[SPEAKER_10]: I think in some ways, and this is going to sound like a much bigger compliment than maybe the movie actually deserves, but I actually think in some ways, this movie is going to be like this generation's Wizard of Oz.

125
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:41,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if you think about it, the Wizard of Oz was actually not like...

126
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:53,077
[SPEAKER_10]: That great of a movie, but it's one of those ones we kind of all remember because it was that musical that we all remember, and it was that color.

127
00:10:53,097 --> 00:10:56,119
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the first color movie we all kind of remember.

128
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, not all of us were alive when that movie first came out, but it meant a lot for color.

129
00:11:00,542 --> 00:11:05,925
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think Avatar is going to be a lot of that for 3D, even though it might not be the best or most original story in the world.

130
00:11:06,526 --> 00:11:11,589
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they're going to look back on this years from now and say, this is when 3D started being a big thing.

131
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,752
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kind of, I'm a little worried about it, because I gotta say, the 3D kind of bugged me.

132
00:11:18,212 --> 00:11:26,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, it wasn't, and I didn't think it was gimmicky or anything like that, but the 3D bugged me because I had to take those glasses off, like, every 10 minutes, because I actually was, like, hurting my eyes.

133
00:11:27,296 --> 00:11:29,396
[SPEAKER_10]: And the same thing kind of happened when I was watching Up.

134
00:11:29,496 --> 00:11:32,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I just, I can't sit there and do the 3D the whole time.

135
00:11:33,138 --> 00:11:34,598
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of a pain in my eyes.

136
00:11:35,099 --> 00:11:40,601
[SPEAKER_10]: So, that was the only, I mean, it looked nice, don't get me wrong, and I thought it definitely was kind of like something I haven't seen before, but

137
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:41,541
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

138
00:11:56,969 --> 00:11:58,190
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

139
00:12:13,888 --> 00:12:16,770
[SPEAKER_10]: But they're talking about ESPN and 3D and all this stuff.

140
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:22,614
[SPEAKER_10]: I realize nobody's going to make me tune to that network, but it's definitely kind of the wave of the future.

141
00:12:23,335 --> 00:12:25,116
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope they find a way to make it less painful.

142
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:28,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Go to our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

143
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:32,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Alpha Cananogram says, Sky said the game had good graphics.

144
00:12:32,322 --> 00:12:32,842
[SPEAKER_10]: LMFAO.

145
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:33,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, seriously, I...

146
00:12:34,523 --> 00:12:36,684
[SPEAKER_10]: I found the movie to be very much like a video game.

147
00:12:36,724 --> 00:12:39,345
[SPEAKER_10]: It was kind of a cliche plot, but it was executed very well.

148
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:41,186
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not saying it was executed very, very well.

149
00:12:41,526 --> 00:12:42,987
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually think, what's her name?

150
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:46,748
[SPEAKER_10]: That Zoe Saladona, the one that was Uhura in Star Trek.

151
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:49,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, she should get nominated for an Oscar.

152
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:50,770
[SPEAKER_10]: I honestly mean that.

153
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,511
[SPEAKER_10]: She was amazingly good.

154
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,332
[SPEAKER_10]: And Sigourney Weaver, oh my god.

155
00:12:55,672 --> 00:12:56,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Love her.

156
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,694
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have to tell you, the full thing is going to be in the DVD, right?

157
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:01,895
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think there was one in Titanic.

158
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:02,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but Aliens High.

159
00:13:30,385 --> 00:13:32,448
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway, reading some other comments from chat.

160
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,070
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100Matt says, Terminator 2.

161
00:13:34,551 --> 00:13:35,452
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't go that far.

162
00:13:35,572 --> 00:13:38,896
[SPEAKER_10]: It was okay, but I don't see it lasting the test of time like Wizard of Oz.

163
00:13:40,215 --> 00:13:41,376
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's too early to say.

164
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:47,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, I don't think people are going to go back and go, oh, this is just a phenomenal fucking movie, like the Lord of the Rings will be.

165
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,001
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they're going to look back on that a long time.

166
00:13:49,021 --> 00:13:49,281
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

167
00:13:49,301 --> 00:14:00,609
[SPEAKER_09]: I went back to The Wizard of Oz after a while because I used to like that movie, and I find it really grating on my ears now, and just a really annoying, awful movie.

168
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:06,873
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know if Wizard of Oz has lasted the test of time either because you watch it and you're like...

169
00:14:07,754 --> 00:14:08,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Return to Oz was based off the books.

170
00:14:08,976 --> 00:14:10,818
[SPEAKER_09]: As they should do some more movies based off the books.

171
00:14:23,994 --> 00:14:27,576
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says also, I don't think the 3D added all that much to it.

172
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,417
[SPEAKER_10]: It was nice without it.

173
00:14:28,677 --> 00:14:29,477
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I kind of agree.

174
00:14:29,517 --> 00:14:32,259
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I would have still felt the same about the movie had I seen it in 2D.

175
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:35,881
[SPEAKER_10]: But 3D did give that little extra kick.

176
00:14:36,161 --> 00:14:39,143
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that little extra wow factor that really brought the...

177
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,824
[SPEAKER_10]: and graphics, so to speak, home.

178
00:14:43,024 --> 00:14:44,564
[SPEAKER_10]: That planet was beautiful.

179
00:14:45,144 --> 00:14:46,525
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm actually excited to play the game.

180
00:14:46,725 --> 00:14:49,645
[SPEAKER_10]: And sure enough, Loki managed to... Not only did he get us free tickets to the movie.

181
00:14:49,665 --> 00:14:50,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much, Loki.

182
00:14:50,426 --> 00:14:50,926
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate it.

183
00:14:51,306 --> 00:14:53,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Now he scrounged up a copy of Avatar the Game on PlayStation 3.

184
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:58,067
[SPEAKER_10]: So DarkSakura and I are going to kind of trade it back and forth since I'm going to be traveling this next week.

185
00:14:58,087 --> 00:14:59,448
[SPEAKER_10]: She's going to borrow it and then I'm going to take it.

186
00:14:59,468 --> 00:15:01,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Too bad you don't have a 3D TV because that isn't 3D if you have a 3D TV.

187
00:15:01,428 --> 00:15:01,988
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I hear.

188
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:02,508
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

189
00:15:02,608 --> 00:15:03,289
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll pass anyway.

190
00:15:04,609 --> 00:15:06,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, I think that my TV's capable.

191
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:08,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have the glasses for it?

192
00:15:09,577 --> 00:15:11,760
[SPEAKER_05]: I stole the ones from the theater.

193
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:19,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Different TVs have different 3D, unless your TV supports RealD, then those glasses will work with that.

194
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:24,594
[SPEAKER_09]: If they don't, or if it doesn't, then you may need shutter glasses or something like that.

195
00:15:24,774 --> 00:15:29,299
[SPEAKER_05]: We've actually got shutter glasses for the Master System.

196
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,141
[SPEAKER_10]: In the theater, though.

197
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:55,594
[SPEAKER_10]: 3D and Coraline was awesome.

198
00:15:55,874 --> 00:15:58,536
[SPEAKER_10]: They did the same type of thing they did in Avatar, right?

199
00:15:58,596 --> 00:16:00,238
[SPEAKER_10]: The real 3D or whatever it's called, right?

200
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:05,122
[SPEAKER_09]: I think real D would be the best option because those shutter glasses are expensive.

201
00:16:05,142 --> 00:16:06,403
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like $200 a piece.

202
00:16:06,483 --> 00:16:10,327
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're going to get some for your friends and stuff like that, forget about it.

203
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:14,931
[SPEAKER_09]: But real D, those glasses are so damn cheap to manufacture.

204
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:18,374
[SPEAKER_09]: It's almost as cheap as the red-blue glasses, but

205
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,329
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

206
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:43,397
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever they do with the home version, whether it be the Red Blue or the Real D, but you'd have to have a TV.

207
00:16:43,457 --> 00:16:47,201
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what the hell they're going to do.

208
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,622
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it will come over to games.

209
00:16:49,002 --> 00:16:51,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Where the movie goes, games will soon go.

210
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:57,932
[SPEAKER_10]: And this might be something that's in the PlayStation 4, the Xbox 720, and whatever other hypothetical system you want to come up with.

211
00:16:58,933 --> 00:16:59,914
[SPEAKER_10]: I just kind of hope...

212
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:08,204
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, they find a way to make it easier on the eyes and that they don't rely on it as a crutch, that it gets too gimmicky.

213
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:12,667
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's going to be the gimmick for the first year it comes out.

214
00:17:13,127 --> 00:17:17,450
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to overdo it with everything and then they're going to slack back off just like with everything else.

215
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:17,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, like the Wii.

216
00:17:19,651 --> 00:17:19,931
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

217
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:21,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's talk about our gaming weeks.

218
00:17:21,992 --> 00:17:22,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Enough movies.

219
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:24,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's actually talk about the video games we've been playing this week.

220
00:17:24,774 --> 00:17:26,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Dark Sakura, what kind of games have you been playing this week?

221
00:17:27,534 --> 00:17:29,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, mostly watching Dan play Borderlands.

222
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:37,042
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Luminous on Steam, and then was very disappointed to realize that Shining wasn't in it.

223
00:17:38,103 --> 00:17:39,684
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, Peggle.

224
00:17:40,065 --> 00:17:45,709
[SPEAKER_05]: I finally beat one of those crappy extra point levels, you know, that I was yelling at.

225
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:52,095
[SPEAKER_05]: And once I did it, I actually managed to beat another one after that, but now I'm on the million point level, and I'm like, oh, whatever.

226
00:17:52,915 --> 00:17:53,095
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

227
00:17:56,018 --> 00:18:02,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I've got Silent Hill Shattered Memories, but I haven't had a chance to play it because, again, I haven't been able to get Dan's butt off of Borderlands.

228
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:06,743
[SPEAKER_05]: And he hasn't got me Bayonetta yet, which makes me weep.

229
00:18:08,204 --> 00:18:09,845
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got to get him to get that for you.

230
00:18:10,545 --> 00:18:10,786
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

231
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:13,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

232
00:18:14,189 --> 00:18:15,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Real quick to go back to what we were talking about before.

233
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember how they were talking about 3D TV at CES?

234
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:23,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the format that they're kind of working towards is RealD, actually.

235
00:18:24,011 --> 00:18:25,211
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be kind of cool.

236
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:31,593
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're, I guess, partnering with Sony, JVC, Samsung, Toshiba, Panasonic, and DirecTV.

237
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:36,714
[SPEAKER_09]: So... That would be the best way to go, I think.

238
00:18:36,874 --> 00:18:38,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, like I said, glasses are cheap.

239
00:18:40,615 --> 00:18:41,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Non-intrusive.

240
00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:42,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, so games.

241
00:18:42,615 --> 00:18:42,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

242
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:48,110
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually got to play some of the stuff I've been meaning to play and putting off for a while.

243
00:18:48,531 --> 00:18:51,451
[SPEAKER_09]: I finally played Borderlands and it's awesome.

244
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:53,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Very fun game.

245
00:18:53,512 --> 00:18:55,893
[SPEAKER_09]: I've actually played it for a few hours.

246
00:18:55,933 --> 00:19:02,355
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm only like level 7 right now, but I did finish killing Nineto, which is one of the characters in the game.

247
00:19:03,155 --> 00:19:25,437
[SPEAKER_09]: and, um, I don't know, the game itself reminds me a lot of, um, Final Fantasy XI with guns, because a lot of the enemies and stuff, they have, like, certain spawn points in the game, and it just, like, you see them kind of just wandering around and stuff like that, like you would in Final Fantasy VII, just without all the other people running around with you, and you have kind of different zones you can kind of zone into to, um...

248
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:28,480
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

249
00:19:52,765 --> 00:19:53,146
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura

250
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:15,861
[SPEAKER_09]: but it's just, it's really cool and I'm really disappointed that it took me so long to play the game but I definitely will be playing it for a long time and probably will download the download content later on as soon as I get a little further in the game.

251
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Must play The Island of Dr. Ned.

252
00:20:18,763 --> 00:20:21,564
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about shooting brains out of their skulls.

253
00:20:22,425 --> 00:20:23,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

254
00:20:23,886 --> 00:20:24,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

255
00:20:24,146 --> 00:20:26,087
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys are making me want to play this game very badly.

256
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:26,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it, Rob.

257
00:20:26,807 --> 00:20:27,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Play it.

258
00:20:27,287 --> 00:20:28,607
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't play it, you know.

259
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:33,629
[SPEAKER_10]: When I talk about my gaming week, I'll tell you why I can't play Borderlands yet because I'm too distracted.

260
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:36,990
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing is non-gaming.

261
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I've also been playing Grand Theft Auto.

262
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:49,513
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually played some Grand Theft Auto this weekend because I was trying to just play some more online games just with some other people other than my coworkers and stuff because I've been kicking the crap out of my coworkers a lot.

263
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:50,033
[SPEAKER_09]: So modest.

264
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,760
[SPEAKER_09]: and a lot of them dropped.

265
00:21:15,961 --> 00:21:26,064
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's even people that were blatantly cheating using lag switches and turbo controllers and stuff like that and I still kicked the crap out of them.

266
00:21:27,585 --> 00:21:29,786
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what to do and everybody keeps dropping.

267
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:32,907
[SPEAKER_09]: I really hate that everybody drops out of the games.

268
00:21:33,867 --> 00:21:36,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, just try a little bit.

269
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:41,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you'll learn something and get a little bit better instead of just quitting because you just can't seem to kill somebody.

270
00:21:43,851 --> 00:21:44,171
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

271
00:21:44,696 --> 00:22:09,991
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever but um so yeah I've been I've been working my way up the ranks um right now I think I'm in the I know I'm in the top 300 on um Lost and Damned out of ranked death matches um probably up 250 by now but I've been working my way up to number one so uh hopefully I'll hit that at some point I know I'm you know up there whereas my other co-workers are in the 700s to 1000s so um

272
00:22:14,189 --> 00:22:22,718
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just looking for a challenge out there, and I really hope that people that play online would stop dropping, because it's ridiculous and very frustrating.

273
00:22:22,738 --> 00:22:34,171
[SPEAKER_09]: And, let's see, other than Xbox 360 stuff, I worked on the cabinet a little bit more, played a little bit of tubing this week, because...

274
00:22:35,086 --> 00:22:36,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Jim came over and he wanted to play Tubin.

275
00:22:37,288 --> 00:22:40,330
[SPEAKER_09]: So I tried that and man, that's hard to control.

276
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:43,432
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot how hard that game was.

277
00:22:44,152 --> 00:22:44,993
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was kind of cool.

278
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:50,677
[SPEAKER_09]: And then next week I should be getting some Xbox 360 repair kits for the Red Ring of Death stuff.

279
00:22:51,117 --> 00:22:52,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Mainly just because I didn't really want to send out.

280
00:22:53,118 --> 00:22:56,781
[SPEAKER_09]: I have like six systems just waiting to be repaired.

281
00:22:57,882 --> 00:22:59,503
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them I can actually send back to Microsoft.

282
00:22:59,523 --> 00:23:01,204
[SPEAKER_09]: The other few of them...

283
00:23:02,935 --> 00:23:04,696
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just going to try to repair it real quick.

284
00:23:04,837 --> 00:23:08,960
[SPEAKER_09]: If it doesn't work, then oh well, I'll just send it out to somebody to repair it.

285
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,043
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, I had one that I repaired and it worked for a while.

286
00:23:13,524 --> 00:23:14,965
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, we'll give it a shot.

287
00:23:15,925 --> 00:23:20,009
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also got a... What is it?

288
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:22,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a Cyclops.

289
00:23:22,911 --> 00:23:28,816
[SPEAKER_09]: A Cygnus II mod chip for one of my 360s.

290
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:32,439
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to play with that, assuming I can get it soldered on there, because...

291
00:23:33,786 --> 00:23:34,166
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

292
00:23:34,186 --> 00:23:38,129
[SPEAKER_09]: I had good luck with my Wii mod chip.

293
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:39,690
[SPEAKER_09]: I was able to solder that.

294
00:23:40,531 --> 00:23:45,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Not so much with my PSP when I tried modding that into the arcade cabinet.

295
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:48,171
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm 50-50 right now.

296
00:24:13,061 --> 00:24:15,762
[SPEAKER_09]: They have crap on their board where nothing wants to solder to it anyway.

297
00:24:16,443 --> 00:24:19,764
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if it came up on last week's show because I think the exchange happened before the show.

298
00:24:19,784 --> 00:24:23,066
[SPEAKER_10]: But I gave Loki my old 360, the one that broke, for him to try to fix.

299
00:24:23,586 --> 00:24:26,248
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope it's one that comes out okay.

300
00:24:26,268 --> 00:24:28,869
[SPEAKER_10]: And I told Loki he could keep it if he fixes it because I have a new one now.

301
00:24:29,189 --> 00:24:32,491
[SPEAKER_10]: So he could use it for his Grand Theft Auto deathmatches, work, whatever he's going to do with it.

302
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:34,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever machine he wants to build, I don't care.

303
00:24:34,692 --> 00:24:35,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Getting rid of it is really what it is.

304
00:24:36,552 --> 00:24:38,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Literally, people keep giving me 360s.

305
00:24:38,774 --> 00:24:40,354
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all, hey, it's broken.

306
00:24:40,374 --> 00:24:41,055
[SPEAKER_09]: I bought another one.

307
00:24:41,095 --> 00:24:41,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Here you go.

308
00:24:41,835 --> 00:24:42,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, funny.

309
00:24:42,536 --> 00:24:43,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome!

310
00:24:43,377 --> 00:24:48,284
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you what, if you get one working, I'll totally buy a mod chip if you want to get rid of one.

311
00:24:50,187 --> 00:24:51,188
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you mean, buy a mod chip?

312
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:54,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, if you get rid of any of them and would mod it.

313
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:58,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it all depends on what firmware some of them are.

314
00:24:58,466 --> 00:25:05,368
[SPEAKER_09]: I know my sister's console, the one she was using, if I can get that fixed, is an old enough firmware where I can run the mod chip on it.

315
00:25:05,888 --> 00:25:12,210
[SPEAKER_09]: The other one's not so sure because we were using those and they were pretty much updated.

316
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,890
[SPEAKER_09]: So those may not work.

317
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,270
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have to look at them.

318
00:25:16,111 --> 00:25:18,211
[SPEAKER_09]: But there may be one or two of them that might work.

319
00:25:18,411 --> 00:25:19,171
[SPEAKER_09]: At least one I know.

320
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:21,372
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why I only got one mod chip.

321
00:25:22,012 --> 00:25:24,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm fine.

322
00:25:26,508 --> 00:25:27,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, anyway, my gaming week.

323
00:25:27,949 --> 00:25:31,192
[SPEAKER_10]: I played a lot, a lot, a lot of stuff this week, so let me try to run down it really quick.

324
00:25:31,813 --> 00:25:34,215
[SPEAKER_10]: I played off a listener tip last week.

325
00:25:34,335 --> 00:25:35,236
[SPEAKER_10]: It came in on Twitter.

326
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:41,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody told me there was this game on the Windows Live server, the games for Windows Live that's free if you download it.

327
00:25:41,761 --> 00:25:44,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Tinker is the name of the game, and I played it.

328
00:25:44,284 --> 00:25:50,529
[SPEAKER_10]: And when we brought it up on the show last week, we were talking about how the game has achievements, and we weren't sure how it interfaced with Xbox Live.

329
00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:51,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, ick.

330
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Interface is really good with Xbox Live.

331
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Those achievements do count towards your gamer score.

332
00:25:56,471 --> 00:26:00,492
[SPEAKER_10]: It will even come up, like if I look on my recent games on the Xbox 360, I see Tinker.

333
00:26:00,552 --> 00:26:02,152
[SPEAKER_10]: I see a card for it with all the achievements.

334
00:26:02,412 --> 00:26:04,132
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can look at it just like it's any other game on my 360.

335
00:26:04,212 --> 00:26:06,393
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of thought that was cool.

336
00:26:06,693 --> 00:26:15,594
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when I was actually playing the game, you could access an Xbox Live-ish type of interface where I could see my friends that were online playing Xbox Live.

337
00:26:15,894 --> 00:26:18,735
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sure if they were looking at me, they would see me playing the Tinker game.

338
00:26:19,255 --> 00:26:21,880
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as Tinker itself, it's a free game.

339
00:26:23,311 --> 00:26:24,532
[SPEAKER_10]: and that's pretty much what it's worth.

340
00:26:24,592 --> 00:26:28,915
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's a puzzle game that's not very different than things we've seen before.

341
00:26:28,975 --> 00:26:40,883
[SPEAKER_10]: It kind of takes the theme of a child's room and kind of takes this 3D isometric approach to get the robot from point A to B, but you have to use switches and there's toy guns and dominoes and dice and things that get in the way.

342
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:42,104
[SPEAKER_10]: It's free.

343
00:26:42,424 --> 00:26:43,805
[SPEAKER_10]: It's worth just playing for a little bit.

344
00:26:43,865 --> 00:26:50,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, if you're an achievement score whore, go download it for like 30 gamerscore pretty easy just by beating the tutorial levels.

345
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:51,370
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not that hard to do.

346
00:26:53,591 --> 00:26:58,336
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it was cute, but I wouldn't have paid a lot of money for it because it's a puzzle we've seen before.

347
00:26:58,657 --> 00:27:04,483
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't like the 3D thing because in later levels, they're like, you have to turn the camera around to be able to see everything.

348
00:27:04,783 --> 00:27:07,126
[SPEAKER_10]: But when you turn the camera around, it's not very seamless.

349
00:27:07,186 --> 00:27:11,130
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just kind of like flips the screen 90 degrees by redisplay.

350
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:15,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, it doesn't actually show the screen rotating like I think we've come to expect.

351
00:27:15,094 --> 00:27:15,534
[SPEAKER_10]: It just kind of...

352
00:27:16,255 --> 00:27:16,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

353
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:44,285
[SPEAKER_10]: I spent a little bit of time just playing some various Xbox Live Arcade games because there were some that I hadn't really played a whole lot of, like Sonic 2 and R-Type, a lot of the classically redone ones.

354
00:27:44,505 --> 00:27:49,487
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to admit, R-Type, when you play it in crazy camera mode where it's all like that tilted 3D, it's kind of cool.

355
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:50,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Hard to play, but cool.

356
00:27:50,988 --> 00:27:53,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't, though, just the remixed versions...

357
00:27:54,889 --> 00:27:56,850
[SPEAKER_10]: I was pretty impressed.

358
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:57,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's nice.

359
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,132
[SPEAKER_10]: But R-Type is still fucking hard.

360
00:28:00,192 --> 00:28:04,755
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot to say the other game that we had going on was Raiden 4, and you should give that a try.

361
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:05,715
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually was really fun.

362
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:14,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, I played quite a bit of Bayonetta on the 360, checked out the game this week, and I love it.

363
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,901
[SPEAKER_10]: It's great.

364
00:28:16,602 --> 00:28:17,463
[SPEAKER_10]: It's over the top.

365
00:28:17,603 --> 00:28:18,324
[SPEAKER_10]: It's excess.

366
00:28:19,245 --> 00:28:26,853
[SPEAKER_10]: We were kind of watching the introduction movie just laughing and laughing because it's so over the top and so unnecessary, but great.

367
00:28:26,953 --> 00:28:28,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I can't even explain it.

368
00:28:29,456 --> 00:28:31,178
[SPEAKER_10]: The game is a bit of a button masher.

369
00:28:31,298 --> 00:28:35,964
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you just kind of punch, punch, kick, kick, dodge, but I don't think it really has to be.

370
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:36,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Like...

371
00:28:37,225 --> 00:28:38,506
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

372
00:28:58,666 --> 00:29:04,273
[SPEAKER_10]: But in the end, I kind of felt that the game is rewarding and there was a lot more depth to it than I was getting the impression from the demo.

373
00:29:04,774 --> 00:29:07,357
[SPEAKER_10]: I honestly have to say, this is one of the better games I've played on the 360.

374
00:29:07,657 --> 00:29:09,239
[SPEAKER_10]: I am having that much fun with it.

375
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,340
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fun.

376
00:29:10,761 --> 00:29:11,642
[SPEAKER_10]: It's excess.

377
00:29:11,822 --> 00:29:12,763
[SPEAKER_10]: It's over the top.

378
00:29:12,924 --> 00:29:13,605
[SPEAKER_10]: It's stupid.

379
00:29:13,945 --> 00:29:15,186
[SPEAKER_10]: It's what a video game should be.

380
00:29:15,207 --> 00:29:15,227
[SPEAKER_10]: I...

381
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:17,669
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's great.

382
00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:20,331
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a lot of very tongue-in-cheek humor in it.

383
00:29:20,731 --> 00:29:22,813
[SPEAKER_10]: There's references to other Sega games in it.

384
00:29:23,493 --> 00:29:29,557
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the fact that, and I'm not really spoiling too much because this is in the first two minutes of the game.

385
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:33,180
[SPEAKER_10]: When they're kind of doing the credits, all the names of the people are on tombstones.

386
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,041
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the director's name came up, right?

387
00:29:35,061 --> 00:29:36,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Same guy that did Devil May Cry and all that.

388
00:29:37,283 --> 00:29:39,585
[SPEAKER_10]: And it opens with somebody peeing on his grave.

389
00:29:39,605 --> 00:29:40,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

390
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:44,309
[SPEAKER_10]: What a good tongue-in-cheek, not-taking-yourself-seriously type of thing.

391
00:29:44,989 --> 00:29:49,714
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a lot of fun with the game, and many lulls were had, and I want to play more of it.

392
00:29:50,434 --> 00:29:57,361
[SPEAKER_10]: The only downside is that I didn't notice any type of multiplayer or how it really interfaced with live.

393
00:29:57,561 --> 00:30:00,884
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess there's leaderboards and stuff, but I had a really good time with it.

394
00:30:02,148 --> 00:30:06,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft in our chatroom, chat.orangesonsready.com says Bayonetta has rings like Sonic the Hedgehog rings.

395
00:30:06,991 --> 00:30:09,313
[SPEAKER_10]: They're called Halos, but yeah, they work just like the Sonic rings, really.

396
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:11,595
[SPEAKER_10]: I totally see this as being like the diva of the Xbox game.

397
00:30:31,212 --> 00:30:32,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, keep in mind it's multi-platform.

398
00:30:32,973 --> 00:30:35,014
[SPEAKER_10]: They're on PS3 as well.

399
00:30:35,414 --> 00:30:36,874
[SPEAKER_05]: The diva of the game world then.

400
00:30:37,935 --> 00:30:40,736
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be a tragedy if there was no sequel announced to this game.

401
00:30:41,076 --> 00:30:44,057
[SPEAKER_10]: I really hope they do a sequel in the same vein.

402
00:30:44,337 --> 00:30:46,018
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not even that far into it.

403
00:30:46,058 --> 00:30:47,439
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm only a couple hours in.

404
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:48,999
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to play more.

405
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,500
[SPEAKER_10]: I just haven't had a lot of time this weekend.

406
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I was playing another game.

407
00:30:52,881 --> 00:30:53,682
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

408
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:38,321
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought that this game, it's a game that there's kind of a lot of hype behind it, and I, including myself, I've hyped this game up before previously, I'm not sure the game lived up 100% to the hype, but there were certain things about it that I really liked, and there were certain parts of the game I was kind of like, oh, this is slow, get on with it, I'm not having any fun right now, let's get past this part, let's blow shit up and move on.

409
00:31:39,843 --> 00:31:41,972
[SPEAKER_10]: um... however

410
00:31:43,523 --> 00:31:46,665
[SPEAKER_10]: One other thing I want to say about it is that PC games, you know what?

411
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:50,148
[SPEAKER_10]: They really have these demanding system requirements.

412
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:54,531
[SPEAKER_10]: I was not able to play this game on my own computer, and my own computer is only like a year old.

413
00:31:54,991 --> 00:32:01,296
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to go play it on my boyfriend's computer because he has a better system than I do and a better video card and all that, and even still it was a little bit choppy.

414
00:32:01,717 --> 00:32:07,021
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I have to remember in a closed beta, sometimes these things are sending data to the server all the time.

415
00:32:07,061 --> 00:32:09,363
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be running a little bit slow on purpose, so I can't...

416
00:32:09,983 --> 00:32:10,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

417
00:32:26,084 --> 00:32:33,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, they've got to fix the interface in this particular game I'm thinking of because it's a game where you can chat with other players because that's the type of game it is.

418
00:32:33,817 --> 00:32:39,105
[SPEAKER_10]: And I couldn't stay on top of chat because the box is so freaking small, like no text fits in it at all.

419
00:32:39,546 --> 00:32:40,568
[SPEAKER_10]: So, there you go.

420
00:32:42,307 --> 00:32:44,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, that was my thoughts on that.

421
00:32:44,409 --> 00:32:50,633
[SPEAKER_10]: More thoughts on that when the beta is unleashed to the public, which is happening next week, which is very good news.

422
00:32:51,214 --> 00:32:52,635
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's see.

423
00:32:52,895 --> 00:32:54,816
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty much it for our gaming weeks.

424
00:32:55,377 --> 00:32:57,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on to a little bit of housekeeping news.

425
00:32:57,238 --> 00:32:59,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, live listeners, I have a little bit of bad news, guys.

426
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,044
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to be live for the next two weeks in our normal time slot, and it's really all my fault.

427
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:06,505
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize for that.

428
00:33:07,326 --> 00:33:10,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Next week is a three-day week for a lot of folks in America because of the Martin Luther King Jr.

429
00:33:10,849 --> 00:33:11,189
[SPEAKER_10]: holiday.

430
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:16,574
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually taking a trip to Seattle, and I am not flying back until Monday, so I won't even be here at all that weekend.

431
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:18,915
[SPEAKER_10]: So we will be taking next week off completely.

432
00:33:19,196 --> 00:33:21,578
[SPEAKER_10]: There will be no show next week at all.

433
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:27,663
[SPEAKER_10]: There might be a best of that hits the feed if it's done in time, so stay tuned to our podcast feed.

434
00:33:28,783 --> 00:33:32,306
[SPEAKER_10]: However, the week after, on the 24th, again, I won't be here.

435
00:33:32,606 --> 00:33:34,568
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's just because I have Sunday evening plans.

436
00:33:34,608 --> 00:33:37,590
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll admit, because it is a little bit gaming related, actually.

437
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,652
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to see Utada Hikaru live at one of her shows.

438
00:33:40,692 --> 00:33:42,554
[SPEAKER_10]: She's in San Francisco on the 24th.

439
00:33:42,574 --> 00:33:44,295
[SPEAKER_10]: And I forgot it was a Sunday when I bought the tickets.

440
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:48,878
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, what a rare opportunity to see a Japanese superstar in a small venue.

441
00:33:48,898 --> 00:33:50,860
[SPEAKER_10]: She's playing the Film War, which is not a very big venue at all.

442
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,881
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to go see that.

443
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:56,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I'm not going to apologize for it because I'm really looking forward to it.

444
00:33:56,644 --> 00:33:57,264
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see you next time.

445
00:34:12,403 --> 00:34:13,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Greenwich Time Greenwich Time

446
00:34:35,524 --> 00:34:44,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, if you just want to get up early, if you happen to be up at 10 o'clock Pacific or that would only be about 1 in the afternoon Eastern, we will be doing a show that week and that will still go to the podcast feed as always.

447
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:45,630
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

448
00:34:47,972 --> 00:34:48,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

449
00:34:48,972 --> 00:34:53,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Looking at our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Let's see.

450
00:34:56,837 --> 00:34:57,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

451
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I apologize for the dead air.

452
00:35:00,321 --> 00:35:01,801
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just trying to catch up on everything going on.

453
00:35:01,841 --> 00:35:06,323
[SPEAKER_10]: They're talking about the game because they all know what I'm talking about, but I don't want to say.

454
00:35:06,803 --> 00:35:15,046
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been previews of it everywhere, left and right, but it's just one of those things I would rather not without me knowing exactly what I can and can't say.

455
00:35:16,887 --> 00:35:32,902
[SPEAKER_10]: and it looks like that best of might be ready we just have to get our intros done for it so we'll see so anyway yes so no show next week at all won't be on the podcast feed or anything although there might be a best of which if it's a best of it's not going to be stuff you've heard in the past couple weeks it's going to be stuff from like

456
00:35:33,703 --> 00:35:36,005
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

457
00:35:54,238 --> 00:35:55,319
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, that's it for housekeeping.

458
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, Twitter.com slash OLR, Facebook.com slash Orange Lawns Radio.

459
00:35:59,885 --> 00:36:00,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Join us there.

460
00:36:00,746 --> 00:36:02,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get into some gaming news.

461
00:36:02,468 --> 00:36:03,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, what was some of the big news this week?

462
00:36:04,751 --> 00:36:06,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's lots of stuff this week.

463
00:36:06,213 --> 00:36:09,016
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to start things off talking a little bit about

464
00:36:09,817 --> 00:36:37,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Microsoft's Game Room and basically I don't know if you would call this their answer to home I don't really know if it's that you may remember a while back we talked about a survey that went out that kind of talked about a place where you'd be able to walk your avatars around and play arcade games well that's what this is they're going to have a bunch of different arcade games some of the stuff they showed off were

465
00:36:39,918 --> 00:36:42,940
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that there was different Atari 2600 games on there.

466
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:47,002
[SPEAKER_09]: They had other things including Centipede.

467
00:36:47,022 --> 00:36:52,526
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to remember the other games that were on there that were pretty cool.

468
00:36:55,387 --> 00:36:58,249
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some television stuff too.

469
00:36:58,289 --> 00:36:59,930
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some Konami games on there.

470
00:37:01,551 --> 00:37:02,512
[SPEAKER_09]: All sorts of fun stuff.

471
00:37:03,172 --> 00:37:03,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.

472
00:37:04,413 --> 00:37:09,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Asteroids, Atari Football, Lunar Lander, Millipede, Outlaw.

473
00:37:10,548 --> 00:37:20,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Pitfall, Red Baron, Road Fighter, Scramble, Tempest, all the kind of stuff that you would... See, I picked up at least two games there that I've already bought on Xbox Live before.

474
00:37:21,191 --> 00:37:22,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Scramble and Tempest.

475
00:37:22,871 --> 00:37:28,332
[SPEAKER_09]: So what's going to be unique about this is you're going to be able to get your own gaming space basically in these areas.

476
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:38,115
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll be able to customize little rooms with a different theme, what games you want in there, what other wall ornaments and whatnot you want to stick in there.

477
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:38,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

478
00:37:40,305 --> 00:37:41,066
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

479
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:10,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Spend $3 or 240 Microsoft Points to get you a virtual arcade cabinet on one platform, either Xbox 360 or PC.

480
00:38:10,993 --> 00:38:12,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably the option I'll be going with.

481
00:38:13,275 --> 00:38:30,728
[SPEAKER_09]: And then also for people that want to just spend lots of money or just, I don't really know why you do this, but for the old retro type of 40 Microsoft Points or 50 cents will allow you to get you two quarters worth of playtime on select titles.

482
00:38:31,488 --> 00:38:34,069
[SPEAKER_09]: for the authentic arcade experience, they call it.

483
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:45,275
[SPEAKER_09]: And the game room itself is actually being developed by the third-party studio Chrome Studios, who are behind Viva Pinata Party Animals, Star Wars Republic Heroes, among any other things.

484
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:53,179
[SPEAKER_09]: They're planning on starting the service with 30 original arcade titles with 1,000 planned for the next three years.

485
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,403
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, they're going to be available from a variety of publishers, including Atari, Activision, and Intellivision.

486
00:39:00,664 --> 00:39:01,264
[SPEAKER_09]: and Konami.

487
00:39:01,524 --> 00:39:06,188
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently there's some more studios involved with it as well.

488
00:39:06,608 --> 00:39:09,110
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to be presented in 1080p.

489
00:39:11,192 --> 00:39:12,613
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

490
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,621
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

491
00:39:47,438 --> 00:39:48,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

492
00:40:03,854 --> 00:40:04,434
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

493
00:40:26,274 --> 00:40:26,714
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

494
00:40:48,143 --> 00:40:55,048
[SPEAKER_09]: A crappy netbook, a crappy PC from like 8 years ago will still run those ROMs just fine.

495
00:40:56,289 --> 00:41:01,293
[SPEAKER_10]: But no e-penis competition if you do it that way, because the whole leaderboards, medals, and all this stuff, right?

496
00:41:01,313 --> 00:41:01,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Who cares?

497
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:02,274
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

498
00:41:02,434 --> 00:41:03,635
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't matter.

499
00:41:04,435 --> 00:41:10,180
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I don't know if I'm really going to be into this, because, like I said, I have MAME.

500
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,242
[SPEAKER_09]: So, why should I spend the money on this?

501
00:41:13,362 --> 00:41:15,744
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, yeah, I get achievement points, but, you know...

502
00:41:16,892 --> 00:41:19,775
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of got over that whole achievement point whoring stuff.

503
00:41:20,155 --> 00:41:27,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's just, you know, the cost to buy games and stuff just to get achievement points, it's just not worth it.

504
00:41:27,844 --> 00:41:30,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this is their way of legitimizing MAME, really.

505
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:34,347
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they're trying to, you know... MAME is still not legal, folks.

506
00:41:34,527 --> 00:41:35,687
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not supposed to have it.

507
00:41:35,707 --> 00:41:36,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me put it this way, okay?

508
00:41:37,508 --> 00:41:40,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's one way at least they'll have a step up above home.

509
00:41:41,189 --> 00:41:43,610
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not going to be fucking lines for games.

510
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:49,593
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have to, like, you know, walk up to an arcade machine and go, Oh, I'm sorry, you can't play this game right now because there's other people playing it.

511
00:41:50,453 --> 00:41:52,854
[SPEAKER_09]: That's retarded when it comes to, you know...

512
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:55,491
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

513
00:42:15,049 --> 00:42:15,489
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.

514
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:18,370
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it'd be great to have on Xbox because I do go back and play old stuff.

515
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,351
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I would necessarily do it as much on PC.

516
00:42:22,611 --> 00:42:29,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think it's nice, especially for people who were into, you know, the classic gaming, like, what was that rental thing that you did, GameTap?

517
00:42:30,033 --> 00:42:31,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, GameTap, yeah.

518
00:42:32,253 --> 00:42:36,034
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and I've pulled a few stuff off of Steam, like I play Loom, but that's really it.

519
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:36,807
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura,

520
00:42:52,783 --> 00:42:53,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Do some of the games.

521
00:42:53,664 --> 00:42:55,105
[SPEAKER_09]: I know they had Crystal Castles on there.

522
00:42:55,545 --> 00:42:56,906
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one of their launch games, yeah.

523
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:01,309
[SPEAKER_05]: And see, the other thing too is that I have a lot of these games on the classic systems.

524
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:03,591
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do have the right controllers for them.

525
00:43:04,171 --> 00:43:07,393
[SPEAKER_05]: And I admit it, not everyone's going to have everything.

526
00:43:07,433 --> 00:43:12,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everyone's got the vault or has been as nuts as Dan and I have been about collecting this stuff.

527
00:43:13,237 --> 00:43:19,542
[SPEAKER_05]: But me personally, I don't have a legitimate need to do the extra spending on it.

528
00:43:19,622 --> 00:43:19,922
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't.

529
00:43:20,522 --> 00:43:31,896
[SPEAKER_09]: and the other thing I think also too that people have been complaining about is like why should I pay $3 a game for these old Atari games when I could just get a flashback for like $20 and it's got like 40 games on there

530
00:43:33,012 --> 00:43:40,994
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also the community feature, I think, that has to be pointed out, is the fact that, you know, you set up your game room so that your friends can come kind of to your game room and play the games.

531
00:43:41,014 --> 00:43:45,376
[SPEAKER_10]: They haven't said, do they get to play them for free, or do they still have to pay, like, the quarters, or what's the deal?

532
00:43:45,396 --> 00:43:46,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Or are they playing demos?

533
00:43:46,356 --> 00:43:47,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, are they doing demos?

534
00:43:47,676 --> 00:43:48,057
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the deal?

535
00:43:48,077 --> 00:43:54,899
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they haven't really given us the details there, but there certainly is that whole idea of building up a collection, which is your game room, and kind of checking out what other people have.

536
00:43:55,319 --> 00:44:01,040
[SPEAKER_10]: And with a thousand planned games, I mean, there's certainly going to be that element of, oh, you have never played this game before?

537
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Come to my game room and look at it real quick.

538
00:44:02,381 --> 00:44:02,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Know what they need to do?

539
00:44:02,961 --> 00:44:04,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

540
00:44:22,685 --> 00:44:24,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not have it so you can view the game as a spectator?

541
00:44:24,886 --> 00:44:25,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Think of it like this.

542
00:44:25,667 --> 00:44:28,668
[SPEAKER_10]: You're at the arcade and there's a bunch of people playing the same game that you want to play.

543
00:44:28,928 --> 00:44:31,810
[SPEAKER_10]: You look over their shoulders and watch the person in front play that game.

544
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:38,013
[SPEAKER_10]: And GS68 says, yeah, watching someone kick ass at so-and-so game in person is better than watching a video on YouTube.

545
00:44:38,453 --> 00:44:39,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Game Room Game Room

546
00:45:03,097 --> 00:45:05,479
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's still a lot to be determined, although we are getting some details.

547
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:15,828
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, one of these videos, one of the guys that was hawking the game room says that the noises you hear in the background of the arcade is dynamically generated based on the games that are in your game room.

548
00:45:17,012 --> 00:45:21,094
[SPEAKER_10]: So, if you have joust, you'll hear joust noises as part of that.

549
00:45:21,254 --> 00:45:27,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, actually, that idea was used in something else that Dan showed me before.

550
00:45:27,918 --> 00:45:37,522
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't want to... I know it wasn't related to me in particular, but there's this guy who did a CG arcade and actually had gone around and recorded...

551
00:45:38,803 --> 00:45:51,548
[SPEAKER_05]: The games in action as well as the games, like their splash screens and that type of thing, their tracked modes, and then had them running so that as you moved through the CG version of this arcade, you were hearing things as you passed along, you know.

552
00:45:52,128 --> 00:45:54,569
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's going to be great.

553
00:45:54,649 --> 00:45:55,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really going to like that.

554
00:45:55,709 --> 00:46:00,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, I think that you should also have the option of turning them off, you know, because sometimes... Well, you might.

555
00:46:00,231 --> 00:46:00,591
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't know.

556
00:46:00,671 --> 00:46:02,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Usually they're not going to advertise, oh, and you can turn this off.

557
00:46:03,392 --> 00:46:04,953
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't really demo that, you know.

558
00:46:05,672 --> 00:46:08,593
[SPEAKER_05]: But back to it, I think that's a nice touch.

559
00:46:09,294 --> 00:46:10,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Some comments from our chatroom.

560
00:46:10,214 --> 00:46:14,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft says, Sky, you can play a game in the game room like a real arcade for 40 Microsoft points for one game.

561
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:17,597
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard it was two games because it's two quarters.

562
00:46:18,038 --> 00:46:18,498
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know.

563
00:46:19,018 --> 00:46:20,159
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see the specifics soon.

564
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,301
[SPEAKER_10]: There's two different pricing methodologies.

565
00:46:24,621 --> 00:46:27,002
[SPEAKER_10]: If you think, oh, this is a game I'm only going to play once.

566
00:46:27,967 --> 00:46:29,488
[SPEAKER_10]: You can only spend 40 Microsoft points.

567
00:46:29,529 --> 00:46:29,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Play it once.

568
00:46:30,209 --> 00:46:30,610
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

569
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:36,595
[SPEAKER_10]: I find that interesting pricing mechanic to be an interesting kind of change about this.

570
00:46:37,136 --> 00:46:41,340
[SPEAKER_10]: SJ100Matt says, Can we put a Microsoft Space Buck token on machines to play next?

571
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,542
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think you're going to have the line there.

572
00:46:44,042 --> 00:46:45,764
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be your own thing.

573
00:46:46,084 --> 00:46:53,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's my honest thought about Game Room, and I've kind of been processing this all week because, you know, as a classic gaming enthusiast, I am a little bit excited about Game Room.

574
00:46:54,251 --> 00:47:04,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I could do all this stuff on main, yeah, but I really like the community ideas, and I have friends that are going to be really into this, and I see myself having competitions for high scores on certain games in Game Room.

575
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:05,539
[SPEAKER_10]: I see this happening.

576
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:07,121
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

577
00:47:24,338 --> 00:47:25,318
[SPEAKER_10]: It's part of their business.

578
00:47:25,739 --> 00:47:28,239
[SPEAKER_10]: And the interesting thing about Game Room, guys, think about it.

579
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:30,840
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not only a rip-off of Nintendo.

580
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:31,840
[SPEAKER_10]: I shouldn't say rip-off.

581
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,641
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not only inspired by Nintendo.

582
00:47:34,861 --> 00:47:35,881
[SPEAKER_10]: It's inspired by Sony.

583
00:47:36,181 --> 00:47:38,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, this is virtual console and home.

584
00:47:39,362 --> 00:47:41,943
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Microsoft's way of one-upping both of those.

585
00:47:42,623 --> 00:47:45,164
[SPEAKER_10]: What has everybody been asking for for virtual console?

586
00:47:45,624 --> 00:47:48,204
[SPEAKER_10]: I should be able to play it online with my friends in like a two-player mode.

587
00:47:48,445 --> 00:47:48,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Guess what?

588
00:47:49,145 --> 00:47:49,985
[SPEAKER_10]: You can do that with Game Room.

589
00:47:51,317 --> 00:47:57,902
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the games in Virtual Console should have some HD effects and should have leaderboards in them and should have achievements.

590
00:47:58,002 --> 00:47:58,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Guess what?

591
00:47:58,382 --> 00:47:59,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Game Room's going to do that for these games.

592
00:48:00,784 --> 00:48:03,005
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Home should have a fucking point to it.

593
00:48:03,386 --> 00:48:10,030
[SPEAKER_10]: That I load up my games seamlessly through the Home interface or that if I earn things in games I'll be able to show it off.

594
00:48:10,251 --> 00:48:10,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Guess what?

595
00:48:11,171 --> 00:48:12,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Game Room's going to do that.

596
00:48:13,533 --> 00:48:21,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Game Room has kind of taken all these ideas that the community wanted from Virtual Console and the things that the community wanted from Home and put it into this Game Room.

597
00:48:21,717 --> 00:48:23,077
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's kind of interesting.

598
00:48:23,597 --> 00:48:32,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I don't think Game Room is as close to Home because I still think there's other stuff that Sony Home kind of will do and does that's much different than Game Room.

599
00:48:33,282 --> 00:48:35,903
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think Game Room is what we all thought Home would be.

600
00:48:37,256 --> 00:48:43,538
[SPEAKER_10]: In a way, even though yes is very important to point out, you're not going to be able to walk very fluidly through it.

601
00:48:44,738 --> 00:48:45,358
[SPEAKER_09]: No, so far.

602
00:48:45,518 --> 00:48:50,980
[SPEAKER_09]: That was just being what they were showing off at CES, they said, because they don't have the collision detection stuff worked out yet.

603
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:58,562
[SPEAKER_09]: But if this thing is coming out in the spring, I don't see it suddenly... Well, spring for Microsoft is anywhere between, you know... Could be May, yeah.

604
00:48:58,762 --> 00:49:03,944
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically, you know, April and May, so who knows.

605
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:07,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, SSJ100Matt says, Simpsons and X-Men Arcade!

606
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:16,353
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you might be kind of messing around, but dude, imagine it if X-Men Arcade did show up in Game Room and you could play it online with six people.

607
00:49:17,033 --> 00:49:18,895
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's going to be huge if that happens.

608
00:49:20,176 --> 00:49:22,117
[SPEAKER_10]: The Ninja Turtle games are pretty popular, right?

609
00:49:22,137 --> 00:49:24,740
[SPEAKER_10]: The Ninja Turtle Arcade game was one of Microsoft's best sellers.

610
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Tons of people were playing that online, probably still are.

611
00:49:28,363 --> 00:49:31,485
[SPEAKER_10]: BlackWolf says, he's going so far as to say it'll come out during E3.

612
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:33,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Possibly.

613
00:49:34,301 --> 00:49:36,587
[SPEAKER_09]: or like Daytona.

614
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:40,959
[SPEAKER_09]: The racing controller and stuff like that.

615
00:49:41,946 --> 00:49:42,146
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

616
00:49:42,386 --> 00:49:44,929
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway, I guess more to see on Game Room.

617
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:47,491
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm excited at the possibilities.

618
00:49:47,511 --> 00:49:52,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, as a classic gaming enthusiast, I don't mind that they're trying to legitimize MAME and give us a reason to pay for it.

619
00:49:53,096 --> 00:49:55,538
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would not buy every game.

620
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:56,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Hell no.

621
00:49:56,399 --> 00:50:01,003
[SPEAKER_10]: But there are some games I remember quite fondly that, yeah, I might drop five bucks to play them on my PC.

622
00:50:01,223 --> 00:50:06,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Because when you say play it on my PC, I think, ooh, my laptop and everywhere it goes with me that I have an internet connection, which is when I travel.

623
00:50:07,228 --> 00:50:09,109
[SPEAKER_10]: That will be kind of cool to have on the road.

624
00:50:09,609 --> 00:50:12,291
[SPEAKER_10]: And compete in the leaderboards and the medals and all that.

625
00:50:12,311 --> 00:50:14,452
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's something I can't really do in MAME.

626
00:50:15,353 --> 00:50:16,173
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not that much.

627
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:17,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Five bucks is not that much.

628
00:50:20,262 --> 00:50:21,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, we'll see what happens.

629
00:50:23,004 --> 00:50:26,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on to another classic game getting a redo.

630
00:50:26,126 --> 00:50:28,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Mega Man 10 is on its way.

631
00:50:28,587 --> 00:50:32,469
[SPEAKER_10]: And Mega Man 10, of course, they've been trying to keep the eight robot master names a secret.

632
00:50:32,509 --> 00:50:33,049
[SPEAKER_10]: But guess what?

633
00:50:33,089 --> 00:50:34,870
[SPEAKER_10]: The game is playable on the CES floor.

634
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:38,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I guess not on the floor, but maybe by appointment.

635
00:50:38,092 --> 00:50:39,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Either way, the game is showing at CES.

636
00:50:39,913 --> 00:50:43,915
[SPEAKER_10]: And although they are asking journalists not to name the bosses and not to show video of it...

637
00:50:44,655 --> 00:50:48,679
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess there was a German video that showed up that it accidentally snuck in there.

638
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably they didn't intend to do it, but you know the bright-eyed fans found it.

639
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:57,027
[SPEAKER_10]: And now the names of the boss monsters in Mega Man 10 have shown up.

640
00:50:57,287 --> 00:51:00,310
[SPEAKER_10]: So of course you already knew about Sheep Man, which I thought was kind of funny.

641
00:51:00,631 --> 00:51:09,259
[SPEAKER_10]: But you will also be able to fight Blade Man, Solar Man, Chill Man, Commando Man, Nitro Man, Strike Man, and Pump Man.

642
00:51:10,894 --> 00:51:14,015
[SPEAKER_10]: and when I hear Pump Man, I'm sorry, I think about the shoes, the pumps.

643
00:51:14,035 --> 00:51:14,955
[SPEAKER_01]: No female characters then?

644
00:51:16,056 --> 00:51:19,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Not yet, but keep in mind that's only eight, right?

645
00:51:19,196 --> 00:51:19,737
[SPEAKER_10]: That's eight.

646
00:51:20,537 --> 00:51:22,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no, I guess there's only eight on the screen because I'm thinking nine.

647
00:51:23,338 --> 00:51:25,438
[SPEAKER_10]: So, no, it doesn't look like there's going to be a woman in this one.

648
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:27,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Although anything can happen.

649
00:51:28,479 --> 00:51:31,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Dr. Wily is now, you know, to check.

650
00:51:31,604 --> 00:51:32,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

651
00:51:32,364 --> 00:51:33,165
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything is possible.

652
00:51:33,605 --> 00:51:34,566
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I guess that's interesting.

653
00:51:34,586 --> 00:51:40,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we had Splash Woman last time, which was the first female boss ever, and now no women this time, it sounds like.

654
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:43,310
[SPEAKER_10]: I just like Pump Man.

655
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:43,611
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

656
00:51:43,631 --> 00:51:44,471
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes me think of the shoes.

657
00:51:44,691 --> 00:51:45,312
[SPEAKER_10]: It cracks me up.

658
00:51:45,332 --> 00:51:47,793
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if that's like a Dig Dug Pump Man or what the deal is there.

659
00:51:49,374 --> 00:51:52,856
[SPEAKER_10]: And Bobby Blackwolf says, Commando Man, he fights you with no underwear?

660
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:52,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

661
00:51:54,193 --> 00:51:55,634
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, what else is going on in gaming?

662
00:52:23,635 --> 00:52:27,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the Greenpeace report came out.

663
00:52:27,461 --> 00:52:28,963
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how much stock I put in a lot of these.

664
00:52:29,003 --> 00:52:30,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Are those the people that tie themselves to boats and stuff?

665
00:52:31,226 --> 00:52:31,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

666
00:52:31,647 --> 00:52:32,188
[SPEAKER_10]: How fun.

667
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:37,936
[SPEAKER_05]: But they have highlighted Nintendo as the most environmentally unfriendly.

668
00:52:38,897 --> 00:52:40,058
[SPEAKER_05]: of electronic companies.

669
00:52:41,959 --> 00:52:54,889
[SPEAKER_05]: They put out Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics and it scored 1.4 out of 10 for its chemical and energy and waste policies and was the lowest of all the ones that were done out of 18.

670
00:52:55,049 --> 00:53:06,498
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a zero on e-waste because they didn't reduce greenhouse gas emissions even though they promised that there's greenhouse gas emissions from a Wii game.

671
00:53:07,921 --> 00:53:12,062
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's maybe some manufacturing release is what they're talking about.

672
00:53:28,827 --> 00:53:34,569
[SPEAKER_05]: It also got some points for the DSI-EC adapter and for disclosing CO2 emissions.

673
00:53:36,169 --> 00:53:37,510
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it still got bad.

674
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:41,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft got 2.4 points, so it was actually just above Nintendo.

675
00:53:42,051 --> 00:53:49,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And of the major three, Sony was the most green in seventh place with a score of 5.1.

676
00:53:49,213 --> 00:53:49,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly...

677
00:53:54,875 --> 00:53:59,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Really the tops of the ones were Nokia, Sony Ericsson, and Toshiba.

678
00:53:59,657 --> 00:54:07,220
[SPEAKER_05]: And Apple got a big special mention for completely eliminating chemicals from the computer systems.

679
00:54:08,541 --> 00:54:12,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I really don't care for Greenpeace as a facility all that much because...

680
00:54:16,391 --> 00:54:18,453
[SPEAKER_05]: of some inaccuracies in their own.

681
00:54:19,453 --> 00:54:22,435
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to get on the political, socio-political platform right now.

682
00:54:23,476 --> 00:54:29,240
[SPEAKER_05]: People know there's a lot of stuff that I've said because they're just not accurate.

683
00:54:29,561 --> 00:54:32,203
[SPEAKER_05]: They try to put the spin on it for their own thing, but I'm not going to go into that.

684
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:43,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I do, however, think that it's just a pretty interesting seeing where I think the concern is going, you know.

685
00:54:43,891 --> 00:54:43,911
[SPEAKER_10]: I

686
00:54:44,111 --> 00:54:47,453
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm all for being more green and environmentally friendly and all that.

687
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:49,514
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, solar power, wind power, etc., etc.

688
00:54:49,654 --> 00:54:55,837
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do think, you know, one thing the study does show is that, hey, you know, if Microsoft... Even though they're not... If I remember right, I saw the chart.

689
00:54:55,897 --> 00:54:59,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Microsoft is by no means a green-friendly company, but they're higher up on the scale than Nintendo.

690
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:00,440
[SPEAKER_10]: And if...

691
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,861
[SPEAKER_10]: They can make some cutbacks.

692
00:55:01,901 --> 00:55:02,982
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, why can't Nintendo?

693
00:55:03,042 --> 00:55:05,364
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of like my thing is that they're both in the same business.

694
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:08,367
[SPEAKER_10]: If Sony does really good, what changes?

695
00:55:08,627 --> 00:55:14,993
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know the technical side of things so well, but what are they doing in the manufacturing that Nintendo and Microsoft can't do?

696
00:55:15,053 --> 00:55:17,255
[SPEAKER_10]: What can't they do?

697
00:55:19,577 --> 00:55:26,543
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to go all hippie on you, but I'm all for looking for ways to be cost-effective yet green, you know?

698
00:55:28,048 --> 00:55:35,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, to be perfectly honest, I think people have gone way too overboard with the whole green thing because really I think a lot of it is probably going to get me some booze.

699
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:49,638
[SPEAKER_05]: I really think a lot of it has to do with more ways to make money and more marketing, more ways of... I don't want to do the conspiracy thing and say that it's them trying to control the way we think.

700
00:55:50,038 --> 00:55:50,598
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

701
00:55:51,179 --> 00:55:54,280
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that it is a degree of social conditioning.

702
00:55:54,764 --> 00:56:00,225
[SPEAKER_10]: What's interesting, and I don't want to go too far with this because it's not about games, but a lot of people buy their video games there.

703
00:56:00,245 --> 00:56:00,726
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say this.

704
00:56:01,426 --> 00:56:07,407
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard a story on the news this week that Walmart in our area, Sacramento, at three test stores have eliminated plastic bags altogether.

705
00:56:08,007 --> 00:56:13,069
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you either bring your own bag or they will sell you the blue reusable bags for 15 cents.

706
00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:16,650
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

707
00:56:33,516 --> 00:56:40,799
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have a collection of those 15 cent bags piled up to the ceiling in my house because I would never remember to take them and I would end up throwing them away and shit.

708
00:56:40,859 --> 00:56:41,259
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

709
00:56:41,279 --> 00:56:41,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at your feet.

710
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,480
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, you've got a couple of them there.

711
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:48,463
[SPEAKER_05]: But those I always empty out and I actually keep three or four of them in my car at any given point in time.

712
00:56:49,443 --> 00:56:55,866
[SPEAKER_05]: So I actually do use them, but honestly because I... I don't like throwing out the trash that often.

713
00:56:56,486 --> 00:56:56,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Really.

714
00:56:57,306 --> 00:56:58,207
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Dan do it, but...

715
00:56:58,976 --> 00:56:59,817
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't make you buy bags.

716
00:57:19,066 --> 00:57:20,848
[SPEAKER_10]: The grocery store, they do the reverse.

717
00:57:20,929 --> 00:57:22,731
[SPEAKER_10]: If you bring your own bag, they take off five cents.

718
00:57:23,011 --> 00:57:25,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, Ikea's like a pompous store, too.

719
00:57:25,133 --> 00:57:32,662
[SPEAKER_09]: All high and mighty, smelling their own farts, as South Park could put it.

720
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:38,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, they have a bunch of shit there that's way too damn expensive.

721
00:57:38,516 --> 00:57:40,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Lord Moon in our chat says, put them in your car.

722
00:57:40,279 --> 00:57:41,221
[SPEAKER_10]: Just remember they're in your car.

723
00:57:41,261 --> 00:57:44,788
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, in theory, that's a really good idea, but yet I still see myself failing.

724
00:57:44,888 --> 00:57:45,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's what I'm going to do instead.

725
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:47,233
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to go shop at Walmart.

726
00:57:47,353 --> 00:57:48,535
[SPEAKER_10]: At least not that Walmart.

727
00:57:49,193 --> 00:57:50,254
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

728
00:58:10,034 --> 00:58:12,278
[SPEAKER_05]: because I don't always take the same classes every day.

729
00:58:12,318 --> 00:58:20,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm going to have overlap this semester, but when they're all in my car, I just grab the bag I need and go and I don't have to worry about changing out my books or anything.

730
00:58:21,583 --> 00:58:23,625
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually reuse the plastic bags.

731
00:58:23,665 --> 00:58:26,166
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll take my lunches to work and I don't have a fancy thermos or nothing.

732
00:58:26,186 --> 00:58:27,767
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't need all that fancy shit.

733
00:58:27,787 --> 00:58:29,208
[SPEAKER_10]: I put it in a plastic bag and take it to work.

734
00:58:29,609 --> 00:58:34,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Or even if I'm taking bathroom supplies on a trip with me for travel, I'll put it in a plastic bag.

735
00:58:34,572 --> 00:58:35,993
[SPEAKER_10]: It's stuff for the bathroom.

736
00:58:36,273 --> 00:58:38,255
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't need to be in a fancy plush case.

737
00:58:38,415 --> 00:58:42,858
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing I use plastic bags for is when I dye my hair because I tend to splash everywhere.

738
00:58:43,038 --> 00:58:45,421
[SPEAKER_10]: and a lot of people line the kitty liner with it.

739
00:58:46,162 --> 00:58:49,126
[SPEAKER_05]: I get cat bag liners because Shermie has a big box for her stinky ass.

740
00:58:50,208 --> 00:58:57,618
[SPEAKER_05]: But I actually line my sink with plastic bags so that I don't stain the sink since this technically isn't really our house.

741
00:58:58,972 --> 00:59:03,154
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to go back and read some of the comments on Mega Man 10 because there was some funny stuff in chat.

742
00:59:03,575 --> 00:59:08,057
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think Bochikawa hit the nail on the head earlier in our chatroom, chat.orange.radio.com.

743
00:59:08,417 --> 00:59:10,759
[SPEAKER_10]: I think pump means like water pump.

744
00:59:11,219 --> 00:59:16,282
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's actually not a bad guess because usually there's some type of water boss in the game and that's probably the one that's good.

745
00:59:16,602 --> 00:59:17,802
[SPEAKER_10]: I like TigerClaw's comment too.

746
00:59:17,902 --> 00:59:19,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Pump could mean the first robot could be muscle bound.

747
00:59:20,284 --> 00:59:21,925
[SPEAKER_10]: At least they didn't call him Plump Man.

748
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:27,648
[SPEAKER_10]: GS68 says, if there ever is a final Mega Man game, the last boss should simply be called The Man.

749
00:59:29,137 --> 00:59:38,507
[SPEAKER_10]: LOL, last Mega Man game, you're funny Jay Dizzle commenting on this story says they have to disclose CO2 emissions so I can't fart without telling my supervisor

750
00:59:43,758 --> 00:59:45,178
[SPEAKER_05]: One other thing, and I do have to bring this up.

751
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:51,840
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually do need a certain degree of CO2 in the air for environmental balance.

752
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,121
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that people tend to take it a little bit too far.

753
00:59:55,861 --> 00:59:56,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I understand.

754
00:59:57,522 --> 00:59:58,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we need to cut back on stuff.

755
00:59:58,782 --> 01:00:02,123
[SPEAKER_05]: There's certain things that are going on environmentally that, yeah, we do have to be more mindful of.

756
01:00:02,163 --> 01:00:05,084
[SPEAKER_05]: But I really do think that people are taking it way too far.

757
01:00:05,864 --> 01:00:10,806
[SPEAKER_05]: They're reading more into things and making, certainly, a catastrophe out of something that really isn't.

758
01:00:12,026 --> 01:00:12,226
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?

759
01:00:13,146 --> 01:00:13,426
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

760
01:00:13,847 --> 01:00:16,970
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got more gaming news in our Classic Game of the Week before too long here.

761
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:17,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

762
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:18,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

763
01:00:18,871 --> 01:00:30,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you have some EA games that are a tad bit old and dusty, you may not be able to play those online soon enough because they are going to be shutting down some of their older game servers.

764
01:00:31,483 --> 01:00:36,628
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of the games that they have, actually, some of the games on the list aren't too old.

765
01:00:36,648 --> 01:00:37,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

766
01:00:38,632 --> 01:00:44,814
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, Facebreaker, which came out about a year ago, is being shut down.

767
01:00:45,414 --> 01:00:50,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Some other ones on the list, Madden 08 and Madden 09.

768
01:00:50,436 --> 01:00:52,097
[SPEAKER_09]: 08 is being shut down.

769
01:00:52,297 --> 01:00:55,578
[SPEAKER_09]: These are on February 2nd on the Wii and PC.

770
01:00:56,158 --> 01:01:01,140
[SPEAKER_09]: And 09 on the original Xbox, Wii and on PSP.

771
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:06,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, some other older sports games.

772
01:01:06,381 --> 01:01:16,064
[SPEAKER_09]: March Madness 07, NBA Live 07, 08, 09, at least on the Wii, and that's in Europe only.

773
01:01:17,605 --> 01:01:19,626
[SPEAKER_09]: NCAA Football, NASCAR.

774
01:01:20,746 --> 01:01:27,249
[SPEAKER_09]: NASCAR 09 I'm kind of surprised on because they actually don't have a new NASCAR game, so that's interesting.

775
01:01:27,949 --> 01:01:29,270
[SPEAKER_09]: That is only on PS2.

776
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:31,411
[SPEAKER_09]: PS3 and Xbox 360, though, in Europe only.

777
01:01:33,646 --> 01:01:34,787
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

778
01:02:00,611 --> 01:02:03,415
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not too surprised, but maybe some people are.

779
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:06,720
[SPEAKER_09]: But hell, buy Madden 09 or something.

780
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:07,962
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure it's dirt cheap by now.

781
01:02:08,883 --> 01:02:14,191
[SPEAKER_09]: And a few Tiger Woods games also.

782
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:20,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's always kind of sad when they shut servers down, but at the same time, you know, I get it with the sports games.

783
01:02:20,215 --> 01:02:21,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of those folks upgrade.

784
01:02:21,536 --> 01:02:22,976
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just not cost-effective to run.

785
01:02:23,116 --> 01:02:23,656
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

786
01:02:23,976 --> 01:02:24,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

787
01:02:25,817 --> 01:02:30,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Another game also, not exactly an EA game, that's also having their servers shut down.

788
01:02:30,419 --> 01:02:40,683
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, actually shutting down, I don't know if it's already happened already, but Chromehounds, apparently, the servers shut down.

789
01:02:41,621 --> 01:02:45,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I can see why that game really got boring really fast.

790
01:02:46,342 --> 01:02:54,984
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently, this happened way back... Oh, apparently this week is when it actually shut down.

791
01:02:55,044 --> 01:03:01,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently they announced the shutdown back in August, but they finally shut the servers off this week.

792
01:03:03,285 --> 01:03:03,966
[SPEAKER_09]: That's too bad.

793
01:03:04,966 --> 01:03:06,086
[SPEAKER_09]: But, eh.

794
01:03:06,704 --> 01:03:07,845
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Armored Core now.

795
01:03:08,185 --> 01:03:14,670
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to be having, soon enough, the new Front Mission game, which is going to be all sorts of awesome.

796
01:03:16,871 --> 01:03:20,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby in chat, because you might remember Bobby was talking about Chromehounds a lot when that game first came out.

797
01:03:20,794 --> 01:03:22,275
[SPEAKER_10]: He said, Chromehounds shut down last week.

798
01:03:22,676 --> 01:03:24,757
[SPEAKER_10]: All my friends did one last hurrah last weekend.

799
01:03:24,797 --> 01:03:25,397
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't home.

800
01:03:28,052 --> 01:03:31,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's always sad when the games that you like, their servers shut down.

801
01:03:31,194 --> 01:03:33,515
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember when the Amplitude servers shut down, I had to cry.

802
01:03:34,315 --> 01:03:39,778
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if Chromehounds was System Link as well, because that might not be so bad.

803
01:03:39,818 --> 01:03:41,659
[SPEAKER_09]: At least you could do LAN or something like that.

804
01:03:43,259 --> 01:03:50,143
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't really have a lot of System Link games anymore anyways, but I wonder if that was one of them that was.

805
01:03:50,263 --> 01:03:54,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's probably kind of a pain in the ass to do, too, the whole System Link thing, you know?

806
01:03:55,151 --> 01:04:02,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's people that like doing LAN stuff, and I mean, yeah, it may be a pain in the ass, but I don't know.

807
01:04:02,459 --> 01:04:04,421
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be kind of neat, though, if it was System Link.

808
01:04:06,703 --> 01:04:07,324
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not.

809
01:04:09,006 --> 01:04:09,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Bummer.

810
01:04:10,973 --> 01:04:20,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, some more news for you guys, and this has to do with another thing getting shut down, but not quite an actually authorized video game.

811
01:04:21,356 --> 01:04:26,678
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Nintendo has put the smackdown on a fan film that was being made for quite some time, actually.

812
01:04:26,698 --> 01:04:36,641
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess this film had been taken like four years to make, but considering there was a bunch of people that did it in their free time, the Zelda movie was called The Hero of Time, and they actually put it out on the internet.

813
01:04:37,161 --> 01:04:39,482
[SPEAKER_10]: It got some mixed reviews, but you know, I mean...

814
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:41,430
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a fan thing.

815
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:46,533
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't expect anything that's Hollywood-caliber stuff.

816
01:04:46,593 --> 01:04:50,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Folks were at least kind of appreciative that the movie, I guess, had been made.

817
01:04:50,814 --> 01:05:04,040
[SPEAKER_10]: But not Nintendo, because the movie's official site on New Year's Day... Actually, so this is a little bit over a week old, but the community site actually had to take the movie down because the studio came to an agreement with Nintendo.

818
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:06,662
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually say, quote, So, uh, yeah.

819
01:05:06,742 --> 01:05:07,763
[SPEAKER_10]: They won't be making a movie out of that.

820
01:05:07,783 --> 01:05:07,983
[SPEAKER_10]: You know...

821
01:05:27,961 --> 01:05:29,365
[SPEAKER_10]: I get why they had to do it.

822
01:05:36,041 --> 01:05:41,204
[SPEAKER_10]: because unfortunately not everyone might think that this is a unauthorized movie.

823
01:05:41,245 --> 01:05:46,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Because think about how that whole game of telephone works, especially so on the internet.

824
01:05:46,508 --> 01:05:48,389
[SPEAKER_10]: One thing gets passed along to another person.

825
01:05:48,689 --> 01:05:51,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody's going to say, hey dude, have you seen the Zelda movie?

826
01:05:51,371 --> 01:05:52,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me hand this to you.

827
01:05:52,132 --> 01:05:53,873
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the fucking Legend of Zelda movie.

828
01:05:54,093 --> 01:05:55,254
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it's not good.

829
01:05:55,394 --> 01:06:03,339
[SPEAKER_09]: And if they don't protect their actual trademarks, then they will no longer have those trademarks, basically.

830
01:06:03,379 --> 01:06:04,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if, you know,

831
01:06:04,738 --> 01:06:05,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

832
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:13,823
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing, though, to kind of go with that, though, is it's already on YouTube, of course, in parts.

833
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:19,547
[SPEAKER_10]: The thing, once they hit the internet, though, that's the other side of it, is that once something hits the internet, it's done.

834
01:06:19,787 --> 01:06:25,771
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there's no, like, it's not like you can say, oh, well, now nobody will ever see this.

835
01:06:26,171 --> 01:06:30,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope, once it hits the internet, it is a, it's done.

836
01:06:30,113 --> 01:06:31,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody has it if they want to know where to go look.

837
01:06:32,095 --> 01:06:32,935
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, it's on YouTube.

838
01:06:32,975 --> 01:06:38,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Tigerclaw just linked us to it in our chat room, and you can actually see we're playing, like, just a little clip here.

839
01:06:38,239 --> 01:06:38,899
[SPEAKER_09]: And I watched the first

840
01:06:39,339 --> 01:06:53,935
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's kind of boring is it let's just look at a little bit here I don't know some chicks crying in the forest I don't know if that's Zelda oh maybe that's supposed to be like Link when he's born or something

841
01:06:57,014 --> 01:07:00,997
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it looks like something that would have been on TV in the 1980s.

842
01:07:01,498 --> 01:07:07,443
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, it has the same kind of production quality as Highlander.

843
01:07:07,543 --> 01:07:09,284
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like Beauty and the Beast to me.

844
01:07:12,587 --> 01:07:17,171
[SPEAKER_10]: You remember that old-ass show, Beauty and the Beast, with what's-her-name, that went on to be in The Terminator?

845
01:07:17,191 --> 01:07:17,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Linda Hamilton.

846
01:07:17,731 --> 01:07:18,832
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it, Linda Hamilton.

847
01:07:19,493 --> 01:07:20,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I love that show, by the way.

848
01:07:22,102 --> 01:07:22,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, sorry.

849
01:07:23,162 --> 01:07:24,503
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess that was a little prologue there.

850
01:07:25,243 --> 01:07:27,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's all over YouTube, so take a look if you want.

851
01:07:27,903 --> 01:07:30,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, release date's coming up after another story from DarkSakura.

852
01:07:33,324 --> 01:07:35,405
[SPEAKER_10]: She doesn't drop all her stuff everywhere.

853
01:07:35,425 --> 01:07:35,825
[SPEAKER_10]: You alright?

854
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:36,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you continue?

855
01:07:37,325 --> 01:07:38,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this a workman's comp issue?

856
01:07:40,726 --> 01:07:42,366
[SPEAKER_05]: There are four letters I'd like to say to you.

857
01:07:43,786 --> 01:07:44,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

858
01:07:44,407 --> 01:07:45,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh wait, no, too many.

859
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:46,047
[SPEAKER_05]: S-T-F-U.

860
01:07:48,214 --> 01:07:49,795
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's with all the love in my heart.

861
01:07:51,216 --> 01:07:55,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, EA actually has hired somebody, so not everyone's losing their job.

862
01:07:57,361 --> 01:07:58,402
[SPEAKER_05]: They hired Mark Tramiel.

863
01:07:58,882 --> 01:08:00,103
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what Mark Tramiel gave us?

864
01:08:01,144 --> 01:08:02,024
[SPEAKER_05]: NBA Jam!

865
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:04,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Boom shakalaka!

866
01:08:06,468 --> 01:08:15,454
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, since they're trying to revive NBA Jam for Wii, why not hire the guy who made it?

867
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:20,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if I can still play as Bill Clinton.

868
01:08:46,882 --> 01:08:48,443
[SPEAKER_05]: or, you know, Liu Kang.

869
01:08:50,325 --> 01:08:54,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates of some upcoming video games.

870
01:08:54,247 --> 01:08:58,290
[SPEAKER_10]: NBA Jam, I don't think is one of them yet, but I bet you that's an E3 title.

871
01:08:59,071 --> 01:09:00,211
[SPEAKER_10]: That's something we'll see at E3.

872
01:09:00,271 --> 01:09:00,612
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

873
01:09:01,853 --> 01:09:03,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

874
01:09:03,694 --> 01:09:06,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this week we actually have some decent stuff coming out.

875
01:09:06,836 --> 01:09:09,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Starting off with Army of Two, the 40th day.

876
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:11,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and on PSP.

877
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:17,592
[SPEAKER_09]: The PSP one is supposed to be more like Contra, so that's kind of cool.

878
01:09:18,533 --> 01:09:22,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Vancouver 2010, the official video game of the Olympic Winter Games.

879
01:09:23,037 --> 01:09:24,138
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a long-ass title.

880
01:09:25,059 --> 01:09:29,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming out on Xbox 360 and also on PS3 as well.

881
01:09:30,004 --> 01:09:34,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Skycrawler's Innocent Aces on the Wii, coming from XSEED.

882
01:09:35,723 --> 01:09:39,127
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got a Sims 2 re-release collection.

883
01:09:39,547 --> 01:09:44,933
[SPEAKER_09]: The Sims 2 Fun with Pets collection, which includes three of the expansions.

884
01:09:46,254 --> 01:09:47,816
[SPEAKER_10]: You said Sims 2 Fun with Pets?

885
01:09:48,256 --> 01:09:49,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Sims 2 Fun with Pets.

886
01:09:49,758 --> 01:09:50,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though Sims 3 is out now.

887
01:09:51,599 --> 01:09:53,862
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a compilation.

888
01:09:53,882 --> 01:09:56,925
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you torture the pets in the same way that you torture humans?

889
01:09:57,185 --> 01:10:03,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's got Sims 2 Pets and Sims 2 Family Fun and Sims 2 Not that I would ever do that.

890
01:10:03,847 --> 01:10:05,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I want Pets and Sims 3.

891
01:10:05,948 --> 01:10:06,548
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm waiting for it.

892
01:10:06,568 --> 01:10:08,189
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to present all sides of the issue.

893
01:10:08,529 --> 01:10:17,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's the Sims 2 Pets, Sims 2 H&M Family Fun stuff and Sims 2 Mansion and Garden stuff.

894
01:10:18,032 --> 01:10:18,592
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can get that.

895
01:10:18,612 --> 01:10:21,493
[SPEAKER_09]: There's actually another Sims 3 expansion coming in March.

896
01:10:22,974 --> 01:10:24,775
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember what it's called, though, unfortunately.

897
01:10:24,795 --> 01:10:25,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

898
01:10:27,651 --> 01:10:34,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Daniel X coming out on the DS, which I think that's based off a movie or TV show.

899
01:10:34,454 --> 01:10:35,014
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't remember.

900
01:10:36,595 --> 01:10:38,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Twin Sector on the PC.

901
01:10:39,596 --> 01:10:44,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Sands of Destruction coming out from Sega, and that's on the DS.

902
01:10:44,219 --> 01:10:45,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty cool role-playing game.

903
01:10:47,557 --> 01:10:50,758
[SPEAKER_09]: God, why do you let me down Konami?

904
01:10:52,199 --> 01:10:57,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Their brand new music rhythm game, which is crap, called Walk It Out.

905
01:10:57,581 --> 01:11:00,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it's a game for the Wii about walking.

906
01:11:01,723 --> 01:11:06,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome, because this is way better than any other good music game they could possibly release.

907
01:11:06,485 --> 01:11:08,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's release another one that's about walking.

908
01:11:11,227 --> 01:11:16,689
[SPEAKER_09]: And finally, a week from today, Glory of Hercules coming out on the Nintendo DS from Nintendo.

909
01:11:17,796 --> 01:11:18,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's Push The Power Button

910
01:11:27,904 --> 01:11:29,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Or bobbing your head to the music.

911
01:11:30,685 --> 01:11:31,585
[SPEAKER_10]: What is love?

912
01:11:32,106 --> 01:11:33,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Baby, don't hurt me.

913
01:11:33,686 --> 01:11:36,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, going to Japan and looking at the Japanese release dates.

914
01:11:36,367 --> 01:11:39,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Batman Arkham Asylum, yes, it's taken a little while to come to Japan.

915
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:41,949
[SPEAKER_10]: But of course, they're probably having to re-dub everything in Japanese.

916
01:11:41,969 --> 01:11:46,151
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is getting its release this week on the Xbox 360 and I believe the PlayStation 3 as well.

917
01:11:46,871 --> 01:11:50,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Operation Flashpoint Dragon Rising also making its way to the Xbox 360 and the PS3.

918
01:11:52,993 --> 01:11:55,536
[SPEAKER_10]: The PS3 is getting a price reduction on Bioshock.

919
01:11:55,576 --> 01:11:59,079
[SPEAKER_10]: It's taken them a little while, but that would be the Japanese localized version there.

920
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:00,340
[SPEAKER_10]: That's coming out there.

921
01:12:00,921 --> 01:12:03,964
[SPEAKER_10]: On the Nintendo Wii, Biohazard, The Darkside Chronicles.

922
01:12:04,164 --> 01:12:06,386
[SPEAKER_10]: And that, of course, would be Resident Evil over here in the U.S.

923
01:12:06,827 --> 01:12:11,151
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would be Resident Evil Darkside Chronicles making its way out on the Wii this week in Japan.

924
01:12:11,831 --> 01:12:13,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing of note, really, on the PlayStation 2.

925
01:12:13,953 --> 01:12:16,214
[SPEAKER_10]: On the DS, there's a game called Last Window.

926
01:12:16,574 --> 01:12:20,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayonaka no Yakusoku comes out this week on the DS.

927
01:12:20,297 --> 01:12:21,598
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to see what kind of game that is.

928
01:12:22,959 --> 01:12:24,380
[SPEAKER_10]: It's by Nintendo.

929
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,161
[SPEAKER_10]: It's some type of first-party game.

930
01:12:26,681 --> 01:12:29,743
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks to be kind of like one of those investigative games, mystery-type things.

931
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:31,785
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the sequel to Hotel...

932
01:12:32,345 --> 01:12:34,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Dust, I think.

933
01:12:34,106 --> 01:12:35,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it does look like that.

934
01:12:35,927 --> 01:12:36,487
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what it is.

935
01:12:36,547 --> 01:12:37,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Last Window, that would make sense.

936
01:12:37,907 --> 01:12:39,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so it's like a sequel to that in Japan.

937
01:12:39,548 --> 01:12:43,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I know part of the name is Promise, so I don't understand the rest of it.

938
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:45,790
[SPEAKER_10]: That could have to do with the story, so that makes sense.

939
01:12:46,251 --> 01:12:46,951
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, very cool.

940
01:12:47,971 --> 01:12:51,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Also coming out, it's kind of a slow week in Japan.

941
01:12:52,033 --> 01:12:54,154
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if they're having the same busy first quarter we are.

942
01:12:55,054 --> 01:12:57,196
[SPEAKER_10]: On the Sony PSP it's got a few things.

943
01:12:57,496 --> 01:13:00,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Tekken 6 is getting a release on the PSP in Japan this week.

944
01:13:00,538 --> 01:13:03,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Spectral vs. Generation gets a price reduction this week.

945
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:10,003
[SPEAKER_10]: And Kentoshi Gladiator Begins is a game that's coming out from the company Acquire.

946
01:13:10,704 --> 01:13:14,526
[SPEAKER_10]: And it looks to be, you know, it's got kind of the gladiator on the front.

947
01:13:14,586 --> 01:13:21,270
[SPEAKER_10]: It does look like it's kind of a gladiator Roman times and all that inspired game, like a fighting game.

948
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:21,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of...

949
01:13:22,691 --> 01:13:29,794
[SPEAKER_10]: A little bit God of War-ish, but a little bit closer in the camera and a little bit closer combat, it looks like, from the screenshots we're looking at.

950
01:13:30,254 --> 01:13:32,015
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if that's something they're planning on bringing over here.

951
01:13:33,135 --> 01:13:37,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, by the way, if you do like Bleach, Soul Carnival gets a price reduction on the PSP this week as well.

952
01:13:37,697 --> 01:13:38,958
[SPEAKER_10]: That does it for Japanese releases.

953
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:39,418
[SPEAKER_10]: How about the UK?

954
01:13:39,977 --> 01:13:41,317
[SPEAKER_05]: For the UK, I've just got a few.

955
01:13:41,838 --> 01:13:47,240
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Army of Two, The 40th Day on Xbox 360 and PS3 and PSP.

956
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:50,121
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Astro Boy for Wii DS and PSP.

957
01:13:50,361 --> 01:13:56,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Vancouver 2010, the official video game of the Olympic Winter Games on PS3, PC and Xbox 360.

958
01:13:56,183 --> 01:13:56,443
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

959
01:13:58,325 --> 01:14:12,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Looking at some of the comments in our chatroom, chat.orangeonsradio.com Some people getting in on the walk it out fun Bochikawa says, I want to see clap fun on the Wii GameGuru says, Konami's press start to win Where you press start and you win

960
01:14:13,448 --> 01:14:14,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

961
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:37,031
[SPEAKER_10]: A co-worker of mine, I don't know a lot of hardcore gamers at work, although this guy in particular does play a lot of video games.

962
01:14:37,371 --> 01:14:40,515
[SPEAKER_10]: He told me that just dance on the Wii is actually a lot of fun.

963
01:14:40,916 --> 01:14:43,059
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of the OLR people have said that too.

964
01:14:43,519 --> 01:14:46,003
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a horrible game, but I've been selling a ton of it.

965
01:14:46,283 --> 01:14:46,883
[SPEAKER_10]: I still want X-Tango

966
01:15:14,447 --> 01:15:17,788
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, Tigerclaw takes things straight to the toilet saying, how about Jack it out?

967
01:15:19,528 --> 01:15:21,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course he means a jack-in-the-box, right?

968
01:15:21,549 --> 01:15:22,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Turn the crank?

969
01:15:23,229 --> 01:15:24,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

970
01:15:24,109 --> 01:15:24,789
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's not what he means.

971
01:15:25,189 --> 01:15:29,670
[SPEAKER_10]: He means turning the crank, but not the kind of... Anyhow, how about more gaming news?

972
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:33,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I have a better name for that particular version of it.

973
01:15:33,891 --> 01:15:34,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.

974
01:15:34,291 --> 01:15:37,952
[SPEAKER_10]: It'd be... Ceiling Cat is watching you play this game.

975
01:15:39,752 --> 01:15:41,393
[SPEAKER_09]: They should really just call it Walk It Off.

976
01:15:41,433 --> 01:15:42,033
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be Fap to Win.

977
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:45,289
[SPEAKER_09]: They should just call it Walk It Off.

978
01:15:45,370 --> 01:15:48,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone gets brutally injured and they have to walk it off.

979
01:15:49,142 --> 01:15:52,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Amalthea also chimes in and says, why don't they transfer the Taiko drum games to the Wii?

980
01:15:52,843 --> 01:15:53,403
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be perfect.

981
01:15:53,783 --> 01:15:54,503
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe they did.

982
01:15:54,543 --> 01:15:56,844
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a little inflatable drum, even, but it's in Japan.

983
01:15:56,964 --> 01:15:57,824
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't bring it over here.

984
01:15:58,244 --> 01:16:04,286
[SPEAKER_10]: So you might have to write Namco and bug them, or you're probably going to have to mod your Wii and import the Japanese version.

985
01:16:04,306 --> 01:16:06,506
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, there's a cute little inflatable drum and everything.

986
01:16:07,386 --> 01:16:09,867
[SPEAKER_10]: But those games, if I remember right, are pretty heavily Japanese.

987
01:16:10,267 --> 01:16:12,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you know, they're not translated into English.

988
01:16:12,347 --> 01:16:13,348
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah.

989
01:16:14,208 --> 01:16:14,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Good luck navigating it.

990
01:16:16,821 --> 01:16:19,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

991
01:16:20,103 --> 01:16:24,685
[SPEAKER_10]: And it shouldn't be too hard to figure out what DarkSakura has picked this week, but it's a good one, nonetheless.

992
01:16:25,766 --> 01:16:34,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, there's some news coming about what may be announced at E3, perhaps, this year.

993
01:16:35,752 --> 01:16:42,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Satoru Iwata has offered some information regarding the next DS system.

994
01:16:43,556 --> 01:16:49,058
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is the next, not necessarily next, revision of the system.

995
01:16:49,838 --> 01:17:01,501
[SPEAKER_09]: They're saying that the true next Nintendo handheld system, this is from an interview with a Asahi Shimbun newspaper, I'm assuming in Japan.

996
01:17:01,922 --> 01:17:04,882
[SPEAKER_09]: It says it will have highly detailed graphics and it will be...

997
01:17:06,923 --> 01:17:13,486
[SPEAKER_09]: A necessity to have a sensor with the ability to read movements of people playing.

998
01:17:13,526 --> 01:17:16,748
[SPEAKER_09]: In other words, going to have a tilt sensor sort of like the iPhone.

999
01:17:19,369 --> 01:17:25,953
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess they also have done some experiments with motion control gaming and stuff on the DS.

1000
01:17:27,593 --> 01:17:28,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, neat.

1001
01:17:29,774 --> 01:17:33,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Then also another rumor that's still going around is some sort of...

1002
01:17:35,977 --> 01:17:37,939
[SPEAKER_09]: 3G-like service for the DS.

1003
01:17:38,899 --> 01:17:48,907
[SPEAKER_09]: And something that they're going to have like DS Wi-Fi hotspots or something like that that you're going to be able to connect with people or download content or something like that.

1004
01:17:49,427 --> 01:17:57,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, they said there's going to be a new Zelda game sort of revealed, I guess, revealed this year at E3.

1005
01:17:58,394 --> 01:18:00,515
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it was sort of revealed last year, but...

1006
01:18:01,596 --> 01:18:02,076
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.

1007
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:29,675
[SPEAKER_09]: There's actually been some demos put out by Engine Software.

1008
01:18:29,735 --> 01:18:32,198
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a studio that develops different games.

1009
01:18:32,638 --> 01:18:41,148
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a demo of a game called Tilt that kind of looks a little bit like Marble Blast Ultra or like Monkey Ball or something like that.

1010
01:18:41,608 --> 01:18:58,326
[SPEAKER_09]: and it does tilt sensors or I guess motion control based on the camera because you remember the DSi has a camera built into it and can detect movement so you can basically do that it acts like tilting the actual system

1011
01:19:01,307 --> 01:19:01,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1012
01:19:19,268 --> 01:19:20,729
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what to call it.

1013
01:19:20,770 --> 01:19:21,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Drivers, I guess.

1014
01:19:21,550 --> 01:19:32,039
[SPEAKER_09]: The libraries for this technology, this company has it available for, I guess this is working on a DSiWare game that's going to incorporate this new technology.

1015
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:35,722
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be cool to see, but I don't know.

1016
01:19:35,822 --> 01:19:38,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we really need motion sensors with a portable system?

1017
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:39,605
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if that's the case.

1018
01:19:39,866 --> 01:19:43,008
[SPEAKER_09]: I can understand it with the iPhone because there's no actual buttons on it.

1019
01:19:43,168 --> 01:19:45,010
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, so how else are you going to control stuff?

1020
01:19:47,092 --> 01:19:47,292
[SPEAKER_09]: But

1021
01:19:48,755 --> 01:19:50,775
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, maybe we'll see the buttons go away.

1022
01:19:50,795 --> 01:19:52,116
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be kind of crappy, though.

1023
01:19:54,916 --> 01:19:55,236
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1024
01:19:55,516 --> 01:20:00,257
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very interesting, though, that there's a new DS kind of definitely in the works, it sounds like, for E3.

1025
01:20:00,297 --> 01:20:02,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, that could be their big announcement this year is that, hey, new DS.

1026
01:20:02,938 --> 01:20:07,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Wouldn't that piss everybody off because now they have this DS XL or whatever?

1027
01:20:07,139 --> 01:20:07,799
[SPEAKER_09]: But not in America.

1028
01:20:08,059 --> 01:20:08,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Not in America.

1029
01:20:08,419 --> 01:20:09,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they don't plan on bringing it here because of that.

1030
01:20:10,019 --> 01:20:12,440
[SPEAKER_09]: But they just brought out the DSi, what, a year ago?

1031
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:12,960
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

1032
01:20:14,216 --> 01:20:15,037
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what though?

1033
01:20:15,077 --> 01:20:15,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, you know what though?

1034
01:20:16,059 --> 01:20:18,521
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't... Apple puts out a new phone every year.

1035
01:20:19,082 --> 01:20:20,664
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, is that different?

1036
01:20:20,704 --> 01:20:21,024
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1037
01:20:21,665 --> 01:20:23,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but that's just the specs slightly upgraded.

1038
01:20:23,828 --> 01:20:25,830
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to be a whole new system.

1039
01:20:26,431 --> 01:20:26,771
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1040
01:20:26,931 --> 01:20:27,052
[SPEAKER_09]: It's...

1041
01:20:28,587 --> 01:20:28,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop.

1042
01:20:29,248 --> 01:20:30,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Just make some good games for it.

1043
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:35,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you really utilized this new technology and all these different upgrades yet?

1044
01:20:36,214 --> 01:20:37,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Have they really done anything with the cameras?

1045
01:20:37,876 --> 01:20:39,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, look, now you can put your face in this.

1046
01:20:40,018 --> 01:20:40,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wow.

1047
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:41,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

1048
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:44,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, Nintendo hasn't really done anything with the camera.

1049
01:20:44,763 --> 01:20:51,629
[SPEAKER_10]: DSi needs an app like the unicorn thing on the iPhone where you can take pictures of people and turn them into unicorns.

1050
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:53,351
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1051
01:21:16,414 --> 01:21:17,595
[SPEAKER_09]: and then they move on to something else.

1052
01:21:17,655 --> 01:21:19,556
[SPEAKER_09]: But they haven't even really done anything with it.

1053
01:21:19,636 --> 01:21:22,117
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like the IR port in the PSP is completely useless.

1054
01:21:22,578 --> 01:21:25,919
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd just be perfectly happy if they had a built-in Mario Paint mode.

1055
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:28,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we've got to keep the show moving.

1056
01:21:28,461 --> 01:21:36,185
[SPEAKER_10]: I do want to say real quick though, Giovedea in chat had a really good suggestion for the game's name that was inspired by Tigerclaw, you know, the whole turn-in-the-crank game.

1057
01:21:36,466 --> 01:21:37,966
[SPEAKER_10]: She says they ought to just call it Beat It!

1058
01:21:38,627 --> 01:21:40,348
[SPEAKER_10]: And you could already have some soundtrack in it.

1059
01:21:46,247 --> 01:21:47,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Aw yeah, this game's hot.

1060
01:21:49,949 --> 01:21:51,309
[SPEAKER_10]: I just scarred all of our listeners.

1061
01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:55,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, hey, one other music game that might be for real, for serious.

1062
01:21:55,751 --> 01:21:56,151
[SPEAKER_10]: No, really.

1063
01:21:56,891 --> 01:21:58,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Def Leppard, the game.

1064
01:21:59,252 --> 01:22:01,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently it's coming from a Reuters report.

1065
01:22:01,392 --> 01:22:04,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Reuters being one of the big news agencies with Associated Press, of course.

1066
01:22:04,733 --> 01:22:12,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently the publishing company Primary Wave made a deal with Def Leppard to make a cartoon series and a video game that will be based on the band.

1067
01:22:13,076 --> 01:22:15,516
[SPEAKER_10]: The video game project is being called Unusual.

1068
01:22:16,357 --> 01:22:17,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't know what that means.

1069
01:22:17,817 --> 01:22:17,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh...

1070
01:22:19,505 --> 01:22:20,706
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's just all a rumor right now.

1071
01:22:20,746 --> 01:22:25,211
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not some type of Def Leppard rock band or anything like that.

1072
01:22:25,271 --> 01:22:26,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Perhaps Revolution Def?

1073
01:22:27,974 --> 01:22:28,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Eh?

1074
01:22:28,495 --> 01:22:28,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Eh?

1075
01:22:28,975 --> 01:22:29,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Sequel, maybe?

1076
01:22:30,037 --> 01:22:30,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes?

1077
01:22:30,797 --> 01:22:31,598
[SPEAKER_09]: It's unusual.

1078
01:22:31,778 --> 01:22:32,699
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be unusual.

1079
01:22:33,604 --> 01:22:33,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Elvish

1080
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,941
[SPEAKER_09]: might, you know, be big enough.

1081
01:23:05,041 --> 01:23:06,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Or U2, I think, was a really good idea.

1082
01:23:06,661 --> 01:23:07,982
[SPEAKER_10]: I think U2 could get their own game.

1083
01:23:08,002 --> 01:23:10,362
[SPEAKER_05]: If it was an Elvis game, though, you'd have to have sensors on your hips.

1084
01:23:13,263 --> 01:23:16,004
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of want to see the focus away from these band-specific music games.

1085
01:23:16,364 --> 01:23:17,904
[SPEAKER_10]: It's getting to be a little much.

1086
01:23:18,024 --> 01:23:20,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Like Van Halen, let's face it, was not that great.

1087
01:23:20,705 --> 01:23:23,045
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an excuse to release another game.

1088
01:23:23,205 --> 01:23:23,325
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1089
01:23:23,345 --> 01:23:25,046
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really what it is, because you can sell extra copies.

1090
01:23:26,206 --> 01:23:32,128
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's keep in mind, back it up a minute because keep in mind, this Def Leppard thing has nothing to do with Harmonix or Activision.

1091
01:23:32,168 --> 01:23:32,929
[SPEAKER_10]: It's another company.

1092
01:23:33,209 --> 01:23:35,910
[SPEAKER_10]: So if there is a music game coming out, it's different.

1093
01:23:36,570 --> 01:23:37,490
[SPEAKER_10]: That could be anything.

1094
01:23:38,771 --> 01:23:39,331
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know though.

1095
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:40,692
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's all talk.

1096
01:23:40,892 --> 01:23:41,572
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it'll happen.

1097
01:23:42,918 --> 01:23:45,921
[SPEAKER_10]: I think if they do the test marketing and sampling, they're going to find there's not enough interest for it.

1098
01:23:45,941 --> 01:24:00,814
[SPEAKER_09]: And why would Def Leppard say, you know, oh, let's go with another company for a music game instead of jumping on an established franchise where they would get the marketing support and the popularity from the rock band or guitar hero franchises.

1099
01:24:01,294 --> 01:24:05,238
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't get why they would just go, eh, whatever, we don't need all that stuff.

1100
01:24:05,518 --> 01:24:06,379
[SPEAKER_09]: We're Def Leppard.

1101
01:24:07,718 --> 01:24:09,119
[SPEAKER_01]: I did like their last album.

1102
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:13,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I don't think it's like sold platinum copies, you know?

1103
01:24:13,202 --> 01:24:16,144
[SPEAKER_10]: They're kind of more of a nostalgia band at this point.

1104
01:24:16,164 --> 01:24:16,625
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, though?

1105
01:24:17,585 --> 01:24:19,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Bon Jovi's new album?

1106
01:24:19,126 --> 01:24:19,727
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a gift.

1107
01:24:20,007 --> 01:24:20,828
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like Bon Jovi.

1108
01:24:21,068 --> 01:24:21,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I love Bon Jovi.

1109
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:22,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, anyhow.

1110
01:24:23,289 --> 01:24:34,257
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the part of the show, speaking of blasts from the past, where we like to open up the vault and take a trip down memory lane and, you know, respect the classics with a little segment we do here on OLR called the Classic Game of the Week.

1111
01:24:34,617 --> 01:24:45,827
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura is going to jump into the vault and find a game that she says, you know what, you kids today that don't listen to your Def Leppard and Bon Jovi like you should, you need to go back and look at this classic game from the past.

1112
01:24:46,027 --> 01:24:47,929
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?

1113
01:24:48,189 --> 01:24:49,790
[SPEAKER_05]: The classic game is NBA Jam.

1114
01:24:50,551 --> 01:24:50,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course.

1115
01:24:51,692 --> 01:24:58,177
[SPEAKER_05]: And because there is no actual music really played much in the game while you're playing, I just found arcade samples.

1116
01:24:59,939 --> 01:25:00,099
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1117
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:05,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Boom Shakalaka!

1118
01:25:06,341 --> 01:25:06,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1119
01:25:07,402 --> 01:25:08,223
[SPEAKER_10]: He's on fire!

1120
01:25:09,083 --> 01:25:15,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, NBA Jam came out in 1993 for the arcade, and it spawned a series.

1121
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:17,832
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, it was written in assembly.

1122
01:25:18,853 --> 01:25:23,737
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, as I said in an earlier story, it was designed and programmed by Mark Turmel.

1123
01:25:25,866 --> 01:25:43,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it used, um, a lot of the big names from the 92, 93 NBA system, and then, um, of course for the console releases, it used the 93, 94, um, and there have been, uh, later versions that came out on Sega CD, Game Boy, and Game Gear.

1124
01:25:45,023 --> 01:25:45,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1125
01:25:47,054 --> 01:26:03,463
[SPEAKER_05]: so but of course there were certain um licensing things like they couldn't get Michael Jordan for um the Bulls at the time so um they did get Scottie Pippen at the time they also got um certain ones were missing from the home versions like Gary Payton and Shaquille O'Neal um

1126
01:26:06,357 --> 01:26:11,678
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also, of course, as we mentioned, a possibility of it being out on Wii.

1127
01:26:12,518 --> 01:26:15,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the pretty cool stuff, though, is this game.

1128
01:26:16,179 --> 01:26:27,242
[SPEAKER_05]: What I think is really the notable part of it is that the games had their digitized likenesses of the players included in the games so that you could see their faces while they played.

1129
01:26:28,042 --> 01:26:31,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then if you got three baskets in a row, you were on fire.

1130
01:26:32,006 --> 01:26:37,731
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, so, uh, you could, you know, be unlimited turbo, no goaltending.

1131
01:26:38,091 --> 01:26:41,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you could shoot better until the other team scored.

1132
01:26:42,775 --> 01:26:42,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1133
01:26:46,269 --> 01:26:51,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, you know, you didn't have fouls, free throws, that type of thing.

1134
01:26:52,552 --> 01:26:55,634
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've got your spectacular dunk shots.

1135
01:26:55,894 --> 01:26:58,616
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was really more of a fantasy basketball type game.

1136
01:26:59,836 --> 01:27:14,224
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as Easter eggs that were in the game, you could... Like, the Genesis actually had one, and I remember this one, Super Clean Floors, where if you run too fast, you could slide and fall.

1137
01:27:15,925 --> 01:27:18,627
[SPEAKER_05]: and then there were the hidden characters like you could play as Bill Clinton.

1138
01:27:20,228 --> 01:27:22,329
[SPEAKER_05]: You could play the Charlotte Hornets mascot.

1139
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:31,955
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there were early versions of NBA Jam Tournament Edition that let you play as Mortal Kombat characters.

1140
01:27:33,396 --> 01:27:40,460
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually remembered playing beta versions of the game.

1141
01:27:41,221 --> 01:27:43,302
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, you should play the Tournament Edition one that I linked up.

1142
01:27:43,678 --> 01:27:47,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, um, okay, I just keep hopping from music to music.

1143
01:27:47,883 --> 01:27:48,364
[SPEAKER_05]: That one's fine.

1144
01:27:48,764 --> 01:27:49,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1145
01:27:49,124 --> 01:27:52,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the Tournament Edition halftime music that I linked up in...

1146
01:27:53,930 --> 01:27:54,771
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I'll get it.

1147
01:27:55,031 --> 01:28:02,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but anyway, they actually were taken out because of the violence the Mortal Kombat characters represented.

1148
01:28:03,734 --> 01:28:06,895
[SPEAKER_05]: However, like I said, I played beta versions of it that everyone was in.

1149
01:28:07,416 --> 01:28:14,578
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there were a lot of... For NBA Jam and Mortal Kombat 2, there were a lot of...

1150
01:28:16,299 --> 01:28:19,622
[SPEAKER_05]: and beta versions of the games on the East Coast.

1151
01:28:19,962 --> 01:28:21,883
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got to check those out at the time.

1152
01:28:21,903 --> 01:28:24,105
[SPEAKER_05]: It was that year I went to New York.

1153
01:28:24,766 --> 01:28:26,006
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got to see them a lot on the way up the East Coast.

1154
01:28:26,026 --> 01:28:27,287
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty cool.

1155
01:28:28,668 --> 01:28:40,978
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, just to go over some of the people in the arcade version, you had Shaquille O'Neal, you had Isaiah Thomas, you had Reggie Miller, Harvey Grant.

1156
01:28:42,098 --> 01:28:43,700
[SPEAKER_05]: For the SNES Genesis one...

1157
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:47,726
[SPEAKER_05]: like some of the other people in there were Alonzo Warnings, Scottie Pippen

1158
01:28:50,003 --> 01:29:08,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Patrick Ewing, Sega CD, you had a lot of the same people, just newer updates to them, and then of course you had the Game Gear ones, so really a lot of the same people, although there were a few that for licensing issues were out.

1159
01:29:10,997 --> 01:29:17,641
[SPEAKER_05]: You also, you know, you had Charles Barkley, you had just all the big people, you know, for

1160
01:29:19,827 --> 01:29:21,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if anyone kept up with basketball back then.

1161
01:29:22,009 --> 01:29:22,649
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually did.

1162
01:29:22,669 --> 01:29:26,032
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was pretty cool.

1163
01:29:26,192 --> 01:29:27,793
[SPEAKER_05]: There were sequels.

1164
01:29:28,954 --> 01:29:31,196
[SPEAKER_05]: There was an NBA Jam Tournament Edition.

1165
01:29:32,557 --> 01:29:35,299
[SPEAKER_05]: There were all kinds of different ports.

1166
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:40,663
[SPEAKER_05]: There was actually even an Atari Jaguar version of it.

1167
01:29:41,464 --> 01:29:47,768
[SPEAKER_05]: There was NBA Jam Extreme in 1996, which was a 3D version that had Marv Albert doing the commentary.

1168
01:29:51,522 --> 01:30:01,161
[SPEAKER_05]: There was... It actually was revised as NBA Hangtime.

1169
01:30:01,541 --> 01:30:02,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember that one?

1170
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:03,420
[SPEAKER_10]: I do.

1171
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't the same.

1172
01:30:05,541 --> 01:30:08,083
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a college version that's called College Slam.

1173
01:30:09,323 --> 01:30:15,946
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there were, of course, all the other sports games that Midway did.

1174
01:30:16,127 --> 01:30:19,048
[SPEAKER_05]: They did a two-on-two open ice challenge.

1175
01:30:20,409 --> 01:30:24,531
[SPEAKER_05]: But then it came out as Wayne Gretzky 3D hockey and NFL Blitz.

1176
01:30:25,691 --> 01:30:27,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Blitz, I think, was another one in the thing.

1177
01:30:27,872 --> 01:30:31,494
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think more of a spiritual successor, though, at NBA Jam was the NBA Showtime

1178
01:30:33,215 --> 01:30:35,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey Jamie, what did you have for breakfast today?

1179
01:30:35,396 --> 01:30:35,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't.

1180
01:30:59,656 --> 01:31:00,176
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

1181
01:31:00,837 --> 01:31:03,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there, uh, the, uh, it's in the shoes?

1182
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:04,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is it the shoes?

1183
01:31:06,282 --> 01:31:06,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my!

1184
01:31:07,062 --> 01:31:07,983
[SPEAKER_05]: He's on fire!

1185
01:31:08,544 --> 01:31:08,704
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1186
01:31:10,165 --> 01:31:11,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm out of town!

1187
01:31:11,806 --> 01:31:14,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, one of my favorite ones was, um, Couldn't Buy a Bucket.

1188
01:31:15,590 --> 01:31:16,390
Heating up!

1189
01:31:18,012 --> 01:31:18,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Ugly shot!

1190
01:31:19,233 --> 01:31:19,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1191
01:31:22,255 --> 01:31:23,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Fantastic!

1192
01:31:23,577 --> 01:31:27,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I'll cut it out, but I just... I thought that you'd get a kick out of Marv Albert being...

1193
01:31:29,286 --> 01:31:30,907
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of funny.

1194
01:31:30,927 --> 01:31:36,010
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not a big, big fan of sports games usually.

1195
01:31:36,510 --> 01:31:37,711
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't watch a lot.

1196
01:31:38,472 --> 01:31:39,672
[SPEAKER_10]: But I loved NBA Jam.

1197
01:31:39,912 --> 01:31:41,413
[SPEAKER_05]: I played the crap out of that game.

1198
01:31:41,814 --> 01:31:43,835
[SPEAKER_10]: And if I do watch any sports, it's probably basketball.

1199
01:31:44,015 --> 01:31:45,116
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the one I like more than anything.

1200
01:31:46,609 --> 01:31:50,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, we've got plenty more gaming news coming up later in the show here.

1201
01:31:50,712 --> 01:31:53,054
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to take a quick break, though, for our live folks.

1202
01:31:53,574 --> 01:31:55,456
[SPEAKER_10]: For you podcast folks, just sit on tight.

1203
01:31:55,476 --> 01:31:56,977
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be right back after a little interlude.

1204
01:31:57,277 --> 01:32:00,860
[SPEAKER_10]: But when we come back after the break, we've got a lot of rapid-fire news tonight.

1205
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:01,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Some quick stuff.

1206
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:02,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Your Twitter topics.

1207
01:32:02,821 --> 01:32:05,343
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to talk a little bit about some Blizzard rumors.

1208
01:32:05,703 --> 01:32:08,065
[SPEAKER_10]: A game that apparently is no longer being published or shipped.

1209
01:32:08,545 --> 01:32:10,727
[SPEAKER_10]: A Wii Wand with MotionPlus built in.

1210
01:32:11,187 --> 01:32:12,188
[SPEAKER_10]: And plenty more when we come back.

1211
01:32:13,311 --> 01:32:13,972
[SPEAKER_10]: from a quick break.

1212
01:32:14,032 --> 01:32:14,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me.

1213
01:32:15,054 --> 01:32:15,534
[SPEAKER_10]: We're live.

1214
01:32:15,615 --> 01:32:16,236
[SPEAKER_10]: I have the hiccups.

1215
01:32:16,276 --> 01:32:16,836
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't handle it.

1216
01:32:17,137 --> 01:32:18,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so I'm glad we're taking a break right now.

1217
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:22,685
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1218
01:32:28,695 --> 01:32:29,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio

1219
01:32:47,515 --> 01:32:47,956
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.com.

1220
01:33:10,057 --> 01:33:16,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Dragon Age Origins is getting a brand new expansion in March.

1221
01:33:17,421 --> 01:33:21,644
[SPEAKER_09]: The new expansion is called Awakening, and it'll be coming out March 16th.

1222
01:33:21,904 --> 01:33:27,087
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be the first retail expansion for Dragon Age Origins.

1223
01:33:27,587 --> 01:33:31,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, it's going to be available for $40.

1224
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:34,351
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if that's actually coming out.

1225
01:33:34,451 --> 01:33:36,392
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's also on $360 as well.

1226
01:33:36,732 --> 01:33:38,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn, that's kind of expensive. $40?! !

1227
01:33:40,555 --> 01:33:41,235
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1228
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:08,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Left 4 Dead is kind of getting a demake.

1229
01:34:09,782 --> 01:34:18,686
[SPEAKER_09]: They have an 8-bit version of Left 4 Dead that's been made by a guy named Eric Ruth.

1230
01:34:19,486 --> 01:34:21,747
[SPEAKER_09]: And the game looks like it should be on the NES.

1231
01:34:21,807 --> 01:34:23,328
[SPEAKER_09]: It supports up to two players.

1232
01:34:23,688 --> 01:34:27,270
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's basically a PC version that is available to download right now.

1233
01:34:28,130 --> 01:34:30,511
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can go find that, I believe.

1234
01:34:32,180 --> 01:34:44,916
[SPEAKER_09]: They have it available on, he has his own website on Google Sites.google.com slash site slash Eric David Ruth Is it a hack of a game?

1235
01:34:45,638 --> 01:34:47,338
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1236
01:34:48,119 --> 01:34:50,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Slash game dash left for dead.

1237
01:34:50,979 --> 01:34:53,400
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's just like how you would spell the actual title.

1238
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:55,520
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's available.

1239
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, you could do a search on Google and probably find it.

1240
01:34:58,180 --> 01:34:58,941
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's pretty cool looking.

1241
01:34:59,561 --> 01:35:02,481
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was an NES ROM hack at first, but no, it's a PC game.

1242
01:35:03,802 --> 01:35:04,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I get it.

1243
01:35:04,362 --> 01:35:04,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1244
01:35:05,262 --> 01:35:06,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Gotta put it on my cabinet, though.

1245
01:35:06,962 --> 01:35:07,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not?

1246
01:35:07,262 --> 01:35:08,983
[SPEAKER_09]: It's two player.

1247
01:35:10,423 --> 01:35:10,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Also...

1248
01:35:11,986 --> 01:35:18,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Rock Band on PlayStation 3 is being patched, or Rock Band 2 I should say, being patched on the PS3 to make way for the Rock Band Network.

1249
01:35:19,110 --> 01:35:20,951
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's kind of cool.

1250
01:35:21,151 --> 01:35:34,979
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to actually have the Rock Band Network store in the interface, I guess, selling songs directly added by Rock Band fans and musicians and record labels through the new Rock Band Network.

1251
01:35:35,260 --> 01:35:39,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I'm surprised, is this even available right now for the Xbox?

1252
01:35:39,262 --> 01:35:39,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1253
01:35:39,875 --> 01:35:41,677
[SPEAKER_10]: A more robust handling of chord hammer-ons and pull-offs.

1254
01:36:03,055 --> 01:36:03,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

1255
01:36:22,925 --> 01:36:48,876
[SPEAKER_09]: and then also Half-Life 2 on PC has a mod added to it now to update the graphics this is going to be kind of on par with what we saw in Half-Life Episode 2 kind of like what we saw in the Orange Box that they released and the mod adds a bunch of new detail into the game more realistic graphics, new models, what not about damn time

1256
01:36:49,116 --> 01:36:50,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it looks pretty sweet.

1257
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:54,489
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently, right now, I believe it's just...

1258
01:36:56,363 --> 01:37:01,686
[SPEAKER_09]: He's working on Episode 1 as well right now, so that should be coming soon.

1259
01:37:02,306 --> 01:37:13,831
[SPEAKER_09]: But it basically adds HDR, high dynamic range lighting, also new updated models, textures, and 32 Steam achievements as well.

1260
01:37:14,592 --> 01:37:17,033
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's available, I believe, right now.

1261
01:37:17,493 --> 01:37:23,196
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can probably find that on your favorite mod site, or yeah, it's on the Steam-powered forums.

1262
01:37:24,276 --> 01:37:25,477
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a link on there somewhere.

1263
01:37:25,737 --> 01:37:27,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Half-Life 2 is a pretty epic game.

1264
01:37:27,478 --> 01:37:30,320
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that it should fit the play.

1265
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:36,484
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm almost surprised that they haven't released an update themselves because it does look really good, the new graphics.

1266
01:37:38,085 --> 01:37:40,046
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm surprised that Valve hasn't done it themselves.

1267
01:37:40,386 --> 01:37:41,267
[SPEAKER_09]: But hey, someone else did.

1268
01:37:43,094 --> 01:37:43,794
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's it.

1269
01:38:03,803 --> 01:38:06,025
[SPEAKER_10]: January 14th is the Vampire Weekend.

1270
01:38:06,185 --> 01:38:11,990
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're a fan of them, Holiday, Cousins, and the Kids Don't Stand a Chance, we'll all hit Band Hero and Guitar Hero 5 on the 14th.

1271
01:38:12,430 --> 01:38:15,272
[SPEAKER_10]: January 21st is a metal track pack.

1272
01:38:15,632 --> 01:38:23,839
[SPEAKER_10]: You get Shadow's Fall with Still I Rise, Amon Amaroth with Twilight of the Thunder God, and get this, Death Lock with Laser Cannon Death Sentence.

1273
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:26,721
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're a fan of Metalocalypse, you'll like that.

1274
01:38:26,781 --> 01:38:28,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I fully threw up the horns for that.

1275
01:38:28,363 --> 01:38:31,105
[SPEAKER_10]: And then on the 28th, Credence Clearwater Revival.

1276
01:38:31,505 --> 01:38:58,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Proud Mary and Bad Moon Rising and Travelin' Band No, I totally am going to get those That's a very diverse lineup We'll put it that way Rock Band, not to be ignored, is doing their weekly announcement as well And this will be available this week on the 12th or the 14th Depending on what system you're on It's Alice in Chains Some new songs by them Grind, Heaven Beside You, Last of My Kind, We Die Young, and Your Decision So if you're an Alice in Chains fan, you're happy this week

1277
01:38:59,023 --> 01:39:22,953
[SPEAKER_10]: and Microsoft has announced that Project Natal is coming this holiday season 2010 that was straight from the CES 2010 keynote I don't think that really surprises anyone though but they are committing to that time frame it will be out holiday 2010 no official name though it is still being called Project Natal that may end up being its name maybe just Natal I don't know but they are still calling it that at least in their press conferences hopefully they don't call it something stupid like we

1278
01:39:24,588 --> 01:39:25,688
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1279
01:39:47,594 --> 01:39:47,894
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura

1280
01:40:04,926 --> 01:40:12,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Squeenix actually put out from the North American group that they are putting Mere out in the spring.

1281
01:40:13,732 --> 01:40:21,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Not sure if Europe is included as well, but it's by the group that did Bullet Witch and Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles.

1282
01:40:29,964 --> 01:40:35,593
[SPEAKER_05]: There is, though, a PS3 exclusive version that's only going to be out in Japan called Nier Replicant.

1283
01:40:36,594 --> 01:40:41,542
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm actually really looking forward to this game, so I can't wait until we get it.

1284
01:40:41,722 --> 01:40:43,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm going to have to wait, but I'll look forward to it.

1285
01:40:44,386 --> 01:40:58,981
[SPEAKER_05]: and then also Squeenix is bringing out Death by Cube on Xbox Live Arcade on the 20th of this month it's another twin stick multi-directional shooter type of game excuse me

1286
01:40:59,822 --> 01:41:04,265
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's actually going to be based off of a bit of Robotron and Smash TV.

1287
01:41:04,405 --> 01:41:05,505
[SPEAKER_05]: So that'd be pretty good.

1288
01:41:06,186 --> 01:41:07,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are fun games.

1289
01:41:07,787 --> 01:41:08,667
[SPEAKER_05]: More money, more prizes.

1290
01:41:08,707 --> 01:41:09,087
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

1291
01:41:09,347 --> 01:41:11,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Not to be confused with Death by Companion Cube.

1292
01:41:12,329 --> 01:41:12,449
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1293
01:41:13,230 --> 01:41:14,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Cube, as in the movie.

1294
01:41:15,031 --> 01:41:15,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1295
01:41:16,452 --> 01:41:21,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Heavy Rain also has an official release date, but it's not the 16th.

1296
01:41:22,836 --> 01:41:23,997
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the 23rd.

1297
01:41:24,838 --> 01:41:29,702
[SPEAKER_05]: It was actually confirmed also by Sony.

1298
01:41:30,622 --> 01:41:42,452
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you pre-order the game, you get free launch day access to the first downloadable Heavy Rain Chronicles episode, and otherwise it will be coming out later and you can pay five bucks for it then.

1299
01:41:43,172 --> 01:41:49,584
[SPEAKER_05]: The European release dates for that is February 14th for mainland and February 26th for UK and Ireland.

1300
01:41:52,029 --> 01:41:55,911
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have Xbox Live stuff.

1301
01:41:56,991 --> 01:41:58,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, more Xbox Live stuff.

1302
01:41:58,792 --> 01:42:07,695
[SPEAKER_05]: They're actually saying that the Japanese developed games are more popular than most of the U.S.

1303
01:42:07,875 --> 01:42:10,076
[SPEAKER_05]: ones, except for Castle Crashers.

1304
01:42:10,156 --> 01:42:14,278
[SPEAKER_05]: But the ones that have been getting the most sales have been Virtual Lawn.

1305
01:42:15,258 --> 01:42:18,759
[SPEAKER_05]: and Ikaruga and Triggerheart Excellica.

1306
01:42:20,159 --> 01:42:37,822
[SPEAKER_05]: So actually, if you want to look at the top 10 Xbox Live Arcade games, just for 2009 in order, there's Virtualon, Oratario Tangram, Battlefield 1943, Castle Crashers, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Trials HD, R-Type Dimension, Shadow Complex, Ikaruga, King of Fighters 98, and Mega Man 9.

1307
01:42:38,842 --> 01:42:43,363
[SPEAKER_05]: But over all time, number one is Castle Crashers, Virtualon, Oratario Tangram,

1308
01:42:43,863 --> 01:42:51,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Ikaruga, Bomberman Live, Battlefield 1943, Triggerheart, Exelica, Uno, Dracula X, Fatal Fury Special, and Rez HD.

1309
01:42:51,586 --> 01:42:53,266
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe that's from Japan, though.

1310
01:42:53,366 --> 01:42:53,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1311
01:42:54,267 --> 01:42:55,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Not here in the U.S.

1312
01:42:55,407 --> 01:42:58,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think here the list would read something like, you know, Uno.

1313
01:42:59,488 --> 01:42:59,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1314
01:43:00,169 --> 01:43:00,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably.

1315
01:43:00,789 --> 01:43:00,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1316
01:43:01,569 --> 01:43:01,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow.

1317
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:03,410
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1318
01:43:03,470 --> 01:43:07,911
[SPEAKER_10]: If that does it for the rapid-fire news tonight, then let's get to some Twitter topics.

1319
01:43:07,951 --> 01:43:12,333
[SPEAKER_09]: I did want to say real quick, just to make a comment about the Xbox Live stats in Japan.

1320
01:43:13,333 --> 01:43:20,400
[SPEAKER_09]: I am very proud of a game that I actually played quite often and unfortunately didn't get as much love as I would have liked it over here.

1321
01:43:21,340 --> 01:43:30,408
[SPEAKER_09]: On Games on Demand, the top game downloaded in 2009 from Japan, Earth Defense Force 3, better known as Earth Defense Force 2017 over here.

1322
01:43:31,129 --> 01:43:33,951
[SPEAKER_09]: The greatest game featuring giant ants.

1323
01:43:34,872 --> 01:43:36,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Not as good as Bayonetta though, I'm telling you.

1324
01:43:37,674 --> 01:43:38,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Telling you.

1325
01:43:39,266 --> 01:43:42,447
[SPEAKER_09]: So good, in fact, I actually have four copies of this game.

1326
01:43:42,627 --> 01:43:42,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1327
01:43:43,527 --> 01:43:44,667
[SPEAKER_09]: I have saved three.

1328
01:43:44,727 --> 01:43:47,008
[SPEAKER_09]: I was eventually going to give them out on the show at some point.

1329
01:43:47,368 --> 01:43:49,528
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't done it yet, but they're collecting dust.

1330
01:43:50,109 --> 01:43:50,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Soon.

1331
01:43:51,069 --> 01:43:52,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get to Twitter topics tonight.

1332
01:43:52,929 --> 01:44:00,791
[SPEAKER_10]: We ask you guys every week for you guys to send your tweets to OLR on Twitter about things you think we maybe missed or topics you want us to discuss.

1333
01:44:01,191 --> 01:44:04,012
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a few tweets tonight, a lot of story referrals tonight.

1334
01:44:04,712 --> 01:44:06,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft says, I got a couple Twitter topics for you.

1335
01:44:06,713 --> 01:44:10,675
[SPEAKER_10]: One of them is coming up later in the show, but the other one has to do with Gran Turismo 5 details.

1336
01:44:10,955 --> 01:44:12,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently some more details came out about the game.

1337
01:44:13,416 --> 01:44:16,578
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's in the February edition of the PlayStation Official Magazine.

1338
01:44:16,898 --> 01:44:30,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Over 1,000 vehicles, modeled cockpits, physical and mechanical damage modeling, Indy cars and tracks included, NASCAR cars and tracks included, up to 16 players online, high-definition video uploads directly to YouTube.

1339
01:44:30,505 --> 01:44:31,185
[SPEAKER_10]: That's interesting.

1340
01:44:31,625 --> 01:44:37,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Multi-display rendering, head tracking, full weather and night racing on all tracks, night and day cycle on all tracks.

1341
01:44:37,328 --> 01:44:38,768
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be a pretty intense game.

1342
01:44:39,468 --> 01:44:40,389
[SPEAKER_10]: Gran Turismo 5.

1343
01:44:40,489 --> 01:44:43,150
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure that's going to be a huge thing they're going to show at E3 this year.

1344
01:44:44,551 --> 01:44:44,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on.

1345
01:44:44,991 --> 01:44:45,451
[SPEAKER_10]: I doubt it.

1346
01:44:45,511 --> 01:44:46,692
[SPEAKER_10]: It's coming out in February.

1347
01:44:47,012 --> 01:44:47,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it that soon?

1348
01:44:47,632 --> 01:44:48,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I know.

1349
01:44:48,072 --> 01:44:48,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Not February.

1350
01:44:49,293 --> 01:44:49,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Like April.

1351
01:44:50,713 --> 01:44:51,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wow.

1352
01:44:51,073 --> 01:44:52,094
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't realize it was that soon.

1353
01:44:52,474 --> 01:44:52,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Dang.

1354
01:44:53,194 --> 01:44:53,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, cool.

1355
01:44:54,795 --> 01:44:56,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that just in Japan or is that over here too?

1356
01:44:56,336 --> 01:44:56,736
[SPEAKER_10]: That's over here.

1357
01:44:58,733 --> 01:45:07,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Ionotropic sent us a tweet, Final Fantasy XIII apparently is the biggest swindle ever, and links us to this topic of a thing that we ran on Destructoid.

1358
01:45:07,675 --> 01:45:10,916
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a really negative review that came from a Hong Kong magazine.

1359
01:45:11,856 --> 01:45:16,497
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess, and I'm trying to see what the name of the magazine is here, I don't see it, but it was some magazine in Hong Kong.

1360
01:45:16,997 --> 01:45:21,938
[SPEAKER_10]: They called Final Fantasy XIII the biggest joke of 2009, saying the game is completely linear-y.

1361
01:45:23,238 --> 01:45:24,598
[SPEAKER_10]: until the open area is near the end.

1362
01:45:24,618 --> 01:45:26,019
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't even backtrack.

1363
01:45:26,379 --> 01:45:33,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Of all the RPGs I've played in recent years, this is the first which has been so linear that it is little more than riding an amusement park ride.

1364
01:45:34,181 --> 01:45:34,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Yowch.

1365
01:45:34,841 --> 01:45:36,222
[SPEAKER_10]: They gave the game a 4 out of 10.

1366
01:45:37,622 --> 01:45:40,123
[SPEAKER_10]: They gave the scenario a 2, saying it's a tearjerker.

1367
01:45:40,163 --> 01:45:42,943
[SPEAKER_10]: The system a 1, saying it's such a crude system.

1368
01:45:43,364 --> 01:45:47,305
[SPEAKER_10]: They gave the graphics a 9 and the sound a 7, but then the enthusiasm was a 1.

1369
01:45:48,625 --> 01:45:51,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds like they just rated it low to get attention.

1370
01:45:51,686 --> 01:45:52,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it worked.

1371
01:45:54,611 --> 01:45:55,912
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

1372
01:45:56,012 --> 01:45:59,856
[SPEAKER_10]: That was from a Hong Kong magazine that I don't see the name of here.

1373
01:45:59,936 --> 01:46:01,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe somebody has it in chat.

1374
01:46:02,598 --> 01:46:05,060
[SPEAKER_10]: More links from our Twitter peoples.

1375
01:46:06,761 --> 01:46:11,205
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100Matt sent us a tweet that talks about a new hack glitch on Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.

1376
01:46:11,886 --> 01:46:15,389
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently some players have now turned into super speed players.

1377
01:46:16,590 --> 01:46:21,713
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess now if you get a certain hack for Modern Warfare 2, you can run around just as fast as possible.

1378
01:46:22,114 --> 01:46:26,076
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you cheat online with this, you are an asshole.

1379
01:46:27,317 --> 01:46:27,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

1380
01:46:28,117 --> 01:46:32,080
[SPEAKER_10]: TigerClaw305 links us to this story about Rockstar San Diego.

1381
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:37,823
[SPEAKER_10]: The wives apparently of many of the employees are demanding better work conditions for spouses.

1382
01:46:37,923 --> 01:46:38,764
[SPEAKER_10]: This is kind of interesting.

1383
01:46:39,404 --> 01:46:42,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently it's an open letter that was posted on a Gamasutra blog.

1384
01:46:42,927 --> 01:46:43,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Ouch.

1385
01:46:44,087 --> 01:47:13,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Rockstar San Diego meets the Midnight Club series of games and they're working on the Red Dead Revolver sequel right now apparently some of the blogs things are addressed in the blog 12 plus hour work days 6 day work weeks, cuts to medical benefits, a decline in bonuses and all that other stuff so apparently unfortunately the workers are not getting compensated the way they should be unfortunately in this economy it's not that easy to quit but at the same time that doesn't mean you abuse the workers I think if they really do have an issue though they should take it up with the state board

1386
01:47:13,436 --> 01:47:17,459
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're working 12 hours, they're getting time and a half and then double time plus.

1387
01:47:18,339 --> 01:47:21,762
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so I wouldn't be too alarmed about that.

1388
01:47:21,942 --> 01:47:23,343
[SPEAKER_05]: And you do have the option.

1389
01:47:24,844 --> 01:47:26,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is California.

1390
01:47:26,185 --> 01:47:27,766
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in the freaking workers paradise here.

1391
01:47:28,476 --> 01:47:33,979
[SPEAKER_10]: But when it's mandatory hours, and unfortunately this economy is not just easy to say, quick, go find something else.

1392
01:47:34,039 --> 01:47:35,079
[SPEAKER_05]: There isn't a lot out there right now.

1393
01:47:35,099 --> 01:47:38,641
[SPEAKER_05]: It technically is not legal to force a mandatory overtime.

1394
01:47:38,741 --> 01:47:39,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, they do it.

1395
01:47:39,301 --> 01:47:39,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Companies do it.

1396
01:47:39,802 --> 01:47:40,262
[SPEAKER_05]: They do it.

1397
01:47:40,702 --> 01:47:43,263
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you protest it, they don't have to schedule you for it.

1398
01:47:43,984 --> 01:47:49,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Because trust me, I have been scheduled for mandatory overtime and said, sorry, I have something else that I'm doing and gotten out of it.

1399
01:47:51,267 --> 01:47:52,448
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's law.

1400
01:47:52,888 --> 01:47:54,789
[SPEAKER_05]: They cannot make you do mandatory overtime.

1401
01:47:56,666 --> 01:48:01,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Black Wolf seems to think that California is one of the states that didn't give overtime to those doing computer programming.

1402
01:48:02,410 --> 01:48:03,691
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if there were exceptions.

1403
01:48:03,711 --> 01:48:08,374
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I don't work in that field, so I wouldn't know as closely, but I don't think there's really exceptions to that.

1404
01:48:08,394 --> 01:48:10,476
[SPEAKER_05]: The only way they can get out of that is if you're salaried.

1405
01:48:11,496 --> 01:48:24,265
[SPEAKER_05]: And even so, I know at my work, they actually, they are really, really anal on addressing your hours because they do crack down really hard if you've made someone work more than eight hours in a day.

1406
01:48:26,469 --> 01:48:28,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Spazinator PSN on Twitter sends a tweet.

1407
01:48:28,830 --> 01:48:32,351
[SPEAKER_10]: How about the reports of Natal possibly being gimped as a cost-cutting measure?

1408
01:48:33,231 --> 01:48:35,612
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you can gimp something you don't really know about.

1409
01:48:36,112 --> 01:48:39,033
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, this system has not really been put out there for the masses to consume.

1410
01:48:39,073 --> 01:48:41,214
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they didn't put it on the show floor at E3.

1411
01:48:41,234 --> 01:48:44,835
[SPEAKER_10]: It was only behind closed doors and I believed only in a demonstration capacity.

1412
01:48:45,175 --> 01:48:47,496
[SPEAKER_10]: So they might gimp it, but you'll never know.

1413
01:48:47,796 --> 01:49:04,742
[SPEAKER_09]: The other reason they're saying it's gimped is because there was a processor built into the camera before, but to reduce costs, they're now using the actual Xbox 360 processor, and because of that, it's going to take 10-15% of the system resources to process the Natal capture stuff.

1414
01:49:05,423 --> 01:49:08,264
[SPEAKER_10]: I see, so they're saying that the games are going to have some of their processing.

1415
01:49:08,284 --> 01:49:09,424
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to suffer because of that.

1416
01:49:09,604 --> 01:49:10,145
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what, though?

1417
01:49:10,165 --> 01:49:11,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, it's...

1418
01:49:11,846 --> 01:49:23,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but would you rather, okay, would you rather that they, the games maybe, you know, maybe they'll have to cut corners a little bit in the games and the, you know, say the Natal's like, I don't know, $79, $59 or whatever?

1419
01:49:26,104 --> 01:49:30,727
[SPEAKER_09]: versus, they don't cut corners in the game, Project Natal is $200.

1420
01:49:31,187 --> 01:49:34,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Plus that forces developers to make their games for Natal.

1421
01:49:34,289 --> 01:49:37,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, they can't just throw on Natal controls onto existing games.

1422
01:49:38,371 --> 01:49:40,833
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of like that aspect about it, actually.

1423
01:49:41,173 --> 01:49:43,855
[SPEAKER_10]: It forces programmers to make games for Natal.

1424
01:49:44,215 --> 01:49:44,715
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

1425
01:49:45,395 --> 01:49:45,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1426
01:49:45,696 --> 01:49:46,036
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

1427
01:49:46,776 --> 01:49:49,878
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pulling the Nintendo on them, if it's forcing them to do it.

1428
01:49:51,019 --> 01:49:53,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, for the longest time, Nintendo had their own proprietary...

1429
01:49:54,801 --> 01:49:55,343
[SPEAKER_10]: True, true.

1430
01:49:55,363 --> 01:49:57,070
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a big thing back in the day with the cartridges.

1431
01:49:57,873 --> 01:50:00,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby Blackwolf sends us a tweet wanting us to talk about Duke Nukem Forever.

1432
01:50:02,076 --> 01:50:02,516
[SPEAKER_10]: You jerk.

1433
01:50:03,216 --> 01:50:04,176
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know why I said that.

1434
01:50:04,897 --> 01:50:09,198
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you don't know why I said that, you can listen to Bobby's show, The Bobby Blackwolf Show, and our little phone call at the end.

1435
01:50:09,618 --> 01:50:14,259
[SPEAKER_10]: And why I do not believe Duke Nukem Forever is worthy of news coverage at all.

1436
01:50:14,839 --> 01:50:15,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now.

1437
01:50:15,819 --> 01:50:16,719
[SPEAKER_10]: At this time, no.

1438
01:50:17,479 --> 01:50:25,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Until they put something actually playable out there on the E3 show floor, and no more... I'm sick and tired of these video teases and things that just end up changing in a couple years anyway.

1439
01:50:26,441 --> 01:50:27,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Put your goddamn money where your mouth is.

1440
01:50:28,742 --> 01:50:29,702
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sick of talking about it.

1441
01:50:30,402 --> 01:50:33,825
[SPEAKER_10]: And look, I just spent a minute now talking about it, so please, let's move on with more stories.

1442
01:50:35,046 --> 01:50:36,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1443
01:50:37,908 --> 01:50:44,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's some other fun stuff, including Sony is apparently increasing the storage capacity of Blu-ray discs.

1444
01:50:45,475 --> 01:50:50,459
[SPEAKER_09]: The previous discs, of course, used by the PS3 were 25 gigabytes.

1445
01:50:50,599 --> 01:50:52,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Now they're being expanded to 33.4 gigabytes, meaning that...

1446
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:57,640
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.com.

1447
01:51:25,191 --> 01:51:27,873
[SPEAKER_09]: It still doesn't fix the fact that the Blu-ray drive is kind of slow.

1448
01:51:28,534 --> 01:51:29,895
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a little bit of a problem.

1449
01:51:29,935 --> 01:51:35,719
[SPEAKER_09]: But hey, uncompressed textures, all sorts of fun stuff to save on processing power.

1450
01:51:35,779 --> 01:51:38,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Could that mean larger installs down the line because the disc will hold more?

1451
01:51:38,942 --> 01:51:40,423
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to have to install more to my drive?

1452
01:51:41,854 --> 01:51:42,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Baby.

1453
01:51:44,075 --> 01:51:47,498
[SPEAKER_10]: That's neat though that they can kind of do that and not have to release a new PlayStation 3.

1454
01:51:48,038 --> 01:51:51,460
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I do kind of think that's a nice little feature is that they can kind of patch that in.

1455
01:51:52,141 --> 01:51:53,001
[SPEAKER_10]: That will come in handy.

1456
01:51:53,542 --> 01:51:58,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially when, you know, Final Fantasy 15 or whatever is on its way out and they want to do Uber cutscenes with it.

1457
01:51:58,825 --> 01:52:01,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Huge, huge rumor right now, speaking of like Uber games.

1458
01:52:02,408 --> 01:52:06,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, it's a rumor that Blizzard is currently working on a first-person MMO.

1459
01:52:06,510 --> 01:52:11,334
[SPEAKER_10]: It's coming from a French gaming site, NoFrag, saying they have a reliable source.

1460
01:52:12,014 --> 01:52:13,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Take with that what you need.

1461
01:52:13,215 --> 01:52:13,876
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, everybody does.

1462
01:52:14,536 --> 01:52:19,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Blizzard's next game, you know, after Diablo and after StarCraft, will be a first-person MMO.

1463
01:52:20,722 --> 01:52:22,744
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, Blizzard apparently has been working on a new IP.

1464
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:29,530
[SPEAKER_10]: We kind of know that based off the fact that they've had some job postings and so forth in the past, and that it's an MMO based on, again, the job postings.

1465
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:33,553
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, maybe there is some credibility to this.

1466
01:52:33,633 --> 01:52:35,275
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be interesting if it is a first person.

1467
01:52:35,635 --> 01:52:40,359
[SPEAKER_10]: They are saying the game will take place in a futuristic world and players have two lives.

1468
01:52:40,759 --> 01:52:49,527
[SPEAKER_10]: The first is kind of a Sims Online type of hub and then the second life is where you do fighting and other first person-y type stuff.

1469
01:52:49,827 --> 01:52:51,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently it's weird and metaphysical.

1470
01:52:52,634 --> 01:52:54,195
[SPEAKER_10]: So that could be interesting, a new IP.

1471
01:52:54,475 --> 01:52:56,797
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad they're trying to branch out and do something new, it's kind of risky.

1472
01:52:57,237 --> 01:53:03,101
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know, I was just talking about this with some people last night, is that, you know, World of Warcraft is dominating as it is.

1473
01:53:03,501 --> 01:53:12,387
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, Blizzard has to be thinking about their next steps in the MMO universe, because if they want a game to come out when WoW gets old, they need to be working on it already.

1474
01:53:12,927 --> 01:53:15,269
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, because WoW's gonna age out in...

1475
01:53:15,769 --> 01:53:18,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe five years, maybe less, I don't know.

1476
01:53:18,950 --> 01:53:20,751
[SPEAKER_10]: And they need to be thinking about the successor to that.

1477
01:53:21,551 --> 01:53:23,351
[SPEAKER_10]: But of course, this doesn't sound like World of Warcraft 2.

1478
01:53:23,391 --> 01:53:25,072
[SPEAKER_10]: This sounds like something else completely new.

1479
01:53:25,452 --> 01:53:26,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Could be interesting.

1480
01:53:26,692 --> 01:53:28,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Could be targeting a different audience altogether.

1481
01:53:28,553 --> 01:53:28,893
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1482
01:53:30,613 --> 01:53:35,455
[SPEAKER_10]: I can tell you the top secret game I played this week was also two very different types of modes in it.

1483
01:53:35,915 --> 01:53:37,716
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe that's the direction of MMOs.

1484
01:53:37,756 --> 01:53:38,096
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1485
01:53:38,656 --> 01:53:38,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

1486
01:53:38,936 --> 01:53:39,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

1487
01:53:40,083 --> 01:53:43,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in other news, it's actually kind of sad.

1488
01:53:44,305 --> 01:53:48,848
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a game that is no longer going to be shipped, no longer going to be published.

1489
01:53:48,868 --> 01:53:54,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo has put the clothes on it, even though it's only been out for four months.

1490
01:53:55,451 --> 01:53:58,573
[SPEAKER_05]: The Metroid Prime Collector's Edition is gone.

1491
01:53:59,293 --> 01:54:00,914
[SPEAKER_05]: The only way you're going to get it is used.

1492
01:54:01,874 --> 01:54:03,495
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been gone for a while, actually.

1493
01:54:03,655 --> 01:54:04,876
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's officially gone.

1494
01:54:05,316 --> 01:54:05,616
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

1495
01:54:05,636 --> 01:54:07,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, somebody finally, I guess, contacted Nintendo this week.

1496
01:54:08,017 --> 01:54:08,918
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you know, Loki?

1497
01:54:09,488 --> 01:54:10,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's been moratorium for a while.

1498
01:54:11,708 --> 01:54:14,269
[SPEAKER_09]: I just figured they stopped making it.

1499
01:54:14,309 --> 01:54:16,329
[SPEAKER_09]: They do that sometimes with some of their older games.

1500
01:54:16,730 --> 01:54:18,070
[SPEAKER_10]: So that game was not long at all.

1501
01:54:18,170 --> 01:54:19,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's weird.

1502
01:54:19,430 --> 01:54:23,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but it's just a re-release of Prime 3 and the other two games.

1503
01:54:24,251 --> 01:54:29,232
[SPEAKER_10]: I get that, but at the same time, what they did to Prime 1 and 2 was new.

1504
01:54:29,632 --> 01:54:30,892
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole widescreen and Wii controls.

1505
01:54:30,912 --> 01:54:32,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now they can re-release them separately, maybe.

1506
01:54:32,693 --> 01:54:33,133
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1507
01:54:34,396 --> 01:54:35,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Give them an excuse.

1508
01:54:35,277 --> 01:54:36,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, look, we're putting out new games.

1509
01:54:37,559 --> 01:54:43,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe Nintendo is finally being punished for just rehashing their GameCube shit and releasing it with this new play control.

1510
01:54:43,443 --> 01:54:46,986
[SPEAKER_10]: They've stopped doing the new play control stuff.

1511
01:54:47,006 --> 01:54:48,867
[SPEAKER_09]: At least I haven't seen any coming out.

1512
01:54:48,967 --> 01:54:50,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know how some of those other ones sold?

1513
01:54:52,290 --> 01:54:54,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Prime 3 did okay, I think.

1514
01:54:54,251 --> 01:54:57,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Or, well, the trilogy did alright for a little bit.

1515
01:54:57,874 --> 01:54:58,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

1516
01:54:59,130 --> 01:54:59,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1517
01:55:16,079 --> 01:55:21,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, TigerClaw on our chat says maybe they'll do a Greatest Hits thing for those games so you could buy the Wii versions separate.

1518
01:55:21,765 --> 01:55:28,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Even if they release those at $20 a piece, the collector's edition was a better deal to get all three of them for what, like $40 or whatever it was?

1519
01:55:28,251 --> 01:55:28,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much.

1520
01:55:29,432 --> 01:55:35,158
[SPEAKER_10]: The only reason I didn't get it is because I already owned three and I wasn't that attached to the Metroid series where I wanted to buy one and two.

1521
01:55:35,298 --> 01:55:37,540
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not high def.

1522
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:39,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't you have the GameCube versions anyways?

1523
01:55:41,012 --> 01:55:43,093
[SPEAKER_10]: No, those were my roommate's games at the time.

1524
01:55:43,253 --> 01:55:44,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Those were Extraverse games, not mine.

1525
01:55:44,974 --> 01:55:46,075
[SPEAKER_10]: He was the big fan of Metroid.

1526
01:55:46,995 --> 01:55:47,756
[SPEAKER_10]: I do have the third one, though.

1527
01:55:47,816 --> 01:55:49,237
[SPEAKER_10]: I did like Metroid Prime 3.

1528
01:55:49,297 --> 01:55:50,858
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, you know, I wasn't as into it.

1529
01:55:51,678 --> 01:55:54,279
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this other M is going to be more up my alley.

1530
01:55:54,299 --> 01:55:55,340
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the 2D thing.

1531
01:55:55,940 --> 01:55:59,864
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I was thinking that it's like you were saying, not being cost effective.

1532
01:55:59,884 --> 01:56:03,007
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people maybe already had these games, were disillusioned.

1533
01:56:03,668 --> 01:56:10,455
[SPEAKER_05]: If profit doesn't match output for cost, then it makes perfect sense for them to get rid of it.

1534
01:56:11,825 --> 01:56:12,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Some other fun stuff.

1535
01:56:12,365 --> 01:56:12,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

1536
01:56:42,657 --> 01:56:43,878
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1537
01:57:05,154 --> 01:57:06,035
[SPEAKER_09]: 4 AT&T U-verse Subscribers

1538
01:57:21,474 --> 01:57:23,697
[SPEAKER_09]: But I haven't really jumped on that yet.

1539
01:57:23,737 --> 01:57:26,721
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if they have the U-verse internet in my area.

1540
01:57:26,741 --> 01:57:27,422
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's what it is.

1541
01:57:28,062 --> 01:57:31,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, and they're going to have that coming out later this year.

1542
01:57:31,847 --> 01:57:35,652
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently any of the subscribers, I guess, to U-verse will have access to this.

1543
01:57:35,772 --> 01:57:39,076
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you also probably have to have their internet as well.

1544
01:57:41,271 --> 01:57:41,871
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of neat.

1545
01:57:41,891 --> 01:57:46,413
[SPEAKER_09]: They didn't really say a whole lot about it, but there's going to be a lot of limitations on there.

1546
01:57:46,433 --> 01:57:51,175
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not going to be able to record any of the programming on there with a DVR.

1547
01:57:51,995 --> 01:57:57,697
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not going to be able to get access to all the different stations and stuff.

1548
01:57:57,717 --> 01:58:02,899
[SPEAKER_09]: If it doesn't cost anything additional, then that wouldn't be too horrible, I guess.

1549
01:58:02,919 --> 01:58:04,200
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1550
01:58:06,621 --> 01:58:07,743
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm all for competition, you know?

1551
01:58:18,891 --> 01:58:21,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I need the F.I.O.S.

1552
01:58:21,453 --> 01:58:24,195
[SPEAKER_09]: stuff to get here because that's going to be awesome.

1553
01:58:24,696 --> 01:58:26,617
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, twice the speed of Comcast downloads.

1554
01:58:27,658 --> 01:58:28,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1555
01:58:29,179 --> 01:58:29,639
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1556
01:58:30,420 --> 01:58:36,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of kind of like an all-in-one, everything built in on the Wii, Nyko, of course, releases some third-party controllers for the Wii.

1557
01:58:36,665 --> 01:58:38,006
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you usually see them at E3.

1558
01:58:38,046 --> 01:58:40,408
[SPEAKER_10]: They do like the big inflatable Wii controls and stuff.

1559
01:58:40,428 --> 01:58:40,708
[SPEAKER_09]: They have...

1560
01:58:41,488 --> 01:58:48,492
[SPEAKER_09]: The wand that they released last time was pretty sweet with the ability to link up with their gun controller or whatever like that.

1561
01:58:48,592 --> 01:58:52,334
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be directly attached to it and stuff.

1562
01:58:52,414 --> 01:58:55,115
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little device that pushes the button on the controller.

1563
01:58:55,851 --> 01:58:59,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this year, what they're putting out is a $40 wand.

1564
01:58:59,534 --> 01:59:01,255
[SPEAKER_10]: The wand is the name of their controller.

1565
01:59:01,656 --> 01:59:06,420
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a Wiimote, basically, that includes MotionPlus inside it.

1566
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:10,983
[SPEAKER_10]: And it also does all the transport stuff that Loki's talking about, what the wand did before.

1567
01:59:11,283 --> 01:59:17,268
[SPEAKER_10]: But apparently now, you will get to have the WiimotionPlus built in, so you don't have to buy an extra adapter for it.

1568
01:59:17,809 --> 01:59:22,332
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty awesome, and for the same price as a normal remote, I mean, why wouldn't you buy that?

1569
01:59:22,412 --> 01:59:24,234
[SPEAKER_09]: And the controller doesn't look that bad.

1570
01:59:24,830 --> 01:59:26,031
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's not a bad looking thing at all.

1571
01:59:26,331 --> 01:59:28,792
[SPEAKER_10]: And it looks like, you know, kind of the same layout and everything.

1572
01:59:29,172 --> 01:59:32,434
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, unless you have to have the Nintendo made one.

1573
01:59:32,474 --> 01:59:32,935
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why.

1574
01:59:32,955 --> 01:59:34,255
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm surprised.

1575
01:59:34,275 --> 01:59:35,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Might not be a bad deal.

1576
01:59:35,176 --> 01:59:37,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I wonder if they're taking this well.

1577
01:59:37,957 --> 01:59:39,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, maybe you just want Wii Play really bad.

1578
01:59:40,139 --> 01:59:40,459
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1579
01:59:42,987 --> 01:59:43,267
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura

1580
02:00:06,355 --> 02:00:07,676
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one comes from Redertainment.

1581
02:00:08,336 --> 02:00:15,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear OLR, I was listening to the 12609 show and you talked about the Xbox Live Avatar pets and thought you might like to be made aware of something.

1582
02:00:15,978 --> 02:00:21,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Last summer Major Nelson sent out a tweet compelling people to get the word out that Final Fantasy XIII is on Xbox 360.

1583
02:00:22,720 --> 02:00:26,242
[SPEAKER_05]: I was among the people who participated in this free marketing campaign.

1584
02:00:26,802 --> 02:00:30,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Recently Microsoft sent out tokens to people who participated in the campaign and

1585
02:00:33,165 --> 02:00:43,413
[SPEAKER_05]: All this Chocobo does is show up, fly around my head, and delight my avatar.

1586
02:00:43,953 --> 02:00:46,275
[SPEAKER_05]: If I had not gotten this for free, I would not have paid for it.

1587
02:00:46,595 --> 02:00:47,856
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I am grateful to have it.

1588
02:00:48,196 --> 02:00:53,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure this means Chocobo 360 avatar pets will enhance my enjoyment of Final Fantasy XIII on PS3.

1589
02:00:55,703 --> 02:01:05,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Staycare Redertainment This message has been brought to you by The Simple Truth of DarkSakura Boobies are fun Boobies are great fun

1590
02:01:07,324 --> 02:01:13,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey OLR, the mailbag has been dry the past few months so I thought I would write.

1591
02:01:13,609 --> 02:01:22,056
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been listening to the show for a few years and had to stop listening live due to me moving to a rural area and I have shitty satellite internet.

1592
02:01:22,576 --> 02:01:24,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Sucks because I had three months of live left.

1593
02:01:24,558 --> 02:01:31,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh well, I was listening to your first episode of the new year and the whole Windows mobile integrating to Xbox Live.

1594
02:01:31,343 --> 02:01:33,485
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys didn't think much of it, but think about it.

1595
02:01:34,026 --> 02:01:36,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Most video game characters use some sort of device in-game

1596
02:01:37,268 --> 02:01:44,890
[SPEAKER_05]: your phone could replace any one of those devices from Snakes, Kodak, Metal Gear Solid coming to Xbox I guess to a P.I.P.

1597
02:01:44,930 --> 02:01:54,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Boy or whatever plus with Natal which I actually don't think will be most things they promise it to be it could be interesting

1598
02:01:55,373 --> 02:02:05,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I read in my RSS feed today that Microsoft just allowed Razer, you know, the ones who make the morbidly expensive PC peripherals, to make and sell a controller and headset.

1599
02:02:05,697 --> 02:02:06,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, what the fuck?

1600
02:02:07,798 --> 02:02:10,439
[SPEAKER_05]: They just stopped Detail from getting on their share of the market.

1601
02:02:10,940 --> 02:02:16,022
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that it's a different category of product, but it still seems like a dick move on Microsoft's part.

1602
02:02:16,662 --> 02:02:18,363
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't mind a short rant, continue.

1603
02:02:18,483 --> 02:02:19,963
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could care less, please skip to the end.

1604
02:02:20,263 --> 02:02:20,984
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that long.

1605
02:02:21,844 --> 02:02:23,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you're still reading this, so what the heck?

1606
02:02:23,645 --> 02:02:25,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of pissed about how cheap people are getting about their games.

1607
02:02:26,506 --> 02:02:29,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so much the development aspect of it, but the materials they actually give you.

1608
02:02:30,327 --> 02:02:32,228
[SPEAKER_05]: First, the cases started getting super cheap.

1609
02:02:32,508 --> 02:02:33,648
[SPEAKER_05]: See this Blu-ray case?

1610
02:02:33,708 --> 02:02:37,069
[SPEAKER_05]: The same style is also coming out to Xbox 360 boxes very soon.

1611
02:02:37,630 --> 02:02:38,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me pull it up.

1612
02:02:38,890 --> 02:02:39,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

1613
02:02:39,870 --> 02:02:40,290
[SPEAKER_05]: You see these?

1614
02:02:41,231 --> 02:02:43,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, I heard about that, that the boxes are going to change.

1615
02:02:43,732 --> 02:02:43,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1616
02:02:44,232 --> 02:02:47,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually going to link this in chat real quick while I'm thinking about it.

1617
02:02:49,954 --> 02:02:50,454
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um...

1618
02:02:52,421 --> 02:02:53,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Going back to the email.

1619
02:02:55,385 --> 02:03:00,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Another thing that follows this trend is releasing bonus content is download content.

1620
02:03:00,070 --> 02:03:06,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is the digital age and all, but it's not really fair to people like me who can't get online.

1621
02:03:06,998 --> 02:03:12,245
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got Gears 2 GOTY Edition and the included, quote,

1622
02:03:12,945 --> 02:03:21,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Multiplayer Maps, which I could care less about, and the extra campaign chapter, which is the reason I waited for the GOTY edition, were just a code for me to download on live.

1623
02:03:21,888 --> 02:03:24,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Even Gears 1 platform had the bonus content on a disc.

1624
02:03:25,309 --> 02:03:28,270
[SPEAKER_05]: If I have to shell out $60 for a game, at least give me what I deserve.

1625
02:03:29,150 --> 02:03:31,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, this email is getting pretty lengthy, so I'll stop it here.

1626
02:03:31,851 --> 02:03:34,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep up the great show from Tiberius Jones.

1627
02:03:36,274 --> 02:03:37,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you very much for the email.

1628
02:03:37,496 --> 02:03:38,258
[SPEAKER_10]: I recognize that name.

1629
02:03:38,378 --> 02:03:41,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody used to email us a while ago, so I guess that explains why it stopped happening.

1630
02:03:43,007 --> 02:03:43,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to hear from you again.

1631
02:03:46,460 --> 02:03:56,467
[SPEAKER_10]: I get the whole mobile integration thing, but I think a lot of the things you were referencing there with the whole see something on your phone, I don't think there's the processing power behind it.

1632
02:03:56,527 --> 02:03:58,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you remember when they came out and announced the PlayStation 3?

1633
02:03:59,169 --> 02:04:03,252
[SPEAKER_10]: They were like, it's going to interface with the PSP and you can use it as their rear view mirror in Ridge Racer.

1634
02:04:03,672 --> 02:04:04,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Ridge Racer!

1635
02:04:04,653 --> 02:04:05,253
[SPEAKER_10]: That was lame.

1636
02:04:05,393 --> 02:04:06,134
[SPEAKER_10]: That never happened.

1637
02:04:06,474 --> 02:04:07,655
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a stupid idea too.

1638
02:04:07,675 --> 02:04:18,080
[SPEAKER_10]: But I will say, they have done some neat integration where I can log on to my PlayStation 3 from my PSP and look at videos and even play some certain games across the internet.

1639
02:04:18,540 --> 02:04:24,823
[SPEAKER_10]: So some of that integration would be cool, but I just think a mobile phone doesn't have that same oomph that a dedicated gaming device does.

1640
02:04:25,423 --> 02:04:32,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of back to something similar that I did say last week, I think what you would see that's a little more practical is that the phone has some type of game that...

1641
02:04:34,071 --> 02:04:39,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Enhances the experience of a console game like, you know, Fable 2 Pub Games comes to mind.

1642
02:04:39,673 --> 02:04:43,154
[SPEAKER_10]: But not anything really, I think, that integrated.

1643
02:04:43,194 --> 02:04:44,994
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't think mobile phones have that kind of power.

1644
02:04:46,115 --> 02:04:47,015
[SPEAKER_10]: But I could be wrong.

1645
02:04:47,055 --> 02:04:48,035
[SPEAKER_05]: iPhone has fun gaming.

1646
02:04:48,956 --> 02:04:52,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but even iPhone games have their own problems.

1647
02:04:52,117 --> 02:04:54,517
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of frame rate issues in a lot of those games, you know.

1648
02:04:54,998 --> 02:04:55,958
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's just my phone.

1649
02:04:55,998 --> 02:04:56,318
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1650
02:04:57,332 --> 02:04:58,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well thanks for the emails.

1651
02:04:58,333 --> 02:05:00,254
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have more mail, you can always send us emails.

1652
02:05:00,334 --> 02:05:07,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com But in the meantime, while we wait for your emails, we need to get a little bit angsty on the show.

1653
02:05:08,158 --> 02:05:11,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Thankfully, we don't have any stupid moron to inspire our FUs this week.

1654
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:13,361
[SPEAKER_10]: But that doesn't mean we're not going to let out the angst.

1655
02:05:29,028 --> 02:05:29,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one.

1656
02:05:29,749 --> 02:05:30,429
[SPEAKER_05]: The waiting game.

1657
02:05:30,769 --> 02:05:31,150
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1658
02:05:32,371 --> 02:05:32,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki?

1659
02:05:35,173 --> 02:05:42,358
[SPEAKER_09]: My FU goes to people that play on Xbox Live and decide to drop because you suck or you're losing.

1660
02:05:42,478 --> 02:05:43,259
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, come on.

1661
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:51,345
[SPEAKER_09]: At least in Grand Theft Auto, any score that you're getting is still going to count towards your rank, even if you suck.

1662
02:05:52,166 --> 02:05:55,028
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand what the point is in dropping because you know what happens when you drop?

1663
02:05:55,128 --> 02:05:57,710
[SPEAKER_09]: I rate you down anyway, so fuck you.

1664
02:05:59,632 --> 02:06:01,634
[SPEAKER_10]: More people should use that rating system, honestly.

1665
02:06:02,974 --> 02:06:03,675
[SPEAKER_09]: I have been now.

1666
02:06:03,815 --> 02:06:06,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody that drops, and trust me, it's a lot.

1667
02:06:06,096 --> 02:06:07,897
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a few per game, every time.

1668
02:06:08,358 --> 02:06:11,660
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, it's rare when we get people to actually stick in there.

1669
02:06:11,980 --> 02:06:18,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, occasionally we drop, but that's because our internet connection at work sucks, and, you know, it just randomly kicks us out.

1670
02:06:19,004 --> 02:06:21,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Not us quitting on purpose like some people do, so...

1671
02:06:21,866 --> 02:06:24,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, you probably get rated down for quitting on purpose, even though you didn't.

1672
02:06:24,748 --> 02:06:34,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, no, I am rated down 8% by people, and it's for aggressive, they said it's unsportsmanlike behavior or something like that.

1673
02:06:34,553 --> 02:06:36,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically saying that I'm being too aggressive.

1674
02:06:36,534 --> 02:06:39,635
[SPEAKER_09]: That's usually for trash talking, but I don't use a headset, so.

1675
02:06:40,336 --> 02:06:40,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Fascinating.

1676
02:06:40,856 --> 02:06:42,697
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no trash talking.

1677
02:06:42,777 --> 02:06:43,578
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just kicking their ass.

1678
02:06:43,598 --> 02:06:43,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Dicks.

1679
02:06:44,078 --> 02:06:44,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Babies.

1680
02:06:45,118 --> 02:06:45,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Stupid babies.

1681
02:06:45,399 --> 02:06:47,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, little pussies whining to their mommy.

1682
02:06:49,972 --> 02:06:52,774
[SPEAKER_10]: There should be some type of check and balance for that for people who abuse that system.

1683
02:06:53,414 --> 02:06:55,616
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really have a lot of FUs, just FU to like Chaos.

1684
02:06:58,298 --> 02:06:59,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, things are fine.

1685
02:06:59,819 --> 02:07:00,840
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have a lot to be angsty about.

1686
02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:07,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, a couple more stories for you guys and then the Skype line at 1877-GAME-OLR but there's some stories still, so Loki.

1687
02:07:10,086 --> 02:07:11,807
[SPEAKER_09]: This is kind of interesting.

1688
02:07:11,907 --> 02:07:12,287
[SPEAKER_09]: There's...

1689
02:07:13,921 --> 02:07:24,684
[SPEAKER_09]: A new patent at Microsoft, I guess, is a part of that's for muscle controllers, I guess, EMG muscle controllers.

1690
02:07:25,244 --> 02:07:37,568
[SPEAKER_09]: And what it is is basically a device that you would, I guess, put on your arm or something that would detect the impulses from your nerves going to your different muscles.

1691
02:07:38,088 --> 02:07:39,749
[SPEAKER_09]: So, for example, one of the...

1692
02:07:43,794 --> 02:07:46,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Guitar Hero using their hand.

1693
02:07:46,918 --> 02:07:57,491
[SPEAKER_09]: The movements and motions of pushing the different fret buttons are causing the different fret buttons to hit in the game.

1694
02:07:58,783 --> 02:07:59,884
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1695
02:08:23,030 --> 02:08:30,652
[SPEAKER_09]: But apparently Natalda is supposed to detect movement of at least 31 different parts of your body.

1696
02:08:32,072 --> 02:08:33,393
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's really necessary.

1697
02:08:33,473 --> 02:08:34,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe something else that they're working on.

1698
02:08:35,773 --> 02:08:36,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

1699
02:08:37,254 --> 02:08:39,294
[SPEAKER_09]: If it works, it's cheap.

1700
02:08:40,474 --> 02:08:42,295
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if Air Guitar Hero would be as fun.

1701
02:08:42,315 --> 02:08:44,175
[SPEAKER_10]: There's something about the plastic guitar that is charming.

1702
02:08:44,235 --> 02:08:46,736
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's just proof of concept stuff.

1703
02:08:46,776 --> 02:08:51,077
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think they would actually use it for something like that.

1704
02:08:51,348 --> 02:08:55,452
[SPEAKER_10]: True, because Guitar Hero is a third-party game anyway.

1705
02:08:55,492 --> 02:08:56,773
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not something that's really done by Microsoft.

1706
02:08:56,793 --> 02:08:57,633
[SPEAKER_09]: And it would feel weird.

1707
02:08:58,514 --> 02:09:02,598
[SPEAKER_09]: It would feel really weird just kind of moving your fingers.

1708
02:09:03,936 --> 02:09:04,076
[SPEAKER_10]: IPsauce

1709
02:09:30,844 --> 02:09:32,865
[SPEAKER_10]: and some of the benefits that they mention in here.

1710
02:09:33,225 --> 02:09:33,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

1711
02:09:33,745 --> 02:09:34,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Full title trials.

1712
02:09:35,006 --> 02:09:36,266
[SPEAKER_10]: First hour is free.

1713
02:09:36,746 --> 02:09:40,388
[SPEAKER_10]: So imagine if you could actually download a full game and play it for an hour for free.

1714
02:09:40,988 --> 02:09:43,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Cross game voice chat access.

1715
02:09:43,048 --> 02:09:44,689
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that's come up before.

1716
02:09:45,209 --> 02:09:47,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Member demo sharing a full game.

1717
02:09:48,070 --> 02:09:49,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Token Wagering User to User Challenges

1718
02:10:05,906 --> 02:10:07,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe like user-generated trophies.

1719
02:10:09,008 --> 02:10:11,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Early access to all store content.

1720
02:10:11,490 --> 02:10:13,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's really no different than what they do on Xbox.

1721
02:10:13,752 --> 02:10:15,493
[SPEAKER_10]: And then this is also what I think is very interesting.

1722
02:10:15,913 --> 02:10:21,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Free access to PS1 classics, PSP minis, and PS3 PSP themes.

1723
02:10:22,297 --> 02:10:26,180
[SPEAKER_10]: So imagine if you got a subscription service that suddenly lets you play all the PS1 games you wanted.

1724
02:10:27,659 --> 02:10:30,361
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if that would be something you would want to go.

1725
02:10:31,082 --> 02:10:44,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, some of the price options that they're talking about, as low as $2.99 pounds, which would be about $5 US, up to $14.99 in the pounds, which would be about $25.

1726
02:10:44,534 --> 02:10:45,635
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be a monthly fee.

1727
02:10:46,055 --> 02:10:50,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, some annual fees listed there, up between $32 American dollars to $160 US.

1728
02:10:51,380 --> 02:10:51,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Corp.

1729
02:11:10,363 --> 02:11:14,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of these features they're talking about, especially the token wagering, I want to know more about what that's all about.

1730
02:11:14,829 --> 02:11:21,538
[SPEAKER_10]: And the whole subscription-based PS1 classics, it would be nice if you'd do some PS2 in there as well, being a part of this.

1731
02:11:22,399 --> 02:11:25,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, do you think some of this might be worth paying for, or are you just saying, forget it?

1732
02:11:25,864 --> 02:11:27,126
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not paying for any of this crap.

1733
02:11:27,446 --> 02:11:30,767
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't play the PlayStation Network enough as it is.

1734
02:11:31,187 --> 02:11:32,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Or play on the PlayStation Network.

1735
02:11:32,688 --> 02:11:35,668
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I don't think I've ever played on the PlayStation Network with someone else.

1736
02:11:35,808 --> 02:11:37,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe in LittleBigPlanet once.

1737
02:11:37,769 --> 02:11:39,749
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm not paying for any of this.

1738
02:11:40,150 --> 02:11:40,570
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1739
02:11:41,250 --> 02:11:42,970
[SPEAKER_09]: It does not seem like anything I'm interested in.

1740
02:11:43,050 --> 02:11:43,971
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't care how much it is.

1741
02:11:44,111 --> 02:11:44,751
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not paying for it.

1742
02:11:45,291 --> 02:11:51,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Game Guru says, again, if PlayStation Network goes subscription-based, there will likely be no reason for gamers to choose it over Xbox Live.

1743
02:11:52,893 --> 02:11:53,233
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1744
02:11:53,273 --> 02:11:57,634
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you might be jumping the gun a little bit because I'm not sure... They're not talking about taking anything away.

1745
02:11:58,534 --> 02:12:02,395
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't think they're talking about that now you're going to have to pay to play games online.

1746
02:12:02,415 --> 02:12:06,396
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think you could... I don't know if that would be possible because of the games that are already out there.

1747
02:12:06,796 --> 02:12:09,476
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think you could tell those games to suddenly not play online.

1748
02:12:09,516 --> 02:12:09,857
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1749
02:12:10,937 --> 02:12:11,217
[SPEAKER_10]: But...

1750
02:12:12,337 --> 02:12:13,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they're talking about trying to enhance it.

1751
02:12:14,058 --> 02:12:15,760
[SPEAKER_10]: And this could all just tie into Core.

1752
02:12:16,840 --> 02:12:17,661
[SPEAKER_10]: A Core membership.

1753
02:12:18,121 --> 02:12:18,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

1754
02:12:19,342 --> 02:12:24,566
[SPEAKER_10]: And Nat Elias, I hope I said that right, says, as long as there's a free alternative, I'm cool with it.

1755
02:12:25,146 --> 02:12:28,148
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, the survey didn't say anything about taking anything away.

1756
02:12:28,208 --> 02:12:30,810
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't think PlayStation Network, as you know it today, will change.

1757
02:12:31,350 --> 02:12:34,833
[SPEAKER_10]: But maybe they'll just try to get more money out of you by throwing extra stuff your way.

1758
02:12:34,853 --> 02:12:35,733
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't care.

1759
02:12:35,833 --> 02:12:36,514
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just not...

1760
02:12:37,657 --> 02:12:38,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1761
02:13:06,198 --> 02:13:08,899
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we are going to open up the Skype line.

1762
02:13:08,919 --> 02:13:14,161
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR is where you can send your phone calls or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, all one word.

1763
02:13:14,742 --> 02:13:20,964
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've never called the show before, please dial ECHO-123 first before you give us a call.

1764
02:13:20,984 --> 02:13:21,545
[SPEAKER_10]: That's ECHO-123.

1765
02:13:21,845 --> 02:13:26,447
[SPEAKER_10]: And then that way you can make sure your connection is working right.

1766
02:13:26,487 --> 02:13:27,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to the phones.

1767
02:13:27,627 --> 02:13:28,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1768
02:13:28,648 --> 02:13:29,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1769
02:13:32,069 --> 02:13:32,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, GS68.

1770
02:13:32,569 --> 02:13:32,950
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, GS68.

1771
02:13:32,970 --> 02:13:33,610
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1772
02:13:34,689 --> 02:13:36,929
[SPEAKER_00]: I got an FC Mobile 2 this weekend.

1773
02:13:36,949 --> 02:13:37,950
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided to give it a try.

1774
02:13:40,110 --> 02:13:43,831
[SPEAKER_00]: My thoughts on it went down the more I played it, to be honest.

1775
02:13:44,271 --> 02:13:44,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

1776
02:13:46,311 --> 02:13:48,031
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, for one, the system's pretty thick.

1777
02:13:48,071 --> 02:13:53,953
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'll kind of excuse that since it needs the thickness to accommodate NES cartridges.

1778
02:13:55,673 --> 02:14:00,554
[SPEAKER_00]: But, like, after playing for about five minutes, my hands started to get sore.

1779
02:14:01,714 --> 02:14:01,854
[SPEAKER_00]: Like,

1780
02:14:02,438 --> 02:14:06,761
[SPEAKER_00]: I can feel the soreness lingering like hours after I played it.

1781
02:14:07,881 --> 02:14:11,083
[SPEAKER_10]: So is it just not, I don't know, ergonomically well made or what's the deal?

1782
02:14:12,224 --> 02:14:15,066
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably just not ergonomically well made with it being very thick.

1783
02:14:15,746 --> 02:14:16,186
[SPEAKER_10]: I see.

1784
02:14:17,067 --> 02:14:20,369
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the D-pad is like not too great either.

1785
02:14:20,569 --> 02:14:24,692
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, for one, it's PSP-style D-pad and I hate those kind of D-pads.

1786
02:14:25,232 --> 02:14:29,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the D-pad pieces wouldn't have the diagonally so this can

1787
02:14:30,802 --> 02:14:35,465
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's for me, I find more action type of games like Zanac and Legend of Zelda.

1788
02:14:35,985 --> 02:14:42,810
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the plus side, that means I can do some weird glitches like pressing left and right at the same time in Zelda 2, causing Link to slide around all over the place.

1789
02:14:43,370 --> 02:14:43,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Fun.

1790
02:14:45,512 --> 02:14:53,677
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, it comes with wireless controllers, and I tried those, and those are more comfortable to hold, but I found the D-pads are pretty crappy too.

1791
02:14:54,178 --> 02:14:54,598
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, they go to

1792
02:14:55,445 --> 02:15:01,987
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of having what I call PSP D-pad syndrome, they now have 360 D-pad syndrome where they have the tendency to press the wrong direction.

1793
02:15:02,127 --> 02:15:02,388
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1794
02:15:02,428 --> 02:15:04,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe the quality varies from unit to unit.

1795
02:15:04,748 --> 02:15:05,109
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1796
02:15:23,516 --> 02:15:26,697
[SPEAKER_10]: I also have really fat thumbs that could play into it.

1797
02:15:26,737 --> 02:15:27,137
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1798
02:15:28,897 --> 02:15:29,337
[SPEAKER_10]: No idea.

1799
02:15:29,657 --> 02:15:30,877
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of games are you playing?

1800
02:15:30,917 --> 02:15:31,897
[SPEAKER_10]: The classic stuff.

1801
02:15:31,937 --> 02:15:34,618
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you said Zelda, but what other classics are you enjoying?

1802
02:15:35,698 --> 02:15:38,739
[SPEAKER_00]: I was also playing Zanac, which is a shoot-em-up by the St.

1803
02:15:38,759 --> 02:15:40,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill behind the Guardian Legend.

1804
02:15:41,499 --> 02:15:41,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

1805
02:15:41,899 --> 02:15:43,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Guardian Legend is a must.

1806
02:15:45,740 --> 02:15:47,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else in your gaming week you want to share with us?

1807
02:15:48,160 --> 02:15:51,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I got around to playing Castle of Unity Adventure Rebirth.

1808
02:15:51,961 --> 02:15:52,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

1809
02:15:52,549 --> 02:15:54,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I've played that a little bit on Wii as well.

1810
02:15:54,511 --> 02:15:55,051
[SPEAKER_10]: What'd you think?

1811
02:15:57,453 --> 02:15:58,294
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it so far.

1812
02:15:58,794 --> 02:16:03,838
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's about time we finally got a new classic-vania game, as some of the fanbase like to call it.

1813
02:16:04,418 --> 02:16:07,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it feels very much like a classic Castlevania game.

1814
02:16:07,741 --> 02:16:11,284
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like a very Castlevania 3-esque game, which makes sense.

1815
02:16:11,344 --> 02:16:12,685
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a remake of the Game Boy games.

1816
02:16:12,785 --> 02:16:15,027
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, yeah, I kind of felt the same way.

1817
02:16:17,248 --> 02:16:21,712
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I like is that you can choose between normal jumping and classic jumping.

1818
02:16:22,478 --> 02:16:30,485
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I like classic jumping better because when I play normal, like, jumping physics are kind of weird, especially for a classic Vayne game.

1819
02:16:30,585 --> 02:16:31,766
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it tends to throw me off.

1820
02:16:31,806 --> 02:16:45,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'll try to, like, I'll jump and I'll press the D by the other way and hit the whip button so I can, that way, I can whip in the opposite direction I'm jumping by then moving backward instead, which kind of throws me off and causes me to do stuff I didn't intend to do.

1821
02:16:47,253 --> 02:16:48,314
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still challenging though.

1822
02:16:48,354 --> 02:16:49,915
[SPEAKER_10]: Castlevania is still a very challenging game.

1823
02:16:49,955 --> 02:16:51,776
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, a lot of folks might have missed that that came out.

1824
02:16:51,796 --> 02:16:58,841
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been a lot of those rebirth type of games that came out between Contra, I think, Gradius, and now this Castlevania.

1825
02:16:59,342 --> 02:17:04,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and I've been noticing that some people have been complaining about the lack of a save feature or suspend feature.

1826
02:17:05,406 --> 02:17:06,547
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a stage select.

1827
02:17:07,227 --> 02:17:12,371
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the title menu, select Game Start and hold right for a few seconds, it'll go to stage select.

1828
02:17:13,420 --> 02:17:14,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, nice.

1829
02:17:14,581 --> 02:17:15,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Little pro tip.

1830
02:17:15,601 --> 02:17:17,802
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like the type of thing I would have read in Nintendo Power.

1831
02:17:18,523 --> 02:17:25,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, GS68, have fun with your FC Mobile and maybe hopefully you'll get a little more comfortable and good luck with Castlevania.

1832
02:17:26,827 --> 02:17:27,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, take care, buddy.

1833
02:17:27,948 --> 02:17:28,228
[SPEAKER_10]: You too.

1834
02:17:28,949 --> 02:17:30,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye-bye.

1835
02:17:30,389 --> 02:17:34,572
[SPEAKER_10]: 877-GAME-OLR is the number to call or use name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1836
02:17:36,513 --> 02:17:37,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to the phones.

1837
02:17:38,113 --> 02:17:38,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1838
02:17:38,994 --> 02:17:39,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1839
02:17:40,235 --> 02:17:40,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, what's up?

1840
02:17:41,035 --> 02:17:41,575
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Ranma.

1841
02:17:41,795 --> 02:17:42,536
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up, Ranma?

1842
02:17:43,885 --> 02:17:50,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Call to give a nice little game review Poppin' music for the Wii

1843
02:17:59,346 --> 02:18:17,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because you have to understand, I'm the average gamer and I've come to determine that when it comes to a lot of these B-Money games, when people kind of shit on said B-Money game that comes to the US, 9 out of 10, they're just mad because the Japanese music that they loved in the arcade or import versions out on the US release.

1844
02:18:18,587 --> 02:18:19,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I gotcha.

1845
02:18:19,728 --> 02:18:29,434
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I thought some of the early DDR releases were kind of crap, but I think one of the best DDR releases they ever did was one of the American ones, Ultramix 2.

1846
02:18:29,794 --> 02:18:31,575
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that was probably one of the best DDRs they ever did.

1847
02:18:32,095 --> 02:18:35,017
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't think Beatmania for the US was terrible.

1848
02:18:35,137 --> 02:18:36,718
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they tried to do some cool things with it.

1849
02:18:36,758 --> 02:18:38,099
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a bummer they didn't get to do a sequel.

1850
02:18:39,432 --> 02:18:41,454
[SPEAKER_08]: I enjoyed Beatmania for PS.

1851
02:18:41,554 --> 02:18:43,336
[SPEAKER_08]: I really enjoyed that, so you know.

1852
02:18:43,596 --> 02:18:50,223
[SPEAKER_10]: But now poppin' music I was a little apprehensive about because A, it's the Wii, and B, Beat'n Groovy was so fucking terrible.

1853
02:18:50,623 --> 02:18:53,646
[SPEAKER_10]: But how does poppin' music make it better?

1854
02:18:54,748 --> 02:18:58,071
[SPEAKER_08]: First things first, we never mention Beat'n Groovy again.

1855
02:18:58,191 --> 02:19:00,033
[SPEAKER_08]: It's on the list of band names.

1856
02:19:00,694 --> 02:19:01,415
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize.

1857
02:19:02,062 --> 02:19:03,663
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1858
02:19:21,929 --> 02:19:26,612
[SPEAKER_08]: If you shake the controllers to your side, that's hitting the outer green buttons.

1859
02:19:27,392 --> 02:19:34,257
[SPEAKER_08]: If you shake on like a 45 degree angle or straight ahead, you hit the middle blue buttons.

1860
02:19:34,597 --> 02:19:42,422
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you move the Wiimote or the Chuck with one, you know, to your left or to your right, you hit the center red button.

1861
02:19:42,862 --> 02:19:47,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, if you hit them both together across like an X, you can also hit it at the red button as well.

1862
02:19:48,015 --> 02:19:48,816
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds terrible.

1863
02:19:49,316 --> 02:19:49,757
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1864
02:19:49,917 --> 02:19:51,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, how does it play?

1865
02:19:51,298 --> 02:19:53,360
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it might sound bad, but does it play well?

1866
02:19:54,061 --> 02:19:57,524
[SPEAKER_08]: To me, it's kind of like a cross between playing Power of Power and Somebody Amigo.

1867
02:19:58,621 --> 02:19:59,481
[SPEAKER_10]: I could see the Samba.

1868
02:19:59,682 --> 02:20:00,242
[SPEAKER_10]: I could see that.

1869
02:20:01,042 --> 02:20:01,863
[SPEAKER_10]: How's the song list?

1870
02:20:01,923 --> 02:20:04,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it very Japanese-centric, or did they Americanize it?

1871
02:20:04,364 --> 02:20:04,844
[SPEAKER_10]: What did they do?

1872
02:20:05,925 --> 02:20:11,187
[SPEAKER_08]: They Americanized it, but there's some downloadable content which does have Japanese songs on it.

1873
02:20:12,128 --> 02:20:19,011
[SPEAKER_08]: One of my favorite songs is Miracle Moon, so I'm really excited about getting a chance to download that song, actually.

1874
02:20:20,211 --> 02:20:21,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, they have download content?

1875
02:20:22,272 --> 02:20:22,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wow.

1876
02:20:22,713 --> 02:20:22,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1877
02:20:24,444 --> 02:20:27,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there a lot of songs that longtime Bomani fans will recognize?

1878
02:20:27,445 --> 02:20:28,566
[SPEAKER_10]: I know Miracle Moon, obviously.

1879
02:20:28,906 --> 02:20:29,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Other stuff like that?

1880
02:20:30,866 --> 02:20:35,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember a couple of the other ones, but there's some familiar ones in there.

1881
02:20:35,468 --> 02:20:41,610
[SPEAKER_08]: I did write on my Twitter about some of the bands' names I saw when I was browsing through the downloadable content.

1882
02:20:42,630 --> 02:20:43,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a lot of downloadable content?

1883
02:20:46,632 --> 02:20:49,713
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe there's like 40 downloadable... No.

1884
02:20:50,473 --> 02:20:50,673
[SPEAKER_08]: There's...

1885
02:20:52,097 --> 02:20:54,058
[SPEAKER_08]: 20 downloadable songs.

1886
02:20:54,618 --> 02:20:57,059
[SPEAKER_08]: There's 10 different topics.

1887
02:20:57,300 --> 02:20:59,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Each topic has two songs.

1888
02:20:59,561 --> 02:21:03,903
[SPEAKER_08]: And pretty much the majority of them are Japanese songs from pop and music games.

1889
02:21:04,123 --> 02:21:06,424
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think Beatmania, but don't hold me to that.

1890
02:21:06,704 --> 02:21:09,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thanks for the reminder that the game was even out because I forgot.

1891
02:21:09,845 --> 02:21:13,167
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess maybe it's not as bad as a lot of people are saying it's going to be, huh?

1892
02:21:14,068 --> 02:21:15,349
[SPEAKER_08]: You gotta thank Twitter for that.

1893
02:21:15,369 --> 02:21:20,753
[SPEAKER_08]: If it was for one of my friends who was at Best Buy matching it, I wouldn't have known to go over to go purchase it.

1894
02:21:21,233 --> 02:21:21,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

1895
02:21:22,634 --> 02:21:24,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else in your gaming week you want to talk about?

1896
02:21:26,877 --> 02:21:28,038
[SPEAKER_08]: That pretty much is it.

1897
02:21:28,098 --> 02:21:32,201
[SPEAKER_08]: I will be playing Lost Odyssey later tonight before I go to bed.

1898
02:21:33,802 --> 02:21:34,503
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll say this much.

1899
02:21:34,543 --> 02:21:35,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Pop music was $29.

1900
02:21:35,984 --> 02:21:38,646
[SPEAKER_08]: I personally thought it was a good game to purchase.

1901
02:21:38,886 --> 02:21:41,228
[SPEAKER_08]: If it was more than that, I probably would not have bothered.

1902
02:21:42,418 --> 02:21:44,759
[SPEAKER_08]: and there's also a two-player and four-player mode.

1903
02:21:44,799 --> 02:21:54,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Four-player mode is pretty much you have like all nine of the buttons out and I think four-player mode has all the buttons but each person takes a Wii mode to hit the correct button.

1904
02:21:55,441 --> 02:21:55,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1905
02:21:56,502 --> 02:21:56,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1906
02:21:57,802 --> 02:21:58,082
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1907
02:21:58,482 --> 02:21:59,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, DJ Ranma, we're going to let you go.

1908
02:22:00,183 --> 02:22:04,564
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually wanted to say I was thinking about you right before you called, seriously.

1909
02:22:05,464 --> 02:22:07,005
[SPEAKER_08]: We must be on the same wavelength.

1910
02:22:07,485 --> 02:22:11,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, about last time you were here and we went to Japantown.

1911
02:22:11,966 --> 02:22:12,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1912
02:22:13,607 --> 02:22:14,508
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1913
02:22:40,069 --> 02:22:42,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we hope to see you soon, DJ Ranma.

1914
02:22:42,331 --> 02:22:44,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Until then, we'll just rely on the phone calls, okay?

1915
02:22:45,294 --> 02:22:45,734
[SPEAKER_10]: You got it.

1916
02:22:45,814 --> 02:22:46,575
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, take care, buddy.

1917
02:22:46,615 --> 02:22:48,516
[SPEAKER_10]: Have fun popping music-ing away.

1918
02:22:49,437 --> 02:22:49,818
[SPEAKER_10]: I will.

1919
02:22:49,998 --> 02:22:50,258
[SPEAKER_10]: Later.

1920
02:22:50,278 --> 02:22:52,240
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1921
02:22:52,300 --> 02:22:53,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1922
02:22:54,201 --> 02:22:56,163
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess we'll do about one more call here tonight before we go.

1923
02:22:56,744 --> 02:22:57,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1924
02:22:57,584 --> 02:22:57,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1925
02:22:59,949 --> 02:23:01,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Azako, what's on your mind, buddy?

1926
02:23:01,089 --> 02:23:02,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear you.

1927
02:23:02,050 --> 02:23:03,431
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't mind people killing time with us.

1928
02:23:03,471 --> 02:23:04,191
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

1929
02:23:04,532 --> 02:23:06,193
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about this whole 3D TV?

1930
02:23:06,233 --> 02:23:09,415
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked about it a little bit earlier in the show with Avatar and stuff.

1931
02:23:09,435 --> 02:23:09,915
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think?

1932
02:23:28,067 --> 02:23:32,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if 3D's gonna make a comeback, it better be implemented right this time.

1933
02:23:33,253 --> 02:23:35,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that red and blue stuff.

1934
02:23:35,856 --> 02:23:36,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that red and blue shit.

1935
02:23:37,357 --> 02:23:41,903
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be like 3D that you can actually see in the colors, in the actual colors.

1936
02:23:42,243 --> 02:23:44,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the technology's come a long way, to be fair.

1937
02:23:45,424 --> 02:23:49,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you have to keep in mind, not every game is meant for 3D anyways.

1938
02:23:50,329 --> 02:23:58,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Case in point, some of them like Gran Turismo 5, which they did a tech demo over the course of the expo where they had it in 3D and it added nothing.

1939
02:23:59,657 --> 02:24:01,519
[SPEAKER_02]: And absolutely nothing to the experience.

1940
02:24:02,200 --> 02:24:09,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas games such as Gears or... I think it was... I want to say it was some other games.

1941
02:24:09,266 --> 02:24:10,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of them...

1942
02:24:11,100 --> 02:24:15,562
[SPEAKER_02]: The new one coming out, Dark Void, that one had a 3D demo of CES.

1943
02:24:16,883 --> 02:24:19,424
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one pretty much made the experience a lot better.

1944
02:24:21,024 --> 02:24:23,646
[SPEAKER_02]: So the mileage may vary pretty much.

1945
02:24:25,806 --> 02:24:26,987
[SPEAKER_10]: What about Game Room?

1946
02:24:27,007 --> 02:24:27,767
[SPEAKER_10]: What did you think about that?

1947
02:24:29,488 --> 02:24:31,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the new thing for Xbox Live?

1948
02:24:31,609 --> 02:24:31,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1949
02:24:32,957 --> 02:24:34,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, I heard about that.

1950
02:24:34,558 --> 02:24:44,726
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've been detached from my 360 for quite some time, but I did hear about the, I don't know, I guess it's just Microsoft trying to emulate Home.

1951
02:24:46,072 --> 02:24:46,972
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way I see it.

1952
02:24:47,072 --> 02:24:49,433
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's kind of a combination of home and virtual console.

1953
02:24:49,453 --> 02:24:52,594
[SPEAKER_10]: I hear a lot of people comparing it to home, but I think there's also a lot of virtual console.

1954
02:24:52,614 --> 02:25:01,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the way you see it is just them rendering a virtual arcade that Sony could easily have already baked into their home app.

1955
02:25:02,037 --> 02:25:03,097
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much it.

1956
02:25:03,157 --> 02:25:11,040
[SPEAKER_02]: All they're doing is Microsoft is just dressing up and taking from what Sony's already done months, you know, already in the past.

1957
02:25:12,218 --> 02:25:39,737
[SPEAKER_02]: and another thing I want to talk about you said earlier that certain phones were designed for the social networking aspects within video games right now there's like a shift going on within mobile devices obviously the iPhone was the catalyst for it but you have platforms like Android, Windows Mobile Blackberry

1958
02:25:40,541 --> 02:25:44,286
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them are not your cheap run-of-the-mill cell phone platform.

1959
02:25:44,366 --> 02:25:45,328
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pretty robust.

1960
02:25:45,348 --> 02:25:49,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would know because I work with most of them professionally.

1961
02:25:50,595 --> 02:25:56,342
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're worlds better than the phones that I used to work in when I graduated college almost four years ago.

1962
02:25:57,136 --> 02:26:21,303
[SPEAKER_10]: I got that, but, you know, again, I look at something like the PSP, which is a dedicated game system, and they still have yet to pull off the, and I'm not talking about, like, you know, I get, like, if they build something separate on the phone that ties into the game somehow, like, again, I get the pub games example, but, like, you know, this whole, like, you are going to actually, because, you know, in the email it kind of talked about, imagine you're Solid Snake and you can whip out your phone and something happens on your phone.

1963
02:26:21,343 --> 02:26:25,584
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, I don't see that level of integration happening on phones, period.

1964
02:26:26,184 --> 02:26:28,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it can be done.

1965
02:26:28,185 --> 02:26:29,726
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it all depends on the platform.

1966
02:26:29,766 --> 02:26:31,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Case in point, Android, for example.

1967
02:26:32,027 --> 02:26:39,431
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually run multiple apps, apps that actually support push, that can run while your phone is running in the background.

1968
02:26:39,992 --> 02:26:49,877
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's say, you know, you do get an alert from, you know, from something like you described with Solid Snake, it will just pop up on your phone, vibrate, and inform you.

1969
02:26:52,378 --> 02:26:57,282
[SPEAKER_02]: The same could also be done with iPhone if they opened up the platform and had support for multiple apps.

1970
02:26:57,343 --> 02:27:01,326
[SPEAKER_02]: But Android is a good example of how you can accomplish what you just described.

1971
02:27:03,117 --> 02:27:05,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it'll be interesting to see if it takes off.

1972
02:27:05,439 --> 02:27:08,220
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't know, you know, especially with the iPhone dominating everything.

1973
02:27:08,240 --> 02:27:21,489
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if they could pull off Facebook and Twitter and all the other social networking sites on any given mobile platform, even the good ones, you know, like Android or, you know, Blackberry, then it could be done.

1974
02:27:21,549 --> 02:27:24,431
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have, it just has to be executed.

1975
02:27:24,891 --> 02:27:32,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but social networking is not as much bandwidth as, you know, a freaking game running video to your phone, you know?

1976
02:27:33,069 --> 02:27:33,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it can't be done.

1977
02:27:34,010 --> 02:27:37,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're underestimating the power of cell phones now.

1978
02:27:37,695 --> 02:27:38,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps.

1979
02:27:38,576 --> 02:27:45,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, you would have won the argument several years ago, but the game is different now.

1980
02:27:46,065 --> 02:27:48,508
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different mobile environment.

1981
02:27:48,568 --> 02:27:52,613
[SPEAKER_02]: When you have phones that have tens of megabytes of memory...

1982
02:27:53,632 --> 02:27:57,813
[SPEAKER_02]: to run apps and high-speed connections and bigger screens.

1983
02:27:58,053 --> 02:28:05,116
[SPEAKER_10]: I can understand that, and especially Japan has been ahead of the game in that market for a while, but how much have those really penetrated the entire marketplace?

1984
02:28:05,156 --> 02:28:13,098
[SPEAKER_02]: The G1 is pretty much a good baseline Android phone that's slated to get 2.0, so it still has some fighting in it.

1985
02:28:13,539 --> 02:28:17,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus any other Android phone, and obviously the iPhone, the BlackBerry,

1986
02:28:19,891 --> 02:28:22,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm naming these off my hand right now.

1987
02:28:23,033 --> 02:28:25,114
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot that could be done.

1988
02:28:25,194 --> 02:28:29,817
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a matter of the execution and the design.

1989
02:28:30,438 --> 02:28:35,441
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, it's not impossible and it shouldn't be ruled out.

1990
02:28:35,501 --> 02:28:43,446
[SPEAKER_02]: It just has to be meticulously planned to work well within the confines of how it ought to function.

1991
02:28:43,946 --> 02:28:45,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I will see you there.

1992
02:28:46,007 --> 02:28:47,688
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate the perspective.

1993
02:28:47,788 --> 02:28:51,770
[SPEAKER_10]: I won't say it's impossible, but I'll still say probably not anytime soon.

1994
02:28:53,972 --> 02:28:55,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime soon is very close right now.

1995
02:28:56,053 --> 02:28:59,675
[SPEAKER_02]: When Android comes very close to second place and

1996
02:29:00,195 --> 02:29:07,577
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, behind the iPhone you'll have the install base and the wherewithal to execute it.

1997
02:29:07,797 --> 02:29:09,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Even with BlackBerrys out there.

1998
02:29:10,537 --> 02:29:14,658
[SPEAKER_02]: By the end of this year I should have won the argument.

1999
02:29:15,998 --> 02:29:16,699
[SPEAKER_10]: We shall see.

2000
02:29:17,039 --> 02:29:18,299
[SPEAKER_10]: And if I'm wrong, then I'm wrong.

2001
02:29:18,379 --> 02:29:19,879
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds like it would be a good thing for gaming.

2002
02:29:20,199 --> 02:29:22,100
[SPEAKER_05]: If Rob's wrong, he has to wear the Tingle costume.

2003
02:29:22,160 --> 02:29:22,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck that shit.

2004
02:29:22,980 --> 02:29:23,380
[SPEAKER_10]: No way.

2005
02:29:24,120 --> 02:29:27,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, right now you're probably going to get a refresh anyways with a new model.

2006
02:29:28,681 --> 02:29:32,984
[SPEAKER_02]: So they may end up selling you, you know, a Blackberry or an Android phone or something like that.

2007
02:29:33,644 --> 02:29:34,825
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are very powerful.

2008
02:29:34,865 --> 02:29:37,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are much powerful than your standard run of the mill.

2009
02:29:37,907 --> 02:29:38,127
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2010
02:29:38,647 --> 02:29:38,947
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2011
02:29:39,007 --> 02:29:41,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Zach, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up.

2012
02:29:41,249 --> 02:29:42,429
[SPEAKER_10]: But thanks so much for the call, okay?

2013
02:29:42,449 --> 02:29:43,330
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate the other perspective.

2014
02:29:43,350 --> 02:29:43,530
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2015
02:29:43,610 --> 02:29:44,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good one.

2016
02:29:44,511 --> 02:29:44,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Later.

2017
02:29:44,811 --> 02:29:45,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

2018
02:29:46,092 --> 02:29:46,372
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2019
02:29:46,752 --> 02:29:47,993
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2020
02:29:48,033 --> 02:29:49,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to those that didn't get through.

2021
02:29:49,334 --> 02:29:50,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Something else occurred to me.

2022
02:29:50,294 --> 02:29:50,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, what's that?

2023
02:29:50,874 --> 02:29:54,817
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there are actually regular cell phones that would be powerful enough to do stuff like that in Japan.

2024
02:29:55,694 --> 02:29:58,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but, you know, not anything I'm going to see.

2025
02:29:58,357 --> 02:30:05,428
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's been a tendency now for companies to compete with the smartphones by implementing some of the stuff they've got out in the K-Ti already, so...

2026
02:30:06,149 --> 02:30:15,074
[SPEAKER_10]: I get what he's saying, that it's possible, but unfortunately, I guess he seems to think it's going to happen a lot sooner than I'm giving it credit for.

2027
02:30:15,154 --> 02:30:25,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe the technology's moving a little faster than I'm thinking, but I kind of go, you know, you have to have a lot of people who are going to use it in order to make it effective to build, if that makes sense.

2028
02:30:25,819 --> 02:30:27,500
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my little concern.

2029
02:30:27,620 --> 02:30:29,301
[SPEAKER_10]: But I get what Zaku's saying.

2030
02:30:29,381 --> 02:30:35,584
[SPEAKER_10]: He's saying probably I'm not giving the technical side of it enough appreciation, and maybe the way it came off I wasn't, so that's fair enough.

2031
02:30:36,274 --> 02:30:36,534
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2032
02:30:37,094 --> 02:30:40,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, that's going to do it for tonight's show once we do last-minute stories.

2033
02:30:40,896 --> 02:30:41,616
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to skip those.

2034
02:30:42,116 --> 02:30:44,757
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, Loki, any of you guys have last-minute stories tonight?

2035
02:30:45,257 --> 02:30:46,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Or do we cover it all?

2036
02:30:47,798 --> 02:30:50,099
[SPEAKER_09]: The Mega Man fan movie is going to be coming out soon.

2037
02:30:50,660 --> 02:30:54,041
[SPEAKER_09]: This was shown off in a trailer back in November 2008.

2038
02:30:55,842 --> 02:31:01,244
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently it will be coming out, available on the Internet soon enough.

2039
02:31:03,797 --> 02:31:05,657
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to see when exactly it's going to be.

2040
02:31:05,977 --> 02:31:07,598
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be 109 minutes long.

2041
02:31:07,618 --> 02:31:21,741
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess it will be available probably on the website for the film, which is megaman.ninjin.com.

2042
02:31:21,841 --> 02:31:23,301
[SPEAKER_09]: That's N-I-N-G-I-N.

2043
02:31:24,321 --> 02:31:28,782
[SPEAKER_09]: And they actually have some stuff from that.

2044
02:31:29,462 --> 02:31:31,463
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it was being shown at MAGFest 2010.

2045
02:31:34,191 --> 02:31:37,438
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a rough cut that they showed, and that happened actually today.

2046
02:31:38,740 --> 02:31:41,726
[SPEAKER_09]: So, soon enough, I guess.

2047
02:31:41,947 --> 02:31:43,089
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks kind of interesting.

2048
02:31:43,109 --> 02:31:45,754
[SPEAKER_09]: The guy that had been playing Wily, though, kind of looks...

2049
02:31:47,796 --> 02:31:48,676
[SPEAKER_09]: I see your point Nothing will happen

2050
02:32:15,950 --> 02:32:18,071
[SPEAKER_09]: is that it?

2051
02:32:18,651 --> 02:32:45,322
[SPEAKER_09]: this is kind of interesting there was a comment I guess Gamasutra ran a feature on third party publisher reactions to the abysmal sales of uninteresting games or I guess party games one of the comments was one thing for sure the focus has changed stores like Target and Best Buy have reportedly told game publishers not to even bother approaching them with collections of mini games

2052
02:32:45,862 --> 02:33:11,789
[SPEAKER_09]: which they will no longer pick up so good for them I think that's a great thing and you know honestly I've been seeing a lot more of that just from my customers and honestly I kind of figured that anyways and I steer them away from that crap so only good stuff but sadly enough though even the good stuff I recommend you know like even like the No More Heroes and that kind of thing and Mad World just doesn't do well

2053
02:33:12,708 --> 02:33:13,168
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a bummer.

2054
02:33:13,188 --> 02:33:16,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Because stupid parents out there want to buy that fucking minigame crap.

2055
02:33:17,969 --> 02:33:20,170
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what's wrong with gaming nowadays.

2056
02:33:20,390 --> 02:33:20,750
[SPEAKER_09]: The Wii.

2057
02:33:20,890 --> 02:33:22,630
[SPEAKER_09]: The Wii is everything that is wrong with gaming.

2058
02:33:22,650 --> 02:33:23,671
[SPEAKER_09]: The Wii ruined everything.

2059
02:33:24,031 --> 02:33:24,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

2060
02:33:25,391 --> 02:33:29,672
[SPEAKER_10]: But they still have... You know, there's certain games that come out on the Wii that you have to have.

2061
02:33:29,732 --> 02:33:33,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I feel justified owning a Wii because there is some real good shit that comes out for it.

2062
02:33:33,453 --> 02:33:34,453
[SPEAKER_10]: A new Super Mario Bros.

2063
02:33:34,513 --> 02:33:35,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Wii was fantastic.

2064
02:33:38,715 --> 02:33:39,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Crazy stuff.

2065
02:33:39,415 --> 02:33:41,476
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, one of our chatters is cluing us in on a last minute story.

2066
02:33:41,496 --> 02:33:43,116
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually, this is something I do remember reading.

2067
02:33:43,156 --> 02:33:44,936
[SPEAKER_10]: I just neglected to put it on the show world tonight.

2068
02:33:45,237 --> 02:33:50,698
[SPEAKER_10]: But Jay Dizzle in our chat room at chat.orange.com is saying, Crayon Physics is on sale till the 15th.

2069
02:33:50,998 --> 02:33:52,118
[SPEAKER_10]: You can pay as much as you want.

2070
02:33:52,238 --> 02:33:54,799
[SPEAKER_10]: It's doing that whole thing where you can pay what you feel the game is worth.

2071
02:33:55,199 --> 02:33:56,859
[SPEAKER_10]: You got some people paying a penny for it.

2072
02:33:57,559 --> 02:34:03,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they're hoping some people will pay $150, you know, like happened, I think, when World of Goo did that.

2073
02:34:03,501 --> 02:34:04,101
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know...

2074
02:34:04,761 --> 02:34:07,986
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say maybe like 5, 10 bucks, whatever you believe is appropriate.

2075
02:34:08,046 --> 02:34:09,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Or maybe I'll probably go buy it and pay $6.66.

2076
02:34:09,848 --> 02:34:10,449
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that would be fun.

2077
02:34:10,469 --> 02:34:10,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Or $6.90.

2078
02:34:16,454 --> 02:34:19,135
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what's your final thought tonight?

2079
02:34:19,155 --> 02:34:24,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I finally learned to knit a scarf without messing up my rows Congrats See, doesn't it look nice?

2080
02:34:46,683 --> 02:35:12,935
[SPEAKER_09]: my final thought is LA tomorrow, Seattle Friday I got a busy week ahead Loki, your final thought my final thought is I wish people would stop quitting out of my games on Grand Theft Auto and you know I don't know what I gotta do I'm even nice usually when I'm like a thousand dollars ahead I'll just fuck around so that you know at least I'm not like pissing people off although there was that one time that I was trying to get a high streak I got 17 streak

2081
02:35:14,704 --> 02:35:16,945
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2082
02:35:16,965 --> 02:35:20,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and downloading our show and supporting it.

2083
02:35:20,307 --> 02:35:23,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, if you like what you hear, all we ask, tell a couple friends about the show.

2084
02:35:23,789 --> 02:35:28,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Help us spread the word because we don't have big budget dollars to advertise and all that stuff about our show.

2085
02:35:28,912 --> 02:35:30,333
[SPEAKER_10]: So we really appreciate the word of mouth.

2086
02:35:30,693 --> 02:35:31,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Really appreciate it.

2087
02:35:32,014 --> 02:35:38,398
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm also being asked to remind you guys that our buddies at Under Station Live are collecting the top 25 games of all time.

2088
02:35:38,818 --> 02:35:44,060
[SPEAKER_10]: So please, if you have a little time today, make a top 25 list of your favorite games of all time.

2089
02:35:44,340 --> 02:35:45,981
[SPEAKER_10]: No criteria, but what is your favorite?

2090
02:35:46,301 --> 02:35:54,004
[SPEAKER_10]: And email them to uslmadness, that's U-S-L-M-A-D-N-E-S-S at gmail.com and help our buddies out over at Understation Live.

2091
02:35:54,464 --> 02:35:57,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember a programming note, there is no show next week.

2092
02:35:57,726 --> 02:36:03,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Podcast listeners, you will see a new show in two weeks and for those of you that do listen live, it will be 10 a.m.

2093
02:36:03,408 --> 02:36:04,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Pacific, 1 p.m.

2094
02:36:05,069 --> 02:36:07,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Eastern, which means 6 o'clock

2095
02:36:08,510 --> 02:36:09,350
[SPEAKER_10]: London and Greenwich.

2096
02:36:09,630 --> 02:36:12,252
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you overseas folks are hopefully in for a treat.

2097
02:36:12,492 --> 02:36:14,232
[SPEAKER_10]: I want lots of accents next week.

2098
02:36:14,773 --> 02:36:15,813
[SPEAKER_05]: One more plug though.

2099
02:36:16,053 --> 02:36:16,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yes, please.

2100
02:36:18,394 --> 02:36:29,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Tara and I are doing, or Mar and Marvel and I are doing a podcast, although we may or may not have one this week, for Monday Comics Mania, which you can see at AvengersTower, all one word, dot com.

2101
02:36:30,079 --> 02:36:31,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, comics.

2102
02:36:31,459 --> 02:36:33,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you get to hear Rob's cameo.

2103
02:36:34,738 --> 02:36:35,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice.

2104
02:36:35,519 --> 02:36:38,041
[SPEAKER_10]: When do I get to come be a guest on the show?

2105
02:36:38,841 --> 02:36:39,482
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I will do?

2106
02:36:39,862 --> 02:36:42,965
[SPEAKER_10]: One week I will read a comic just so I can actually be on your show.

2107
02:36:44,225 --> 02:36:45,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Get to my house early.

2108
02:36:45,546 --> 02:36:46,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, fair enough.

2109
02:36:47,208 --> 02:36:48,449
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, that's it guys.

2110
02:36:48,469 --> 02:36:50,891
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting us.

2111
02:36:50,931 --> 02:36:51,792

[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll see you in a little while.

2118
02:37:06,866 --> 02:37:07,186
