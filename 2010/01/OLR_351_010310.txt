Orange Lounge Radio
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Roto the King
Tonight, January 3rd, 2010
What could Google be planning for gaming?
A brand new 8-bit NES game is about to be released
And what in the world is a Wiiwa?
Orange Lounge Radio
Hello everybody out there on the internet
And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
We are that show dedicated to video games
Video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
Joining over the next few hours, my name is Rob Roberts
And with me as always, say hello to the one and only
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
Always ready and alert as always, right?
Uh huh
Yeah, exactly
Also say hello to Techmaster Loki
Hello
How you doing, Loki?
Doing fine
I see you YouTubing something over there
What's going on?
I'm just looking at an auction for a bar top cavity
Because it's hilarious how much they try to charge
For these things
Like, they want $900 for this
You can get two full-size arcade games for that
These people are dumb
You know, one story that was given to us this week
That didn't make our show roll tonight though
Because I remember bringing this up on a previous show
But the big Metreon in San Francisco
They're selling all their cabinets
And I know that story made gaming blogs this week
But I think I mentioned that on the show a couple weeks ago
When I was, or maybe about a month ago
When I was there at the Metreon
They're selling a bunch of cabinets
Yeah, they also want too much for their DDR machine too
I remember that they're beating me in a three
They only wanted a few hundred dollars for
Or maybe it was, I don't remember
Maybe it was a thousand or something
But I was seriously considering it
If I wasn't a stinking adult with stinking adult responsibilities
I would have seriously considered it
But alas
Another piece of my car broke this week
And it made me realize, you know
Probably before I indulge in the video game habit
I probably ought to get a car
Probably should
Stupid responsibility
Oh well
Well, Rob, you are almost 75% to a new present
Anyhow, let's uh
Yes, that's right, because you're working on an MP3
Yeah, I've since discovered that
The real player converter will convert to MP3
Off stuff off YouTube
There's a lot of websites that do that too
I've seen that happen
This is so much easier because it just runs in the background
And it works in both Internet Explorer and Firefox
So enjoy your gift of Angela Aki covers
Sweet
Anyhow
Let's talk about our gaming weeks
And the types of stuff we've been playing
I know maybe because of the holidays
Not everyone's really been gaming
I don't know
But we'll go around and check in with everybody
Anyway, Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
Peggle-rific
I'm playing through challenge mode on Peggle right now
And I've beaten three of the five point stages
It's freaking hard
On the iPhone
And then we had a bunch of
Raiden 4 going on in the house last night
And then they were all
No, let's watch Macross
So they were watching Macross
Macross Frontier
I actually dropped by randomly yesterday
Yes
Because I wanted to show a friend the OLR studio
And we had Sonic
Yeah, you guys were watching Macross
And I was kind of like, oh, anime
That I'm not familiar with
Because I don't follow anime as closely as I think a lot of our listeners do
I don't follow it nearly as much as I used to
But we have plenty of friends that do
And Dan's like, oh, bring it over, let's see what's new
Good times
They had Hetalia, which I love
That's the one where it's different personifications of countries
So all the different countries are characters
And America is trying to solve everything through cheeseburgers
And Japan is very soft-spoken
And never gives a clear answer
Dan's still playing the hell out of Borderlands, out of curiosity?
Yeah, pretty much
But he's actually played through
Ikaruga the other night
I was going to say, when I came over the other night
They were playing some Japanese shooter game on 360
I wasn't sure if it was Triggerheart, Excellica
I only glanced at it for a second
It was Ikaruga? Okay
Yeah
Because they were actually watching playthroughs
Of other people doing tricks
So they decided they were going to do them themselves
I think they watched some guy do a perfect playthrough of Ikaruga
And decided that they wanted to do it
Alright
Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week? What did you do?
I too played Ikaruga on my arcade cabinet
Because I was working on getting Naomi's stuff
Random, okay
I was working on getting my Naomi and a Thomas Wave
And actually also my Zinc emulation running
Zinc though doesn't seem to run very well
The loader that I have for it sucks
So I have to do it by hand
But I tried playing Urguts
And that's pretty fun
Except I wish the Japanese ROM would work
Because I think the US one doesn't have Cloud in it
Yes it does
It does?
Ask with Cloud and Tifa because I've played one
Do I have to unlock it or something?
I do not remember because it's been a long time since I've played it
But I thought it was either that or time released
Or that it's like some little trick you have to do
But yeah, I've played both of them in the American cabinet
Well then I will have to mess around with that
But in the meantime I couldn't get any of the controls to work
Even though I configured them correctly
It's just being retarded
I did play a little bit of Thomas Wave
Had a little bit of Dolphin Blue
Which for those who aren't familiar
Is another game that's very similar to Metal Slug
Done by the creators of Metal Slug
And when you play the game you're like
Oh wow, this is almost like Metal Slug
Except they're riding dolphins
So that was kind of fun
And then I tried to get Marvel vs. Capcom 2 working
But I think it may be a little too much for my processor
And the arcade cabinet
Because it's only 2.2 GHz
Whereas you probably need a little bit more than that
So I actually have to overclock it since I can do that
So maybe that'll fix it
Because right now the sound's a little laggy
And it's kind of annoying
Then let's see what else did I play
Other than Ikaruga
Oh, Guilty Gear Iizuka
Which is interesting because I didn't realize
That they had a four player Guilty Gear game
So that was neat
Then other than arcade cabinet stuff
I played through the rest of the Little Big Planet
Pirates of the Caribbean level pack
And it was alright
It wasn't as cool as the Metal Gear Solid pack
But it was pretty good
Still worth the five or six bucks that you have to pay for it
But still, how can you top guns?
I mean, it's tough
So it's understandable
Then of course more Grand Theft Auto
Still no Borderlands
Thought about it, but been working on the cabinet
So I haven't had a chance to play anything
I have Borderlands
I just haven't played it
I've been sitting on it for weeks now
Months now actually
I'll eventually get around to it
I'd like to play it too
So if you don't ever crack open that copy
Oh, it's cracked open
It's ready to go
I just haven't gotten a chance to do it yet
When are you bringing Bayonetta over for me?
The damn thing's out this week, right?
This week or next?
Very soon
Hopefully, if your husband knows Jamie
He'll be bringing it home
It's pretty awesome
So yeah, definitely check that out this week
Yeah, I think that's really
I mean, last week we had some pretty epic
Grand Theft Auto games
Because of everybody being off
Funny enough though, we actually were playing against people in the UK
Because I guess it was probably evening over there in the UK when we were playing
I think they're about eight hours ahead of us
Okay, so they are about evening
It was funny though
Because we had some people playing
And we can hear them over the headsets
And they're, I'm gonna get
I'm gonna get the call in the green
That little wanker
No wanker
So I'm gonna get the green fella
I like getting cussed at in
I don't want to say other languages
But other dialects, I guess you could say
You know, getting called a poof
And you know, all those other types of words
It was pretty brutal though
I had 47 kills in 20 minutes
With a streak of 14
And people were pissed
So it was fun
In fact, actually the second player
Second place had half as many
Actually less than half as many kills as I did
So it was fun
So that's what I've been playing
All that fun stuff
Awesome
I'm just imagining all the little talk
On Grand Theft Auto
We don't talk back
Because it's hard to wear headphones and a headset
At the same time
So we just listen to it
And it's funny
Has anyone invented that?
Like a third party?
A headphone slash headset?
They have
My actual new 5.1 headset
Which by the way
And I don't know why these headsets do this
But one of the channels is already cutting out on it
Because I guess the cord is so heavy
That it's pulling it out a little bit
I'm only getting that
One speaker
Which is annoying
But I've had other headsets do the same thing
But yeah, they have Turtle Beach headsets
But they're like $100
I think the cheapest one you can get that has that built in
Is like
I don't know
Maybe
$60
But really what they need to come up with
Excuse me
Is a clip-on microphone or something like that
That you can just wear so you can talk
Because you don't really need the headset to hear people talking
Most games have a way you can listen to it
Through your actual headphones
So
That's all you really need
Is just that
Because it's just really awkward the way it is
Going to the chat room of course

SSJ100Matt says I thought Rob's British accent
Is banned from the show
I don't remember that getting an official banning
But fine it'll be my Welsh accent there
Anyhow
Going into
It's not sing-songy enough
I'll work on it
If my Japanese pronunciation got better
Maybe I should resolve this year to work on my British accent
I don't know
I'll have to Skype some of our British listeners
And say please teach me how to say cute things
And you know I'll teach you
Teach me how to speak English English
Yes please teach me how to speak English
I can't even do that on the show
If you've listened to the past two or three months of show
I don't know if it's because I have to multitask a lot
While doing the show or what
But sometimes the things that come out of my mouth
I'm like what did I say
I just totally butchered the English language
I need English lessons from an English person
That's what I need
Anyhow
You know they do have those
I want to say that it's
They actually have like British English
As you know a language learning system
Like is that something I can get the Rosetta Stone for
Yes
I'm serious I think they do have that
I actually probably have that
Since I downloaded all of them at some point
Call it a hunch
But I think that was made for people
That don't have English as a first language
That maybe want to move to London
Or those places you know
But then you pick it up quick
I stopped being a wanker
You can speak like them
Stop being a wanker
Alright let's see
My gaming week
Actually I played a crap ton of games
I know I usually get on here and like
I played WoW
And I did play WoW
I finally hit level 80 on my paladin
Thank you very much
Da da da da
So I did that
Stop sighing over there DarkSakura
That was a yawn
Sorry
Well I didn't just play WoW
I actually played a lot of games
Because here you go
Wake up for this DarkSakura
This is very important
I have a 360 again
That sounds like a personal problem
Shut up
Now after the whole like what
Four or five months
I haven't had one
It was like August 11th or something
That update came out
That borked my 360
I finally have a new 360
And I spent a lot of time
Just catching up on stuff
I just filled up my queue
With like Kix
And Bubble Bobble Neo
And Rainbow Islands
None of these games
I played really in depth
In fact oddly enough
The game I probably played more than anything
I went back
I just had this itching to play
Castlevania Symphony of the Night
It probably has something to do with the fact
That that's like one of the best games ever made
That I wanted to go back and play it
And that I never really played it through to completion on 360
So I've been sinking a lot of time into that
Also though
Speaking of Castlevania and that whole
You know Metroid
And the exploration game
One game that just kind of wasn't on my radar last year
Was Shadow Complex
And I finally took the opportunity to play
And I finally took the opportunity to download Shadow Complex
To my 360 and check it out
And wow
Did I miss that
Like seriously
That game was kind of awesome
And by kind of I mean really
It is like a Super Metroid
Castlevania type exploration game
But a little more modernized you know
And part
I gotta be honest
Part of what kept me away from looking at that game before
Is when I was looking at the screenshots and everything
I was like
Looks like a clancy
Espionage kind of game
And I'm not usually into those games
I don't want to play a gun scope killing game
I don't really like those kind of games
I will admit
That was ignorant of me
Very ignorant
But I finally got over it
And downloaded the game
And I had an awesome time with it
I am really wanting to play that game through to completion
And I highly recommend it
It was fun
I was impressed by how much they crammed into
An arcade download
Because seriously
They could charge 30 bucks for this stuff on Blu-ray
Or I'm sorry
It's 360
They could charge this on a DVD
And put it in stores
And most folks would be none the wiser
So
Yeah
I was very excited to play Shadow Complex
I'll spend a little bit of time with Gyromancer
Which I played on the PC a little bit ago
But one of my friends sat me down
And kind of explained the game a little better
Because I gotta admit the tutorial
The game kind of is very wordy
Didn't make a whole lot of sense
But having it explained to me really helped
Once I'm able to get over that hurdle
Of thinking about the board
Like it's regular Bejeweled
And thinking of it like Bejeweled Twist
The game is very interesting
And I actually think it's a little more accessible
Than Puzzle Quest
Which was just
Battle after battle
After micromanaging
After micromanaging
Gyromancer does feel a little more straightforward
Like there is a start any finish
And yes you have these maps
You can go back and play them
But there just seems to be
I don't know
I feel more accomplished playing Gyromancer
Like I feel like I got nowhere in Puzzle Quest
Because I didn't spend a hundred hours with it
But yeah
I'm looking forward to spending more time with Gyromancer
And you know one thing that a lot of folks asked
When I got the 360
Because I had to do that mandatory tweet
From Twitter on the 360
Where I said
Hi I'm tweeting for my 360
Because I think everybody did that tweet
When it first came out
Didn't
Well those that used Twitter anyway
That's what you do
Did you even bother to look at it on the 360?
No
Well that's why
Because I didn't care
I have it on my computer
I got to be honest
It's really nothing
Like it's a frivolous silly thing on the 360
And probably is something most people look at only once
I got to say I did play with Facebook a little bit too
And I think Facebook looks hideous on the 360
I hate the way it's laid out
Because they try to put Facebook in the Xbox crossbar format
Which the more and more I use it
The more and more I really don't like the NXC
I just I love all the features
I hate the layout
Like what they had before
I honestly think was better
But whatever
The cool thing about Facebook is that
You can find friends on Facebook
That are on 360
And you can find friends on 360
That are on Facebook
Like the gamer tags and names are linked
So like maybe I have people on my Xbox list
That I didn't have added on Facebook
Or like for example
Somehow I didn't have Tiara on my Xbox 360 list
But I found because she's on my Facebook
That she had a gamer tag
So I sent her a friend request
So Tiara if you're listening
Accept my friend request
You're making me cry
And of course I had to play a little bit of last FM2
I had to catch up on all this crap I missed
I realized this is like months old
That it was all new to me
But anyway the Twitter response I got to my tweet
About hi for my 360 I have one again was
Oh well guess your Playstation 3 is going to be collecting dust now huh?
No I think
Honestly this little bit of downtime
Has really raised my respect for Sony
Because I know we've given them a lot of crap on the show
And rightfully so
Don't get me wrong
I haven't suddenly said
Sony has forgiven for everything they've done wrong
I think they made lots and lots of great improvements in 09
And you know there's things I look forward to from them in 2010
And in fact there's going to be some cases
Where it's 360 versus Playstation 3
I'm going the route of Playstation 3
For example Final Fantasy 13
I plan to buy that on Playstation 3
Better controller
I think the game was designed for that in the first place
That's just where I'm going
Microsoft fans put down the hate mail
Because there's some things I'm going to opt for on 360 as well
For instance a lot of the things that have online play
I just know more people on 360
That's probably where I'll go with those games
Plus I'm still playing a lot of DJ Hero
And that's on Playstation 3 for me
So I have to throw that out there too
I finally got the trophy for playing every song in the game at least once
Even the songs I didn't want to play
I finally played everything at least once
So making good progress there
Let's see I'm going to our chatroom again
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com
Some people wondering what NXC was
Because I just rattled that off
Yeah that's the new Xbox experience
That's the new interface they launched
When was that? Was that last holiday?
That was about September of 2008
I think so
When they switched from what was called the Blades to this new system
That I can't stand
I cannot stand the new 360 layout
I love it
Sony fans, I'll give you that
I think Playstation 3 makes a hell of a lot more sense
Than 360 does to navigate around
I actually think it's really simple how they have it set up
There's so much useless garbage in there
Do you know how long it took me to figure out how to change my theme?
Like something that shouldn't be that hard
Oh I have to go into Myself
And then it's there
Oh it's not in the guide button
It's not in these other settings page
Oh I have to do this and this
I thought that made perfect sense for it to be there
I mean if it's my theme it would be my preference
But there's nowhere on that box to say my preferences
In fact if you hit the guide button and go into preferences
You get a bunch of console preferences
That have nothing to do with theme
But like parental guides and user ratings and things I thought I disabled
That's not where I thought to go
I like it better
I like how it's laid out better
I think that it makes a lot more sense the way it's laid out
The only thing that I don't like is just the ads
I guess for the stuff that I don't care about
But really the stuff that I want to get to quickly
I can get to very quickly
And to be fair Sony has the ads too
So if I'm going to hate it on 360 I have to hate it on Sony
But I don't know the crossbar just works better for me
Than NXT has been working
But to Microsoft's credit
They tend to upgrade their crap pretty fast
And maybe some of these things that I'm QQing about
They will fix on the next update
Even though I think they're only doing them yearly now
I'm not sure
Anyhow
That's pretty much it for my gaming week
I know I talked about a lot of games
And really I didn't even talk about everything I played
Because I went on a shopping spree on Steam
Because they've been having their massive holiday sale
I don't know if you guys have looked at this
Dude I got Morrowind for five bucks yesterday
Just because it was five bucks
And I liked Oblivion yet I never played Morrowind
So I was like I'm going to drop five bucks on it
And I got Luminous last week
And I think there was another game I bought too
That's the problem with this stinkin' Steam sale
Is that yeah the games are only five bucks
But suddenly I bought four of them
I dropped twenty
You've just been friended Rob
Yay! Did you get a message from Tiara?
She's listening
Thank you Tiara
Now I'm going to kick your ass in Puzzle Fighter
I'm just kidding
Alright we'll rock band or something
Anyhow that's it for my gaming week
So let's go to housekeeping
Podcast listeners I know you thought we've neglected you
And I'm sorry and that's my bad
That has nothing to do with Jamie or Matt
That's my responsibility and I've really slacked on it over the holidays
But I cracked the whip today
I got all four shows from December up
And we are caught up
And one of my
Although I don't like to make New Year's resolutions
One of my goals let's say for 2010
Is to do Monday turnarounds on the shows
So that those are up on the feeds on Monday
So keep me on my toes
Twitters and Facebookers
If I don't have the show up
Tell me just quit playing WoW and get the damn show up
It is by the way it is not as simple as
Just clicking a button that says upload
Because we do edit the show
We don't say edit, we don't edit content
We don't really edit anything out unless there's
Like a huge technical failure that causes the show
To go down for ten minutes or something
But we have to clean up the actual MP3s themselves
Take out the little, you know
You're listening to all games radio and all that
And the little stuff that gets in the master file
And all that technical jumbo
And then we have to string it together to one file
Because we can't put the music break up
And put that all up so
It is a little more than just clicking a button that says upload
Anyhow
I'm not the technical jabber behind the show
I do want to say one other bit of housekeeping
I will not be here in two weeks
I have a long weekend
Martin Luther King is holiday for me
So I actually am taking a long weekend
To go to Seattle
There's nothing going on out there
I'm just going to say hey
And be a tourist for a little while
I will not be here though because I'm coming home on Monday
So I believe
One of our long time listeners
And listened so long we just made him
One that Suya is cooking up a best of
That I'm hoping we'll be ready by that week
So that's very exciting
Also later in tonight's show
Listless is coming back
We haven't done Listless in forever
We're doing one tonight
And our old pal Bobby Blackwolf who does the show before us
Is going to join us
Because he always has us on his show
But we never seem to get him on ours
Because we're on after him
So there's no real tease at the end of the show
Because we go off air at that point
To at least say thank you and let him participate
In our silly little game
But before we get to the games we get to the news
Loki
Yes there's a rumor
Kind of evolving the
Development of the Playstation 4
Which you know
You know it's coming eventually
And obviously they're probably
You know they started work on it
The day after the Playstation 3 came out
So one of the
Possible pieces of technology
That will be in the Playstation 4
And possibly considered for
You know additional
Units afterwards
Would be this thing called
Project Larrabee
And what it is
It's actually a
A piece of hardware
Developed by Intel
And it's kind of an architecture
That revolves around
A lot of CPU's that's for sure
You know the
Kind of diagram that they have
They have a bunch of different CPU cores
Including this picture I think it's about
16 cores
And each with their own
Cache and kind of revolving
Around this thing they call a ring bus
Very cool looking
And I guess it's
Supposed to be
Obviously very different than the cell
Architecture that's available now
I imagine since it's kind of being developed
Around technology that's
Around new multi-cell processors
That something like this wouldn't be
Too
Too hard to develop or too hard to
Manufacture
And this is coming from
PC Watch's
Hirosinji Goto
Naming some
Unnamed sources
Familiar with Intel's long waited Larrabee project
And also
Apparently Intel was
Pursuing relationships with Microsoft and Nintendo
As well for their next gen consoles
So maybe this
Technology might not be only in this
You know Sony console
And who knows if it's even going to be in the Sony console
But
I don't know it's kind of neat
And something like this you know
They could definitely scale it
To however many
I guess processors they want in there
Akdeft in chat says breaking news PS4 is coming eventually
Which I think is what a lot of us
That just kind of looked at the story went
Yeah okay so PS4 they're already planning some of the stuff for it
Sure it's going to happen sometime
What would this really mean for the system
I mean is this just a boost in power
Is this
You know is this
Vaporware like the emotion engine chip
Or I mean what is this
Well multi-processors like that I mean obviously
It's going to be the crunch everything from graphics
To physics
To game logic
Whatever I mean so with this obviously
You're going to be able to push
Better graphics you know
Better physics in the games
You know more detailed
Gameplay
You know better sound
You know a whole lot more detail in there
Problem is though when you are able
To push that much details
You have to also create that much detail
And then development costs rise
And so on and so forth
So there is you know
Kind of a
Downside to everything
That's how Nintendo is kind of getting around it
Because their system isn't really pushing that
You know great graphics
Although there are companies that will try to kind of
Squeeze every ounce of
You know power out of the Wii
You know you don't have to
Because their console doesn't look that
I mean there's only so much they can do
Graphic wise in there so
Kind of to let the gameplay
Shine through but with Sony though
You know it's really all about
Just trying to push
Better graphics
Better specs, better everything
I mean that's really what they've been
Doing from the get go
That's what they've been really pushing with
You know remember with the Playstation 3
They're like oh yeah all the games are going to come out 10EP
Everything is going to run at 120 frames per second
It's going to be super awesome
You're just going to blow your load when you see anything on the screen
You know that type of stuff
And obviously that didn't really happen
I mean a lot of this stuff comes out now
720p, nothing is running at 120 frames per second
I mean TV's
Most TV's out there don't even
You wouldn't be able to see that so
Let me ask a weird like maybe tangent kind of question
That I don't even know if it has an easy answer
So I'm really posing this to Chad as well
I know we say this a lot
I've said this as a kid
And I've said this growing up
And I'm sure a lot of you did this too
Like even back in the Nintendo days
8 bit NES days
Dude games look so realistic now
I don't know how they're going to look any better
I mean it looks like a cartoon on my screen
It's awesome right
We always kind of say that and then somehow they get better
But I really feel like we're at this point now
Where like Playstation 3
And Xbox 360
Like the stuff that that renders
Really is close to like DVD
Blu-ray quality
I mean what is left to improve
My eye cannot tell the difference
That easily between 720p and 1080p
How are they going to justify
An upgrade to Playstation 4
And the other thing too is
I mean who knows what technology is going to be like
When the Playstation 4 comes out
I mean how long did it take for them to develop
High definition and 720p
And 1080p and so yeah it's only a few years
I mean we have no idea
What technology is going to be like then
This kind of processor I wouldn't be surprised
If we see this in a future PC
Processor or anything
Where you can add
Something beyond 4 cores
You can just add as many cores as you want
I mean granted
Chip might be bigger or you have multiple processors
In there and stuff but
I don't know it's interesting
I guess I have to admit
You have a pretty good argument there
The thing that it will do we haven't thought of yet
Or it would already be in the system
Or they are just making it to do things
That we haven't thought of yet
What about and this might be crazy talk
But especially with you know
Avatar the movie having done so
Well
At the box office being so well received
Especially as the visuals I mean
I haven't seen it yet myself and I know I ragged
On it but clearly I must have
Been wrong because everybody I know has been raving
About the movie even if they don't like the story
Everybody is pretty consistent with
But the visuals wow wow
Wowie wow
You know is this whole 3D
Thing where maybe games are going
I actually do want to go see it in IMAX
Take me with you
Because I'm kind of wanting to see it now
Like just so many people
Are having such a big boner over it
I'm like okay maybe I was wrong
I'll go see the damn movie
Let's go before I start school
I could probably do that so we'll talk off air
Anyhow I think I have
4 hours available on Thursday
This is right? 4 hours?
It's a James Cameron movie it's about 4 hours?
2 and a half hours
I have a free screen for it this week
Or this week in 3D but I've already seen it
Whoa
I'll go
Give me your tickets
I think it's on Tuesday
Actually it is on Thursday
Hey that's funny
Maysatsuma in chat says
The Playstation 4 will give you new eyes
To see its new better ultra graphics
Dude you might be joking
But if we're talking 3D you gotta have those glasses
Right? That's new eyes of a source
Not really, well yeah
You do need the glasses
I could see something for
Realty where it's just polarized glasses
Those things are cheap
I'd rather have that than $200 shutter glasses
And I guess the old rule of thumb is
Gaming has to get closer and closer
To the holodeck from Star Trek
Is that every system
Brings us one step closer to the holodeck
And 3D glasses
Will be a pretty big step in that direction
Until eventually
My Playstation 6
Is just a room in my house
That I walk into and you know computer
Activate Final Fantasy
Program and I am in the holodeck
Basically
That's where gaming is headed right?
At least that's how I imagined it
Well you remember we did have the U-Force
The U-Suck
The U-Force
My friend had one of those
It did not work like you would think
In the advertisements that's for dang sure
I've got one of the ones that came with
Oh shoot
What was that game that was on
Genesis and then on Sega CD
The Activator
But now I can't remember the game
It was a really cool game
I will never forget when Loki took the Activator
The Para Para Paradise controller
No I thought about it
Basically I just took it apart
No actually I didn't even take it apart
I just threw it away
Or I don't know what I'd do with that
I was going to though
Tigerclaw says people will use the holodeck
More than just for video games if you know what I mean
That's true there is the age old question
About any new peripheral or game device
Or anything that is released
That has to do with a piece of plastic
There is the age old question
You have to ask
Anytime you hear about a new peripheral
Anytime you hear about something new being released
The question is
How long until someone puts their dick in it
Not necessarily how long
It's basically
As I've seen it before
It's TTP
Is there a website dedicated to this
No there isn't
It's basically
How long will someone create a penis with it
Or put their penis in it
And install Linux on it
That's the other question
Or use it in conjunction with their penis
That's basically
For example
The Wii Vitality sensor
How long until someone puts a penis into that
You know
Xbox One is positive
LittleBigPlanet
How long until someone creates a penis in that
That was like milliseconds
There is a whole bunch of stuff like that
But I mean that is a good point
If we get to the holodeck
There's going to be guys that never leave the house
I mean
I hope the holodeck has a holo-bathroom
Because people will live there
It's going to be strange
Anyhow
Alright hey
Changing tones completely
Something else that game devices do these days
Is play movies
And obviously digital distribution is getting big
But some studios might have some second thoughts
This week Sony apparently
Put the movie Armored
Which is a new release that is playing in theaters right now
I had not heard of this movie
But it looks like the bow-pow
Action type of flick that I would not usually see
It's Armored
Is the movie
And it's Matt Dillon
And Laurence Fishburne
And Jean Renaud
And all these people
Peter Petrelli is in it though
I see him in the poster
The movie
I don't know how it's doing at the box office
I don't think it's in the top ten
Because you've got Avatar
And the Sherlock Holmes
And the freaking chipmunks
How did that happen?
And all this
Well Armored, despite the fact that it's not doing well in theaters
Maybe this is not helping the case
It was available for download on the Playstation Store this week
That's right
You could actually download a movie
Already in theaters
Not just that, it was up for free
I call that the internet
Well yeah, but usually this type of thing is not like
Officially done by Sony
And to be honest
This really wasn't either
It was of course
Whoopsie
Somebody accidentally put that thing up
Long before it should have gone up
And put it up for the price of free
But what I think is interesting about this
I mean, yeah, haha, point and laugh
At Sony for whatever happened over this
But I find it interesting
That this movie was all ready to go
I mean, clearly
This was the case of somebody pushing the button too early
Or pushing the wrong button
And causing this movie to go up on the site way early
But it was already encoded
It was already sitting on a server waiting to be dumped
It was just waiting for someone to throw the switch
I kind of find it interesting
That the movies are at that point
Where
Nobody's waiting to
Deliver the movie to the service
And I realize
I think this is one of Sony's studios that put the movie out
So maybe that's part of the reason
But I mean
Isn't that kind of weird
That it was sitting there on the store waiting to go
Like, probably all these movies
Are already sitting on the store
People knew how to hack in there
Keep in mind that
And this even goes back to the VHS days
Is that there were often
Screener copies available for awards ceremonies
I actually had a copy of American Pie
Not American Pie
American Beauty
When
No, I take that back, I take that back
It was Titanic is what I had
I had a screening version of Titanic
When it had just gotten out of the theater
Which was the only way I was going to see it
It was for free
Yeah, a really good friend of mine who may or may not be sitting in this room
Used to get those screener copies all the time
No, not those kind of screener copies
Not the review screeners
The actual
For your consideration
Oscar screeners
They have screen copies of movies
Like, literally right, sometimes even before they come out
We watch Snakes on a Plane
At my work
Right before we went to theaters
And
Yay, but you know
I saw that at Disneyland
It's done, you know, it can be done
Yeah, but I don't think Playstation 3
Is being used as a screening service
It's kind of interesting if it could be
I'm kind of surprised
With piracy and everything going on
I'm kind of surprised they don't have a device
It'll be funny if that copy gets ripped
And just, you know, dumped
I'm sure it already happened
It happened long before you thought of it
Here's the thing though
I don't care about that movie at all
If I saw it for free
I'd be like, nope, still don't want to watch it
Sorry
I have better things to do
For an hour and a half
Yeah, but still
I'm gonna say call like weird on the whole
You know, it was up on the marketplace
Long before it should have been
Right?
Yeah
That does kind of go without saying
Well, I'm sure somebody's gonna get a write-up
Over that one
We'll see what happens now
Someone's probably pissing their pants
Probably already fired
Well, how about
I think this is strange news at all
But Final Fantasy 13 sales have actually decreased
From how they were during the release
It actually
I don't see why that's a really big thing
Because, I mean
Just about when anything comes out
Especially something big like that
Everyone's gonna be picking up their copy during the first week
It had a million plus release day
Broke records for the first week
And then it
Basically dropped
About a million units
Into the second week
It did take a dip
Because everyone's already bought it
Also, Squeenix
Is pretty much like
When it gets the worldwide release
We're gonna hit our numbers
So they're not too worried about it
I think another thing, especially with Final Fantasy 13
Dude, they released it the week before Christmas
So of course the second week
I mean, I don't know how big
Of a holiday Christmas is in Japan
Compared to here, I'm imagining it's not quite the same
Big deal and same shopping patterns
That we have here
But, you know, still
That's gotta have some impact
You don't really have the amount of holiday purchasing
Going on in the second week
When you release your game the week before
A big holiday, right?
I'm sure that's a part of it too
But I kinda get where this is going
They talk about this in movies a lot
And the late drop off can usually tell you
Like the longevity of a movie
Sometimes you have these sequels that come out
And they drop off huge in the second week
And that means the movie's probably not gonna do very well
Even if it had a good weekend
But other movies like, well, Avatar
For example
Is not showing a lot of signs of slowing down
I don't think it's gonna have the longevity of a movie
Like Titanic
But it's been dropping off very slowly
In its first few weeks of release
And doesn't look like it's gonna slow down
The Oscar season gets rip roaring
So, you know, I think
A lot of game companies like to see that happen
With a game
But yeah, Final Fantasy, you sort of expect this is gonna happen
Most Final Fantasy fanboys and girls are pretty rabid
They go out and buy it the first day
And, you know, you're not gonna see the same
Type of sales the second and third week
I think the same thing's gonna happen here in the US
And in Europe
Huge first week sales, huge drop off second week
90% drop off second week
And unfortunately they're just not releasing it
In a time like Christmas
Where it's gonna sell consistently
You know, March is kind of a weird month
They should have already had it ready
Well, we'll see
Alright, so other things
You know
Might cause the drop off of Final Fantasy 13
Would be
Wiiwa
Okay, well maybe not
But, um
Wiiwa is this thing
I think I talked about on the show before
Where I got my Cage Match song
D-A-N-C-E
From
At least the idea for it
Basically, Wiiwa is a brand new game that's coming out
And
It's using a unique
Kind of a
Controller attachment
Basically it's this big stuffed animal
I guess it would be a Wiiwa
That you shove the remote into
And you kind of
Walk it around and jump
And do all sorts of weird stuff with it
To control the character in game
It's like a
Muppet, basically, you have your own Muppet
Something like that, yeah
You shove your Wiimote up its ass
And you can make it dance and sing
So, um
It looks neat
I guess, I don't know
What kind of game is it?
Is it a Pet Sim game? Is it like an action game?
No, it's like an action game
It's like something you'd see from Rare or something even
Just kind of a little
Platformer game where you walk around and you sneak up
On enemies and stuff like that
They have little mini games in there
Including one that I guess the Wiiwa has these
Bungee cord things on it
Where you can fling it into the air
And you kind of do that
Almost like a spring
I'm pulling up a little video here in studio
Courtesy of our chat room
Wow
I just crashed the Bandicoot
Oh, you put the Wiimote in its mouth
So you force feed it
Okay
Oh, so you have to like
Shake the thing around
That's kind of cute
Back and forth and stuff
That's adorable
It is kind of cute, like I noticed that
It's not aimed at adults
They have a little six year old kid
In the video
You're sneaking up and then
You've got to duck down
That's cute
I would totally play this
He's got a little play cord thing
That's great
You know what though
I'm a little worried
Doesn't this seem like the type of thing that probably works way better
In the preview than it does in real life
Like you're probably throwing this guy around
And it's just like fucking move the way I want you to
Yeah, but if they've got a kid doing it
Well, come on
This is all cut and paste
He's not actually playing the game
I want to actually see
A practical demo of this
So
Interesting
Although I will point out
That little stuffed animal has a hole in its mouth
Time to penis, 15 seconds
Just saying
It's a new peripheral
It has to be measured, no pun intended
That's true
Speaking of
Speaking of adorable and cute games
Although this one I don't think Jamie plays quite as much
Maybe she should though
And if she wants to know where to begin
LittleBigPlanet has done the first annual
SAKI awards
Or that they're calling them the Sakademy awards
I think that's a really cute little pun there
The Sakademy awards
Media Molecule has been giving out all these types of awards
Did you know there's 1.5 million LittleBigPlanet levels right now
Holy crap
That's a lot
Like stupid levels
Probably 1.49 million
Really bad levels
That's still a lot though if you have 100,000 good levels
That's true
Some of the awards that they gave out
Best Mashima video
Best visuals and use of special effects
Best use of story in a level
And all more
The best visuals one was pretty awesome
It was a post-apocalyptic
I think was the name of it
And it actually had really good lighting
And explosion effects in there which is pretty awesome
I saw one where the Sakboy would step on a switch
And then this piano just started to play Beethoven
And it wasn't even one of those musical levels
Where you hang on to the vehicle and it plays a song
As you run through the level
But no, an actual piano came down
And little feet would dance on the keys and play Beethoven
I was like, good god this game is crazy
In a good way
The things people do with it is insane
But here's
Here's what LittleBigPlanet needs
One thing I think is missing right now
Is that if you go in to play custom levels
I think the interface right now for playing custom levels
Is still a little eh
What they need to do is take these award winners
And put them on a separate planet or something
Or put them in a separate menu
Something where I can go straight to the best
Where I can weed through all the crap that's out there
And just go straight to these levels I have to see
I wonder if they had a category for best trophy whoring level
Because remember when the game first came out
All the high rated levels were like
Earn seven trophies in thirty seconds
Exclamation exclamation one one one
I was looking at some of the other ones on there
Of course the Contra one
One for best collaboration which is awesome
All the Contra levels
As it should have
There was
Best
Logic device or something like that
Or computer
And it was the LittleBigPlanet calculator
LittleBigPlanet calculator because that was really
Really involved
There was
I'm trying to think what some of the other ones were
There was like a best community project
I didn't understand what that was
I think it was just like tools
They had logic tools that you could use for your
Your machines and stuff
But yeah definitely check out
The post apocalyptic level because that looked pretty
Our good friend Bobby
Is in chat and says
They might be in the news section Sky
I forgot LittleBigPlanet had a news section but that's a good point
Although I wonder if it will link directly to the levels
I mean I'm sure it says something about the awards
In the news section but I wonder if it
Would link directly to the levels I don't know
At the same time when I have been
Playing LittleBigPlanet recently I've been checking out
Those new Pirates of the Caribbean levels so
I haven't had time to check out this academy winners
How'd you like those?
It was cute I didn't play a whole lot
So I can't really give you a full review yet but
I was kind of surprised that you
Can't stay under water very long
There's a lot of things later that increase your breathing time
And things I haven't gotten to yet
You can get scuba gear that
Allows you to breathe under water
Forever
So you can get that
I figured that was there yeah
I did like how the water can raise and lower
There was one part of the very first level
Where you can flood the town
And then you bring the flood down
It was kind of neat
I do
I just love the fact that LittleBigPlanet
Is still being supported
And that they haven't taken that route
That I think some developers would have and put all this
In LittleBigPlanet 2
They've really been supporting this one game
You know it's
A really good Playstation 3 value I gotta say
I've colored me impressed
You know I named it my game of the year
Last year and I still stand by it
I think that's one of the greatest games
They've released in quite some time
But
Maybe I'm just biased I don't know
Anyhow moving on with more news and we'll get to release dates
DarkSakura what do you got for us?
I have some news about
Sonic Racing
For 360
Not Sonic R just to clarify
But there's actually going to be
Characters that you can use
For Sonic Racing namely your avatars
Will be playable and
Banjo Kazooie
While I really don't give a crap about Banjo
I actually think it would be pretty cool to go ahead
And use my
My avatar and the other
Characters in the game too are
Of course Sonic Tails, Shadow
I from Super Monkey Ball
Samba
Samba de Amigo Monkey
Beat from Jet Set Radio
Alex Kidd, Billy Hatcher
Whoa whoa whoa
Sega is acknowledging Jet Set Radio?
Yes
That's good right?
Alex Kidd
Oh wow when was the last time we had an Alex Kidd game?
Billy Hatcher
And Ryo Hazuki
The guy from Shenmue
Wow it's like Sega is like
Throwing bones at all these like
Fan like dammit we need
A new Jet Set Future, Jet Set Radio
Dammit we need a new Shenmue and now they're like
They're teasing us with this silly little
Racing game
Well you remember when they teased us with having knights
In that stupid
Eye Toy game
Oh yeah knights in the game?
But they said that there's
Rumors though that other possibilities is
Ulala and
Akira from
Virtua Fighter and Vice from Skies of Arcadia
Now they're just being mean
Like we all know there's not gonna be
Another Space Channel 5 game so
There could be
Space Channel 5
I really wish there would be but like
They're just being mean by putting Ulala in the game
Like that's just rude
Space Michaels in the game
If they put Pudding Da in there
I'm gonna scream
Cause she was my favorite
She was my favorite
For me, sorry, it was Jaguar
Cause we come with TAAAAA
With this little group
Please please please if you've never heard of Space Channel 5
You really owe it to yourself to go look at the videos on YouTube
Or try to find a copy if you can
On Dreamcast or Playstation 2
They had the collection
Oh man I love that game
I really wish they'd bring that back
Because I cannot believe
And I'm hanging my head in shame
As I'm even talking about this
I bought stupid Barbie crap
For my avatar cause I'm ridiculous
But it was
Why are you sighing at me Loki?
Don't judge me
Stop judging me
Why?
Why bother
Buying stuff for your avatar?
Because it was really funny
It made me laugh cause it's in the band hero section
There's a microphone
And it has a giant purple ribbon
Like the kind some 16 year old
Girl would have
In her band
I think it was the Taylor Swift microphone
I bought that cause
I liked karaoke and all that stuff
It was really funny and it made me laugh
When my avatar was dancing with it
But then I was thinking
If I'm playing this racing game or whatever
You're not gonna see that microphone shoved in the back of the car
Boo
It would be funny
Remember that racing game that they had out
That was free to download and then they have all those
Expansions you have to buy and stuff to it
On 360?
Well keep in mind I've been asleep for the past 5 months
On 360 so no
Oh did it?
I think
I don't know
Honestly because
No I don't know if it came out because I would have downloaded it
Cause it would have been free
I don't know
How behind I am
I just finally downloaded my
Copy of
Madballs
Nice
I've had the code for it forever
Oh yeah I should probably download that
Oh yeah well come on here I am on the show
Going hey guys
Shadow Complex wow what a great game
Most people are like yeah didn't you get the memo like 6 months ago
So many games
So little time keep in mind
We all have day jobs
Your game sites you like to go surf and all that
They get paid to play games 8 hours a day
And all that we don't do that
We have to work in our free time so
Sometimes we can't play everything
And by the way chat there's a lot of folks in chat saying
Like Misty says
Barbie crap I bought a cell phone and I got the
Free chocobo I waste enough money
On rock band download content
Act Def said I would have expected Disney stuff
But Barbie come on Rob I wasn't being literal
It wasn't literally Barbie
But I call it that because
I mean it's basically the same thing it's like a dress your Barbie doll
And there's no
I did pay for avatar content
Did I tell you? What'd you buy?
I got one of the steampunk outfits
I actually have left over points
Do you have one of those ginormous helmets or something?
No I got like the duster jacket with the
Kinda gypsy top
But I'm actually planning on
Getting the rest of the steampunk set
Because I actually I don't really buy much with my points
Dan usually puts all the points on his account
And buys this stuff for us
So I was gonna go ahead and get
The rest of the steampunk outfit because I think
The stuff's cute
I have sim stuff what's the difference?
One of the games I didn't mention
During my gaming week but I did play for a little while
Was One vs. 100 and I was actually cracking up
Because you know sometimes it'll show these random
People in the mob who get questions right
Or wrong and like it cracks
My shit up when like I see this person wearing
Just like a t-shirt and jeans but they
Have one of those like uber robot helmets
On their avatar and it's like
That looks hideous like
And 45,000 people just saw how stupid your avatar looks like
And they couldn't be happier
Then again I have a princess microphone
So who am I to judge?
Who am I to judge?
At least you didn't buy a fake cat
I didn't buy a fake cat
Alright let's travel the world and look at some release dates
If there are any
This week actually there's some pretty decent stuff coming out
On Playstation 3 and Xbox 360
We have Darksiders from THQ
Will be making its way out this week
Also Fable 2 is getting a
Platinum Hits version
Coming out this week
With the download content of course
For 30 bucks
Newer games though, Bayonetta finally making its way out
On Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 this week
So definitely worth picking that one up
Fast Food Panic on the Nintendo DS
Making its way out
And
Not really gaming related
But the Guinness Book of World Records
Gamer's Edition
Is making its way out to book stands as well
And you should at least
Thump through it but I don't know if you should
Pay them for it you know
Unless your coffee table is empty and you need some
Or honestly the top of your toilet
Is needed some new material who knows
Trust me for 15 bucks
You can find some better magazines for that
Hell that's a few playboys or penthouses
Geez
If you're looking for more toilet
Stuff you know I'm seriously
Better than the Guinness Book
Do we really need to see
Oh hey look Batman Arkham Asylum
Was the greatest game ever
Guinness says it must be true
Or do you want to see some tits
Or do you want to see some badge
I just want to point out
Some of our listeners are like 16, 17
If you realize this right
Welcome to adulthood
Don't you know you're supposed to say twat
And seriously
They know as well as I do
That the Guinness Book of World Records
Gamer's Edition is crap okay
I only looked at it one time
The 2009 or 2008
Who cares they all suck
Because I was killing time while my wife looked for books
And I was just like
Okay I've read this magazine read this magazine
Hey Gamer's Edition let's see this is crap
That's it for releases
Unfortunately
You only have those magazines for the articles
Of course right
Actually the articles are really boring
Some of the forums are funny
But the articles suck
Alright moving on
Let's look at Japanese release dates
How we go from that to Japanese release dates
I have no idea but we do
On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan
James Cameron's Avatar the game
Gets it's Japanese localization
From Ubisoft this week
On the 7th of January
That's when the games are coming out
That is also making it's way to the Playstation 3
Just so you know
Also I want to point out
Speaking of Batman Arkham Asylum
That is finally making it's way to Japan next week
It will not be on the 7th
But it will be on the 14th
So you'll probably hear me say it again next week
The Wii is empty this week
There's really not a lot to look forward to there
So is the Playstation 2
On the PSP
You got Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep
And I think that's pretty much your other
Big big big game this week
Did you see the trailer for that?
I have seen little bits and pieces
If you go to the website for it
The trailer is freaking amazing
Then put it on the console
This is my biggest bitch about these
Portable games
Did you hear
Earlier this week
On the DSI
Like
Old school Apple 2E or this new shit
This new shit
Pass
I'm like you don't have direction
Keys on the
DS in order to
Shoot
I bet in these new games do you shoot
Like 5 Buffalo and then like congratulations
You shot 3400 pounds of food
Unfortunately you can only carry 100
Back to the wagon
I somehow doubt it
I remember that
Good times
I was gonna say there's actually
Another Oregon Trail game that I linked
In our show roll
You have to see it's Oregon Trail of Physics
It's awesome
The Oregon Trail of Physics?
No, Oregon Trail with Physics
What is this? Did it not make the show roll tonight?
Then tell us about it
It's this game, it's not even really called the Oregon Trail
But it is exactly the Oregon Trail
It's basically
The Oregon Trail
You stuff your cart full of crap
Whatever you're carrying with you
And you take
It's like combining the Oregon Trail with
That sledding game
I don't remember what it was
You like jump hills
You're oxed
Just start running down the hill and then
You go off of it and fly and stuff
And if you land upside down like people get injured
Stuff like that
I've seen a Flash game like that
Somebody skinned that with the Oregon Trail basically
Yeah, it's
What was it called here?
It is
Let's go find El Dorado
How do you die of dysentery in the game?
Is that possible?
There's a video of it
Is it a Flash game?
It might be a Flash game
I don't know
I'm gonna look into this while Dark Sakura
Covers the UK releases
You know, it's funny
I was just saying
What was it called? The Road to El Dorado?
I was just watching the Mysterious Cities of Gold last night
So I thought that was funny
Hello Random!
It is Random!
It's on Hulu now, Rob
The Mysterious Cities of Gold
They have all this crazy stuff on Hulu
Oh my god, look, he's showing me a picture
Hahahahaha
Let me see
Oh, this is terrible radio
I want to see if we have sound effects that I can play
Geez
Ok, well how about UK releases?
Which are, um, yeah, two
There's Bayonetta
And Darksiders
And that's it
Happy New Year!
No surprise, though, that it's pretty smart
Bayonetta!
Although, yeah, Bayonetta's a big, big release
Can't believe they didn't try to crank that out in time for Christmas
Especially because it did get its release over there
In Japan
Maybe they're just hoping for big sales off of gift cards
I don't know
I don't know
What?
I know, I'm very excited about this game
Oh, here's a little YouTube, let me see if this
I don't know if this has sound effects or anything
But this is the Oregon Trail
It's like a little frog croaking or something
What the hell is that?
It's upside down
Did it just fart?
People do get dysentery in that
This game looks amazing
I guess it's more like Excite
Excite, um, bike with
the Oregon Trail
Somebody has typhoid right now
It's like extra physics physics
Where is this game available at?
I want it totally
Ludum Dare dot com
L-U-D-U-M-D-A-R-E dot com
You should post that in chat, Rob
I will do that right now
Good!
I'm excited that you're doing that, Rob
Just while I'm posting that in chat
Uh, Loki
Okay
Um, let's see
I got so distracted by
Oregon Trail-ish games
Um, anyways
So, some more fun stuff
Uh, Google, they have
Uh, patented
Something that's actually
Hinting to possible gaming
Uh, coming to
YouTube, well
I mean, I guess it kind of makes sense if you think about it
Um, they
Were saying that there's already
Some kind of interactive games on
YouTube, uh, kind of done with
Videos, sort of like your choose your own
Adventure type stuff
But they were saying that the patent titled
Web-based system for general
General, what was it, um
Generation of interactive games based on
Digital videos
Um, was filed
Earlier this year, or I guess last year
And it was
Um
They didn't really see what exactly it's
Gonna be, but it sounds like
Something that, um
Links videos together, creating different
Narratives and alternatives, and different scenarios
For the users, so
So, Mark, you mark create your own video?
Something, probably something
So that you can create your own, kind of choose
Your own adventure stuff, although I wouldn't be
Surprised if they did add like casual games
To YouTube or something like that
Or you could just play like little flash games
I mean, that would fit right in I would think
I don't know
You know what this reminds me of is how on YouTube
Like you sometimes see these YouTube things, it's like
I want to say there's some channel
Where it's like, play rock paper
Scissors with me, and you click on the little
Links to go to other YouTubes
Like, you know, you pick whatever
And then you see if you win or not
Really stupid stuff, so they've patented
That now? Apparently
Weird, I wonder if they're planning on like
Making a game out of it, or what
What they're gonna do
YouTube the game
I don't know how I feel about that
I have to be honest, it's a little strange to me
But whatever
Does it make you feel dirty inside, Rob?
No, it just is weird
I really don't have a lot else to add to it
But that, it's just weird
Alright, what's not as weird
Because, you know, there's a lot of folks that are really
Into classic games and respecting the classics
And so forth
There is a project going on at the Atari Museum
Where they're actually reconstructing
A lot of the old proprietary
Chips, things from the 2600
And the VCS, also known as
The Atari 5200
And Atari's old 8-bit computers
They're actually using data that was recovered
From old tapes
Used in the original manufacturing
The Atari Museum's
Kurt Vendell has noted that
The project has a practical application
Besides just, you know, it being history
What's the potential of this?
Having the chips in smaller SMT packaging
And potentially bringing back to life
Some of the later CMOS designs of combo chips
Which could lead to a
SOC, or system on a chip
The future just got a little brighter
In terms of preserving and continuing the legacy
Of Atari's custom IC chips
But I kind of go, well
I think of the flashback and stuff
But of course that's more of a console
So they're talking about just the whole dang thing
Right there on a chip
Yeah, I mean, it's like
Those flashback consoles, like for example
Though you'll see a lot of
Nintendos on a chip
I mean, it's probably not one chip
But it's a few chips, but really shrunken down
Like those little knock-off
Nintendo systems and stuff
That they sell at the mall
That Nintendo gets pissed at
Or the flea market
Tons and tons of those things
Oh yeah, those are great for turning them into
Little portable or arcade
Systems and stuff
But you know
I'm all for, of course, the
Preservation and stuff
I really get a kick out of when they
Have this, you know, they used to have it at E3 some time ago
And even when I went to
Classic Gaming Expo once a few years ago
Just getting a look at all the old
Shit, and just seeing how games
Got to where they are now
Or, you know, when you start to get in your 30s and all that stuff
You start to go, I remember when that was out
I remember when that was out, I remember playing that
I'm sure it's
Worse for others than it was for me
But boy, going to one of those made me feel
Very old
But I'm glad that that stuff
Will be preserved and hopefully made more
Portable to future generations
Speaking of classics
We always like to take a moment to
Pay some tribute to classic games
When Dark Soccer takes
A trip into the vault every week and pulls out
A game that she says, you know what, folks?
You should be playing this game
Or you should check out this game, maybe you didn't know about it before
But it's our classic video game of the week
And it's preserved in our Orange Lounge Radio Museum
Forever
Forever and ever
Which we call the Wiki
So Dark Soccer, what game are you lavishing
Praise upon this week?
First of all, the wrong link
Let me actually find the right link again
Uh oh
Yeah, because this isn't the link that I posted in the thing
Might have just broke on its way or something
So, don't know what to tell you there
Okay, there we go
Um, the game is
Chōjiki yōsai
Macross oboete imasu ka?
Which is, Macross, do you remember love?
Which, of course, we know there was
An anime movie
And actually, let's listen to the music for a second
You know the music?
That was the scrambled music
From the actual Macross movies
Explosions!
Sorry, speakers
It's a shooter based off of the
Macross anime
And this one actually has to do
With sort of
According to
The creator
Kawamori Shōji
That this is not an
Exact final word on what happened
With the crew
Of the SDF-2 Megarode 1
Which was the ship
That was taking everybody else
To, you know, discover what was
At the center of the galaxy
Um, this is just
Sort of like a dramatization
About what might have happened
But you basically
It shows you, you know, leaving Earth
And, you know, fighting, you know
A bunch of Zentradi everywhere
And it was
Actually a pretty, pretty cool
Game, it's one of my favorites
And they actually had
New dialogue recorded for
The game when it came out
By Mari Ijima
Who was Min May's voice actor
And yeah, Min May is still annoying
But, she's Min May
But lots of, you know
Shooting, you could lock on
Different enemies
In foreground and everything
It was pretty cool
And it also came out on PlayStation
And I actually have both copies
Don't ask
I came into them somehow or another
For cheap
It really is, you know
I'd say for any Macross fan
It is the game you should have
I've got actually a ton of
Macross games, I've got
The
Macross Plus game
I have Macross M3 for Dreamcast
But of all of them I think
This one is probably my favorite
Did I take the back? There's one on PC Engine
That I really like, but this one is
The more easily accessible one that I like
It's definitely
One that any
Macross and shooter fan should have
I mean, is that not just epic?
I'm not as familiar with the
Anime series, but it certainly looks like a
Heck of a shooter, but your
Your plane is huge
It takes up a pretty big chunk of the screen
I'm kind of surprised there
Between different modes
As you see it's in the
The full on robot mode, there's a
Girl walk mode which is like a half way in between
But
This did come out of here as Robotech
Gotcha
It's pretty epic
Pretty cool game
Alright
Well there it is folks, your classic
Game of the week
Macross Do You Remember Love?
On the Saturday
Check it out
Oh you know Dark Soccer
Loves her Saturn games
And we're starting off 2010 no differently
We're going to take a quick break and when we come back
We'll have plenty more of Orange Launch Radio
We've got some quick news for you this week
Including what's latest and greatest on the Virtual Console
And iPhone games and Rock Band
And we do have some other news
We're going to get into, including 8-bit
NES developments, yes, believe it or not
And video games
Meet obscure Winter Olympic Sports
I kid you not
And of course, Listless
Tonight's topic for Listless
And if you've never done Listless before, please please join us
And chat because the chat room plays a big big role in this
Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com
Tonight's topic, Thing I
Most Want to Happen in Gaming
In 2010
This could get very interesting because as you know
Sometimes we're serious and sometimes
We're not
Let's get back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio
We are live on this January
The 3rd, 2010
That's right, our first show
Of the new decade
Well, okay, you could get into that whole argument that the decade
Doesn't really begin until it's a one
Because, you know, the first
But we're going by VH1's rules, okay
So just, you know, everybody else says the new decades
There you go
Anyhow, whatever it is, it's the first show of the year
And we're here to talk about gaming news
Although it's been somewhat of a light news week
Obviously, the holidays are still going on
Lots of companies
Either furloughed their workers
Or forced PTO on their workers
And I'm sure a lot of the game companies were no different
This week, and probably the publishing companies
That run a lot of the stories too
And PR firms
All kind of taking the week off
So I'm sure that's part of the reason why it's very quiet
But with a very full first quarter this year
In fact, more so than other years past
That I can think of
News is going to pick up in the next few weeks
So we'll stay on top of it the best we can
Especially, I think, in a couple weeks
We've got CES
Oh, that's true
There's sometimes a surprise or two
I mean, CES is more of like the TVs
And the home devices
Well, it's technology, but hey, you know
There are some gaming things that come out of that
Or you might see Aibo too
I mean, I don't think we'll see Aibo too
I don't think we will either
Doesn't bow well
Outlook not good
By the way, Listlist coming up later this hour as well
Because, you know, somebody pointed out to me
You guys haven't done an OLR game in like a year
And I'm like, you know, I don't think
Since we moved to Studio Dark Sakura
Have we done a single game
And a lot of that is because we're in a tighter space
Now than we used to be, so we don't have a lot of guests in here
That will be changing
That hopefully will be changing as we get more guests
And etc.
Alright
Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news
Believe it or not, some things did happen
And we'll get into that
And then we'll get into Twitter topics after the news
Let those last few tweets come in on Twitter
So let's do rapid fire first
Well, we talked about in part A
How we've missed a lot of games that have been coming out
Well, I know for a fact
That I've missed a ton of stuff that's come out on
Xbox Live Indie Games
And here's a few games you may want to check out
First we've got
Office Politics
Which is the game you can have for the
Large sum of 80 Microsoft Points
Or $1
And it's basically kind of an Office sim
I guess
Not really like
I think Sony was pitching something like that
Rat Race that was supposed to be like a comedy
But this is very
Sims-ish
You have to manage both like
Your hunger
And how tired you are and that kind of stuff
So you can take power naps
And wonder where people are
How much you sneak on the internet?
Yep, all that fun stuff
So check that out
Ceiling Cat is watching you
Available for $1, that's a great price
There's another game, Battle Beat
It's a
Looks like almost a defense game
Very similar to say
Oh, I don't know
Like a tower defense game?
Like the Crystal Bears?
Not so much like that
It gets a little bit like a tower defense game
A little bit like Plants vs. Zombies
But you attack
And play the game with
Kind of like a beat
A little bit mixed with
A matching
Music game or something like that
So it's kind of neat, kind of fun
But since it's an indie game, don't expect any licenses
It's all kind of original beats
So it's pretty cool
It's a strategy game
So check that out, Battle Beat
That's also on Xbox Indie Games
And then finally the best one
The funniest one I think
Is Gerbil Physics
And this is also on Xbox
Oh god
And it's these gerbils
Like in little blocks and stuff
And they make funny faces
When you stick bombs next to them
Also a dollar
When you stick bombs next to them
You explode the gerbils
Yes, it's a little bit like Boom Block
It's sad
And it's just funny though
Hold on, is that a YouTube you're looking at there?
Yes it is
I know this is terrible radio
Looking at YouTubes, but I need to see
What this is all about
And maybe we'll hear some hideous noises
Through on
And
So there's all these little gerbils
Trapped in little blocks or something
You put bombs by them
They'll show the bombs in just a sec
I don't know really
But look at how their eyes get all big
And stuff like that
They look like gerbils trapped in blocks
Like how Superman's parents were trapped in the big mirror
At the beginning
It wasn't his parents
It was the three in the negatives
Whatever
Whoever the hell they were at the beginning of Superman
You will kneel before Zod
The people
Oh yeah, that's right
Because they were the people that ended up being the villains in the second movie
Whatever
That's what these gerbils look like
They look like they're trapped in the magic mirror
That's funny
So yes
You have gerbils and you're supposed to be
I think knocking them below a line
And it's cute
And you don't really injure them
But they get scared because they're being flung across the screen
And you're detonating bombs next to them
But hey, a dollar
Once again, one dollar, twenty-four levels
So I mean, that's a great price
Amaze Satsuma
In our chatroom at chat.org.com
Thinks this might have been brought to us by PETA
People Exploding Tasty Animals
That was from the chat, not from me
Views and opinions do not necessarily reflect
You laughed, you're going to hell too
I did laugh
Other things not related to Xbox Indie Games
Coming to the Wii
And this is talking about a
Blast from the past
Fast Draw Showdown
Looks like something that could be straight out of
Mad Dog McCree
And basically, kind of is
It's actually coming from Digital Leisure
Which I believe did Mad Dog McCree
Or at least published it at one time
And they're kind of known for some of the
You know, full motion
Video games
But this is like a Fast Draw game
Using the Wii Remote as like your gun
But you've got of course full motion video
Of cheesy people dressed up like cowboys
From the 80's
And uh
Back when they made laserdisc games for the sake of
Making laserdisc games and nothing more
Pretty much, yeah
Some of those games were pretty terrible
CD-ROM games, like remember when CD-ROMs
Were new on the computer?
And they made some shittacious
And I'm making up a new word there
Shittacious games
Just because you could have movies
Although there were some
Interesting ones in there too, like
Return to Zork I think was one of those games
I miss Mega Race, didn't it have Don Knots in it or something?
Fucking Don Knots
I don't know, I think it did
Didn't really play Mega Race
That was more your thing
I think that game is on GameTap
But that's back when I was using GameTap
When it was cooler
I can't say it's there now, I don't know
It was one of those games that
Really needed a two speed CD-ROM
And I had an external
Big ass
Single speed CD-ROM disc drive
So it ran kind of slow
And then later on when I got a
Newer computer and it had like a
Was a 16 speed CD-ROM drive
Which was like lightning fast
It popped in there
And the game ran too fast
I would like to see
The WiiWare emulate
Speaking of Shittacious
Remember the hologram games we had?
Oh yeah
There was a western one
I think there was only two
Hologram games
I think there was a time traveling one
They had the first levels of western
Maybe that's what I'm thinking, because I could never get past the first level
Because those games controlled like butt
Yes they did
I would like to see that crap on WiiWare
For no other reason than it fits
Well when we get to our holographic games
I'm sure that'll be like some of the first levels of the game
When we get to the holodeck
I'll be able to play that game all over again
And then you can go fuck this shit
And throw it across the room because it's virtual
And you can do that
A hitstun in our chatroom
At chat.orangelessradio.com wants to point out
Mega Race 1 and 2
Are on GOG.com
They run in DOSBox
Awesome
I do think that they should make an indie game called
Fuck This Shit where you throw controllers at things
And that would be funny
Especially if they're wiimotes
Because Nintendo is really trying hard
To get away from that image of the
Wiimotes going into televisions
That would be hilarious
And this week on the
Rockband music store
I'm sorry, real quick, do you think that would get on to
Xbox Live indie games, a game called Fuck This Shit?
Well you obviously would have to
You know, freak this stuff
Frack this
Shoot, frack this shoot
I don't know
Patent pending
Rockband this week
Of course we've talked about this for a few weeks now
Different things coming
Including the Paul McCartney download pack
Which I saw commercials for this
They are actually advertising
Download content on
VH1 and stuff
I was like, what?
But it's Paul McCartney so I guess maybe that's why
Well you know, it's kind of a big deal
When it's Paul McCartney
Three songs, I mean, come on
But yeah, they've got a
Live pack including Band on the Run, Jet
And Sing the Changes
Each of those available for two bucks
160 Microsoft Points
Or 200 Wii Points
We really do need to do conversion for you
For that, and of course you save 50 cents
If you buy them in a pack
Also coming in a three pack
Blink 182 Pack 2
Also available for $5.50 for a pack
And $1.99 each
And they include Adam's Song, First 8
And I Miss You
And then finally the individual tracks also available
For two bucks each
We have the Psychedelic Furs with Love My Way
And Sister Europe
And the Ramones with Rock and Roll High School
Which
That's pretty fun
I got linked by Hitstun in the chat room
To an article that talks about Matt Hazard
And those games, this is an article that was running on some of the gaming blogs this week
I guess there is a
Upcoming Xbox Live
And PSN title in the series
Matt Hazard, Bloodbath, and beyond
One of the difficulty levels is called
Fuck This Shit
Is actually the difficulty level
So somebody did
Kind of think about it
The game isn't called Fuck This Shit
It probably will be after you play it
Fuck This Shit
Why'd I pay for this?
Dammit
Who knows, who knows
Let's move on and talk about some other
Quick news topics this week
Loki brought up Plants vs. Zombies earlier
And I know some rumors have come up before
About the game coming over to iPhone
Well it does sound like it is happening
It's supposed to be coming to the iPhone
And of course that means the iPod Touch as well
January is what they're saying
That's from PopCap's Facebook page
No word yet if
Apple's approval process will
Fuck all that shit up
DJ David
And I always mispronounce his last name
Guetta I think is how you say it
He had a download pack available in DJ Hero
You can play some of the songs
And the odd thing about it is that
It's some of the rare songs in the games
That aren't mixed with anything
They're remixes of those songs
They're not mashups
There's very very few songs in DJ Hero
Like that but all those track packs
I want to go back and play that
I actually downloaded it and never played it
Did you know the very last song in the game
I don't think this is a spoiler
The very very last thing you unlock
Is Herbie Hancock's Rocket
With all that insane scratching
Yeah
That's the last song that you get
And it is hell
It isn't mixed with anything because the song
Like when I first played it you know what I said
Fuck this shit that's what I said
It's the one song in the game
I can't get more than like two stars on
On hard
Anyhow back to David Guetta
Cause I liked his songs quite a bit that were in the download pack
Well apparently he is actually working on
What he called the number two
Version of the game
I don't think he means the poop version
I think he actually means DJ Hero 2
Which you could read as some type of confirmation
Of a DJ Hero 2
Although I mean
File that next to Duh and of course
But you know it is kind of cool
That he is involved with it
Because you know a lot of DJs
Very prevalent ones showed up in the first game
So it's kind of cool that they're working with a different handful
Of folks for the second game
I'd like to see what kind of mashups he might produce
Cause he does some very dancy clubby type of stuff
So that would be kind of neat
To see what he puts together for
DJ Hero 2
One other quick note on a completely different note
Ogre Battle 64
I don't know if you remember this game
You might not cause I think it's one of those
Really rare games that was out
On Nintendo 64
It is apparently making its way to the virtual
Console at some point in January
Oh for Japan anyway
But as you know
Usually these games that come out in Japan
Do make their way over here
Some other things that are coming out on the Japanese
Virtual console, Princess Tomato and
Salad Kingdom remember that game on the Nintendo
That's coming out, Kirby's Star Stacker
And Salamander and Parodius
For the MSX
Cause remember they get
They get MSX over there
Which we have yet to get
Probably because those games aren't in English
At all
At all
Although I really wish we would get the MSX games
Cause you know what that means we could get is
Guardic
That's right the game that the Guardian Legend was technically a sequel to
Dark Stacker what do you got for us?
Some stuff
We actually have
A new
Trademark from Sega
Let's Go Island
Which the theory
Is that it might be a sequel to
Let's Go Jungle
So
Who knows but basically
The way that Let's Go Jungle was
You had guns
And you shot your way through the jungle
It was
Though it's a potential though that
This is going to be one for the Wii
So it could be who knows
Also
Microsoft wants avatars
To reflect
Actual physical characteristics
They've
Put out a patent
Application for
Avatar individualized by
Physical characteristics
So they want to
Eliminate the artificial look
And make it look like someone actually
Really looks
I'm not really sure
How they're going to pull that up
But they're basically saying that
They want to have a bit more reality
In the game
And actually be able to portray people
Accurately
And that
They're basically going to be pulling like
Actual health data
And you can spend points on it
Yeah there's some controversy behind this
Because I seem to remember hearing somewhere
That this ties into
Like
Hey fatty stop playing the game basically
Like that could be the next
Development which would suck
Because people should be able to do what they want
Yeah
Well there's now
Well a pachinko game
That is
Castlevania
It's Castlevania Pachislot
And it has a story
Where you are Trevor Belmont
Challenging Dracula
And being helped by Angela
Who's a sorceress
And it actually
You can buy the soundtrack to the game too
It's pretty
Kinda
There's even a video of it
That's funny
Because you know there's a Gradius pachinko
I'm kind of surprised
This is the first Castlevania
Pachinko machine
Well there's also a Parodius one too
That I've actually
Found a playthrough
About
This is pretty neat
I would be surprised if this is the first
Because keep in mind that Konami does slot machines
Is a big business area
It's actually got pretty cool graphics
And I'm assuming it could be pachinko machines over in Japan
Because we don't really see those here
But I have seen Konami slot machines here in the US
This is actually pretty hot
Nice
Why can't they actually do a good game like this?
That's what I was thinking
That looks better than a lot of the games that have come out recently
Like Judgment?
Yeah
Let's go to the Twitter
You know Judgment would have been really good
On the Playstation 1
Let's go to the Twitter
And look at some Twitter topics tonight from you guys
The listeners, you guys have sent us a few things tonight
Let's start it off with Blue Swim wants to know
What game or franchise do you think
Will be each system's biggest selling title
In Holiday 2010
This is really hard, dude
Because a lot of these games
We don't know about yet
Because E3 is kind of when the Holiday lineups are announced
So these are really shots in the dark
I would say probably the biggest seller
Out of any of them is gonna be
I think Nintendo's gonna unveil the new Zelda
This year's E3 and that'll probably be the big one
Because Wii's got the biggest market
You know, clutch right now
Otherwise, if there's
Some type of new Call of Duty game next year
I'm sure that will take the crown too
No, because if it's the actual trend
It's gonna be not the Infinity Ward game
But it's gonna be the other one
Forget the other company
Not the Infinity Ward here
Alright, fine
But I think Zelda will also be a big one
So
I don't think it has to be necessarily
First party either
I think when we bring up these third party activisions
And so forth
And it's kind of on multiple systems
Because Modern Warfare was probably the biggest seller, right?
Yeah
This year, and that was on multiple systems
Let's see
Going to
VonToxic on Twitter says
If Tinker isn't on your news list
You should mention it
It's free on Games for Windows Live
And it has achievements
I don't know if VonToxic might have something to do with this game
But hey, I'm off for free
And yeah, that's Windows' new games on demand thing
You know, kind of like their Steam competitor type thing
Hey, Steam
Do these achievement points
Steam
Kind of blend together with my achievement points on Xbox Live
I doubt they do
Because I don't think the PC like Halo 2 had them
And I don't think they blended
Well, Grand Theft Auto 4 does
They have achievements
And
I'm not sure
I know it shows up when I play Grand Theft Auto 4
And it's kind of pathetic
Because Grand Theft Auto 4 has no protections on it
Well, it had minimal protections on it
So you could cheat really easy
And all of that stuff
Well, it looks kind of like a puzzle-y type of game
It uses this little kind of isometric
It looks like
Is this like some type of reincarnation of Devil's Dice?
Because I noticed it uses dice
In kind of an isometric playing field there
So I don't know, I'll have to download this myself
And check it out, I'm off for free
But I like some of these achievement names
Like SmackMySwitchUp
Switch1, Switch2, Switch3, Profit
So whatever that means, that's 10 achievement points right there
It's got to be more than Devil's Dice
Because I see dominoes, I see little targets
This is clearly some type of
Like a little puzzle game
Based off toys you would find in a kids room
But that's Tinkr
And I'm all for free
So I'll have to check that out for next week
Let's see
Tigerclaw sent us a list of
Xbox Live games for mobile phones
I guess that's something being looked at
Let's see
He's linking us to an article from
MTV's multiplayer blog
Saying that Microsoft wants to do more
Between Xbox Live and Windows Mobile enabled devices
Of course, anything to
Nickel and dime at the iPhone
And kind of get back at them for that
Talking about avatars on the phones
Being able to do Xbox Live
Social media
Multi-screen experiences
They're hiring what's called a principal program manager
That's going to drive the platform
And bring Xbox Live enabled games
To Windows Mobile
You know when I hear this
I kind of think about the whole
Remember the Fable pub games
That tied into Fable 2
I could see something like that happening with this
You have a mobile game that kind of enhances
An existing game
But doesn't necessarily take the place of it
If that makes sense
Yeah
And especially if they tie it into one of their big franchises
I'm sure it could be quite the big thing
Marin Marvel
A good friend of ours says
Final Fantasy 4 the after years is a fun
Bit of nostalgia
What other series would you play an after years game for?
Me?
Final Fantasy 6
I don't know, anything else you'd like to see
Like a retro sequel
Episodic nostalgic
Tickle your nostalgia bone type of game?
For Final Fantasy
Anything really, I mean Final Fantasy 4
She happened to name Final Fantasy 6
But I don't think, I think we can name anything
I'd like to see a new jet
I was thinking the same thing, Dark Soccer, Chrono Trigger
A good one
Something in that same vein
Ironically enough I don't know if it would be after years
Because Chrono Trigger was all over the map
But that would be awesome
I would like to see a new jet moto game
But that
Okay
It's old enough by now
Yeah, but I was thinking more like a story
Kind of base thing, but I guess anything works
Story based game
You know, these role playing games
That never really
Got fully realized, you know
Like an actual Xenogears sequel
A Xenos saga
Eh, not so much
Let's see
Um
I'm actually
Reading our chat room here
On Pachinko machines
I'm looking, kind of catching up on our chat room
chat.orensonstrategy.com
Very interesting perspective from AkumaJP
Because he lives over in Japan
And kind of gives us some perspective
I know we have a couple of folks that listen in Japan
I think that's great
He says Pachinko in arcade is a different store here in Tokyo
Pachinko is bad because it's gambling
And Pachinko can look good because the developer cost is different
And the limit for developers is different too
So Pachinko is mostly computers
I didn't realize they separated that in Japan
The Pachinkos and arcade machines
Were kind of in different places
I mean it makes sense
You don't have slot machines
Next to Street Fighter 4
Here in the states
But at the same time
We have like things that are practically like
Little kid gambling devices
But they give you tickets
They don't give you money, they give you tickets
And that, I mean those have taken over arcades
Sadly in the past 10 years
These arcades have kind of been dying out
Bitters I call them
You know something like
Hit the button when the wheel is in a certain spot
And this one little sliver will give you
The jackpot whereas the things around
It only give you like 4 tickets
And then you trade your tickets in for crap prizes
Like that's kind of what we have instead of Pachinko
So I don't know
Let's see also
On the Twitter
Dan Shadow asks, what do you think of Bayonetta's sexiness?
Is the one handed mode too much?
Is there really a one handed mode or is that a joke?
It's a one button mode
Oh I see
And
I don't think she's that sexy
In the game, it's more of just kicking ass
All the time and so it's so over the top
I think she's very sassy
That she uses her hair as a weapon
That's sassy
It's the glasses Rob
It's the glasses
Trust me, why do you think I'm never getting rid of mine?
I see
It's a trick
So kind of a show tip
From Spazinator
Wanting to know that
Hold on, it got cut off
I gotta reload the Twitter here
Live radio folks, sometimes things screw up
Cause we got some late tweets
And it threw everything off here
Spazinator says, here's an idea for an unofficial game
While in a story
Blurt out a random, odd
And unrelated thing to say
To see if anyone is paying attention and notices
I know you three like tangents and randomness
So here's the chance to essentially make a game of it
As if this show doesn't get derailed enough
Doesn't that kind of already happen?
Yeah, it's called the show
I know, it's kind of what the show is based on
I mean, I like where you're going with that
But that's kind of been the longest running game
On this show
So there you go
Dr. Duar says, how about suggestions
For mobile games for smartphones
Other than the iPhone, thanks
That's a tricky one for me to answer
Because I have an iPhone, I know Dark Sakura has an iPhone
We're sheep
Loki doesn't have an iPhone, but you don't really use a fancy phone, do you?
I hardly use my phone
Yeah, your phone's never even on
It's on all the time, actually
Is that new?
No, it's been on forever now
It's like for months
Oh, for months, it's not like you've done that
For years and years
Because I remember I used to call it and you'd never be there
That's okay
I mean, you actually use a home phone
I don't even have a home phone, I only have my cell phone
So
Anyhow, sadly because of that
I would feel kind of ridiculous
Giving you other game recommendations when I haven't played any of them
I will have to turn to the chat
To help us answer that one
Chat room, do you guys have any suggestions for Dr. Duar
About what games he should be playing
On a smartphone that's not an iPhone
Because I would be curious about that
Amiga777 in chat says, y'all got iPhones
I demand an OLR app
I would love that if I knew how to do it
Owning an iPhone does not make you a programmer of an iPhone
And I do want to point out there is an all games radio app
So you can listen to this
Usually on the drive over to the studio
I listen to the show before us, Bobby Blackwolf
Through the all games iPhone app
So that's the best we have right now
We do have the PSP app
I will look into how to do an iPhone app
But at the same time
I don't want to just duplicate the functionality of the all games app
I mean, that's what it's there for
If I can think of something special
That only could be brought from an OLR app
Then maybe, but
Don't really see the point otherwise
But maybe you guys have some suggestions
I'm looking in chat
I see Ionotropic says
Kuglom for Blackberry
Is the game that's being recommended there
So
Some late tweets that came in
I almost didn't read these
But since they came in here, why not
Did you know that you can unlock a next gen
Filter in Uncharted 2
It just makes everything browner
What?
I hadn't heard of that
Is that just like for a look?
It's a joke, probably saying
Because their game is so colorful and vibrant
And all the other games are kind of brown and murky
I see, I get it now
Let's see, Ray Iannami says
8 on the breaks DJ Max Technica machine
Now has the Platinum Crew online service
That's a machine I haven't touched in a while
I haven't really been to Roseville Golf Land in a while
I remember they had one of those machines
I don't even know if they still do
That's pretty broken by now
I guess there's some new songs
And some stuff that was unlocked there
Kind of cool that there's still some arcades in America
At least somewhere, even if you have to go all the way to New Jersey to play them
That will do those cool little
Unlocks and online things
So apparently there was a huge line there
Let's check that out
Alright, anyhow, let's go ahead and
Move back into some gaming news
Listless coming right up
We have just a few more stories for you guys before we get there
Yes
Including, and this is kind of neat
A brand new
Nintendo game
Now, I use the term new
Kind of
I don't know
Because this game
Looks exactly like Mega Man
In fact, I would take a wild guess and say it's probably a ROM hack
Of Mega Man
But hey, whatever
It's called Metal Kid Fortress of Peril
It plays very similar to Mega Man
It has the Mega Man type levels
Mega Man type gameplay, including the Mega Man type
Disappearing and reappearing blocks
Mega Man type boss battles
And some of the other things
Though, you do have an inventory system
Where you can add different abilities
Including a double jump, a floating feature
Different power-ups and whatnot
But what's kind of cool about it though
Is it's actually getting a cartridge release
As well
And there is a demo you can check out
That's available
I believe on the website
Retro Zone
That
You can play the demo
Of course, in your favorite
Nintendo emulator
But Retro Zone, of course, if you haven't
Looked at their website
In a while, they have wonderful things
Including reproductions of different games
Including the Nintendo World Championships
Cartridge, the Nintendo
College Tour
Cards, they even have
Ultimate Frogger, some homebrew
Glider game, and one
That didn't really make our show roll
But because it's a little late
An 8-bit X-mas cartridge
Which has a little light show that actually plays
In there as well
I heard about that, that's trippy
That's kind of a neat little Christmas decoration
Yeah, so it's kind of neat
And the game itself
I'm not sure how much it's being offered
My guess is it's going to be probably around $40
Which is a little expensive
But hey, you get a cartridge out of it
Personally
I don't know, it looks pretty hard
So that might be
Beneficial for
If you're looking for that, I guess
I don't know
It's neat
It's cool that there's a lot of love still
For the old school 8-bit games and so forth
But a ROM hack
That's a pretty bold accusation
You watch the video for it
I'll play you the video
The music's unique
But dude, you look at it
It's totally wrong
Fast forward a little ways here in the video
We have a lot of video tonight
Which is not smart for a radio show
It does look very Mega Man-y
Those are the boss battles
It's different enough
If it's a hack, it's a damn good one
I mean, maybe they...
But this inventory thing, that wouldn't have been in a Mega Man game
Well, you technically did have a kind of inventory
Yeah, but I don't know
I don't see this as much of a hack
Just as maybe Mega Man was an inspiration
And maybe even some of the
Stuff comes from it
But I don't know if I'd call it a ROM hack
It looks like a ROM hack
I guess there's only one way to tell
There's some really good ROM hacks out there
It looks cool
There's a ROM hack of Super Mario Brothers
The first one that actually looks completely different
And has a lot of new features added into it
So...
It's very possible that this is just a ROM hack
I wouldn't be surprised
Sorry, the chat wanted the video there
So I'm linking that right there
I was having a side conversation with chat
And this just popped in my memory
Because SSJ100Matt said something about PAX East
I did just want to throw that out there
I'm just waiting to make sure I can go to PAX's media
But I am planning on going
I have a couple friends who are actually going from this area
Seg, who's been on the show before
I know he's going out there
And both of us have a friend in common
In fact, the friend that introduced us
Amanda, is planning on going
So I'm going to PAX East with a girl
Yay, I'm going to have a date
So I am looking at making that happening
Sorry, cross the t's and dot the i's
Don't dot the t's or I won't be going
But as soon as I have all the details on that
I'll let you know, but I did promise I would try to make that work
And it looks like it's going to happen, yay
So
Also, in news, other news
Talking about ROM hacks
Of sorts
These are fan translations
That I guess are at various
Types of stages right now
Fatal Frame 4
This is a game that was not released over here
They're doing a fan translation of it right now
And they're talking about doing voiceovers with it
Apparently there's a fan translation that
Has translated 99% of the text
And they're going to do a patch soon
So that you can play the game, but apparently now
They're not done, they want to start on voiceovers for the game
Of course
It's going to be by fans, so don't expect it to be
A plus caliber stuff, but I don't know
It might not be the half bad either
So
I think that'll be fun to do some voiceovers in games
Sometimes though, some of them
Do a better job though
Than the pros
Yeah, that's true, that's true
Front Mission 5 is also doing a fan translation
And guess what, it's done
Front Mission was the
2005, there was the fifth game
That came out on the Playstation 2
And apparently
The Front Mission series translation project
Has taken this long
Thousands of hours, 2000 pages of dialogue
To make this game
And it is already available
And there's even a movie floating around on YouTube
Where you can actually check it out and it's been subtitled
By the group and everything, that is freaking dedication
You know, I remember
Many, many years ago when I was in college
I think the very, very first
Major fan translation project
That saw fruition was Final Fantasy V
I remember when that came out
That was a big freaking deal because it was like
Wow, somebody has
Done what, you know
Square refused to do
I remember Seiken 3, also Seiken Densetsu 3
That was probably the next big, big one that came out
I mean there were some little games in there that didn't have a lot of text
But yeah, then Seiken Densetsu 3 was a huge one
They came out after that
They even went so far as to
Translating sprites in the game
It's very interesting how far that's come though
Because you know, those are all cartridge based things
Where you hack sprites and you change
You know, some of the coding to change
The kanji letters and the American letters and so forth
Very interesting how far that's come
You're talking about a Playstation 2 game, that's videos and shit
That's hardcore
No wonder it took so long to do it
That is a labor of love
No, I agree
Something that the company should have just paid some people to do
But I guess they didn't want to
One more story from Jamie, then Listless
Right, in other news
This is for our fans of Dragon Quest
There is a slime curling game
Ooh
Basically, it's
Going to be out on Nintendo DS
And it's basically kind of like slime bowling
You know
Because it's got
Where you sort of guide it through different
You know, paths and try to land in the right place
And then you've got like a bowling mode
It looks like
It's just interesting
And what a timely release too
Because we have the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics coming up
Well yeah, this
Looks like it might have been influenced
I know you're all going to be glued to the tubes
To watch curling
Exciting stuff
That's funny
No, actually, as much crap as I give curling
It's actually kind of interesting
Maybe I'm just weird
But it's kind of neat to watch
Because sometimes those WTF sports
Are kind of
I don't know, they make for good watching
I'll shut up now
Do you think you'd play that game though, the DSi game?
No
Fine
Dark Tetsuya
In our chatroom at chat.orangetonshooter.com
Says the OLR game could be about curling
Yeah, Dark Star
Could have the broom
Why not?
Curler hater
That's what you are, you're a curler hater
I don't need curlers, I come with enough on my head
We are going to
Get our friend Bobby Blackwolf
On the program right now
Because he's going to help us with a little game tonight
So we're going to call our good buddy Bobby
Hopefully he's standing by
We're going to ring him up
He's the man who hosts the show before
Here on All Games Radio
The Bobby Blackwolf Show is live at 5 o'clock Pacific
8 o'clock Eastern
On Sunday nights right here at All Games Radio
Bobby, are you there?
I am, how are you guys doing?
Good, how are you Bobby?
I'm doing good
I didn't listen to your show before
Something they ought to know is that
You always have us on your show every week
You kind of do what you call the Daily Show
Tease, right?
Yeah, exactly
Where we get to do our little
What's Coming Up on the Colbert Rapport
Segment at the end of the Daily Show
It's kind of like a toss over there
You're always really good to us having us
On the show every week, but unfortunately
It doesn't really get to work in the reverse
Because nobody comes on after us on All Games Radio
We rarely get to have you on
We do read your comments from chat and so forth
But we're glad to have you here with us tonight
To help us with the very first list list
Of the new decade
It's very exciting
Now Bobby, for those that have never heard your show before
Since you always let us talk about
What's Coming Up on Orange Lounge Radio and so forth
Tell us a little bit about the Bobby Blackwolf Show
In case our listeners have not tuned in yet
It's me rambling
That's all you need to know
You do a really good job selling your show
No, it's basically
I go through some issues
Or things that are going on
It's me talking
And reading chatroom comments for the first
20-25 minutes and then I try to take phone calls
From people for the last 25 minutes
And then I get to talk to you guys
It's basically my take
On things that I want to talk about
In the games I'm interested in
People like listening to it
So that's why I keep on doing it
And you do this show yourself
The Bobby Blackwolf Show
So you don't have anybody to really banter with
But your listeners
And that's a tough job
I don't think people realize how difficult that is
That means you have to read chat
As you're trying to talk sometimes
That's tricky
Well, no, it's I let dead air happen
And then I edit that out of the podcast
Whenever I put them up
We don't have to tell them the secret
But your show is getting some love
There in our chatroom from Kitsune
Yes, Bobby does a very good show
If you get sick of the dick and fart jokes
On our show, Bobby's a lot more serious
I should point that out
Bobby keeps it family friendly on his show
And why would you be getting sick of the dick and fart jokes
Is what I gotta say
I'm saving them for you guys
I have no problem with them
I choose not to
For that hour
That's just fine
If you want the suitable for broadcast
Video game podcast
There's tons and tons of shows
On the All Games Network
And it's growing exponentially
So check it out at allgames.com
Anyhow, you ready to play Listless tonight?
I am
Alright, let's do the music
Oh, it's been forever since we've had the music
For Listless
Since it's been forever, I'm gonna explain real quick
How Listless works
We're gonna put out a topic
And then the four of us panelists tonight
Myself, DarkSakura, Loki, and Bobby Blackwolf
Are top three
So four times three means we'll have a list of twelve
Then comes the tricky part
We all go around the room
And we eliminate one thing from the list
That takes us down to a list of eight
Which our chat room will vote on
To come up with the definitive list
To answer this topic
And tonight's topic is
The thing I most want to happen in gaming
In 2010
This can be serious, this can be silly
This can be lol worthy, this can be
Nobel prize worthy
Whatever you want to do
It's up to you
What you guys think our listeners would want represented
Is the thing most wanted in gaming
In 2010
So Bobby, my friend, I'm gonna let you start
You're the guest tonight, we'll let you go first
What would be your number three thing
You most want to happen in 2010?
Number three thing, this is my serious answer
And you guys actually did a story on fan translations earlier
But I want to see Mother 3 localized and released here
Legitimately
Mother 3 localized and released legitimately
That's a damn good pick
That's a hell of a way to start off
I think that's something folks have been looking for for a long time
So very good
By the way, make sure you are in our chat room
chat.orangelaungeradio.com
Because it is the chatters that ultimately take that list of eight
And break it down to a list of the top three
What a way to start us off
A very serious answer there
So, Loki, we'll go to you next
What would be your number three pick?
I don't even know if this would be good
But I'm just gonna say it
I guess
Branthuff Auto 5
For Project Intel
I don't even know if that would
And is that just like
I don't even know if I want to do that
Is that just the fanboy for Grand Theft Auto
And you mixed with the
You just really want to be able to slap a hoe for real
Is that what it is?
You know, that might not be good at all
I'm just thinking about that now
That might be horrible
Do you want to quickly change it?
I want to quickly change that
Let's find something more appropriate
For Project Intel here
I think it'd be funny to see that
Milo kid become like
The actual child sim
In Project Intel
Because it'd be funny to torture that kid
So, Milo becomes sim baby?
Or what am I calling this?
Sim child
I'm so hungry
Tough, you're not real
Starve
Okay, Milo becomes sim child on Intel
Okay
Loki, did you do your homework before tonight's show?
Or are you just doing it in class?
Alright
Dark Sakura, what is your number 3 pick?
A real Silent Hill game
Ah, so you're
None of this homecoming garbage, huh?
No, and even Shattered Memories isn't really
Silent Hill, it's more like
I don't want to spoil it
I see, okay so a real
Silent Hill game says Dark Sakura
Alright, my number 3 pick
Is, funny enough, extremely
Similar to what Dark Sakura picked
But very different
My number 3 pick is also a serious pick
I want Akira Yamaoka
Now that he's left Konami
I want him to start a development studio
And announce a new survivor horror franchise
I mean, because obviously he can't do Silent Hill
If Konami still has that
But I would like to see Akira Yamaoka
Start a development studio
And announce a new survival horror franchise
Um, Loki, is that a game you'd like to see happen?
Or what?
Um
I don't know
Maybe with the creepy bunny
We need more games with the creepy bunny
Fine, more games with the creepy bunny
Alright, uh, Bobby
We now have set our number 3 picks
We're up to number 2, so what would you like to see?
Your number 2 thing you most want to see happen in gaming this year
I want to see this
And I know everybody out there
Will agree
Eye of Judgment finally sells
1 million units
They'd have to actually start manufacturing them again
But, hey, he can do anything he wants
Alright
Maybe they will have a new game this year
Or something
Where the interest in the old game
Just comes back
Like Valkyria Chronicles
Took like 6 months to catch on
So maybe this is like that
Where
It takes 6 years to catch on
It's fine
If it goes into best hits, Loki
Those best hits copies are going to count
Because it's still the same game
So Eye of Judgment is very true
Alright, so we got something
It's never going to happen because it has to sell a million copies
Well, Loki
It's what I want, that's what it's about
That's right, it's what we all want, dammit
You better get your wife starting on that
Tingle outfit, that's all I'm saying
He isn't so
Loki, fine then, what do you want as your number 2
Thing you most want to see happen this year?
President Cat
For Wii
Amen to that, President Cat localization
Finally announced for the Wii
That's something we've been bitching about for months and months
Bobby, you weren't even here when that happened
Think of the merchandise
I mean, the merchandising alone
You'd make a killing
I hope, I hope by some act of
I don't know what
Seriously, think about it
Look at like, um, like Invader Zim
Off TV, but they sell merchandise
Out the ass, it's just like
Crazy
Can I just point this out, I hope by some act of
I don't know what, we get invited
In Nintendo's press conference at E3 this year
And somehow through another act of
I don't know what, lol, haha
That is actually announced by Reggie
On stage, listen carefully
For the cackling from the audience
Because it'll be me
Losing my shit
In the audience, just so you know
Okay, Dark Sakura
If we got invited by Nintendo
To present President Cat coming to America
On stage with Reggie
I would be there with a Tingle costume on
It would never happen
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on
Hold on, stop the music, stop it
Stop it right now
Did I just hear you correctly?
Yes, because it will never happen
There is a back door to winning the Tingle bet
Apparently, I know, I'm happy about this
I know, I'm just, there is a back door now
If we get invited by Nintendo
To announce President Cat on stage
Loki will do it in a Tingle costume
What that has to do with President Cat
I don't fucking know
But this now has to happen
It will never happen
They used GPD for some of their other stuff
At previous press conferences
It could happen
I will shave my head and tan a lot
And I'll look like GPD
If that's what it takes
Okay, back to the music
Dark Sakura, your number two pick for me
Trauma, Trauma
Oh, okay, so by proxy
That's okay, it's your list, do what you want with it
Keytar Hero
With a Q?
No, it's
The keytar
The keyboard
Oh, okay, got it, got it
Yeah
And who would be the featured artist in Keytar Hero?
Elton John
Alright, fine, Keytar Hero
Alright
That's the number two thing
I would like to see happen
Actually, funny enough, it has to do with Nintendo at E3
The number two thing I would like to see happen this year
Is I want Reggie to apologize
At E3
And then for effect, punch a kid in the face
Yes
Just to show that they are not about
The kids anymore
Reggie's gonna come out on stage and say, I am sorry
That we've lost our focus
And then to prove it, he's gonna punch
A kid in the face
That's the number two thing I want to see happen this year
Wouldn't you like to see that happen, Loki?
Sure
I guess
What a weird
The face!
Yes, and actually
I'm not gonna put this on the list
But Loki could punch the child
In his tingle outfit
Hey, I would be down with it
I know you would be
Alright
So, so far, just to let you know
Where we're at in case you're just joining us
The list so far, thing we most want to see in 2010
Mother 3 localized and released
Milo becomes sim child on Natal
A real Silent Hill game
Akira Yamaoka starts his studio
Does a new horror game
Eye of Judgment sells one million copies
President Kat for the Wii
Keytar Hero
And Reggie apologizes and punches a kid in the face
Alright, so now this is it
The number one thing you want to see happen
In gaming this year
Bobby, what is it? Number one
Game companies everywhere
Realize that first person shooters
Are oversaturating the market
And begin to turn all those franchises
Into dating sims
I approve
That's a good one
I'm gonna have to shorten that
So I'm gonna put first person shooters
Turned into dating sims
But you all know what Bobby means
What would be at the top of your list
For that?
Well, some about the
Pink Spartan in Halo
Romancing her
I see, okay, so first person shooters
Turned into dating sims, I like that
Alright, number one answer
Loki, what would be your number one answer?
I don't really have anything
That I could go with
I guess
I didn't do my homework
So
They do yell things in chat
But I'm not reading chat
Holodeck
No, that's never gonna happen
Gaming gets closer and closer to the holodeck
But it's like the limit
You get close to one, but you never reach
One, that's what it is
Yeah, okay
Let's see, something I wish
Would happen
I hope
Sony has another press conference
That sparks a bunch of
Wonderful memes again
Like Ridge Racer, in fact, I hope they have
A giant enemy crab come out on stage
To announce a game for Sony
You know, the beat in on the joke
Or their next concert will be shaped like a giant enemy crab
That'd be funny
Okay, since you need to pick one thing, I'm gonna say
Sony has a giant enemy crab in their press conference
Like actually comes out on stage and presents something
In a tuxedo
I'm not writing that
But you'll just know it's there, fine
Alright, Dark Sakura
It's your turn
What's the Uno thing you most want to happen in gaming
In 2010?
Half Life 2 Episode 3
With the portal gun
About fucking time, huh
Well, it's supposed to come out anyway
But I want the portal gun in it
Alright, a somewhat serious one
Folks have been looking for this for a long time
Half Life 2 and Episode 3
Dude, they're gonna have the Borealis in it
Which is the Aperture ship
Where's my portal gun?
They should just have a mashup game
With the different Valve franchises together
Like you hit the portal gun with zombies
And you know, the Team Fortress 2 guys
Garry's Mod
That'd be awesome
But if Bobby's thing stays too
Then Half Life 2 will become a dating sim
So I'm not sure, with the portal gun
So I'm not sure how that's gonna work
But it's gonna be funny
This date sucks
Quick exit
I like where this is going
Be going
Okay, my number one thing
I have somewhat a controversial answer
But man, I would just
This would just make me so happy
Like, I would just
I would cry tears of joy
Would you pee with happiness?
Maybe, but you know, in the toilet
Cause that's dirty otherwise
I would just be so happy if this would actually happen
The number one thing I would most like to see happen
In gaming in 2010
Is X-Play gets cancelled
Thank you very much
That would be sweet
Not that bad
I was gonna say that G4 gets cancelled altogether
And replaced with a Seacrest network
But I'm just-
I have to feel sorry for X-Play
Because they were part of Tech TV at one time
And so I hate to see the last bit of good
You know, Tech TV
Die off
But
I just have to admit
I'm just done with the reviews
I'd like to see him return to
Say a out of ten
Scale instead of out of five
I give Sky's answer
Three out of five
Very nice
Bobby, I've copy pasted the list for you there
Now is the hard part
This is the part where we're gonna go around and eliminate things from the list
No hard feelings everyone
This is just a part of the process
Okay, so let me again recap
The twelve items on our list
That the chatters will soon vote on
As we reduce this to eight
Mother 3 localized and released
Milo becomes Sim Child on Atoll
A real Silent Hill game
Akira Yomoka starts the studio and does a new horror game
Eye of Judgment sells one million copies
President Kat on the Wii
Ki-tar Hero
Reggie apologizes and punches a kid in the face
First person shooters turn into dating sims
Sony has a giant enemy crab in their press conference
And X-Play gets cancelled
Bobby, unfortunately it's part of the game
One of these has to go
Which one of these is not worthy of the list?
Just because I'm not into those games
The Silent Hill thing's gotta go
The real Silent Hill game?
Yep
Alright, so sadly Bobby has said
Nah, I'm done with Silent Hill
A real Silent Hill game has been eliminated from the list
Alright
Loki, which one of these is not worthy of the list?
The Eye of Judgment sells a million copies
It's never gonna happen
Ever
Get over it already?
Ah, sorry Bobby
You know what, for what it's worth Bobby
I really like that answer, that was good
Alright, but unfortunately Loki has deemed it unworthy of the list
And therefore it is gone
Dark Sakura, which of these
Is not worthy of the list?
First person shooters turn into dating sims
Oh
Why don't we bring Bobby on the show
If we're just gonna eliminate all his answers
Because
Dating sims are
All you have to do is just go to Japan
Everything's a dating sim
Poor Bobby, I'm sorry Bobby
For what it's worth Bobby, I'm gonna leave your last one on there
Cause I liked it
The one I am gonna eliminate though
The one that I think is not worthy of the list
Milo becomes sim child on Natal
Because I don't even think Loki knew what that answer was
So that's the one I'm eliminating from the list
Just a way to torture
That virtual kid
Which actually if I think about it
I'm sure they're included in some sort of
Fable game and I'll do just the same
In that, so
Alright, here it is
The eight that the chat room does get to vote on
Remember chatters, when you vote
Damn, I should have said Peter Molyneaux jumps into a volcano
That would have been better
See, I wouldn't have eliminated that
Alright, here it is though, these are the list
As it stands
Mother 3 localized and released
Akira Yamaoka starts a studio
And does a new horror game
President Kat is on the Wii
Ki-tar hero
Reggie apologizes and punches a kid in the face
Sony has a giant enemy crab in their press conference
Half Life 2 Episode 3
Is finally released with a portal gun
And X-Play gets cancelled
To vote, send a private message to Sky
With your number one
And your number two answer
If you don't label what's one and two
I'm going to just assume the first one
Is your number one choice
So place your vote now
And we will tell you what the top two
Sorry, top three were
A little later in the show
And no, Bobby, stop telling the chatters
To add Dating Sims
That's just the way the game works
It's no longer on the list
But nothing
Bobby, thank you so much though
For playing the list tonight
I think the Mother 3 one especially
Was a good one that I completely forgot about
I am behind that too
Isn't it funny your serious answer
Was the one that gets through
Bobby, any other quick plugs for what's going on
In your life, you do another show
On Friday nights, tell us about that real quick
Before I let you go
It's called Friday Night Gaming, it's an actual video show
In the sense that we actually
Have three cameras, we do it from
An independent game store
Here in the Atlanta area and we basically
Play a game
We live on the air, we stream it out
Sometimes we'll even play it online
I think this week we're going to be doing Bayonetta
As our welcome back in 2010
It's an audio podcast
But it doesn't really work as well
Because it's very video heavy
But we do it over on Ustream for three hours on Friday nights
Fnglive.net
We also take phone calls
We have the chat room
It's basically an extension of what I do on Sundays
But a little bit more free form
And there are dick and fart jokes in it
On a Friday night, so very good
And you get a whole weekend because then on Saturday night
They do a lot of dick and fart jokes too
So you can get it all through your weekend
Excellent
Well, Bobby, thank you so much for joining us tonight
Best of luck with your shows
And we'll let you know what happens with the list
Alright, thank you
Dating sims for everyone
Alright, take care Bobby
Maybe in 2011
Alright, the one and only Bobby Blackwolf
Who hosts his own show
Right before us here on
All Games Radio
That's about going to take us to calls
And so forth, but not until
We do a very important
Segment of our show while I tally up
The listless votes
It's the part of the show where you guys
Send us emails and we pick a few
Of our favorites and read them for you guys
It's the mailbag segment
Dark Sakura
What kind of emails do we have this week?
Just one
One good one I hope
Well, we shall see if it's good
Just going to take me a moment to get it
Pulled up
That's all
It is
I'll just start from the beginning
Dear gamers and OLR crew
I'm not going to read the beginning of this
You were right about the 360
It is gaming heaven
I've never been this immersed in a game
Since Pokemon Gold on a 15 hour
Road trip with constant grinding
Level 100
The three days before I went to the store
I was constantly switching games on my PSP
Since I decided to kick the Wii out of the
Gaming cave
I was switching between GTA and Rainbow Six Vegas
And Final Fantasy 6
I finally went to the store
A local chain called Gamers
To get the used Xbox 360 Pro
With a 20 GB hard drive
I knew what I was jumping into
With the problems the system had
So I got a 2 year extended warranty
In the name of being the MLG
Like Tom T-Squared Taylor
Whatever
I picked up Halo 3
In the interest of getting some
Headbanging done
While whaling on my plastic axe
I got Guitar Hero Metallica
With some Xbox Live Points
A 1600 prepaid card
I've played Halo 3 for 15 days
And it was awesome
I've also played Guitar Hero Metallica
And gotten the easy achievements all the way first
I had to fix it for a few hours
And I'm having massive fun with this
And my TV had no lag
And was able to set it up to 1080i
And then I popped in
Bring It On and Death Note into the DVD drive
And it upscaled the DVD
To 1080i resolution
My anime has never looked so good
Thank you Microsoft for creating the Jesus Box
Now the only three things missing
To make my purchase complete
Is a wireless adapter, 12 month gold
And a headset
This is the eyes of President Cat
It's purrrfect
Peace out DS Master 26
P.S. This email is sponsored by
Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, and Demi Lovato
The hottest teen stars
I wish I'd be going out with
All three from Disney, oh by the way
Leave Miley alone and don't criticize her, she's perfect
I can't believe I just said that
I know, I'm like
Did you really just say that on air?
Bite my ass
Read the damn email
Alright, so I only like
Half heard that email because I'm
Tallying the votes, so
Are there questions for us in there or what?
I'm seeing if there's anything else in here, no
I would though
Now I need to remember what type of
Headset that we have
Because Dan has these cool
Like I could sit next to him
And not hear the Xbox at all headphones
They're amazing
They help me sleep at night
It's the best present he's ever gotten me
Well technically it's the best present he's ever
Bought in himself for me
I do have though
A little story I could throw in the interim
Sure, but let me just quickly say
Last call for listless votes
You guys have one minute to get your listless votes in
Or they will not be counted, one minute for listless votes
Very heavy participation tonight
We're gonna have a good list tonight
Well, what was going on is
Basically these
Geeks
Team Osaka, from the University of Osaka
Submitted
To the
2009 internationally genetically engineered
Machine competition
These
Engineered bacteria
That produce fluorescent proteins
And
Crotonoid pigments
To make art out of them
And they made one
Look like Mario
They were calling them
Biobricks
So uh
There's a picture of Mario
Made out of bacteria
It's bacteria
That's freaky
Genetically engineered bacteria
I'm gonna link the picture in the chat room
I make genetically engineered
Next gen
Biobricks
They're kinda murky and brown though
Stop being gross
Alright, we're gonna get to the FUs of the week in just a moment here
But I was just putting the final touches there
On tonight's listless
Ooh, damn it
Right after I get them all tallied up
One more freaking vote comes in
Damn you!
Ok, so that's uh
Live radio folks, what can you do?
That's another vote for the number one answer
So that's not really gonna change things too much
Ah
Sorry, live radio folks
We will get to the FUs in just a minute
I posted the bacteria Mario
Alright
We'll get to the listless results in just a moment
But we are first gonna get to the FUs of the week
And we actually have some angst
To inspire our FUs of the week
But before we can start ranting
We need to get our ranty music
So please, shligework, take us away
Here's something to inspire your ranting tonight
In the gaming world
It's another case of the media runs away
With some idiot
Doing something with video games
To make the media run away with games are bad
Ok?
A nine year old boy apparently stabbed to death
By a 25 year old friend
Over a game of Tony Hawk
You see, Anthony
Maldonado was visiting
His family in Harlem
And they were playing the new Playstation
And uh, the killer's name was
Alejandro Morales, the 25 year old I suppose
The boy's family left the
Nine year old in the care of Alejandro
During the night while they were playing the Tony Hawk
Game, and that's when he stabbed him in the chest
The story goes on to say
He was a friend, I can't believe this happened
Da da da, Anthony was playing on Playstation
When his friend came in and stabbed him
My grandson died over a video game
Um, I'm not so sure your grandson
Died over a video game, it's just that you left
Him under the care of a fucking lunatic
And to be fair, you may not have known
He was a fucking lunatic
That's very tragic that he ended up being a fucking lunatic
But something tells me
It really has nothing to do with video games
This guy, Alejandro
Was just kind of
A fucking lunatic
Don't say my name
Don't say my name, Alejandro
People are disgusting
Anyhow, as if that didn't make you angry enough
DarkSakura, what is your FU of the week?
Um
My FU of the week is being
Really, really freaking exhausted
For no real reason
Because, well I thought it was
Related to some of my vitamins
But, I've taken my vitamins
And I feel, you know, still tired
So I'm just extra exhausted
Yeah
Loki?
FU to KFC for leaving me
At the drive-thru window for about ten minutes
While they
Jacked off, I assume
Because, um, then the manager
The manager comes over and says, has anyone come and helped you?
I'm like, no, I've been sitting here for ten minutes
He's like, oh shit, sorry
Uh, here's your food
I'm not gonna charge you for the whole thing
Oh, well how nice
Well, except I think he did, so
Whatever
You didn't even get a free cookie for your troubles?
No, but the chicken was good
So it is forgiven
All is forgiven
Uh, I don't really have a lot of FUs this week
Just FU'd my car for being ghetto
It's so ghetto
I will have a new car soon
I have to, I really don't have a choice at this point
So I FU'd my car
You do have a choice, Rob
There's always a choice
I do, I do, but it's starting to get
There is public transportation, Rob
It's getting to borderline pathetic
I don't live in a city that has
Very good public transportation
I don't live in New York, I don't live in
DC
I live in Sacramento
That is really
About it for what we had scripted
For tonight's show
So we're going to go ahead and turn it over to
Last minute stories right after
I tell you who won the list list tonight
Here it is, as voted by you the chatters
The definitive, and this is it
There is no arguing
There is no disputing, this is the definitive list
Of what the public wants in the year 2010 in gaming
Number three
Is they want Reggie
To apologize at E3
And then punch a kid in the face
So we all know he means it
It's the only way
It's the only way, I won't believe him otherwise
Number two
And I don't want to hear any of this
Blah blah blah, but it's a child
Blah blah blah
Just trust me, there's lots of kids out there
You've wanted to punch in the face
Get a parent to sign off on it
Number two
The number two thing you most want to see happen in the year 2010
Mother three
Is localized and released
So Bobby gets the last laugh after all
He ends up on the list there
Mother three is localized and released is the number two answer
On our list tonight
And the number one thing you most want to see
Happen in the year 2010
According to our chatters
President Cat
Is finally released on the Wii
Woooo
No surprise there, and by the way
I just want to point out it wasn't even a freaking close vote
Tonight, like usually these list lists are kind of close
President Cat won in a landslide vote
I have a feeling though
The chat room might be thinking
That that means that then
We would actually announce it at E3
And Loki would wear the tingle costume
Which technically wasn't part of the answer
But I just really like that
And maybe that's what they were voting number one
Does it give you the warm fuzzies?
It does, it does, and we'll see
Hopefully this will be the year for President Cat
100 copies my ass
That's all I have to say
Only 100 copies sold, come on
Come on
Alright
So there you go
There's your definitive top three list as voted by the chatters
Bobby is still trying to dispute the dating sims thing in chat
Let it go
Let it go
Step away
Let it be
Alright now we'll do some last minute stories
And we'll open up the Skype line
1877 Game OLR
Challenge Radio
We'll get to your calls right after some last minute stories
Loki
Love the procedurally generated MMO
Is starting off with some beta testing
And that's coming to us
I guess on January 7th
Until that time I guess
Only registrants in the pay-to-play alpha test
Can log on though unfortunately
But
That's kind of neat though
The game looks interesting though
Because it's all procedurally generated
We'll get to a call, save that thought
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
It's Ray Iyanami
Hi, we're having a hard time hearing you
Make sure you're speaking loud and clear into the phone, who's this?
It's Ray Iyanami
Much better
Ray, what's on your mind buddy?
Not much
I got my Christmas money
Like last week
So I've been spending it on some games
Like Raiden 4 and
Jordan Masters Twinkle
You've been playing Raiden 4 and what?
Jordan Masters Twinkle
Basically it's a
Xbox Live Indie Game
Sport of a PC game called
Tetris meets Puzzle Fighter
Tetris meets Puzzle Fighter
Interesting, what was the name of the PC game you dropped out there for a minute there?
It's based on what?
The original PC game
is called Jordan Masters
How much
How much did it set you back?
400 Microsoft points
or 5 US dollars
Gotcha
So that's what's going on in your gaming world
You've had a chance to catch up on a lot of stuff
over the holidays?
Yeah
I also got
Admittedly
Part of the reason I wanted to get it was because
it doesn't have the stupid autocorrect feature
of the newer DJMax games
If you hit the wrong note
it'll give you credit for the note
And I was able to log
all the talks in it like within a few days
and nothing too difficult
and the charts are pretty easy
but then again this is a game
of characterless new players
so I don't hold a grudge against
Pentavision for that
Now you sent us
You tweeted us about the whole
DJMax Technica thing going on
What is kind of else's new in the
DJMax world? Like are they still supporting
that arcade game? I mean the arcade game is very different
than the home version of the game
Have you heard of any plans
to give that arcade experience at home
or what?
I haven't heard anything
and
even if there were plans to make
a Technica port for home
it would be really hard considering
the setup of the arcade game
If you were to put on DS
you would have to dump that
experience in because DS can't support
more than two fingerprints at once
Do you think
it might work on a motion control type thing?
Like maybe if it was pointing at the screen
like on the Wii or Natal or something
or is that going to just change it too much?
It'll probably change it too much
The Wii remote would be not
the type of stuff
One other thing I know you're
really into Ray is that you
like a lot of the Japanese shmups
I know you talk a lot about those
when you call in. Are there any exciting things
to look forward to in 2010?
Um
Apparently
Escalita 2
which is also a cave shooter
is getting released soon by the
also published in the cave and
ported by M2, the same people behind
the Council for the Adventure of Rebirth
which does not allow for it to get downloaded
Out of curiosity
Do you play Ikaruga this week too?
Because it seems like everybody else did but me
I don't play Ikaruga
I haven't played it before
but I haven't touched it in years now
I see. Fair enough
I think you would be intensely pissed off by it
Is there anything else?
Go ahead
I try to play it
just to survive
but then I keep hearing the robotic
where it's going, watching, watching
and now it's pissed me off
remind me how bad I am at changing the game
Mmm
It's a very frustrating game
you really have to
I think it's one of those ones that you have to have
the experience of playing it so that
you start realizing what's coming where
and then it's more just one of those technical games
Yeah, it's like more memorization
based than like many other shooters
like more memorization
based than just like scoring
not like it's just a survival art type thing
but
Well, art type I still think is
a little bit less of a challenge than
Ikaruga
Okay, speaking of art type
the art type dimensions
on 360 can
I still refuse to play it
because if I try to play it on my
arcade stick
I wouldn't be able to change the controls
since A is below X
so I don't have to push my fingers in a rather awkward
position just to be able to play
because A is to fire an exit
to use the force pod
See, with that one I really like
playing it with the
regular controller
it's actually pretty cool to me
I don't know
I forgot my
Street Fighter IV stick
I haven't played a single 360 shmup
without it besides Omega 5
It's kind of interesting how that
Street Fighter IV stick is really adaptable
to lots of different games, isn't it?
Yeah
I'm
planning on eventually
modifying it to have a
different kind of stick
instead of starting with a 360 shmup
because I heard those are
better for shmups and other
games
I just wish they'd release a better d-pad
so we don't have to spend all this money on these
fancy schmancy joysticks
but hey, you know, whatever helps bring the experience in
Even with the d-pad
get in your way
Alright, well Ray, we gotta let you go to get some more
calls, but thank you as always for the call and a
variety of topics tonight and
I hope you get all the shmups you want in 2010, okay?
Hopefully
Alright, later! Bye
1877 Game OLR
Loki, I rudely cut you off earlier, I apologize
but of course our listeners come first, I'm sorry
It's alright. Serious Sam
HD is coming to Xbox Live
this week
That was the other thing I was gonna say
Alright, well we got another call
just in time. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
Hi, this is
Spaznato. Hi Spaznato, what's on
your mind tonight, buddy?
A couple quick things
Sure
Since you just got
your 360 back
there was
one game that I
seriously recommend
that you at least give it a try
It came out
after your
virtual 360 broke
It said
Magic the Gathering
dual with the
paint walkers
Funny enough Spaznato
I had that game for one
week before my 360
went under. I did buy the full
version of that game, because you know, I used to
play Magic the Gathering back in the day
and when I say back in the day, I mean, I was
like 15, I was in high school
So if you do the math
that was like, literally half my age
So, god, Magic's been around
forever, hasn't it?
But it was really hard for me to remember
how to play, but yeah
I had a good time with it
Spaznato, were you a card game
player? Did you play Magic as a card game?
Or was this your first exposure to it?
Oh, I played
in high school
just like you
In fact, I was
a sophomore when I started playing it
and an
older classmate of mine
introduced me to the card
game and I got hooked right
away and I
played it all through high school
up until I graduated and then
once I hit college
and no one
around me played Magic the
Gathering, I kind of gave it up
But I tried to
play season one
Magic the Gathering
It was loosely based on
Magic, but it wasn't totally
faithful to the card game
But
the Xbox Live game
by comparison
is damn good
Yeah, I had an old, old version
on the PC that was released
probably around the same time I actually played the game
Maybe by the time I was a senior in high school or so forth
So it's been like 95, 96
that this was actually released
They had an old PC one that was
pretty darn good
It had its flaws
It wasn't quite as...
Gosh, in playing the 360 one
I never really realized
how many phases were in
around
It's just kind of one of those things that
when you're playing the card game
it just kind of flows
But when you're playing the 360 one, you really see
each phase go through
It's a pretty complex game
It's a pretty easy one to pick up
I happen to already have the game Spaznator
but for those that are curious to
pick it up
What's the thing you like most
about the Magic game?
Especially for someone who hasn't played the card game
What do you think makes the game
cool?
It's kind of
hard to
really pronounce words
but it's like
a combination of
getting the cards
that you need
when you need them
and then actually a little bit of know-how
and strategy
You know
You kind of like go
I can't think of anything
to nail these
I mean nail these off the top of my head
but
what I just said before
it's probably
fits the best that I can come up
with
By the way
Let me just
interject this real quick
X-Link posted this in our chat room
and this is exactly what I was looking for
It's Magic the Gathering
This is what always confused me
It was also called Duels of the Plainwalkers
It was released by Microprose in 1997
So a little later than I thought it was
I remember that you would get
a big oversized card that came
in the box that I thought was kind of funny
with the game
I totally used to use
the candelabra
to bring it into my regular deck
They had
an astral set
a set of cards that were specifically
in the game
Sorry
It was a whole little game that came out many years ago
It was still good
It was much different
Rob, that totally reminded me
of my other big thing of Geekery
I was using that same card to bring Captain Picard
into my deck
How do you do that?
It was like two combinations of cards
where you can bring any outside card
and put it in your graveyard
and then another one to recycle your graveyard
into your deck
That is crazy
So bring out Captain Picard
And what would the random card do?
Did it get stats of any sort?
Well I didn't have to cast anything
because I didn't have anything to cast
I always would say he'd rally my troops
Nice
Sorry for the bit of random and spazzinator
What else is on your mind besides magic?
Two more
quick hits
I know that you
specifically aren't really too
fortunate
I don't know about
Dark Sakura or Loki
or any of the other listeners
but I happen to notice
that over on
the PlayStation Network
store, specifically the
video site, they actually
got some sports programming
on there like
old NHL games
NBA games
NCAA football games
a little bit of everything
over there
I can't
speak
into well enough
they got the same thing over on
the Xbox Live
marketplace or not, it's been a while since
I checked out the video content over there
but if you happen to
like watching sports and there's nothing
good on regular TV
you know there's always that
I just happened to recently
buy an old
old hockey game
and
the Fiesta
Bowl from 2009
just validated
worked pretty good
you know and X-Link in chat
chimes into the sports
I have to be honest, I don't
serve the video marketplace very often because I have
Netflix and usually that kind of fills in
my video needs
but
it's interesting that
that exists
because if you saw a really awesome
play in a game or what have you
that's literally content on demand
but I don't know
it doesn't seem like that would be very
popular to watch a game and download it
long after it's been played
when you read about it on your favorite
sports or see it on ESPN the next day
but hey I guess if there's that one awesome play
or something really epic happens in the game
you can download it and watch it forever
even though it would be on YouTube too
yeah true
and you know
I'm not exactly the biggest
sports game out there
on Far From It
it's kind of weird because I'm from
a sports crazy city
but once in a great while
I do like to watch a game of
some sort and
I figure kind of like what the hell
I'll get that, there's nothing on the record
TV
it's kind of like
impulse buy
you know what if there's a buck to be made
off of the game and if they even make
$50 off the encoding and what have you
they'll probably do it
quickly what was your other thing, you said you had one other thing
and then we gotta let you go to get more calls
yeah
I had a relatively minor
bone to pick
with your number one
pick for listless
yeah, why is that?
well
Bobby said
what I was thinking
is that
X-Play
is nearly as big
a screen as not the greatest
show there ever is
or was, but
not quite as bad as
Alpha People
in fact
that's one of those
several searches I
gave me news from
I think that
is as well, but
it isn't
all bad
I might be
digging up old old stuff here
but let's not forget this is the show that thought Beatmania
was newer than Guitar Hero
I'm just, you know
sometimes the quality of the show
needs a little work, obviously
I'm picking on them because I can, but
you know
I don't know, I think the quality of gaming
television overall could be a little better
if somebody would just, would just try
alright
quickly
I ran out of cable
for like a year or so
but you know, there's one
thing I took into consideration
when I talk to people
alright, fair enough, alright Spaznator we gotta let you go
but take care, and have a good one, ok?
yep, you too
have a good one
and you know, I will give you guys that, it is the one remaining
tech TV show, but you know that in itself
is a bit of an atrocity, I mean there were so many
good tech TV shows
blah blah blah, this argument is
years old, it is what it is, it ain't coming back
this ain't the way they used to be, and that's just what we're gonna
have to deal with
1877 game OLR, username on Skype is
OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to give us a call
we'll try to get at least one more call in before we close up
shop tonight, do we have any other last minute
stories, Loki?
uh
maybe
yeah, there's new
Dragon Age Origins
download content coming out on January 5th
on PC and Xbox
360, it's gonna be coming out later in
January, on PlayStation 3
it's the return of Ostegar
let me get to the phones, hi you're on
OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
this is dsmaster26
hey dsmaster, what's on your mind?
not much, I've been still
pretty pumped about
getting a 360
probably the best
game system I've ever owned
since the PS2
run that by me again
because you're a little quiet tonight, you're mad about
getting a 360 or what?
no, no, I'm happy
about getting a 360
did you get a 360 too?
it was the email I read, Rob
oh, sorry, I was telling you
no offense, but I was
having a really hard time reading your email because
you don't really use punctuation
oh, sorry
I was kind of writing it on the quick
have you seen that Facebook group that's
called, um, there's a big difference
between Let's Eat, Grandma
and Let's Eat, Grandma
I need to join that
because I'm actually a member of like four different
grammar forums
did you see the calendar I bought?
I get it, Eat, Shoots, and Leaves
I have not
seen that, but
if anything, I've been playing a whole
lot load of Halo 3
before Reach comes out
and I'm probably going to pick up Halo 1
and 2 and 3 ODFT
possibly when that comes out
and try to
gain up on the Halo story in a sense
are there still lots
of people playing Halo 3 online?
is it still as crazy popular as like Halo 2
is still being played online like five years after
it was out
yes, and there's still people playing
Halo 2 if you can believe it
I do believe it
because some, you know, 360s are
still expensive, there's a heck of people probably
still on the original Xbox, although then again
you're paying for Xbox Live
well, well, well, whatever
and actually apparently I read an article
on Kotaku
that said it's because of Halo 2
that we have the friend cap of
100 for the 360
that's right, I've
heard this come up, I think Bobby's
discussed this on his show before, I think I've heard him talk
about it where the whole
friend cap of 100, Halo 2 is
to blame because people are still playing
that, so in order for them to break the 100 cap
they would essentially have to disable Halo 2
which I don't think anyone wants to happen anytime soon
let me ask you this
DS Master, because you're a big Halo fan
what do you think of Halo Reach
is on its way this year?
Are you excited for that?
Well, I'm not really a Halo fan, but I'm like
I wanted a really good
first person shooter on a console
and after pulling
my troops holiday party
for Boy Scouts, which we do every year
like, it was so much fun
I was just like
holy crap, I'm finally getting the hang of this
playing a console FPS
after playing
Quake Live for nearly a year or two
I think I've told this story on the show before
but the very first time I ever played Halo was at a
wedding reception and that's where I actually had
a whole lot of fun, was shooting up
the wedding party, I shit you not, that's
the first time I ever played Halo
it was a good time
and actually our longest session was probably 2 hours
49 minutes and 19 seconds
Good lord
Then quickly, if you
are into first person shooters, what do you think
about the idea of turning them all into dating sims?
Please, I mean
it's enough of a dating sim with the girl gamers
trying to hit up on the gamer guys
on Xbox 5
Well, so who says it has to be a girls
and guys thing, I mean, you can have all different types
of dating sims and so forth
No kidding, I mean, that is
true, and
clearly from shivering and what not
it's cold in Nebraska, it sucks
You need to get shot with a
hug gun, I think is what needs to happen
You need to log into Halo and somebody needs to
shoot you with a hug gun
Alright, DS Master, I gotta let you go
so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for your
call and your email and so forth, you take care, okay?
Peace out, keep the good shows rocking
Peace out, hero
We'll try, later
Alright,
that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight
Sorry those didn't get through, but remember you can send us an email
It's okay, I mean, there was only one in the email
bag tonight, and then the person got through on the phone
anyway, but we can't control it
We don't have a call screener
We can't afford one
Maybe in the future, we'll see
Anyhow, we're gonna start to close up
shop here, because believe it or not, we've been on air for about
three hours, I know it might
not feel like that on the podcast because you do a little break
in the middle of life, but it's still gonna be a long
show tonight, and a good show, good
first show of the year
Set the tone for the rest of the year, hopefully
We'll be back to do it all again next week
I do want to ask real quick though, if there's any other last minute stories
before we wrap it up tonight, I don't know if Dark Soccer or Loki
had anything else to throw out there, I know I don't
Loki's shaking his head no
I found the best book, it has nothing to do with games
Well, books are important too
I found the best book that's called
Why is Daddy in a Dress?
Answering Awkward Questions with Baby Animals
This is the best
Look, Rob
Why is Daddy in a Dress?
Okay
And here's one of the pages
How much for happy and wow
You used to hate that when you were doing massage classes
Well that's why I was laughing because
it just made me go wow
but it's cute with little kittens
There's one of like a little puppy
that said, um, are you
like, um
like, if, why does Daddy look like
the pool boy?
Um, I gotta read this comment
from Marissa and I hope she doesn't mind me
reading a private message publicly
I told her to send it to you
She said that they were just having a discussion
at her house about punctuation
Capitalization is important too
because like, for instance, you might have
you know, capitalization could change this sentence
um, help your uncle jack off the horse
you know, like, like, help him get off
the horse and so forth and you know
he's, he's, you know, old and needs assistance
getting off the horse, or if you didn't capitalize
that right, it might read as
help your uncle jack off the horse
as in
you need samples
for mating purposes
or whatever
Capitalization
and punctuation are important
I love those little kitten postcards
those are adorable
I don't want them. Alright, anyhow, uh
let's go around and get everybody's
stop giggling
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought
and wrap up the show tonight
It's another great episode of Oral R and the Cannon
Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?
Um, hopefully
I'll play Borderlands this week
Um, my final thought is
um, hopefully I'll get to play
one of the, like, 50 games
um, that I have
in my queue of games to play
uh, this week, get to spend more time
with that, but I'll probably be too busy trying to finish
Symphony of the Night and making progress in
Shadow Complex
and eventually playing Morrowind
Too many things to do
Uh, Dark Saga, your final thought tonight?
Um, yeah
Uh, that's gonna do it. Thank you guys so much
