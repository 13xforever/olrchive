Tonight, January 31st, 2010, big Nintendo franchise games could be out this year, the classic Japanese release looks to be US-bound, and Ubisoft announces a controversial new DRM.
We are live, I think.
Welcome to another week, everybody, of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that show dedicated to video gaming, video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here every week.
And also joining me tonight, say hello to the one and only, happiest bunny on the farm, or as we used to call her anyway.
The one and only, now she's an angry bunny.
No, I don't know.
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
I'm not angry.
No, she's a very pleasant bunny.
I'm not a bunny.
Contrary to rumors.
I'm not a bunny!
You're some bunny.
Alright, so, and also with us tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
Hello.
Hi, how you doing?
Doing fine.
He proved he was the Techmaster tonight, ladies and gentlemen.
Okay, where the hell do we start?
Alright, obviously we've been without a show for two weeks, and that's not the place we like to be.
You guys knew this was coming, though, because a couple weeks ago we told you guys that there was not going to be an Orange Lounge Radio because I was going to be in Seattle.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So, unfortunately, we didn't end up having a show last week, and that kills.
We really hate missing two weeks in a row because we know a lot of people, you know, well, especially the fact that we know a lot of our British listeners were, you know, making plans to tune in, so we feel really bad that that didn't happen.
But, of course, you know, computer issues are computer issues.
There's not a lot we can do about it, so it didn't happen.
So, we had to replace the old computer, essentially.
Now, the nice thing is we already had a new computer waiting for us because, you might remember a couple years ago, or you might not, the listeners all pooled together and bought us a new computer.
Wasn't that long ago.
Well, maybe it was about a year ago.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
A brand new mixing board that we just posted a picture of to our Twitter account.
And the website.
Oh, did you send it to the website too?
Yes.
Nice.
So it's also there on orangelauncher.com.
So if we do sound a little different, you can thank our new mixing board.
And supposedly our mixing board does all these effects I haven't even played with yet.
Like I think it does like equalizer effects.
Like I think if I hit that button...
I think my voice gets more bassy.
I don't know if anyone notices that, but there's like an onboard equalizer.
We just opened this out of the box tonight.
Let me turn that off.
I don't even know if that did anything at all.
But I think supposedly you can do these weird FX things too.
Like if I turn, let's see which one's me.
Turn that up.
This is all live radio.
It's all the fun.
I think if I turn that up, it actually does some type of delay effect.
I don't, it probably sounds stupid.
I don't know.
Let me turn that down.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
moving on up moving on up all right so anyway it's great to be back we're really sorry we missed the past couple weeks but i think for some of these upgrades that we've had here in studio in a way it was almost worth it i can tell you the show computer is much better than it was before so um i'm excited and they said in chat they didn't hear the fx so all right so i'll have to play with the mixing board over there i don't know i was just kind of futzing around with it
I don't know what effect this is on right now.
DarkSakura, how is your gaming week?
Gaming Week?
I didn't.
Not really.
I mean, I played Star Trek Online, but I missed the end of the beta because I wanted to see all of the Borg going in and assimilating all the people in game.
I did see the video of it.
It was pretty funny.
Because the Borg took over Earth, or the Starbase outside of Earth, so it was pretty fun.
I got Tatsunoko vs. Capcom because I decided I did not want Silent Hill Shattered Memories.
I know, me not wanting a Silent Hill, but it wasn't really a Silent Hill, I don't think.
It was like a different kind of game.
So I have Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, which makes me a happy fangirl.
I read this really about it, I think.
Dan's been playing a crap ton of Borderlands as usual.
And I finished another season of DS9.
And it has nothing to do with playing games.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
We did something.
We broke out the SNES and got our Super Metroid on.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's beautiful.
So hopefully Jamie's volume is a little better now.
Just let me know.
We'll play with things tonight as we go.
And I apologize because it's completely unprofessional, but you know what?
I don't care.
You know what?
I don't care.
You know what?
You know what?
There, that's what I say.
That's it.
I'm doing pretty good.
And then my true skill ranking as far as ranked deathmatch goes, I'm almost in the top 100.
I might be in the top 100 right now, I don't know.
But last I checked, I was like 104 or 105.
So that's pretty good out of like 50,000 people.
And then I've been playing Borderlands a lot, especially since I can...
Thank you for watching!
Yeah, and then as I was going to say, I know everybody's been bugging me about doing more videos for the YouTube channel, so finally I put the one video that I did a while back on the YouTube channel, so there's something there now, and there's a new one which I already previewed in studio at least the first three minutes of it.
I want to make it like ten minutes, but...
It's pretty funny.
A lot of these custom things that Loki always talks about on the show, you can now kind of see on the YouTube.
It's great.
Yes, it will document how I used to play Deathmatch and Grand Theft Auto, The Lost and Damned, a while back when we played with modded consoles and modded games and whatnot, our closed work games that we'd play.
but um you know it's hard to explain it so I just kind of have to show you so the first part of the video that I have done I finished this weekend um is basically showing the different weapons in the game and then the very end there's like some of the vehicles that you can use in there and then finally I'm going to get into the actual deathmatch stuff because I have like
I'm looking forward to seeing more of the YouTube's I didn't realize you'd already put one up
Yes, I did that yesterday.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That's really old.
Exactly.
I was pissed when I found that out.
But stupid me, my mistake.
Lesson learned.
Just so you know.
I got my computer the Christmas 2009 and I can run it.
Yeah, well, mine's from about 2008 because I think I bought it around August of 08.
So, you know, it's just a bummer, but lesson learned for next time.
So I might have to get a new computer later on down the line.
My gaming really didn't end there, though.
I didn't really play, but I watched God of War Collection this weekend, which included the God of War 3 demo.
God of War is kind of one of those games.
It's really weird.
I haven't played a lot of it myself, but I've watched several other people play this game.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I think the game really looks great and it's kind of one of those games I'm always sitting there going hmm I want to kind of pick this up and play it but for now I'll just watch my boyfriend play because he's having a lot of fun playing it which by the way can I just say this real quick why I'm really mad the show last week didn't happen is that he was a surprise special guest on the show last week he's really funny and knows his shit when it comes to games so I'm really disappointed it didn't work out but we're going to try to get him on a later show because I'm sure you guys are going to enjoy it
Let's see, what else have I been playing these past few weeks that is not WoW related?
Still some Xbox Live Arcade things, 1 versus 100, because I think the season's wrapping up pretty soon.
A little bit of Gyromancer, a little bit.
And Bejeweled Blitz, you know Bejeweled Blitz just got a major update on Facebook.
Now you collect coins to buy power-ups that you use.
I love PopCap, they make the best crack games in the world, it's great.
Anyhow, feel free to join our chatroom, guys, if you're listening live.
We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
We start at about 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
We got a little bit of a late start tonight because of all the issues going on with our audio board.
In fact, I may have already said this whole spiel about All Games Radio, and if I did, I apologize.
I'm really scatterbrained tonight with all the stuff going on.
But now we can kind of coast into housekeeping and tonight's news.
I did want to say real quick during housekeeping, again, there was no show on the feed for the past two weeks.
There was nothing.
So this should be the first show that shows up, episode 353 after 352, which was taped, believe it or not, on the 10th of the month.
So we have missed you guys, as I know a lot of you have missed us.
and of course we have some fancy new toys and we're going to be playing with these over the next few weeks do bear with us though during tonight's show when we have a whole new setup we're more prone to technical difficulties so just give a shout out in chat if suddenly our audio drops or something really weird happens you don't hear us dead air our live listeners we really count on you guys to help us out chat.orangeloungeradio.com
Also, since I have been so focused on trying to make sure the show is starting by 6 o'clock, I haven't been posting a lot of tweets.
But go ahead and send in your Twitter topics if you have some stuff you want us to discuss tonight.
We'll be taking those at the top of Part B tonight.
And, of course, if you don't yet have us on Twitter, it's twitter.com slash OLR.
Or we're on Facebook, too, at Orange Lounge Radio.
And as Loki mentioned a little bit ago, finally showing the YouTube some love.
And that's YouTube Orange Lounge or Orange Lounge Radio?
Orange Lounge Radio.
Orange Lounge or Orange Lounge Radio
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and apparently I think Xenoblade is a new RPG, I want to say.
And then they've got Super Mario Galaxy, which is due sometime in 2010, most likely probably around the holiday, be my guess.
And then...
Some other stuff I haven't heard of, there's a new Legend of Zelda that's to be announced, Lion Attack Heroes, which is something that they showed during E3.
Hoshino Kirby, Kirby game, that's also to be announced.
And start with 100 words, English conversation.
Most likely a game we probably won't see over here, because most of us speak English.
Maybe not that well, but we do speak it.
Um, and then Span, um, Smasher is another, uh, Wii game, which I remember, I think that was a WiiWare title.
Um, I can't remember.
And, um, looks like, uh, Kensa Kusu, also another to be announced title.
And then Last Story, uh, which is, I believe, the new Mistwalker title.
Um, all those have been announced for, you know, sometime this year or to be announced.
And then, also, there's a promo video that says the new Zelda game, the one that is kind of to be announced, may be coming this year.
In fact, apparently, something that they're thinking is going to be shown off at E3, and my guess is probably yes, because they're going to need something to get people's attention after they show Wii Relax, because everybody's going to be like, Ugh!
Don't care!
I kind of get the impression, based on a lot of this, what you're saying, that Nintendo is really trying this year to really wow us at E3, where there's been a lot of disappointment in years past.
Not just these games we've talked about so far, but some other ones we're going to talk about in a minute.
It seems like there's a lot of core franchise news coming out of Nintendo.
With the exception of, well, no, even Mario is supposed to have Galaxy 2, right?
So you've got Galaxy 2, Zelda...
Metroid, I mean, a lot of their big franchises have games this year.
Well, so far.
I mean, dates change.
We're talking about the end of 2010.
Now, I mean, this stuff could all be pushed by the time we get to it.
Is it possible, though, that Nintendo has been working on the Zelda game in secret, quote-unquote?
I mean, you know, saying there's a new Zelda game is about as obvious as, you know, it might rain today, you know?
But...
Remember E3 last year?
The Mario game came out of nowhere.
And it ended up probably being the best Wii game of the year.
I don't doubt that they're working on a new Zelda game.
And the thing is, though, is I wouldn't expect it to probably be too different than Twilight Princess was because look at Mario Galaxy.
I mean, all they're really doing is crafting new levels to go with it.
It's basically going to be the same engine all over again.
I mean, no effort there.
Wasn't there a rumor, and I want to say it was on our show roll for last week, because sadly the show didn't happen, but we had a whole script and a whole thing ready to go, and I want to say one of the things was about that supposedly the new Zelda is supposed to be kind of like Majora's Mask.
It's supposed to be a sequel to Majora's Mask.
Which would make sense, because Majora's Mask was essentially Ocarina of Time with some new frills, because it was a new game.
I just, I don't know.
A lot of the stuff they see from Nintendo, and granted, Other M looks pretty awesome, but that's being kind of developed by a third party anyways, so whatever.
I just want to see Samus' booby mechanics, because it is Team Ninja after all.
So you know she's going to have some boobie mechanics.
It's going to be awesome.
Even though she wears a steel space suit or something.
I would rather see a lot of third-party companies work with Nintendo on some new games.
If that's what it's going to take to make these games stand out and be a little different.
I think that would be pretty cool.
Can you imagine a new Mario game with them working with Sonic Team or something like that?
Like the 3D...
Suddenly Mario is blue and has spiky hair.
It's incredible.
Well, it doesn't have to be exactly Sonic, but I'm just saying something like, you know, the Sonic Adventure stuff.
I mean, just, I don't know.
Or maybe revivals of some of the dead franchises that people really want to see come back.
Like, oh, I don't know, Kid Icarus, maybe?
Just a hunch.
We need Pit.
Exactly.
Whatever happened to that rumor?
There was artwork and all this shit that came out for the game?
And then it just... What?
Well, the studio that was developing it closed, right?
It was Factor 5, right?
And they're not around?
I don't know.
This is all based on rumor.
That's why I say this with a question mark, because I'm sure it was rumored that, like, five different people were developing it, so... Yeah.
So, yeah, I mean, it'll...
I don't know.
I'm just not expecting a lot from it.
But people, I'm sure, will love it.
Because Twilight Princess was alright.
I just didn't really get into it.
But maybe I'll try it again later on.
I don't know.
I like Wind Waker, so I must have something wrong with me.
Yeah, you do.
No, I'm just kidding.
Well, I have something... No, clearly I have something wrong with me because I think Ocarina of Time is so overrated.
Like, it is not my favorite Zelda game by far.
I don't care for the Nintendo 64 Zelda games at all.
I hated the jump to 3D just because I loved Link to the Past so much.
Like, that was the next Zelda game just made me want to barf.
And I've tried...
Guys, I've tried.
And honestly... I loved Ocarina.
I know, most people do.
I admit, I'm weird.
I also think most people give too much fan wank to Chrono Trigger.
I don't think Chrono Trigger is that great.
Like, it's great.
How much of it did you play?
almost beat it, probably like three quarters of the way through.
Why don't they just take a page from Capcom?
And I've seen the endings.
I mean, we've seen how Capcom can sell these retro games, I mean, that, you know, look like they were on the NES or something.
You know, just make another, like, link, you know, a link to the past or something like that.
You don't have to go all 3D and, like, all crazy, you know,
that's what they do on the Game Boy Advance at least it was a couple years ago all those Game Boy Advance games were kind of like linked to the pasty kind of games but I didn't like them because they were on the freaking Game Boy Advance and I wanted something on my TV although you know get one of the GameCube adapters not the same thing and you know it
I'm surprised we don't see Game Boy Advance games on the Wii yet.
Like, virtual console?
I'm going to have to get out my old system so you can play this game.
Well, she may not have to.
Castlevania, Rondo of Blood, apparently has been rated by the ESRB for the Wii.
Now, this is following a couple weeks of reports that it was rated by the Australian board, it was rated by other boards.
Apparently now it has been rated T for Teen by the ESRB, which indicates that it will be headed to the Wii.
So, and by the way, you had to have a PC Engine CD device a long time ago in order to play this game.
Or, you played the PSP remake, but of course that wouldn't be the original.
But that, what was it, Akumajo Collection, or whatever it was called, had this and Symphony of the Night, but this game had been quite altered.
So, now apparently it is headed for the Wii.
What is also interesting about this, not only has this kind of been confirmed thanks to the ESRB, but
But also a representative from Hudson has said the game is coming out shortly.
But here's the other interesting thing.
Not in English.
Because it is a virtual console release.
It's just an emulation of the old game.
They did not go back and touch up any of the language.
So it's just... It is exactly what it was back in the day.
The only parts of this game that are in Japanese is... Well, even the freaking intro is in German.
and then there's dialogue that's like right in between at the beginning of the game right when you rescue people and uh when you fight Dracula and really it's it's like oh Richter it's your wife blah blah blah oh Maria blah blah blah you know whatever I've played the intro though for you haven't I
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
well um the last eBay auction I looked at for that game intact was um ending I think at about 150 for a low one okay what do you think about this now do you think that this could possibly devalue that purchase or is this a good thing because more people will get to play the game without having to have all this fancy stuff
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I'm glad that I had it because I played the crap out of it.
And keep in mind, for the longest time, that was the only way I could remotely play it.
So I'm sure there's going to be other formerly frustrated fangirls.
Ooh, that's actually a good name for a podcast.
Formerly frustrated fangirls.
Isn't that what you and Tiara's comic book show is?
No, that's Monday Comic Mania.
Oh, I see.
Are you guys on iTunes yet?
No, we were going to talk to you about that.
Okay, alright.
Call me.
Have your people call my people.
Anyway.
My people being me.
Rondo of Blood.
Sure, me.
Call Rob.
Which is what will happen if your show doesn't get listed in iTunes.
Rondo of Blood.
Anything else we should know about this game being on Virtual Console?
It's fucking fun.
I wonder how much they're going to charge us for it.
What are they charging for the other... If Neo Geo games are like $9, I think TurboGraf... Well, you can't say TurboGraf is CD.
It's a PC Engine CD, this one.
I'm going to guess, with no real basis, they're going to charge $10.
What are they already charging for the CD games elsewhere?
I couldn't tell you off the top of my head.
I don't even know if PC Engine CD has been emulated yet.
I thought they did East, didn't they?
Or Valus?
Yeah, they've done some of the CD games.
There's so much on Virtual Console now I can't even keep track of it anymore.
But yeah, you know what?
I want a lot of people to get it.
I would actually love to see people spend the money on this so that Nintendo knows that, hey, we want more.
This game, keep in mind, for a long time, this game was considered one of those pinnacles of gaming that you just could not find here.
You had to be something special to have it or have good contacts or have money.
And I think that it just goes to show that maybe patience is a virtue.
A virtual virtue.
And by the way, the next game they need to put out is Sapphire.
Some comments from our chat room.
Ray Ayanami says, thank you for not being the snobby, hur hur, I bought the original for $9,001 kind of collector, DarkSakura.
There you go.
Well, you know what, there's actually two other games that I would love to see coming on a virtual console, but one of them they would have to translate.
And what's that?
It's an RPG called Emerald Dragon.
Well, I don't see that really happening.
Yeah, I don't see it happening.
Have you seen any game on virtual console kind of go back and be tinkered with at all?
I can only think of Pokemon Snap because it saves pictures to your thing or your Wii board or whatever it's called.
Sapphire needs to come out.
I don't think they've translated a single game yet.
Saffire is a shooter.
And I think I might have done Saffire as a classic game.
I might have.
I'll have to check.
But it was one of the first with real-time 3D objects in the game.
You know, on a 16-bit system.
Nice.
So yeah, Saffire is an amazing little shooter.
And then I'd also like to see Psychic Storm.
That's the game that Dan calls I Get Pissed Off.
You're saying psychic custom But Dan says it sounds like they're saying I get pissed off
Ray Ayanami says the only game that's had any translation is Sin and Punishment and even then it was only menu text.
I did think of another one though.
Tecmo Bowl.
They went back and screwed with that because they had to take out all the stuff that was licensed originally.
Remember that?
So they have gone in and altered with ROMs but very, very rarely.
So anyhow, we will see what happens with this release.
Maybe, who knows, maybe tomorrow by the time you guys hear this podcast it could already be out.
I mean when they say shortly that could mean Monday.
So we'll see.
DarkSakura, what's up next?
Well, I was actually going to look for the, see if I had covered it, but in other news, something about Satoru Iwata, who is the Nintendo president, he's not impressed by the iPad.
Yes, the iPad happened this week.
We didn't really, I think everybody's heard.
This is the show, yes.
The iPad is coming out and everybody is, well, not everybody.
I just didn't see, did it say that it was coming with a stylus or something?
No, folks are criticizing it because it looks like a giant iPhone.
At least that's me.
I am criticizing it for that reason.
I would only want one if I could draw on it, you know?
If it was like carrying around a Cintiq.
I will say though, some of the art stuff on that did look very cool.
I could see some of the art playing looked really cool.
And I gotta say, I really like the calendar that they showed in it.
I thought the calendar seemed really robust and I could really use that, but I'm not paying $4.99 or whatever and that's not even with 3G.
I'll tell you, actually, you know what would make me buy that, Rob?
What's that?
It costs the same as a Kindle and does more.
And I can run my Kindle app on it.
I bet you the cost does come down, but you know Apple.
In a year, there'll be an iPad 2 or an iPad 2.0 or whatever.
I see myself getting one if I can actually use it for real art stuff, but I digress.
Will Loki be getting an iPad, just out of curiosity?
No.
Okay.
So much he could say, but he just keeps it classy.
I'm sorry.
Did you watch the press conference out of curiosity?
I watched the live blogging of it, and I laughed.
I'm like, wow.
So, people do realize this is just an iPod Touch, but bigger, right?
Slightly faster processor.
Whoa, a blazing fast 1 gigahertz processor!
Oh my god, that's blazing fast like years ago.
I guess for a handheld that's blazing fast.
Let's let Jamie get back to the story, but I do want to say real quick, the only thing to tick me off about it too, it doesn't multitask.
Like, come on.
What kind of computer doesn't alt-tab?
But it's so shiny and beautiful, Rob, because that's what people buy Apple products for is because they're beautiful.
It's just like my wife.
Perfect example.
We went to go get a new camera because my camera, whatever, it's... You want me to go get you a drink, Jamie?
I'm sorry.
I'll make this quick.
I have one.
It didn't... Is it strong enough?
It doesn't hold a charge anymore for whatever reason.
So what did my wife do?
I want the red camera!
She's the perfect Mac Apple product buyer right there.
I want the red one!
You are incorrect, sir.
Any good graphic artist is going to primarily go for a Mac.
Great, I hope you have a lot of art programs on the iPhone because that's the only apps it can run.
I have Photoshop.
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't think that's on the iPhone.
Yes, it is.
Well, that gives it a pretty piss-poor version then.
It's basically just for editing photos taken, but it actually has pretty good image cleaner features.
I like it.
I mean, I have real Photoshop to actually fix my photos, but back to my story, please.
Yes.
As I was saying, you know, basically, Iwata agrees with Loki.
It's a bigger, you know...
IpodTouch
and then he also doesn't really care you know about he doesn't think people just want to wear those silly looking glasses to play their video games and also he said that the next DS would not have motion sensor and there's no HD Wii he doesn't think that people would pay money for it oh Iwata
Poor special boy.
Maybe we should put him in the crayon eating camp.
I'm not ready to put him there yet because whether we like it or not, the Wii is really kicking ass when it comes to sales and so forth.
So maybe he just has the bicycle helmet?
We have to remember, Nintendo doesn't only care about the core gamer.
They care about the soccer bombs.
They're kicking ass in console sales.
Console sales, but software sales, they suck.
Except for first-party Nintendo products.
That's okay, Nintendo's giving me what I want.
I'm holding it in my hand.
Tatsunoko vs. Capcom?
Well, Capcom gave you that.
But it's on Wii.
They had to license it.
I love this too, this comment in chat, TigerClaw in our chatroom, chat.orange.com says, but guys, think about it.
You can listen to OLR on a bigger screen with the All Games app.
Yeah, that's bigger screens really going to help you with a radio app.
Think about it.
And you can't even put the thing in your pocket because it's so huge.
You can kind of put it like under your shirt.
Maybe they need to come out with a girdle with a pocket or something that you could carry your iPad under your shirt.
You know what's sad?
What?
Is that one gigahertz processor probably could go into an iPhone.
And maybe it will.
There'll be a new iPhone this year too, I'm sure.
Exactly.
And then once you bought your iPad, then the 4G version will come out and you'll have to pay... I've told you the reason I want one.
I want it instead of a Kindle because it'll do what the Kindle does plus some other crap.
And I use my Kindle app on my iPhone.
GameGuru says, remember, this is coming from the guy who's marketing a bigger DSi.
He knows his stuff.
How's the DSi XL any different from the iPad?
It's not.
It's equally retarded, okay?
Maybe he's just jealous.
Actually, I gotta say, some people that I've heard that have played with that thing really enjoy it.
They say it does make a big difference.
I don't know how, but that's just what I'm hearing.
Are they also the people that dial the big number phones, you know?
laughter
They have one of those oversized phones.
Don't hit the buttons.
I hit one button and it hits both of them.
The kind grandma has to have so she can see the numbers.
The ones that are like, you know, it looks like someone put post-its.
You could use your whole fist to hit a button.
You should have whack-a-mole phones.
That'd be awesome.
Nice.
Alright, how about some different gaming news, Loki?
Thanks for watching!
But there's basically going to be a new game, I guess a new main entry game as they would call it, which will probably have two games and then one that compiles both of them together that they'll release later on that people will buy anyways.
I didn't say when it's coming out, but sometime in 2010 it's going to be seeing a release in Japan, most likely probably holiday, because usually they'll have Pokemon games that come out around April or November.
and I believe the April one is HeartGold, except this year it's March.
So we're going to go online with this now?
I mean, I know they do, isn't there like the trading room over Wi-Fi or something, a very limited kind of online app that you were able to do in the last one?
I don't know, Pokemon to me is like... When's Pokemon just going to be an MMO already?
I mean, Nintendo is sitting on a goldmine.
A Pokemon MMO I think would be huge.
But they don't want to embrace online.
There's one of those things they get a third party to do.
Seriously.
I bet there's some MMO developers out there that would suck Nintendo's cock in order to be able to put out the Pokemon MMO and get money off of that.
I mean, that is just a goldmine waiting to happen.
But Rob, then people wouldn't buy Pokemon games.
Yeah.
That's not true.
Just because World of Warcraft is doing amazingly well, you don't think Starcraft 2 and Diablo 3 are going to sell well?
And if they wanted to put out a Warcraft 4, you don't think that would sell?
They'd still sell.
They'd still sell.
I don't know.
Azure Edge in chat says, Sky, we'd have to enter 1 million friend codes.
I don't want to fucking do that.
Good point.
I don't know.
I'm showing Rob Sapphire.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I have done Sapphire.
When?
Episode 326.
That wasn't that long ago.
After I did Starblade and before Donkey Kong Jr.
I'm just getting old.
I have bad memory.
What can I say?
Yet here I am clamoring for a Pokemon MMO.
What's wrong with me?
Anyway, how about another type of MMO of sorts?
At least this was one of the original MMOs.
And we know that MMOs just draw kids across country to their, you know, pedophile friends.
See, that's why they wouldn't do it, because you'd hear the PR newswire go out about some kid that went across country to find their friend, and it ends up being some 40-year-old dude that really likes Pokemon and touching little kids.
If Nintendo actually sat down to think about it,
there's a way to do it you could do friend codes maybe for just the people that you talk to and party with especially if you're like under a certain age but you could still at least interact in a certain capacity maybe using pre like that's how the Disney MMOs do it there's like pre phrases that are in there even the Phantasy Star games have that to some extent the already put in phrases that you would communicate with if you maybe especially if you were under a certain age
Or just an Animal Crossing MMO.
E.A.
is bringing out a new Ultima game.
But, um, don't get too excited because it's not quite what you think.
It's called Lord of Ultima, and it's a game where you build your own unique city, and you play with thousands of other players.
And, uh, yeah, it doesn't sound like it's really like a role-playing kind of game at all.
It sounds almost more like, I don't know, Civilization or something?
Which, not that Civ's a bad thing, but they kind of took the Ultima out of Ultima.
I don't know.
So, uh, yeah.
Take with it what you will.
I guess it will be hard to know until we actually get our hands on it, but this is their idea on how to revive the Ultima franchise is to give us Lord of Ultima.
That's silly.
How about just like a really kick-ass Ultima console game?
I don't know.
I guess the tricky thing about Ultima is that it really was more...
It wasn't like a Final Fantasy type of role-playing game, you know, where you hit a button to attack and all that.
Even on the NES one, dude, you had to micromanage the food that your people were eating to make sure they weren't going to die of starvation.
You had all these status effects that could happen.
Your people could die, or they could just straight up turn to ash.
And you can't revive someone who's turned to ash.
I mean, it kind of kicks up the ante a little bit.
It's a tougher game to manage, but rewarding.
You know what type of game I think would make a fun MMO?
What's that?
I was thinking about it.
Actraiser.
Where everyone plays God.
That would be a little bit confusing at some point.
I don't know.
And then you have Holy Wars and shit.
For Sky Cake.
Nice.
Okay.
Well, how about another story?
How about Borderlands?
Which is what my husband was playing this morning.
The Secret Armory of General Nox is the next download content to be coming out.
And instead of supposed to have...
Like really cool new enemies and a big new place to hang out.
And I really have to say that if it's anything like the Island of Dr. Ned, then it's going to be fun.
It's going to be pretty great.
Also, they're raising the level cap.
We don't know how much, but it's raising the level cap.
And right now it's at 50.
So maybe they'll get Legendary Mounts next.
How about instead of an add-on like the Island of Dr. Ned, we get the Island of Dr. Brain?
No.
Because that was an amazing game.
Well, that surprised me.
The Island of Dr. Ned involved a lot of brains.
I see.
It involved timed headshots that would make their... It was zombies.
You had to... I'm not going to say why you had to collect the brains, but it was pretty funny.
But you had to get headshots on all the zombies to make their brains pop out of their head, and then you would collect their brains.
Sounds pleasant.
As you turned in your brains, your first mission is brains.
Your second mission is brains.
Your third mission is brains.
The A's would keep increasing.
It was pretty funny.
And, yeah.
Let's travel around the world while Jamie goes and eats some brains.
Or maybe some of these yummy potato chips I got at Walgreens.
These pita chips, yes, thank you.
Ah, yes.
This week is kind of the calm before the storm as far as releases go.
Not a lot of good stuff coming out, unfortunately.
So, instead we- Bite your tongue.
Bite your tongue.
Why Night Chronicles is this week- Oh, that's right.
Well, I said not a lot of good stuff.
One title- Sorry, I'm joking on a paper chip.
Two titles do not a good week make.
Anyways, so, Imagine Reporter, coming out on DS.
Whoopity shit.
Star Trek Online, though, is making it out this week, both the collector's edition and the regular edition.
White Knight Chronicles on PlayStation 3 coming out.
And that wraps up the good games coming out this week.
And also Family Party 30 Great Games Winter Fun on the Wii.
The Sims 3 High End Lost Stuff.
If you want to buy more crap for your fake people.
And that would be it.
All right.
Sorry, I'm playing around in chat room because somebody said, or it was Azure Ed said, did someone say PETA chips, but spelled it P-E-T-A, like the people eating tasty animals?
And then I tried to slap him, but I accidentally slapped the wrong person in chat, so there we go.
I gave the right person a slap there in the chat room.
Anyway, hey, how about Japan and looking at the Japanese releases?
I don't know if there's any games in Japan where you can slap people yet.
We might need to let Shermie out.
Shermie's headed towards the door and wants to...
there we go, bye Shermie
It's the U.S.
version with more, I think there's more language options.
And honestly, that is really it.
I mean, there's another game on the PS2 called Momo, Tujji, Taisen, Ryoku 2, coming from Systemsoft, that looks to be some type of adventure game.
I don't know if it's just... There's little cute little animals there, and that poor girl's sitting in a cardboard box.
I don't know why, but I guess it's about a bunch of homeless chicks with big boobs.
No, they're all planes.
Did you notice that they're all planes?
Oh, they're planes.
They are.
Oh, these girls must turn into planes or something.
It's just weird.
Yeah.
Oh, the Japanese and their fetishes.
That is so strange.
Her ass is a cardboard box.
Look at that.
I'm going to link that in chat there.
She's a hobo plane.
Copy the link there.
I'm going to paste that in chat so you guys can check that out and see if it's weird to you.
All right.
So that's on the PlayStation 2.
So they are still cranking out the PS2 games over there.
And on the Sony PSP, God Eater comes out.
Well, that sounds rather pleasant on the PSP.
I don't know.
Is that local?
Is that some type of game we have here?
I think it's based off a manga.
Yeah.
Oh, it is.
It's a fighting game.
Yeah, kind of a fighting game but you can take on multiple things at once.
Pretty cool.
That's it for Japanese release dates.
How about the UK, Jamie?
Well, for the third, we have Chime on Xbox 360.
And then the fifth, we have a number of things.
We have Dante's Inferno.
We have Disgaea 2, Dark Hero Days.
Endless Ocean 2.
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, The Crystal Bearers.
MX vs. ATV Reflex.
Stalker Call of Pripyat.
Silent Hill Shattered Memories.
Please, everybody, it's not...
It's not Silent Hill as you know it.
If you like running, you'll love Silent Hill Shattered Memories.
If you like a lot of frustrating fucking trial and error, then you'll like it.
This is kind of funny.
They should have combined Walk It Out with Silent Hill Shattered Memories.
Wouldn't that be hilarious?
Last on my list is the best on the list.
Star Trek Online.
I have already been playing it.
It is tons of fun.
Although, now that the beta is over, I have to remake my fucking character.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
but if you were not if you were like looking at your ship sideways you could not turn it around adjust your camera do anything without it trying to readjust itself based on where your enemy was and it would never lock on the enemy when you were close by so it'd be like I'm trying to shoot these Borg I'm trying to shoot these whatever they are I did though I really liked the away missions those were fun
Yeah, I liked it when you were on the world as the player, but I didn't care for that.
I liked the one mission, I don't know if you did it, it was one of your emergency missions, where you have to go and talk to these miners, and you find out why they're so pissed off at their boss.
No.
But I think it was such a great thing that had diplomatic missions and little things in there, stuff that...
Starfleet Officers Starfleet Officers
and you get emergency missions sometimes on your way as you pass by other places.
Although really the first thing I'm going to freaking do as soon as my ship is up to it is go hang out at DS9 for a while.
It's in there.
It's in there.
Did you know?
No, I didn't know that.
That's great.
There's a video up of someone actually trying to go through the wormhole.
I think it was funny.
Awesome.
All right.
Well, what's up next?
Back to some gaming news.
I just totally made myself an utter geek.
I know.
You know, I want to like play Star Trek Online and then just kill all the creatures.
Do they have any diplomatic away missions where you're supposed to not kill things and then if you do, that's bad?
I think those you just are actually set to talk to them because you can't actually fire at someone who's not an enemy.
But you should totally play Klingon.
That's unfortunate.
You should totally play Klingon.
See, that's what I do in Spore, is just kill people.
Oh wait, no, I don't do that in Spore because I don't play Spore anymore.
That's right.
You should just totally play a Klingon.
Then you can call your commanding officer a coward and then kill him and take his position.
And you know what Spore has to do with this next story they have?
Well, both of them have DRM.
Ubisoft is now introducing a new online enabled DRM for their PC games.
Basically, you're going to be able to install the game on, you know,
Whatever PCs you want, you just have to be connected to the internet in order to be logged into your Ubi.com account to play the games, even if you want to just play single player games.
Sounds wonderful and all, but somehow I have a feeling that they're going to get around it just as easy as they got around the DRM on the EA games, but...
Hey, I guess that's neat and stuff that they don't limit you to how many PCs you can install your stuff onto, but some people out there don't have internet access or don't have broadband internet access.
I guess those people won't be buying those Ubisoft games.
Just hopefully they make it very clear.
But I guess this is kind of similar to some of the Steam games that they have out there now that they require that you're logged in to the internet.
But I guess that's not true for all Steam games.
I don't know.
Well, here's the question.
I mean, I understand these gaming companies have to do whatever they have to do to try and curb piracy because it's getting way out of control, especially on PC games.
It's so easy.
But there's always somebody going to play that card like, okay, well, if you require an internet connection to validate the game, what happens to the military guys overseas who don't have an internet connection and these computer games are a way that they can de-stress in downtime?
That card always gets played somehow.
Any DRM scheme has to take that stuff into consideration.
There are some people who legitimately don't have internet and are trying to legitimately play games.
Could they call an 800 number?
I don't know.
What would happen?
I think they're not going to be able to call an 800 number.
And really what it's going to come down to is any DRM scheme that you have out there, really there's no way that you're going to be able to ensure that people aren't stealing your product because...
There's always going to be a way around everything.
Whether it be some extremes I can see them going to as a physical dongle that you have to stick into your USB drive or something like that that authenticates your copy that you have and you can't play it unless that's plugged in there.
They do that with some software programs out there but it's very rare and even those can be emulated or copied and nothing's perfect.
Well, here's what Frisbee in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and just makes a very clear statement.
Frisbee says, DRM will always be cracked.
Give it up.
Agree?
Yeah.
Really, and even DLC can be cracked and always is.
So...
If it's something that's going to inconvenience somebody, whether it be requiring a disk, or you have to be online, or you have to install some sort of rootkit on your system in order for it to work, someone's going to get pissed off and try to hack it around.
Some more comments from chat, and Frisbee makes another point here.
What happens when the servers crap out?
So if these servers that authenticate the games or whatever, what happens if they die?
They're going to send out a patch and it'll probably remove the DRM from the game.
What if all the servers... Well, that's Steam's contingency plan, supposedly.
If Steam were to ever disappear, they would do that.
But that isn't the same thing that Ubisoft has necessarily said.
I don't know.
Ray Ayanami says, If I was a developer, I'd just say fuck it to DRM and just put in a finger-wagging message that says, While we thank you for your interest in this game, we would appreciate it if you'd buy a legitimate copy if possible.
You know, I have to admit, I always did like the kind of gotcha thing that some of those Super Nintendo games did.
Like, what was it?
One of those games, if you were playing, like, a hacked version, Earthbound would be way harder.
Like, if you were playing, like, a pirated copy of Earthbound, it would be way harder, and then when you get to the very last boss, it deletes your save game.
Like, that's just evil, but kind of funny in a way.
I mean, if somebody's pirating it, they can't complain at what the game did.
I mean, it might make them really pissed off so they never actually buy the game legitimately, but...
Just kind of... Most people didn't know that that kind of prevention was in there until it was too late.
Frisbee continues and says, DRM does nothing to stop piracy.
Just screws over real players.
What pirate would keep DRM in the game?
The other thing too, DRM, especially if it's not made in-house, although Oobies might be made in-house or they may be licensed.
I don't know if they're licensing it from somebody else.
But, I mean, that costs these companies money too.
So...
If it's just going to get defeated immediately, then you might as well just save the money and just not have it...
or just not have the DRM in there.
Just save whatever.
At least I'm going to save myself X amount of thousands of dollars.
D5T in chat kind of half jokes here.
Next-gen consoles will need a pin drop of your blood to start the game up.
Well, hey, don't they already have laptops now that are like fingerprints or something?
Biometric scanners.
As that technology comes down, it may be not your blood, but your fingerprint.
Who knows?
Could you imagine that?
You have to press your fingerprint in order to start a game?
Why don't they look at how console games are doing DRM and stuff like that?
Why don't they look at that and try to match something that they're doing there?
I don't know.
A decipher in chat reminds us, I think speaking of my whole little Earthbound story there, that happened with a recent release of a game.
A guy complained in the forums of a bug and it outed him as a pirate.
That was Arkham Asylum, wasn't it?
Like there was some type of trick that Batman couldn't do in the copied version and somebody went to the forums to complain about it and it's how they knew that he pirated the game.
I mean, at the same time, I kind of look at that and go, that's kind of funny.
I mean, they're within their rights to do that.
They did the same thing with Grand Theft Auto 4.
You'd have the drunk cam on all the time if you pirated the game so your camera would be shaking around like you're drunk.
But there was a patch within a week of it coming out that fixed that.
Same with the Arkham Asylum stuff.
There was a patch already fixing that problem.
within a week or so.
It's just not going to really matter.
Everybody's going to find a way around it no matter what you do.
So you might as well just give up because all you're doing is delaying the inevitable and wasting money.
Alright, well let's move on to one more story here before we get to the classic game of the week.
And this has to do with what I believe will be a highly anticipated game.
Hopefully this doesn't get pirated too much though, because this is some real A-list talent behind this.
It's the folks at Platinum Games.
Thank you for watching!
The game looks awesome.
It's called Vanquish, is the game that Loki is referring to.
Vanquish appears to be a futuristic shooter game.
I guess it takes place in San Francisco, so not that far from here.
I guess it's in the future, and well, obviously there's not a lot known about the actual game itself.
The trailer used a bunch of cutscenes and live action stuff.
Did you actually watch the whole debut on TV?
I watched the trailer, though.
What did you think?
I think it looks cool.
I'm definitely excited for it.
It looks like something that will be on next-gen consoles, not a Wii game.
But even their Wii game, Mad World, is pretty awesome.
Unfortunately, not a lot of people play mature games on the Wii, which is really sad.
Um, you know, really sweet game.
And I, you know, I think for Platinum Games, what they really should do on some of these, you know, mature titles that they put out for the Wii, just to re-release them on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, I think that'd be a great idea.
Mad World, support that sucker, you know, with high-definition graphics to, you know, the 360.
You know, it'd sell like crazy.
I mean, you could sell, you know, the motion controls in there, big deal.
Just use something with the right analog stick or something.
I don't know.
It would be pretty awesome.
But this new game looks really cool.
I'm looking forward to hearing a little bit more about it.
Yeah, because we don't even know what platform it's on.
I mean, we can assume, like Bayonetta, it'll be PS3 and 360, but we don't know that for sure yet.
And we don't know if it's going to be multiplayer.
I mean, we don't know much about that yet.
But more to come soon.
I imagine this is going to be an E3 all-star right here.
Probably.
It's going to be something you're hearing a lot about at E3.
It's called Vanquish.
So look out for that.
Obviously Bayonetta, we're huge fans of that here at OLR.
Although this is, I mean, it's still the same studio, but it's kind of, it sounds like a different branch.
So anything could happen here, but Outlook so far looks pretty good, yeah?
I think all their Platinum games have been really good.
It's just...
I don't know.
Unfortunately, mature games don't do well on the Wii.
That's too bad.
But this one's not going to be on the Wii, right?
I hope not.
I don't think that it will be.
It didn't look like it.
Based on the graphics you saw, you're thinking no, right?
No.
All right, well, let's take a trip down memory lane and some of the classics we always hear every week at Orange Lawn Trader, like take a trip...
I don't remember what I picked last time.
Do you want me to tell you or do you want to wait?
I don't have to look.
I'll look it up while you talk about this week's game.
But I fully approve of what you've picked for this week.
It's about damn time I did this one.
It's about damn time.
This week's game is Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past.
And I would love to play the music, but one of those audio difficulties I warned you about before the show was that some things are not installed, including Flash, so I can't use YouTube just yet.
Never fear, though.
I think I have some...
of the ripped files here on my drive, so I'll pull those up instead.
Sorry, Jamie.
In Japan, it was called Zelda no Densetsu Kamigami no Triforce, which was The Legend of Zelda Triforce of the Gods.
And...
This is arranged, but still.
Dark World Link turns into a bunny
Yeah, but I mean, you had all kinds of cool attacks, and you could go get the Master Sword by running through the forest, and you could swim, and just... One of the big things that got me is because it had that sort of dual world aspect to it, that you could often do things in one world that would affect the other.
Like, for example, when you're going to the ice level in the Dark World, if you would have to throw your portal...
Like, in one place, and then walk to a certain place in the light world, and then use your mirror again, and you would be inside the walls of the fortress.
So that was pretty cool.
And I really, really liked just the overall play to it.
And this is a game that I have gone back and just played a bajillion times over.
I mean, I probably have whole sections of this game completely freaking memorized.
And I was actually watching people glitching out the game today by trying to run a dash when you call the bird with the ocarina.
I think that's in the DS version.
Yeah, which reminds me, there is a DS version and, of course, the virtual console version.
But yeah, the game came out for the Super Famicom in Japan, and it was released in 1991 and in the US and Europe in 1992.
And you know what's funny?
I'll tell you another funny thing about this one, Rob.
Hey, look what I got.
I got the real music here.
Look at that.
Here, let's hear this for a minute.
I like this particular game because it's a bunch of different musics.
I'm sorry.
I just have to say for a minute.
I'm sorry, Jamie.
I know you have more to say.
There's a lot of controversy going on in chat right now.
Some people are saying, I love this game.
Some people are saying, I hate this game.
I personally, well, not that they hate it, but it's not the best in the series.
By far my favorite Zelda game they ever put out.
Great music.
Great gameplay.
This is by far my favorite Zelda game ever.
I agree.
I think that it's my favorite.
My favorite too.
Although I do really like Ocarina.
But now, actually there was a little bit more to this one.
Actually, did you know that there was a comic that came out?
It was actually published in Nintendo Power.
And they put it out in the US too.
Do you remember that, Rob?
The Zelda comic from Nintendo Power?
Very vaguely.
Here we go.
There's actually a picture from it.
If any of that looks familiar.
It's by the same guy who did the... I think who did Howard and Nestor.
Yeah, I vaguely remember it.
Well, at any rate...
There was another follow-up to Link to the Past that came out in Japan.
It was BS Zelda no Densetsu Kodai no Sekiban, which is BS The Legend of Zelda Ancient Stone Tablets or Stone Tablets of Antiquity.
That was one of the Satellaview games and you could voice broadcast using the sound link.
and it was supposed to be set around the same time as Link's Awakening but you don't use Link you play as the Heroes of Light and who they are are the Satellavie mascots who you could also see in BS Zelda No Densetsu which I had a the Satellavie one ran on like a time system and there are hacked ROMs out there where you can play with your time counter turned off um
And then there was another version of A Link to the Past that came out on Satellaview as well.
Then, of course, there was A Link to the Past and Four Swords.
There was also...
If I'm right, I think they actually reserved a lot of the sound effects for Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, so that was pretty cool.
But that is, overall, I'd have to say probably my favorite in this series.
Very worthy.
If no one's played this game, I pity you.
I pity Dafu.
Go get it on Virtual Console.
Seriously, at least.
You can actually get the cart kind of cheap, too.
Just one thing to remember is it doesn't run on a battery backup, so you have to be a little careful.
We still have our saved games.
Actually, this is one of the games now that I'll just sit and play with the Game Genie on.
Just so I can just run through the whole game.
Because, I mean, for me, what I like to do is I like to play through the game once without cheating.
And then I like to just cheat like a mofo the second time through and just enjoy the story.
But even so, I mean, this wasn't super hard.
There were really difficult parts.
This is some of my favorite music in the game right here.
I love this song.
In the early palaces.
Sorry.
No, I like that music too.
I never liked the palace music from the... This is the force music.
One of the most amazing game soundtracks ever.
I know a lot of people think Final Fantasy is where all the music's at, but this seriously... Seriously.
Zelda's got...
Just awesome music.
Well, you know the big thing, it's actually showing Baking Through the Palace.
I love the little touches in it, like if you had the places that you could fall off the cliff, you could make the guys charge you, and they would run off the ledge, or you could throw a pot at them, and they would fall off on the ledge.
You know, I thought that was great.
Or you could just throw a chicken off the ledge.
Actually, you know what one of my favorite levels in this one was, where you go to the thief's village, and you have to take the girl into the sunlight, and she turns into Blind the Thief.
That's right.
That was, and I love, this is the game that made the hookshot replace the boomerang.
Was it just me, or was the hookshot the single best item in the damn game?
That and the freaking medallions?
Maybe, I do remember the hookshot being pretty odd.
The bomb goes medallion, it sets the world on fire, it was fantastic.
But yeah, this, totally, totally, totally, totally my game.
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
A true classic in many respects.
Zelda, A Link to the Past on the Super Nintendo.
And most surprisingly, DarkSakura picked a non-Sega game this week.
I'm very proud.
Actually, I picked a non-Sega game on purpose.
By the way, Rob, I do have something that I might be able to lend you if you've still got Super Nintendo.
I don't know if I have a Super Nintendo still.
Didn't we give you the Super Nintendo?
No, it was a regular Nintendo.
Oh, okay.
In the midst of moving to is not a good time.
Plenty later.
But in a month, yeah.
We have two copies of Super Mario RPG.
Oh, sweet.
Sweet.
I need to find my copy of Super Metroid.
That's a game I really want to play again.
Maybe we have another one?
I could do the Wii console thing, but you know.
There's something about playing Super Metroid on the right system.
It's having the Super Nintendo controller.
It's having that same controller.
Rob, you need to call in sick to work and hang out with me tonight and play some Super Metroid.
I would love to if I could.
Call him dead.
Here's the great thing.
When I get my new place that's going to be by myself, I can set it all up without anybody complaining or having other things.
You could just come over.
We plug in the system.
We're good to go.
We broadcast.
We can do that kind of stuff on the fly a lot easier.
It's going to be amazing.
That's what we should do.
I'm excited.
Woohoo!
It's not more Top Trumps is it?
I know it's free on Xbox Live and Playstation 3 some of the early reviews I heard on it were very good I downloaded the free version on Playstation 3 because I think it hit that marketplace a couple days before the Xbox one you can download the pilot for free in HD so I still want to check that out maybe I'll see if the chat has anything to say about Caprica while we take a break tonight but for those of you on the podcast we'll be back in just a couple seconds with more of Orange Lounge Radio
Hello everybody out there and welcome back to another Part B here at Orange Lounge Radio.
It's episode number 353 and trying to have fun with our new mixing board and some of our audio setup.
We're still trying to get used to some things and the podcast listeners won't really hear this, but the live listeners are hearing some interesting fluctuation in our audio when we stop the recording.
So we're still trying to...
figure everything out here at OLR Studios but for the most part the feedback we're getting so far is that the soundboard sounds really good in fact I was going to get into Twitter topics a little bit here but one of the early tweets I have here is from Blue Swim on Twitter saying at OLR very nice soundboard hope you guys get to try it out tonight and yes we're here we're live so I hope he's listening
We'll get back into some Twitter topics in just a minute, but first, thought we could get into some rapid fire news here in studio.
We have a lot of news to cover tonight, so Loki, what's on deck?
Yes, lots of Capcom release dates, including Super Street Fighter 4 has been announced to be coming out in North America on April 27th.
Lost Planet 2 also now on May 18th and I don't believe it was in the article here but Monster Hunter Tri coming out April 20th as well.
They're waiting to announce that because of the classic controller pro being bundled in there.
One game, though, that is going to be not coming out soon will be No More Heroes Paradise, the kind of Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 port of the Wii title.
That was originally supposed to be coming out in Japan on February 25th.
However, now it's been pushed back, and no word yet on when it's going to be coming out.
They're looking maybe at some point in April now.
Red Seal 2 is coming out March 23rd in the US and March 26th in Europe.
That will be available both the game by itself and bundled with Wii Motion Plus.
It looks pretty awesome.
Way better than the first one.
Which is a relief.
Alright, well I got some news for you as well, including God of War 3 I was talking about a little bit during my gaming week, watching the demo get played there.
It is dated.
March 16th is the date that this game is coming out.
That's not that far away.
That's only like a month and a half, if that.
There's a lot of good games coming out in the spring.
This is a very weird year that we have so many.
I mean, usually there's a couple big games in the spring, but we have a lot.
I mean, March 16th is just a week after Final Fantasy XIII, isn't it?
Yeah.
That's a huge PS3 and 360, to be fair, title as well.
I mean, this is huge.
There's also an Ultimate Edition, by the way, of God of War 3 coming out.
There's going to be a replica Pandora's box that will have the game in it.
There's also going to be some DLC included as well as some other collectibles.
Of course, God of War 3 is a PS3 exclusive.
Heavy Rain is a controversial-ish game.
Did you hear about some of the nudity in Heavy Rain, apparently?
I've seen some of the nudity in Heavy Rain there.
It's all right.
I mean, it's just, you know...
I'm just trying to be a little bit movie-ish.
Well, if you want to see it for yourself, I don't know if you get to see nudity in the demo, but maybe you can find out what this game is all about.
That'll be on February 11th.
There will be a demo available on the PlayStation Network, both in Europe and North America.
That's February 11th, not too far from now.
Two chapters in the demo, one where you are the FBI agent Norman Jaden, and then the other one, I guess...
Some type of private investigator Also, Lost Planet 2 has a release date And some Gears of War characters apparently are going to be making a cameo in the game as well That's kind of interesting Marcus and Dom from Gears of War I'm guessing they'll be only in the 360 Call it a hunch, yeah, you're probably right
There's some new trailers, by the way, on Xbox Live.
Maybe they'll have like Nathan Drake or something like that from Uncharted or something in the PS3 one.
That'd be kind of neat.
God of War or Kratos.
That'd be kind of weird.
Alright, apparently for the live folks, our stream dropped while we were doing some of the reporting right there, I don't know why that happened, but apparently it fixed itself, I didn't have to do anything, weird, I was just reading right on through the news, apparently our stream dropped somewhere in there
Alright, just another wonderful night here at OLR.
Alright, good times.
Hopefully just a hiccup in the cable, not anything about our new software, I hope.
Anyhow, let's hope we get through the rest of the show.
DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
We'll make it through the show.
So, for more Star Trek Online news, since we did go into it just a little bit in the last part, they're actually doing a patch for launch day.
I patched it when we were starting the show.
So, for the...
Well, no wonder we're dropping.
No, I'm kidding.
I did it before we went live.
But they're already working on the first big update for the game.
They're not really saying exactly what, but there's going to be more PvP, exploration missions for the Klingons, and more ground-based fleet stuff, as in huge-ass quests.
There's going to be raids.
And also, also Rob, they're thinking about having Q and time travel.
Oh, that's kind of cool.
Yep.
How about Seven of Nine?
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
There's also Federation vs. Federation PvP, which will be kind of interesting, I guess.
Dude, I want the Mirrorverse stuff to come in.
And, you know, down the line we're supposed to be getting Cardassian and Romulan factions as well.
So I guess you have for the Federation, then you have Kapla!
You know, for the Klingons, sorry.
Anyway.
So yeah, Darwinia is our next news.
And it should be coming out on Xbox Live on February 10th.
And it's supposed to be free on February 10th, from what I understand.
And then $15, I think you have to pay for the minimum sales, I think, later on, if I'm reading this correctly.
and then another good thing is After Burner Climax will be coming to the US and actually into Europe for the spring.
It says it's going to be on Xbox Live, Arcade and PlayStation Network and it's basically going to be the full arcade port.
It's pretty cool.
Now where's my Planet Harrier?
You'll have to wait for that I guess.
Alright, let's get into some Twitter topics, although my mouth is full here.
So, I'm going to have Loki answer the first one here.
Oh, actually, here's a question.
From Blue Swim, and no theme music tonight, guys.
Sorry, I didn't queue it up.
Blue Swim says, have any of you played Mercenaries 2?
It's kind of like Grand Theft Auto meets Earth Defense Force 2017.
It's a ton of fun.
It is a very glitchy-ass game.
Yes, I've played lots of Mercenaries 2, and yeah, it's horrible.
Horribly Glitchy
TigerClaw305 on the Twitter sends us a story about a woman who loses 112 pounds.
Links us to a story here on Kotaku.
A 38-year-old British woman, apparently so big she didn't want to have sex with her husband.
You know, it's sad, but unfortunately some of those images they put out on TV about what the perfect woman looks like, quote-unquote.
It causes this to happen to some people where she wasn't even wanting to...
It didn't even feel comfortable enough to show her husband, you know what I mean?
So anyway, apparently she lost 112 pounds, all thanks to WeFit.
Her name is Laura Roberts, and she came out and said she went from 252 pounds down to 140 in a year.
And by the way, though, they do say there was a dietary part of this as well.
And I think that's always important to know when we talk about these games that help you lose weight and everything.
You're not going to magically lose weight just by playing one of these games five minutes a day.
You have to make a, I believe Jamie's used this term before on the show and I like it, a lifestyle adjustment Yes Because you have to make better choices in eating as well And you have to, you know, do the game on a somewhat regular basis for a somewhat extended period of time for this to work It just has to, it's a lot of changes, you know, I'm even wanting to get our DDR night started back again
uh the tab the news of the world apparently said she ditched the comfort eating and that added up to 4,000 calories a day well of course she lost weight yeah well and Wii Fit just helped her probably tone it as she was losing it so it didn't all kind of come out of one place you know
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You know, so she had the right idea.
You cut out the comfort eating, you realize, you know, what it is that you're doing it for.
And, you know, you can enjoy your food, that's the point.
But, you know, it is fuel first and foremost.
Alright.
Ray Ayanami on the Twitter sends us a tweet.
Death Smiles will get a US localization by Axis Games.
They're the ones that make BlazBlue.
And yes, I remember that on the list for last week, the show that didn't happen.
Did I say... I always say BlazBlue because there's no extra E. Well...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Save and play back your own replays And there's online rankings and online co-ops So this looks to be a pretty robust little shmup And it's not something on Xbox Live It's a full disc release So it looks to be pretty intense And I know Ray is a big fan of the shmups So he's probably got his eye on this one And lastly, from SSJ100Matt on Twitter Saying, although his Twitter name is Matt Osterowski And I always mispronounce his last name, sorry Courtney Love now says that Kurt Cobain would have liked Guitar Hero 5 Bitch be trippin'
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And if you go way back to when we first covered these stories, they didn't read the contract, they were signed in, and they probably had that whole thing misrepresented.
There was fault on both sides.
One side didn't read it, the other side didn't represent it accurately.
I bet you that's what it is.
There's always three sides to every story.
Your side, my side, and the truth.
So, anyhow.
Let's get back into some other gaming news.
Loki, what you got for us?
Well, I got some more information regarding the Microsoft Game Room.
This is not really a big surprise to me, but apparently your classic Xbox Live Arcade games won't work with the Game Room.
So, for example, if you bought Frogger, or even some of the Konami games that they had on there, like Time Pilot and whatnot, you will not be able to play those games in Game Room.
You will have to purchase them again.
and, um, mainly they're saying that some of those, you know, were revamped versions on, um, you know, Xbox Live.
And honestly, I think some of them weren't, but, you know, they're just...
Probably they have licensing.
The revamps, like especially when you look at some of those Konami games like Frogger and stuff, new graphics.
That's it.
Like some redone sprites that are more colors and stuff.
That's really it.
It's a little shady, but we kind of knew it was coming.
You know what I mean?
We kind of knew it was coming, that there was not going to be, or that you were going to get screwed.
You'd have to buy all these things over again.
I mean, this isn't a surprise.
It's disappointing, but whatever.
You know they're going to come out and say, you know, A, because of the redone stuff and the separate achievements and the leaderboards that are unique to the games and the fact that in Game Room you can play them on the PC if you pay a certain amount and da-da-da-da-da.
I'm sure they have reasons up the yin-yang, but just in the end, you know, you do feel a little bit disappointed.
But at the same time, did Nintendo let you download something on Virtual Console for free just because you own the cart?
No.
So, no surprise.
Yeah, but I mean, this is like the same, you know, online service.
It's just...
I don't... I've bought a lot of those earlier, because I do love classic games, and I bought a lot of... I bought, like, Russian Attack, I bought all these games I barely even were familiar with, and I'll... If I want them in Game Room, I'll probably have to buy them again, but I'm just not going to on principle.
Yeah, and I'm not going to... That's where I stand.
I'll buy some of the... Like, the Atari... Well...
I don't even know because some of those Atari games I have too but depending on what game room will give me with these classic games you know if there are things like robust leaderboards and medals and things I might consider buying some of those really really good Activision games that I would play over and over again like the original Pitfall I still love that game and would play that a lot I would
They need to fix the D-pad.
That's really what the... That's why I plan on buying everything on the computer too because it's the whole laptop and with me on the go and everything.
Fix the D-pad, Microsoft.
Come on.
That would be nice.
Make a revision to your controller.
Maybe an E3 surprise.
Who knows?
Sky, what if they were to do some sort of bundle, a discount for the XBL and Game Room at the same time?
Thanks for watching!
But I will refuse on principle.
I am not rebuying Frogger.
I'm not rebuying Joust.
I'm not rebuying anything that I already have on Xbox Live Arcade, which is quite a bit.
So Konami probably won't be buying much of your stuff unless you really dig deep.
You're going to have to put out like Time Pilot 83 and some of these things that you missed the first time.
and the other thing too about Game Room that they announced too is that it's not going to be including any T or M rated content it's going to be E10 plus only so one of the games that they're talking about no Death Race 2000 unfortunately
Thanks for watching!
Game Room is for really old games.
S, DarkSakura,
I think the games you're going to be seeing in Game Room are like 25 years or more old.
Like before the great video game crash of 84.
We'll see though.
I could be wrong.
And who knows?
Game Room's supposedly going to deliver a thousand games, although I think there's going to be certain fudging of that number.
I think they'll give us a thousand games, but that means Crystal Castle's on the Atari, Crystal Castle's in the arcade, Crystal Castle's on television, Crystal Castle...
GameGuru says games before the NES kinda sucked um no there were a lot of great games back in the day it's just by today's standards the short attention span that today's gamers have I don't think would appreciate a lot of those old games from the past like a very very simple game like Kaboom roll the paddle back and forth collect bombs that fall
Disgustingly Simple Game
Freeway Drag Race They were very one name things So it was just different Amiga777 asked Was Tempest really fun?
Yeah, it was a great shooter I think it's still really fun today Especially Tempest 2000 Tempest 2000 is the shit Anyway
Alright, let's move on.
Sorry, some other gaming news.
Trying not to focus on the past too much here.
Whoops.
Monster Hunter Frontier.
This is a new game between Capcom and Microsoft.
It's going to be coming out on the Xbox 360.
Here's the deal.
Apparently it's a port of a PC MMO.
That's right, it's an MMO coming to the 360, a Monster Hunter.
There is a little trailer that was released and Capcom put out a few details this week.
apparently the way the subscription plan will work you get what's called a Hunter Life course coupon for about 15 bucks and you get access to the game for 30 days and you get an Xbox Live Gold subscription with that for that month kind of interesting
How much is Xbox Live a month anyway?
It's like five bucks.
Is it?
Yeah.
So interesting.
I wonder if you could buy, like for those of us that bought Xbox Live for a year, what happens if you just want to buy like a few months of this game?
They'll just keep adding it to your year because you can store up to like five years worth of live.
Well, that's a little ridiculous.
And also just a forewarning, it's really hard to cancel once you've put your credit card in there to pay.
It auto-renews, by the way.
Yes, it does.
And it's a pain in the ass, and you have to call them up, and then they give you... Because I was paying for some of our other coworkers, you know, just to have their accounts going.
And now that they've left, it's kind of hard to get rid of the account, especially when I'm paying for it.
Alright, reading some comments from chat.
There's still some comments from the last story going on here about Game Room.
VidPower says, That's awesome.
Oh man, that would be so much fun to just whip out the Atari 2600 and play that for a few hours.
GameGuru says,
I think there's still some good ones out there Salacious Pop in chat says when the 2600 came out people were OMGing that they could alter what happened on their TV screen they moved the paddle and the dot moved very true, why do you think those pong they had machines that were only pong it was pong for your TV and that was it
That was like before the Odyssey, which was before the 2600.
And those things still sold because, exactly right, people were oohing and aahing because they controlled what was on the screen.
And that was really a first.
Think about it.
Television before that, you don't control what's on the screen besides changing the channel, which doesn't really count.
So, anyhow.
Sorry for the tangent there, but those were some good comments around the room from chat.
What's the show if there's no tangent?
What is the show without a tangent?
How about Doctor Who?
Speaking of tangents...
BBC is pretty interested in doing video games after the Doctor Who relaunch.
They want to do ones that are complementary to each other instead of competition.
So I guess it's going to be episodic.
That's how I would translate that.
Or have things that go from one to the other like transferable content.
Um, but they're saying that their ideas involve, quote, boxed product console games, virtual worlds, and other experiences.
So who knows, maybe we'll get a Doctor Who MMO.
But all the Time Lords are dead!
Random question out of the blue, wasn't there like a Doctor Who game on the DS that was kind of eh?
It was Top Chumps.
Top Chumps is like playing war with cards, only you pick a stat, and then the other person picks a stat, and whichever stat wins, you take that card.
So you play kind of for ante, but not...
Interesting.
So it wasn't a very robust kind of game.
It was a fun way to pass time.
I'm hearing this story and I'm thinking, well, there was a Doctor Who game, but it sounds like it wasn't very Doctor Who-y.
Well, our buddy Rob overseas sent me my copy.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
I seem to remember you got a copy of it from an overseas listener and were playing it.
No, don't get me wrong.
I liked it.
It was pretty fun.
Even though it had Martha all over it and I don't like Martha.
But Season 3 Doctor Who just was really weak to me.
But...
It was a fun game.
It wasn't super engaging is what I'm saying.
It's not depth of story or anything that adds to the Hooniverse.
Decipher in chat says, An MMO would suck.
Everyone's a Time Lord.
Time traveling would be hectic.
And SSJ100Matt wins the chat by saying, President Cat is a Time Lord.
President Cat is a Time Lord.
Actually, that would be the sequel to President Cat.
That would be the sequel to President Cat.
Time Lord Cat.
Or Lord Cat.
Instead of President Cat, Queen Cat or something.
I forget it.
and for the record to tell our dear friend Brad from PodCulture in the chat room Martha was so she didn't get good until she was off of the show I'll put it that way as a character she didn't get good until she was off of the show
She was this silly little girl with a crush and yeah, she's smart.
She really couldn't think her way out of the paper bag when it came to common sense.
Sorry.
But it's all about Donna.
Loud, obnoxious, and smarter than she thinks.
And I'm not going to go into the whole Rose Doctor fandom.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
She took on a little bit too many of the... Not to say that she was a bad character.
I loved her.
She was very well fleshed out.
She and the Doctor were believable together.
But there were certain elements that just seemed like, okay, we're doing this for the fans.
But even so, Rose was still amazing, but I still think that Donna... Well, my favorite of all the companions is Sarah Jane, to this day.
Even back to her old episodes, including the badly written Ark in Space with the bubble wrap larva creatures.
They made the creatures out of green bubble wrap.
Low budget.
Doctor Who?
No, it's what little I've seen of it I've liked.
I just haven't committed the time to sit down and watch more episodes.
Donna is fantastic, amazing, especially as Dr. Donna.
Alright, back to video games, Loki.
So, you may remember we talked about this a few weeks ago, that Datel was pissed off at Microsoft for locking out their third-party memory cards, which kind of sucks, because Microsoft memory cards are only like half a meg, or not even half a meg, half a gig, and they're like $49.99.
For that price, you might as well just buy a hard drive, because it's going to cost you about $50 more, but you get...
You know, like 40 times the space.
Anyways, so now Microsoft has registered a motion to dismiss the antitrust lawsuit, which was filed by Datel.
And basically they're citing that other rivals, like Apple, for example...
Have a lockout on different things for their systems.
For example, you can't run OSX on computers not made by Apple.
So why should you be able to use non-Microsoft memory cards on your Xbox?
I think that's a little different, but whatever.
They're also claiming, though, that they don't want to undermine the quality of the user experience on Xbox Live by allowing Datel to release cheat-enabling memory cards.
But from what I remember, I don't think the memory cards that they had were cheat enabling.
It was basically just allowing you to run more space or, you know, have more space on there.
Like instead of having a half a gig memory card, you have an eight gig memory card, which is way cheaper.
So I don't know if it's really the same thing.
But yeah, I can understand where Datel, you know, they do release a lot of their cheat devices and stuff for different consoles.
I don't think it's fair.
It's an interesting comparison, but what do you think is ultimately going to happen?
Do you think Microsoft's got a point, or do you think Datel's going to win?
I don't think Datel's going to win.
Because I think it's their system, but then again, they may...
I think that they should allow them to maybe manufacture third-party hard drives or something like that because as far as their storage goes, they're really limited on what they allow other vendors to do.
It's basically just either wired controllers or...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
I don't know alright I'm surprised Datel didn't find a way to kind of hack those things but I guess it's not possible with hardware they tried I think but yeah it's kind of hard to do that with a memory card but can you imagine though if you could make a memory card the size of one of those hard drives that'd be awesome
Alright, let's move on to some other news involving Microsoft, and it is the indie games.
Indie games, some of the sales figures for 2009 were released, and the best-selling game, Xbox Live Indie Game, was I Made a Game with Zombies in It, with all the leet-speak in the title, was the best-selling indie game last year.
Apparently, it sold 160,000 units at $1 each.
Rumble Massage was the sixth best-selling game.
Avatar Drop sold $117,000 with $433,000 doing a trial.
Number 15, The Impossible Game moved 31,000 copies.
So that's at number 15.
Aquarium HD was number 10.
24,000 copies, 172,000 trials.
Interesting.
Sorry guys, Snake 360 is nowhere to be found.
Is Miner Dig Deep on there?
No.
I'm surprised.
Neither is Revenge of the Ball.
Oh no, Miner Dig Deep is there.
Sorry, number 5.
It just doesn't have actual figures.
That's a pretty good game.
It's addictive.
There you go.
If you haven't checked out any games, go download a handful.
There's some good stuff.
I think they really under-advertise it.
I mean, there's a ton of stuff on there.
And it's really hard to sort through it because of the new interface, which was supposed to be a good thing, and I don't like it.
So, anyhow.
I think this is the part of the show where we're going to get into some emails, although I don't know if we really have a lot of emails.
I think I heard there was one left over from last week that never got read.
I had, remember I had to delete all the spam and I think I got rid of some of them.
Whoops.
So if someone sent us email, just resend it to me and I'll redo it.
Alright, so we don't have email this week?
Yet.
Wow.
Well, I'll play the music and then end it because we have no emails.
So send us your emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
Obviously, if you send them tonight, you're too late.
But do give us some emails for next week.
We'll be happy to take your questions.
And hopefully after the oopsies and whoops of the past couple weeks, we can get back on track with some more listener interaction.
So maybe the lack of emails due to spammers necessitates an F you.
F the spammers.
I hate spammers.
They hit our website too.
But I've gotten creative.
Like they keep spamming this thing on the forum about how to turn sub video on your iPod, all this crap.
What I did is I put in a custom filter that turns the name of the program into this program fucking sucks.
So every time they put a spam post, it just puts a link to this program fucking sucks.
And I'm going to continue to do that for all the programs that they spam on the board.
Because it's funny.
Even if it doesn't get them to stop, it's really funny that they're taking all this effort to announce to the world that their program fucking sucks.
And they always use names like, I'm a stupid spammer.
Oh yeah, I did that too.
Sorry.
I put in custom filters that say, punch me, I'm a stupid spammer.
I know they were doing that.
I was like, why would you do that?
That's stupid.
See, but it's funny that people are thinking that.
If you can't beat them,
Fuck with them.
You should just change all the words that they use, like hot dog and stuff.
Just make it weird.
Well, I can't change iPod because maybe people on the OLR forums want to have a legitimate discussion about iPod.
Shut up.
But this particular company, ain't no one give a shit about them, so I'm just going to change it to... I think the language is how to convert video.
If you use those words just like that, it changes to punch me, I'm a fucking spammer or something like that.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
DarkSakura when it starts off tonight.
Um... I... Being busy.
F you for being busy.
That's about it.
I'm like...
God damn it, just have a button where I click it and it... Okay, look, Windows Media File, done.
Select the resolution, done.
I have a program that converts different video files for use with my PlayStation 3.
So...
That one, they either have the uber, okay, adjust all the settings type stuff, or you can just do the stupid simple, I want it to look good.
I want it to have good sound.
You just select good, very good, excellent, that type of stuff.
So why they can't do that is beyond me.
I have to actually create my own custom settings and save that profile so that I actually have one that works.
Really frustrated.
And I know auditions the same way because it's hard.
Photoshop.
Good.
Did you say Photoshop sucked earlier in the show?
No, I said Photoshop's good.
I said Photoshop on the iPhone probably sucked.
Okay, sorry.
Let's see, my FU of the week goes to... Actually, you know, a lot of things are going very well for me, so I can't complain, but just FU to that chaos feeling and uncertainty.
You know things are changing, but you don't know how they're changing.
and just the whole process of moving I hate packing and having to throw away things I don't need and the fact that I'm having to downsize from a house to an apartment again sucks but I'll get through it, I always do alright, couple more stories for you guys and then the Skype line and hopefully very few audio problems tonight but we'll see what happens Loki, what you got for us?
let's see what we've got it's funny the last story it's actually a new game coming to the Nintendo Wii it's from Mistwalker and apparently the other game that we talked about this earlier this is on that list of titles that were to be announced and what not Xenoblade was the other one that's actually a game coming from the company let's see here
Oh, it's actually the localized name for Monado Beginning of the World, which is an RPG from Monolith Soft.
And then, of course, the last story is an RPG game being developed by Mistwalker.
And they didn't really say what it is, but it's a new form of RPG, they're calling it.
So, whatever the hell that's supposed to mean.
Um...
and yeah and then the other thing of course Metroid Other M you know it's supposed to be coming out summer 2010 in Japan and what do all these have in common all of them have teaser sites now on Nintendo's Japanese website so you can go check those out as well so that's kind of neat so obviously they're coming relatively soon if they have their own teaser site all right there's been a lot of Nintendo news tonight
It's all kind of tying in together.
I guess so.
I don't know.
I think Nintendo's trying to put the cards together to really try to wow us again at E3 this year.
But on their hardware, I don't know.
But Mistwalker had some pretty good RPGs, at least Lost Odyssey.
Blue Dragon was kind of...
Ehh, for me.
I mean, it wasn't great, but I know Jamie really enjoyed it, so I guess they got some people with it.
Anyhow, I have one more story for you guys, and then we're going to open up the Skype line.
This has to do with Steam and some of the growth that Steam had in the year 2009.
Apparently, 25 million users now on Steam.
That's a 205% jump.
Over the year and year sales, and I wonder if this takes into account some of the Christmas sales, because they were having some obscene sales at the end of the year there.
And Valve put out a press release earlier in the week just talking about how great their 2009 was.
More than 25% new accounts, meaning they're up to $25 million.
10 million of those actually using profiles on Steam over a thousand games available on the service 100 different developers just crazy 5 years I guess the service is being used now they hit their peak in December 2.5 million concurrent users probably thanks to Modern Warfare 2 and Left 4 Dead 2 monthly average player minutes 13 billion so those saying the digital distribution didn't have a chance yeah
Steam's proving a lot of those wrong and I think again it's a lot of those just obscene sales that they have on Steam that really kind of pushes that up to the top and the fact that Valve's you know pretty respectable name in gaming you know the Half-Life games of course and you know Portal and Team Fortress and all that and all this that good stuff that was in the orange box you know and the fact that that software came with those games which were big PC games so
I would be curious, though.
I know this isn't going to really involve digital distribution on a wide scale, but I'm curious how the new Blizzard net software is going to, I don't want to say necessarily compete with Steam, but kind of like put a chunk in that whole concurrent users and stuff.
Because, you know, let's face it, I realize Steam might have 100 different developers, but Blizzard is like, they're like...
Kings of PC development between WoW, Diablo, StarCraft.
It's kind of hard to ignore the fact that Blizzard is a behemoth, and it's going to be interesting to see... They're a three-trick pony.
Well, apparently they're working on a new IP that we don't know about yet.
Four-trick pony.
But it's going to be interesting to see what happens.
Well, has Blizzard made a bad game?
Yes.
Chirp, chirp.
Maybe the Viking game, but even that was kind of neat.
So...
I don't know, we'll see I think in the end they're not really competition because I don't see Blizzard really selling all these different types of games but BlizzardNet, they already digitally distribute their own games and that's not to be ignored that's a huge chunk of PC market right there
Azam says, and digital distribution is tax-free as no physical material is exchanging hands to boot.
Crazy.
I don't know if you guys have done your taxes, though, but you know on the tax thing you're supposed to report anything you bought that was out of state?
Yeah, I don't think so.
Prove they bought it out of state.
I would you know I think if maybe I bought a car out of state or like major purchases I'd probably report those because you know that's the ethical thing to do and I don't want to get caught but like 20 bucks on a game I can't keep track of that throughout the year come on if you want to charge me taxes on it you need to do it at the point of sale like some other states do so all right
And by the way, some folks in chat saying Lost Vikings is good.
Rock and Roll Racing for the SNES was by Blizzard.
That was from VidPower and GameGuru.
And Rob D says, hey, if that was the only one that wasn't a good game, Blizzard's in good shape.
I agree.
There you go.
All right, you guys ready to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Use the name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio.
Again, I don't know how this is going to work tonight.
I'm hoping the audio problems are okay and we don't have a lot of them.
Our phone call with Bobby went okay, so hopefully Skype goes okay too.
We have a call on the line.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hi, this is Ray Ayanami.
Hi, Ray.
How are you doing?
I'm all right.
What's on your mind tonight?
I've been meaning to call about this for a few weeks now, but haven't been able to because I missed episodes.
We had some drama.
What's up?
Um, DJMAX Technica Platinum Crew Service is finally online, like, internationally, not just in a few countries.
That's right, because you can download it now on the PSN, right?
Uh, no, I'm talking about the server, the online service for arcade DJMAX Technica machines.
Oh, oh, oh, okay, okay, gotcha, yeah.
So, for those who haven't heard of it, it's kind of like Konami's EMU system, only it actually happened outside of Japan.
And what you can do is go to the special mode where you can do these missions to unlock new charts and songs.
There's also some special super hard charts you can try, as well as some courses you can do where you try to compete for the best score.
And then when you go online on your PC or your iPhone or whatever, you can check your scores and whatnot.
Is this really taking off in arcades, though?
Because, you know, it would seem like this is kind of an expensive thing for arcades to set up.
Are they actually kind of welcoming of this?
So far, I think so.
Like, the first week I was there, like, there were pretty huge lines for the Technica machine, like, at Sunnyvale Golf Line, like, as many as 10 to 15 people, which isn't really a mine.
I can understand, like, the excitement for it and such.
It's kind of sad how arcades outside Japan are doing.
I mean...
I believe a number of factors on this, like for example, arcades not maintaining their machines or American arcade developers not taking the arcade scene seriously, like choosing to make novelty games rather than games that you can play for quite a while.
Like, Raw Thrills, for example, a lot of their games are the kind of games that you would play just for novelty a few times, not really take seriously.
Well, speaking of this whole DJ Max thing, because I referenced this a minute ago, but now it's available on PlayStation Network to download right to your PSP.
What do you think?
That would be DJ Max fever, and I've heard they fixed a few things, but I'm still not getting it because there's one annoying feature that they didn't take out that would have made me buy it, and that's the author-correct feature.
Hmm.
I'm looking in chat, SSJ100Man on our chat says they had this whole system set up at 8 on the break That's that popular arcade in Jersey and it was an hour wait to play Yeah, that sounds like Swiggle too Wow, I should check and see if the Roseville Golf Land here got it I don't even know, I haven't been there in six months, kind of too bad Well, alright, Ray, is there anything else you want to ask us about tonight?
Eh, not the moment.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Speaking of which, I actually bought some stuff to upgrade my arcade cabinet at home.
I bought a new GeForce graphics card because before I had what they call an arcade VGA card.
It's basically a hacked ATI card that's pretty old with some different drivers and stuff.
But you can do the same 15-kilogram drivers to output to the arcade monitor with a software program.
You can run any card with that.
So now I can run, you know, hopefully since BlazBlue's continuum shift leaked to the internet, I'm going to run that on my cabinet too.
Clearly we have a caller on the line.
Hi, who's there?
Hi, Legend of Zaku.
Hi, Zaku.
How are you doing?
Yeah, I just want to say congratulations on the new year.
I managed to make a good, almost like what, almost like eight years in running so far.
Yeah, we're now into, we've now spanned two decades, this show.
Yeah, we started, what was the first show, 2002?
June 23rd of 02, right?
Wow, you're close.
You're close to an eight year anniversary show.
Don't remind me.
Well, what's on your mind?
Ah, nothing much.
Just wanted to... Let me see.
The truth of the matter is, you heard about the iPad, right?
And how some of them are just like... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
What's an iPad?
No, I'm kidding.
I'm sorry.
Yes, we heard about the iPad.
I mean, the way I see it right now, I don't know why they had to make the iPod Touch or iPhone much bigger.
I guess it's because Apple's trying to...
I don't know.
Some of them were just saying the other day that it might actually be a game for Sony.
I actually picked this one up on Kotaku earlier today.
Where the iPad itself would actually increase Do you type with your fists?
Like, the clacking of the keys is so loud It's my Mac, alright Oh, okay, that explains it My MacBook, alright Nevermind, okay, that explains it Is it just me?
It sounds like he's beating the keyboard with his fists But it's like typing Because these are the chiclet keys They look exactly like that, but Let me see Yeah, Sony's pleased as much with Apple's iPad
something along that lines let's see you see Nintendo basically you know basically panning the iPad I don't know when you joined the show we covered that in part A towards the top of the show yeah we talked about Iwata basically saying what the rest of us were thinking that the iPad is basically several eye touches glued together well it's basically the point where Steve Jobs literally jumped the shark and just trying to go after trying to go after everything when he's not you know
I mean, I can understand that the iPhone and the iPod Touch managed to build itself up to a gaming platform, even though it was never its true intention.
Well, here's the thing.
The iPad only needed a couple of really great things, and I think very clearly distinguishable things from the iPhone.
that would have made people jump all over it.
And I think one of them is if they put a camera in the front of it so you could video conference from anywhere, I think a lot of people would have ate that shit up right away.
I think that would have been amazing.
And I think the other thing is multitasking.
I mean, they go out and say, yippee, skippy, we've got a gigahertz processor in here, but you can't really surf the web.
That was a disappointment.
The only thing it is is just a...
An oversized iPhone.
Minus the voice.
Sorry, I like this comment from chat.
Decipher says, did Jobs give a thumbs up and say, hey, while jumping over the said shark?
We'll imagine that he did.
Since I know you're big on the mobile gaming and everything, do you think the gaming is going to take off on this platform?
I mean, we already heard about how it's going to be able to play all the existing iPhone games, but you blow them up to scale or whatever.
It should be backwards compatible with the other ones, but then you have to realize some other... You saw that actual, you know, the day they actually revealed the iPad and they had like, I think it was Gameloft that had the first person shooter tech demo that they had up there.
It looked pretty damn good for something that small.
But Zaku, do you think there's going to be a lot of people that are that excited about the iPad where developers are going to be jumping to the bit to develop for it?
That depends on how much of an install base we're talking about with the iPad.
Whether or not the iPad itself would have the same numbers as the iPod Touch and the iPhone.
If there's a huge install base, then that's a pretty big market to actually make games on.
The other thing is developers have to take advantage of the platform completely.
They can't just Mickey Mouse their way onto that platform with shitty titles.
They have to really find a way to exploit the platform's potential.
There's a lot of strengths in that platform in terms of multi-touch and the accelerometer.
Surely they could think of something that could utilize both if not all the aspects of the device.
You know, I think, though, it's important to remember that Apple loves to reinvent their shit.
And I think, honestly, I think in a year's time, I think the iPad's going to get a lot better.
Let's not forget.
Good God.
It's like he's shooting a gun at his keyboard.
It sounds like whack-a-mole.
It does.
It sounds like you have a Chuck E. Cheese there.
All right.
Here's the thing.
I think in a year's time, when that thing gets redeveloped, it's going to be great.
Because let's not forget, the iPhone did not have the App Store when it first launched.
Right, and that was like several months and that was basically Steve Jobs coming to his senses and realizing that you can't just have everything web-based when that whole web-based platform is basically a bottleneck.
It's not a robust solution for what you could actually do natively on that phone.
Alright, Zach, we're going to let you go so you can go play more Whack-A-Mole, but thanks for the call, okay?
Alright, have a good one.
Type a little bit more for us so we can hear it a little more.
We need to have like a loudest keyboard competition here at Orange Lounge Radio in honor of the new soundboard helping us with alleviating the Jamie typing during the show noises.
We need to have a loudest keyboard competition.
I don't type that loudly.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
It's Brad from PodCulture.
Hey, Brad from PodCulture.
Wait, hold that thought for a minute.
You're right, Jamie.
You don't type with your fists, but you have to admit...
Okay, Brad, what's up?
How you doing?
I'm doing fine, guys.
What's on your mind?
Star Trek Online, man.
Oh, Star Trek Online.
I know you've been all over this game.
Congratulations on having a computer good enough to play it, for starters.
The computer itself isn't that old, or isn't that high-end.
A lot of RAM and a...
Video card that was donated to us.
It's the video card.
The video card is so key I think for this game and well any game really.
But tell us a little bit about your experience as a Star Trek online.
How's it been going for you?
When I can log in, it's great.
I guess with the beta and stuff I had some problems at first logging in and staying in and then they had one huge, almost a gig patch that seemed to smooth everything out.
That took forever, didn't it?
No, kidding.
Also, were you there for when the beta closed?
Oh yeah, I was on the Starbase getting my ass kicked by Borg.
Okay, so how cool was it?
It was ridiculously cool because it was hopeless.
There's nothing you could do to win.
Did the Borg come out and say, you will die?
When you hear the Borg, you can actually hear the big mass voice of them talking.
It's pretty cool.
Yeah, the first training mission with the older Borg was pretty damn cool.
So that's how they ended the beta?
They just had a big Borg invasion?
Yep.
Oh, it was Borg, Klingon, every damn...
Race Attack, and it was awesome.
Nice.
That sounds very Ragnarok of the developers to do.
It's kind of a geek Ragnarok, yeah.
In Ragnarok, they used to just do random raids on the town by all the critters.
Did you go ahead and remake your character?
Oh, yeah.
I'm doing that tonight.
I'm almost back to where I was.
Oh my gosh, that's impressive.
I'm totally going to have a character permanently living on DS9.
I don't care.
During the beta, I flew my ship out there, and it looks pretty damn slick.
No quark!
It's, what, 38 years or something like that?
He still needs to make money.
He's got his own moon now, and his brother's in Nagus.
You gotta wait for the expansion.
There's gonna be an inevitable expansion pack, and that's where the fan service will really start getting delivered.
They'll put Khan.
You'll be able to fight Khan or something.
No, he's probably long since... He died, Rob!
This is Star Trek Online in the alternate universe, though?
No.
Oh, okay.
It takes place from that point, the big event where the two universes split.
It goes forward from, quote, our prime timeline forward.
Now I've gone cross-eyed.
It'll do that.
I will say this is the first game that's actually got me to play an MMO.
I quit World of Warcraft for this.
Well, this is better.
Hell yeah.
Except I totally, totally hate the targeting system.
More like ship navigation in combat.
Or the fact that having never really played much in PC gaming, period, if I just suck, which I do.
No, it's not you.
It's just the control, and the walking controls are oversensitive.
A little bit, yeah.
Yeah, I mean, like, it's really easy to run into a wall.
Well Brad, I hope you have a lot of fun on Star Trek Online.
I know there's been talk about an OLR fleet, but since I'm not really playing the game until I get a better computer, that's going to be all Jamie to put together, her OLR-ian race and all that.
So Jamie, you're going to have to get on the forums and tell people how to join up with you.
Screw that, I'm playing a trill.
Whatever.
Well, he did say join up.
I tried to make a couple of Olarians.
They're not very orange, although I did make a really cool chick.
I'll tell you what.
I'll put up some of my experimental pictures in the chat room of some of the things I've made because I saved screen caps.
This is what I want you to do.
If anyone wants to contribute to the Olarians, I want pictures of your creation screen with the face dimensions.
With what you've done to make one.
That's what I want to see.
Hopefully we'll get some forum chat.
Brad, I hope you have a lot of fun with Star Trek Online.
Hopefully I'll be joining you in a few months.
I want to ask you real quick though, because I know you're a big fan of this too and one of your other shows is about Dollhouse.
Oh yeah.
If I'm not mistaken, Dollhouse had its final episode this past week.
How was it?
It was... It was a different kind of episode.
It was almost a sequel to the season one ender, Epitaph One.
And it was pretty good.
It was pretty good overall.
It was... It's one of those things that you could tell that they had a rush.
The last few episodes, actually, they crammed like...
Two seasons worth into four episodes.
That's too bad.
Any word about what Joss Whedon's up to next, besides directing an episode of Glee, apparently?
Well, apparently he's got battered wife syndrome or something because he's in talks with FX, which is pretty much Fox, about doing something.
And then, of course, there's always Dr. Horrible 2.
Oh, Dr. Horrible 2.
Excellent, excellent.
Alright, well, Brad, we're going to let you go, but thanks so much for your call, okay?
Alrighty, guys.
Have fun, and the new board is sounding really good.
Thank you so much.
We're happy to have it.
Now, if only we could get all the computer stuff side-fixed, but we'll get it.
Alright, later, Brad.
Later, guys.
PodCulture.net if you want to hear more of Brad and his sci-fi geekdom.
And if you liked our little Doctor Who talk earlier, or I should say DarkSakura's little Doctor Who talk earlier, like, that's Brad's show.
That's where they live there.
They'll debate whether 10th Doctor was better or 4th Doctor was darker.
They'll debate that all day long.
By the way, one thing to mention.
If anyone else is playing Star Trek Online, you can add me to your friends list.
I'm in there as DarkSakura with the space in between the two on the Star Trek Online page.
Alright, we got another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Good evening, you across the ocean.
How are you, my friend?
This is Akeriper, as well as new listeners.
What the fuck?
I will help.
Oh well, anyway, good evening.
Good evening.
Or good morning, if you are to be incorrect or something.
Actually, it's like half past five.
It's five in the morning where you are?
Yeah, it's 5.35.
I feel so bad we weren't able to do the early show, but, you know, shit happens.
What can we do?
The thing is that, well, yeah...
I was almost about to actually miss it, since I was just shaking around a bit, and then I just found out, oh yeah, this supposed show is like now, but I haven't slept that much, so, oh well, what the hell, I'll see if it happens, but it didn't, so, well.
Well, what's on your mind tonight, Aki Ripper?
Um, well, um, Mass Effect 2 is an awesome game.
Of course.
We haven't mentioned anything about Mass Effect 2, but that was a huge release this week.
I know it's been getting a lot of, like, especially folks that just loved the first one are all about this game.
Tell us a little bit about your experience with Mass Effect 2.
Um, I've, uh, well, uh, I, uh, well, what can I say?
I'm an impatient fuck, so to say.
I should really be, like, and I'm, uh, and I'm, like, in a kind of way, uh, almost, but still not, uh, doing that, since, well, the whole story is that I got the, uh, cracked, the, got the pirated version of it, and played it all through, and
And then I tried to install my retail copy, and my retail copy will not work for some strange reason.
But here's the other thing, is that since I'm still running the Windows 7 beta, which runs out of time pretty soon, it doesn't annoy me that much, so to say.
But how is Mass Effect?
Because I'm not as up and up on Mass Effect.
I watched a friend play it once for a little while, and obviously I've heard it's a Bioware RPG, it's awesome.
What are some of the differences between 1 and 2?
Or is it really just like a continuation of one story?
The whole difference between Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 1 is really the combat is way much better.
Way, way, uh, much better since, well, um, it annoys me really at first because, well, uh, I'm not, because basically they, I, I felt like they've turned like Mass Effect into Gears of War, which is, well, you run for cover and cover, cover, and, uh, well, you shoot for it, shoot from cover.
And that was a mechanic that I didn't at first like really at all.
But, well, after a while I got used to it, and then I've just been reminded, yeah, what's the difference between this and Gears of War?
Well, here you actually have a health bar, or shield meters, and you can actually rush people, kill them up front, and...
and in Mass Effect 2, I don't die after like five minutes.
Well, good, because I'm totally the type of bonsai kind of player where I just run out.
I'm not very good with covering that, so excellent.
Well, IKripper, I want to wrap up real quick and get to some other calls, but quickly, what are some other games you're looking forward to in the next couple weeks?
Bioshock 2.
Oh, another great one.
Yeah, but these... And that's the...
That's the only game I have room for in my budget.
But here's the other thing.
For both Mass Effect 2 and Bioshock 2, I've went and got the collector's one.
Especially the Bioshock one is really interesting because you get the soundtrack that you get in the special one is the
Record, that authentic record, apparently.
Which is, like, that's like a few nerd bonuses from me, which makes it like insta-buy.
So, I will...
All right.
Well, I gotta let you go to get some more calls, but have fun with your collector's edition.
Enjoy.
Yeah.
All right.
Later.
And thanks for staying up or getting up earlier, staying up late.
Now, you know he's staying up late to listen to the program.
That's an awesome commitment for you guys overseas.
Love it.
Why not?
We can do some more calls.
877-GAME-OLR.
Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
And I'm just having fun hearing some of these people through the new computer because now that we kind of had to reconfigure our sound, it's actually helping the calls a lot.
I'm actually kind of impressed.
We should have done this like three years ago.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, this is X-Link.
Hey, X-Link.
How you doing?
Hey, doing good.
I have a few things I'd like to talk about real quick.
Well, I suppose.
The iPad.
The only good thing I can see about that is maybe playing desktop version of D&D, making it more better, enhancing it a little bit.
That's the only cool thing I could possibly see ever coming out of that thing for $500.
Funny enough, another giant, I mean, not a tablet so much, but that table, the Surface.
I remember a story we had a couple months ago, maybe like last month, about a big D&D game that was on the Surface.
I know it was supposed to be kind of really innovative for that platform.
So that's an interesting way of thinking is the iPad as a D&D device.
I could see that.
Correct.
Mass Effect had a big patch about two months ago for the first game that they took a lot of the issues that they were having, like in the screens where there was dialogue, where it was spoken, a lot of times it would skip.
They cleared a lot of that up, which was really helpful and made the gameplay a lot better, a lot more smooth than it was before.
and then on Mass Effect 2 I'm hearing they're taking a lot of the took a lot of the gameplay and a lot of the stuff for like the experience for how when you level up a character and made it more easier and the interface more easier than what's beforehand hmm so that was very interesting
I'm going to have to check these games out at some point.
There's too many games to play, especially now.
Usually we're not saying this in January, February.
It's insane what the release calendar looks like.
I'm starting to wonder what's left for Christmas.
Really?
Well, it's hard for me because I work, and then I do my online schooling, and then between that and trying to level my character in WoW still, it's kind of hard to go back and forth.
Yeah.
I just now got to like 9 hours of Mass Effect 1 for the PC which I'm really enjoying a lot Weren't you telling me on Warcraft that you bought that on some Steam sale or something?
No, I bought a few other things on Steam, but that wasn't one of them.
Actually, I bought that one at a store for $15, $10 when it was on sale.
Nice.
Yeah, it was a real good value for it.
I can't remember what I bought.
Now I'm going to go back and try to remind myself what I bought last from Steam.
But it's been a while since I bought something from there.
Usually I get most of my stuff while it was on sale during that Christmas time, but...
I have a question for Loki though.
I was planning on trying down the road here getting an Xbox 360.
Which system would be the best for my value?
They're all about the same because it's really just what size hard drive you want.
So probably just...
Elite Elite Elite Elite Elite
Oh, it's just the Elite and the Core now?
Then you need to just get the Elite, I think.
The Arcade is good for replacing a dead 360, which is what I just did, or people that really don't play console games a lot.
But if you're going to play your games... Think about it.
If you get an Arcade unit and you want to play 1 versus 100, you have no place to store the game because you have to download it from the server.
So you're going to need a hard drive.
And by the way, it's very interesting.
I mean, something that I don't hear enough people question...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
without any type of wireless adapter built in.
They don't put the component cable in with the Sony systems either.
Okay, fair enough.
Then I'll give you that one.
But without a wireless adapter where Sony has that built in, yes, and Microsoft wants $100 for theirs.
But some people don't need that, and so why pay the extra money for it?
I'm just saying it's not brought up enough that what's the value you're getting, especially now that the PS3 is $299.
They're about equal now, I think.
So something to think about.
Anyway, sorry.
Yeah.
Really quickly, I'll let you go.
The Battle.net, you were asking about that.
I actually own a copy of Warcraft 3 with the expansion, and the funny thing about that is when I registered that onto it, I can now download that anytime I want through them.
Which is good, because if I ever lose a disc, or the disc gets lost when I move from place to place, or it gets broken or something...
It's good enough to know that I can log on to that site and re-download the game and not worry about, you know, have to go out and spend another 30, 40 bucks or 20 bucks or whatever to replace the game.
Absolutely, I'm trying to find my old Diablo 2 key for the same reason, because I want to play that again, and I know I can download it, but I can't find my old CD, the game's just so freaking old.
But what's cool about it, if you put the CD key into the battle.net, it will not only appear on your screen like it does with Warcraft and everything, but also it will let you download it.
Like, if you click on the game, you can download the game onto your computer.
Very cool.
So that's very plus.
X-Link, we're going to wrap up and let you go so we can try and squeeze a couple more calls in, but thank you so much, okay?
Take care, buddy.
877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
We'll see if any more calls come in, but I'll let Loki start some last-minute news.
I'm assuming Jamie doesn't have anything, but I don't know if you have anything, Jamie.
Way to assume, Rob.
I'm just saying.
I don't have anything.
Aha, I was right.
There's more Who coming to the Rock Band marketplace.
Apparently some more tracks are going to be coming on February 7th, according to an advertisement.
It looks like, oh, that's in Rock Band?
I don't know.
It's some digital advertisement, but that's kind of neat.
We got another call coming in.
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, it's Sterlok.
Hi, Sterlok.
What's on your mind?
Eh, not much.
I wanted to let you guys know about something cool I found a few weeks ago.
We like cool stuff.
What's up?
Well, remember the FC Mobile, which was the portable NES?
Yes, I do.
I got that as a Christmas present, which was amazing.
I have one too.
Well, now there is a portable Super Nintendo.
It's done by a really crappy company.
Yeah, it kind of is, but it's not that bad.
Does this mean the patents are up on the Super Nintendo technology or something, where now we're going to start seeing all these bootleg Super Nintendos come out?
I guess so.
I guess we're going to be seeing more of these.
So maybe this is the first one out the gate, but that means there might be some more of these in the future.
Well, tell us a little more about the system, because even though Jamie's heard of it, I have not.
Well, it's called the FC-16 Go.
Um...
and yeah, it's done by Yobo who did the FC Twin and like the FC3 and I don't know, they're not the greatest but the Super Nintendo end seems to be kind of improved in this.
It does play Star Fox.
Oh my gosh.
Nice.
Wow.
My only real complaint about it is the headphone jack is retarded.
Like
The headphone jack is not your standard, you know, three and a half millimeter, you know, whatever.
It's 2.5, which is, you know, like what you would see like in a cell phone headset.
That's weird.
Do you think that might be a region thing because cell phones are so prevalent in the other countries?
Maybe where this is really... I don't... I mean, I solved that problem.
I just got an adapter and that was that.
That's what Radio Shacks are really good for.
I need an adapter.
Yeah.
Yeah, exactly.
But yeah, I haven't found anything that doesn't work on it.
Well, that's pretty cool.
I guess Super Mario RPG probably doesn't work.
I don't know because I don't have the game.
Is it the same type of thing like the FC Mobile where it's kind of like you can have it on a little portable system or you can hook it into the TV and do it that way?
Yep, it is, and it comes with two wireless controllers also.
Oh, wow.
And the controllers are actually pretty good.
Drool.
I'm very excited at the idea, because Super Nintendo, I'm sorry, is the best console they ever put out.
I don't think they'll ever put out a console that good ever again.
Just being able to play some of these games like Kid Icarus, or not Kid Icarus, I was going to say Super Metroid, and
I wish the hypothetical Super Nintendo Kid Icarus game in my head an Actraiser in Final Fantasy 3 6, whatever you want to call it which does work on it with the PC Engine Duo that wasn't even released in the US so I have no memories of that sorry, it's got some of the best games ever which was kind of a bastardized Rondo of Blood pretty much alright, well Sterlok, anything else on your mind buddy?
No, that was it.
All right.
Well, thank you so much for the call, and have fun with that FC-16 device.
Yeah, it's pretty fun.
I'm going to look into it, but I'm going to wait and see what kind of competition comes out.
We'll see.
Yeah.
I'm sure there will be other things.
All right.
Take care, buddy.
See you.
GameGuru says, expect the FC64 to come soon.
Who knows?
It sounds like it's about, what, 20 years on the patents or something?
I don't know exactly how that all works, but it's going to be interesting when the ones on the PlayStation and so forth are up.
I'm really curious to see what happens there.
Decipher in chat says, I want a portable N64 so bad.
Go buy a Nintendo DS.
Seriously?
That's what they pretty much are.
Loki, do you have any other last-minute stories while we see if any other calls come in?
Yeah, let's see.
We've got a call coming in.
Hold on.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hello, it's Salacious Pop.
Hi, how are you?
I'm good.
How are you?
I'm great.
For those listeners that don't know, Salacious Pop, you know this show pretty well, right?
Yeah, I've been listening since about September.
Yeah, and is there any type of a special relationship you have to this program?
Yeah, I might be going out with one of the hosts.
Get a room!
Yeah.
Shermie and I, we just, you know... It's kiddie love.
Lots of...
Flapping hands and flailing, it was very chaotic and stressful.
I know, and you're probably just kind of watching going, just like Shermie, kind of watching going, what?
Yeah, it was my fault that I was there.
I did 9-11, and I caused all that cancer, and then I set up the bomb for all our...
To all the UK listeners, I'm sorry.
My presence there sort of cursed the machine.
They have a new system now.
I see.
To what do we owe your phone call tonight?
I was just being silly and wanted to say hello and say that I'm really looking forward to eventually being a guest.
Maybe this room will be less chaotic next time you're here.
Let's hope.
I don't know.
Tonight was pretty bad.
The only difference between what you saw and tonight is that we actually had a show tonight.
We've got a bigger mess in here now.
But there was lots of flailing.
Yes.
There really was.
Well, what about this week's news?
I know you've got something to say about some of these topics going on here.
You were the one that gave me the Steam story.
Most of my internet trolling for news has involved just wank about the iPad, which I know that everyone's gone over about a million times on tonight's show.
But just that it's not very good.
As a huge Half-Life fan, I was upset that Black Mesa Source was bumped until this year, but that's like a month-old story.
They were supposed to release their remake of Half-Life 1 by the end of last year, and it didn't happen.
I remember hearing something about that, and I remember you were kind of upset about that, because I know you're a big Half-Life fan.
Whatever happened to Episode 3?
That's the other big question, right?
Damn them!
It's probably going to be so big that they're just going to throw it into Half-Life 3.
I don't really need to.
And why don't you own a Wii?
Because you have a 360 and a PS3.
Well, I put off buying...
The 360 and the PS3 because I wanted an HDTV because they were made for HDTVs.
So now that I have the TV and Wii is now standard def, the video file in me is offended by that and I just don't want one.
It's like, I don't know.
Nintendo's being ignorant?
Yeah.
If they put out an HD one or the Wii whatever, Omega...
in a year or two, the next gen.
I would get that, but I just don't want... I'm sort of over standard definition.
Don't care that they're the only system you can do the new Super Mario Bros.
or Super Smash Bros.
Melee or this Metroid Other M or the fancy Zelda games, but until it's pretty, no thank you.
I guess.
I mean, it sounds really superficial and I hate the...
Fanboys on the forum to just say oh you know the graphics blah blah blah it's all about the graphics but those franchises I've visited those franchises so much and I've played the previous incarnations of Zelda and Metroid that I can just go to a friend's house like it's not that important to me to get a system for those specific franchises which is really all Nintendo is now like you have to be with Nintendo if you want the Zelda whereas all the third party is with
Sony and Microsoft so alright well you know that I have a Nintendo system so you know you can come over and play Zelda or what have you if I choose to buy those games for the record you guys are both invited everyone in this room including me because I live here and on the phone with us is invited for PC Engine Night
When is PC Engine Night?
Sometime.
Maybe after Moving Chaos?
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
We'll get Alan down here one week and we'll have PC Engine Night.
It'll be fun.
Seriously, we'll get our Dracula X on.
Or bring PC Engine over to New Casa de Rob that'll be wired for video and everything.
If Dan doesn't crap his pants like he did last time.
Just steal it.
I did last time.
Nice.
I should probably let you go.
I hate to do that to you, but I'll talk to you later.
You know that.
Yes.
All right.
You take care.
Good night, guys.
Great show.
Bye.
Thank you.
Bye.
All right.
That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
Sorry to those folks that didn't get through, but hey, we need emails, so you should totally write us some emails if you didn't get through tonight.
That would be awesome.
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
I'm going to let Loki wrap up with any other last-minute stories, and then we're going to wrap up the show.
Loki.
The developer behind the Survivor horror game that came out last summer, Cursed Mountain, has gone under.
Yeah.
Apparently they've run into some financial trouble.
Oh well, I got shut down.
Too bad.
That's all I pretty much had.
Oh, Dragon Quest looks like 6 is going to have some new anti-piracy measures put in place on that cart, so it might be a little harder to...
DeKrak, and then also there's this one game that I'm playing now that's a homebrew game that's now available on, or I should say that it was a free game that was available now on Wii Homebrew, which is Psyobon, which is Cat Mario, and it's extremely hard and funny because it's extremely hard.
Is that what you were giggling at during the Skype calls?
It's just really brutal.
The second level, you're supposed to go into the warp pipe
if you wonder why Loki doesn't talk much during the Skype segment unless you specifically call out his name it's because that's the point of the show where he's catching up on all the funny stuff and you'll randomly just hear him hee hee hee over there in the corner wait it doesn't sound like that but you know what I mean he's laughing at something on the internet
All right.
Is that it?
That's all.
We are about out of here.
Well, we're going to wrap up the show, but not until we go around and get everybody's final thought.
But I do want to say before we get to the final thoughts, thank you guys so much for downloading Orange Launch Radio and checking us out and sticking with us through the good times and the bad.
I know it sucks that we haven't had any show the past couple weeks, but I'm looking at the live listening numbers and we haven't really tapered off.
We're still right back where we were.
And so thank you guys for coming out.
I know especially the anticipation of us coming back tonight.
and I hope the new sound was worth it but at the same time especially for those of you live folks that had to kind of put up with some of the hiccups we've had tonight that will probably continue on into our special live only afterbirth segment after the show thank you guys for sticking by us while we kind of go through all these changes but it's fun it's a new year a new decade of sound and everything
so anyhow and of course if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio we are a non-profit show we're not really a business that's out to make money we don't really run ads during the show all we ask if you like the show tell two friends about the show and help us spread the word that's all we ask we're an independent production we don't have a lot of big dollars behind us and we're just here because we want to have fun that being said let's go around and get everybody's final thought DarkSakura I see you picking up the mic so why don't you give us your final thought um yeah
Loki, your final thought?
Hopefully that new YouTube video will be up this week.
My final thought is I totally want a warm chocolate chip cookie right now.
Sounds amazing.
All right.
Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting our show.
We really appreciate it.
We'll be back here to do it all again next week.
Hopefully the computer doesn't blow up or anything until then, but we'll pray that we're back.
Bye, guys.
