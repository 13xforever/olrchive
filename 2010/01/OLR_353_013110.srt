00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,920
Today, January 31st, 2010, big Nintendo franchise games could be out this year, the classic

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:29,760
Japanese release looks to be US-bound, and Ubisoft announces a controversial new DRM.

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:38,080
We are live, I think, and welcome to another week everybody of Orange Lounge Radio, we

4
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,980
are that show dedicated to video gaming, video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

5
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,480
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here every week, and also joining me tonight, say hello

6
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,640
to the one and only Happiest Bunny on the Farm, or as we used to call her anyway, the

7
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,320
one and only, now she's an angry bunny, no I don't know, Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
I'm not angry.

9
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,200
No, she's a very pleasant bunny, contrary to her.

10
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
I'm not a bunny.

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,200
To rumors.

12
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,600
I'm not a bunny.

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,600
You're some bunny.

14
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Meow.

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,600
Meow.

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,600
Alright, so, and also with us tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
Hello.

18
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
Hi, how you doing?

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,600
Doing fine.

20
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,920
He proved he was the Techmaster tonight, ladies and gentlemen.

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,520
Okay, where the hell did we start?

22
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,000
Alright, obviously we've been without a show for two weeks, and that's not the place

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,480
we like to be.

24
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,400
You guys knew this was coming though, because a couple weeks ago we told you guys that there

25
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,080
was not gonna be an Orange Lounge Radio because I was gonna be in Seattle, but then the plan

26
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,480
was that the week after that we were gonna do the early show.

27
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:38,200
We were gonna do the 10 a.m. show Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern, 6 p.m. for the UK listeners.

28
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,760
We were gonna do a show for them, and that was gonna be the special early show.

29
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,040
Well, unfortunately, we came here, we got up at the ass crack of dawn to come here,

30
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,680
do the show, and unfortunately when we booted the studio computer, it started to launch

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,680
Windows XP, and then died.

32
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,160
Terrible, terrible.

33
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,000
So unfortunately, we didn't end up having a show last week, and that kills.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,920
We really hate missing two weeks in a row, because we know a lot of people, you know,

35
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,800
well especially the fact that we know a lot of our British listeners were, you know, making

36
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,680
plans to tune in, so we feel really bad that that didn't happen.

37
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,600
But of course, you know, computer issues are computer issues, there's not a lot we can

38
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,120
do about it, so it didn't happen.

39
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,080
So we had to replace the old computer essentially.

40
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,860
Now the nice thing is we already had a new computer waiting for us, because you might

41
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,800
remember a couple years ago, or you might not, the listeners all pooled together and

42
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
bought us a new computer.

43
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Wasn't that long ago?

44
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Was it?

45
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Well, maybe it was about a year ago.

46
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Well, it was just a great gesture, because we didn't ask for it, it was just a really

47
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,540
nice thing, and we thought, oh, now that we have this extra computer, we're going to use

48
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,280
it for some video projects that never got off the ground because of all our studio moves

49
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,160
and we're actually in a smaller space now.

50
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,480
But anyway, it ended up being a really good thing we had that on hand.

51
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,840
But Loki took that computer, got all the software on it this week, and literally within an hour,

52
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,960
got our old studio drive in the new computer, we got it all up and running.

53
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,520
I'm going to take some credit too, because I got the Skype working and some of the internal

54
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,000
Adobe Audition was pissing me off, because we upgraded to a newer version of that too.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,280
Now here's the other thing.

56
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,280
We have folks in chat tonight, chat.orangelaunchrader.com, welcome to all you guys in chat, saying, wow,

57
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,980
you guys sound clear tonight, you guys sound better than usual.

58
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,320
Here's the other thing.

59
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:21,680
We were also working on a top secret upgrade this whole time, a brand new mixing board

60
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,640
that we just posted a picture of to our Twitter account.

61
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
And the website.

62
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,520
Oh, did you send it to the website too?

63
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,520
Yes.

64
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,520
Nice.

65
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,520
So it's also there on orangelaunchrader.com.

66
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,100
So if we do sound a little different, you can thank our new mixing board.

67
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,380
And supposedly our mixing board does all these effects I haven't even played with yet.

68
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,880
Like I think it does like equalizer effects.

69
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,320
Like I think if I hit that button, I think my voice gets more bassy.

70
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,260
I don't know if anyone notices that, but there's like an onboard equalizer.

71
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,040
We just opened this out of the box tonight.

72
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,040
Let me turn that off.

73
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,140
I don't even know if that did anything at all.

74
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,200
But I think supposedly you can do these weird FX things too.

75
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,360
Like if I turn, let's see which ones me turn that up.

76
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,480
This is all live radio.

77
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,480
It's all the fun.

78
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,100
I think if I turn that up, it actually does some type of delay effect.

79
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,100
It probably sounds stupid.

80
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,100
I don't know.

81
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,100
Let me turn that down.

82
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,560
So anyway, we're going to play with the new mixing board and see what happens with that

83
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,860
over the next few weeks.

84
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,400
I don't even know if it, maybe nothing happened at all.

85
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,880
We're still kind of playing with this thing, but it's fancy.

86
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,960
I like it.

87
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,920
It's very bright when it's on.

88
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
It's very cool.

89
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,480
I feel like we're moving on up, moving on up, moving on up.

90
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,480
All right.

91
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,480
So anyway, it's great to be back.

92
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,440
We're really sorry we missed the past couple of weeks, but I think for some of these upgrades

93
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,080
that we've had here in studio, in a way it was almost worth it.

94
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,800
I can tell you the show computer is much better than it was before.

95
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,360
So I'm excited.

96
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,520
And they said in chat they didn't hear the FX.

97
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,640
So, all right.

98
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,280
So I'll have to play with the mixing board over there.

99
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,280
I don't know.

100
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,440
I was just kind of futzing around with it.

101
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,080
I don't know what effect is on.

102
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,800
I'm not, I'm not going to worry about it.

103
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,100
Those effects seem kind of stupid.

104
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,960
Like that effect was supposed to be delay.

105
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,000
So it would probably just make, make, make, make, me, me, me, me.

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Sound, sound, sound, sound.

107
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid.

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So yeah.

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Anyway.

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
All right.

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yes.

112
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,320
And D5T in our chat room says it goes to 11.

113
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
Yes.

114
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,920
Our new mixing board, actually it goes past 11.

115
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,020
It goes to plus 60.

116
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,440
This guy goes to 60.

117
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,520
All right.

118
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,560
Lots of gaming news we've missed in the meantime.

119
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,600
Let's get to it.

120
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,940
It has been some time.

121
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,560
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

122
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,920
Um, I didn't.

123
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
Not really.

124
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,600
I mean, I played Star Trek online, but I missed the end of the beta because I wanted to see

125
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,800
all of the Borg going in and assimilating all the people in game.

126
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,640
Um, I did see the video of it and it was pretty funny and, um, because like, uh, the Borg

127
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,680
took over, uh, Earth or the star base outside of Earth.

128
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,680
So it was pretty fun.

129
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,400
Um, I got, um, Tatunoko versus Capcom because I decided I did not want Silent Hill Shattered

130
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Memories.

131
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,680
Um, I know me not wanting a Silent Hill, but it wasn't really a Silent Hill.

132
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,080
I don't think it was like a different kind of game.

133
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,320
So I have Tatunoko versus Capcom, which makes me a happy fangirl.

134
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,680
And um, I, I read this really about it.

135
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,160
I think Dan's been playing a crap ton of Borderlands as usual.

136
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,640
And I finished another season of DS9 and it has nothing to do with playing games.

137
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,160
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

138
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
We did something.

139
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,880
We broke out the SNES and got our Super Metroid on.

140
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,880
I love Super Metroid.

141
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,880
By the way, guys, I just want to say in chat, cause some chatters are complaining about

142
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,880
Jamie's voice.

143
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,880
Hey!

144
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,880
No, not in that way.

145
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,760
Just that it's a little loud, but the nice thing is this mixing board does, I can adjust

146
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,360
audio on the fly way easier without screwing with gain, which is what I had to do before,

147
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,200
which would, that's why you got like the keyboard noises and everything.

148
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,920
Also Jamie is on a brand new mic, so I'm adjusting her a little bit here on the fly.

149
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
Live radio.

150
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,920
I love it.

151
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,100
I have a brand spanking new mic and my mic has a case.

152
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,100
It's beautiful.

153
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,720
So hopefully Jamie's volume is a little better now.

154
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
Just let me know.

155
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,680
We'll, we'll play with things tonight as we go and I apologize cause it's completely unprofessional,

156
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,240
but you know what?

157
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,240
I don't care.

158
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,240
You know what?

159
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,240
I don't care.

160
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,240
You know what?

161
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,240
You know what?

162
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
You know what?

163
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,240
There, that's what I say.

164
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,240
That's it.

165
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,000
Loki, how was your gaming week or three weeks as it will?

166
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,520
Well, it's all been about the same.

167
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,240
So um, I've been playing, you know, a lot of Grand Theft Auto, even at home now been

168
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,840
just trying to play more ranked matches to move up the leaderboards because I'm around

169
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,480
like 240 now.

170
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:27,480
Um, just that's out of um, ranked death matches and total money overall.

171
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,840
So um, that's alright, but I keep moving down because, you know, especially like this weekend

172
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,720
I didn't play any at all, but um, I'm doing pretty good and then my true skill ranking

173
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,080
as far as uh, ranked death match goes, I'm almost in the top 100.

174
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,320
Might be in the top 100 right now, I don't know.

175
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,700
But uh, last I checked I was like 104, 105.

176
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,760
So um, that's pretty good out of like 50,000 people.

177
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:56,040
Um, and then I've been playing Borderlands a lot, especially since I can, you know, mod

178
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,040
weapons on it.

179
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,080
So I've been playing with mod weapons and that's actually been pretty fun.

180
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,720
I've been trying not to make myself too overpowered, but um, I don't know.

181
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,720
It's been pretty cool.

182
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,280
Lots of crazy weapons you can make in the game.

183
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,560
Just really looking forward to uh, finishing it and then definitely getting all the download

184
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,560
content.

185
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,120
Um, and then, you know, we're going to be talking about a third piece of download content

186
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,200
probably later in the show.

187
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,880
So it's very exciting.

188
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:29,320
And then um, yeah, and then as I was going to say, uh, I know everybody's been bugging

189
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,080
me about doing more like videos for the YouTube channel.

190
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,700
So I finally, I put the one video that I did a while back on the YouTube channel, so there's

191
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,680
something there now and there's a new one, which I already previewed in studio, um, at

192
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,760
least the first three minutes of it.

193
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,080
I want to make it like 10 minutes, but it's pretty funny.

194
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,420
A lot of these custom things that Loki always talks about on the show, you can now kind

195
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,420
of see on the YouTube.

196
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,420
It's great.

197
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,740
It's, it will document, um, you know, how I used to play death match in, um, Grand Theft

198
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:01,320
Auto, um, the lost and damned while back when we played with modded consoles and modded

199
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,980
games and whatnot, um, are closed, you know, work games that we'd play.

200
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,660
But um, you know, it's hard to explain it, so I just kind of have to show you.

201
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:16,040
So the first part of the video that I have done that I finished this weekend, um, is

202
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,600
basically showing the different weapons in the game and then the very end there's like

203
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,520
some of the vehicles that you can use in there.

204
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,380
And then finally, I'm going to get into the actual death match stuff because I have like

205
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,460
hours of footage that I have to go through and edit down and stuff.

206
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,560
But um, I do have enough right now to kind of upload to YouTube if I wanted to.

207
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,960
I just don't know if I'm going to.

208
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
I may want to get home.

209
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,960
We'll see.

210
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,160
But um, it's, it's going to be awesome.

211
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,160
All right.

212
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,840
I'm looking forward to seeing more of the YouTube.

213
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,920
I didn't realize you'd already put one up.

214
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,920
Yes.

215
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,920
I did that yesterday.

216
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,920
Awesome.

217
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
Uh, let's see.

218
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,880
My gaming week, actually, I got to say it's, it's been pretty standard.

219
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,160
I've been sucked into pretty much one game and that's World of Warcraft.

220
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,280
My paladin, I'm going to do nerd speak for a minute here.

221
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,000
My paladin hit level 80 at the end of December and now I finally cleared every five man dungeon

222
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,040
as of this past week, including Halls of Reflection, which was, um, wow.

223
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,040
That was a toughie.

224
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,540
Uh, it was definitely a gear check of sorts, but I've been trying to just slowly upgrade

225
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,040
my gear, trying to get some of the Emblem of Triumph rewards.

226
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,620
And I even got a cape from my Emblem of Frost rewards, which is great because I don't really

227
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,940
raid on this character because I found raiding was too much of a time investment.

228
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,960
But I did run Naxxramas for the hell of it this week, just a little bit with a pickup

229
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,960
guild.

230
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,960
So it was kind of fun.

231
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,560
So anyway, that's pretty much that.

232
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,080
And, uh, Brad from Pop Culture and Chats asks, uh, what?

233
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
No Star Trek Online?

234
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,400
No, my computer will not run Star Trek Online.

235
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
My video card is not good enough.

236
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,360
When I try to run, at least when I was in the beta, uh, when I try to run the beta,

237
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,760
I get the music comes up and everything, but no, no visuals on the screen, which is usually

238
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,920
a sign that your video card sucks.

239
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,920
Here's the thing.

240
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,280
I bought my computer about a year and a half ago at this point for about $800.

241
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,680
I made the mistake of buying a box computer because I thought, Ooh, good deal.

242
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,680
This is great.

243
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,680
I sold it.

244
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,680
It's like a gaming computer.

245
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,680
Okay.

246
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,680
Here's the thing.

247
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,480
The video card port is AGP, not PCI express.

248
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,400
So that's really old.

249
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,400
Exactly.

250
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,560
I was pissed when I found that out, but stupid me, my mistake.

251
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,560
Lesson learned.

252
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
Just so you know.

253
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,080
I got my computer the Christmas 2009 and I can run it.

254
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,080
Yeah.

255
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,620
Mine, well, mine's from about 2008 cause I think I bought it around August of 08.

256
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,720
So you know, it's just a bummer, but lesson learned for next time.

257
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,520
So I might have to get a new computer later on down the line.

258
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,280
My gaming really didn't end there though.

259
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:42,460
I didn't really play, but I watched God of War collection this weekend, which included

260
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,360
the God of War 3 demo.

261
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,560
God of War is kind of one of those games.

262
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,560
It's really weird.

263
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,160
I haven't played a lot of it myself, but I've watched several other people play this game,

264
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:57,000
but I got to see the kind of new, like upgraded graphics for God of War 1.

265
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,440
I have to admit the game looked pretty good.

266
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,120
I mean, it definitely, you definitely can tell the improvements over a PlayStation 2

267
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,120
game.

268
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,480
The only like, and this is so minor, some of the overlays were kind of stretched to

269
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,960
be widescreen as opposed to like redone, but honestly that bitch is so minor.

270
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,480
I think the game really looks great and it's kind of one of those games I'm always sitting

271
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,320
there going, hmm, I want to, I want to kind of pick this up and play it, but for now I'll

272
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,480
just watch my boyfriend play cause he's having a lot of fun playing it, which by the way,

273
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,760
can I just say this real quick?

274
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,460
Why I'm really mad the show last week didn't happen is that he was supposed, he was a surprise

275
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,440
special guest on the show last week.

276
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,160
He's really funny and knows his shit when it comes to games, so I'm really disappointed

277
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,000
it didn't work out, but we're going to try to get him on a later show cause I'm sure

278
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,960
you guys are going to enjoy it.

279
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,540
Let's see, what else have I been playing these past few weeks that is not WoW related?

280
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:51,020
Still some Xbox live arcade things, one versus a hundred, cause I think the season's wrapping

281
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,020
up pretty soon.

282
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,200
A little bit of Gyromancer, a little bit, and a Bejeweled Blitz, you know Bejeweled

283
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,880
Blitz just got a major update, update on Facebook.

284
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,480
Now you collect coins to buy power ups that you use.

285
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,680
I love PopCap, they make the best, they make the best crack games in the world.

286
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
It's great.

287
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,880
Anyhow, uh, feel free to join our chat room guys if you're listening live.

288
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,360
We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com right after

289
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,860
the Bobby Black Wolf show.

290
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,800
We start at about six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern.

291
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,120
We got a little bit of a late start tonight because of all the issues going on with our

292
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
audio board.

293
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,680
In fact, I may have already said this whole spiel about All Games Radio and if I did I

294
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,600
apologize cause I'm really scatterbrained tonight with all the stuff going on.

295
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,320
But now we can kind of coast into housekeeping and tonight's news, I do want to say real

296
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,700
quick during housekeeping, again, there was no show on the feed for the past two weeks.

297
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:49,640
There was nothing so this should be the first show that shows up, episode 353 after 352

298
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,640
which was taped.

299
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,520
Believe it or not, on the 10th of the month.

300
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,940
So we have missed you guys as I know a lot of you have missed us.

301
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,840
And of course we have some fancy new toys and we're going to be playing with these over

302
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,840
the next few weeks.

303
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:05,040
Um, do bear with us though during tonight's show when we have a whole new setup, uh, we're

304
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,380
more prone to technical difficulties.

305
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,640
So just give a shout out and chat if suddenly our audio drops or something really weird

306
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
happens.

307
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
You don't hear us dead air.

308
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,960
Uh, our live listeners, we really count on you guys to help us out.

309
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,760
That dot orange lounge radio.com.

310
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,360
Also since I have been so focused on trying to make sure the show is starting by six o'clock,

311
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,960
I haven't been posting a lot of tweets, but go ahead and send in your Twitter topics.

312
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,320
If you have some stuff you want us to discuss tonight, we'll be taking those at the top

313
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,960
of part B tonight.

314
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,280
And of course, if you don't yet have us on Twitter, it's twitter.com slash O L R or we're

315
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,440
on Facebook too at orange lounge radio.

316
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,320
And as Loki mentioned a little bit ago, finally showing the YouTube some love and that's YouTube

317
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,640
orange lounge or orange, orange, orange, orange radio.

318
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,040
Usually if we're on a website, we're either under orange lounge or orange lounge radio.

319
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,160
So one of the two, anyhow, how about some news?

320
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,200
How about some actual video gaming news for the past week?

321
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,040
Look, you want to start us off tonight?

322
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,040
Yes.

323
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,760
Um, there is a report from Nintendo that hints at some of the titles coming soon as well

324
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:11,960
as possibly a released window for Metroid other M. Um, it's interesting.

325
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:17,760
They kind of, uh, and this is of course Japanese release dates, but, uh, there's some pretty

326
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:23,280
generic, um, you know, dates in fact, some that are just to be announced, uh, for example,

327
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:30,320
Metroid other M is slated right now for summer 2010, which is pretty awesome, you know?

328
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,360
Um, and then of course, uh, there's a title Xenoblade, which is, um, scheduled to be coming

329
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,920
out, uh, spring of 2010, so probably right around the corner.

330
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:49,800
And um, apparently I think, uh, Xenoblade is a new, uh, RPG, I want to say, um, and

331
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,040
then they've got Super Mario Galaxy, which is, you know, due sometime 2010, most likely

332
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,400
probably around the holiday, uh, be my guess.

333
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:04,760
And then, um, some other stuff I haven't heard of, uh, there's a new Legend of Zelda that's

334
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,280
uh, to be announced, Lion Attack Heroes, which is something that they showed, you know, during

335
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:16,720
E3, um, uh, Hoshi no Kirby, Kirby game, um, that's also to be announced and start with

336
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,600
a hundred words English conversation, most likely a game we probably won't see over here

337
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,040
because most of us speak English, maybe not that well, but we do speak it.

338
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,520
Um, and then Span, um, Smasher is another, uh, Wii game, which I remember, I think that

339
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,200
was a WiiWare title, um, I can't remember.

340
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,560
And then, um, looks like, uh, Kensaku-su, also another to be announced title.

341
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:44,800
And then Last Story, uh, which is I believe the new Mistwalker title, um, all those have

342
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,280
been announced for, you know, sometime this year or to be announced.

343
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:55,080
And then, uh, also there's a promo video that says, um, the new Zelda game, the one that

344
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,640
is kind of, uh, to be announced may be coming this year.

345
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:04,880
In fact, um, apparently, uh, something that they're thinking is going to be shown off

346
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,880
at E3.

347
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,560
And my guess is probably yes, because they're going to need something to get people's attention

348
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:18,720
after they show Wii Relax, because everybody's going to be like, ugh, don't care.

349
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,040
Do you think, I kind of get the impression based on a lot of this, what you're saying,

350
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:26,920
that Nintendo is really trying this year to really wow us at E3 where there's been a lot

351
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,040
of disappointment in years past.

352
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,200
Not just these games we've talked about so far, but some other ones we're going to talk

353
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
about in a minute.

354
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,640
It seems like there's a lot of core franchise news coming out of Nintendo.

355
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,200
Like they're really, with the exception of, well no, even Mario is supposed to have Galaxy

356
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,200
2, right?

357
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,200
So you've got what?

358
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,720
You've got Galaxy 2, Zelda, Metroid, I mean, a lot of their big franchises have games this

359
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
year.

360
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,720
Well, so far.

361
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,720
I mean, dates change.

362
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,560
We're talking about the end of 2010 now.

363
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,240
I mean, this stuff could all be pushed, you know, by the time we get to it.

364
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,880
Is it possible, though, that Nintendo's been working on the Zelda game in secret, quote

365
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
unquote?

366
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,680
I mean, you know, saying there's a new Zelda game is about as obvious as, you know, it

367
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,720
might rain today, you know?

368
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,680
But here's, remember E3 last year?

369
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,000
The Mario game came out of nowhere, and it ended up probably being the best Wii game

370
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
of the year.

371
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,200
I don't doubt that they're working on a new Zelda game, and the thing is, though, is I

372
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,520
wouldn't expect it to probably be too different than Twilight Princess was, because look at

373
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,520
Mario Galaxy, I mean, all they're really doing is crafting new levels to go with it.

374
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,800
It's basically going to be the same engine all over again, I mean, no effort there.

375
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,240
Wasn't there a rumor, and I want to say it was on our show roll for last week, because

376
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,400
sadly, the show didn't happen, but we had a whole script and a whole thing ready to

377
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,160
go, and I want to say one of the things was about that supposedly the new Zelda's supposed

378
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,520
to be kind of like Majora's Mask.

379
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,360
It was supposed to be a sequel to Majora's Mask, but, uh...

380
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,880
Which would make sense, because Majora's Mask was essentially, you know, Ocarina of Time

381
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,920
with some new frills, you know, because it was a new game.

382
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,180
I just...

383
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,180
I don't know.

384
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,180
I'm...

385
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,800
A lot of the stuff they see from Nintendo, and granted, other M looks pretty awesome,

386
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,120
but that's being kind of developed by a third party anyways, so whatever.

387
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,320
I just want to see Samus' booby mechanics, because it is Team Ninja after all.

388
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,000
So you know she's going to have some booby mechanics.

389
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's going to be awesome.

390
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,840
Even though she wears like a steel space suit or something.

391
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,040
I still want to see, I would rather see a lot of third party companies work with Nintendo

392
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,680
on some new games, you know, if that's what it's going to take to make these games kind

393
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,720
of stand out and be a little different.

394
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,800
I think that would be pretty cool.

395
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,840
Can you imagine like a new Mario game with, you know, them working with like Sonic Team

396
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,840
or something like that?

397
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,280
You know, like the 3D...

398
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,640
Suddenly Mario is blue and has spiky hair.

399
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,640
It's incredible.

400
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,560
Well it doesn't have to be exactly Sonic, but I'm just saying something like, you know,

401
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,720
the Sonic Adventure stuff.

402
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,720
I mean, just...

403
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,720
I don't know.

404
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,880
Or maybe revivals of some of the dead franchises that people really want to see come back.

405
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,720
Like, oh I don't know, Kid Icarus maybe?

406
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,000
Just a hunch?

407
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
We need Pit.

408
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Exactly.

409
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Whatever happened to that rumor?

410
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,440
There was artwork and all this shit that came out for the game?

411
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,440
And then it just...

412
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,440
No.

413
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,440
What?

414
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,680
The studio that was developing it closed, right?

415
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,680
It was Factor 5, right?

416
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,880
And they're not around?

417
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,880
I don't know.

418
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,520
This is all based on rumor.

419
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,640
That's why I say this with a question mark, because I'm sure it was rumored that like

420
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,240
five different people were developing it.

421
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,240
So...

422
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,240
Ugh.

423
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,240
Um, so yeah.

424
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,240
I mean, it'll...

425
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,240
I don't know.

426
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,080
I'm just not expecting a lot from it, but people I'm sure will love it, because Twilight

427
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,080
Princess was alright.

428
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,000
I just didn't really get into it, but maybe I'll try it again later on.

429
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,440
I don't know.

430
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,400
I like Wind Waker, so I must have something wrong with me.

431
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
Yeah you do.

432
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,400
No, I'm just kidding.

433
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
Well I have something...

434
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,040
No, clearly I have something wrong with me, because I think Ocarina of Time is so overrated.

435
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
Like it is not...

436
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,040
No, no.

437
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,040
I don't care for the Zelda game by far.

438
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,880
I don't care for the Nintendo 64 or Zelda games at all.

439
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:57,480
I hated the jump to 3D, just because I loved Link to the Past so much, like that that was

440
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,440
the next Zelda game just made me want to barf.

441
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,440
And I've tried.

442
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,440
Guys, I've tried.

443
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
And honestly...

444
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,440
I loved Ocarina.

445
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,440
I know.

446
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,440
Most people do.

447
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,440
I admit I'm weird.

448
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,040
I also think most people give too much fan wank to Chrono Trigger.

449
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,760
I don't think Chrono Trigger is that great.

450
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,760
Like it's great.

451
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,640
How much of it did you play?

452
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,640
Almost beat it.

453
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,640
I think I recorded it the way I thought.

454
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,080
Why don't they just take a page from Capcom?

455
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,080
And I've seen the ending.

456
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,280
I mean, we've seen how Capcom can sell these retro games that look like they were on the

457
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,000
NES or something.

458
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,700
Just make another Link to the Past or something like that.

459
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:38,240
You don't have to go all 3D and all crazy...

460
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,960
That's what they do on the Game Boy Advance, at least it was a couple years ago.

461
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,280
All those Game Boy Advance games were kind of like Link to the Past-y kind of games.

462
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,320
But I didn't like them because they were on the freaking Game Boy Advance and I wanted

463
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,600
something on my TV.

464
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,220
Although, you know, get one of the GameCube adapters.

465
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,220
Not the same thing.

466
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,220
And you know it.

467
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,560
I'm surprised we don't see Game Boy Advance games on the Wii yet.

468
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,560
Like virtual consoles?

469
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,560
Soon.

470
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,560
Soon.

471
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,440
Well, speaking of virtual console, you know, if these new games don't sound like your thing,

472
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,440
maybe some old classics.

473
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,320
And you want to talk classic, here's a game.

474
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,040
If you've been listening to OLR for any length of time, besides this is your first show,

475
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,120
you've heard this game come up on the show before because it is one of Jamie's all-time

476
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,440
favorites and she always says, Rob, you need to play this game.

477
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,800
I'm gonna have to get out, you know, my old system so you can play this game.

478
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,200
Well, she may not have to.

479
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:34,000
Castlevania Rondo of Blood apparently has been rated by the ESRB for the Wii.

480
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,280
Now this is following a couple weeks of reports that it was rated by the Australian board,

481
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,360
it was rated by, you know, other boards.

482
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:46,520
Apparently now it has been rated T for Teen by the ESRB, which indicates that it will

483
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,040
be headed to the Wii.

484
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:54,720
So and by the way, you had to have a PC Engine CD device a long time ago in order to play

485
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,720
this game.

486
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,560
Or you played the PSP remake, but of course that wouldn't be the original.

487
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:06,320
But that, what was it, Akumajo Collection or whatever it was called had this and Symphony

488
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,320
of the Night.

489
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,840
But this game had been quite altered.

490
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,160
So now apparently it is headed for the Wii.

491
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,400
What is also interesting about this, not only has this kind of been confirmed thanks to

492
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:23,680
the ESRB, but also a representative from Hudson has said the game is coming out shortly, but

493
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,200
here's the other interesting thing.

494
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,800
Not in English.

495
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,480
Because it is a virtual console release, it's just an emulation of the old game, they did

496
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,240
not go back and touch up any of the language.

497
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,880
So it's just, it is exactly what it was back in the day.

498
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:45,640
The only parts of this game that are in Japanese is, well even the freaking intro is in German,

499
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:51,060
and then there's dialogue that's like right at the beginning of the game, right when you

500
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:56,560
rescue people, and when you fight Dracula.

501
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:02,480
And really it's like, oh, Richter, it's your wife, blah blah blah, oh Maria, blah blah

502
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,480
blah.

503
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,480
You know, whatever.

504
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,040
I've played the intro though for you, haven't I?

505
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,040
I think so.

506
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,040
I think like a long time ago on the show.

507
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,480
With the beginning of it's like in like Gothic German.

508
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,680
There's actually, there's YouTubes of it now, but yeah.

509
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,680
But what do you think, Dark Sakura?

510
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:23,440
Now this is a game that went for a lot of money and still probably does go for a lot

511
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,440
of money.

512
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,520
Like I remember you saying something about a friend owed you like a hundred dollars and

513
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,000
came back from Japan with that to pay us back, and that was like a way better, you got a

514
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,680
better end of the deal, essentially, because that game's worth like what, two hundred or

515
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,680
something?

516
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:43,920
Well, the last eBay auction I looked at for that game intact was ending I think at about

517
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,280
a hundred and fifty for a low one.

518
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,280
Okay.

519
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,280
What do you think about this now?

520
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:52,600
Do you think that this could possibly devalue that purchase, or is this a good thing because

521
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,820
more people will get to play the game without having to have all this fancy stuff?

522
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,680
To be honest, I don't really give a crap about the value of the game.

523
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,400
I mean, because it's a fun game.

524
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,920
I would love for people to play it.

525
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,920
Well good.

526
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
Then you're collecting for the right reasons.

527
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,720
I think it's great that I have a real copy of it.

528
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,760
I liked my burn copy for, yes, I had a burn copy.

529
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:16,880
I'm glad that I had it because I played the crap out of it and, and keep in mind for the

530
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,360
longest time, that was the only way I could remotely play it.

531
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,680
So I'm sure there's going to be, you know, other formerly frustrated fangirls.

532
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,040
Ooh, that's actually a good name for a podcast.

533
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,000
Formerly frustrated fangirls.

534
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,400
Isn't that what you and TRS comic book show is?

535
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,120
Yeah, that's Monday Comic Mania.

536
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,120
Oh, I see.

537
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,120
Are you guys on iTunes yet?

538
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,120
No.

539
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,120
Oh.

540
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,120
We were going to talk to you about that.

541
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,120
Okay.

542
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
All right.

543
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
Call me.

544
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
Have your people call my people.

545
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,120
Anyway.

546
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,120
My people being me.

547
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,120
Rondo of Blood.

548
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,120
Sure me.

549
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,120
Call Rob.

550
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,800
Which is what will happen if your show doesn't get listed on iTunes, Rondo of Blood.

551
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,880
Anything else we should know about this game being on virtual console?

552
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,880
It's fucking fun.

553
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,880
I wonder how much they're going to charge us for it.

554
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,680
What are they charging for the other?

555
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:06,560
If Neo Geo games are like 9, I think Turbo Graf, well you can't say Turbo Graf is a CD.

556
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,960
It's a PC Engine CD, this one.

557
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,440
I'm going to guess, with no real basis, they're going to charge 10 bucks.

558
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,000
Well what are they already charging for the CD games elsewhere?

559
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,280
I couldn't tell you off the top of my head.

560
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,680
I don't even know if PC Engine CD has been emulated yet.

561
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
I thought they did.

562
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,680
Have they?

563
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,680
They did.

564
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,680
East, didn't they?

565
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,680
Or Vallis?

566
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,680
They've done some.

567
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,680
Yeah, they've done some of the CD games.

568
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,680
A few of them have.

569
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,960
There's so much on virtual console now I can't even keep track of it anymore.

570
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,160
But yeah, I want a lot of people to get it.

571
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:40,280
I would actually love to see people spend the money on this so that Nintendo knows that

572
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,560
hey, we want more.

573
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:49,540
You know, especially this game, keep in mind, for a long time this game was considered one

574
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:53,920
of those pinnacles of gaming that you just could not find here.

575
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:58,280
You had to be something special to have it or have good contacts or have money.

576
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,760
You know.

577
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,400
And I think that it just goes to show that, you know, maybe patience is a virtue.

578
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,720
A virtual virtue.

579
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,720
Aww.

580
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,720
Aww.

581
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,400
And by the way, the next game they need to put out is Sapphire.

582
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,720
Some comments from our chat room.

583
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,640
Ray Ayanami says, thank you for not being the snobby her-her, I bought the original

584
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,320
for $9001 kind of collector Dark Sakura.

585
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
There you go.

586
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,600
Well, you know what, there's actually two other games though that I would love to see

587
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,000
coming on a virtual console, but one of them they would have to translate.

588
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And what's that?

589
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,640
It's an RPG called Emerald Dragon.

590
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,720
Well, I don't see that really happening because have you seen any game on virtual console

591
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,520
kind of go back and be tinkered with at all?

592
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,720
I can only think of Pokemon Snap because it saves pictures to your thing or your Wii board

593
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
or whatever it's called.

594
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,720
But Sapphire.

595
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,720
Sapphire needs to come out.

596
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,520
I don't think they've translated a single game yet.

597
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,040
Sapphire's a shooter.

598
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,720
And I think I might have done Sapphire as a classic game.

599
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
I might have.

600
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,720
I'll have to check.

601
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:08,360
But it was one of the first with real-time 3D objects in the game.

602
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,280
You know, on a 16-bit system.

603
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,280
Nice.

604
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,440
So yeah, Sapphire is an amazing little shooter.

605
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,600
And then I'd also like to see Psychic Storm.

606
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,680
Well, that's the game that Dan calls I Get Pissed Off.

607
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,440
He was saying, Psychic Storm?

608
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,400
But Dan sounds like they're saying I Get Pissed Off.

609
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,480
And Ray Iannami says, the only game that's had any translation is Sin and Punishment.

610
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,640
And even then, it was only menu text.

611
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,320
I did think of another one, though.

612
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
Tecmo Bowl.

613
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
They went back and screwed with that because they had to take out all the stuff that was

614
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,320
licensed originally.

615
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,320
Remember that?

616
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,360
So they have gone in and altered with ROMs, but very, very rarely.

617
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,860
So anyhow, we will see what happens with this release.

618
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,860
Maybe who knows?

619
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,200
Maybe tomorrow, by the time you guys hear this podcast, it could already be out.

620
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,800
I mean, when they say shortly, that could mean Monday.

621
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
So we'll see.

622
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,800
Dark Sakura, what's up next?

623
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:58,520
Well, I was actually going to look for the, see if I had covered it, but in other news,

624
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:05,880
something about Satoru Iwata, who is the Nintendo president, he's not impressed by the iPad.

625
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,580
Yes, the iPad happened this week.

626
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,040
We didn't really, I think everybody's heard.

627
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,040
This is the show.

628
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,040
Yes.

629
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,160
The iPad is coming out and everybody is, well, not everybody.

630
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,160
I just didn't see it.

631
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,400
Did it say that it was coming with a stylus or something?

632
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,400
No.

633
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,840
I'm criticizing it because it looks like a giant iPhone.

634
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
At least that's me.

635
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
I am criticizing it for that reason.

636
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,960
I would only want one if I could draw on it, you know, if it was like carrying around a

637
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,960
Cintiq.

638
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,760
I will say though, some of the art stuff on that did look very cool.

639
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,200
I could see like, like some of the art playing looked really cool.

640
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,760
And I got to say, I really liked the calendar that they showed in it.

641
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,920
Like I thought the calendar seemed really robust and I could really use that, but I'm

642
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,200
not paying $4.99 or whatever, and that's not even with 3G.

643
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,240
I'll tell you, actually, you know what would, what would make me buy that, Rob?

644
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,240
What's that?

645
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,280
Um, it costs the same as a Kindle and does more, and I can run my Kindle app on it.

646
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,600
I bet you the cost does come down, but you know Apple, in a year there'll be an iPad

647
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,920
2 or an iPad 2.0 or whatever.

648
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,240
I see myself getting one if I can actually use it for real art stuff, but I digress.

649
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,240
Will Loki be getting an iPad just out of curiosity?

650
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,240
No.

651
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,240
Okay.

652
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,800
So much he could say, but he just, he just keeps it classy.

653
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,080
Uh, I, I'm sorry.

654
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,720
Did you watch the press conference out of curiosity?

655
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,100
I watched the live, the live blogging of it, and I laughed.

656
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,600
I'm like, wow.

657
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,840
So people do realize this is just an iPod touch, but bigger, right?

658
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,840
Slightly faster processor.

659
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:35,360
Whoa, a blazing fast 1 GHz processor, oh my god, that's blazing fast like years ago.

660
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,000
I guess for a handheld that's blazing fast.

661
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,040
Let's let Jamie get back to the story, but I do want to say real quick, um, the only

662
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,200
thing to take me off about it too, one of the, it doesn't multitask.

663
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,200
Like come on.

664
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,480
A computer doesn't all tab, you know, so shiny and beautiful rub cause that's what people

665
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,420
buy Apple products for us because they're beautiful.

666
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,680
It's just like my wife.

667
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,680
Perfect example.

668
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:59,280
We went to go get a new camera cause my camera, whatever it's, let me go get you a drink,

669
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,280
Jamie.

670
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,280
I'm sorry.

671
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,280
I have one.

672
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,520
It didn't, uh, is it strong enough?

673
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,640
It doesn't hold a charge anymore for whatever reason.

674
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,640
So what did my wife do?

675
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,000
I want the red camera.

676
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,720
She's the perfect Mac Apple product buyer right there.

677
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,040
I want the red one.

678
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,640
You are incorrect, sir.

679
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,240
Any good graphic artist is going to primarily go for a Mac.

680
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,240
Great.

681
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,240
I hope you have a lot of art programs on the iPhone because that's the only apps that can

682
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,240
run.

683
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,240
I have Photoshop.

684
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,240
Oh, I'm sorry.

685
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,240
I don't think that's on the iPhone.

686
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,240
Yes it is.

687
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,560
Well that's a pretty piss poor version then.

688
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:39,160
It's basically just for editing photos taken, but it actually has pretty good image cleaner

689
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,160
in there.

690
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,160
I like it.

691
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:47,640
I don't, I, I have real Photoshop to actually fix my photos, but back to my story, please.

692
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,640
Yes.

693
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:54,160
As I was saying, you know, basically Iwata agrees with Loki.

694
00:31:54,160 --> 00:32:00,000
It's a bigger, I, you know, iPod touch, whatever.

695
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,840
Um, he also doesn't like 3d gaming very much, uh, he did like avatar, which I've seen twice

696
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,840
now.

697
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:13,320
Um, and they're actually looking on the, um, effects of help, um, by playing video games

698
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,480
over a long period of time instead of watching movies, seeing what the differences are.

699
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:25,720
Um, I guess, um, and then, um, he also, uh, doesn't really care, you know, about, he doesn't

700
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,580
think people just want to wear those silly looking glasses to play their video games.

701
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:39,440
And also he said that, um, the next DS would not have motion sensor and there's no HD Wii.

702
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,520
He doesn't think that people would pay money for it.

703
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,260
Oh, Iwata.

704
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,800
Poor special boy.

705
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:52,240
Maybe we should put him in the, um, the, uh, crayon eating camp.

706
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,040
I'm not ready to put him there yet because whether we like it or not, the Wii is really

707
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,240
kicking ass when it comes to sales and so forth.

708
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,760
So maybe he just has the bicycle helmet?

709
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,600
We have to remember Nintendo doesn't only care about the core gamer.

710
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:10,360
They care about the soccer moms and kicking ass and Logie's wife sales console sales,

711
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:14,760
but software sales, they suck except for first party Nintendo product.

712
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,760
That's okay.

713
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,700
Nintendo has given me what I want.

714
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,700
I love this.

715
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,700
I'm holding it in my hand.

716
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,700
Tatsunoko versus Capcom.

717
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:26,320
Well Capcom gave you that, but it's on Wii, so they had to license it.

718
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,320
Um, I love this too, this comment in chat, tiger clot in our chat room chat that orange

719
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,640
sounds radio.com says, but guys think about it.

720
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,760
You can listen to OLR on a bigger screen with the all games app.

721
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,200
Yeah, that's bigger screens really going to help you with a radio app.

722
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,200
Think about it.

723
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,400
And you can't even put the thing in your pocket because it's so huge.

724
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,560
You can kind of put it like under your shirt, like maybe, maybe they need to come out with

725
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,740
a girdle with a pocket or something that you could carry your iPad under your shirt.

726
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,740
You know what's sad?

727
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,740
What?

728
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:58,240
The 4G 3.5 gigahertz processor probably could go into an iPhone.

729
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,240
And maybe it will.

730
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,040
There'll be a new iPhone this year too, I'm sure.

731
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,040
Exactly.

732
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,280
And then once you bought your iPad, then the 4G version will come out and you'll have to

733
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,280
pay.

734
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,520
I've told you what, the reason I want one.

735
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:13,880
I want it instead of a Kindle because it'll do what the Kindle does plus some other crap.

736
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,160
And I use my Kindle app on my iPhone.

737
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:21,120
Um, Game Guru says, remember this is coming from the guy who's marketing a bigger DSI.

738
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,240
He knows this stuff.

739
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,840
How's the DSI in Excel any different from the iPad?

740
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,840
It's not.

741
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,640
It's, it's, it's equally retarded, okay?

742
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,000
Maybe he's just jealous.

743
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,960
Actually, I gotta say, some people that I've heard that have played with that thing really

744
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,960
enjoy it.

745
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,640
They say it does make a big difference.

746
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,240
I don't know how, but that's just what I'm hearing.

747
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,520
Are they also the people that dial the, you know, big number phones, you know?

748
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,840
They have one of those oversized phones.

749
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,720
My fingers don't hit the buttons.

750
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,920
I hit one button and it hits both of them.

751
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,520
The kind Grandma has to have so she can see the numbers.

752
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,640
The ones that are like, you know, it looks like someone put Post-Its where the numbers

753
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,640
are.

754
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,640
You could use your whole fist to hit a button.

755
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,800
You should have whack-a-mole phones, that'd be awesome.

756
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,800
Nice.

757
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,400
Alright, how about some different gaming news, Loki?

758
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,680
I'm gonna open a window in here, by the way.

759
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,680
It's hot in the studio.

760
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,680
It's gettin' hot.

761
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,680
It's gettin' hot.

762
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,160
Is it hot in here, or is it just me?

763
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,160
It's just stuffy.

764
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:23,080
Yes, apparently there's a new Pokemon game coming out, and when I say new, I don't mean

765
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:27,600
HeartGold and SoulSilver, because those aren't really new, they're just kind of remade.

766
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:32,280
But there's basically gonna be a new game, I guess a new main entry game, as they would

767
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:37,640
call it, which will probably have, you know, two games and then one that compiles both

768
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,040
of them together that they'll release later on that people will buy anyways.

769
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:47,920
I didn't say when it's coming out, but sometime in 2010, it's gonna be seeing a release in

770
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,320
Japan, most likely probably holiday, because usually they'll have Pokemon games that come

771
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,720
out around April or November, so.

772
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:02,440
And I believe the April one is HeartGold, except this year it's, you know, March.

773
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,640
So are we gonna go online with this now?

774
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,140
I mean, I know they do, isn't there like the trading room over Wi-Fi or something, a very

775
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:13,520
limited kind of online app that you were able to do in the last one?

776
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,280
I don't know, Pokemon to me is like- When's Pokemon just gonna be an MMO already?

777
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,000
I mean, Nintendo is sitting on a goldmine, a Pokemon MMO I think would be huge.

778
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,880
But you don't want to embrace online.

779
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,880
Ugh.

780
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,880
So like, they won't.

781
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,960
There's one of those things they get a third party to do, seriously.

782
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,200
There are, I bet there's some MMO developers out there that would like, they would suck

783
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:36,640
Nintendo's cock in order to be able to put out the Pokemon MMO and get money off of that.

784
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,880
I mean, that is just a goldmine waiting to happen.

785
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,600
But Rob, then people wouldn't buy Pokemon games.

786
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,600
That's not true.

787
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:49,080
Just because World of Warcraft is doing amazingly well, you don't think like Starcraft 2 and

788
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,240
Diablo 3 are gonna sell well, and if they wanted to put out a Warcraft 4 you don't think

789
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,240
that would sell?

790
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,480
They'd still sell.

791
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,480
They'd still sell.

792
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,240
I don't know.

793
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,880
AzureEdsInChat says, Sky, we'd have to enter one million friend codes, I don't wanna fucking

794
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,880
do that.

795
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,880
Good point.

796
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,280
I don't know.

797
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,520
I'm showing Rob Sapphire.

798
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,680
I don't think you've done that as a game of the week, you're gonna need to some week.

799
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,480
I don't know, check the, I mean, it's been a long time, but we'll see.

800
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,600
Yeah, so, new Pokemon game coming from Nintendo that's like saying, oh look, there's gonna

801
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,920
be another Mario game coming from Nintendo.

802
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,160
I have done Sapphire.

803
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,160
When?

804
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,160
Episode 326.

805
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,960
That wasn't that long ago, that was about six months ago.

806
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,200
After I did Starblade and before Donkey Kong Jr.

807
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,280
I'm just getting old, I have bad memory, what can I say.

808
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,440
Yet here I am, clamoring for a Pokemon MMO, what's wrong with me?

809
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,480
Anyway, how about another type of MMO of sorts, at least this was one of the original MMOs,

810
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,480
but was it-

811
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:51,320
And we know that MMOs just draw kids across country to their, you know, pedophile friends.

812
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,960
So that's why they wouldn't do it because, you know, you'd hear the PR, you know, news

813
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:00,600
wire go out about some kid that went across country to find their friend and it ends up

814
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:05,680
being some 40 year old dude that really likes Pokemon and touching little kids.

815
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,860
If Nintendo actually sat down to think about it, there's a way to do it.

816
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:14,080
You could do friend codes maybe for just the people that you talk to and party with, especially

817
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:18,440
if you're like under a certain age, but you could still at least interact in a certain

818
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:23,940
capacity, maybe using pre- like that's how the Disney MMOs do it, there's like pre-phrases

819
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,340
that are in there, even the Phantasy Star games have that to some extent, the already

820
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:31,080
put in phrases that you would communicate with.

821
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,440
If you maybe, especially if you were under a certain age.

822
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,520
Or just an animal crossing MMO.

823
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,160
Well look, anyway, hello back to a classic MMO, Ultima!

824
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,840
Remember Ultima Online?

825
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,680
I think it's still kicking after all these years too, Ultima Online I believe is still

826
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,680
going.

827
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,680
They got a graphical upgrade a couple years ago.

828
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,480
Of course Ultima was a huge series of role playing games before that, I believe there

829
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,640
was nine games?

830
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,640
So there was-

831
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,640
I think so.

832
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,640
I think so.

833
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,280
I don't remember, but I do know that, you know, some of the early ones I remember from

834
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:05,960
my childhood, I actually had on NES, I had Ultima 4, and I used to rant Ultima 3 all

835
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:09,000
the time, so I know those were big games back in the day.

836
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,680
Well, and Ultima has a very, very rabid fan base, and guess what, EA is apparently bringing

837
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:20,720
out a new Ultima game, but don't get too excited because it's not quite what you think.

838
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:25,600
It's called Lord of Ultima, and it's a game where you build your own unique city, and

839
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:30,640
you play with thousands of other players, and yeah, it doesn't sound like it's really

840
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,600
like a role playing kind of game at all, it sounds almost more like, I don't know, Civilization

841
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,520
or something, which not that Civ's a bad thing, but they kind of took the Ultima out of Ultima,

842
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,760
I don't know.

843
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,400
So yeah, take with it what you will, I guess it would be hard to know until we actually

844
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,560
get our hands on it, but this is their idea on how to revive the Ultima franchise is to

845
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,800
give us Lord of Ultima.

846
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,800
That's silly.

847
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,680
How about just like a really kick ass Ultima console game?

848
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:01,640
I don't know, I guess the tricky thing about Ultima is that it really was more, it wasn't

849
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,600
like a Final Fantasy type of role playing game, you know, where you hit a button to

850
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:09,240
attack and all that, it was very, like you really, even on the NES one, dude, you had

851
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,000
to like micromanage the food that your people were eating to make sure they weren't going

852
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,200
to die of starvation, you had all these status effects that could happen, like your people

853
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,640
could die, or they could just straight up turn to ash, and you can't revive someone

854
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,640
who's turned to ash.

855
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,320
I mean, it's, it kind of kicks up the ante a little bit.

856
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,560
It's a tougher game to manage, but rewarding.

857
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,160
You know, you know what type of game I think would make a fun MMO?

858
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,160
What's that?

859
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,160
I was thinking about it.

860
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,200
Actraiser, where everyone plays God.

861
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,720
That would be a little bit confusing at some point, I don't know.

862
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,560
And then like, you have Holy Wars and shit for Sky Cake.

863
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,560
Nice.

864
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,560
Okay.

865
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,120
Well, how about another story?

866
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,440
How about Borderlands?

867
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,560
Which is what my husband was playing this morning.

868
00:40:51,560 --> 00:41:00,560
So, the secret armory of General Knox is the next download content to be coming out.

869
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:10,880
And it's supposed to have, like, really cool new enemies and a big new place to hang out.

870
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:18,000
And I really have to say that if it's anything like the island of Dr. Ned, then it's going

871
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
to be fun.

872
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It's going to be pretty great.

873
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,720
So, they're raising the level cap.

874
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,000
We don't know how much, but it's raising the level cap.

875
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,120
And right now it's at 50.

876
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,800
So, maybe they'll get legendary mounts next.

877
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:37,320
How about instead of an add-on like the island of Dr. Ned, we get the island of Dr. Brain.

878
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,600
Because that was an amazing game.

879
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,840
The island of Dr. Ned involved a lot of brains.

880
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,840
I see.

881
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,760
Involved timed headshots that would make the zombies.

882
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,200
You had to, I'm not going to say why you had to collect the brains, but it was pretty funny.

883
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,920
But, like, you had to get headshots on all the zombies to make their brains pop out of

884
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,040
their head, and then you would collect their brains.

885
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,200
And as you turned in your brains, like, your first mission is brains.

886
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,320
Your second mission is brains.

887
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,460
Your third mission is brains.

888
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,720
Like the A's would keep increasing.

889
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,440
It was pretty funny.

890
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,580
And yeah.

891
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:19,720
Let's travel around the world while Jamie goes and eats some brains.

892
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,640
Or maybe some of these yummy potato chips like that.

893
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,080
I would love some pita chips.

894
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,080
Walgreens.

895
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,520
These pita chips, yes, thank you.

896
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,840
Ah, yes.

897
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:34,680
This week is kind of the calm before the storm as far as releases go.

898
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:38,480
Not a lot of good stuff coming out, unfortunately.

899
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,840
So instead we have-

900
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,160
Bite your tongue.

901
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,160
Bite your tongue.

902
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,440
White Knight Chronicles is this week.

903
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,440
Oh, that's right.

904
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,800
Well, I said not a lot of good stuff.

905
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,800
One title-

906
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,800
Sorry, I'm choking on a pita chip.

907
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,040
I'm sorry, two titles do not a good week make.

908
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:58,760
Anyways, so, Imagine Reporter, coming out on DS, whoopity shit.

909
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,120
Star Trek Online, though, is making it out this week, both the collector's edition and

910
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,680
the regular edition.

911
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,940
White Knight Chronicles on PlayStation 3 coming out, and that wraps up the good games coming

912
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,940
out this week.

913
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:13,280
And also Family Party 30 Great Games Winter Fun on the Wii.

914
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:20,680
The Sims 3 high-end lost stuff, if you want to buy more crap for your fake people.

915
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,280
And that would be it.

916
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,800
All right.

917
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:33,680
Sorry, I'm playing around in chat room because somebody said, or it was Azurette, did someone

918
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:40,660
say pita chips, but spelled it P-E-T-A, like the people eating tasty animals.

919
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,040
And then I tried to slap them, but I accidentally slapped the wrong person in chat, so there

920
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,040
we go.

921
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,240
I gave the right person a slap there in the chat room.

922
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,240
Anyway, hey, how about Japan and looking at the Japanese releases?

923
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,360
I don't know if there's any games in Japan where you can slap people yet.

924
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,440
We might need to let Shermie out.

925
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,200
Shermie's headed towards the door and wants to- there we go.

926
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,200
Bye, Shermie.

927
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,200
All right.

928
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,200
Sorry.

929
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,520
Shermie's a cat, by the way, that I'm talking to.

930
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:10,440
Hey, looking at the release dates over in Japan, kind of a slow week over there.

931
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,320
Well, I guess they do have a new Star Ocean game.

932
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,320
That's a pretty big deal.

933
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,840
On the PS3, that's Star Ocean The Last Hope, but that's the international version, so I'm

934
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:21,240
assuming it's kind of like they did with some of the Final Fantasy games where it's the

935
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,240
US version redone.

936
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:27,940
It's the US version with more- I think there's more language options.

937
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,200
And honestly, that is really it.

938
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:37,240
I mean, there's another game on the PS2 called Momo Tuji Taisen Ryoku 2 coming from System

939
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:41,480
Soft that looks to be some type of adventure game.

940
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,760
I don't know if it's just- there's little cute little animals there and that poor girl's

941
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,280
sitting in a cardboard box.

942
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,400
I don't know why, but I guess it's about a bunch of homeless chicks with big boobs.

943
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,400
I don't know.

944
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,400
No, they're all planes.

945
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,400
Did you notice that they're all planes?

946
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,400
Oh, they're planes.

947
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,520
They are.

948
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,240
Are these- oh, these girls must like turn into planes or something, right?

949
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,240
It's just weird.

950
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,240
Yeah.

951
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,800
Oh, the Japanese and their fetishes.

952
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,800
That is so strange.

953
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,320
Her ass is a cardboard box.

954
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,320
Look at that.

955
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,560
I gotta link that in chat there.

956
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,560
She's a hobo plane.

957
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,240
I'll paste the link there.

958
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,560
I'm gonna paste that in chat so you guys can check that out and see if it's a weird deal.

959
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,600
Alright, so that's on the PlayStation 2.

960
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,240
So they are still cranking out the PS2 games over there.

961
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:27,840
And on the Sony PSP, God Eater comes out.

962
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,000
Well, that sounds rather pleasant on the PSP.

963
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,800
I don't know if that- is that local?

964
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,120
Is that a- some type of game we have here?

965
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,120
I think it's based off of manga.

966
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,120
Yeah.

967
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,120
Oh, it is.

968
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,960
Looks like a- It's a fighting game.

969
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,920
Yeah, kind of a fighting game, but you can take on multiple things at once.

970
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:46,920
Pretty cool.

971
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,920
Yeah.

972
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,840
And that's it for Japanese release dates.

973
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,840
How about the UK?

974
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:51,840
Jamie?

975
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,920
Well, for the third, we have Chime on Xbox 360.

976
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,680
And then the fifth, we have a number of things.

977
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,840
We have Dante's Inferno.

978
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:05,700
We have Disgaea 2, Dark Hero Days, Endless Ocean 2, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles,

979
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:15,520
The Crystal Bearers, MX vs. ATV Reflex, Stalker Call of Pripyat, Silent Hill Shattered Memories.

980
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,560
Please everybody, it's not- it's not Silent Hill as you know it.

981
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,720
If you like running, you'll love Silent Hill Shattered Memories.

982
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,920
If you like a lot of frustrating fucking trial and error, then you'll like it.

983
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,920
You just run.

984
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,120
They should've- they should've- this is kind of funny.

985
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,640
They should've combined Walk It Out with Silent Hill Shattered Memories.

986
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,560
Wouldn't that be hilarious?

987
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,680
Well, last on my list is the best on the list.

988
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,680
Star Trek Online.

989
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,520
Um, I have already been playing it.

990
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:45,200
It is tons of fun, um, although now that the beta's over, I have to remake my fucking character.

991
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,440
Yeah, but you should've known that was coming.

992
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,440
Well, yeah.

993
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,880
Actually, I didn't have to when I played, um, Ragnarok Online.

994
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:52,960
Oh, buh-bye.

995
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,960
They saved the character data on a separate server so that when you start the game, you

996
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:56,960
have your character attack.

997
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:57,960
Did you like the ship combat?

998
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,960
I didn't like it.

999
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,960
I didn't like the camera in it.

1000
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:00,960
Yeah.

1001
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,680
But they're supposed to, um, have been implementing, um, cause I've been giving a lot of feedback

1002
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,680
on the dev forum.

1003
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:10,240
They're supposed to be, um, doing a way to lock- cause my whole problem was that you

1004
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,600
couldn't lock the camera behind your ship.

1005
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:19,680
That really pissed me off, because it really- your controls were always justified by your

1006
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:26,880
ship, but if you were not- if you were, like, looking at your ship sideways, you could not

1007
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,600
turn it around, adjust your camera, do anything without it trying to readjust itself based

1008
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,280
on where your enemy was, and it would never lock on the enemy when you were close by.

1009
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:43,720
So it'd be like, um, I'm trying to shoot these, uh, Borg, um, I'm trying to shoot these, uh,

1010
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,720
whatever they are.

1011
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,080
Um, I did, though, I really liked the away missions.

1012
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,080
Those were fun.

1013
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:54,920
Yeah, the- I liked it when you were on the world, kind of in the- as the player, but

1014
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:55,920
I didn't care for the-

1015
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,240
I liked the one mission, I don't know if you did it, it was one of your emergency missions,

1016
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,760
where you have to go and talk to these miners, and you find out why they're so pissed off

1017
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,760
at their boss.

1018
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,760
No.

1019
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,560
I think it was- it was such a great thing that it had, like, diplomatic missions and

1020
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,880
little things in there, stuff that, you know, I'm sure Starfleet officers have to do all

1021
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:12,880
the time.

1022
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,440
I played through the whole Borg opening, and then I did a couple other missions, like,

1023
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,520
I remember going on some ship to get the- like, get- like, kill a bunch of guys that

1024
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,840
were trying to infiltrate the ship and get on the ship and get the people out.

1025
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,480
They would follow me, kind of, to the exit.

1026
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,480
Yeah.

1027
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,360
Yeah, that was- and then more bad guys were showing up, so I was running out.

1028
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:32,080
Well, the missions that I- I was actually on the way to the- whatever the mission was

1029
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:37,720
near Vulcan or something, and you get emergency missions sometimes on your way as you pass

1030
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:41,920
by other places, although really what- the first thing I'm gonna freakin' do as soon

1031
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,600
as my ship is up to it is go hang out at DS9 for a while.

1032
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,600
It's in there!

1033
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,600
It's in there!

1034
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,600
Did you know?

1035
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,600
That's nice.

1036
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,600
No, I didn't know that.

1037
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,600
That's great.

1038
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,600
There's a video up of someone actually trying to go through the wormhole.

1039
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,600
I think it was funny.

1040
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,600
Awesome.

1041
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,280
All right, well, what's up next?

1042
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,280
Back to some gaming news.

1043
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:04,000
I just totally made myself an utter geek.

1044
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,580
I know.

1045
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:11,000
You know, I wanna, like, uh, play Star Trek Online and then just kill all the creatures.

1046
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,280
You know how they- do they have any diplomatic away missions where you're supposed to not

1047
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,520
kill things, and then if you do, that's bad?

1048
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,480
I think those you just are actually set to talk to them, because you can't actually fire

1049
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:23,400
at someone who's not an enemy, but you should totally play a Klingon.

1050
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,400
That's unfortunate.

1051
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,360
You should totally play a Klingon.

1052
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,400
See, that's what I do in Spore, is just kill people.

1053
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,680
Oh, wait, no, I don't do that in Spore, because I don't play Spore anymore.

1054
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,680
That's right.

1055
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:39,080
You should just totally play a Klingon, then you can call your commanding officer, uh,

1056
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:42,640
you know, a coward, and then kill him and take his position.

1057
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:47,160
And you know what Spore has to do with this next, uh, story they have?

1058
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,560
Well, both of them have DRM.

1059
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:53,960
Ubisoft is now introducing a new online-enabled DRM for their PC games.

1060
00:49:53,960 --> 00:50:00,960
Um, basically, you're gonna be able to install the game on, um, you know, whatever PCs you

1061
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,960
want.

1062
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:08,600
You just have to be connected to, um, the internet in order to be logged into your Ubi.com

1063
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:13,440
account to play the games, even if you wanna just play, uh, single-player games.

1064
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,680
Uh, sounds wonderful and all, but somehow I have a feeling that they're gonna get around

1065
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:23,920
it just as easy as they got around the DRM on the EA games, but hey, I guess that's neat.

1066
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,120
And stuff that they don't limit you to how many PCs you can install your stuff onto,

1067
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:34,000
but you know, some people out there don't have internet access or don't have broadband

1068
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,880
internet access, but I guess those people won't be buying those Ubisoft games.

1069
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,500
Just hopefully they make it very clear, um, on there.

1070
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:49,280
But um, I guess, uh, this is kinda similar to some of the Steam games that they have

1071
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:54,000
out there now that they require that you're logged in, um, to the internet.

1072
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,960
But I guess that's not true for all Steam games?

1073
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,840
I don't know.

1074
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,280
Well, here's the question.

1075
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,680
I mean, I understand these gaming companies have to do whatever they have to do to try

1076
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,880
and curb piracy because it's getting way out of control, especially on PC games, it's so

1077
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:07,880
easy.

1078
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,920
But, um, you know, there's always somebody gonna play that card, like, okay, well, if

1079
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,920
you require an internet connection to validate the game, what happens to the military guys

1080
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:20,880
overseas who don't have an internet connection and these computer games are a way that they

1081
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,720
can, you know, de-stress in downtime?

1082
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:29,180
That card always gets played somehow, so what is, I mean, any DRM scheme has to kinda take

1083
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:32,960
that stuff into consideration is, you know, there are some people who legitimately don't

1084
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,840
have internet and are trying to legitimately play games.

1085
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,440
Could they call an 800 number?

1086
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,440
I mean, I don't know.

1087
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,440
What would happen?

1088
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:44,480
I think it's not, they're not gonna be able to call an 800 number and really what's gonna

1089
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:52,200
come down to is any DRM scheme that you have out there, really there's no way that you're

1090
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:58,320
gonna be able to ensure that people aren't stealing your product because there's always

1091
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:02,780
gonna be a way around everything, whether it be, you know, some extremes I can see them

1092
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:08,080
going to is a physical dongle that you have to stick into your USB drive or something

1093
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:12,080
like that that authenticates your, you know, copy that you have and you can't play unless

1094
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,640
that's plugged in there.

1095
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:19,280
They do that with some software programs out there, but it's very rare and even those can

1096
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:25,400
be emulated or, you know, copied and, you know, nothing's perfect.

1097
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,720
Well here's what Frisbee in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com and just makes

1098
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,960
a very clear statement.

1099
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,280
Frisbee says DRM will always be cracked.

1100
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,280
Give it up.

1101
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,280
Agree?

1102
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,280
Yeah.

1103
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:45,640
Really, and even DLC can be cracked and always is, so you just can't win in the PC market.

1104
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:49,520
You just have to, you know, hope that most people aren't pirating your stuff.

1105
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,380
Or you're putting it out at a price that makes it worth it.

1106
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:53,380
I don't know.

1107
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:54,380
Yeah.

1108
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:57,620
Steam, you know, Steam's a great service and a lot of people, you know, purchase stuff

1109
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:59,640
on Steam because it's very convenient.

1110
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:04,440
It's all in one, you know, spot, but there's people that are gonna pirate games that are

1111
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:09,080
gonna pirate games and there's nothing really stopping them because, you know, as soon as

1112
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:14,480
you tell somebody, oh this is, you know, if, you know, if it's something that's gonna inconvenience

1113
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:19,320
somebody, you know, whether it be, you know, requiring a disk or you have to be online

1114
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:24,800
or you have to install this, you know, some sort of rootkit on your system in order for

1115
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,560
it to work, someone's getting pissed off and trying to hack it around.

1116
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,400
Some more comments from chat and Frisbee makes another point here.

1117
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,920
What happens to the servers, or what happens when the servers, when they crap out?

1118
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,760
So if these servers that authenticate the games or whatever, what happens if they die?

1119
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,040
They're gonna send out a patch and it'll probably remove the DRM from the game.

1120
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:48,280
What if, what if all the servers, well that's, that's Steam's contingency plan, supposedly.

1121
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:51,420
If Steam were to ever disappear, they would do that.

1122
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:55,400
But that isn't the same thing that Ubisoft has necessarily said, I don't know.

1123
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,160
Ray Iannami says, if I was a developer, I'd just say fuck it to DRM and just put in a

1124
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:02,640
finger wagging message that says, while we thank you for your interest in this game,

1125
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,480
we would appreciate it if you buy a legitimate copy if possible.

1126
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,880
You know, I have to admit, I always did like the kind of gotcha thing that some of those

1127
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,520
Super Nintendo games did.

1128
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,520
Like, what was it?

1129
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:19,160
One of those games, if you were playing like a hacked version, Earthbound, would be way

1130
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,160
harder.

1131
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,320
Like if you were playing like a pirated copy of Earthbound, it would be way harder.

1132
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:26,120
And then when you get to the very last boss, it deletes your save game.

1133
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,440
Like that's just evil, but kind of funny in a way.

1134
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,560
I mean, if somebody's pirating it, they can't complain at what the game did.

1135
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:36,040
I mean, it might make them really pissed off so they never actually buy the game legitimately.

1136
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:40,800
But just kind of, most people didn't know that that kind of prevention was in there

1137
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,280
until it was too late.

1138
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,520
Frisbee continues and says DRM does nothing to stop piracy.

1139
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,140
Just screws over real players.

1140
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:51,160
What pirate would keep DRM in the game?

1141
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:55,220
The other thing too, DRM, especially if it's not made in-house, although Oobies might be

1142
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:58,960
made in-house or they may be licensed, I don't know if they're licensing it from somebody

1143
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,960
else.

1144
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,840
But I mean, that costs these companies money too.

1145
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:07,640
So if it's just going to get defeated like immediately, then you might as well just save

1146
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:13,440
the money and just not have it, you know, cracked or just not have the DRM in there.

1147
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,480
Just save whatever, at least I'm going to save myself, you know, X amount of thousands

1148
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,480
of dollars.

1149
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:23,280
Uh, D5T in chat kind of half jokes here, next gen consoles will need a pin drop of your

1150
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,400
blood to start the game up.

1151
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,560
Well hey, don't they already have laptops now that are like fingerprints or something?

1152
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,560
Biometric scanner.

1153
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,560
Yeah.

1154
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:36,280
As that technology comes down, maybe not your blood, but your fingerprint, who knows?

1155
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,280
Could you imagine that?

1156
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,960
You had to, you have to press your fingerprint in order to start a game?

1157
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:44,960
Well why don't they look at, well, I guess, I was going to say why don't they look at

1158
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:51,360
how, you know, console games are doing DRM and stuff like that, you know, why don't they

1159
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:55,000
look at that and try to kind of match something that they're doing there?

1160
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I don't know.

1161
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,360
A decipher in chat reminds us, um, I think speaking of my whole little earthbound story

1162
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,400
there, that happened with a recent release of a game.

1163
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,140
A guy complained in the forums of a bug and it outed him as a pirate.

1164
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:07,520
That was an Arkham Asylum, wasn't it?

1165
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:13,760
Like there was some type of trick that Batman would, couldn't do in the copied version and

1166
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,200
somebody went to the forums to complain about it and it, it, that's how they knew that he

1167
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,080
pirated the game.

1168
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:22,200
That's, I mean, at the same time, I mean, I kind of look at that and go, that's kind

1169
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,200
of funny.

1170
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,760
I mean, they're within the rights to do that.

1171
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,600
They did the same thing with Grand Theft Auto IV.

1172
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:30,480
You'd have the drunk cam on all the time if you, you know, pirate the game so your camera

1173
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,140
would be shaking around like you're drunk.

1174
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:36,120
But there was like a patch within like a week, you know, of it coming out that fixed that.

1175
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,360
And you know, same with the Arkham Asylum stuff.

1176
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:43,640
There was a patch already fixing that problem, you know, within a week or so.

1177
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:48,320
And it's just not going to really matter.

1178
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,400
Everybody's going to find a way around it no matter what you do.

1179
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:55,720
So you might as well just give up because, you know, all you're doing is laying the inevitable

1180
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,720
and wasting money.

1181
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:01,280
All right, well, let's move on to one more story here before we get to the classic game

1182
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,280
of the week.

1183
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:06,200
And this has to do with what I believe will be a highly anticipated game.

1184
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:10,600
Hopefully this doesn't get pirated too much though because this is some real A-list talent

1185
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,600
behind this.

1186
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,360
It's the folks at Platinum Games.

1187
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:16,120
If I'm not mistaken, Platinum Games actually did Bayonetta recently.

1188
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,120
Yes, they did.

1189
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,120
They were the minds behind that.

1190
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,200
They were developed by Devil May Cry Dude.

1191
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,500
We had a new game announced this week.

1192
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:26,560
It's from Platinum Games but the mastermind behind this is Shinji Mikami and he's the

1193
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,360
guy behind Resident Evil.

1194
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,520
The game looks awesome.

1195
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,240
It's called Vanquish is the game that Loki is referring to.

1196
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,960
Vanquish appears to be a futuristic shooter game.

1197
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:40,720
I guess it takes place in San Francisco so kind of not that far from here.

1198
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:46,800
I guess it's in the future and well, obviously there's not a lot known about the actual game

1199
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:47,800
itself.

1200
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,960
The trailer used a bunch of cut scenes and live action stuff.

1201
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:54,680
Did you actually watch the whole debut on TV or the YouTube trailer?

1202
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,680
I watched the trailer though.

1203
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,680
Yeah?

1204
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:57,680
What did you think?

1205
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,680
I think it looks cool.

1206
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,680
I'm definitely excited for it.

1207
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,360
It looks like something that will be on the next gen consoles.

1208
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,840
Not a Wii game.

1209
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,360
But even their Wii game, Madworld, is pretty awesome.

1210
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:13,960
Unfortunately, not a lot of people play mature games on the Wii which is really sad but really

1211
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,400
sweet game.

1212
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:19,040
I think for Platinum Games what they really should do on some of these mature titles that

1213
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,920
they put out for the Wii is just re-release them on the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.

1214
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,120
I think that would be a great idea.

1215
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:29,120
Madworld, port that sucker with high definition graphics to the 360.

1216
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:32,320
It would sell like crazy.

1217
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,640
So you don't have the motion controls in there.

1218
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:34,640
Big deal.

1219
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,800
Just use something with the right analog stick or something.

1220
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:37,800
I don't know.

1221
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,680
It would be pretty awesome.

1222
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,760
But this new game looks really cool.

1223
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,720
I'm looking forward to hearing a little bit more about it.

1224
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,680
Yeah because we don't even know what platform it's on.

1225
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:53,600
We can assume like Bayonetta it will be PS3 and 360 but we don't know that for sure yet.

1226
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,600
And we don't know if it's going to be like multiplayer.

1227
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,960
We don't know much about that yet.

1228
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,160
But more to come soon.

1229
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,080
I imagine this is going to be an E3 All-Star right here.

1230
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,080
Probably.

1231
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,080
It's going to be something you're hearing a lot about at E3.

1232
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,560
It's called Vanquish.

1233
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:06,560
So look out for that.

1234
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,560
Obviously Bayonetta, we're huge fans of that here at OLR.

1235
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:14,760
Although this is, I mean it's still the same studio but it sounds like a different branch.

1236
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,960
So anything could happen here.

1237
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:19,040
But Outlook so far looks pretty good.

1238
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,400
I think all their Platinum games have been really good.

1239
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:30,200
It's just, I don't know, unfortunately just mature games don't do well on the Wii.

1240
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,480
That's too bad.

1241
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,960
But this one's not going to be on the Wii right?

1242
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:33,960
I hope not.

1243
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,640
I don't think it will be.

1244
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,640
It didn't look like it.

1245
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,080
Based on the graphics you saw you're thinking no right?

1246
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,080
Alright.

1247
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:45,040
Alright well let's take a trip down memory lane and some of the classics we always hear

1248
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:51,360
every week at OLR like take a trip and take a look at the classic video game of the week.

1249
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:55,360
It's a chance for Dark Soccer to go into gaming's vault and pull out a game that she thinks

1250
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,720
y'all should be checking this game out right now.

1251
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:03,000
And just a side note, I do notice, because Jamie had a game picked out last week but

1252
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
we didn't end up doing the show.

1253
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I did?

1254
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Yeah you had a game.

1255
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I don't know what I picked out.

1256
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
But you changed it.

1257
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I did?

1258
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I don't remember what I picked out last week.

1259
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,440
Do you want me to tell you or do you want to wait?

1260
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:15,640
I don't have to look.

1261
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:19,560
I'll look it up while you talk about this week's game.

1262
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,840
But I fully approve of what you've picked for this week.

1263
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:22,840
So tell our chatters.

1264
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:23,840
It's about damn time I did this one.

1265
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,320
It's about damn time.

1266
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:29,320
This week's game is Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past.

1267
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:33,080
And I would love to play the music but one of those audio difficulties I warned you about

1268
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:38,280
before the show was that some things are not installed including Flash so I can't use YouTube

1269
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,520
just yet.

1270
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:45,600
Never fear though I think I have some of the ripped files here on my drive so I'll pull

1271
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,600
those up instead.

1272
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:47,600
Sorry Jamie.

1273
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:54,560
Well in Japan it was called Zelda no Densetsu Kamigami no Toraifosu which was the Legend

1274
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:59,480
of Zelda Triforce of the Gods.

1275
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:05,920
This is arranged but still.

1276
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:13,160
Anyway it was one of the ones that was very closely worked on by Miyamoto so of course

1277
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:15,840
it was awesome.

1278
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:21,760
Anyway this is you know it's basically Link's hanging out in Hyrule you know kicking Ganon's

1279
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:28,040
ass going to the dark world and of course it's been re-released on the Game Boy Advance

1280
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,040
and on the Virtual Console.

1281
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:35,160
I just think it's so funny that like when you go into the dark world Link turns into

1282
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:40,000
a bunny because it's supposed to reflect like your innermost self or something.

1283
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,600
Yeah but I mean you had all kinds of cool attacks and you could go get the Master Sword

1284
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:50,360
by running through the forest and you could swim and just one of the big things that got

1285
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:56,840
me is because it had that sort of dual world aspect to it that you could often do things

1286
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,940
in one world that would affect the other.

1287
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:04,600
Like for example when you're going to the ice level in the dark world if you would have

1288
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:12,520
to throw your portal like in one place and then walk to a certain place in the light

1289
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:21,360
world and then use your mirror again and you would be inside the walls of the fortress.

1290
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:29,060
So that was pretty cool and I really really liked just the overall play to it and this

1291
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:32,560
is a game that I have gone back and just played a bajillion times over.

1292
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:39,680
I mean I probably have whole sections of this game completely freaking memorized.

1293
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:47,440
I was actually watching people glitching out the game today by trying to run a dash when

1294
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:54,040
you call the bird with the ocarina that I think is in the DS version.

1295
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:59,360
Yeah which reminds me there is a DS version and of course the Virtual Console version.

1296
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:12,600
But yeah the game came out for the Super Famicom in Japan and it was released in 1991 and in

1297
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:17,720
the US and Europe in 1992 and you know it was funny I'll tell you another funny thing

1298
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,920
about this one Rob.

1299
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:20,920
Is that.

1300
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:21,920
Hey look what I got.

1301
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:22,920
I got the real music here.

1302
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:23,920
Look at that.

1303
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:35,040
I'm sorry I just have to say for a minute I'm sorry Jamie I know you have more to say

1304
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:38,240
but I saw it because there's a lot of controversy going on in chat right now like some people

1305
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,120
say and I love this game so I'm saying I hate this game.

1306
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:43,760
I personally well not that they hate it but it's not the best in the series.

1307
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,240
By far my favorite Zelda game they ever put out.

1308
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:52,440
Great music great gameplay I this is by far my favorite Zelda game ever.

1309
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:53,440
Love it.

1310
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,440
I love it too.

1311
01:03:54,440 --> 01:04:03,320
Although I do really like Ocarina but now this actually there was a little bit more

1312
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,320
to this one.

1313
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:08,680
Actually did you know that there was a comic that came out.

1314
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:13,680
It was actually published in Nintendo Power and they put it out in the US too.

1315
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,320
Do you remember that Rob?

1316
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,680
The Zelda comic from Nintendo Power.

1317
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:19,680
Very vaguely.

1318
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,160
Here we go.

1319
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:26,240
There's actually a picture from it if any of that looks familiar.

1320
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:31,360
It's by the same guy who did the I think who did Howard and Esther.

1321
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:34,760
Yeah I vaguely remember it.

1322
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:40,020
Well at any rate there was another follow up to Link to the Past that came out in Japan

1323
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:46,440
it was BS Zelda no Densetsu Kodai no Sekiban which is BS The Legend of Zelda ancient stone

1324
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:51,840
tablets or stone tablets of antiquity that was one of the Satellaview games and you could

1325
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:55,240
voice broadcast using the sound link.

1326
01:04:55,240 --> 01:05:00,120
And it was supposed to be set around the same time as Link's Awakening but you don't use

1327
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:03,720
Link you play as the heroes of light.

1328
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:10,520
And who they are are the Satellaview mascots who you could also see in BS Zelda no Densetsu

1329
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:17,800
which I had the Satellaview one ran on like a time system and there are hacked ROMs out

1330
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:24,400
there where you can play with your time counter turned off.

1331
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:31,240
And then there was another version of Link to the Past that came out on Satellaview as

1332
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,240
well.

1333
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:42,640
Then of course there was Link to the Past and Four Swords there was also if I'm right

1334
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:47,000
I think they actually reserved a lot of the sound effects for Ocarina of Time and Majora's

1335
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,840
Mask so that was pretty cool.

1336
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:55,520
But that is overall I'd have to say probably my favorite in this series.

1337
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:58,640
Very worthy.

1338
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:04,480
If no one's played this game I pity you, I pity Dafuq.

1339
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,520
They'll get it on Virtual Console, seriously, at least.

1340
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:10,040
You can actually get the cart kind of cheap too.

1341
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:13,360
Just one thing to remember is it doesn't run on a battery backup so you have to be really

1342
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,360
careful.

1343
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:15,360
We still have our saved games.

1344
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:19,120
I actually this is one of the games now that I'll just sit and play with the Game Genie

1345
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:24,680
on just so I can just run through the whole game because I mean for me what I like to

1346
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:28,320
do is I like to play through the game once without cheating and then I like to just cheat

1347
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:35,160
like a mofo the second time through and just enjoy the story but even so I mean this wasn't

1348
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,160
super super hard.

1349
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,160
There were really difficult parts.

1350
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,160
This is some of my favorite music in the game right here.

1351
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,160
I love this song.

1352
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,160
In the early palaces.

1353
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,160
Sorry.

1354
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:51,120
No, I like that music too.

1355
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:57,320
I never liked the palace music from the...

1356
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:04,000
This is the forest music.

1357
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
One of the most amazing game soundtracks ever.

1358
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,120
I know a lot of people think like Final Fantasies where all the music's at but this seriously

1359
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:14,120
seriously Zelda's got just awesome music.

1360
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:19,200
Well you know the big thing actually this it's actually showing baking through the palace.

1361
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,440
I love the little touches in it like if you had the places that you could fall off the

1362
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:27,760
cliff you can make the guys charge you and they would run off the ledge or you could

1363
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:31,120
throw a pot at them and they would fall off on the ledge.

1364
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,120
You know I thought that was great.

1365
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,520
Or you could just throw a chicken off the ledge.

1366
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:37,240
Actually you know what one of my favorite levels in this one was where you go to the

1367
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:42,040
thieves village and you have to take the girl into the sunlight and she turns into blind

1368
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:43,040
the thief.

1369
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,040
That's right.

1370
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:50,680
And that was and I love the this is the game that made the hookshot replace the boomerang.

1371
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:56,440
Was it just me or was the hookshot the single best item in the damn game?

1372
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:59,120
That and the freaking medallions?

1373
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,800
Maybe I do remember the hookshot being pretty odd.

1374
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:06,880
The bombos medallion it sets the world on fire it was fantastic but yeah this totally

1375
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,600
totally totally totally my game.

1376
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:12,760
All right there it is your classic game of the week a true classic in many respects Zelda

1377
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:16,320
A Link to the Past on the Super Nintendo.

1378
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:20,160
And most surprisingly Dark Sakura picked a non-sega game this week I'm very proud.

1379
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:24,000
By the way Rob I do have something that I might be able to lend you if you've still

1380
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
got Super Nintendo.

1381
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,520
I don't know if I have a Super Nintendo still.

1382
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,280
Didn't we give you the Super Nintendo?

1383
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:30,280
No it was a regular Nintendo.

1384
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:31,280
Oh okay.

1385
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,080
In the midst of moving too is not a good time.

1386
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,080
Well I mean later.

1387
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,560
But in a month yeah.

1388
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,640
We have two copies of Super Mario RPG.

1389
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:41,800
Oh sweet sweet I need to find my copy of Super Metroid that's a game I really want to play

1390
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:42,800
again.

1391
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:43,800
Maybe we have another one?

1392
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,320
I could do the Wii console thing but you know.

1393
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:48,200
There's something about playing Super Metroid on the right system.

1394
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,440
It's having the Super Nintendo controller.

1395
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:51,440
It's having that same controller.

1396
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:54,960
Rob you need to call in sick to work and hang out with me tonight and play some Super Metroid.

1397
01:08:54,960 --> 01:09:00,960
I would love to if I could but maybe now here's the great thing when I get the place when

1398
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:05,080
I get my new place it's gonna be by myself I can set it all up without having without

1399
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:09,120
anybody complaining or having other things so you could just come over we plug in the

1400
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:12,720
system we're good to go we broadcast we can do that kind of stuff on the fly a lot easier

1401
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:13,720
it's gonna be amazing.

1402
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:14,720
That's what we should do.

1403
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:15,720
Excited.

1404
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:19,640
Anyhow that's gonna do it for this part A here tonight but we're not done yet we got

1405
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:23,280
plenty more show coming part B is just around the corner and in part B tonight we're gonna

1406
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:27,360

1407
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:33,560

1409
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,200
Who news coming up in part B tonight.

1410
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:43,780
So we'll be and it does relate to video games yes it does although I know a lot of you nerds

1411
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:44,780
like them both.

1412
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,440
It's not Trump's is it?

1413
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:50,280
No we'll talk more about that in part B by the way speaking of nerds since it isn't coming

1414
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:55,360
up later in the show and shows that nerds like anyone watch Caprica by chance I know

1415
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:59,600
it's free on Xbox Live and PlayStation 3 some of the early reviews I heard on it were very

1416
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:05,160
good I downloaded the free version on PlayStation 3 because I think it hit that marketplace

1417
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:09,560
couple days before the Xbox one you can download the pilot for free in HD so I still want to

1418
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:15,320
check that out maybe I'll see if the chat has anything to say about Caprica while we

1419
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:18,460
take a break tonight but for those of you on the podcast we'll be back in just a couple

1420
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:28,280
seconds with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1421
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:32,200
Hello everybody out there and welcome back to another part B here at Orange Lounge Radio

1422
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:37,920
it's episode number 353 and trying to have fun with our new mixing board and some of

1423
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,480
our audio setup we're still trying to get you just used to some things and the podcast

1424
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:44,840
listeners won't really hear this but the live listeners are hearing some interesting fluctuation

1425
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:49,960
in our audio when we stop the recording so we're still trying to figure everything out

1426
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:54,840
here at OLR Studios but for the most part the feedback we're getting so far is that

1427
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:58,680
the soundboard sounds really good in fact I was going to get into Twitter topics a little

1428
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:03,380
bit here but one of the early tweets I have here is from Blue Swim on Twitter saying at

1429
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:08,960
OLR very nice soundboard hope you guys get to try it out tonight and yes we're here we're

1430
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:14,200
live so I hope he's listening alright so we'll get back into some Twitter topics in just

1431
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:18,360
a minute but first I thought we could get into some rapid fire news here in studio we

1432
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:23,920
have a lot a lot of news to cover tonight so Loki what's on deck yes lots of Capcom

1433
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:30,200
release dates including Super Street Fighter IV has been announced to be coming out in

1434
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:38,560
North America on April 27th Lost Planet 2 also now on May 18th and I don't believe it

1435
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:46,040
was in the article here but Monster Hunter Tri coming out April 20th as well they're

1436
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:52,800
waiting to announce that because of the classic controller pro being bundled in there one

1437
01:11:52,800 --> 01:12:00,680
game though that is going to be not coming out soon will be No More Heroes Paradise the

1438
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:06,280
kind of Xbox 360 Playstation 3 port of the Wii title that was originally supposed to

1439
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:13,280
be coming out in Japan on February 25th however now it's been pushed back and no word yet

1440
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:18,340
on when it's going to come out they're looking maybe at some point in April now and then

1443
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:36,120
Motion Plus because the game does require Wii Motion Plus but it's kind of neat and

1444
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:43,440
looks pretty awesome way better than the first one which is a relief alright well I got some

1445

01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:58,600
and North America that's February 11th not too far from now two chapters in the demo

1461
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:08,080
one where you are the FBI agent Norman Jaden and then the other one I guess some type of

1462
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:16,600
private investigator also lost planet 2 has a release date and some Gears of War characters

1463
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:20,520
apparently are going to be making a cameo in the game as well that's kind of interesting

1464
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:25,480
Marcus and Dom from Gears of War I'm guessing they'll be only on the 360 call it a hunch

1465
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:29,200
yeah you're probably right there's some new trailers by the way on Xbox Live maybe they'll

1466
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:35,720
have like may 18th by the way something like that from Uncharted or something in the ps3

1467
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:42,400
one that'd be kind of neat yeah God of War that or Kratos that'd be kind of weird all

1468
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:49,960
right apparently for the live folks our stream dropped while we were doing some of the reporting

1469
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:54,760
right there I don't know why that happened but apparently it fixed itself I didn't have

1470
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:59,480
to do anything weird I was just reading right on through the news apparently our stream

1471
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:05,760
drops somewhere in there all right just another wonderful night here all right good times

1472
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:10,520
hopefully just a hiccup in the cable not anything about our new software I hope anyhow let's

1473
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:13,880
hope we get through the rest of the show dark soccer what do you got for us we'll make it

1474
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:20,160
through the show so for more Star Trek online news since we did go into it just a little

1475
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:27,760
bit in the last part they're actually doing a patch for launch day I patched it when we

1476
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:33,320
were starting the show so for for the well no wonder we're dropping for you know I'm

1477
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:42,880
kidding but they're already working on the first big update for the game they're not

1478
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:49,280
really saying exactly what but there's gonna be more PvP exploration missions for the Klingons

1479
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:57,620
and more ground-based fleet stuff as in huge ass quest like there's gonna be raids and

1480
01:15:57,620 --> 01:16:05,480
also also Rob they're thinking about having Q and time travel oh that's kind of cool yep

1481
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:10,840
and yeah about seven of nine actually because I pre-ordered mine I'm gonna have a liberated

1482
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:16,240
Borg cool I ordered my through Amazon so yeah I'll pretty much have my seven of nine just

1483
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:21,080
not you know pretty um but like I was saying they're also doing rating there'll be five

1484
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:27,480
man missions for max level players that will be both for Federation and Klingon and they'll

1485
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:35,800
be that says will be released every few weeks starting a week after launch there's also

1486
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:41,600
Federation versus Federation PvP which will be kind of interesting I guess I did I want

1487
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:45,360
the mirror verse stuff to come in and you know down the line we're supposed to be getting

1488
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:54,160
Cardassian and Romulan factions as well so I guess you have for the Federation then you

1489
01:16:54,160 --> 01:17:02,200
have Qapla you know for the Klingons sorry anyway um so yeah Darwinia is our next news

1490
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:15,440
and it should be coming out on Xbox Live on February 10th and it's supposed to be free

1491
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:25,580
on February 10th from what I understand and then $15 I think you have to pay for the minimum

1492
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:31,520
sales I think later on if I'm reading this correctly and then another good thing is afterburner

1493
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:40,280
climax will be coming to the US and actually into Europe for the spring on it says it's

1494
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:48,680
going to be on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network and it's basically going to be the

1495
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:56,920
full arcade port it's pretty cool now where's my planet Harrier you'll have to wait for

1496
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:03,120
that I guess all right let's get into some Twitter topics although my mouth is full here

1497
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:08,160
so I'm gonna have Loki answer the first one here oh actually oh here's a question from

1498
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:13,200
Blue Swim and no theme music tonight guys sorry I didn't queue it up Blue Swim says

1499
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:17,060
have any of you played Mercenaries 2 it's kind of like Grand Theft Auto meets Earth

1500
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:24,220
Defense Force 2017 it's a ton of fun it is a very glitchy ass game yes I've played lots

1501
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:33,260
of Mercenaries 2 and yeah it's horribly glitchy which is why I love it I've unfortunately

1502
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:38,400
stopped playing it a long time ago though yeah I don't recommend picking it up if you

1503
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:45,480
can find it used it's probably dirt cheap nowadays and yes it brings you back to driver

1504
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:53,240
3 it is seriously hilarious just to watch like the computer do stupid shit TigerCloth305

1505
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:57,720
on the Twitter sends us a story about a woman who loses 112 pounds links us to a story here

1506
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:04,140
on Kotaku a 38 year old British woman apparently so big she didn't want to have sex with her

1507
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:09,840
husband she was and I you know it's it's sad but unfortunately some of those images they

1508
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:14,000
put out on TV about you know what the perfect woman looks like quote unquote you know it

1509
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:21,120
causes this to happen to some people where she wasn't even wanting to it didn't even

1510
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:25,040
feel comfortable enough to show her husband you know what I mean so anyway apparently

1511
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:30,000
she lost 112 pounds all thanks to we fit her name is Laura Roberts and she came out and

1512
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:36,540
said she went from 252 pounds down to 140 in a year and by the way though they do say

1513
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:40,560
there was a dietary part of this as well and I think that's always important to know we

1514
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,240
talk about these games that help you lose weight and everything you're not going to

1515
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:46,920
magically lose weight just by playing one of these games five minutes a day you have

1516
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:51,200
to make a I believe Jamie's used this term before on the show and I like it a lifestyle

1517
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:57,120
adjustment yes because you have to make better choices in eating as well and you have to

1518
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:01,120
you know do the game on a somewhat regular basis for a somewhat extended period of time

1519
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:05,840
for this to work it just has to it's a lot of changes you know I'm even wanting to get

1520
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:11,760
our DDR night started back again the tab the news of the world apparently said she ditched

1521
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:16,280
the comfort eating and that added up to 4000 calories a day well of course she lost weight

1522
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:20,960
yeah well and we fit just helped her probably tone it as she was losing it so it didn't

1523
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:24,600
all kind of come out of one place you know well I've learned this and I've learned it

1524
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:29,240
the hard way during this week and last one thing that's a big help now you know I've

1525
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:33,760
had some stomach problems and I haven't been able to eat a whole lot I found out that if

1526
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:38,700
you just eat until you're you're not hungry not full but not hungry because I've had to

1527
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:44,920
stop there to keep myself from feeling sick I lost five pounds in a week it's just that

1528
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:49,280
easy you know so she had the right idea you cut out the comfort eating you realize you

1529
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:53,720
know what it is that you're doing it for and you know you can enjoy your food that's the

1530
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:59,400
point but you know it is fuel first and foremost all right Ray Iannami on the Twitter sends

1531
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:05,520
us a tweet death smiles will get a US localization by axis games they're the ones that make blast

1532
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:09,600
blue and yes I remember that I'm on the list for last week the show that didn't happen

1533
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:15,660
did I say I always say blast blue because there's no extra e well am I just wrong yes

1534
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:21,080
you're wrong fine blaze blue looks like blast blue to me all right well anyhow death smiles

1535
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:28,560
has five different characters apparently you explore the ice palace and it's a shmup by

1536
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:33,400
the way of course you get to choose your own path and difficulty from a level of one to

1537
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:40,020
three if I guess it customizes how many bullets you're gonna fight and all this save and play

1538
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:44,200
back your own replays and there's online rankings and online co-op so this looks to be a pretty

1539
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:50,320
robust little shmup and it's not something on Xbox Live it's a full disc release so looks

1540
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:54,560
to be pretty intense and I know Ray is a big fan of the shmups so he's probably got his

1541
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:59,560
eye on this one and lastly from SSJ 100 Matt on Twitter saying although his Twitter name

1542
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:04,560
is Matt Osterovski and I always mispronounce his last name sorry Courtney love now says

1543
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:10,560
that Kurt Cobain would have liked Guitar Hero 5 bitch be trippin she must have been paid

1544
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,680
off wouldn't yeah apparently wouldn't she gonna sue him and now she says he would have

1545
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:21,780
been cool with it this is by the way to the UK's NME magazine she says what pisses me

1546
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:25,680
off the most about it is I think Kurt would have been fine with having five Kurt Cobains

1547
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:28,740
singing the Spice Girls song wannabe like tell me what you want what you really really

1548
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:32,540
want I think you'd find that really funny but at the same time it's gross what they

1549
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:39,120
did Gwen Stefani started the lawsuit I have really good lawyers now will join that lawsuit

1550
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:42,400
there was this gray area and they fucked a lot of us they didn't fuck Jack White but

1551
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:47,120
they fuck Gwen fuck Johnny Cash and fuck Kurt it's just gross oh that's that's that's a

1552
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:51,080
pretty impressive tracker there it's just gross this is a rock and roll business is

1553
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:56,240
what people do they are sleazy they do sleazy things interesting I the quote I really pull

1554
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:01,560
from this there was this gray area and if you go way back to when we first covered these

1555
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:07,040
stories they didn't read the contract they were signed in and they probably had that

1556
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:11,460
whole thing misrepresented there was fault on both sides one side didn't read it the

1557
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:15,560
other side didn't represent it accurately I bet you that's what it is there's always

1558
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:23,480
three sides to every star story your side my side and the truth so anyhow let's get

1559
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:30,320
back into some other gaming news Loki what you got for us well I got some more information

1560
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:36,720
regarding the Microsoft game room this is not really a big surprise to me but apparently

1561
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:41,860
your classic Xbox Live arcade games won't work with the game room so for example if

1562
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:48,120
you bought Frogger or you know even some of the Konami games that they had on there like

1563
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:54,320
time pilot and whatnot you will not be able to play those games in game room you'll have

1564
01:23:54,320 --> 01:24:01,740
to purchase them again and mainly they're saying that some of those you know were revamped

1565
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:08,200
versions on you know Xbox Live and honestly I think some of them weren't but you know

1566
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:14,800
they're just probably they have licensing and the revamps like especially when you look

1567
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:20,320
at some of those Konami games like Frogger and stuff new graphics that's it like some

1568
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:25,280
some redone sprites there are more colors and stuff that's really it it's a little

1569
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:31,260
shady but we kind of knew it was coming you know what I mean we kind of knew it was coming

1570
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:34,920
that there was you know not gonna be or that you were gonna get screwed you'd have to buy

1571
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:40,720
all these things over again I mean this isn't a surprise it's disappointing but whatever

1572
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:43,700
I know you know they're gonna come out and say you know a because of the redone stuff

1573
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:48,340
and these separate achievements and the leaderboards that are unique to the games and the fact

1574
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:53,920
that in game room you can play them on the PC if you pay a certain amount and that I'm

1575
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:57,800
sure they have reasons up the yin yang but just in the end you know you do feel a little

1576
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:01,960
bit disappointed but at the same time did Nintendo let you download something on Virtual

1577
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:08,580
Console for free just because you own the cart no so no surprise yeah but I mean this

1578
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:15,120
is like the same you know online service it's just I don't I I I've bought a lot of those

1579
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:19,720
earlier because I do love classic games and I bought a lot of I bought like Russian attack

1580
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:24,760
I bought all these games I barely even were familiar with and I'll if I want them in game

1581
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:29,080
room I'll probably have to buy them again but I'm just not going to on principle yeah

1582
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:33,000
and that's that's where I stand I'll buy some of these like the Atari mate well I don't

1583
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:37,060
even know because some of those Atari games I have to but depending on what game room

1584
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:41,880
will give me with these classic games you know if there are things like robust leaderboards

1585
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:47,160
and medals and things I might consider spying some of those really really good Activision

1586
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:51,080
games that I would play over and over again like the original pitfall I still love that

1587
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:58,840
game and would play that a lot I would they need to fix the d-pad that's really what that's

1588
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:02,600
why I plan on buying everything on the computer too because it's the whole laptop and with

1589
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:08,840
me on the go and everything so cuz it's a d-pad Microsoft come on it would be nice make

1590
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:13,760
a revision to your controller maybe 3 surprise who knows they did it for a little bit in

1591
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:18,800
Europe they release that green FIFA controller they're like we're done with it was a limited

1592
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:23,640
time Brad from pop culture in our chat room chat dot orange on twitter.com asks sky what

1593
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:29,240
if they were to do some sort of bundle a discount for the XBL and game room at the same time

1594
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:34,160
I'd be all for it I guess but the problem is is that I already bought the Xbox Live

1595
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:38,320
version so I don't know if I would get access to the bundle I don't know if you mean like

1596
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:43,480
maybe like a discounted game room game because I have the Xbox Live version of course I would

1597
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:51,660
like that idea a lot but it's not gonna happen but I will refuse on principle I am not rebuying

1598
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:56,800
Frogger I'm not rebuying joust I'm not rebuying anything that I already have on Xbox Live

1599
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:01,240
Arcade which is quite a bit so Konami probably won't be buying much of your stuff unless

1600
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:06,760
you really dig deep you have to put out like time pilot 83 some of these things that you

1601
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:11,680
miss the first time and the other thing too about game room that they announced too is

1602
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:18,360
that it's not going to be including any T or M rated content it's gonna be e10 plus

1603
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:26,440
only so you know one of the games that they're talking about no death race 2000 unfortunately

1604
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:29,880
oh that's right because I was rated really there I don't think there was that many T

1605
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:35,000
and M rated game will be well hell most of the games weren't even rated back then I think

1606
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:39,160
so actually all the games weren't rated back do they all have to be rerated they have to

1607
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:42,920
be not even rerated they have to be rated for the first time well you know what I mean

1608
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:47,640
though or do they just kind of roll up into game I don't know I don't know unless they

1609
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:51,020
came out like the 90s and stuff where they finally started doing that well here's the

1610
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:55,640
thing and a lot of people are saying oh this means no Mortal Kombat or Smash TV or dah

1611
01:27:55,640 --> 01:28:01,320
dah dah and I'm thinking you guys are thinking too new like I don't I think game room is

1612
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:08,040
for really old stuff like you got to go back before the NES like you look at that initial

1613
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:15,540
list of games that's coming out they are all really old games like Atari 2600 Intellivision

1614
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:19,880
and arcade games of that era I think if you're sitting there going oh this means no Smash

1615
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:25,040
TV you're thinking too new believe it or not I mean I know that sounds really weird to

1616
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:30,600
say because Smash TV is probably a good 18 years old of a game right now maybe maybe

1617
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:37,720
even 20 years old I think the games you're going to be seeing in game room are like 25

1618
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:47,920
years or more old like before the great video game crash of 84 we'll see though I could

1619
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:52,060
be wrong and who knows as you know game rooms supposedly going to deliver a thousand games

1620
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:57,040
although I think there's going to be certain fudging of that number I think they'll give

1621
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:01,480
us a thousand games but that means Crystal Castles on the Atari Crystal Castles in the

1622
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:07,040
arcade Crystal Castles on the television Crystal Ca- there'll be ways they mess with that just

1623
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:13,520
you see game guru says games before the NES kind of sucked um no there were a lot of great

1624
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:18,100
games back in the day it's just by today's standards the short attention span that today's

1625
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:21,680
gamers have I don't think would appreciate a lot of those old games from the past like

1626
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:27,900
a very very simple game like kaboom roll the paddle back and forth collect bombs that fall

1627
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:31,880
disgustingly simple game I bet most people that grew up on today's games would play for

1628
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:39,680
about five seconds and go boring I could sit there and play kaboom for a while I mean it's

1629
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:42,880
just you just have to kind of think about games differently arcade games were just different

1630
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:47,840
back then they were they were one trick ponies look at the game the games that they released

1631
01:29:47,840 --> 01:30:00,600
on the Atari 2600 boxing freeway drag race you know they were very like one name things

1632
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:05,720
so it was just different amiga 777 asked was tempest really fun yeah it was actually it

1633
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:10,480
was a great shooter I think it's still really fun today especially tempest 2000 it's great

1634
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:15,560
tempest 2000 is the shit anyway all right let's move on uh sorry uh some other gaming

1635
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:21,820
news trying not to focus on the past too much here whoops uh monster hunter frontier this

1636
01:30:21,820 --> 01:30:27,240
is a new game between capcom and microsoft it's going to be coming out on the xbox 360

1637
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:33,200
here's the deal apparently it's a port of a pc mmo that's right it's an mmo coming to

1638
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:38,360
the 360 a monster hunter there is a little trailer that was released and capcom put out

1639
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:43,660
a few details this week apparently the way the subscription plan will work you get what's

1640
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:48,920
called a hunter life course coupon for about 15 bucks and you get access to the game for

1641
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:56,360
30 days and you get an xbox live gold subscription with that for that month kind of interesting

1642
01:30:56,360 --> 01:31:01,480
yeah how much is xbox live a month anyway it's five bucks is it yeah so interesting

1643
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:05,400
i wonder if you could buy like for those of us that bought xbox live for a year what happens

1644
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:09,840
if you just want to buy like a few months of uh this game so let's keep adding it to

1645
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:14,360
your year because you can store up to like five years worth of live well that's a little

1646
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:19,920
ridiculous and also just a forewarning it's really hard to cancel once you've put your

1647
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:26,480
credit card in there to pay it auto renews by the way yes it does and it's a pain in

1648
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:30,120
the ass and you have to call them up and then they give you because i was paying for some

1649
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:37,680
of our other co-workers you know just to have their accounts going and uh now they've left

1650
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:44,200
kind of hard to get rid of the account especially when i'm paying for it all right uh reading

1651
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:47,840
some comments from chat there's still some comments from the last story uh going on here

1652
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:52,080
about game room vid power says i discovered the joys of atari 2600 when a friend brought

1653
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:55,960
over his system a few years ago that's awesome oh man that'd be so much fun to just whip

1654
01:31:55,960 --> 01:32:00,040
out the atari 2600 and play that for a few hours uh game guru says i mean there were

1655
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:03,680
some good games from before the crash but most were already ported to the xbox live

1656
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:08,960
arcade for the most part i think there's still some good ones out there uh salacious pop

1657
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:14,560
and chat says uh when the 2600 came out people were omg-ing that they could alter what happened

1658
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:18,960
on their tv screen they moved the paddle and the dot moved very true why do you think those

1659
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:24,600
pong they had machines that were only pong it was pong for your tv and that was it that

1660
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:30,440
was like before the odyssey which was before the 2600 and those things still sold because

1661
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:35,400
exactly right people were ooh-ing and ah-ing because they controlled what was on the screen

1662
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:40,120
and that was really a first think about it television before that you don't control what's

1663
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:47,320
on the screen besides you know changing the channel which doesn't really count so anyhow

1664
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:50,680
sorry for the tangent there but those are some good comments around the room from chat

1665
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:54,320
what's the tangent what's the show if there's no tangent what is the show without a tangent

1666
01:32:54,320 --> 01:33:01,960
how about doctor who speaking of tangents well um bbc um is uh pretty interested in

1667
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:07,760
doing video games um for after the doctor who relaunched and they want to do um ones

1668
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:14,080
that are complementary to each other instead of competition so i guess it's going to be

1669
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:20,420
episodic that's how i would translate that or have uh you know things that go from one

1670
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:28,400
to the other like transferable content um but they're saying that their ideas um involve

1671
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:33,600
quote boxed product console games virtual worlds and other experiences so who knows

1672
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:39,960
maybe we'll get a doctor who mmo but all the time lords are dead random question out of

1673
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:44,520
the blue um wasn't there like a doctor who game on the dfs that was kind of it was top

1674
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:50,980
trumps huh top trumps is like playing war with cards only you pick a stat and then the

1675
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:57,120
other person picks a stat and whichever stat wins you take that card so sort of you play

1676
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:02,200
kind of for anti but not interesting so it wasn't a very robust kind of game but i was

1677
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:06,400
just thinking a fun way to pass time i'm hearing this story and i'm thinking well there was

1678
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:12,240
a doctor who game but it sounds like it wasn't very dr hooey buddy rob overseas sent me yeah

1679
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:15,320
that's what i thought i seem to remember you got a copy of it from an overseas listener

1680
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:20,200
and we're playing it yeah no don't get me wrong i liked it it was pretty fun even though

1681
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:24,360
it had martha all over it and i don't like martha but um season three doctor who just

1682
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:29,900
was really weak to me but um i it was a fun game it's just it wasn't like super engaging

1683
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:37,520
is what i'm saying it's not depth of story or anything that adds to you know to the the

1684
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:43,840
universe uh decipher in chat says an mmo would suck everyone's a time lord time traveling

1685
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:49,400
would be hectic and uh sj100 matt wins the chat by saying president cat is a time lord

1686
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:54,240
president cat is a time lord that would be actually that would be the sequel to president

1687
01:34:54,240 --> 01:35:01,800
cat that would be the sequel to president cat time lord cat or lord cat instead of president

1688
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:06,840
cat queen cat or something i don't forget it and for the record to tell our dear friend

1689
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:15,600
brad from pod culture in the chat room martha was so she didn't get good until she was off

1690
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:21,080
of the show i'll put it that way as a character she didn't get good until she was off of the

1691
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:28,880
show she was this silly little girl with a crush and yeah she's smart she really couldn't

1692
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:33,700
think her way out of the paper bag when it came to common sense sorry but it's all about

1693
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:43,600
donna loud obnoxious and smarter than she thinks no and i'm not going to go into the

1694
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:48,760
whole rose doctor fandom i was gonna say i'm sitting here going okay i don't know much

1695
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:55,560
about dr who but i seem to recall rose was a big you were a big fan of rose rose eventually

1696
01:35:55,560 --> 01:36:02,480
though became for me the the little touch of mary sue i want to say you know you know

1697
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:08,320
what a mary sue is right okay she took on a little bit too many of this not not to say

1698
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:11,640
not to say that she was a bad character i loved her she was very well fleshed out she

1699
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:17,200
and the doctor were believable together but there were certain elements that just seemed

1700
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:22,040
like an okay we're doing this for the fans but even so rose was still amazing but i still

1701
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:29,300
think that donna well my favorite of all the companions is um sarah jane to this day even

1702
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:33,560
back to her old episodes including the badly written arc in space with the bubble wrap

1703
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:38,160
larva creatures they really they made the creatures out of green bar uh bubble wrap

1704
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:46,120
i low budget doctor who no it's what little i've seen of it i've liked i just haven't

1705
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:50,280
committed the time to sit down and watch more episodes don donna is fantastic amazing especially

1706
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:57,200
as dr donna all right back to video games loki so you may remember we talked about this

1707
01:36:57,200 --> 01:37:02,640
a few weeks ago that detail was pissed off at microsoft for locking out their third-party

1708
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:07,480
memory cards which kind of sucks because microsoft memory cards are only like half a meg or not

1709
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:15,400
even half a half a gig and um they really they're like 49.99 you mean for that price

1710
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:19,040
you might as well just buy a hard drive because it's going to cost you about you know 50 bucks

1711
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:27,340
more but you get you know like 40 times the space anyways so now um microsoft has registered

1712
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:34,180
a motion to dismiss the antitrust lawsuit which was filed by daytail and um basically

1713
01:37:34,180 --> 01:37:42,800
they're citing that you know other um rivals like apple for example have a lockout on different

1714
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:48,680
things for their systems for example can't run osx on computers not made by apple um

1715
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:54,160
so why should you be able to you know use non-microsoft memory cards on your xbox i

1716
01:37:54,160 --> 01:38:00,440
think it's a little different but whatever um they're also claiming though that they

1717
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:07,100
don't want to kind of um undermine the quality of the user experience on xbox live by allowing

1718
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:14,160
data to release uh cheat enabling memory cards but from what i remember i don't think the

1719
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:18,360
memory cards that they had were cheat enabling it was basically just allowing you to run

1720
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:22,260
more space or you know have more space on there like instead of having a half a gig

1721
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:28,760
memory card you have an eight gig memory card which is way cheaper um so i don't know if

1722
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:32,400
it's really the same thing but yeah i can understand where detail you know they do release

1723
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:38,680
a lot of their cheat devices and stuff for different consoles i don't think it's fair

1724
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:42,080
it's an interesting comparison but what do you think is ultimately going to happen do

1725
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:48,040
you think uh microsoft's got a point or do you think uh details gonna win i don't think

1726
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:55,840
detail is gonna win because it's i think it's you know it's their system but then again

1727
01:38:55,840 --> 01:39:02,560
you know they don't they may they should i think that they should allow them to maybe

1728
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:06,000
manufacture third-party hard drives or something like that because you know as far as their

1729
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,600
storage goes they're really limited on what they allow other vendors to do it's basically

1730
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:18,520
just you know either wired controllers or actually i think that's about it is all that

1731
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:23,760
they have is wired controllers out there um you know storage is all first party you know

1732
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:27,960
the network adapters i guess those can be anybody since that just plugs into the ethernet

1733
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:32,600
port there's nothing really locking that out but um you know storage is a big thing and

1734
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:37,300
i think they're way overcharging on their storage because you can buy hard drives that

1735
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:41,980
fit in those actual cases because it all really is a laptop drive inside a fancy little case

1736
01:39:41,980 --> 01:39:46,280
that's about it and i mean the laptop drives are a lot cheaper than what they're selling

1737
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:51,640
them for so you know that is kind of a ripoff but in the in the end it's their system i

1738
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:55,120
guess so they can decide what they want to do with it there are ways around everything

1739
01:39:55,120 --> 01:40:01,720
but i don't know all right i'm surprised detail didn't find a way to kind of hack those things

1740
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:06,680
but i guess it's not possible with hardware they tried i think but um yeah it's kind of

1741
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:09,360
hard to do that with a memory card but can you imagine though if you could make a memory

1742
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:14,120
card the size of one of those hard drives that'd be awesome all right let's move on

1743
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:19,520
to some other news involving microsoft and it is the indie games uh indie games uh some

1744
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:24,280
of the sales figures for 2009 were released and the best selling game xbox live indie

1745
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:29,160

1746
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:38,320
the best selling indie game last year um apparently uh it sold 160 000 units at one dollar each

1747
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:45,200
that means 112 000 for ska studios that made the game not bad but uh unfortunately that's

1748
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:50,240
just kind of one success story out of a lot a lot of games that are released which uh

1749
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:53,720
i don't know i'm not here i haven't heard a whole lot about how those games are selling

1750
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:58,160
there but i know it's very hard to kind of get featured in there and everything um there

1751
01:40:58,160 --> 01:41:04,440
is actually a more more uh full list of data here apparently uh rumble massage was the

1752
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:12,120
sixth best selling game that just basically turned your thing into a massager let's see

1753
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:20,600
what were some of the other big uh selling games of the year um avatar drop sold 117

1754
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:28,000
000 with 433 000 doing a trial that was a dollar uh let's see number 15 the impossible

1756
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:43,200
172 000 trials interesting sorry guys snake 3d or snake 360 is nowhere to be found is

1757
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:49,400
a meyer dig deep on there uh no neither's neither's revenge of the ball oh no minor

1758
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:53,520
dig deep is there sorry number five it just doesn't have actual figures but yeah that's

1759
01:41:53,520 --> 01:42:00,840
a pretty good game yeah it's addictive so there you go if you haven't checked out any

1760
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:05,320
games go go download there's so much there's some good stuff i think they really under

1761
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:10,240
advertise it i mean there's a ton of stuff on there and it's really hard to sort through

1762
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:14,440
it because of the new interface which was supposed to be a good thing and i don't like

1763
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:21,140
it so anyhow uh i think this is the part of the show where we're gonna get into some emails

1764
01:42:21,140 --> 01:42:25,200
although i don't know if we really have a lot of emails i think i heard there was one

1765
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:29,360
left over from last week that never got read i had remember i had to um delete all the

1766
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:34,520
spam and i think i got rid of some of them whoops so if someone um sent us email just

1767
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:39,760
uh resend it to to me and i'll redo it all right so we don't have email this week yet

1768
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:45,120
wow well i'll play the music and then end it because we have no emails so send us your

1769
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:49,260
emails mailbag at orange lounge radio.com obviously if you send them tonight you're

1770
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:53,480
too late but do give us some emails for next week we'll be happy to take your questions

1771
01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:58,040
and uh hopefully after the oopsies and whoops of the past couple weeks we can get back on

1772
01:42:58,040 --> 01:43:03,380
track with some more listener interaction um so maybe the lack of emails uh due to spammers

1773
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:08,720
necessitates an f you f the spammers i hate spammers they hit our website too but i've

1774
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:14,620
gotten creative like they keep spamming this thing on the forum about how to turn sub video

1775
01:43:14,620 --> 01:43:19,280
on your ipod all this crap what i did is i put in a custom filter that turns the name

1776
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:24,700
of the program into this program fucking sucks so every time they uh put a spam post it just

1777
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:29,040
puts a link to this program fucking sucks so and i'm going to continue to do that for

1778
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:32,960
all the programs that they spam on the board because it's funny even if it doesn't get

1779
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:36,520
them to stop it's really funny that they're taking all this effort to announce to the

1780
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:41,160
world that their program and they always use like names like i'm a stupid spammer oh yeah

1781
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:46,280
i did that too oh sorry yeah i change i put in custom filters and say punch me i'm a stupid

1782
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:50,960
spammer i'm like if you have okay i thought they were doing that i was like no why would

1783
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:58,360
you do that no i see but it's funny that people are thinking that if you can't beat them fuck

1784
01:43:58,360 --> 01:44:02,400
with them you should just change all the words that they use like like hot dog and like stuff

1785
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:07,080
they just make it weird well i can't change a lot like i can't change ipod because maybe

1786
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:13,280
people on the olr forums want to have a legitimate discussion about ipod but this shut up but

1787
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:16,920
this particular company ain't no one give a shit about them so i'm just going to change

1788
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:22,880
it too and you know i think i think the language is how to convert video i think i that whole

1789
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:27,360
if you use those words just like that it changes to punch me i'm a fucking spammer or something

1790
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:34,120
like that it's great oh i like that idea um somebody changed their name to this program

1791
01:44:34,120 --> 01:44:39,960
fucking sucks in chat change them all to breastler quotes i'm gonna do that the next okay you

1792
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:44,720
got it the next one i see i'm gonna change it to say guy guy guy guy guy guy guy and

1793
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:53,520

1796
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:30,760
it loki fe adobe programs are being too complicated i mean seriously an adobe premiere to try

1797
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:37,180
to render something so that it actually plays back correctly is like pulling out my hair

1798
01:45:37,180 --> 01:45:40,960
i mean i understand that they want to be flexible with what kind of options and stuff but when

1799
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:46,160
i try to render a video and like the audio is all lagged out and or it's like at the

1800
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:53,080
wrong resolution or it's just like an audio file i'm like god damn it just have a button

1801
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:58,400
where i click it and it okay look windows media file done you know select the resolution

1802
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:04,000
done you know i have a program that converts um you know different video files for use

1803
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:11,400
with my uh playstation 3 so you know that one they either have you know the uber you

1804
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:17,440
know okay i just all the settings type stuff or you can just do the stupid simple i want

1805
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:23,960
it to look good i want it to have good sound you just select you know good very good excellent

1806
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:28,560
you know that type of stuff so why they can't do that is beyond me i have to actually cut

1807
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:33,240
you know create my own custom settings and save that profile so that i have to actually

1808
01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:38,800
have one that works really frustrated and i know auditions the same way because it's

1809
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:45,080
hard photoshop good did you say photoshop sucked earlier in the show no i said photoshop's

1810
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:50,920
good i said photoshop on the iphone probably okay sorry uh let's see my fu of the week

1811
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:55,600
goes to actually you know for a lot of things are going very very well for me so i can't

1812
01:46:55,600 --> 01:47:01,720
complain but just fu to that chaos feeling that and like uncertainty like you know things

1813
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:07,320
are changing but you don't know how they're changing and just the whole process of moving

1814
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:12,520
i hate packing and having to throw away things i don't need the fact that i'm having to downsize

1815
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:21,160
from a house to an apartment again sucks but i'll get through it i always do all right

1816
01:47:21,160 --> 01:47:26,040
couple more stories for you guys and then the skype line and hopefully very few audio

1817
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:31,960
problems tonight but we'll see what happens uh low-key what you got for us uh let's see

1818
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:39,360
what we've got um it's funny the last story um it's actually a new game coming to the

1819
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:46,960
nintendo we it's uh from mist walker and um apparently the uh other game that we we talked

1820
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:50,620
about this earlier this is on that list of titles that were like to be announced and

1821
01:47:50,620 --> 01:47:57,320
whatnot um xenoblade was the other one that's actually a game coming from um the company

1822
01:47:57,320 --> 01:48:04,800
let's see here oh it's actually the localized name for uh mondan was it monado uh beginning

1823
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:10,240
of the world which is an rpg from monolith soft and then of course the last story is

1824
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:16,200
an rpg um game being developed by mist walker and uh they didn't really say what it is but

1825
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:22,000
it's a new new form of rpg they're calling it so whatever the hell that's supposed to

1826
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:28,000
mean um and yeah and then the other thing of course metroid uh other m you know it's

1827
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,400
supposed to be coming out summer 2010 in japan and what do all these have in common all of

1828
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:37,880
them have teaser sites now on nintendo's japanese website so you can go check those out as well

1829
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:42,440
um so that's kind of neat so obviously they're coming relatively soon if they have their

1830
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:50,840
own teaser site all right there's been a lot of nintendo news tonight it's all kind of

1831
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:54,720
tying it together i guess so i think i don't know i think nintendo's trying to put the

1832
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:59,080
cards together to really try to wow us again at e3 this year but i just on their hardware

1833
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:04,200
i don't know but mist walker had some pretty good rpgs at least lost odyssey blue dragon

1834
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:09,900
was kind of for me i mean it wasn't great but i know jamie really enjoyed it so i guess

1835
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:13,440
they got some people with it anyhow i have one more story for you guys then we're going

1836
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:17,820
to open up the skype line this has to do with steam and some of the growth that steam had

1837
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:26,280
in the year 2009 apparently 25 million users now on steam that's a 205 jump over the year

1838
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:30,080
and year sales and i wonder if this takes into account some of the uh christmas sales

1839
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:34,160
because they were having some obscene sales at the end of the year there um and valve

1840
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:37,400
put out a press release earlier in the week just talking about how great their 2009 was

1841
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:44,360
uh more than 25 new accounts meaning they're up to 25 million uh 10 million of those actually

1842
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:49,800
using profiles on steam over a thousand games available on the service 100 different developers

1843
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:56,240
um just crazy five years i guess the service is being being used now uh they hit their

1844
01:49:56,240 --> 01:50:01,480
peak in december 2.5 million concurrent users probably thanks to modern warfare 2 and left

1845
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:08,760
for dead 2 uh monthly average player minutes 13 billion so uh those saying the digital

1846
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:14,520
distribution didn't have a chance yeah uh steam's proving a lot of those wrong and i

1847
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:21,040
think again it's a lot of those just obscene uh sales that they have on steam that really

1848
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:25,960
kind of pushes that up to the top and the fact that valves you know pretty uh respectable

1849
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:29,920
name in gaming you know the half-life games of course and you know portal and and team

1850
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:33,440
fortress and all that and all this that good stuff that was in the orange box you know

1851
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:40,560
and the fact that that software came with those games which were big pc games so i would

1852
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:44,440
be curious though i know this isn't going to really involve digital distribution on

1853
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:50,800
a wide scale but i'm curious how the new blizzard net software is gonna i don't want to say

1854
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:54,960
necessarily compete with steam but kind of like put a chunk in that whole concurrent

1855
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:58,860
users and stuff because you know let's face it i realize steam might have a hundred different

1856
01:50:58,860 --> 01:51:05,280
developers but blizzard is like they're like kings of pc development between wow diablo

1857
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:09,480
starcraft it's kind of hard to ignore the fact that blizzard is a behemoth and it's

1858
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:13,840
going to be interesting they're a three trick pony happen yeah it's good well well apparently

1859
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:16,960
they're working on a new ip that we don't know about yet four trick pony it's going

1860
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:24,040
to be interesting to see you know what happens well has blizzard made a bad game yes chirp

1861
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:30,320
chirp chirp maybe the viking game but even that was kind of neat so i don't know we'll

1862
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:33,360
see well i'm just kind of yeah i think in the end they're not really competition because

1863
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:37,600
i don't see blizzard really selling all these different types of games but blizzard net

1864
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:43,140
they already digitally distribute their own games and that's not to be ignored that's

1865
01:51:43,140 --> 01:51:49,920
a huge chunk of pc market right there so uh isam says and digital distribution is tax

1866
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:53,900
free as no physical materials exchanging hands to boot crazy i don't know if you guys done

1867
01:51:53,900 --> 01:51:57,400
your taxes though but you know on the tax thing you're supposed to report anything you

1868
01:51:57,400 --> 01:52:03,320
bought that was out of state to uh yeah i don't think so yeah right yeah prove they

1869
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:07,140
bought it out of state i would you know i think if maybe i bought a car out of state

1870
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:11,560
or like major purchases i'd probably report those because you know that's the ethical

1871
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:16,000
thing to do and i don't want to get caught but like 20 bucks on a game i can't keep track

1872
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,880
of that throughout the year come on if you want to charge me taxes on it you need to

1873
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:25,480
do it at the point of sale like some other states do so all right and by the way some

1874
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:30,160
folks in chat saying uh lost vikings is good rock and roll racing for this nest was by

1875
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:34,360
blizzard that was from vid power and gang guru and rob d says hey if that was the only

1876
01:52:34,360 --> 01:52:40,040
one that wasn't a good game uh blizzard's in good shape i agree there you go so uh all

1877
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:44,280
right you guys ready to get to the skype line at uh one eight seven seven game olr our username

01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,960
call with bobby went okay so hopefully skype goes okay too we have a call on the line hi

1881
01:52:57,960 --> 01:53:03,600
you're on orange launch radio who's this hi this is ray hi ray how are you doing i'm all

1882
01:53:03,600 --> 01:53:07,560
right what's on your mind tonight i've been meaning to call about this for a few weeks

1883
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:13,600
now but haven't been able to because missed episodes because you know yeah yeah anyways

1884
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:20,280
we had some drama what's up um dg max technical platinum crew service is finally online like

1885
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:24,300
internationally not just in a few countries that's right because you can download it now

1886
01:53:24,300 --> 01:53:33,160
on uh the psn right uh no i'm talking about the server the online service for arcade dg

1887
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:39,180
max technical machines oh oh okay okay gotcha yeah so for those who haven't heard of it

1888
01:53:39,180 --> 01:53:46,320
it's kind of like konami's emu system only it actually happened outside of japan and

1889
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:52,680
what it what you can do is like go to the special mode where you can do these missions

1890
01:53:52,680 --> 01:53:59,120
to unlock new charts and songs there's also some like special super hard charts you can

1891
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:06,400
try as well as some courses you can do where you can compete for the best score and then

1892
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:11,040
when you go online on your pc or your iphone or whatever you can check your scores and

1893
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:17,160
whatnot um is this really taken off in arcades though because you know it would seem like

1894
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:21,880
this is kind of an expensive thing for arcades to set up are they actually kind of welcoming

1895
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:30,400
of this um so far i think so like when like the first week i was there like there are

1896
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:35,920
pretty huge lines for the technical machine like at sanibel golf fund like as many as

1897
01:54:35,920 --> 01:54:41,400
10 to 15 people wasn't it really in mind i can understand like the excitement for it

1898
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:49,840
and such um okay well i i just i don't know i just think about like arcades and it's unfortunate

1899
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:53,320
because i think about i haven't really been to an arcade myself in a long time and i'm

1900
01:54:53,320 --> 01:54:57,520
a pretty hardcore gamer and it's i i hope there's more interesting things like this

1901
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:02,400
that bring me back i i almost wonder if our local arcade has this all set up it's kind

1902
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:08,440
of sad how arcades outside japan are doing i mean there i believe a number of factors

1903
01:55:08,440 --> 01:55:13,500
and it's like for example arcades on maintaining their machines or american arcade developers

1904
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:17,820
not taking the arcade scene seriously like choosing to make novelty games rather than

1905
01:55:17,820 --> 01:55:26,040
games that you can play for quite a while like rostral for example a lot of their games

1906
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:30,960
are the kind of games that you would play just from novelty like a few times not really

1907
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:38,560
take seriously hmm well uh speaking of which um of this whole dj max thing um because i

1908
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:42,440
i referenced this a minute ago but now it's available on playstation network you know

1909
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:46,840
to download right to your psp what do you think that would be dj max fever and i've

1910
01:55:46,840 --> 01:55:53,520
heard they fix a few things but i'm still like i'm not still like getting it because

1911
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:58,520
there's one annoying feature that they didn't take out that would have made me buy it and

1912
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:06,440
that's the author correct feature hmm uh i'm looking in chat ssj100 man on our chat says

1913
01:56:06,440 --> 01:56:09,920
uh they had this whole system set up at eight on the break that's that popular arcade in

1914
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:15,960
jersey and it was an hour wait to play yeah that sounds like wow spiggle too wow i should

1915
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:19,560
check and see if uh the roseville golf land here got it i don't even know i haven't been

1916
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:24,360
there in six months kind of too bad well all right well uh ray is there anything else you

1917
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:29,520
want to um ask us about tonight yeah not the moment all right well thanks for calling and

1918
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:33,040
giving us the update it's it's it's good to know what's going on in the arcades because

1919
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:37,920
it's some sad irony that uh loki myself and dark sakura all met at an arcade yet we hardly

1920
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:45,560
ever go anymore yeah unfortunate i brought the arcade home uh main cabinet loki unfortunately

1921
01:56:45,560 --> 01:56:49,920
a lot of people did that's the problem a lot of people brought the arcade home i mean street

1922
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:55,720
fighter 4 hello arcade and oh home hey all right ray you take care buddy yes sir speaking

1923
01:56:55,720 --> 01:57:00,560
which i actually bought some stuff to upgrade my arcade cabinet at home i bought a new uh

1924
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:04,800
g force graphics card because now i'm gonna because i before i had what they call an arcade

1925
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:10,600
vga card it's basically a hacked ati card that's pretty old um with some different drivers

1926
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:17,520
and stuff but you can do the same uh 15 you know drivers hey be quiet loki's talking um

1927
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:22,800
to output to the arcade monitor with uh software and you can run any card with that so now

1928
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:29,360
i can run you know hopefully uh since uh man alive here blaze blues uh continuum shift

1929
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:34,000
uh leaked to the internet i'm gonna run that on my um cabinet too clearly we have a caller

1930
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:40,280
on the line hi who's there uh legend is aku hi zaku how are you doing yeah i just want

1931
01:57:40,280 --> 01:57:46,280
to say congratulate you on the new year i managed to make a good uh almost like what

1932
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:51,160
almost like eight years and running so far yeah we're now into the we're now we've now

1933
01:57:51,160 --> 01:57:56,960
spanned to get two decades this show yeah we started much what was the first show 2002

1934
01:57:56,960 --> 01:58:02,160
june 23rd of 02 right oh you're close you're close to an eight-year anniversary show uh

1935
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:09,400
don't remind me well what's on your mind uh nothing much just wanted to let me see the

1936
01:58:09,400 --> 01:58:14,120
truth of the matter is uh you heard about the ipad right and how some of them are just

1937
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:20,680
like wait wait wait wait what's an ipad no i'm kidding i'm sorry yeah yes we heard about

1938
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:25,640
the ipad i mean the way i see it right now i don't know i don't know why they had to

1939
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:31,360
make the the ipod i mean the ipod touch or iphone much bigger i guess it's because apple's

1940
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:38,240
trying to try to make itself relevant against the ds and the psp trying to carve itself

1941
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:44,840
an itch in that in that gaming market when it's like a johnny come lately right now uh-huh

1942
01:58:44,840 --> 01:58:49,180
i mean i don't know some of them were just saying the other day that it might actually

1943
01:58:49,180 --> 01:58:56,500
be a game for sony actually picked this one up on kotaku earlier today where the the ipad

1944
01:58:56,500 --> 01:59:02,800
itself would actually increase do you type with your fists like the clacking of the keys

1945
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:07,920
is so loud it's my mac all right oh okay that explains it all right never mind okay that

1946
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:13,080
explains it is it just me it sounds like he's beating the keyboard with his fist but let's

1947
01:59:13,080 --> 01:59:19,040
like they have because these are the chicklet uh keys they look exactly like that but let

1948
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:26,200
me see uh yeah sony's please as much with apple's ipad something along that lines let's

1949
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:33,900
see you see nintendo basically uh you know a lot basically panning the the ipad i don't

1950
01:59:33,900 --> 01:59:36,640
know when you joined the show we covered that in part a towards the top of the show yeah

1951
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:39,760
we talked about a wada base basically saying what the rest of us were thinking that the

1952
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:45,160
ipad is basically uh several eye touches glued together well it's basically the point where

1953
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:49,960
steve jobs literally jumped the shark and just trying to go after going trying to go

1954
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:56,000
after everything when he's not you know i mean i can understand that the i the iphone

1955
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:00,560
and the ipod touch managed to build itself up to a gaming platform even though it was

1956
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:06,720
never its true intention well here's the thing here's the thing the ipad only needed like

1957
02:00:06,720 --> 02:00:12,000
a couple of really great things and i think very clearly distinguishable things from the

1958
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:16,640
iphone that would have made people jump all over it and i think one of them is if they

1959
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:22,080
put a camera in the front of it so you could video conference from anywhere i think a lot

1960
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:25,360
of people would have ate that shit up right away i think that would have been amazing

1961
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:30,360
and i think the other thing is multitasking i mean they go out and say yippee skippy we've

1962
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:35,480
got a gigahert processor in here but uh you can't really surf the web and that was a disappointment

1963
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:41,640
yeah the only thing it's the only thing it is just a an oversized uh an oversized iphone

1964
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:46,640
minus the the you know the voice sorry i like this comment from chat decipher says did jobs

1965
02:00:46,640 --> 02:00:51,400
give a thumbs up and say hey while jumping over this edge shark we'll imagine that he

1966
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:57,040
did um since i know you're big on like the mobile gaming and everything do you think

1967
02:00:57,040 --> 02:01:00,760
the gaming is going to take off on this platform i mean we already heard about how it's going

1968
02:01:00,760 --> 02:01:05,520
to be able to play all the existing iphone games but you blow them up to scale or whatever

1969
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:09,160
it should be backwards compatible with the you know the other ones but then you have

1970
02:01:09,160 --> 02:01:15,120
to realize some other you saw you saw that actual you know the day they actually revealed

1971
02:01:15,120 --> 02:01:19,960
the ipad and he had like uh i think it was game loft that had the first person shooter

1972
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:25,200
tech demo that they had up there and it looked it looked pretty damn good for for something

1973
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:29,040
that you know something that small but zack do you think there's going to be a lot of

1974
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:33,480
people that are that excited about the ipad where developers are going to be jumping to

1975
02:01:33,480 --> 02:01:37,680
the bit to develop it depends on how much of an install base we're talking about with

1976
02:01:37,680 --> 02:01:42,680
the ipad whether or not the ipad itself would would have the same numbers as the ipod touching

1977
02:01:42,680 --> 02:01:47,160
the iphone if there's a huge install base and that's a that's a pretty big market to

1978
02:01:47,160 --> 02:01:51,540
actually you know make games on and the other thing is developers have to take advantage

1979
02:01:51,540 --> 02:01:56,160
of the platform completely they can't just like glue they can't just mickey mouse their

1980
02:01:56,160 --> 02:02:03,720
way onto the onto like um you know onto that platform when you know shitty titles they

1981
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:12,560
have to really find a way to to exploit the to exploit the the platform's potential you

1982
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:17,640
know there's a lot of strengths in that platform in terms of you know multi-touch in in the

1983
02:02:17,640 --> 02:02:24,080
accelerometer so surely they could think of something that could utilize both if not all

1984
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:30,400
the aspects of the the device you know i think though it's important to remember that apple

1985
02:02:30,400 --> 02:02:35,280
loves to reinvent their shit and i think honestly i think in a year's time i think the ipad's

1986
02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:40,400
going to get a lot better let's not forget good god he's like he's shooting a gun at

1987
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:46,320
his keyboard um it sounds like whack-a-mole it does it sounds like you have a chuck-e-cheese

1988
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:51,360
there alright and here's the thing i think in a year's time when that thing is redeveloped

1989
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:55,380
it's gonna be great because let's not forget the iphone did not have the app store when

1990
02:02:55,380 --> 02:03:00,120
it first launched right and that was and that was like several months and that was basically

1991
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:05,840
steve jobs coming to a census and realizing that you can't just have a you can't just

1992
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:10,600
have everything web-based when that whole web-based platform is basically it's a bottleneck

1993
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:15,960
all right it's not it's not it's not a robust solution for what you could actually do natively

1994
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:20,960
All right, Zaku, we're gonna let you go so you can go play more whack-a-mole, but thanks for the call, okay?

1995
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:21,960
All right, have a good one.

1996
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:23,960
Type a little bit more for us so we can hear it a little more.

1997
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:28,960
Bye, Zaku.

1998
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:41,960
We need to have like a loudest keyboard competition here at Orange Lounge Radio in honor of the new soundboard helping us with alleviating the Jamie typing during the show noises.

1999
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:44,960
We need to have a loudest keyboard competition.

2000
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:46,960
I don't type that loudly.

2001
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:48,960
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2002
02:03:49,960 --> 02:03:50,960
It's Brad from Pod Culture.

2003
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:56,960
Hey, Brad from Pod Culture. Wait, hold that thought for a minute. You're right, Jamie. You don't type with your fists, but you have to admit.

2004
02:03:57,960 --> 02:03:59,960
Okay, Brad, what's up? How you doing?

2005
02:03:59,960 --> 02:04:01,960
I'm doing fine, guys.

2006
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:04,960
What's on your mind?

2007
02:04:05,960 --> 02:04:07,960
Star Trek Online, man.

2008
02:04:07,960 --> 02:04:13,960
Oh, Star Trek Online. I know you've been all over this game. Congratulations on having a computer good enough to play it, for starters.

2009
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:19,960
The computer itself isn't that old, or isn't that high-end.

2010
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:23,960
A lot of RAM and a video card that was donated to us.

2011
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:28,960
It's the video card. The video card is so key, I think, for this game, and well, any game, really.

2012
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:32,960
But tell us a little bit about your experiences with Star Trek Online. How's it been going for you?

2013
02:04:33,960 --> 02:04:35,960
When I can log in, it's great.

2014
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:47,960
I guess with the beta and stuff, I've had some problems at first logging in and staying in, and then they had one huge, almost a gig patch that seemed to smooth everything out.

2015
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:49,960
That took forever, didn't it?

2016
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:51,960
No, kidding.

2017
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:55,960
Also, were you there for when the beta closed?

2018
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:58,960
Oh, yeah. I was on the Starbase getting my ass kicked by Borg.

2019
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:00,960
Okay, so how cool was it?

2020
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:07,960
It was ridiculously cool, because it was hopeless. There's nothing you could do to win.

2021
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:10,960
Did the Borg come out and say, you will die?

2022
02:05:11,960 --> 02:05:17,960
When you hear the Borg, though, you actually hear the big mass voice of them talking. It's pretty cool.

2023
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:22,960
Yeah, the first training mission with the older Borg was pretty damn cool.

2024
02:05:23,960 --> 02:05:26,960
So that's how they ended the beta? They just had a big Borg invasion?

2025
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:27,960
Yep.

2026
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:33,960
Oh, it was Borg clinging on every damn race attack, and it was awesome.

2027
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:37,960
Nice. That sounds very Ragnarok of the developers to do.

2028
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:40,960
It was kind of a geek Ragnarok, yeah.

2029
02:05:41,960 --> 02:05:48,960
In Ragnarok, they used to just do random raids on the town by all the critters.

2030
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:53,960
So, did you go ahead and remake your character?

2031
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:55,960
Oh, yeah.

2032
02:05:55,960 --> 02:05:56,960
I'm doing that tonight.

2033
02:05:57,960 --> 02:05:58,960
I'm almost back to where I was.

2034
02:05:59,960 --> 02:06:00,960
Oh my gosh, that's impressive.

2035
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:03,960
I'm totally going to have a character permanently living on DS9. I don't care.

2036
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:09,960
During the beta, I flew my ship out there, and it looks pretty damn slick.

2037
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:11,960
No quirk!

2038
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:14,960
It's, what, 38 years or something like that?

2039
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:16,960
He still needs to make money.

2040
02:06:17,960 --> 02:06:19,960
He's got his own moon now, and his brother's the Nagus.

2041
02:06:19,960 --> 02:06:26,960
You've got to wait for the expansion. There's going to be an inevitable expansion pack, and that's where the fan service will really start getting delivered.

2042
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:28,960
They'll put Khan. You'll be able to fight Khan or something.

2043
02:06:29,960 --> 02:06:32,960
No, he's probably long since... He died, Rob!

2044
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:34,960
This is Star Trek Online in the alternate universe, though?

2045
02:06:35,960 --> 02:06:35,960
No.

2046
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:46,960
It takes place from that point, the big event where the two universes split, it goes forward from our prime timeline forward.

2047
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:48,960
Now I've gone cross-eyed.

2048
02:06:49,960 --> 02:06:54,960
It'll do that. I will say, this is the first game that's actually got me to play an MMO.

2049
02:06:55,960 --> 02:06:56,960
I quit World of Warcraft for this.

2050
02:06:57,960 --> 02:06:59,960
Well, this is better. It's Star Trek.

2051
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:05,960
Except I totally, totally hate the targeting system.

2052
02:07:05,960 --> 02:07:15,960
More like ship navigation in combat. Or the fact that having never really played much in PC gaming, period, if I just suck, which I do.

2053
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:21,960
No, it's not you. It's just the control, and the walking controls are oversensitive.

2054
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:23,960
A little bit, yeah.

2055
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:26,960
Yeah, I mean, it's really easy to run into a wall.

2056
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:37,960
Well, Brad, I hope you have a lot of fun on Star Trek Online. I know there's been talk about an OLR fleet, but since I'm not really playing the game until I get a better computer, that's gonna be all Jamie to put together.

2057
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:42,960
Her OLRian race and all that, so Jamie, you're gonna have to get on the forums and tell people how to join up with you.

2058
02:07:43,960 --> 02:07:44,960
Screw that, I'm playing a trill.

2059
02:07:45,960 --> 02:07:46,960
Whatever.

2060
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:48,960
Well, he did say join up.

2061
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:54,960
I tried to make a couple of OLRians. They're not very orange, although I did make a really cool chick.

2062
02:07:54,960 --> 02:08:05,960
I'll tell you what, I'll put up some of my experimental pictures in the chatroom of some of the things that I've made, because I saved screen caps, and, you know, people, this is what I want you to do.

2063
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:16,960
If anyone wants to contribute to the OLRians, I want pictures of your creation screen with the face dimensions, with what you've done to make one.

2064
02:08:17,960 --> 02:08:18,960
Okay, there you go.

2065
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:24,960
Hopefully we'll get some forum chat. Brad, I hope you have a lot of fun with Star Trek Online. Hopefully I'll be joining you in a few months.

2066
02:08:25,960 --> 02:08:30,960
I want to ask you real quick, though, because I know you're a big fan of this, too, and one of your other shows is about Dollhouse.

2067
02:08:31,960 --> 02:08:35,960
If I'm not mistaken, Dollhouse had its final episode this past week. How was it?

2068
02:08:35,960 --> 02:08:50,960
It was a different kind of episode. It was almost a sequel to the season one ender, Epitaph One, and it was pretty good. It was pretty good overall.

2069
02:08:53,960 --> 02:09:02,960
It's one of those things that you could tell that they had a rush. The last few episodes, actually, they crammed like two seasons' worth into four episodes.

2070
02:09:02,960 --> 02:09:08,960
That's too bad. Any word about what Joss Whedon is up to next, besides directing an episode of Glee, apparently?

2071
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:17,960
Well, apparently he's got battered wife syndrome or something because he's in talks with FX, which is pretty much Fox, about doing something.

2072
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:21,960
And then, of course, there's always Dr. Horrible, too.

2073
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:28,960
Oh, Dr. Horrible, too. Excellent, excellent. All right, well, Brad, we're going to let you go, but thanks so much for your call, okay?

2074
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:32,960
All righty, guys. Have fun, and the new board is sounding really good.

2075
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:36,960
Thank you so much. We're happy to have it. Now, if only we could get all the computer stuff side-fixed, but we'll get it.

2076
02:09:37,960 --> 02:09:38,960
All right, later, Brad.

2077
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:39,960
Later, guys.

2078
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:49,960
Podculture.net if you want to hear more of Brad and his sci-fi geekdom. And if you liked our little Doctor Who talk earlier, or I should say Dark Soccer's little Doctor Who talk earlier, that's Brad's show.

2079
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:57,960
That's where they live there. They'll debate whether Tenth Doctor was better or Fourth Doctor was better. They'll debate that all day long.

2080
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:08,960
By the way, one thing to mention, if anyone else is playing Star Trek Online, you can add me to your friends list. I'm in there as Dark Sakura with the space in between the two on the Star Trek Online page.

2081
02:10:09,960 --> 02:10:11,960
All right, we got another call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2082
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:14,960
Good evening, you across the ocean.

2083
02:10:15,960 --> 02:10:16,960
How are you, my friend?

2084
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:23,960
This is Aguerefer, as well as new, well, new listeners. What the fuck? I will help.

2085
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:25,960
Oh, well. Anyway, good evening.

2086
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:26,960
Good evening.

2087
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:37,960
Or good morning, if you are to be incorrect or something on these parts, since actually it's like, yeah, it's like half past five.

2088
02:10:38,960 --> 02:10:39,960
It's five in the morning where you are?

2089
02:10:40,960 --> 02:10:41,960
Yeah, it's 5.35.

2090
02:10:41,960 --> 02:10:46,960
Easy. I feel so bad we weren't able to do the early show, but, you know, shit happens. What can we do?

2091
02:10:46,960 --> 02:11:11,960
No, no, no. The thing is that, well, yeah, I was almost about to actually miss it since I was about to go, I was just shaking around, and then I found, oh, yeah, this whole show is like now, but I haven't slept that much, so, oh, well, what the hell? I'll see if it happens, but it didn't, so, well.

2092
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:15,960
Well, what's on your mind tonight, Aguerefer?

2093
02:11:16,960 --> 02:11:22,960
Well, Mass Effect 2 is an awesome game.

2094
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:34,960
Of course. We haven't mentioned anything about Mass Effect 2, but that was a huge release this week. I know it's been getting a lot of, like, especially folks that just loved the first one are all about this game. Tell us a little bit about your experience with Mass Effect 2.

2095
02:11:34,960 --> 02:12:03,960
I've, well, I, well, what can I say? I'm an impatient fuck, so to say. I should really be, like, and I'm, and I'm, like, in a kind of way, almost, but still not doing that since, well, the whole story is that I got the, cracked the, got the pirated version of it, and played it all through, and now, and,

2096
02:12:04,960 --> 02:12:13,960
then I tried to install my retail copy, and my retail copy will not work for some strange reason.

2097
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:31,960
But, here's the other thing, is that, well, since I'm still running the Windows 7 beta, which runs out of time pretty soon, I'm not that, it doesn't annoy me that much, so to say.

2098
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:41,960
Well, how is Mass Effect, because I'm not as up and up on Mass Effect. I watched a friend play it once for a little while, and, you know, obviously I've heard it's a BioWare RPG, it's awesome.

2099
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:47,960
How does it, what are some of the differences between 1 and 2, or is it really just, like, a continuation of one story?

2100
02:12:47,960 --> 02:13:14,960
No, no, the whole really difference between Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 1 is really, the combat is way much better. Way, way much better, since, well, it annoys me really at first, because, well, I'm not, because basically they, I felt like they turned, like, Mass Effect into Gears of War.

2101
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:29,960
Which is, well, you run for cover, and, well, you shoot from cover, and that was a mechanic that I didn't at first like, really, at all.

2102
02:13:29,960 --> 02:13:58,960
But, well, after a while I got used to it, and then I've just been reminded, yeah, what's the difference between this and Gears of War? Well, here you actually have a health bar, or shield meters, and you can actually rush people, kill them up front, and in Mass Effect 2, I don't die after that.

2103
02:13:59,960 --> 02:14:02,960
I die after, like, five minutes.

2104
02:14:03,960 --> 02:14:12,960
Well, good, because I'm totally the type of bonsai kind of player where I just run out, ah! I'm not very good with covering that, so, excellent.

2105
02:14:13,960 --> 02:14:19,960
Well, IK Ripper, I want to wrap up real quick and get to some other calls, but quickly, what are some other games you're looking forward to in the next couple weeks?

2106
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:22,960
Bioshock 2.

2107
02:14:23,960 --> 02:14:24,960
Oh, another great one.

2108
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:33,960
Yeah, but, these, and that's the, really, that's the only game I have room for in my budget.

2109
02:14:34,960 --> 02:14:45,960
But, here's the other thing, is that, well, for both Mass Effect 2 and Bioshock 2, I've went and got the collector's one.

2110
02:14:45,960 --> 02:15:01,960
And, especially the Bioshock one is really interesting, because you get, the soundtrack that you get in the special one is the record, that authentic record, apparently.

2111
02:15:01,960 --> 02:15:15,960
Which is, like, that's, like, one, a few nerd bonuses from me, which makes it, like, insta-buy. So, I will.

2112
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:21,960
Alright. Well, IK Ripper, I gotta let you go to get some more calls, but have fun with your collector's edition, enjoy.

2113
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:23,960
Yeah, later.

2114
02:15:23,960 --> 02:15:31,960
And thanks for staying up, or getting up earlier, staying up late, now you know he's staying up late, to listen to the program, it's an awesome commitment for you guys overseas.

2115
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:33,960
Love it.

2116
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:43,960
Why not? We can do some more calls. 877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, and I'm just having fun hearing some of these people through the new computer,

2117
02:15:44,960 --> 02:15:50,960
because now that we kind of had to reconfigure our sound, it's actually helping the calls a lot. I'm actually kind of impressed.

2118
02:15:50,960 --> 02:15:55,960
We should have done this, like, three years ago. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

2119
02:15:56,960 --> 02:15:57,960
Hey, this is XLink.

2120
02:15:58,960 --> 02:15:59,960
Hey XLink, how you doing?

2121
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:01,960
Hey, doing good. I have a few things I'd like to talk about real quick.

2122
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:03,960
Well, I suppose.

2123
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:12,960
The iPad, the only good thing I can see about that is maybe playing desktop version of D&D, making it more better, enhancing it a little bit.

2124
02:16:13,960 --> 02:16:17,960
That's the only cool thing I could possibly see ever coming out of that thing for $500.

2125
02:16:17,960 --> 02:16:24,960
Funny enough, another giant, I mean, not a tablet so much, but that table, the Surface, I remember a story we had a couple months ago,

2126
02:16:25,960 --> 02:16:33,960
maybe like last month, about a big D&D game that was on the Surface, I know was supposed to be kind of really innovative for that platform,

2127
02:16:34,960 --> 02:16:38,960
so that's an interesting way of thinking, is the iPad as a D&D device. I could see that.

2128
02:16:38,960 --> 02:16:47,960
Correct. Mass Effect had a big patch about two months ago for the first game that they took a lot of the issues that they were having,

2129
02:16:48,960 --> 02:16:52,960
like in the screens where there was dialogue, where it was spoken, a lot of times it was skipped.

2130
02:16:53,960 --> 02:16:59,960
They cleared a lot of that up, which was really helpful, and made the gameplay a lot better, a lot more smooth than it was before.

2131
02:16:59,960 --> 02:17:07,960
And then Mass Effect 2, I'm hearing, they took a lot of the gameplay and a lot of the stuff for the experience,

2132
02:17:08,960 --> 02:17:13,960
when you level up a character, and made the interface more easier than it was beforehand.

2133
02:17:14,960 --> 02:17:16,960
So that was very interesting.

2134
02:17:17,960 --> 02:17:20,960
I'm going to have to check these games out at some point. There's too many games to play, especially now.

2135
02:17:21,960 --> 02:17:25,960
Usually we're not saying this in January, February, it's just insane what the release calendar looks like.

2136
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:28,960
I'm starting to wonder what's left for Christmas.

2137
02:17:29,960 --> 02:17:33,960
Really, well it's hard for me because I work, and then I do my online schooling,

2138
02:17:34,960 --> 02:17:39,960
and then between that and trying to level my character in a while still, it's kind of hard to go back and forth.

2139
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:47,960
I just now got to nine hours of Mass Effect 1 for the PC, which I'm really enjoying a lot.

2140
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:52,960
Didn't you, weren't you telling me on Warcraft that you bought that on some Steam sale or something?

2141
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:56,960
No, I bought a few other things on Steam, but that wasn't one of them.

2142
02:17:57,960 --> 02:18:02,960
Actually, I bought that one at a store for $15, $10 when it was sale.

2143
02:18:03,960 --> 02:18:03,960
Nice.

2144
02:18:04,960 --> 02:18:07,960
Yeah, it was a real good value for it, but I can't remember what I bought.

2145
02:18:08,960 --> 02:18:11,960
Now I'm going to go back and try to remind myself what I bought last from Steam.

2146
02:18:12,960 --> 02:18:14,960
But it's been a while since I bought something from there.

2147
02:18:15,960 --> 02:18:19,960
Usually I get most of my stuff while it was on sale during that Christmas stuff, during Christmas time.

2148
02:18:19,960 --> 02:18:23,960
But I have a question for Loki though.

2149
02:18:24,960 --> 02:18:28,960
I was planning on trying down the road here getting an Xbox 360.

2150
02:18:29,960 --> 02:18:31,960
Which system would be the best for my value?

2151
02:18:32,960 --> 02:18:36,960
They're all about the same because it's really just what size hard drive you want.

2152
02:18:37,960 --> 02:18:41,960
So probably just, I don't know, an Elite.

2153
02:18:42,960 --> 02:18:43,960
Delete?

2154
02:18:44,960 --> 02:18:45,960
Yeah, because then you get a hard drive with it at least.

2155
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:46,960
Gotcha.

2156
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:50,960
Yeah, I don't get the arcade because you're somebody like you who actually plays a lot of games.

2157
02:18:51,960 --> 02:18:52,960
You're going to want a hard drive.

2158
02:18:53,960 --> 02:18:55,960
So make sure you get at least the Pro that comes with the 60 game.

2159
02:18:56,960 --> 02:18:57,960
Stay on the Pro, it's just the Elite now.

2160
02:18:58,960 --> 02:18:59,960
Oh, it's just the Elite and the Core now?

2161
02:19:00,960 --> 02:19:01,960
Then you need to just get the Elite I think.

2162
02:19:02,960 --> 02:19:05,960
The arcade is good for replacing a dead 360, which is what I just did.

2163
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:07,960
Or people that really don't play console games a lot.

2164
02:19:08,960 --> 02:19:10,960
But if you're going to play your games, you know, think about it.

2165
02:19:10,960 --> 02:19:15,960
If you get an arcade unit and you want to play 1 versus 100, you have no place to store the game.

2166
02:19:16,960 --> 02:19:17,960
Because you have to download it from the server.

2167
02:19:18,960 --> 02:19:19,960
So you're going to need a hard drive.

2168
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:21,960
And by the way, it's very interesting.

2169
02:19:22,960 --> 02:19:25,960
I mean, something that I don't hear enough people question.

2170
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:31,960
A lot of folks really gave Sony hell over the price of their console.

2171
02:19:32,960 --> 02:19:35,960
But Sony didn't nickel and dime you the way Microsoft's doing.

2172
02:19:35,960 --> 02:19:39,960
I mean, yeah, Microsoft got their system out for what? $199.

2173
02:19:40,960 --> 02:19:41,960
But without the $100 hard drive.

2174
02:19:42,960 --> 02:19:43,960
Without the more expensive component cable.

2175
02:19:44,960 --> 02:19:46,960
Without any type of wireless adapter built in.

2176
02:19:47,960 --> 02:19:49,960
They don't put the component cable in with the Sony systems either.

2177
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:51,960
Okay, fair enough. I'll give you that one.

2178
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:55,960
But without a wireless adapter, where Sony has that built in, yes.

2179
02:19:56,960 --> 02:19:57,960
And Microsoft wants $100 for theirs.

2180
02:19:58,960 --> 02:19:59,960
But some people don't need that, so why pay the extra money for it?

2181
02:20:00,960 --> 02:20:01,960
I'm just saying, it's not brought up enough.

2182
02:20:01,960 --> 02:20:04,960
What's the value you're getting?

2183
02:20:05,960 --> 02:20:07,960
Especially now that the PS3 is $299.

2184
02:20:08,960 --> 02:20:10,960
They're about equal now, I think.

2185
02:20:11,960 --> 02:20:12,960
So, something to think about. Anyway, sorry.

2186
02:20:13,960 --> 02:20:15,960
Really quickly, I'll let you go.

2187
02:20:16,960 --> 02:20:18,960
The battle that you were asking about.

2188
02:20:19,960 --> 02:20:23,960
I actually own a copy of Warcraft 3 with the expansion.

2189
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:26,960
And the funny thing about that is, when I registered that onto it,

2190
02:20:26,960 --> 02:20:30,960
I can now download that anytime I want through them.

2191
02:20:31,960 --> 02:20:35,960
Which is good, because if I ever lose a disc, or the disc gets lost when I move from place to place,

2192
02:20:36,960 --> 02:20:40,960
or if it gets broken or something, it's good enough to know that I can log on to that site

2193
02:20:41,960 --> 02:20:43,960
and redownload the game and not worry about, you know,

2194
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:49,960
have to go out and spend another $30, $40, or $20, or whatever, to replace the game.

2195
02:20:50,960 --> 02:20:53,960
Absolutely. I'm trying to find my old Diablo 2 key for the same reason,

2196
02:20:53,960 --> 02:20:55,960
because I want to play that again and I know I can download it,

2197
02:20:56,960 --> 02:20:59,960
but I can't find my old CD. The game's just so frickin' old.

2198
02:21:00,960 --> 02:21:03,960
But what's cool about it, if you put the CD key into the battle.net,

2199
02:21:04,960 --> 02:21:07,960
it will not only appear on your screen like it does with Warcraft and everything,

2200
02:21:08,960 --> 02:21:09,960
but also it will let you download it.

2201
02:21:10,960 --> 02:21:13,960
Like, if you click on the game, you can download the game onto your computer.

2202
02:21:14,960 --> 02:21:15,960
Very cool.

2203
02:21:16,960 --> 02:21:19,960
Excellent. We're going to wrap up and let you go so we can try and squeeze a couple more calls in,

2204
02:21:20,960 --> 02:21:21,960
but thank you so much, okay?

2205
02:21:21,960 --> 02:21:25,960
Take care, buddy. 877-GAME-OLR. Your username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2206
02:21:26,960 --> 02:21:29,960
We'll see if any more calls come in, but I'll let Loki start some last minute news.

2207
02:21:30,960 --> 02:21:31,960
Alright.

2208
02:21:32,960 --> 02:21:34,960
I'm assuming Jamie doesn't have anything, but I don't know if you have anything, Jamie.

2209
02:21:35,960 --> 02:21:36,960
Way to assume, Rob.

2210
02:21:37,960 --> 02:21:38,960
I'm just saying.

2211
02:21:39,960 --> 02:21:42,960
There's more Who coming to the Rock Band Marketplace.

2212
02:21:43,960 --> 02:21:46,960
Apparently some more tracks are going to be coming on February 7th,

2213
02:21:47,960 --> 02:21:48,960
according to an advertisement.

2214
02:21:48,960 --> 02:21:50,960
It looks like...

2215
02:21:51,960 --> 02:21:52,960
Oh, that's in Rock Band?

2216
02:21:53,960 --> 02:21:56,960
I don't know. It's some digital advertisement, but that's kind of neat.

2217
02:21:57,960 --> 02:21:59,960
We got another call coming in. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2218
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:01,960
Hey, it's Sturlock.

2219
02:22:02,960 --> 02:22:03,960
Hi, Sturlock. What's on your mind?

2220
02:22:04,960 --> 02:22:09,960
Not much. I wanted to let you guys know about something cool I found a few weeks ago.

2221
02:22:10,960 --> 02:22:11,960
We like cool stuff. What's up?

2222
02:22:11,960 --> 02:22:17,960
Well, I remember the FC Mobile, which was the portable NES.

2223
02:22:18,960 --> 02:22:20,960
Yes, I do. I got that as a Christmas present, which was amazing.

2224
02:22:21,960 --> 02:22:22,960
I have one too.

2225
02:22:23,960 --> 02:22:25,960
Well, now there is a portable Super Nintendo.

2226
02:22:26,960 --> 02:22:27,960
It's done by a really crappy company.

2227
02:22:28,960 --> 02:22:32,960
Yeah, it kind of is, but it's not that bad.

2228
02:22:33,960 --> 02:22:36,960
Does this mean the patents are up on the Super Nintendo technology or something,

2229
02:22:37,960 --> 02:22:39,960
where now we're going to start seeing all these bootleg Super Nintendos come out?

2230
02:22:39,960 --> 02:22:42,960
I guess so. I guess we're going to be seeing more of these.

2231
02:22:43,960 --> 02:22:46,960
So maybe this is the first one out the gate, but that means there might be some more of these in the future.

2232
02:22:47,960 --> 02:22:51,960
Well, tell us a little more about the system, because even though Jamie's heard of it, I have not.

2233
02:22:52,960 --> 02:22:54,960
Well, it's called the FC 16 GO.

2234
02:22:55,960 --> 02:23:05,960
And yeah, it's done by Yobo, who did the FC Twin and the FC3, and I don't know, they're not the greatest.

2235
02:23:05,960 --> 02:23:12,960
But the Super Nintendo end seems to be kind of improved in this.

2236
02:23:13,960 --> 02:23:19,960
It does play Star Fox. Oh my gosh. Nice. Wow.

2237
02:23:20,960 --> 02:23:26,960
My only real complaint about it is the headphone jack is retarded.

2238
02:23:26,960 --> 02:23:34,960
Like, the headphone jack is not your standard, you know, three and a half millimeter, you know, whatever.

2239
02:23:35,960 --> 02:23:40,960
It's 2.5, which is, you know, like what you would see like in a cell phone headset.

2240
02:23:41,960 --> 02:23:46,960
That's weird. Do you think that might be a region thing, because cell phones are so prevalent in the other countries, maybe where this is really...

2241
02:23:47,960 --> 02:23:51,960
I don't. I mean, I solved that problem. I just got an adapter and that was that.

2242
02:23:51,960 --> 02:23:55,960
That's what RadioShacks are really good for. I need an adapter.

2243
02:23:56,960 --> 02:24:00,960
Yeah, exactly. But yeah, I haven't found anything that doesn't work on it.

2244
02:24:01,960 --> 02:24:02,960
Well, that's pretty cool.

2245
02:24:03,960 --> 02:24:06,960
I guess Super Mario RPG probably doesn't work, I don't know, because I don't have the game.

2246
02:24:07,960 --> 02:24:16,960
Is it the same type of thing like the FC Mobile, where, you know, it's kind of like you can have it on, you know, a little portable system, or you can hook it into the TV and do it that way?

2247
02:24:16,960 --> 02:24:20,960
Yep, it is. And it comes with two wireless controllers also.

2248
02:24:21,960 --> 02:24:22,960
Oh, wow.

2249
02:24:23,960 --> 02:24:24,960
And the controllers are actually pretty good.

2250
02:24:25,960 --> 02:24:29,960
I'm very excited at the idea, because Super Nintendo, I'm sorry, is the best console they ever put out ever.

2251
02:24:30,960 --> 02:24:32,960
I don't think they'll ever put out a console that good ever again.

2252
02:24:33,960 --> 02:24:38,960
Just being able to play some of these games like Kid Icarus, or not Kid Icarus, I was going to say Super Metroid.

2253
02:24:38,960 --> 02:24:46,960
Yeah, Super Metroid. I wish the hypothetical Super Nintendo Kid Icarus game in my head, and Actraiser, and Final Fantasy III, VI, whatever you want to call it.

2254
02:24:47,960 --> 02:24:48,960
Which does work on it.

2255
02:24:49,960 --> 02:24:50,960
I'm still going to go with the PC Engine Duo.

2256
02:24:51,960 --> 02:24:52,960
What's that?

2257
02:24:53,960 --> 02:24:54,960
That was released in the US, so I have no memories of that.

2258
02:24:55,960 --> 02:24:56,960
Sorry, it's got some of the best games ever.

2259
02:24:57,960 --> 02:25:01,960
Yeah, Dracula X, which was kind of a bastardized rondo of blood, pretty much.

2260
02:25:02,960 --> 02:25:04,960
Alright. Well, Sturlock, anything else on your mind, buddy?

2261
02:25:05,960 --> 02:25:06,960
No, that was it.

2262
02:25:06,960 --> 02:25:10,960
Alright, well thank you so much for the call, and have fun with that FC16 device.

2263
02:25:11,960 --> 02:25:12,960
Yeah, it's pretty fun.

2264
02:25:13,960 --> 02:25:15,960
I'm going to look into it, but I'm going to wait and see what kind of competition comes out. We'll see.

2265
02:25:16,960 --> 02:25:17,960
Yeah, I'm sure there will be other things.

2266
02:25:18,960 --> 02:25:19,960
Alright, take care, buddy.

2267
02:25:20,960 --> 02:25:20,960
See ya.

2268
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:24,960
GameGuru says, expect the FC64 to come soon. Who knows?

2269
02:25:25,960 --> 02:25:33,960
It sounds like it's about, what, 20 years on the patents or something? I don't know exactly how that all works, but it's going to be interesting when the ones on the PlayStation and so forth are up.

2270
02:25:33,960 --> 02:25:35,960
I'm really curious to see what happens there.

2271
02:25:36,960 --> 02:25:41,960
Decipher in chat says, I want a portable N64 so bad. Go buy a Nintendo DS.

2272
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:42,960
Seriously?

2273
02:25:43,960 --> 02:25:46,960
That's what they pretty much are. Loki, do you have any other last minute stories while we see if any other calls come in?

2274
02:25:47,960 --> 02:25:48,960
Um, yeah. Let's see.

2275
02:25:49,960 --> 02:25:51,960
Oh, we got a call coming in. Hold on.

2276
02:25:52,960 --> 02:25:54,960
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2277
02:25:55,960 --> 02:25:56,960
Hello, it's Salacious Pop.

2278
02:25:57,960 --> 02:25:57,960
Hi, how are you?

2279
02:25:58,960 --> 02:25:59,960
I'm good, how are you?

2280
02:25:59,960 --> 02:26:06,960
I'm great. For those listeners that don't know, Salacious Pop, you know this show pretty well, right?

2281
02:26:07,960 --> 02:26:08,960
Yeah, I've been listening since about September.

2282
02:26:09,960 --> 02:26:12,960
Yeah, and is there any type of special relationship you have to this program?

2283
02:26:13,960 --> 02:26:15,960
Yeah, I might be going out with one of the hosts.

2284
02:26:16,960 --> 02:26:17,960
Get a room.

2285
02:26:18,960 --> 02:26:20,960
Yeah, Shermy and I, we just know.

2286
02:26:21,960 --> 02:26:22,960
It's kiddie love.

2287
02:26:23,960 --> 02:26:25,960
I know. Well, Shermy misses you terribly.

2288
02:26:26,960 --> 02:26:27,960
Alright. No, in all seriousness...

2289
02:26:27,960 --> 02:26:28,960
My brain's improving.

2290
02:26:29,960 --> 02:26:34,960
Salacious Pop is the said boyfriend I mentioned earlier that was supposed to be here last week, but sadly it didn't work.

2291
02:26:35,960 --> 02:26:40,960
Do you want to describe quickly, I don't know why you're calling tonight, but I'm just going to derail and ask you to talk about what I want to talk about.

2292
02:26:41,960 --> 02:26:46,960
Can you describe for the listeners what the scene was like in studio last week at 10am?

2293
02:26:47,960 --> 02:26:53,960
Lots of flapping hands and flailing. It was very chaotic and stressful.

2294
02:26:53,960 --> 02:26:58,960
I know, and you're probably just kind of watching, just like Shermy, kind of watching going, uh, what?

2295
02:26:59,960 --> 02:27:08,960
Yeah, it was my fault that I was there. I did 9-11, and I caused all that cancer, and then I set up the bomb for LLR.

2296
02:27:09,960 --> 02:27:13,960
So, to all the UK listeners, I'm sorry. My presence there sort of cursed the machine.

2297
02:27:14,960 --> 02:27:15,960
But they have a new system now.

2298
02:27:16,960 --> 02:27:20,960
I see. Alright, so what do we owe your phone call tonight?

2299
02:27:20,960 --> 02:27:29,960
Um, I was just being silly and wanted to say hello and say that I'm really looking forward to eventually being a guest.

2300
02:27:30,960 --> 02:27:32,960
Maybe this room will be less chaotic next time you're here.

2301
02:27:33,960 --> 02:27:39,960
Let's hope. I don't know, tonight was pretty bad. I mean, the only difference between what you saw and tonight is that we actually had a show tonight.

2302
02:27:40,960 --> 02:27:41,960
You've got a bigger mess in here now.

2303
02:27:42,960 --> 02:27:43,960
But there was lots of flailing.

2304
02:27:43,960 --> 02:27:51,960
Yes. There really was. Well, what about this week's news? I know you've got something to say about some of these topics going on here.

2305
02:27:52,960 --> 02:27:53,960
You were the one that gave me the Steam story.

2306
02:27:54,960 --> 02:28:05,960
Um, most of my internet trolling for news has involved just wank about the iPad, which I know that everyone's gone over about a million times on tonight's show.

2307
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:16,960
But just that it's not very good. As a huge Half-Life fan, I was upset that Black Mesa Source was bumped until this year, but that's like a month-old story.

2308
02:28:17,960 --> 02:28:22,960
They were supposed to release their remake of Half-Life 1 by the end of last year, and it didn't happen.

2309
02:28:23,960 --> 02:28:27,960
I remember hearing something about that, and I remember you were kind of upset about that because I know you're a big Half-Life fan.

2310
02:28:28,960 --> 02:28:30,960
Whatever happened to Episode 3? That's the other big question, right?

2311
02:28:31,960 --> 02:28:32,960
Damn them!

2312
02:28:32,960 --> 02:28:41,960
It's probably going to be so big that they're just going to throw it into Half-Life 3 proper, but Valve is so silent on it, no one knows anything.

2313
02:28:42,960 --> 02:28:44,960
And it's been almost three years since Episode 2.

2314
02:28:45,960 --> 02:28:50,960
Are you going to be downloading Rondo of Blood when it comes to Virtual Console? Oh wait, you don't own a Wii.

2315
02:28:51,960 --> 02:28:54,960
Hypothetically, if you owned a Wii, would you download Rondo of Blood?

2316
02:28:54,960 --> 02:29:01,960
Well, I have the remake for PSP, which I heard is really good. It's sort of a competent remake of it, so I don't really need to.

2317
02:29:02,960 --> 02:29:05,960
And why don't you own a Wii? Because you have a 360 and a PS3.

2318
02:29:06,960 --> 02:29:13,960
Well, I put off buying the 360 and the PS3 because I wanted an HDTV, because they were made for HDTVs.

2319
02:29:13,960 --> 02:29:27,960
So now that I have the TV, and Wii is now standard def, the video file in me is offended by that, and I just don't want one. I don't know.

2320
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:29,960
Nintendo's being ignorant?

2321
02:29:30,960 --> 02:29:40,960
Yeah, if they put out an HD one, or the Wii, whatever, Omega, in a year or two, the next gen, I would get that, but I'm sort of over standard definition.

2322
02:29:40,960 --> 02:29:54,960
So don't care that they're the only system you can do the new Super Mario Brothers, or Super Smash Brothers Melee, or this Metroid Other M, or the fancy Zelda games, but until it's pretty, no thank you.

2323
02:29:54,960 --> 02:30:08,960
I guess. I mean, it sounds really superficial, and I hate the fanboys on the forum to just say, oh, you know, the graphics, blah blah blah. It's all about the graphics.

2324
02:30:09,960 --> 02:30:18,960
But those franchises, I've visited those franchises so much, and I've played the previous incarnations of Zelda and Metroid, that I can just go to a friend's house.

2325
02:30:18,960 --> 02:30:33,960
It's not that important to me to get a system for those specific franchises, which is really all Nintendo is now. You have to be with Nintendo if you want the Zelda, whereas all the third party is with Sony and Microsoft.

2326
02:30:34,960 --> 02:30:42,960
Alright, well, you know that I have a Nintendo system, so you can come over and play Zelda or what have you if I choose to buy those games.

2327
02:30:42,960 --> 02:30:51,960
For the record, you guys are both invited, everyone in this room, including me, because I live here, and on the phone with us is invited for PC Engine Night.

2328
02:30:52,960 --> 02:30:53,960
When is PC Engine Night?

2329
02:30:54,960 --> 02:30:54,960
Sometime.

2330
02:30:55,960 --> 02:31:00,960
Maybe after Moving Chaos, we'll get Alan down here one week and we'll have PC Engine Night. It'll be fun.

2331
02:31:01,960 --> 02:31:02,960
Seriously, we'll get our Dracula X on.

2332
02:31:03,960 --> 02:31:07,960
Or bring PC Engine over to New Casa de Rob that'll be wired for video and everything.

2333
02:31:08,960 --> 02:31:09,960
If Dan doesn't crap his pants like he did last time.

2334
02:31:09,960 --> 02:31:11,960
Just steal it. Alright.

2335
02:31:12,960 --> 02:31:19,960
Nice. Alright, I should probably let you go. I hate to do that to you, but I'll talk to you later, you know that.

2336
02:31:20,960 --> 02:31:20,960
Yes.

2337
02:31:21,960 --> 02:31:22,960
Alright, you take care, and thanks for calling.

2338
02:31:23,960 --> 02:31:24,960
Alright, thank you, bye.

2339
02:31:25,960 --> 02:31:34,960
Alright, that's going to do it for the Sky for the Lion tonight. Sorry to those folks that didn't get through, but hey, we need emails, so you should totally write us some emails if you didn't get through tonight. That would be awesome.

2340
02:31:34,960 --> 02:31:40,960
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. I'm going to let Loki wrap up with any other last minute stories and then we're going to wrap up the show. Loki.

2341
02:31:41,960 --> 02:31:48,960
The developer behind the Survivor Horror game that came out last summer, Cursed Mountain, has gone under.

2342
02:31:49,960 --> 02:31:53,960
Apparently they've run into some financial trouble.

2343
02:31:54,960 --> 02:31:58,960
Oh well. I got shut down. Too bad.

2344
02:31:58,960 --> 02:32:14,960
That's all I pretty much had. Oh, Dragon Quest stuff. Looks like 6 is going to have some new anti-piracy measures put in place on that cart, so it might be a little harder to crack.

2345
02:32:14,960 --> 02:32:35,960
And then also there's this one game that I'm playing now that's a homebrew game that's now available on, or I should say that it was a free game that was available now on Wii Homebrew, which is Saoban, which is Cat Mario, and it's extremely hard and funny because it's extremely hard.

2346
02:32:36,960 --> 02:32:37,960
Is that what you were giggling at during the Skype calls?

2347
02:32:38,960 --> 02:32:42,960
It's just really brutal, like the second level you're supposed to go into the warp pipe.

2348
02:32:42,960 --> 02:32:53,960
If you wonder why Loki doesn't talk much during the Skype segment unless you specifically call out his name, it's because that's the point of the show where he's catching up on all the funny stuff and you'll randomly just hear him, hee hee hee, over there in the corner.

2349
02:32:54,960 --> 02:32:57,960
He doesn't sound like that, but you know what I mean. He's laughing at something on the internet.

2350
02:32:58,960 --> 02:33:03,960
Alright. Is that it? That's all I... We are about out of here.

2351
02:33:04,960 --> 02:33:07,960
Well, we're going to wrap up the show, but not until we go around and get everybody's final thought.

2352
02:33:07,960 --> 02:33:14,960
But I do want to say before we get to the final thoughts, thank you guys so much for downloading Orange Launch Radio and checking us out and sticking with us through the good times and the bad.

2353
02:33:15,960 --> 02:33:20,960
I know it sucks that we haven't had any show the past couple weeks, but I'm looking at the live listening numbers and we haven't really tapered off.

2354
02:33:21,960 --> 02:33:23,960
We're still right back where we were, and so thank you guys for coming out.

2355
02:33:24,960 --> 02:33:34,960
I know especially the anticipation of us coming back tonight, and I hope the new sound was worth it, but at the same time, especially for those of you live folks that had to kind of put up with some of the hiccups we've had tonight,

2356
02:33:34,960 --> 02:33:38,960
that we'll probably continue on into our special live only after-birth segment after the show.

2357
02:33:39,960 --> 02:33:45,960
Thank you guys for sticking by us while we kind of go through all these changes.

2358
02:33:46,960 --> 02:33:49,960
But it's fun. It's a new year, a new decade of sound and everything.

2359
02:33:50,960 --> 02:33:56,960
So anyhow, and of course, if this is your first time listening to Orange Launch Radio, we are a non-profit show.

2360
02:33:57,960 --> 02:34:00,960
We're not really a business that's out to make money. We don't really run ads during the show.

2361
02:34:00,960 --> 02:34:05,960
All we ask, if you like the show, tell two friends about the show and help us spread the word. That's all we ask.

2362
02:34:06,960 --> 02:34:10,960
We're an independent production. We don't have a lot of big dollars behind us, and we're just here because we want to have fun.

2363
02:34:11,960 --> 02:34:12,960
That being said, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2364
02:34:13,960 --> 02:34:15,960
DarkSakura, I see you picking up the mic, so why don't you give us your final thought?

2365
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:18,960
Um, yeah.

2366
02:34:19,960 --> 02:34:20,960
Loki, your final thought?

2367
02:34:21,960 --> 02:34:25,960
Hopefully that new YouTube video will be up this week.

2368
02:34:25,960 --> 02:34:32,960
My final thought is I totally want like a warm chocolate chip cookie right now. Sounds amazing.

2369
02:34:33,960 --> 02:34:36,960
Alright, thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting our show. We really appreciate it.

2370
02:34:37,960 --> 02:34:43,960
We'll be back here to do it all again next week. Hopefully the computer doesn't blow up or anything until then, but we'll pray that we're back.

2371
02:34:44,960 --> 02:34:45,960
Bye guys. Have a wonderful week.
