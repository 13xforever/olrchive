1
00:00:14,032 --> 00:00:25,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight, January 31st, 2010, big Nintendo franchise games could be out this year, the classic Japanese release looks to be US-bound, and Ubisoft announces a controversial new DRM.

2
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:34,123
[SPEAKER_14]: We are live, I think.

3
00:00:34,663 --> 00:00:37,605
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome to another week, everybody, of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:38,045 --> 00:00:43,869
[SPEAKER_14]: We are that show dedicated to video gaming, video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

5
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:46,670
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here every week.

6
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:52,114
[SPEAKER_14]: And also joining me tonight, say hello to the one and only, happiest bunny on the farm, or as we used to call her anyway.

7
00:00:52,614 --> 00:00:54,495
[SPEAKER_14]: The one and only, now she's an angry bunny.

8
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:54,995
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I don't know.

9
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,376
[SPEAKER_14]: Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,097
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not angry.

11
00:00:57,437 --> 00:00:58,658
[SPEAKER_14]: No, she's a very pleasant bunny.

12
00:00:58,898 --> 00:00:59,498
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not a bunny.

13
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:00,399
[SPEAKER_14]: Contrary to rumors.

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,540
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not a bunny!

15
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,181
[SPEAKER_14]: You're some bunny.

16
00:01:05,662 --> 00:01:09,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so, and also with us tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

17
00:01:10,126 --> 00:01:10,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello.

18
00:01:10,706 --> 00:01:11,367
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, how you doing?

19
00:01:11,647 --> 00:01:12,067
[SPEAKER_14]: Doing fine.

20
00:01:12,127 --> 00:01:14,729
[SPEAKER_14]: He proved he was the Techmaster tonight, ladies and gentlemen.

21
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:16,110
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, where the hell do we start?

22
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,773
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, obviously we've been without a show for two weeks, and that's not the place we like to be.

23
00:01:21,434 --> 00:01:28,059
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys knew this was coming, though, because a couple weeks ago we told you guys that there was not going to be an Orange Lounge Radio because I was going to be in Seattle.

24
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:29,059
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

25
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:56,936
[SPEAKER_14]: So, unfortunately, we didn't end up having a show last week, and that kills.

26
00:01:57,016 --> 00:02:08,659
[SPEAKER_14]: We really hate missing two weeks in a row because we know a lot of people, you know, well, especially the fact that we know a lot of our British listeners were, you know, making plans to tune in, so we feel really bad that that didn't happen.

27
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:11,000
[SPEAKER_14]: But, of course, you know, computer issues are computer issues.

28
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,661
[SPEAKER_14]: There's not a lot we can do about it, so it didn't happen.

29
00:02:15,142 --> 00:02:17,743
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we had to replace the old computer, essentially.

30
00:02:18,103 --> 00:02:27,889
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, the nice thing is we already had a new computer waiting for us because, you might remember a couple years ago, or you might not, the listeners all pooled together and bought us a new computer.

31
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:28,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't that long ago.

32
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:30,090
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, maybe it was about a year ago.

33
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,511
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

34
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:54,472
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

35
00:03:19,191 --> 00:03:24,375
[SPEAKER_14]: A brand new mixing board that we just posted a picture of to our Twitter account.

36
00:03:24,515 --> 00:03:25,256
[SPEAKER_05]: And the website.

37
00:03:26,717 --> 00:03:28,198
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, did you send it to the website too?

38
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:28,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

39
00:03:28,698 --> 00:03:28,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

40
00:03:29,018 --> 00:03:30,940
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's also there on orangelauncher.com.

41
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,782
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we do sound a little different, you can thank our new mixing board.

42
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:38,205
[SPEAKER_14]: And supposedly our mixing board does all these effects I haven't even played with yet.

43
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:41,808
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I think it does like equalizer effects.

44
00:03:41,828 --> 00:03:43,149
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I think if I hit that button...

45
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:45,170
[SPEAKER_14]: I think my voice gets more bassy.

46
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,893
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if anyone notices that, but there's like an onboard equalizer.

47
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:50,114
[SPEAKER_14]: We just opened this out of the box tonight.

48
00:03:50,335 --> 00:03:50,975
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me turn that off.

49
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:52,717
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even know if that did anything at all.

50
00:03:53,077 --> 00:03:56,080
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think supposedly you can do these weird FX things too.

51
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,601
[SPEAKER_14]: Like if I turn, let's see which one's me.

52
00:03:58,221 --> 00:03:58,962
[SPEAKER_14]: Turn that up.

53
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,423
[SPEAKER_14]: This is all live radio.

54
00:04:00,463 --> 00:04:01,044
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all the fun.

55
00:04:01,304 --> 00:04:05,027
[SPEAKER_14]: I think if I turn that up, it actually does some type of delay effect.

56
00:04:05,527 --> 00:04:06,989
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't, it probably sounds stupid.

57
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:07,389
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

58
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:08,370
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me turn that down.

59
00:04:08,826 --> 00:04:09,707
[SPEAKER_14]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

60
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:46,330
[SPEAKER_14]: moving on up moving on up all right so anyway it's great to be back we're really sorry we missed the past couple weeks but i think for some of these upgrades that we've had here in studio in a way it was almost worth it i can tell you the show computer is much better than it was before so um i'm excited and they said in chat they didn't hear the fx so all right so i'll have to play with the mixing board over there i don't know i was just kind of futzing around with it

61
00:04:47,151 --> 00:04:48,572
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what effect this is on right now.

62
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:02,239
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, how is your gaming week?

63
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:19,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Gaming Week?

64
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:22,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't.

65
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really.

66
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:29,323
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I played Star Trek Online, but I missed the end of the beta because I wanted to see all of the Borg going in and assimilating all the people in game.

67
00:05:30,444 --> 00:05:31,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I did see the video of it.

68
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,746
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty funny.

69
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:40,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the Borg took over Earth, or the Starbase outside of Earth, so it was pretty fun.

70
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I got Tatsunoko vs. Capcom because I decided I did not want Silent Hill Shattered Memories.

71
00:05:47,953 --> 00:05:52,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, me not wanting a Silent Hill, but it wasn't really a Silent Hill, I don't think.

72
00:05:52,355 --> 00:05:53,456
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like a different kind of game.

73
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:57,818
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, which makes me a happy fangirl.

74
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:05,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I read this really about it, I think.

75
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan's been playing a crap ton of Borderlands as usual.

76
00:06:09,985 --> 00:06:12,709
[SPEAKER_06]: And I finished another season of DS9.

77
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:15,473
[SPEAKER_06]: And it has nothing to do with playing games.

78
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:16,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

79
00:06:17,155 --> 00:06:17,756
[SPEAKER_06]: We did something.

80
00:06:18,537 --> 00:06:22,123
[SPEAKER_06]: We broke out the SNES and got our Super Metroid on.

81
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:23,673
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

82
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:49,754
[SPEAKER_14]: It's beautiful.

83
00:06:49,814 --> 00:06:51,597
[SPEAKER_14]: So hopefully Jamie's volume is a little better now.

84
00:06:51,637 --> 00:06:52,178
[SPEAKER_14]: Just let me know.

85
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,762
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll play with things tonight as we go.

86
00:06:54,802 --> 00:06:57,547
[SPEAKER_14]: And I apologize because it's completely unprofessional, but you know what?

87
00:06:58,288 --> 00:06:58,668
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't care.

88
00:06:58,749 --> 00:06:59,249
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

89
00:06:59,349 --> 00:06:59,710
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't care.

90
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,271
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

91
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,012
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

92
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,356
[SPEAKER_06]: There, that's what I say.

93
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:05,767
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

94
00:07:34,893 --> 00:07:35,634
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm doing pretty good.

95
00:07:35,674 --> 00:07:39,356
[SPEAKER_11]: And then my true skill ranking as far as ranked deathmatch goes, I'm almost in the top 100.

96
00:07:39,396 --> 00:07:41,717
[SPEAKER_11]: I might be in the top 100 right now, I don't know.

97
00:07:42,217 --> 00:07:45,159
[SPEAKER_11]: But last I checked, I was like 104 or 105.

98
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,261
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's pretty good out of like 50,000 people.

99
00:07:50,142 --> 00:07:55,085
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I've been playing Borderlands a lot, especially since I can...

100
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:56,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

101
00:08:24,665 --> 00:08:43,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and then as I was going to say, I know everybody's been bugging me about doing more videos for the YouTube channel, so finally I put the one video that I did a while back on the YouTube channel, so there's something there now, and there's a new one which I already previewed in studio at least the first three minutes of it.

102
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:44,956
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to make it like ten minutes, but...

103
00:08:45,396 --> 00:08:46,057
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pretty funny.

104
00:08:46,157 --> 00:08:50,381
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of these custom things that Loki always talks about on the show, you can now kind of see on the YouTube.

105
00:08:50,401 --> 00:08:50,802
[SPEAKER_11]: It's great.

106
00:08:50,822 --> 00:09:06,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it will document how I used to play Deathmatch and Grand Theft Auto, The Lost and Damned, a while back when we played with modded consoles and modded games and whatnot, our closed work games that we'd play.

107
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:27,281
[SPEAKER_11]: but um you know it's hard to explain it so I just kind of have to show you so the first part of the video that I have done I finished this weekend um is basically showing the different weapons in the game and then the very end there's like some of the vehicles that you can use in there and then finally I'm going to get into the actual deathmatch stuff because I have like

108
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:32,145
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking forward to seeing more of the YouTube's I didn't realize you'd already put one up

109
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I did that yesterday.

110
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:19,008
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

111
00:10:43,968 --> 00:10:44,889
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

112
00:11:10,284 --> 00:11:11,065
[SPEAKER_11]: That's really old.

113
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:11,865
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly.

114
00:11:12,065 --> 00:11:13,466
[SPEAKER_14]: I was pissed when I found that out.

115
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,806
[SPEAKER_14]: But stupid me, my mistake.

116
00:11:15,306 --> 00:11:16,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Lesson learned.

117
00:11:16,387 --> 00:11:16,887
[SPEAKER_14]: Just so you know.

118
00:11:17,087 --> 00:11:19,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I got my computer the Christmas 2009 and I can run it.

119
00:11:22,574 --> 00:11:25,976
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, well, mine's from about 2008 because I think I bought it around August of 08.

120
00:11:26,576 --> 00:11:29,637
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, it's just a bummer, but lesson learned for next time.

121
00:11:29,697 --> 00:11:32,999
[SPEAKER_14]: So I might have to get a new computer later on down the line.

122
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,020
[SPEAKER_14]: My gaming really didn't end there, though.

123
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:43,924
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't really play, but I watched God of War Collection this weekend, which included the God of War 3 demo.

124
00:11:44,264 --> 00:11:45,525
[SPEAKER_14]: God of War is kind of one of those games.

125
00:11:45,565 --> 00:11:46,065
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really weird.

126
00:11:46,225 --> 00:11:50,727
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't played a lot of it myself, but I've watched several other people play this game.

127
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:53,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

128
00:12:12,091 --> 00:12:40,124
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the game really looks great and it's kind of one of those games I'm always sitting there going hmm I want to kind of pick this up and play it but for now I'll just watch my boyfriend play because he's having a lot of fun playing it which by the way can I just say this real quick why I'm really mad the show last week didn't happen is that he was a surprise special guest on the show last week he's really funny and knows his shit when it comes to games so I'm really disappointed it didn't work out but we're going to try to get him on a later show because I'm sure you guys are going to enjoy it

129
00:12:41,905 --> 00:12:46,407
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, what else have I been playing these past few weeks that is not WoW related?

130
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:51,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Still some Xbox Live Arcade things, 1 versus 100, because I think the season's wrapping up pretty soon.

131
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,791
[SPEAKER_14]: A little bit of Gyromancer, a little bit.

132
00:12:54,212 --> 00:12:58,534
[SPEAKER_14]: And Bejeweled Blitz, you know Bejeweled Blitz just got a major update on Facebook.

133
00:12:58,894 --> 00:13:01,896
[SPEAKER_14]: Now you collect coins to buy power-ups that you use.

134
00:13:02,676 --> 00:13:07,119
[SPEAKER_14]: I love PopCap, they make the best crack games in the world, it's great.

135
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:10,821
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyhow, feel free to join our chatroom, guys, if you're listening live.

136
00:13:10,861 --> 00:13:17,686
[SPEAKER_14]: We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

137
00:13:17,846 --> 00:13:20,468
[SPEAKER_14]: We start at about 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

138
00:13:20,788 --> 00:13:24,730
[SPEAKER_14]: We got a little bit of a late start tonight because of all the issues going on with our audio board.

139
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:29,333
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, I may have already said this whole spiel about All Games Radio, and if I did, I apologize.

140
00:13:30,294 --> 00:13:32,895
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm really scatterbrained tonight with all the stuff going on.

141
00:13:33,495 --> 00:13:36,796
[SPEAKER_14]: But now we can kind of coast into housekeeping and tonight's news.

142
00:13:37,496 --> 00:13:43,637
[SPEAKER_14]: I did want to say real quick during housekeeping, again, there was no show on the feed for the past two weeks.

143
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:44,297
[SPEAKER_14]: There was nothing.

144
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:52,399
[SPEAKER_14]: So this should be the first show that shows up, episode 353 after 352, which was taped, believe it or not, on the 10th of the month.

145
00:13:52,479 --> 00:13:55,400
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have missed you guys, as I know a lot of you have missed us.

146
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:19,851
[SPEAKER_14]: and of course we have some fancy new toys and we're going to be playing with these over the next few weeks do bear with us though during tonight's show when we have a whole new setup we're more prone to technical difficulties so just give a shout out in chat if suddenly our audio drops or something really weird happens you don't hear us dead air our live listeners we really count on you guys to help us out chat.orangeloungeradio.com

147
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:25,954
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, since I have been so focused on trying to make sure the show is starting by 6 o'clock, I haven't been posting a lot of tweets.

148
00:14:26,614 --> 00:14:29,936
[SPEAKER_14]: But go ahead and send in your Twitter topics if you have some stuff you want us to discuss tonight.

149
00:14:30,276 --> 00:14:32,477
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be taking those at the top of Part B tonight.

150
00:14:32,897 --> 00:14:36,599
[SPEAKER_14]: And, of course, if you don't yet have us on Twitter, it's twitter.com slash OLR.

151
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:39,360
[SPEAKER_14]: Or we're on Facebook, too, at Orange Lounge Radio.

152
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,022
[SPEAKER_14]: And as Loki mentioned a little bit ago, finally showing the YouTube some love.

153
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:46,364
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's YouTube Orange Lounge or Orange Lounge Radio?

154
00:14:46,524 --> 00:14:47,064
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Lounge Radio.

155
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:49,520
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Lounge or Orange Lounge Radio

156
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,775
[SPEAKER_11]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

157
00:15:42,823 --> 00:15:47,985
[SPEAKER_11]: and apparently I think Xenoblade is a new RPG, I want to say.

158
00:15:49,685 --> 00:15:57,648
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they've got Super Mario Galaxy, which is due sometime in 2010, most likely probably around the holiday, be my guess.

159
00:15:58,348 --> 00:15:58,928
[SPEAKER_11]: And then...

160
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:08,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Some other stuff I haven't heard of, there's a new Legend of Zelda that's to be announced, Lion Attack Heroes, which is something that they showed during E3.

161
00:16:11,412 --> 00:16:16,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Hoshino Kirby, Kirby game, that's also to be announced.

162
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:18,553
[SPEAKER_11]: And start with 100 words, English conversation.

163
00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:22,454
[SPEAKER_11]: Most likely a game we probably won't see over here, because most of us speak English.

164
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:24,615
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe not that well, but we do speak it.

165
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:31,379
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and then Span, um, Smasher is another, uh, Wii game, which I remember, I think that was a WiiWare title.

166
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,380
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I can't remember.

167
00:16:33,121 --> 00:16:38,464
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, looks like, uh, Kensa Kusu, also another to be announced title.

168
00:16:38,504 --> 00:16:41,986
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Last Story, uh, which is, I believe, the new Mistwalker title.

169
00:16:42,947 --> 00:16:48,591
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, all those have been announced for, you know, sometime this year or to be announced.

170
00:16:49,211 --> 00:16:58,213
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, also, there's a promo video that says the new Zelda game, the one that is kind of to be announced, may be coming this year.

171
00:16:58,613 --> 00:17:15,477
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, apparently, something that they're thinking is going to be shown off at E3, and my guess is probably yes, because they're going to need something to get people's attention after they show Wii Relax, because everybody's going to be like, Ugh!

172
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,558
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't care!

173
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:28,503
[SPEAKER_14]: I kind of get the impression, based on a lot of this, what you're saying, that Nintendo is really trying this year to really wow us at E3, where there's been a lot of disappointment in years past.

174
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:31,845
[SPEAKER_14]: Not just these games we've talked about so far, but some other ones we're going to talk about in a minute.

175
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:36,207
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems like there's a lot of core franchise news coming out of Nintendo.

176
00:17:36,307 --> 00:17:39,708
[SPEAKER_14]: With the exception of, well, no, even Mario is supposed to have Galaxy 2, right?

177
00:17:40,069 --> 00:17:40,769
[SPEAKER_14]: So you've got Galaxy 2, Zelda...

178
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,793
[SPEAKER_14]: Metroid, I mean, a lot of their big franchises have games this year.

179
00:17:46,993 --> 00:17:47,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, so far.

180
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:49,254
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, dates change.

181
00:17:49,274 --> 00:17:50,375
[SPEAKER_11]: We're talking about the end of 2010.

182
00:17:52,076 --> 00:17:56,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I mean, this stuff could all be pushed by the time we get to it.

183
00:17:56,219 --> 00:18:00,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it possible, though, that Nintendo has been working on the Zelda game in secret, quote-unquote?

184
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:05,805
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you know, saying there's a new Zelda game is about as obvious as, you know, it might rain today, you know?

185
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:06,405
[SPEAKER_14]: But...

186
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,207
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember E3 last year?

187
00:18:10,648 --> 00:18:12,969
[SPEAKER_14]: The Mario game came out of nowhere.

188
00:18:13,229 --> 00:18:15,510
[SPEAKER_14]: And it ended up probably being the best Wii game of the year.

189
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,971
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't doubt that they're working on a new Zelda game.

190
00:18:18,412 --> 00:18:25,635
[SPEAKER_11]: And the thing is, though, is I wouldn't expect it to probably be too different than Twilight Princess was because look at Mario Galaxy.

191
00:18:25,655 --> 00:18:28,457
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, all they're really doing is crafting new levels to go with it.

192
00:18:28,497 --> 00:18:30,998
[SPEAKER_11]: It's basically going to be the same engine all over again.

193
00:18:31,018 --> 00:18:32,319
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, no effort there.

194
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:44,732
[SPEAKER_14]: Wasn't there a rumor, and I want to say it was on our show roll for last week, because sadly the show didn't happen, but we had a whole script and a whole thing ready to go, and I want to say one of the things was about that supposedly the new Zelda is supposed to be kind of like Majora's Mask.

195
00:18:45,112 --> 00:18:46,994
[SPEAKER_11]: It's supposed to be a sequel to Majora's Mask.

196
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:54,743
[SPEAKER_14]: Which would make sense, because Majora's Mask was essentially Ocarina of Time with some new frills, because it was a new game.

197
00:18:55,069 --> 00:18:56,671
[SPEAKER_11]: I just, I don't know.

198
00:18:57,552 --> 00:19:06,041
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of the stuff they see from Nintendo, and granted, Other M looks pretty awesome, but that's being kind of developed by a third party anyways, so whatever.

199
00:19:06,262 --> 00:19:09,826
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to see Samus' booby mechanics, because it is Team Ninja after all.

200
00:19:10,306 --> 00:19:11,926
[SPEAKER_14]: So you know she's going to have some boobie mechanics.

201
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:12,766
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be awesome.

202
00:19:12,807 --> 00:19:15,687
[SPEAKER_14]: Even though she wears a steel space suit or something.

203
00:19:16,387 --> 00:19:21,328
[SPEAKER_11]: I would rather see a lot of third-party companies work with Nintendo on some new games.

204
00:19:21,348 --> 00:19:26,209
[SPEAKER_11]: If that's what it's going to take to make these games stand out and be a little different.

205
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:27,829
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that would be pretty cool.

206
00:19:28,749 --> 00:19:34,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you imagine a new Mario game with them working with Sonic Team or something like that?

207
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the 3D...

208
00:19:38,031 --> 00:19:40,233
[SPEAKER_14]: Suddenly Mario is blue and has spiky hair.

209
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:40,873
[SPEAKER_14]: It's incredible.

210
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:46,737
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it doesn't have to be exactly Sonic, but I'm just saying something like, you know, the Sonic Adventure stuff.

211
00:19:46,777 --> 00:19:48,418
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, just, I don't know.

212
00:19:48,699 --> 00:19:52,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Or maybe revivals of some of the dead franchises that people really want to see come back.

213
00:19:52,821 --> 00:19:54,943
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, oh, I don't know, Kid Icarus, maybe?

214
00:19:55,883 --> 00:19:56,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a hunch.

215
00:19:57,017 --> 00:19:57,617
[SPEAKER_06]: We need Pit.

216
00:19:58,117 --> 00:19:58,598
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly.

217
00:19:58,638 --> 00:19:59,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever happened to that rumor?

218
00:20:00,238 --> 00:20:02,859
[SPEAKER_14]: There was artwork and all this shit that came out for the game?

219
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:05,140
[SPEAKER_14]: And then it just... What?

220
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the studio that was developing it closed, right?

221
00:20:07,701 --> 00:20:08,761
[SPEAKER_14]: It was Factor 5, right?

222
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:10,301
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're not around?

223
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:11,222
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

224
00:20:11,242 --> 00:20:12,422
[SPEAKER_14]: This is all based on rumor.

225
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:19,284
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why I say this with a question mark, because I'm sure it was rumored that, like, five different people were developing it, so... Yeah.

226
00:20:19,704 --> 00:20:20,485
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, I mean, it'll...

227
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:22,840
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

228
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,702
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just not expecting a lot from it.

229
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,404
[SPEAKER_11]: But people, I'm sure, will love it.

230
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:28,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Because Twilight Princess was alright.

231
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:30,568
[SPEAKER_11]: I just didn't really get into it.

232
00:20:30,668 --> 00:20:32,430
[SPEAKER_11]: But maybe I'll try it again later on.

233
00:20:34,452 --> 00:20:34,813
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

234
00:20:35,473 --> 00:20:37,876
[SPEAKER_11]: I like Wind Waker, so I must have something wrong with me.

235
00:20:39,337 --> 00:20:39,758
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you do.

236
00:20:39,878 --> 00:20:40,479
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm just kidding.

237
00:20:41,078 --> 00:20:45,822
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I have something... No, clearly I have something wrong with me because I think Ocarina of Time is so overrated.

238
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:48,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, it is not my favorite Zelda game by far.

239
00:20:48,584 --> 00:20:50,906
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care for the Nintendo 64 Zelda games at all.

240
00:20:51,026 --> 00:20:55,931
[SPEAKER_14]: I hated the jump to 3D just because I loved Link to the Past so much.

241
00:20:56,411 --> 00:21:00,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, that was the next Zelda game just made me want to barf.

242
00:21:00,454 --> 00:21:00,935
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've tried...

243
00:21:01,215 --> 00:21:01,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Guys, I've tried.

244
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,656
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly... I loved Ocarina.

245
00:21:03,836 --> 00:21:05,077
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, most people do.

246
00:21:05,257 --> 00:21:06,298
[SPEAKER_14]: I admit, I'm weird.

247
00:21:06,998 --> 00:21:11,080
[SPEAKER_14]: I also think most people give too much fan wank to Chrono Trigger.

248
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,561
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think Chrono Trigger is that great.

249
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:14,221
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, it's great.

250
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:15,122
[SPEAKER_05]: How much of it did you play?

251
00:21:16,363 --> 00:21:18,625
[SPEAKER_14]: almost beat it, probably like three quarters of the way through.

252
00:21:18,925 --> 00:21:21,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't they just take a page from Capcom?

253
00:21:21,027 --> 00:21:21,747
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've seen the endings.

254
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:28,132
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we've seen how Capcom can sell these retro games, I mean, that, you know, look like they were on the NES or something.

255
00:21:28,572 --> 00:21:33,176
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, just make another, like, link, you know, a link to the past or something like that.

256
00:21:33,676 --> 00:21:37,459
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to go all 3D and, like, all crazy, you know,

257
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:54,441
[SPEAKER_14]: that's what they do on the Game Boy Advance at least it was a couple years ago all those Game Boy Advance games were kind of like linked to the pasty kind of games but I didn't like them because they were on the freaking Game Boy Advance and I wanted something on my TV although you know get one of the GameCube adapters not the same thing and you know it

258
00:21:55,261 --> 00:21:58,584
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm surprised we don't see Game Boy Advance games on the Wii yet.

259
00:21:59,524 --> 00:22:00,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, virtual console?

260
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,861
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to have to get out my old system so you can play this game.

261
00:22:25,881 --> 00:22:26,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, she may not have to.

262
00:22:27,162 --> 00:22:33,864
[SPEAKER_14]: Castlevania, Rondo of Blood, apparently has been rated by the ESRB for the Wii.

263
00:22:34,024 --> 00:22:39,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, this is following a couple weeks of reports that it was rated by the Australian board, it was rated by other boards.

264
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:48,209
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently now it has been rated T for Teen by the ESRB, which indicates that it will be headed to the Wii.

265
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:55,250
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and by the way, you had to have a PC Engine CD device a long time ago in order to play this game.

266
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,491
[SPEAKER_14]: Or, you played the PSP remake, but of course that wouldn't be the original.

267
00:22:59,551 --> 00:23:08,352
[SPEAKER_14]: But that, what was it, Akumajo Collection, or whatever it was called, had this and Symphony of the Night, but this game had been quite altered.

268
00:23:08,812 --> 00:23:12,093
[SPEAKER_14]: So, now apparently it is headed for the Wii.

269
00:23:12,133 --> 00:23:17,454
[SPEAKER_14]: What is also interesting about this, not only has this kind of been confirmed thanks to the ESRB, but

270
00:23:17,794 --> 00:23:23,115
[SPEAKER_14]: But also a representative from Hudson has said the game is coming out shortly.

271
00:23:23,515 --> 00:23:24,656
[SPEAKER_14]: But here's the other interesting thing.

272
00:23:25,096 --> 00:23:25,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Not in English.

273
00:23:26,616 --> 00:23:28,336
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it is a virtual console release.

274
00:23:28,396 --> 00:23:29,917
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just an emulation of the old game.

275
00:23:30,257 --> 00:23:33,157
[SPEAKER_14]: They did not go back and touch up any of the language.

276
00:23:33,217 --> 00:23:36,798
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's just... It is exactly what it was back in the day.

277
00:23:36,878 --> 00:23:44,180
[SPEAKER_06]: The only parts of this game that are in Japanese is... Well, even the freaking intro is in German.

278
00:23:45,521 --> 00:24:07,143
[SPEAKER_06]: and then there's dialogue that's like right in between at the beginning of the game right when you rescue people and uh when you fight Dracula and really it's it's like oh Richter it's your wife blah blah blah oh Maria blah blah blah you know whatever I've played the intro though for you haven't I

279
00:24:08,106 --> 00:24:08,566
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

280
00:24:36,189 --> 00:24:55,435
[SPEAKER_14]: well um the last eBay auction I looked at for that game intact was um ending I think at about 150 for a low one okay what do you think about this now do you think that this could possibly devalue that purchase or is this a good thing because more people will get to play the game without having to have all this fancy stuff

281
00:24:55,802 --> 00:24:56,483
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

282
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:14,104
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad that I had it because I played the crap out of it.

283
00:25:15,085 --> 00:25:19,168
[SPEAKER_06]: And keep in mind, for the longest time, that was the only way I could remotely play it.

284
00:25:19,288 --> 00:25:23,912
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm sure there's going to be other formerly frustrated fangirls.

285
00:25:24,032 --> 00:25:26,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, that's actually a good name for a podcast.

286
00:25:26,714 --> 00:25:28,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Formerly frustrated fangirls.

287
00:25:28,935 --> 00:25:31,217
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't that what you and Tiara's comic book show is?

288
00:25:31,237 --> 00:25:34,239
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's Monday Comic Mania.

289
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:34,639
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I see.

290
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:35,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you guys on iTunes yet?

291
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,543
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we were going to talk to you about that.

292
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:39,804
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, alright.

293
00:25:40,685 --> 00:25:41,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Call me.

294
00:25:41,466 --> 00:25:42,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Have your people call my people.

295
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:43,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

296
00:25:43,228 --> 00:25:43,989
[SPEAKER_06]: My people being me.

297
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:44,730
[SPEAKER_14]: Rondo of Blood.

298
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:45,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, me.

299
00:25:45,491 --> 00:25:45,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Call Rob.

300
00:25:46,292 --> 00:25:49,516
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is what will happen if your show doesn't get listed in iTunes.

301
00:25:49,616 --> 00:25:50,216
[SPEAKER_14]: Rondo of Blood.

302
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:53,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything else we should know about this game being on Virtual Console?

303
00:25:54,816 --> 00:25:55,616
[SPEAKER_14]: It's fucking fun.

304
00:25:56,357 --> 00:25:57,719
[SPEAKER_14]: I wonder how much they're going to charge us for it.

305
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:06,368
[SPEAKER_14]: What are they charging for the other... If Neo Geo games are like $9, I think TurboGraf... Well, you can't say TurboGraf is CD.

306
00:26:06,489 --> 00:26:08,811
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a PC Engine CD, this one.

307
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:12,896
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to guess, with no real basis, they're going to charge $10.

308
00:26:13,817 --> 00:26:15,799
[SPEAKER_06]: What are they already charging for the CD games elsewhere?

309
00:26:17,105 --> 00:26:18,146
[SPEAKER_14]: I couldn't tell you off the top of my head.

310
00:26:18,346 --> 00:26:20,667
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even know if PC Engine CD has been emulated yet.

311
00:26:20,687 --> 00:26:23,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought they did East, didn't they?

312
00:26:23,668 --> 00:26:24,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Valus?

313
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they've done some of the CD games.

314
00:26:28,491 --> 00:26:31,272
[SPEAKER_14]: There's so much on Virtual Console now I can't even keep track of it anymore.

315
00:26:32,533 --> 00:26:34,114
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, you know what?

316
00:26:34,214 --> 00:26:35,214
[SPEAKER_06]: I want a lot of people to get it.

317
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:41,618
[SPEAKER_06]: I would actually love to see people spend the money on this so that Nintendo knows that, hey, we want more.

318
00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:53,800
[SPEAKER_06]: This game, keep in mind, for a long time, this game was considered one of those pinnacles of gaming that you just could not find here.

319
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:58,581
[SPEAKER_06]: You had to be something special to have it or have good contacts or have money.

320
00:26:59,742 --> 00:27:04,243
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that it just goes to show that maybe patience is a virtue.

321
00:27:05,563 --> 00:27:06,703
[SPEAKER_06]: A virtual virtue.

322
00:27:07,303 --> 00:27:10,644
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the way, the next game they need to put out is Sapphire.

323
00:27:11,344 --> 00:27:12,464
[SPEAKER_14]: Some comments from our chat room.

324
00:27:12,704 --> 00:27:20,087
[SPEAKER_14]: Ray Ayanami says, thank you for not being the snobby, hur hur, I bought the original for $9,001 kind of collector, DarkSakura.

325
00:27:20,107 --> 00:27:21,367
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

326
00:27:21,887 --> 00:27:28,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what, there's actually two other games that I would love to see coming on a virtual console, but one of them they would have to translate.

327
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:30,289
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's that?

328
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:31,810
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an RPG called Emerald Dragon.

329
00:27:33,257 --> 00:27:35,539
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I don't see that really happening.

330
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:36,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't see it happening.

331
00:27:36,819 --> 00:27:41,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Have you seen any game on virtual console kind of go back and be tinkered with at all?

332
00:27:41,643 --> 00:27:47,447
[SPEAKER_14]: I can only think of Pokemon Snap because it saves pictures to your thing or your Wii board or whatever it's called.

333
00:27:47,607 --> 00:27:48,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Sapphire needs to come out.

334
00:27:49,308 --> 00:27:50,929
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think they've translated a single game yet.

335
00:27:52,898 --> 00:27:54,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Saffire is a shooter.

336
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:57,480
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think I might have done Saffire as a classic game.

337
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,300
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have.

338
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:58,960
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to check.

339
00:27:59,561 --> 00:28:07,404
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was one of the first with real-time 3D objects in the game.

340
00:28:08,364 --> 00:28:09,624
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, on a 16-bit system.

341
00:28:09,765 --> 00:28:10,025
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.

342
00:28:10,845 --> 00:28:13,946
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, Saffire is an amazing little shooter.

343
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,567
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'd also like to see Psychic Storm.

344
00:28:16,907 --> 00:28:18,628
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the game that Dan calls I Get Pissed Off.

345
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:22,470
[SPEAKER_06]: You're saying psychic custom But Dan says it sounds like they're saying I get pissed off

346
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:29,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Ray Ayanami says the only game that's had any translation is Sin and Punishment and even then it was only menu text.

347
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,901
[SPEAKER_14]: I did think of another one though.

348
00:28:31,181 --> 00:28:31,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Tecmo Bowl.

349
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:35,142
[SPEAKER_14]: They went back and screwed with that because they had to take out all the stuff that was licensed originally.

350
00:28:35,162 --> 00:28:35,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember that?

351
00:28:36,183 --> 00:28:39,745
[SPEAKER_14]: So they have gone in and altered with ROMs but very, very rarely.

352
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,586
[SPEAKER_14]: So anyhow, we will see what happens with this release.

353
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:46,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe, who knows, maybe tomorrow by the time you guys hear this podcast it could already be out.

354
00:28:46,268 --> 00:28:48,629
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean when they say shortly that could mean Monday.

355
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:49,729
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll see.

356
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,530
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, what's up next?

357
00:28:53,148 --> 00:29:05,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was actually going to look for the, see if I had covered it, but in other news, something about Satoru Iwata, who is the Nintendo president, he's not impressed by the iPad.

358
00:29:06,826 --> 00:29:08,347
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, the iPad happened this week.

359
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:10,828
[SPEAKER_14]: We didn't really, I think everybody's heard.

360
00:29:10,989 --> 00:29:12,049
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the show, yes.

361
00:29:12,449 --> 00:29:15,311
[SPEAKER_14]: The iPad is coming out and everybody is, well, not everybody.

362
00:29:15,391 --> 00:29:18,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I just didn't see, did it say that it was coming with a stylus or something?

363
00:29:18,353 --> 00:29:21,555
[SPEAKER_14]: No, folks are criticizing it because it looks like a giant iPhone.

364
00:29:21,675 --> 00:29:22,195
[SPEAKER_14]: At least that's me.

365
00:29:22,215 --> 00:29:23,396
[SPEAKER_14]: I am criticizing it for that reason.

366
00:29:23,436 --> 00:29:26,038
[SPEAKER_06]: I would only want one if I could draw on it, you know?

367
00:29:26,758 --> 00:29:28,299
[SPEAKER_06]: If it was like carrying around a Cintiq.

368
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,701
[SPEAKER_14]: I will say though, some of the art stuff on that did look very cool.

369
00:29:31,841 --> 00:29:34,183
[SPEAKER_14]: I could see some of the art playing looked really cool.

370
00:29:34,203 --> 00:29:37,165
[SPEAKER_14]: And I gotta say, I really like the calendar that they showed in it.

371
00:29:37,185 --> 00:29:44,209
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought the calendar seemed really robust and I could really use that, but I'm not paying $4.99 or whatever and that's not even with 3G.

372
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:46,691
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you, actually, you know what would make me buy that, Rob?

373
00:29:47,151 --> 00:29:47,491
[SPEAKER_14]: What's that?

374
00:29:48,632 --> 00:29:50,013
[SPEAKER_06]: It costs the same as a Kindle and does more.

375
00:29:50,553 --> 00:29:51,634
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can run my Kindle app on it.

376
00:29:52,695 --> 00:29:54,717
[SPEAKER_14]: I bet you the cost does come down, but you know Apple.

377
00:29:55,257 --> 00:29:58,940
[SPEAKER_14]: In a year, there'll be an iPad 2 or an iPad 2.0 or whatever.

378
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,062
[SPEAKER_06]: I see myself getting one if I can actually use it for real art stuff, but I digress.

379
00:30:02,182 --> 00:30:04,224
[SPEAKER_14]: Will Loki be getting an iPad, just out of curiosity?

380
00:30:06,266 --> 00:30:06,406
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

381
00:30:06,966 --> 00:30:07,567
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

382
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:11,450
[SPEAKER_14]: So much he could say, but he just keeps it classy.

383
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,612
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

384
00:30:14,632 --> 00:30:16,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you watch the press conference out of curiosity?

385
00:30:16,854 --> 00:30:20,376
[SPEAKER_11]: I watched the live blogging of it, and I laughed.

386
00:30:21,177 --> 00:30:21,978
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, wow.

387
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:27,921
[SPEAKER_11]: So, people do realize this is just an iPod Touch, but bigger, right?

388
00:30:28,662 --> 00:30:29,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Slightly faster processor.

389
00:30:29,863 --> 00:30:31,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Whoa, a blazing fast 1 gigahertz processor!

390
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,686
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, that's blazing fast like years ago.

391
00:30:35,446 --> 00:30:37,848
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess for a handheld that's blazing fast.

392
00:30:37,888 --> 00:30:43,831
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's let Jamie get back to the story, but I do want to say real quick, the only thing to tick me off about it too, it doesn't multitask.

393
00:30:44,132 --> 00:30:44,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, come on.

394
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,553
[SPEAKER_14]: What kind of computer doesn't alt-tab?

395
00:30:46,753 --> 00:30:51,756
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's so shiny and beautiful, Rob, because that's what people buy Apple products for is because they're beautiful.

396
00:30:52,356 --> 00:30:53,117
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like my wife.

397
00:30:53,457 --> 00:30:54,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Perfect example.

398
00:30:54,658 --> 00:30:59,040
[SPEAKER_11]: We went to go get a new camera because my camera, whatever, it's... You want me to go get you a drink, Jamie?

399
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,181
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

400
00:31:00,201 --> 00:31:01,061
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll make this quick.

401
00:31:01,081 --> 00:31:02,102
[SPEAKER_11]: I have one.

402
00:31:02,302 --> 00:31:03,903
[SPEAKER_11]: It didn't... Is it strong enough?

403
00:31:04,503 --> 00:31:06,565
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't hold a charge anymore for whatever reason.

404
00:31:06,605 --> 00:31:07,445
[SPEAKER_11]: So what did my wife do?

405
00:31:07,846 --> 00:31:09,066
[SPEAKER_11]: I want the red camera!

406
00:31:09,847 --> 00:31:14,691
[SPEAKER_11]: She's the perfect Mac Apple product buyer right there.

407
00:31:14,891 --> 00:31:15,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I want the red one!

408
00:31:15,971 --> 00:31:16,952
[SPEAKER_06]: You are incorrect, sir.

409
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:21,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Any good graphic artist is going to primarily go for a Mac.

410
00:31:22,301 --> 00:31:27,465
[SPEAKER_11]: Great, I hope you have a lot of art programs on the iPhone because that's the only apps it can run.

411
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:28,166
[SPEAKER_06]: I have Photoshop.

412
00:31:28,806 --> 00:31:30,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm sorry, I don't think that's on the iPhone.

413
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:30,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.

414
00:31:31,369 --> 00:31:33,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that gives it a pretty piss-poor version then.

415
00:31:34,471 --> 00:31:39,015
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically just for editing photos taken, but it actually has pretty good image cleaner features.

416
00:31:39,275 --> 00:31:40,296
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it.

417
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:47,000
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I have real Photoshop to actually fix my photos, but back to my story, please.

418
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:47,740
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

419
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:53,864
[SPEAKER_06]: As I was saying, you know, basically, Iwata agrees with Loki.

420
00:31:54,064 --> 00:31:56,686
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a bigger, you know...

421
00:31:58,368 --> 00:31:58,908
[SPEAKER_06]: IpodTouch

422
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:44,284
[SPEAKER_06]: and then he also doesn't really care you know about he doesn't think people just want to wear those silly looking glasses to play their video games and also he said that the next DS would not have motion sensor and there's no HD Wii he doesn't think that people would pay money for it oh Iwata

423
00:32:45,307 --> 00:32:46,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Poor special boy.

424
00:32:46,648 --> 00:32:50,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we should put him in the crayon eating camp.

425
00:32:52,311 --> 00:32:58,214
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not ready to put him there yet because whether we like it or not, the Wii is really kicking ass when it comes to sales and so forth.

426
00:32:58,234 --> 00:32:59,574
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe he just has the bicycle helmet?

427
00:32:59,734 --> 00:33:03,396
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to remember, Nintendo doesn't only care about the core gamer.

428
00:33:03,556 --> 00:33:05,217
[SPEAKER_14]: They care about the soccer bombs.

429
00:33:05,477 --> 00:33:08,479
[SPEAKER_11]: They're kicking ass in console sales.

430
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:12,081
[SPEAKER_11]: Console sales, but software sales, they suck.

431
00:33:12,901 --> 00:33:14,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Except for first-party Nintendo products.

432
00:33:14,611 --> 00:33:16,514
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay, Nintendo's giving me what I want.

433
00:33:17,776 --> 00:33:19,258
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm holding it in my hand.

434
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:20,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Tatsunoko vs. Capcom?

435
00:33:20,941 --> 00:33:22,243
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Capcom gave you that.

436
00:33:22,603 --> 00:33:23,244
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's on Wii.

437
00:33:24,326 --> 00:33:25,628
[SPEAKER_06]: They had to license it.

438
00:33:27,141 --> 00:33:32,444
[SPEAKER_14]: I love this too, this comment in chat, TigerClaw in our chatroom, chat.orange.com says, but guys, think about it.

439
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:35,426
[SPEAKER_14]: You can listen to OLR on a bigger screen with the All Games app.

440
00:33:35,866 --> 00:33:39,128
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's bigger screens really going to help you with a radio app.

441
00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:40,809
[SPEAKER_14]: Think about it.

442
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:44,612
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can't even put the thing in your pocket because it's so huge.

443
00:33:45,412 --> 00:33:47,534
[SPEAKER_14]: You can kind of put it like under your shirt.

444
00:33:47,774 --> 00:33:52,017
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe they need to come out with a girdle with a pocket or something that you could carry your iPad under your shirt.

445
00:33:52,737 --> 00:33:53,517
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what's sad?

446
00:33:53,697 --> 00:33:53,857
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

447
00:33:53,877 --> 00:33:57,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that one gigahertz processor probably could go into an iPhone.

448
00:33:58,198 --> 00:33:58,879
[SPEAKER_14]: And maybe it will.

449
00:33:58,899 --> 00:34:00,679
[SPEAKER_14]: There'll be a new iPhone this year too, I'm sure.

450
00:34:00,699 --> 00:34:01,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

451
00:34:01,379 --> 00:34:07,641
[SPEAKER_11]: And then once you bought your iPad, then the 4G version will come out and you'll have to pay... I've told you the reason I want one.

452
00:34:08,621 --> 00:34:13,222
[SPEAKER_06]: I want it instead of a Kindle because it'll do what the Kindle does plus some other crap.

453
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,403
[SPEAKER_06]: And I use my Kindle app on my iPhone.

454
00:34:17,003 --> 00:34:21,005
[SPEAKER_14]: GameGuru says, remember, this is coming from the guy who's marketing a bigger DSi.

455
00:34:21,085 --> 00:34:22,085
[SPEAKER_14]: He knows his stuff.

456
00:34:23,205 --> 00:34:26,146
[SPEAKER_14]: How's the DSi XL any different from the iPad?

457
00:34:26,226 --> 00:34:26,587
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not.

458
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:28,807
[SPEAKER_11]: It's equally retarded, okay?

459
00:34:28,907 --> 00:34:29,968
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe he's just jealous.

460
00:34:30,388 --> 00:34:34,629
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, I gotta say, some people that I've heard that have played with that thing really enjoy it.

461
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:36,690
[SPEAKER_14]: They say it does make a big difference.

462
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:40,371
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how, but that's just what I'm hearing.

463
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:43,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they also the people that dial the big number phones, you know?

464
00:34:43,612 --> 00:34:44,333
[SPEAKER_11]: laughter

465
00:34:45,513 --> 00:34:47,433
[SPEAKER_11]: They have one of those oversized phones.

466
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:48,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't hit the buttons.

467
00:34:48,874 --> 00:34:50,994
[SPEAKER_11]: I hit one button and it hits both of them.

468
00:34:51,014 --> 00:34:53,375
[SPEAKER_11]: The kind grandma has to have so she can see the numbers.

469
00:34:53,455 --> 00:34:57,155
[SPEAKER_11]: The ones that are like, you know, it looks like someone put post-its.

470
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,516
[SPEAKER_11]: You could use your whole fist to hit a button.

471
00:35:01,636 --> 00:35:02,977
[SPEAKER_11]: You should have whack-a-mole phones.

472
00:35:02,997 --> 00:35:04,077
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be awesome.

473
00:35:05,617 --> 00:35:05,917
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.

474
00:35:07,578 --> 00:35:09,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, how about some different gaming news, Loki?

475
00:35:10,103 --> 00:35:10,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

476
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:40,628
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's basically going to be a new game, I guess a new main entry game as they would call it, which will probably have two games and then one that compiles both of them together that they'll release later on that people will buy anyways.

477
00:35:42,028 --> 00:35:54,091
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't say when it's coming out, but sometime in 2010 it's going to be seeing a release in Japan, most likely probably holiday, because usually they'll have Pokemon games that come out around April or November.

478
00:35:55,651 --> 00:36:02,115
[SPEAKER_11]: and I believe the April one is HeartGold, except this year it's March.

479
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:04,616
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to go online with this now?

480
00:36:04,937 --> 00:36:12,821
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I know they do, isn't there like the trading room over Wi-Fi or something, a very limited kind of online app that you were able to do in the last one?

481
00:36:13,735 --> 00:36:17,157
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, Pokemon to me is like... When's Pokemon just going to be an MMO already?

482
00:36:17,337 --> 00:36:19,218
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, Nintendo is sitting on a goldmine.

483
00:36:19,238 --> 00:36:21,260
[SPEAKER_14]: A Pokemon MMO I think would be huge.

484
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,261
[SPEAKER_11]: But they don't want to embrace online.

485
00:36:24,422 --> 00:36:26,403
[SPEAKER_14]: There's one of those things they get a third party to do.

486
00:36:26,903 --> 00:36:27,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously.

487
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:36,629
[SPEAKER_14]: I bet there's some MMO developers out there that would suck Nintendo's cock in order to be able to put out the Pokemon MMO and get money off of that.

488
00:36:36,729 --> 00:36:39,190
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that is just a goldmine waiting to happen.

489
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:42,853
[SPEAKER_14]: But Rob, then people wouldn't buy Pokemon games.

490
00:36:43,133 --> 00:36:43,273
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

491
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:44,153
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not true.

492
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:50,235
[SPEAKER_14]: Just because World of Warcraft is doing amazingly well, you don't think Starcraft 2 and Diablo 3 are going to sell well?

493
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:52,776
[SPEAKER_14]: And if they wanted to put out a Warcraft 4, you don't think that would sell?

494
00:36:53,616 --> 00:36:54,296
[SPEAKER_14]: They'd still sell.

495
00:36:54,456 --> 00:36:54,996
[SPEAKER_14]: They'd still sell.

496
00:36:55,016 --> 00:36:58,057
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

497
00:36:58,197 --> 00:37:02,278
[SPEAKER_14]: Azure Edge in chat says, Sky, we'd have to enter 1 million friend codes.

498
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:03,359
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to fucking do that.

499
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:04,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Good point.

500
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:05,379
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

501
00:37:06,919 --> 00:37:08,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm showing Rob Sapphire.

502
00:37:09,571 --> 00:37:10,032
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

503
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:24,731
[SPEAKER_05]: I have done Sapphire.

504
00:37:25,071 --> 00:37:25,291
[SPEAKER_14]: When?

505
00:37:25,972 --> 00:37:26,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode 326.

506
00:37:26,432 --> 00:37:29,032
[SPEAKER_06]: That wasn't that long ago.

507
00:37:29,232 --> 00:37:32,193
[SPEAKER_06]: After I did Starblade and before Donkey Kong Jr.

508
00:37:32,573 --> 00:37:33,293
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just getting old.

509
00:37:33,313 --> 00:37:34,054
[SPEAKER_14]: I have bad memory.

510
00:37:34,214 --> 00:37:34,714
[SPEAKER_14]: What can I say?

511
00:37:35,194 --> 00:37:37,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Yet here I am clamoring for a Pokemon MMO.

512
00:37:37,454 --> 00:37:38,055
[SPEAKER_14]: What's wrong with me?

513
00:37:38,895 --> 00:37:42,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, how about another type of MMO of sorts?

514
00:37:42,116 --> 00:37:44,216
[SPEAKER_14]: At least this was one of the original MMOs.

515
00:37:44,816 --> 00:37:50,838
[SPEAKER_11]: And we know that MMOs just draw kids across country to their, you know, pedophile friends.

516
00:37:51,278 --> 00:38:05,610
[SPEAKER_11]: See, that's why they wouldn't do it, because you'd hear the PR newswire go out about some kid that went across country to find their friend, and it ends up being some 40-year-old dude that really likes Pokemon and touching little kids.

517
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:08,232
[SPEAKER_14]: If Nintendo actually sat down to think about it,

518
00:38:08,712 --> 00:38:32,858
[SPEAKER_14]: there's a way to do it you could do friend codes maybe for just the people that you talk to and party with especially if you're like under a certain age but you could still at least interact in a certain capacity maybe using pre like that's how the Disney MMOs do it there's like pre phrases that are in there even the Phantasy Star games have that to some extent the already put in phrases that you would communicate with if you maybe especially if you were under a certain age

519
00:38:34,289 --> 00:38:35,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Or just an Animal Crossing MMO.

520
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:53,690
[SPEAKER_14]: E.A.

521
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,711
[SPEAKER_14]: is bringing out a new Ultima game.

522
00:39:17,203 --> 00:39:20,424
[SPEAKER_14]: But, um, don't get too excited because it's not quite what you think.

523
00:39:20,644 --> 00:39:27,266
[SPEAKER_14]: It's called Lord of Ultima, and it's a game where you build your own unique city, and you play with thousands of other players.

524
00:39:28,026 --> 00:39:32,768
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, yeah, it doesn't sound like it's really like a role-playing kind of game at all.

525
00:39:32,808 --> 00:39:36,189
[SPEAKER_14]: It sounds almost more like, I don't know, Civilization or something?

526
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:40,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Which, not that Civ's a bad thing, but they kind of took the Ultima out of Ultima.

527
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,030
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

528
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:42,731
[SPEAKER_14]: So, uh, yeah.

529
00:39:43,951 --> 00:39:44,792
[SPEAKER_14]: Take with it what you will.

530
00:39:44,832 --> 00:39:52,459
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess it will be hard to know until we actually get our hands on it, but this is their idea on how to revive the Ultima franchise is to give us Lord of Ultima.

531
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:53,360
[SPEAKER_06]: That's silly.

532
00:39:53,941 --> 00:39:56,483
[SPEAKER_14]: How about just like a really kick-ass Ultima console game?

533
00:39:56,804 --> 00:39:57,064
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

534
00:39:57,084 --> 00:39:59,927
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess the tricky thing about Ultima is that it really was more...

535
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:05,449
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't like a Final Fantasy type of role-playing game, you know, where you hit a button to attack and all that.

536
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:14,153
[SPEAKER_14]: Even on the NES one, dude, you had to micromanage the food that your people were eating to make sure they weren't going to die of starvation.

537
00:40:14,514 --> 00:40:16,835
[SPEAKER_14]: You had all these status effects that could happen.

538
00:40:16,855 --> 00:40:19,256
[SPEAKER_14]: Your people could die, or they could just straight up turn to ash.

539
00:40:19,976 --> 00:40:22,437
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can't revive someone who's turned to ash.

540
00:40:22,477 --> 00:40:26,079
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it kind of kicks up the ante a little bit.

541
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:28,560
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a tougher game to manage, but rewarding.

542
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,742
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what type of game I think would make a fun MMO?

543
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,122
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

544
00:40:32,162 --> 00:40:32,862
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking about it.

545
00:40:33,423 --> 00:40:33,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Actraiser.

546
00:40:34,484 --> 00:40:35,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Where everyone plays God.

547
00:40:36,105 --> 00:40:38,166
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be a little bit confusing at some point.

548
00:40:38,206 --> 00:40:38,567
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

549
00:40:38,667 --> 00:40:40,548
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have Holy Wars and shit.

550
00:40:41,249 --> 00:40:42,009
[SPEAKER_06]: For Sky Cake.

551
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:42,990
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.

552
00:40:44,051 --> 00:40:44,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

553
00:40:44,491 --> 00:40:45,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, how about another story?

554
00:40:46,092 --> 00:40:46,933
[SPEAKER_06]: How about Borderlands?

555
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:50,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is what my husband was playing this morning.

556
00:40:52,925 --> 00:40:59,227
[SPEAKER_06]: The Secret Armory of General Nox is the next download content to be coming out.

557
00:41:00,348 --> 00:41:03,049
[SPEAKER_06]: And instead of supposed to have...

558
00:41:05,883 --> 00:41:10,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Like really cool new enemies and a big new place to hang out.

559
00:41:10,825 --> 00:41:18,428
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really have to say that if it's anything like the Island of Dr. Ned, then it's going to be fun.

560
00:41:18,548 --> 00:41:19,409
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be pretty great.

561
00:41:19,609 --> 00:41:21,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, they're raising the level cap.

562
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:25,711
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know how much, but it's raising the level cap.

563
00:41:25,911 --> 00:41:26,551
[SPEAKER_06]: And right now it's at 50.

564
00:41:27,292 --> 00:41:30,533
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe they'll get Legendary Mounts next.

565
00:41:30,733 --> 00:41:35,015
[SPEAKER_14]: How about instead of an add-on like the Island of Dr. Ned, we get the Island of Dr. Brain?

566
00:41:37,074 --> 00:41:37,194
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

567
00:41:37,214 --> 00:41:38,356
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that was an amazing game.

568
00:41:39,377 --> 00:41:40,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that surprised me.

569
00:41:40,579 --> 00:41:42,863
[SPEAKER_06]: The Island of Dr. Ned involved a lot of brains.

570
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:44,254
[SPEAKER_13]: I see.

571
00:41:44,274 --> 00:41:47,655
[SPEAKER_06]: It involved timed headshots that would make their... It was zombies.

572
00:41:47,695 --> 00:41:51,877
[SPEAKER_06]: You had to... I'm not going to say why you had to collect the brains, but it was pretty funny.

573
00:41:52,557 --> 00:41:57,919
[SPEAKER_06]: But you had to get headshots on all the zombies to make their brains pop out of their head, and then you would collect their brains.

574
00:41:59,280 --> 00:41:59,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds pleasant.

575
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,541
[SPEAKER_06]: As you turned in your brains, your first mission is brains.

576
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:04,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Your second mission is brains.

577
00:42:05,242 --> 00:42:07,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Your third mission is brains.

578
00:42:07,543 --> 00:42:08,663
[SPEAKER_06]: The A's would keep increasing.

579
00:42:09,203 --> 00:42:09,864
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty funny.

580
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:10,964
[SPEAKER_06]: And, yeah.

581
00:42:13,479 --> 00:42:19,064
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's travel around the world while Jamie goes and eats some brains.

582
00:42:19,685 --> 00:42:24,530
[SPEAKER_14]: Or maybe some of these yummy potato chips I got at Walgreens.

583
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:27,292
[SPEAKER_14]: These pita chips, yes, thank you.

584
00:42:28,794 --> 00:42:29,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, yes.

585
00:42:29,715 --> 00:42:34,079
[SPEAKER_11]: This week is kind of the calm before the storm as far as releases go.

586
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Not a lot of good stuff coming out, unfortunately.

587
00:42:38,402 --> 00:42:40,523
[SPEAKER_11]: So, instead we- Bite your tongue.

588
00:42:41,103 --> 00:42:41,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Bite your tongue.

589
00:42:41,884 --> 00:42:45,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Why Night Chronicles is this week- Oh, that's right.

590
00:42:45,485 --> 00:42:47,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I said not a lot of good stuff.

591
00:42:48,787 --> 00:42:50,587
[SPEAKER_11]: One title- Sorry, I'm joking on a paper chip.

592
00:42:50,607 --> 00:42:52,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Two titles do not a good week make.

593
00:42:53,169 --> 00:42:56,530
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, so, Imagine Reporter, coming out on DS.

594
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Whoopity shit.

595
00:42:58,691 --> 00:43:02,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Star Trek Online, though, is making it out this week, both the collector's edition and the regular edition.

596
00:43:03,633 --> 00:43:06,115
[SPEAKER_11]: White Knight Chronicles on PlayStation 3 coming out.

597
00:43:06,335 --> 00:43:08,557
[SPEAKER_11]: And that wraps up the good games coming out this week.

598
00:43:08,817 --> 00:43:12,180
[SPEAKER_11]: And also Family Party 30 Great Games Winter Fun on the Wii.

599
00:43:13,281 --> 00:43:15,142
[SPEAKER_11]: The Sims 3 High End Lost Stuff.

600
00:43:16,323 --> 00:43:18,385
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to buy more crap for your fake people.

601
00:43:20,486 --> 00:43:21,868
[SPEAKER_11]: And that would be it.

602
00:43:25,931 --> 00:43:26,211
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

603
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:39,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I'm playing around in chat room because somebody said, or it was Azure Ed said, did someone say PETA chips, but spelled it P-E-T-A, like the people eating tasty animals?

604
00:43:40,623 --> 00:43:44,444
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I tried to slap him, but I accidentally slapped the wrong person in chat, so there we go.

605
00:43:44,504 --> 00:43:47,985
[SPEAKER_14]: I gave the right person a slap there in the chat room.

606
00:43:48,345 --> 00:43:51,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, hey, how about Japan and looking at the Japanese releases?

607
00:43:51,306 --> 00:43:53,647
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if there's any games in Japan where you can slap people yet.

608
00:43:54,347 --> 00:43:55,407
[SPEAKER_14]: We might need to let Shermie out.

609
00:43:55,527 --> 00:43:57,068
[SPEAKER_14]: Shermie's headed towards the door and wants to...

610
00:43:57,792 --> 00:43:58,668
[SPEAKER_14]: there we go, bye Shermie

611
00:44:00,322 --> 00:44:01,142
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the U.S.

612
00:44:01,162 --> 00:44:03,623
[SPEAKER_14]: version with more, I think there's more language options.

613
00:44:27,913 --> 00:44:30,194
[SPEAKER_14]: And honestly, that is really it.

614
00:44:30,235 --> 00:44:41,421
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, there's another game on the PS2 called Momo, Tujji, Taisen, Ryoku 2, coming from Systemsoft, that looks to be some type of adventure game.

615
00:44:41,502 --> 00:44:47,205
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if it's just... There's little cute little animals there, and that poor girl's sitting in a cardboard box.

616
00:44:47,305 --> 00:44:51,508
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know why, but I guess it's about a bunch of homeless chicks with big boobs.

617
00:44:51,688 --> 00:44:52,528
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they're all planes.

618
00:44:52,548 --> 00:44:53,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you notice that they're all planes?

619
00:44:53,349 --> 00:44:54,430
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, they're planes.

620
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:55,030
[SPEAKER_14]: They are.

621
00:44:57,106 --> 00:44:59,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, these girls must turn into planes or something.

622
00:44:59,951 --> 00:45:00,572
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just weird.

623
00:45:00,912 --> 00:45:01,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

624
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:03,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, the Japanese and their fetishes.

625
00:45:03,717 --> 00:45:04,458
[SPEAKER_14]: That is so strange.

626
00:45:04,518 --> 00:45:06,161
[SPEAKER_14]: Her ass is a cardboard box.

627
00:45:06,261 --> 00:45:06,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at that.

628
00:45:07,323 --> 00:45:09,186
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to link that in chat there.

629
00:45:09,466 --> 00:45:10,347
[SPEAKER_14]: She's a hobo plane.

630
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Copy the link there.

631
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,262
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to paste that in chat so you guys can check that out and see if it's weird to you.

632
00:45:16,803 --> 00:45:17,083
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

633
00:45:17,123 --> 00:45:18,243
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's on the PlayStation 2.

634
00:45:18,563 --> 00:45:20,504
[SPEAKER_14]: So they are still cranking out the PS2 games over there.

635
00:45:21,105 --> 00:45:27,567
[SPEAKER_14]: And on the Sony PSP, God Eater comes out.

636
00:45:28,188 --> 00:45:30,249
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that sounds rather pleasant on the PSP.

637
00:45:30,629 --> 00:45:30,889
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

638
00:45:30,909 --> 00:45:31,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that local?

639
00:45:31,789 --> 00:45:34,191
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that some type of game we have here?

640
00:45:34,211 --> 00:45:35,331
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's based off a manga.

641
00:45:35,931 --> 00:45:36,151
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

642
00:45:36,792 --> 00:45:37,252
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it is.

643
00:45:40,254 --> 00:45:41,637
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a fighting game.

644
00:45:42,438 --> 00:45:44,923
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, kind of a fighting game but you can take on multiple things at once.

645
00:45:45,824 --> 00:45:46,145
[SPEAKER_14]: Pretty cool.

646
00:45:48,536 --> 00:45:49,776
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it for Japanese release dates.

647
00:45:49,816 --> 00:45:51,297
[SPEAKER_14]: How about the UK, Jamie?

648
00:45:51,757 --> 00:45:54,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, for the third, we have Chime on Xbox 360.

649
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:57,579
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the fifth, we have a number of things.

650
00:45:57,639 --> 00:45:59,379
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Dante's Inferno.

651
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:02,000
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Disgaea 2, Dark Hero Days.

652
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:03,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Endless Ocean 2.

653
00:46:04,321 --> 00:46:06,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, The Crystal Bearers.

654
00:46:07,362 --> 00:46:09,442
[SPEAKER_06]: MX vs. ATV Reflex.

655
00:46:10,743 --> 00:46:12,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Stalker Call of Pripyat.

656
00:46:13,544 --> 00:46:14,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Silent Hill Shattered Memories.

657
00:46:15,304 --> 00:46:16,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Please, everybody, it's not...

658
00:46:17,725 --> 00:46:18,985
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not Silent Hill as you know it.

659
00:46:19,546 --> 00:46:22,546
[SPEAKER_14]: If you like running, you'll love Silent Hill Shattered Memories.

660
00:46:22,726 --> 00:46:26,668
[SPEAKER_06]: If you like a lot of frustrating fucking trial and error, then you'll like it.

661
00:46:28,028 --> 00:46:29,048
[SPEAKER_11]: This is kind of funny.

662
00:46:29,288 --> 00:46:32,729
[SPEAKER_11]: They should have combined Walk It Out with Silent Hill Shattered Memories.

663
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:34,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Wouldn't that be hilarious?

664
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:37,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Last on my list is the best on the list.

665
00:46:37,551 --> 00:46:38,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Trek Online.

666
00:46:39,311 --> 00:46:40,312
[SPEAKER_06]: I have already been playing it.

667
00:46:40,552 --> 00:46:41,452
[SPEAKER_06]: It is tons of fun.

668
00:46:41,912 --> 00:46:45,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, now that the beta is over, I have to remake my fucking character.

669
00:46:45,967 --> 00:46:46,648
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

670
00:47:01,107 --> 00:47:01,828
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

671
00:47:21,287 --> 00:47:49,493
[SPEAKER_06]: but if you were not if you were like looking at your ship sideways you could not turn it around adjust your camera do anything without it trying to readjust itself based on where your enemy was and it would never lock on the enemy when you were close by so it'd be like I'm trying to shoot these Borg I'm trying to shoot these whatever they are I did though I really liked the away missions those were fun

672
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:55,533
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I liked it when you were on the world as the player, but I didn't care for that.

673
00:47:55,573 --> 00:48:03,398
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked the one mission, I don't know if you did it, it was one of your emergency missions, where you have to go and talk to these miners, and you find out why they're so pissed off at their boss.

674
00:48:03,718 --> 00:48:03,958
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

675
00:48:04,278 --> 00:48:08,981
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think it was such a great thing that had diplomatic missions and little things in there, stuff that...

676
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:11,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Starfleet Officers Starfleet Officers

677
00:48:34,313 --> 00:48:38,555
[SPEAKER_06]: and you get emergency missions sometimes on your way as you pass by other places.

678
00:48:39,096 --> 00:48:46,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Although really the first thing I'm going to freaking do as soon as my ship is up to it is go hang out at DS9 for a while.

679
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:47,820
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in there.

680
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:48,320
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in there.

681
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:48,900
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you know?

682
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:49,661
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I didn't know that.

683
00:48:49,701 --> 00:48:50,081
[SPEAKER_14]: That's great.

684
00:48:50,161 --> 00:48:52,502
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a video up of someone actually trying to go through the wormhole.

685
00:48:52,642 --> 00:48:53,222
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was funny.

686
00:48:53,583 --> 00:48:53,883
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

687
00:48:55,604 --> 00:48:56,004
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

688
00:48:56,064 --> 00:48:58,105
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what's up next?

689
00:48:59,185 --> 00:49:00,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Back to some gaming news.

690
00:49:00,086 --> 00:49:02,687
[SPEAKER_06]: I just totally made myself an utter geek.

691
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:04,319
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.

692
00:49:05,539 --> 00:49:10,881
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I want to like play Star Trek Online and then just kill all the creatures.

693
00:49:11,721 --> 00:49:16,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Do they have any diplomatic away missions where you're supposed to not kill things and then if you do, that's bad?

694
00:49:16,502 --> 00:49:20,523
[SPEAKER_06]: I think those you just are actually set to talk to them because you can't actually fire at someone who's not an enemy.

695
00:49:21,063 --> 00:49:22,283
[SPEAKER_06]: But you should totally play Klingon.

696
00:49:23,223 --> 00:49:24,264
[SPEAKER_11]: That's unfortunate.

697
00:49:24,684 --> 00:49:25,884
[SPEAKER_06]: You should totally play Klingon.

698
00:49:26,769 --> 00:49:29,450
[SPEAKER_11]: See, that's what I do in Spore, is just kill people.

699
00:49:29,651 --> 00:49:32,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh wait, no, I don't do that in Spore because I don't play Spore anymore.

700
00:49:33,433 --> 00:49:34,053
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

701
00:49:34,393 --> 00:49:35,534
[SPEAKER_06]: You should just totally play a Klingon.

702
00:49:35,554 --> 00:49:41,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you can call your commanding officer a coward and then kill him and take his position.

703
00:49:42,487 --> 00:49:46,953
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know what Spore has to do with this next story they have?

704
00:49:47,413 --> 00:49:48,955
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, both of them have DRM.

705
00:49:49,616 --> 00:49:53,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Ubisoft is now introducing a new online enabled DRM for their PC games.

706
00:49:54,401 --> 00:49:59,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, you're going to be able to install the game on, you know,

707
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:14,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever PCs you want, you just have to be connected to the internet in order to be logged into your Ubi.com account to play the games, even if you want to just play single player games.

708
00:50:14,784 --> 00:50:21,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds wonderful and all, but somehow I have a feeling that they're going to get around it just as easy as they got around the DRM on the EA games, but...

709
00:50:22,253 --> 00:50:34,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I guess that's neat and stuff that they don't limit you to how many PCs you can install your stuff onto, but some people out there don't have internet access or don't have broadband internet access.

710
00:50:35,278 --> 00:50:38,039
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess those people won't be buying those Ubisoft games.

711
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:40,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Just hopefully they make it very clear.

712
00:50:43,395 --> 00:50:53,902
[SPEAKER_11]: But I guess this is kind of similar to some of the Steam games that they have out there now that they require that you're logged in to the internet.

713
00:50:54,482 --> 00:50:56,724
[SPEAKER_11]: But I guess that's not true for all Steam games.

714
00:50:57,845 --> 00:50:58,125
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

715
00:50:59,352 --> 00:51:00,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, here's the question.

716
00:51:00,353 --> 00:51:06,716
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I understand these gaming companies have to do whatever they have to do to try and curb piracy because it's getting way out of control, especially on PC games.

717
00:51:06,736 --> 00:51:07,396
[SPEAKER_14]: It's so easy.

718
00:51:08,036 --> 00:51:22,784
[SPEAKER_14]: But there's always somebody going to play that card like, okay, well, if you require an internet connection to validate the game, what happens to the military guys overseas who don't have an internet connection and these computer games are a way that they can de-stress in downtime?

719
00:51:23,564 --> 00:51:25,586
[SPEAKER_14]: That card always gets played somehow.

720
00:51:25,926 --> 00:51:31,251
[SPEAKER_14]: Any DRM scheme has to take that stuff into consideration.

721
00:51:31,291 --> 00:51:36,155
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some people who legitimately don't have internet and are trying to legitimately play games.

722
00:51:36,756 --> 00:51:38,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Could they call an 800 number?

723
00:51:38,738 --> 00:51:39,198
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

724
00:51:39,538 --> 00:51:40,039
[SPEAKER_11]: What would happen?

725
00:51:40,339 --> 00:51:43,463
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they're not going to be able to call an 800 number.

726
00:51:43,603 --> 00:51:56,941
[SPEAKER_11]: And really what it's going to come down to is any DRM scheme that you have out there, really there's no way that you're going to be able to ensure that people aren't stealing your product because...

727
00:51:57,862 --> 00:51:59,823
[SPEAKER_11]: There's always going to be a way around everything.

728
00:52:00,483 --> 00:52:13,267
[SPEAKER_11]: Whether it be some extremes I can see them going to as a physical dongle that you have to stick into your USB drive or something like that that authenticates your copy that you have and you can't play it unless that's plugged in there.

729
00:52:13,587 --> 00:52:24,950
[SPEAKER_11]: They do that with some software programs out there but it's very rare and even those can be emulated or copied and nothing's perfect.

730
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:29,654
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, here's what Frisbee in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and just makes a very clear statement.

731
00:52:29,934 --> 00:52:32,757
[SPEAKER_14]: Frisbee says, DRM will always be cracked.

732
00:52:33,177 --> 00:52:33,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Give it up.

733
00:52:35,439 --> 00:52:35,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Agree?

734
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:36,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

735
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:41,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, and even DLC can be cracked and always is.

736
00:52:42,065 --> 00:52:42,305
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

737
00:53:12,593 --> 00:53:28,461
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's something that's going to inconvenience somebody, whether it be requiring a disk, or you have to be online, or you have to install some sort of rootkit on your system in order for it to work, someone's going to get pissed off and try to hack it around.

738
00:53:29,522 --> 00:53:32,163
[SPEAKER_14]: Some more comments from chat, and Frisbee makes another point here.

739
00:53:32,323 --> 00:53:33,824
[SPEAKER_14]: What happens when the servers crap out?

740
00:53:36,865 --> 00:53:39,566
[SPEAKER_14]: So if these servers that authenticate the games or whatever, what happens if they die?

741
00:53:39,666 --> 00:53:42,868
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to send out a patch and it'll probably remove the DRM from the game.

742
00:53:42,948 --> 00:53:48,210
[SPEAKER_14]: What if all the servers... Well, that's Steam's contingency plan, supposedly.

743
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:50,611
[SPEAKER_14]: If Steam were to ever disappear, they would do that.

744
00:53:51,151 --> 00:53:53,892
[SPEAKER_14]: But that isn't the same thing that Ubisoft has necessarily said.

745
00:53:54,052 --> 00:53:54,372
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

746
00:53:55,353 --> 00:54:05,297
[SPEAKER_14]: Ray Ayanami says, If I was a developer, I'd just say fuck it to DRM and just put in a finger-wagging message that says, While we thank you for your interest in this game, we would appreciate it if you'd buy a legitimate copy if possible.

747
00:54:06,499 --> 00:54:12,462
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I have to admit, I always did like the kind of gotcha thing that some of those Super Nintendo games did.

748
00:54:12,502 --> 00:54:13,242
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, what was it?

749
00:54:13,422 --> 00:54:20,026
[SPEAKER_14]: One of those games, if you were playing, like, a hacked version, Earthbound would be way harder.

750
00:54:20,066 --> 00:54:25,709
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, if you were playing, like, a pirated copy of Earthbound, it would be way harder, and then when you get to the very last boss, it deletes your save game.

751
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:28,490
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, that's just evil, but kind of funny in a way.

752
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:32,292
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if somebody's pirating it, they can't complain at what the game did.

753
00:54:32,692 --> 00:54:36,134
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it might make them really pissed off so they never actually buy the game legitimately, but...

754
00:54:36,854 --> 00:54:42,458
[SPEAKER_14]: Just kind of... Most people didn't know that that kind of prevention was in there until it was too late.

755
00:54:44,259 --> 00:54:47,001
[SPEAKER_14]: Frisbee continues and says, DRM does nothing to stop piracy.

756
00:54:47,441 --> 00:54:48,962
[SPEAKER_14]: Just screws over real players.

757
00:54:49,082 --> 00:54:51,143
[SPEAKER_14]: What pirate would keep DRM in the game?

758
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:57,207
[SPEAKER_11]: The other thing too, DRM, especially if it's not made in-house, although Oobies might be made in-house or they may be licensed.

759
00:54:57,307 --> 00:54:59,108
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if they're licensing it from somebody else.

760
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:01,690
[SPEAKER_11]: But, I mean, that costs these companies money too.

761
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:02,090
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

762
00:55:03,451 --> 00:55:09,119
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's just going to get defeated immediately, then you might as well just save the money and just not have it...

763
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,281
[SPEAKER_11]: or just not have the DRM in there.

764
00:55:13,321 --> 00:55:14,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Just save whatever.

765
00:55:14,781 --> 00:55:18,042
[SPEAKER_11]: At least I'm going to save myself X amount of thousands of dollars.

766
00:55:19,102 --> 00:55:21,242
[SPEAKER_14]: D5T in chat kind of half jokes here.

767
00:55:21,342 --> 00:55:24,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Next-gen consoles will need a pin drop of your blood to start the game up.

768
00:55:25,343 --> 00:55:28,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, hey, don't they already have laptops now that are like fingerprints or something?

769
00:55:28,524 --> 00:55:31,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Biometric scanners.

770
00:55:31,105 --> 00:55:34,306
[SPEAKER_14]: As that technology comes down, it may be not your blood, but your fingerprint.

771
00:55:34,986 --> 00:55:35,406
[SPEAKER_14]: Who knows?

772
00:55:36,206 --> 00:55:36,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Could you imagine that?

773
00:55:37,006 --> 00:55:39,527
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to press your fingerprint in order to start a game?

774
00:55:40,567 --> 00:55:50,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't they look at how console games are doing DRM and stuff like that?

775
00:55:50,454 --> 00:55:54,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't they look at that and try to match something that they're doing there?

776
00:55:55,098 --> 00:55:55,398
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

777
00:55:55,698 --> 00:56:02,424
[SPEAKER_14]: A decipher in chat reminds us, I think speaking of my whole little Earthbound story there, that happened with a recent release of a game.

778
00:56:02,464 --> 00:56:06,067
[SPEAKER_14]: A guy complained in the forums of a bug and it outed him as a pirate.

779
00:56:06,087 --> 00:56:07,528
[SPEAKER_14]: That was Arkham Asylum, wasn't it?

780
00:56:07,568 --> 00:56:18,056
[SPEAKER_14]: Like there was some type of trick that Batman couldn't do in the copied version and somebody went to the forums to complain about it and it's how they knew that he pirated the game.

781
00:56:19,438 --> 00:56:22,661
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, at the same time, I kind of look at that and go, that's kind of funny.

782
00:56:22,801 --> 00:56:24,723
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, they're within their rights to do that.

783
00:56:24,743 --> 00:56:26,465
[SPEAKER_11]: They did the same thing with Grand Theft Auto 4.

784
00:56:26,525 --> 00:56:31,530
[SPEAKER_11]: You'd have the drunk cam on all the time if you pirated the game so your camera would be shaking around like you're drunk.

785
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:35,894
[SPEAKER_11]: But there was a patch within a week of it coming out that fixed that.

786
00:56:36,955 --> 00:56:38,276
[SPEAKER_11]: Same with the Arkham Asylum stuff.

787
00:56:38,296 --> 00:56:40,238
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a patch already fixing that problem.

788
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,120
[SPEAKER_11]: within a week or so.

789
00:56:44,741 --> 00:56:47,443
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just not going to really matter.

790
00:56:47,963 --> 00:56:51,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody's going to find a way around it no matter what you do.

791
00:56:51,645 --> 00:56:56,208
[SPEAKER_11]: So you might as well just give up because all you're doing is delaying the inevitable and wasting money.

792
00:56:57,734 --> 00:57:01,816
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, well let's move on to one more story here before we get to the classic game of the week.

793
00:57:01,836 --> 00:57:05,218
[SPEAKER_14]: And this has to do with what I believe will be a highly anticipated game.

794
00:57:05,979 --> 00:57:11,142
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully this doesn't get pirated too much though, because this is some real A-list talent behind this.

795
00:57:11,202 --> 00:57:12,923
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the folks at Platinum Games.

796
00:57:13,303 --> 00:57:14,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

797
00:57:28,354 --> 00:57:29,314
[SPEAKER_14]: The game looks awesome.

798
00:57:29,454 --> 00:57:32,796
[SPEAKER_14]: It's called Vanquish, is the game that Loki is referring to.

799
00:57:33,296 --> 00:57:35,977
[SPEAKER_14]: Vanquish appears to be a futuristic shooter game.

800
00:57:36,017 --> 00:57:39,478
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess it takes place in San Francisco, so not that far from here.

801
00:57:40,158 --> 00:57:47,101
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess it's in the future, and well, obviously there's not a lot known about the actual game itself.

802
00:57:47,121 --> 00:57:50,902
[SPEAKER_14]: The trailer used a bunch of cutscenes and live action stuff.

803
00:57:51,923 --> 00:57:54,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you actually watch the whole debut on TV?

804
00:57:54,666 --> 00:57:55,707
[SPEAKER_11]: I watched the trailer, though.

805
00:57:56,107 --> 00:57:56,528
[SPEAKER_11]: What did you think?

806
00:57:56,788 --> 00:57:57,529
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it looks cool.

807
00:57:57,649 --> 00:57:59,571
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm definitely excited for it.

808
00:57:59,611 --> 00:58:03,335
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like something that will be on next-gen consoles, not a Wii game.

809
00:58:03,816 --> 00:58:06,218
[SPEAKER_11]: But even their Wii game, Mad World, is pretty awesome.

810
00:58:06,238 --> 00:58:11,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, not a lot of people play mature games on the Wii, which is really sad.

811
00:58:12,105 --> 00:58:14,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you know, really sweet game.

812
00:58:14,647 --> 00:58:24,075
[SPEAKER_11]: And I, you know, I think for Platinum Games, what they really should do on some of these, you know, mature titles that they put out for the Wii, just to re-release them on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, I think that'd be a great idea.

813
00:58:24,116 --> 00:58:29,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Mad World, support that sucker, you know, with high-definition graphics to, you know, the 360.

814
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,822
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it'd sell like crazy.

815
00:58:31,342 --> 00:58:33,985
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you could sell, you know, the motion controls in there, big deal.

816
00:58:34,005 --> 00:58:36,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Just use something with the right analog stick or something.

817
00:58:36,887 --> 00:58:37,187
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

818
00:58:37,407 --> 00:58:38,667
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be pretty awesome.

819
00:58:39,628 --> 00:58:41,688
[SPEAKER_11]: But this new game looks really cool.

820
00:58:41,728 --> 00:58:43,529
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking forward to hearing a little bit more about it.

821
00:58:43,629 --> 00:58:46,429
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, because we don't even know what platform it's on.

822
00:58:46,469 --> 00:58:51,690
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we can assume, like Bayonetta, it'll be PS3 and 360, but we don't know that for sure yet.

823
00:58:53,591 --> 00:58:56,151
[SPEAKER_14]: And we don't know if it's going to be multiplayer.

824
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:57,732
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we don't know much about that yet.

825
00:58:57,872 --> 00:58:58,992
[SPEAKER_14]: But more to come soon.

826
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:02,074
[SPEAKER_14]: I imagine this is going to be an E3 all-star right here.

827
00:59:02,154 --> 00:59:02,334
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably.

828
00:59:02,354 --> 00:59:04,096
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be something you're hearing a lot about at E3.

829
00:59:04,216 --> 00:59:05,056
[SPEAKER_14]: It's called Vanquish.

830
00:59:05,537 --> 00:59:06,157
[SPEAKER_14]: So look out for that.

831
00:59:06,257 --> 00:59:08,879
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously Bayonetta, we're huge fans of that here at OLR.

832
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:14,243
[SPEAKER_14]: Although this is, I mean, it's still the same studio, but it's kind of, it sounds like a different branch.

833
00:59:14,703 --> 00:59:19,026
[SPEAKER_14]: So anything could happen here, but Outlook so far looks pretty good, yeah?

834
00:59:19,127 --> 00:59:21,308
[SPEAKER_11]: I think all their Platinum games have been really good.

835
00:59:21,368 --> 00:59:21,769
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just...

836
00:59:24,372 --> 00:59:24,732
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

837
00:59:25,513 --> 00:59:29,216
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, mature games don't do well on the Wii.

838
00:59:30,057 --> 00:59:30,698
[SPEAKER_11]: That's too bad.

839
00:59:31,438 --> 00:59:32,879
[SPEAKER_14]: But this one's not going to be on the Wii, right?

840
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:33,760
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope not.

841
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:35,342
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think that it will be.

842
00:59:35,622 --> 00:59:36,362
[SPEAKER_11]: It didn't look like it.

843
00:59:36,523 --> 00:59:38,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Based on the graphics you saw, you're thinking no, right?

844
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:39,005
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

845
00:59:40,046 --> 00:59:46,972
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, well, let's take a trip down memory lane and some of the classics we always hear every week at Orange Lawn Trader, like take a trip...

846
00:59:48,024 --> 00:59:49,925
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't remember what I picked last time.

847
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,421
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you want me to tell you or do you want to wait?

848
01:00:14,741 --> 01:00:15,522
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have to look.

849
01:00:15,682 --> 01:00:18,983
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll look it up while you talk about this week's game.

850
01:00:19,463 --> 01:00:21,744
[SPEAKER_14]: But I fully approve of what you've picked for this week.

851
01:00:21,844 --> 01:00:23,565
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about damn time I did this one.

852
01:00:23,685 --> 01:00:24,506
[SPEAKER_14]: It's about damn time.

853
01:00:25,206 --> 01:00:27,767
[SPEAKER_06]: This week's game is Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past.

854
01:00:29,248 --> 01:00:38,692
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would love to play the music, but one of those audio difficulties I warned you about before the show was that some things are not installed, including Flash, so I can't use YouTube just yet.

855
01:00:39,352 --> 01:00:39,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Never fear, though.

856
01:00:40,032 --> 01:00:41,233
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I have some...

857
01:00:42,661 --> 01:00:46,203
[SPEAKER_14]: of the ripped files here on my drive, so I'll pull those up instead.

858
01:00:46,223 --> 01:00:47,164
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, Jamie.

859
01:00:47,424 --> 01:00:56,270
[SPEAKER_06]: In Japan, it was called Zelda no Densetsu Kamigami no Triforce, which was The Legend of Zelda Triforce of the Gods.

860
01:00:57,731 --> 01:00:57,871
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

861
01:01:02,757 --> 01:01:03,938
[SPEAKER_14]: This is arranged, but still.

862
01:01:20,563 --> 01:01:21,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark World Link turns into a bunny

863
01:01:39,915 --> 01:01:58,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I mean, you had all kinds of cool attacks, and you could go get the Master Sword by running through the forest, and you could swim, and just... One of the big things that got me is because it had that sort of dual world aspect to it, that you could often do things in one world that would affect the other.

864
01:01:58,862 --> 01:02:05,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, for example, when you're going to the ice level in the Dark World, if you would have to throw your portal...

865
01:02:07,345 --> 01:02:21,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, in one place, and then walk to a certain place in the light world, and then use your mirror again, and you would be inside the walls of the fortress.

866
01:02:21,289 --> 01:02:22,609
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was pretty cool.

867
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:28,811
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really, really liked just the overall play to it.

868
01:02:28,891 --> 01:02:32,152
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a game that I have gone back and just played a bajillion times over.

869
01:02:33,152 --> 01:02:38,137
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I probably have whole sections of this game completely freaking memorized.

870
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:51,068
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was actually watching people glitching out the game today by trying to run a dash when you call the bird with the ocarina.

871
01:02:51,669 --> 01:02:53,350
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's in the DS version.

872
01:02:53,991 --> 01:02:58,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, which reminds me, there is a DS version and, of course, the virtual console version.

873
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:13,964
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, the game came out for the Super Famicom in Japan, and it was released in 1991 and in the US and Europe in 1992.

874
01:03:15,364 --> 01:03:16,604
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what's funny?

875
01:03:16,645 --> 01:03:19,986
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you another funny thing about this one, Rob.

876
01:03:20,286 --> 01:03:21,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, look what I got.

877
01:03:21,106 --> 01:03:22,346
[SPEAKER_14]: I got the real music here.

878
01:03:22,446 --> 01:03:22,787
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at that.

879
01:03:22,827 --> 01:03:23,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Here, let's hear this for a minute.

880
01:03:24,707 --> 01:03:31,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this particular game because it's a bunch of different musics.

881
01:03:31,992 --> 01:03:32,353
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

882
01:03:32,393 --> 01:03:33,413
[SPEAKER_14]: I just have to say for a minute.

883
01:03:33,494 --> 01:03:34,134
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, Jamie.

884
01:03:34,174 --> 01:03:35,175
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you have more to say.

885
01:03:35,995 --> 01:03:37,776
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of controversy going on in chat right now.

886
01:03:38,057 --> 01:03:39,137
[SPEAKER_14]: Some people are saying, I love this game.

887
01:03:39,157 --> 01:03:40,138
[SPEAKER_14]: Some people are saying, I hate this game.

888
01:03:40,298 --> 01:03:43,000
[SPEAKER_14]: I personally, well, not that they hate it, but it's not the best in the series.

889
01:03:43,761 --> 01:03:46,643
[SPEAKER_14]: By far my favorite Zelda game they ever put out.

890
01:03:47,043 --> 01:03:47,823
[SPEAKER_14]: Great music.

891
01:03:48,044 --> 01:03:48,984
[SPEAKER_14]: Great gameplay.

892
01:03:49,905 --> 01:03:51,746
[SPEAKER_14]: This is by far my favorite Zelda game ever.

893
01:03:51,766 --> 01:03:51,946
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree.

894
01:03:52,086 --> 01:03:52,927
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that it's my favorite.

895
01:03:52,927 --> 01:03:53,527
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite too.

896
01:03:53,888 --> 01:03:55,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I do really like Ocarina.

897
01:03:58,792 --> 01:04:04,356
[SPEAKER_06]: But now, actually there was a little bit more to this one.

898
01:04:04,576 --> 01:04:07,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, did you know that there was a comic that came out?

899
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,341
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually published in Nintendo Power.

900
01:04:11,602 --> 01:04:13,384
[SPEAKER_06]: And they put it out in the US too.

901
01:04:14,084 --> 01:04:14,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember that, Rob?

902
01:04:16,346 --> 01:04:17,667
[SPEAKER_06]: The Zelda comic from Nintendo Power?

903
01:04:18,348 --> 01:04:19,929
[SPEAKER_14]: Very vaguely.

904
01:04:20,009 --> 01:04:20,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

905
01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:22,451
[SPEAKER_06]: There's actually a picture from it.

906
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:25,690
[SPEAKER_06]: If any of that looks familiar.

907
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:30,392
[SPEAKER_06]: It's by the same guy who did the... I think who did Howard and Nestor.

908
01:04:31,292 --> 01:04:33,233
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I vaguely remember it.

909
01:04:34,693 --> 01:04:35,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, at any rate...

910
01:04:37,245 --> 01:04:40,127
[SPEAKER_06]: There was another follow-up to Link to the Past that came out in Japan.

911
01:04:40,187 --> 01:04:48,934
[SPEAKER_06]: It was BS Zelda no Densetsu Kodai no Sekiban, which is BS The Legend of Zelda Ancient Stone Tablets or Stone Tablets of Antiquity.

912
01:04:49,394 --> 01:04:54,037
[SPEAKER_06]: That was one of the Satellaview games and you could voice broadcast using the sound link.

913
01:04:55,138 --> 01:05:21,151
[SPEAKER_06]: and it was supposed to be set around the same time as Link's Awakening but you don't use Link you play as the Heroes of Light and who they are are the Satellavie mascots who you could also see in BS Zelda No Densetsu which I had a the Satellavie one ran on like a time system and there are hacked ROMs out there where you can play with your time counter turned off um

914
01:05:24,306 --> 01:05:32,893
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there was another version of A Link to the Past that came out on Satellaview as well.

915
01:05:34,395 --> 01:05:38,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Then, of course, there was A Link to the Past and Four Swords.

916
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:40,120
[SPEAKER_06]: There was also...

917
01:05:42,262 --> 01:05:48,147
[SPEAKER_06]: If I'm right, I think they actually reserved a lot of the sound effects for Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, so that was pretty cool.

918
01:05:49,728 --> 01:05:53,491
[SPEAKER_06]: But that is, overall, I'd have to say probably my favorite in this series.

919
01:05:56,014 --> 01:05:56,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Very worthy.

920
01:05:58,596 --> 01:06:01,498
[SPEAKER_06]: If no one's played this game, I pity you.

921
01:06:01,738 --> 01:06:02,339
[SPEAKER_06]: I pity Dafu.

922
01:06:04,434 --> 01:06:05,797
[SPEAKER_14]: Go get it on Virtual Console.

923
01:06:06,138 --> 01:06:07,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, at least.

924
01:06:07,481 --> 01:06:09,485
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually get the cart kind of cheap, too.

925
01:06:09,946 --> 01:06:13,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Just one thing to remember is it doesn't run on a battery backup, so you have to be a little careful.

926
01:06:13,654 --> 01:06:14,676
[SPEAKER_06]: We still have our saved games.

927
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, this is one of the games now that I'll just sit and play with the Game Genie on.

928
01:06:20,624 --> 01:06:22,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Just so I can just run through the whole game.

929
01:06:22,305 --> 01:06:27,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, I mean, for me, what I like to do is I like to play through the game once without cheating.

930
01:06:27,409 --> 01:06:31,873
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I like to just cheat like a mofo the second time through and just enjoy the story.

931
01:06:32,413 --> 01:06:36,557
[SPEAKER_06]: But even so, I mean, this wasn't super hard.

932
01:06:36,577 --> 01:06:37,758
[SPEAKER_06]: There were really difficult parts.

933
01:06:38,458 --> 01:06:40,640
[SPEAKER_13]: This is some of my favorite music in the game right here.

934
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:41,681
[SPEAKER_13]: I love this song.

935
01:06:42,762 --> 01:06:43,662
[SPEAKER_13]: In the early palaces.

936
01:06:45,384 --> 01:06:46,585
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

937
01:06:46,665 --> 01:06:47,886
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I like that music too.

938
01:06:51,269 --> 01:06:58,594
[SPEAKER_06]: I never liked the palace music from the... This is the force music.

939
01:07:03,979 --> 01:07:06,020
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the most amazing game soundtracks ever.

940
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:10,764
[SPEAKER_14]: I know a lot of people think Final Fantasy is where all the music's at, but this seriously... Seriously.

941
01:07:11,185 --> 01:07:11,745
[SPEAKER_14]: Zelda's got...

942
01:07:13,286 --> 01:07:14,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Just awesome music.

943
01:07:14,287 --> 01:07:18,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know the big thing, it's actually showing Baking Through the Palace.

944
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:30,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the little touches in it, like if you had the places that you could fall off the cliff, you could make the guys charge you, and they would run off the ledge, or you could throw a pot at them, and they would fall off on the ledge.

945
01:07:31,078 --> 01:07:32,158
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I thought that was great.

946
01:07:32,178 --> 01:07:33,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Or you could just throw a chicken off the ledge.

947
01:07:33,579 --> 01:07:42,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, you know what one of my favorite levels in this one was, where you go to the thief's village, and you have to take the girl into the sunlight, and she turns into Blind the Thief.

948
01:07:42,865 --> 01:07:43,566
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.

949
01:07:44,246 --> 01:07:49,931
[SPEAKER_06]: That was, and I love, this is the game that made the hookshot replace the boomerang.

950
01:07:50,592 --> 01:07:54,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it just me, or was the hookshot the single best item in the damn game?

951
01:07:56,237 --> 01:07:57,578
[SPEAKER_06]: That and the freaking medallions?

952
01:07:59,099 --> 01:08:00,801
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe, I do remember the hookshot being pretty odd.

953
01:08:00,821 --> 01:08:04,183
[SPEAKER_06]: The bomb goes medallion, it sets the world on fire, it was fantastic.

954
01:08:05,444 --> 01:08:08,327
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, this, totally, totally, totally, totally my game.

955
01:08:09,184 --> 01:08:10,644
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

956
01:08:10,664 --> 01:08:12,285
[SPEAKER_14]: A true classic in many respects.

957
01:08:12,465 --> 01:08:14,926
[SPEAKER_14]: Zelda, A Link to the Past on the Super Nintendo.

958
01:08:16,266 --> 01:08:19,187
[SPEAKER_14]: And most surprisingly, DarkSakura picked a non-Sega game this week.

959
01:08:19,207 --> 01:08:19,727
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm very proud.

960
01:08:19,987 --> 01:08:21,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I picked a non-Sega game on purpose.

961
01:08:21,247 --> 01:08:24,808
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, Rob, I do have something that I might be able to lend you if you've still got Super Nintendo.

962
01:08:25,649 --> 01:08:27,549
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if I have a Super Nintendo still.

963
01:08:27,649 --> 01:08:28,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't we give you the Super Nintendo?

964
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:30,190
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it was a regular Nintendo.

965
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:30,890
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

966
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:32,871
[SPEAKER_14]: In the midst of moving to is not a good time.

967
01:08:33,411 --> 01:08:33,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Plenty later.

968
01:08:34,011 --> 01:08:34,771
[SPEAKER_14]: But in a month, yeah.

969
01:08:35,552 --> 01:08:37,092
[SPEAKER_06]: We have two copies of Super Mario RPG.

970
01:08:37,719 --> 01:08:38,119
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, sweet.

971
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:39,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Sweet.

972
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,700
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to find my copy of Super Metroid.

973
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:42,121
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a game I really want to play again.

974
01:08:42,261 --> 01:08:43,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we have another one?

975
01:08:43,281 --> 01:08:45,182
[SPEAKER_14]: I could do the Wii console thing, but you know.

976
01:08:45,242 --> 01:08:47,923
[SPEAKER_06]: There's something about playing Super Metroid on the right system.

977
01:08:48,103 --> 01:08:49,904
[SPEAKER_14]: It's having the Super Nintendo controller.

978
01:08:50,364 --> 01:08:51,545
[SPEAKER_14]: It's having that same controller.

979
01:08:51,705 --> 01:08:54,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, you need to call in sick to work and hang out with me tonight and play some Super Metroid.

980
01:08:55,166 --> 01:08:56,348
[SPEAKER_14]: I would love to if I could.

981
01:08:57,389 --> 01:08:58,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Call him dead.

982
01:08:58,630 --> 01:08:59,311
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's the great thing.

983
01:08:59,371 --> 01:09:07,361
[SPEAKER_14]: When I get my new place that's going to be by myself, I can set it all up without anybody complaining or having other things.

984
01:09:07,561 --> 01:09:08,442
[SPEAKER_14]: You could just come over.

985
01:09:08,622 --> 01:09:09,563
[SPEAKER_14]: We plug in the system.

986
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:10,044
[SPEAKER_14]: We're good to go.

987
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:10,825
[SPEAKER_14]: We broadcast.

988
01:09:11,085 --> 01:09:12,727
[SPEAKER_14]: We can do that kind of stuff on the fly a lot easier.

989
01:09:12,747 --> 01:09:13,548
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be amazing.

990
01:09:13,748 --> 01:09:14,269
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we should do.

991
01:09:14,289 --> 01:09:14,709
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm excited.

992
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:15,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Woohoo!

993
01:09:39,051 --> 01:09:40,973
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not more Top Trumps is it?

994
01:09:55,248 --> 01:10:21,457
[SPEAKER_14]: I know it's free on Xbox Live and Playstation 3 some of the early reviews I heard on it were very good I downloaded the free version on Playstation 3 because I think it hit that marketplace a couple days before the Xbox one you can download the pilot for free in HD so I still want to check that out maybe I'll see if the chat has anything to say about Caprica while we take a break tonight but for those of you on the podcast we'll be back in just a couple seconds with more of Orange Lounge Radio

995
01:10:28,223 --> 01:10:32,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello everybody out there and welcome back to another Part B here at Orange Lounge Radio.

996
01:10:32,385 --> 01:10:38,847
[SPEAKER_14]: It's episode number 353 and trying to have fun with our new mixing board and some of our audio setup.

997
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:47,430
[SPEAKER_14]: We're still trying to get used to some things and the podcast listeners won't really hear this, but the live listeners are hearing some interesting fluctuation in our audio when we stop the recording.

998
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:48,431
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're still trying to...

999
01:10:49,031 --> 01:11:10,167
[SPEAKER_14]: figure everything out here at OLR Studios but for the most part the feedback we're getting so far is that the soundboard sounds really good in fact I was going to get into Twitter topics a little bit here but one of the early tweets I have here is from Blue Swim on Twitter saying at OLR very nice soundboard hope you guys get to try it out tonight and yes we're here we're live so I hope he's listening

1000
01:11:11,548 --> 01:11:18,352
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll get back into some Twitter topics in just a minute, but first, thought we could get into some rapid fire news here in studio.

1001
01:11:18,392 --> 01:11:22,234
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a lot of news to cover tonight, so Loki, what's on deck?

1002
01:11:22,555 --> 01:11:31,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, lots of Capcom release dates, including Super Street Fighter 4 has been announced to be coming out in North America on April 27th.

1003
01:11:33,562 --> 01:11:44,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Lost Planet 2 also now on May 18th and I don't believe it was in the article here but Monster Hunter Tri coming out April 20th as well.

1004
01:11:46,039 --> 01:11:49,905
[SPEAKER_11]: They're waiting to announce that because of the classic controller pro being bundled in there.

1005
01:11:52,827 --> 01:12:04,297
[SPEAKER_11]: One game, though, that is going to be not coming out soon will be No More Heroes Paradise, the kind of Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 port of the Wii title.

1006
01:12:05,078 --> 01:12:08,881
[SPEAKER_11]: That was originally supposed to be coming out in Japan on February 25th.

1007
01:12:09,281 --> 01:12:14,346
[SPEAKER_11]: However, now it's been pushed back, and no word yet on when it's going to be coming out.

1008
01:12:14,806 --> 01:12:17,408
[SPEAKER_11]: They're looking maybe at some point in April now.

1009
01:12:19,449 --> 01:12:27,072
[SPEAKER_11]: Red Seal 2 is coming out March 23rd in the US and March 26th in Europe.

1010
01:12:27,572 --> 01:12:33,614
[SPEAKER_11]: That will be available both the game by itself and bundled with Wii Motion Plus.

1011
01:12:36,015 --> 01:12:36,936
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks pretty awesome.

1012
01:12:37,056 --> 01:12:38,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Way better than the first one.

1013
01:12:40,357 --> 01:12:41,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is a relief.

1014
01:12:42,774 --> 01:12:50,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, well I got some news for you as well, including God of War 3 I was talking about a little bit during my gaming week, watching the demo get played there.

1015
01:12:50,426 --> 01:12:51,067
[SPEAKER_14]: It is dated.

1016
01:12:51,707 --> 01:12:54,151
[SPEAKER_14]: March 16th is the date that this game is coming out.

1017
01:12:54,592 --> 01:12:55,794
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not that far away.

1018
01:12:55,854 --> 01:12:57,777
[SPEAKER_14]: That's only like a month and a half, if that.

1019
01:12:58,277 --> 01:12:59,918
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of good games coming out in the spring.

1020
01:13:00,058 --> 01:13:03,219
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a very weird year that we have so many.

1021
01:13:03,259 --> 01:13:06,641
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, usually there's a couple big games in the spring, but we have a lot.

1022
01:13:07,121 --> 01:13:11,123
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, March 16th is just a week after Final Fantasy XIII, isn't it?

1023
01:13:13,024 --> 01:13:13,284
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1024
01:13:13,444 --> 01:13:16,466
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a huge PS3 and 360, to be fair, title as well.

1025
01:13:16,486 --> 01:13:17,126
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, this is huge.

1026
01:13:17,747 --> 01:13:20,248
[SPEAKER_14]: There's also an Ultimate Edition, by the way, of God of War 3 coming out.

1027
01:13:21,188 --> 01:13:24,611
[SPEAKER_14]: There's going to be a replica Pandora's box that will have the game in it.

1028
01:13:25,292 --> 01:13:28,215
[SPEAKER_14]: There's also going to be some DLC included as well as some other collectibles.

1029
01:13:28,835 --> 01:13:31,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, God of War 3 is a PS3 exclusive.

1030
01:13:31,938 --> 01:13:34,140
[SPEAKER_14]: Heavy Rain is a controversial-ish game.

1031
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you hear about some of the nudity in Heavy Rain, apparently?

1032
01:13:36,342 --> 01:13:39,565
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen some of the nudity in Heavy Rain there.

1033
01:13:39,865 --> 01:13:40,266
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all right.

1034
01:13:40,286 --> 01:13:41,407
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's just, you know...

1035
01:13:41,852 --> 01:13:43,233
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just trying to be a little bit movie-ish.

1036
01:13:43,273 --> 01:13:47,815
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, if you want to see it for yourself, I don't know if you get to see nudity in the demo, but maybe you can find out what this game is all about.

1037
01:13:48,315 --> 01:13:49,796
[SPEAKER_14]: That'll be on February 11th.

1038
01:13:49,976 --> 01:13:53,998
[SPEAKER_14]: There will be a demo available on the PlayStation Network, both in Europe and North America.

1039
01:13:54,038 --> 01:13:56,939
[SPEAKER_14]: That's February 11th, not too far from now.

1040
01:13:57,579 --> 01:14:04,783
[SPEAKER_14]: Two chapters in the demo, one where you are the FBI agent Norman Jaden, and then the other one, I guess...

1041
01:14:07,802 --> 01:14:26,510
[SPEAKER_14]: Some type of private investigator Also, Lost Planet 2 has a release date And some Gears of War characters apparently are going to be making a cameo in the game as well That's kind of interesting Marcus and Dom from Gears of War I'm guessing they'll be only in the 360 Call it a hunch, yeah, you're probably right

1042
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:28,892
[SPEAKER_14]: There's some new trailers, by the way, on Xbox Live.

1043
01:14:28,912 --> 01:14:36,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe they'll have like Nathan Drake or something like that from Uncharted or something in the PS3 one.

1044
01:14:36,062 --> 01:14:36,723
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be kind of neat.

1045
01:14:37,384 --> 01:14:39,146
[SPEAKER_11]: God of War or Kratos.

1046
01:14:39,847 --> 01:14:40,768
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be kind of weird.

1047
01:14:42,410 --> 01:15:00,349
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, apparently for the live folks, our stream dropped while we were doing some of the reporting right there, I don't know why that happened, but apparently it fixed itself, I didn't have to do anything, weird, I was just reading right on through the news, apparently our stream dropped somewhere in there

1048
01:15:01,986 --> 01:15:04,368
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, just another wonderful night here at OLR.

1049
01:15:04,448 --> 01:15:05,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, good times.

1050
01:15:05,709 --> 01:15:09,011
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully just a hiccup in the cable, not anything about our new software, I hope.

1051
01:15:10,052 --> 01:15:11,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyhow, let's hope we get through the rest of the show.

1052
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:12,914
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

1053
01:15:13,555 --> 01:15:14,416
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll make it through the show.

1054
01:15:15,436 --> 01:15:26,645
[SPEAKER_06]: So, for more Star Trek Online news, since we did go into it just a little bit in the last part, they're actually doing a patch for launch day.

1055
01:15:27,025 --> 01:15:28,787
[SPEAKER_06]: I patched it when we were starting the show.

1056
01:15:29,087 --> 01:15:30,388
[SPEAKER_06]: So, for the...

1057
01:15:32,162 --> 01:15:33,062
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, no wonder we're dropping.

1058
01:15:33,223 --> 01:15:35,124
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm kidding.

1059
01:15:35,224 --> 01:15:36,084
[SPEAKER_06]: I did it before we went live.

1060
01:15:37,765 --> 01:15:41,847
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're already working on the first big update for the game.

1061
01:15:42,607 --> 01:15:54,173
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not really saying exactly what, but there's going to be more PvP, exploration missions for the Klingons, and more ground-based fleet stuff, as in huge-ass quests.

1062
01:15:54,693 --> 01:15:55,594
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be raids.

1063
01:15:57,529 --> 01:16:03,602
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, also Rob, they're thinking about having Q and time travel.

1064
01:16:03,743 --> 01:16:04,444
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that's kind of cool.

1065
01:16:05,005 --> 01:16:05,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1066
01:16:05,887 --> 01:16:06,970
[SPEAKER_14]: How about Seven of Nine?

1067
01:16:08,456 --> 01:16:09,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1068
01:16:34,565 --> 01:16:40,208
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also Federation vs. Federation PvP, which will be kind of interesting, I guess.

1069
01:16:41,348 --> 01:16:43,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I want the Mirrorverse stuff to come in.

1070
01:16:43,629 --> 01:16:48,411
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, down the line we're supposed to be getting Cardassian and Romulan factions as well.

1071
01:16:50,432 --> 01:16:54,974
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess you have for the Federation, then you have Kapla!

1072
01:16:55,635 --> 01:16:57,155
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, for the Klingons, sorry.

1073
01:16:58,316 --> 01:16:58,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

1074
01:16:59,526 --> 01:17:01,748
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, Darwinia is our next news.

1075
01:17:02,508 --> 01:17:07,112
[SPEAKER_06]: And it should be coming out on Xbox Live on February 10th.

1076
01:17:08,132 --> 01:17:19,080
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's supposed to be free on February 10th, from what I understand.

1077
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:28,067
[SPEAKER_06]: And then $15, I think you have to pay for the minimum sales, I think, later on, if I'm reading this correctly.

1078
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:38,829
[SPEAKER_06]: and then another good thing is After Burner Climax will be coming to the US and actually into Europe for the spring.

1079
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:49,412
[SPEAKER_06]: It says it's going to be on Xbox Live, Arcade and PlayStation Network and it's basically going to be the full arcade port.

1080
01:17:49,432 --> 01:17:50,452
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty cool.

1081
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:52,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Now where's my Planet Harrier?

1082
01:17:56,114 --> 01:17:57,474
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll have to wait for that I guess.

1083
01:17:59,847 --> 01:18:03,209
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's get into some Twitter topics, although my mouth is full here.

1084
01:18:03,289 --> 01:18:05,571
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I'm going to have Loki answer the first one here.

1085
01:18:06,451 --> 01:18:07,752
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, actually, here's a question.

1086
01:18:08,072 --> 01:18:10,934
[SPEAKER_14]: From Blue Swim, and no theme music tonight, guys.

1087
01:18:10,954 --> 01:18:11,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I didn't queue it up.

1088
01:18:12,275 --> 01:18:14,697
[SPEAKER_14]: Blue Swim says, have any of you played Mercenaries 2?

1089
01:18:15,537 --> 01:18:18,079
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of like Grand Theft Auto meets Earth Defense Force 2017.

1090
01:18:18,579 --> 01:18:19,260
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a ton of fun.

1091
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:22,582
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a very glitchy-ass game.

1092
01:18:22,682 --> 01:18:27,705
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I've played lots of Mercenaries 2, and yeah, it's horrible.

1093
01:18:27,845 --> 01:18:29,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Horribly Glitchy

1094
01:18:52,174 --> 01:18:56,778
[SPEAKER_14]: TigerClaw305 on the Twitter sends us a story about a woman who loses 112 pounds.

1095
01:18:56,838 --> 01:18:58,479
[SPEAKER_14]: Links us to a story here on Kotaku.

1096
01:18:58,919 --> 01:19:04,884
[SPEAKER_14]: A 38-year-old British woman, apparently so big she didn't want to have sex with her husband.

1097
01:19:06,806 --> 01:19:14,011
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's sad, but unfortunately some of those images they put out on TV about what the perfect woman looks like, quote-unquote.

1098
01:19:14,031 --> 01:19:18,375
[SPEAKER_14]: It causes this to happen to some people where she wasn't even wanting to...

1099
01:19:20,776 --> 01:19:23,118
[SPEAKER_14]: It didn't even feel comfortable enough to show her husband, you know what I mean?

1100
01:19:23,538 --> 01:19:27,800
[SPEAKER_14]: So anyway, apparently she lost 112 pounds, all thanks to WeFit.

1101
01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:34,183
[SPEAKER_14]: Her name is Laura Roberts, and she came out and said she went from 252 pounds down to 140 in a year.

1102
01:19:35,284 --> 01:19:38,946
[SPEAKER_14]: And by the way, though, they do say there was a dietary part of this as well.

1103
01:19:39,246 --> 01:19:42,508
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that's always important to know when we talk about these games that help you lose weight and everything.

1104
01:19:42,848 --> 01:19:46,110
[SPEAKER_14]: You're not going to magically lose weight just by playing one of these games five minutes a day.

1105
01:19:46,750 --> 01:20:07,360
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to make a, I believe Jamie's used this term before on the show and I like it, a lifestyle adjustment Yes Because you have to make better choices in eating as well And you have to, you know, do the game on a somewhat regular basis for a somewhat extended period of time for this to work It just has to, it's a lot of changes, you know, I'm even wanting to get our DDR night started back again

1106
01:20:08,428 --> 01:20:22,576
[SPEAKER_14]: uh the tab the news of the world apparently said she ditched the comfort eating and that added up to 4,000 calories a day well of course she lost weight yeah well and Wii Fit just helped her probably tone it as she was losing it so it didn't all kind of come out of one place you know

1107
01:20:23,086 --> 01:20:24,167
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1108
01:20:46,326 --> 01:20:47,747
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so she had the right idea.

1109
01:20:47,787 --> 01:20:50,830
[SPEAKER_06]: You cut out the comfort eating, you realize, you know, what it is that you're doing it for.

1110
01:20:51,410 --> 01:20:54,192
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, you can enjoy your food, that's the point.

1111
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:56,254
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, it is fuel first and foremost.

1112
01:20:57,054 --> 01:20:57,295
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1113
01:20:58,055 --> 01:21:00,277
[SPEAKER_14]: Ray Ayanami on the Twitter sends us a tweet.

1114
01:21:00,557 --> 01:21:03,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Death Smiles will get a US localization by Axis Games.

1115
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:05,901
[SPEAKER_14]: They're the ones that make BlazBlue.

1116
01:21:05,961 --> 01:21:09,704
[SPEAKER_14]: And yes, I remember that on the list for last week, the show that didn't happen.

1117
01:21:10,305 --> 01:21:13,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I say... I always say BlazBlue because there's no extra E. Well...

1118
01:21:14,548 --> 01:21:15,088
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1119
01:21:39,326 --> 01:22:07,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Save and play back your own replays And there's online rankings and online co-ops So this looks to be a pretty robust little shmup And it's not something on Xbox Live It's a full disc release So it looks to be pretty intense And I know Ray is a big fan of the shmups So he's probably got his eye on this one And lastly, from SSJ100Matt on Twitter Saying, although his Twitter name is Matt Osterowski And I always mispronounce his last name, sorry Courtney Love now says that Kurt Cobain would have liked Guitar Hero 5 Bitch be trippin'

1120
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:10,781
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1121
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:31,641
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1122
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:08,264
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you go way back to when we first covered these stories, they didn't read the contract, they were signed in, and they probably had that whole thing misrepresented.

1123
01:23:08,304 --> 01:23:09,425
[SPEAKER_14]: There was fault on both sides.

1124
01:23:10,225 --> 01:23:13,105
[SPEAKER_14]: One side didn't read it, the other side didn't represent it accurately.

1125
01:23:13,706 --> 01:23:14,586
[SPEAKER_14]: I bet you that's what it is.

1126
01:23:15,146 --> 01:23:17,206
[SPEAKER_14]: There's always three sides to every story.

1127
01:23:17,246 --> 01:23:19,087
[SPEAKER_14]: Your side, my side, and the truth.

1128
01:23:20,347 --> 01:23:21,928
[SPEAKER_14]: So, anyhow.

1129
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:25,769
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's get back into some other gaming news.

1130
01:23:26,169 --> 01:23:27,189
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, what you got for us?

1131
01:23:28,021 --> 01:23:32,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I got some more information regarding the Microsoft Game Room.

1132
01:23:34,304 --> 01:23:40,468
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not really a big surprise to me, but apparently your classic Xbox Live Arcade games won't work with the Game Room.

1133
01:23:40,948 --> 01:23:53,935
[SPEAKER_11]: So, for example, if you bought Frogger, or even some of the Konami games that they had on there, like Time Pilot and whatnot, you will not be able to play those games in Game Room.

1134
01:23:53,955 --> 01:23:55,976
[SPEAKER_11]: You will have to purchase them again.

1135
01:23:56,876 --> 01:24:04,184
[SPEAKER_11]: and, um, mainly they're saying that some of those, you know, were revamped versions on, um, you know, Xbox Live.

1136
01:24:04,484 --> 01:24:08,569
[SPEAKER_11]: And honestly, I think some of them weren't, but, you know, they're just...

1137
01:24:10,185 --> 01:24:11,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably they have licensing.

1138
01:24:12,366 --> 01:24:18,411
[SPEAKER_14]: The revamps, like especially when you look at some of those Konami games like Frogger and stuff, new graphics.

1139
01:24:18,911 --> 01:24:19,271
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

1140
01:24:19,891 --> 01:24:23,334
[SPEAKER_14]: Like some redone sprites that are more colors and stuff.

1141
01:24:23,354 --> 01:24:23,974
[SPEAKER_14]: That's really it.

1142
01:24:24,815 --> 01:24:28,938
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a little shady, but we kind of knew it was coming.

1143
01:24:29,278 --> 01:24:29,798
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I mean?

1144
01:24:30,058 --> 01:24:34,541
[SPEAKER_14]: We kind of knew it was coming, that there was not going to be, or that you were going to get screwed.

1145
01:24:34,561 --> 01:24:35,982
[SPEAKER_14]: You'd have to buy all these things over again.

1146
01:24:36,062 --> 01:24:37,003
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, this isn't a surprise.

1147
01:24:37,483 --> 01:24:40,025
[SPEAKER_14]: It's disappointing, but whatever.

1148
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:52,201
[SPEAKER_14]: You know they're going to come out and say, you know, A, because of the redone stuff and the separate achievements and the leaderboards that are unique to the games and the fact that in Game Room you can play them on the PC if you pay a certain amount and da-da-da-da-da.

1149
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:58,544
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure they have reasons up the yin-yang, but just in the end, you know, you do feel a little bit disappointed.

1150
01:24:58,564 --> 01:25:03,788
[SPEAKER_14]: But at the same time, did Nintendo let you download something on Virtual Console for free just because you own the cart?

1151
01:25:04,869 --> 01:25:05,109
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1152
01:25:06,290 --> 01:25:07,751
[SPEAKER_14]: So, no surprise.

1153
01:25:07,851 --> 01:25:11,634
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but I mean, this is like the same, you know, online service.

1154
01:25:11,714 --> 01:25:12,115
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just...

1155
01:25:12,535 --> 01:25:28,450
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't... I've bought a lot of those earlier, because I do love classic games, and I bought a lot of... I bought, like, Russian Attack, I bought all these games I barely even were familiar with, and I'll... If I want them in Game Room, I'll probably have to buy them again, but I'm just not going to on principle.

1156
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:30,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and I'm not going to... That's where I stand.

1157
01:25:30,452 --> 01:25:32,314
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll buy some of the... Like, the Atari... Well...

1158
01:25:32,874 --> 01:25:53,532
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even know because some of those Atari games I have too but depending on what game room will give me with these classic games you know if there are things like robust leaderboards and medals and things I might consider buying some of those really really good Activision games that I would play over and over again like the original Pitfall I still love that game and would play that a lot I would

1159
01:25:55,509 --> 01:25:56,529
[SPEAKER_14]: They need to fix the D-pad.

1160
01:25:57,530 --> 01:26:03,732
[SPEAKER_14]: That's really what the... That's why I plan on buying everything on the computer too because it's the whole laptop and with me on the go and everything.

1161
01:26:05,713 --> 01:26:07,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Fix the D-pad, Microsoft.

1162
01:26:07,334 --> 01:26:07,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on.

1163
01:26:07,814 --> 01:26:08,394
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be nice.

1164
01:26:08,755 --> 01:26:10,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Make a revision to your controller.

1165
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:11,536
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe an E3 surprise.

1166
01:26:11,556 --> 01:26:11,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows?

1167
01:26:12,165 --> 01:26:16,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Sky, what if they were to do some sort of bundle, a discount for the XBL and Game Room at the same time?

1168
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:29,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

1169
01:26:48,331 --> 01:26:50,454
[SPEAKER_14]: But I will refuse on principle.

1170
01:26:50,514 --> 01:26:52,216
[SPEAKER_14]: I am not rebuying Frogger.

1171
01:26:52,236 --> 01:26:53,457
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not rebuying Joust.

1172
01:26:53,497 --> 01:26:58,083
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not rebuying anything that I already have on Xbox Live Arcade, which is quite a bit.

1173
01:26:58,483 --> 01:27:02,048
[SPEAKER_14]: So Konami probably won't be buying much of your stuff unless you really dig deep.

1174
01:27:02,308 --> 01:27:07,835
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to have to put out like Time Pilot 83 and some of these things that you missed the first time.

1175
01:27:08,539 --> 01:27:25,048
[SPEAKER_11]: and the other thing too about Game Room that they announced too is that it's not going to be including any T or M rated content it's going to be E10 plus only so one of the games that they're talking about no Death Race 2000 unfortunately

1176
01:27:26,722 --> 01:27:27,282
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

1177
01:27:44,247 --> 01:27:46,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Game Room is for really old games.

1178
01:28:03,704 --> 01:28:04,084
[SPEAKER_14]: S, DarkSakura,

1179
01:28:33,143 --> 01:28:38,586
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the games you're going to be seeing in Game Room are like 25 years or more old.

1180
01:28:39,486 --> 01:28:42,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Like before the great video game crash of 84.

1181
01:28:44,348 --> 01:28:44,928
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see though.

1182
01:28:47,708 --> 01:28:48,368
[SPEAKER_14]: I could be wrong.

1183
01:28:48,408 --> 01:28:48,809
[SPEAKER_14]: And who knows?

1184
01:28:49,329 --> 01:28:56,391
[SPEAKER_14]: Game Room's supposedly going to deliver a thousand games, although I think there's going to be certain fudging of that number.

1185
01:28:56,531 --> 01:29:03,913
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they'll give us a thousand games, but that means Crystal Castle's on the Atari, Crystal Castle's in the arcade, Crystal Castle's on television, Crystal Castle...

1186
01:29:08,619 --> 01:29:27,252
[SPEAKER_14]: GameGuru says games before the NES kinda sucked um no there were a lot of great games back in the day it's just by today's standards the short attention span that today's gamers have I don't think would appreciate a lot of those old games from the past like a very very simple game like Kaboom roll the paddle back and forth collect bombs that fall

1187
01:29:28,012 --> 01:29:29,233
[SPEAKER_14]: Disgustingly Simple Game

1188
01:29:53,680 --> 01:30:04,689
[SPEAKER_14]: Freeway Drag Race They were very one name things So it was just different Amiga777 asked Was Tempest really fun?

1189
01:30:05,009 --> 01:30:12,895
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it was a great shooter I think it's still really fun today Especially Tempest 2000 Tempest 2000 is the shit Anyway

1190
01:30:13,416 --> 01:30:14,457
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's move on.

1191
01:30:14,477 --> 01:30:15,917
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, some other gaming news.

1192
01:30:16,838 --> 01:30:18,879
[SPEAKER_14]: Trying not to focus on the past too much here.

1193
01:30:18,919 --> 01:30:19,219
[SPEAKER_14]: Whoops.

1194
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:21,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Monster Hunter Frontier.

1195
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:24,402
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a new game between Capcom and Microsoft.

1196
01:30:24,422 --> 01:30:25,823
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be coming out on the Xbox 360.

1197
01:30:27,163 --> 01:30:27,924
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's the deal.

1198
01:30:28,404 --> 01:30:31,145
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently it's a port of a PC MMO.

1199
01:30:31,225 --> 01:30:34,927
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right, it's an MMO coming to the 360, a Monster Hunter.

1200
01:30:35,588 --> 01:30:39,570
[SPEAKER_14]: There is a little trailer that was released and Capcom put out a few details this week.

1201
01:30:40,231 --> 01:30:56,131
[SPEAKER_14]: apparently the way the subscription plan will work you get what's called a Hunter Life course coupon for about 15 bucks and you get access to the game for 30 days and you get an Xbox Live Gold subscription with that for that month kind of interesting

1202
01:30:56,834 --> 01:30:58,435
[SPEAKER_14]: How much is Xbox Live a month anyway?

1203
01:30:58,455 --> 01:30:59,316
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like five bucks.

1204
01:30:59,796 --> 01:30:59,996
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it?

1205
01:31:00,476 --> 01:31:00,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1206
01:31:00,777 --> 01:31:01,557
[SPEAKER_14]: So interesting.

1207
01:31:01,597 --> 01:31:08,601
[SPEAKER_14]: I wonder if you could buy, like for those of us that bought Xbox Live for a year, what happens if you just want to buy like a few months of this game?

1208
01:31:08,801 --> 01:31:13,644
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll just keep adding it to your year because you can store up to like five years worth of live.

1209
01:31:13,784 --> 01:31:14,985
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's a little ridiculous.

1210
01:31:15,045 --> 01:31:22,289
[SPEAKER_11]: And also just a forewarning, it's really hard to cancel once you've put your credit card in there to pay.

1211
01:31:22,449 --> 01:31:24,030
[SPEAKER_11]: It auto-renews, by the way.

1212
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:24,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it does.

1213
01:31:25,419 --> 01:31:33,703
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a pain in the ass, and you have to call them up, and then they give you... Because I was paying for some of our other coworkers, you know, just to have their accounts going.

1214
01:31:34,464 --> 01:31:40,307
[SPEAKER_11]: And now that they've left, it's kind of hard to get rid of the account, especially when I'm paying for it.

1215
01:31:42,845 --> 01:31:45,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, reading some comments from chat.

1216
01:31:45,187 --> 01:31:48,651
[SPEAKER_14]: There's still some comments from the last story going on here about Game Room.

1217
01:31:48,671 --> 01:31:49,932
[SPEAKER_14]: VidPower says, That's awesome.

1218
01:31:49,952 --> 01:31:52,654
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh man, that would be so much fun to just whip out the Atari 2600 and play that for a few hours.

1219
01:31:52,674 --> 01:31:52,995
[SPEAKER_14]: GameGuru says,

1220
01:32:06,127 --> 01:32:23,797
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there's still some good ones out there Salacious Pop in chat says when the 2600 came out people were OMGing that they could alter what happened on their TV screen they moved the paddle and the dot moved very true, why do you think those pong they had machines that were only pong it was pong for your TV and that was it

1221
01:32:24,457 --> 01:32:27,879
[SPEAKER_14]: That was like before the Odyssey, which was before the 2600.

1222
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:35,224
[SPEAKER_14]: And those things still sold because, exactly right, people were oohing and aahing because they controlled what was on the screen.

1223
01:32:35,545 --> 01:32:36,545
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was really a first.

1224
01:32:37,186 --> 01:32:37,686
[SPEAKER_14]: Think about it.

1225
01:32:38,367 --> 01:32:43,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Television before that, you don't control what's on the screen besides changing the channel, which doesn't really count.

1226
01:32:44,891 --> 01:32:46,492
[SPEAKER_14]: So, anyhow.

1227
01:32:47,473 --> 01:32:50,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry for the tangent there, but those were some good comments around the room from chat.

1228
01:32:50,774 --> 01:32:52,856
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the show if there's no tangent?

1229
01:32:52,876 --> 01:32:54,197
[SPEAKER_14]: What is the show without a tangent?

1230
01:32:54,397 --> 01:32:55,198
[SPEAKER_06]: How about Doctor Who?

1231
01:32:56,339 --> 01:32:57,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Speaking of tangents...

1232
01:32:58,745 --> 01:33:05,389
[SPEAKER_06]: BBC is pretty interested in doing video games after the Doctor Who relaunch.

1233
01:33:05,569 --> 01:33:11,914
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to do ones that are complementary to each other instead of competition.

1234
01:33:12,694 --> 01:33:14,816
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess it's going to be episodic.

1235
01:33:15,877 --> 01:33:17,238
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how I would translate that.

1236
01:33:17,938 --> 01:33:22,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Or have things that go from one to the other like transferable content.

1237
01:33:23,762 --> 01:33:32,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but they're saying that their ideas involve, quote, boxed product console games, virtual worlds, and other experiences.

1238
01:33:33,215 --> 01:33:35,477
[SPEAKER_06]: So who knows, maybe we'll get a Doctor Who MMO.

1239
01:33:36,058 --> 01:33:37,240
[SPEAKER_06]: But all the Time Lords are dead!

1240
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:44,226
[SPEAKER_14]: Random question out of the blue, wasn't there like a Doctor Who game on the DS that was kind of eh?

1241
01:33:44,246 --> 01:33:44,946
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Top Chumps.

1242
01:33:45,908 --> 01:33:54,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Top Chumps is like playing war with cards, only you pick a stat, and then the other person picks a stat, and whichever stat wins, you take that card.

1243
01:33:56,700 --> 01:33:58,362
[SPEAKER_06]: So you play kind of for ante, but not...

1244
01:33:59,582 --> 01:34:00,042
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting.

1245
01:34:00,143 --> 01:34:01,984
[SPEAKER_14]: So it wasn't a very robust kind of game.

1246
01:34:02,044 --> 01:34:04,446
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a fun way to pass time.

1247
01:34:04,546 --> 01:34:09,790
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm hearing this story and I'm thinking, well, there was a Doctor Who game, but it sounds like it wasn't very Doctor Who-y.

1248
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:12,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, our buddy Rob overseas sent me my copy.

1249
01:34:12,152 --> 01:34:12,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what I thought.

1250
01:34:12,812 --> 01:34:16,115
[SPEAKER_14]: I seem to remember you got a copy of it from an overseas listener and were playing it.

1251
01:34:16,835 --> 01:34:17,836
[SPEAKER_06]: No, don't get me wrong.

1252
01:34:18,096 --> 01:34:18,577
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked it.

1253
01:34:18,697 --> 01:34:19,457
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty fun.

1254
01:34:19,978 --> 01:34:22,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though it had Martha all over it and I don't like Martha.

1255
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:25,202
[SPEAKER_06]: But Season 3 Doctor Who just was really weak to me.

1256
01:34:25,982 --> 01:34:26,163
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

1257
01:34:27,363 --> 01:34:28,164
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a fun game.

1258
01:34:28,584 --> 01:34:30,745
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't super engaging is what I'm saying.

1259
01:34:30,785 --> 01:34:38,109
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not depth of story or anything that adds to the Hooniverse.

1260
01:34:39,769 --> 01:34:42,051
[SPEAKER_14]: Decipher in chat says, An MMO would suck.

1261
01:34:42,111 --> 01:34:43,231
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyone's a Time Lord.

1262
01:34:43,351 --> 01:34:44,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Time traveling would be hectic.

1263
01:34:45,132 --> 01:34:48,774
[SPEAKER_14]: And SSJ100Matt wins the chat by saying, President Cat is a Time Lord.

1264
01:34:49,474 --> 01:34:50,775
[SPEAKER_06]: President Cat is a Time Lord.

1265
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:55,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, that would be the sequel to President Cat.

1266
01:34:55,295 --> 01:34:56,836
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be the sequel to President Cat.

1267
01:34:56,876 --> 01:34:57,617
[SPEAKER_14]: Time Lord Cat.

1268
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:00,861
[SPEAKER_14]: Or Lord Cat.

1269
01:35:01,081 --> 01:35:03,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Instead of President Cat, Queen Cat or something.

1270
01:35:03,584 --> 01:35:04,385
[SPEAKER_14]: I forget it.

1271
01:35:04,867 --> 01:35:21,333
[SPEAKER_06]: and for the record to tell our dear friend Brad from PodCulture in the chat room Martha was so she didn't get good until she was off of the show I'll put it that way as a character she didn't get good until she was off of the show

1272
01:35:22,433 --> 01:35:28,236
[SPEAKER_06]: She was this silly little girl with a crush and yeah, she's smart.

1273
01:35:28,276 --> 01:35:31,158
[SPEAKER_06]: She really couldn't think her way out of the paper bag when it came to common sense.

1274
01:35:31,238 --> 01:35:31,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1275
01:35:32,339 --> 01:35:34,260
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's all about Donna.

1276
01:35:35,620 --> 01:35:39,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Loud, obnoxious, and smarter than she thinks.

1277
01:35:40,743 --> 01:35:45,386
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not going to go into the whole Rose Doctor fandom.

1278
01:35:46,611 --> 01:35:47,933
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1279
01:36:06,209 --> 01:36:09,572
[SPEAKER_06]: She took on a little bit too many of the... Not to say that she was a bad character.

1280
01:36:09,632 --> 01:36:09,992
[SPEAKER_06]: I loved her.

1281
01:36:10,012 --> 01:36:11,013
[SPEAKER_06]: She was very well fleshed out.

1282
01:36:11,554 --> 01:36:13,775
[SPEAKER_06]: She and the Doctor were believable together.

1283
01:36:15,017 --> 01:36:18,920
[SPEAKER_06]: But there were certain elements that just seemed like, okay, we're doing this for the fans.

1284
01:36:20,001 --> 01:36:28,308
[SPEAKER_06]: But even so, Rose was still amazing, but I still think that Donna... Well, my favorite of all the companions is Sarah Jane, to this day.

1285
01:36:29,228 --> 01:36:34,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Even back to her old episodes, including the badly written Ark in Space with the bubble wrap larva creatures.

1286
01:36:35,093 --> 01:36:37,635
[SPEAKER_06]: They made the creatures out of green bubble wrap.

1287
01:36:38,596 --> 01:36:39,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Low budget.

1288
01:36:40,697 --> 01:36:41,258
[SPEAKER_14]: Doctor Who?

1289
01:36:43,859 --> 01:36:45,621
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's what little I've seen of it I've liked.

1290
01:36:45,661 --> 01:36:48,463
[SPEAKER_14]: I just haven't committed the time to sit down and watch more episodes.

1291
01:36:48,583 --> 01:36:51,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Donna is fantastic, amazing, especially as Dr. Donna.

1292
01:36:52,766 --> 01:36:54,467
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, back to video games, Loki.

1293
01:36:55,416 --> 01:37:13,534
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you may remember we talked about this a few weeks ago, that Datel was pissed off at Microsoft for locking out their third-party memory cards, which kind of sucks, because Microsoft memory cards are only like half a meg, or not even half a meg, half a gig, and they're like $49.99.

1294
01:37:13,634 --> 01:37:18,679
[SPEAKER_11]: For that price, you might as well just buy a hard drive, because it's going to cost you about $50 more, but you get...

1295
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:22,261
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, like 40 times the space.

1296
01:37:23,102 --> 01:37:31,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, so now Microsoft has registered a motion to dismiss the antitrust lawsuit, which was filed by Datel.

1297
01:37:32,267 --> 01:37:39,571
[SPEAKER_11]: And basically they're citing that other rivals, like Apple, for example...

1298
01:37:40,772 --> 01:37:44,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a lockout on different things for their systems.

1299
01:37:44,097 --> 01:37:47,661
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, you can't run OSX on computers not made by Apple.

1300
01:37:48,883 --> 01:37:54,090
[SPEAKER_11]: So why should you be able to use non-Microsoft memory cards on your Xbox?

1301
01:37:54,230 --> 01:37:56,133
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's a little different, but whatever.

1302
01:37:58,035 --> 01:38:10,670
[SPEAKER_11]: They're also claiming, though, that they don't want to undermine the quality of the user experience on Xbox Live by allowing Datel to release cheat-enabling memory cards.

1303
01:38:12,321 --> 01:38:16,484
[SPEAKER_11]: But from what I remember, I don't think the memory cards that they had were cheat enabling.

1304
01:38:16,684 --> 01:38:20,566
[SPEAKER_11]: It was basically just allowing you to run more space or, you know, have more space on there.

1305
01:38:20,586 --> 01:38:25,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Like instead of having a half a gig memory card, you have an eight gig memory card, which is way cheaper.

1306
01:38:26,931 --> 01:38:29,953
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know if it's really the same thing.

1307
01:38:29,993 --> 01:38:35,036
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, I can understand where Datel, you know, they do release a lot of their cheat devices and stuff for different consoles.

1308
01:38:37,608 --> 01:38:38,209
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it's fair.

1309
01:38:38,789 --> 01:38:41,972
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an interesting comparison, but what do you think is ultimately going to happen?

1310
01:38:41,992 --> 01:38:46,936
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think Microsoft's got a point, or do you think Datel's going to win?

1311
01:38:47,657 --> 01:38:48,838
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think Datel's going to win.

1312
01:38:52,181 --> 01:38:56,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I think it's their system, but then again, they may...

1313
01:39:01,073 --> 01:39:09,937
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that they should allow them to maybe manufacture third-party hard drives or something like that because as far as their storage goes, they're really limited on what they allow other vendors to do.

1314
01:39:09,997 --> 01:39:14,699
[SPEAKER_11]: It's basically just either wired controllers or...

1315
01:39:16,761 --> 01:39:17,261
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1316
01:39:33,214 --> 01:39:34,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1317
01:39:56,582 --> 01:40:11,992
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know alright I'm surprised Datel didn't find a way to kind of hack those things but I guess it's not possible with hardware they tried I think but yeah it's kind of hard to do that with a memory card but can you imagine though if you could make a memory card the size of one of those hard drives that'd be awesome

1318
01:40:13,092 --> 01:40:17,754
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's move on to some other news involving Microsoft, and it is the indie games.

1319
01:40:18,574 --> 01:40:31,039
[SPEAKER_14]: Indie games, some of the sales figures for 2009 were released, and the best-selling game, Xbox Live Indie Game, was I Made a Game with Zombies in It, with all the leet-speak in the title, was the best-selling indie game last year.

1320
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:33,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, it sold 160,000 units at $1 each.

1321
01:40:38,228 --> 01:40:39,929
[SPEAKER_14]: Rumble Massage was the sixth best-selling game.

1322
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:11,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Avatar Drop sold $117,000 with $433,000 doing a trial.

1323
01:41:11,161 --> 01:41:12,222
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 15, The Impossible Game moved 31,000 copies.

1324
01:41:30,932 --> 01:41:32,433
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's at number 15.

1325
01:41:32,513 --> 01:41:34,093
[SPEAKER_14]: Aquarium HD was number 10.

1326
01:41:34,933 --> 01:41:36,794
[SPEAKER_14]: 24,000 copies, 172,000 trials.

1327
01:41:37,634 --> 01:41:38,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting.

1328
01:41:38,975 --> 01:41:42,776
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry guys, Snake 360 is nowhere to be found.

1329
01:41:43,216 --> 01:41:44,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Is Miner Dig Deep on there?

1330
01:41:46,377 --> 01:41:46,657
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1331
01:41:46,937 --> 01:41:48,038
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm surprised.

1332
01:41:48,058 --> 01:41:49,038
[SPEAKER_14]: Neither is Revenge of the Ball.

1333
01:41:49,078 --> 01:41:50,158
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh no, Miner Dig Deep is there.

1334
01:41:50,198 --> 01:41:50,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, number 5.

1335
01:41:51,079 --> 01:41:53,259
[SPEAKER_14]: It just doesn't have actual figures.

1336
01:41:53,460 --> 01:41:54,400
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a pretty good game.

1337
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,320
[SPEAKER_14]: It's addictive.

1338
01:41:57,261 --> 01:41:57,661
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

1339
01:42:00,074 --> 01:42:03,416
[SPEAKER_14]: If you haven't checked out any games, go download a handful.

1340
01:42:03,436 --> 01:42:04,436
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some good stuff.

1341
01:42:04,496 --> 01:42:06,137
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they really under-advertise it.

1342
01:42:06,197 --> 01:42:08,438
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there's a ton of stuff on there.

1343
01:42:08,638 --> 01:42:14,662
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's really hard to sort through it because of the new interface, which was supposed to be a good thing, and I don't like it.

1344
01:42:15,702 --> 01:42:17,183
[SPEAKER_14]: So, anyhow.

1345
01:42:18,664 --> 01:42:23,926
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this is the part of the show where we're going to get into some emails, although I don't know if we really have a lot of emails.

1346
01:42:23,946 --> 01:42:26,928
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I heard there was one left over from last week that never got read.

1347
01:42:27,288 --> 01:42:31,016
[SPEAKER_06]: I had, remember I had to delete all the spam and I think I got rid of some of them.

1348
01:42:31,196 --> 01:42:31,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoops.

1349
01:42:31,717 --> 01:42:36,627
[SPEAKER_06]: So if someone sent us email, just resend it to me and I'll redo it.

1350
01:42:37,128 --> 01:42:38,370
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so we don't have email this week?

1351
01:42:39,031 --> 01:42:39,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Yet.

1352
01:42:39,847 --> 01:42:40,087
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

1353
01:42:40,647 --> 01:42:44,369
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'll play the music and then end it because we have no emails.

1354
01:42:44,669 --> 01:42:47,971
[SPEAKER_14]: So send us your emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1355
01:42:48,031 --> 01:42:49,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, if you send them tonight, you're too late.

1356
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:51,613
[SPEAKER_14]: But do give us some emails for next week.

1357
01:42:51,653 --> 01:42:53,154
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be happy to take your questions.

1358
01:42:53,714 --> 01:42:59,837
[SPEAKER_14]: And hopefully after the oopsies and whoops of the past couple weeks, we can get back on track with some more listener interaction.

1359
01:43:00,637 --> 01:43:04,620
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe the lack of emails due to spammers necessitates an F you.

1360
01:43:05,141 --> 01:43:05,901
[SPEAKER_14]: F the spammers.

1361
01:43:06,461 --> 01:43:07,002
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate spammers.

1362
01:43:07,022 --> 01:43:08,183
[SPEAKER_14]: They hit our website too.

1363
01:43:08,523 --> 01:43:09,744
[SPEAKER_14]: But I've gotten creative.

1364
01:43:10,124 --> 01:43:16,408
[SPEAKER_14]: Like they keep spamming this thing on the forum about how to turn sub video on your iPod, all this crap.

1365
01:43:16,709 --> 01:43:21,692
[SPEAKER_14]: What I did is I put in a custom filter that turns the name of the program into this program fucking sucks.

1366
01:43:22,393 --> 01:43:26,896
[SPEAKER_14]: So every time they put a spam post, it just puts a link to this program fucking sucks.

1367
01:43:27,856 --> 01:43:31,099
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm going to continue to do that for all the programs that they spam on the board.

1368
01:43:31,119 --> 01:43:32,079
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's funny.

1369
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:37,883
[SPEAKER_14]: Even if it doesn't get them to stop, it's really funny that they're taking all this effort to announce to the world that their program fucking sucks.

1370
01:43:37,903 --> 01:43:40,265
[SPEAKER_14]: And they always use names like, I'm a stupid spammer.

1371
01:43:41,045 --> 01:43:41,986
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah, I did that too.

1372
01:43:42,646 --> 01:43:42,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

1373
01:43:43,407 --> 01:43:47,049
[SPEAKER_14]: I put in custom filters that say, punch me, I'm a stupid spammer.

1374
01:43:47,490 --> 01:43:50,271
[SPEAKER_14]: I know they were doing that.

1375
01:43:50,291 --> 01:43:51,672
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, why would you do that?

1376
01:43:51,692 --> 01:43:53,053
[SPEAKER_14]: That's stupid.

1377
01:43:53,113 --> 01:43:55,235
[SPEAKER_14]: See, but it's funny that people are thinking that.

1378
01:43:55,375 --> 01:43:56,375
[SPEAKER_14]: If you can't beat them,

1379
01:43:58,243 --> 01:43:58,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck with them.

1380
01:43:58,884 --> 01:44:02,567
[SPEAKER_11]: You should just change all the words that they use, like hot dog and stuff.

1381
01:44:02,587 --> 01:44:03,367
[SPEAKER_11]: Just make it weird.

1382
01:44:03,607 --> 01:44:11,794
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I can't change iPod because maybe people on the OLR forums want to have a legitimate discussion about iPod.

1383
01:44:12,515 --> 01:44:12,835
[SPEAKER_14]: Shut up.

1384
01:44:13,215 --> 01:44:22,162
[SPEAKER_14]: But this particular company, ain't no one give a shit about them, so I'm just going to change it to... I think the language is how to convert video.

1385
01:44:22,282 --> 01:44:27,787
[SPEAKER_14]: If you use those words just like that, it changes to punch me, I'm a fucking spammer or something like that.

1386
01:44:29,102 --> 01:44:29,523
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll do it.

1387
01:44:29,543 --> 01:44:31,104
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll do it.

1388
01:44:51,590 --> 01:44:52,831
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura when it starts off tonight.

1389
01:45:17,771 --> 01:45:21,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Um... I... Being busy.

1390
01:45:21,516 --> 01:45:22,497
[SPEAKER_06]: F you for being busy.

1391
01:45:23,479 --> 01:45:24,140
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about it.

1392
01:45:24,898 --> 01:45:25,679
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like...

1393
01:45:51,138 --> 01:45:56,980
[SPEAKER_11]: God damn it, just have a button where I click it and it... Okay, look, Windows Media File, done.

1394
01:45:57,340 --> 01:45:59,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Select the resolution, done.

1395
01:45:59,380 --> 01:46:06,902
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a program that converts different video files for use with my PlayStation 3.

1396
01:46:06,942 --> 01:46:06,982
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

1397
01:46:09,183 --> 01:46:18,451
[SPEAKER_11]: That one, they either have the uber, okay, adjust all the settings type stuff, or you can just do the stupid simple, I want it to look good.

1398
01:46:18,751 --> 01:46:20,792
[SPEAKER_11]: I want it to have good sound.

1399
01:46:20,812 --> 01:46:25,056
[SPEAKER_11]: You just select good, very good, excellent, that type of stuff.

1400
01:46:25,656 --> 01:46:27,558
[SPEAKER_11]: So why they can't do that is beyond me.

1401
01:46:27,678 --> 01:46:34,163
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to actually create my own custom settings and save that profile so that I actually have one that works.

1402
01:46:35,017 --> 01:46:35,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Really frustrated.

1403
01:46:36,278 --> 01:46:39,099
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know auditions the same way because it's hard.

1404
01:46:39,899 --> 01:46:40,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Photoshop.

1405
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:40,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Good.

1406
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:44,021
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you say Photoshop sucked earlier in the show?

1407
01:46:44,181 --> 01:46:45,342
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I said Photoshop's good.

1408
01:46:45,602 --> 01:46:48,103
[SPEAKER_11]: I said Photoshop on the iPhone probably sucked.

1409
01:46:48,123 --> 01:46:49,663
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, sorry.

1410
01:46:49,743 --> 01:47:00,848
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, my FU of the week goes to... Actually, you know, a lot of things are going very well for me, so I can't complain, but just FU to that chaos feeling and uncertainty.

1411
01:47:00,888 --> 01:47:03,950
[SPEAKER_14]: You know things are changing, but you don't know how they're changing.

1412
01:47:04,850 --> 01:47:29,669
[SPEAKER_14]: and just the whole process of moving I hate packing and having to throw away things I don't need and the fact that I'm having to downsize from a house to an apartment again sucks but I'll get through it, I always do alright, couple more stories for you guys and then the Skype line and hopefully very few audio problems tonight but we'll see what happens Loki, what you got for us?

1413
01:47:31,398 --> 01:47:57,930
[SPEAKER_11]: let's see what we've got it's funny the last story it's actually a new game coming to the Nintendo Wii it's from Mistwalker and apparently the other game that we talked about this earlier this is on that list of titles that were to be announced and what not Xenoblade was the other one that's actually a game coming from the company let's see here

1414
01:47:58,789 --> 01:48:08,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, it's actually the localized name for Monado Beginning of the World, which is an RPG from Monolith Soft.

1415
01:48:08,712 --> 01:48:13,353
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, of course, the last story is an RPG game being developed by Mistwalker.

1416
01:48:14,514 --> 01:48:18,775
[SPEAKER_11]: And they didn't really say what it is, but it's a new form of RPG, they're calling it.

1417
01:48:19,135 --> 01:48:20,696
[SPEAKER_11]: So, whatever the hell that's supposed to mean.

1418
01:48:21,736 --> 01:48:21,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

1419
01:48:24,056 --> 01:48:49,106
[SPEAKER_11]: and yeah and then the other thing of course Metroid Other M you know it's supposed to be coming out summer 2010 in Japan and what do all these have in common all of them have teaser sites now on Nintendo's Japanese website so you can go check those out as well so that's kind of neat so obviously they're coming relatively soon if they have their own teaser site all right there's been a lot of Nintendo news tonight

1420
01:48:50,250 --> 01:48:51,591
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all kind of tying in together.

1421
01:48:51,611 --> 01:48:52,531
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess so.

1422
01:48:52,851 --> 01:48:53,572
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1423
01:48:53,592 --> 01:48:57,694
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Nintendo's trying to put the cards together to really try to wow us again at E3 this year.

1424
01:48:57,754 --> 01:48:59,615
[SPEAKER_14]: But on their hardware, I don't know.

1425
01:49:00,055 --> 01:49:03,617
[SPEAKER_14]: But Mistwalker had some pretty good RPGs, at least Lost Odyssey.

1426
01:49:03,677 --> 01:49:04,778
[SPEAKER_14]: Blue Dragon was kind of...

1427
01:49:05,638 --> 01:49:06,319
[SPEAKER_14]: Ehh, for me.

1428
01:49:06,479 --> 01:49:10,843
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it wasn't great, but I know Jamie really enjoyed it, so I guess they got some people with it.

1429
01:49:11,904 --> 01:49:14,466
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyhow, I have one more story for you guys, and then we're going to open up the Skype line.

1430
01:49:14,486 --> 01:49:19,290
[SPEAKER_14]: This has to do with Steam and some of the growth that Steam had in the year 2009.

1431
01:49:19,350 --> 01:49:22,413
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, 25 million users now on Steam.

1432
01:49:22,713 --> 01:49:23,074
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a 205% jump.

1433
01:49:25,916 --> 01:49:32,543
[SPEAKER_14]: Over the year and year sales, and I wonder if this takes into account some of the Christmas sales, because they were having some obscene sales at the end of the year there.

1434
01:49:33,684 --> 01:49:36,707
[SPEAKER_14]: And Valve put out a press release earlier in the week just talking about how great their 2009 was.

1435
01:49:36,727 --> 01:49:38,729
[SPEAKER_14]: More than 25% new accounts, meaning they're up to $25 million.

1436
01:49:43,032 --> 01:50:11,148
[SPEAKER_14]: 10 million of those actually using profiles on Steam over a thousand games available on the service 100 different developers just crazy 5 years I guess the service is being used now they hit their peak in December 2.5 million concurrent users probably thanks to Modern Warfare 2 and Left 4 Dead 2 monthly average player minutes 13 billion so those saying the digital distribution didn't have a chance yeah

1437
01:50:12,625 --> 01:50:38,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Steam's proving a lot of those wrong and I think again it's a lot of those just obscene sales that they have on Steam that really kind of pushes that up to the top and the fact that Valve's you know pretty respectable name in gaming you know the Half-Life games of course and you know Portal and Team Fortress and all that and all this that good stuff that was in the orange box you know and the fact that that software came with those games which were big PC games so

1438
01:50:40,294 --> 01:50:41,695
[SPEAKER_14]: I would be curious, though.

1439
01:50:41,855 --> 01:50:55,543
[SPEAKER_14]: I know this isn't going to really involve digital distribution on a wide scale, but I'm curious how the new Blizzard net software is going to, I don't want to say necessarily compete with Steam, but kind of like put a chunk in that whole concurrent users and stuff.

1440
01:50:55,563 --> 01:51:01,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Because, you know, let's face it, I realize Steam might have 100 different developers, but Blizzard is like, they're like...

1441
01:51:02,006 --> 01:51:06,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Kings of PC development between WoW, Diablo, StarCraft.

1442
01:51:06,347 --> 01:51:12,969
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of hard to ignore the fact that Blizzard is a behemoth, and it's going to be interesting to see... They're a three-trick pony.

1443
01:51:13,369 --> 01:51:15,790
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, apparently they're working on a new IP that we don't know about yet.

1444
01:51:15,890 --> 01:51:16,610
[SPEAKER_14]: Four-trick pony.

1445
01:51:16,670 --> 01:51:18,610
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's going to be interesting to see what happens.

1446
01:51:18,850 --> 01:51:20,411
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, has Blizzard made a bad game?

1447
01:51:23,372 --> 01:51:23,692
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1448
01:51:23,872 --> 01:51:24,452
[SPEAKER_14]: Chirp, chirp.

1449
01:51:24,772 --> 01:51:27,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe the Viking game, but even that was kind of neat.

1450
01:51:27,933 --> 01:51:28,153
[SPEAKER_14]: So...

1451
01:51:29,927 --> 01:51:45,469
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, we'll see I think in the end they're not really competition because I don't see Blizzard really selling all these different types of games but BlizzardNet, they already digitally distribute their own games and that's not to be ignored that's a huge chunk of PC market right there

1452
01:51:47,552 --> 01:51:52,536
[SPEAKER_14]: Azam says, and digital distribution is tax-free as no physical material is exchanging hands to boot.

1453
01:51:52,596 --> 01:51:52,917
[SPEAKER_14]: Crazy.

1454
01:51:53,237 --> 01:51:58,903
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if you guys have done your taxes, though, but you know on the tax thing you're supposed to report anything you bought that was out of state?

1455
01:52:00,564 --> 01:52:01,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I don't think so.

1456
01:52:03,067 --> 01:52:04,248
[SPEAKER_14]: Prove they bought it out of state.

1457
01:52:04,908 --> 01:52:24,367
[SPEAKER_14]: I would you know I think if maybe I bought a car out of state or like major purchases I'd probably report those because you know that's the ethical thing to do and I don't want to get caught but like 20 bucks on a game I can't keep track of that throughout the year come on if you want to charge me taxes on it you need to do it at the point of sale like some other states do so all right

1458
01:52:24,912 --> 01:52:28,136
[SPEAKER_14]: And by the way, some folks in chat saying Lost Vikings is good.

1459
01:52:28,636 --> 01:52:30,579
[SPEAKER_14]: Rock and Roll Racing for the SNES was by Blizzard.

1460
01:52:30,599 --> 01:52:32,160
[SPEAKER_14]: That was from VidPower and GameGuru.

1461
01:52:32,661 --> 01:52:36,806
[SPEAKER_14]: And Rob D says, hey, if that was the only one that wasn't a good game, Blizzard's in good shape.

1462
01:52:37,026 --> 01:52:37,386
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree.

1463
01:52:37,987 --> 01:52:38,447
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

1464
01:52:39,989 --> 01:52:43,954
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, you guys ready to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1465
01:52:43,974 --> 01:52:45,476
[SPEAKER_14]: Use the name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio.

1466
01:52:46,296 --> 01:52:48,177
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I don't know how this is going to work tonight.

1467
01:52:48,317 --> 01:52:53,300
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm hoping the audio problems are okay and we don't have a lot of them.

1468
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:56,682
[SPEAKER_14]: Our phone call with Bobby went okay, so hopefully Skype goes okay too.

1469
01:52:56,742 --> 01:52:57,862
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a call on the line.

1470
01:52:57,922 --> 01:52:58,883
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1471
01:52:58,903 --> 01:52:59,243
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

1472
01:53:00,063 --> 01:53:01,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, this is Ray Ayanami.

1473
01:53:01,544 --> 01:53:01,924
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Ray.

1474
01:53:01,944 --> 01:53:02,445
[SPEAKER_14]: How are you doing?

1475
01:53:03,445 --> 01:53:03,965
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all right.

1476
01:53:04,566 --> 01:53:05,266
[SPEAKER_14]: What's on your mind tonight?

1477
01:53:05,866 --> 01:53:12,370
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been meaning to call about this for a few weeks now, but haven't been able to because I missed episodes.

1478
01:53:13,430 --> 01:53:14,311
[SPEAKER_14]: We had some drama.

1479
01:53:14,431 --> 01:53:14,691
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up?

1480
01:53:15,843 --> 01:53:22,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, DJMAX Technica Platinum Crew Service is finally online, like, internationally, not just in a few countries.

1481
01:53:22,709 --> 01:53:26,332
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right, because you can download it now on the PSN, right?

1482
01:53:27,373 --> 01:53:34,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no, I'm talking about the server, the online service for arcade DJMAX Technica machines.

1483
01:53:34,479 --> 01:53:36,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, oh, oh, okay, okay, gotcha, yeah.

1484
01:53:37,441 --> 01:53:44,587
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for those who haven't heard of it, it's kind of like Konami's EMU system, only it actually happened outside of Japan.

1485
01:53:45,709 --> 01:53:54,512
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you can do is go to the special mode where you can do these missions to unlock new charts and songs.

1486
01:53:55,092 --> 01:54:05,136
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also some special super hard charts you can try, as well as some courses you can do where you try to compete for the best score.

1487
01:54:05,196 --> 01:54:11,558
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you go online on your PC or your iPhone or whatever, you can check your scores and whatnot.

1488
01:54:13,922 --> 01:54:15,683
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this really taking off in arcades, though?

1489
01:54:15,783 --> 01:54:19,625
[SPEAKER_14]: Because, you know, it would seem like this is kind of an expensive thing for arcades to set up.

1490
01:54:19,725 --> 01:54:22,206
[SPEAKER_14]: Are they actually kind of welcoming of this?

1491
01:54:23,627 --> 01:54:26,408
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, I think so.

1492
01:54:28,129 --> 01:54:39,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, the first week I was there, like, there were pretty huge lines for the Technica machine, like, at Sunnyvale Golf Line, like, as many as 10 to 15 people, which isn't really a mine.

1493
01:54:39,055 --> 01:54:41,816
[SPEAKER_01]: I can understand, like, the excitement for it and such.

1494
01:54:44,446 --> 01:54:48,170
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of sad how arcades outside Japan are doing.

1495
01:54:48,210 --> 01:54:48,350
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean...

1496
01:55:07,469 --> 01:55:22,994
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe a number of factors on this, like for example, arcades not maintaining their machines or American arcade developers not taking the arcade scene seriously, like choosing to make novelty games rather than games that you can play for quite a while.

1497
01:55:23,754 --> 01:55:31,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Raw Thrills, for example, a lot of their games are the kind of games that you would play just for novelty a few times, not really take seriously.

1498
01:55:34,557 --> 01:55:43,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, speaking of this whole DJ Max thing, because I referenced this a minute ago, but now it's available on PlayStation Network to download right to your PSP.

1499
01:55:43,900 --> 01:55:44,340
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think?

1500
01:55:44,941 --> 01:55:59,866
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be DJ Max fever, and I've heard they fixed a few things, but I'm still not getting it because there's one annoying feature that they didn't take out that would have made me buy it, and that's the author-correct feature.

1501
01:56:00,826 --> 01:56:01,026
[SPEAKER_14]: Hmm.

1502
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:26,061
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm looking in chat, SSJ100Man on our chat says they had this whole system set up at 8 on the break That's that popular arcade in Jersey and it was an hour wait to play Yeah, that sounds like Swiggle too Wow, I should check and see if the Roseville Golf Land here got it I don't even know, I haven't been there in six months, kind of too bad Well, alright, Ray, is there anything else you want to ask us about tonight?

1503
01:56:27,305 --> 01:56:28,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Eh, not the moment.

1504
01:56:28,225 --> 01:56:28,546
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1505
01:56:28,566 --> 01:56:28,666
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1506
01:56:55,575 --> 01:56:58,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of which, I actually bought some stuff to upgrade my arcade cabinet at home.

1507
01:56:58,936 --> 01:57:05,599
[SPEAKER_11]: I bought a new GeForce graphics card because before I had what they call an arcade VGA card.

1508
01:57:05,639 --> 01:57:11,001
[SPEAKER_11]: It's basically a hacked ATI card that's pretty old with some different drivers and stuff.

1509
01:57:11,021 --> 01:57:20,624
[SPEAKER_11]: But you can do the same 15-kilogram drivers to output to the arcade monitor with a software program.

1510
01:57:20,644 --> 01:57:21,785
[SPEAKER_11]: You can run any card with that.

1511
01:57:22,345 --> 01:57:32,530
[SPEAKER_11]: So now I can run, you know, hopefully since BlazBlue's continuum shift leaked to the internet, I'm going to run that on my cabinet too.

1512
01:57:33,031 --> 01:57:34,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Clearly we have a caller on the line.

1513
01:57:34,611 --> 01:57:35,212
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, who's there?

1514
01:57:36,172 --> 01:57:37,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Legend of Zaku.

1515
01:57:37,313 --> 01:57:38,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Zaku.

1516
01:57:38,293 --> 01:57:38,894
[SPEAKER_14]: How are you doing?

1517
01:57:39,594 --> 01:57:42,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just want to say congratulations on the new year.

1518
01:57:42,536 --> 01:57:48,639
[SPEAKER_07]: I managed to make a good, almost like what, almost like eight years in running so far.

1519
01:57:49,443 --> 01:57:53,345
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we're now into, we've now spanned two decades, this show.

1520
01:57:53,845 --> 01:57:55,906
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we started, what was the first show, 2002?

1521
01:57:57,026 --> 01:57:58,687
[SPEAKER_14]: June 23rd of 02, right?

1522
01:57:59,087 --> 01:57:59,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, you're close.

1523
01:58:00,228 --> 01:58:01,848
[SPEAKER_07]: You're close to an eight year anniversary show.

1524
01:58:02,509 --> 01:58:03,009
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't remind me.

1525
01:58:04,210 --> 01:58:04,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what's on your mind?

1526
01:58:05,770 --> 01:58:06,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, nothing much.

1527
01:58:06,691 --> 01:58:08,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Just wanted to... Let me see.

1528
01:58:09,393 --> 01:58:12,475
[SPEAKER_07]: The truth of the matter is, you heard about the iPad, right?

1529
01:58:12,515 --> 01:58:15,317
[SPEAKER_07]: And how some of them are just like... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1530
01:58:15,717 --> 01:58:16,798
[SPEAKER_07]: What's an iPad?

1531
01:58:17,438 --> 01:58:17,938
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm kidding.

1532
01:58:17,998 --> 01:58:18,359
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

1533
01:58:19,519 --> 01:58:21,100
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, we heard about the iPad.

1534
01:58:22,261 --> 01:58:29,586
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the way I see it right now, I don't know why they had to make the iPod Touch or iPhone much bigger.

1535
01:58:30,126 --> 01:58:32,068
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it's because Apple's trying to...

1536
01:58:33,544 --> 01:58:33,864
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1537
01:58:33,885 --> 01:58:38,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them were just saying the other day that it might actually be a game for Sony.

1538
01:58:38,309 --> 01:58:40,251
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually picked this one up on Kotaku earlier today.

1539
01:58:55,475 --> 01:58:59,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Where the iPad itself would actually increase Do you type with your fists?

1540
01:59:00,379 --> 01:59:10,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, the clacking of the keys is so loud It's my Mac, alright Oh, okay, that explains it My MacBook, alright Nevermind, okay, that explains it Is it just me?

1541
01:59:10,666 --> 01:59:22,996
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like he's beating the keyboard with his fists But it's like typing Because these are the chiclet keys They look exactly like that, but Let me see Yeah, Sony's pleased as much with Apple's iPad

1542
01:59:24,011 --> 01:59:52,442
[SPEAKER_07]: something along that lines let's see you see Nintendo basically you know basically panning the iPad I don't know when you joined the show we covered that in part A towards the top of the show yeah we talked about Iwata basically saying what the rest of us were thinking that the iPad is basically several eye touches glued together well it's basically the point where Steve Jobs literally jumped the shark and just trying to go after trying to go after everything when he's not you know

1543
01:59:53,328 --> 02:00:01,979
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I can understand that the iPhone and the iPod Touch managed to build itself up to a gaming platform, even though it was never its true intention.

1544
02:00:03,541 --> 02:00:04,762
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, here's the thing.

1545
02:00:04,922 --> 02:00:12,652
[SPEAKER_14]: The iPad only needed a couple of really great things, and I think very clearly distinguishable things from the iPhone.

1546
02:00:12,972 --> 02:00:15,193
[SPEAKER_14]: that would have made people jump all over it.

1547
02:00:15,313 --> 02:00:24,036
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think one of them is if they put a camera in the front of it so you could video conference from anywhere, I think a lot of people would have ate that shit up right away.

1548
02:00:24,176 --> 02:00:25,136
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that would have been amazing.

1549
02:00:25,496 --> 02:00:27,857
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think the other thing is multitasking.

1550
02:00:27,937 --> 02:00:34,340
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, they go out and say, yippee, skippy, we've got a gigahertz processor in here, but you can't really surf the web.

1551
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:35,780
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a disappointment.

1552
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:36,960
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing it is is just a...

1553
02:00:38,914 --> 02:00:41,015
[SPEAKER_07]: An oversized iPhone.

1554
02:00:41,755 --> 02:00:43,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Minus the voice.

1555
02:00:44,176 --> 02:00:45,496
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I like this comment from chat.

1556
02:00:45,536 --> 02:00:50,118
[SPEAKER_14]: Decipher says, did Jobs give a thumbs up and say, hey, while jumping over the said shark?

1557
02:00:50,818 --> 02:00:51,618
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll imagine that he did.

1558
02:00:54,079 --> 02:00:59,061
[SPEAKER_14]: Since I know you're big on the mobile gaming and everything, do you think the gaming is going to take off on this platform?

1559
02:00:59,101 --> 02:01:05,343
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we already heard about how it's going to be able to play all the existing iPhone games, but you blow them up to scale or whatever.

1560
02:01:05,603 --> 02:01:21,474
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be backwards compatible with the other ones, but then you have to realize some other... You saw that actual, you know, the day they actually revealed the iPad and they had like, I think it was Gameloft that had the first person shooter tech demo that they had up there.

1561
02:01:23,297 --> 02:01:27,098
[SPEAKER_07]: It looked pretty damn good for something that small.

1562
02:01:27,318 --> 02:01:34,660
[SPEAKER_14]: But Zaku, do you think there's going to be a lot of people that are that excited about the iPad where developers are going to be jumping to the bit to develop for it?

1563
02:01:34,680 --> 02:01:38,421
[SPEAKER_07]: That depends on how much of an install base we're talking about with the iPad.

1564
02:01:38,521 --> 02:01:43,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether or not the iPad itself would have the same numbers as the iPod Touch and the iPhone.

1565
02:01:43,523 --> 02:01:48,744
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's a huge install base, then that's a pretty big market to actually make games on.

1566
02:01:49,468 --> 02:01:52,730
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing is developers have to take advantage of the platform completely.

1567
02:01:53,371 --> 02:02:03,297
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't just Mickey Mouse their way onto that platform with shitty titles.

1568
02:02:03,698 --> 02:02:11,183
[SPEAKER_07]: They have to really find a way to exploit the platform's potential.

1569
02:02:12,704 --> 02:02:18,388
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of strengths in that platform in terms of multi-touch and the accelerometer.

1570
02:02:19,386 --> 02:02:26,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Surely they could think of something that could utilize both if not all the aspects of the device.

1571
02:02:27,731 --> 02:02:32,052
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I think, though, it's important to remember that Apple loves to reinvent their shit.

1572
02:02:32,132 --> 02:02:36,153
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think, honestly, I think in a year's time, I think the iPad's going to get a lot better.

1573
02:02:36,213 --> 02:02:36,974
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's not forget.

1574
02:02:38,154 --> 02:02:38,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Good God.

1575
02:02:39,094 --> 02:02:40,995
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like he's shooting a gun at his keyboard.

1576
02:02:43,275 --> 02:02:44,236
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like whack-a-mole.

1577
02:02:44,356 --> 02:02:44,716
[SPEAKER_06]: It does.

1578
02:02:44,736 --> 02:02:46,616
[SPEAKER_14]: It sounds like you have a Chuck E. Cheese there.

1579
02:02:47,537 --> 02:02:47,797
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1580
02:02:48,717 --> 02:02:49,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's the thing.

1581
02:02:49,137 --> 02:02:52,158
[SPEAKER_14]: I think in a year's time, when that thing gets redeveloped, it's going to be great.

1582
02:02:52,198 --> 02:02:56,359
[SPEAKER_14]: Because let's not forget, the iPhone did not have the App Store when it first launched.

1583
02:02:56,499 --> 02:03:11,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, and that was like several months and that was basically Steve Jobs coming to his senses and realizing that you can't just have everything web-based when that whole web-based platform is basically a bottleneck.

1584
02:03:11,089 --> 02:03:16,733
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a robust solution for what you could actually do natively on that phone.

1585
02:03:17,193 --> 02:03:20,996
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Zach, we're going to let you go so you can go play more Whack-A-Mole, but thanks for the call, okay?

1586
02:03:21,496 --> 02:03:22,237
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, have a good one.

1587
02:03:22,257 --> 02:03:24,018
[SPEAKER_14]: Type a little bit more for us so we can hear it a little more.

1588
02:03:32,929 --> 02:03:42,155
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to have like a loudest keyboard competition here at Orange Lounge Radio in honor of the new soundboard helping us with alleviating the Jamie typing during the show noises.

1589
02:03:43,096 --> 02:03:44,957
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to have a loudest keyboard competition.

1590
02:03:46,378 --> 02:03:47,298
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't type that loudly.

1591
02:03:47,559 --> 02:03:48,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1592
02:03:49,019 --> 02:03:49,500
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

1593
02:03:50,140 --> 02:03:51,341
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Brad from PodCulture.

1594
02:03:51,461 --> 02:03:52,842
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, Brad from PodCulture.

1595
02:03:52,902 --> 02:03:54,003
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, hold that thought for a minute.

1596
02:03:54,283 --> 02:03:54,823
[SPEAKER_14]: You're right, Jamie.

1597
02:03:54,843 --> 02:03:57,105
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't type with your fists, but you have to admit...

1598
02:03:58,695 --> 02:03:59,795
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Brad, what's up?

1599
02:03:59,855 --> 02:04:00,316
[SPEAKER_14]: How you doing?

1600
02:04:01,076 --> 02:04:02,637
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm doing fine, guys.

1601
02:04:03,957 --> 02:04:04,797
[SPEAKER_14]: What's on your mind?

1602
02:04:06,758 --> 02:04:07,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Star Trek Online, man.

1603
02:04:08,279 --> 02:04:09,279
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Star Trek Online.

1604
02:04:09,319 --> 02:04:10,900
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you've been all over this game.

1605
02:04:10,940 --> 02:04:14,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations on having a computer good enough to play it, for starters.

1606
02:04:14,861 --> 02:04:20,623
[SPEAKER_10]: The computer itself isn't that old, or isn't that high-end.

1607
02:04:21,363 --> 02:04:22,404
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of RAM and a...

1608
02:04:23,274 --> 02:04:24,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Video card that was donated to us.

1609
02:04:25,135 --> 02:04:25,996
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the video card.

1610
02:04:26,016 --> 02:04:29,158
[SPEAKER_14]: The video card is so key I think for this game and well any game really.

1611
02:04:29,558 --> 02:04:32,520
[SPEAKER_14]: But tell us a little bit about your experience as a Star Trek online.

1612
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:33,320
[SPEAKER_14]: How's it been going for you?

1613
02:04:34,481 --> 02:04:35,821
[SPEAKER_10]: When I can log in, it's great.

1614
02:04:38,083 --> 02:04:48,829
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess with the beta and stuff I had some problems at first logging in and staying in and then they had one huge, almost a gig patch that seemed to smooth everything out.

1615
02:04:48,869 --> 02:04:50,050
[SPEAKER_06]: That took forever, didn't it?

1616
02:04:50,635 --> 02:04:52,816
[SPEAKER_06]: No, kidding.

1617
02:04:53,396 --> 02:04:56,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, were you there for when the beta closed?

1618
02:04:56,837 --> 02:04:59,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, I was on the Starbase getting my ass kicked by Borg.

1619
02:05:00,118 --> 02:05:01,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so how cool was it?

1620
02:05:02,618 --> 02:05:06,119
[SPEAKER_10]: It was ridiculously cool because it was hopeless.

1621
02:05:06,139 --> 02:05:08,160
[SPEAKER_10]: There's nothing you could do to win.

1622
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:10,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Did the Borg come out and say, you will die?

1623
02:05:12,081 --> 02:05:18,003
[SPEAKER_06]: When you hear the Borg, you can actually hear the big mass voice of them talking.

1624
02:05:18,043 --> 02:05:18,423
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty cool.

1625
02:05:18,973 --> 02:05:22,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the first training mission with the older Borg was pretty damn cool.

1626
02:05:25,417 --> 02:05:26,537
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's how they ended the beta?

1627
02:05:26,577 --> 02:05:27,858
[SPEAKER_14]: They just had a big Borg invasion?

1628
02:05:28,038 --> 02:05:28,158
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

1629
02:05:28,178 --> 02:05:30,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it was Borg, Klingon, every damn...

1630
02:05:32,626 --> 02:05:34,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Race Attack, and it was awesome.

1631
02:05:34,287 --> 02:05:34,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

1632
02:05:34,547 --> 02:05:38,170
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds very Ragnarok of the developers to do.

1633
02:05:38,290 --> 02:05:42,172
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of a geek Ragnarok, yeah.

1634
02:05:42,412 --> 02:05:49,377
[SPEAKER_06]: In Ragnarok, they used to just do random raids on the town by all the critters.

1635
02:05:52,679 --> 02:05:54,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you go ahead and remake your character?

1636
02:05:54,981 --> 02:05:55,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

1637
02:05:55,801 --> 02:05:56,982
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing that tonight.

1638
02:05:57,242 --> 02:05:58,543
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm almost back to where I was.

1639
02:06:00,462 --> 02:06:01,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh, that's impressive.

1640
02:06:01,644 --> 02:06:04,106
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm totally going to have a character permanently living on DS9.

1641
02:06:04,146 --> 02:06:04,486
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

1642
02:06:06,368 --> 02:06:10,373
[SPEAKER_10]: During the beta, I flew my ship out there, and it looks pretty damn slick.

1643
02:06:10,913 --> 02:06:11,414
[SPEAKER_06]: No quark!

1644
02:06:12,975 --> 02:06:15,638
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, what, 38 years or something like that?

1645
02:06:15,978 --> 02:06:17,380
[SPEAKER_06]: He still needs to make money.

1646
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:20,323
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got his own moon now, and his brother's in Nagus.

1647
02:06:21,347 --> 02:06:22,948
[SPEAKER_14]: You gotta wait for the expansion.

1648
02:06:23,008 --> 02:06:27,629
[SPEAKER_14]: There's gonna be an inevitable expansion pack, and that's where the fan service will really start getting delivered.

1649
02:06:27,649 --> 02:06:28,449
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll put Khan.

1650
02:06:28,469 --> 02:06:29,909
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll be able to fight Khan or something.

1651
02:06:29,949 --> 02:06:33,170
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he's probably long since... He died, Rob!

1652
02:06:33,530 --> 02:06:35,691
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Star Trek Online in the alternate universe, though?

1653
02:06:35,791 --> 02:06:35,931
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1654
02:06:36,471 --> 02:06:37,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

1655
02:06:37,251 --> 02:06:41,893
[SPEAKER_10]: It takes place from that point, the big event where the two universes split.

1656
02:06:42,753 --> 02:06:46,794
[SPEAKER_10]: It goes forward from, quote, our prime timeline forward.

1657
02:06:48,163 --> 02:06:49,244
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I've gone cross-eyed.

1658
02:06:50,825 --> 02:06:51,486
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll do that.

1659
02:06:51,986 --> 02:06:55,109
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say this is the first game that's actually got me to play an MMO.

1660
02:06:55,849 --> 02:06:57,411
[SPEAKER_06]: I quit World of Warcraft for this.

1661
02:06:58,491 --> 02:06:59,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this is better.

1662
02:06:59,852 --> 02:07:00,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah.

1663
02:07:01,894 --> 02:07:06,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Except I totally, totally hate the targeting system.

1664
02:07:08,794 --> 02:07:10,716
[SPEAKER_06]: More like ship navigation in combat.

1665
02:07:10,796 --> 02:07:17,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Or the fact that having never really played much in PC gaming, period, if I just suck, which I do.

1666
02:07:17,384 --> 02:07:18,285
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not you.

1667
02:07:19,145 --> 02:07:22,029
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just the control, and the walking controls are oversensitive.

1668
02:07:23,811 --> 02:07:24,431
[SPEAKER_10]: A little bit, yeah.

1669
02:07:24,692 --> 02:07:26,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, like, it's really easy to run into a wall.

1670
02:07:28,991 --> 02:07:30,934
[SPEAKER_14]: Well Brad, I hope you have a lot of fun on Star Trek Online.

1671
02:07:30,954 --> 02:07:40,227
[SPEAKER_14]: I know there's been talk about an OLR fleet, but since I'm not really playing the game until I get a better computer, that's going to be all Jamie to put together, her OLR-ian race and all that.

1672
02:07:40,267 --> 02:07:43,692
[SPEAKER_14]: So Jamie, you're going to have to get on the forums and tell people how to join up with you.

1673
02:07:43,712 --> 02:07:44,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Screw that, I'm playing a trill.

1674
02:07:45,634 --> 02:07:45,974
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

1675
02:07:46,996 --> 02:07:49,178
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, he did say join up.

1676
02:07:49,599 --> 02:07:52,102
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to make a couple of Olarians.

1677
02:07:52,122 --> 02:07:55,305
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not very orange, although I did make a really cool chick.

1678
02:07:55,586 --> 02:07:56,066
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you what.

1679
02:07:56,967 --> 02:08:02,834
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll put up some of my experimental pictures in the chat room of some of the things I've made because I saved screen caps.

1680
02:08:04,995 --> 02:08:06,576
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what I want you to do.

1681
02:08:07,296 --> 02:08:15,438
[SPEAKER_06]: If anyone wants to contribute to the Olarians, I want pictures of your creation screen with the face dimensions.

1682
02:08:15,578 --> 02:08:17,278
[SPEAKER_06]: With what you've done to make one.

1683
02:08:18,279 --> 02:08:19,439
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I want to see.

1684
02:08:19,559 --> 02:08:21,600
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully we'll get some forum chat.

1685
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:24,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Brad, I hope you have a lot of fun with Star Trek Online.

1686
02:08:24,220 --> 02:08:25,761
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully I'll be joining you in a few months.

1687
02:08:25,941 --> 02:08:31,082
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to ask you real quick though, because I know you're a big fan of this too and one of your other shows is about Dollhouse.

1688
02:08:31,702 --> 02:08:32,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.

1689
02:08:32,062 --> 02:08:35,225
[SPEAKER_14]: If I'm not mistaken, Dollhouse had its final episode this past week.

1690
02:08:35,565 --> 02:08:36,086
[SPEAKER_14]: How was it?

1691
02:08:36,686 --> 02:08:41,330
[SPEAKER_10]: It was... It was a different kind of episode.

1692
02:08:41,970 --> 02:08:46,594
[SPEAKER_10]: It was almost a sequel to the season one ender, Epitaph One.

1693
02:08:47,615 --> 02:08:48,716
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was pretty good.

1694
02:08:49,776 --> 02:08:50,877
[SPEAKER_10]: It was pretty good overall.

1695
02:08:50,917 --> 02:08:57,863
[SPEAKER_10]: It was... It's one of those things that you could tell that they had a rush.

1696
02:08:57,923 --> 02:09:00,245
[SPEAKER_10]: The last few episodes, actually, they crammed like...

1697
02:09:01,021 --> 02:09:03,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Two seasons worth into four episodes.

1698
02:09:04,443 --> 02:09:05,023
[SPEAKER_14]: That's too bad.

1699
02:09:05,083 --> 02:09:09,005
[SPEAKER_14]: Any word about what Joss Whedon's up to next, besides directing an episode of Glee, apparently?

1700
02:09:09,745 --> 02:09:17,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, apparently he's got battered wife syndrome or something because he's in talks with FX, which is pretty much Fox, about doing something.

1701
02:09:19,649 --> 02:09:21,270
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, of course, there's always Dr. Horrible 2.

1702
02:09:23,831 --> 02:09:24,891
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Dr. Horrible 2.

1703
02:09:25,112 --> 02:09:25,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Excellent, excellent.

1704
02:09:26,331 --> 02:09:29,672
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, well, Brad, we're going to let you go, but thanks so much for your call, okay?

1705
02:09:30,292 --> 02:09:30,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Alrighty, guys.

1706
02:09:31,033 --> 02:09:33,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Have fun, and the new board is sounding really good.

1707
02:09:33,454 --> 02:09:34,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much.

1708
02:09:34,314 --> 02:09:35,014
[SPEAKER_14]: We're happy to have it.

1709
02:09:35,054 --> 02:09:37,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, if only we could get all the computer stuff side-fixed, but we'll get it.

1710
02:09:38,775 --> 02:09:39,436
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, later, Brad.

1711
02:09:39,876 --> 02:09:40,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Later, guys.

1712
02:09:40,536 --> 02:09:44,137
[SPEAKER_14]: PodCulture.net if you want to hear more of Brad and his sci-fi geekdom.

1713
02:09:44,157 --> 02:09:50,020
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you liked our little Doctor Who talk earlier, or I should say DarkSakura's little Doctor Who talk earlier, like, that's Brad's show.

1714
02:09:51,460 --> 02:09:53,301
[SPEAKER_14]: That's where they live there.

1715
02:09:53,862 --> 02:09:57,144
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll debate whether 10th Doctor was better or 4th Doctor was darker.

1716
02:09:57,164 --> 02:09:58,204
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll debate that all day long.

1717
02:09:59,305 --> 02:10:00,366
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, one thing to mention.

1718
02:10:00,506 --> 02:10:04,208
[SPEAKER_06]: If anyone else is playing Star Trek Online, you can add me to your friends list.

1719
02:10:04,248 --> 02:10:09,952
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in there as DarkSakura with the space in between the two on the Star Trek Online page.

1720
02:10:10,332 --> 02:10:11,153
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we got another call.

1721
02:10:11,193 --> 02:10:12,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1722
02:10:12,033 --> 02:10:12,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

1723
02:10:13,614 --> 02:10:15,636
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening, you across the ocean.

1724
02:10:16,116 --> 02:10:17,097
[SPEAKER_14]: How are you, my friend?

1725
02:10:18,137 --> 02:10:23,022
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Akeriper, as well as new listeners.

1726
02:10:23,042 --> 02:10:24,203
[SPEAKER_08]: What the fuck?

1727
02:10:24,403 --> 02:10:24,844
[SPEAKER_08]: I will help.

1728
02:10:25,244 --> 02:10:26,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh well, anyway, good evening.

1729
02:10:27,126 --> 02:10:27,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

1730
02:10:28,627 --> 02:10:32,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Or good morning, if you are to be incorrect or something.

1731
02:10:34,353 --> 02:10:38,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, it's like half past five.

1732
02:10:38,957 --> 02:10:40,579
[SPEAKER_14]: It's five in the morning where you are?

1733
02:10:41,590 --> 02:10:43,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's 5.35.

1734
02:10:43,694 --> 02:10:47,481
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel so bad we weren't able to do the early show, but, you know, shit happens.

1735
02:10:47,501 --> 02:10:47,902
[SPEAKER_14]: What can we do?

1736
02:10:47,922 --> 02:10:49,666
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing is that, well, yeah...

1737
02:10:53,381 --> 02:11:12,670
[SPEAKER_08]: I was almost about to actually miss it, since I was just shaking around a bit, and then I just found out, oh yeah, this supposed show is like now, but I haven't slept that much, so, oh well, what the hell, I'll see if it happens, but it didn't, so, well.

1738
02:11:13,550 --> 02:11:16,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what's on your mind tonight, Aki Ripper?

1739
02:11:17,376 --> 02:11:23,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, well, um, Mass Effect 2 is an awesome game.

1740
02:11:24,321 --> 02:11:25,002
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course.

1741
02:11:25,602 --> 02:11:28,865
[SPEAKER_14]: We haven't mentioned anything about Mass Effect 2, but that was a huge release this week.

1742
02:11:28,925 --> 02:11:33,028
[SPEAKER_14]: I know it's been getting a lot of, like, especially folks that just loved the first one are all about this game.

1743
02:11:33,468 --> 02:11:35,510
[SPEAKER_14]: Tell us a little bit about your experience with Mass Effect 2.

1744
02:11:36,856 --> 02:11:41,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I've, uh, well, uh, I, uh, well, what can I say?

1745
02:11:41,640 --> 02:11:43,682
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm an impatient fuck, so to say.

1746
02:11:44,382 --> 02:12:02,498
[SPEAKER_08]: I should really be, like, and I'm, uh, and I'm, like, in a kind of way, uh, almost, but still not, uh, doing that, since, well, the whole story is that I got the, uh, cracked, the, got the pirated version of it, and played it all through, and

1747
02:12:03,727 --> 02:12:13,712
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I tried to install my retail copy, and my retail copy will not work for some strange reason.

1748
02:12:16,154 --> 02:12:31,922
[SPEAKER_08]: But here's the other thing, is that since I'm still running the Windows 7 beta, which runs out of time pretty soon, it doesn't annoy me that much, so to say.

1749
02:12:34,059 --> 02:12:36,241
[SPEAKER_14]: But how is Mass Effect?

1750
02:12:36,261 --> 02:12:38,103
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I'm not as up and up on Mass Effect.

1751
02:12:38,143 --> 02:12:43,307
[SPEAKER_14]: I watched a friend play it once for a little while, and obviously I've heard it's a Bioware RPG, it's awesome.

1752
02:12:43,467 --> 02:12:44,948
[SPEAKER_14]: What are some of the differences between 1 and 2?

1753
02:12:45,388 --> 02:12:48,011
[SPEAKER_14]: Or is it really just like a continuation of one story?

1754
02:12:49,051 --> 02:12:59,620
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole difference between Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 1 is really the combat is way much better.

1755
02:13:01,612 --> 02:13:22,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Way, way, uh, much better since, well, um, it annoys me really at first because, well, uh, I'm not, because basically they, I, I felt like they've turned like Mass Effect into Gears of War, which is, well, you run for cover and cover, cover, and, uh, well, you shoot for it, shoot from cover.

1756
02:13:23,147 --> 02:13:30,412
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was a mechanic that I didn't at first like really at all.

1757
02:13:31,519 --> 02:13:40,502
[SPEAKER_08]: But, well, after a while I got used to it, and then I've just been reminded, yeah, what's the difference between this and Gears of War?

1758
02:13:40,842 --> 02:13:56,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, here you actually have a health bar, or shield meters, and you can actually rush people, kill them up front, and...

1759
02:13:58,107 --> 02:14:01,579
[SPEAKER_08]: and in Mass Effect 2, I don't die after like five minutes.

1760
02:14:04,696 --> 02:14:08,419
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, good, because I'm totally the type of bonsai kind of player where I just run out.

1761
02:14:10,240 --> 02:14:12,922
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not very good with covering that, so excellent.

1762
02:14:13,363 --> 02:14:20,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, IKripper, I want to wrap up real quick and get to some other calls, but quickly, what are some other games you're looking forward to in the next couple weeks?

1763
02:14:21,789 --> 02:14:22,529
[SPEAKER_14]: Bioshock 2.

1764
02:14:22,770 --> 02:14:24,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, another great one.

1765
02:14:25,692 --> 02:14:29,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but these... And that's the...

1766
02:14:31,374 --> 02:14:34,436
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the only game I have room for in my budget.

1767
02:14:36,058 --> 02:14:40,461
[SPEAKER_08]: But here's the other thing.

1768
02:14:40,601 --> 02:14:46,926
[SPEAKER_08]: For both Mass Effect 2 and Bioshock 2, I've went and got the collector's one.

1769
02:14:48,047 --> 02:14:58,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially the Bioshock one is really interesting because you get the soundtrack that you get in the special one is the

1770
02:14:59,075 --> 02:15:02,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Record, that authentic record, apparently.

1771
02:15:03,417 --> 02:15:13,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is, like, that's like a few nerd bonuses from me, which makes it like insta-buy.

1772
02:15:15,361 --> 02:15:16,541
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I will...

1773
02:15:17,193 --> 02:15:17,493
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1774
02:15:17,853 --> 02:15:21,595
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I gotta let you go to get some more calls, but have fun with your collector's edition.

1775
02:15:21,635 --> 02:15:21,975
[SPEAKER_14]: Enjoy.

1776
02:15:22,795 --> 02:15:22,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1777
02:15:23,215 --> 02:15:23,495
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1778
02:15:23,815 --> 02:15:24,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Later.

1779
02:15:24,916 --> 02:15:28,037
[SPEAKER_14]: And thanks for staying up or getting up earlier, staying up late.

1780
02:15:28,057 --> 02:15:30,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, you know he's staying up late to listen to the program.

1781
02:15:30,598 --> 02:15:32,679
[SPEAKER_14]: That's an awesome commitment for you guys overseas.

1782
02:15:33,739 --> 02:15:34,039
[SPEAKER_14]: Love it.

1783
02:15:35,780 --> 02:15:36,140
[SPEAKER_14]: Why not?

1784
02:15:36,220 --> 02:15:37,980
[SPEAKER_14]: We can do some more calls.

1785
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:38,720
[SPEAKER_14]: 877-GAME-OLR.

1786
02:15:38,821 --> 02:15:40,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1787
02:15:41,001 --> 02:15:48,983
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm just having fun hearing some of these people through the new computer because now that we kind of had to reconfigure our sound, it's actually helping the calls a lot.

1788
02:15:49,524 --> 02:15:50,964
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm actually kind of impressed.

1789
02:15:52,574 --> 02:15:54,035
[SPEAKER_14]: We should have done this like three years ago.

1790
02:15:55,095 --> 02:15:56,275
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1791
02:15:56,295 --> 02:15:56,695
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

1792
02:15:57,296 --> 02:15:58,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, this is X-Link.

1793
02:15:58,336 --> 02:15:58,936
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, X-Link.

1794
02:15:58,976 --> 02:15:59,476
[SPEAKER_14]: How you doing?

1795
02:15:59,837 --> 02:16:00,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, doing good.

1796
02:16:00,537 --> 02:16:02,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a few things I'd like to talk about real quick.

1797
02:16:02,718 --> 02:16:03,518
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I suppose.

1798
02:16:05,298 --> 02:16:05,839
[SPEAKER_03]: The iPad.

1799
02:16:05,859 --> 02:16:13,541
[SPEAKER_03]: The only good thing I can see about that is maybe playing desktop version of D&D, making it more better, enhancing it a little bit.

1800
02:16:13,701 --> 02:16:17,143
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only cool thing I could possibly see ever coming out of that thing for $500.

1801
02:16:18,223 --> 02:16:23,749
[SPEAKER_14]: Funny enough, another giant, I mean, not a tablet so much, but that table, the Surface.

1802
02:16:23,969 --> 02:16:30,096
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember a story we had a couple months ago, maybe like last month, about a big D&D game that was on the Surface.

1803
02:16:30,316 --> 02:16:34,220
[SPEAKER_14]: I know it was supposed to be kind of really innovative for that platform.

1804
02:16:34,280 --> 02:16:38,404
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's an interesting way of thinking is the iPad as a D&D device.

1805
02:16:38,905 --> 02:16:39,546
[SPEAKER_14]: I could see that.

1806
02:16:40,226 --> 02:16:40,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

1807
02:16:41,347 --> 02:16:53,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Mass Effect had a big patch about two months ago for the first game that they took a lot of the issues that they were having, like in the screens where there was dialogue, where it was spoken, a lot of times it would skip.

1808
02:16:53,571 --> 02:17:00,674
[SPEAKER_03]: They cleared a lot of that up, which was really helpful and made the gameplay a lot better, a lot more smooth than it was before.

1809
02:17:02,755 --> 02:17:17,642
[SPEAKER_03]: and then on Mass Effect 2 I'm hearing they're taking a lot of the took a lot of the gameplay and a lot of the stuff for like the experience for how when you level up a character and made it more easier and the interface more easier than what's beforehand hmm so that was very interesting

1810
02:17:17,955 --> 02:17:19,836
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to have to check these games out at some point.

1811
02:17:19,856 --> 02:17:21,937
[SPEAKER_14]: There's too many games to play, especially now.

1812
02:17:22,037 --> 02:17:24,377
[SPEAKER_14]: Usually we're not saying this in January, February.

1813
02:17:24,457 --> 02:17:27,098
[SPEAKER_14]: It's insane what the release calendar looks like.

1814
02:17:27,118 --> 02:17:28,979
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm starting to wonder what's left for Christmas.

1815
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:30,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1816
02:17:30,460 --> 02:17:40,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's hard for me because I work, and then I do my online schooling, and then between that and trying to level my character in WoW still, it's kind of hard to go back and forth.

1817
02:17:40,604 --> 02:17:40,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1818
02:17:42,786 --> 02:17:53,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I just now got to like 9 hours of Mass Effect 1 for the PC which I'm really enjoying a lot Weren't you telling me on Warcraft that you bought that on some Steam sale or something?

1819
02:17:54,528 --> 02:17:57,891
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I bought a few other things on Steam, but that wasn't one of them.

1820
02:17:57,971 --> 02:18:03,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I bought that one at a store for $15, $10 when it was on sale.

1821
02:18:03,935 --> 02:18:04,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1822
02:18:05,096 --> 02:18:06,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was a real good value for it.

1823
02:18:07,158 --> 02:18:08,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember what I bought.

1824
02:18:09,560 --> 02:18:12,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm going to go back and try to remind myself what I bought last from Steam.

1825
02:18:13,763 --> 02:18:16,005
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's been a while since I bought something from there.

1826
02:18:16,805 --> 02:18:19,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually I get most of my stuff while it was on sale during that Christmas time, but...

1827
02:18:22,934 --> 02:18:26,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question for Loki though.

1828
02:18:26,175 --> 02:18:29,436
[SPEAKER_03]: I was planning on trying down the road here getting an Xbox 360.

1829
02:18:29,496 --> 02:18:33,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Which system would be the best for my value?

1830
02:18:33,837 --> 02:18:36,978
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all about the same because it's really just what size hard drive you want.

1831
02:18:37,478 --> 02:18:39,939
[SPEAKER_11]: So probably just...

1832
02:18:41,798 --> 02:18:44,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Elite Elite Elite Elite Elite

1833
02:18:58,934 --> 02:19:00,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it's just the Elite and the Core now?

1834
02:19:00,936 --> 02:19:02,477
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you need to just get the Elite, I think.

1835
02:19:02,818 --> 02:19:09,003
[SPEAKER_14]: The Arcade is good for replacing a dead 360, which is what I just did, or people that really don't play console games a lot.

1836
02:19:09,023 --> 02:19:11,585
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you're going to play your games... Think about it.

1837
02:19:11,645 --> 02:19:17,631
[SPEAKER_14]: If you get an Arcade unit and you want to play 1 versus 100, you have no place to store the game because you have to download it from the server.

1838
02:19:17,931 --> 02:19:19,172
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're going to need a hard drive.

1839
02:19:19,532 --> 02:19:22,014
[SPEAKER_14]: And by the way, it's very interesting.

1840
02:19:22,215 --> 02:19:25,858
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, something that I don't hear enough people question...

1841
02:19:27,236 --> 02:19:28,617
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1842
02:19:44,910 --> 02:19:47,811
[SPEAKER_14]: without any type of wireless adapter built in.

1843
02:19:47,831 --> 02:19:50,932
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't put the component cable in with the Sony systems either.

1844
02:19:51,092 --> 02:19:51,912
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, fair enough.

1845
02:19:51,932 --> 02:19:52,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Then I'll give you that one.

1846
02:19:52,592 --> 02:19:57,634
[SPEAKER_14]: But without a wireless adapter where Sony has that built in, yes, and Microsoft wants $100 for theirs.

1847
02:19:57,654 --> 02:19:59,775
[SPEAKER_11]: But some people don't need that, and so why pay the extra money for it?

1848
02:19:59,815 --> 02:20:07,717
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just saying it's not brought up enough that what's the value you're getting, especially now that the PS3 is $299.

1849
02:20:09,017 --> 02:20:10,958
[SPEAKER_14]: They're about equal now, I think.

1850
02:20:11,818 --> 02:20:12,799
[SPEAKER_14]: So something to think about.

1851
02:20:12,959 --> 02:20:13,479
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, sorry.

1852
02:20:13,499 --> 02:20:13,599
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1853
02:20:15,460 --> 02:20:16,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Really quickly, I'll let you go.

1854
02:20:17,102 --> 02:20:20,164
[SPEAKER_03]: The Battle.net, you were asking about that.

1855
02:20:20,845 --> 02:20:31,334
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually own a copy of Warcraft 3 with the expansion, and the funny thing about that is when I registered that onto it, I can now download that anytime I want through them.

1856
02:20:32,015 --> 02:20:37,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is good, because if I ever lose a disc, or the disc gets lost when I move from place to place, or it gets broken or something...

1857
02:20:38,501 --> 02:20:50,122
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good enough to know that I can log on to that site and re-download the game and not worry about, you know, have to go out and spend another 30, 40 bucks or 20 bucks or whatever to replace the game.

1858
02:20:50,899 --> 02:21:00,221
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely, I'm trying to find my old Diablo 2 key for the same reason, because I want to play that again, and I know I can download it, but I can't find my old CD, the game's just so freaking old.

1859
02:21:00,762 --> 02:21:10,744
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's cool about it, if you put the CD key into the battle.net, it will not only appear on your screen like it does with Warcraft and everything, but also it will let you download it.

1860
02:21:10,764 --> 02:21:15,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, if you click on the game, you can download the game onto your computer.

1861
02:21:15,145 --> 02:21:15,626
[SPEAKER_14]: Very cool.

1862
02:21:16,226 --> 02:21:17,146
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's very plus.

1863
02:21:17,646 --> 02:21:21,751
[SPEAKER_14]: X-Link, we're going to wrap up and let you go so we can try and squeeze a couple more calls in, but thank you so much, okay?

1864
02:21:21,871 --> 02:21:23,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Take care, buddy.

1865
02:21:23,312 --> 02:21:26,316
[SPEAKER_14]: 877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1866
02:21:26,356 --> 02:21:29,920
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see if any more calls come in, but I'll let Loki start some last-minute news.

1867
02:21:31,432 --> 02:21:34,934
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm assuming Jamie doesn't have anything, but I don't know if you have anything, Jamie.

1868
02:21:35,234 --> 02:21:36,234
[SPEAKER_11]: Way to assume, Rob.

1869
02:21:36,454 --> 02:21:36,995
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just saying.

1870
02:21:37,015 --> 02:21:37,555
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have anything.

1871
02:21:37,735 --> 02:21:38,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Aha, I was right.

1872
02:21:39,136 --> 02:21:43,638
[SPEAKER_11]: There's more Who coming to the Rock Band marketplace.

1873
02:21:44,158 --> 02:21:48,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently some more tracks are going to be coming on February 7th, according to an advertisement.

1874
02:21:48,900 --> 02:21:53,082
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like, oh, that's in Rock Band?

1875
02:21:53,102 --> 02:21:54,583
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1876
02:21:54,723 --> 02:21:57,664
[SPEAKER_11]: It's some digital advertisement, but that's kind of neat.

1877
02:21:57,824 --> 02:21:58,684
[SPEAKER_14]: We got another call coming in.

1878
02:21:58,704 --> 02:21:59,645
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

1879
02:21:59,665 --> 02:21:59,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

1880
02:22:00,987 --> 02:22:01,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, it's Sterlok.

1881
02:22:01,987 --> 02:22:02,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Sterlok.

1882
02:22:02,628 --> 02:22:03,168
[SPEAKER_14]: What's on your mind?

1883
02:22:04,088 --> 02:22:04,689
[SPEAKER_12]: Eh, not much.

1884
02:22:04,709 --> 02:22:10,331
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to let you guys know about something cool I found a few weeks ago.

1885
02:22:10,651 --> 02:22:11,532
[SPEAKER_12]: We like cool stuff.

1886
02:22:11,592 --> 02:22:11,912
[SPEAKER_12]: What's up?

1887
02:22:13,332 --> 02:22:18,635
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, remember the FC Mobile, which was the portable NES?

1888
02:22:18,935 --> 02:22:19,515
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I do.

1889
02:22:19,815 --> 02:22:21,796
[SPEAKER_12]: I got that as a Christmas present, which was amazing.

1890
02:22:21,956 --> 02:22:22,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one too.

1891
02:22:23,697 --> 02:22:26,898
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, now there is a portable Super Nintendo.

1892
02:22:27,218 --> 02:22:28,739
[SPEAKER_06]: It's done by a really crappy company.

1893
02:22:29,386 --> 02:22:33,308
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it kind of is, but it's not that bad.

1894
02:22:34,068 --> 02:22:40,831
[SPEAKER_14]: Does this mean the patents are up on the Super Nintendo technology or something, where now we're going to start seeing all these bootleg Super Nintendos come out?

1895
02:22:42,112 --> 02:22:42,672
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess so.

1896
02:22:42,692 --> 02:22:44,493
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess we're going to be seeing more of these.

1897
02:22:44,853 --> 02:22:48,314
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe this is the first one out the gate, but that means there might be some more of these in the future.

1898
02:22:48,614 --> 02:22:53,297
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, tell us a little more about the system, because even though Jamie's heard of it, I have not.

1899
02:22:54,237 --> 02:22:55,177
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's called the FC-16 Go.

1900
02:22:55,197 --> 02:22:55,237
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

1901
02:22:59,355 --> 02:23:13,380
[SPEAKER_12]: and yeah, it's done by Yobo who did the FC Twin and like the FC3 and I don't know, they're not the greatest but the Super Nintendo end seems to be kind of improved in this.

1902
02:23:15,140 --> 02:23:16,061
[SPEAKER_12]: It does play Star Fox.

1903
02:23:16,881 --> 02:23:17,521
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my gosh.

1904
02:23:18,402 --> 02:23:18,722
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.

1905
02:23:19,642 --> 02:23:20,162
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.

1906
02:23:21,283 --> 02:23:27,165
[SPEAKER_12]: My only real complaint about it is the headphone jack is retarded.

1907
02:23:27,925 --> 02:23:28,145
[SPEAKER_12]: Like

1908
02:23:28,530 --> 02:23:34,975
[SPEAKER_12]: The headphone jack is not your standard, you know, three and a half millimeter, you know, whatever.

1909
02:23:35,716 --> 02:23:41,180
[SPEAKER_12]: It's 2.5, which is, you know, like what you would see like in a cell phone headset.

1910
02:23:41,420 --> 02:23:41,940
[SPEAKER_14]: That's weird.

1911
02:23:41,960 --> 02:23:46,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think that might be a region thing because cell phones are so prevalent in the other countries?

1912
02:23:46,184 --> 02:23:50,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe where this is really... I don't... I mean, I solved that problem.

1913
02:23:50,667 --> 02:23:52,429
[SPEAKER_12]: I just got an adapter and that was that.

1914
02:23:53,349 --> 02:23:54,770
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what Radio Shacks are really good for.

1915
02:23:54,790 --> 02:23:56,212
[SPEAKER_12]: I need an adapter.

1916
02:23:56,232 --> 02:23:56,412
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1917
02:23:57,182 --> 02:23:57,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, exactly.

1918
02:23:58,263 --> 02:24:01,105
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, I haven't found anything that doesn't work on it.

1919
02:24:02,225 --> 02:24:03,206
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's pretty cool.

1920
02:24:03,286 --> 02:24:06,228
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess Super Mario RPG probably doesn't work.

1921
02:24:06,288 --> 02:24:07,829
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know because I don't have the game.

1922
02:24:08,049 --> 02:24:17,115
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it the same type of thing like the FC Mobile where it's kind of like you can have it on a little portable system or you can hook it into the TV and do it that way?

1923
02:24:17,695 --> 02:24:21,799
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep, it is, and it comes with two wireless controllers also.

1924
02:24:22,279 --> 02:24:22,920
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, wow.

1925
02:24:23,060 --> 02:24:24,762
[SPEAKER_12]: And the controllers are actually pretty good.

1926
02:24:24,882 --> 02:24:25,602
[SPEAKER_12]: Drool.

1927
02:24:26,623 --> 02:24:30,587
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm very excited at the idea, because Super Nintendo, I'm sorry, is the best console they ever put out.

1928
02:24:30,907 --> 02:24:33,850
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think they'll ever put out a console that good ever again.

1929
02:24:34,530 --> 02:24:39,635
[SPEAKER_14]: Just being able to play some of these games like Kid Icarus, or not Kid Icarus, I was going to say Super Metroid, and

1930
02:24:40,395 --> 02:25:05,545
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish the hypothetical Super Nintendo Kid Icarus game in my head an Actraiser in Final Fantasy 3 6, whatever you want to call it which does work on it with the PC Engine Duo that wasn't even released in the US so I have no memories of that sorry, it's got some of the best games ever which was kind of a bastardized Rondo of Blood pretty much alright, well Sterlok, anything else on your mind buddy?

1931
02:25:06,924 --> 02:25:07,444
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that was it.

1932
02:25:07,805 --> 02:25:08,065
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1933
02:25:08,105 --> 02:25:12,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, thank you so much for the call, and have fun with that FC-16 device.

1934
02:25:12,631 --> 02:25:13,553
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's pretty fun.

1935
02:25:13,613 --> 02:25:16,436
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to look into it, but I'm going to wait and see what kind of competition comes out.

1936
02:25:16,717 --> 02:25:17,037
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see.

1937
02:25:17,218 --> 02:25:17,438
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1938
02:25:17,718 --> 02:25:18,960
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure there will be other things.

1939
02:25:19,220 --> 02:25:19,481
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1940
02:25:19,601 --> 02:25:20,061
[SPEAKER_14]: Take care, buddy.

1941
02:25:20,662 --> 02:25:20,862
[SPEAKER_14]: See you.

1942
02:25:21,983 --> 02:25:25,144
[SPEAKER_14]: GameGuru says, expect the FC64 to come soon.

1943
02:25:25,184 --> 02:25:25,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Who knows?

1944
02:25:25,824 --> 02:25:28,424
[SPEAKER_14]: It sounds like it's about, what, 20 years on the patents or something?

1945
02:25:28,484 --> 02:25:34,586
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know exactly how that all works, but it's going to be interesting when the ones on the PlayStation and so forth are up.

1946
02:25:34,966 --> 02:25:36,406
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm really curious to see what happens there.

1947
02:25:37,606 --> 02:25:40,587
[SPEAKER_14]: Decipher in chat says, I want a portable N64 so bad.

1948
02:25:41,007 --> 02:25:42,087
[SPEAKER_14]: Go buy a Nintendo DS.

1949
02:25:42,587 --> 02:25:43,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously?

1950
02:25:43,168 --> 02:25:44,028
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what they pretty much are.

1951
02:25:44,348 --> 02:25:47,268
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, do you have any other last-minute stories while we see if any other calls come in?

1952
02:25:48,329 --> 02:25:49,529
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, let's see.

1953
02:25:50,711 --> 02:25:51,532
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got a call coming in.

1954
02:25:51,552 --> 02:25:51,792
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on.

1955
02:25:53,514 --> 02:25:54,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1956
02:25:54,735 --> 02:25:55,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

1957
02:25:55,816 --> 02:25:56,937
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, it's Salacious Pop.

1958
02:25:57,398 --> 02:25:58,358
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, how are you?

1959
02:25:59,079 --> 02:25:59,460
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm good.

1960
02:25:59,520 --> 02:25:59,940
[SPEAKER_14]: How are you?

1961
02:26:00,200 --> 02:26:01,001
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm great.

1962
02:26:02,122 --> 02:26:07,207
[SPEAKER_14]: For those listeners that don't know, Salacious Pop, you know this show pretty well, right?

1963
02:26:07,948 --> 02:26:09,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've been listening since about September.

1964
02:26:09,469 --> 02:26:13,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and is there any type of a special relationship you have to this program?

1965
02:26:14,136 --> 02:26:15,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I might be going out with one of the hosts.

1966
02:26:18,084 --> 02:26:18,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a room!

1967
02:26:19,186 --> 02:26:19,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1968
02:26:20,087 --> 02:26:24,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Shermie and I, we just, you know... It's kiddie love.

1969
02:26:24,580 --> 02:26:24,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of...

1970
02:26:51,860 --> 02:26:54,963
[SPEAKER_14]: Flapping hands and flailing, it was very chaotic and stressful.

1971
02:26:55,344 --> 02:26:59,728
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, and you're probably just kind of watching going, just like Shermie, kind of watching going, what?

1972
02:27:01,010 --> 02:27:04,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was my fault that I was there.

1973
02:27:05,034 --> 02:27:09,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I did 9-11, and I caused all that cancer, and then I set up the bomb for all our...

1974
02:27:10,707 --> 02:27:12,868
[SPEAKER_02]: To all the UK listeners, I'm sorry.

1975
02:27:13,108 --> 02:27:14,709
[SPEAKER_02]: My presence there sort of cursed the machine.

1976
02:27:15,189 --> 02:27:16,989
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a new system now.

1977
02:27:17,349 --> 02:27:19,630
[SPEAKER_14]: I see.

1978
02:27:19,670 --> 02:27:21,851
[SPEAKER_14]: To what do we owe your phone call tonight?

1979
02:27:23,011 --> 02:27:29,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just being silly and wanted to say hello and say that I'm really looking forward to eventually being a guest.

1980
02:27:31,294 --> 02:27:33,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe this room will be less chaotic next time you're here.

1981
02:27:34,055 --> 02:27:34,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's hope.

1982
02:27:34,755 --> 02:27:35,095
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1983
02:27:35,115 --> 02:27:36,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Tonight was pretty bad.

1984
02:27:36,496 --> 02:27:39,817
[SPEAKER_14]: The only difference between what you saw and tonight is that we actually had a show tonight.

1985
02:27:41,226 --> 02:27:42,347
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a bigger mess in here now.

1986
02:27:42,367 --> 02:27:43,528
[SPEAKER_14]: But there was lots of flailing.

1987
02:27:44,228 --> 02:27:44,408
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1988
02:27:45,089 --> 02:27:45,769
[SPEAKER_14]: There really was.

1989
02:27:46,410 --> 02:27:48,311
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what about this week's news?

1990
02:27:49,112 --> 02:27:52,014
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you've got something to say about some of these topics going on here.

1991
02:27:52,234 --> 02:27:56,877
[SPEAKER_14]: You were the one that gave me the Steam story.

1992
02:27:57,998 --> 02:28:06,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of my internet trolling for news has involved just wank about the iPad, which I know that everyone's gone over about a million times on tonight's show.

1993
02:28:06,685 --> 02:28:07,885
[SPEAKER_02]: But just that it's not very good.

1994
02:28:11,162 --> 02:28:17,167
[SPEAKER_02]: As a huge Half-Life fan, I was upset that Black Mesa Source was bumped until this year, but that's like a month-old story.

1995
02:28:17,908 --> 02:28:23,392
[SPEAKER_02]: They were supposed to release their remake of Half-Life 1 by the end of last year, and it didn't happen.

1996
02:28:24,172 --> 02:28:28,636
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember hearing something about that, and I remember you were kind of upset about that, because I know you're a big Half-Life fan.

1997
02:28:29,156 --> 02:28:30,117
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever happened to Episode 3?

1998
02:28:30,477 --> 02:28:31,618
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the other big question, right?

1999
02:28:32,399 --> 02:28:35,041
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn them!

2000
02:28:35,401 --> 02:28:38,904
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably going to be so big that they're just going to throw it into Half-Life 3.

2001
02:28:39,682 --> 02:28:41,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really need to.

2002
02:28:41,062 --> 02:28:42,003
[SPEAKER_02]: And why don't you own a Wii?

2003
02:28:42,203 --> 02:28:43,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you have a 360 and a PS3.

2004
02:28:43,423 --> 02:28:44,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I put off buying...

2005
02:29:09,744 --> 02:29:14,888
[SPEAKER_02]: The 360 and the PS3 because I wanted an HDTV because they were made for HDTVs.

2006
02:29:15,448 --> 02:29:26,636
[SPEAKER_02]: So now that I have the TV and Wii is now standard def, the video file in me is offended by that and I just don't want one.

2007
02:29:26,736 --> 02:29:28,417
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I don't know.

2008
02:29:28,958 --> 02:29:29,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo's being ignorant?

2009
02:29:30,679 --> 02:29:31,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2010
02:29:31,599 --> 02:29:35,082
[SPEAKER_02]: If they put out an HD one or the Wii whatever, Omega...

2011
02:29:35,848 --> 02:29:37,569
[SPEAKER_02]: in a year or two, the next gen.

2012
02:29:37,649 --> 02:29:43,394
[SPEAKER_02]: I would get that, but I just don't want... I'm sort of over standard definition.

2013
02:29:43,894 --> 02:29:47,377
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't care that they're the only system you can do the new Super Mario Bros.

2014
02:29:47,557 --> 02:29:48,678
[SPEAKER_14]: or Super Smash Bros.

2015
02:29:48,698 --> 02:29:55,102
[SPEAKER_14]: Melee or this Metroid Other M or the fancy Zelda games, but until it's pretty, no thank you.

2016
02:29:57,764 --> 02:29:58,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.

2017
02:29:59,666 --> 02:30:03,148
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it sounds really superficial and I hate the...

2018
02:30:04,642 --> 02:30:31,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Fanboys on the forum to just say oh you know the graphics blah blah blah it's all about the graphics but those franchises I've visited those franchises so much and I've played the previous incarnations of Zelda and Metroid that I can just go to a friend's house like it's not that important to me to get a system for those specific franchises which is really all Nintendo is now like you have to be with Nintendo if you want the Zelda whereas all the third party is with

2019
02:30:33,191 --> 02:30:52,038
[SPEAKER_14]: Sony and Microsoft so alright well you know that I have a Nintendo system so you know you can come over and play Zelda or what have you if I choose to buy those games for the record you guys are both invited everyone in this room including me because I live here and on the phone with us is invited for PC Engine Night

2020
02:30:52,729 --> 02:30:53,950
[SPEAKER_14]: When is PC Engine Night?

2021
02:30:54,170 --> 02:30:54,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometime.

2022
02:30:55,772 --> 02:30:57,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe after Moving Chaos?

2023
02:30:57,453 --> 02:30:58,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

2024
02:30:58,053 --> 02:31:01,036
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll get Alan down here one week and we'll have PC Engine Night.

2025
02:31:01,076 --> 02:31:01,496
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be fun.

2026
02:31:01,516 --> 02:31:03,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, we'll get our Dracula X on.

2027
02:31:03,778 --> 02:31:08,081
[SPEAKER_14]: Or bring PC Engine over to New Casa de Rob that'll be wired for video and everything.

2028
02:31:08,101 --> 02:31:10,303
[SPEAKER_06]: If Dan doesn't crap his pants like he did last time.

2029
02:31:10,523 --> 02:31:11,384
[SPEAKER_14]: Just steal it.

2030
02:31:11,544 --> 02:31:13,025
[SPEAKER_14]: I did last time.

2031
02:31:13,705 --> 02:31:14,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.

2032
02:31:14,626 --> 02:31:17,288
[SPEAKER_14]: I should probably let you go.

2033
02:31:17,729 --> 02:31:20,070
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate to do that to you, but I'll talk to you later.

2034
02:31:20,090 --> 02:31:20,431
[SPEAKER_14]: You know that.

2035
02:31:20,951 --> 02:31:21,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2036
02:31:21,391 --> 02:31:21,631
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2037
02:31:21,771 --> 02:31:22,231
[SPEAKER_14]: You take care.

2038
02:31:22,391 --> 02:31:22,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night, guys.

2039
02:31:22,791 --> 02:31:24,012
[SPEAKER_14]: Great show.

2040
02:31:24,232 --> 02:31:24,452
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye.

2041
02:31:24,572 --> 02:31:24,892
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2042
02:31:24,932 --> 02:31:25,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye.

2043
02:31:26,112 --> 02:31:26,392
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2044
02:31:27,152 --> 02:31:28,733
[SPEAKER_14]: That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2045
02:31:28,793 --> 02:31:34,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry to those folks that didn't get through, but hey, we need emails, so you should totally write us some emails if you didn't get through tonight.

2046
02:31:34,174 --> 02:31:34,934
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be awesome.

2047
02:31:35,694 --> 02:31:37,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

2048
02:31:38,095 --> 02:31:41,195
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to let Loki wrap up with any other last-minute stories, and then we're going to wrap up the show.

2049
02:31:41,275 --> 02:31:41,535
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki.

2050
02:31:42,756 --> 02:31:48,877
[SPEAKER_11]: The developer behind the Survivor horror game that came out last summer, Cursed Mountain, has gone under.

2051
02:31:48,897 --> 02:31:49,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2052
02:31:51,305 --> 02:31:54,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently they've run into some financial trouble.

2053
02:31:56,367 --> 02:31:57,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh well, I got shut down.

2054
02:31:58,768 --> 02:32:00,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Too bad.

2055
02:32:03,009 --> 02:32:04,510
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I pretty much had.

2056
02:32:04,710 --> 02:32:13,393
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Dragon Quest looks like 6 is going to have some new anti-piracy measures put in place on that cart, so it might be a little harder to...

2057
02:32:15,646 --> 02:32:36,201
[SPEAKER_11]: DeKrak, and then also there's this one game that I'm playing now that's a homebrew game that's now available on, or I should say that it was a free game that was available now on Wii Homebrew, which is Psyobon, which is Cat Mario, and it's extremely hard and funny because it's extremely hard.

2058
02:32:36,221 --> 02:32:38,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that what you were giggling at during the Skype calls?

2059
02:32:38,823 --> 02:32:40,223
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just really brutal.

2060
02:32:41,344 --> 02:32:43,626
[SPEAKER_11]: The second level, you're supposed to go into the warp pipe

2061
02:32:43,906 --> 02:32:57,679
[SPEAKER_14]: if you wonder why Loki doesn't talk much during the Skype segment unless you specifically call out his name it's because that's the point of the show where he's catching up on all the funny stuff and you'll randomly just hear him hee hee hee over there in the corner wait it doesn't sound like that but you know what I mean he's laughing at something on the internet

2062
02:32:59,719 --> 02:32:59,979
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2063
02:33:00,159 --> 02:33:00,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that it?

2064
02:33:00,920 --> 02:33:01,900
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all.

2065
02:33:02,400 --> 02:33:04,041
[SPEAKER_14]: We are about out of here.

2066
02:33:04,521 --> 02:33:08,383
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we're going to wrap up the show, but not until we go around and get everybody's final thought.

2067
02:33:08,403 --> 02:33:15,467
[SPEAKER_14]: But I do want to say before we get to the final thoughts, thank you guys so much for downloading Orange Launch Radio and checking us out and sticking with us through the good times and the bad.

2068
02:33:15,867 --> 02:33:21,390
[SPEAKER_14]: I know it sucks that we haven't had any show the past couple weeks, but I'm looking at the live listening numbers and we haven't really tapered off.

2069
02:33:21,450 --> 02:33:22,651
[SPEAKER_14]: We're still right back where we were.

2070
02:33:23,151 --> 02:33:24,512
[SPEAKER_14]: And so thank you guys for coming out.

2071
02:33:24,552 --> 02:33:27,013
[SPEAKER_14]: I know especially the anticipation of us coming back tonight.

2072
02:33:27,453 --> 02:33:50,678
[SPEAKER_14]: and I hope the new sound was worth it but at the same time especially for those of you live folks that had to kind of put up with some of the hiccups we've had tonight that will probably continue on into our special live only afterbirth segment after the show thank you guys for sticking by us while we kind of go through all these changes but it's fun it's a new year a new decade of sound and everything

2073
02:33:51,258 --> 02:34:19,408
[SPEAKER_14]: so anyhow and of course if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio we are a non-profit show we're not really a business that's out to make money we don't really run ads during the show all we ask if you like the show tell two friends about the show and help us spread the word that's all we ask we're an independent production we don't have a lot of big dollars behind us and we're just here because we want to have fun that being said let's go around and get everybody's final thought DarkSakura I see you picking up the mic so why don't you give us your final thought um yeah

2074
02:34:20,749 --> 02:34:21,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, your final thought?

2075
